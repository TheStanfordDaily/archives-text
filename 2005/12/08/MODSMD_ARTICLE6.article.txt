# One Last Chance
## University-wide labor strike could be imminent if compromise fails Final contract negotiations between University and workers set for today 
### AMIT ARORA STAFF WRITER 
With final contract negotia
tions between the United Stan
ford Workers and the University
taking place today, more than
1,500 Stanford employees may
walk out on the job come Mon
day. If a compromise is not
achieved, these workers will join
the approximately 1,300 Stan
ford Hospital employees that
have already filed notice to
begin their strike.
Represented by the Service
Employee International Union
(SEIU) Local 715, both the Uni
versity employees and the hospi
tal workers have agreed to strike
together on the same date. Ex
pressing concerns about family
health benefits and employee
pension funds, the union cites
employers' lack of concern for
their needs as the cause of their
protest.
Stanford Hospital
negotiations
The SEIU Local 715 includes
1,412 nursing assistants, house
keepers, lab technicians and
cafeteria workers at Stanford
Hospital and Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital.
The workers have demanded
an increase in staffing levels to
provide adequate patient care
and safety. They have also asked
for full healthcare coverage for
workers' families and cite other
major hospitals in the area that
fully fund health insurance for
family members.
In addition, hospital employ
ees have sought job security, as
Stanford Hospital threatens to
lay off workers after the creation
of a new facility in Redwood
City. Lastly, hospital workers
have applied for industry stan
dard wages, claiming that em
ployees in some positions re-

Final negotiation between Stan
ford University and the United
Stanford Workers
ceive as much as 20 percent below the
market rate for their work.
In the final negotiation between
the union and hospital officials on
Monday, Nov. 21, the union suggested
raises of 30 percent over three years.
The hospital, meanwhile, proposed a
raise of 12 percent over three years,
with additional raises for certain posi
tions. This offer was denied by the
SEIU, and workers voted the follow
ing T\iesday to authorize a strike.
With the strike impending, howev
er, negotiations may possibly be re
sumed. SEIU President Zev Kritky
described the chances a settlement
will be reached.
"After the hospital union workers
gave its 10-day-notice to the hospital,
the hospital shortly after decided that
they want to meet again on the morn
ing of Dec. 7," he said.
The results of this meeting, howev
er, did not bring about significant
change in the contract, as detailed by
Stanford Hospital spokesperson
Sarah Staley.
"The meeting on Dec. 7 between
Stanford Hospital and the union was
compulsory and federally mandated
by the National Labor Relations
Board," she said. "The last official
contract negotiation occurred on
Nov. 21."
Central to bargaining is the issue
of industry' wages. Union workers
from the hospital cite a number of
professions that are below average in
terms of income.
An anesthesia technician, for ex
ample, receives $18.41 per hour at
Stanford Hospital, while one at Valley
Medical Center receives $20.43 per
hour and one at Northern California
Kaiser receives $22.48 per hour, ac
cording to union statistical figures.
The union cited this pattern
throughout the salaries for hospital
staff and has demanded equity. Its
workers additionally have argued
that hospitals such as Northern Cali
fornia Kaiser provide job security, an
issue that the Stanford Hospital has
neglected.
Hospital officials, however, dis
agree with the union's claims and
maintain that the hospital's income
practices are fair and equitable. In a
news release published on Nov. 22,
hospital negotiators cited offers of re
vised lay-off procedures and HMO
premiums for spouses of employees
earning less than $50,000 per year.
Martha Marsh, president and chief
executive officer of Stanford Hospital
& Clinics, described these proposals.
"This collective package is very
competitive with other hospitals in
our region," she said. "This proposal
enhances the compensation package
offered to our SEIU represented em
ployees and our ability to recruit and
retain."
In an interview with The Daily,
Staley highlighted the hospital's ac
tive participation in meetings with the
union.
"The issues that we have dealt with
are wages, benefits and retirement,"
she said. "We were highly responsive
to these issues with the final benefits
offer that we placed on the table.
These are our valued employees and
they deserve to not have to deal with
lost wages. They deserve to receive
the additional benefits that we pro
posed. It is regrettable that larger
SEIU disagreements with the hospi
tal will prevent that."
Ultimately, the failure of the nego
tiation process renders it highly likely
that the hospital workers' strike will
begin on Monday, Dec. 12. Short-term
care is not expected to be affected, as
Staley noted.
"We are a hospital," she said. "Pa
tient care is our number one priority."
Stanford University negotiations
Similar to the demands of the hos
pital workers, the United Stanford
Workers, which represents the service

employees of Stanford University,
has asked for full healthcare coverage
for workers' families and the preser
vation of current retirement security
packages. Composed of more than
1,500 workers, the union includes
food preparation personnel, custodial
staff and University maintenance
crews.
The University presently provides
employees with a number of health
care packages, from various HMO
plans to PPO options. It funds the
complete cost of workers' coverage
for Kaiser Permanente HMO and 82
percent of the cost of workers' family
health care. To pay for other health
care options, however, workers must
make up the difference in health in
surance costs from their own salary.
The SEIU, in recent months, has
pushed for fully-paid healthcare for
workers' families. It has also demand
ed that the University not cut retiree
health benefits through reduction in
pension funding, scheduled to begin
on Jan. 1,2(X)6. Union members argue
that the University is unfairly limiting
employees' access to appropriate re
tirement plans as well as dividing the
union into workers with different re
tirement packages.
The University, however, main
tains that its health care package
ranks with the best of California em
ployers. It cites that 25 percent of Cal
ifornia employers provide retiree
medical care, while Stanford provides
$4.(XX) above Medicare for employ
ees who have worked for more than
40 years.
Meanwhile, the University contin
ues to remain open to compromise re
garding pension packages. Associate
Vice President and Director Alan
Acosta and Senior Assistant to the
President Jeff Wachtel described the
University's position in a joint state
ment.
"Pension benefits are a subject of
ongoing negotiations between the
University and SEU Local 715," they
said. "No decision has been made
about changes at this point. Addition
ally, the current contract does not ex
pire until Aug. 31.2006. As part of the
negotiations on that contract, the par
ties agreed that the contract could be
reopened in the third year to discuss a
limited number of issues, among them
the pension plan. The union asked to
reopen the contract and we are now
discussing that limited set of issues.
We will continue to negotiate these is
sues in good faith at the next session
on Dec. 8."
Today brings the final negotiation
scheduled between the SEIU and the
University. Sophomore Matt Seriff-
Cullick, a member of Stanford Labor
Action Coalition (SLAC), described
the union's goals for the meeting.
"Nobody wants a strike," he said.
"The union is looking fora total re
versal in Union policy though. The
last negotiation meeting, the Univer
sity offered a negligible increase in re
tirement security that was miles away
from what workers were looking for.
The University will have to meet
some of the workers' demands for
compromise to be feasible."
When asked to describe the reper
cussions of the possible strike on stu
dents, Seriff-Cullick noted the incon
veniences.
"Workers in the dining hall will
walk out from the job," he said. "Jani
torial service will stop. Maintenance
service will stop. Students will have to
begin to take care of themselves.
Hopefully, however, these concerns
will be considered minor compared to
the workers' struggles with the Uni
versity."
Acosta and Wachtel, however,
maintained the University would pro
vide students with the necessities of
residential life.
"In the event that SEIU Local 715
engages in a work stoppage or strike,
we want to reassure students that the

Univ. open to compromise

University will continue to operate
and provide necessary services," they
said. "Stanford Dining has a plan in
place to consolidate dining facilities
and extend hours of operation to
maintain service. Student Housing
will also continue to respond to ur
gent repairs and provide core custodi
al service during this period."
Student Involvement
With workers active in their nego
tiations with the University, students
have generally responded to the labor
struggles with their support for em
ployee demands. At the forefront of
student activism, SLAC has posi
tioned students behind the workers
through public demonstrations and
coordinated efforts with union lead
ers.
SLAC, in conjunction with the
Coalition for Labor Justice (CLJ),
will stage a rally today in White Plaza,
which is expected to attract more than
100 students. On Nov. 2, SLAC and
the SEIU held a march of more than
500 workers and 100 students, raising
awareness of the workers' needs.
Seriff-Cullick described the orga
nization's planning and compared it
to the SEIU's approach.
"There are separate contracts with
separate groups of workers," he said.
"Because the same decision-making
structures are behind the negotia
tions, the workers, however, have
agreed to negotiate together. They
are exhibiting solidarity, and SLAC is
modeling that. We, as students, must
practice solidarity to achieve change."
For this reason. SLAC has at
tempted to increase student aware
ness regarding labor issues. Senior
Chris Vaughn, a member of SLAC,
outlined the organization's goal to
draw students to the picket lines if
and when strikes begin.
" In the various surveys and studies
I have seen, roughly 70 percent of the
student body is located left to center,"
he said. "As observers of the student
body have pointed out, the vast ma
jority of people on the left are moder
ate liberals. While there are those on
the left who are activists, this group is
sadly a minority. One of the chal
lenges of organizing at Stanford is
that there is not a significant pool of
activist-minded students to draw on.
You have to bring people into the
loop that perhaps have not done so on
their own volition."
Vaughn also recounted the last
strike in University history as a 30-
day demonstration spanning Septem
ber and October of 1982.
"There were a number of students
who supported the unions in that
movement," he said. "At the same
time there were many students who
were interviewed who expressed dis
gust and anger because of the condi
tions that emerged from the strike. I
would not be surprised if some of
those similar sentiments are ex
pressed here. While convenience and
inconvenience should not be swept
under the rug, 1 hope the discussion
on campus will center on labor and
justice."
Freshman Liz Brody shared
Vaughn's sentiments.
"I think it is unfortunate that peo
ple are focusing on how students are
going to be affected and not the work
ers and the allocation of the Universi
ty's resources," she said."The workers
will not be earning wages. Their job
security will be threatened. Stanford
students are capable of taking care of
themselves, and we should think
about the workers."
Brody, though, recognized the
practical implications of the strike as
well.
"Life will change," she said. "Liv
ing in the dorms will become harder.
We will have to do more things our
selves. But ultimately, we have to de
cide what is more important: our lux
uries or the workers' necessities."
