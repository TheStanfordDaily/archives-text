# Group scopes site for green dorm

### ROSE JENKINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Change the way you live by
where you live" was the motto put
forth by Richard Luthy, chair of the
Civil and Environmental Engineer
ing Department, as he presented the
Green Dorm Project, the plan for an
innovative, ecologically friendly
dormitory, to representatives of the
Obayashi Corporation.
A team of Stanford faculty and
students is working on the Green
Dorm Project, but plans for the
building are far from final. The
"Green Dorm" is expected to
house 50 to 55 Stanford students
and may feature specially-designed
glass doors for ventilation as well
as an underfloor heating and cool
ing system.
Additionally, a ground-couple
heat pump would provide natural
temperature regulation â€” taking
advantage of the relatively warm
ground during the winter and the
relatively cool earth during the sum
mer. Finally.cultivating plants on the
roof will provide better insulation,
protect building materials and possi
bly allow for water purification.
The innovative technologies
should not require considerable
lifestyle changes. Gil Masters, a pro
fessor emeritus in civil and environ
mental engineering and another
leader of the Green Dorm Project,
compared the Green Dorm to
Columbae, which is a house found
to have the lowest energy costs per
student on the Row.
"These folks tend to be the green
est people on campus in terms of hug
ging trees and whatever." Masters
said. "We have to be at least as green as
a house built in 1920 and have normal
students living in it"he added in jest.
The Green Dorm Project team is

now finishing up the scoping phase,
which involves working with admin
istrative processes to address Uni
versity regulations. ITiey have con
sidered two sites for the house, and
team members are leaning toward a
Mayfield site, somewhere behind
Xanadu and Casa Italiana, to draw
more visitors.
Three architects and engineers
from Obayashi,a Japanese architec
ture and construction firm, joined
students and faculty from the Civil
and Environmental Engineering
Department for the "Workshop on
Sustainable Buildings and Tech
nologies" on Feb. 24 and 25.
Martin Fischer, a professor of civil
and environmental engineering and
a leader of the Green Dorm Project
team, noted that the School of Engi
neering has a long-standing relation

ship with Obayashi. Stanford alumni
occupy senior management posi
tions in the company, and the firm of
fers internships to students in the
Kyoto Overseas Studies Program.
"The interaction has been one of
the more long-lasting and fruitful
for teaching and learning." Fischer
said. "When they heard about our
Green Dorm Project, they offered
to come share their expertise, which
is rare and great."
On Feb. 24. Obayashi represen
tatives presented a public seminar
about sustainable buildings, which
exposed Green Dorm Project de
signers to environmental building
techniques used by the company.
The workshop consisted of semi
nars and break-out groups over the
course of two days so that members
of the Green Dorm team could re

ceive feedback and guidance on
their building plans.
To provide energy to the house,
a 10-kilowatt,9oo-square-foot pho
tovoltaic cell could be paired with
other solar cells as well as a solid
oxide fuel cell. Leaving nothing to
waste, excess heat from the fuel cell
would be used to provide hot
water.
With all these systems, the Green
Dorm Project team expects that, by
selling electricity produced during the
day to the utility company and buying
it back at night, the house would have
a zero net consumption of electricity.
Masters compared energy pro
duction through the Green Dorm
technologies to normal electricity
and fuel supplies.
"Here's a furnace that's 162 per
cent efficient," he said jokingly.
As for water usage, there are a
number of plans for the Green
Dorm. The team expects that it will
be possible to obtain enough water
independent of a utility company, by
recycling waste water to create
potable water. However, regula
tions will dictate what kind of waste
water can be recycled and limit the
use of the recycled water to toilets
and irrigation. Even so. that would
decrease water use by 50 percent.
"We can do a lot more technologi
cally than what we would be allowed by
the county." said Masters. "These are in
some sense conservative estimates, and
we're not going too far." he said.
The idea for the Green Dorm
Project first arose in November 2(X)3,
when faculty of the Civil and Envi
ronmental Engineering Department
first conceived of a "living laborato
ry," where technologies for energy
use and water management/conser
vation could be used and tested.
