# Pocket-size player poses big-time problem
## 
### MIA LEE DESK EDITOR 
When was the last time you were excited to
hear something described as''impossibly small"?
Apple, Inc. hopes it was Sept. 7, when the
Cupertino-based company announced the
release of its wafer-thin i Pod nano, the latest
and great-est addition to an omnipresent
mp3-player lineup.
The sleek device, which comes in white
or black, weighs just 1.5 ounces and is a
mere 0.27 inches thick.Touted as being thin
ner than a standard No. 2 pencil, the nano
squeezes past comparable players that are
more than twice its size.
At the San Francisco press conference, Apple
Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs promised
that good things, indeed, come in small packages,
"iPod nano is the biggest revolution since
the original iPod," Jobs said. "iPod nano is a
full-featured iPod in an impossibly small
size, and it's going to change the rules for the
entire portable music market."
Even at an arm's length, the nano's
postage stamp-sized screen gleams, aston
ishingly clear, in its millions of colors and
176 by 132 pixel resolution. The 4 GB vari
ety of nano, akin to its mini sibling, can hold
up to 1,000 songs. But, unlike the mini,
which has a black-and-white display, the
nano can display album art right alongside
the names of its user's tracks.
The color screen also gives users the oppor
tunity to use the nano as a glitzy photo storage
device, which can carry up to 25,000 pictures,
Nano gives thanks to flash memory for
helping maintain its deceptively waif
like physique. In the techie world, flash
memory is defined as a solid state stor
age device, with "solid" referring to its
stationary electronic — as opposed to
moving, mechanical — parts.
In layman's terms, choosing flash
memory over a bulkier hard drive
translates to more remaining space in
side the nano fora long-lasting battery.
Apple tech specs highlight the nano's
14 hours of playback time, just an hour
shy of regular iPod endurance.
Emblazoned with a brilliant dis
play, Energizer-bunnv moxie and in
novative appeal,one might start to be

lieve that there's nothing impossible
about the impossibly small product.
But before you give Steve Jobs
your undying praise and your local re
tailer $249 plus tax, consider the tragic
testimony of Matthew Peterson.
Peterson, 26. and creator of the Web
site, http://flawedmusicplayer.com. was
dismayed to find his nano's liquid crys
tal display (LCD) screen cracked after
just four days of use.
Peterson laments that the dura
bility of regular iPod screens does not
appear to carry over to the nano line.
"With the regular iPod. the screen
cover doesn't flex — it's a very tough
plastic over the LCD," he tells The
Daily. "On the nano, it's very flexible
and when you touch it.it allows you
to touch the LCD underneath."
