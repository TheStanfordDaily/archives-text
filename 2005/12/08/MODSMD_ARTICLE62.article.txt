# Benched players speak on what keeps them motivated

### EMMA VAUGHN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At some point during their career
at Stanford, many students dream
about being a part of the Stanford bas
ketball team.
The fame and exposure combined
with the unconditional support of an
obsessive fan base seems like the
ideal way to spend four years of col
lege. Josh Childress didn't need his
afro to be recognized by every per
son on campus, and the name Chris
Hernandez has become more famil
iar than John Hennessy.
However, the team is composed of
more than just a few famous individu
als. There are the "non-starters" — or
"benchwarmers" — who devote ex
tensive amounts of time and effort to
the team, but often play only three or
four minutes during the actual game.
For these players, who do not bask in
fame and glory.it is all about the sport.
"You do it because you want to be
as good as you can be," said sopho
more Tim Morris, who is academical
ly ineligible to play for the remainder
of the quarter. "I have an ideal pic
ture of where I want to be as a bas
ketball player and practicing every
day motivates me to get to that point,
regardless of game time." 4
Taj Finger, a freshman who aver
ages about eight minutes per game,
agreed that playing time is not what
matters the most and cited his per
sonal drive as the primary motiva
tion for his work ethic.
"The desire to be really good is
the key motivation," Finger said. "I
know that I am going to have to go in
there eventually, even if it's just fora
few minutes, and when I do, I want to
contribute positively to the game."
Finger, like most members of the
team, came from a high school bas

ketball program in which he domi
nated the court for four years. Ad
justing to the skill and pace of the
Stanford team was something that
took time and effort.
"It's a very different game from a
mental standpoint" said freshman
center Peter Prowitt, who set four
high school records and gained nu
merous all-state and all-league hon
ors. "You have to learn a variety of
new plays and just really think the
game. It's hard coming in accustomed
to being the biggest and strongest guy
on the court, and then suddenly be
surrounded by guys your size."
Some players say that the lack of
playing time actually helps their
game. They say it gives them the abili
ty to focus more on their weaknesses
and goals.
"When you have less playing time
it allows you to have extra time to re
ally try and improve yourself,"
Prowitt said. "Chris [Hernandez] is
at a certain level and he has to work
hard, but I have to work a lot harder
to get to that point."
Fred Washington, a sophomore
forward averaging nine minutes on
the floor, believes that motivation is
a matter of loving the game enough.
"It all comes from liking to play,"
Washington said. "If you don't enjoy
doing it, why do it in the first place?
You know you're going to get your
chance at some point."
Head Coach TVent Johnson sup
ports this notion. He sees no discrep
ancy in the way he motivates the
starters versus the bench.
"There's not much motivation on
my part needed," Johnson explained,
"They all understand that it's a team
and they're every bit as important to
our success as anyone else. They
