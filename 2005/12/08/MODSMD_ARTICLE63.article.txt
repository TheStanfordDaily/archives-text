# Old Hollywood Revived
## 
### AMIN EL GAMAL 
A spotlight hits the aging starlet as she
makes her way down the crimson-carpeted
theater aisle, an organ playing triumphantly
in the background.The celluloid rolls and the
dazzled audience shuffles in anticipation of
the star's reaction to her film. No mind that
the starlet is just a step from senility — her
image on screen revives her inner-youth.
In a world of generic multi-complex
movie theaters, amazingly expensive ticket
prices for not-so-amazing films and popcorn
with enough butter to fill Joan Rivers' visage,
such a fulfilling movie-going experience
seems something one can only dream of.
Luckily,one need not dream further than 221
University Ave., home of the chicly nostalgic
Stanford Theatre for more than 75 years.
"There is nothing like the atmosphere at
the Stanford," says sophomore Ann Luce
na. "The ticket stubs are old-fashioned and
the entrance is gorgeous and truly unique.
There is something so charming about the
organist who bobs up and down on his plat
form while he plays."
At its opening on June 6,1925, the Stan
ford Theater was considered one of the finest
in California, according to the now extinct
Palo Alto Times. But over the years, lack of
maintenance led to the theater's deteriora
tion. In its darkest days, peeling posters lit
tered the mirror-tiled floor and a metallic
chandelier sprouted from the drab ceiling.
The dilapidated movie palace needed a miracle
It was then that Hewlett-Packard scion
David Packard came on the scene. After
Fred Astaire died in 1987, Packard decided
to rent the theater and play a two-week
program of Astaire's films. The mini festi
val was a tremendous hit — more than
1,000 people attended each night — and in
response to the program's success, the
David and Lucille. Packard Foundation
purchased the Stanford Theater for slightly
less than $2 million that same year.
Packard began the process of painstak
ingly restoring the theater to its original
splendor.The nearly 1,500 seats were refur

bished and covered with ruby mohair, the
detailed interior was redone in its original
style and the long-gone organ was replaced
by the original "Mighty" Wurlitzer from
the famous Graumann's Chinese Theater
in Hollywood. The restoration took two
years and $6 million, but the final product
managed to recapture the luster of old Hol
lywood. "During the intermission of' Gone
With the Wind,' I overheard this conversa
tion between two elderly women who were
reminiscing on when the originally movie
came out and how they had such big crush
es on Clark Gable," Lucena says."It was
fascinating to listen to — they were reliv
ing a special time from their past."
Since its reopening, the theater has exclusive
ly played films made between 1920 and 1970.
This weekend you can catch the musi
cals "Stormy Weather" and "Sun Valley
Serenatde" — starring Lena Home and
figure skater Sonja Henie, respectively.The
price fora double feature is currently set at
$6 general — not the original 60-cent fare
of the opening, but still a far cry from a trip
to a multiplex venue.
Plus, there is something to be said for
the ambiance.

"There's a dimension you lose if you J
don't watch [a classic movies] with an au- J
dience," Packard told the Palo Alto m
Weekly. M

Sophomore Dominique Cobb
agrees.
"The first time I went to the Stan
ford, I saw 'Some Like it Hot,' and J

basically, it was the most fun I've
had in a movie theater in years —
I enjoyed every minute of it. I i
think that watching it at the Stan- J

ford definitely played a huge
role in that."
The Stanford also invites i

old Hollywood stars for spe
cial screenings. Past guests

have included Oscar
winners Eva Marie
Saint, Jake Lemmon
and Billy Wilder, as well

as director George Sidney and actresses
Sandra Dee and Margaret O'Brian.
On such occasions, the theater is trans
formed into an exciting movie palace
where stars share anecdotes and ultimately
reign again fora few hours.
