# Type Aâ€”not just a personality trait
## 
### ILENA GEORGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The phrase "Type A" is often used to de
scribe someone who is fast-moving, aggres
sive, inconsiderate and a stickler for detail.
This popular conception of "Type A" has its
origins in studies from the 1960s that found a
connection between people exhibiting these
behaviors and an increased risk o^heirt disease.
"Type A" is not a personality type," Dr. Wesley
Alles, director of the Stanford Health Improve
ment Program, said. "It is a chronic-progressive
disease that produces excessive risk for disease, es
pecially heart disease and Type 2 diabetes"
"Type A" disease was originally discov
ered when cardiologists Dr. Meyer Friedman
and Dr. Ray Rosenman became aware of the
fact that their upholstered chairs in the lobby
would wear out more quickly than chairs in
the offices of physicians in other fields. Fried
man and Rosenman discovered that their pa
tients would shrecf the waiting room chairs
while waiting for their appointments. The
cardiologists originally called the phenome
non "coronary prone behavior pattern."
"[Friedman and Rosenman] coined the
term 'Type A' in the early 1960s to describe a
collection of traits that they found in some
individuals," Biology Prof. Robert Sapolsky

wrote in his hook "Why Zebras Don't Get
Ulcers." "[TJhey characterized 'Type-A' peo
ple as immensely competitive, overachiev
ing, time-pressured and hostile."
Becaase people with these traits seemed more
prevalent in their cardiology clinic than in other
clinics. Friedman and Rosenman linked these be
haviors with an increased risk of heart disease.
However, other doctors were skeptical of
the causal relationship between "Type-A"
behavior and heart disease. Many thought

that heart disease was a cause, and not a re
sult, of "Type-A" behaviors.
"In the beginning there was much disbelief
of the existence of such a condition, especially
by physicians, but there have been many,
many studies on 'Type-A' characteristics and
its impact on disease states," Alles said.
Friedman and Rosenman completed one
such study that showed that the presence of
"Type-A" characteristics preceded heart dis
ease. Other researchers were unable to replicate
these findings, but new studies determined that
hostility, a characteristic related to "Type A." was
a key factor in predicting heart disease.
"[W]hen scientists re-analyzed some of
the original 'Type-A' studies and broke the
constellation of traits into individual ones,
hostility popped out as the only significant
predictor of heart disease," Sapolsky wrote
in his book. "These various studies have sug
gested that a high degree of hostility predicts
coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, hem
orrhagic stroke and higher rates of mortality
with these diseases."
However, Sapolsky added, studies have
also shown that hostility leads to an in
creased risk of other diseases as well.
