### COURTNEY WEAVER DESK EDITOR 
Let's he honest, I'm pretty badass.
Though don't have any tattoos, rocker
boyfriends or mug shots to date, I bend the
rules in my own sort of way. I skip the occa
sional I-Hum lecture and bike on the side
walks. I've even said the word "sex" on na
tional television. So when the founder of the
Stanford Motorcycle Club picked me up for
our interview on the "Cadillac of Motorcy
cles," I have to say I wasn't blown away at the
proposition.
My dreams of joining Hell's Angels with
my hair blowing wildly in the wind were fur
ther thwarted by an oversized helmet. But in
true journalistic fashion, 1 chivalrously put
my rebel-rousing tendencies aside for one
ride and realized that, sports bike or not, I
was the closest to a Biker Babe that I was
ever going to get.
Unfortunately, my biker image trailed far
behind that of my driver's. Chris Pumo, co
term by day and biker by lunch breaks. Pumo's
leather jacket and ripped jeans proved his
slight edge on the coolness factor. Also, while I
was only trailing along for one Sunday after
noon ride, Pumo can be credited as the
founder of the Stanford Motorcycle Club.
Pumo started the organization about a
month and a half ago as a way to organize a
forum for all of the area's bikers. Fed up with
having to travel to San Jose fora group ride,
he posted flyers near motorcycle parking
spaces and on parked motorcycles around
campus. He received a surge of responses, and
thanks to the resurrection of an old motorcy
cle Stanford e-mail list and word-of-mouth.
the club has grown in size to about 30 people.
Members range from senior Robbv
Ratan, who bought his first motorcycle from
eßay three months ago, to 51-year-old Craig
Haggart, a Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter staff member, who has been riding motor
cycles for more than 35 years.
Pumo bought his first bike, a 1980
Kawasaki, three years ago. Since then, the
Kawasaki has had two successors. Pumo is
now working on putting together a 1970
Harley Davidson, which he bought last sum
mer disassembled in cardboard boxes — and
without a frame.
• After reading how-to books and talking to
mechanics, Pumo said he has been able to
complete roughly 60 percent of the job and
hopes to finish it entirely by this summer.
"It's like a giant Lego set for adults, only a
little more complicated," Pumo said.
While Pumo's parents initially disap
proved of his first motorcycle purchase, his
dad has since come around, though Pumo says
that his mother is still a little more hesitant.
"I don't know if anyone's mom would love
them riding a motorcycle," he said.
That said, however, members hardly go on
their share of joy rides.
Weekly meetings are Fridays at 11:30 a.m.
at the Stanford Driving Range Parking Lot.
where the group meets to ride up to Alice's,
on the corner of Skyline and Highway 84, for
lunch. On the weekends, members will some
times take a longer ride, such as the one
planned fora Half-Moon Bay mechanic
show next Sunday.
In the future, Pumo hopes to plan an
overnight for the group, and he is thinking about
trying to make the club officially Stanford-affili
ated in order to increase publicity. However, the
latter is not a huge priority for Pumo.
"I'm not so interested in [making it offi
cial]," he said. "I'm more interested in Stan
ford riders getting together and being able to
go fora ride at a moment's notice."
For club members such as Haggart, biking
gives new meaning to the word passion.

"Riding a motorcycle on a twisty road is
sort of a combination of riding a horse and
dancing," Haggart said. "There's a wonderful
fluidity about the skill it takes to do it well,
and the machine both responds to your input
and moves in a certain way on its own. Even
a mild' motorcycle has an incredible power
to-weight ratio, so the response can be in
credibly exhilarating."
Ratan, who just bought his bike last year,
also expressed his enthusiasm for the sport.
" In my first month 1 put over 1 ,(XX) miles on the
bike just cruising around the foothills," he said.
In his second month, he was less lucky.
"I crashed because I hit some gravel while
going around a blind turn," Ratan said."Luckily
it wasn't too bad, and 1 learned an important les
son about rider attitude: Never ride in a rush."
Ratan's fall is the only one to date for the club.
"I guess accidents happen " Pumo said.
"Motorcycling is not badminton."
He noted that group traveling, in addition
to being more fun, is also safer.
"Safety is a really important thing to me,"
Pumo said."l try to make all club rides,safe rides."
Pumo said that the club keeps the group
pace to the slowest or least experienced
member. Other club members agreed this
was a good tactic.
"To me, it's not so much about going fast in
an absolute sense, but going fast in a relative
sense," Haggart said. "That is, anyone can go
135 m.p.h. in a straight line on a modern mo
torcycle: the fun — and.in my opinion, the real
skill — comes from going 30 or 40 in a corner
where you would normally do 20 or 25."
Ratan agreed that absolute speed is not
his favorite aspect of riding.
"TTie thing I love most about riding is that
you are really part of the landscape — you
feel the air temperature and smell the trees
— as opposed to a car, where you are a pas
sive observer through a window," Ratan said.
Ratan pointed out that there was an ever fur
ther perk of the job: "Chicks dig guys with
bikes."
