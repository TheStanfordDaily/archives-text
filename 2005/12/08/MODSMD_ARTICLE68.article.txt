## SO CLOSE, YET SO FAR Cardinal can't escape another late breakdown Stanford falters in waning minutes to UCLA, finishes 5-6 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
As awful as Stanford felt after blowing a three-pos
session lead to UC-Davis Sept. 17. the Cardinal took sol
ace at the time, believing that such a collapse was unlike
ly to occur again. After Saturday's heart-wrenching 30-
27 overtime loss to UCLA, that small comfort is gone.
In one of the most hyped contests on the Farm in
vears — and in front of a Stanford Stadium season-high
42,850 — the No. 8 UCLA Bruins (8-0. 5-0 Pacific 10
Conference) erased a 24-3 deficit with three straight
touchdowns in the final 7:04. After a Stanford field goal
in overtime, UCLA quarterback Drew Olson lofted a
23-yard corner route to wide receiver Brandon Breazell,
as the Bruins snapped Stanford's (4-3,3-2 Pac-10) three
game win-streak and kept their perfect season alive.

Despite an emphasis on finishing ballgames, Stan
ford has struggled in the fourth quarter this season,
posting just 26 points to opponents' 82. Saturday's con
test was no exception, as Stanford gave up four plays
longer than 20 yards after the third quarter, despite al
lowing only two prior to that point.
"We just let them off the hook with the deep ball."
coach Walt Harris said.
"We had them," said senior running back J.R.
Lemon, who notched 103 total yards and two touch
downs in his first start this season. "You've just got to
step on their necks when you have the chance."
Credit goes to UCLA, though, as the Bruins adjusted
their offensive strategy just in time for their late-game
heroics.
"They started running a hurry-up offense, which lim
ited our calls because we couldn't huddle up," said jun
ior cornerback Nick Sanchez, who forced and recovered
a fumble. "They also ran a lot of screens and draws."
Many of those late plays went to running back Maurice
Drew, whose 175 all-purpose yards on the day made him

UCLA's all-time leader in the category. Drew's six-yard
run with 7:04 left cut Stanford's lead to 24-10. while his
one-yard dive with 46 seconds to play in regulation tied
the contest at 24-all.
For the Cardinal. Lemon scored on a 13-yard screen
in the first quarter and a nine-yard screen in the third
quarter, giving Stanford a 14-3 lead after 45 minutes of
play. Nick Frank punched in a seven-yard run early in
the fourth, and 40- and 42-yard field goals from senior
kicker Michael Sgroi rounded out Stanford's scoring.
However, Stanford failed to convert several other
scoring opportunities, punting four times in Bruin territo
ry. Nine Cardinal penalties for 87 yards — both season
highs — were one reason for Stanford's stalled drives.
"We were real good in the penalty area until this game,"
Harris said. "We took a victory away from ourselves."
Stanford's offense also suffered from the injury of
junior wide receiver Mark Bradford, who left the game
midway through the first quarter with an ankle sprain.

The fourth-quarter was a menace to the Cardinal this season, as Stanford was outscored 1 16-50 in the final 15 minutes of regulation. Stanford surrendered a fourth-quarter
lead in losses to UC-Davis, UCLA and Notre Dame. The Cardinal finished the season at 4-4 in the Pac-10.
After snagging a career-high 185
yards and two touchdowns last week
against Arizona State, Bradford
caught only two passes for 21 yards
against UCLA.
"To lose a guy like that is pretty
hard on the offense," said junior quar
terback TVent Edwards, who complet
ed 18 of 25 passes for 169 yards and
two touchdowns in the loss.
With his two scores Saturday, Ed
wards has now thrown for 12 touch
downs and zero interceptions in his
past four games, and his two inter
ceptions this season are the fewest of
any Pac-10 signal-caller.
Edwards completed his first 10
attempts, misfiring until 2:08 into the
third quarter. However, the Los
Gatos native completed only three
of 10 passes in the fourth quarter and
overtime.
In marked contrast, Olson's first
completion came 2:08 into the sec
ond quarter, marking the Bruin's ini

tial first down. However,*Olson com
pleted 15 of 20 passes for 206 yards
in the fourth quarter and overtime.
Stanford also missed several op
portunities to force several addition
al turnovers. Senior cornerback T.J.
Rushing dropped an interception off
his chest in the first quarter, while
senior outside linebacker Jon Alston
muffed a fumble recovery in the
third when he tried to return the
dropped ball fora touchdown.
Rushing was also beat on
Breazell's game-winning score.
"I thought I was in pretty decent
shape." Rushing said. "But whenever it
became time to make the play, I didn't."
Sanchez was also disappointed
with his play in the closing minutes.
"Personally, it tore my heart out,"
Sanchez said. "I was one of the play
ers who got beat at the end of the
game. It hurts."
Harris sympathized with his play
ers' frustration.
"I feel real bad," Harris said. "I
told them I wish there was some
thing I could say or do to ease the
pain. But I can't."
