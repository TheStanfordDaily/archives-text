## Cardinal swept by Sun Devils in wild weekend 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
For 64 straight weekends of Pacific-10 Con
ference play, the No. 14 Stanford Cardinal had
won at least one game in a three-game series.
They couldn't make it 65.
In a wild and disappointing weekend of base
ball in the desert, the Cardinal (20-14. 4-5 Pac
-10) were swept by Arizona State (25-15, 6-3),
dropping each game in a very different fashion.

It was the first time Stanford was swept in a Pac
-10 series since April of 1997.
What may be the hardest pill to swallow is the
fact that the Cardinal were in the final two
games through the last out.
There was no shortage of drama Saturday
night as the Sun Devils won, 6-5, on a game-end
ing walk by freshman Nolan Gallagher.
The Cardinal led 5-3 heading into the bottom
of the ninth inning, but two of Stanford's most
consistent relievers were unable to pick up the
final three outs.
Arizona State designated hitter Rocky Lagu
na opened the ninth with a single back up the
middle to set the table for rightfielder Travis
Buck. Buck, a preseason All-American and a
member of Team USA. crushed a 2-2 offering
from sophomore reliever Blake Holler over the
right field wall to tie the game at 5-5.
Stanford wasn't out of the woods yet, with no
outs and the heart of the Sun Devil lineup com
ing up, but things were looking good when
Holler retired Arizona State RBI leader Tuffy
Gosewisch and Pac-10 home run leader Jeff Lar
ish in order. However, leftfielder Colin Curtis
walked and sophomore second baseman Seth
Dhaenens reached on a controversial infield hit
to chase Holler from the game. Television re
plays showed that Dhaenens was out but the in
ning continued.
Gallagher entered and issued a four-pitch
walk to third baseman Joey Hooft before walk
ing shortstop Joe Persichina on five pitches to
end the game.
The late-inning collapse spoiled starting
pitcher Jeff Gilmore's best start of the confer
ence season. Gilmore went 6 2/3 innings, giving
up just three runs on four hits, but earned a no
decision once ASU took the lead.
"A summer ball coach told me a year ago the
best starting pitchers in the game, they don't
make their money because they win games,"
Gilmore said. "It's because they stop the losing
streak and they can right the ship with their per
formance alone."
Sunday's contest was certainly the wackiest
of the bunch â€” featuring a successful triple
steal, a designated hitter who pitched and relief
appearances by both the Friday night and Satur
day night starters. Despite the antics. ASU came
out on top, 10-9.
The triple steal was a vital part of a seven-run
Arizona State rally in the sixth inning that erased a
5-3 deficit and rocketed the Sun Devils into the lead.
With two outs and the bases loaded. Larish
broke for home and slid in just ahead of the
pitch by junior reliever Matt Manship. loiter in
the same at-bat Dhaenens drove in two with a
single to left.

rare sweep on the road.
