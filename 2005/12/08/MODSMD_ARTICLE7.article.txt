## NAACP plans die-in protest 
### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
Ironically planned for Dead Week, the Stan
ford chapter of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) will
hold a die-in today at noon. The event will slow
hike traffic near Stanford's Clock Tower as sev
eral members of the Stanford NAACP lay down
and others hold informational signs regarding
"Tookie" and the death penalty.
The die-in is intended to educate the Stan
ford community and citizens of California on
why the life of reformed gang leader Stanley
"Tookie" Williams should he spared and on the
role that race and socioeconomic status play in
the administration of the death penalty within
the American legal system. Williams, a five-time
Nobel Peace Prize nominee, four-time Nobel
Prize for Literature nominee and recipient of
the 2(X)5 Presidential Call for Service Award, is
scheduled to be executed by lethal injection on

TUesday, Dec. 13. One of the founders of the
Crips, a Los Angeles gang. Williams was convict
ed in 1979 for the deaths of four people.
"We want the entire Stanford community to
bear witness to the incredible injustice that will
occur if nothing is done to prevent it," said jun
ior Kiah Williams, president of the Stanford
NAACP, which encourages students to wear
black on Thursday in support of the die-in. "The
Stanford NAACP, through its die-in demonstra
tion. will promote awareness of the urgency for
California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger not to
execute Tookie and will show the governor that
there is a strong base of support for the anti-gang
activist lifestyle Tookie has led since his incarcer
ation. We hope to promote non-violent protest
ing as an effective means of political action.
There is still work to be done in the fight for
equal rights and social justice, and as Stanford
students, its important that we all participate in
that fight any way that we can."
Freshman Mondaire Jones, secre
tary for Stanford NAAC P and mem
bei of the NAA( T\ National Youth
Work Committee, said she is person
ally interested in sav ing Williams' life.
"Tookie brings credibility to the
realm of anti-gang activism that re
mains unparalleled among those still
alive today," Jones said. "He is living
proof that, no matter how shameful
one's past, there is always hope for
redemption. Mis accomplishments
since being jailed range from the res
olution of gang conflicts in many of
America's inner-city areas to the de
terrence he has promoted from his
jail cell through audio, video and his
children's books on the subject."
Jones also noted that Tookie has
maintained his innocence regarding
the four murders for which he was

convicted in 1979.
"This man could have prevented
his execution had he just admitted to
those crimes, and the fact that he has
n't tells nic he is to he believed,"
Jones said.
Williams is interested in saving
the former gang leader's life in part
because of his personal opposition to
the death penalty.
"I do not believe the death penal
ty is a fair or just way to punish of
fenders. historically it has dispropor
tionately penalized minorities and
those who are economically disad
vantaged." Williams said. "In addi
tion, in a society that touts rehabilita
tion as the purpose for imprison
ment. the death penalty gives in
mates over 20 years, as in Tookie's
case, to think about what they have
done. Yet, after they have had a
chance to reform their lives, they are
killed anyway. To me, this is the cru
dest punishment that we could pos
sibly inflict — teasing with the op
portunity for redemption to then
have one's life taken."

In addition to the die-in. the Stan
ford NAACP has planned several
other campus events for the academ
ic year. Hie group provides a tutor
ing and mentorship program at the
4 l )ers Academy Middle School in
East Palo Alto — an alternative ed
ucation school for at-risk children —
and sponsors a speaker's series on
the role of race in the United States.
Additional programming will focus
on the Stanford community, accord
ing to Williams and Jones.
"We will tackle the issue of diver
sity within the ranks of the Universi
ty's faculty," Williams said. "For an
institution that touts its student body
as one of the most diverse, the facul
ty is extremely lacking in minority
and women faculty members. We
will also be chronicling black ac
tivism at Stanford over the past three
decades for viewing during Black
Liberation Month [in February], to
culminate a month of educational
and celebratory programming spon
sored by the Black Community Ser
vices Center."

institution that touts its student body
as one of the most diverse, the facul
ty is extremely lacking in minority
and women faculty members. We
will also be chronicling black ac
tivism at Stanford over the past three
decades for viewing during Black
Liberation Month [in February], to
culminate a month of educational
and celebratory programming spon
sored by the Black Community Ser
vices Center."
Ironically planned for Dead Week, the Stan
ford chapter of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) will
hold a die-in today at noon. The event will slow
hike traffic near Stanford's Clock Tower as sev
eral members of the Stanford NAACP lay down
and others hold informational signs regarding
"Tookie" and the death penalty.
The die-in is intended to educate the Stan
ford community and citizens of California on
why the life of reformed gang leader Stanley
"Tookie" Williams should he spared and on the
role that race and socioeconomic status play in
the administration of the death penalty within
the American legal system. Williams, a five-time
Nobel Peace Prize nominee, four-time Nobel
Prize for Literature nominee and recipient of
the 2(X)5 Presidential Call for Service Award, is
scheduled to be executed by lethal injection on

TUesday, Dec. 13. One of the founders of the
Crips, a Los Angeles gang. Williams was convict
ed in 1979 for the deaths of four people.
"We want the entire Stanford community to
bear witness to the incredible injustice that will
occur if nothing is done to prevent it," said jun
ior Kiah Williams, president of the Stanford
NAACP, which encourages students to wear
black on Thursday in support of the die-in. "The
Stanford NAACP, through its die-in demonstra
tion. will promote awareness of the urgency for
California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger not to
execute Tookie and will show the governor that
there is a strong base of support for the anti-gang
activist lifestyle Tookie has led since his incarcer
ation. We hope to promote non-violent protest
ing as an effective means of political action.
There is still work to be done in the fight for
equal rights and social justice, and as Stanford
students, its important that we all participate in
that fight any way that we can."
Freshman Mondaire Jones, secre
tary for Stanford NAAC P and mem
bei of the NAA( T\ National Youth
Work Committee, said she is person
ally interested in sav ing Williams' life.
"Tookie brings credibility to the
realm of anti-gang activism that re
mains unparalleled among those still
alive today," Jones said. "He is living
proof that, no matter how shameful
one's past, there is always hope for
redemption. Mis accomplishments
since being jailed range from the res
olution of gang conflicts in many of
America's inner-city areas to the de
terrence he has promoted from his
jail cell through audio, video and his
children's books on the subject."
Jones also noted that Tookie has
maintained his innocence regarding
the four murders for which he was

convicted in 1979.
"This man could have prevented
his execution had he just admitted to
those crimes, and the fact that he has
n't tells nic he is to he believed,"
Jones said.
Williams is interested in saving
the former gang leader's life in part
because of his personal opposition to
the death penalty.
"I do not believe the death penal
ty is a fair or just way to punish of
fenders. historically it has dispropor
tionately penalized minorities and
those who are economically disad
vantaged." Williams said. "In addi
tion, in a society that touts rehabilita
tion as the purpose for imprison
ment. the death penalty gives in
mates over 20 years, as in Tookie's
case, to think about what they have
done. Yet, after they have had a
chance to reform their lives, they are
killed anyway. To me, this is the cru
dest punishment that we could pos
sibly inflict — teasing with the op
portunity for redemption to then
have one's life taken."

In addition to the die-in. the Stan
ford NAACP has planned several
other campus events for the academ
ic year. Hie group provides a tutor
ing and mentorship program at the
4 l )ers Academy Middle School in
East Palo Alto — an alternative ed
ucation school for at-risk children —
and sponsors a speaker's series on
the role of race in the United States.
Additional programming will focus
on the Stanford community, accord
ing to Williams and Jones.
"We will tackle the issue of diver
sity within the ranks of the Universi
ty's faculty," Williams said. "For an
institution that touts its student body
as one of the most diverse, the facul
ty is extremely lacking in minority
and women faculty members. We
