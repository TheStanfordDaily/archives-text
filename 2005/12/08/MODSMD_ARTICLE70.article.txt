## Women fall in Super Regional Card can't solve Vols' top pitcher, Abbott; drop series, 2-0, at home By ELIZABETH AGUILAR MANAGING EDITOR

Lauren Lappin's disappointment at Stanford's elimina
tion from this year's NCAA softball tournament was evi
dent during the post-game press conference. With her
voice breaking at times, the Stanford junior shortstop tried
to explain what happened in the No. 5 Cardinal's 6-0 loss to
No. 11 Tennessee.
"It was definitely frustrating today because we could not
catch a break," Lappin said, struggling to hold back tears." We
were hitting the ball well but to players. As my Dad would say,
the softball gods were not on our side this weekend."
Almost anyone present at Boyd and Jill Smith Family
Stadium during the third inning of Saturday's game would
agree.The Cardinal's potent lineup, a force throughout the
season, was shutout for seven innings by the Lady Vols'
Monica Abbott (47-7).
The typically dominant pitching tandem of freshman
Becky McCullough and junior Laura Severson was
touched for nine hits, five which came in the third. But the
Cardinal (43-16) duo only gave up three earned runs dur
ing the entire game, and Stanford's loss came down to er
rors and missed opportunities.
"I respect and care for Stanford's student-athletes, and
it seems like a lot of things went our way today," Tennessee
head coach Ralph Weekly said. "Monica pitched outs, and
we got the key hits."
The Lady Vols (64-13) had reached base once prior to
the third inning, on a hit and then on an error by freshman
first baseman Erin Howe, but they failed to score. Sarah
Fekete led off the five-run rally in the third. Two singles
later, Tennessee scored the first run of the game with a
bouncer to centerfield. That prompted Stanford head
coach John Rittman to pull McCullough, and Severson
pitched the rest of the game in relief.
Tennessee's next hitter, (Catherine Card, hit the ball
through Severson's legs to load the bases and from then on.
things began to unravel for the Cardinal. Freshman second
baseman Tricia Aggabao couldn't snag a line drive but
picked it up and fired to Lappin who was covering second
for what was an apparent force out. But the runner was
ruled safe, and Lappin was given an error for stepping off
the bag.
"This game was not indicative of our defense," Rittman
said. "I believe we were one of the best defensive teams in
the Pac-10. A couple of things factored into this today. You
can't give a good team outs."
Severson struck out the next batter, but Kenora Posey
reached first when 1 lowe was unable to handle Aggabao's
throw.Tennessee extended the 3-0 lead with a two-run sin
gle to center.
"We had got runners on before and didn't hit them in,"
said Lindsay Schutzler, who went 2-for-4."When the inning
came around we did get the hits and breaks we needed.
Everyone came through ... the pinch hitters were getting
