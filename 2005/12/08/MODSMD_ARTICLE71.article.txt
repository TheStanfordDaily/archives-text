# Mich. State ends title drive at Elite Eight
## Turnovers plague Cardinal in frustrating 76-69 defeat 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
ITianks to senior Susan King Borchardt's lock
down defense, Michigan State's Lindsay Bowen only
scored four points. Unfortunately, they might have
been the most important four of the game. Her
jumper in the lane with 22.8 seconds remaining ex
tended the Spartans' lead to three points, and two free
throws iced a 76-69 victory over Stanford last night in
the Kansas City Regional final.
Stanford was denied its first trip to the Final Four
since 1997. as the Spartans' Kristin Haynie scored 20
points, pulled down seven rebounds and handed out
seven assists.
"It's about making runs and making big plays."
Haynie said. "Stanford did a great job tonight, re
sponding, you know, but we just responded better."
Turnovers plagued the Cardinal offense in the first
half, as Stanford gave the ball away eight times before
halftime in contrast to Michigan State's two
turnovers. The result? A 28-28 tie at intermission de
spite the Cardinal's out-shooting the Spartans, 46.2 to
31.4 percent.
The Spartans virtually flew out of the locker room,
piloted by Haynie. Fresh off a triple-double in the Re
gional Semifinal against Vanderbilt, Haynie amassed
an incredible 18 points in the first 22 minutes of play.
"At halftime, we felt that we weren't really playing
our best basketball," senior Kelley Suminski said.
"We thought. We have 20 more minutes to break
open this game and show how we can play, and unfor
tunately that didn't happen.'"
A 15-2 Stanford run tied the game with 7:06 re
maining. The energy, the momentum, the game, was
seemingly Stanford's.
In the end, however, there was too much Haynie
and junior Liz Shimek. Shimek collected a double
double with game highs in points (24) and rebounds
(10). Big baskets down the stretch kept Stanford at
bay. and her four offensive boards were as many as
the entire Cardinal team grabbed.
A three-point play by freshman Candice Wiggins
with 43.6 seconds pulled the Cardinal to within a
point, but it wasn't enough.
"I was really proud of the way we came back,"Van-
Derveer said. "We made some really good adjust
ments, we hit some big baskets, and unfortunately we
didn't make some stops down the stretch when we
needed to."
Michigan's State's victory sends them to their first
Final Four, where they will take on Tennessee.
