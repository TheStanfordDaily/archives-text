# MEN'S GOLF
## Card debut in NCAA tourney NCAA Championship a first for entire Stanford squad 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This is uncharted territory.
For the past three years, June has been a time
of rest for the Stanford men's golf team. A time to
wonder what went wrong and how the next year
will tell a different story. June, the month when
the best teams in the country play for the NCAA
Championship, has been a Cardinal-free zone â€”
until now.
With contributions from all five starters at the
NCAA West Regional two weeks ago, Stanford
took advantage of its home-course advantage to
advance to its first NCAA Championship since
the 2000-2001 season. The downside? Coach
Conrad Ray's lineup will tee off in today's open
ing round with about as much championship ex
perience as the guy serving drinks at the 19th hole.
Nonetheless, as this young Cardinal team sails
into unknown waters, it will benefit, as they have
all year, from the veteran savvy of senior leaders
Pat Phillips and Kevin Blue. Playing their final
collegiate tournament, the two have competed in
a combined 69 events over four years to get to
this, their first shot at a national title.
Maturing under the leadership of Stanford
greats like Phil Rowe and Jim Seki during their
freshman and sophomore years, Phillips and
Blue have grabbed the reins this season, helping
Ray in his rookie season to guide Stanford to an
unexpected championship birth. This week's
lineup includes a freshman (Rob Grube) and two
sophomores (Zack Miller and Matt Savage) in
addition to Blue and Phillips. As Stanford joins
the last 30 teams playing competitive golf this
year, the mixture of youth and experience seems
to be the perfect recipe for success.

Stanford's seniors couldn't have come to the
Farm from more disparate backgrounds. A
Southern boy, Phillips arrived from Athens, Ga.,
just a few hours' drive from the sacred golf
grounds of the Augusta National Golf Gub. Blue,
on the other had, was a NAFTA import from
Toronto, in Canada's Ontario province.
Nonetheless, the two have united for four
years in pursuit of a common goal, amassing 14
top-25 finishes between them. Despite the fact
that neither has claimed an individual tourna
ment title, there is no doubt about the contribu
tion that each has made on a weekly basis or the
void they will leave behind when Saturday's final
round signals an end to a pair of solid careers.
But don't start the athletic eulogies just yet. As
you may have heard v for the first time in a while,
there's still some golf left to play.
The 108 th NCAA Championship takes place
at the Caves Valley Golf Club in Owings Mills,
Md.The par-70 7,129-yard beast is no stranger to
big events (it hosted the U.S. Senior Open in
2002) and should provide ample challenge for
the country's best college players.
"We need to have fun and remain positive,"
Phillips said. "Caves Valley is a long, challenging
golf course, so patience is a key. Par is a great
score on any hole."
Despite the pleasant weather conditions pre
dicted for the duration of the tournament, it will
likely be a week of high scores, where the team
that manages to maintain its composure on a bru
tal layout will be rewarded with a title.
The four-day event will begin with one round
per day today, tomorrow and Friday, followed by
a narrowing of the 30-team field to the top 15 be
fore Saturday's final 18 holes.
Amidst the nation's top-ranked teams, Stan
ford will once again benefit from an atmosphere
of low expectations after unexpectedly working

Then-freshman Rob Grube led the team to its first NCAA
Championship bid since 2001 .
its way into the year's final field. At the
West Regional, the Cardinal played a
relaxed three rounds that propelled
them all the way to Maryland. This
week, they will see if the magic can last
for just 72 more holes.

"We have all played at a high level
before, plus we've been preparing for
this tournament all year," Phillips said.
"Our goal all season long has been to
qualify for Nationals and play well at
Nationals."
National championship? Winner
take-all? These are uncharted waters.
Four days will tell whether Stanford
can sail to the ultimate destination.
