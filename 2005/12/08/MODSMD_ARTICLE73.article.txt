## Cardinal lose title game heartbreaker UCLA finishes season off undefeated 
### WES MATEO STAFF WRITER 
Going into this weekend's NCAA
Championship, the Stanford women's
water polo team knew that strong
play on the defensive end would be
critical to its success. Having limited
opponents to an average of 4.30 goals
per game over the course of the regu
lar season, the Cardinal entered the
tournament as one of the premier de
fensive teams in the nation.
With the NCAA title at stake, the
Stanford defense lived up to its repu
tation and delivered three of its finest
performances of the season. Though
each performance was more dramat
ic and more impressive than the last,
it wasn't enough to carry the Cardinal
to their first national title since 2001.
After inspired victories over
Michigan and Southern California,
the Cardinal couldn't knock off unde
feated UCLA in the title game despite
holding the Bruins to a mere three
goals in a heart-wrenching 3-2 loss.
Sophomore goalie Meridith Mc-
Coll posted eight saves to keep the

Cardinal in the game and would have
had more had it not been for the Stan
ford field defense's stifling coverage.
"Any time you can hold a team
with four Olympians to three goals
it's impressive," McColl said.
The Cardinal had the opportuni
ty to tie the game on a power-play in
the final seconds of regulation, hut a
UCLA interception crushed all
Stanford hopes fora comeback.
Still. Stanford's march to the title
game was impressive.
The Cardinal opened their week
end against tournament-host Michi
gan on Friday afternoon with a 7-2
win. After converting two power
plays early on, senior captain Han
nah Luber's first tally of the day gave
the Cardinal a decisive 3-0 lead
going into the half.
Despite being forced to defend
the six-on-five advantage 10 times
over the course of the game, the Car
dinal defense dominated the Michi
gan attack and surrendered only two
second-half goals. Luber completed a
hat-trick at 4:13 in the fourth period.
