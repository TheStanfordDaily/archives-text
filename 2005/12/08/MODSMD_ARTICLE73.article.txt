## Cardinal lose title game heartbreaker UCLA finishes season off undefeated 
### WES MATEO STAFF WRITER 
Going into this weekend's NCAA
Championship, the Stanford women's
water polo team knew that strong
play on the defensive end would be
critical to its success. Having limited
opponents to an average of 4.30 goals
per game over the course of the regu
lar season, the Cardinal entered the
tournament as one of the premier de
fensive teams in the nation.
With the NCAA title at stake, the
Stanford defense lived up to its repu
tation and delivered three of its finest
performances of the season. Though
each performance was more dramat
ic and more impressive than the last,
it wasn't enough to carry the Cardinal
to their first national title since 2001.
After inspired victories over
Michigan and Southern California,
the Cardinal couldn't knock off unde
feated UCLA in the title game despite
holding the Bruins to a mere three
goals in a heart-wrenching 3-2 loss.
Sophomore goalie Meridith Mc-
Coll posted eight saves to keep the

Cardinal in the game and would have
had more had it not been for the Stan
ford field defense's stifling coverage.
"Any time you can hold a team
with four Olympians to three goals
it's impressive," McColl said.
The Cardinal had the opportuni
ty to tie the game on a power-play in
the final seconds of regulation, hut a
UCLA interception crushed all
Stanford hopes fora comeback.
Still. Stanford's march to the title
game was impressive.
The Cardinal opened their week
end against tournament-host Michi
gan on Friday afternoon with a 7-2
win. After converting two power
plays early on, senior captain Han
nah Luber's first tally of the day gave
the Cardinal a decisive 3-0 lead
going into the half.
Despite being forced to defend
the six-on-five advantage 10 times
over the course of the game, the Car
dinal defense dominated the Michi
gan attack and surrendered only two
second-half goals. Luber completed a
hat-trick at 4:13 in the fourth period.

nia. Two weeks ago, the Cardinal
pulled off an upset of the No. 2
Women of Troy at the Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation tournament
in commanding fashion. With the
memory of that stunning upset fresh
in their minds, the Cardinal were
eager to repeat their effort.
Stanford fell behind early, but the

Cardinal didn't alter their game
plans or defensive strategies.
At 2:28 junior Laurel Champion
found junior captain Scotti Shafer open
in the middle of the pool fora shot that
brought the Cardinal back within one.
After the Women of Troy re
gained a two-goal advantage in the
second period, the Cardinal defense
tightened up and shutdown the USC
attack for the remainder of the half.
At 5:11 in the third, Hansen sent a
powerful skip shot into the left-hand
side of the cage to tie the score. The
Cardinal surge continued two min

utes later when junior Nancy El-
Sakkary fired a shot toward the low
right corner of the net. The ball de
flected off USC goalie Sarah Mix's
hand and bobbed across the line,
bringing the Stanford bench and fans
to their feet with a roar.
With less than four minutes to play,
Luber brought the Cardinal closer to
the championship match with her fifth
goal in two days. Assisted by Hewko
and Shafer. Luber managed to fake
Mix out of position and sent a soft lob
into the right of the cage to stretch the
Cardinal's lead to two.
After USC pulled to within one
and with the clock showing 20 sec
onds, Hewko was ejected, giving the
Women of Troy a six-on-five with a
chance to force overtime. For per
haps the tensest 15 seconds of the
season, the Cardinal worked to keep
a hand in the face of every shooter.

Finally, Hayes took a pass at the low
right wing and pump faked twice be
fore firing off her last desperate
shot. The ball seemed destined for
the back of the net before McColl's
arm shot up and deflected it off the
crossbar to clinch the victory.
The win avenged the Women of
Troy's undefeated championship
campaign a year ago and despite their
ultimate loss to UCLA in the final, the
Stanford women can look back on
their tournament effort and see how
much they proved. Were it not fora re
structured tournament format that in
creased the NCAA championship
field from four teams to eight, the Car
dinal would not have even had the op
portunity to play for the title.
Instead, they finished as the tour
nament's runner-ups.

nia. Two weeks ago, the Cardinal
pulled off an upset of the No. 2
Women of Troy at the Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation tournament
in commanding fashion. With the
memory of that stunning upset fresh
in their minds, the Cardinal were
eager to repeat their effort.
Stanford fell behind early, but the

Cardinal didn't alter their game
plans or defensive strategies.
At 2:28 junior Laurel Champion
found junior captain Scotti Shafer open
in the middle of the pool fora shot that
brought the Cardinal back within one.
After the Women of Troy re
gained a two-goal advantage in the
second period, the Cardinal defense
tightened up and shutdown the USC
attack for the remainder of the half.
At 5:11 in the third, Hansen sent a
powerful skip shot into the left-hand
side of the cage to tie the score. The
Cardinal surge continued two min

utes later when junior Nancy El-
Sakkary fired a shot toward the low
right corner of the net. The ball de
flected off USC goalie Sarah Mix's
hand and bobbed across the line,
bringing the Stanford bench and fans
to their feet with a roar.
With less than four minutes to play,
Luber brought the Cardinal closer to
the championship match with her fifth
goal in two days. Assisted by Hewko
and Shafer. Luber managed to fake
Mix out of position and sent a soft lob
into the right of the cage to stretch the
Cardinal's lead to two.
After USC pulled to within one
and with the clock showing 20 sec
onds, Hewko was ejected, giving the
Women of Troy a six-on-five with a
chance to force overtime. For per
haps the tensest 15 seconds of the
season, the Cardinal worked to keep
a hand in the face of every shooter.

Finally, Hayes took a pass at the low
right wing and pump faked twice be
fore firing off her last desperate
shot. The ball seemed destined for
the back of the net before McColl's
arm shot up and deflected it off the
crossbar to clinch the victory.
The win avenged the Women of
Troy's undefeated championship
campaign a year ago and despite their
ultimate loss to UCLA in the final, the
Stanford women can look back on
their tournament effort and see how
much they proved. Were it not fora re
structured tournament format that in
creased the NCAA championship
field from four teams to eight, the Car
dinal would not have even had the op
portunity to play for the title.
Instead, they finished as the tour
nament's runner-ups.

Going into this weekend's NCAA
Championship, the Stanford women's
water polo team knew that strong
play on the defensive end would be
critical to its success. Having limited
opponents to an average of 4.30 goals
per game over the course of the regu
lar season, the Cardinal entered the
tournament as one of the premier de
fensive teams in the nation.
With the NCAA title at stake, the
Stanford defense lived up to its repu
tation and delivered three of its finest
performances of the season. Though
each performance was more dramat
ic and more impressive than the last,
it wasn't enough to carry the Cardinal
to their first national title since 2001.
After inspired victories over
Michigan and Southern California,
the Cardinal couldn't knock off unde
feated UCLA in the title game despite
holding the Bruins to a mere three
goals in a heart-wrenching 3-2 loss.
Sophomore goalie Meridith Mc-
Coll posted eight saves to keep the

Cardinal in the game and would have
had more had it not been for the Stan
ford field defense's stifling coverage.
"Any time you can hold a team
with four Olympians to three goals
it's impressive," McColl said.
The Cardinal had the opportuni
ty to tie the game on a power-play in
the final seconds of regulation, hut a
UCLA interception crushed all
Stanford hopes fora comeback.
Still. Stanford's march to the title
game was impressive.
The Cardinal opened their week
end against tournament-host Michi
gan on Friday afternoon with a 7-2
win. After converting two power
plays early on, senior captain Han
nah Luber's first tally of the day gave
the Cardinal a decisive 3-0 lead
going into the half.
Despite being forced to defend
the six-on-five advantage 10 times
over the course of the game, the Car
dinal defense dominated the Michi
gan attack and surrendered only two
second-half goals. Luber completed a
hat-trick at 4:13 in the fourth period.
