# WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
## Card ready for prime time Squad heads to Utah for highly anticipated competition 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Think basketball is bigger than gymnastics?
Not in Utah.
Approximately 14,000 pairs of eyes will
watch the No. 28 Stanford women's gymnastics
team (2-4, 2-3 Pacific-10 Conference) march
into the Huntsman Center tomorrow night to
face No. 3 Utah, No. 6 Florida and No. 52 Cali
fornia.
That's almost double the number of people
that will pack Maples Pavilion to watch the
Stanford men's basketball game tonight. And
instead of a halftime show, they have fireworks.
Stanford will be competing not only in front
of the largest crowd in collegiate gymnastics, but
also under 10 national championship banners. If
there were banners for the most All-American
honors in gymnastics or for the longest regular
season winning streak at home in any NCAA
sport, those would be hanging from the rafters
as well. (For those keeping score at home, that
would be 244 All-American honors and a 23-
year long streak from 1979 to 2002.)
While Utah has qualified for the NCAA
Championships every year since its inception in
1982, Stanford has only appeared seven times.
The Utes are on a 23-year qualifying streak
while the Cardinal are on a four-year streak.
Any streak for the Cardinal, however, is con
siderable improvement in the eyes of assistant
coach Larissa Fontaine, who joined Stanford's
program as a gymnast in 1996 — a time when
Stanford had garnered only three All-American
honors and two appearances at Nationals.
An 1 lth-place finisher at the Olympic trials
in 1996 and a six-year member of the U.S senior
national team. Fontaine was one of the first big
name gymnasts to come to the Farm. While
Fontaine said academics, not gymnastics, at
tracted her to Stanford, she won vault at the
NCAA Championships in 1998 and remains the
team's first and only individual event champion.
Over her nine years as both a gymnast and a
coach, Fontaine has watched Stanford's pro
gram grow from a small team struggling to
make Nationals to a force that even the Utes
deem formidable. Last year, Stanford finished
third at the NCAAs compared to a seventh
place finish by Utah.
Tomorrow night will be somewhat of a re
peat performance of last year's Championships
with three of the six teams competing — Utah,
Florida and Stanford. Without the help of its
five graduated seniors, however, Stanford will
be fighting on an uphill battle.
"Our program is definitely growing and I
believe that someday it will be as big as Utah's,"
Fontaine said. "But right now, we're still young
as far as history goes."
Fontaine remembers competing in a half

full Burnham Pavilion that may have been
three quarters full on the good nights. Average
attendance in 1996 was 630, just 20 percent of
the 3,000-person crowd that came to watch
Stanford take on UCLA at Maples Pavilion
three weeks ago.
Even the team's facility has grown. A
$220,000 renovation of the gym at Ford Center
was completed this year. Designed by Fontaine
and graduated senior Caroline Fleurer as part
of an engineering project, the renovation in
cludes a new set of bars, a foam pit to practice
dismounts, new carpeting, a tumble track, Stan
ford gymnastics lettering on the walls and a
glass etching of the team's 47 All-American
awards — not quite 244, but better than three.
The biggest change Fontaine said she has
witnessed, however, has been an increase in the
caliber of gymnastics — not just at Stanford,
but nationwide. When Fontaine came to the
Farm in 1996, four of the seven members of the
gold-winning Olympic team (gymnastics fans
know them as the Magnificent Seven) had
signed letters of intent to compete in college,
but none of them followed through.
This year, three Olympians are competing as
freshmen in college — Courtney Kupets on
Georgia's team, Tasha Schwikert on UCLA's
team and Terin Humphrey on the No. 7 Alaba
ma team, which will be taking on the Cardinal
Sunday at Maples. Stanford boasts the fourth
and 10th place finishers at Olympic trials, fresh
men Tabitha Yim and Liz Tricase, both recruit
ed by Fontaine.
The rise in competitive caliber started with
the help of gymnasts like Fontaine who saw col
lege gymnastics as an opportunity fora scholar
ship and a way to enjoy the team aspect of an in
dividual sport. As more gymnasts like Fontaine
joined the ranks, the level of gymnastics began
to rise and then snowballed as more and more
top gymnasts became involved.
"Gymnastics is a really unique sport since
you usually go to the Olympics in high school,"
Fontaine said. "So girls didn't see college gym
nastics as really competitive...that has changed
as the caliber has improved, and now girls see
college gymnastics as a competitive place
where they can improve rather than just main
tain their old skills.
"For most gymnasts today, college gymnas
tics is the dream you end up with.The Olympics
is nice, but you realize that it is only six people
every four years."
Despite the changes and growth in Stan
ford's program and collegiate gymnastics in
general, Fontaine said she still sees plenty of
similarities between today's team and her own.
"Sometimes when I'm coaching vault, I look
down the runway and see the girls standing
around the chalk box talking," Fontaine said. "I
have the exact same picture in my mind of my
class standing around the chalk box, but now it
is different people. It's really neat to see the op
portunity exist for more people to share that
connection with the program."
