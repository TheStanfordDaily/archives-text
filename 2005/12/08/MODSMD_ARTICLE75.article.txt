# Basketball makes first-round exit
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
In the second half of its first-round
NCAA Tournament game on March 18,
Stanford lost its touch and head coach
Trent Johnson lost his cool. In the bitter
end, the eighth-seeded Cardinal lost the
game, 93-70, to ninth-seeded Mississippi
State. But they didn't lose their perspec
tive on a remarkable season few imagined
would culminate in an 11th straight ap
pearance in the Big Dance.
The Bulldogs' inside-outside duo of
seniors Lawrence Roberts and Winsome
Frazier helped turn a 12-point first-half
deficit into a rout at the Charlotte Colise
um, as Stanford headed home after its
only loss in the first round in the last 13
years. Afterward, a disappointed Cardinal
locker room made it clear that the set
back, as admittedly embarrassing as it was.
would not overshadow the resolve the
team showed throughout the season.
"1 think we have a lot to be proud of
this year," junior Matt Haryasz said, with
the emotional toll of a trying campaign ev

ident in his voice. "There's not a team in
the country that had to face as many ob
stacles and overcome as much as we did.
People were talking about us not making
any tournament and making the NCAA
Tournament was a joke.
"Of course we wanted to win and we
didn't, but 1 don't think that takes away
from how hard these guys fought and the
character that everyone on the team
showed...We went through a lot."
For 15 minutes on March 18, it ap
peared that fight would carry outmanned
Stanford, whose leading scorer Dan
Grunfeld was at home with a torn ACL, to
a second-round date with Duke. When
senior center Rob Little headed to the
bench upon picking up his second foul
after scoring the Cardinal's first eight
points less than five minutes into the
game, the rest of Stanford's offense got
going.
Junior point guards Chris Hernandez
and Jason Haas hit back-to-back long
range jumpers to spark an 11-2 spurt,
which included a turnaround jumper from
senior Nick Robinson and a three-point

play from Haryasz.
Two minutes later, freshman reserve
Peter Prowitt drained two free throws and
fellow freshman Taj Finger hit a soft
jumper to start a 16-5 Stanford run, as
Hernandez, who finished with a team
high 17 points, hit two free throws to put
the Cardinal ahead 36-25 with 6:55 to play
in the first half.
The Cardinal would lead by as many as
12, but the beginning of the end came
when the Bulldogs scored 14 straight
points to take the lead before Stanford
sophomore Fred Washington converted a
lay-up in the final seconds to bring Stan
ford to within 44-43 at the break.
"The first 15 minutes we played as well
as we've played all year long," Johnson said.
The next 25 were some of Stanford's
worst.
Washington tied the game with a free
throw 30 seconds into the second half, but
Frazier drilled back-to-back three-point
ers to give the Bulldogs a 50-44 lead they
would not relinquish. Frazier shot 6-for-8
from long range and finished with 20
points. His hot hand from the outside was
the perfect complement to the 23-point,
14-rebound performance from former
Southeastern Conference Player of the
Year Roberts, who helped the Bulldogs to
a 39-30 advantage on the boards.
Mississippi State's zone took Stanford
out of rhythm on offense, as Cardinal
jumpshots glanced off the iron, lay-ups
rattled around and out and the Bulldogs'
seven-foot senior Marcus Campbell tal
lied four blocks.
The Cardinal shot just 27 percent from
the field in the second half, including one
for-12 from three-point range, after shoot
ing 52 percent in the first 20 minutes. The
Bulldogs shot a blistering 56 percent after
the break, turning defensive rebounds
into easy transition baskets.
Stanford was within striking distance
trailing 57-53 with 13:54 to play, but the
Cardinal would not score again for nearly
six minutes. By that time, Mississippi State
had built a comfortable 16-point lead.
"It just started falling apart on us," said
Haryasz, who finished with 14 points and
nine rebounds. "You see it happening and
it's like sand slipping - you're trying to
grab it and you can't."
With 9:09 to play and Stanford down
12, Johnson was whistled fora technical
foul, but it failed to ignite his players.
"It all came at us at once anil kind of
buried us," Hernandez said. "We couldn't
get out of it."
While the Mississippi State cheering
section reveled in the Bulldogs' comeback,
the Stanford section's loudest cheers in the
final minutes were reserved for seniors
Little and Robinson (4 points,2 rebounds).
"Nobody wants to lose their last game by
20 and go out like that.but we don't have any
thing to hang our heads about," Little said.

the Stanford section's loudest cheers in the
final minutes were reserved for seniors
Little and Robinson (4 points,2 rebounds).

thing to hang our heads about," Little said.

Then -junior Chris Hernandez and the Cardinal were unable to hold an early lead in their
Mar. 18 NCAA Tournament opener, which they dropped to Mississippi State, 93-70.
In the second half of its first-round
NCAA Tournament game on March 18,
Stanford lost its touch and head coach
Trent Johnson lost his cool. In the bitter
end, the eighth-seeded Cardinal lost the
game, 93-70, to ninth-seeded Mississippi
State. But they didn't lose their perspec
tive on a remarkable season few imagined
would culminate in an 11th straight ap
pearance in the Big Dance.
The Bulldogs' inside-outside duo of
seniors Lawrence Roberts and Winsome
Frazier helped turn a 12-point first-half
deficit into a rout at the Charlotte Colise
um, as Stanford headed home after its
only loss in the first round in the last 13
years. Afterward, a disappointed Cardinal
locker room made it clear that the set
back, as admittedly embarrassing as it was.
would not overshadow the resolve the
team showed throughout the season.
"1 think we have a lot to be proud of
this year," junior Matt Haryasz said, with
the emotional toll of a trying campaign ev

ident in his voice. "There's not a team in
the country that had to face as many ob
stacles and overcome as much as we did.
People were talking about us not making
any tournament and making the NCAA
Tournament was a joke.
"Of course we wanted to win and we
didn't, but 1 don't think that takes away
from how hard these guys fought and the
character that everyone on the team
showed...We went through a lot."
For 15 minutes on March 18, it ap
peared that fight would carry outmanned
Stanford, whose leading scorer Dan
Grunfeld was at home with a torn ACL, to
a second-round date with Duke. When
senior center Rob Little headed to the
bench upon picking up his second foul
after scoring the Cardinal's first eight
points less than five minutes into the
game, the rest of Stanford's offense got
going.
Junior point guards Chris Hernandez
and Jason Haas hit back-to-back long
range jumpers to spark an 11-2 spurt,
which included a turnaround jumper from
senior Nick Robinson and a three-point

play from Haryasz.
Two minutes later, freshman reserve
Peter Prowitt drained two free throws and
fellow freshman Taj Finger hit a soft
jumper to start a 16-5 Stanford run, as
Hernandez, who finished with a team
high 17 points, hit two free throws to put
the Cardinal ahead 36-25 with 6:55 to play
in the first half.
The Cardinal would lead by as many as
12, but the beginning of the end came
when the Bulldogs scored 14 straight
points to take the lead before Stanford
sophomore Fred Washington converted a
lay-up in the final seconds to bring Stan
ford to within 44-43 at the break.
"The first 15 minutes we played as well
as we've played all year long," Johnson said.
The next 25 were some of Stanford's
worst.
Washington tied the game with a free
throw 30 seconds into the second half, but
Frazier drilled back-to-back three-point
ers to give the Bulldogs a 50-44 lead they
would not relinquish. Frazier shot 6-for-8
from long range and finished with 20
points. His hot hand from the outside was
the perfect complement to the 23-point,
14-rebound performance from former
Southeastern Conference Player of the
Year Roberts, who helped the Bulldogs to
a 39-30 advantage on the boards.
Mississippi State's zone took Stanford
out of rhythm on offense, as Cardinal
jumpshots glanced off the iron, lay-ups
rattled around and out and the Bulldogs'
seven-foot senior Marcus Campbell tal
lied four blocks.
The Cardinal shot just 27 percent from
the field in the second half, including one
for-12 from three-point range, after shoot
ing 52 percent in the first 20 minutes. The
Bulldogs shot a blistering 56 percent after
the break, turning defensive rebounds
into easy transition baskets.
Stanford was within striking distance
trailing 57-53 with 13:54 to play, but the
Cardinal would not score again for nearly
six minutes. By that time, Mississippi State
had built a comfortable 16-point lead.
"It just started falling apart on us," said
Haryasz, who finished with 14 points and
nine rebounds. "You see it happening and
it's like sand slipping - you're trying to
grab it and you can't."
With 9:09 to play and Stanford down
12, Johnson was whistled fora technical
foul, but it failed to ignite his players.
"It all came at us at once anil kind of
buried us," Hernandez said. "We couldn't
get out of it."
