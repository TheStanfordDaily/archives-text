## Judaism: some say it's not just for Jews anymore 
### SAM TANZER INTERMISSION DEFECTOR 
You know those reporters who live
on the streets fora week so they can
write more empatheticallv about the
experience of homelessness? Well,
that's kind of what I did for Intermis
sion's investigation of religion ... ex
cept instead of becoming homeless, I
decided to give Judaism a try (not to
imply any connection between Ju
daism and homelessness.)
Sadly, I didn't get all that far.
I decided to start by investigating
the options for Jewish life on campus.
Fortunately, the e-mail list for my
freshman dorm is regularly flooded
with notifications for upcoming Hillel
events and on-campus speakers that
address issues relevant to the Jewish
community at large.
I had never paid much attention to
the Hillel advertisements, but now I
missed them sorely. I wanted desper
ately to become involved in on-cam
pus Jewish life, but I didn't know who
to turn to.
So what does it mean to be a Jew?
No one I knew could answer this sim
ple question, so I decided to let
Google answer it for me.
Apparently, there are three
branches of Judaism: Orthodox, re
form, and conservative. These all
sounded vaguely familiar to me. En
couraged, I looked into the matter
more deeply. According to World Net.
Orthodox Jews are "Jews who strictly
observe the Mosaic Law as interpret
ed in the Talmud."
Hmm. That sounded a little con
fusing, so I tried Wikipedia, where I
discovered that orthodoxy is charac
terized by "strict adherence to Ha
lakha," which is apparently a code of
Jewish law.
This was no fun at all. The words
were big and foreign-sounding, and I
didn't feel I was getting any closer to
the heart of the matter.
So finally, I got back to basics. It
turns out I had forgotten some of the
basic facts of the religion. It also turns
out Judaism has quite a history.
Judaism is one of the world's first
monotheistic faiths, as well as one of
the oldest religions still practiced
today. The basic tenets of Judaism un
derlie Islam and Christianity, and
these tenets have helped shape the
Western world.
Every year, Passover reminds the
rest of America that Easter is some
where nearby and all I can think about
is how much I dread that crunching
sound of matzah nearby, invading my
sphere of leavened bread. This time
around. I'm kind of looking forward
to that awful, awful wine.
