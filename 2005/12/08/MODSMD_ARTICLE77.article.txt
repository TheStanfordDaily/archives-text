# Intermission defeats Daily
## 
### SCOOP SCOOPERSTEIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last night, Terry Schiavo wasn't the
only one who needed life support. The
Stanford Daily's players might have been
amply nourished and hvdrated yesterday
evening, but it was clear that someone had
"plugged the plug" on their sporting skills.
The end result? In an epic playdown
that will undoubtedly be remembered for
years to come. Intermission easily strode to
a 46-17 win over their fatigued and frustrat
ed journalistic peers.
"We just didn't bring the heat tonight,"
said a Daily senior staffer as he jogged off
the field shortly after the final seconds of
the game elapsed.
Toward the end of the second quarter, it
appeared that there might be an opportu
nity for The Daily to bounce back and start
knocking off some of Intermission's lead.
But that brief moment of hope was soon
lost on The Daily's players as Intermission
mounted another offensive impressive
campaign, bringing in a clean six points in a
mere 23 seconds.

All in all, the Intermission staff seemed
pleased with their impressive showing on
the field.
"It's hard to say we did anything but lay
waste to The Daily," exclaimed an Inter
mission writer. "We had tight defense, tight
offense, tightness all around."
"Except for our muscles," interjected
another writer. "We try to always stretch
beforehand."
Given last evening's wipeout, many In
termission staffers are now hopeful to pro
ceed onto the regional finals. If they are
able to nab a top-three spot there, the team
will then be able to proceed to the state
championships.
But members of the Intermission team
expressed their desire to go nothing but
"all the way."
"It's going to be a national affair," ex
plained an Intermission assistant editor.
"Or would that be a federal affair ... err,
aren't those kind of the same thing?"
