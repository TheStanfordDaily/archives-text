# Get a caffeine fix off-campus
## 
### RICARDO GILB INTERMISSION CAFFEINE FIEND 
Why study off campus, you ask?
Why not go to the CoHo, to the Lalß.
to Meyer, to Green, to all of the hal
lowed spots where such scholars as
Tiger Woods must have studied? Why
go out into the treacherous environ
ment of Palo Alto only to be lost in
anonymity?
For starters, there's my usual reason
— that you don't want anyone to know
exactly what it is you're studying, be
cause they would find out that the rea
son you are full of brilliant comments
during dinner is that you spend your
days reading books called. "The Com
plete Idiot's Guide to American Liter
ature" and "Classical Music for Dum
mies." (I don't even want to imagine
the shame, the terrible shame, of expo
sure! Thank God no one reads this
newspaper.)
Oh, but maybe you don't read such
smut. Maybe you read only fine works
of literature. Well, it's time you faced the
truth: reading those wonderful IHUM
books at Stanford marks you immedi
ately as a freshman, but off-campus,
reading those same books makes you ...
an intellectual!
So find a friend with a car, or find a
friend who happens to drive the Mar
guerite, or find a friend who has a heli
copter and who knows how to park it in
the middle of Palo Alto. We 11... I guess
you could just hop on your bike if faced
with no alternatives. And point your
wheels (whichever kind they may be)
towards the following places:
Happy Donuts. El Camino Real.

(650) 843-0658
It's not a coffee shop, but a donut
shop, with donuts the way they ought
to be — weighing about a pound each,
unlike those puffed fluff balls that
Krispy Kreme spits out. It isn't pretty,
but it's open 24 hours and serves plen
ty of coffee, meaning that this isn't so
much the place to relax on a Saturday
as a place to desperately attempt to
keep yourself awake with chocolate
Eclairs and caffeine at 5 a.m. when
your paper is due at 10 (that's a.m.),
and since it has free wireless access,
you can finish at nine 9:59 and still e
mail it in by the deadline.
Coupa Cafe, 538 Ramona St. (650) 322-
6872
The pun in the title is even cleverer than
you might think, since it actually comes
from the name of the owner, Jean Paul
Coupal. Where so many coffeehouses
have used a Latin American theme to
suggest some kind of Bohemian sympa
thy with the poor, Coupal, a native of
Venezuela, has used knowledge of his
own country to create a wonderfully el
egant hangout. Serving the finest of
Venezuelan chocolates and coffees is
only a bonus. There are plenty of outlets
lining the walls and free wireless access,
so that you can still check your e-mail
between paragraphs of reading.There is
even a Stanford logo in the fireplace's
tiles, just in case you were missing the
Stanford-feel of campus.
