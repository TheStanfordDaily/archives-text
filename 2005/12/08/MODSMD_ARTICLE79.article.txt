# Your roommate says 'Aide-moi!' Roxy helps

### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION SEX GODDESS, FRANCOPHILE 
Listen up men of Stanford, Roxy needs to let
you in on a little secret. I'm mainly writing this for

you, Mr. Socially Awkward. You know who you
are. You're the one whose roommate brings back
a new girl from a frat party every week, drunken-

ly stumbles into the room whispering "Shhhh, my
roommate's asleep" and then proceeds to have
sex three feet from your bed, in your cramped

one-room double. You immediately turn over and
fake like you're asleep, even though you're listen
ing to your roommate's latest score pant and

moan, as you pretend she's doing it for you.
Newsflash, boys: She is! There I said it, it's true.
Let Roxy fill you in on why she wants you to be
the better third of an Eiffel Tower.

For those of you who haven't been initiated
into the finer aspects of French "culture," let
Roxy illuminate you. The horny Frenchmen

who brought you the manage a trois developed
a position that pays homage to their national

icon. Mechanical engineers, you should under
stand this one. Two partners engage in doggy
style while the lazy bastard in front re-

ceives oral from the middle partner. The
two bookends of the trio create the top of
the "tower" by double high-fiving each
other over the middle person. Without

this, it's just a bridge. And voila!
Last weekend, after enjoying a night

of partying like a rockstar, I found my
self stumbling back with some guy

looking fora little dessert. Roxy

had no problem with that, except
for the fact his dessert was little.

and his ocean had no motion.
The only thing that kept me

wet was the fantasy that kept
running through my head. I

kept dreaming that his

roommate would jump
down from his loft, tell

him to step aside and save this night for all three of

us. But no. He didn't make a sound. He didn't even
roll oven no matter how loudlv I moaned. "Ohhh,

ohhhhhhh, mmmmmmmmmmmmm!" Nothing.
Silence. Boys, the ladies can only drop so many
I hints. "Hey Stud, we need a third" is a little for
' ward, even for Roxy.

Now you're thinking, "But Roxy, you're
with my roommate, wouldn't that be awkward?"
No, really, it wouldn't. Your roommate knows
you're home.The girl knows you're home. Every
one knows you're not asleep. If she's moaning so
loudly that even your neighbors need a cigarette,
then you'd better believe she's trying to get your
attention. There's certainly more than one way
to get ten inches of throbbing love around here,
and that's what friends are for.

So what's next? Stop stroking it and get out
of bed. Your roommate's not helping this girl
get off, and he's so drunk, he's lucky if he's get-

ting himself off. So push him out of the way, flip
her over doggy-style and save a little pride for
room 315. Don't worry, the girl's not gonna

leave your roommate hanging. Besides, this
was her idea, and this is an Eiffel Tower â€”
without the roommate, it's nothing. Go

ahead, give him the double high-five.
Roxy would say thanks, but she's busy.
Congratulate yourself, you just saved the
day.

Remember guys, Roxy is here to
help. Spring fever is catching and lust is

in the air. Your roommate is likely to
throw open the door again next Sat-

urday at 3 a.m., bringing with him
a soon-to-be-less-than-satisfied
i date. Now you know what to do

when she starts calling for back
up. Vive le France!
