### JOSH SMITH INTERMISSION LUCKIEST BASTARD EVER 
I am no "Star Wars" dork. Sure, I
used to have a "Star Wars" sleeping
bag I would take with me to swim
meets as a 6 and under, have seen the
Holy TVilogy an uncontainable num
ber of times and almost share the view
of an anonymous Post Secret writer
who "cried for Anakin Skywalker in
Star Wars Episode 111 but not for the
tsunami victims," but I am no "Star
Wars" dork. Still, when asked to partic
ipate in a press junket for the DVD re
lease of "Star Wars Episode III: Re
venge of the Sith" (to be released No
vember 1) at Skywalker Ranch in
Marin County for this noble publica
tion, I nearly wet myself. The following
are excerpts of a perfect day.
That's No Moon. It's a Space Station
Located alongside ambling Lucas
Valley Road (a name apparently unre
lated to the Ranch's proprietor), Sky
walker Ranch consists of 7,000 acres
upon which is situated a building for
Skywalker Sound, a ginormous ranch
house inhabited by George Lucas and

his family, vineyards and a manmade
lake, dubbed Lake Ewok, there to be
used by the Skywalker Ranch Fire
Dept. in case of an emergency.
Looking? Found Someone, You Have
After demoing the newest "Star
Wars" video game."Battlefront II."the
Lucas people trotted out the big guns
for Q and A, led by lan McDiarmid
(better known as The Emperor), who
looked a lot less like the Pope in real
life than he does on screen. McDi
armid's response to playing the epito
me of evil in four different "Star Wars"
movies is that his "relationship with
Satan is closer than even I hastened it
to be." He also continually scares little
kids in public, which is a shame fora
man with such a regal sounding Eng
lish accent. Overall, he treasured his
experience in the role: "It's easy to play
a hypocritical politician with a smirk
ing face. Gratifying too."
Frank Oz, the voice of Yoda (and
Miss Piggy), took the hot seat. After
outright refusing to give us a sample of
the Yoda voice ("I'm not that easy"),
the disappointingly average-voiced Oz
stated,"l love Jar-Jar. He was terrific."
I think he was a little off his A-game.

He was, however, heartened at the lack
of effort playing the newly digitized
Yoda required: "I do half a day, [the
animators] do a year. It's a delight."
Certainly the highlight of the day
was pretty-boy / evil incarnate Hayden
"I have my own action figure â€” how
cool is that?" Christensen; he just ex
uded a cool in his mismatched slacks
and trousers and mussed hair that was
very Bay Area chic. Christensen was
obviously enamored at finally becom
ing Darth Vader at the end of "Episode
III." On how he felt when finally be
coming Darth: "Great glee. It was or
gasmic." He also spoke of the physical
hardships he endured putting on the
Vader suit: "It was like wearing 20-
pound shoulder pads and high-heeled
shoes... Not that I practiced that way."
May the Force Be With You
In summation,my trek to Skywalk
er Ranch was dork paradise. So go and
get your copy of "Episode III" on
DVD on November 1; we here at the
Intermission want to ensure good rela
tions with the Lucas folk.

JOSH SMITH/The Stanford Daily
Josh Smith ponders life with Darth Vader as his father. The outlook is dreary, as Josh would like to keep his hand.
