# OH...
## If only Vegas was as cool as Vegoose 
### BETSY CONGDON INTERMISSION PHONE MAGICIAN 
I guess it was karma. We put out a
Worst Case Scenario: Survival Guide
Intermission on Friday and by Friday
night Caley and I were already living
our Worst Case Scenario: Vegas. When
we weren't rocking out to the bands or
singing along with "John Travolta" at
the Impersonators' Caf£, we were on
the phone frantically trying to rectify
whatever situation we had gotten our
selves into that time. Here is a glimpse at
our call log:
11:38 pm Friday Oct. 28: Caley calls
Howard Johnson to confirm a reserva
tion that she had jiist finished booking.
HOJO: What is your ten-digit confirma
tion number?
CALEY: 68663373
HOJO: That's only eight-digits. What is
your name ma'am?
CALEY: Caley Anderson. I just booked
a room at the Las Vegas Strip location.
HOJO: Ah, I have you. Your ten-digit
confirmation number is 68663373.
CALEY:That is the number I have. It is
only eight digits.
HOJO: Right.
11:30 p.m. Saturday Oct. 29: We met back
at the press trailer to find my backpack
(read computer, wallet, keys) are locked
in it. There is no one around but a securi
ty officer who is no help. Of course, the
numbers of the people who work in the
press trailer are on my computer. Caley
calls her mom to retrieve the numbers off
of webmail and we begin calling every
one we know at Big Hassle, the publicity
firm handling Vegoose.
BETSY: Calls Ken Weinstein ... no an
swer.
CALEY: Calls David Foster ... no an
swer.
BETSY: Calls Sophie Smith ... no an
swer. Fuck, we only have one more.
Maybe 1 should call Brendan and tell
him we are changing the plane tickets..
CALEY: Calls the last person on our
list: Steven Trachtenbroit...
STEVIE (editor's note: this is the nick
name that we now affectionately call
him around the office): Hello?
CALEY: HellothisisCaleyAnderson

STEVIE: Fuck, fuck, fuck-fuck — sorry
for the language.
CALEY: No, no I am there with you. If
no one can come tonight is it possible
for someone to come in tomorrow
morning?
STEVIE: If your flight is at seven a.m.,
we'll probably be going to bed at seven.
I just got back to my hotel and I am get
ting ready to go out and everyone else is
out... You sit tight and I will get back to
you. I'm sorry.
CALEY: No! We are so sorry. Thank
you so much.
Later he calls back. About midway
through the conversation he asks:
STEVIE: What publication are you
from Caley?
CALEY:.. .The Stanford Daily.
STEVIE: Ken Weinstein (head of Big
Hassle) wants to know if you had fun.
CALEY: It was ridiculously fun.
STEVIE: To someone in the back
ground: She says it was ridic.To Caley: 1
shortened that up for you.
We did finally get into the press trail
er (Thank you Steve!) to make it back
to the hotel for four hours of sleep
(Thank you daylight savings time) be
fore catching a taxi to the airport.
