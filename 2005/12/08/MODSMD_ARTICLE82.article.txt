# Intermission rocks out at the Vegoose Music Festival
## 
### CALEY ANDERSON INTERMISSION ROCK STAR 
About ten of us crowded together
on the far left side of the stage, nervous
ly checking our watches. Rve o'clock
had come and gone, and we were all
still standing on the wrong side of the
barrier. ITie large imposing security
guard wouldn't let us into the pit to set
up for The Shins' set,because the fellow
with the security pass who was sup
posed to get us in to take photos hadn't
arrived yet.
And then The Shins walked out
dressed as nuns, and the crowd went in
sane. "Shit!" screamed a particularly
tense photographer to my right. "They
won't let us in, and they're going to take
the costumes off after the first song and
we're all going to be fucked!" He ran up
to the fence and started frantically
snapping photos over the heads of the
fifteen or so rows of people in front of
us.
Finally, the man with the credentials
showed up, and the group of photogra
phers literally ran behind the barrier to
start shooting. The tension, however,
didn't cease, and when two band mem
bers took out oversized yardsticks and
starting dueling with them. Mr. Pushy-
Pants from before literally elbowed me
out of the way to "get his shot." All he

had to do was ask nicely.
But so is the life of a professional
concert photographer, and because
some Power-That-Be seems to love
me, I had the chance to join their ranks
last Saturday at the Vegoose Music
Festival.
After over ten years of attending
concerts and being one of the shortest
people in attendance (and therefore
unable to see anything), 1 finally found
a way to rectify the situation: be a press
photographer. For the first three songs
(or 15 minutes — whichever comes
first) you literally have front row visi
bility, without thousands of people
pushing forward and cutting off your
air supply.
The actual 15 minutes of shooting
were much more intense than I had an
ticipated. I thought since I wasn't actu
ally a photographer, nor was 1 trying to
sell my pictures on AP Wire, I could
enjoy the view and groove out to the
amazing music. Wrong, wrong and
more wrong.
Fifteen minutes disappears in a
snap. As soon as the music begins, you
just frantically start taking pictures, be
cause you quickly realize taking that
perfect, life-altering shot requires hun
dreds of other (blurry and terrible) pic
tures to be shot first. Being surrounded
by "real" photographers raises the

stakes; 1 didn't want to be outed as a
fraud within the first five minutes. Un
doubtedly I was asked, "What are you
shooting with?" and I glanced down at
my camera with what I hoped was a
thoughtful look and said, "Whatever
the photo department gave me."
Smooth, I know.
1 hadn't been paying close attention,
as I was trying not to break the camera
or trip over cords and fall flat on my
face, but almost all of the other photog
raphers (and reporters for that matter)
were older white men. For the first few
hours of the festival, I was the only fe
male photographer, and I was by far the
youngest. Eventually three other fe
male photographers showed up — one
even worked for Spin Magazine. Don't
worry; 1 held my own. Even though el
bowing was involved, for the rest of the
bands I stood my ground, proving even
20-year-olds in skirts and bright ma
genta tank tops can play with the big
boys. Or something like that.
Unfortunately, I don't think I'm tall
enough to be a professional photogra
pher; another common characteristic
of the older white male photographers
was blessed height. Maybe next time
I'll just wear heels.

The only thing scarier than this picture is that the head actually rotated.
