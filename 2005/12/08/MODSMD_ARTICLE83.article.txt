# Don't be caught in last season's eye-patch or you will walk the plank

### TAM VO INTERMISSION FASHIONABLE FIRST MATE 
Fashion often makes us want to walk the plank. Whether
you end up looking like a blind Ringling Brothers circus reject
or like you're ready to twirl your way into a ballet class led by
Jane Fonda,The Ship of Good Taste left Stanford a long time
ago. Unfortunately, we're still left with the Uggs-and
miniskirt-velour-tracksuit-loving landlubbers. Surrender now,
or floggings will continue until morale and style improve.
Ahoy, Arrrrrrgyles: Fishnets and striped tights in all colors
are a welcome addition to any aspiring crewmate's drawers.
Protect those bare legs from the cruel wind and rain this sea
son with a novel concept: socks! Pirates do NOT wear Rain
bow flip-flops during storms. For the spendthrift plunderer.
Target has striped knee-high socks for $3.99 a pair (and all the
fishnets you will ever need to catch your prey).
Pirates Booty is the best booty: Knickers, breeches,cutoffs,
culottes (for those snotty French pirates out there), whatever
you want to call them — they all make climbing rigging or out
of your wench's window so much easier. Black, polishable
boots with a snug fit and good traction are essential. Stilettos
will kill you before scurvy does. Remember that vertical
stripes make you look longer and leaner and that horizontal
stripes make you look wider and wider. And some of you do
not want to broaden that horizon.
Avast! Accessorize!: Maybe that lass in your English class
will finally pay attention to you if hobble in with a wooden pe
gleg. Ever consider the surefire conversation starter that is
the hook? For that added bling, clip on some huge gold hoop
earrings and throw on a few heavy clanking chains (medal
lions with secret treasure maps optional). Protect your grog
— an engraved hipflask is the new red cup. And don't go any
where without your cutlass, especially when in enemy waters.
Forget Victoria, here's Blackbeard's secret: Real pirates
wear tons of eyeliner. And mascara. And black eyeshadow.
Pirates are MOODY, remember? All they ever see is water,
water and water. Iggy Stardust was a landlocked pirate, he
just didn't know it. You're not better than David Bowie or
Johnny Depp.
Throw those flouncy miniskirts overboard. Put down those
black-frame nonprescription glasses and don an eyepatch —
embrace your inner buccaneer. Next time you feel compelled
to tuck your jeans into Uggs, remember this: Dead men tell no
tales, but fashion victims feed the whales.
