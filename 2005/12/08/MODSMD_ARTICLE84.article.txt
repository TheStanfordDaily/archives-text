# How to combat Hilary Duff?
## Go to your happy place, don't ever come out

and attempted to wave them during the open
ers. seemingly at random, looking like 2(),(KM)
spastic children going into insulin shock. I
couldn't catch the bands' names because as soon
as the lights dimmed and they said "We are ..."
the audience went completely fucking bonkers,
nearly deafening me.
With three minutes to go. the screens switched
from a pre-recorded unfunny "backstage live"
with Hil to a countdown with l/HX) second inter
vals. At 1:(X):(X) the estrogen and screaming was
too much for me. and I closed my eyes and es
caped to my happy place.
Hilary's show was forgettable as well. She
could mostly sing but she had no stage presence.
The girls in the audience would be happy to chant
Death to the Infidels' if she asked them to. But
she does not.
All of her songs were accompanied by painful-

My 10-year-old sister asked me to take her to
see Hilary Duff in concert, since I'm so much
cooler than our father. Why this mattered to her
I will never understand. The concert audience
was easily 90 percent female.The primary atten
dees were 10-to-14-year-old adolescent girls
chaperoned by their mothers, aunts and grand
mothers.
The concert had two openers. Both seemed
like they were there on the good graces of Hil's
band.The first sounded like Phil Collins covering
John Mayer. The audience didn't notice that this
band wasn't Hilary.They didn't even recognize it
as distinct from the subdued background music
in between sets.
The kids in the audience all had glow sticks

ly literal video footage or abstract lava visualiza
tions projected by a five-story light matrix behind
her, which would've made a pointillist weep with
joy. "I Am" is instead accompanied by video on
small screens off-stage, with the lyrics highlighted
sing-a-long style over a cloudscape. The chorus
encouraged "I am special/I am beautiful/I am
wonderful/And powerful/Unstoppable..." The
footage made me feel like I was at a cult initiation.
It was very repetitive and oddly soothing.
At this point, Hil stopped with all of the sensi
tive songs and got down to business: songs about
rocking and being awesome. I looked over at my
sister, who seemed disinterested by the whole af
fair, and decided that I was going to make up for
her lack of enthusiasm by doubling mine. I threw
my devil horns in the air and sang and felt. I real
ly feel, like Hil and I connected. We both con
firmed that "Girl. Can. Rock."

Write for Intermission. It's the most fun you'll ever have in a windowless room.
