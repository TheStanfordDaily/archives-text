# Gamers' find a haven at Nintendo

Nintendo and Me
As I stepped off the plane in Seattle,
the clear and sunny skies were just one
more sign that this would be a very spe
cial weekend for the gamer inside of
me. It was Nintendo College Media
Days, and I, along with some 30 other
college reporters were being flown in
from across the United States to take
part in a two-day journey through the
world of Nintendo. As 1 got in the cab to
my hotel situated in downtown Seattle,
I began to wonder what it was exactly
that Nintendo wanted to tell us. Just
what exactly is "the Nintendo experi
ence"? Thankfully, as my childhood
imagination once envisioned, Nintendo
is still the stuff of dreams.
The Place (and Tour)
Situated next to the headquarters of
Microsoft in Redmond, Nintendo's of
fices look just like so many other white
washed corporate buildings. The dark
double doors open onto a security
checkpoint desk. Sparsely placed vin
tage Nintendo dolls are the only sign of
the company's unique heritage. If we
hadn't had a tour guide, it would have
been hard to tell if we were even in the
right place.
But as we began to explore the two
buildings that comprise Nintendo, we
soon realized that things weren't as
they seemed.The walls of fan art sent in
by loyal followers, the strangely named
cubicle roads and conference rooms
and the occasional dimly-lit niches
filled with TVs and game systems were
definite signs of the attitude Nintendo
had with its employees. "Every cubicle
also has its own TV and Gamecube sys
tem," said Deanna Guay, our tour guide
and a 15-year veteran of consumer
service. After all the gaming freaks
(which was pretty much everyone on
the tour) had recovered from shock of
that news, Deanna led us to the "Histo
ry of Nintendo."
The feeling I got when I entered this
room was something akin to the amaze
ment the kids in "Willy Wonka" must
have felt when stepping into his candy
factory. Scattered everywhere were glass
cases filled with Nintendo merchandise
from all around the world.
Departure
Rain was starting to fall as I climbed
into the shuttle for the Seattle airport
and home. For me, the weekend had
been an enlightening experience. I left
with the impression that Nintendo is still
the great company I loved as a kid. and I
also gained a new appreciation for the
inner workings of the organization. I'm
glad to know that this giant won't be
going away any time soon.
