Judge drops charge but
2 allows money-laundering
allegations against DeLay

AUSTIN,Texas (AP) — Rep. Tom DeLay could
face a trial early next year now that a judge has re
fused to throw out money-laundering allegations
against the former House majority leader.
Judge Pat Priest dismissed a conspiracy charge
against DeLay in his ruling Monday, but with the
more serious charges still intact, the case heads
closer to trial — although other defense objections
remain to be heard.
DeLay's hopes of reclaiming his powerful posi
tion as House majority leader were dealt a blow by
the ruling. He had hoped to have the charges re
solved by the time Congress reconvened in late Jan
uary, so he could step back into his role as majority
leader. Although Monday's ruling was a partial vic
tory, DeLay cannot reclaim the post because he is
still under indictment.

During Europe trip
Rice says cruel
interrogation barred
KIEV, Ukraine (AP) — Secretary of State Con
doleezza Rice gave the Bush administration's most
comprehensive accounting yet of U.S. rules on
treatment of prisoners in the war on terrorism
Wednesday, but her assurances left loopholes for
practices that could be akin to torture.
Rice said cruel and degrading interrogation
methods are off limits for all U.S. personnel at
home and abroad. But she gave no examples of
banned practices, did not define the meaning of
cruelty or degradation, did not say if the rules
would apply to private contractors or foreign inter
rogators and made no mention of whether excep
tions would be allowed.

Former Sept. 11 panel:
A U.S. unprepared for next
terror attack
WASHINGTON (AP) —Time, money and ever
present terror threats have done little to close gaping
holes in the nation's security system, the former
Sept. 11 Commission said Monday in accusing the
government of failing to protect the country against
another attack.
The panel cited disjointed airplane passenger
screening methods, pork-barrel security funding and
other problems in saying the Bush administration and
Congress had not moved quickly enough to enact the
majority of its recommendations of July 2004.
"We're frustrated, all of us—frustrated at the lack
of urgency in addressing these various problems," said
Thomas Kean, a Republican and former New Jersey
governor who was chairman of the commission.
"We shouldn't need another wake-up call," he
said. "We believe that the terrorists will strike
again."

Air marshal kills man at
Miami airport after he
claims to have a bomb
MIAMI (AP) —An agitated passenger who
claimed to have a bomb in his backpack was shot and
killed by a federal air marshal Wednesday after he
bolted frantically from a jetliner that was boarding
for takeoff, officials said. No bomb was found.
It was the first time since the Sept. 11 attacks that
an air marshal had shot at anyone, Homeland Secu
rity Department spokesman Brian Doyle said.
According to a witness, the passenger ran down
the aisle of the Boeing 757, flailing his arms, while his
wife tried to explain that he was mentally ill and had
not taken his medication. Rigoberto Alpizar, a 44-
year-old US. citizen, was gunned down on a jetway
outside the American Airlines plane. Relatives said
he and his wife had been on a working vacation.
