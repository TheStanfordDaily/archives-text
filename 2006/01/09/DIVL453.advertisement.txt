Economics Department Course and
Curriculum Changes
Students who wish to take the "Neuroeconomics and the Neural Basis of Decision
Making" workshop should register for Psych 232; we are working to straighten out the
cross-listing in Economies.
Economics 124. "Contemporary Japanese Economy," has been moved from Winter to
Spring Quarter.
Next year (06/07) the Economics major will be updated; Economics I will expand to a 2-
course sequence. There will be a transition over the next few years when students will
have different course backgrounds. Students, who declare the major this year (05/06),
will fall under the old major requirements. Students who have completed the existing
Economics 1 at Stanford or the existing Economics 50 at Stanford this year (05/06) will
also be under the old major requirements. There will be a fuller description of the new
major, and the transition, on the Department's website this quarter.
