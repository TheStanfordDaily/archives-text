HISTORY 267J
TUESDAYS, 3:15-5:05 PM
This course will compare and contrast how both the United States
and Canada came to occupy the upper portions of western North
America. We will examine how the westering experience differed
in each country and how the West as a place, process, and idea all
became intertwined with national narratives and definitions of na
tional identity. There are numerous assumptions on both sides of the
border about these histories that we will explore in depth so as to
test historical reality versus the power of mythology about the West.
Indeed, many of these assumptions continue to influence how each
country views their own history and each other. Throughout this
course we will explore these and many other questions so as to gar
ner a greater understanding of both Canadian and American western
history, the challenges of comparative history, and the tenor of con
temporary U.S. - Canadian relations. For more information or a copy
of the syllabus, please contact the instructor, Dr. Lissa Wadewitz at
wadewitz@stanford.edu. 4-5 units.
