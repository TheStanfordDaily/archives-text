## Stanford students instruct English, absorb culture 
### JESSAMYN EDRA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Global communication is becoming increasingly
important to countries' people and development.
One organization that understands the importance of
this international dialogue is Learning Enterprises.
"Learning Enterprises is a non profit, non-gov
ernmental organization that provides college stu
dents with the opportunity to teach English abroad
fora summer in rural villages," says sophomore
Megan Hansen, who coordinates Stanford students'
involvement with the organization. She says that last
summer, between five alumni and 14 undergradu
ates from the Farm participated in a Learning Enter
prises program. Stanford has been involved with the
organization for roughly five years.
While student participants must pay their own
airfare. Learning Enterprises programs are other
wise free of charge, according to its Web site. The
towns in which volunteers teach pa> for their hous
ing and food. This sets it apart from other overseas
service programs. It is also completely run by stu
dents and past volunteers.
With teaching destinations including Indonesia,
China and Panama, volunteers have the chance to
explore the world. They live with host families and
teach free classes open to the community's children
for at least three hours a day, the Web site says.
The program claims to have a unique, creative
take on teaching. Rather than force-feed English to
students and demand "rote memorization," Learn
ing Enterprises strives to make a love of learning the
ultimate goal, according to the Web site. Among

other techniques, student teachers use games and a
seminar format in which everyone sits in a circle.
The results of these methods are rewarding,
Hansen says.
"I had little kids coming up saying. Teacher, we
hope you come back next year! I certainly want to
sign up!'" she says. "Regardless of what they remem
ber of the English, they want to learn more."
It is important to note that while the volunteers
teach only English, Learning Enterprises does not
value English over other languages. The emphasis,
instead, is on connecting people and sharing per
spectives.
"Communication is important with regards to
cross cultural exchange and broadening the hori
zons of these students," Hansen explains. "I know
teachers who would dedicate 10 minutes or so of
class to letting students ask questions about Ameri
ca."
While students learn about the United States in
class, volunteers learn about the country by living
with a host family.
"It's one thing to read about a country and a cul
ture, and quite another thing to actually sit down at
a dinner table with a Romanian family each night,
eating goulash and drinking grandma's palinka,"
says sophomore and former volunteer Nick Bena
vides, now the Southeastern European village proj
ect director.
Learning Enterprises programs are open to any
one who is at least 18 years old and has completed at
least one year of college. Prior formal teaching expe
rience is not required.Training includes two on-cam
pus days as well as in-country orientation.

"Volunteering for Learning Enterprises was ab
solutely terrific and I would highly recommend it to
anyone," Benavides says."lt's not the easiest thing to
do, however, and a sense of adventure and the abili
ty to improvise is a must."
Hansen offers a final thought: "While I was
shocked at the impact teaching English had on peo
ple. I was even more inspired by my students," she
says."The love of learning that Learning Enterpris
es engendered was beyond any other gift that could
be given."
Since Learning Enterprises is a free program,
raising enough money to continue offering this op
portunity is a challenge. Stanford participants or
ganize various fundraisers throughout the year, such
as the upcoming all-you-can-eat pancake breakfast.
The feast will be on Saturday, Jan. 14 at the Durand
House from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.
Interested in Learning Enterprises? Find out
more at an information session on Thursday. Jan. 19.
from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. in the Career Development
Centers first floor conference room. Hansen will
conduct a presentation about Learning Enterprises
and past volunteers will share stories about their ex
periences.

states that the organization's mission is "guided by
five principles: fostering creativity, using the English
language as a means of communication, cross cultur
