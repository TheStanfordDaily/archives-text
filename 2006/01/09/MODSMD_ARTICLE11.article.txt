# New d.school promotes adaptability problem-solving
## 
### SAGAR BAPAT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
What started as a scribbling on a paper
napkin at Peet's Coffee spurred the opening
of Stanford's new 1 lasso Plattner Institute of
Design, which opened Oct. 3,20()5. according
to the Stanford News Service. Renovations
to the Peterson Building are scheduled to be
completed in 2007.giving the Institute of De
sign its own 47.0(H) square foot home.
While some courses at the institute will be
open to undergraduates, the institute will
give Certificates of Design Thinking to "an
eclectic mix of graduate students spanning
the breadth of disciplines..." the Stanford
News Service reports.
Commonly referred to as the d.school. the
institute was largely funded by a $35 million
donation from Hasso Plattner, co-chief exec
utive officer of SAP, a business software
provider. Plattner told Business Week that he

wants the creation of this school to be a nodal
point fora new type of learning and innova
tion methodology that encourages interdisci
plinary collaboration.
"I started my career at IBM as an electri
cal engineer, and one of the things I learned
in the field is that you have to be broader
than you thought." Plattner says in an article
published Oct. 3, 2005 in Business Week on
line. "You have to work with people."
The d.school will encourage such collabora
tion by bringing computer scientists, engineers,
business students,anthropologists and students
from various other fields together to form
problem-solving teams. The issues they'll con
front are diverse, including finding ways to stop
drunk driving and building better, safer and en
vironmentally friendlier elementary schools.
Collaboration with groups from outside
the d.school is also taking place. Other inter
disciplinary programs on the Farm, such as
Stanford Biodesign, the Stanford Center for

Social Innovation and Alliance for Innova
tive Manufacturing are also lending manpow
er to make the d.school a success. And the
Plattner Institute encourages anyone in the
business sector — from large multinationals
to small startups — to join the d.school's
teaching, prototyping or research efforts.
In fact, according to Assistant Managing
Editor for Business Week Bruce Nussbaum,
the new design school will give future busi
ness leaders exactly the training they need to
succeed. Nussbaum writes in the Oct. 3 Busi
ness Week article, "There is a vast migration
going on in Corporate America today as
companies seek to hire more innovation
champions, design thinkers and researchers
who know how to get close to customers., the
new Stanford d.school may prove to be a
major training ground for future managers."
The institute will emphasize innovation as
both a methodology and process, not as a
function of creative impulses. Business Week

reports. According to the d.school's Web site,
the solutions to the problems they'll address
will be always "imperfect and ever-evolving,"
allowing for constant improvement and
adaptability as situations change.
Fellows at the d.school and professors
from other departments at Stanford com
prise the teaching staff at the institute.
"The fellows are all current or former
grad students," says Adam French, one of the
fellows. "We work with faculty to teach
courses, pursue our own design work and re
search and pursue specific projects that are
part of making the d.school come alive."
Over the next few years, the d.school will
offer an assortment of classes that will be
project-based and interdisciplinary in nature.
The topics will range from using design to
help children with autism to developing envi
ronmentally sustainable products.
Design collaboration and research is also
being done to help impoverished countries.

"Much of my past experience is in design
work for developing countries." French says.
"Over the summer. I traveled in Southeast Asia
(Bangladesh. India, Cambodia and Burma) re
searching projects fora course we are offering
this winter and spring called Entrepreneurial
Design for Extreme Affordability."
In the past, faculty and student teams col
laborated with the Light-up the World Foun
dation, an international humanitarian organi
zation connected to the University of Calgary,
developed cheap prototypes of LED-based
lighting for use in developing countries. The
lighting was bright enough to allow for read
ing and working but cost much less than con
ventional fuel-based lighting. Many students
involved in the class that created the LED
lamps field-tested the prototypes in India.
Many say they hope the new d.school will
pave the way for the future business and tech
nological leaders. For more information visit
