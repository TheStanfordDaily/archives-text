## Editorial Resolutions for a new year on the Farm 
### 
Happy New Year! The editorial board
has decided it's time for some good
old-fashioned new year's resolu
tions, tailored to the Stanford student. We
hope you all resolve to make the most of
your coming year at Stanford, whether you
are on your way out at Commencement
2006, or on your way to finally not being the
youngest on campus anymore when Sep
tember — and the Class of 2010 — arrives.
• Continue the altruism of 2005. The events
of last year showed us nature's frightening,
well, nature. And Stanford students re
sponded with great concern and generosity,
from founding the umbrella organization
Stanford Students for Relief in response to
the tsunami to welcoming students whose
home campuses were hit by Hurricane Kat
rina to spearheading a Kashmir earthquake
relief effort. While we sincerely hope that
2006 will not present the same type of cata
strophic disasters that spurred you to action
in 2005, we also hope that you will still give
of your time and money to any of the numer
ous worthy causes that exist.
• Take advantage of one of Stanford's myr
iad exceptional opportunities. It's so easy to
arrive at Stanford, overwhelmed by all the
possibilities, and remain contentedly en
trenched in your comfort zone without both
ering to profit from all that Stanford has to
offer. Choose one thing that you thought
sounded thrilling when you read Stanford's
prospectus and pursue it this year. Apply to
do research. Study abroad. Develop a per
sonal relationship with a professor. If you
need help thinking of ideas, consider the list
of 101 things to do before you graduate from
Stanford. Sure, some of the suggestions are
cheesy, but some are really valuable.
• Enroll in That Class. You know, the one
that looks really interesting, the one that
people who have taken it say is really re
warding... but that also has a ton of

reading/papers/problem sets/midterms and
a tough curve that might hurt your GPA.The
one you're scared to take. Defy the laidback
Stanford attitude fora quarter and embrace
the challenges of the course. Indulge your
competitive spirit and excel in the class. Dis
cover the work is actually quite manageable
and the professor's grading scheme reason
able. Live a little, academically.
• Sit with someone new at dinner. Upper
classmen are often guilty of socializing pri
marily within their draw group or team or
circle of friends, and are missing out on a
wide variety of contacts outside of these
cliques. Meals are a prime time to introduce
variety into your social routine. Sit at a dif
ferent table. Talk to someone you've seen
but never really met. Maybe even make a
new friend. Live a little, socially.
• Ask him/her out. Live a little, romantically.
• Thank the workers who cook and clean
for you. It's such a small,easy thing to do, but
one that is guaranteed to brighten their day.
We should all be very appreciative of every
thing they do for us. They make the absence
of Mom and Dad a little less noticeable.
• Venture off campus. There is a world be
yond the Stanford Bubble, and it's actually a
fun and exciting world. Have dinner in
downtown Palo Alto, home to numerous ex
cellent eateries all within easy walking dis
tance of each other. Make the most of your
proximity to one of the world's great cities,
and explore San Francisco's eclectic and
charming neighborhoods. Tutor students in
East Palo Alto and immerse yourself in a
cornucopia of nationalities and ethnicities.
Take a weekend and visit Yosemite National
Park. Napa Valley. Lake Tahoe, the Marin
Headlands, Monterey Peninsula — you are
fortunate enough to be on a campus sur
rounded by beautiful and famous regions:
resolve to see as much as you can while you
are at Stanford.
• Read The Daily.
