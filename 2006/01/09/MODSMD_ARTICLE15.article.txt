# Chuck Norris roundhouse kicked my heart
## 
### 
As I looked upon the beardless face
of Chuck Norris, I realized just how
many good things I have come to
love and expect are now gone and beard
less.
I saw Chuck Norris on a TV commercial
the other day and 1 was saddened by the
changes I saw. I may get a roundhouse kick to
the face for saying it, but Chuck Norris of the
present could get his butt kicked by Chuck
Norris of the past. Chuck Norris of the past
had a mighty beard that could deflect the
blades of chainsaws. Chuck Norris donated
follicles of his hair to the Ginzu knife corpo
ration. It is not Ginzu knifes then but Chuck
Norris that can cut through anything.
1 think Chuck's transformation is oddly
indicative of other forces shaping my so
called life. This past break was my last in
Jersey (state motto: "Zeppelin Accident
Free Since 1937"). My departure from Jer
sey will actually deeply affect my social life.
It means I'm going to have to rephrase "I'm
from Jersey, I'm sorry." to "I used to be from
Jersey. I have no excuse for eating your
hamster."

The absence of Chuck's beard reminds
me of a similar absence in my hometown.
Residents of New Jersey find their social
lives dependent on local malls in the same
way that prisoners find their social lives de
pendent on which their cellblock. My home
town is no exception.Now my mall is being
bulldozed to make way fora hospital. If
you've ever seen "Mallrats," you'll know
most people in New Jersey don't go to the
mall to shop but to make fun of people. With
the mall gone and the hospital in its place,
hanging out just won't be the same. Instead
of stealing free samples and mocking the
people in line for Starbucks, we'd be stealing

patients' hospital gowns and making fun of
squirrel attack victims. I don't know how
that sits on your conscience, but for me it's
just too easy.
The death of my high school social niche
was not the only change in these strange
times. KROO. New York's rock radio sta
tion, has changed formats. They are now a
talk radio station.That's like if Cartoon Net
work switched to 24 hours of "The View."
First my mall, now my music; Jersey just isn't
the same.
I first heard Nirvana, Pearl Jam and the
Offspring on KROQ. I was there during the
good times, like when they premiered "Guer
rilla Radio" on the air. I was there during the
bad — that six month period when every
third song was by Creed. But I stuck by them
and now they've gone and decided the "alter
native" thing to do is boldly take AM radio's
dynamic discussions on vinyl siding and cake
recipes and put it on FM.
Speaking of signs of the apocalypse.
Chuck Norris used to be on TV selling exer
cise equipment. Now Chuck has been spot
ted with his wife calling for Bibles to be

placed in schools. As you are all aware of my
feelings on religion. I was pretty pissed off
when I saw the TV advertisement. 1 think it's
disgusting that Chuck Norris has taken a
mortal wife. The Chuck Norris of the past
could not be contained by any normal fe
male; he routinely had affairs with Hera and
Aphrodite, fathering several pantheons of
gods.
So Chuck's beard and godliness have
taken hits in the public eye. but I still admire
the man. And hopefully, he won't mind me
using his awesomeness to talk about the
changes my home state is undergoing. Just
like I'll forever respect Chuck, I'll always
have a place in my heart for the music, malls
and social mediocrity of my former state. 1
guess this is just all part of growing up, mov
ing on and realizing that the Jersey Devil was
just a nickname Chuck Norris received when
he took back Ellis Island from New York
with a roundhouse kick.
