Helmets make sense
This is an exceedingly busy time of year.
However, in reading Sean Howell's column
on bike helmets ("One concussion won't
make me wear a helmet," Dec. 8, 2005), I
thought that it would be worthwhile to take
time out to nominate Sean fora Darwin
Award. I cannot help but wonder how
Robert Steele would have reacted to
Sean's comments. When 1 was a freshman,
Larkin resident Steele died in front of
Stern Hall in a head-on bike-to-bike colli
sion. I was there. I wonder if Robert would
be concerned about appearances if he were
given a second chance.
Now personal choice is one thing, but
using your column to implicitly encourage
others to take similar risks is socially irre
sponsible. I will continue to make my fash
ion statements with my helmet on.
