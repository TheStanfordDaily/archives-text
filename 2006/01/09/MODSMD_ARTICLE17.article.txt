# The
						Dubai dream: indoor skiing
## 
### 
Perhaps the most famous American myth
is the American dream, the notion that a
vision can become a reality in a few short
years, that the poor man can become rich
through hard work, talent and luck. Bill Gates
and Microsoft, and Steve Jobs and Apple are
recent and striking examples of this cultural
legend.
Traveling to Dubai in the United Arab Emi
rates over winter break made me realize that
there is also a Dubai dream, in some ways more
impressive than its American counterpart be
cause it is unfolding so rapidly and in such an
unexpected way.
In 1966, oil was discovered in the Emirates
of Abu Dhabi and Dubai. These poor, arid
lands became rich in a matter of years. But it
was only in the 1980s that Dubai began its rad
ical transformation. Under the impulse of
Sheikh Rashid Bin Saeed, who wished to lay
the foundation fora prosperous future in
Dubai — indeed, the oil will run out 10 or 15
years from now — Dubai was destined to be
come an international tourism and business
capital. Huge, modern skyscrapers emerged
from the arid desert soil, as did shopping
malls, hotels, restaurants and golf courses.
In the past decade. Dubai has seen even
greater expansion than before, with the cre
ation of a whole new part of the city. In the win
ter. when the weather is not too hot, construc

tion occurs 24 hours a day.The recently finished
Mall of the Emirates is the largest shopping
center in the Middle East and features indoor
ski and sledding slopes — in the middle of the
desert. It is quite a surprise to see people in ski
gear going down the artificially constructed
slopes, some of them wearing the traditional
dress, and knowing that the temperature is
above SO degrees outside the mall.
At first the entire concept seemed com
pletely futile. Water is such a scarce resource in
this desert region — more expensive than oil.
Why insist on building something that will
never be as good as the real thing and at such a
high cost?
But there is another way to look at the cur
rent situation in Dubai-as the successful real
ization of a vision. When Sheikh Rashid made
public his decision to transform the arid soils of
Dubai into an international tourism and busi

ness center, he probably raised the skepticism
of countless individuals, who must have told
him his project was outrageous, impossible
and ridiculous. And yet Dubai is today an in
credible success story, and it keeps growing.
In the next couple of years, the tallest tower
in the world (at 2,780 feet), an underwater
hotel and a gigantic man-made island in the
shape of a palm leaf with plots and beach
fronts, will be completed.
Staring at those artificial ski slopes. I real
ized that, like many people, I pay too much at
tention to what other people think. I'm often
afraid of crossing the boundary of the accept
able, the normal. Before carrying out a difficult
or unconventional project, I find myself asking:
how will people react? Who will think that's a
bad idea? What will my family and friends
think of it and me?
Though these are legitimate questions, there
comes a time when — if you think your project
is meaningful and valuable — you should cast
aside these questions and dare to follow your
passions and visions to their full realization.
Remind yourself of all the "impossible" ideas
that have turned into success stories. Going to
the moon. The Internet. Skyscrapers and ski
slopes in Dubai. And maybe your ideas.
