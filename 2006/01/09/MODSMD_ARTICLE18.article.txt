## Govt. use of military force debated Events of Sept. 11 change protocol on use of force 
### JAMES HOHMANN WORLD NATION EDITOR 
Whether a country is justified to use
military force depends on a set of factors
that have changed radically since the at
tacks of Sept. 11 and the end of the Cold
War, a Harvard divinity professor and re
spected ethicist said during his lecture de
livered TUesday, Dec. 6 in the Oak Lounge
atTresidder Union.
Brian Hehir, also president of the
Catholic Charities in the Archdiocese of
Boston, focused his hour-long remarks on
the changing politics of non-proliferation.
He delivered his speech as part of the an
nual Drell Lecture series sponsored by the
Center for International Security and Co
operation (CISAC).
After the terrorist attacks in 2001, non
proliferation became an important dimen
sion of the war against terror, Hehir said.
The United States felt deterrence had
eroded and that diplomacy had little effec

tiveness. It used these premises to justify
preemptive war in the 2(X)2 National Secu
rity Strategy document, he argued.
The question-and-answer session after
his lecture was dominated with queries
about Iraq. Hehir said he does not con
demn all intervention but did oppose the
operation in Iraq from the beginning. Call
ing both the first Gulf War and the imme
diate response to the terrorist attacks in
2001 justified, he said that the invasion of
Iraq in 2003 was different because it was a
preventative war that could have been
avoided.
"The Iraqi intervention was conceived
in confusion, carried forward in arrogance
and has resulted in chaos," he said.
Hehir said he was greatly concerned
about the precedent the invasion of Iraq
created for preventative war in the future.
He disputed the claim that the United
States rushed to war.
"It is not that the war was not ex
plained," he said. "Let us not let the Con
gress off the hook. They wrote the presi
dent a blank check and are only now hav
ing second thoughts about it. We are not
having a very impressive debate about for

eign policy in the United States."
Hehir discussed his support fora more
active military role to respond to cases of
genocide, ethnic cleansing and failed
states. The presumption should be for non
intervention. he said, hut exceptions can
override and create a reason to intervene.
Hehir actively supported intervention in
Rwanda to deal with the genocide during
former president Bill Clinton's first term.
"The problem is what constitutes a trig
ger or just cause to act," he said, listing fac
tors that should be considered such as in
tentions, planning, production and deploy
ment.
He also discussed the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in terms of the
"grand bargain" it represents between nu
clear powers and non-nuclear powers to
preserve order and global security.
"The basic premise of the NPT was a
restriction in sovereignty for the aggregate
goal of stability and safety for all," he said.
"From the beginning, there was a tension
in the doctrine. The NPT is fragile and
flawed but clearlv defensible."
