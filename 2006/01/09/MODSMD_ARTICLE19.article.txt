## Evidence hints at wrongful death Recent research suggests that convict was innocent

Ruben Cantu was executed for the 1984
murder of Pedro Gomez on Aug. 24, 1993.
However, a recent Houston Chronicle article
by Lise Olsen suggests Texas may have exe
cuted the wrong man. Olsen tracked down
Juan Moreno, the sole eyewitness to the mur
der, whose testimony convicted Cantu. Now.
more than 20 years after the crime took
place, Moreno has reversed his statement. In
a conversation with Olsen, Moreno stated
that Cantu "was innocent. It was a case of an
innocent person being killed."
According to a police report of the crime,
on Nov. 8, 1984, Moreno and Gomez fell
asleep in a in San Antonio, Texas, that house
they were renovating for Moreno's wife.Two
"Latino" teens — one 13 or 14, the other
around 19 — awoke them by shining a flood
light in their faces. When Gomez realized the
teens were armed, he quickly drew his own
rifle and shots were fired. Gomez was shot
nine times by the older teen and left for dead.
Moreno was also shot nine times, but man
aged to crawl outside to his pick-up truck
where the police found him at 11:58 p.m.
Detective James Herring of the San Anto
nio Police Department was assigned to the
case. During his first questioning, Moreno
provided little information besides identify
ing two Latino teens, one older than the
other.
According to the Houston Chronicle,
Herring did not speak Spanish and Moreno
spoke little English. Herring spread the word
of the crime around the local high schools,
and a shop teacher at Cantu's high school
told the detective that kids were saying
Cantu had committed the crime. Cantu. a
special-education student from a rough
neighborhood of San Antonio, was consid
ered a local legend for his involvement in the
"Grey Eagles" gang. He was in an auto-theft
ring and often drove stolen cars across the
border fora couple thousand dollars.The po
lice had arrested each of Cantu's brothers.
Cantu had also been tried for juvenile mur
der but had been acquitted of the charges.
When Herring received word from the
shop teacher, he returned to Moreno with a
lineup of photographs, including one of
Cantu; Moreno did not identify Cantu as the
shooter.
On March 1,1985 Cantu was involved in
an altercation with off-duty San Antonio po

lice officer Joe De La Luz while at a local
pool hall. According to police reports, Cantu
shot De La Luz four times,despite being"un
provoked." Cantu later testified that he was
threatened during a dispute over a game.
Charges were never brought against Cantu.
During the two days after the incident,
two detectives questioned Moreno, seeking
an identification of Cantu. The first detec
tive, Santos "Sam" Balleza, recently told the
Chronicle that he felt Moreno would never
be able to make a positive identification.The
second detective, Edward Quantinilla, how
ever, was able to produce a positive identifi
cation from Moreno. Moreno then signed
and dated the back of the Cantu photo. The
photo that was submitted into evidence dur
ing Cantu's trial, however, was not dated and
signed by Moreno. Cantu. 17. and David
Garza. 15, were arrested and prepared to
stand trial.
According to Andrew Carruthers,
Cantu's defense attorney, the entirety of the
prosecution's case rested on Moreno's testi
mony. Bruce Baxter, the prosecutor in the
trial, did not produce a murder weapon, a
confession or fingerprints placing Cantu and
Garza at the crime scene.
"The prosecution's case was Juan
Moreno sitting there with a quivering hand
unequivocally identifying Ruben Cantu,"
Carruthers said.
In the penalty phase of the trial, De La
Luz testified that Cantu shot him during the
pool hall altercation. This, according to Car
ruthers, allowed the prosecution to prove
two important elements for seeking the
death penalty — the act was deliberate, and
Cantu would be dangerous in the future.The
De La Luz shooting paired with Cantu's pre
vious trial for juvenile murder proved to the
jury that Cantu was a violent threat to socie
ty, Carruthers said.
Since Cantu's execution in 1993, both
Moreno and Cantu's co-defendant, Garza,
have presented information that proves
Cantu's innocence.
"The police were sure it was [Cantu] be
cause he had hurt a police officer," Moreno
said in the Chronicle article. "They told me
they were certain it was him. and that's why I
testified. That was bad to blame someone
that was not there."
Garza has since signed a sworn affidavit
stating that Cantu was not the man at the
crime.
