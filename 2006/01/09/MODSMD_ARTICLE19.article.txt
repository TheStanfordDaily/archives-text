## Evidence hints at wrongful death Recent research suggests that convict was innocent 
### JEREMY JACOBS 
Ruben Cantu was executed for the 1984
murder of Pedro Gomez on Aug. 24, 1993.
However, a recent Houston Chronicle article
by Lise Olsen suggests Texas may have exe
cuted the wrong man. Olsen tracked down
Juan Moreno, the sole eyewitness to the mur
der, whose testimony convicted Cantu. Now.
more than 20 years after the crime took
place, Moreno has reversed his statement. In
a conversation with Olsen, Moreno stated
that Cantu "was innocent. It was a case of an
innocent person being killed."
According to a police report of the crime,
on Nov. 8, 1984, Moreno and Gomez fell
asleep in a in San Antonio, Texas, that house
they were renovating for Moreno's wife.Two
"Latino" teens — one 13 or 14, the other
around 19 — awoke them by shining a flood
light in their faces. When Gomez realized the
teens were armed, he quickly drew his own
rifle and shots were fired. Gomez was shot
nine times by the older teen and left for dead.
Moreno was also shot nine times, but man
aged to crawl outside to his pick-up truck
where the police found him at 11:58 p.m.
Detective James Herring of the San Anto
nio Police Department was assigned to the
case. During his first questioning, Moreno
provided little information besides identify
ing two Latino teens, one older than the
other.
According to the Houston Chronicle,
Herring did not speak Spanish and Moreno
spoke little English. Herring spread the word
of the crime around the local high schools,
and a shop teacher at Cantu's high school
told the detective that kids were saying
Cantu had committed the crime. Cantu. a
special-education student from a rough
neighborhood of San Antonio, was consid
ered a local legend for his involvement in the
"Grey Eagles" gang. He was in an auto-theft
ring and often drove stolen cars across the
border fora couple thousand dollars.The po
lice had arrested each of Cantu's brothers.
Cantu had also been tried for juvenile mur
der but had been acquitted of the charges.
When Herring received word from the
shop teacher, he returned to Moreno with a
lineup of photographs, including one of
Cantu; Moreno did not identify Cantu as the
shooter.
On March 1,1985 Cantu was involved in
an altercation with off-duty San Antonio po

lice officer Joe De La Luz while at a local
pool hall. According to police reports, Cantu
shot De La Luz four times,despite being"un
provoked." Cantu later testified that he was
threatened during a dispute over a game.
Charges were never brought against Cantu.
During the two days after the incident,
two detectives questioned Moreno, seeking
an identification of Cantu. The first detec
tive, Santos "Sam" Balleza, recently told the
Chronicle that he felt Moreno would never
be able to make a positive identification.The
second detective, Edward Quantinilla, how
ever, was able to produce a positive identifi
cation from Moreno. Moreno then signed
and dated the back of the Cantu photo. The
photo that was submitted into evidence dur
ing Cantu's trial, however, was not dated and
signed by Moreno. Cantu. 17. and David
Garza. 15, were arrested and prepared to
stand trial.
According to Andrew Carruthers,
Cantu's defense attorney, the entirety of the
prosecution's case rested on Moreno's testi
mony. Bruce Baxter, the prosecutor in the
trial, did not produce a murder weapon, a
confession or fingerprints placing Cantu and
Garza at the crime scene.
"The prosecution's case was Juan
Moreno sitting there with a quivering hand
unequivocally identifying Ruben Cantu,"
Carruthers said.
In the penalty phase of the trial, De La
Luz testified that Cantu shot him during the
pool hall altercation. This, according to Car
ruthers, allowed the prosecution to prove
two important elements for seeking the
death penalty — the act was deliberate, and
Cantu would be dangerous in the future.The
De La Luz shooting paired with Cantu's pre
vious trial for juvenile murder proved to the
jury that Cantu was a violent threat to socie
ty, Carruthers said.
Since Cantu's execution in 1993, both
Moreno and Cantu's co-defendant, Garza,
have presented information that proves
Cantu's innocence.
"The police were sure it was [Cantu] be
cause he had hurt a police officer," Moreno
said in the Chronicle article. "They told me
they were certain it was him. and that's why I
testified. That was bad to blame someone
that was not there."
Garza has since signed a sworn affidavit
stating that Cantu was not the man at the
crime.
Stanford Law Prof. William Abrams, a
current trial defender in death penalty cases.
said Moreno's recent remark must
be viewed carefully.
"I would want to know more
about the circumstances of this and
why do we believe this witness now
when he recants," he said. "How do
we know he's credible now as op
posed to then?"
Carruthers expressed similar ap
prehensions.
"Whv didn't he come forward

when Ruben was still alive and say
this?" he said. "When there are
things like a witness who 20 years
later changes his statement, you
can't correct that after the guy's exe
cuted."
Sam Millsap Jr., who served as
San Antonio's district attorney dur
ing the Cantu case, expressed similar
apprehensions about eyewitness tes
timony and the death penalty. Mill
sap, who "was personally responsible
for all decisions relating to capital
murder cases in terms of how they
would be prosecuted " now admits
that following recent studies sur
rounding eyewitness testimony, he

would not have proceeded as he did
in the Cantu case.
"As far as I'm concerned you
can't assume that eyewitness testi
mony is going to be reliable," Millsap
said. "If 1 had that decision to make
over again, 20 years later, and the
question that was put to me was: Do
we prosecute somebody, seek the
death penalty, based on the testimo
ny of a single eyewitness? I think the
way I would resolve that question
today is I would say 'no.' The system
simply does not protect the inno
cent."
Since 1976, 122 inmates have
been exonerated from Death Row.

However, according to Abrams, the
U.S. population is more concerned
about the capital punishment sys
tem than the actual killing of prison
ers.
"1 think people are more con
cerned about the process rather than
the ultimate issue," he said. "People
are concerned that the process does
not facilitate the finding of truth and
innocent people are being sentenced
to death and executed. 1 think in
principle many — if not most —
people still believe the death penalty
is appropriate, at least for examples
of terrorism or horribly massive
types of killing."
