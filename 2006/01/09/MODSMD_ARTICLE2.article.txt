# LABOR UPDATE
## University, workers resume labor talks 
### JAMES HOHMANN WORLD NATION EDITOR 
The one-day work stoppage that
more than 2,600 workers took part in
on Dec. 12 could be a preview of a
longer strike to come if the Universi
ty and Stanford Hospital do not
make significant concessions, union
leaders said after returning to the
table for talks the following day.
University and union representa
tives disputed the success of the
strike as they continue to search for
common ground.
With the facilitation of a federal
mediator requested by Stanford, ne
gotiators for the University and serv
ice workers re-opened talks the day
after the strike. The meeting had no
conclusive results, and both sides re
iterated their positions. They agreed
to meet again, after returning from
vacations, on Jan. 4 and Jan. 11.
Negotiators mutually agreed to
cancel the Jan. 4 session. Representa
tives from both sides do not expect to
reach consensus at the Jan. 11 meet
ing and more meetings are expected
after Wednesday.
The University has offered a
more conciliatory tone in recent
weeks and expressed willingness late
last week to resume discussions with
union leaders.
"We're looking forward to getting
back to the bargaining table on Jan.
11," University spokesman Alan
Acosta said in an interview with The
Daily. "We want to address the issues
that are being raised. We have been
doing that all along."
"We're optimistic," he added.
Union leaders expressed a readi
ness to follow-up on the one-day
strike with a longer one if demands
are not met.
"Management knows we are
ready for further action," said work
er spokesman Zev Kvitky, adding
that another, potentially longer,
strike is not out of the question.
"The Union is prepared for any
situation," he said."We want to avoid
another strike, but what action we
take next will depend upon the man
agement's position when we return
to the bargaining table."
The University declined to speci
fy what precautions are being taken
