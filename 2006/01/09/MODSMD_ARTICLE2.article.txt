# LABOR UPDATE
## University, workers resume labor talks 
### JAMES HOHMANN WORLD NATION EDITOR 
The one-day work stoppage that
more than 2,600 workers took part in
on Dec. 12 could be a preview of a
longer strike to come if the Universi
ty and Stanford Hospital do not
make significant concessions, union
leaders said after returning to the
table for talks the following day.
University and union representa
tives disputed the success of the
strike as they continue to search for
common ground.
With the facilitation of a federal
mediator requested by Stanford, ne
gotiators for the University and serv
ice workers re-opened talks the day
after the strike. The meeting had no
conclusive results, and both sides re
iterated their positions. They agreed
to meet again, after returning from
vacations, on Jan. 4 and Jan. 11.
Negotiators mutually agreed to
cancel the Jan. 4 session. Representa
tives from both sides do not expect to
reach consensus at the Jan. 11 meet
ing and more meetings are expected
after Wednesday.
The University has offered a
more conciliatory tone in recent
weeks and expressed willingness late
last week to resume discussions with
union leaders.
"We're looking forward to getting
back to the bargaining table on Jan.
11," University spokesman Alan
Acosta said in an interview with The
Daily. "We want to address the issues
that are being raised. We have been
doing that all along."
"We're optimistic," he added.
Union leaders expressed a readi
ness to follow-up on the one-day
strike with a longer one if demands
are not met.
"Management knows we are
ready for further action," said work
er spokesman Zev Kvitky, adding
that another, potentially longer,
strike is not out of the question.
"The Union is prepared for any
situation," he said."We want to avoid
another strike, but what action we
take next will depend upon the man
agement's position when we return
to the bargaining table."
The University declined to speci
fy what precautions are being taken

Workers from the University and Hospital staged a one day strike in White Plaza on Dec. 12.
in case of a longer strike.
"Our focus is on the talks," Acosta said.
"[ln the case of a strike,] the University will
carry on."
Representatives of the Service Employ
ees International Union Local 715 (SEIU)
said work came to a stand still for 24 hours
beginning at 5 a.m. on Monday, Dec. 12.They
touted worker solidarity and favorable
media coverage as indications the strike was
successful.
"We sent a strong message to manage
ment that our members are very serious
about the issues," said Greg Pullman, staff di
rector for SEIU Local 715.
"Other than students taking finals, there
was very little work taking place at the Uni
versity on Monday," added Kvitky, who
called the strike an "incredible success."
Union leaders pointed out that this was
the first time both the Hospital and Univer
sity service workers went on strike simulta
neously.
The University service workers are striv
ing to make gains on re-opened sections of a
contract that is not set to expire until August
2006.
Stanford administrators responded that
many workers — especially those at the
Hospital — crossed the picket lines, and that
the University coped well with the slow
down.
While 90 percent of University workers
stayed at home or joined protesters on cam
pus, a spokeswoman for the medical center
reported that 300 of the S(X) union members
scheduled to work at the Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital crossed the picket lines.
Union leaders said the Hospital misrepre
sented these figures.
At the University, food was catered or, in
some cases, prepared the previous night by
union members. Plastic plates were used to
reduce the number of dishes to wash. Volun
teers and replacement workers staffed some
normally unionized positions.
Administrators roamed dining halls to
speak with students and answer questions
about the strike. Some dining facilities were
closed for the day, but the University of
fered extended hours at those that re
mained open. Students were sent multiple
e-mails with details on the changed hours
and locations.
While some marched to support the
workers and boycotted dining halls, student
labor supporters admitted that apathy and fi
nals kept large numbers of students from
joining the strike, and many crossed picket
lines to eat.

"I'm sick of our generation not standing
up for what we believe is right," said sopho
more Nicole Wires, who joined in a worker
rally.
A few dozen students attended an 11:30
a.m. White Plaza rally for student-worker
solidarity. Carrying signs, they marched to
Building 10, where they met with a larger
protest orchestrated by union leaders. Police
closely monitored this demonstration, which
was designed to attract the attention of Uni
versity trustees meeting inside.

The Student Labor Action Coalition
(SLAC) also hosted an alternative lunch at 1
p.m., a celebration at 5 p.m. and a solidarity
potluck at 6 p.m. at Columbae House.
Picket lines were primarily located at the
main gate of the Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center, the Facilities Bonair Siding
Building, the intersection of Escondido
Road and Campus Drive, Tresidder Union,
the intersection of Via Ortega and Campus
Drive and the fountain in front of the hospi
tal.
"There are substantive reasons to negoti
ate," said freshman SLAC member Ranee
Graham-Bailey, who marched with protest
ers and boycotted dining halls. "Hopefully,
the University will get the message that they
need to negotiate in good faith."
However, some student vocally opposed
the strike. Some could be heard yelling at
picketers from their dorm windows.
"The University would be stupid to cave
in to workers' demands," said senior Donald
Stevens. "There are lots of other people who
want these jobs."
University officials expressed concern

No resolution reached after strike

about violence and threats from some union
supporters.
"While we are pleased and appreciative
that most picketers behaved in a lawful and
respectful manner...we are also disappointed
by the acts of a few individuals who engaged
in unlawful misconduct," University General
Counsel Debra Zumwalt said in an e-mail to
the student body on Dec. 16.
She said that the Department of Public
Safety is investigating windows broken and
electric vehicles overturned by protesters on

"We want Stanford to treat its workers the same
way the rest of the Bay Area does. We want to end
the Hospital s option of contracting out our jobs,"

Monday, Dec. 12.The University also offered
a $1,000 reward for information leading to
the arrest and conviction of the responsible
individuals.
At the Monday rally outside Building 10,
Department of Public Safety officers used
camcorders to record potential criminal ac
tivity.
In a series of interviews with The Daily,
workers said they were protesting for in
creased benefits, more respect from their em
ployers and job security guarantees.
"We want Stanford to treat its workers
the same way the rest of the Bay Area does,"
said Rob Rutledge, a nursing assistant at the
Children's Hospital. "We want to end the
Hospital's option of contracting out our
jobs."
"They want to change the pension plans
so workers have to pay more when they al
ready cannot afford the cost of living in this
area," said Aaron Dinwoodie, a former Lin
ear Accelerator technician who returned to
campus to support his past co-workers. "It
was important for me to come back because
I was active in the union when I was here."

Workers said they joined the picket line
during the 24-hour stoppage because they
felt it would show how essential they are to
the daily operation of the University.
"I think today's strike will help because
everyone is standing together," said Univer
sity custodian Javier Robles, who said he
wants better retirement provisions and med
ical coverage for his dependents.
"I think the strike will be effective be
cause it will bring the word out to the world,"
said Ben Ruezga, a materials assistant at the
Hospital.
Some workers were unwilling to provide
their names for fear of retaliation.
The University disputed workers' claims
that they are under-compensated and that
benefits are lacking. In a Dec. 9 e-mail to stu
dents, Interim Dean of Student Affairs Greg
Boardman stated that many union claims are
exaggerated. More than 50,(X)() people apply

for jobs at the University because of its gen
erous benefits, he argued.
"In one plan, Stanford pays 100 percent of
premiums for the employee and 82 percent
of the cost of premiums for the employee's
family," he wrote. "Very few employers pro
vide this level of coverage."
Union leaders say the benefits are not
enough and confidently project readiness for
another strike. A coalition of student groups
planned to hold a conference call over the
winter break to discuss organizational issues
in case of a repeat, SLAC spokesman Matt
Seriff-Cullick, a sophomore, said in a tele
phone interview with The Daily.
The labor coalition is putting together lit
erature and a frequently-asked-questions
sheet in an effort to help union bosses win
what will certainly remain a heated publicity
war between the University and the union in
the weeks to come.

Administrators roamed dining halls to
speak with students and answer questions
about the strike. Some dining facilities were
closed for the day, but the University of
fered extended hours at those that re
mained open. Students were sent multiple
e-mails with details on the changed hours
and locations.
While some marched to support the
workers and boycotted dining halls, student
labor supporters admitted that apathy and fi
nals kept large numbers of students from
joining the strike, and many crossed picket
lines to eat.

"I'm sick of our generation not standing
up for what we believe is right," said sopho

rally.
A few dozen students attended an 11:30
a.m. White Plaza rally for student-worker
solidarity. Carrying signs, they marched to
Building 10, where they met with a larger
protest orchestrated by union leaders. Police
closely monitored this demonstration, which
was designed to attract the attention of Uni
versity trustees meeting inside.

The Student Labor Action Coalition
(SLAC) also hosted an alternative lunch at 1
p.m., a celebration at 5 p.m. and a solidarity
potluck at 6 p.m. at Columbae House.
Picket lines were primarily located at the
main gate of the Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center, the Facilities Bonair Siding
Building, the intersection of Escondido
Road and Campus Drive, Tresidder Union,
the intersection of Via Ortega and Campus
Drive and the fountain in front of the hospi
tal.
"There are substantive reasons to negoti
ate," said freshman SLAC member Ranee
Graham-Bailey, who marched with protest
ers and boycotted dining halls. "Hopefully,
the University will get the message that they
need to negotiate in good faith."
However, some student vocally opposed
the strike. Some could be heard yelling at
picketers from their dorm windows.
"The University would be stupid to cave
in to workers' demands," said senior Donald
Stevens. "There are lots of other people who
want these jobs."
University officials expressed concern

No resolution reached after strike

about violence and threats from some union
supporters.
"While we are pleased and appreciative
that most picketers behaved in a lawful and
respectful manner...we are also disappointed
by the acts of a few individuals who engaged
in unlawful misconduct," University General
Counsel Debra Zumwalt said in an e-mail to
the student body on Dec. 16.
She said that the Department of Public

Monday, Dec. 12.The University also offered
a $1,000 reward for information leading to
the arrest and conviction of the responsible
individuals.
At the Monday rally outside Building 10,
Department of Public Safety officers used
camcorders to record potential criminal ac
tivity.
In a series of interviews with The Daily,
workers said they were protesting for in
creased benefits, more respect from their em
ployers and job security guarantees.
"We want Stanford to treat its workers
the same way the rest of the Bay Area does,"
said Rob Rutledge, a nursing assistant at the
Children's Hospital. "We want to end the
Hospital's option of contracting out our
jobs."
"They want to change the pension plans
so workers have to pay more when they al
ready cannot afford the cost of living in this
area," said Aaron Dinwoodie, a former Lin
ear Accelerator technician who returned to
campus to support his past co-workers. "It
was important for me to come back because
I was active in the union when I was here."

Workers said they joined the picket line
during the 24-hour stoppage because they
felt it would show how essential they are to
the daily operation of the University.
"I think today's strike will help because
everyone is standing together," said Univer
sity custodian Javier Robles, who said he
wants better retirement provisions and med
ical coverage for his dependents.
"I think the strike will be effective be
cause it will bring the word out to the world,"
said Ben Ruezga, a materials assistant at the
Hospital.
Some workers were unwilling to provide
their names for fear of retaliation.
The University disputed workers' claims
that they are under-compensated and that
benefits are lacking. In a Dec. 9 e-mail to stu
dents, Interim Dean of Student Affairs Greg
Boardman stated that many union claims are
exaggerated. More than 50,(X)() people apply

for jobs at the University because of its gen
erous benefits, he argued.
"In one plan, Stanford pays 100 percent of
premiums for the employee and 82 percent
of the cost of premiums for the employee's
family," he wrote. "Very few employers pro
vide this level of coverage."
Union leaders say the benefits are not
enough and confidently project readiness for
another strike. A coalition of student groups
planned to hold a conference call over the
winter break to discuss organizational issues
in case of a repeat, SLAC spokesman Matt
Seriff-Cullick, a sophomore, said in a tele
phone interview with The Daily.
The labor coalition is putting together lit
erature and a frequently-asked-questions
sheet in an effort to help union bosses win
what will certainly remain a heated publicity
war between the University and the union in
the weeks to come.
The one-day work stoppage that
more than 2,600 workers took part in
on Dec. 12 could be a preview of a
longer strike to come if the Universi
ty and Stanford Hospital do not
make significant concessions, union
leaders said after returning to the
table for talks the following day.
University and union representa
tives disputed the success of the
strike as they continue to search for
common ground.
With the facilitation of a federal
mediator requested by Stanford, ne
gotiators for the University and serv
ice workers re-opened talks the day
after the strike. The meeting had no
conclusive results, and both sides re
iterated their positions. They agreed
to meet again, after returning from
vacations, on Jan. 4 and Jan. 11.
Negotiators mutually agreed to
cancel the Jan. 4 session. Representa
tives from both sides do not expect to
reach consensus at the Jan. 11 meet
ing and more meetings are expected
after Wednesday.
The University has offered a
more conciliatory tone in recent
weeks and expressed willingness late
last week to resume discussions with
union leaders.
"We're looking forward to getting
back to the bargaining table on Jan.
11," University spokesman Alan
Acosta said in an interview with The
Daily. "We want to address the issues
that are being raised. We have been
doing that all along."
"We're optimistic," he added.
Union leaders expressed a readi
ness to follow-up on the one-day
strike with a longer one if demands
are not met.
"Management knows we are
ready for further action," said work
er spokesman Zev Kvitky, adding
that another, potentially longer,
strike is not out of the question.
"The Union is prepared for any
situation," he said."We want to avoid
another strike, but what action we
take next will depend upon the man
agement's position when we return
to the bargaining table."

Workers from the University and Hospital staged a one day strike in White Plaza on Dec. 12.
in case of a longer strike.
"Our focus is on the talks," Acosta said.
"[ln the case of a strike,] the University will
carry on."
Representatives of the Service Employ
ees International Union Local 715 (SEIU)
said work came to a stand still for 24 hours
beginning at 5 a.m. on Monday, Dec. 12.They
touted worker solidarity and favorable
media coverage as indications the strike was
successful.
"We sent a strong message to manage
ment that our members are very serious
about the issues," said Greg Pullman, staff di
rector for SEIU Local 715.
"Other than students taking finals, there
was very little work taking place at the Uni
versity on Monday," added Kvitky, who
called the strike an "incredible success."
Union leaders pointed out that this was
the first time both the Hospital and Univer
sity service workers went on strike simulta
neously.
The University service workers are striv
ing to make gains on re-opened sections of a
contract that is not set to expire until August
2006.
Stanford administrators responded that
many workers — especially those at the
Hospital — crossed the picket lines, and that
the University coped well with the slow
down.
While 90 percent of University workers
stayed at home or joined protesters on cam
pus, a spokeswoman for the medical center
reported that 300 of the S(X) union members
scheduled to work at the Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital crossed the picket lines.
Union leaders said the Hospital misrepre
sented these figures.

the daily operation of the University.
"I think today's strike will help because
everyone is standing together," said Univer
sity custodian Javier Robles, who said he
wants better retirement provisions and med
ical coverage for his dependents.
"I think the strike will be effective be
cause it will bring the word out to the world,"
said Ben Ruezga, a materials assistant at the
Hospital.
Some workers were unwilling to provide
their names for fear of retaliation.
The University disputed workers' claims
that they are under-compensated and that
benefits are lacking. In a Dec. 9 e-mail to stu
dents, Interim Dean of Student Affairs Greg
Boardman stated that many union claims are
exaggerated. More than 50,(X)() people apply

for jobs at the University because of its gen
erous benefits, he argued.
"In one plan, Stanford pays 100 percent of
premiums for the employee and 82 percent
of the cost of premiums for the employee's
family," he wrote. "Very few employers pro
vide this level of coverage."
Union leaders say the benefits are not
enough and confidently project readiness for
another strike. A coalition of student groups
planned to hold a conference call over the
winter break to discuss organizational issues
in case of a repeat, SLAC spokesman Matt
Seriff-Cullick, a sophomore, said in a tele
phone interview with The Daily.
The labor coalition is putting together lit
erature and a frequently-asked-questions
sheet in an effort to help union bosses win
what will certainly remain a heated publicity
war between the University and the union in
the weeks to come.
