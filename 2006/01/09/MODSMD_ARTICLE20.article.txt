## ON THE REBOUND Stanford defeats Oregon, 64- 62, in final minutes of game 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
Heading into Saturday's game at Maples Pavil
ion, Oregon had not won in Palo Alto since 1986 —
before the births of five players on the Stanford ros
ter. It took the best efforts from every player on that
roster, young and old, to keep the streak alive.

The outcome of
the game came down
to the final play, be
ginning when sopho
more guard Tim Mor
ris stripped the ball
out of the hands of a
driving Aaron Brooks
to preserve a 64-62
victory for the Cardi
nal (6-6,2-2 Pacific-10
Conference).
On the final play,
Oregon opted to hold
for the last shot rather
than attempt a shot
and foul if there was a
miss. The decision cost
the Ducks dearly (7-8,
1-2). Bryce Taylor re
covered the loose ball
after the strip by Mor
ris but couldn't get his
desperation shot off
before time expired.
"I had the same

possession] that I had

had the whole game," Morris said. "There was a lot
more at stake later on. If they had scored they prob
ably would have won so there was a lot more inten
sity. I didn't want to give him a three because if he hit
a three we would have lost. Just no three."
The fact that the game came down to the final
play was surprising, given that the Cardinal led by as
much as 13 in the second half. Oregon took advan
tage of a 9-0 run midway through the half that was
capped by a three-pointer from Taylor.
The Cardinal lead never extended past six points
in the final 13 minutes and was cut to just two with
1:12 to go on a jumper by Malik Hariston to set up
the final play.
Morris, the defensive hero on the play, also
proved to be the Cardinal's best rebounder on an
evening in which the Ducks out-rebounded Stan
ford, 36-32. Morris picked up a career high eight re
bounds, none of which came easily.
"I've been concentrating on every single play,"
Morris said. "I stopped thinking about the total and
started thinking every time down the court — going
into the paint to get the board. Concentrate on de
fense; concentrate on rebounding; concentrate on
being aggressive."
Morris was forced to step up his play because the
Cardinal's leading rebounder, senior Matt Haryasz,
was limited to a reserve role. Haryasz didn't make
the start but was used in 26 minutes off the bench
after missing the final 13 minutes of a Dec. 31 USC
game and all of Thursday's win over Oregon State.
He did pace Stanford with 16 points but was held to
just three rebounds, well below his season average of
nine per game.
"[My ankle] was okay," Haryasz said. "I didn't re
ally feel like myself out there today. 1 haven't played
in a week. This is the first time I've actually played
since I got hurt...Everyone else on our team really
stepped up big for us. I only got three rebounds
which means everyone else had to step up for us."
Oregon's ability to collect offensive rebounds
proved critical in their second-half comeback. The
Ducks had 17 offensive rebounds compared to just
10 for the Cardinal.
Hariston led the Ducks on the glass as well as in
scoring. He scored 21 points and collected seven re
bounds.
The game was back and forth for the first seven
minutes, but the Cardinal went on a 14-5 run over a
five-minute span to push their lead to 24-15. But the
Ducks answered back, and a jumper from Marty Le
unen cut the Cardinal lead to eight as the teams
headed into the locker room.
"I thought the first half was probably as good a
half in terms of sharing the ball and staying in our
system offensively and playing together as we have
all season," Stanford head coach Trent Johnson said.

Heading into Saturday's game at Maples Pavil

before the births of five players on the Stanford ros

roster, young and old, to keep the streak alive.

After going 2-5 in the

2006 to a decent start.

Tim Morris helped se

Saturday. The sopho

had the whole game," Morris said. "There was a lot
more at stake later on. If they had scored they prob
ably would have won so there was a lot more inten
sity. I didn't want to give him a three because if he hit
a three we would have lost. Just no three."
The fact that the game came down to the final
play was surprising, given that the Cardinal led by as
much as 13 in the second half. Oregon took advan
tage of a 9-0 run midway through the half that was
capped by a three-pointer from Taylor.
The Cardinal lead never extended past six points
in the final 13 minutes and was cut to just two with
1:12 to go on a jumper by Malik Hariston to set up
the final play.
Morris, the defensive hero on the play, also
proved to be the Cardinal's best rebounder on an
evening in which the Ducks out-rebounded Stan
ford, 36-32. Morris picked up a career high eight re
bounds, none of which came easily.
"I've been concentrating on every single play,"
Morris said. "I stopped thinking about the total and
started thinking every time down the court — going
into the paint to get the board. Concentrate on de
fense; concentrate on rebounding; concentrate on
being aggressive."
Morris was forced to step up his play because the
Cardinal's leading rebounder, senior Matt Haryasz,
was limited to a reserve role. Haryasz didn't make
the start but was used in 26 minutes off the bench
after missing the final 13 minutes of a Dec. 31 USC
game and all of Thursday's win over Oregon State.
He did pace Stanford with 16 points but was held to
just three rebounds, well below his season average of
nine per game.
"[My ankle] was okay," Haryasz said. "I didn't re
ally feel like myself out there today. 1 haven't played
in a week. This is the first time I've actually played
since I got hurt...Everyone else on our team really
stepped up big for us. I only got three rebounds
which means everyone else had to step up for us."
Oregon's ability to collect offensive rebounds
proved critical in their second-half comeback. The
Ducks had 17 offensive rebounds compared to just
10 for the Cardinal.
Hariston led the Ducks on the glass as well as in
scoring. He scored 21 points and collected seven re
bounds.
The game was back and forth for the first seven
minutes, but the Cardinal went on a 14-5 run over a
five-minute span to push their lead to 24-15. But the
Ducks answered back, and a jumper from Marty Le
unen cut the Cardinal lead to eight as the teams
headed into the locker room.
"I thought the first half was probably as good a
half in terms of sharing the ball and staying in our
system offensively and playing together as we have
all season," Stanford head coach Trent Johnson said.
