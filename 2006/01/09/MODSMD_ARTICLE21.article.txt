# Longhorns and Trojans not so different
## 
### 
The only thing that I hate more than
USC's "Victory" hand signal is Texas'
"Hook'Em Horns." One applies Win
ston Churchill's call for victory over the
Nazis to entities like Fresno State.The other
tells everyone, "I rope cattle."
Just five days ago, these two seemingly ir
reconcilable symbols came together when
Texas fans poured into Pasadena by the bus
load. As if the infusion of USC fans hadn't
already filled my hometown with enough
white people.
As I found out, Longhorn fans and Tro
jan fans have more in common than just
pasty skin. In fact, after touring the tailgate
parties, the event seemed more like a re
union of 50,CKK) sets of twins separated at
birth than a matchup between the two most
powerful teams in the country.
Basically, they seemed to really like each
other.
Stanford classmate Kyle Peterson and 1
went armed with a notepad, a pen and a 12-
pack of Pabst (he's in Sigma Chi). Decked
out in burnt orange. Kyle tried to incite a ri
valry early on by yelling "I thought USC
girls were supposed to be pretty!" out the
window of my station wagon. This created a
semi-awkward situation as we were stuck in
gridlock traffic at the time, but the girl
looked more embarrassed than angry.
When we reached the grass parking lot
around the Rose Bowl, I started interview
ing fans from both teams while handing Kyle
beers out of his backpack. For the most part,
fans had really good things to say about the
opposing teams. Several of the Texas faithful
called USC the "best team in the nation."
TWo even said the"V" was cool because it re
minded them of "Hook 'em Horns."
Looking for USC fans that would talk
trash about Texas. I spotted a guy wearing a
'Texas Blows' shirt.
"Actually, a friend gave this to me," he
said when I told him that his shirt was great.
"Texas has a pretty good football team."
Desperate for something to write this
column about. 1 found a USC fan looking
for tickets with his burnt orange-attired
daughter and son, while Kyle, already three
or four deep, started to berate a little kid in
a Reggie Bush jersey.
"You must really hate each other, right?"
1 asked.
Hie father looked surprised. "We love
each other," he said. "I'II be happy if my
team wins, but I'll also be happy if my fami
ly's team wins."
That's the thing about USC and Texas:
they really had nothing to fight about. Both
are big, preppy schools that revolve around
frat culture and silly mascots and fight songs.
They thrive on group mentality: to produce
that many Matt Leinart and Vince Young jer
seys. the Malaysian sweat-shops must have
had to work extra hard over the holidays.
Both sets of fans looked like they felt
right at home at the tailgate. Trojans and
Longhorns barbecued, drank and played
football with each other. They stood side
by-side as more busloads of Texans rolled
in, holding up hand signals that looked so
similar, it was hard to tell whether SC fans
were supporting Texas fans or trying to
scare them away by threatening bunny ears.
Attempts to start a rivalry weren't quite
convincing. One Texas fan told me that he
thought it was stupid that a Trojan fan's "V"
shirt had "Victory" written below it. A USC
sorority girl launched into a high-pitched
story about a Texas fan asking her if the"V"
meant No. 2, to which she responded that it
stood for the number of championships
USC has won.
"You mean in the last two years?" 1
asked.
"Oh. Yeah!" she said.
Most fans said that they hadn't seen any
thing in the way of a rivalry. The guy with the
"Texas Blows" shirt acknowledged that
"everybody's been decent." One Texas fan
who had started tailgating at 6:15 a.m. report
ed receiving uncomfortable stares. A USC
fan threw a handful of errant peanuts at Kyle.
Without an opponent that they could re
ally sink their teeth into, fans on both sides
seemed unsure of what to do. Kyle and I
made our way over to a concrete channel
that runs through the golf course behind the
Rose Bowl. We found Trojan and Longhorn
fans on either side engaged in some verbal
sparring about the relative sizes of their
genitalia. One of the USC kids eventually
leaped across the stream to confront the
Texas fans, but he ended up drinking a beer
with them.
It was a frat boy's dream: an all-day party
on a golf course, with inebriated girls stum
bling in by the busload. It almost made you
want to go to the actual game.
But I knew, that no matter who won, I
wouldn't be able to sit through the fight
songs. If I had to hear "Fight On" and"The
Eyes of Texas are Upon You" at the same
time, 1 knew that something might snap.
