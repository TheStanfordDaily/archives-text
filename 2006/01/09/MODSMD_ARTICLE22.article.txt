### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
I 101 * 1 Virginia Tech 59, Stanford 52
• -A / @ Las Vegas Shootout
Senior forward Matt Haryasz and senior guard Chris Hernan
dez scored 17 points each and the Cardinal led by nine at the half,
but Stanford mustered just 22 points in the second half and could
not hang on for the victory.
They held the lead until the 3:04 mark of the second half when
Zabian Dowdell hit a layup to put the Hokies ahead.The Cardinal
had a chance to stay close, but Hernandez missed two front ends
of one-and-one opportunities and Markus Sailes hit a three point
er with 23 seconds to stretch the Virginia Tech lead to six.
Dec. 19 Stanford 71, Denver 49
Unlike 2004 when the Cardinal had to hang on to dear life to
pull out a four point win against the Pioneers, the outcome in 2005
was rarely in doubt.
The Cardinal effectively shut down Denver's standout center
and last year's Sun Belt Player of the Year, Yemi Nicholson. The 6-
foot-11,260-pound center was limited to 10 points and was ham
pered by foul trouble throughout.
Haryasz posted his fifth double-double of the season, pacing
the Cardinal with 24 points and 13 rebounds. Senior guard Dan
Grunfeld added 19 points, six rebounds and five assists to help the
Cardinal break a three-game losing streak.
Stanford led by 18 points at halftime, but the Pioneers were
able to cut the lead to nine; with 7:53 to go in the second half, Alex
Cox nailed a three-pointer, but Denver only scored two points the
rest of the way.
I Stanford 58, Princeton 34
@The Pete Newell Challenge
Two games after scoring a paltry 21 points against Monmouth,
Princeton scored just 14 points in the first half of a 58-34 loss to the
Cardinal at the Oakland Coliseum in the annual Pete Newell
Challenge.
The Tigers shot just 32.5 percent from the field and turned the
ball over 18 times while playing their trademark slow-down of
fense. Princeton heaved up 21 three-point attempts but could never
get its offense clicking. The Tigers were playing without their start
ing point guard Scott Greenman, who was out with a back injury.
Hernandez and Grunfeld led the charge for the Cardinal with
II points each.
The Cardinal improved to 8-0 all time in the Pete Newell Chal
lenge.
Dec. 29 No. 11 UCLA 71, Stanford 54
UCLA jumped out to an 18-1 lead in the first six minutes of the
game and the Cardinal could never cut the deficit to single digits.

on the way to a disappointing 17-point loss.
The Bruins' Arron Afflalo scored 18 of his 23 points in the first
half, while Stanford combined to shoot just 20 percent as a team
during the same period.
And while UCLA lost one of its best players, it got back anoth
er. The Bruins were without senior guard Cedric Bozeman who
was a last minute scratch after tearing the cartilage in his left
shoulder during practice. Sophomore Josh Shipp returned for
UCLA after missing the first 11 games following hip surgery in
September. He chipped in 11 points and four rebounds in his re
turn.
Stanford hadn't lost at Pauley Pavilion since 1997 and had not
lost to the Bruins since 2(X)2.
Dec. 31 use 82, Stanford 71
Stanford's New Year's Eve game at the Staples Center wasn't
the best way for the Cardinal to cap off 20()5 and kick off 2006.
The Cardinal trailed by as much as 18 in the second half, but cut
the Trojan lead to just four after Grunfeld's three-pointer with
about three minutes left. However, turnovers and missed shots
killed the Cardinal in the final moments and USC extended its
lead.
The Trojans, who missed the Pacific-lOTournament last season
and finished last in the conference, were led by junior Lodrick
Stewart who posted 18 points and eight rebounds.
Freshman forward Lawrence Hill had the best game of his
young Stanford career, scoring 24 points.
The Cardinal suffered a major scare when Haryasz went down
in the second half with a sprained ankle. He did not return and fin
ished with seven points, breaking his 24-game streak of scoring in
the double-digits.
Jan. 5 Stanford 80, Oregon State 66
The Cardinal returned home after three games away from
Maples Pavilion and used the energy of the Stanford crowd to
carry them in the second half.
Hernandez stepped up down the stretch to help the Cardinal
pull away from a pesky Beaver team. He picked up 10 of his 20
points in the final five minutes of play and hit two critical three
pointers to cap a 10-0 Stanford run.
The Cardinal played without Haryasz, who missed the game
with a sprained left ankle. Sophomore center Peter Prowitt had ca
reer highs in both points and rebounds — with 12 and six respec
tively — while replacing Haryasz.
Free-throws may have been the difference in the match: the
Cardinal were 31 of 35 from the charity stripe, while the Beavers
were just 13 of 19. Grunfeld made all 10 of his attempts on the way
to scoring 14 points.
Note: Junior forward Fred Washington who has been out since
December 19 with tendonitis in his left knee will miss the rest of
the season following surgery on that knee. Washington played in
Stanford's first six games, getting two starts and averaging 3.5
points and 1.5 rebounds per game.


JOEL LEWENSTEIN/The Stanford Daily
Sophomore forward Taj Finger and Stanford men's basketball did not fare well against Southern
California teams over the break. The Bruins blew by the Cardinal and the Trojans kept the Stan
ford sauad at bay, handina Stanford back-to-back losses.r
