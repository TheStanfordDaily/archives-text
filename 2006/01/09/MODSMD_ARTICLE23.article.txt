### JIM VERTUNO AP SPORTS WRITER 
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) —Vince
Young is headed to the NFL.
The Texas quarterback, who led
the Longhorjis to their first national
championship in 36 years, an
nounced yesterday he would make
himself eligible for the April draft.
Young maintained during the sea
son that he would to return for his
senior year, but said his Rose Bowl
performance put him "over the top."
"Hard work has paid off a whole
lot," he said.
Young was spectacular in Texas'
41-38 Rose Bowl win over top
ranked Southern California on
Wednesday, and he would have been
a favorite to win the Heisman Tro
phy had he decided to return.
The versatile quarterback ac
counted for 467 yards against USC
— 200 running and 267 passing —
and ran eight yards for the winning
touchdown with 19 seconds left.
Young thanked many people, in
cluding his family and coach Mack
Brown, who was at the American
Football Coaches Association Con
vention and could not attend Sun
day's news conference. He specifi
cally thanked Brown for "helping
me become a better man."
In a statement. Brown said he
met with Young and his family Sun
day morning and fully supports
Young's decision.
"We love Vince and appreciate all
the great things he's done for the
University of Texas on and off the
field." Brown said. "We'll miss him
but want him to do as well in the
NFL as he did in college."
In his eight seasons at Texas,
Brown has never had a player leave
early for the NFL.
Young ends his career at Texas
with a 30-2 record — the best in
school history.

Texas' star quarterback Vince Young announced he would not return to UT for his senior year. The |u
nior's decision was sparked by the Longhorns' 41 -38 win over USC in last week's Rose Bowl.
His Rose Bowl performance in
creased speculation that he would
leave school early and also started a
debate about whether he would be
the No. 1 pick in April's draft.
Young's hometown Houston Tex
ans have the first pick. Young said it
would be wonderful to play in Hous
ton but realizes he could wind up
somewhere else.
One those possibilities is Ten
nessee, which has the third pick.
Young counts Titans quarterback
Steve McNair among his close
friends. He said McNair told him
"go with your heart" in making his
decision.

Gil Brandt, longtime Cowboys
personnel director and current
NFL.com draft analyst,called Young
a likely top five pick hut said he
thought Young should have stayed at
Texas another year.
"He is very, very similar to Ran
dall Cunningham," Brandt said.
"Had he waited, he probably
would've been a better player. All
quarterbacks get better with the
more experience they get. Going
from college football to the NFL is
about like going from eighth grade
to being a graduate student at MIT."
Although Young has been criti
cized by analysts for his quirky
sidearm throwing motion, Brandt
said the most important factor is
Young's winning record.
"He has a bottom-line of 30-2,"
Brandt said. "Bobby Layne and
Sonny Jurgenson didn't have perfect

deliveries either, but they're in the
Hall of Fame."
Young said he talked over his de
cision with his family and said some
of his advisers told him to stay at
Texas to finish his degree.
Considering the deadline for de
claring for the draft is Jan. 15, it was
clear his mind was already made up.
The ultimate decision. Young said,
was his.
"It took a lot of praying, listening,
understanding and knowing that the
day was going to come." said Felicia
Young, who attended her son's news
conference. "Everything is all right.
This is great."
Asked how he might spend some
of the millions of dollars he'll earn as
an NFL player, Young said,"lt all de
pends on mama."
