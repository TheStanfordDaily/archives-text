# Carolina crushes New York in Giants' embarrassing 23-0 loss
## Panthers' defense stifles Barber and Manning, forces five turnovers 
### JENNA FRYER AP SPORTS WRITER 
EAST RUTHERFORD. N.J. (AP) —
ITie Carolina Panthers beat the New
York Giants at their own game, in their
own place.
Steve Smith scored a pair of touch
downs and Carolina rattled Eli Manning
into four turnovers to lead the Panthers
to a 23-0 win over New York in the first
round of the NFC playoffs Sunday.
The Panthers did it with a stout defense
and a strong running game — the same
principles the Giants used this season to
win their first divisional title in five years.
Playing nearly as well as they did in
their Super Bowl season two years ago,
the Panthers (12-5) handed New York its
first playoff shutout in 20 years.
"Everybody may say we're a Super
Bowl team — we're not," Smith cau
tioned. "All we are is a one-win playoff
team."
Manning threw three interceptions
and then fumbled late in the game in

front of a nearly empty Giants Stadium.
Tiki Barber was held to a season-low 41
yards rushing, while the Giants managed
just 109 yards total offense.
New York became the first home
playoff team to be shut out since 1980,
when the Los Angeles Rams blanked
Tampa Bay.
It was exactly the performance ex
pected from a John Fox-coached team.
Fox and the Panthers seemed to be ahead
of the Giants on almost every play in his
return to the Meadowlands. where Fox
spent five years as defensive coordinator
before taking over in Carolina in 2002.
"It was strange." Barber said. "They
were in our huddle a little bit.They kind of
had us dissected and figured out. and we
couldn't get anything going consistently."
DeShaun Foster ran for 151 yards by
going straight at the Giants' depleted
linebacker corps, kick-starting a running
game that has been spotty all year.
"We wanted to get out there and es
tablish the run early," Foster said. "That's
how you keep their players off the field.
We were just able to do that and it
worked out for us."
Smith had 10 catches for 84 yards. He

scored once on a 22-yard catch from
Jake Delhomme, then ran a reverse
in 12 yards fora second score.
But the game belonged to Caroli
na's defense, which was insulted earli
er in the week when Osi Umenyiora
said the Panthers had the second-best
defensive ends in the NFL. The shot
at Julius Peppers and Mike Rucker
stung, and the entire unit responded.
Although Umenyiora and
Michael Strahan combined for three
sacks of Delhomme. Peppers and
Rucker are the ones still playing.
"Taking away Tiki — he's the
thing that makes them go," Peppers
said."We had to get a handle on him;
we got a couple hits on Eli early. I
think that kind of rattled him."
Carolina forced five turnovers in
all and kept New York's offense off
the field. It allowed the Panthers to
keep the ball a whopping 42:45.
"I believe we still have a lot to be
proud of," Barber said. "We have no
reason to hang our heads even
though we showed the playoffs
weren't what we were ready for.
Not on Sunday they weren't.
The New York crowd, so rowdy at
kickoff, booed the Giants off the field
after a frustrating first half. It contin
ued most of the second half, until the
crowd gave a sarcastic cheer after
New York finally managed a first
down — one of just nine in the game.
