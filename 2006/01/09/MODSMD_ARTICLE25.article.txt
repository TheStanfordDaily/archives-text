## Negotiations make progress 
### JAMES HOHMANN WORLD NATION EDITOR 
As break came to an end, progress was
reported in the ongoing negotiations be
tween the Service Employees Internation
al Union and Stanford Hospitals. Late last
week, SEIU Local 715 and Stanford Hos
pital exchanged their first proposals since
the "last, best and final offer" was made by
the Hospital on Nov. 21.
Hospital and union negotiators met
privately last Friday morning to discuss
what will happen next.
Details of the proposal, including any
specific concessions unions offered to
make, were unclear and not made avail
able by press time. Union spokesmen did
not return multiple phone requests for
comment.
Hospital spokeswoman Sarah Staley
expressed hope fora prompt resolution.
"We were hoping for an agreed upon
contract in November," she said. "The
Hospital's offer was competitive. It is un
fortunate that the Hospital workers con
tinue to work without the increased bene
fits offered to them."
"It would be nice to allow these em
ployees to enjoy the wages and benefits
they deserve and for everyone to have clo
sure," she said. "We just hope the union is
listening to the workers."
Staley reported that 54 percent of

scheduled unionized workers crossed the
picket lines during the Dec. 12 work stop
page.The Hospital argues that the number
of medical workers who crossed the pick
et lines indicates frustration at the union
for not agreeing to the offers and conces
sions made by the Hospital in November,
including a significant pay raise.
"Their actions loudly and clearly
demonstrate to us and the union their sup
port for our offer," she said.
The union strongly disputed this claim
and said the numbers are misleading.
"From the beginning, the Hospitals
have lied to union members," worker
spokesman Zev Kvitky said after the
strike. "They released that number to the
public to try to intimidate workers. This
has been a tactic since the very beginning."
Kvitky told The Daily that Stanford
Hospital surveyed workers to see which
workers would be most likely to cross the
picket line and scheduled those workers
for shifts during the pre-announced work
stoppage.
The Hospital strongly rebutted claims
that it did not care about the well-being of
workers.
"We appreciate that these employees
are critical to patient care everyday," Sta
ley said.
The Hospital workers have been trying
to finalize a new contract to replace the
one that expired on Nov. 13.
