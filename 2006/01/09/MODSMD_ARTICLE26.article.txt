## Textbook prices on the rise Prompt changes such as customized textbooks 
### LI TAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Skyrocketing costs. Accusations of
gouging. Sounds like the oil market? Think
again. As the new quarter begins, Stanford
students are discovering textbook prices
seem to be on the rise yet again.
"When books are expensive, it only
increases the bitterness," said sopho
more Emily Escarra. "There are mis
placed sentiments, and students who are
pissed off about the books are going to
become pissed off about the class."
Several professors and lecturers have
decided to abandon official textbooks al
together. But, how hard is it to put to
gether your own textbook?
"It's pretty easy, really," said graduate
student Stefanie Mollborn, who teaches a
class on the sociology of gender. "You
pick out which books you want to use and
pull a few articles, and then make photo
copies. The copy shops contact the pub
lisher and secure rights and licensing."
Economics Instructor Alex Gould,
who uses a custom textbook for his class
on money and banking, said that there
exists "an oligopoly of three publishing
companies that control almost all the
textbooks used today." Gould was able to
put together and order a tailored text
book for his class from McGraw-Hill's
Primis Online, a Web site that allows pro
fessors to assemble custom textbooks for
their classes.
"My goal is that nobody should pay
for extra material that they don't need,"
he said.
But according to Mollborn, pricing is
a secondary reason to use customized
textbooks compared to the control over
the course they provide.
Mollborn noted that custom text
books are used extensively in the Sociol
ogy Department.
"There is a lack of [sociology] text
books that are the right level for the
Stanford undergraduate population,"
she said. Especially for her course, "ei
ther the textbooks are too easy, or they
are aimed toward the graduate level."
The use of customized textbooks has
a large effect on the way classes are
taught.

Customized textbooks "allow you to
pick exactly the material you want stu
dents to read." Mollborn added. "It al
lows you to make the course more chal
lenging, being able to use journal articles
and primary sourced reports."
In particular, the use of the sometimes
difficult terminology aids students in
learning the language of the discipline,
she said.
Gould said that his customized text
book allowed him to "mix and match
chapters" from four or five different text
books, which was useful for his class be
cause "some textbooks are more in
depth than others" for different topics.
Sophomore Emily Escarra, a student
in Mollborn's class,said she had few com
plaints with her course reader.
"My course reader was about $77 I
think," she said. "The printing quality
was fine, though it was a little confusing
and the pages weren't numbered well."
Escarra said that she appreciated the
assistance from the professors' use of
cheaper custom course readers.
"It's wonderful: it's fabulous," she
said.
However, senior Meenal Kumar had a
few complaints about her experience
with an economics custom textbook.
"It was expensive, actually," she said,
adding that the textbook cost about $ 150,
almost as much as a regular textbook.
Due to the difficult logistics involved
in distribution, "[the Bookstore] didn't
order enough the first time, so I had to
order it myself," she said. "I didn't get to
use it until halfway into the quarter."
Moreover, she said she felt the mate
rial was repetitive.
"It was the same topic, a chapter from
each book," Kumar said."l thought it was
a waste of time, frankly."
Still, Kumar said that she appreciated
not having to purchase four extra books
for the class.
"It's pretty cool they can make [the
publishing companies] do that," she said.
"Maybe if they streamline the distribu
tion, it would be more convenient."
While some classes have custom
course readers, other professors choose
an even cheaper route.
Freshman Arpeet Shah, said that even
though a custom course reader was of
fered for his Visions of Mortality IHUM
course, "they just put all of the materials
online" using the Coursework Web site.
