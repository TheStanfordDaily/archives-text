## School board to suspend drug test policy 
### LAUREN LIPAJ THE POST 
(U-WIRE) ATHENS, Ohio — Alexander,
Ohio, school board members voted to suspend
the school's controversial drug-testing policy
for the remainder of 2(X)5 during the Novem
ber board meeting.
The drug-testing policy, effective last year,
required students who participated in athletics
or cheerleading or sought a permit to park in
the school parking lot to undergo a urine test
for drug and alcohol use.
The move was approved 4-1 by school
board members to avoid a lawsuit over a pos
sible violation of the open meetings state law
that might have occurred during the creation
of the policy.
Athens County Prosecutor C. David War
ren recommended the school board suspend
the policy in order to avoid a possible lawsuit
from a group of discontented parents.
"A board member was on the committee
that was researching the drug-testing policy
and because this committee was dealing in a
legislative function, the meetings needed to be
open to the public," Warren said.
The debate lies in whether the committee is
interpreted as a board-appointed committee
or as a committee-advising panel, said Alexan

der Superintendent Robert Bray. Ohio's Sun
shine Laws, which include open meetings, state
that citizens must be able to observe the oper
ations of their representative government.The
laws require public bodies to take official ac
tion and to conduct deliberations concerning
official business in open meetings. A board-ap
pointed committee would have to adhere to
the Sunshine Laws, Bray said.
"The question is whether the board com
mitted a Sunshine Law violation," he said.
"The parents felt like they needed more input
on the meetings so that they could partici
pate."
The unofficial committee created by Bray
to research the policy included one board
member, Dave Kasler, which qualifies the
committee as a board committee. A board
committee is subject to the state's open meet
ings law. Bray said school board attorneys
from Bricker & Eckler LLP, a Columbus,
Ohio-based law firm, did not think the com
mittee violated the Sunshine Laws, but after
questions were raised. Bray changed his mind.
Now that the policy has been suspended
the board cannot be sued. Warren said.
The drug-testing policy was used for three
months during the fall, but Bray said it was too
early to tell what results the policy had on stu
dents.

During the Nov. 8 elections, two board
members who had voted to adopt the drug
testing policy, Synthia Clary and Steve
Thomas, were replaced by Gordon Brooks
and Mike Chapman. Fred Davis, an incumbent
and the only board member who had voted
against the policy, was kept on to the school
board, pulling the most votes of any of the six
candidates running in the election.
"I felt that we shouldn't be spending public
money on just a few kids when all kids need to
be addressed on the perils of drugs and alco
hol," Davis said. "1 also think that when kids
are making these decisions (to abuse drugs
and alcohol) that parents have the right to be
a part of the solution."
This month the new school board members,
Brooks and Chapman, will be seated, and the
policy will be looked at again during the Janu
ary board meeting. The board must have a
two-thirds vote to reinstate the drug-testing
policy.
If board members reinstate the drug-test
ing policy, Davis would like to see the policy be
developed through community members, par
ents, administrators and students.
During the Alexander school board meet
ing Thursday, Bray will make a recommenda
tion to the board concerning a drug-testing
policy.
