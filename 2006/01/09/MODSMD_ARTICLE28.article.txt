### MARIEM QAMRUZZAMAN MICHIGAN DAILY 
(U-WIRE) ANN ARBOR. Mich. â€” As some
students fretted over studying for finals, sopho
more Anthony Pattah drove to Farmington Hills
Manor with his dad and exercised his right to vote.
Pattah and his father were voting in Iraq's land
mark election fora four-year. 275-member Na
tional Assembly.
"It's sending a message to the Arab world that
democracy can work," Pattah said.
Pattah, who is Chaldean, a kind of Christian,
said he wanted to diversify representation in the
government.
"1 voted for the Christian bloc over there." he
said."l also voted because 1 wanted to see my own
people have a part in the government. I thought it
might bring an end to the terrorism."
Voting for Iraqis in the United States took
place from Dec. 13 to 15 and on Dec. 15 in Iraq.
The results of the election have not been an

nounced because of allegations of fraud, intimida
tion and irregularities in the voting. An interna
tional team is currently investigating these com
plaints.
In the United States, as many as 28,500 expatri
ates voted, according to Michael Youash,
spokesman for Iraq Out-of-Country Voting Pro
gram USA.
Expatriates had to meet one of two require
ments to vote. Either they could be 18 years or
older and be able to prove their citizenship to Iraq
or they could prove one of their parents is Iraqi.
Detroit. Dearborn, Washington, Chicago,
Nashville and three cities in California served as
polling stations.
"[The voting process] was much smoother than
we expected and it was done with less resources."
Youash said.
Youash said that most voters in Detroit proba
bly came from Michigan because Dearborn has
the second-largest Iraqi population in the United
States.
Out-of-country voting took place in 15 coun
tries including Australia, Canada. England and
Jordan.
But not everyone took part in the voting

process. LSA senior Sayf Al-katib and his father
decided not to.
"Before I can feel comfortable about voting, I
want to understand why we're in the situation
we're in right now," Al-katib said. "I feel like Pres
ident Bush is advertising the election in a way to
distract the American people from the real issues
of our involvement in Iraq."
Al-katib also said elections in Iraq are being
used to distract the public from probing Bush's
faulty argument that weapons of mass destruction
and terrorist ties made war with Iraq necessary.
"I think my biggest reason for not voting is that
I feel that this election is more of a tool to justify
going to war with Iraq in the first place," he said.'i
obviously am deeply concerned with the future of
Iraq. However, I feel that my right to vote is being
granted solely as a political tool to gain support for
the war."
He added that the last time he visited the coun
try' was 11 years ago, which detaches him from the
situation.
Once results are announced, two-thirds of the
National Assembly of Iraq must vote on a presi
dent, who must then ask the majority party to ap
point a prime minister and other high officials.
