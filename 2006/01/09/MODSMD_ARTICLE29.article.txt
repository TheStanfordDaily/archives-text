## Pets given second chance in retirement home Former pianist creates retirement village for pets 
### GARRETT LOWELL CENTRAL FLORIDA FUTURL 
(U-WIRE) OVIEDO, Fla. — "I used to be a
classical pianist," Florence Thuot said. "Now I
pick up poop."
Thuot is the founder of Journey's End Animal
Sanctuary in Glenwood, a sort of retirement village
for abused,handicapped and"undesirable"animals.
For more than 29 years,Thuot has been opening her
home to these animals, in the belief that all creatures
big and small have a purpose on this earth.
A native of Chile,Thuot moved to Central Flori
da in 1967 when she was 39, finally settling in Glen
wood in 1976 with her husband. The couple origi
nally worked for the sheriff s department as animal
cruelty investigators. "There are laws, but people
don't care about them (laws) because they are only
animals," Thuot said. They left their positions to
pursue a more satisfy ing career: giving unwanted

animals a place to live for the rest of their lives.
After Thuot's husband died, she continued
their work. Thuot "gets depressed about the ani
mals she can't help, but thrives on the ones she
can," according to WESH-TV Ch. 2.
Journey's End sits on five acres of pristine coun
try property that houses more than 150 cats, 49 dogs,
four horses, two pot-bellied pigs and a handful of
clucking roosters. All of the animals are free to roam.
There is a house specifically for the cats, which
can go wherever they wish. Three little dogs live
with the cats because they are more comfortable,
one being a chihuahua and the other two yorkies.
The chihuahua, named Shirley, belonged to a
woman who slipped into a coma in her home and
died the day after she was found. Family members
could not find the dog anywhere until they looked in
the closet.There, huddled in the corner, was Shirley.
The sob stories are endless at Journey's End.
Sailor, a blind yorkie, was found swimming off
the coast of New Smyrna by fishermen. Charlie, a
chocolate lab, was born blind due to genetic de
fects caused by inbreeding at a puppy mill. Dick
ens is blind and deaf. He was found wandering

down the side of a highway.
Scooter was born with cataracts but was saved
from euthanasia by Thuot.
Thuot's best success story involves Precious, a
lhasa mix who was rummaging in a neighbor's
garbage. The neighbor came out and beat the dog
with a stick until he had broken the dog's jaw and
knocked its eye out of the socket. Because the man
was on probation, he was immediately sent back
to jail. Precious lived the rest of her days with
Thuot at Journey's End.
Ihe Web site for Journey's End. rcall.org/journey
send,has a memorial poem for Precious: "Precious, if
tears could build a stairway, and memories a lane. I'd
walk right up to Heaven, and bring you home again."
One of the most inspiring stories at Journey's
End is that of Lelo, a pit mix who was born with
out a pelvic bone. When Lelo arrived, she made
fast friends with an old great dane. The two were
inseparable.The day the great dane died, a 2-year
old basset hound named Joey was dumped at
Thuot's door. Joey was not eligible to stay because
there was nothing wrong with him, but he became
such good friends with Lelo that he stayed.
