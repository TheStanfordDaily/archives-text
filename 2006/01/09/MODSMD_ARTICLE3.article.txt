## 34th annual Stanford World Arts Fair brings goods to campus 
### LOREN NEWMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Throngs of elderly citizens and jewelry hawkers rang in the
holiday season with the 34th annual Stanford World Arts Fair.
The newly renamed event, previously duhhed the Holiday
Crafts Fair, was held in December in and around TVesidder
Memorial Union. Vendors selling everything from Christmas
tchotchkes and birch-bark jewelry boxes to fake Gucci purses
and hand puppets lined the walkways and courtyards at TVesid
der, even invading the Oak Lounge with the clamorous ambi
ence of an old-world market economy complete with dogs on
the prowl for dropped scraps of food.
"This is a chance to let local artisans show off their work,"
said jewelry vendor Francine Fiesel, a six-year veteran of the
fair. "It's mostly community members in the craft fair area, but

it's still a great turnout this after
noon. I'll definitely be coming back
next year."
Members of local communities
are the primary supporters and the
largest group represented at this
event.
"The fair has been successful for
the past 34 years primarily because of
the surrounding Palo Alto communi
ty," said World Arts Fair Director and
Tresidder Union Director Jeanette
Smith-Laws. "However, we need
more components that attract stu
dent residents."
"There are very nice things here,
but some of them are too pricey,"
noted Palo Alto resident and first
time craft fair attendee Elaine Elbis
ery. "There's too much jewelry — it
mesmerizes me. I'd like to buy some
jewelry, but there's just too much, I
can't focus on anything."

Outside on the lawn leading to
White Plaza, international food mer
chants touted their delicacies. Tradi
tional favorites like buffalo wings,
strawberry shortcake and the übiqui
tous kettle corn battled Ghanaian
Afro-Caribbean cuisine for con
sumer dollars.
"The food was mediocre," said
freshman Andy Hall, eating a Sub
way sandwich. "However, the crepes
were not un-delicious."
Complaints about the price of the
goods were common.
"I'm a student, and 1 don't have
the money to go around sampling in
ternational cuisine on the weekends,
especially if I want to try everything,"
said freshman Sonia Poltoratski. "1
mean $7 fora chicken bowl — who
can spend that kind of money? They
should give out more free samples."
Many students had no idea that
the fair was even underway, since it
went relatively unadvertised; the
Stanford events Web site also listed it
as a Friday-only event, even though it
lasted all weekend.
"It's a transition year," Smith-

Laws said. 'This year 1 sort of volun
teered to do the event late in the sea
son, and all the things that we wanted
to do for the fair didn't happen. But
we look forward to doing them next
year."
llie festival's organizers hope to
usher in a new attitude with the fair's
revised title.
"We changed the name to Stan
ford World Arts Festival because we
wanted a name that embraced diver
sity here at Stanford," Smith-Laws
said. "Mainly community members
attend the fair, but we're trying to
add some components that make stu
dents feel like they are a part of the
fail as well. We'd love to have stu
dents volunteer to help make it a bet
ter event."
Regardless of its shortcomings,
the fair was labeled a success by its
organizers, albeit one that leaves
room for further improvement.
"All of the funds that are raised by
the fair go back into the student af
fairs account," Smith-Laws said.
"We're looking forward to next
year."
