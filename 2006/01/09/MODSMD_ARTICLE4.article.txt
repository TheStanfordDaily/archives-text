## Workers stage one day strike Union employees unhappy with medical benefits, strike during finals 
### SARAH BROUDY STAFF WRITER 
Roughly 400 people met in White Plaza in the evening of
Thursday, Dec. 8 to hear if the University workers, part of the
Service Employee International Union (SEIU) Local 715.
would strike to protest the disappointing results of recent con
tract negotiations with the University. Speakers who sat on the
bargaining team, students and a professor all gave speeches
before a pulsing crowd of their peers and members of the fac
ulty who chanted and waved signs reading "we are not second
class employees" and "retirement with dignity."
After an introduction, Kevin Lords of the bargaining team
explained that following six unsuccessful negotiations, "We
have no choice but to move forwards" with the strike. The
crowd echoed the speakers' harsh criticisms of the University
administration. Chris McGilvery, a steward of three years and
veteran bargaining team member, called Stanford corporate
management "a slime campaign of lies and misrepresenta
tion."
"We will go out with dignity and high self-esteem,"
McGilvery added, referring to the strike, "and will come back
to work with everything."
A student representative from the Stanford Labor Action
Coalition (SLAC) and a professor thanked the enthusiastic
crowd and urged the importance of the strike. Religious Stud
ies Prof.Tom Sheehan also expressed his support for the cause.
"An offense to one of us is an offense to all of us," Sheehan
shouted. "Health care and retirement benefits are not a privi
lege or an option to be negotiated, but rather a right. Single
payer insurance and decent retirement are two things that
everyone deserves."
President of the Service Employee International Union
(SEIU) Zev Kvitky explained that the workers are committed
to Stanford and dedicated to the students, but that starting
Monday, Dec. 12, they have a responsibility to strike.
"Join me on Monday," Kvitky said to the crowd, "to stand
united and fight."
Kvitky said union leaders had a very difficult time making
the decision to strike.
"This has been a hard decision; there have to be serious
problems to make this kind of a commitment," he said. "A
strike is never a good thing, but we are obligated to stand up."
After Kvitky's speech, the assembled group marched to
University President Hennessy's office for additional speech
es and to attach a petition to the door. In pairs, the line
stretched from the end of White Plaza to Cubberley Auditori
um. Cheers rang out in both English and Spanish as the pick
eters proceeded from the plaza to the Main Quad.
During the march, Dan Gozeno, a grounds steward and
member of the bargaining team, explained that the workers
are simply trying to secure their futures.

"Medical costs are going up and the
costs keep getting shifted to the work
ers," Gozeno said. "The Stanford posi
tion needs to be contested."
Upon arrival to the Quad, Sonia
Spencer, a service worker at Wilbur
Dining Hall, expressed a similar senti
ment to the group regarding increas
ingly expensive retirement plans.
"We seek a plausible retirement
package that adjusts as the cost of liv
ing rises," Spencer said.
In his closing remarks. Chief Nego
tiator for the Stanford Hospital John
Dalardina ended the rally with unify
ing remarks and a pointed message.
"Let's give the institution in higher
learning a lesson on worker's power,"
he said.
On Monday, a total of 3,(XX) workers
from the Stanford Hospital and the
University will walk off the job starting
at 5 a.m. and will remain on strike for 24
hours.
