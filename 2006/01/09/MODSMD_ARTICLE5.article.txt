## Gov. top aide fired over remarks Schwarzenegger fired Terry Tamminen Dec. 10 
### JAMES HOHMANN WORLD NATION EDITOR 
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger recently
fired a top aide who poked fun at the Bush
administration's environmental record at a
Dec. 7 Memorial Auditorium event on glob
al warming.
The San Francisco Chronicle reported on
Dec. 10 that the governor fired Cabinet Sec
retary Terry Tamminen under heavy pressure
from conservative activists offended by re-
marks he made during his introduc
tion of former Vice President A1
Gore.
Tamminen, a democrat who was
appointed in a show of bipartisanship
after Schwarzenegger's triumph in
the 2003 recall campaign,jokingly list
ed the top "five things President Bush
says he will do the address global
warming."
Tamminen drew chuckles from the
overwhelmingly pro-environment
audience when he said that the presi
dent is considering the invasion of Sil
icon Valley to secure more solar pan
els. Another suggestion was "switch
ing the power on Vice President Dick
Cheney's pacemaker to nuclear
power."
The punchline that sparked both
laughs and cheers — "Wait two years.
President A1 Gore will fix it."
What is striking and largely unre
ported in the major media press cov
erage of Tamminen's removal is that
the cabinet secretary praised the gov
ernor's environmental record, assert
ing that is one that even liberal envi
ronmentalists should be proud of,
leading the nation in its progressive
ness.
The flames of controversy were
fanned when Republican strategist
Dan Schnur posted Tamminen's joke
on his blog.
"The last thing Arnold needs right
now is a top-level adviser suggesting
that the country would benefit from
A1 Gore replacing George Bush in
the White House," he told The Chron
icle.
Aside from the top-five list at the
beginning of the speech, which lasted
roughly six minutes, the former envi
ronmental lobbyist very seriously
broached the environmental chal
lenges confronting California, the
United States and the world as a
whole.
"Am I my brother's keeper?"Tam
minen asked the audience. "We all

agree that if we saw a child about to be
hit by a bus, we would run to save him.
But at the same time we allow the
diesel fuels from the same bus to liter
ally poison our children's lungs."
He invoked the public trust doc
trine and cited alarming statistics il
lustrating environmental damage to
justify- immediate state intervention.
He claimed that KK).(KK) people have
died in the United States alone of pre
ventable air pollution, noting that
there are at least that many brown
field sites in California. Many of Cali
fornia's aquifers have been pumped
dry, he added.
"We must act now, especially with
respect to global warming," he added.
" That is why this past June, Arnold
laid out a roadmap [to deal with car
bon dioxide emissions]... California
now has the most ambitious program
for decreasing electrical production
emissions."
He said the governor would take
further action to prevent global
warming after reading a report to be
issues during the second week of De
cember. He also stated that the Re
publican administration is consider
ing new reporting programs:credit for
early adapters of clean technology; in
creased funding to help the agricul
tural industry; the use of methane
from landfills; and harsher land-use
regulations.
The governor's office announced
in a press release that State and Con
sumer Services Director Fred Aguiar
will replace Tamminen, who will stay
on in an advisory role as special assis
tant for energy and environment tech
nologies.
Partisan comments from the De
mocratic aide elicited ire from conser
vatives partialiy because it came only
days after the governor appointed
Democratic guru Susan Kennedy —
who also served as a senior aide to
Gov. Gray Davis — as his new chief of
staff
Some on the right have abandoned
Schwarzenegger in recent weeks over
a perceived jump to the left following
the crushing defeat of all eight initia
tives in the November special elec
tions.
