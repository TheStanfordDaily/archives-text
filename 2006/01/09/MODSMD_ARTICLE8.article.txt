### JESSE J. HOLLAND ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate De
mocrats on Sunday promised a drawn-out
confirmation and perhaps a filibuster for
Samuel Alito if the Supreme Court nomi
nee evades or refuses to answer their
questions on abortion, presidential war
powers and other issues at this week's
confirmation hearings.
"If he continuously, given his previous
record, refused to answer questions and
hid behind i can't answer this because it
might come before me,' it would increase
the chances of a filibuster," Democrat
Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, a
member of the Senate Judiciary Commit
tee, said on NBC's "Meet the Press."
Democrats say they will not decide
whether to filibuster or try to delay a com
mittee vote until after the committee's
weeklong hearings that begin Monday.
If Democrats attempt a filibuster
based on Alito's answers on abortion, at
least one Republican is ready to vote for
Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist's plan to
ban judicial filibusters.
"I would consider that not only not an ex
traordinary circumstance, but a threat to the
independence of the judiciary, and I would
stop it in its tracks with my vote," said GOP
Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.
Graham, who spoke on "Fox News
Sunday," is one of the 14 senators — seven
from each party — who joined together to
end an earlier Senate showdown of the
stalling tactic for the president's judicial
nominees.
That group of centrist lawmakers decid
ed last year to support such filibusters only
under "extraordinary circumstances."
Republicans say there is no reason to
delay or filibuster Alito, the federal appeals
court judge who is Bush's choice to suc
ceed the retiring Justice Sandra Day O'-
Connor. She often provided the swing vote
on abortion, the death penalty, affirmative
action and other contentious issues.
"I have not seen any rational basis for
filibustering Judge Alito." said the Judi
ciary Committee chairman, GOP Sen.
Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, on CNN's
"Late Edition."
Alito will face at least two days of ques
tioning from senators; the nominee and the
lawmakers planned to give their opening
statements at noon EST on Monday, hours
after Alito's scheduled breakfast meeting
at the White House with the president.
Questioning begins TUesday and is ex
pected to go through at least Thursday.
Specter has called fora Jan. 17 commit
tee vote. But Sen. Patrick Leahy of Ver
mont, the committee's top Democrat,
would not promise that Democrats would
stick to that schedule, which Senate lead
ers hope would lead to a final vote in the
full Senate on Jan. 20.
"Obviously, if he doesn't answer the
questions, then it gets out of my control.
Some senator would move to hold it over.
Let's hope we get all the answers, so that
doesn't happen," Leahy told CBS' "Face
the Nation."
Alito was the White House's second
choice to replace O'Connor, the high
court's first female justice. White House
counsel Harriet Miers withdrew from

Alito, O'Connor starkly different

If confirmed, Alito would succeed the retiring Justice Sandra Day O'-
Connor. O'Connor and Alito have starkly different backgrounds and per
sonal styles. Philosophically, they differ too. O'Connor grew up on an iso
lated ranch in Arizona. Alito is from New Jersey. She's a former politician,
known for her social skills and feistiness. Alito, a former prosecutor, is re
served and scholarly. People get their first in-depth look at Alito when the
Senate Judiciary Committee takes up his nomination with tough questions
about his record on abortion, capital punishment, presidential authority
and other issues that put him at odds with O'Connor. (AP)

consideration after conservatives ques
tioned her judicial philosophy and qualifi
cations for the Supreme Court.
Bush then turned to Alito. a 55-year-old
conservative judge on the 3rd U.S. Court
of Appeals in Philadelphia who previously
worked as a federal prosecutor and a
lawyer for the Reagan administration.
Even with the current debate over the
government's wiretapping without court
approval and other uses of executive au
thority in the fight against terrorism,ahor

tion was expected to be the most con
tentious topic at the hearings.
"I believe that presidential power will
be very, very important," said Specter, an
abortion rights moderate.
But, he added. "I do not think that you
can put aside the issue of a woman's right
to choose. I think that that still, in the pop
ular mind, on day-to-day activities, is still
the bigger question."
Senators who have met privately with
Alito say he told them that 1985 written

comments stating that there was no con
stitutional right to an abortion were part
of a job application for the Reagan ad
ministration, which opposed abortion.
At the same time, he wrote in a sepa
rate legal memo while at the Justice De
partment that the department should try
to chip away at abortion rights rather than
mount an all-out assault.
At least one committee Democrat said
she would consider a filibuster if Alito's
answers lead her to believe that he would
overturn the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v.
Wade decision establishing a woman's
right to an abortion.
"If 1 believed he was going to go in
there and overthrow Roe, the question is
most likely yes," Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-
Calif., told "Fox News Sunday."
It is unlikely that Alito will answer ques
tions about how he would rule on abortion
questions, said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas.
"I expect you'll hear from him what we
heard from Chief Justice John Roberts.
And that is, he respects the decision under
the principles of stare decisis," said
Cornyn. referring to a Latin term for "to
stand by a decision."
