## Burning the duck baggage 
### 
There are three tasks I approach at the beginning
of each new quarter. They are: rearranging the
furniture in my room, curing myself of an un
healthy infatuation with Home and Garden Televi
sion and acknowledging any emotional constructs
that may be preventing me from living a full life.
Not one of these activities is ever completed with
in a reasonable timeframe — I spend countless nights
watching HGTV's "'Simply Quilts" in a makeshift cot,
drooling and wondering why things didn't work out
with so-and-so when 1 am obviously such a stellar
catch. But every season I get a little closer to ridding
my room, mind and heart of various impurities. It is
this last activity in particular — cleansing the heart —
to which I would like to devote this column.
Fall quarter was a strange one for me. A two-year
plus relationship disappeared over the summer, and I
found myself in the unprecedented position of being
single without a safety net or — save fora few no
table exceptions — any interesting prospects on the
horizon. A series of dating disasters convinced me to
engage in some serious introspection, and for the first
time I took inventory of my "emotional baggage."
The term contains a host of negative connota
tions. Occasionally the phrase will conjure up an
image of a sobbing woman carrying mountains of
brown Louis Vuitton luggage, trying desperately to
unload it upon oblivious lovers. But just as luggage is
not by definition brown Louis Vuitton (thank God),
not all emotional baggage is bad.The experiences we
carry with us allow us to view new situations with a
mature and nuanced perspective. It is important to
analyze the emotional scripts ingrained in our psy
che, and discard those that are no longer useful while
retaining ones that provide us with valuable wisdom.
In my case, I realized that one piece of luggage in
particular needs to be burned, and I suggest that the
rest of the Stanford community follow my lead. I am
referring to that goddamn duck analogy. You know
the one I'm talking about. "Stanford students are
like ducks: calm on top, but swimming like mad un
derneath the surface."
SHUT UP. I am not calm on top — I am sweating
through my feathers because I am trying so hard to
make it appear as though I have everything together
when I do not. I do not have a boyfriend, I do not
know what I am doing after graduation and I sure as
hell do not feel comfortable discussing these topics
when everyone is trying to act like an effing duck.
I am sure that the person who invented the stu
dent-duck comparison did not mean to illicit this
level of hostility or to imply that people had to act
like ducks. Unfortunately, this analogy also captures
the fact that some individuals here feel as though it
is inappropriate to display any level of weakness,
failure or vulnerability. As a community of over
achievers, we carry around the deceptively attractive
baggage of success, of knowing how to set goals and
achieve them. Anything less is not to be mentioned.
And honestly, is that really such a bad thing?
Yes. There is an element of vulnerability inherent
in intimacy, and if we refuse to embrace our short
comings — to allow others to get close enough to see
our imperfections — we risk missing out on a huge
part of the human experience. Is this why we are a
campus of random hookups and near-marriage rela
tionships, with hardly anything in between? Because
our overachieving tendencies are so great that we
settle on a risk-averse, all-or-nothing approach to so
cial interaction? What a crappy situation. It's time to
burn the duck baggage, my friends.
Let me be the first to ring in the new year by say
ing I am flawed, I am imperfect and I emote with
every fiber of my being. I am real. I am hungry fora
soul mate but I am also comfortable with my new
found independence. This year I will love tirelessly
and passionately, and maybe I will find others who
will do the same.
Burn the duck baggage. Emotionally unavailable
is so 2(X)5.
