# Want a perfect playlist? Clairvoyant computers come to the rescue
## 
### 
Computers are not supposed to be able to
read your mind, but in today's column we
look at two cases where they come pretty
darn close. The first is Pandora, a new Inter
net radio station that knows what kind of
music you like. The second — 20q.net — lit
erally knows what you're thinking.
MP3 fatigue
With their iPods and mixes, today's music
listeners derive an almost perverse pleasure
through creating the perfect library or
playlist, unique unto themselves.
In this rush for control, however, today's
music listeners often miss out. They forget
that there is a whole world of new or relative
ly unknown music just waiting to be discov
ered. Too many suffer from what I call "mp3
fatigue" — they succumb to complacency,
resigning themselves to the same mp3 library
for months on end. Maybe you know the feel
ing— the world of music marches on, but
you and your playlist are stranded in the past.
The ideal technology would act like a
good friend who knew your music tastes. It
would introduce you to new bands and songs,
but only those that you would most likely
enjoy. Furthermore, it would still afford you

some choice and control over what you lis
tened to. Meet Pandora.com.
Pandora claims to he the result of a music
genome project to classify all aspects of
music based on sound, as opposed to arbi
trary designations of genre, artist or popular
ity. The result is an ad-free Internet radio sta
tion that learns to provide the music that you
like.
Open Pandora's Box
Pandora's nifty interface is a breeze. Log
on to Pandora at http://pandora.com and
give it a band or a song you like. It then cre
ates a radio station with music that hits simi
lar properties. For example, when I go to Pan
dora.com and enter Guster. the site plays a
song by the British group Fiction Plane, rela

tively unfamiliar to people in the United
States. When I ask. Pandora explains why it
plays this song. "We're playing this track be
cause it features basic rock song structures, a
subtle use of vocal harmony, mild rhythmic
syncopation and mixed acoustic instrumen
tation," and so on. Sure enough, I really enjoy
the Fiction Plane song. It has an original
sound, a catchy beat and good lyrics. I then
add the band to my favorites page, where
Pandora.com provides links to purchase the
song from Amazon or iTUnes.
Pandora tops traditional radio and net
radio stations fora variety of other reasons.
First. Pandora delivers stereo music with bet
ter sounding audio quality than any other ad
free net radio station. Second. Pandora has a
"next button," so when you get a song you
don't like,you can skip it.Third.since Pando
ra is based on Flash, all it needs is a browser
with the standard free Flash plug-in. You
need not fuss with downloading Windows
Media Player or Real Player. Pandora's de
signers deserve praise for using Flash to pro
vide an elegant, platform-consistent inter
face that includes album art and a stylish
metallic-brush look. Finally, since Pandora is
entirely Web-based, your radio stations fol
low you from computer to computer.

Live and Learn
Most importantly. Pandora learns as you
use it. For each song, you can give Pandora a
thumbs up or a thumbs down. It then takes
this into account when finding new music.
Pandora claims to "Find Music You'll Love"
— and for me it succeeds. After using Pandora
almost exclusively over the holiday break, I
now have three Pandora stations which consis
tently crank out new music that I like, often
from bands of which I've never even heard.
Pandora is a new service and it has room
for improvement. I've noticed that Pandora
often chooses lesser-known live versions of
popular songs, instead of the regular one
you'd hear on the radio. Also, the Pandora
"next" button isn't unlimited. If you skip
about 10 songs in a short period. Pandora
gives a message saying that you've exceeded
the number of skips its license allows.
But as long as Pandora continues to pro
vide the same high quality music for free,
these minor annoyances pale in comparison
to the benefit of having your very own music
guide at your fingertips.
20 Questions: It reads your mind

The same computer learning technology
that lets Pandora learn your music tastes also
lets the computers at 20q.net heat you at a
game of 20 questions. Although this is almost
entirely useless, it provides a fun peek at the
power of computers to come.
Log on to http://20q.net, think of an ob
ject. answer the following yes/no questions
and see if the computer can read your mind.
My coworker thought of a printer and the
computer guessed it well before the 20
question limit. 1 thought of a record album,
and after 20 questions, the computer came
up with a record player, which is close
enough in my book. Moreover, the more
people who use it.the better it gets at guess
ing. Try it out for yourself — you'll be doing
a service.
Pandora and 20q.net are two examples of
technologies that combine computer learn
ing and the Internet, and will hopefully be
just the tip of the iceberg. The future will
bring more new technologies that learn and
adapt to your very thoughts and tastes.

20 Questions: It reads your mind

The same computer learning technology
that lets Pandora learn your music tastes also
lets the computers at 20q.net heat you at a
game of 20 questions. Although this is almost
entirely useless, it provides a fun peek at the
power of computers to come.
Log on to http://20q.net, think of an ob
ject. answer the following yes/no questions
and see if the computer can read your mind.
My coworker thought of a printer and the
computer guessed it well before the 20
question limit. 1 thought of a record album,
and after 20 questions, the computer came
up with a record player, which is close
enough in my book. Moreover, the more
people who use it.the better it gets at guess
ing. Try it out for yourself — you'll be doing
a service.
Pandora and 20q.net are two examples of
technologies that combine computer learn
ing and the Internet, and will hopefully be
just the tip of the iceberg. The future will
bring more new technologies that learn and
adapt to your very thoughts and tastes.

Computers are not supposed to be able to
read your mind, but in today's column we
look at two cases where they come pretty
darn close. The first is Pandora, a new Inter
net radio station that knows what kind of
music you like. The second — 20q.net — lit
erally knows what you're thinking.
MP3 fatigue
With their iPods and mixes, today's music
listeners derive an almost perverse pleasure
through creating the perfect library or
playlist, unique unto themselves.
In this rush for control, however, today's
music listeners often miss out. They forget
that there is a whole world of new or relative
ly unknown music just waiting to be discov
ered. Too many suffer from what I call "mp3
fatigue" — they succumb to complacency,
resigning themselves to the same mp3 library
for months on end. Maybe you know the feel
ing— the world of music marches on, but
you and your playlist are stranded in the past.
The ideal technology would act like a
good friend who knew your music tastes. It
would introduce you to new bands and songs,
but only those that you would most likely
enjoy. Furthermore, it would still afford you

some choice and control over what you lis
tened to. Meet Pandora.com.
Pandora claims to he the result of a music
genome project to classify all aspects of
music based on sound, as opposed to arbi
trary designations of genre, artist or popular
ity. The result is an ad-free Internet radio sta
tion that learns to provide the music that you
like.
Open Pandora's Box
Pandora's nifty interface is a breeze. Log
on to Pandora at http://pandora.com and
give it a band or a song you like. It then cre
ates a radio station with music that hits simi
lar properties. For example, when I go to Pan
dora.com and enter Guster. the site plays a
song by the British group Fiction Plane, rela

tively unfamiliar to people in the United
States. When I ask. Pandora explains why it
plays this song. "We're playing this track be
cause it features basic rock song structures, a
subtle use of vocal harmony, mild rhythmic
syncopation and mixed acoustic instrumen
tation," and so on. Sure enough, I really enjoy
the Fiction Plane song. It has an original
sound, a catchy beat and good lyrics. I then
add the band to my favorites page, where
Pandora.com provides links to purchase the
song from Amazon or iTUnes.
Pandora tops traditional radio and net
radio stations fora variety of other reasons.
First. Pandora delivers stereo music with bet
ter sounding audio quality than any other ad
free net radio station. Second. Pandora has a
"next button," so when you get a song you
don't like,you can skip it.Third.since Pando
ra is based on Flash, all it needs is a browser
with the standard free Flash plug-in. You
need not fuss with downloading Windows
Media Player or Real Player. Pandora's de
signers deserve praise for using Flash to pro
vide an elegant, platform-consistent inter
face that includes album art and a stylish
metallic-brush look. Finally, since Pandora is
entirely Web-based, your radio stations fol
low you from computer to computer.

Live and Learn
Most importantly. Pandora learns as you
use it. For each song, you can give Pandora a
thumbs up or a thumbs down. It then takes
this into account when finding new music.
Pandora claims to "Find Music You'll Love"
— and for me it succeeds. After using Pandora
almost exclusively over the holiday break, I
now have three Pandora stations which consis
tently crank out new music that I like, often
from bands of which I've never even heard.
Pandora is a new service and it has room
for improvement. I've noticed that Pandora
often chooses lesser-known live versions of
popular songs, instead of the regular one
you'd hear on the radio. Also, the Pandora
"next" button isn't unlimited. If you skip
about 10 songs in a short period. Pandora
gives a message saying that you've exceeded
the number of skips its license allows.
But as long as Pandora continues to pro
vide the same high quality music for free,
these minor annoyances pale in comparison
to the benefit of having your very own music
guide at your fingertips.
