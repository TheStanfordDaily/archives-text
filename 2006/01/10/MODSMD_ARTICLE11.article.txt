Stanford University does a tremen
dous job of giving students of all so
cioeconomic backgrounds equal ac
cess to both the University and its vast re
sources.
Upon acceptance to the University, ad
mitted students can qualify for need-based
financial aid that can cover as much as their
entire undergraduate tuition. After fresh
man year, all returning students are given a
number in"the draw" — a random lottery
that gives every student the same chance at
selecting the best — and worst — housing
on campus.
Yet despite the attempts to equalize ac
cess to Stanford's housing, the University
has not equalized the costs of such housing.
Currently, the price of housing varies
tremendously for students living in different
locations on campus.
For fall quarter 2(X)5, room, board and so
cial dues fora student living in Granada in
Lagunita came to $3,662 ($1,931 for room,
$ 1,691 for board, and $40 for social dues). On
the other end of the spectrum, 680 Loniita
residents paid $3,922 ($2,397 for room,
$1,450 for board, and $75 for social dues)
over the same quarter, a difference of $255.
(The Daily collected board bill and social
dues information from all residence staffs in
self-op row houses who responded to in
quiry. Because co-ops are structured differ
ently and involve much more student in
volvement in their operation, we excluded
them from this survey. All housing costs for
students in dorms can be accessed online at
http://www.stanford.edu/dept/hds/has/tour/
ugtour/reschart/ucresnotes.html)
Instinctively, this doesn't seem to be a
drastic difference, particularly considering
that almost any upperclassman would
choose to live in 680 Lomita over Granada.
However, over the entire academic year this
comes to over $750.
Even if we were to accept the argument
that Row houses should cost more than
dorms (and we don't), the cost of living on
the Row varies substantially.
According to data from the houses that
responded, the cost of board and social
dues on the row for fall quarter 2005 varied
anywhere from $1,200 for Narnia and
$1,217 for La Casa Italiana on the low end
to $1,510 at 717 Dolores and $1,525 at 680
Lomita on the high end. If the difference in
dues were to remain the same over three
quarters, by the end of the year residents at

680 Lomita will have spent $930 more than
residents at Narnia.
Such disparities in housing costs should
be addressed. Ideally, total costs of housing
between room, board and social dues would
be the same in all houses and dorms on cam
pus. and the university should focus on ways
to level the differences in costs. Yet we recog
nize how logistically difficult this is, given the
varying costs of chefs, dining halls and hous
ing styles; that some houses hire hashers
while others do not; and that some houses
feed as few as 25 students, while others feed
well over 60.
Nevertheless, the University should work
to equalize the cost of living on the Row for
future years, and start by increasing publici
ty of such costs.
Because residence staff on the Row are
selected during winter quarter (except for
resident assistants, who are chosen in the
spring). Row staffs should work during
the winter and spring to estimate next
year's board bills and social dues. They
could collaborate with the current resi
dence staff to determine anticipated costs
and estimate dues.
Then, the University needs to publicize
these preliminary dues in the annual draw
guide that comes out in the weeks before the
draw during spring quarter and on the Resi
dence Chart website. Currently, students de
ciding where on the Row to live are not in
formed of what various houses' board bills
and social dues are. The residence website
merely states that for the Row. board bills
"approximate rate [is] $3209-3909 per year."
Not a single self-op row house that re
sponded to inquiry reported combined
board and social dues that were as low as the
low end of this estimate.
Finally, the University should take a hard
look at how much it charges students for
housing. Some students have had great num
bers that would have let them live on the
Row have had to select a dorm to save
money.
The University has proudly proclaimed
that cost should not be a deterrent for quali
fied students choosing to attend Stanford.
Now it should endeavor to ensure that cost
won't be a deterrent for choosing where on
campus they live.
With Row staff selection just around the
corner, we hope the University will consider
these suggestions as preparations for next
year's housing selection process begin.

For fall quarter 2(X)5, room, board and so
cial dues fora student living in Granada in
Lagunita came to $3,662 ($1,931 for room,
$ 1,691 for board, and $40 for social dues). On
the other end of the spectrum, 680 Loniita
residents paid $3,922 ($2,397 for room,
$1,450 for board, and $75 for social dues)
over the same quarter, a difference of $255.
(The Daily collected board bill and social
dues information from all residence staffs in
self-op row houses who responded to in
quiry. Because co-ops are structured differ
ently and involve much more student in
volvement in their operation, we excluded
them from this survey. All housing costs for
students in dorms can be accessed online at
http://www.stanford.edu/dept/hds/has/tour/
ugtour/reschart/ucresnotes.html)
Instinctively, this doesn't seem to be a
drastic difference, particularly considering
that almost any upperclassman would
choose to live in 680 Lomita over Granada.
However, over the entire academic year this
comes to over $750.
Even if we were to accept the argument
that Row houses should cost more than
dorms (and we don't), the cost of living on
the Row varies substantially.
According to data from the houses that
responded, the cost of board and social
dues on the row for fall quarter 2005 varied
anywhere from $1,200 for Narnia and
$1,217 for La Casa Italiana on the low end
to $1,510 at 717 Dolores and $1,525 at 680
Lomita on the high end. If the difference in
dues were to remain the same over three
quarters, by the end of the year residents at

680 Lomita will have spent $930 more than
residents at Narnia.
Such disparities in housing costs should
be addressed. Ideally, total costs of housing
between room, board and social dues would
be the same in all houses and dorms on cam
pus. and the university should focus on ways
to level the differences in costs. Yet we recog
nize how logistically difficult this is, given the
varying costs of chefs, dining halls and hous
ing styles; that some houses hire hashers
while others do not; and that some houses
feed as few as 25 students, while others feed
well over 60.
Nevertheless, the University should work
to equalize the cost of living on the Row for
future years, and start by increasing publici
ty of such costs.
Because residence staff on the Row are
selected during winter quarter (except for
resident assistants, who are chosen in the
spring). Row staffs should work during
the winter and spring to estimate next
year's board bills and social dues. They
could collaborate with the current resi
dence staff to determine anticipated costs
and estimate dues.
Then, the University needs to publicize
these preliminary dues in the annual draw
guide that comes out in the weeks before the
draw during spring quarter and on the Resi
dence Chart website. Currently, students de
ciding where on the Row to live are not in
formed of what various houses' board bills
and social dues are. The residence website
merely states that for the Row. board bills
"approximate rate [is] $3209-3909 per year."
Not a single self-op row house that re
sponded to inquiry reported combined
board and social dues that were as low as the
low end of this estimate.
Finally, the University should take a hard
look at how much it charges students for
housing. Some students have had great num
bers that would have let them live on the
Row have had to select a dorm to save
money.
The University has proudly proclaimed
that cost should not be a deterrent for quali
fied students choosing to attend Stanford.
Now it should endeavor to ensure that cost
won't be a deterrent for choosing where on
campus they live.
With Row staff selection just around the
corner, we hope the University will consider
these suggestions as preparations for next
year's housing selection process begin.
