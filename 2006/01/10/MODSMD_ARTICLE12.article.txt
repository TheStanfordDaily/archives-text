# Winter break with the Facebook
## 
### 
Okay, how many of you spent all of
winter break on Thefacebook.com?
Don't try to deny it; I saw your pro
files on the "recently updated" list day after
day.
Er. I mean...l definitely did not waste
away my entire vacation checking to see
which of my friends developed such a love
for Late Night with Conan O'Brien during
their time at home that they felt com
pelled to add it to their profiles for every
body to see.
Facebook has single-handedly made ob
solete whatever refined procrastination
tools college students of the past used to put
off work. (What did they use?) Pre-meds
have Facebook to thank when they fail their
chemistry midterms â€” instead of studying
polar bonds, they spend the night before the
test studying the variety of Friends groups to
see which one is the best fit for them. (Fact:
There are only three groups for this amazing
TV show, yet the fervent debate over pop
ping one's collar has spawned no fewer than
eight Facebook groups.) The next genera
tion of doctors will have the same solution
for every patient's malady: "Poke him and
see if he responds."
1 won't lie; I'm just as guilty of Facebook
procrastination as the next person. (Fact:
There are 1.446 members in the group
"Stanford Students For Procrastination.")
The hour before my I Hum final, did I cram
as many John Locke quotes into my head as
I possibly could? Did 1 prepare an outline
for my essay? No. I Facebooked. What exact
ly I Facebooked, I couldn't tell you. That
may have been the dtiy that I joined the
group "Lovers and Stealers of Special K
With Red Berries From the Dining Hall!"
(Fact: Special K with Red Berries is the best
cereal known to man.)
Aside from enabling students to cele
brate a shared interest in a certain epicurean
delight, Facebook does have other almost
as-useful features, such as., wait, sorry; I lost
my train of thought. (Fact: Browsing Face
book is more fun than writing a column.)
At any rate. Facebook has been a great
boon to the stalking community here at
Stanford. (Fact: The group "Stalkers
Anonymous" has 41 members.) With just a
first name and a decent memory for faces,
that guy you flirted with at a party becomes
that guy whose dorm you camp outside of
and "coincidentallv" run into on his way to

those are

It's a little bit scary just how easily acces
sible (i.e. stalk-able) a person makes herself
simply by creating a Facebook account.
Sure, it's convenient for your friends to be
able to look up your screenname and phone
number or to share pictures from Friday
night with everyone you know. (On second
thought, maybe that's not such a good
thing...) Facebook is great for keeping in
touch with your partner from last quarter's
group project, the guy from your high school
who you were only semi-friendly with and
that kid you had a random conversation
with while waiting in line at the post office.
But the thought of all of your personal infor
mation in the hands of the wrong person is
downright creepy (see previous paragraph:
add points depending on the sketchiness of
said person).
Nevertheless, everybody seems perfectly
willing to overlook the possibility (which re
mains, as far as I know, entirely theoretical)
that anything but good could ever stem from
the Facebook phenomenon. Despite the fact
that it has pretty much already taken over
the world, it somehow keeps uncovering and
dragging in stragglers; even those most ve
hemently opposed to it at the beginning are
folding under peer pressure. My own sister,
a once firm opponent of Facebook.admitted
that it "might be helpful so I can know who
is in my classes" and succumbed to the giant
amoeba which she had managed to avoid for
so long. God help her.
God help us all.

If you want to get in touch with Stephanie and
are one of the few people without a Facehook
account, e-mail her (and tell her how you sur
vive without it) atsalessi@stanford.edu. If you
do have Facehook, send her a message, and
she will most likelx check and respond to it
within five minutes. Just please don 7 stalk her.
