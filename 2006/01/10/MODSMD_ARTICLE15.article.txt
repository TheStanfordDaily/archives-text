# Christmas with Catholics
## 
### 
My Jewish family has our own special
way of celebrating the holidays —
we get really depressed. I don't even
really have a reason to get quite so de
pressed, but my dad always has, and my
mother gets mad at him for this, and then she
gets depressed about it, so there's an infec
tious vibe of sadness in the house.
We have a fairly traditional Jewish Christ
mas — in the afternoon we go to the movies.
At night we go out for food, either Chinese or
KFC, and then we pile into the family sedan,
barely fitting with all our winter coats and
drive around New York looking for Christ
mas lights. I'm pretty sure my father hates
these affairs. We never quite have a destina
tion in mind and usually end up disappointed
and lost. A few years ago, we discovered
Dyker Heights in Brooklyn, which is where
all the retired Italian mafia mansions are.
These people know how to do Christmas
decorations. It's better than the windows at
Lord & Taylor.
I decided to sidestep this whole ordeal
and spend the first half of my break in Texas,
trying to learn things about America that are
obscured by my upbringing as a New York
Jew. Mostly everything south of the Mason-
Dixon line and everything pertaining to
Christ. I was hoping that spending Christmas
with a Catholic family would give me some
insight about the world that would make me
a better writer. I would've settled for getting
a good story idea out of it too.
Spending time in Austin, however, was not
the way to see the South. Austin is quite pos
sibly the hippest town in the US. Other towns
have HOV or bike lanes — Austin has amu

sician unloading lane. On a random Monday
night I saw better jazz than I did on a Friday
at the Village Vanguard in New York.
Austin is so progressive, they're nearly in
favor of electing Kinky Friedman, the Jewish
Cowboy, for governor. A man who recorded
the classic "They ain't making Jews like Jesus
anymore," a song so offensive, even I de
clined to play it during a two-hour KZSU set
of songs about Jesus. A man whose campaign
slogans include "Why the hell not?" and
"How hard could it be?" However, he has my
vote for his "No teacher left behind" plan. No
Child Left Behind deserves ridicule and
teachers need better salaries, more respect
and more freedom not to teach to a test. Ride
'em, Jewish Cowboy.
University of Texas at Austin is so hard
core that their drag is populated by gutter
punks. I love gutterpunks. I almost wanted to
give them hugs for being so dedicated to
counterculture — then I realized how often
they probably shower and thought better of
it. The town is so cool that all the thrift shops
got together to make a map for visiting hip
sters to find their way to every bizarre vin
tage nook.
Thrift shops and me don't get along as

well as I'd like, though. Whenever 1 walk into
one I get the distinct sense that I'm neither
cool enough to he there ironically nor poor
enough to be there out of necessity, so I end
up feeling like a jerk for wanting to buy a suit
for the sole purpose of wearing it to co-op
parties. There's a paradoxical minimum bar
to entry: you need to already look the part to
walk in the door. If you're not wearing a vin
tage t-shirt and a beat up sports jacket, the
other hipsters will engage you in a contest of
sneering and looking disaffected at the same
time, until I'm forced to leave like a disgraced
Alpha Male. I always find myself wondering
why the clothing is there in the first place.
This is a dangerous mental game to play. Did
the last owner use it to mop up carcinogens?
Did they have lice? BO?
The only Texan part of the trip was driving
three hours immediately after getting off the
plane (making this drive to see a theatrical
satirical lounge act was not). Three hours is
apparently not a long drive when you live in
a state larger than most sovereign nations.
And everyone in Texas makes that drive in a
giant truck. I saw Ford F-series trucks that
looked large enough to have four-digit model
numbers.
Oh, and eating at Whataburger. It's like
In-N-Out with an actual menu — not as
good, but open 24 hours a day and located
about every 5 miles on major highways.
Whataburger is so beloved by Texans that it
was declared a "Texas Treasure" by the state
legislature (a governmental body designed
for maximum inefficiency by only meeting
