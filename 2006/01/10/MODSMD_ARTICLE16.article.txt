Response to Boardman e-mail
This open letter to Dean of Students Greg
Boardman was initially sent on Saturday.
Dec. 10, in regards to the strike. He sent an e
mail to the student body addressing concerns
relating to the demands of the striking work
ers.
Dean Boardman.
I am shocked and disappointed that you have
abused your technological privileges to
broadcast a one-sided representation of the
administration's dispute with our workers.
The workers and their bargaining unit do not
have the ability to send university-wide

broadcast e-mails. Indeed, this sort of lop
sided access to institutional channels is pre
cisely why workers and their advocates have
had to opt for direct actions such as the
strike.
1 have formed close friendships with
workers during my time at Stanford, and I
have seen firsthand the dishonorable way in
which the administration approaches labor
negotiations and fails to honor their results. I
am aware that campus workers' complaints
are many, serious and legitimate. I have the
utmost respect and sympathy for the work
ers' last-resort decision to strike.
Your e-mail to the entire student body,
and possibly others, is a shameful attempt to
maintain administrative hegemony over a

campus community that is comprised prima
rily of students and workers. I want to hear
from the students. I want to hear from the
workers. Furthermore. 1 have never given
permission to the administration to contact
me personally regarding its political posi
tions. Please offer the workers and their ad
vocates the opportunity to send a reciprocal
broadcast e-mail. And please desist immedi
ately from making myself and others the in
voluntary recipients of unsolicited political
missives.
