## College refs need to be judged 
### 
If you were an incompetent col
lege football official, it was not a
great holiday season. Odds were
you made an incorrect game-chang
ing call, on national television, and
were then subject to the contempt of
the viewing audience and the right
eous anger of about one hundred
football players.
Let's begin with the Alamo Bowl,
the nadir of college officiating. A ref
crew from the Sun Belt Conference
was assigned to the game. But the
Sun Belt is a league that doesn't use
replay review — ostensibly because
it's not on TV enough — and is so
small that its champion once went to
a bowl game with a losing record.
The game was under Big Ten/Big
12 rules. Television replay can exam
ine and correct mistaken calls by the
officiating crew. Unlike the NFL.
coaches do not challenge; all replays
are initiated by an observer in the
booth.
This system had never been seen
to fail in college football — until
that night. A called touchdown that
was actually an incomplete pass was
not reviewed until Michigan coach
Lloyd Carr called a timeout, after
which the touchdown was over
turned. It was later revealed that the
observer tried to call fora review but
the signaling mechanism was not
working properly and the ref crew
had never used replay before.
The same sort of event happened
later in the second half, causing
Michigan to be deprived of two
timeouts that it could have used
when Nebraska ran the clock in the
fourth quarter. Nebraska also got
away with blatant pass interference
in the end zone as Michigan failed
— thanks to the officials —to get
the go-ahead score.
Those who follow Michigan foot
ball are no strangers to poor officiat
ing. The 1979 Rose Bowl refs award
ed USC's Charles White a touch
down when he in fact had fumbled
the ball away to the U-M defense.
But the frequency and effect of bad
calls in the Alamo Bowl was a clear
instance of officials deciding the
football game.
Therefore, the farce that marred
the game's final play might be de
scribed as fitting. As Michigan em
ployed a multi-lateral strategy re
calling The Play, Nebraska's entire
team spilled out onto the field with
the ball still alive. This should have
drawn an illegal participation penal
ty. As the play came to a close, some
Michigan players came off the side
line as well, and offsetting penalties
could have been assessed. Or the of
ficials could have done the most
