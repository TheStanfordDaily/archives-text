## College refs need to be judged 
### 
If you were an incompetent col
lege football official, it was not a
great holiday season. Odds were
you made an incorrect game-chang
ing call, on national television, and
were then subject to the contempt of
the viewing audience and the right
eous anger of about one hundred
football players.
Let's begin with the Alamo Bowl,
the nadir of college officiating. A ref
crew from the Sun Belt Conference
was assigned to the game. But the
Sun Belt is a league that doesn't use
replay review — ostensibly because
it's not on TV enough — and is so
small that its champion once went to
a bowl game with a losing record.
The game was under Big Ten/Big
12 rules. Television replay can exam
ine and correct mistaken calls by the
officiating crew. Unlike the NFL.
coaches do not challenge; all replays
are initiated by an observer in the
booth.
This system had never been seen
to fail in college football — until
that night. A called touchdown that
was actually an incomplete pass was
not reviewed until Michigan coach
Lloyd Carr called a timeout, after
which the touchdown was over
turned. It was later revealed that the
observer tried to call fora review but
the signaling mechanism was not
working properly and the ref crew
had never used replay before.
The same sort of event happened
later in the second half, causing
Michigan to be deprived of two
timeouts that it could have used
when Nebraska ran the clock in the
fourth quarter. Nebraska also got
away with blatant pass interference
in the end zone as Michigan failed
— thanks to the officials —to get
the go-ahead score.
Those who follow Michigan foot
ball are no strangers to poor officiat
ing. The 1979 Rose Bowl refs award
ed USC's Charles White a touch
down when he in fact had fumbled
the ball away to the U-M defense.
But the frequency and effect of bad
calls in the Alamo Bowl was a clear
instance of officials deciding the
football game.
Therefore, the farce that marred
the game's final play might be de
scribed as fitting. As Michigan em
ployed a multi-lateral strategy re
calling The Play, Nebraska's entire
team spilled out onto the field with
the ball still alive. This should have
drawn an illegal participation penal
ty. As the play came to a close, some
Michigan players came off the side
line as well, and offsetting penalties
could have been assessed. Or the of
ficials could have done the most

drastic of moves — awarded Michi
gan a touchdown, as happened in the
1950 Cotton Bowl where an Alaba
ma player came off the sideline to
tackle a runner headed for the end
zone.
None of these happened. What
was the right call will be a matter of
discussion for seasons to come.
However, it is obvious that any
course of action on the part of the ze
bras was better than simply pretend
ing that play was proceeding unmo
lested.
What was really ironic about that
situation is that refs constantly im
plore coaches and players to "back it
up" on the sideline.
The insanity continued into 2006.
Alabama was awarded a touchdown
on a pass play wherein the receiver's
knee was down when he caught the
ball.The Crimson Tide kicked a field
goal as time expired fora 13-10 win.
In the Outback Bowl, lowa was
the second Big Ten team to be
thwarted by the ref crew, as a suc
cessful onside kick was wrongly
overturned for an alleged offsides
player. Even the Rose Bowl was
controversial — on a play that went
fora touchdown, Texas' Vince
Young pitched the ball with his knee
down. No review took place, with the
equipment excuse again being of
fered. (Why multiple redundant sys
tems were not present has not been
discussed, but given the magnitude
of the game, any explanation is unac
ceptable.)
What would have happened had
these calls been made correctly can
not be predicted; however, it is cer
tain that the games' results would
have been more credible to the pub
lic at large.
Finally, there was the Gator

Bowl, where Virginia Tech quarter
back Marcus Vick cleated an oppo
nent's leg. He was not penalized for
this crass and unsportsmanlike act,
as officials claimed not to have wit
nessed it. (Vick was dismissed from
the team last week, and declared for
the NFL Draft shortly thereafter.)
Games are getting too big tar
nished by officiating mistakes. We
are talking about the athletic arms of
public institutions, toting the clout of
their respective states. In the case of
the Rose Bowl, it was the national
championship of the sport, where
close to $30 million was awarded to
the two conferences.
There are too many calls being
blown. These officials are being sent
all across the country to run big
games and their mistakes are im
pacting the credibility of college
football. Some of this is inevitable —
with today's game going at lightning
speed, no change can fully eliminate
human error in officiating.
Ttoo related concepts, however,
can be more fully realized — ac
countability and transparency. The
ratings and records of officiating
crews should be logged, along with
controversial calls and conference
reprimands, and made available to
the public. Fans and (more impor
tantly) the media can then judge for
themselves any possible incompe
tence, bias or favoritism on the part
of officials. And maybe some of
these officials need to be booted off
the crew if their fingerprints are on
too many games.
With the myriad rules that run
NCAA sports, there is no reason for
officials to escape public oversight.
Until we know officials are being
held accountable for their mistakes,
we will have no choice but to assume
that they are getting away with blow
ing games.

If you were an incompetent col
lege football official, it was not a
great holiday season. Odds were
you made an incorrect game-chang
ing call, on national television, and
were then subject to the contempt of
the viewing audience and the right
eous anger of about one hundred
football players.
Let's begin with the Alamo Bowl,
the nadir of college officiating. A ref
crew from the Sun Belt Conference
was assigned to the game. But the
Sun Belt is a league that doesn't use
replay review — ostensibly because
it's not on TV enough — and is so
small that its champion once went to
a bowl game with a losing record.
The game was under Big Ten/Big
12 rules. Television replay can exam
ine and correct mistaken calls by the
officiating crew. Unlike the NFL.
coaches do not challenge; all replays
are initiated by an observer in the
booth.
This system had never been seen
to fail in college football — until
that night. A called touchdown that
was actually an incomplete pass was
not reviewed until Michigan coach
Lloyd Carr called a timeout, after
which the touchdown was over
turned. It was later revealed that the
observer tried to call fora review but
the signaling mechanism was not
working properly and the ref crew
had never used replay before.
The same sort of event happened
later in the second half, causing
Michigan to be deprived of two
timeouts that it could have used
when Nebraska ran the clock in the
fourth quarter. Nebraska also got
away with blatant pass interference
in the end zone as Michigan failed
— thanks to the officials —to get
the go-ahead score.
Those who follow Michigan foot
ball are no strangers to poor officiat
ing. The 1979 Rose Bowl refs award
ed USC's Charles White a touch
down when he in fact had fumbled
the ball away to the U-M defense.
But the frequency and effect of bad
calls in the Alamo Bowl was a clear
instance of officials deciding the
football game.
Therefore, the farce that marred
the game's final play might be de
scribed as fitting. As Michigan em
ployed a multi-lateral strategy re
calling The Play, Nebraska's entire
team spilled out onto the field with
the ball still alive. This should have
drawn an illegal participation penal
ty. As the play came to a close, some
Michigan players came off the side
line as well, and offsetting penalties
