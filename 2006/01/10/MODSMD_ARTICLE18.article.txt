# Cardinal Women's Basketball The Rundown
## Cardinal take 76-64 win Second conference game of new year places Stanford atop the Pac-10 women's standings 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sophomore guard Candice Wiggins and the Stanford
women's basketball squad trailed for most of their Sat
urday contest at Oregon. But the No. 16 Cardinal were
able to keep the gap small, and, on the strength of Wig
gins' career-high 37 points, surged ahead in the final five
minutes fora 76-64 victory.
The Cardinal (10-4, 5-1 Pacific-10 Conference)
jumped to a 15-5 advantage, but Oregon (10-4. 1-3)
closed the first half strong to take a 37-30 halftime lead.
However, the seven-point edge would be Oregon's
largest.
Stanford mounted a comeback in the second half, and
with four minutes to go, a key Wiggins three-pointer ex
tended Stanford's lead to 64-60. Senior guard Krista
Rappahahn added another three, and Oregon would not
threaten again.
"Three-pointers can really kill the other team's mo
mentum, especially when they're made back-to-back,"

Rappahahn said.
"They [Oregon]
panicked," Cardinal
head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "They
took some quick shots
under the press, and we
were able to capitalize. I
think that was the thing
that turned it around."
Oregon began to
foul in the last two min
utes but Stanford made
six of eight free throws to
close out the game.
Wiggins' record day
against the Ducks came
on the heels of another
15 point game in Thurs
day's 80-60 win over
Oregon State. For those
two performances, Wig
gins was named the Pac
-10 Player of the Week.
"I think she's really
been a great leader all
season," VanDerveer

of baskets, hut I think she's done a great job as a leader
all year, even when she doesn't score that much."
Junior forward Brooke Smith added 15, combining
with Wiggins to account for more than two-thirds of
Stanford's total. This caused the team to look for some
one to step up as a third high-scorer.
"I think Krista Rappahahn's been doing that for us,"
VanDerveer said. "She's been very steady. She hit a big
basket at the end of the game â€” a big three. I think that
she's really been doing well."
Rappahahn finished with 10 points on the night.
"I'm trying my best to fill the role my team needs me
to play," she said. "Right now I'm focusing on knocking
down the three and playing solid defense."
VanDerveer expects to see more not only from Rap
pahahn but from many of the players.
"I really think that in another month we'll be getting
the kind of contributions we want from some real key
people," she said. "Roz [Rosalyn Gold-Onwude], Jillian
