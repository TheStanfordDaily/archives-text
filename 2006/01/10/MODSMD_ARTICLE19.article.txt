# Stanford wrestling rebounds at Lone Star Duals after weak tourney results
## Blake and Gardner put forth strong performances to keep Cardinal afloat 
### DENIS GRIFFIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Over winter break, Stanford
wrestlers continued to gear up for the
heart of the season with competition in
three events: the Reno Tournament of
Champions, the Midlands Tournament
in Evanston. 111., and the Lone Star
Duals in Grand Prairie,Tex.
Strong individual performances by
senior Ray Blake and sophomore Tan
ner Gardner helped carry the team
again. Solid team performance in the
Lone Star Duals provided some meas
ure of hope for Stanford, as the team
moves into dual-meet competition.
Stanford started strong at Reno on
Dec. 18 with eight of 10 Cardinal
wrestlers winning their opening matches
before struggling later in the day.
Stanford did manage to place two
wrestlers, though, as Blake took fourth
place in the 165-pound weight class and
Gardner took fifth at 125. Blake and
Gardner continued their run of early
success, and their overall records im

proved to 22-8 and 18-5, respectively.
Other notable performances at Reno
included those by sophomore Scott
Loescher at 157 pounds and senior
Brennan Corbett at 174. each of whom
came within one bout of placing.
The Cardinal traveled to Northwest
ern to participate in the Midlands tour
nament on Dec. 29-30. Gardner and
Blake again were the only two Stanford
wrestlers to place, with each taking fifth
overall.
This continued the duo's run of tour
nament success: Blake has placed in five
of his six tournaments, and Gardner in
five of five.
Midlands marked the end of the early
season tournament run for Stanford.
The Cardinal schedule then shifted into
high gear with the Lone Star Duals on
Jan. 7.
Several Cardinal wrestlers said dual
meets will provide more team-oriented
competition, better revealing where they
stand as a whole with regard to Pacific-10
Conference and national competition.
Rebounding from the disappointing
results of the previous two tournaments,
Stanford put forth a strong showing in
Texas. The Cardinal squad competed
against three other strong squads and
collected two team victories.
"We started off well against Army,
and then we didn't wrestle well against

North Carolina." Stanford head coach
Kerry McCoy said. "But we finished
strong [against Harvard] because we
wrestled well as a team.This is good mo
mentum for us as we get ready for Illi
nois next week."
The Cardinal bracketed a 21-10 loss
to the North Carolina Tar Heels and
notched victories over Army, 22-16, and
Harvard, 21-16.
Blake and Gardner, who went 3-0
and 2-0 for the day, respectively, were
matched in their success by sophomore
Josh Zupancic. The Zupan
cic won all three of his bouts in over
time, sealing both victories for the Car
dinal and closing the UNC match out
with a win.
Other performances of note included
freshman Jared Boyer's first dual meet
victory of his collegiate career against
Army's Michael Sprigg in the 285-pound
weight class. True freshman T\ler Parker
nearly posted an upset over No. 14 Max
Meltzer of Harvard at 141 pounds.
Between now and Feb. 15, the Cardi
nal are scheduled to compete in 10 dual
meet events before the season culmi
nates at the Pac-10 Championships.
These meets will determine the out
come of Stanford's season.
Stanford wrestling opens its home
schedule at Burnham Pavilion this Sun
day against No. 4 Illinois at 1 p.m.
