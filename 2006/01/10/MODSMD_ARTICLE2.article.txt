# 853 students admitted early
## Over 4,000 applied through early program 
### MANDY KOVACH STAFF WRITER 
In its third year, the non-binding
Single Choice Early Action (SCEA)
program offered admission to 853 stu
dents for the Class of 2010. With an
applicant pool of 4,503, the admission
committee saw an increase in applica
tions of about 4 percent from last year.
Richard Shaw, the newly appoint
ed dean of admission and financial
aid, said he was pleased with the
strength of the applicant pool.
"We saw a wonderful group of ap
plicants this year," he said. "Students
that apply early are generally very en
thusiastic about Stanford, and this is
evident in their applications."
Despite the 4 percent rise seen in

the early applicant pool, Shaw said
that the number of applications re
ceived early has stabilized over the
past few years.
"When SCEA was first imple
mented three years ago. the number
of applicants who applied increased
considerably, almost doubling," Shaw
said in an interview with Hie Daily.
"This increase was similar at Yale
when the SCEA program was first im
plemented there. Since then, the early
applicant pools have stabilized.
Should this trend continue, there is no
foreseeable reason to change either
the process or the criteria the Admis
sion Committee uses to sort applica
tions."
According to Shaw, the criteria the
admission committee looks for in a
successful SCEA candidate does not
differ from that of a regular candidate.
"In both applicant pools, the same

information is used," he said. "The
most important thing is the academic
record â€” the rigor of courses, the
number of courses and what courses
were available to that student. In ad
dition, we look at test scores The op
portunity to go well beyond the statis
tics and essays are also factors. We
look at what a student has done out
side the classroom. Finally, we look at
recommendations. This is the same
process we use for the regular appli
cant pool."
This year, the pool of 4,503 was
very diverse. The regular applicant
pool, which is usually around 20,000,
however, tends to be even more di
verse. A number of factors con
tribute to this, including those stu
dents who choose to apply during the
regular cycle because of financial aid.
"Between the early and the regu
lar cycles, we are confident that the
Class of 2010 will be a wonderfully
diverse and strong class," Shaw said.
The SCE A system is also popular
among schools like Harvard and
Yale. The 4,503 students who chose
to send early applications to Stan
ford could only apply early to Stan
ford. However, this is nonbinding in
that the student may apply during
the regular application cycle to other
schools, and still has until May 1 to
make a final decision.
"I am very much a believer in the
system," Shaw said. "The former in
stitution I served, Yale, is also under
going the same considerations for
the SCEA program. Both schools
have been pleased. It encourages stu
dents to apply but doesn't lock them
in. It also helps students who want to
take financial aid into account in
making their final decisions. It gives

students more time to make an im
portant choice. It has worked very
well over the past few years and it is
now an officially recognized pro
gram."
Stanford has already benefitted
from Shaw's recent arrival on cam
pus. In this first cycle of applications, a
new evaluation system was imple
mented. All processes are now Web
based and all applications are read
on-line. It is the first year a paperless
application process has been in place.
"A lot of things are happening this
year," Shaw said. "A new committee
evaluation system was implemented,
which notifies students via the world
wide Web. About 90 percent of the
application pool received a decision
within 24-48 hours of submitting
their application online. This was fol
lowed up with an important notifica
tion with a hard copy. This system is
much better because it's so much
more accessible."
Shaw said he also seeks to achieve
long-term goals. In the next few
years, he plans to make a major com
mitment to national outreach.
"We are competing effectively for
the brightest students nationally and
world wide," he said. "We need to
reach out to these students."
Sophomore Anne Barry, among
the first to be admitted under the rel
atively new SCEA program, said she
was enthusiastic about the system.
"This system provides an oppor
tunity for Stanford to reach out to
many different students, including
those who are taking financial aid
into consideration, and those who
are not sure by Nov. 1 where they
want to go to school," Barry said. "It
gives them a chance to apply to top
schools and explore other options.
The only thing I didn't like was the
"Single Choice' aspect. Allowing stu
dents to apply to other schools early
would eliminate a lot of stress that
students face in this process"
