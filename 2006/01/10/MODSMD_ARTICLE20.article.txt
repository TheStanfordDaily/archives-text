## Gates takes all 50 votes in All-Pro balloting Colts, Seahawks get four All-Pros; Manning to start at QB 
### BARRY WILNER AP FOOTBALL WRITER 
(AP) â€” San Diego's Antonio Gates was the only
unanimous choice to The Associated Press 2005 All-
Pro team featuring four players each from confer
ence leaders Indianapolis and Seattle.
The Chargers' brilliant tight end drew all 50 votes
in balloting by a nationwide panel of sports writers
and broadcasters who cover the NFL. Gates also
made the team last year, with 32 1/2 votes.
He's joined by NFL Most Valuable Player Shaun
Alexander. The Seattle running back, who also won
the AP Offensive Player of the Year award, received
49 votes. And Chicago linebacker Brian Urlacher,
the Defensive Player of the Year, also was chosen on
49 ballots.
"This whole season was a blessing," said Urlach
er, who rebounded from leg injuries in 2004 to lead
the Bears to the NFC North crown.
Alexander made the team for the first time, while
Urlacher was chosen for the third.
Peyton Manning was the All-Pro quarterback for
the third straight time, getting 37 votes. He was
joined by Colts center Jeff Saturday, defensive end
Dwight Freeney and safety Bob Sanders. It was the
first selection for Saturday and Sanders and the sec
ond for Freeney.
"There's no question the last three years have been
the three best of my career," Manning said. "To do it
three years in a row, I really take a lot of pride in it, and
I have some good coaching and some good help."
The other Seahawks were tackle Walter Jones,
guard Steve Hutchinson and fullback Mack Strong.
Jones made it for the third time. Hutchinson for the
second and Strong for the first.
"I came in and I had a bunch of 100-yard games
real quick," Alexander said. "I felt like, gosh, I didn't
feel like I was really running that hard. I went back
and studied the film, and I realized it was because
Mack would block his guy, and they would take that
guy out because he had a migraine. And they'd bring
in the backup, then the backup wouldn't really want
to tackle me because he was worried about getting
blocked by Mack."
No other team had more than two All-Pros. Den
ver, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, San Diego, Tampa Bay,
Chicago and the New York Giants each had two.
Carolina, Arizona, Buffalo, New England, Kansas
City and Houston each had one.TheTexans' kick re
turner, Jerome Mathis, was the only rookie selected.
"I would not have imagined having this good of a
rookie season, but this is a great honor." Mathis said.
"And I look forward to having a better 2006."
Panthers wide receiver Steve Smith, who shared
the AP Comeback Player of the Year honor with Pa
triots linebackerTedy Bruschi, received 44 votes. The
other wideout was the Bengals' Chad Johnson.
In all, there were 16 representatives from the
AFC and 12 from the NFC.
