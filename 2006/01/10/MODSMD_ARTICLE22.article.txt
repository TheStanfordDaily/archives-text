## Peter Haas dies at 86; University mourns 
### AMNA AZIZ 
When the late Peter Haas was asked why his
family was so generous with their money, he
replied, "If we had money, it was really not ours
alone. It was our obligation to use it wisely to help
others."
Haas illustrated this sentiment throughout his
life. Even upon his death, his family has requested
that donations be made to the San Francisco Mu
seum of Modern Art or to the Child Care Facilities
Fund of the Low Income Investment Fund in lieu
of flowers. I laas died on Dec. 3,2(M)5 from natural
causes at the age of 86.
Though he was a Berkeley alumnus, Haas be
came actively involved with Stanford when he
served on the Board of Trustees from 1971 to 1981
and as a member of the Major Gifts Committee
from 1983 to 1986. He was quoted in a memorial
speech given by former University President Ger
hard Casper as saying.'One of the great honors of
my life has been being on the Board of Stanford.
How it happened I've never been sure. It was like
leading a schizophrenic existence."
When Stanford was in need of an endowment
for its new program, the Center for Public Service,
the Haas family stepped in and donated a $5 mil
lion endowment along with a $1.2 million gift from
the Miriam and Peter Haas Fund to establish the
Miriam and Peter Haas Centennial Professorship
in Public Service in 1986.'I"his fund, along with the
Walter and Flise I laas Fund, endowed the Peter E.
Haas Directorship for the Center in 2004. In
recognition of the I laas family's support, the cen
ter was renamed the I laas Center for Public Ser
vice in 1989.
Haas left behind a legacy of both personal and
corporate social responsibility upon his death. As
the former president and chief executive officer of
Levi Strauss & Co.. I laas set an example for other
corporations by operating a successful firm with
high standards. During his six-decade career with
Levi Strauss, he transformed the company from a
small manufacturer of western apparel to an inter-

Haas "made many
contributions, but
they are not likely to
be trumpeted since
they were done
quietly."

nationally recognized clothing brand.
Using the company's economic leverage, Haas
told local community officials in the 1940s and
1950s that the company would only open factories
in the South if blacks were granted equal status
with white workers.
"He played a very progressive role in race rela
tions in the South,"stated UC-Berkeley Prof."!le
used Levi's economic leverage to bring about so
cial change in a way that was not easy but was very
important."
In 1953, Time magazine named Peter and his
elder brother. Walter Haas Jr. as "Leaders of To
morrow."
Haas was born in San Francisco on Dec. 20,
1918, the second of three children born to Elise
Stern Haas and Walter A. Haas Sr. He graduated

with a bachelor's degree in economics from UC-
Berkeley in 1940. His poor eyesight kept him from
enlisting to fight in World War 11, and he went on
to graduate cum laude as a Baker Scholar from
Harvard Graduate School of Business Adminis
tration in 1943, according to the Stanford New Ser
vice.
Although initially reluctant to join the family
business, Haas — the great grand-nephew of Levi
Strauss — began working for Levi Strauss & Co in
1945 and learned to make jeans at the Valencia
Street factory in San Francisco.The factory and its
workers soon became one of his key interests,
leading him to spend time in the company's manu
facturing plants across the country and around the
globe. Robert Haas, nephew and current chairman
of the board at Levi Strauss & Co., said in a Los
Angeles Times article that his uncle was happiest
"walking the floor of a plant and greeting people."
Haas also gave generously to his alma mater
and established the Miriam and Peter Haas Fund
with his wife, through which millions of dollars are
donated to provide San Francisco's low-income
children and their families with access to early
childhood development programs, and to support
the arts, public policy programs and health and
human services.
According to Civil and Environmental Engi
neering Prof. Leonard Ortolano, the holder of the
Peter E. Haas Directorship at the Haas Center,
Haas "made many contributions, but they are not
likely to be trumpeted since they were done qui
etly." Haas was more interested in serving the
public good than in receiving recognition for his
efforts.
"Throughout his career and in his personal life,
my uncle Peter distinguished himself with his
strong values and generosity," said Robert Haas.
"His business accomplishments are a testament to
his belief that you can both operate a successful
company and have a positive impact on the com
munity. Peter cared deeply about our employees,
expressing great respect and concern for them, and
he also had a tremendous interest in social justice."

Using the company's economic leverage, Haas
told local community officials in the 1940s and
1950s that the company would only open factories
in the South if blacks were granted equal status
with white workers.
"He played a very progressive role in race rela
tions in the South,"stated UC-Berkeley Prof."!le
used Levi's economic leverage to bring about so
cial change in a way that was not easy but was very
important."
In 1953, Time magazine named Peter and his
elder brother. Walter Haas Jr. as "Leaders of To
morrow."
Haas was born in San Francisco on Dec. 20,
1918, the second of three children born to Elise
Stern Haas and Walter A. Haas Sr. He graduated

with a bachelor's degree in economics from UC-
Berkeley in 1940. His poor eyesight kept him from
enlisting to fight in World War 11, and he went on
to graduate cum laude as a Baker Scholar from
Harvard Graduate School of Business Adminis
tration in 1943, according to the Stanford New Ser
vice.
Although initially reluctant to join the family
business, Haas — the great grand-nephew of Levi
Strauss — began working for Levi Strauss & Co in
1945 and learned to make jeans at the Valencia
Street factory in San Francisco.The factory and its
workers soon became one of his key interests,
leading him to spend time in the company's manu
facturing plants across the country and around the
globe. Robert Haas, nephew and current chairman
of the board at Levi Strauss & Co., said in a Los
Angeles Times article that his uncle was happiest
"walking the floor of a plant and greeting people."
Haas also gave generously to his alma mater
and established the Miriam and Peter Haas Fund
with his wife, through which millions of dollars are
donated to provide San Francisco's low-income
children and their families with access to early
childhood development programs, and to support
the arts, public policy programs and health and
human services.
According to Civil and Environmental Engi
neering Prof. Leonard Ortolano, the holder of the
Peter E. Haas Directorship at the Haas Center,
Haas "made many contributions, but they are not
likely to be trumpeted since they were done qui
etly." Haas was more interested in serving the
public good than in receiving recognition for his
efforts.
"Throughout his career and in his personal life,
my uncle Peter distinguished himself with his
strong values and generosity," said Robert Haas.
"His business accomplishments are a testament to
his belief that you can both operate a successful
company and have a positive impact on the com
munity. Peter cared deeply about our employees,
expressing great respect and concern for them, and
he also had a tremendous interest in social justice."
