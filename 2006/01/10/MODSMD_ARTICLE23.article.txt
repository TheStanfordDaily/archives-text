## Congress approves bill to cut funding 
### EMILY MARTIN DAILY BRUIN 
(U-WIRE) â€” In one of the last votes of 2005,
Congress showed approval fora bill which would
cut funding for government-sponsored student
loan programs by $12.7 billion.
Dubbed the "reconciliation bill," the measure
would include a $12.7 billion cut from student
loans to combat the federal deficit and fund tax
cuts.
The House approved the bill before the holiday
break in December, and the Senate approved the
bill by a narrow margin of 51 to 50, with Vice Pres
ident Dick Cheney breaking the tie. Because the
Senate made small changes before passing the bill,
it will return to the House fora final vote after the
winter recess, which could come as late as Febru
ary. If passed by the House, President Bush is ex
pected to sign the bill.
Because the bill is likely to pass, the Undergrad
uate Students Association Council is focusing on
preventing student fee increases, in order to reduce
the reliance on student loans.
The student loan cuts are part of a $40 billion

package to reduce the federal deficit and are the
largest cuts in the history of the student federal
loan programs.
The reconciliation hill would raise interest rates
on student and parent loans and cut government
subsidies to private lenders.
In the University-of California, 67,000 of over
200,000 students take out federal loans and will be
affected by these hikes in interest rates, said USAC
Internal Vice President Jeannie Biniek.
She said the legislation would increase interest
rates from 4.7 percent to 6.8 percent and result in
an average debt increase of $5,8(X) per student re
ceiving loans.
The legislation will have the biggest impact on
low-income working students, said Ruth Obel-Jor
gensen, organizing director of the UC Students As
sociation. These cuts may affect how many hours
students have to work each week, Obel-Jorgensen
said.
She said small amounts of money do not make
much of a difference to most lawmakers, but in the
life of a working student, the fees add up. To stu
dents, "$ 100 is a big deal," especially when one text
book can cost over $100, she said.

The cuts may affect students' decisions to pro
long their academic careers, said Student Regent
Adam Rosenthal. He said because of the increased
interest rates, it will take students longer to pay off
their debt, which may deter students from going to
graduate school or completing a double major.
The cuts may also affect the economic diversity
of the UCLA campus, Rosenthal said. He said the
growing price of a university education will deter
low-income and underprivileged students and par
ents from trying to finance an education.
For low-income families, the "sticker shock" of
the price of a university education may have an ef
fect on where students attend school, and even
how many children in the family can afford to go to
college. Rosenthal said.
"Working students who rely on loans to access
higher education will not feel comfortable taking
on that much debt," Biniek said.
Rosenthal said the regents are very concerned
about financial aid for students and the federal role
in offering loans for students.
"Decision-makers are not prioritizing higher
education and the affordability of a university ed
ucation" Biniek said.
