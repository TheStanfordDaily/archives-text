## Gov. proposes changes for California 
### MOLLY BECHTEL THE CALIFORNIA AGGIE 
(U-WIRE) â€” Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger
proposed an extensive game plan for the future of
California in his annual State of the State address
Thursday.
Schwarzenegger mentioned a "strategic
growth plan" that made for the heart of the
speech. The plan mapped out the state's next 10
years with hopes to achieve an investment of $2(X)
billion. He also addressed improvements that can
be made in the daily lives of citizens today.
Schwarzenegger also pointed to mistakes he
has made within the last year and noted the les
sons he has taken away.
"1 didn't hear the majority of Californians
when they were telling me they didn't like the spe
cial election," he said. "1 barreled ahead anyway
when I should have listened."
Schwarzenegger also noted what the state has
accomplished since he was elected governor in
October 2(X)3. He cited investments in education,
almost half a million new jobs and balancing the

budget as improvements within the state.
With "build it" as the governor's theme
throughout the speech, he noted that the state's
population is expected to rise by as much as 30
percent over the next 20 years.
"Our systems are at the breaking point now,"
Schwarzenegger said. "We need more roads, more
hospitals, more schools... more, more, more."
The governor's strategic growth plan included
investments in transportation,air quality,education,
water and flood control as well as public safety.
He proposed adding 1,200 miles of new high
way, while utilizing technology to clean the state's
air. Schwarzenegger also suggested the construc
tion of more than 2,000 schools, two new prisons
and 101 new courthouses.
Schwarzenegger pointed to the college and
university system in the state as an asset to fuel the
state's future and said higher education is in need
of new classrooms, libraries and science labs.
Schwarzenegger also said there is a need to fis
cally assist families who put their children through
state institutions.
"In higher education, we need to reduce the

burden on families who send children to our state
universities," Schwarzenegger said. "I propose we
should eliminate the increase in tuition scheduled
to take effect this fall."
The governor also proposed a $1 increase in
minimum wage and said he will propose a repay
ment of the $1.67 billion for 1998's Proposition 98,
an initiative that provides funding to K-12 schools
and community colleges.
Schwarzenegger proposed the importation of
prescription drugs as well as developments in pub
lic safety by passing Jessica's Law, which would en
able the state to track sex offenders with more
ease.
The governor concluded his speech with refer
ences to the "California dream" and said it was this
image of a better life that drew him to the state. He
ended with an emphasis on development as key to
the state's success in the future.
"The state of our state is sound because our
dream is sound," Schwarzenegger said. "Let us
commit to building California so that the dream
can remain alive for this generation, for the next
generation and for generations to come."
