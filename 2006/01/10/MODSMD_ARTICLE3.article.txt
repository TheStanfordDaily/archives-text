# Law School switch
## The
						Stanford Law School switches from semester to quarter system Law School calendar will resemble rest of the University 
### MIMA MOHAMMED STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Law School has officially
switched from the semester system to the
quarter system, in a move similar to that of the
University of Chicago Law School. The deci
sion closely follows Law School Dean Larry

Kramer's statement to students that "The Law
School faculty has, since last winter, been con
sidering modifying our academic calendar in
order to improve our ability to coordinate
classes and programs with the rest of the Uni
versity."
The "modified semester" approach in
cludes a variety of administrative adjust
ments, but primarily consists of altering the
fall semester for first-year students so they can
take exams before leaving for winter break. It
is intended to facilitate better coordination

with other parts of the University by having
the Law School's first semester and the Uni
versity's fall quarter end at the same time for
all students, and by placing the University's
winter quarter entirely within the Law
School's second semester.
"Integrating better with Stanford's other
schools and departments can produce sub
stantial benefits for law students and faculty,
as well as for the larger University," Kramer
said. "It will enable our students to obtain a
richer and more well-rounded legal educa
tion, one that prepares them better for their
future careers. It will facilitate joint degrees
and research, and it will enable a variety of
innovative courses and programs with stu
dents and faculty from other parts of campus.
If we are on quarters, our students will also
gain opportunities to study more subjects
and take classes from more of our faculty."
Reaching this decision took no small meas
ure of time. The Law School Faculty collected
data from Stanford and from other schools.
Students, alumni and administrators were also
consulted and interviewed about the pro
posed changes. Four faculty meetings were
designated to discuss the change. After ex
ploring a variety of options and proposals, the
decision finally came down to two choices,
switching to the same quarter system as the
University, or modifying the semester system
in a way that might capture many of the bene
fits of quarters without losing the benefits of
semesters.
At their final meeting, the faculty voted
overwhelmingly in favor of a two-step transi
tion to the quarter system, to take place over a
four-year period.The transition involves mov
ing to the modified semester system next year
(academic year 2006-2007) fora period of
three years. A final switch will then be made to
the quarter system in the academic year start
ing in 2009.
" litis permits us to fully work out logistical
and other issues so as to minimize confusion
and transition costs and ensure that the bene
fits of fuller academic integration are available
before we change to quarters," Kramer ex
plained. "An additional, important advantage
is that the three-year transition period will
allow us to see how far the modified semester
approach goes toward achieving our ends. If. at
the end of the transition period, it turns out
that modified semesters adequately achieve
the benefits sought by calendar reform, the
faculty can reevaluate the decision to move to
quarters."
Despite Kramer's optimism, many law stu
dents have reservations about the change to
the quarter system.
"I am very concerned that the calendar
changes will affect summer internships and
preparation for the Bar exam." said second-
