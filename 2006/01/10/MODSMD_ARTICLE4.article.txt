## DEBRA ZUMWALT, General Counsel Vandals still at large 
### ADAM WIDMAN STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford University Department
of Public Safety is investigating a series of
vandalisms that occurred on Monday,
Dec. 12, when University and Stanford
Hospital workers went on strike during
hospital contract negotiations.
"Overall, most people behaved re
sponsibly in connection with the strike, as
we would expect from our employees and
students, and we have no issue with the
peaceful demonstrations that took place,"
said Debra Zumwalt. Stanford's General
Counsel. "However, we were extremely
disappointed with the violent actions."
According to Zumwalt, a rock was
thrown through a window at the Hoover
House. University President John Hen
nessey's residence, at about 5:30 a.m. on
the day of the strike. One of Hennessey's
cars was also damaged, found with a bro
ken window and a damaged front grill.
In a second incident. Zumwalt said
three large windows in the entrance to
Building 10 were broken while a Univer

sity employee was inside the building.
Zumwalt described that the employee at
the time of the incident was "very fright
ened and upset."
Deputy Ken Bates from the Office of
Special Events for Stanford's Department
of Public Safety confirmed these reports
and added that on the day of the strike two
electric vehicles were overturned and sub
sequently leaked battery acid. Zumwalt
said the spilled battery acid "necessitated
a hazardous materials cleanup."
According to Zumwalt, there are no
reports of personal injury in any of these
incidents.
Ilie University has offered a $ 1 .(MX) re
ward for anyone who can provide infor
mation on the culprits of these crimes.
According to Bates, the three crimes
have been labeled as vandalisms and are
currently being investigated. The official
police reports for the crimes cannot be
made public until charges arc filed at the
district attorney's office.
Bates also said that the department
cannot comment on any leads it has
on the perpetrators of these crimes at
this time.
"The detective's bureau has an
open and active investigation and is
reluctant to release information that
could compromise the investiga
tion," Bates said.
"(The police] investigate to the
best of our ability," he added. "As we
build info or leads, we pursue the in
vestigation until we apprehend
somebody. If no immediate appre

hension is made, we keep the case
open, hoping to eventually catch the
perpetrators."
Zumwalt said that the University
was generally pleased with the stu
dent response to the strike but was
upset that members of the Stanford
community resorted to acts of vio
lence.
"Stanford has a long history of
peaceful protest on labor and other
matters, so it was particularly surpris
ing and disappointing to see the van
dalism and violence on Dec. 12,"
Zumwalt said. "As an educational in
stitution, Stanford embraces open
debate, expressions of disagreement
with University positions and peace
ful demonstrations.

"We do not tolerate criminal acts
and violence," she emphasized.
According to Zumwalt, if student
groups are found to be connected to
any of the crimes they will be held
"collectively responsible" for the
criminal actions.
Zev Kvitky, president of the strik
ing United Stanford Workers, said he
had no knowledge of the crimes until
days after the strikes. Neither the
United Stanford Workers nor the
SEIU Local 715, another union in
volved in the strike, has disputed any
of the criminal reports.
Some students expressed their
disappointment that vandalism ac
companied an otherwise peaceful
labor protest.

"The crimes that occurred during
the strike were not only disrespectful
to the Stanford community, but were
in direct contradiction with the val
ues of the peaceful, legal protest that
was taking place that day," said soph
omore Phil Narodick, a labor advo
cate. "It is a shame that the plight of
thousands of Stanford workers was
overshadowed by the unlawful acts
of a few."
Narodick added that he was not
surprised by the reports of unruly be
havior.
"Crimes during protests and
strikes are natural because those who
wish to cause destruction will take
advantage of a period of unrest," he
said.
