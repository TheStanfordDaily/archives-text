## Sullivan failed Calif. bar California bar exam criticized as too difficult

If you thought that your fall quarter fi
nals were about as unpleasant as having an
elephant stomp your head into a high
speed blender, take a moment to consider
the California bar exam.The results of the
July 2(K)5 test reveal that out of 8668 test
takers, over half failed. Even among al

preparing for the bar exam himself, said
that Sullivan's results provide "conclusive

than a process to certify competent
lawyers. She was reportedly on (presiden
tial candidate John] Kerry's short-list for
the Supreme Court and famed Harvard
Law professor Larry THbes called her the
most extraordinary student I had ever
had, so the problem is clearly with the
test."
Indeed, the California test is consid

the country, with no other state bearing a
lower overall pass rate. One reason the
California bar's pass rate is so low is that it
allows students from law schools unac
credited by the American Bar Association
to take the exam.
Another reason. Law School Prof.
Catherine Glaze explained, "is that it's
longer than any other state's. While most
