## Sullivan failed Calif. bar California bar exam criticized as too difficult 
### CHRISTOPHER LIN 
If you thought that your fall quarter fi
nals were about as unpleasant as having an
elephant stomp your head into a high
speed blender, take a moment to consider
the California bar exam.The results of the
July 2(K)5 test reveal that out of 8668 test
takers, over half failed. Even among al
ready practicing U.S. attorneys, per
cent passed the general bar examination,
and barely 28 percent passed the attor
neys' examination.
Among those who failed was Stanford
Law School Professor and former dean
Kathleen Sullivan. Having previously
passed the bar in New York and Massa
chusetts. Sullivan is a noted constitutional
scholar who has practiced law for 25 years,
making numerous appearances before the
U.S. Supreme Court. She decided to take
the California bar exam after joining a
legal firm as an appellate specialist, but
found that she was pressed for time to
study.

"Last July, the press of other commit
ments plus an unexpected medical emer
gency left me too little time to prep,ire,"
she said.
John Elias. a third-year law student
preparing for the bar exam himself, said
that Sullivan's results provide "conclusive
proof that the bar is primarily a guild sys
tem designed to limit competition rather
than a process to certify competent
lawyers. She was reportedly on (presiden
tial candidate John] Kerry's short-list for
the Supreme Court and famed Harvard
Law professor Larry THbes called her the
most extraordinary student I had ever
had, so the problem is clearly with the
test."
Indeed, the California test is consid
ered the most difficult bar examination in
the country, with no other state bearing a
lower overall pass rate. One reason the
California bar's pass rate is so low is that it
allows students from law schools unac
credited by the American Bar Association
to take the exam.
Another reason. Law School Prof.
Catherine Glaze explained, "is that it's
longer than any other state's. While most
other states' bar exams last two to
two-and-a-half days, the California
bar exam takes three days," covering
subjects from constitutional and tort
law to real property and wills and
trusts. The first and third days of
the exam consist of three one-hour
essays in the morning and a three
hour performance test in the after
noon, during which test takers are
asked to draft a legal document that
analyzes a given file and library of
documents. The second day consists
of the Multistate Bar Examination, a

six-hour multiple-choice test with
200 questions developed by the Na
tional Conference of Bar Examiners.
Some law professors criticize the
test's format for focusing too much
on archaic laws not used in everyday
legal practice and for forcing law stu
dents to commit these laws to rote
memorization when most practicing
lawyers are required to verify that
laws are current anyway
Daniel Solove, an associate pro
fessor of law at the George Washing
ton University Law School, com
mented on Sullivan's failure in his
blog, 'Concurring Opinions,' arguing
that "the longer one practices and the
better one knows the law, the worse
one will do on the bar exam. Sulli
van's problem was that she didn't

waste enough hours memorizing the
often obsolete and reductive rules
for the Bar Exam. Indeed, any prac
ticing lawyer or law professor who
doesn't have a lot of time on her
hands to waste would encounter a
similar problem."
Glaze also pointed out that "the
examination graders spend five min
utes reading what it took an hour to
write. To people who go through the
bar exam, it seems more like a hazing
ritual."
Most students ready themselves
for the bar by taking a preparation
course called Bar/Bri, which pro
vides six weeks of preparation, fea
turing lectures by law professors on
major areas tested by the bar exam
and provides students with outline

worksheets and sample examination
questions. The preparation course
can cost upwards of $2,(MX). and get
ting ready for the exam can require a
solid two months of studying.
Patricia Stringel, a third-year law
student, said that "the vast majority
of SLS students pass, even though the
overall passage rate for the state is
low. Most of us are planning on tak
ing bar prep courses, and I honestly
don't know anyone who is too wor
ried about it. We are all planning on
studying hard."
Sullivan too remains confident
that more preparation will help her
pass the California bar next time.
"Taking the California bar in mid
dle age requires preparation," she
said."l'll prepare more next time!"
