## Univ. declared human cloning research faked 
### BO-MI LIM ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) â€” The now-dis
graced South Korean researcher who stunned
the scientific community with his claim to have
cloned human embryonic stem cells faked his
results, relying on "fabricated data," his univer
sity said Tuesday.
The latest revelation doomed Hwang Woo
suk's reputation as a cloning pioneer, already
tainted by the finding that the veterinarians
claim in 2005 to have developed 11 patient-spe
cific stem cell lines was false.
Hwang "did not have any proof to show that
cloned embryonic stem cells were ever created,"
an investigating panel at Seoul National Uni
versity said in a report Tuesday, disputing claims
in Hwang's 2004 paper in the journal Science
purporting that he cloned a human embryo and
extracted stem cells from it.
The panel found that Hwang's claims last
year to have created the world's first cloned dog,
however, were genuine.
Scientists hope to someday use human stem
cells _ master cells that can grow into any body
tissue _ to cure diseases such as Alzheimer's and
diabetes.
Creating stem cells genetically matched to a
specific patient would be a breakthrough be
cause they would not be rejected by the pa
tient's immune systems. But despite years of re
search, Hwang was the only person to claim suc
cess in extracting the cells from an embryo.
"The 2004 paper was written on fabricated
data to show that the stem cells match the DNA
of the provider although they didn't," the report
said.
The reputation of Hwang _ once dubbed
"The Pride of Korea" _ has eroded steadily in
recent months with increasing questions about
his work.

Last month, a devastating report by the uni
versity concluded that Hwang fabricated anoth
er article published in Science last year.The uni
versity's nine-member investigative panel said it
could not find any of the 11 stem cell lines
matched to patients, as Hwang had reported in
that research.
Hwang conceded in November that two sub
ordinate scientists had donated eggs and other
women were paid to take fertility drugs to pro
duce eggs for research. Both practices are
viewed as coercive and unethical in the West.
Hwang, who said he would resign from the
university after last month's report.has yet to do
so. The university condemned the fabrications
and suggested it would issue a punishment.
"This conduct cannot but be seen as an act that
fools the whole scientific community and the
public "Tuesday's report said. "Just based on the
facts of the fabrications that have been dis
closed, the penalty has to be severe."
Research such as Hwang's is off-limits in

many U.S. labs because the government restricts
federal money for human embryonic stem cell
experiments. Labs that depend on federal
money cannot use it to create new embryonic
cell lines as Hwang has claimed he did.
As he rose to international fame amid his
now-discredited scientific advances, Hwang be
came a national hero in South Korea.
He was designated the country's first-ever
"top scientist" in June by the government, win
ning special funding. The Foreign Ministry as
signed a diplomat to assist him with internation
al contacts. Korean Air even gave I Iwang and
his wife free first-class flights fora decade, call
ing the scientist a "national treasure."
South Korean prosecutors are preparing their
own investigation, which would include I Iwang's
allegation that other researchers in his lab mali
ciously switched some of his stem cells. The uni
versity did not address Hwang's claim about the
alleged switch and it was not immediately clear
what action, if any. prosecutors planned.
