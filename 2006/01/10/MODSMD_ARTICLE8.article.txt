# Army begins to expel disobedient reservists
## Reservists who failed to report for active duty will not face criminal charges. 
### ROBERT BURNS ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The
Army took initial steps Monday to
expel dozens of reservists who failed
to report for active duty, in effect
warning hundreds of others that they
too could be penalized if they don't
heed orders to return to active service.
The proceedings mark a turning point
in the Army's struggle to deploy thou
sands of soldiers from the Individual
Ready Reserve, a rarely mobilized
group of reservists, to war zones in
which some have resisted serving.
These are soldiers who had previ
ously served on active duty but not
completed their eight-year service ob
ligation. Unlike those in the National
Guard or Army Reserve, they are not
required to stay in training. Many have
requested a delay in returning to serv
ice, have asked to be exempted or
have ignored their orders.
The Army began mobilizing them in
the summer of 2(K)4, reflecting the
enormous strain it felt in providing
enough soldiers for Iraq at a time
when it was becoming apparent that
no early withdrawal was likely.
Since mid-2004, more than 5,7(X)
IRR soldiers have been issued mobi
lization orders, while another 1,600
were excused from duty. Of those sol
diers who were sent orders, 3,954 re
ported for duty as of Dec. 11, while at
least 1,283 others have asked fora
delay or are in some stage of negotia
tions as to their callup, the Army said.
There are 463 IRR soldiers, who had
been sent orders but have not reported,

including 80 that now face discharge
and 383 who have yet to be located.
The Army announced that the 80 sol
diers will face review panels, known as
separation boards, although the num
ber may grow if more are located. If
the panels conclude they intentionally
did not obey a mobilization order,
they would face one of three levels of
discharge from the service: honorable,
general or other-than-honorable.
They do not face criminal charges.
When the Army initially found that
it was facing resistance from some
IRR soldiers who did not want to get
back in uniform, there was talk of de
claring them AWOL and pursuing
criminal charges against them. But
that was deemed too harsh and the
Army spent many months trying to
contact those who were ignoring their
orders.
In its announcement Monday, the
Army said that in addition to those
who have openly refused to report for
duty, those who do not respond to re
peated communications from the
Army may face discharge proceedings.
All of the 80 who now face dis
charge proceedings are enlisted sol
diers, according to Lt. Col. Bryan Hil
ferty, an Army spokesman. It was not
immediately clear, he said, how long it
had been since the Army took dis
charge action against IRR soldiers
who refused to be mobilized, but it
probably has been more than 15 years.
Of the three possible types of dis
charge that an IRR soldier may face in
these proceedings, the most severe is
"other than honorable." While a sol
dier given an honorable or general dis
charge would continue to be eligible
for payment for accrued leave, and for
health benefits and burial in an Army
national cemetery, those given an
"other than honorable" discharge
would not be.
