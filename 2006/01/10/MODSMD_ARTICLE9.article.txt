## SPECIAL REPORT Too cute for words New studies outline endearing animal characteristics, find that almost anything pint-sized and wide-eyed fits the bill

Who could forget the Antarctic
starts of last summer's silver screen,
when moviegoers went wild for the
adorable, waddling, tuxedo-clad crea
tures in March of the Penguins?
The year before that, another cinematic hit. Anchor
man, garnered laughs through its parody of media's and
everyday peoples' obsession with panda cubs.
Now scientists are saying that there's an explanation un
derlying this movie madness for all things fuzzy and cute. In
a New York Times article published Jan. 3. Natalie Angier
noted the burgeoning study of visual signaling.
"[Scientists] have identified a wide and still expanding
assortment of features and behaviors that make something
look cute," Angier wrote. They include "bright, forward
facing eyes set low on a big round face, a pair of big round
face, a pair of big round ears, floppy limbs and a side-to
side, teeter totter gait."
Add up these traits and you've got something that ex
udes youth and vulnerability, fitting perfectly with Dar
win's predominant theories. Anything that appears as
though it can't help itself will rouse the attention and nur
turing of its bigger, more capable caregivers.
"The greater the number of cute cues that an animal or
object happens to possessor the more exaggerated the sig
nals may be, the louder and more italicized are the squeals
provoked," Angier added.
This would explain why infatuated onlookers shelled
out the big buck last month — up to $100 — and scoured
the popular Internet auction site eßay in hopes of catch
ing a glimpse of the latest panda miracle at the Smithson
ian zoo. A total of 13,000 people were lucky enough to lay
eyes upon the arrival of Tai Shan, a 6-month-old, 25-
pound panda cub.
It might also explain why one Stanford student, senior

Da Pan, bears a name with some cute-minded roots.
"Rumor has it that I was named in honor of the interna
tional year of wildlife conservation. l l )84. the year I was
born," Pan said.
Researchers in Angier's article noted that the human
cuteness radar is set at a very low threshold, distinguishing
it from rare and difficult-to-obtain marks of beauty. Unlike
its elusive counterpart, beauty, cuteness is deemed "com
monplace and generous, content on occasion to co-segre
gate with homeliness."
And here's a helpful editorial hint: don't mention this
supposition to your female significant other, whom you
have deemed "cute" instead of "hot."
Meanwhile, debate is surfacing over whether cuteness is
completely wholesome and harmless.
Denis Dutton, a philosopher of art at the University of
Canterbury in New Zealand, said that our eagerness to in
discriminately praise things as "cute" can lead to frustra
tion and disappointment.
"Cute cuts through all layers of meaning and says.

Let's not worry about complexities, just love me," Dut
ton said. "That's where the sense of cheapness can
come from, and the feeling of being manipulated or

taken fora sucker that leads many to reject fine
ness as low or shallow."

Lest this opinion should dismantle the

image of cuteness,bear in mind that
new research seems to show that

cute images activate
dopamine-based pleasure
pathways in the brain the

same way sex. good food or
psychoactive drugs can.
And long before science
could call upon biological
bases to substantiate theorv.

savvy advertisers have been
capitalizing on the human im-

pulse to squeal over cute items.
Do Beanie babies or the Taco

Bell chihuahua ring a bell?
Close to home at the Stanford Bookstore, this market
ing ploy surfaces in the annual stuffed cow giveaway —
each is plump, bedecked with jingle bells and free with
every $100 textbook purchase.
So when it comes to making a verdict to what's cute and
what's not, signs point to the possibility that anything goes.
