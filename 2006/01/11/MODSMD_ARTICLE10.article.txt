## Middle East lies in limbo as Sharon shows improvement 
### KARIN LAUB ASSOCIATED PRESS 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Ariel
Sharon started breathing on his own
Monday and moved his right arm
and leg in response to pain stimula
tion in what his surgeon called an im
portant development. But it will be
days before doctors can determine
whether he is lucid or will be able to
return to the job.
"The prime minister is breathing
spontaneously," said Dr. Shlomo
Mor-Yosef, the director of Hadassah
Hospital, adding that the movements
of Sharon's arm and leg marked "a
slight but significant improvement."
Sharon's response is a "very im
portant" sign and indicated his brain
stem is working, said his chief sur
geon, Dr. Felix Umansky, briefing re
porters for the first time. In a hospital
statement early TUesday,doctors said
Sharon's condition, unchanged
overnight, was critical but stable. He
was still unconscious.
It is still too early, however, to as
sess what impact the massive bleed
ing he suffered in his right brain
would have on his abilities to think
and reason or on the left side of his
body, Umansky said.
"We are just at the beginning of a
very long way," the surgeon said. "It's
too early to talk about the cognitive
issue."
A final medical analysis on
Sharon's long-term prognosis would
end days of uncertainty over the fate
of the 77-year-old prime minister,
heralded by many as the best hope
for Mideast peace. Doctors said his
chances of survival are better, but he
is far from out of danger.
He remains hooked up to a respi
rator and unconscious in a guarded
room where classical music is being
played.

More clarity as to Sharon's condi
tion might enable his new, centrist
Kadima Party to select a successor
and start campaigning for March 28
elections. Acting Prime Minister
Ehud Olmert — Sharon's ally and a
proponent of unilateral withdrawals
from more Palestinian-claimed lands
— is seen as the most likely heir.
The Palestinians' political future,
which was to be decided in Jan. 25
parliament elections, also appeared
in limbo.
Palestinian leader Mahmoud
Abbas reiterated Monday that the
vote would take place on time, but
Palestinian Interior Minister Nasser
Yousef that warned his security forces
would not be able to protect polling
stations against gunmen. Some have
worried that gangs from Abbas' Fatah
Party may attack polling stations if
Fatah appears to be losing to the Is
lamic militant Hamas party.
Sharon has been in a medically in
duced coma since his massive stroke
Jan. 4. Doctors plan to continue low
ering the level of sedatives in his
body over the next several days, Mor-
Yosef said.
Sharon has not yet opened his
eyes. His doctors hope he will when
the sedative levels are lowered fur
ther, though outside experts cau
tioned there was no assurance he
would wake up at all.
"His chances of survival are bet
ter than if the respiratory center had
been damaged, but that still doesn't
mean he's going to survive," said Dr.
John Martin, a professor of cardio
vascular medicine at University Col
lege in London. He said Sharon's
weight and age worked against him.
Israel TV's Channel 2 quoted
Sharon's advisers, who are keeping
watch by his side, as saying he also re
sponded to words in some fashion,
though they weren't specific.
