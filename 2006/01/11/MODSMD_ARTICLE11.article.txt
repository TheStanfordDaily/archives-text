# Graduate Life
## Brand Me, Baby 
### 
When aliens land on campus,
they're going to be a little con
fused. Not only because they'll
be wondering why they chose Stanford
as the place to make first contact, but
also because they'll be a little surprised
at the school's resemblance to an inter
stellar penal colony.
"Penal colony?" 1 hear you ask. Well,
it's not just because the quality of life
here is somewhat reminiscent of the gu
lags. Nor is it because dubious regimes
ship their undesirables over here for the
extended torture that is grad school. No,
it's all about the uniform.
As evidenced by the preponderance
of Guantanamo orange in the media, de
humanizing prisoners with absurd cos
tumes is as in vogue today as it has been
throughout the ages.
Of course, uniforms are generally
forced upon convicts; for the inmates to
voluntarily select brightly-colored cloth
ing, slathered with the name and symbol
of the jailer — now that's something else.
It may be that the need to declare
your affiliation is a particularly Ameri
can phenomenon that my tiny (and sub
tle) European mind just can't grasp.
Maybe it's a rite of passage for college
students. A chance for you to break away
from the conventions and strictures of
your youth. After all, nothing says "free
thinker" quite like the regulation Stan
ford hoodie.
On the other hand, uniformity could be
a desperate reflection of an adolescent
need to belong. It's easy to feel a little con
fused by the overwhelming pressures of
college life. Sometimes, the only way to
deal involves a pair of corporate hot pants.
Then again, maybe it's pride. Perhaps
you guys are so filled with satisfaction at
being here that you just can't help saying,
"Look at me, I'm at Stanford" with a
poly-cotton blend.
ITie pride thing would also explain
the equally disturbing tendency for peo
ple to "go there, do that and get the T
shirt." Even when the "there" is Moun
tain View, the "that" is a leisurely stroll
up a gentle hill and the T-shirt is in a par
ticularly repellent shade of lime green.
I suppose in a world where cultural,
religious, social and gender barriers are
being blurred, identifying yourself as
one who has done something (you can
insert your own choice of meaningless
activity here) is as good a way as any to
be defined.
The danger of definitions, though, is
they often stick — even when you decide
that you should be jamming yourself into
another pigeonhole. I bet there is literal
ly one or two of you who — now that
you've stepped up the social ladder to
declare EE — regret wearing those
dorky CST-shirts you had as a freshman.
This whole phenomenon is even
worse for grad students. For most of the
folk I know, "new clothing" is a mythical
concept about which one whispers in
hushed tones. Accordingly, the frequency
of sweatshirts declaring one's undying al
legiance to the University of lowa Quiz
Bowl team is, well, frequent.
What's more, it's not just the fact it's
utterly pathetic, there's also another
downside to the insistence on branding
yourself with corporate clothing. It's re
ally quite ugly.
While 1 don't necessarily expect you
to dress well (you are,after all. the youth
of America), I can't help but feel that de
liberately throwing on hideous clothing
each morning is somewhat unfair to the
rest of the community. Some of us are
quite sensitive, you know.
Furthermore, the lack of effort is trou
bling in itself. Choosing between wearing
the Stanford T-shirt in white or red is not
a fashion choice. Actually, it barely even
qualifies as a decision. And that's awfully
disappointing given your status as the
bright young minds of a new generation.
Despite said disappointment, the lack
of taste and the utter soullessness reflect
ed in your choice of apparel, there is a
small part of me that can forgive your
transgressions against style. After all,
while it is in some ways wretched, the sight
of all you children scurrying around in
uniform is also, occasionally, rather cute.

Wearing a branded T-shirt? Take it off.
Hum it. Send me the ashes. Alternatively, e
mail your fashion questions to
navins@stanford.edu and he'll tell you
what not to wear.
