While Stanford doctoral students
enjoy priceless academic resources, their
small salaries have them clipping
coupons, learning to use a stove and pri
oritizing simple pleasures.
"I feel like I live a comfortable life,
but my standard of living is below what it
was when I was working in industry."
says Kat Murray, a second- year doctoral
student in communication. "1 don't go
out to eat very often...and 1 buy the
cheapest stuff possible for groceries.
Going to Whole Foods is a big splurge."
Stanford covers Murray's tuition and
benefits each quarter, and she makes an
additional $6,600 per quarter as a teach
ing assistant. But when asked whether
graduate student incomes are as sparse
as they're rumored to be, Murray says
she "thinks the short answer is 'yes.'"
Physics doctoral student Matt Pyle
confirms this claim — his yearly salary of
$25,000 forces him to waste time out
smarting the baristas at upscale coffee
shops.
"If you're dying fora cappuccino,order
a macchiato," Pyle advises."Real macchi
atos have only a dollop of froth, but in
America they butcher them by adding in
way too much milk as well. Effectively,
you end up with a cappuccino but about
$1.50 cheaper."
Graduate students can get by on their
salaries, but because Bay Area living is
expensive and on-campus housing costs
between $650 and $900 per month.

there's not much room for extravagance.
For example, many graduate students
lack the disposable income to pay for sat
isfying vacations.
"It is a bit ironic. I think, that while in
school we do have the breaks between
quarters,but we don't tend to have the fi
nancial resources to take advantage of
this time," Murray says.
Pyle. however, has adopted a scheme
to dodge this problem.
"Take vacations on your adviser," he
says."I feel that this is the most impor
tant way I squeeze every last bit of enjoy
ment out of my meager monetary means.
I figure that a two-week trip to Europe
or Asia usually costs about $2,000 to
$3,ooo...however, when your adviser
picks up the tab. it's almost free."
Besides bleeding their advisers dry.
graduate students have devised other
tactics to keep themselves happy and
sane on a tight budget.
Fourth-year computer science doctor
al student Rachel Weinstein hosts jewel
ry-makingevents through Luxe Jewels, an
organization that helps women build
"profitable, flexible and fun businesses,"
according to its Web site, http://www.luxe
jewels.com. Weinstein purchases supplies
from Luxe at wholesale prices, and event
attendees then pay for the materials at re
tail prices. She keeps the difference as a
profit, brings all the tools to the event and
provides any necessary instruction.
"That means [they get] as much in
struction as they need to make sure they
walk away with something they're proud
to show off to their friends." Weinstein

says. "There's many different kinds of
events from ones where you can design
your own piece to simply working from a
kit. The events make great girls' nights
and unique fundraisers. Because I hold
parties when I can and want to, every
thing revolves around how much time I
have. This flexibility combined with a
low start up cost and, of course, fun was
what attracted me to it."
Murray says that besides trying to
make extra money, hanging out with
other graduate students can also help
keep her wallet padded.
"[Graduate students] all have the
same budget issues," she explains. "Thus
there tends to be less conflict over what
restaurant to choose or whether to go to
a concert because none of us can afford
these luxuries. I do run into these con
flicts when 1 want to spend time with
friends who are not graduate students
because they are living in a different in
come bracket."
So what do these throngs of graduate
students do for low-cost kicks?
Murray and her friends like to hike
and spend time in Northern California's
great outdoors. They also gather at peo
ple's homes and party.
"We do a lot of happy hours — this is
a way people can spend or not spend
what they want to," she says.
And Pyle chooses his drinking binges
carefully
"Only get hammered at bars on spe
cial occasions," Pyle says. "Hey, 1

Notably, second-year physics doctor

manages to "lead a fairly yuppie-ish
lifestyle" on a budget quite similar to
that of Pyle.
"[I spend] cash on the theater, sym
phony. films, fine dining and money on
foreign travel, while managing to save a
non-negligible amount each month," he
says.
Indeed, Rajendran has a fairly posi
tive outlook on graduate student
salaries.
"Even though graduate student
stipends are not high enough to allow
one's grandmother to brag about the
stipend to her mates, we make enough to
lead a good lifestyle," he says."Stanford's
stipends are very competitive. For in

vides good health benefits.
"I was pleased that I was able to see
a travel nurse before I left on [a trip to
Laos] and that Cardinal Care provides
travel insurance," she says.

be making the same kind of money as cor

"Take vacations on your adviser," he
says."I feel that this is the most impor
tant way I squeeze every last bit of enjoy
ment out of my meager monetary means.
I figure that a two-week trip to Europe
or Asia usually costs about $2,000 to
$3,ooo...however, when your adviser
picks up the tab. it's almost free."
Besides bleeding their advisers dry.
graduate students have devised other
tactics to keep themselves happy and
sane on a tight budget.
Fourth-year computer science doctor
al student Rachel Weinstein hosts jewel
ry-makingevents through Luxe Jewels, an
organization that helps women build
"profitable, flexible and fun businesses,"
according to its Web site, http://www.luxe
jewels.com. Weinstein purchases supplies
from Luxe at wholesale prices, and event
attendees then pay for the materials at re
tail prices. She keeps the difference as a
profit, brings all the tools to the event and
provides any necessary instruction.
"That means [they get] as much in
struction as they need to make sure they
walk away with something they're proud
to show off to their friends." Weinstein

says. "There's many different kinds of
events from ones where you can design
your own piece to simply working from a
kit. The events make great girls' nights
and unique fundraisers. Because I hold
parties when I can and want to, every
thing revolves around how much time I
have. This flexibility combined with a
low start up cost and, of course, fun was
what attracted me to it."
Murray says that besides trying to
make extra money, hanging out with
other graduate students can also help
keep her wallet padded.
"[Graduate students] all have the
same budget issues," she explains. "Thus
there tends to be less conflict over what
restaurant to choose or whether to go to
a concert because none of us can afford
these luxuries. I do run into these con
flicts when 1 want to spend time with
friends who are not graduate students
because they are living in a different in
come bracket."
So what do these throngs of graduate
students do for low-cost kicks?
Murray and her friends like to hike
and spend time in Northern California's
great outdoors. They also gather at peo
ple's homes and party.
"We do a lot of happy hours — this is
a way people can spend or not spend
what they want to," she says.

nothing will probably happen is absurd.
On the other hand, if the girls at the table
next to you are dying for body shots or
it's the first time one of your friends has
ever been drunk, bring out the tequila."
Notably, second-year physics doctor
al student Surjeet Rajendran says he
manages to "lead a fairly yuppie-ish
lifestyle" on a budget quite similar to
that of Pyle.
"[I spend] cash on the theater, sym
phony. films, fine dining and money on
foreign travel, while managing to save a
non-negligible amount each month," he
says.
Indeed, Rajendran has a fairly posi
tive outlook on graduate student
salaries.
"Even though graduate student
stipends are not high enough to allow
one's grandmother to brag about the
stipend to her mates, we make enough to
lead a good lifestyle," he says."Stanford's
stipends are very competitive. For in
stance, we make significantly more
money than graduate students in Berke
ley."
. And Murray adds that Stanford pro
vides good health benefits.
"I was pleased that I was able to see
a travel nurse before I left on [a trip to
Laos] and that Cardinal Care provides
travel insurance," she says.
So although doctoral students may not
be making the same kind of money as cor
porate execs, they don't have it half bad,
either.

While Stanford doctoral students
enjoy priceless academic resources, their
small salaries have them clipping
coupons, learning to use a stove and pri
oritizing simple pleasures.
"I feel like I live a comfortable life,
but my standard of living is below what it
was when I was working in industry."
says Kat Murray, a second- year doctoral
student in communication. "1 don't go
out to eat very often...and 1 buy the
cheapest stuff possible for groceries.
Going to Whole Foods is a big splurge."
Stanford covers Murray's tuition and
benefits each quarter, and she makes an
additional $6,600 per quarter as a teach
ing assistant. But when asked whether
graduate student incomes are as sparse
as they're rumored to be, Murray says
she "thinks the short answer is 'yes.'"
Physics doctoral student Matt Pyle
confirms this claim — his yearly salary of
$25,000 forces him to waste time out
smarting the baristas at upscale coffee
shops.
"If you're dying fora cappuccino,order
a macchiato," Pyle advises."Real macchi
atos have only a dollop of froth, but in
America they butcher them by adding in
way too much milk as well. Effectively,
you end up with a cappuccino but about
$1.50 cheaper."
Graduate students can get by on their
salaries, but because Bay Area living is
expensive and on-campus housing costs
between $650 and $900 per month.

there's not much room for extravagance.
For example, many graduate students
lack the disposable income to pay for sat
isfying vacations.
"It is a bit ironic. I think, that while in
school we do have the breaks between
quarters,but we don't tend to have the fi
nancial resources to take advantage of
this time," Murray says.
Pyle. however, has adopted a scheme
to dodge this problem.

says."I feel that this is the most impor
tant way I squeeze every last bit of enjoy
ment out of my meager monetary means.
