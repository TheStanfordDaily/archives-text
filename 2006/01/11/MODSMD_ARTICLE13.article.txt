### ILENA GEORGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Residence deans, the Undergraduate Ad
vising Program, resident assistants, resident
fellows and a plethora of other resources
exist to assist undergraduates with the issues
that crop up as they navigate their scholastic
and social lives at Stanford.
But what about those who are past their
undergraduate years?
One important resource for graduate stu
dents is the Graduate Life Office (GLO), a
division of the Dean of Student Affairs Of
fice that is comprised mainly of three gradu
ate deans. Available at all hours of the day
and night through a pager system, the deans
provide graduate students with advice and
support on residential, personal and aca
demic matters.
Chris Griffith, associate dean of student
affairs and director of the GLO, has been at
Stanford since 1980.
"Overall, my job is to do my part to create
an environment that supports graduate stu
dents and student families in the pursuit of
their academic goals," Griffith says."It re
quires getting to know students, being con
sistently informed about and responsive to
their needs and concerns and being a helpful
and knowledgeable resource. It also requires
close collaboration with faculty and staff to
collectively address student issues."
Assistant Dean Ken Hsu. who has

worked in the GLO fora year and a half, says
that community building through programs
and events also constitutes an essential part
of his job. He recounts a successful holiday
party thrown by the head community associ
ates in Escondido Village.
"There were great conversations and
much laughter among a group of very busy
people in a very busy time," he says. "Seeing
the students from different disciplines and
backgrounds connecting, talking, having fun
and laughing together is a reminder of one
important purpose of what we do."
Assistant Dean Andy Hernandez, who's
been on staff at the GLO since 2000. ex
plains, "We administer the residential pro
gram, help students manage personal diffi
culties, work closely with graduate student
organizations, participate in campus-wide
initiatives that address graduate student
needs and concerns and sponsor University
wide welcomes. 1 also have particular re
sponsibility for working with graduate stu
dent families and with undergraduates who
live in graduate housing."
In accomplishing these goals, the GLO
faces certain challenges. Griffith. Hsu and
Hernandez all say they find that graduate
students are extremely busy and identify
more closely with their respective schools,
labs or departments rather than the graduate
community at large. In addition, the needs
and concerns of graduate students vary
widely, as 30 percent of the graduate student

population is international students and
many graduate students are married with
children.
To address the varying needs of the grad
uate student community the GLO collabo
rates with other campus offices and academ
ic departments. Hsu explains that the office
provides "outreach and consultation" to aca
demic departments and faculty concerning
graduate student issues.
However, Griffith describes "the heart" of the
GLO as the student leadership — "the folks who
do the day-to-day community work."
This includes the 105 community associ
ates who are graduate students and their
spouses or partners. They plan activities for
the graduate community and can be go-to
people for information or advice about Stan
ford s services.
Communication and the provision of easy
access to important information also rank
highly on the GLO's list of priorities.
"At the beginning of Fall quarter, we pro
vide and coordinate orientation and informa
tional services and programs," Hsu says. These
include the Graduate Student Information*
Center and the Graduate Orientation Activity
Lunch and Information Event."
To apprise students of events and to help
bring together the graduate student commu
nity throughout the year, the GLO — in col
laboration with the Graduate Student Pro
gramming Board and the Graduate Student
Council — recentlv introduced the monthly

"Grad Announce" newsletter, a monthly e
newsletter that highlights campus-wide
events organized by the GLO, the GSC and
the GSPB. Beyond "Grad Announce," the
GLO works closely with the GSPB and GSC
to create new programs and address the con
cerns of the graduate community.
"(My job] requires getting to know stu
dents, being consistently informed about and
responsive to their needs and concerns and
being a helpful and knowledgeable re
source," Griffith says. "Our collective wis
dom is that if you want to get to know the
community and what's on their mind, you
need to go where they are."
In addition, the deans reach out to the
graduate community by attending and sup
porting many graduate student events and
by interacting with students who approach
them in search of advice or assistance.
"I enjoy the daily contact with students and
their families," Hernandez says, "especially
when we can help solve a problem or connect
them with a resource that will help them."
Ultimately, all three deans agree that the
best part of their jobs is working with the di
verse and creative graduate student body.
"I love the rich diversity of our communi
ty," Griffith says."I love working alongside
students to implement new programs, dis
cuss community issues and solve problems. 1
like the fact that they believe that anything is
possible given a good idea and the persist
ence to implement it."

and laughing together is a reminder of one
important purpose of what we do."
Assistant Dean Andy Hernandez, who's
been on staff at the GLO since 2000. ex
plains, "We administer the residential pro
gram, help students manage personal diffi
culties, work closely with graduate student
organizations, participate in campus-wide
initiatives that address graduate student
needs and concerns and sponsor University
wide welcomes. 1 also have particular re
sponsibility for working with graduate stu
dent families and with undergraduates who
live in graduate housing."
In accomplishing these goals, the GLO
faces certain challenges. Griffith. Hsu and
Hernandez all say they find that graduate
students are extremely busy and identify
more closely with their respective schools,
labs or departments rather than the graduate
community at large. In addition, the needs
and concerns of graduate students vary
widely, as 30 percent of the graduate student

population is international students and
many graduate students are married with
children.
To address the varying needs of the grad
uate student community the GLO collabo
rates with other campus offices and academ
ic departments. Hsu explains that the office
provides "outreach and consultation" to aca
demic departments and faculty concerning
graduate student issues.
However, Griffith describes "the heart" of the
GLO as the student leadership — "the folks who
do the day-to-day community work."
This includes the 105 community associ
ates who are graduate students and their
spouses or partners. They plan activities for
the graduate community and can be go-to
people for information or advice about Stan
ford s services.
Communication and the provision of easy
access to important information also rank
highly on the GLO's list of priorities.
"At the beginning of Fall quarter, we pro
vide and coordinate orientation and informa
tional services and programs," Hsu says. These
include the Graduate Student Information*
Center and the Graduate Orientation Activity
Lunch and Information Event."
To apprise students of events and to help
bring together the graduate student commu
nity throughout the year, the GLO — in col
laboration with the Graduate Student Pro
gramming Board and the Graduate Student
Council — recentlv introduced the monthly

"Grad Announce" newsletter, a monthly e
newsletter that highlights campus-wide
events organized by the GLO, the GSC and
the GSPB. Beyond "Grad Announce," the
GLO works closely with the GSPB and GSC
to create new programs and address the con
cerns of the graduate community.
"(My job] requires getting to know stu
dents, being consistently informed about and
responsive to their needs and concerns and
being a helpful and knowledgeable re
source," Griffith says. "Our collective wis
dom is that if you want to get to know the
community and what's on their mind, you
need to go where they are."
In addition, the deans reach out to the
graduate community by attending and sup
porting many graduate student events and
by interacting with students who approach
them in search of advice or assistance.
"I enjoy the daily contact with students and
their families," Hernandez says, "especially
when we can help solve a problem or connect
them with a resource that will help them."
Ultimately, all three deans agree that the
best part of their jobs is working with the di
verse and creative graduate student body.
"I love the rich diversity of our communi
ty," Griffith says."I love working alongside
students to implement new programs, dis
cuss community issues and solve problems. 1
like the fact that they believe that anything is
possible given a good idea and the persist
ence to implement it."
