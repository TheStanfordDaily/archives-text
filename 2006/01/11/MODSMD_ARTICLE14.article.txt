## Editorial Misguided tactics damage strike's image 
### 
Any strike on a university campus is a
big deal. This reality is understood
by SEIU Local 715 and Stanford ad
ministrators, and most students at least
somewhat understood this by the end of the
day on Monday, Dec. 12. Last month's strike,
however, was not as major as its supporters
perhaps hoped it would be. It was hindered
by poor timing that lent itself to student ap
athy and by negative tactics that irritated
many students.
A strike at a major university merits na
tional news because students are likely to
support workers and question administra
tors. and the university has a carefully re
fined image to uphold. The university wants
to keep costs down without alienating the
public, and the union tries to use the precar
ious university position to extract more con
cessions than would be available from al
most any other employer.
We fully support the right of the Hospital
and University workers to go on strike. For
them, the sacrifice of a day's pay was more
inconvenience than any student experienced
that Monday. However, we question the tac
tics on all sides of the stoppage, especially
with regards to the timing.
Let's begin with the obvious. Striking on
the first day of finals is stupid.The leadership
of SEIU Local 715 should have read the ac
ademic calendar a little more closely and re
alized that some of its strongest supporters
would be unlikely to turn out before their
Monday morning exams.
Making early-morning noise outside of
student residences (which are next to dining
halls) was unlikely to attract sympathy, and
threatening to cut services before three
hour tests created antipathy toward the
union, not toward the administration of the
University. The result: only moderate stu
dent support at the rallies throughout the
day.
The Stanford Labor Action Coalition
also deserves some blame. This group of stu
dents should have worked harder to connect
the strike to students, instead of merely
pushing students to boycott dining halls — a
meaningless gesture since the University
had already received payment for the meals.
As another strike might be necessary in the

near future, campaigns should continue to
inform students and begin more of a dia
logue. Instead of portraying the situation as
an "us or them" issue. SLAC and the Coali
tion for Labor Justice should try to educate
students on these issues of retirement, health
benefits and outsourcing — issues that are
more obscure, but just as important, as a liv
ing wage.
Finally, the University should shoulder
some blame, though most of its decisions —
such as keeping the dining halls open at such
an important time of year — were perfectly
reasonable.
Dean of Students Greg Boardman has
come under fire for representing the Univer
sity's views in an e-mail to the whole student
body. While Boardman and the administra
tion do have privileged access to all e-mail
addresses, students have access to each other
and to numerous mailing lists. Boardman
could hardly hope that the University line
would be forwarded around as widely as that
of SLAC. Where Boardman did deserve crit
icism was in quoting CLJ out of context. But
the dean quickly learned that e-mails can be
turned right around, as SLAC and CLJ had a
response to his message within hours. All
those looking for both sides of the issue un
doubtedly heard the coalitions' unfavorable
portrayal of him.
Even though this message may have been
a bit painful, the administration should real
ize that more openness reaped rewards. With
one Web site for all University information
on the labor action, students could find out
both sides fairly easily, and the administra
tion seemed like less of a heartless corpora
tion.
Stanford should not take our approval as
a blank check. The administration should
have good reasons for sending bulk e-mails
and should be prepared to take criticism for
it.
Most importantly, none of our approval
or disapproval relates to the actual content
of negotiations. Both the unions and the
University have work to do, and no one's
claims are absolutely justified. The develop
ment of negotiations in coming weeks
should prove informative as to the integrity
and rationality of both sides of the issue.
