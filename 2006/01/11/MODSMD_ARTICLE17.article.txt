## What motivates stem cell studies? 
### KENNETH GUNDLE 
Two of the arguments for federal
funding of embryonic stem cell re
search are based on differing ideas
regarding the objective of scientific
research.
The first argument is that scientif
ic research aims to discover truth in
the world, and this process of so
called progress should not be hin
dered by ideological opposition. For
example. Nobel Laureate, professor
emeritus of biochemistry and promi
nent supporter of stem cell research
Paul Berg was quoted previously in
The Daily as saying, "The search for
new knowledge must have no
boundaries. It is the application of
that knowledge that can be the sub
ject for reasoned and informed de
bate." ("Recent genetic innovations
raise troubling ethical questions,"
Feb. 9,2004).
The second argument is that em
bryonic stem cell research, and scien
tific research more generally, will
lead to therapies that will cure dis
ease. Stanford's Dr. Irving Weiss
man. director of the Institute for
Cancer/Stem Cell Biology and Med
icine, told a U.S. Senate subcommit
tee in 2004 that those "who partici
pate in the banning or enforced de
lays of biomedical research that
could lead to the saving of lives and
the amelioration of suffering are di
rectly and morally responsible for
the lives made worse or lost."
There is a conflict between these
two arguments, for their objectives
are fundamentally different: One is
seeking truth, the other cures. It is
somewhat inconsistent to support
knowledge for the sake of knowl
edge and knowledge for the sake of
eradicating disease at the same time.
If the reason for the research is that
it will help patients, then research
that holds no promise of helping pa
tients need not be supported. Con
versely, if the basis for support is the
generation of knowledge, then it
hardly matters whether a patient is
cured.
Different though they are. these
objectives underlie many of the ar

guments for embryonic stem cell re
search seen in newspapers and re
search journals. Actions speaking
louder than newsprint, however.
One must examine the motivations
behind the research as it is actually
carried out. So as not to bias the
analysis by considering human
cloning advocates or other such
rogue groups, let us go straight to the
upper rung of the stem cell research
world — South Korean stem cell
hero Hwang Woo Suk. Named "Re
search Leader of the Year" by Scien
tific American just a few weeks ago,
it would be difficult to say he is out of
the fold (unless it is meant as praise).
Yet it has recently come to light
that not only were eggs from junior
researchers used in his research, but
it also appears that the data present
ed in a significant paper he published
with others in the nearly peerless and
peer-reviewed journal Science were
fabricated. The work was hailed for
its potential to lead to treatments for
degenerative diseases.
Yet now we are faced with the
question: What motivated this re
search? Was it the search for truth?
Was it the goal of curing disease?
The scientific community relies
on sharing data in journals as a
means for documenting objective
facts and spurring further studies. If
understanding the human body and
the rest of the world is the goal of sci
entific research, then journals are the
ongoing sacred writings that docu
ment the journey forward. If
Hwang's team's motivation for the
research was the pursuit of truth,
then it certainly and absolutely
would not knowingly lie about find
ings and desecrate the pages of a
journal with falsifications.
So. was it the pursuit of new treat
ments for disease that drove these
scientists? The findings of this study
gave new reason for patients and the
general public — who hear about
newly published findings in the
mainstream media — to hope. How
would falsifying data help patients?
How do we feel about the potential
for this research today, after hearing
about the scandal? It would now

take a nuanced argument, to say the
least, for me to believe that it is the
benefit of patients that motivates
Hwang. (Incidentally, the Scientific
American revoked Hwang's "re
search leader of the year" honor on
Dec. 15.)
Hwang does not speak for every
embryonic stem cell advocate, al
though he did give a talk at Stanford
in August that praised the great new
knowledge and treatments that em
bryonic stem cells can deliver.
Hwang is indeed an exception —
how many embryonic stem cell re
searchers have been called the "stem
cell king" and had a postage stamp
line based on their research?
On the other hand, probably an
equally few number of embryonic
stem cell researchers have been sus
pected of coercing or paying junior
colleagues to donate eggs and of fal
sifying one of the biggest publica
tions of the year. As a Stanford
graduate. I expect and pray that
such a gross display will never come
from any lab at the school (embry
onic stem cell or otherwise) —
though, to be honest, the possibility
had never crossed my mind before
this scandal.
The debate over federal funding
for embryonic stem cell research
will continue, and I have little doubt
that the same arguments will con
tinue to be heard. Certainly, I still
believe in the potential — but not
the guarantee — that scientific re
search can benefit society. What I
now have reason to consider more
seriously is whether or not the re
search is motivated by greed and
fame. There is no lack of people who
are driven by money or love of the
limelight. Yet when those people
argue for us to support them mone
tarily because they are seeking
"truth" or "a cure," we would be
right to be skeptical.

Yet it has recently come to light
that not only were eggs from junior
researchers used in his research, but
it also appears that the data present
ed in a significant paper he published
with others in the nearly peerless and
peer-reviewed journal Science were
fabricated. The work was hailed for
its potential to lead to treatments for
degenerative diseases.
Yet now we are faced with the
question: What motivated this re
search? Was it the search for truth?
Was it the goal of curing disease?
The scientific community relies
on sharing data in journals as a
means for documenting objective
facts and spurring further studies. If
understanding the human body and
the rest of the world is the goal of sci
entific research, then journals are the
ongoing sacred writings that docu
ment the journey forward. If
Hwang's team's motivation for the
research was the pursuit of truth,
then it certainly and absolutely
would not knowingly lie about find
ings and desecrate the pages of a
journal with falsifications.
So. was it the pursuit of new treat
ments for disease that drove these
scientists? The findings of this study
gave new reason for patients and the
general public — who hear about
newly published findings in the
mainstream media — to hope. How
would falsifying data help patients?
How do we feel about the potential
for this research today, after hearing
about the scandal? It would now

take a nuanced argument, to say the
least, for me to believe that it is the
benefit of patients that motivates
Hwang. (Incidentally, the Scientific
American revoked Hwang's "re
search leader of the year" honor on
Dec. 15.)
Hwang does not speak for every
embryonic stem cell advocate, al
though he did give a talk at Stanford
in August that praised the great new
knowledge and treatments that em
bryonic stem cells can deliver.
Hwang is indeed an exception —
how many embryonic stem cell re
searchers have been called the "stem
cell king" and had a postage stamp
line based on their research?
On the other hand, probably an
equally few number of embryonic
stem cell researchers have been sus
pected of coercing or paying junior
colleagues to donate eggs and of fal
sifying one of the biggest publica
tions of the year. As a Stanford
graduate. I expect and pray that
such a gross display will never come
from any lab at the school (embry
onic stem cell or otherwise) —
though, to be honest, the possibility
had never crossed my mind before
this scandal.
The debate over federal funding
for embryonic stem cell research
will continue, and I have little doubt
that the same arguments will con
tinue to be heard. Certainly, I still
believe in the potential — but not
the guarantee — that scientific re
search can benefit society. What I
now have reason to consider more
seriously is whether or not the re
search is motivated by greed and
fame. There is no lack of people who
are driven by money or love of the
limelight. Yet when those people
argue for us to support them mone
tarily because they are seeking
"truth" or "a cure," we would be
right to be skeptical.

Two of the arguments for federal
funding of embryonic stem cell re
search are based on differing ideas
regarding the objective of scientific
research.
The first argument is that scientif
ic research aims to discover truth in
the world, and this process of so
called progress should not be hin
dered by ideological opposition. For
example. Nobel Laureate, professor
emeritus of biochemistry and promi
nent supporter of stem cell research
Paul Berg was quoted previously in
The Daily as saying, "The search for
new knowledge must have no
boundaries. It is the application of
that knowledge that can be the sub
ject for reasoned and informed de
bate." ("Recent genetic innovations
raise troubling ethical questions,"
Feb. 9,2004).
The second argument is that em
bryonic stem cell research, and scien
tific research more generally, will
lead to therapies that will cure dis
ease. Stanford's Dr. Irving Weiss
man. director of the Institute for
Cancer/Stem Cell Biology and Med
icine, told a U.S. Senate subcommit
tee in 2004 that those "who partici
pate in the banning or enforced de
lays of biomedical research that
could lead to the saving of lives and
the amelioration of suffering are di
rectly and morally responsible for
the lives made worse or lost."
There is a conflict between these
two arguments, for their objectives
are fundamentally different: One is
seeking truth, the other cures. It is
somewhat inconsistent to support
knowledge for the sake of knowl
edge and knowledge for the sake of
eradicating disease at the same time.
If the reason for the research is that
it will help patients, then research
that holds no promise of helping pa
tients need not be supported. Con
versely, if the basis for support is the
generation of knowledge, then it
hardly matters whether a patient is
cured.
Different though they are. these
objectives underlie many of the ar

guments for embryonic stem cell re
search seen in newspapers and re
search journals. Actions speaking
louder than newsprint, however.
One must examine the motivations
behind the research as it is actually
carried out. So as not to bias the
analysis by considering human
cloning advocates or other such
rogue groups, let us go straight to the
upper rung of the stem cell research
world — South Korean stem cell
hero Hwang Woo Suk. Named "Re
search Leader of the Year" by Scien
tific American just a few weeks ago,
it would be difficult to say he is out of
the fold (unless it is meant as praise).
Yet it has recently come to light
that not only were eggs from junior
researchers used in his research, but
it also appears that the data present
ed in a significant paper he published
with others in the nearly peerless and
peer-reviewed journal Science were
