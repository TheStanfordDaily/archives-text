# Facebook goes public, with us?
## 
### 
The Facebook.com may seem like the typical,
friendly neighborhood Web site that somehow re
mains free despite being horribly unprofitable, but
consider the following:
• The Facebook has the ninth most hits among all
Web sites in the United States.
• It was valued at $ 1 (H) million at last call, but is prob
ably worth four times that.
• Its founder, Mark Zuckerberg.is a 21-year-old Har
vard dropout whose business card reads, "I'm CEO...
bitch."
I had a drink with a friend over winter break, and
when the conversation turned to Facebook, I quickly
rattled off these facts and then a few more. Stanford. I
continued, wouldn't let something related to the Inter
net slip through its fingers. By the time the site had
reached 30 schools (it now serves over 2.000), Pay Pal
founder and Stanford alum Peter Thiel provided the
seed financing for Facebook and suggested Zuckerberg
move the company to the Bay Area. As a result,
Zuckerberg periodically pops up around campus to
speak about his company and innovation, or fora game
of Beirut. It was at this point that my friend became
slightly exasperated.
"You have to tell him something," he said.
"I don't really know him. but what?"
"People have been trying to e-mail Facebook about
the relationship feature. The site needs to say how long
you've been in the relationship." he said, growing more
emphatic. "Or maybe even eliminate the feature all to
gether."
I was confused. 1 didn't understand what he was talk
ing about. "What do you mean, if you're in a relationship,
why should you care?"
"It's a huge commitment to have a Facebook rela
tionship. It just gets sprung on you. and you're done.
Game over — thanks for playing. It's the biggest cock
block on Earth."
And that's when I got it. My friend is in a frat at the
University of Texas, and life ain't too bad when you can
be discreet and roam free. He didn't really care about it
himself: he's been in a relationship since before Face
book reached UT. But some of his frat buddies have ex
perienced serious Facebook-related turbulence in their
love lives.
The site is a good example of how technology can
suddenly and very quietly change an aspect of the
human experience. For the last 10,000 years of human
history, what were the only ways you could determine if
somebody was in a relationship? You had to hear them
say it or find out from a friend. Depending on your de
gree of separation, you could come to that information
immediately, or over the course of weeks or maybe
never.
That mystery, or information asymmetry, has been
the source of countless soap opera tragedies, classic
Hollywood romances and real-life dramas. People's
ability to do a little fishing on the side has led both to in
fidelities and to discoveries of more meaningful rela
tionships. But with two-thirds of Facebook users ac
cessing the site every day and able to obtain anybody

else's relationship status, that dynamic is quickly be
coming history.
The Internet is famous for reducing information
asymmetries and has reshaped entire industries. Studies
show that the information asymmetries that once al
lowed car dealers to dupe customers into overpaying,
travel agents to command lucrative fees for booking
flights and insurance companies to charge higher premi
ums have been severely eroded by consumer access to
information on the Internet. Over 70 percent of vehicle
purchases, for instance, are preceded by Internet search
es to compare and determine value. As a result, con
sumers enter the negotiation process with far more
knowledge than ever before.
Similarly, Facebook has reduced an information
asymmetry by introducing a binary, public statement of
relationship status immediately accessible to anybody.
Think about the practical implications.
What if your significant other declares a relationship
on Facebook and you're "not there yet?" That puts you
in a tough spot, especially if you're possibly interested in
somebody else at the time. What if your relationship is on
the rocks and your friends take you out to test the wa
ters? Any prospect you meet will return home, check
Facebook. and write you off as either a bastard or a tease.
What if you just like to keep it interesting? Keep your
significant other on his or her toes? Shouldn 'tit be an op
tion?
With something as complicated as relationships,
there has traditionally been ambiguity. Embedded in
the word "relationship" is a continuum of possibilities
ranging from wedding bells to mutual malcontent. The
Facebook fails to capture these nuances, publishing a bi
nary "status" to achieve at least some informational
value. You might applaud this information as expediting
the negotiation (dating) process, or you might think
human romance is in need of more mystery. Either way,
it's good to be mindful of how the technological won
ders we let into our lives, like Facebook. modify the
human experience.
So tough luck, UT Frat Boy. Zuckerberg's in the
house, and he just IPOed your ass into couplehood. But
I guess when Zuckerberg's IPO comes around, he
won't be having the same trouble — life is pretty good
when your net worth rivals the likes of Tom Cruise and
Jay-Z.

Is your name Mark Zuckerherg? Do you want to give me
options? You can reach me at the GSB, toiling tragically
and paying $70k per year to do it. My address is
