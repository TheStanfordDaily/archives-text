## Hate him or love him, but either way Kobe's on top 
### 
The detractors — and there certainly are a lot of
them — don't like him because he's selfish. He's im
pulsive and his play exudes an air of capriciousness
(except when one expects him to pass the ball for
only one of two reasons: to garner an assist or to get
the ball back in a more opportune position fora
shot).
They also don't like him because of his off-court
troubles and the media-labeled me-first attitude he
brings to the game. This leads to view that he is, by
and large, bad for the team-game that is basketball.
This aura of disapproval is what critics see when
they observe the self-proclaimed "Mamba" in ac
tion. He just can't get away from the negativity. But
I argue in favor of Kobe Wan Kenobi Bryant's true
greatness (don't blame me, this was the top finisher
in ESPN's Kobe nickname poll held a few years
back).
Many simply don't want to recognize his extraor
dinary and historic talent. And even if you are in the
flock of believers that considers him an exceptional
basketball player, but a far cry from being the ideal
team leader he should be, I'm here to convince you
that he is an immortal among mortals on the court.
At 28, now a 10-year NBA veteran and in the
prime of his career, Kobe is only now hitting his
stride as a basketball player. He has been known
worldwide on a first name basis from virtually the
start of his NBA career — a feat that can only be
claimed by the likes of Wilt, Kareem, Magic,
Michael and Shaq. Kobe came into the NBA with a
bang by scoring a record 31 points in the Rookie
game over the All-Star Weekend and has played in
every All-Star Game since his second year in the
league.
With his scoring average increasing significantly
each year for the first five years of his career and his
assists doing the same in the first seven, Kobe rose
to become one of the most feared perimeter players
in the game while at the same time becoming known
as the All-American posterchild for the NBA. He
took risks — a last second air-ball three-pointer in a
playoff elimination game his rookie season — but
he showed he had the guts to do it at a young age.
After a widely publicized bad decision and ensu
ing legal troubles in 2003, Kobe's image didn't begin
to go downhill — it took a plunge. But as a basket
ball player and an athlete, he still stood out as the
one to root for. He had a work ethic and drive for
success paralleling, if not exceeding, the best ever.
And it paid off in his play.
Critics assert that his attitude led to the breakup
and meltdown of the Lakers, but remember it was
Shaq who couldn't handle the prospect of being sec
ond-fiddle to Kobe and asked fora trade. It was
Phil's decision to take a break from coaching, but
the situation wasn't that bad since he came back to
Kobe and the Lakers a season later.
And in the same breath, critics will now down
play Kobe's heroics of the current season with any
of the following excuses: 1) he dominates the ball so
much that his teammates get out of sync; 2) the
record shows that he can't lead a team to the cham
pionship level; 3) though his points are up, his re
bounds and assists are down, so he's not making his
teammates better; or 4) all of the above.
But let me offer you these explanations. The
Lakers' supporting cast has nothing on Scottie and
the boys of the Jordan-led Bulls. If you've seen the
Lakers in action this season, it seems that every win
is coming from Kobe's will to win. and this includes
trusting his teammates at times.
Some may look at the man competing most
fiercely with Bryant for this year's scoring crown.
Allen Iverson, and say that he has more assists and
takes fewer shots than Kobe. But the 76ers' roster
also has Kyle Korver, Andre Iguodola and Chris
Webber. These are players who know their roles on
the team.
Kobe's not the leading scorer from his own draft;
that would be Allen Iverson. He Co-owns the record
for most consecutive three-pointers made in a game
and the most three-balls made in a game, yet he's
not the marksman that others in that'% draft are
(see: Peja Stojakovic and Ray Allen). The thing
about Kobe is that as great as he is, he's also contin
uing to learn.
When judging Kobe as a ball-hog who doesn't
make his team better, remember that Jordan aver
aged 27.8 shots per game the year he averaged his
peak 37.1 points per game. Kobe has yet to reach
that shot average. Yet he is averaging 48 points,
more than nine rebounds and five assists per game
in the Lakers' latest three-game win streak. In the
two games without him. the Lakers fell to Utah
twice. His four consecutive games with at least 45
points surpassed Jordan and was a first since Wilt
Chamberlain in 1%4.
Bryant is not Jordan, but that's because he does
n't want to be. Jordan wasn't the next Wilt. He was
n't the next Julius Erving. He wasn't the next any
body. He was Michael Jordan. Kobe Bryant wants to
be Kobe Brvant.

for most consecutive three-pointers made in a game
and the most three-balls made in a game, yet he's
not the marksman that others in that'% draft are
(see: Peja Stojakovic and Ray Allen). The thing
about Kobe is that as great as he is, he's also contin
uing to learn.
When judging Kobe as a ball-hog who doesn't
make his team better, remember that Jordan aver
aged 27.8 shots per game the year he averaged his
peak 37.1 points per game. Kobe has yet to reach
that shot average. Yet he is averaging 48 points,
more than nine rebounds and five assists per game
in the Lakers' latest three-game win streak. In the
two games without him. the Lakers fell to Utah
twice. His four consecutive games with at least 45
points surpassed Jordan and was a first since Wilt
Chamberlain in 1%4.
Bryant is not Jordan, but that's because he does
n't want to be. Jordan wasn't the next Wilt. He was
n't the next Julius Erving. He wasn't the next any
body. He was Michael Jordan. Kobe Bryant wants to
be Kobe Brvant.

The detractors — and there certainly are a lot of
them — don't like him because he's selfish. He's im
pulsive and his play exudes an air of capriciousness
(except when one expects him to pass the ball for
only one of two reasons: to garner an assist or to get
the ball back in a more opportune position fora
shot).
They also don't like him because of his off-court
troubles and the media-labeled me-first attitude he
brings to the game. This leads to view that he is, by
and large, bad for the team-game that is basketball.
This aura of disapproval is what critics see when
they observe the self-proclaimed "Mamba" in ac
tion. He just can't get away from the negativity. But
I argue in favor of Kobe Wan Kenobi Bryant's true
greatness (don't blame me, this was the top finisher
in ESPN's Kobe nickname poll held a few years
back).
Many simply don't want to recognize his extraor
dinary and historic talent. And even if you are in the
flock of believers that considers him an exceptional
basketball player, but a far cry from being the ideal
team leader he should be, I'm here to convince you
that he is an immortal among mortals on the court.
At 28, now a 10-year NBA veteran and in the
prime of his career, Kobe is only now hitting his
stride as a basketball player. He has been known
worldwide on a first name basis from virtually the
start of his NBA career — a feat that can only be
claimed by the likes of Wilt, Kareem, Magic,
Michael and Shaq. Kobe came into the NBA with a
bang by scoring a record 31 points in the Rookie
game over the All-Star Weekend and has played in
every All-Star Game since his second year in the
league.
With his scoring average increasing significantly
each year for the first five years of his career and his
assists doing the same in the first seven, Kobe rose
to become one of the most feared perimeter players
in the game while at the same time becoming known
as the All-American posterchild for the NBA. He
took risks — a last second air-ball three-pointer in a
playoff elimination game his rookie season — but
he showed he had the guts to do it at a young age.
After a widely publicized bad decision and ensu
ing legal troubles in 2003, Kobe's image didn't begin
to go downhill — it took a plunge. But as a basket
ball player and an athlete, he still stood out as the
one to root for. He had a work ethic and drive for
success paralleling, if not exceeding, the best ever.
And it paid off in his play.
Critics assert that his attitude led to the breakup
and meltdown of the Lakers, but remember it was
Shaq who couldn't handle the prospect of being sec
ond-fiddle to Kobe and asked fora trade. It was
Phil's decision to take a break from coaching, but
the situation wasn't that bad since he came back to
Kobe and the Lakers a season later.
And in the same breath, critics will now down
play Kobe's heroics of the current season with any
of the following excuses: 1) he dominates the ball so
much that his teammates get out of sync; 2) the
record shows that he can't lead a team to the cham
pionship level; 3) though his points are up, his re
bounds and assists are down, so he's not making his
teammates better; or 4) all of the above.
But let me offer you these explanations. The
Lakers' supporting cast has nothing on Scottie and
the boys of the Jordan-led Bulls. If you've seen the
Lakers in action this season, it seems that every win
is coming from Kobe's will to win. and this includes
trusting his teammates at times.
Some may look at the man competing most
fiercely with Bryant for this year's scoring crown.
Allen Iverson, and say that he has more assists and
takes fewer shots than Kobe. But the 76ers' roster
also has Kyle Korver, Andre Iguodola and Chris
Webber. These are players who know their roles on
the team.
Kobe's not the leading scorer from his own draft;
that would be Allen Iverson. He Co-owns the record
for most consecutive three-pointers made in a game
and the most three-balls made in a game, yet he's
