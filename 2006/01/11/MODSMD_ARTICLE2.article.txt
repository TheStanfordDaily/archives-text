# Labor Update
## LOCAL CONFLICT ONE OF MANY THROUGHOUT NATION 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
Negotiators from the Univer
sity will meet with union leaders
representing workers today for
the first time since Dec. 13 to dis
cuss re-opened portions of their
contract. The unionized workers
went on a one-day strike last
month and have threatened a
longer work stoppage if the Uni
versity does not make certain
benefit guarantees.
In many ways, organized
labor s struggle at Stanford to ex
pand and solidify benefits is a mi
crocosm fora national struggle
between management and
unions across the private sector.
In nearly a dozen interviews with

The Daily, labor, legal and economic experts described a conflu
ence of factors, including globalization, automation, internal dis
pute. competitive pressures and regulation that have weakened
unions and made their future unclear.
Increased challenges in collective bargaining over recent years
have more often than not given employers the upper hand in ne
gotiations over benefits. Now, with declining enrollment and serv
ice jobs replacing traditional unionized manufacturing jobs,
unions are struggling to maintain relevance.
Law Prof. William Gould, former chairman of the National
Labor Relations Board under President Bill Clinton, said that
"Stanford is a part of the general puzzle that labor and manage
ment is confronted by."
Unions Shrinking
Unions have been shrinking in a downward spiral for the past
half century.
"The fraction of workers whose wages are covered by collec
tive bargaining agreements has fallen significantly over the past 30
years, especially in the private sector," said Economics Prof. John
Pencavel.
Law Prof. Charles Craver, who specializes in labor arbitration
and collective bargaining at George Washington University, called
the situation "dire."
"If unions are unable to do anything more in the private sector,
they will become almost irrelevant," he said.
As union membership has declined, unions have also been lag
ging in securing wage increases for the workers they represent.
" The decline of union strength in the U.S. corresponds to a de
cline in the ability of workers to reap higher wages as a result of
higher productivity," said Stanford alum and University of Utah
