# Labor Update
## LOCAL CONFLICT ONE OF MANY THROUGHOUT NATION 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
Negotiators from the Univer
sity will meet with union leaders
representing workers today for
the first time since Dec. 13 to dis
cuss re-opened portions of their
contract. The unionized workers
went on a one-day strike last
month and have threatened a
longer work stoppage if the Uni
versity does not make certain
benefit guarantees.
In many ways, organized
labor s struggle at Stanford to ex
pand and solidify benefits is a mi
crocosm fora national struggle
between management and
unions across the private sector.
In nearly a dozen interviews with

The Daily, labor, legal and economic experts described a conflu
ence of factors, including globalization, automation, internal dis
pute. competitive pressures and regulation that have weakened
unions and made their future unclear.
Increased challenges in collective bargaining over recent years
have more often than not given employers the upper hand in ne
gotiations over benefits. Now, with declining enrollment and serv
ice jobs replacing traditional unionized manufacturing jobs,
unions are struggling to maintain relevance.
Law Prof. William Gould, former chairman of the National
Labor Relations Board under President Bill Clinton, said that
"Stanford is a part of the general puzzle that labor and manage
ment is confronted by."
Unions Shrinking
Unions have been shrinking in a downward spiral for the past
half century.
"The fraction of workers whose wages are covered by collec
tive bargaining agreements has fallen significantly over the past 30
years, especially in the private sector," said Economics Prof. John
Pencavel.
Law Prof. Charles Craver, who specializes in labor arbitration
and collective bargaining at George Washington University, called
the situation "dire."
"If unions are unable to do anything more in the private sector,
they will become almost irrelevant," he said.
As union membership has declined, unions have also been lag
ging in securing wage increases for the workers they represent.
" The decline of union strength in the U.S. corresponds to a de
cline in the ability of workers to reap higher wages as a result of
higher productivity," said Stanford alum and University of Utah

Economics Prof. Peter Philips. "Pro
ductivity has been growing steadily,
but real wage rates have largely stag
nated with very little real inflation
adjusted growth in wages.
"Real wages are not rising be
cause workers do not have the bar
gaining power that they once did,"
concluded Philips, who specializes in
labor market analysis.
The Cause
Several diverse factors are at
work.
"Decades of really significant
changes in the economy and some
pretty strong political frontal as
saults have taken their toll," said
University of Illinois Prof. Robert
Bruno.
Globalization and an increase in
imports have reduced the clout of
unions and American workers by in
creasing competition and giving em
ployers more leverage than ever.
"The opening of Eastern Europe
and other parts of the world has al
lowed labor to shift to places where it
is frighteningly cheap, and there are
not safeguards that we have grown
accustomed to in the United States,"
explained Bruno, who is also a coor
dinator of the Illinois-based Institute
of Labor and Industrial Relations.
"Many employers are able and
willing to pick up facilities and go
elsewhere," Gould said.
"Unions just cannot combat the

tides of the global economy," added
Craver, who noted that even hospital
work like reading X-rays can be sent
overseas. "We are pulling up lower
class countries like India, Ireland
and China. As a result, the real wages
of workers in wealthy countries are
going down."
"You can't pack up a university
like Stanford and take it to China,
but you can move some of the jobs to
China," added Bruno.
All employers, including Stan
ford, gain leverage because of glob
alization. There is increased pressure
across the market to accept reduced
benefits so employers can stay glob
ally competitive.
Immigration has created a flood
of workers into the United States
who will work for low wages and who
do not want to unionize for fear of
deportation. This has only added to
competitive pressure on unionized
employees.
"Undocumented workers are dif
ficult to organize," said Gould, who
pointed to disputes in Los Angeles
and Houston as examples.
Many believe that this competi
tion is the biggest factor undermin
ing the power of unions.
"The fundamental reason [for the
decline in union membership] is that
it is difficult for unions to survive in
the long-run in a competitive econo
my," Pencavel said. "Unions raise
costs by raising wages over what they
would otherwise be. In a world
where you are in competition with
non-union firms, you will not grow as
fast as your competitors."
One exception is public employee
unions. Public sector workers —

those employed by the government
— have been joining unions because
many of the factors affecting most
workers do not affect them, Craver
said. Government jobs are not out
sourced, there is little competition
and the government does not feel
quite the crunch to insist on benefit
concessions.
"The fact that unionism has
shrunk in the private sector but not
in the public sector tells you that
when a sector is shielded from com
petition. unions can slide," Pencavel
said.
Bruno explained that complacen
cy among the leadership of labor
unions was also important in the
stagnation.
"A whole cohort of workers came
into the marketplace without a con
sciousness to the need for unions," he
said. "Organized labor became
rather complacent. The leadership
lost contact and stopped trying to re
plenish membership."
Ineffective strikes and a supply of
replacement workers have also
turned the tables on unions that were
able to successfully use strikes or
threats of strikes to gain leverage in
the past. Increasingly, employers
have been demanding concessions
from workers. When some conces
sions are made, other employers in
the industry become emboldened to
ask for more concessions.
"We're at a point where many
employers think they can take on the
unions and win," said Craver, citing
the Delphi auto parts company deci
sions to move jobs abroad, the IBM
pension cuts and the failure of the
Northwest Airlines mechanics to
reach a deal.
Further inequality in the labor
force has expanded as unions have
weakened.
"Workers have not shared in the
economic gains of recent years be
cause they have no collective voice,"
said Craver, who claimed that execu
tives make 500 times more than the
average worker.
Jared Bernstein, an economist at
the Economic Policy Institute said

the decline has impacted the well
being of employees in the workplace.
"It is no coincidence that over the
period when unions have become
such a diminished presence in our
economy, we have so much more
economic inequality," he told gov
ernment broadcasting service Voice
of America in July.
Service Employees
•
The United States economy has
shifted from being manufacturing
based to a service-sector economy.
Traditional manufacturing jobs —
requiring relatively little skill —
have been shipped overseas to work
ers who will do the same jobs for far
lower pay. As a result, higher-skilled
jobs have become more prevalent
stateside.
"Foreign competition has wiped
out most manufacturing in the Unit
ed States," Gould said. "The nature
of the employment relationship has
changed."
At Stanford, both the University
and Hospital workers are represent
ed by Service Employees Interna
tional Union (SEIU) Local 715.
Their status as service workers
makes them particularly vulnerable
in the changing labor market, ob
servers say. They are better off than
their manufacturing counterparts,
though in the sense that it is difficult
to outsource many of the union jobs
at Stanford.
"Service employees have always
been in a more difficult position,"
Gould said. "You are dealing with
work that is more labor intensive.
Unlike manufacturing, it is more dif
ficult for employees outside of man
ufacturing to absorb increased costs
through labor saving devices."
Car makers were able to make
substantial gains by employing fewer
people with technical innovation.
Stanford does not have the same op
tion.
"This poses a greater challenge
for service workers at Stanford."
Gould said.
"The unions have not been very
effective at organizing employees in

the information economy," he
added. "They have been unable to
compensate for losses from deregu
lation of the autos, rails and airlines."
The Split
As a result of all the changes, the
future of collective bargaining is un
clear. After decades of somewhat
hushed disagreement among union
leaders, a contentious debate on the
best strategy to reverse these mem
bership losses boiled to the surface
last summer. A massive schism de
veloped when the SEIU. the Team
sters and other smaller unions joined
in a coalition to split from the AFL
CIO, a federation of labor organiza
tions. As a result of the rebellion, the
union lost more than 30 percent of its
13 million workers.
Higher-paid professionals be
lieved political mobilization held the
key to increased influence. Lower
paid service workers — whose jobs
are most replaceable or threatened
by automation — felt that unions
should focus their resources on in
creasing recruitment and adding
new members to their ranks.
Dan Cornfield, a labor expert and
professor of sociology at Vanderbilt
University, argued that the rift with
in the AFL-CIO was more about
class than power.
l"he split was"a response to the
AFL-ClO's not giving priority to re
cruiting low-wage workers, who are
also disproportionately women, eth
nic-racial minorities and immigrants,
while the unions who continue to
identify with the AFL-CIO tend to
represent better-paid workers in the
unionized large corporations in
heavy industry, communications,
transportation, the public sector and
the skilled building trades," he wrote
on the Vanderbilt Web site.
Cornfield said a full split among
the unions could endanger the labor
movement, but predicted that will be
short-term membership gains and a
likely improvement in the well-being
of the lowest-paid, least skilled
workers.
"The SEIU has been quite active

and innovative under Andrew
Stern's leadership "said Craver.who
anticipates the unions will be
strengthened by the split.
"The SEIU is more concerned
with organizing the unorganized"
Gould said. "These more aggressive
recruitment efforts may result in
more new members. The labor
movement can only thrive and help
employees if it is active and expand
ing."
Others say the split also served as
a wake up call to the old-school
union leadership.
"The split that occurred caused
the AFL. in its present form, to take
more seriously the amount of re
sources it puts into organizing,"
Bruno said. "The split has had a pos
itive effect at getting people to re
think how best to effectively organ
ize workers. These issues are finally
being thought about and studied."
Some experts think the split has
quelled some of the bitterness.
"I think the worst is over in that
the two sides have overcome some of
their initial bitterness or bad feel
ings," said Ruth Milkman, director of
the Institute of Industrial Relations
;it the UCLA in the Christian Sci
ence Monitor last month. "Both
sides are trying harder to prove that
they were right in the debate that oc
curred in the last year and a half.That
can only benefit the labor movement
as a whole."
For Gould, the prospects for the
future of labor in America "are not
good." He said that he is not particu
larly upbeat about where the parties
are going in the future. Gould added
that it is too soon to say what impact
the breakup of the AFL-CIO will
have on organized labor. He thinks
that, on balance, the development
may help labor more than it hurts.
Bruno said that there are 40 mil
lion service employees who are not
unionized and that polling numbers
show at least half would be willing to
organize.
"The split allows the new SEIU to
focus on the massive number of un
unionized service workers," he said.

The Split
As a result of all the changes, the
future of collective bargaining is un
clear. After decades of somewhat
hushed disagreement among union
leaders, a contentious debate on the
best strategy to reverse these mem
bership losses boiled to the surface
last summer. A massive schism de
veloped when the SEIU. the Team
sters and other smaller unions joined
in a coalition to split from the AFL
CIO, a federation of labor organiza
tions. As a result of the rebellion, the
union lost more than 30 percent of its
13 million workers.
Higher-paid professionals be
lieved political mobilization held the
key to increased influence. Lower
paid service workers — whose jobs
are most replaceable or threatened
by automation — felt that unions
should focus their resources on in
creasing recruitment and adding
new members to their ranks.
Dan Cornfield, a labor expert and
professor of sociology at Vanderbilt
University, argued that the rift with
in the AFL-CIO was more about
class than power.
l"he split was"a response to the
AFL-ClO's not giving priority to re
cruiting low-wage workers, who are
also disproportionately women, eth
nic-racial minorities and immigrants,
while the unions who continue to
identify with the AFL-CIO tend to
represent better-paid workers in the
unionized large corporations in
heavy industry, communications,
transportation, the public sector and
the skilled building trades," he wrote
on the Vanderbilt Web site.
Cornfield said a full split among
the unions could endanger the labor
movement, but predicted that will be
short-term membership gains and a
likely improvement in the well-being
of the lowest-paid, least skilled
workers.
"The SEIU has been quite active

and innovative under Andrew
Stern's leadership "said Craver.who
anticipates the unions will be
strengthened by the split.
"The SEIU is more concerned
with organizing the unorganized"
Gould said. "These more aggressive
recruitment efforts may result in
more new members. The labor
movement can only thrive and help
employees if it is active and expand
ing."
Others say the split also served as
a wake up call to the old-school
union leadership.
"The split that occurred caused
the AFL. in its present form, to take
more seriously the amount of re
sources it puts into organizing,"
Bruno said. "The split has had a pos
itive effect at getting people to re
think how best to effectively organ
ize workers. These issues are finally
being thought about and studied."
Some experts think the split has
quelled some of the bitterness.
"I think the worst is over in that
the two sides have overcome some of
their initial bitterness or bad feel
ings," said Ruth Milkman, director of
the Institute of Industrial Relations
;it the UCLA in the Christian Sci
ence Monitor last month. "Both
sides are trying harder to prove that
they were right in the debate that oc
curred in the last year and a half.That
can only benefit the labor movement
as a whole."
For Gould, the prospects for the
future of labor in America "are not
good." He said that he is not particu
larly upbeat about where the parties
are going in the future. Gould added
that it is too soon to say what impact
the breakup of the AFL-CIO will
have on organized labor. He thinks
that, on balance, the development
may help labor more than it hurts.
Bruno said that there are 40 mil
lion service employees who are not
unionized and that polling numbers
show at least half would be willing to
organize.
"The split allows the new SEIU to
focus on the massive number of un
unionized service workers," he said.
Negotiators from the Univer
sity will meet with union leaders
representing workers today for
the first time since Dec. 13 to dis
cuss re-opened portions of their
contract. The unionized workers
went on a one-day strike last
month and have threatened a
longer work stoppage if the Uni
versity does not make certain
benefit guarantees.
In many ways, organized
labor s struggle at Stanford to ex
pand and solidify benefits is a mi
crocosm fora national struggle
between management and
unions across the private sector.

The Daily, labor, legal and economic experts described a conflu

Increased challenges in collective bargaining over recent years
have more often than not given employers the upper hand in ne
gotiations over benefits. Now, with declining enrollment and serv
ice jobs replacing traditional unionized manufacturing jobs,
unions are struggling to maintain relevance.
Law Prof. William Gould, former chairman of the National
Labor Relations Board under President Bill Clinton, said that
"Stanford is a part of the general puzzle that labor and manage

Unions Shrinking
Unions have been shrinking in a downward spiral for the past
half century.
"The fraction of workers whose wages are covered by collec

years, especially in the private sector," said Economics Prof. John
Pencavel.
Law Prof. Charles Craver, who specializes in labor arbitration
and collective bargaining at George Washington University, called
the situation "dire."
"If unions are unable to do anything more in the private sector,
they will become almost irrelevant," he said.
As union membership has declined, unions have also been lag
ging in securing wage increases for the workers they represent.
" The decline of union strength in the U.S. corresponds to a de
cline in the ability of workers to reap higher wages as a result of
higher productivity," said Stanford alum and University of Utah

Economics Prof. Peter Philips. "Pro
ductivity has been growing steadily,
but real wage rates have largely stag
nated with very little real inflation
adjusted growth in wages.
"Real wages are not rising be
cause workers do not have the bar
gaining power that they once did,"
concluded Philips, who specializes in
labor market analysis.
The Cause
Several diverse factors are at
work.
"Decades of really significant
changes in the economy and some
pretty strong political frontal as
saults have taken their toll," said
University of Illinois Prof. Robert
Bruno.
Globalization and an increase in
imports have reduced the clout of
unions and American workers by in
creasing competition and giving em
ployers more leverage than ever.
"The opening of Eastern Europe
and other parts of the world has al
lowed labor to shift to places where it
is frighteningly cheap, and there are
not safeguards that we have grown
accustomed to in the United States,"
explained Bruno, who is also a coor
dinator of the Illinois-based Institute
of Labor and Industrial Relations.
"Many employers are able and
willing to pick up facilities and go
elsewhere," Gould said.
"Unions just cannot combat the

tides of the global economy," added
Craver, who noted that even hospital
work like reading X-rays can be sent
overseas. "We are pulling up lower
class countries like India, Ireland
and China. As a result, the real wages
of workers in wealthy countries are
going down."
"You can't pack up a university
like Stanford and take it to China,
but you can move some of the jobs to
China," added Bruno.
All employers, including Stan
ford, gain leverage because of glob
alization. There is increased pressure
across the market to accept reduced
benefits so employers can stay glob
ally competitive.
Immigration has created a flood
of workers into the United States
who will work for low wages and who
do not want to unionize for fear of
deportation. This has only added to
competitive pressure on unionized
employees.
"Undocumented workers are dif
ficult to organize," said Gould, who
pointed to disputes in Los Angeles
and Houston as examples.
Many believe that this competi
tion is the biggest factor undermin
ing the power of unions.
"The fundamental reason [for the
decline in union membership] is that
it is difficult for unions to survive in
the long-run in a competitive econo
my," Pencavel said. "Unions raise
costs by raising wages over what they
would otherwise be. In a world
where you are in competition with
non-union firms, you will not grow as
fast as your competitors."
One exception is public employee
unions. Public sector workers —

those employed by the government
— have been joining unions because
many of the factors affecting most
workers do not affect them, Craver
said. Government jobs are not out
sourced, there is little competition
and the government does not feel
quite the crunch to insist on benefit
concessions.
"The fact that unionism has
shrunk in the private sector but not
in the public sector tells you that
when a sector is shielded from com
petition. unions can slide," Pencavel
said.
Bruno explained that complacen
cy among the leadership of labor
unions was also important in the
stagnation.
"A whole cohort of workers came
into the marketplace without a con
sciousness to the need for unions," he
said. "Organized labor became
rather complacent. The leadership
lost contact and stopped trying to re
plenish membership."
Ineffective strikes and a supply of
replacement workers have also
turned the tables on unions that were
able to successfully use strikes or
threats of strikes to gain leverage in
the past. Increasingly, employers
have been demanding concessions
from workers. When some conces
sions are made, other employers in
the industry become emboldened to
ask for more concessions.
"We're at a point where many
employers think they can take on the
unions and win," said Craver, citing
the Delphi auto parts company deci
sions to move jobs abroad, the IBM
pension cuts and the failure of the
Northwest Airlines mechanics to
reach a deal.
Further inequality in the labor
force has expanded as unions have
weakened.
"Workers have not shared in the
economic gains of recent years be
cause they have no collective voice,"
said Craver, who claimed that execu
tives make 500 times more than the
average worker.
Jared Bernstein, an economist at
the Economic Policy Institute said

the decline has impacted the well
being of employees in the workplace.
"It is no coincidence that over the
period when unions have become
such a diminished presence in our
economy, we have so much more
economic inequality," he told gov
ernment broadcasting service Voice
of America in July.
Service Employees
•
The United States economy has
shifted from being manufacturing
based to a service-sector economy.
Traditional manufacturing jobs —
requiring relatively little skill —
have been shipped overseas to work
ers who will do the same jobs for far
lower pay. As a result, higher-skilled
jobs have become more prevalent
stateside.
"Foreign competition has wiped
out most manufacturing in the Unit
ed States," Gould said. "The nature
of the employment relationship has
changed."
At Stanford, both the University
and Hospital workers are represent
ed by Service Employees Interna
tional Union (SEIU) Local 715.
Their status as service workers
makes them particularly vulnerable
in the changing labor market, ob
servers say. They are better off than
their manufacturing counterparts,
though in the sense that it is difficult
to outsource many of the union jobs
at Stanford.
"Service employees have always
been in a more difficult position,"
Gould said. "You are dealing with
work that is more labor intensive.
Unlike manufacturing, it is more dif
ficult for employees outside of man
ufacturing to absorb increased costs
through labor saving devices."
Car makers were able to make
substantial gains by employing fewer
people with technical innovation.
Stanford does not have the same op
tion.
"This poses a greater challenge
for service workers at Stanford."

of workers into the United States
who will work for low wages and who
do not want to unionize for fear of
deportation. This has only added to
competitive pressure on unionized
employees.
"Undocumented workers are dif
ficult to organize," said Gould, who
pointed to disputes in Los Angeles
and Houston as examples.
Many believe that this competi
tion is the biggest factor undermin
ing the power of unions.
"The fundamental reason [for the
decline in union membership] is that
it is difficult for unions to survive in
the long-run in a competitive econo
my," Pencavel said. "Unions raise
costs by raising wages over what they
would otherwise be. In a world
where you are in competition with
non-union firms, you will not grow as
fast as your competitors."
One exception is public employee
unions. Public sector workers —

those employed by the government
— have been joining unions because
many of the factors affecting most
workers do not affect them, Craver
said. Government jobs are not out
sourced, there is little competition
and the government does not feel
quite the crunch to insist on benefit
concessions.
"The fact that unionism has
shrunk in the private sector but not
in the public sector tells you that
when a sector is shielded from com
petition. unions can slide," Pencavel
said.
Bruno explained that complacen
cy among the leadership of labor
unions was also important in the
stagnation.
"A whole cohort of workers came
into the marketplace without a con
sciousness to the need for unions," he
said. "Organized labor became
rather complacent. The leadership
lost contact and stopped trying to re
plenish membership."
Ineffective strikes and a supply of
replacement workers have also
turned the tables on unions that were
able to successfully use strikes or
threats of strikes to gain leverage in
the past. Increasingly, employers
have been demanding concessions
from workers. When some conces
sions are made, other employers in
the industry become emboldened to
ask for more concessions.
"We're at a point where many
employers think they can take on the
unions and win," said Craver, citing
the Delphi auto parts company deci
sions to move jobs abroad, the IBM
pension cuts and the failure of the
Northwest Airlines mechanics to
reach a deal.
Further inequality in the labor
force has expanded as unions have
weakened.
"Workers have not shared in the
economic gains of recent years be
cause they have no collective voice,"
said Craver, who claimed that execu
tives make 500 times more than the
average worker.
Jared Bernstein, an economist at
the Economic Policy Institute said

the decline has impacted the well
being of employees in the workplace.
"It is no coincidence that over the
period when unions have become
such a diminished presence in our
economy, we have so much more
economic inequality," he told gov
ernment broadcasting service Voice
of America in July.
Service Employees
•
The United States economy has
shifted from being manufacturing
based to a service-sector economy.
Traditional manufacturing jobs —
requiring relatively little skill —
have been shipped overseas to work
ers who will do the same jobs for far
lower pay. As a result, higher-skilled
jobs have become more prevalent
stateside.
"Foreign competition has wiped
out most manufacturing in the Unit
ed States," Gould said. "The nature
of the employment relationship has
changed."
At Stanford, both the University
and Hospital workers are represent
ed by Service Employees Interna
tional Union (SEIU) Local 715.
Their status as service workers
makes them particularly vulnerable
in the changing labor market, ob
servers say. They are better off than
their manufacturing counterparts,
though in the sense that it is difficult
to outsource many of the union jobs
at Stanford.
"Service employees have always
been in a more difficult position,"
Gould said. "You are dealing with
work that is more labor intensive.
Unlike manufacturing, it is more dif
ficult for employees outside of man
ufacturing to absorb increased costs
through labor saving devices."
Car makers were able to make
substantial gains by employing fewer
people with technical innovation.
Stanford does not have the same op
tion.
"This poses a greater challenge
for service workers at Stanford."
Gould said.
"The unions have not been very
effective at organizing employees in

the information economy," he
added. "They have been unable to
compensate for losses from deregu
lation of the autos, rails and airlines."
The Split
As a result of all the changes, the
future of collective bargaining is un
clear. After decades of somewhat
hushed disagreement among union
leaders, a contentious debate on the
best strategy to reverse these mem
bership losses boiled to the surface
last summer. A massive schism de
veloped when the SEIU. the Team
sters and other smaller unions joined
in a coalition to split from the AFL
CIO, a federation of labor organiza
tions. As a result of the rebellion, the
union lost more than 30 percent of its
13 million workers.
Higher-paid professionals be
lieved political mobilization held the
key to increased influence. Lower
paid service workers — whose jobs
are most replaceable or threatened
by automation — felt that unions
should focus their resources on in
creasing recruitment and adding
new members to their ranks.
Dan Cornfield, a labor expert and
professor of sociology at Vanderbilt
University, argued that the rift with
in the AFL-CIO was more about
class than power.
l"he split was"a response to the
AFL-ClO's not giving priority to re
cruiting low-wage workers, who are
also disproportionately women, eth
nic-racial minorities and immigrants,
while the unions who continue to
identify with the AFL-CIO tend to
represent better-paid workers in the
unionized large corporations in
heavy industry, communications,
transportation, the public sector and
the skilled building trades," he wrote
on the Vanderbilt Web site.
Cornfield said a full split among
the unions could endanger the labor
movement, but predicted that will be
short-term membership gains and a
likely improvement in the well-being
of the lowest-paid, least skilled
workers.
"The SEIU has been quite active

and innovative under Andrew
Stern's leadership "said Craver.who
anticipates the unions will be
strengthened by the split.
"The SEIU is more concerned
with organizing the unorganized"
Gould said. "These more aggressive
recruitment efforts may result in
more new members. The labor
movement can only thrive and help
employees if it is active and expand
ing."
Others say the split also served as
a wake up call to the old-school
union leadership.
"The split that occurred caused
the AFL. in its present form, to take
more seriously the amount of re
sources it puts into organizing,"
Bruno said. "The split has had a pos
itive effect at getting people to re
think how best to effectively organ
ize workers. These issues are finally
being thought about and studied."
Some experts think the split has
quelled some of the bitterness.
"I think the worst is over in that
the two sides have overcome some of
their initial bitterness or bad feel
ings," said Ruth Milkman, director of
the Institute of Industrial Relations
;it the UCLA in the Christian Sci
ence Monitor last month. "Both
sides are trying harder to prove that
they were right in the debate that oc
curred in the last year and a half.That
can only benefit the labor movement
as a whole."
For Gould, the prospects for the
future of labor in America "are not
good." He said that he is not particu
larly upbeat about where the parties
are going in the future. Gould added
that it is too soon to say what impact
the breakup of the AFL-CIO will
have on organized labor. He thinks
that, on balance, the development
may help labor more than it hurts.
Bruno said that there are 40 mil
lion service employees who are not
unionized and that polling numbers
show at least half would be willing to
organize.
"The split allows the new SEIU to
focus on the massive number of un
unionized service workers," he said.
Negotiators from the Univer
sity will meet with union leaders
representing workers today for
the first time since Dec. 13 to dis
cuss re-opened portions of their
contract. The unionized workers
went on a one-day strike last
month and have threatened a
longer work stoppage if the Uni
versity does not make certain
benefit guarantees.
In many ways, organized
labor s struggle at Stanford to ex
pand and solidify benefits is a mi
crocosm fora national struggle
between management and
unions across the private sector.
In nearly a dozen interviews with

The Daily, labor, legal and economic experts described a conflu
ence of factors, including globalization, automation, internal dis
pute. competitive pressures and regulation that have weakened
unions and made their future unclear.
Increased challenges in collective bargaining over recent years
have more often than not given employers the upper hand in ne
gotiations over benefits. Now, with declining enrollment and serv
ice jobs replacing traditional unionized manufacturing jobs,
unions are struggling to maintain relevance.
Law Prof. William Gould, former chairman of the National
Labor Relations Board under President Bill Clinton, said that
"Stanford is a part of the general puzzle that labor and manage
ment is confronted by."
Unions Shrinking
Unions have been shrinking in a downward spiral for the past
half century.
"The fraction of workers whose wages are covered by collec
tive bargaining agreements has fallen significantly over the past 30
years, especially in the private sector," said Economics Prof. John
Pencavel.
Law Prof. Charles Craver, who specializes in labor arbitration
and collective bargaining at George Washington University, called
the situation "dire."
"If unions are unable to do anything more in the private sector,
they will become almost irrelevant," he said.
As union membership has declined, unions have also been lag
ging in securing wage increases for the workers they represent.
" The decline of union strength in the U.S. corresponds to a de
cline in the ability of workers to reap higher wages as a result of
higher productivity," said Stanford alum and University of Utah


PARTI
OF A SERIES
Economics Prof. Peter Philips. "Pro
ductivity has been growing steadily,
but real wage rates have largely stag
nated with very little real inflation
adjusted growth in wages.
"Real wages are not rising be
cause workers do not have the bar
gaining power that they once did,"
concluded Philips, who specializes in
labor market analysis.
The Cause
Several diverse factors are at
work.
"Decades of really significant
changes in the economy and some
pretty strong political frontal as
saults have taken their toll," said
University of Illinois Prof. Robert
Bruno.
Globalization and an increase in
imports have reduced the clout of
unions and American workers by in
creasing competition and giving em
ployers more leverage than ever.
"The opening of Eastern Europe
and other parts of the world has al
lowed labor to shift to places where it
is frighteningly cheap, and there are
not safeguards that we have grown
accustomed to in the United States,"
explained Bruno, who is also a coor
dinator of the Illinois-based Institute
of Labor and Industrial Relations.
"Many employers are able and
willing to pick up facilities and go
elsewhere," Gould said.
"Unions just cannot combat the

tides of the global economy," added
Craver, who noted that even hospital
work like reading X-rays can be sent
overseas. "We are pulling up lower
class countries like India, Ireland
and China. As a result, the real wages
of workers in wealthy countries are
going down."
"You can't pack up a university
like Stanford and take it to China,
but you can move some of the jobs to
China," added Bruno.
All employers, including Stan
ford, gain leverage because of glob
alization. There is increased pressure
across the market to accept reduced
benefits so employers can stay glob
ally competitive.
Immigration has created a flood
of workers into the United States
who will work for low wages and who
do not want to unionize for fear of
deportation. This has only added to
competitive pressure on unionized
employees.
"Undocumented workers are dif
ficult to organize," said Gould, who
pointed to disputes in Los Angeles
and Houston as examples.
Many believe that this competi
tion is the biggest factor undermin
ing the power of unions.
"The fundamental reason [for the
