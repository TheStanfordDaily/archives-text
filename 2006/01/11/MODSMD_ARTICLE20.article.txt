The Cardinal (1-3) fell to No. 12 Pacific (1-2) in
their final match of the tournament last Saturday.
Stanford kept it close in the first game before the
Tigers squeaked out the 30-27 victory. Stanford was
quick to retaliate in game two, notching a .448 hitting
percentage en route to a 30-28 win.
The Cardinal's attack would be silenced the rest of
the night, however, as Pacific secured the next two
games by margins of 30-14 and 30-16. Stanford senior

LEADING
THE TEAM
Ben Reddy
In each of the Cardi
nal's four matches this
season, senior Ben
Reddy has paced the
team's offense. Thus far,
he's hammering home
a total of 55 kills for the
Stanford squad. Last
year, the Wisconsin na
tive physics major led
the team with 330 kills
while also recording 26
service aces and 135
digs en route to being
named to the MPSF All-
Academic team.

opposite Ben Reddy
led the way with 15
kills, while freshman
setter Miki Groppi col
lected 40 assists and 10
digs for the Cardinal.
Pacific's outside hitter,
Andreas Baboulidis,
led the Tigers' attack
with 21 kills. The loss
placed Stanford last in
the eight-team tourna
ment,
"We have a long
way to go," Reddy said.
"We have a lot of
things we obviously
need to work on, like
defense, blocking and
serving. There were
times this past week
end where we played
well. So hopefully we
can work on those and
make fewer mistakes."
Stanford, the No. 8
seed in the tourna
ment. suffered its first

loss of the season against first-round opponent
UCLA (2-1). Senior setter Jeremy Jacobs collected 20
assists while Reddy notched 19 kills and two service
aces. Outside hitter Sean O'Malley led the way for the
Bruins as UCLA cruised to 30-14,30-24 and 30-22 vic
tories.
The second round of the tournament saw the Car
dinal drop a 0-3 decision to fifth-seeded UC-Irvine (3-
1). The Anteaters made easy work of Stanford with
decisive 30-21. 30-12 and 30-20 margins. In playing
only two games, Reddy led the charge with seven kills.
Associate head coach John Kosty attributed the
Cardinal's tough weekend to a need for improved
passing.
"We need to come in here and pass and serve a lit
tle better to be right up there with our competition,"
said Kosty, who will take over for retiring head coach
Don Shaw at the season's end. "Our offense will get
better as the season progresses, and that improve
ment starts with passing."
The Cardinal opened their season with a 3-0 win
over UC-Santa Cruz on Jan. 4. Stanford hit .327 while
limiting the Banana Slugs to .224.
With five seniors leading a relatively young team.

players such as Reddy find them
selves in challenging role-model po
sitions.
"We all lead in different ways,"
Reddy said. "Jeremy (Jacobs] is a lit
tle more vocal, and [senior middle
blocker Chris] Ahlfeldt is more
silent and leads by example. 1 try to
combine both techniques. We have a
good group of young guys on the
team."
Kosty said that despite early set
backs this past weekend, the UCSB
tournament will provide a solid
foundation for the Cardinal's effort
throughout the season.
"It didn't feel that great last
weekend," Reddy added. "It will
definitely provide motivation, espe
cially for some of the younger guys
who have never played at the col
lege level before.They start to figure
out what it takes to play at this high
of a level."
