# Gymnastics squad shines south of the border
## Cardinal narrowly miss knocking off defending national champ Georgia 
### JUSTINA GRAYMAN 
Thirteen college students, one trip to
Cancun. It had the potential to be fun,
carefree, exciting and wild. While Cancun
is notorious for bringing out the crazy an
tics of college students, it instead brought
out some crazy tricks by the Stanford
women's gymnastics team, who finished
second at the Cancun Gymnastics Classic.
But the mood was certainly not light
hearted or carefree for the Cardinal, who
had been training for one goal: to focus
and compete well.
On Jan. 6, the team opened its season
at the Moon Palace Resort in the Classic
and threw last year's worries behind. In
juries that once plagued almost a third of
the team last season have now faded, and
many who were injured last year compet
ed well.
"Every time 1 have to sit out it's extra
motivating." sophomore LizlVicase said.
Three Stanford gymnasts captured in
dividual event titles at the Cancun Clas
sic, and. ironically, they were the ones sit
ting out meets due to injury last year.

THE REPORT
Cancun Classic 2006
Georgia team score: 195.65 (l s1 place)
Stanford team score: 194.85 (2 place)
3 Number of Stanford gymnasts in top-6 for All-Around Score
Senior Natalie Foley: 3 r " place All-Around (38.975)
Freshman Nicole Ourada: 5 th place All-Around (38.925)
Freshman Kelly Fee: 6 t ' 1 place All-Around (38.725)
3 Events in which a Stanford gymnast won event title
Beam: Senior Natalie Foley, 9.775
Bart: Sophomore Liz Tricase, 9.875
Vault: Senior Glyn Sweets, 9.925

Senior Natalie Foley garnered the bal
ance beam title (9.775); senior Glyn
Sweets gained the vault title and a No. 3
national ranking with a 9.925 and IVic
ase's win in the uneven bars (9.875) was
good enough to earn her a second-place
national ranking.
"Honestly, the quality of gymnastics
has improved immensely," Sweets said. "It
helps so much to have so many people
healthy."
The meet was suspense-packed as
early falls and miscues made leaders
come out from the bunch.The team began

on bars, where head coach Kristen Smyth
said the team has the greatest depth and
artistry. Sophomore Tabitha Yim, sched
uled to compete, was replaced by Sweets,
but two falls hampered the positive flow
of the meet.
Co-captain Foley scored a 9.75 to
achieve Smyth s goal to hit at least five of
six routines.
llie team advanced to beam, where
sophomore Alex Pintchouk replaced Yim
and scored a 9.575. Again, a fall in the sec
ond routine provided a slump, but this did
not appear to affect the routine of fresh-

man Kelly Fee, which earned her a 9.675.
"[Fee] performed as solid as 1 have
ever seen her ." Smyth said.
Other notable performances were by
Tricase, who was seventh (9.8) in vault;
Yim. who placed third with a tremendous
9.9 in floor and Foley, who placed fifth
(9.875) in floor.
With healthy gymnasts now tumbling,
dancing and jumping, the win was up for
grabs. Only the team scores were left to be
tabulated.
Georgia, the top-ranked gymnastics
team in the nation and six-time national
champion, stuck out as the team to beat.
These NCAA warriors could be the meas
uring stick for championship contention,
and Stanford faced them in its first meet.
But the Cardinal placed second with a
score of 194.85 behind Georgia (195.65).
Denver (193.85). Oklahoma (193.325),
and Arizona (192.925) followed.
Georgia dominated the all-around, with
freshman and 2004 Olympian Courtney
Kupets winning (39.225) and sophomore
Katie Heenan placing second. Kupets, who
earned third in floor and second in bars, and
Heenan. who won the floor exercise title
(9.95) and placed fourth in bars, were
strong forces behind the Georgia win.
For the Cardinal. Foley placed third
(38.975) in the all-around competi
tion, freshman Nicole Ourada
earned fifth (38.925) and Fee placed
sixth (38.725).
When asked if there was any
pressure competing against Georgia
in the first meet, Smyth said there
was not.
"The one thing I really want the
team to focus on is their own per
formance," she said. "We are focus
ing this year on performance goals
instead of outcome goals, trying to
control the things we can control,
to finish each meet feeling real
good about our performance and
effort and try and get a little better
every single weekend. And if we
can do that, we can have no re
grets."
Stanford may be on its way to
being one of the top three teams at
this season's end. As of Jan. 3 Stan
ford is ranked third in the nation.

But the mood was certainly not light
hearted or carefree for the Cardinal, who
had been training for one goal: to focus
and compete well.
On Jan. 6, the team opened its season
at the Moon Palace Resort in the Classic
and threw last year's worries behind. In
juries that once plagued almost a third of
the team last season have now faded, and
many who were injured last year compet
ed well.
"Every time 1 have to sit out it's extra
motivating." sophomore LizlVicase said.
Three Stanford gymnasts captured in
dividual event titles at the Cancun Clas
sic, and. ironically, they were the ones sit
ting out meets due to injury last year.

Bart: Sophomore Liz Tricase, 9.875
Vault: Senior Glyn Sweets, 9.925

Senior Natalie Foley garnered the bal
ance beam title (9.775); senior Glyn
Sweets gained the vault title and a No. 3
national ranking with a 9.925 and IVic
ase's win in the uneven bars (9.875) was
good enough to earn her a second-place
national ranking.
"Honestly, the quality of gymnastics
has improved immensely," Sweets said. "It
helps so much to have so many people
healthy."
The meet was suspense-packed as
early falls and miscues made leaders
come out from the bunch.The team began

on bars, where head coach Kristen Smyth
said the team has the greatest depth and
artistry. Sophomore Tabitha Yim, sched
uled to compete, was replaced by Sweets,
but two falls hampered the positive flow
of the meet.
Co-captain Foley scored a 9.75 to
achieve Smyth s goal to hit at least five of
six routines.
llie team advanced to beam, where
sophomore Alex Pintchouk replaced Yim
and scored a 9.575. Again, a fall in the sec
ond routine provided a slump, but this did
not appear to affect the routine of fresh-

man Kelly Fee, which earned her a 9.675.
"[Fee] performed as solid as 1 have
ever seen her ." Smyth said.
Other notable performances were by
Tricase, who was seventh (9.8) in vault;
Yim. who placed third with a tremendous
9.9 in floor and Foley, who placed fifth
(9.875) in floor.
With healthy gymnasts now tumbling,
dancing and jumping, the win was up for
grabs. Only the team scores were left to be
tabulated.
Georgia, the top-ranked gymnastics
team in the nation and six-time national
champion, stuck out as the team to beat.
These NCAA warriors could be the meas
uring stick for championship contention,
and Stanford faced them in its first meet.
But the Cardinal placed second with a
score of 194.85 behind Georgia (195.65).
Denver (193.85). Oklahoma (193.325),
and Arizona (192.925) followed.
Georgia dominated the all-around, with
freshman and 2004 Olympian Courtney
Kupets winning (39.225) and sophomore
Katie Heenan placing second. Kupets, who
earned third in floor and second in bars, and
Heenan. who won the floor exercise title
(9.95) and placed fourth in bars, were
strong forces behind the Georgia win.
For the Cardinal. Foley placed third
(38.975) in the all-around competi
tion, freshman Nicole Ourada
earned fifth (38.925) and Fee placed
sixth (38.725).
When asked if there was any
pressure competing against Georgia
in the first meet, Smyth said there
was not.
"The one thing I really want the
team to focus on is their own per
formance," she said. "We are focus
ing this year on performance goals
instead of outcome goals, trying to
control the things we can control,
to finish each meet feeling real
good about our performance and
effort and try and get a little better
every single weekend. And if we
can do that, we can have no re
grets."
Stanford may be on its way to
being one of the top three teams at
this season's end. As of Jan. 3 Stan
ford is ranked third in the nation.
