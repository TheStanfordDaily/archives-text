# Men's basketball toughing it out
## Nursing a sore lineup back to health, Cardinal battle back to .500 with a pair of weekend victories 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
Despite battling a host of injuries up
and down its roster, the men's basketball
squad (6-6 overall, 2-2 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) looks to have regained its momen
tum after reaching the .S(X) mark with con
secutive wins against Oregon State and
Oregon.
Hie highlight of the Cardinal's rousing
64-62 win over the Ducks on Saturday was
senior Matt Haryasz' 16-point perform
ance. The 6-foot-11 center/forward was
able to make a successful return from a left
ankle sprain suffered a week earlier in the
Cardinal's Dec. 31 loss to Southern Cali
fornia.
The senior, who leads the Cardinal in

both scoring and rebounding, sat out the
squad's 80-66 victory over the Beavers be
fore returning against Oregon two days
later. Still, despite producing an effective
effort, Haryasz said in a press conference
yesterday that he had only been able to
play at 60 percent against the Ducks.
Additionally, the Stanford men have
been without junior forward Fred Wash
ington, who has missed six straight games
due to tendonitis in his left knee. After re
cent meetings with doctors, Washington
elected to undergo surgery that will bring
an early end to his year. Senior guard Dan
Cirunfeld, whose season was cut short last
year by a torn ACL, sat out practice yester
day to give his body a rest. Grunfeld has
started every game this season and is ex
pected to do the same this Friday against
rival California.
Meanwhile, sophomore center Peter
Prowitt has been treated for lower back
spasms and is currently listed as day-to
day. Prowitt filled in for Haryasz against
USC, and with his size will play a key role
during the remainder of Stanford's season.
