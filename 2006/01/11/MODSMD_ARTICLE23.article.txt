## More trouble ahead for younger Vick 
### ELLEN BLITZ THE COLLEGIATE TIMES (VIRGINIA TECH 
(U-WIRE) BLACKSBURG, Va. â€” Former Virginia Tech
quarterback Marcus Vick was arrested in Suffolk, Va. just days
after his dismissal for an altercation in a McDonald's parking lot
on Sunday night.
Vick was charged with three misdemeanor counts of bran
dishing a firearm after turning himself in on Monday. He was re
leased on $10,000 bail.
Brandishing a firearm is a Class 1 misdemeanor punishable by
up to twelve months in jail and a $2,500 fine.
The incident comes two days after his formal announcement
to enter the NFL Draft set for this April and his dismissal from
the Virginia Tech football program.
"I have decided to enter the NFL Draft," Vick said in the
three-paragraph statement released by his lawyers. "Fm very ex
cited about this opportunity and look forward to proving my ath
letic ability at the professional level. I believe I am ready for this
challenge and the next chapter of my life."
The team dismissed Vick permanently on Friday "due to a cu
mulative effect of legal infractions and unsportsmanlike play,"
said university president Charles Steger in a statement.
On Saturday morning, Steger, along with head football coach
Frank Beamer and athletic director Jim Weaver, held a news con
ference to discuss Vick's dismissal.
Steger said when Vick returned to Tech after being dismissed
for the 2004 season it was made clear that there was a one-strike
and you're out rule for off-the-field behavior, which was referred
to as the comprehensive action plan, which Steger said he had vi
olated this season.
Beamer visited Vick and his mother. Brenda Boddie, at their
home Monday and made them aware of the university's decision.
Boddie declined to comment and said Vick was "not talking."
Beamer refused to cite all of the reasons that led to the culmi
nation of events, but said they did include a traffic infringement
Vick received last month. Vick told Beamer on Dec. 19 he had re
ceived a ticket in the Hampton area.
No record of the traffic violation was posted on the Virginia
Court Case Information website until Thursday, and Steger and
Weaver said they did not learn about it until Friday at 2 p.m.
Vick received two citations on Dec. 17. according to the case
information site; one for driving under a revoked or suspended
license and the other for speeding. Both charges are misde
meanors.
Beamer. Weaver and Steger all assured that the decision
made to dismiss Vick from the team was a joint decision and they
all stood behind it.
They said though they just learned about the traffic violations
this week, they had planned on at least a two-game suspension
beforehand. Part of this was due to an incident that occurred at
the Gator Bowl Jan. 2 when Vick stomped on the leg of Louisville
defensive end Elvis Dumervil.
"We were embarrassed and saddened by what happened with
what appeared to be an intentional foul. It is simply unacceptable
to intentionally attempt to harm another player," Steger said.
Beamer said Vick has still not admitted that the incident,
which was not called by the referees, was intentional but did at
tempt to apologize to Dumervil after the game
"I can tell you (Vick) is deeply hurt." Beamer said. "He's
deeply saddened...! can assure you this kid is very, very hurt and
his mom is very, very hurt."
