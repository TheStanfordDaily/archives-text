# COMPUTING
## Hackers obtain student info Compromised identities are few, but concerns remain 
### CLAY BAVINGER 
Just before winter break, several stu
dents received an e-mail from Stanford In
formation Technology Systems and Services
(ITSS), instructing them to change their
SUNet passwords. According to the mes
sage, the University computer systems had
been hacked into, and the hackers had ob
tained several user ID and password combi
nations.
ITSS became aware of the problem dur
ing the beginning of December and prompt
ly alerted the affected students. The e-mail
explained that there had been a security
breech in Cardinal 4, one of five machines
used primarily to display e-mail.The hacker
was able to manipulate the password en
cryption program of Cardinal-!, known as
the secure shell server (SSHD). After this
was done, whenever students logged on to
check their e-mail, the hacker could easily
view the passwords they logged on with.
Many Stanford students, who admit they
take the security of the University comput
er system for granted, said the fact that it is
not completely hacker-proof is frightening.
"1 guess I always assumed that Stan
ford's computers were safe and secure." said
freshman Alex Laube. "Now that 1 know
they're not; 1 feel nervous about having so

much private in
formation on my
SUNet account."

Though only a
few students' identi
ties were compromised

in this specific case, it serves as
a warning to all students
that the consequences of
identity theft can be devas
tating.
If someone gains access
to a student's online identi
ty, he can "send spam, dis
tribute illegal things,send e
mails that look as though
the student sent them and
gain access to personal in
formation," said Rich Hole
ton. head of Residential
Computing.

Niran Babalola, the Otero resi
dent computer coordinator, verified all of
these dangers, though he said that theft of a
SI 'Net 11) is not c|uite as serious as the theft
of online banking identities.
I lowever, according to Babalola, there is
a great deal of private information in Stan
lord's accounts, and students should take
reasonable measures to ensure their security.
l ips from Babalola included the follow
ing: choose passwords with random symbols,
essentially anything not normal or logical:
change passwords regularly, which can be
done at stanfordyou.stanford.edu; and be

wary of computers
which you type your password into. Stanford
computers are safe, but any public comput
ers may be infected with viruses which
record username and password combina
tions.
According to Holeton, online security is
an issue of utmost importance to the Uni
versity. and many services such as ITSS and

Residential Computing work to keep the
computer systems secure. In addition, each
on-campus residential house is staffed with
an RCC who helps students with all com
puter-related issues, such as printing and in
ternet connection, and also advises students
on how to keep their computers free of
viruses.
