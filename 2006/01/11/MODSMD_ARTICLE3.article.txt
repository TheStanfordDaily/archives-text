## Lawsuit targets football Recruit trips included strip clubs, alcohol suit alleges 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
According to a lawsuit filed by former
Stanford employee Sheryl Kanzaki, mem
bers of the Stanford football squad took
recruits to a San Francisco strip club in
2003.
In the lawsuit. Kanzaki, a former ac
counting assistant with the athletic de
partment, states that in May 2(K)3, players
submitted receipts for reimbursements
which included alcohol purchases as well
as expenditures at New Century Theater
in San Francisco.
While the event was not an NCAA vi

olation in 2003, it is now against NCAA
rules and regulations prohibiting hosts to
spend money provided by the athletic
department on strip clubs, drugs or alco
hol.
This was the first time the University
knew of the incident, while minor infrac
tions do occur from time to time, said
Stanford counsel Patrick Dunkley.
When asked if such practices were
common before 2003, Dunkley said "not
as far as taking the recruits out."
According to comments given to the
San Jose Mercury news, Stanford report
ed the incident to the NCAA because of
an accounting mistake. Because players
had spent more than the allotted $30 for
entertaining recruits, the minor violation
was reported.
"The only thing that was an
NCAA violation was a $30 limit
that can be spent on recruitment
and the University voluntarily re
ported that,"
In addition, the receipts were
handwritten, and the accounting of
fice's associate athletic director
Debra Gore-Mann and accounting
manager Susana Ching are thought
to have switched those receipts fora

lost receipt form.
The actions were a violation of
the department's policy and Kanzaki
believes the handwritten receipts
were replaced by lost-receipt forms
to cover up the visit to the strip club
and the purchase of alcohol during a
recruit visit.
Kanzaki has also singled out sen
ior Gore-Mann for mistreatment in
the lawsuit. The lawsuit states that in
July 2001 "Gore-Mann began a pat
tern and practice of promulgating a
culture of intolerance and retalia
tion" concerning employee leave.
Gore Mann is also accused of creat
ing positions for friends during a Uni

versity-wide hiring freeze in 2003.
In the past two years, Stanford
has not had any serious NCAA vio
lations. The accusation threatens to
mar Stanford's reputation as an ex
emplary school for intercollegiate
athletics, both on and off the field.
Dunkley said the University has
taken all appropriate measures in re
sponse to the incident.
"One reason why it's receiving at
tention now is because of the lawsuit
by Ms. Kanzaki," he said. "The Uni
versity took action and designed it
from happening again."
