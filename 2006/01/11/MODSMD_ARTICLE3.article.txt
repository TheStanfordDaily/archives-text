## Lawsuit targets football Recruit trips included strip clubs, alcohol suit alleges 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
According to a lawsuit filed by former
Stanford employee Sheryl Kanzaki, mem
bers of the Stanford football squad took
recruits to a San Francisco strip club in
2003.
In the lawsuit. Kanzaki, a former ac
counting assistant with the athletic de
partment, states that in May 2(K)3, players
submitted receipts for reimbursements
which included alcohol purchases as well
as expenditures at New Century Theater
in San Francisco.
While the event was not an NCAA vi

olation in 2003, it is now against NCAA
rules and regulations prohibiting hosts to
spend money provided by the athletic
department on strip clubs, drugs or alco
hol.
This was the first time the University
knew of the incident, while minor infrac
tions do occur from time to time, said
Stanford counsel Patrick Dunkley.
When asked if such practices were
common before 2003, Dunkley said "not
as far as taking the recruits out."
According to comments given to the
San Jose Mercury news, Stanford report
ed the incident to the NCAA because of
an accounting mistake. Because players
had spent more than the allotted $30 for
entertaining recruits, the minor violation
was reported.
