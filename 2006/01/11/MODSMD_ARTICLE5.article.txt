# LAW SCHOOL
## Roberts Court likely to uphold Solomon Amend. 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on Dec. 6
tackling whether law schools must allow military recruiters
the same access as other potential employers in light of the
military's discrimination of openly gay students. During
the hearings — which came on the heels of Stanford
protests following military recruitment at the Law School
on Oct. 3,2(X)5 — the court appeared likely to uphold the
Solomon Amendment, a law that effectively forces univer
sities to allow military recruiters access or risk the loss of
federal funding.
"Sadly it seems the Supreme Court is sympathetic to
the military recruiters and will likely allow them further ac
cess to students who are in college," said junior Stephen
Funk, a gay student who reached the rank of Lance Corpo
ral while serving in the Marines."l feel if the justices rule in
this direction it indicates disregard for any university's
right to freedom of speech and sense of equality and fair-

ness. It's sad that the courts look likely to
defend the military's right to exclude and
mistreat, and feels that is more important
than a university's First Amendment
rights."
In the case, Rumsfeld vs. Forum for
Academic and Institutional Rights
(FAIR), the justices raised issue with the
claim that allowing military recruiters
onto campus represented compelled
speech, advanced by the American Asso
ciation of Law Schools' lawyer, E. Joshua
Rosenkranz. Both Solicitor General
Paul D. Clement, the military's lawyer,
and several justices suggested signs, dis
claimers on advertisements and even
University-organized protests as means
of separation.
"It seems to me quite a simple matter
for the law schools to have a disclaimer
on all of their e-mails and advertise
ments that say the law school does not
approve, and in fact, disapproves of the
policies of some of the employers who
you will meet," said Justice Anthony
Kennedy during the hearings."That's the
end of it."
Indeed, the court seemed to believe
that a law school could distance itself
from the military's message rather easily.
"Nobody thinks that this law school is

speaking through those employers who
come onto its campus for recruitment,"
Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. said. "No
body thinks the law school believes
everything that the employers are doing
or saying."
However, Law Prof. Larry Kramer,
dean of Stanford Law School, asserted
the justices fundamentally misinterpret
ed the right to be free from compelled
speech.
"The ability to distance yourself from
forced speech has nothing to do with the
right and never has," Kramer said. "If the
government passed a law saying The
Stanford Daily must publish an editorial
praising the Bush administration, the
fact that the Daily could add articles and
textboxes all around it saying 'the gov
ernment made us do it' doesn't make the
law any less illegal. The possibility of si
multaneous speech doesn't make it any
less a violation of the First Amendment
than making us do it in the first place."
The justices also suggested that law
school administrations have the legal im
perative to reject government money if
they believed it immoral to support a dis
criminatory policy. A law school that ac
cepted money while opposing the mili
tary recruiters' presence gave the ap
pearance of hypocrisy, a point Roberts
implied in his comments to Rosenkranz.
"What you're saying is this is a mes
sage we believe in strongly, but we don't
believe in it to the detriment of $ 1(X) mil
lion."he said.

However, Kramer stated that the Law
School already takes no federal money,
so to penalize other areas of the Univer
sity to force the Law School's hand
amounts to a secondary boycott, which is
illegal in nearly any other context.
"They're going to make the Med
School, the Engineering School, every
other part of the University give up
money," Kramer said. "It's just a way of
getting the Engineering School, the Med
School to say 'Law School, you have to
let them recruit.'The money they're ask
ing other parts of the University to give
up has nothing to do with military re
cruiters."
However, justices questioned
whether precluding the military from re
cruiting would violate its right to free
speech.
"Why you don't have here what I'd
say is normal in the First Amendment
area, that the remedy for speech you
don't like is not less speech, it is more
speech," Justice Stephen Breyer said.
In light of an expected ruling in favor
of the military recruiters, perhaps the ac
tivists will have no choice but to take
Breyer's comments as advice.
"[lf the Court were to rule in the re
cruiters' favor] we'd be back to where we
were before protests — trying to get
Congress to change a patently bad law,"
Kramer said.
Experts expect the Court to an
nounce a decision in the first half of 2(X)6.
