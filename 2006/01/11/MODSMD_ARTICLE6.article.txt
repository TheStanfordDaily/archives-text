### CHRISTIAN TORRES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
University President John I lennessv lis
tened to student concerns including faculty
and student diversity, financial aid and
alumni interaction at a joint-ASSU/GSC
Senate meeting last night.
"Tonight's purpose was more educa
tional than formal decision-making." said
ASSU Senate Deputy Chair Danny Arheit
er,a sophomore."lt was for President Hen
nessy to understand where the student
body is coming from and for the student
body to understand where the president is
coming from."
Arbeiter described the night as a spring
board for future discussion and decisions.
Many issues were brought to Hennessy's
attention so that the Senate and students in
general could later iron out solutions.
Among the main topics was ethnic diver
sity, specifically in the graduate student body
and faculty. Hennessy responded to con
cerns by saying that hopefully in the future
programs could encourage more minority
applicants. But. he also implored students to
act as ambassadors to those who could add
to the University's diversity.
"We also need to be more encouraging

of students to pursue an academic career,"
he said.
Diversity of geographic background was
also considered, with students pointing out
the large student majority from California.
"West of the Mississippi, Stanford is the
place to go, but east of it is different," Hen
nessy said.
The president cited a decrease in enroll
ment by east-coast students following the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But the numbers
are increasing again, he said, with a high
number of east-coasters showing high inter
est through Admit Weekend attendance.
Again, I lennessy encouraged students to be
ambassadors, sharing their positive experi
ences with east-coast counterparts to stimu
late more accepted students to enroll.
Students also raised concern for the trans
portation problem and financial difficulty in
ternational students sometimes face. With
the Campaign for Undergraduate Education
successfully finishing with $1.1 billion total,
1 lennessy said he hopes to see a large part of
the fund used to increase financial aid and
eventually offer need-blind admission for in
ternational students.
Other international students in atten
dance raised complaints over language
barriers and a lack of winter-break accom
modations. Hennessy said he plans to look
into such student-suggested solutions as

English language classes and hous
ing with alumni over the break,
both offered at Ivy League univer
sities.
Connecting with alumni was an
other key issue brought up at the
meeting. Hennessy pointed out the
positive response of alumni to the
Campaign for Undergraduate [Edu
cation, and said he hopes that the
alumni interest in and involvement

with the University continues.
"11 we can repeat what we did to
get the alumni enthusiastic about
improving the undergraduate expe
rience. I think we'll be successful,"
he said.
Networking with alumni is also
critical to student mentoring, re
cruitment and Stanford's worldwide
visibility, all of which I lennessy said
he would like to sec grow.
Among other issues discussed
last night with Hennessy were ex
tension of Green Library hours on
weekends, expansion of student en
vironmental awareness programs
and student group funding.
