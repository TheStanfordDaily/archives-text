# STUDENT LIFE
## Facebook: not just for stalking Web site a valuable asset for student journalists 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Camille Ricketts' second story as
signment for the Stanford Daily as a
lowly freshman writer in 2(X)2 was to
write about students finding it difficult
to complete multiple majors. "It was al
most impossible," recalls Ricketts. now a
senior and the Editor in Chief of the
Daily. "I was a freshman and knew hard
ly any upperclassmen."
Today Ricketts might have found her
article much easier to research, thanks
largely in part to the wildly-popular
Facebook.com.
"Facebook would have saved me so
much trouble on that story." Ricketts
said."l could have just looked up people
with multiple majors to speak to."
Facebook — started in February
2(X)4 by Harvard dropout Mark Zucker
berg — is a staple on college students'
Web browsers across the country, boast
ing more than four million users at over
2,(XH) institutions. Facebook now cm
ploys a gaggle of Stanford students and
is based in Palo Alto.
While many agree that Facebook has
shaken the college social scene with its
übiquitous popularity, those on the staff
of college newspapers can also appreci
ate how the Web site has revolutionized
the world of college journalism.
"Facebook.com helps us get things
right." added sophomore Sal Umberto
Bonaccorso, a news desk editor for The
Daily. "And make sure they're right."
Duke freshman Josh Chapin, a staff
writer for the Duke Chronicle, said he
uses Facebook "at least once an arti
cle."
Bonaccorso also called the Face
book, "an amazing resource for re
porters" because of its ease in sorting
students based on their interests and
finding sources for specific topics.
"I wrote an article about the return of
Lobster Night, an old tradition," said
Harvard sophomore Sam Teller."l went
to the Facebook group 'Harvard Coali
tion for the Return of Lobster Night'
and was able to see the number of mem
bers."
Facebook not only saves time for
fact-gathering but also for editing and
fact-checking. For example, most col
lege papers cite information on a quot
ed student. Like manv others, the
Daily provides each quoted student's year at
Stanford.
"Before Facebook," explains Ricketts."We'd al
ways have a murderous time accounting for every
one's class or year."
Added Bonaccorso, "The advantage of Face
book is that it allows editors to fact-check articles
with ease." Bonaccorso explained a task such as ver
ifying the spelling of a name or double-checking a
dubious quotation, "can simply be looked up on
Facebook."
The Georgetown Hoya supplies what year and
which of Georgetown's schools quoted students are
from, according to freshman Meg Charlton, guide
editor for The Hoya. Charlton recalled having quot
ed a girl without knowing her school or year and in
stead of,"being creepy and calling or e-mailing her,"
Charlton was able to find her information on the
Facebook.
On their individual profiles, students can list any
thing from their year and major to favorite movie or
quotes.The Facebook generally allows users to view
the profiles of any student at the same school. As
The Harvard Crimson's Facebook beat reporter.
Teller observed,"Students invest a lot in their Face
book (profiles] so it can be very useful."
The more information students provide, the
more helpful it can be for college student journal
ists.
University of Virginia freshman Maria
McLemore, a staff writer for The Cavalier Daily re
ported using the Facebook, "a lot. for contact infor

mation: phone numbers and instant messenger
screennames,"
College reporters often find Facebook a first re
source, with vast amounts of information and the
useful ability to sort students based on a variety of
criteria.
"What is nice about Facebook," added Chapin.
"is that it provides the unbelievable ability to find
anybody at a school."
Ricketts added, "There are countless examples
where the easiest thing to do is just log on to Face
book and search fora narrow slice of the student
body that fits an article's needs."
In many ways, the Facebook is another example
of technology making life a little easier. Chapin
likens Facebook to instant messaging: "Do we need
it? No. But is it convenient? Yes."
But some concern exists that tools like Facebook
may lead to laziness on the part of reporters.
" I think it has gotten to the point where it is over
used." Teller said. "It maybe has become a not
meaningful substitute for reporting. It is tempting to
stop right there. Facebook is much better used as a
launching pad for other reporting than as an end it
self."
Others maintain that the Facebook is depend
able and rich with information.
"How else are you going to contact someone you
don't know so quickly besides with
Facebook.com?" McLemore explained. "We have a
saying: college journalism must have been nonexist
ent before Facebook."
