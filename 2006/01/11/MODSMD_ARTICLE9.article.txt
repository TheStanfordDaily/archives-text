# Jobs unveils new line of Apples
## Transition to Intel microprocessors was expected to take years 
### MAY WONG ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple Computer Inc.'s
historic shift to Intel Corp. microprocessors came
months earlier than expected lliesday as CEO Steve
Jobs unveiled desktop and notebook computers based
on new two-brained chips from the world's largest semi
conductor company's.
The first Macs to deploy Intel's Core Duo processors
will be the latest iMac desktop, whose circuitry is all built
into the display, and the Macßook Pro laptop.
When it announced the switch in June, Apple said it
expected to begin making the transition by mid-2006.
On Tuesday. Apple chief executive Steve Jobs was
joined at the Macworld expo by Intel CEO Paul Otelli
ni to unveil the new jointly designed computers.
Otellini came onstage wearing a clean room suit that
the chip company has famously used in its ad campaigns
_ and that Apple once lampooned in its ads of its own.
For years. Apple shunned Intel, which has provided
chips that power a majority of the world's PCs, along
with Windows software from Microsoft Corp.
In the late 19905, Apple even ran TV ads with a Pen
tium II glued to a snail and others with a toasted clean
room suit.
But Apple, looking for faster, more energy-efficient
chips, became increasingly frustrated in recent years as
its chip suppliers. IBM Corp. and Motorola Corp.'s spin
off, Freescale Semiconductor Inc., failed to meet its
needs.
Of particular concern was IBM's apparent inability
to develop a G5 chip that would work well in notebook
computers.
Intel, on the other hand, has been focusing on devel
oping chips specifically tailored for notebooks. In 2003,
it launched its Centrino notebook technology with a
processor that boosted a longer battery life by minimiz
ing its power demand without a major hit to perform
ance.
During last week's International Consumer Elec
tronics Show. Intel unveiled the latest generation, the
Core Duo. which features two computing engines on a
single piece of silicon.
