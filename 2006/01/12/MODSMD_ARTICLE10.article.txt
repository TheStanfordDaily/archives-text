# Fraudulent researcher asks for forgiveness
## Stem-cell advancements found to be fake

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A disgraced South
Korean researcher asked his nation's pardon Thursday
for fraudulent claims of stem cell breakthroughs, hut
said junior scientists deceived him and should share
blame for the scandal.
"I ask for your forgiveness," Hwang Woo-suk told a
nationally televised press conference from Seoul in his
first public appearance in nearly three weeks. "I feel so
miserable that it's difficult even to say sorry."
Seoul National University, where Hwang is a profes
sor, on Thesday issued a final report that he fabricated
landmark published claims in 2(X)4 and 2(H)5 to have
cloned a human embryo and extracted stem cells from it.
"The use of fake data...is what I have to take full re
sponsibility for as first author. I acknowledge all of that
and apologize once again," Hwang said.
However, Hwang repeated his earlier claims that he
was deceived about the data by two junior scientists at a
partner research hospital, and said that he believed that
his papers were legitimate when they were published.
He said the junior researchers lied to him when they
said they successfully culled and grew stem cells from
human embryos cloned by Hwang's team.
Hwang also claims that some of his stem cells were
maliciously switched by other researchers in his lab. He
stressed again Thursday that this "is a matter that should
definitely be cleared up."
Hwang, who at one point was on the verge of tears,
also claimed that he has the technology to create pa
tient-specific stem cells under the right conditions.
"I think we can create patient-specific stem cells in
six months if eggs are sufficiently provided," he said.
Scientists hope one day to use such technology to
treat afflictions including Alzheimer's disease by allow
ing patients to grow replacement tissue using their own
stem cells.
Wearing a suit and tie and speaking in a subdued
manner, Hwang was surrounded by about two dozen
current and former students.
The government has said it would launch an audit of
national funds provided for Hwang's research. Prosecu
tors also raided Hwang's home in southern Seoul earli
er Thursday, seizing evidence related to their investiga
tion into the stem cell fraud, prosecution official Kim
Hang-soo said.
