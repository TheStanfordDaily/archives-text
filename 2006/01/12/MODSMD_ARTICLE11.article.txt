f:» tist Dennis Grahn have devel
oped a gadget called CoreCon
tr°l could improve the per
formance of the struggling Car
dinal football team. By cooling the body in
ternally, Core Control re-energizes people
so they can work harder and longer.
In a New York Times article published
Dec. 13, Core Control is described as a sim
ple. hand-held device that works by using
negative pressure to redistribute the blood
flow to vessels in the palm of the hand — an
area where heat loss occurs most frequently.
Since the veins and arteries in our palms are
able to carry large amounts of blood, this is
an area where Core Control can prompt
more rapid heat exchange by allowing
steady blood flow.
"The performance enhancement discov
ery came as a result of pulling heat from
people who exercise," Heller explains. "We
realized that we can eliminate exhaustion
from people, so instead of someone fatigu
ing, they just keep on going."
Grahn elaborates on the product's func
tion, explaining how Core Control allows
"direct access to circulating blood in [the]
body."
"We maintain pretty constant internal
temperatures, and we produce heat as a
byproduct of cell metabolism." Grahn says.
"The body is always generating heat, but the
external environment is also a factor. It can
be really hot or really cold, so what our sys
tem does is it has clever ways to protect
against the external environment through
insulation. By cooling the circulation fluid
(the blood) of the body, you pull out excess
heat and you prevent the temperature sensi
tive systems that are most likely to fail from
failing."

ntrol was the need to re-warm patients in the

recovery room.
"It would normally take nurses two to
three hours to make patients stop shiver
ing." Heller says. "Grahn got the idea from a
meeting he went to at NASA in which they
were using negative pressure to redistribute
blood flow. We then used negative pressure
to pull blood into the arm and we heated the
arm and found that we could re-warm pa
tients in two to three minutes instead of two
to three hours."
Through the same process, the professors
found that they could rapidly extract heat
from people as well. They discovered that
for areas like the palms of the hands, soles of
the feet and the face — places where heat
loss occurs recurrently — heat extraction

would be crucial in allowing a person to con
tinue regular body function.
Heller says that they are also continuing
to develop and improve the product so that
it can be accessible to military and emer
gency personnel.
"Heat casualties are one of the biggest
problems in Iraq," Heller says. " Ilie ambient
temperature is 104 degrees and soldiers
have to ride in highly armored vehicles that
do not have air conditioning while wearing
body armor and other protective gear. We're
working on devices that'll make it possible
for them to dissipate heat to recover from
periods of activity and high temperatures
more rapidly."
Heller adds that he and Grahn are also
exploring other ways in which Core Control
can be used in medicine.
"Right now we're working with multiple
sclerosis patients who are extremely tem
perature sensitive," Heller says."In high
temperatures, they lose the ability to func
tion. As the temperature goes up, they can
no longer walk or use their limbs. By en
abling them to extract heat, [patients] can
function."
Grahn adds that while they "can't cure
[multiple sclerosis], we can provide a way of
reducing the symptoms of heat sensitive
components."
According to the New York Times article,
another advantage to Core Control is that,
unlike traditional methods of cooling the
body, such as sticking one's hand into a
bucket of ice water, Core Control enlarges
the blood vessels to help prevent vacocon
striction — a phenomenon that causes the
body to think that it needs to retain heat
when exposed to extreme cold.
This advantage would permit Core Co
ntrol's rapid cooling to rejuvenate a tired and
overheated body, Grahn says. With the help
of Core Control, "athletes [will be able to]
run faster and jump higher."
