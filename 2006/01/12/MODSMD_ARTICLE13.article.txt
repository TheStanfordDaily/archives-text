# Stanford Garb Pacifies Enraged Motorist: Buy Your Sweatshirts Now

It almost feels like I never left for break,
except for the fact that several friends
have graduated and moved on to bigger
and bolder things (good luck in Roatan,
Jenn!). The Lag freshmen are in full, misbe
having swing, I already have more Spanish
reading assigned for tomorrow than I could
realistically do in a week and the post office
has misplaced my mail somewhere between
here. San Diego and the Upper East Side in
New York City. But before I completely
knock the Farm, I will tell you how it saved
me from being utterly humiliated on New
Year's Day.
I opened 2006 by wrecking my dad's Prius
on 101 Sin Los Angeles. I know, it's pathetic
— it rains in LA for one day and I crash the
car. What can I say, that some people (me)

just need to live in perpetual sunshine?
It was actually pretty frightening. I've
been in my fair share of car accidents but
never in a high-speed collision. The impact
knocked me almost senseless. And there
was no shoulder on the freeway, so we
pulled onto the embankment where I was
fairly sure a car was going to hit me going
75mph, instantly making the insurance mat

ter irrelevant.
The other woman — the one I rear-ended
on the freeway — was young and looked
very chic in her Gucci sunglasses, tight skirt
and 2004 Lexus. I imagined that she was
some movie studio executive who was on a
first name basis with Katherine Moennig. I,
on the other hand, was grungy from a night in
a very seedy karaoke bar and still felt sick
from the cheap champagne. I felt so pathetic
as I asked her which Lexus model she was
driving in order to report it to my insurance
(there were two on her insurance docu
ments). But — my one saving grace — I was
wearing a Stanford sweatshirt.
You may think it doesn't mean anything,
but it does. I believe in the power of the Stan
ford reputation to help me gain admissions.

get jobs and to get me out of trouble. And
this is a perfect example. This is why my par
ents invest $40,000 a year in my Stanford ed
ucation.
She got out of her car and I could tell by
the look on her face that she was going to rip
me a new one. I zipped up my sweatshirt to
make sure STANFORD was as visible as
possible and cradled my collarbone, partly
out of pain and partly to solicit pity As she
approached, she saw my anguish and took
pity on me. She asked if I was okay, and I al
most hugged her. The fact that I was wearing
a Stanford sweatshirt and looked like shit
definitely helped my cause.
Then I called my parents, figuring I'd give
them two hours to get over the materialistic
shock that I had ruined their environmental

ly friendly new toy while I drove back down
to San Diego. Indeed, this was the wrong ap
proach; it turns out that spontaneity is often
best.
My dad was absolutely livid. Why wasn't I
driving my car!? Well, my car was back at
Stanford being pelted by rainstorms, sorry.
Why was I such a goddamn bad driver? Well,
you taught me how to drive, dad. sorry again.
Why am I such a smart ass? I couldn't answer
that one. In an instant I was relegated to inse
cure, angsty teenager all over again. Stanford
education or not, 22-years-old or not, apolo
getic or not. I was irresponsible, a bad driver
and in big trouble.

Can yon teach me how to drive"? E-mail
