## Editorial Students need housing options during break 
### 
While many Stanford students spend
the winter holidays with their fam
ilies, a number of international stu
dents are forced to stay on campus over the
three-week break.
For many, flying home for the holidays is
an expensive option. A return trip home
could cost more than $I.(KM). When faced
with the prohibitive cost of buying a plane
ticket during the festive season, several in
ternational students make do with alterna
tive housing arrangements on the Farm.
While it is unclear exactly how many such
students stay on campus during residences'
winter closures, it is certain that these stu
dents face numerous difficulties in coping
with limited access to housing, food and
transportation.
Currently, international students com
prise approximately 5 percent of the under
graduate population and about 30 percent
of the graduate population. International
graduate students can remain in their resi
dences, which remain open in spite of win
ter closure, during the break. However, in
ternational undergraduates have to find al
ternate housing arrangements when their
dorms close at noon the day after finals
week ends.
Chi Theta Chi, Sigma Chi and Ham
marskjold are the only three undergraduate
residences that remain open over winter
break. Of these three dorms. Hammarskjold
offers makeshift housing arrangements to
international students at a fee. But this offer
ing is disingenuous: International students
who stay in Hammarskjold do not sleep in
the rooms, but on mattresses in the lounge.
In addition to paying a fee based on the
length of stay, residents are also required to
perform chores for the duration of their stay.
Finding food is also a challenge for many
who stay on campus over winter break. The
dining halls and other University-operated

dining facilities are closed for the entirety of
the holidays.
Making their way off-campus for food —
or for any other reason — is also difficult, as
most Marguerite services are suspended
during winter break. Getting around is diffi
cult without a car, which very few interna
tional students have at Stanford.
Alternative housing arrangements for in
ternational students are woefully inade
quate. An information sheet circulated by
Residential and Dining Enterprises casually
offers a few suggestions, such as staying in a
friend's off-campus apartment or spending
the break with a friend's family The list ends
by encouraging affected students to "be cre
ative."
But it is especially hard for incoming
freshmen to be creative in finding alterna
tive housing over winter break. Having
spent a mere three months in college, inter
national freshmen are unlikely to know stu
dents with off-campus housing and may be
unable to find friends willing to host them
for close to a month.
In contrast, the University did an out
standing job in providing support for stu
dents who stayed on-campus over Thanks
giving break. All dorms stayed open, and suf
ficient dining options and tutoring resources
were made available.
Admittedly, there appears to be little ur
gency for change. Without need-blind admis
sions for international students. Stanford
takes finances into account when offering
spots to these students. Consequently, many
international students at Stanford are dis
proportionately wealthy and can easily af
ford to pay for alternative arrangements
over winter break.
The University clearly has the resources
to provide better housing options for inter
national students during the holidays; what it
lacks is the will to do so.
