# What Stanfordites want
## 
### 
Nothing is more revealing about a per
son than what he or she wants. And
nothing tells you more about what
people really want than that anonymous In
ternet bazaar Craigslist.
Returning after break. Stanford feels so
familiar. The same incessant beeping of
trucks from the übiquitous construction
sites, the same classes offered this quarter for
students taking them off track. We recognize
faces from across White Plaza, only this time
with less hair, whiter teeth, and cleaner
clothes.The same people, but still their hair
cuts and new clothes make them seem a little
foreign.
Maybe we don't know these people so
well. They might surprise us, as we discov
ered with a little research on Craigslist. We,
your loyal columnists, would like to bring
you insight into what's really going on be
hind those new haircuts and old faces.
Search for the keyword "Stanford" in
Craigslist's text-based nexus of human de
sire and you'll find more jobs in human re
sources at Google than you could count with
a super-computer.
You'll find a Palo Alto father and son
looking fora third in their first threesome.
Stanford students selling or in the market
for gems, junk, rare books, second-hand fu
tons and ass. But more than anything, you'll
find people who still seem to believe that if
they can just say what they want, they'll still
get it. Here is a compilation of verbatim ex
tracts. All mention Stanford, so we offer
them as portraits of your community.
• The disillusioned world-changer looking
for fulfillment in a life far away:
Stanford-educated male seeks female
partner to herd yaks w/ in Tibet. Roughly
one year removed from college I find myself
wanting to escape Silicon Valley and live the
minimalist life somewhere — preferably
somewhere we can herd yaks together. Pref
erence goes to females who already come
with yaks. Here's the deal. Maybe I've come
to the conclusion that this type of life is so
generic. I try to eschew cliches in my life, and
I'm definitely out of step with most peers.
• The sensitive artist:
It does not have to entail anything physi
cal as long as I can get to have a relationship
with you, to understand your mind, dreams,
fears and heart. I have been longing to find
someone I can paint, and paid models are
too banal and dry for me to paint. I am open
to dating but only for my artistic purpose.
• The mistress seeker
...any female Stanford students in need of
financial assistance? I am a clean.discrete and
generous gentleman who would like to help.
Undergrad or graduate student, it doesn't
matter, but please be attractive, reasonably fit
and know how to give a good massage.

• The opinionated intellectual dripping en
titlement:
What am I looking for? Am I looking for
a girl to make my life complete? No. that's
too annoying for me. Do I need a "cute and
petite"girl that agrees with everything I say?
Please, don't make me kill you. I'm an
egghead and a snob (of a benign sort — I just
do not care for stupidity or lack of intellectu
al honesty, and if people have bad grammar
or spelling I tend to look down on them,
whether or not I should. I'd go anywhere to
meet the right woman. I deserve the best
wife money can't buy.
• The guy with the naive ambitions:
What I'm looking for is someone who
wants to experience something new — RE
ALLY new — I want to LIVE in southern
France, I want to end up in Utah and then
hang out with some Mormons. I want to
compete in a triathlon in South America. I
want to adopt a little Russian kid. I want to
work as a fisherman in the Caribbean and
then create a national magazine. 1 want to go
to Antarctica to perform science experi
ments. And I want someone who could real
ly give a shit what I really want.
• The Modern Thought and Literature
major:
I have degrees in English and Philosophy
from Cal and Stanford. Currently, I work the
reference desk at the Redwood City Public
Library.
• And this guy:
I really just want to know if it is legal to
shoot wild raccoons with a BB gun. You see.
these fearless little bastards keep invading
my front porch, and I swear to God they're
biding their time to ambush me. I'm thinking
about buying one of those little spring
loaded Marksman Repeaters and givin'
them a few welts on their striped asses... but
is that illegal? I helped you out. now you help
me.Thanks for reading. Peace.
Stanford may consist of love-starved,
over-qualified, neurotic, unemployed and
unfulfilled people. But don't take this as a
bad omen. It just means we know what we
want.

No, seriously, if you 're the yak guy, we want to
go with you. E-mail us at yakkidd@gniail.com.
We'll he waiting.

wanting to escape Silicon Valley and live the
minimalist life somewhere — preferably
somewhere we can herd yaks together. Pref
erence goes to females who already come
with yaks. Here's the deal. Maybe I've come
to the conclusion that this type of life is so
generic. I try to eschew cliches in my life, and
I'm definitely out of step with most peers.
• The sensitive artist:
It does not have to entail anything physi
cal as long as I can get to have a relationship
with you, to understand your mind, dreams,
fears and heart. I have been longing to find
someone I can paint, and paid models are
too banal and dry for me to paint. I am open
to dating but only for my artistic purpose.
• The mistress seeker
...any female Stanford students in need of
financial assistance? I am a clean.discrete and
generous gentleman who would like to help.
Undergrad or graduate student, it doesn't
matter, but please be attractive, reasonably fit
and know how to give a good massage.

• The opinionated intellectual dripping en
titlement:
What am I looking for? Am I looking for
a girl to make my life complete? No. that's
too annoying for me. Do I need a "cute and
petite"girl that agrees with everything I say?
Please, don't make me kill you. I'm an
egghead and a snob (of a benign sort — I just
do not care for stupidity or lack of intellectu
al honesty, and if people have bad grammar
or spelling I tend to look down on them,
whether or not I should. I'd go anywhere to
meet the right woman. I deserve the best
wife money can't buy.
• The guy with the naive ambitions:
What I'm looking for is someone who
wants to experience something new — RE
ALLY new — I want to LIVE in southern
France, I want to end up in Utah and then
hang out with some Mormons. I want to
compete in a triathlon in South America. I
want to adopt a little Russian kid. I want to
work as a fisherman in the Caribbean and
then create a national magazine. 1 want to go
to Antarctica to perform science experi
ments. And I want someone who could real
ly give a shit what I really want.
• The Modern Thought and Literature
major:
I have degrees in English and Philosophy
from Cal and Stanford. Currently, I work the
reference desk at the Redwood City Public
Library.
• And this guy:
I really just want to know if it is legal to
shoot wild raccoons with a BB gun. You see.
these fearless little bastards keep invading
my front porch, and I swear to God they're
biding their time to ambush me. I'm thinking
about buying one of those little spring
loaded Marksman Repeaters and givin'
them a few welts on their striped asses... but
is that illegal? I helped you out. now you help
me.Thanks for reading. Peace.
Stanford may consist of love-starved,
over-qualified, neurotic, unemployed and
unfulfilled people. But don't take this as a
bad omen. It just means we know what we
want.

No, seriously, if you 're the yak guy, we want to
go with you. E-mail us at yakkidd@gniail.com.
We'll he waiting.
