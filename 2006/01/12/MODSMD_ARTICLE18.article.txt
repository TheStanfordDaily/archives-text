# Why writing scares me
## 
### 
Writing always scares me. Some
times, 1 stare at a blank Word docu
ment on my screen and watch the
cursor blink and blink and blink... All 1 can
and all 1 want to write is"! am scared." In dif
ferent forms, in different flavors — 1 am
scared
Sometimes I try different fonts for kicks,
and I might slightly change the wording —
"I'm scared" as opposed to "/ am scared." 1
may try different tenses. "I was being
scared." I may try different pronouns. "He
has been scared." "We are scared."
I may even interject other sentences be
tween the various forms of "I am scared" to
give some semblance of content to the un
aware reader.
But, this is not a crash course in overcom
ing writing phobia. Naturally, a claustrophobe
can't teach you how to use an elevator.
Ibis is my attempt to figure out how to
live on an idle Monday morning.
My struggle begins when I wake up with
the painful admission that 1 don't know how
to live — and I don't mean survival. By now.
I have become an expert in survival. My
worry is that I do not want anything, nor do I
know how to want something. "This is just
another problem. If 1 can ask it the right way,
frame it with the right terminology, 1 can find
an answer."
My abstract intellectualizations of life's
vibrant problems have rarely paid off, but I
try to keep my spirits up.
Then 1 get out of bed, with a headache
eating into my brain.
I remember what Jay Garfield wrote: "To
pee or not to pee? Could that be The Ques
tion?" Well,it certainly is in my case as I head
for the bathroom.
The irony of our age is that one may know
about Kripke's modal arguments against
Fregean descriptivism and yet not know how
to live.
"Of course I want things," I say to myself.
"1 want an LCD television; big, comfy furni
ture; an expensive red SUV; a high-paying
secure job at a Silicon Valley company;
bright, white teeth that gleam in the dark."

Yet when my mother asks me if I plan to go
shopping this week. I flatly decline. No.
My mind then starts thinking about
what friendship really is. I feel like I think
about things more than I need to. I remem
ber trying to figure out a theory of friend
ship, in which interactive causality with the
right cause is the sufficient and necessary
condition for friendship between two peo
ple.
According to my causal theory of friend
ship, two people are friends if and only if at
least some communicative interactions be
tween them are caused by their mutual de
sires to talk to each other (not by some fac
tor external to their relationship, such as
being in the same class).
"What about trust?" I ask myself, and
with that question a thousand counterexam
ples flood my mind. Confusion dilutes any
mental entity resembling a thought. Frustra
tion heats my body.
Abstract intellectualizations of life's vi
brant problems have rarely paid off. but I try
to keep my spirits up.
My next quest is to work out a complete
moral system, founded on general abstract
principles that can be extended to every sin
gle case. I try, but then it is too difficult. So 1
give up.
Instead. 1 remember. About two years
ago, my Yale interviewer asked me what
character quality I would most want in my
child. 1 said I did not want any kids. He asked
me why. I could not say I had already been
accepted to Stanford, so instead. I said.
"Well, sir, why bring another being into this
useless world? I mean, come on."
Then I go back to my earlier question of

an opaque and abstruse nature, the one that
concerns how to live. Recently, through an
Internet chat client, I told an acquaintance
that "these considerations had led me to the
pitiful but irrefutably true conclusion that
the question of living was a problem of insur
mountable difficulty and questionable intel
lectual nature." My comment elicited mere
silence. However, now 1 think "the hell with
her," and I don't mean that in a mean way. I
mean the sort of "the hell with it" that you
say to an unfixable car.
I'll tell you a secret. When I was a fresh
man, 1 was never into that whole freshman
enthusiasm thing.
As the evening sky spreads itself like a
rainbow of gray shades, 1 give up on reading
and sit in my room collecting my thoughts.
Descartes was wrong, 1 think. Descartes stat
ed, "I think therefore I am," but the argu
ment begs the question of his thinking.
Now. Descartes thinks that he thinks.
Given that his thinking is reliable and does
n't deceive him. the premise "I think" can be
granted. However, if something is wrong
with his faculty of thinking, the fact that he
thinks that he thinks cannot ensure that he
thinks, since his thinking is not reliable. So
the reliability of his thinking cannot be
achieved internally (by means of his think
ing), but should be proved externally — by
factors outside of his thinking.
Besides, the fact that there is a thought
does not entail that there is thinking. My
brain might be hooked up to some sort of a
machine that deterministically produces —
without thinking — all my thoughts.
"I do not think after all," I think to myself.
About two years ago. I met with consider
able aloofness Yale's rejection letter.
As the evening sky spreads itself like a
rainbow of gray shades, I begin to write.
But then, writing always scares me.

Cihan's little world was recently shattered b\
Chuck Palahniuk's "Choke," which heavily in
fluenced the writing of this column. Contact
