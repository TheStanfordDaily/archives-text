## Policies to curb ASSU spending ASSU hopes to recover from last year's overdraft with new restrictions 
### MATTHEW GRIBBLE 
In an effort to prevent another undergraduate spend
ing binge like last year's, which resulted in a $158,784.98
overdraft, the ASSU has instituted several restrictions on
student group funding and plans to announce further pol
icy changes this week.
"What we're doing now is putting a 'soft cap' of $40 per
Stanford undergraduate participating in the organiza
tion," said ASSU Senate Chair Chris Nguyen, a junior.
This is in addition to the $6,(XX) "hard cap," an absolute
limit on funding for each group, written into the Senate's
bylaws.
Money for undergraduate student groups comes from
the student activity fee. which consists of special fees and
the general fee. Six groups levy a special fee on both un
dergraduates and graduates, though students ask for re
funds. Students vote every year on whether to increase,
maintain or decrease the general fee, which is automatical
ly adjusted for inflation. Most student groups receiving
funding from the student activities fee apply for money
from the general fee.
However, the situation is by no means hopeless for stu-
dent groups seeking funding.
if you can justify your costs and
make the budget airtight, the appro
priations committee can't justify cut
ting money out," said Quiz Bowl
Club Financial Officer Elizabeth
Pratt, a sophomore.
There are currently 85 groups that
have requested funding from the Un
dergraduate Senate, and 490 groups
— graduate and undergraduate —
registered with the Office of Student
Affairs. Almost all undergraduate
groups are subject to the new policy.
The majority of student groups do
not have the 150 members required
for the "soft cap" to equal the "hard
cap," and the few groups that ap
proach this level of membership are
handled under the special fees sys
tem and are exempted from the poli
cy.
According to Nguyen, the idea is
to lower the amount of money spent
so that the ASSU can make sure that
each group has sufficient funding. So
far, the impact of the policy remains
unclear.
"Because the policies are new this
year, there is no data available on
how many groups are affected by the
'soft cap' in funding," said Justin Fish
ner-Wolfson, ASSU financial manag
er and chief executive officer of Stan
ford Student Enterprises.

However, he said that data is
available for last year's hard cap
funding requests.
"Out of 256 total applications,
only 21 requested the maximum —
or a greater — level of funding,"
Fishner-Wolfson said. "Only five stu
dent groups received the maximum
level of funding, including some
community service groups, whose
caps are $2,000 higher than those of
other groups [$8,000 instead of
$6,0(K)]."
Last year, the 158 percent budget
overdraft led to a complete funding
shutdown between February and
April, during which student groups
were unable to receive any funding.
Funding was only restored in April
after a special student ballot initia
tive, but only as a one-time emer
gency measure to get groups through
the year.
Yet even the new, more stringent
policies might not fully prevent fu
ture excess spending. ITie ASSU has
"cut the spending, but not enough."
Nguyen said.
"Funding for the undergraduate
student groups is higher than is safe,"
he said. "But with the new policy it
should come out to about right when
the year ends."
Details on the new policy are not
yet available, but Nguyen said that

Student group funding limited

the broad idea behind the recent pol
icy changes was to restore funding
policies to what they were before the
unsustainable levels of student group
funding began.
Before the nearly $7(K).(HK) budg
et surplus five years ago, funding
policies were far more conservative.
The surplus has since been depleted
by several policies, and Nguyen said
that the ASSU hopes to return to
workable policies and a more stable
financial situation.
"We're going to need to revisit
these policies to see if they work out
at the end of the year," he said.
In contrast to the undergraduate
boom and crash, the funding for
graduate student groups has been
consistently stable. Ilie Graduate
Student Council handles the funding
for these groups and has its own poli
cies, separate from the Undergradu
ate Senate.
"We're working to give out all the
general fees money this year by mak
ing more students aware of it." said
GSC Finance Committee Chair
Adam Beberg. a second-year doctor
al student in computer science. "We
hope we can expand what we can do
for grad students in the future."
The GSC does not contribute to
funding for student groups covered
bv the ASSU.
