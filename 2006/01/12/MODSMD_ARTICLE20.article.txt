# SPRING SEASON STARTS
## Six Stanford women take the court tomorrow in Las Vegas’ Freeman Invitational 
### MIA LEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With no definitive news on their 2(X)6 season lineup,
the No. 1 Stanford women's tennis team sends nine of its
players to individual tournaments this weekend with a
hit of bated breath.
There are great hopes and anticipation, of course,
that the seasoned likes of Alice Barnes, Anne Yelsey and
Theresa Logar will take their desert opponents by
storm. The three Cardinal begin their runs at the Free
man Invitational tomorrow. Seniors Joanna Kao and
Jessica Leek and sophomore Celia Durkin join them in
Las Vegas.
Meanwhile, teammates Whitney Deason, Megan Do
heny and Jessica Nguyen will compete in the National
Collegiate Tennis Championships (NCTC) Classic,
which begins tomorrow in Indian Wells, Calif.
"We had all fall to prepare, and now we've got two
more individual tournaments to start to piece together
our lineup," Stanford head coach Lele Forood said. "We
need one not only for Hawaii and Fresno State at the
end of the month, but we need to develop one for [Pacif
ic-10 Conference] match-

es, which start in Febru
ary."
"I'm not quite ready
to determine what the
line up is," Forood added.
"I think it's fair to say
that some of our veteran
players are going to play
in the top slots."
Barnes (7-2). a senior,
rose to No. 4 in national
rankings after reaching
the semifinals at regional
and national indoor tour
naments last fall.
Florida's Diana Sre
brovic, a stunning sopho
more transfer from Vir
ginia, soundly defeated
Barnes in November at
the ITA National Indoor
Championships, 7-5, 6-1.
She went on to get the
best of Logar in the In
door final, 7-5,6-4.

TOUGH ACT
TO FOLLOW
Expectations of this sea
son's Cardinal women
are high — not surpris
ing, considering the
team's 14 NCAA tro
phies. This year, senior
Alice Barnes takes her
place as the latest in a
long line of Cardinal ten
nis leaders. Her leader
ship on the court is al
ready apparent, as she is
currently ranked No. 4 in
the nation.

Srebrovic returns to action at Freeman, though she is
not seeded in the event. She and Barnes are tied at one
win apiece, with Barnes claiming the upper hand at the
Riviera/ITA Ail-American Championships last Octo
ber.
"It'll be nice to see [Srebrovic] again," Forood said.
"We also know the Georgia team pretty well. It's a good
opportunity for us to see a lot of the big teams from the
south, such as Duke."
No. 2 Yelsey, a junior, is the top seed at Freeman. She
could face former Pac-1() rival No. 6 Daniela Bercek.
who transferred to Duke this year and downed Yelsey at
the 2(M)5 All-American.
Based on seedings alone, Stanford is poised to domi
nate at the Rebels' Fertitta Complex this weektyid.'lhe
Cardinal occupies three of the eight top picks, with
Barnes weighing in third and Logar fifth.
Not to be outdone by all the visiting talent, the Lady
Rebels' own Elena Ciantcheva (15-4) is seeded fourth in
the tournament, and is ranked No. 8 nationally.
'ITie 2f>th annual NCTC affair at Indian Wells sets a
similar stage for the Cardinal. Freshmen Doheny (2-1)

The Cardinal women will use the upcoming individual tournaments to make lineup decisions for team competitions this spring, which
include the Pac-10 matches that kick off next month.
