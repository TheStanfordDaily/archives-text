# Tennis takes on SoCal challenge
## Freshman Bruch becomes Cardinal to watch at tournament 
### BEN BACKES 
As Stanford men's tennis looks to
improve upon last year's disappoint
ing season, it will first try to better its
past performances at the Sherwood
Cup. In the past two years, the Cardi
nal have won only two of 14 first
round singles matches in the tourna
ment, which will be held tomorrow
through Monday in Thousand Oaks,
Calif.
The draw includes three top 10
teams who defeated Stanford last
year: No. 5 UCLA, No. 7 Baylor and
No. 9 Pepperdine. This weekend
should provide a first look at Stan
ford's potential to compete with the
cream of the crop.
Between the loss of Sam Warburg

and Phil Sheng and the arrival of a
strong freshman class, the Cardinal
lineup has undergone much recon
struction since last year. I lowever, the
top half of the singles lineup — which
was Stanford's strength last season —
should continue to dominate oppo
nents with the additions of freshman
Matt Bruch and junior James Fade.
Bruch. who beat four ranked op
ponents during his run to the semifi
nals of the All-Anierican Champi
onships — his first collegiate tourna
ment — sits at No. 4 in the recently
released ITA rankings.
Head coach John Whitlinger likes
Bruchs chances as the freshman
proves he deserves his high ranking.
"He's played a lot of big matches,
and he's a guy I think can handle that
kind of pressure," Whitlinger said.
"He's got a target on his back now,
and it'll be interesting to see how he
handles that."

Doubles pairings are currently a question mark for the Stanford men, who hope to find the right combinations
this weekend in Thousand Oaks, Calif.
