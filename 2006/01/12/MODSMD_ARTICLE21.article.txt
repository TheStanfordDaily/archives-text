# Tennis takes on SoCal challenge
## Freshman Bruch becomes Cardinal to watch at tournament 
### BEN BACKES 
As Stanford men's tennis looks to
improve upon last year's disappoint
ing season, it will first try to better its
past performances at the Sherwood
Cup. In the past two years, the Cardi
nal have won only two of 14 first
round singles matches in the tourna
ment, which will be held tomorrow
through Monday in Thousand Oaks,
Calif.
The draw includes three top 10
teams who defeated Stanford last
year: No. 5 UCLA, No. 7 Baylor and
No. 9 Pepperdine. This weekend
should provide a first look at Stan
ford's potential to compete with the
cream of the crop.
Between the loss of Sam Warburg

and Phil Sheng and the arrival of a
strong freshman class, the Cardinal
lineup has undergone much recon
struction since last year. I lowever, the
top half of the singles lineup — which
was Stanford's strength last season —
should continue to dominate oppo
nents with the additions of freshman
Matt Bruch and junior James Fade.
Bruch. who beat four ranked op
ponents during his run to the semifi
nals of the All-Anierican Champi
onships — his first collegiate tourna
ment — sits at No. 4 in the recently
released ITA rankings.
Head coach John Whitlinger likes
Bruchs chances as the freshman
proves he deserves his high ranking.
"He's played a lot of big matches,
and he's a guy I think can handle that
kind of pressure," Whitlinger said.
"He's got a target on his back now,
and it'll be interesting to see how he
handles that."

Doubles pairings are currently a question mark for the Stanford men, who hope to find the right combinations
this weekend in Thousand Oaks, Calif.
After sitting out Inst year. Pade is
set to bolster Stanford's singles and
doubles lineups. In Stanford's match
against Hawaii in November. Pade
won in straight sets at the No. 3 sin
gles position and paired with K('
Corkery to win the No. 1 doubles
match. In October, Pade reached the
semifinals of the Wilson/ITA Re
gional Championships.
"James is a big-time player,"

Whitlinger said. "He's very capable
of beating anyone in the country at
any time."
Back for one final year at the Farm
is senior captain KC Corkery, who
compiled a 21-4 dual match record
last year while playing at the No. 2 po
sition. Despite a fast start to the sea
son— which included winning the
Wilson/ITA Regional Champi
onships and reaching the semifinals
of the National Indoor Champi
onships — Corkery is ranked No. 21.
In Stanford's first match of the
season against Hawaii, Corkery
proved he can take up the role of the
team's top player, winning convinc

ingly at both the No. I singles and
doubles spots.
Junior James Wan, who won in the
No. 4 singles slot against Hawaii, is an
other key player who returns for
Stanford. Wan. who was No. 46 in the
preseason rankings, has posted an im
pressive 43- 1 ) career dual match
record. His 2005 season included a
run to the quarterfinals of the Pacific
-10 Conference Tournament. He will
look to improve upon last year's per
formance in the Sherwood Cup,
where he recovered from a first
round loss to win the consolation title.
In addition to allowing Stan
ford's top players to test their

strength against some of the nation's
best, the Sherwood Cup is an oppor
tunity for the coaching staff to con
tinue tinkering with the doubles
pairings. Other than the No. 1 dou
bles team of Warburg and Corkery,
Stanford was plagued by inconsis
tent doubles play last year, especial
ly at the No. 2 position, where the
Cardinal only won eight of 25
matches in dual match play.
"Every time you go out there and
play a tournament it's always a learn
ing experience," Whitlinger said.
"We have some good doubles play
ers. and it's a matter of finding the
right combinations."
