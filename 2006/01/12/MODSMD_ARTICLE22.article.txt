# Cheering and jeering the year behind us
## 
### 
Now that it's 2006, it's time to look
back at the highlights and low
lights of the past year.
Last year started out with USC killing
Oklahoma in the National Champi
onship game. That was before Matt met
Nick, before the Reggie-Barry-Gale
comparisons and before Pete Carroll lost
his mind.
Carroll's former NFL team, the Patri
ots, beat the Eagles in the Super Bowl.
Terrell Owens, using a mandate from
God, came back from an injury to play a
monster game and nine months later, sin
gle handedly destroyed his second NFL
franchise. TO wins the award for biggest
tool of 2005. Moving on.
The Stanford basketball team man
aged to make the NCAA Tournament,
despite having no true shooting guard
and featuring a three-man bench of
Jason Haas and two freshmen.The loss to
Mississippi State was tough, but Trent
Johnson did a fine job with the initial
hand he was dealt.
On a side note, the team has faced an
absurd amount of injury since moving to
the renovated Maples Pavilion. Dan
Grunfeld, Fred Washington, Peter
Prowitt, Matt Haryasz and Chris Her
nandez have all faced injury over the past
year. Combined with the "curse of
Emeka Okafor," which makes it impossi
ble for the Cardinal to fill scholarships (a
whole different column), the "curse of
the bouncy floor" could seriously weak
en Stanford basketball.
At the same time, a North Carolina
team featuring four NBA lottery picks
coasted through to the NCAA Champi
onship and gave Roy Williams his first
title. I don't really care that much about
good ol' Roy, except his win let me win
my NCAA bracket for the second year in
a row.
In the professional basketball world,
we witnessed a well played, exciting
seven-game Finals series between De
troit and San Antonio. And it's looking
like we might see a repeat matchup in
2006.
The Pacers stuck by Ron Artest dur
ing his yearlong suspension and he re
warded them by demanding a trade.
Ron, you mess with Larry Bird and the
basketball gods will punish you.
Phil Jackson and Pat Riley coached.
Yup. it was 1994 once again.
In baseball, the Chicago White Sox,
the "Arrested Development" of the
baseball world, beat the Houston Astros
in the World Series. Yeah, but more peo
ple were focused on the Red Sox, who
were playing "Survivor" with their front
office and the Yankees, who spent $200
million and still only had one player
(Derek Jeter) with a heart.
Meanwhile, the game was tainted
with steroid accusations. I really got
nothing more on that.
On a happier note, the NHL returned
after a two-year absence with big plans
for reviving the sport. Still, when you go
from ESPN to OLN as your major carri
er, that's bad. My idea to increase interest
in the game: Mighty Ducks Part 4.
Then Stanford football happened.
The Cardinal posted a one-game im
provement from 2(K)4. going 5-6. Howev
er, this season will be remembered as one
where the team was an instant replay and
a defensive stop away from being 7-4.
The Cardinal were 4-1 on the road
and 1-5 at Stanford Stadium. I think I'll
be like everyone else and blame it on the
yell leaders.
Ihe good news is that Ted Leland an
nounced the renovation of the stadium
as his final project as AD.The bad news is
that my class won't get to graduate in the
stadium. I guess Ted has something
against the class of 2006.
Speaking of which, Ted is heading to
Pacific. Someone there has got to be
thinking,"! know he helped win all those
Director's Cups but didn't his football
and his men's basketball team lose to
UC-Davis?"
Even though it happened in 2006, I
still count the Rose Bowl fiasco as part of
2(X)5. I seriously wonder what Reggie
Bush was thinking on that lateral play.
Probably something to the tune of "I won
a Heisman, I'm the first pick in the draft,
hell, I'll try this and then try walking on
water." Thanks Reggie, your out of body
experience cost me 40 bucks. And my
pride.
Thank god for 2006.
