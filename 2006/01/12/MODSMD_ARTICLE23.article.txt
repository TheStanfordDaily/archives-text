# Men kick off year against California
## Alumni meet provides light-hearted prep for competition 
### ABBY ZEITLIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's gymnastics
team kicked off its season with a bit
of comedy last weekend when for
mer members joined the current var
sity at the alumni meet.
Though the returning alumni put
on a great show, there was no funny
business from the Cardinal. While
the alumni clowned around, the
team demonstrated that they have
worked hard in the preseason and
are ready to face the competition.
The squad's first challenge is a Friday
night face-off against California.
While last year's Cardinal team
was young, with five freshman mem
bers, it is now stronger and well ad
justed to collegiate competition.
"The team...is much more me
thodical about its training and much
more mature about it," Stanford
coach Thom Glielmi said.
A preseason coaches' poll has
ranked Stanford sixth in the nation.
This reflects the Cardinal's strong
finish at the end of last year, which
was highlighted by impressive per
formances from sophomores David
Sender, Sho Nakamori and Jason
Shen and junior Dylan Carney, all of
whom advanced to the NCAA indi
vidual qualifiers last season. Sender
also finished second this summer at
the U.S. Senior Nationals.
A new development for the team
this year will be its direction under
two new captains. Senior Nate
Downs and junior Peter Derman will
lead the squad. Downs and Derman
bring about a shift in the team's dy
namic because their style is different
from that of previous captains.
"It's kind of hard being a
leader...because in the past we have
had leaders like Dan Gill (Class of
2004) who was an all-arounder,"
Downs said. "It is a little bit harder
when, in my case, I'm only doing
three events. 1 am really trying to
work on being more of a vocal leader
in the gym. I do my part and then
have to try and motivate in other
ways."
But Glielmi is confident in both
men's ability to lead his team in the
gym and out.
"What I am coming to realize is
that they do more outside the gym as
far as showing leadership and help
ing the guys than other captains,"
Glielmi said.
Even though the Cardinal have a
positive outlook on the season, they
have already suffered minor set
backs.
Freshman Greg Ter-Zakhariants
placed fourth last year at the Junior
Olympic Championships but injured
his neck and is redshirting this sea
son. After breaking his hand last
month, Nakamori will be unable to
compete against the Golden Bears
this weekend.
A new NCAA judging system has
also posed problems for the Cardi
nal.
The new code of points used by
the NCAA is based on the Federa
tion of International Gymnastics
(FIG) system, which is the judging
system used in the Olympics and

world championships. The new 10.0
judging scale requires the Cardinal's
routines to be longer and the gym
nasts to do a higher value of greater
skills.
The Cardinal could benefit since
the new judging system affects every
team, but Glielmi says that everyone
is struggling through the kinks and
their new routines. This new code of
points also makes it impossible for
the Cardinal to predict how other
teams have adjusted and what their
competition will look like this sea
son.
"It is just anybody's game with
the new code. If we do everything
right then you know we will win; if
they do everything right then they
will win," Downs said.
Despite the concerns, the alumni
meet showed the Cardinal squad has
a few tricks up its sleeve.
Glielmi added that the new judg
ing system won't affect the rings
team too much because it already
has high-valued skills. Derman.
Sender and junior Alex Schorsch
demonstrated their strengths on the

"The team...is
much more
methodical
about its
training and
much more
mature about it."

coach

rings while freshman Bryant Had
den. who will step in to anchor the
team, made his first appearance as a
collegiate athlete.
"I was very pleased with Bryant's
effort this weekend," Glielmi said.
"We always want to start out the
event with a clean, solid routine that
we can count on. He's in a tough po
sition, but he is a solid competitor,
has solid routines and is a clean gym
nast with good difficulty."
Hadden is scheduled to make his
competitive college debut at Cal this
weekend.
Glielmi promises a dynamic sea
son for the Cardinal. Downs has in
vented his own release move on the
high bar. It's a variation of a release
done 15 years ago with the Stalder
that Downs added. Downs is the only
athlete in the world performing this
skill.
Thanks to new leadership, a more
mature Cardinal and a new team en
ergy, Stanford looks ready to go this
weekend as the squad faces the
Bears.
"Our goal is for us to do what we
are capable of doing," Glielmi said.
"If we do that, no one will be able to
touch us."

A new NCAA judging system is just one of the challenges that the Cardinal men face this season, but the sguad's rings specialists are expected to adjust well.
Head coach Thorn Glielmi said that their routines include enough high-valued skills already to easily transition to the new system.
The Stanford men's gymnastics
team kicked off its season with a bit
of comedy last weekend when for
mer members joined the current var
sity at the alumni meet.
Though the returning alumni put
on a great show, there was no funny
business from the Cardinal. While
the alumni clowned around, the
team demonstrated that they have
worked hard in the preseason and
are ready to face the competition.
The squad's first challenge is a Friday
night face-off against California.
While last year's Cardinal team
was young, with five freshman mem
bers, it is now stronger and well ad
justed to collegiate competition.
"The team...is much more me
thodical about its training and much
more mature about it," Stanford
coach Thom Glielmi said.
A preseason coaches' poll has
ranked Stanford sixth in the nation.
This reflects the Cardinal's strong
finish at the end of last year, which
was highlighted by impressive per
formances from sophomores David
Sender, Sho Nakamori and Jason
Shen and junior Dylan Carney, all of
whom advanced to the NCAA indi
vidual qualifiers last season. Sender
also finished second this summer at
the U.S. Senior Nationals.
A new development for the team
this year will be its direction under
two new captains. Senior Nate
Downs and junior Peter Derman will
lead the squad. Downs and Derman
bring about a shift in the team's dy
namic because their style is different
from that of previous captains.
"It's kind of hard being a
leader...because in the past we have
had leaders like Dan Gill (Class of
2004) who was an all-arounder,"
Downs said. "It is a little bit harder
when, in my case, I'm only doing
three events. 1 am really trying to
work on being more of a vocal leader
in the gym. I do my part and then
have to try and motivate in other
ways."
But Glielmi is confident in both
men's ability to lead his team in the
gym and out.
"What I am coming to realize is
that they do more outside the gym as
far as showing leadership and help
ing the guys than other captains,"
Glielmi said.
Even though the Cardinal have a
positive outlook on the season, they
have already suffered minor set
backs.
Freshman Greg Ter-Zakhariants
placed fourth last year at the Junior
Olympic Championships but injured
his neck and is redshirting this sea
son. After breaking his hand last
month, Nakamori will be unable to
compete against the Golden Bears
this weekend.
A new NCAA judging system has
also posed problems for the Cardi
nal.
The new code of points used by
the NCAA is based on the Federa
tion of International Gymnastics
(FIG) system, which is the judging
system used in the Olympics and

world championships. The new 10.0
judging scale requires the Cardinal's
routines to be longer and the gym
nasts to do a higher value of greater
skills.
The Cardinal could benefit since
the new judging system affects every
team, but Glielmi says that everyone
is struggling through the kinks and
their new routines. This new code of
points also makes it impossible for
the Cardinal to predict how other
teams have adjusted and what their
competition will look like this sea
son.
"It is just anybody's game with
the new code. If we do everything
right then you know we will win; if
they do everything right then they
will win," Downs said.
Despite the concerns, the alumni
meet showed the Cardinal squad has
a few tricks up its sleeve.
Glielmi added that the new judg
ing system won't affect the rings
team too much because it already
has high-valued skills. Derman.
Sender and junior Alex Schorsch
demonstrated their strengths on the

"The team...is
much more
methodical
about its
training and
much more
mature about it."

rings while freshman Bryant Had
den. who will step in to anchor the
team, made his first appearance as a
collegiate athlete.
"I was very pleased with Bryant's
effort this weekend," Glielmi said.
"We always want to start out the
event with a clean, solid routine that
we can count on. He's in a tough po
sition, but he is a solid competitor,
has solid routines and is a clean gym
nast with good difficulty."
Hadden is scheduled to make his
competitive college debut at Cal this
weekend.

vented his own release move on the
high bar. It's a variation of a release
done 15 years ago with the Stalder
