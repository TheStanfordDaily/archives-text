## McCaffery to leave CEO position 
### LOREN NEWMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last spring. President and Chief Executive Officer
of the Stanford Management Company Mike McCaf
fery announced his intention to step down from his po
sition at Stanford Management Company (SMC). After
five-and-a-half years of managing the Stanford endow-

ment, McCaffery is leaving
to form a private investment
company similar to the one
he headed — Robertson
Stephens — before accept
ing the position of CEO at
SMC.
"I informed the SMC
Board that 1 intended to
step down during fiscal year
2006 or at the latest, fiscal
year 2007 because of my de
sire to return to the entre
preneurial business envi-

ronment," McCaffery said."l spent the first 25 years of
my career in the investment banking and investment
management industries. 1 wanted to start and build a
new business."
A search for McCaffery's replacement will begin im
mediately, according to Ward Woods, a member of the
Stanford Board of Trustees and chair of the SMC Board
of Directors. During this process, McCaffery, a graduate
of the Stanford Graduate School of Business, will re
main at the University and act as a consultant to the new
firm. Though he plans to leave as soon as a replacement
is found, he is committed to stay as long as it takes to
find a suitable successor.
"Mike McCaffery has been a leader in endowment
investing and has provided stellar results for Stanford,
as well as being a great friend of the University," Woods
said. "He will be difficult to replace, and we appreciate
that he is willing to stay on so long to ensure that we
have the time to find another star performer to lead the
Stanford Management Company."
The SMC was created in 2001 to oversee and manage
University assets, both financial and otherwise. The

company supervises the approximately $12 billion of
endowment and trust assets, expendable funds and
commercial real estate investments. Recently, the com
pany has been flourishing under McCaffery's guidance.
"We are very pleased to be up 19.5 percent on the
one-year," McCaffery said in a recent press release.
"However, we are more focused on longer term results
such as our five-year investment performance."

In my opinion,
Stanford is the greatest
University in the world.

In addition to los
ing McCaffery, Chief
Investment Officer
Michael Ross and
Managing Director of
Private Equity David
Burke left the SMC to
join McCaffery at his
new, unnamed invest
ment company at the
end of 2005.
"Mike Ross and
Dave Burke left SMC
as of Dec. 31; they will

be my founding partners in this new investment man
agement venture," McCaffery said. "They continue on
consulting contracts to SMC during this transition peri
od."
"We also wish Mike Ross and David Burke well in
their new endeavor," Woods added.
Eric Upin will act as the interim chief investment of
ficer in place of Ross. SMC Private Equity Directors Sa
guna Umerjee and Georganne Perkins, will take the
place of Burke.
McCaffery spoke positively about his experience at
Stanford. He plans to continue to help the University in
any way possible.
"I feel extremely fortunate to have been CEO of
SMC for the last few years, and SMC has achieved ex
cellent performance as a result of the effort and com
mitment of an excellent investment staff, and an out
standing board of directors," McCaffery said. "I will
miss being at Stanford on a daily basis, but I will contin
ue to be committed to the University, and serve the Uni
versity in any way that I can be helpful. In my opinion.
Stanford is the greatest University in the world."
