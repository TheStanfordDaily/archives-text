party-hardy anyway. But
that doesn't mean thev

don't want to — or don't know how to — have a good time
after a stressful week of class.
Fall quarter at Stanford is most renowned for wel
come-back-to-campus soirees. Full Moon on the Quad
and the myriad frat parties thrown during many a young
man's pledge quarter. Of course, this past fall quarter
was no different, and most weekends the campus was
alive with tons of students on a mission to find a great
time.
Ralph Castro, Stanford's interim party planning edu
cator, reported that there were an astonishing 166 regis
tered parties on campus this past quarter.
"Over the past six years," Castro said, "we have seen
an increase in the number of parties registered on cam
pus."
The "work hard, play hard" attitude is definitely a pop
ular one on campus, and each quarter brings with it the
promise of a new batch of even more exciting weekend
fun.
Many students don't know the extra effort that goes
into throwing a memorable bash. However, junior Darius
Ameri, the house manager at ZAP, said that hosting par
ties is worth the effort.especially when the night turns out
to be one for the history books.
"Throwing a party is pretty easy if you're organized
and on top of the paperwork." he said." Ilien, the Office

of Student Affairs either approves or
denies your request, and from there
it's all a matter of a few phone calls to
DJs, outside security and Ernie's for
a few kegs."
So did all the party-planning turn
fall quarter into a successful social
scene?
"1 had some great times this quar
ter," said Clea Alsip, a sophomore.
"Of course, many quarters here have
been fantastic, but I would definitely
say that this quarter was a memo
rable one."
David Heyman. a junior, felt sim
ilarly.
"I thought there were a handful
of really good parties this fall," he
said. "I had a lot of fun."
Many students, however, felt that
while there was a lot of potential in
the party scene, it was a disappoint
ment compared to quarters past.
Poppy Carlig, a sophomore,
shared the sentiment of many Stan
ford students that there were some
major issues with how parties were
scheduled this quarter.

"I felt like many of the frats were
trying to compete with each other,"
she said. "The first weekend is a
prime example, when there were
four parties in one night. In this re
spect, I believe there was poor plan
ning in regard to the party scene."
The party planners could do bet
ter, she said, if they would just com
municate with each other in order to
spread out their parties so that there
aren't weekends with nothing to do.
"If we were to space these nights
out better next quarter, it would ba
sically give us more nights to go out
and have fun," she said.
The one batch of students who
have nothing to compare fall's party
scene with — save high school —
are the freshmen.
Freshman Holly Stebingsaid that
she definitely enjoyed the quarter,
even though there wasn't always a
ton of action.
"1 felt like some of the parties
were really great and fun," she said.
"But there were other times when 1
was thinking,' There is nothing going
on.'"
Even though she sometimes
wished for more social events, she
said her high expectations for fellow
partygoers were absolutely fulfilled.
"It was great," she said, "because

I was expecting laid-back people
who I could relate to and have fun
with, and I feel that 1 really found
that here. All the people 1 met made
the weekends really fun."
Freshman fall, of course, usually
brings with it the most excitement
and suspense of any quarter when it
comes to the social scene.
Carlig described the letdown felt
by many students when they enter
their sophomore years.
"To be honest, I was a little disap
pointed with the past fall quarter,"
she said, "but perhaps this is because
the freshman experience is simply
impossible to match."
But for freshmen worried about
losing momentum after this year,
they should be take heart that every
year at Stanford can have its own
party atmosphere.
"Freshman year doesn't have
many Greek formats, mixers, special
dinners and date dashes," Ameri
said, "which [are the events that]
make upperclassmen life fun. i lived
in SAE my sophomore year, which is
a 24-hour party with a great group of
guys, so that was great. And this year
has gotten even better now that I'm
finally 21. So 1 think it just really gets
better year after year if you keep
your social life up."
