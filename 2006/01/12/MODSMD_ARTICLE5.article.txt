## Recruiting scandal gets attention Strip club incident part of discrimination lawsuit 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR MANAGING EDITOR 
While a former Stanford accounting em
ployee has filed suit against the University, cit
ing retaliation and discrimination from her su
perior, the charges themselves haven't attract
ed the most attention. Instead, the focus has
been on the three paragraphs of the 35-page
document that allude to Stanford football play
ers taking recruits out to a strip club in 2003.
Ilie story, which has been picked up by
news sources across the country, has generat
ed interest in Stanford's otherwise model ath
letic reputation.
"According to NCAA rules, (the incident]
does no harm to Stanford's reputation because
no violation of NCAA rules was made." said
Stanford Counsel Patrick Dunkley. "Regard
ing whether it causes any harm to Stanford's
reputation, I would certainly hope that after
stellar performances on and off the field, one
incident of conduct by a small number of stu
dents is not enough to tarnish the reputation of
Stanford."
I"he lawsuit, filed by former Stanford em
ployee Sheryl Kanzaki on Nov. 18, refers to re
imbursements requested by football players
fora trip to a San Francisco strip club. Officials
say that coaches were unaware of the event, but
they also note that at the time, such an action
did not constitute an NCAA violation.
"Stanford regrets the actions of student ath
letes who accompanied recruits in 2003 to adult
entertainment venues," stated a University
press release. "Although such actions did not
violate NCAA regulations, we believe our stu
dents should abide by strict standards of con
duct that obviously preclude such entertain
ment as any part of recruitment activity."
Following nationwide requests of the
NCAA in 2004, Stanford revamped its policies
for recruitment. Student athletes
serving as hosts are currently re
quired to sign forms before and after
their recruit hosting period stating
that recruits cannot engage in alco
hol. drugs or sexual activities â€” and
even fraternity parties cut it too
close. Aside from the forms, howev
er, the University relies on the honor
system.
"There are no requirements to
say what they will do, but the stu
dent-hosts are notified what enter
tainment is prohibited and must ac
count that they did not participate in
prohibited activities," Dunkley said.
When questioned about the

above allegations. Stanford athletes
were unable to comment, in accor
dance with an e-mail sent to all stu
dent athletes by Senior Assistant
Athletic Director Gary Migdol that
said, "in light of today's news, if you
[student athlete) receive any media
inquiries please be sure you direct
them to the Media Relations Office,
per Athletic Department policies.
Our policy is that student-athletes
should not conduct any media inter
views that have not been arranged
by a member of the media relations
stall."
Before the new regulations, alco
hol and strip clubs were a well
known component of the recruiting
process. In particular, students
across campus knew about the foot
ball incident.
In the last few years, multiple uni
versities have had to deal with large

NCAA infractions and embarrass
ing athlete behavior, but Stanford
maintained a solid reputation. It has.
however, witnessed some miscon
duct from its athletes.
In May 2(X)3, the school attracted
local media coverage after four foot
ball players were charged with
Minor in Possession after hosting a
"power hour" with four sorority
members. There was no NCAA ac
tion. but the players were sentenced
in Santa Clara County to a fine and
community service. In 1994. mem
bers of the Cardinal baseball team
were charged with vandalism.
According to the lawsuit, which
claims that Kanzaki was mistreated
by Senior Associate Athletic Direc
tor Debra Gore-Mann, administra
tors may have tried to hide the inci
dent by disposing of handwritten re
ceipts.
