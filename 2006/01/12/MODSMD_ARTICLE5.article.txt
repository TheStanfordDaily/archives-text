## Recruiting scandal gets attention Strip club incident part of discrimination lawsuit 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR MANAGING EDITOR 
While a former Stanford accounting em
ployee has filed suit against the University, cit
ing retaliation and discrimination from her su
perior, the charges themselves haven't attract
ed the most attention. Instead, the focus has
been on the three paragraphs of the 35-page
document that allude to Stanford football play
ers taking recruits out to a strip club in 2003.
Ilie story, which has been picked up by
news sources across the country, has generat
ed interest in Stanford's otherwise model ath
letic reputation.
"According to NCAA rules, (the incident]
does no harm to Stanford's reputation because
no violation of NCAA rules was made." said
Stanford Counsel Patrick Dunkley. "Regard
ing whether it causes any harm to Stanford's
reputation, I would certainly hope that after
stellar performances on and off the field, one
incident of conduct by a small number of stu
dents is not enough to tarnish the reputation of
Stanford."
I"he lawsuit, filed by former Stanford em
ployee Sheryl Kanzaki on Nov. 18, refers to re
imbursements requested by football players
fora trip to a San Francisco strip club. Officials
say that coaches were unaware of the event, but
they also note that at the time, such an action
did not constitute an NCAA violation.
"Stanford regrets the actions of student ath
letes who accompanied recruits in 2003 to adult
entertainment venues," stated a University
press release. "Although such actions did not
violate NCAA regulations, we believe our stu
dents should abide by strict standards of con
duct that obviously preclude such entertain
ment as any part of recruitment activity."
Following nationwide requests of the
NCAA in 2004, Stanford revamped its policies
