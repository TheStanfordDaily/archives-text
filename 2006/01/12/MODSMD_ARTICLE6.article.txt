# Residences prepare for winter quarter ski trips
## Staff members began planning annual trip in fall quarter

After unpacking their things as they return from win
ter break,many Stanford students will attend only a few
classes before packing up again to hit the slopes. In re
sponse to ideal skiing weather and relatively light work
loads. dorms across campus will be departing for the
Sierra during the next few weekends.
At this time of year dorms generally rent large homes

in theTahoe area to accommodate the students; howev
er. in the past, dorm staffs have been forced to find other
housing mid-trip because rental companies found out
the dorms were exceeding maximum occupancies.
Dana Schmidt, a co-term student who is the RA of
Row house 717 Dolores, doesn't anticipate any such
problems with her residents' housing arrangements.
"Our house is actually pretty big." she said. "It sleeps
about 20 people, and there arc 33 people going on the
trip, so the ratio of people going to the occupancy limit
is pretty good."
Larkin RA Kavi Vyas, a junior, said, "The Residen
tial Education official policy states that il you break the
contract with the renter, then there are certainly

grounds for them to evict your party."
Although officially the house is rented out to one
person in Larkin for the correct number of occupants,
Vyas admitted that a larger number of students will
probably occupy the house.
Schmidt said she and other staff members at 717
began planning the trip during management training
and that the rental was booked in the first week of fall
quarter. Vyas said he also began to make reservations
toward the end of October with fellow RAs. Both dorms
had paid deposits on their houses, and Vyas said that
Larkin paid in full before winter break.
