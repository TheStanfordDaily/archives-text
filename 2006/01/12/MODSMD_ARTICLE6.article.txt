# Residences prepare for winter quarter ski trips
## Staff members began planning annual trip in fall quarter 
### KATHERINE COX CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After unpacking their things as they return from win
ter break,many Stanford students will attend only a few
classes before packing up again to hit the slopes. In re
sponse to ideal skiing weather and relatively light work
loads. dorms across campus will be departing for the
Sierra during the next few weekends.
At this time of year dorms generally rent large homes

in theTahoe area to accommodate the students; howev
er. in the past, dorm staffs have been forced to find other
housing mid-trip because rental companies found out
the dorms were exceeding maximum occupancies.
Dana Schmidt, a co-term student who is the RA of
Row house 717 Dolores, doesn't anticipate any such
problems with her residents' housing arrangements.
"Our house is actually pretty big." she said. "It sleeps
about 20 people, and there arc 33 people going on the
trip, so the ratio of people going to the occupancy limit
is pretty good."
Larkin RA Kavi Vyas, a junior, said, "The Residen
tial Education official policy states that il you break the
contract with the renter, then there are certainly

grounds for them to evict your party."
Although officially the house is rented out to one
person in Larkin for the correct number of occupants,
Vyas admitted that a larger number of students will
probably occupy the house.
Schmidt said she and other staff members at 717
began planning the trip during management training
and that the rental was booked in the first week of fall
quarter. Vyas said he also began to make reservations
toward the end of October with fellow RAs. Both dorms
had paid deposits on their houses, and Vyas said that
Larkin paid in full before winter break.
Senior Bert Richly, the financial
manager at 717, said houses are un
likely to recover this money if they
pull out of the contract.
"In years past, a bunch of houses
lost their deposits or even all of the
rent because it's always a last
minute thing, with the weather or
whatnot," he said.
Both houses' ski trips occur this
holiday weekend, but Larkin will
bus approximately 80 freshmen to
(he snow, while the residents of 717
will drive themselves.
"People will be driving personal
vehicles so they can be more flexible
about what they do up there and
when they leave," Schmidt said.
Aside from recreational snow
sports, Schmidt suspects that there

will be plenty of "hanging out in the
hot tub and some alcohol."
Larkin residents will also have a
number of sporting alternatives to
skiing and snowboarding.
"There will be tobogganing, sled
ding and snowmobiling if people
want to," Vyas said.
These activities will be at the ex
pense of the individual student, on
top of the mandatory fee of $25 per
person. According to Vyas, whatev
er isn't covered by the fee is cush
ioned with house funds. Residents
of 717 will fund their trip with a
similar fee supplemented by
money from the house-wide social
bill.
Dorm food will follow the fresh
men skiers to the slopes.
Vyas explained, "The students
can trade in the meals they would be
missing and be compensated with
food on the trip. ITie dining staff will
give us food and supplies so we can
cook up there."

The staff of 717, on the other
hand, will make several runs to
Costco to feed their group of skiers.
Vyas was positive about his own
ski trip experience.
"1 learned to ski on my freshman
snow trip," he said. "You meet a lot
of people that maybe you wouldn't
otherwise because of geographical
separations in the dorm."
He credited the Larkin dorm
government with handling much of
the preparations for this weekend's
trip.
"Being an RA is a little more
stressful than being a resident, but
the students in dorm government re
ally took a lot of the responsibilities
off our shoulders," he said.
Eddy Marks, a freshman in
Larkin, gave one other good reason
for attending.
"In Larkin, we have some pools
on who's going to hook up on snow
trip," he said. "We want to see how it
turns out."
