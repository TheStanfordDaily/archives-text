## Alito eludes Dems' abortion questions 
### DAVID ESPO ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Supreme Court nominee
Samuel Alito turned aside Democratic attacks on his ju
dicial record and credibility at contentious confirmation
hearings Wednesday that left his wife in tears.
"If I'm confirmed I'll be myself," said Alito, a 15-year
veteran of a federal appeals court, named to succeed Jus
tice Sandra Day O'Connor fora swing seat on the high
court.
Challenged by Democrats, Alito repeatedly said he
had no memory of involvement with the conservative
Concerned Alumni of Princeton, though he highlighted
his membership in a 1985 job application for the Reagan
administration.
He repudiated the opinions expressed in articles in
the organization's magazine. "They're not my views...l
deplore them," he said of writing that contained materi
al that was racist, sexist and homophobic.
Under persistent questioning, Alito also declined for
a second straight day to say whether he believes, as he did
in 1985, that the Constitution contains no right to an
abortion. "I don't think it's appropriate for me to speak
about issues that could realistically come up" before the
courts, he said.
Alito, 55, was unflappable for hours on end in
marathon questioning before the Senate Judiciary Com
mittee. But his wife, Martha-Ann Bomgardner, grew
emotional near the end of the day and left the hearing
room weeping.
"Judge Alito. I'm sorry that you've had to go through
this. I am sorry that your family has had to sit here and lis
ten to this," said Sen. Lindsey Graham. A moment earli
er, the South Carolina Republican had offered Alito a
chance to defend his integrity, asking whether he was a
"closet bigot."
"I'm not any kind of bigot, I'm not," said Alito.
"No sir, you're not," Graham agreed.
Alito's wife returned with him following a brief recess.
The nominee commands the support of all 10 Repub
licans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and while the
Democrats could delay his approval by the panel they
cannot block it. His prospects for confirmation by the full
Senate are also strong, although Democrats have not
ruled out the possibility of a filibuster that could require
supporters to post 60 votes in the 100-member chamber.
Still, unlike Chief Justice John Roberts last fall, Alito

may draw the opposition of all eight Democrats on the
Judiciary panel, and partisan maneuvering was evident
Wednesday.
Abortion triggered one incident. Sen. Richard
Durbin. who supports abortion rights, told Alito that his
1985 written view on abortion "does not evidence an
open mind. It evidences a mind that sadly is closed in
some areas."
Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, saying he wanted to
"razz" Durbin,soon noted that the Illinois Democrat had
himself changed his mind on abortion. "For 45 years. Sen
ator Durbin was adamantly pro-life, and he wrote multi
ple, multiple letters expressing that up until 1989," said
Republican Coburn.
Later, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy pressed the commit
tee's chairman. Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., to subpoena
records at the Library of Congress that might shed light
on Alito's membership in the conservative Princeton
group.
"If I'm going to be denied that, I'd want to give notice
to the chair that you're going to hear it again and again
and again and we're going to have votes of this commit

tee again and again and again until we have a resolution,"
said the Massachusetts Democrat.
Specter, bristling, said,"l'm not concerned about your
threats to have votes again, again and again. And I'm the
chairman of this committee...And I'm not going to have
you run this committee."
The tempest proved short-lived. Specter later an
nounced the committee would have access to the records.
Kennedy questioned Alito sharply about the organi
zation. which drew notice for opposing admission prac
tices that resulted in rising numbers of women and mi
nority students at the Ivy League school.
"If I had received ahy information at any point re
garding any of the matters you referred t0...1 would
never have had anything to do with it," said Alito, who
listed his membership in the group on a 1985 job applica
tion for the Reagan administration but now says he does
not recall anything about it.
Outside the committee room, Kennedy was scathing.
"He can remember all 67 dissents...in great details,"
he said of Alito and his judicial record. "But he can't re
member anything about this organization."
