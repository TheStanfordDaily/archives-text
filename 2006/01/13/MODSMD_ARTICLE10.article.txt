# The 						MOAH the Better
## Museum of American Heritage home to an array of vintage collectibles 
### AMIN EL GAMAL 
The entrance to the Museum of Ameri
can Heritage (MOAH) is so inconspicuous,
a newcomer would probably just march
right past it. There's no giant glass pyramid
or fountain like at the Louvre — merely a
humble sign with the museum's innovative
logo.
If anything, the sight of Nintendo-age
children racing through a yellowing Monop
oly set that dates back to their great-grand
parents clues patrons into the past-meets-fu
ture ideology that fuels MOAH.
"We're trying to illuminate the tech of the
past in the expectation that we'll inspire fu
ture inventors and technologists and scien
tists," says MOAN Vice Chairman and Mar
keting Director Robert Katzive.
Located on Homer Street in Palo Alto,
the museum's historic Victorian building was
once home to Thomas Williams, a Stanford
alumnus and founder of Palo Alto's first
medical center.
ITie museum's permanent exhibits, how
ever, are largely attributable to the personal
collection of its founder Frank Livermore,

who passed away in 2000. Livermore's foray
into a junk shop in the 1960s inspired his col
lection of hundreds of vintage mechanisms,
and he set out to establish a museum follow
ing the suggestive jests of friends.
MOAU's current exhibit "Construction
Toys in Motion" incorporates world
renowned items with a dazzlingly compre
hensive display of local collectors' pieces.
The "Vintage Board Games and Puzzle"
showcase hosts Milton Bradley's original
confections, from Candyland (1949) to the
Game of Life (1960). A well-lit glass case of
Monopoly variations presents a Stanfor
dopoly.in which a library fine is chief punish
ment. Also present are the ancestors of
Chutes and Ladders — the lithographed
Gettysburg reenactment and ITie Knapp
Electric Ouestioner, believed to be the first
electric game.
Other exhibitions include a chess room,
garnished with chess sets from India — the
game's homeland — to Turkey. Egypt, China
and the United Kingdom. TTiere's also a col
lection of puzzles — once considered educa
tional tools for the rich — one of which is a
piece-by-piece chronology of English history.
Aside form its tri-yearly rotation of main

exhibits, MOAH has preserved the Williams'
house with vintage items including the
Wedgewood stove and cooler in the kitchen,
an extensive array of archives in the library,
vintage potholders with contemporary ad
vertising slogans and a laboratory in the
place of Williams' physician clinic.
Additionally, part of the permanent ex
hibit is a collection of cameras in the house's
medical wing. Inundated with tiny disguised
spy cameras (a la 007), tacky Coca-Cola and
a massive turn-of-the-century professional
camera, the display features a model used in
the film Roman I loliday (1953).
Besides its world-class exhibits, the muse
um offers approachable courses covering the
fundamentals of electronics through inte
grated circuits. The instructors use a curricu
lum based almost entirely on technological
ly focused programs.
"We're trying to demystify technology so
people | have | some understanding of what
goes on behind the panel when you Hick the
switch," Katzive says.
The museum also has traveling exhibits
and small displays, affectionately dubbed
"Mini MOAII," which find homes across
Palo Alto, including at University Avenue's

Borders bookstore.
With a volunteer corps of more than 500
people, the museum provides a wealth of op
portunities, be it working in the printing
press to create the MOAII Update publica
tion.greeting visitors, plowing the gardens or
teaching.
"[For] every conceivable interest, there's
some slot within the museum where a volun
teer may be interested." Katzive says. "Vol
unteers and stall are very enthusiastic and
knowledgeable —just a joy to be around."
Ilie museum's exhibit committee has
worked successfully around the city's "his
toric house" policies, one of which prohibits
inserting nails into the walls of historic sites.
"It's a bit if a ballet dance to put on an ef
fective exhibit and keep the spirit of the
[building] as a historic property," Katzive
says. "I'm a bit prejudiced, but we have su
perb exhibit designers."
It is said that one can spend months sur
veying the I .ouvre's massive exhibitions, but,
through the vibrant community that the
quaint MOAI I encourages,one could easily
invest a lifetime. Undoubtedly, MOAII's
dedication to the past and commitment to
the future will outlive even that.
