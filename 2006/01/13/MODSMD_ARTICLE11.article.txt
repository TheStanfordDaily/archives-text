# One Fish, Two Fish, See Fish, Eat Fish

Did you know that the average depth of
the San Francisco Bay is only 12 feet? Or that
the copepod is the most numerous animal on
earth? How about that shark liver is a good
source of Vitamin A?
In a Stanford student's natural habitat —
dominated by assignments and schedules —
the only local wildlife most encounter are
black squirrels and ants in dorm kitchenettes.
Looking to answer a real call of the wild. I
decided to head to Pier 39's Aquarium of the
Bay in San Francisco to get acquainted with
some of the city's local marine life.
This aquarium differs from most others in
that rather than just showing exotic fish, its
main purpose is to exhibit the aquatic
denizens of the San Francisco Bay.
Ascending an escalator into the first room
of the aquarium. I see not only two tanks
housing leopard sharks,stingrays and halibut,
but also displays with information about food
chains and restoration projects in the Bay.
Sound boring? Just wait. In the next room.
I enter an elevator, joining a tour guide. She
presses the down button and tells me we are
now descending three stories into a block
long tank with 707.000 gallons of water in it.
I step out into a glass tunnel that winds
through the water. A 13-foot sturgeon stares

me in the face and a school of anchovies rush
es over my head. I look down to find that I am
on a slow-moving ramp.
While I fear an earthquake could quickly
destroy the barrier between the fish and me, I
learn that the Aquarium of the Bay is the
most quake-proof building in San Francisco.
This safety reassurance,along with the sooth
ing jazz music in the background and opaque
lighting, makes me consider exploiting the
aquarium's romantic ambiance fora date.
I continue my walk through the tank.guid
ed the whole time by descriptions of the ani
mals and fun fishy facts. After making friends
with the rockfish, sea anemones and electric
rays. I take the elevator back up to the "Touch
the Bay" part of the aquarium, where I'm al
lowed to touch the leopard sharks and skates.
The next exhibit — "Save the Bay" — de
scribes ways people can help protect the Bay
and provides a chart of seafood that is envi
ronmentally friendly.
Yum. seafood. Call me cold-hearted, but
after looking at that chart I m dying for some
thing fishy. Luckily, I have lots of excellent
restaurant choices since the Aquarium of the
Bay is on Pier 39.1 end up at the Pier Market,
owned by Warren Simmons who founded and
built Pier 39.
At this restaurant — known for its clam
chowder and huge fish grill — I grab a seat
overlooking the Bav. 1 order some wild

salmon and enjoy reading the history ol the
restaurant on my placemat. Pier Market has
reasonable prices, good service and parking
validation.
If an aquarium brings out the kid in you.
walk down the pier and take a ride on the
Merry-Go -Round or check out a puppet

show. Pier 39 is
bustling with people
and shops, and al
though you have to
dodge hordes of
tourists, there are tons
of different places to
stop into. I window
shop down to the end of
the Pier, where I get a
great view of Alcatraz
and contemplate my new
knowledge of the Bay.
The verdict: Pier
3 l )'s Aquarium of the
Bay isn't huge, but it
does an excellent
job of familiarizing j
tourists and locals
with the native sea
life and offers a
spectacular

under-thc-water experience. II you don't
have time to make a trip down to Monterrey's
famous aquarium, this San Francisco jewel
not only provides a similarly enjoyable expe
rience. but also boasts a great location for an
after-aquarium dinner or walk along Pier 3^.
