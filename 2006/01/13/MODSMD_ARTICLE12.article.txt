## Editorial Course Guide's future? 
### 
The Course Guide system has long
been in a state of disrepair. The guide
has been updated rarely and few of
the listings actually provided insight into
classes. A number of changes are necessary'
to create a site that students can use effec
tively to choose courses.
We raised some of these concerns in an
editorial last quarter ("Course evaluations
should be online," Oct. 31, 2(K)5). We are
thrilled to see,that some of our suggestions
have been heeded. Transferring the Course
Guide from the ASSU to the University
Registrar, coupled with several significant
changes in the course evaluation system, of
fers reason for optimism for the future of the
Course Guide.
Currently, the ASSU's guide has suspend
ed updates while the University works to
create its own online course evaluation sys
tem. Outside consultants made recommen
dations. and the results of this process will
become apparent in coming weeks as the
new system is unveiled. The University's
new site will allow evaluations to be submit
ted online, facilitating quicker processing of
these evaluations and decreased costs.
While comments may not be included in the
course evaluations during the University's
first year of implementation — a point that
certainly raises concern — we are encour

aged by long-term efforts to ensure full feed
back for classes in the future.
We would also like to emphasize one
point that may get lost in the shuffle. Hon
esty and a degree of independence will be
key if students are ever to trust the new
guide. Professors will probably hate a
Course Guide that lists every comment from
every disgruntled student, but if those don't
appear, the guide will be useless.
Hopefully, this transition will live up to its
potential. We recommend once more that
the University consider making course eval
uations a mandatory requirement to access
grades, especially since the new online sub
mission process fosters ease of completing
course evaluations. Further, University cen
tralization now allows tighter integration be
tween the course evaluations system and
Axess, so the evaluations can more accurate
ly reflect grade distributions in classes. We
encourage a move toward this as the system
is developed. While patience is necessary,
continued pressure and monitoring is vital if
we are to witness real improvements to
Course Guide.
This new move is a step in the right direc
tion but we urge students and faculty to con
tinue to demand improvements in a system
that can become an important part of Stan
ford academic life.
