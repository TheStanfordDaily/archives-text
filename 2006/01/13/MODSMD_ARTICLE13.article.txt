# Homo for the holidays
## 
### 
Now that the holiday break is over, I
can give you all a recap of the recent
events in my life. You've missed me,
yes? (Please only answer that question if the
answer is "yes." Otherwise, assume it was
rhetorical.)
1 finished fall quarter with both my goals
accomplished: 1 passed all my classes, and I
didn't torch the University. Overall. I'd say it
was a smashing success!
During finals week. 1 was able to sneak
away to San Francisco to see the latest cow
boy-on-cowboy romance. "Brokeback
Mountain." I was interested in seeing the
film for the usual reasons: it's been reviewed
as an epic saga with Oscar-worthy perform
ances; the mainstream breakthrough of a
gay romance with two well-known Holly
wood celebrities is significant; and. of course,
to see a little Heath-on-Jake action.
Overall, the film met my expectations
and aroused me in several ways. While it's
definitely not a "happy" movie. I'd encour
age everyone to see it, for the emotional cli
max. And bring lots of tissues. You might cry.
among other things.
However, on a more personal level. I was
interested in seeing how the film depicted
being gay in the "Wild West." I grew up in
Montana, and while my experience was not
that of a lonesome cowboy (more like an
awkward Indian), I grew up in a small moun
tain town and was to travel to Laramie, Wvo.
for winter break to visit my extended family.
Cut to me arriving in Wyoming for break
expecting to see gay cowboys galore, and
finding out that my family, perhaps the most
liberal house in Laramie, hadn't even heard
of the movie, nor was it playing at the local
theater. I was shocked to discover that my
über-liberal 22-year-old cousin, who is a sen
ior at the University of Wyoming, had no
clue what I was talking about when I made
mention of Heath and Jake falling in love on
the big (or at least average) screen.
From the conversations that I've had with
my family, they don't particularly like the
way that Laramie has been portrayed as the
anti-gay capital of America in light of the
1998 slaying of Matthew Shepherd.Their ar
gument is true: Homophobia needs to be ad

dressed everywhere, not just in Laramie, and
the hateful act of a smali group does not re
flect the way that the community is support
ive of gay rights and equality.
However, 1 can't help but think an oppor
tunity was missed. How is this film supposed
to have an impact when it's not even playing
in the place where it's supposed to take
place? How is America supposed to con
front gay stereotypes when such accounts of
gay life aren't visible to them either in their
day-to-day reality or through such films?
This troubles me deeply. If we're left to let
"Will and Grace" portray the gay communi
ty, then we might as well abandon any hope
that the diversity of queer lifestyles will be
understood bv the red states. Furthermore. I
find it disappointing that many of the film's
creators, including the director, cast it off as
an "epic love story" instead of a "gay cow
boy" movie. Shouldn't gay cowboys be al
lowed to have a movie? What's so bad with
that? If I was a gay cowboy, I'd be offended.
Thankfully I'm just a gay Indian.
My experience growing up in Montana
was true to the "Brokeback" story in many
ways (unfortunately, not in the ways that
were portrayed in dim light within a tent).
Gay people are everywhere and we do fall in
love. What's more, our mannerisms and be
haviors are not limited to the stereotypical
depictions that are seen most often in popu
lar media, and our sexuality is not something
to be subordinated from the other aspects
our lives.

Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger are wel
comed to e-mail Adam at badwound@stan
ford.edu to incorporate a Native American
perspective into the sequel. Nightly rehearsals
can begin immediately.
