# Maybe Hemingway isn't so inspiring
## 
### 
I got nothing to say. That might surprise
you, considering I just got hack from
abroad. Surely I had some life-altering
experiences that will shape my future happi
ness. Or maybe it was a cultural encounter
that opened my mind to a new way of think
ing about the world. At the very least. 1 have
some really precious memories that 1 would
n't trade for the world, right?
Not really.
If you read this column this the fall, you
might have noticed a few themes that ran
throughout. Chief among them was that
substance abuse is fun. but ultimately leads
to bad choices (e.g. trying to jump over
stuff, vomiting, putting on stupid foreign ac
cents, more vomiting, hangovers, pissing off
Overseas Studies, pissing off Ujamaa, and
pissing off Murray)- Much of my inspiration
for this approach to the junior year abroad
came from"The Sun Also Rises," Heming
way's classic tale of a bunch of American
ex-patriots who run around Europe drink
ing. having sex and generally being assholes
to each other. The book is largely modeled
after Hemingway's own experiences in Eu
rope after World War I.and so I figured im
itating my favorite author wasn't a bad
tack.
I guess the phrase "cautionary tale" was
not in my vocabulary. Only now. five weeks
removed from the Continent, do I realize
how much I missed the point. I began to get
an inkling halfway through the quarter,
when a friend of mine visiting from Oxford
asked simply, "Do you think Hemingway

would approve of you?" At the time 1
laughed and thought nothing more of it. but
as the weeks wore on. I began to ask myself
the same question.
I recognized to some extent the ridicu
lousness of my antics, and justified them as an
exercise in 1920s moral excess. "This is a rite
of passage," 1 told myself, "a moral wasteland
that will give rise to an intellectual awaken
ing down the line." Well, that reawakening
has been slow in coming, and the void has
been filled mainly with regret.
I'm not going to say I wasted my time
abroad; living in Europe, no matter how
much you drink, can never really be dis
missed as a waste. My travels definitely gave
me some insights into Continental thinking.
And merely living in another society and try
ing to fit in is a valuable experience in itself.
But did 1 grow as a person? Besides an en
larged liver, not so much. At the time. I
thought living abroad had given me some
newfound confidence, when in reality it was
merely booze-fueled bravado.
On the other hand, the ability of the
quarter abroad to really change students is

overstated. No Stanford students in Berlin,
and no one I've talked to elsewhere, came
away from the fall feeling fundamentally
different. In"The Sun Also Rises," Jack
Barnes tries to dissuade an idealistic friend
from setting off for South America, telling
him, "You can't get away from yourself by
moving from one place to another. There's
nothing to that."
Perhaps we ask too much of Europe in
the first place. I've been hanging around
this planet for 20 years, so how much can 90
days eating bratwurst and going to muse
ums really alter my world perspective? It
can't. And while 1 could have been more
proactive in trying to seek out new chal
lenges and encounters, maybe I'm beating
myself up over something that would have
turned out the same.
In the end, I think I have some vague
sense that going abroad was a good idea, but
the actual reason eludes me now. Perhaps
it's one of those experiences that will gain
meaning the more distance I get from it. like
my first newspaper article or the time I shot
Harrison Ford in the face with a paintball
gun (story available upon request). Or
maybe it will be another forgettable chapter
in my life, like a bad girlfriend or Sopho
more College. Only time will tell, but let's
hope for the former.

few pops), e-mail David at dherbert@stan
