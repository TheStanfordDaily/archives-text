We've devoted a quarter's worth of
columns to Stanford's athletes, in one
form or another. We've unabashedly
detailed their eating habits, modes of trans
portation and defining physical characteristics,
and we certainly haven't been shy about snark
ily exploiting various trite and partially-found
ed stereotypes.
We realize with chagrin, however, that
we've been completely remiss in paying our re
spects to the true players, the ones without
whom Cardinal athletes probably wouldn't be
the superstars we make fun of today. The driv
ing force behind the Stanford sports jugger
naut. Not the parents. No, not the coaches ei
ther. No, folks, today we pay our humble trib
ute to everyone's favorite variety of fan (and.
we're guessing,our own most avid readers): the
jersey chasers.
You know 'em. The sly minxes who become
friends with the Dollies just so they have an ex
cuse to stand closer to the court. Who make
scandalous alterations to their Stanford Store
purchases and sneak cardboard "Chris Her
nandez. Marry me!!!!" signs into the game.The
fanatics whose little black books are organized
alphabetically by sport: baseball, basketball.

football, water polo.
Jersey chasers are a diverse breed, and it's
hard to describe them in any one particular
fashion. Every college has them, although cer
tain characteristics may change based on cul
tural surroundings (at Berkeley, for example,
the little black books may be organized alpha
betically by sport: basketball, baseball, foot
ball, water polo.)
Average age is from 12 to 24. but jersey
chasers really range from those little girls
whose parents dress them up in baby Cardinal
cheerleader outfits to grandmothers (perhaps
even yours?) who'd trade their false teeth and
winning bingo cards in for an afternoon with
their favorite water polo player.
Still not clear on who we're talking about?

We suspect you are. but just in case, let's delve
a little deeper and refresh your memory. The
jersey chaser begins each quarter by scouring
CioStanford.com for fresh meat on the rosters.
Once they have picked their favorites, they
pick their classes, is so-and-so an Econ major?
Poli Sci? Sociology? Make full use of Axess
and the shopping period and they're likely to
hit at least one class with their favorite sweaty
stud. But shared class time is just the beginning.
Truly adept jc's (a.k.a. stalkers) have already
spent hours reading player hios. allowing them
to casually work key hometowns, parents'
names and favorite foods into that first conver
sation.
If you've noticed a disturbingly un-PC trend
that most of our traits thus far describe the
chicks more than the fellas, you're right. But
just wait a moment. If we were really narrow
minded, we would have used the older, more
established, and dare-we-say more descriptive
term "jock-sniffers." But this is an equal op
portunity column. Your enlightened writers
recognize that guys are just as capable at ogling
and obsessing — they just tend to do it in a
slightly different manner. Ibe male jersey
chaser may limit his public displays of fanati

cism to husky grunts and chauvinistic com
ments, hut don't let his cool attitude fool you.
The thing he'll never let anyone else know is
that in the back shelf of his closet is a shrine de
voted to his favorite athletic hottie, complete
with candles, voodoo dolls,and a headshot that
has seen his lips so many times that the ink is
starting to fade. Sound like someone you
know? A friend of yours, maybe? Perhaps even
you? We thought so.
We hope we haven't made you uncomfort
able with our eerie knowledge of your stalking
habits. Like we said, this column isn't a roast...
it's a tribute. Please don't be concerned - it's ok
if the bench outside Mirrielees is your favorite
place to people watch. So what if you're begin
ning to rather enjoy your sunrise walks from
KA. We won't judge you if you might have
taken EDGE when you didn t need the units.
Just remember, ladies and gentlemen, that you
too play a role in athletic success. Embrace
your obsession! You should be proud of your
selves.

As far as we 're concerned, you can chase our jer
seys any day. E-mail ckrug@stanford.edu and
