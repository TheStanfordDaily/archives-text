## Fourth-ranked visitors overwhelmingly favored BOUNCING BACK 
### DENIS GRIFFIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford wrestlers have a golden opportunity to
prove their mettle with the challenge they face this
weekend. In the squad's home opener this Sunday, the
Cardinal are scheduled to square off against No. 4 Illi
nois at 1 p.m. at Burnham Pavilion.
With the tournament portion of the season behind
them, the Cardinal (3-2) now face the heart of their
schedule as the dual meet season gets underway. Be
ginning Sunday against Illinois, the team is set to com
pete in 10 dual meets over the next month. According
to Stanford head coach Kerry McCoy, the team is in a
good position to succeed.
"There's a slight drop-off after the winter break,
and that's something we want to do," McCoy said. "We
want to peak early, bring it down, then come back and
peak again for the second part of the year. The guys
are ready to start building their peak and that's right
where we need them to be."
As for facing the highly-touted Fighting I Mini (1-0)
this Sunday, McCoy stressed that his wrestlers could
n't be preoccupied with their opponents.
"We're just going tocontinue to focus on doing the
things that we do," McCoy said. "The worst thing to do
