# One billion raised
## CUE SURPASSES GOAL 
### CASSIE HARVEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A five-year campaign to raise $1 billion for Stanford
undergraduate education ended Dec. 31, with a total of
more than $1.1 billion. At the start of the new year came
an atmosphere of victory and excitement as Stanford of
ficials and campaign workers scuttled to issue press re
leases while paying gratitude to campaign donors and
volunteers.
The five-year, billion-dollar Campaign for Under
graduate Education (CUE) was launched by University
President John Hennessy at his inauguration in 2000. Di
rector of Development John Ford said that a primary
goal of the campaign was to sustain programs that had
been previously developed.
These programs include, among others, Stanford's
Freshman and Sophomore Introductory Seminars, the
Introduction to Humanities courses, the Summer Re
search College and Sophomore College.
According to Vice Provost for Undergraduate Edu
cation John Bravman, even though current undergradu
ates might consider these programs indelible features of
the Stanford curriculum, they were all implemented in
the last decade.
The programs grew out of recommendations made in
a 1994 commission report on undergraduate education.
The commission, authorized by former Stanford Presi
dent Gerhard Casper, was part of an effort to improve and
revitalize Stanford's undergraduate program.
According to a report written by the Stanford News
Service, Casper charged the commission to "review the
undergraduate curriculum and related programs with

regard to the changing needs and
expectations of our students and
their families, the emerging oppor
tunities and challenges of the 21st
century, and the unique strengths
and resources of Stanford Universi
ty."
Tim Portwood, director of Uni
versity campaigns, called the ideas
given in the report "compelling."
"The report," he said, "[repre
sented] ways of re-thinking under
graduate education."
According to Ford, pilot pro
grams, made possible by the gener
ous contributions from the Bing
family, followed shortly after the re
lease of the report. The pilot pro
grams were successful, garnering
wide-spread support and popularity
among students and faculty.
Maintaining these programs in
the future, however, would require
sources of long-term funding, which
is where the idea of a campaign for
undergraduate education came into
play.
"The Stanford Fund year in and
year out solicits Stanford under
graduate alumni and parents of cur
rent Stanford students for gifts,"
Ford said. "But these gifts are ex
pendable, which means they go to all
undergraduate purposes." Ford also
noted that gifts given through the
Stanford Fund tend to be used up
within the year.
CUE sought to supplement an
nual Stanford donations with a per
manent endowment for undergrad
uate education. According to
CUE's Web site, the campaign was
intended to raise money for four
goals — $300 million for under
graduate education programs, $300
million for endowed scholarships
($250 million for need-based schol
arships and $50 million for athletic
scholarships), $100 million for the
Stanford Fund and $300 million to
support the full-range of University
offerings.
"The message of CUE resonat
ed well with alumni, parents and
others who cared deeply about un
dergraduate education," Portwood
said. "When President Hennessy
announced CUE the campaign al
ready had $429 million in commit
ments."
CUE targeted Stanford under
graduate alumni and parents of cur
rent undergraduates for contribu
tions — a population of approxi
mately 80,000. according to Ford.
The precise amount raised by CUE
will not be known for about another
month, but Ford believes that figure
will be over $1.1 billion.
"This is the most money that I
know of that's ever been raised sole
ly for undergraduate education in
any institution in the country," Ford
said. Portwood confirmed that Stan
ford's CUE is. in fact, "the largest
campaign ever launched exclusively
for undergraduate education."
Portwood attributed the success
of CUE, in part, to the hard work
and dedication of everyone involved
in the fundraising, calling it a "team

effort."
CUE exceeded the goals it set out
to reach in all four categories. Ac
cording to figures given in the offi
cial CUE press release, more than
$301 million has been raised for the
endowment for undergraduate edu
cation. $302 million for endowed
scholarships, $107 million in annual
giving to the Stanford Fund and $3<SO
million to support University-wide
programs. The press release also

noted that 300 new need-based
scholarships and 103 new athletic
scholarships have been created as a
result of CUE.
Hennessy wrote in his message
from the president on CUE's Web
site that "Because of new scholar
ship funding Stanford's commitment
to need-blind admission has never
been stronger. Every student is sur
rounded by the most challenging and
inspiring classmates possible."
