### ANDREW LOMELI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a disappointing eighth place finish
at the UC-Santa Barbara Elephant Bar tour
nament last weekend, the No. 15 men's vol
leyball team is set to open conference play in
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation this
weekend.Today's visit to defending national
champion Pepperdine precedes a Saturday
trip to Southern California.
Associate head coach John Kosty said the
team will look to put the past aside as it
heads into league play He added that the

senior class' leadership has helped the team
refocus.
"It's their last year, so they do put pres
sure on themselves and on the entire team to
get better every day," Kosty said. "They al
ways have a very positive outlook on the sea
son, and they look at it one match at a time.
Iliey know how to learn from their mistakes
and move on."
Me added that the talent of the freshman
class complements the seniors' guidance
well.
"It's a great recruiting class," Kosty said.
"They're all doing a great job at practice, and
they're pushing the seniors. Iliat's what you
always look for in underclassmen — the
ability to push the older guys and compete
for those spots, which they're doing a great

job with right now."
The Cardinal (1-3) visit No. 3 Pepperdine
tonight. Stanford dropped both matches to
the Waves last season, each by identical 3-1
margins. Pepperdine enters its season open
er after having graduated several key mem
bers of last season's championship team.
Kosty said Pepperdine's inexperience
could be the difference in what figures to be
a close contest.
"Pepperdine is a good team, but they're
not yet at the caliber of a national champi
on," he said."We'll see at the end of the year
who the national champion will be,but light
now. we're all on a pretty similar base."
Stanford then travels to Southern Cali
fornia tomorrow night. The Cardinal swept
last season's two-match series against the

Trojans, who have finished 11th in the 12-
teani MPSF conference the past four sea
sons. USC (1-2) returns three starters from
last year's disappointing campaign but adds
the nation's top recruit in freshman opposite
hitter C.J. Schellenberg.
USC outside hitter Joao Grangeiro led
the team in kills (319), digs (244) and aces
(44) last season. Setter Jimmy killian con
trols the Itojans' attack, registering a team
best 1 )<S() assists in 2005. Meanwhile, the Car
dinal will have to improve upon their most
recent performances and concentrate on
their own attack in order to win.
"Both matches are winnable," Kostysaid.
"I think it's going to be a good weekend for
us. We're looking to come out of the week
end with two big league wins."
