## Surviving the frosh dorm snow trip 
### 
Welcome back to winter quarter
on the Farm, filled with rainy
days, baggy sweaters, and peo
ple dying to get off campus at any cost.
Fortunately, that cost is reasonably low
at the beginning of the quarter, as nearly
every house or dorm on campus takes off
fora weekend for Stanford's traditional
"snow trip." (Remember now, it's not po
litically correct to call it a ski trip — those
who don't ski will have their feelings hurt!)
However, as much fun as Bode Miller
makes drinking at altitude out to be, this
guy knows from personal experience that
there are certain do's and don'ts that, if
followed, can greatly improve your
chances of avoiding coming back to cam
pus Sonny Bono style. Here's Andrew's
guide to a successful snow weekend.
The first thing to do, of course, will be
to procure your spot in the cabin. While it
is fun to be cozy with your 60 closest
friends, that doesn't mean you want to be
the guy stuck sharing a Papasan chair
with the offensive lineman from two
doors down or the girl who shares a futon
with the kid who considers body odor to
be an expression of art and love.
You're going to need to team up with
a few people you are cool with (read:
have absolutely no qualms about types of
intimate contact most frequently seen in
a soft-core porn... but hey, maybe you al
ready have broken the dormcest seal)
and stake out a sleeping space.
Unless you're willing to sit in the first
five rows of the bus, next to the RAs and
RFs, forget getting a bed. Just focus on
marking off a space on the floor big
enough to assume the fetal position in
and lay it down. You can always cover
yourself with your friends. Remember,
the best cure for hypothermia is direct
body heat contact in a small space.
Now, let's address that drinking at alti
tude thing. Because our freshmen are un
derage, alcohol is no longer allowed in
freshman-only gatherings, so just take
what 1 say here and do it behind closed
doors, where I'm sure it's much safer.
Drinking at altitude is a risky proposi
tion. A beer at 5,000 feet feels more like a
Long Island Iced Tea because it sticks in
the system longer. Talk about a "Rocky
Mountain I ligh."
I love being a cheap date and getting
hammered off of two shots of Mad Dog
20/20, but keep in mind that everyone's
tolerance is going to be lower. The word
"shotgun" should never come out of your
mouth, lest something else more solid
quickly follow it. Remember: yellow
snow is sometimes funny, brown chunky
snow never is.
And while you're drunk.it might seem
like a good idea to get in the hot tub. Hey,
let's not lie, it's a huge draw. You were
planning on it even when you were sober.
But now that you're gone like an Irish on
St. Patty's Day, it's a fantastic idea.
TWo pieces of advice spring to mind
here. First, use the hot tub the first night,
before the inevitable hooking up ensues.
Hot water kills a lot, but it can't touch that
disgusting feeling in the back of your
mind. In addition, you get to be there be
fore the water level drops to below your
ankles because of all the splashing and
overcrowding. Not that keeping your feet
warm is a bad thing.
The second piece of advice is to not be
"that guy." The guy who has had so much
whiskey that he's officially changed his
name to Jack/Hie guy who feels so unin
hibited from the lack of oxygen that he
sheds all inhibitions...including his
bathing suit. Trust me. if you're that drunk,
you're not that attractive and it's not
going to work anyway. Keep the pants on.
Assuming that you can shake off the
hangover the next day and get your ass to
the slopes sometime before the lifts close,
remember to try and ski/snowboard/tube
within your limits.
Those little symbols on the signs mean
something. Generally speaking, the more
points the shape representing the run has.
the better chance you have of injuring
yourself.
Seriously, when was the last time a cir
cle broke your leg? If you describe your
skiing style in terms of food (pizza, french
fries etc.), maybe you're better off chilling
at the lodge with the food. Or better yet,
take a lesson
ITie ski instructors are easy to find.
They're the ones in the bright, ugly jack
ets who think they are gods. Now excuse
me, I have a mogul class to go teach.

black diamond. Disagree? E mail
