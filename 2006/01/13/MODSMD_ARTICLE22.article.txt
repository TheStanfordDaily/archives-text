# [We'll] do what we do every day. KRISTEN SMYTH, head coach
## Opening at home, with ease Stanford appears primed for victory against in-state foes 
### JUSTINA GRAYMAN 
ITie crowd, the floor music, the screaming team
mates — every gymnast knows the sweet sounds of
home.
At 2 p.m. on Sunday, the No. 3 women's gymnas
tics team opens its home season against San Jose
State University, UC-Davis and Sacramento State.
Because the opponents are not highly rated, the
team plans to forego potentially risky and larger
stunts in favor of more conservative routines such as
triple series on beam and double back dismounts.
While UC Davis is unranked — perhaps because
the squad has yet to compete this season — San Jose
State is ranked 24th and Sacramento State is right
behind at 25th.
"At vault, [we have] six strong 10.0 vaults," said
Stanford head coach Kristen Smyth, whose squad
placed second to Georgia at the Cancun Classic on
Jan. 6.
Stanford features two gymnasts ranked in the top
three nationally — sophomore LizTricase is ranked
second in the bars, and senior Glyn Sweets is ranked
third on the vault.
Depth is certainly a strength of this Cardinal
squad, and senior Natalie Foley is a prime example,
placing in the top-five of three events in Cancun and
also achieving third (38.975) in the all-around. Fur
ther, all of the starters from last year return, as well
as sophomore Tabitha Yim, who placed third on
floor in the NCAA Event Finals last season with a
9.925 and scored a season-high 39.45 in the all
around.
Uneven bars is also strength for Stanford, who
has 12 top-level gymnasts. Even balance beam has
depth, with Yim and Foley at the forefront and fresh
man Kelly Fee coming on strong in Cancun.

No. 24 San Jose State achieved a team score of
188.45 at the Cal State Fullerton meet.The Spartans
were led by sophomore Michelle Nlinotti, who
earned third in vault (9.8) and second in the all
around and junior Raylyn Cardemo, who came in
second (9.825) in vault.
This Sunday, the Spartans have a chance to recov
er from a crushing performance on beam, where
they earned a 45.4 team score with only one gymnast
topping 9.4. But the potential is there, as the team
notched a 49.025 last season in beam.
Top returnees on this team include Minotti, who
scored season highs of at least 9.825 in three events
last year and junior Greta Leach, who placed third at
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Champi
onships in the all-around last year with a season-high
of 39.175.
In its season-opener, Sacramento State was not
dragged down by any event in particular, but was rel
egated to sixth place (188.75). Indeed, the team fea
tures just one all-around competitor — senior
Kimiye Narasaki.
The only two competitors to crack the top 10 in
individual events were senior Trista Condren and
sophomore Alexis Tsurumoto.
Narasaki s relatively strong performance in the
all-around, highlighted by a season-high of 39.025,
has proven to be a saving grace.
UC-Davis rounds out the competition this week
end. Last year, the Aggies averaged a 190.057 with a
high of 193.225.
Similarly to San Jose State, balance beam is also a
weak event for the Aggies, who averaged only 46.961
in the event last season.Top returnees include soph
omore Michelle Kulovotz and junior Julia Richards,
who topped 9.8 on floor in four of her last seven
meets.
Depth could certainly be a key factor in the out
come of Sunday's meet, and the Cardinal seem to
have the advantage. But Smyth has a simple way of
conveying what the gymnasts must do be successful
and that's "to do what we do everydav in the gym."
