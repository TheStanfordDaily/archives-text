Though the identity of the 2006 Commence
ment speaker will remain confidential until he or
she is confirmed, the secrecy of the selection
process has not prevented intense speculation and
student enthusiasm for particular selections.
Students were allowed to vote fora speaker on
line. The class presidents coordinated a Web page
with an open-ended forum allowing students to
write paragraphs about who they wanted as a
speaker and why. Many seniors said they ap
proved of the format.
"1 guess a Web site where everyone can nomi
nate people is a fair way, because everyone gets his
say," said senior Sarah Espinosa."! can't personal
ly think of a better way,so I'm going to say it was a
pretty good idea. I wish I knew more about how it
gets narrowed down though."
When choosing the speaker, the senior class
presidents worked with the President's Office.
Associate Vice President and Director of Uni
versity Communications Alan Acosta noted the
difficulties involved in choosing a speaker.
"The logistics involving choosing a person who
is both available and interested in taking on the de
manding responsibility of speaking at a Com
mencement ceremony are complex," he said. "For

that reason, we do not say much during the
process."
Despite the absence of a confirmed speaker.stu
dents remained passionate about their suggestions.
"My serious suggestions were Larry Page and
Sergey Brin. plus Jon Stewart," Berring said. "The
Google guys are on top of the world right now and
have intimate Stanford connections. Jon is also in
fluential these days, and you know he would do a
good job."
Senior Jessica Feldman shared his view.
"I voted for Jon Stewart," she said. "I think he
is a blend of the intellect and witty humor that de
fines the Stanford kid, or at least has defined my
Stanford experience."
Political figures remained some of the most
popular choices for many students.
"My roommate and I were discussing qualities
we want in the speaker and we agreed that some
one from the political realm would be ideal since
this year has been so politically charged," Es
pinosa said. "Personally, I would like to see John
Roberts as the commencement speaker. I think
he's an incredibly intelligent and well-spoken man
who would have some worthwhile things to say."
Despite the popularity of political choices,
some students believed other traits like celebrity
and speaking ability were more important than

particular political per- !

spectives.
"With both Clin
ton and ,

Schwarzenegger,
it's the shock
value, rather
than themes-

sage I think
they'll deliver,

that makes 2
them attrac
tive speakers,"

Boone said.
"We'll make
CNN for sure and
add a memorable
moment to our

life stories."
"We want someone who will leave a lasting im
pression on the class and whose words will pro
voke new thoughts, discussions and approaches to
life as we attempt to become grown-ups." Es
pinosa said. "It would have to be someone who
knows how to speak and wouldn't bore us to tears.
Most importantly, it would have to be someone
relatively moderate so people of all political per
suasions would be comfortable and interested."
