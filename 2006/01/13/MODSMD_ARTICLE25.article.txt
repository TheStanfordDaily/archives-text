# Liberal art colleges offer students full-rides
## Merit-based aid attracts applicants 
### ADA YEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the quarter slowly lurches into
gear, many students return to cam
pus bearing stories of siblings or
friends who mailed off college appli
cations over the break.
Where will they choose to enroll
when admission letters arrive? A
New York Times article published
Jan. 1 reported that many students
are choosing private liberal arts col
leges over other options, and not just
for the small-school atmosphere.
They're drawn by merit-based finan
cial aid. something that more elite
schools — such as Stanford — do
not offer.
Stanford awarded students nearly
$60 million in need-based scholar
ships last year. About 46 percent of
Stanford students received such aid.
670 freshmen among them.
However, with the exception of
athletic awards, Stanford does not
fund merit-based scholarships.
As described by Hie New York
Times, pressure to compete with
more prestigious private universities
or more affordable public schools
has pushed mid-level private col

leges to offer top applicants special
treatment and full-ride scholarships.
High achievers beef up a school's
image, for example, by raising aver
age SAT scores.
According to Director of Finan
cial Aid Karen Cooper. Stanford's fi
nancial aid program has been 1 (K)
percent need-based since it was es
tablished in the 19505.
In 1995, Stanford launched the
President's Scholars Program, which
designated 200 "top" students upon
admission. While this program may
seem to resemble the merit-based
awards of other schools, these stu
dents did not receive any non-need
based aid towards tuition: they were
only guaranteed money for research
projects.
The ability to lure top students
isn't the only benefit attributed to
merit-based scholarships. It's been
suggested that merit-based aid helps
middle-class students who do not
quite qualify for need-based aid. yet
struggle with the large price tag at
tached to private education.
"We do worry a lot about those
students," Cooper said. "It's most
challenging for those whose calculat
ed family contribution is at $45,000.
What we expect is a significant sacri
fice, and some families aren't willing
or able to make it."
The Committee on IJndereradu

ate Admission and Financial Aid (C
-IJAFA), a body of Faculty Senate
members and undergraduate repre
sentatives, has discussed how to bet
ter address the needs of middle-class
students. According to C-UAFA re
ports, merit-based financial aid was
briefly considered during the 1999-
2000 school year.
"To my knowledge, Stanford has
never had a serious discussion of
merit aid," Cooper said. "Instead
we've done things like limiting the
home equity included in our need
calculation, and allowing outside
awards to replace the self-help. This
helps all students but helps those
from the middle income in greater
proportion."
Offering merit-aid would come at
the cost of need-based funds, Cooper
explained.
"It would definitely hurt our abil
ity to keep borrowing expectations
to a minimum." she said.
Although there are no precise sta
tistics on the distribution of income
levels at Stanford, Cooper said that
there is no significant drop-off for
any income group.
In the past. Cooper has been
called by students who face difficult
choices between Stanford and
schools that offer merit-based aid.
However, the calls are few. and
Cooper said that there is probably no

large loss of such students.
Many students agree that while
Stanford may lose some of their
peers to merit-based aid. large finan
cial aid packages can't compete with
the possibilities that Stanford has to
offer.
"The University of Washington
was willing to give me just about a
full ride in merit-based scholar
ships," said sophomore Daniel
Babinski."Also. McGill, in Montreal,
offered me a merit-based package
that made it very affordable. Howev
er. 1 feel that the advantages that a
Stanford diploma will bring me in
the job market outweigh the differ
ence in cost."
"There's a reason Stanford's so
expensive," echoed senior ChenLi
Wang. "The opportunities you get
are not the same."
The exception, several students
stated, is if a smaller school's atmos
phere simply fits a student's needs
better.
"If you can get a really good edu
cation at a small liberal arts college
and it's partially subsidized, who's to
say Williams or Vassar is any less
good than Stanford?" said sopho
more Iris Law.
Others said that financial aid is a
key factor when considering schools.
"Many students feel that a col
lege education is a college educa
tion no matter where you get it,"
said sophomore Rudy Rubio. "I
have friends like that now — they
don't care that they didn't go to a
better school. If it's more affordable
for them, they feel that the opportu
nities are going to be the same no
matter where they go."
Students also expressed concern

that middle-class students struggle
with college tuitions but questioned
the effectiveness of merit-based aid
as a solution.
"Merit-based scholarships
wouldn't necessarily go to those
middle-class students," said sopho
more Julie Kim.
The decision to pay a tuition like
Stanford's remains difficult. One
student who asked to remain anony
mous received a full-ride scholar
ship and guaranteed laboratory in
ternship from Caltech but decided
to come to Stanford anyway.
"My parents put a lot of pressure
on me to accept the offer, but obvi
ously I chose Stanford...l don't re
gret my decision, but even to this day
I do feel a lot of guilt for not taking
the scholarship."
Choosing between a full scholar
ship and a college like Stanford that
does not offer merit-based need re
mains a difficult choice.
"It's a tough decision to make,"
Cooper said. "It comes down to
where you're going to be happiest
and if you can maintain the require
ments fora merit-based scholar
ship."
