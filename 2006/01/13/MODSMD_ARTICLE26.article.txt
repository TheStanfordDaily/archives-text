# Obscure scholarships often left unclaimed
## 
### KELLEY FONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At colleges and universities across
the country, scholarship money is
available not only for students of aca
demic or athletic merit and financial
need, hut for students who happen to
fit unusual criteria, whether it is left
handedness or a particular last name.
"I never fit any of those," said
freshman Ellen Truxaw. "I heard
about one for students with blue eyes,
and I'm like.i have green eyes! No!'"
When Molly Weiss read that there
were scholarships for tall, short and
fat students, the 4' 11" freshman re
marked, "If there's a short people
scholarship, I don't know anyone bet
ter qualified than me!"
But what Truxaw and Weiss may
not know is that students at Stanford
do not apply or compete for specific
scholarships nor are such scholar
ships advertised to students.
Mary Morrison is the member of
the Office of Financial Aid who
matches students with scholarships.
"All scholarships at Stanford are
based on financial aid," she said.
"Everyone who gives money to Stan
ford has to say that it's fora needy stu
dent because that's the basis on which
we give money."
"We meet all the need of all the
students, so if you need $N.(XX), my job
is to find $B,(XX) for you that you qual
ify for, and give it to you," Morrison
added. "The students don't even
know about these [scholarships]. In
fact, there is no list published any
where — not that it's a secret, but no
one needs to know it."
According to Morrison, students
know they will receive the amount of
money they need and only later find
out that they have received a specific
scholarship.
She acknowledged that recipients
for some scholarships "are a little
harder to find than others."
Morrison cited several examples

of Stanford scholarships with specific
restrictions, including one intended
for male students from Alaska major
ing in earth sciences.
"We don't have many male stu
dents from Alaska, period "she said.
Every year. 2,5(X) undergraduates
take advantage of outside scholarships.
Junior and economics major Jessi
ca Richman received a scholarship
from the Financial Women's Associa
tion based in San Francisco.
"I was really surprised when 1 got
this scholarship." she said. "It fit my
goals and interests perfectly."
There are almost I,(XX) named
scholarships for Stanford students,
with the rest of the financial aid com
ing from The Stanford Fund.
"A lot of the scholarships have no
restrictions," Morrison said, "but
there are a considerable number that
do — students from public housing
projects, students interested in com
munity service, etc."
However. Morrison refuted the
notion that there are thousands and
millions of dollars in unclaimed schol
arships, calling it an "urban myth."
"No one actually can come up with
these scholarships," she added.
"There are some [unclaimed scholar
ships]. absolutely, but people over
state the case."
Fortunately, Morrison added, Sta
nford has enough other money that, for
those unusually restrictive scholar
ships, the University can afford to wait
for students to come along that fit the
scholarship's criteria.
One such scholarship is for girls
from California who do not smoke.
"Oftentimes we have a student work
er who's a female from California,
and I say,'Do you smoke?' and they
say no, so 1 give them the scholar
ship," said Morrison.
Some scholarships are steeped in
history.
"The first one was from Jane Stan
ford herself," Morrison added. "Le
land [Stanford, Jr.] had a savings ac
count when he died, and she [Jane
Stanford] used the money that he
had to establish the first scholarship,
the Leland Stanford Jr. Memorial
Scholarship fora young man. If you
read the terms of that, it's really
funny, because we have a right to
take away that person's scholarship if
they are found to be something like
'morally unfit.'They have these value
systems that we don't write anymore
in scholarships."
In addition to value judgments,
criteria for scholarships can some
times be vague.
"A lady in her will left us money
fora girl who's serious but not too se
rious." said Morrison. "Her money is
put into an endowment and the in
come every year I give to a girl who's
serious but not too serious. I get to de
cide that — that's my responsibility,
to decide who fits those criteria."
