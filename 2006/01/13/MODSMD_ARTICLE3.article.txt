# CAMPUS LIFE
## Bookstore sales thrive during the holidays Students buy Card apparel as gifts 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Due to a surge of students buy
ing gifts rather than textbooks, the
Stanford Bookstore ended its holi
day sales period successfully, post
ing a double-digit increase in in
come from the previous year. Gift
shopping by students made it again
the top non-academic-related sales
period for the store.
Store Director Ken Bowers, al
though unable to disclose exact fig
ures, said holiday sales were very
strong and can be attributed to two
main factors.
"Number one, generally I think
the economy is pretty good out
there in the private sector," Bowers
said. "And number two, the store's
been really making an effort to be
more attractive to students in terms
of sales."
Those efforts include special
promotions such as a Thursday stu
dent discount of 20 percent off all
clothing. The sale has proven to be a

large selling point.
"We've been seeing a steady in
crease in the amount of student traf
fic in the Bookstore, particularly on
Thursdays, but on other days as
well," Bowers said.
Freshman Kelley Fong took ad
vantage of the Thursday sales to buy
T-shirts for her little sisters back
home and items fora gift exchange
she had with high school friends
over the break.
"I knew I wouldn't have time
when I got back, so I thought it
would be easier to buy something
here so I wouldn't have to worry
about it later on," Fong said.
Aside from convenience, buying

Stanford gifts for family and friends
is a special way of sharing the Stan
ford experience.
"Those are always popular
things because students typically
take those home to brothers, sisters,
parents," Bowers said. "It's sort of a
natural, unique gift. You have your
life submerged in Stanford, being
everything you're about right now,
and taking something back is a real
popular thing to do."
Fong said she knew that Stanford
memorabilia made up the special
items she could give to her family
during Christmas.

Bookstore sales skyrocketed during the holiday season as a result of
students purchasing Stanford gifts.
"My sister had a wish list, but I
knew that a lot of the stuff on there
she could get herself or from other
people," she said." I knew no one else
could buy her a Stanford T-shirt."
Freshman Jenny Arriola also
decked out her family in Stanford
apparel and gave friends Stanford
gifts. Spending nearly $300 total, she
purchased four teddy bears, three
key chains, two polo shirts and two of
the traditional Stanford sweatshirts.
"It shows that you're proud of the
school you attend, and that other
people are too," Arriola said.
Fong's family displayed their
pride as well.
"My little sister wore her basket
ball t-shirt three days in a row," she
said.
Bowers noted that women's ap
parel was among the more popular
items this year, most likely because
of the shift the store is making from
unisex to more gender specific cloth
ing.
"Since 1 believe women are more
demanding in fit and style, we've

been trying to do more to satisfy
those customers, and it seems to be
paying off," he said.
Also popular this holiday season
was Nike-brand clothing, but the hot
item this season was definitely the
iPod.
"It helps to be close to Apple,"
Bowers said.
On many people's shopping lists
was the Bookstore's Stanford cow
promotion. In its 15th year, the tradi
tional stuffed animal was sought by
many, coming as a free gift to those
who spent over $100 at the Bookstore.
"People were just gaga over the
cow," Bowers said. "Our employees
enjoyed it too and it was just fun to
show to students and others."
The cow promotion began after
the Thanksgiving sales period, and
cows were available up until just a
few days before students left for win
ter break. Originally, the cow was not
to be available this year, but Bowers
changed employees' minds, and the
tradition will continue.
As for the future of other Book
store promotions, Bowers was
pleased to say the 20 percent student
discount on Thursdays will continue
to be a feature in the Bookstore's
campaign to attract students.
"As long as it is popular, as long as

it's as supported by the students as it
has been, we're going to continue
that," he said. "And we're going to
look for more ways that the store can
be more relevant and valuable to the
students."
Among future promotions is the
idea of bringing in computer experts
to help students with purchases.
Such resources are useful in attract
ing students to buy from the Book
store, since others share its market
— such as the student-run Stanford
Store. Arriola, however, did all her
shopping at the Bookstore.
"I went to the Stanford Book
store because the Stanford Store
lacked the variety in clothing appar
el," she said.
Bowers said he does not view the
student store as direct competition
because of its narrower purpose of
serving students and adding to the
ASSU's income. Greater competi
tion comes from online sellers —
however the Bookstore has its own
growing online market as well.
"It was very strong [this holiday
sales period] and probably more
than we were prepared for and high
er than we expected," Bowers said.
"That's a growing market, just be
cause it's so convenient to order
from home and have items shipped."
