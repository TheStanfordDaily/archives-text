## Bookstore sales thrive during the holidays Students buy Card apparel as gifts 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Due to a surge of students buy
ing gifts rather than textbooks, the
Stanford Bookstore ended its holi
day sales period successfully, post
ing a double-digit increase in in
come from the previous year. Gift
shopping by students made it again
the top non-academic-related sales
period for the store.
Store Director Ken Bowers, al
though unable to disclose exact fig
ures, said holiday sales were very
strong and can be attributed to two
main factors.
"Number one, generally I think
the economy is pretty good out
there in the private sector," Bowers
said. "And number two, the store's
been really making an effort to be
more attractive to students in terms
of sales."
Those efforts include special
promotions such as a Thursday stu
dent discount of 20 percent off all
clothing. The sale has proven to be a

large selling point.
"We've been seeing a steady in
crease in the amount of student traf
fic in the Bookstore, particularly on
Thursdays, but on other days as
well," Bowers said.
Freshman Kelley Fong took ad
vantage of the Thursday sales to buy
T-shirts for her little sisters back
home and items fora gift exchange
she had with high school friends
over the break.
"I knew I wouldn't have time
when I got back, so I thought it
would be easier to buy something
here so I wouldn't have to worry
about it later on," Fong said.
Aside from convenience, buying

Stanford gifts for family and friends
is a special way of sharing the Stan
ford experience.
"Those are always popular
things because students typically
take those home to brothers, sisters,
parents," Bowers said. "It's sort of a
natural, unique gift. You have your
life submerged in Stanford, being
everything you're about right now,
and taking something back is a real
popular thing to do."
Fong said she knew that Stanford
memorabilia made up the special
items she could give to her family
during Christmas.
