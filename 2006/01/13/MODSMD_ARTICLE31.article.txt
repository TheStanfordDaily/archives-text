We have been looking for
ward to 2006 for quite some time
now. Not only will we both be

able to legally imbibe alcohol,
but the changing of the

year allows us to put out
our very first "Best Of'
issue as editors. This

should be simple,
right? Give

our writers
general
cate-

gories
and let
'em go,
see
what
they

come
up with.
That's

sonal beliefs (like go
rent "Serenity"

and then possi-

the beauty of free speech,
right? Everyone has an
opinion, and what you
think the best movie of
the year was doesn't

necessarily have to
match up with ours.
That was until
..„

some of us disagreed
rather emphatically
with the opinions of
some of our writ
ers. Now, don't get

bly the entire
"Firefly" se
ries this
weekend)...
and we feel
like we've
grown as
people be
cause of this

us wrong, we love
our writers. All of
them. They are
wonderful. And

yet, reading Victor's
blasphemous slam against
'Serenity" caused one of us to

tense up ever so slightly. Don't
listen to him; "Serenity" was a

kick-ass movie and should be rented immediately.
Ryan's article praising "Broken Rowers" caused one of us to

trying expe-j
rience.
Or, ati
least, one of
us has. The

twitch a little (just like every few seconds or so) because she
thought it was one of the worst movies of the year. Nothing. Hap
pened. Bill Murray made one facial expression in the entire
movie and Sharon Stone was a little creepy. That was it.
But we still love Victor and Ryan. And their articles are spec
tacular. In fact, we think you should go read them right now. Well,
after you've finished reading this, of course. But we just wanted
to make it clear that we don't agree with them. Well, one of us
doesn't, as the other was too busy... doing something that rhymes
with "CIA Operative" to actually see these movies. But she has
endorsed the comments of her fellow editor (and I don't know
about you, but I wouldn't mess with that). So who are you going
to go with? We'd recommend us.
The moral of the story is that it isn't as easy as we thought to
put together a "Best Of issue. Granted, writing every story our
selves would have been a daunting task, and we know that just be
cause we're editors we don't have the right to

"censor" our writers and we

shouldn't abuse our power by
dominating what gets pub
lished based upon our per-

other is still a lit
tle busy honing her

— j
skills with the sword for her top-secret-rhymes-with
"ninja" mission.
