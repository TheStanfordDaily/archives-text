## "Broken Flowers" blooms 
### RYAN LAMPE INTERMISSION DICTATOR 
I won't lie. For me, 2005 was about
one movie: "Star Wars Episode III:
Revenge of the Sith." "Star Wars"
was the reason I fell in love with cin
ema as a child. So the final episode of
the franchise was always going to
strike a chord.
But as I look back on the other
movies released in 2005,1 find myself
thinking a lot about "Broken Flow
ers." I can't claim much familiarity
with the films of Jim Jarmusch. His
last two movies did not impress me. I
found "Ghost Dog: The Way of the
Samurai" hopelessly pretentious and
"Coffee and Cigarettes" a frequent
bore. However, "Broken Flowers" is
a wonderful movie that shares none
of these qualities.
The film's premise is very simple.
Bill Murray plays Don Johnston, an
aging Don Juan who receives an
anonymous letter informing him that
he fathered a son 20 years back. Fol
lowing the advice of his inquisitive

neighbor, Johnston sets out across
the country to visit four former lovers
who may be responsible for the let
ter.
Murray is not given the same
room to shine here that he was given

in "Lost in Translation."
As a result, his perfor
mance does not leave
such a strong impression.
Nevertheless, his largely
expressionless portrayal
of Don is perfect for the
movie. This is a film
about subtleties, about
how a man slowly comes
to realize that the course
he has chosen may not
have been the right one.
Another of the film's

great strengths is an ensemble of co
stars that includes Sharon Stone,
Frances Conroy, Jessica Lange and
Tilda Swinton. Though each is af
forded very little screen time, they all
manage to register memorable turns,
quietly hinting how then characters
feel their lives have turned out and

how significant a meeting with Don is
to them. Their work is on par with
that of Murray.
At present, there is a lot of hype
surrounding "Brokeback Moun
tain," the so-called "gay cowboy

movie." Interestingly,
"Broken Flowers" shares
something in common
with "Brokeback" since
both films deal with paths
unchosen. One obvious
difference, though, is that
the characters in "Broke
back Mountain" were
forced to choose their
paths. Don's decision
was his own, and only by
the film's end does he
fully realize its severity.

y
In years to come, "Broken Flow
ers" will be forgotten. "Brokeback
Mountain" and "Star Wars Episode
III: Revenge of the Sith" will be re
membered. Nevertheless, in its own
quiet way. "Broken Flowers" is a ter
rific movie. Certainly one of 2005's
best.
