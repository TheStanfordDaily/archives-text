# The 						five most liberal and liberating films of 2005
## 
### ANDREW ZHOU INTERMISSION DESPOT 
1. "The Aristocrats"
How pornographi
) cally smutty can you
get using the power
of the filthy English

language? Ask Whoopi
Goldberg and Robin
Williams, who were
among the hundred or so
comedians asked to fill in
the nasty details of an on
going vaudeville joke.

2. "King Konjj"
Now this one's been
around since 1933.

How odd that over
70 years later no

one has protested this movie for its blatant promotion of
bestiality. Forget homosexuality or interracial dating.
King Kong (Andy Serkis) and Ann (Naomi Watts) have
slipped under the radar as perhaps one of the most radical
couples in film history. As in "Brokeback Mountain," per
haps they have been excused due to context, but still, isn't
this crossing the line?
3. "Rent"
A gay couple — one a cross-dressing Hispanic and one

an African-American; a white and black couple... make
that two. I almost forgot the lesbians —just about every
couple in this musical-turned-movie shatters the image of
the traditional relationship. When will that ever become
part of our American heritage? I guess when we start belt
ing out numbers to a synchronized dance in the middle of
the street.
4. "Brokehack Mountain"
The only reason the tent scene was not considered soft
core gay pornography was because its context in the film is
a beautiful display of pent-up emotion between Ennis
(Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal). Isolate the
scene and lengthen it a bit

and you could turn the
title, "Brokcback

Mountain," into a
good porno-

graphic pun.
5. "Harry Potter:
Goblet of Fire"

Daniel Rad
cliffe shows a new
side of himself in this
fourth installment as
he bares some naugh
tiness in the bathtub
scene. That he's
British just makes it
liberating.
