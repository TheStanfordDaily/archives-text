# Movies that should have been awesome, but somehow weren't
## 
### VICTOR FUSTE INTERMISSION TYRANT 
1. "Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"
This movie had eveiything going for it. The director of "Shrek," awe
some special effects, a classic story and a thinly veiled Jesus allusion. Too
bad it tipped off Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" Trilogy almost shot
for shot. And who wants to see sniveling British kids in Lego costumes any
ways?
2. "Dukes of Hazzard" _ f| § % *
Despite Jessica Simpson in the infamous Daisy Dukes (shorts, that is),
this movie was an insult to every whiskey-swillin', rodeo ridin', Confedei
ate flag wavin', red-blooded American. Even the original past members
said the movie was terrible and they had an alien on their show. An alien! 1
say! *
3. "Doom"
Turning zombies and demons into ground chuck with an overhauled
chainsaw was exciting wlen it was a computeif|ame. but when you put The
Rock into the equation it equals disaster. This movie was doomed by the
title alone. And yes, that is a bad pun. * A
4. "Fun with Dick and Jane" c
Jim Carrey as a bank robber. Sounds funny, right? Not quite. The pro
ducers of this movie were so preoccupied making the movie politically rel
evant that they forgot that Carrey is one of the funniest motion the planet.
Sure, sticking it to the manJAlec Baldwin does a fine job in a hot-so-subtle
impersonation of G.W liush) can be funny, but wasted comedic potential
makes me cry. 112
5. "Star Wars: Episode 111 — Revenge of the Sith" -sA
Granted, it was better than the other two prequels, but the fact that Jar
Jar Binks didn't die a horrific death ruined what could have been the per
fect movie. , , L
6. "Into the Blue"
The casting director forgot the cardinal rule of casting. If you have two
insanely attractive people in the lead roles (Jessica Alba and Paul Walker),
chances are the movie is a flop. Pretty girl + Handsome guy = Crappy movie
with scantily clad gorgeous people.
7. "Legend of Zorro*'
Like "The Tyra Banks Show," this movie should not exist. The original
"Mask of Zorro" was a surprise hit, but even with the combined efforts of
the original director, most of the original cast and the cute kiddie factor,
"Zorro" should never have cracked his bullwhip a second time.
8. "Serenity"
Here's a brilliant idea. Joss Whedon: why don't you take your TV series
"Firefly," which got cancelled because of low viewership, and turn it into a
feature length film? What's that? You're doing it for the fans? If you really
cared about them, you shouldn't have made this steaming pile.
9. "Waiting"
Ryan Reynolds* bout as a waiter should have been comic gold. 1 Sadly,
even Dane Cook as a cook (Greatest. Casting. Ever.) can't make the peo
ple ask for seconds.
10. "Chicken Little"
It was Disney. It was computer animated. It had Zach Braff ("Garden
State," "Scrubs"). And vet, I still wanted my money back when it was
through. The only thing going for it was the KFCI had afterwards. It was
my own form of vengeance.
