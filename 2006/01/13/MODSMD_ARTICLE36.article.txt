## You should be ashamed! The worst trends of 2005 
### JEREMY JACOBS INTERMISSION TRENDSETTER 
1. Scooters

I didn't think Stanford students could find a dorkier mode of transportation than a bike with a helmet and a

neon pant guard, but obviously 1 was wrong. Are those precious five seconds you save by riding scooters

with names like "Scoo-Bug" that important?

2. Those Juicy Dresses (hat Look Like Towels

First of all, 1 had to ask my girlfriend for the brand name. Trust me girls, you shouldn't spend 85 bucks to

look like you just got out of the shower in class. When paired with UGG boots, as they often are, it takes

me a moment to realize I'm not looking at a girl emerging from a shower in the Rocky Mountains.

That's what you're going for, right?

3. The "New" Nu

1 don't know if everyone forgot what "old" Nu was like, but it was pretty much the same. Now they

have trendy T-shirts stating clever things like "SIGMA NU" and ridiculously elaborate (not to

mention expensive) parties where everyone gets totally decked out in an attempt to get into a

party where they will undoubtedly serve you nonalcoholic beer in order to stay on the Univer
sity's good side. Good work, guys.

4 Halo 2

Any video game where it takes a week just to be able to manipulate the controls cor-

rectly automatically sucks. Furthermore, when one's entire social life consists of sit-

ting in a room of guys talking about how you dominated your buddy Frank last night

with a virtual rocket launcher, you might want to re-evaluate what you're doing

with your college experience.
