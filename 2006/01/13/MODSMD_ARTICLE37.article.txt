### MATTY SMITH INTERMISSION TV GUIDER 
So the second half of the television season is coming
up, coincidentally indicating that we're halfway through
the 2(X)5-20()6 television season. In the wake of runaway
successes "Lost" and "Desperate Housewives," serial
television took over reality TV's stranglehold on the
small screen market. Networks are finally putting an em
phasis on quality over shock value. And in a few days you
can find out which shows will take home the Golden
Globes for Best Whatever. But in addition to often being
wrong (see: the absence of nominations for "Veronica
Mars"); awards shows hardly ever cover the categories
that truly matter. So here they are: The Stanford Daily's
First Annual Alternative and Wholly Important Televi
sion Awards.
