## Is she eating? Is she dating? Top 7 gossip starlets of 2005 
### RACHEL TORRES INTERMISSION STARGAZER 
1. Lindsay Lohan.

She made tabbie

headlines by sharing
a piece of cake with
l Nicole Ritchie (see
| #2) in front of some

paparazzi. It total
ly convinced us
that she did not, in

fact, have an eating

disorder. On the other

decency
called and
it wants
you to
stop being
such a
weepy
lame-ass
and mak
ing stupid
movies!
However,
you have
to admire
the stun
ning deft
ness with
which

hand, crawling around

the floor of a Holly-

wood 7-Eleven con-

vinced us that she

is, in fact, kinda
trashy and like-

ly addicted to
drugs. . . and
come to think

of it, probably

does have an
eating disor-

der. After
all, she has

been hos
pitalized

several
times

for
"ex-

haus
tion,"

which is
Holly-

wood-ese
for "rehab."

2. Nicole Ritchie

Screw you, Paris. I prefer the newly classy
Nicole because she's ethnically ambiguous
and lost all that weight after heroine rehab.
Even though it's usually the heroine that
makes you look disgustingly thin even in pic
tures, my money is on something else to ex
plain the twig arms, Bambi eyes and overly
toothy smile. Fresh powder, anyone?
3. Jennifer AnLston.
"Billy Idol called, he wants his look back!"
Hey, Jen,

Aniston's reps have manipulated the tabbies
into covering Jen's supposed relationship with
Vince Vaughn. All to promote the movie
they made together. I can't remember the
name, but it will probably be stupid.
4. Jessica Simpson.
Oh, gosh, I was so sure it was going to
work out. I mean, she dresses so well! I
better buy the "Newlyweds: The Final
Season" DVD that MTV has been hawk-

ing before jokes
about "chicken of
the sea" become
entirely obsolete.
5. Tom Cruise.
Now, I know
what you're say
ing, that I should
put Katie Holmes,
or at the very least,
"TomKat" as

#5. But, hello, Tom Cruise jump
ing on couches and condemning
prescription drugs? That's more
starlet-esque than La Lohan's hos
pitalization for "an asthma attack."
Plus, fab shades and great denim
means that the man is most definitely a
starlet.
6. Britney Spears.
So, 2004 brought Britney a quickie
wedding, a quickie annulment, waning
record sales and a trashy boyfriend
who became a trashy husband.
2005: husband still trashy, record

sales still weak and then... she
got FAT â€” I mean, pregnant.
But now that I know she's
normal and can't lay off the
Cheetos like the rest of
us, I like her less. Hope
fully, 2006 will see
Britney lose the baby
fat and stop wearing
message T-shirts. Un
less it says,"In reality,
I'm incredibly inarticu
late, so 1 must communi
cate via t he slogan on this T
shirt." And then we could
copy it and sell it in the back
of "UsWeekly."
7. Eva Longoria.
She was at, like, EVERY
Hollywood party this year. Or, at
least, that's what Eonline.com gos
sip columnist Ted Casablancas led
me to believe. But you know what
they say.. J here today, cancelled to
morrow.



"It's like kissing my dad!"
