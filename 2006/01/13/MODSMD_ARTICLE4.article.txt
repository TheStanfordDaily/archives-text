## Cal: Just another opponent? Stanford's slow start takes some luster off tonight's cross-Bay rivalry 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Any other sea
son, the notion that
men's basketball
views the California
contest like any
other game would
be considered
laughable, if not
downright heresy.
However, this
year has been any
thing but"any other
season" — featur
ing losses to lowly
opponents, poor
perimeter defense
and injuries up and
down the roster. In
an ironic way, it
makes sense that
this is the year that
archrival Cal be-

comes no more special than any other opponent.
"Any win right now is special for us, whether that be
Cal or whether that be anybody in the [Pacific-10 Confer
ence], or not in the Pac-10," senior guard Chris Hernan
dez said. "We're just .500 right now and need anything we
can get,"
Senior guard Dan Grunfeld agrees, adding that the
Cardinal (6-6,2-2) are already playing for their postseason
lives.
I Health, defense are
questions for Cardinal

"Especially in-conference, I think every win is
equally important," he said. "At the end of the day,
when they're looking if you have 13,12,15 confer
ence wins, they don't say,'Oh, well you beat Cal.' It's
you've got that many conference wins."
Senior forward Matt Haryasz, known for his on
court emotion, admits that he might be more excited
for tonight's contest than normal but ultimately in
sists that this season's unanticipated difficulties have
rendered the Cal (9-4,3-1) contest into no more than
any other game on the slate — a virtual must-win.
"Playing Cal, it's already our rival, so that's going
to be a big game for us," Haryasz said. "It's the first
game with all the students back, so that's going to be
fun, and they're a good team so it's going to be a lit
tle extra, but I think we're just excited to get out
there and try to build on the last two wins."
While Stanford downplays the contest, history
suggests that Cal has to be excited to visit Maples
Pavilion as only a one-point underdog. The Bears
have lost 15 of their last 17 to the Cardinal, including
five straight; the Bears last won at Stanford in 1993.
After winning at Southern California and UCLA in
December, Cal will be chasing additional history
tonight, as a victory will give it its first three-game
road win streak in the conference since 1957.
The contest looks to be decided in the frontcourt,
where Cal forward Leon Powe averages nearly 20
points and 10 rebounds per game. Powe could be
come the first Bear to average a double-double in 13
years, and Stanford head coach Trent Johnson calls
him the best player his squad has faced all year.
"The thing that impresses me the most about
Leon is his tenacity and his toughness to the ball,"
Johnson said. "When a shot goes up, whether it's of
fense or defense, he's going to be around it, he's
going to rebound it."
Rounding out the Bear frontcourt is sophomore
center DeVon I lardin. who paces the Pac-10 in field
goal percentage (61 percent) and offensive rebounds
(3.1 per game).
Johnson was effusive in his praise of Cal's front
court. ranking it the best frontcourt he has seen as
Stanford's head coach. That includes an Arizona
State squad that featured Ike Diogu, an eventual
ninth pick in the NBA Draft and a Mississippi State
frontcourt that shredded the Cardinal for 45 points
in last year's NCAA Tournament.
Matched against a unit he views as so potent.
Johnson stressed the need to improve defensively,
but also implied a certain helplessness.
"Defensively.it is what it is." Johnson said."We're
going to have to change defensively to really, really,
really compete at a high level."
Ihe good news and the bad news for Cardinal
faithful is that the Stanford defense has plenty of room
for improvement. To date, a relatively weak slate of
opponents has averaged nearly 45 percent shooting

"We dropped some games earlier in the season

Much of the squad's sub-par start can be traced
to an injury bug that has viciously bitten the Cardi

Cal. At a TUesday afternoon press conference,
Haryasz estimated that he was just 70 percent recov

Meanwhile, after insisting that he felt fully recov

against Cal last year, Grunfeld recently admitted
that his movement is still somewhat hampered by the
injury. He did not practice Iliesday to give his body a
rest and is also expected to start tonight.
Sophomore center Peter Prowitt is listed as day-to

said has plagued him since high school.

26-0 allowed under 39 percent overall and 33 percent
from the arc against a tougher group of opponents.
Players admit that porous defense may have cost
them victories already hut insist the effort has im
proved in their last two contests, wins against the
Oregon schools.
"We dropped some games earlier in the season
where if our defense had been better, we would have
had a better chance," Grunfeld said.
Much of the squad's sub-par start can be traced
to an injury bug that has viciously bitten the Cardi
nal and has not relented on the eve of the tilt with
Cal. At a TUesday afternoon press conference,
Haryasz estimated that he was just 70 percent recov
ered from a left ankle sprain, but the senior is ex
pected to start tonight.
Meanwhile, after insisting that he felt fully recov
ered from a season-ending torn ACL suffered
against Cal last year, Grunfeld recently admitted
that his movement is still somewhat hampered by the
injury. He did not practice Iliesday to give his body a
rest and is also expected to start tonight.
Sophomore center Peter Prowitt is listed as day-to
day with lower back spasms. If he does play tonight.his
minutes may be limited by the injury, which Johnson
said has plagued him since high school.

comes no more special than any other opponent.
"Any win right now is special for us, whether that be
Cal or whether that be anybody in the [Pacific-10 Confer
ence], or not in the Pac-10," senior guard Chris Hernan
dez said. "We're just .500 right now and need anything we
can get,"
Senior guard Dan Grunfeld agrees, adding that the
Cardinal (6-6,2-2) are already playing for their postseason
lives.
I Health, defense are
questions for Cardinal

"Especially in-conference, I think every win is
equally important," he said. "At the end of the day,
when they're looking if you have 13,12,15 confer
ence wins, they don't say,'Oh, well you beat Cal.' It's
you've got that many conference wins."
Senior forward Matt Haryasz, known for his on
court emotion, admits that he might be more excited
for tonight's contest than normal but ultimately in
sists that this season's unanticipated difficulties have
rendered the Cal (9-4,3-1) contest into no more than
any other game on the slate — a virtual must-win.
"Playing Cal, it's already our rival, so that's going
to be a big game for us," Haryasz said. "It's the first
game with all the students back, so that's going to be
fun, and they're a good team so it's going to be a lit
tle extra, but I think we're just excited to get out
there and try to build on the last two wins."
While Stanford downplays the contest, history
suggests that Cal has to be excited to visit Maples
Pavilion as only a one-point underdog. The Bears
have lost 15 of their last 17 to the Cardinal, including
five straight; the Bears last won at Stanford in 1993.
After winning at Southern California and UCLA in
December, Cal will be chasing additional history
tonight, as a victory will give it its first three-game
road win streak in the conference since 1957.
The contest looks to be decided in the frontcourt,
where Cal forward Leon Powe averages nearly 20
points and 10 rebounds per game. Powe could be
come the first Bear to average a double-double in 13
years, and Stanford head coach Trent Johnson calls
him the best player his squad has faced all year.
"The thing that impresses me the most about
Leon is his tenacity and his toughness to the ball,"
Johnson said. "When a shot goes up, whether it's of
fense or defense, he's going to be around it, he's
going to rebound it."
Rounding out the Bear frontcourt is sophomore
center DeVon I lardin. who paces the Pac-10 in field
goal percentage (61 percent) and offensive rebounds
(3.1 per game).
Johnson was effusive in his praise of Cal's front
court. ranking it the best frontcourt he has seen as
Stanford's head coach. That includes an Arizona
State squad that featured Ike Diogu, an eventual
ninth pick in the NBA Draft and a Mississippi State
frontcourt that shredded the Cardinal for 45 points
in last year's NCAA Tournament.
Matched against a unit he views as so potent.
Johnson stressed the need to improve defensively,
but also implied a certain helplessness.
"Defensively.it is what it is." Johnson said."We're
going to have to change defensively to really, really,
really compete at a high level."
Ihe good news and the bad news for Cardinal
faithful is that the Stanford defense has plenty of room
for improvement. To date, a relatively weak slate of
opponents has averaged nearly 45 percent shooting
