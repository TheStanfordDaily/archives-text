So what do you do? Don't worry,

Okay, so the theme of this week's
Intermission is all about remember
ing the last year so that you don't
have to dig past your post-New
Year's haze. That's all well and good
when it comes to pop culture and the
new X-Box, but if you're talking sex,
Roxy's good advice is to forget as
much as humanly possible,
"But I had great sex in 2(X)5!" You
argue, forlorn.
No you didn't.
I'm going to go out on a limb here,
but at risk of alienating my loyal read
ership and several recent booty calls,
I'm just going to say it. College kids
are bad at sex. It's not so much that
we (yes, I'm going to use the collec
tive noun here to be fair) are bad at
it... there's just a lot of room for im
provement. And can you blame your
selves really? How long have you
been having sex anyway? Our most
precocious peers only got into it six
years ago — and that's generous.
Would you want a brain surgeon who
had only been at it for six years?
Considering this, it's no wonder
older men have always been the brass
ring, something most undergraduate
gals can only dream about while wait
ing for their time on The Farm to tick
away so they can go find some veter
an lovers out in the real world. Not

Roxy has logged enough experience
in this area to carefully navigate al
most any unsatisfactory sexual expe
rience in the book. This isn't just for
the girls though, so guys — if you
want to be absolutely sure all that
moaning is real — listen up.
First, confidence is the number
one key for everything Roxy's discov
ered— not just for middle school
oral book reports or office hours.
This doesn't just mean that you
should know with every fiber of your
being that you're one sexy thing. You
also have to be able to play off the
most awkward of moments without
being phased. Nothing spoils a great
dry-humping session like that farting
noise that happens when bodies start
slappin' (for lack of a better phrase).
The best way to make it over these
speed bumps o' love: laugh about it.
Sex is hilarious. The sooner you real
ize, the easier it will be to let go of all
your neurotic romantic ideals and
have a good time.
Second, be a sexy teacher (or
schoolgirl if that's what's in the
cards). As I mentioned earlier, there
is no need to be a phony or a dictator
in the sack. All you need is the
smooth ability to guide your partner
to unlock your particular combina
tion. Of course this also requires you
knowing your own combination. If
you're reading this and have no idea
what 1 mean, then you have some
studying to do.
Third, slow the hell down. Bad sex
is born of haste. I know what you're
thinking, and Roxy is just as much a
fan of that I-must-devour-every-inch
of-you-right-now love as anyone else.
But you gotta build up to it. Rome

want to be absolutely sure all that
moaning is real — listen up.
First, confidence is the number
one key for everything Roxy's discov
ered— not just for middle school
oral book reports or office hours.
This doesn't just mean that you
should know with every fiber of your
being that you're one sexy thing. You
also have to be able to play off the
most awkward of moments without
being phased. Nothing spoils a great
dry-humping session like that farting
noise that happens when bodies start
slappin' (for lack of a better phrase).
The best way to make it over these
speed bumps o' love: laugh about it.
Sex is hilarious. The sooner you real
ize, the easier it will be to let go of all
your neurotic romantic ideals and
have a good time.
Second, be a sexy teacher (or
schoolgirl if that's what's in the
cards). As I mentioned earlier, there
is no need to be a phony or a dictator
in the sack. All you need is the
smooth ability to guide your partner
to unlock your particular combina
tion. Of course this also requires you
knowing your own combination. If
you're reading this and have no idea
what 1 mean, then you have some
studying to do.
Third, slow the hell down. Bad sex
is born of haste. I know what you're
thinking, and Roxy is just as much a
fan of that I-must-devour-every-inch
of-you-right-now love as anyone else.
But you gotta build up to it. Rome

So what do you do? Don't worry,

Okay, so the theme of this week's
Intermission is all about remember
ing the last year so that you don't
have to dig past your post-New
Year's haze. That's all well and good
when it comes to pop culture and the
new X-Box, but if you're talking sex,
Roxy's good advice is to forget as
much as humanly possible,
"But I had great sex in 2(X)5!" You
argue, forlorn.
No you didn't.
I'm going to go out on a limb here,
but at risk of alienating my loyal read
ership and several recent booty calls,
I'm just going to say it. College kids
are bad at sex. It's not so much that
we (yes, I'm going to use the collec
tive noun here to be fair) are bad at
it... there's just a lot of room for im
provement. And can you blame your
selves really? How long have you
been having sex anyway? Our most
precocious peers only got into it six
years ago — and that's generous.
Would you want a brain surgeon who
had only been at it for six years?
Considering this, it's no wonder
older men have always been the brass
ring, something most undergraduate
gals can only dream about while wait
ing for their time on The Farm to tick
away so they can go find some veter
an lovers out in the real world. Not

Roxy has logged enough experience
in this area to carefully navigate al
most any unsatisfactory sexual expe
rience in the book. This isn't just for
the girls though, so guys — if you
want to be absolutely sure all that
moaning is real — listen up.
