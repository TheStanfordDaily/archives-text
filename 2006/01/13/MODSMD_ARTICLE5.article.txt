# LABOR UPDATE
## Workers turn down new contract 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford Hospital workers voted to reject the Hospital's
latest contract offer on Monday. Separate negotiations be
tween the University and its service workers continue. The

ongoing labor disputes at
Stanford have drawn at
tention to parallels with a
changing climate for or
ganized labor in Ameri
ca. On Wednesday. The
Daily examined several
causes fora weakened
and divided labor move
ment nationwide.
In this second arti
cle. The Daily looks at a
changing regulatory cli
mate that has seen gov
ernment become de
creasingly friendly to
organized labor over
past decades and espe
cially over the past five

years. While there are
many economic factors at work and disagreement re
mains about the extent government should interfere with
contract negotiation, most experts agree that this is a dif
ficult time for unions to grow and seek recourse for their
grievances.
THE LAW
The fundamental labor law in the United States is the
Wagner Act of 1935. Also known as the National Labor
Relations Act, President Franklin Roosevelt pushed the
legislation as an essential part of his New Deal package
after the Supreme Court ruled his National Recovery
Administration unconstitutional. The act created the
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).a federal or
ganization tasked with arbitrating disputes, ensuring fair
union elections and penalizing employers for unfair
practices.
"The Wagner Act said it was public policy to promote
collective bargaining." said Stanford alumnus and Uni
versity of Utah Economics Prof. Peter Philips.

THE BOARD
The law is firmly in support of workers, but the issues
they bring forward to the government are often not ad
dressed and sometimes even ignored, observers said.The di
rection of labor policy historically shifts to the right or left
depending on the administration in power.
There are five seats on the board,and each member is ap
pointed to a five-year term. Traditionally, the party in con
trol of the White House has held three of the seats. Since
President George W. Hush took office, decisions have fa
vored management. Precedent set under past administra
tions has been watered down.


PART 2
OF A SERIES
"By every account that 1 have seen,
the NLRB appointees under the two
Bush administrations have been very
reactionary toward the right to organ
ize," said University of Illinois Prof
Robert Bruno."Bv all accounts, there is
no effective legal right to organize be
cause there are so many opportunities
for employers to undermine that right."
The Federal Government has used
the labor relations board that was sup
posed to protect workers in recent
years to hinder unionization.
"Government has quite often
played the role of discouraging union
ization. primarily through the
NLRB." Philips said*
"The Democratic Party has been
less effective in speaking to the needs
of working people," Bruno added. "As
a result, the unions do not have the
friends that they have had historically."
According to George Washington
University Law School Prof. Charles
Craver, who specializes in labor arbi
tration and collective bargaining, the
labor board and courts have become
quite conservative.
Many laws designed to protect
workers' right to organize have been
weakened as the government has em
barked on a multi-decade, multi-ad
ministration effort to deregulate tradi
tionally unionized industries.
"Deregulation has placed great
pressure on organized labor "said Law
Prof. William Gould, former chairman
of the NLRB under President Bill
Clinton. "The law is so weak.The law is
designed to promote collcctive organi
zation, but the law is ineffective."
One problem is the delay in admin
istrative processes, Gould said. It takes
a long time to get cases resolved when
they are brought before the NLRB.
Gould trumpeted progress made in
expediting cases during his tenure in
the Clinton administration.
"Under the Bush administration,
delay has become worse," he said.
Another problem with the regulato
ry climate from organized labor's point
of view is that the government does not
take the side of workers as often as it
used to.Though there arc ways the gov
ernment can hurry the process to get a
speedy resolution — such as getting
court injunctions to stop discrimination
or illegal hiring practices — these tools
have rarely been used by the current
administration.

"The Bush National Labor Rela
tions Board has stopped using these
procedures because they are relatively
effective in circumventing the delay
problem," Gould said.
Gould and others complained
about the lack of enforcement ability
held by the NLRB. The labor board
can not award punitive damages for
employer wrongdoing. Even if labor
unions can prove companies acted
unlawfully, the only reparations
workers can win is back pay and rein
statement to their old job, Gould said.
The government, he added,
deducts from judgment awards any
pay from another job a worker may
have earned while waiting for their
case to be decided. Because of this
delay, many of the employees bringing
complaints before the federal govern
ment are no longer around at the end
of the long proceedings to collect back
pay or to re-start work at their old jobs.
THE ELIP SIDE
Even when the federal government
or Congress has tried to protect collec
tive bargaining rights in the past, com
panies have found loopholes to miti
gate the impact, many experts said.
"Congress is in a terrible bind be
cause corporations manage to void the
cost every time they try to do some
thing to help the worker," Craver said.
Economists and historians dispute
how significant an unfriendly regula
tory environment has been in the
weakening of unions.
"Regulation is a contributing but
not a major factor for union decline,"
said Economics Prof. John Pencavel.
"[ln the past), the regulatory environ
ment was also not very supportive, but
unions grew rapidly anyway."
STATE LAW
Some employers note that Califor
nia has especially stringent labor laws
and does more to protect workers than
most states.
Philips said that unions have re
mained stronger in places like Cali
fornia and the upper midwest even
while they have dwindled in regions
including the American south. Cali
fornia has consistently been one of
the most unionized states in the coun
try. Elsewhere, states have rolled
back labor laws.

"The effects of these legislative and
judicial acts [at a state and federal
level] have been to undercut collective
bargaining," he explained.
Even though the state of California
compares favorably to other states on
labor issues, the law dealing with the
right to organize and recruit members
is under federal jurisdiction.
"The problem is that California can
not enact legislation because the
courts say state law is preempted by
federal labor law," Gould said.
THE SPLIT
The schism in the AFL-CIO last
summer that resulted in the union
losing more than 30 percent of its 13
million workers has created more
doubt about the future of organized
labor. Initially, the union's leadership
had argued that a split-up union
would have less members and, as a
result, less clout.
However, some experts think that
two strong vibrant union associations
in America could increase political
clout. ITie split could cause the Demo
cratic Party to become more respon
sive to labor unions, said Bruno, who is
also a coordinator of the Illinois-based
Institute of Labor and Industrial Rela
tions.
"Instead of a one-size-fits-all strat
egy.the Democrats will now need to go
to two unions to gain support," he said.
"This creates the possibility for an in
creased level of community conscious
ness about worker's issues."
