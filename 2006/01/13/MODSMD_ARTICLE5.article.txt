# LABOR UPDATE
## Workers turn down new contract 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford Hospital workers voted to reject the Hospital's
latest contract offer on Monday. Separate negotiations be
tween the University and its service workers continue. The

ongoing labor disputes at
Stanford have drawn at
tention to parallels with a
changing climate for or
ganized labor in Ameri
ca. On Wednesday. The
Daily examined several
causes fora weakened
and divided labor move
ment nationwide.
In this second arti
cle. The Daily looks at a
changing regulatory cli
mate that has seen gov
ernment become de
creasingly friendly to
organized labor over
past decades and espe
cially over the past five

years. While there are
many economic factors at work and disagreement re
mains about the extent government should interfere with
contract negotiation, most experts agree that this is a dif
ficult time for unions to grow and seek recourse for their
grievances.
THE LAW
The fundamental labor law in the United States is the
Wagner Act of 1935. Also known as the National Labor
Relations Act, President Franklin Roosevelt pushed the
legislation as an essential part of his New Deal package
after the Supreme Court ruled his National Recovery
Administration unconstitutional. The act created the
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).a federal or
ganization tasked with arbitrating disputes, ensuring fair
union elections and penalizing employers for unfair
practices.
"The Wagner Act said it was public policy to promote
collective bargaining." said Stanford alumnus and Uni
versity of Utah Economics Prof. Peter Philips.

THE BOARD
The law is firmly in support of workers, but the issues
they bring forward to the government are often not ad
dressed and sometimes even ignored, observers said.The di
rection of labor policy historically shifts to the right or left
depending on the administration in power.
There are five seats on the board,and each member is ap
pointed to a five-year term. Traditionally, the party in con
trol of the White House has held three of the seats. Since
President George W. Hush took office, decisions have fa
vored management. Precedent set under past administra
tions has been watered down.
