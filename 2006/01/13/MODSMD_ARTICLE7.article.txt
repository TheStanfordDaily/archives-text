## Filibuster unlikely in Alito hearings 
### JESSE J. HOLLAND ASSOCIATED PRESS 
(AP) — Samuel Alito coasted toward confirmation
as the 110 th Supreme Court justice lliursday, ending 18
grueling hours of Senate interrogation with Democrats
showing little appetite fora last-ditch filibuster attempt
on the Senate floor.
"I am my own person, with whatever abilities I have
and whatever limitations I have," Alito declared as he
wrapped up his final public appearance before senators
begin voting on his nomination.
Democrats contend the former Reagan administra
tion lawyer is likely to swing the court to the right in re
placing the centrist Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who
has provided decisive votes on such important issues as
abortion, capital punishment and affirmative action.
Judiciary Committee senators are scheduled to meet
next Tuesday to begin debating the 55-year-old federal
judge's nomination. Chairman Arlen Specter, R-Pa., had
wanted a committee vote then, but Democrats have
talked of seeking a delay.
At the same time. Sen. Dick Durbin, a member of the
committee and his party's second-ranking leader, sug
gested Democrats would not attempt to filibuster, which
would require Republicans to gain 60 votes to advance
the nomination. "When you consider the numbers in
volved, it is unlikely," he said.
With the hearings ending, interest groups rushed new
television commercials to the airwaves.
Progress for America, which has close ties to the
White House, plans to spend $250,000 to air a national ad
beginning Friday that accuses Democrats of "partisan at
tacks" on Alito at the hearings.
lndependentCourt.org said it intended to counter
with a commercial of its own.
Ads are not likely to change Alito's support among
the Senate's 55 Republicans. GOP senators, both on and
off the committee, praised Alito as his testimony ended.
"I enthusiastically endorse and support Judge Alito's
nomination." Chuck Hagel of Nebraska said Thursday.
Sen. Jeff Sessions. R-Ala., noted to the judge that his high
school friends "predicted you would serve on the
Supreme Court one day, and I think that's going to turn
out to be a good prediction."
Chances of a nomination-crippling filibuster seemed
to dim as the day went on, with two members of the

"Gang of 14" — centrist senators who brokered a deal
last year to avoid a filibuster showdown over judges —
saying Alito's nomination does not deserve one.
Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine,"does not believe that
Judge Alito warrants a filibuster," spokeswoman Anto
nia Ferrier said.
Sen. Ben Nelson. D-Neb., said, "So far I have seen
nothing* during my interview with the nominee, the back
ground materials that have been produced or through
the committee process that I would consider a disquali
fying issue against Judge Alito."
Alito offered words of respect for O'Connor, the
woman he would replace. "She has been known for her
meticulous devotion to the facts of the particular cases
that come before her and her belief that each case needs
to be decided on its complex facts," Alito said.
Democrats argue that Alito, in 15 years as an appel
late judge, has built a conservative record that foretells
his Supreme Court stance. But they face an uphill battle
in finding enough votes to filibuster his nomination —
the only way they can stop him.

It takes 41 votes to sustain a filibuster, and there are
44 Democrats and one Democratic-leaning independ
ent. Several Democrats, including Nelson and California
Sen. Dianne Feinstein,already have said they don't think
a filibuster is warranted.Several committee Democrats
made it clear they were not inclined to vote for Alito. in
cluding Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and
Charles Schumer of New York.
After four days of hearings, there are "even more
questions about Judge Alito's commitment to the fair
ness and equality for all," Kennedy said.
Democrats repeatedly attacked Alito's decisions as a
judge on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and his writ
ings while a lawyer for the Reagan administration — in
cluding a statement saying the Constitution did not
protect the right to an abortion — and they highlighted his
membership in an organization that discouraged the ad
mission of women and minorities at Princeton University.
" r llie evidence before us makes it hard for us to vote
yes," said Schumer, head of the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee.
