(AP) â€” Ariel Sharon's doctors faced new criticism
'111ursday for failing todivulge a brain disease discovered
after the prime minister's initial stroke and for prescrib
ingbloodthinnersthatmayhavecontributedtoamassive
second stroke.
The criticism added to a growing chorus of questions
about Sharon's treatment. Some experts, however, said
there was no clear-cut answer.
As Sharon lay comatose for an eighth day Thursday, a
brain scan showed the remnants of the blood in his brain
from a Jan. 4 stroke have been absorbed, hospital offi
cials said in a statement.
In response, doctors removed a tube they had insert
ed into Sharon's skull to relieve pressure on his brain, the
statement said.

After Sharon, 77, suffered an initial, minor stroke
Dec. 18, doctors put him on Clexane, an anticoagulant.
At a news conference a few days later, doctors acknowl
edged blood thinners increased the risk of brain hemor
rhage, but said the fear of a clot leading to another stroke
was greater in this case.
The debate gained momentum after the Haaretz
daily revealed that Sharon also suffered from cerebral
amyloid angiopathy, known as CAA, a disease common
in the elderly that weakens the blood vessels in the brain
and increases the risk of hemorrhage.
Doctors confirmed they knew about the disease after
the first stroke, but prescribed the blood thinners any
way, a move outside experts criticized Thursday.
"If someone has a disease that caused bleeding, that
causes bleeding, that could cause bleeding in the future,
giving anticoagulants ... is certainly an undesirable situ
ation," said Amos Korczyn, head of the Tel Aviv Univer
sity Medical School's neurology department.
Doctors were prescribing the Clexane until they
could seal a small hole in Sharon's heart they said caused
Sharon's first stroke. Clexane, or enoxaparin, is sold as
Lovenox in the United States.
But some experts questioned that theory and said the
initialstroke wasmore likelycausedby Sharon's braincon
dition.
