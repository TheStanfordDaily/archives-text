## Noodles on Tap 
### 
It has not been a good day for my be
longings. I started out the day with two
earrings and by noon only had one. I'm
not certain when I lost it, and this concerns
me. Earlier, I had a meeting with a biology
prof, to discuss research opportunities.
When 1 spoke with her, did I have an ear
ring in each ear or not? The question
haunts me.
This evening, I'm off to drown my sor
rows in won ton soup with Adam. As I'm
biking to meet him, my phone rings and 1
drop my new glove in my haste to answer
it. The black glove falls into the black
night, never to be found again. It was
worth approximately 50 cents, but I had
owned it for less than two hours and I was
irked.
Adam gets the full story of my missing
possessions.
"I feel like I've lost one of everything I
had two of," 1 complain. "I'm concerned
about losing my limbs."
We drive to San Antonio shopping cen
ter, home of Luu Noodle. This Chinese
eatery has seven locations, but five are (in
explicably) called NewTUng Kee noodles.
Luu Noodle is speedy and efficient, a
veritable assembly line of Chinese cuisine.
Five servers are there while we're eating,
but it feels like there's more because they
seem to be everywhere at once.
Our food arrives within three minutes
— no joke. I think their kitchen must dis
pense food like soda fountains dispense
drinks. Push a lever, you get chow niein
with tofu. Chinese food on tap.
I am eating vermicelli duck curry soup
and Adam is eating crispy fried noodles.
The noodles have a tendency to shatter and
fly everywhere when he tries to take a bite.
"Sorry if I blind you with a noodle," he
says. I become very worried. Today has
proved dangerous for things that come in
pairs.
Luckily. I hold on to both eyes and use
them to scope out the room.The restaurant
feels like a cafeteria — "168 persons"
reads the occupancy capacity sign. But the
tables are lacking nothing — a bucket of
chopsticks, a bucket of forks, sauces, nap
kins. Luu Noodle is a well-oiled machine.
On the walls are large pictures of every
menu item, numbered for ease of ordering.
The restaurant has all your Chinese staples
— noodles,chow mein, soups, rice plates —
with pad thai thrown in for good measure.
I'm drinking Thai iced tea, which costs 55
cents more if you order it without ice. "Aha,"
Adam says. "They know just who's eating
here — people trying to get every penny."
A few drinks on the menu pique our in
terest; "Fresh young coconut" is one. Per
haps the name lost something in the trans
lation.
The other perplexing beverage is
"Three course of beans drink," available
in pink and green. What could conceivably
be in that? What makes it pink or green? I
vow to order it next time.
Adam notices something: "Luu Noo
dle doesn't follow the Chinese Restaurant
Naming Algorithm."
"What is the algorithm?" I ask, be
mused.
"I figured out that all you need to do to
name a Chinese restaurant is choose one
of three adjectives. The adjectives are:
golden, lucky or happy."
Adam is beaming as he continues to
spell out the formula: "You follow the ad
jective with one of three nouns.The nouns
are: garden, dragon or lion. There are ex
actly nine Chinese restaurant names.This
is the tenth: Luu Noodle."
I want to end this article by talking
about the philosophical importance of
Luu Noodle. I m certain it's emblematic of
postmodernism, or a microcosm of the
American experience, or something. I
ponder this aloud on the car ride back to
Stanford.
"Why are you so hung up on this?"
Adam asks.
I suppose he's right. Sometimes a noo
dle is just a noodle. And if that noodle is a
Luu noodle, it's a good one.
The verdict:
Ouick, tasty, cheap. I expect to become a
regular here in my Stanford career.
