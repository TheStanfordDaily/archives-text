## "The lies and deception have dashed the hopes of patients and their families" PHENOM turned FRAUD South Korean researcher Hwang Woo-suk has admitted to faking data in stem-cell studies. In doing so, he has dashed hopes of ill patients. 
### llena George CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In 2004, South Korea's "Supreme Scientist"
Hwang Woo-suk, published a paper in the jour
nal Science claiming to have cloned a human
embryo and extracted stem cells from it. Hwang
was immediately hailed for his major accomplish
ment in stem-cell research.
But last Tliesday, a Seoul National University
panel investigating the veracity of Hwang's work
determined that this claim was false. This follows
closely on the heels of the panel's finding last
month that Hwang's other watershed paper — in
which he claimed to tailor stem-cell lines to specif
ic patients — also contained falsified data.
Hwang has since apologized and resigned from
his position at the university. According to The
Korea Times, he may now face prosecution for
fraud and/or embezzlement of government funds.
"His research team did create some cloned
human embryos but advanced only to an early
stage in a delicate procedure of extracting stem
cell lines from the embryos," the International
Herald Tribune reported on Jan. 12.
Embryonic stem cells have the potential to dif
ferentiate, or mature, into other kinds of cells —
from organ cells, to skin cells, to bone cells. Al
though the mechanism by which the body signals
a stem cell to become a specific kind of cell re
mains unknown, many researchers consider stem
cells to hold great promise for people suffering
from debilitating diseases such as Alzheimer's and
AIDS.The hope is that stem cells could one day be
used to replace cells damaged by illness.
Research in this area is contentious, however,
because embryonic stem cells remain the only
type of stem cells that can differentiate into other
types of mature cells. To obtain stem cells, re
searchers must extract them from viable, fertilized
embryos. This destroys the embryo, creating con
troversy over the ethics of the process.
In the Aug. 2001 edition of the newsletter Fal
well Confidential, Southern Baptist minister Jerry
Falwell denounced it as the"the destruction of one
life to save another."
Hwang claimed in his 2005 paper to have creat
ed stem cell lines that genetically matched specific
patients by removing the nucleus of an egg and re
placing it with a skin cell from the patient. Extract
ed stem cells from this embryo could then be trans
planted to the patient without inciting any negative
immune response, since the donor material would
be a perfect genetic match to that of the patient.
Known as schematic cell nuclear transfer, this
process was used to clone Dolly the sheep.

rrom a basic
human standpoint,
the biggest disap
pointment is that
the lies and decep
tion have dashed the
hopes of patients and
their families who

looked to South
Korea as a place that
understood the need to

move this research
ahead to alleviate human
suffering" says Christopher

Scott, executive director of the
Stanford Program on Stem Cells and

Society. "The fact that more human suf
fering has been created by the controver
sy is perhaps the saddest thing of all."

In addition to the fraudulent aspects
of Hwang's work, his research meth-

ods were unsound. He admitted in
November that some of the egns

used in his research were ob
tained from females who

worked in the lab. Irving
Weissman, a Stanford profes-

sor of developmental biolo
gy, explains that this was
"not allowable as his au-

thority over thein could
not have allowed free choice."
Weissman adds that this could not occur at
Stanford, given the amount of oversight present
and because junior faculty are independent — un
like the hierarchy present in Hwang's lab.
"In the United States,every faculty member is in
dependent in deciding what research line they wish
to follow, each grant they submit, etc.," Weissman
says."ln many countries, the funds flow to the senior
professor, who hires and funds the associate and as
sistant professors. ITiis gives the professor enormous
power over the ideas and careers of the faculty
under him or her. I don't know the exact hierarchy
in Hwang's lab, but it follows the latter tradition."
Scott adds that Hwang's actions were wrought
with other ethical violations.
"It is clear that he was at the very least inatten
tive to the results coming from his own lab and
those of his collaborators, and at worst he knew the
data was false and lied about it." Scott says."He
was cavalier about the way he procured eggs from
his female associates, and iunorcd well-known eth

ical rules about informed consent. Most tellingly,
Hwang is guilty of a profound hubris — the only
explanation for his globe-trotting behavior based
on what we know now was a house of cards."
Negative consequences from this work were
also felt by other researchers. Weissman says that
Hwang's reported success with schematic cell nu
clear transfer "had the effect of dampening other
labs to develop any other method, as obtaining
eggs for less efficient methods would not pass
medical ethical oversight."
Finally, the incident carries consequences for
scientific journals.
"The way in which his experiments were ac
cepted into Science will be examined," Scott says.
"TTie journal's editor in chief. Donald Kennedy,
announced yesterday that the magazine would re
view the procedures for peer-review."
Weissman argues that it takes more than publi
cation in a respected journal fora finding to be ac
cepted.

"Most scientists don't accept a finding as true
simply because it's published in a peer-reviewed
journal — anyone can send a journal fabricated
or selected data, and no reviewer could detect it if
it was done cleverly," Weissman says. "We all wait
for independent, well-qualified labs to repeat the
findings. And if the discovery is robust, we expect
that it will be revealed however one approaches
the problem. So this is not new to the research
community, and will not affect those who wish to
carry forward the research."
Scott says he agrees that stem-cell research will
continue and that historically, fraud occurs infre
quently.
"The stem-cell field will move on," he says.
"Even South Korea boasts over one hundred re
searchers who focus on nuclear transfer."
Credit does belong to Hwang, however, for
being the first to clone a dog— the panel and in
dependent testing on the part of Nature have ver
ified these results.

cell lines from the embryos," the International
Herald Tribune reported on Jan. 12.
Embryonic stem cells have the potential to dif
ferentiate, or mature, into other kinds of cells —
from organ cells, to skin cells, to bone cells. Al
though the mechanism by which the body signals
a stem cell to become a specific kind of cell re
mains unknown, many researchers consider stem
cells to hold great promise for people suffering
from debilitating diseases such as Alzheimer's and
AIDS.The hope is that stem cells could one day be
used to replace cells damaged by illness.
Research in this area is contentious, however,
because embryonic stem cells remain the only
type of stem cells that can differentiate into other
types of mature cells. To obtain stem cells, re
searchers must extract them from viable, fertilized
embryos. This destroys the embryo, creating con
troversy over the ethics of the process.
In the Aug. 2001 edition of the newsletter Fal
well Confidential, Southern Baptist minister Jerry
Falwell denounced it as the"the destruction of one
life to save another."
Hwang claimed in his 2005 paper to have creat
ed stem cell lines that genetically matched specific
patients by removing the nucleus of an egg and re
placing it with a skin cell from the patient. Extract
ed stem cells from this embryo could then be trans
planted to the patient without inciting any negative
immune response, since the donor material would
be a perfect genetic match to that of the patient.
Known as schematic cell nuclear transfer, this
process was used to clone Dolly the sheep.

rrom a basic
human standpoint,
the biggest disap
pointment is that
the lies and decep
tion have dashed the
hopes of patients and
their families who

looked to South
Korea as a place that
understood the need to

move this research
ahead to alleviate human
suffering" says Christopher

Scott, executive director of the
Stanford Program on Stem Cells and

Society. "The fact that more human suf
fering has been created by the controver
sy is perhaps the saddest thing of all."

In addition to the fraudulent aspects
of Hwang's work, his research meth-

ods were unsound. He admitted in
November that some of the egns

used in his research were ob
tained from females who

worked in the lab. Irving
Weissman, a Stanford profes-

sor of developmental biolo
gy, explains that this was
"not allowable as his au-

thority over thein could
not have allowed free choice."
Weissman adds that this could not occur at
Stanford, given the amount of oversight present
and because junior faculty are independent — un
like the hierarchy present in Hwang's lab.
"In the United States,every faculty member is in
dependent in deciding what research line they wish
to follow, each grant they submit, etc.," Weissman
says."ln many countries, the funds flow to the senior
professor, who hires and funds the associate and as
sistant professors. ITiis gives the professor enormous
power over the ideas and careers of the faculty
under him or her. I don't know the exact hierarchy
in Hwang's lab, but it follows the latter tradition."
Scott adds that Hwang's actions were wrought
with other ethical violations.
"It is clear that he was at the very least inatten
tive to the results coming from his own lab and
those of his collaborators, and at worst he knew the
data was false and lied about it." Scott says."He
was cavalier about the way he procured eggs from
his female associates, and iunorcd well-known eth

ical rules about informed consent. Most tellingly,
Hwang is guilty of a profound hubris — the only
explanation for his globe-trotting behavior based
on what we know now was a house of cards."
Negative consequences from this work were
also felt by other researchers. Weissman says that
Hwang's reported success with schematic cell nu
clear transfer "had the effect of dampening other
labs to develop any other method, as obtaining
eggs for less efficient methods would not pass
medical ethical oversight."
Finally, the incident carries consequences for
scientific journals.
"The way in which his experiments were ac
cepted into Science will be examined," Scott says.
"TTie journal's editor in chief. Donald Kennedy,
announced yesterday that the magazine would re
view the procedures for peer-review."
Weissman argues that it takes more than publi
cation in a respected journal fora finding to be ac
cepted.

"Most scientists don't accept a finding as true
simply because it's published in a peer-reviewed
journal — anyone can send a journal fabricated
or selected data, and no reviewer could detect it if
it was done cleverly," Weissman says. "We all wait
for independent, well-qualified labs to repeat the
findings. And if the discovery is robust, we expect
that it will be revealed however one approaches
the problem. So this is not new to the research
community, and will not affect those who wish to
carry forward the research."
Scott says he agrees that stem-cell research will
continue and that historically, fraud occurs infre
quently.
"The stem-cell field will move on," he says.
"Even South Korea boasts over one hundred re
searchers who focus on nuclear transfer."
Credit does belong to Hwang, however, for
being the first to clone a dog— the panel and in
dependent testing on the part of Nature have ver
ified these results.

In 2004, South Korea's "Supreme Scientist"
Hwang Woo-suk, published a paper in the jour
nal Science claiming to have cloned a human
embryo and extracted stem cells from it. Hwang
was immediately hailed for his major accomplish
ment in stem-cell research.
But last Tliesday, a Seoul National University
panel investigating the veracity of Hwang's work
determined that this claim was false. This follows
closely on the heels of the panel's finding last
month that Hwang's other watershed paper — in
which he claimed to tailor stem-cell lines to specif
ic patients — also contained falsified data.
Hwang has since apologized and resigned from
his position at the university. According to The
Korea Times, he may now face prosecution for
fraud and/or embezzlement of government funds.
"His research team did create some cloned
human embryos but advanced only to an early
stage in a delicate procedure of extracting stem
cell lines from the embryos," the International
Herald Tribune reported on Jan. 12.
