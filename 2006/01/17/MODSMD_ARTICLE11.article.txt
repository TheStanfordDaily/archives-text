# Intel-based processors give Apple some extra crunch
## 
### 
This week. Mac aficionados descended
on San Francisco's Moscone center for
Macworld, the one-week expo con
cerned with everything Apple.
The conference floor buzzed with life. As
flabby programmers flirted with young fe
male trade reps. iPod gizmos and gadgets
vied for space among rows of gleaning new
Intel-based laptops. Apple put on an impres
sive show.
The Macworld expo offers the perfect op
portunity to reflect on some of Apple's new
innovations. Mac users will benefit from the
new Intel processor and an overhaul of the
iLife software suite. The rest of the world
may appreciate some lesser-known progress
that Apple has made over the past few
months to bring 11.264 — a new. high-quality
video standard — to the Internet.
Bait and Switch
The biggest news from the conference was
that Apple has switched away from IBM's
PowerPC processor a new line of Intel-based
processors. This has been a long anticipated
transition, but most doubted that Apple
would release the new Intel machines so early.
For years, Apple used IBM's PowerPC
processor to run its computers. Rumors
abounded that the IBM processor wasn't up
to par with the more efficient Intel processor
in PC computers and laptops. Although
Apple made progress by releasing a new
iMac with a faster IBM G5 processor,
Apple's premiere laptop line — the Power-
Book — was stuck with a slower (14 proces

sor. Pundits speculated that the G5 processor
was too power hungry and dissipated too
much heat to fit into the sleek body of a
Powerßook.
All of that changed when Apple's Chief
Executive Officer Steve Jobs unveiled a new.
faster iMac and a Powerbook renamed the
MacßookPro. While the iMac looks un
changed and the MacßookPro retains its
shiny aluminum casing and translucent
Apple logo, both computers now run off of a
new Intel Dual Core Duo processor. Apple
claims the processor is up to four times faster
than its predecessors. Both computers have a
built-in iSight Web camera with remote con
trol, and the laptop comes with a nifty, trip
proof magnetic power cord.
After toying around with the new laptop.
I think Mac users will be pleased. It is every
thing the old laptops were — but faster.
I)o I Stay or Do I Go Now?
If you're looking to buy a Mac, you should
jump in now and get the new Intel machines.
Buying a G5 or G4 machine now would be a
mistake, as the Intel processors are clearly

the wave of the future.
But if you already own a Mac, there's no
need to toss out your old Ci 4 laptop just yet.
The new Intel machines don't benefit from
their fast processors when running most ex
ternal software such as Microsoft Word. For
the time being, these programs are run
through a translator called Rosetta that al
lows the old PowerPC software to speak to
the new Intel processor. I Jntil Microsoft and
Adobe release new versions of their software
specifically designed for the Intel Apples,
Mac users should not feel compelled to give
up their current machines.
Lights, Camera, Action
For the % percent of computer users who
don't choose Apple, the new Intel Macs don't
really change much. Apple, however, has
made some quieter adjustments to which Mac
and non-Mac users alike should pay attention.
Apple, for example, is pushing the new
11.2M video standard which shows promise
at becoming a de facto standard for video on
the Web.
For years, no one could agree on any for
mat for sending video. Browsing the Web al
ways seemed to require at least three video
players, including Apple's Quicktime, Mi
crosoft's Windows Media Player and Real
Network's Real Player.
II dot what?
Although they all try to accomplish the
same thing, not all video algorithms — or

codecs — are equal. Stupid codecs send a se
ries of pictures one after another and the
computer displays it. Smarter codecs use
high-level tricks to save themselves from
sending images. For instance, a clever codec
will send one image and then tell the comput
er how to change it. over time. Rather than
send a new image, a codec might say, "move
this clump of pixels over" or "make every
thing darker." It also might send more infor
mation to parts of the video that has lots of
action and less to parts that have dark shad
ows. These higher-level directives save pre
cious network bandwidth and allow the
codec to cram more information and bigger
images at better resolutions down the same
Internet connection.
Unfortunately, no one has ever been able
to agree on a clever way for sending video in
a wide range of situations. Microsoft's Win
dows Media 4 codec came very close, but it
was closed-source and only Microsoft knew
how it works. MPEG-2 worked well for
DVDs and MDTV broadcasts hut it didn't
work well for streaming. This past year, how
ever, the international standards body ITIJ-
T finalized the H. 264 standard — a very ro
bust video codec that uses all the tricks in the
book to send high quality video through slow
connections.
One Standard to Rule them All
H.2f>4 could finally be the one standard
for video that almost everyone will use.
H.2M is already widely used in the video sur
veillance industry and it's a required stan

dard on both new HDTV-DVD formats.
ITianks to Apple's inclusion in Quicktime 7.
11.264 is also gaining traction online.

Quicktime 7 at http://quicktime.com or grab

head to http://apple.com/trailers/ and check
out a movie trailer in 11.264. One of the ad
vantages of 11.264 is that the algorithm works
on a wide range of screen sizes from 11DTV
resolution down to an iPod. On my tests,
11.264 looks pristine with almost lossless
video quality even though it compresses to
si/es comparable to low quality DivX or
MP! (i videos.

out the "Behnid the Scenes" footage to see
how they did it. Both of these videos arc in
11.264 and in both cases, the quality makes
the video.
Unfortunately. 11.264 is not for the light of
heart. Compression comes at a cost. You'll
need at least a fairly recent computer to
watch 11.264 video. My old PowerMac G4
444 Mhz lacks the computing power to play
11.264 in realtime.
A new Intel iMac. however, will have no
problems. Once again Apple puts on an im

up their current machines.
Lights, Camera, Action
For the % percent of computer users who
don't choose Apple, the new Intel Macs don't
really change much. Apple, however, has
made some quieter adjustments to which Mac
and non-Mac users alike should pay attention.
Apple, for example, is pushing the new
11.2M video standard which shows promise
at becoming a de facto standard for video on
the Web.
For years, no one could agree on any for
mat for sending video. Browsing the Web al
ways seemed to require at least three video
players, including Apple's Quicktime, Mi
crosoft's Windows Media Player and Real
Network's Real Player.
II dot what?
Although they all try to accomplish the
same thing, not all video algorithms — or

codecs — are equal. Stupid codecs send a se
ries of pictures one after another and the
computer displays it. Smarter codecs use
high-level tricks to save themselves from
sending images. For instance, a clever codec
will send one image and then tell the comput
er how to change it. over time. Rather than
send a new image, a codec might say, "move
this clump of pixels over" or "make every
thing darker." It also might send more infor
mation to parts of the video that has lots of
action and less to parts that have dark shad
ows. These higher-level directives save pre
cious network bandwidth and allow the
codec to cram more information and bigger
images at better resolutions down the same
Internet connection.
Unfortunately, no one has ever been able
to agree on a clever way for sending video in
a wide range of situations. Microsoft's Win
dows Media 4 codec came very close, but it
was closed-source and only Microsoft knew
how it works. MPEG-2 worked well for
DVDs and MDTV broadcasts hut it didn't
work well for streaming. This past year, how
ever, the international standards body ITIJ-
T finalized the H. 264 standard — a very ro
bust video codec that uses all the tricks in the
book to send high quality video through slow
connections.
One Standard to Rule them All
H.2f>4 could finally be the one standard
for video that almost everyone will use.
H.2M is already widely used in the video sur
veillance industry and it's a required stan

dard on both new HDTV-DVD formats.
ITianks to Apple's inclusion in Quicktime 7.
11.264 is also gaining traction online.

Quicktime 7 at http://quicktime.com or grab

out a movie trailer in 11.264. One of the ad
vantages of 11.264 is that the algorithm works
on a wide range of screen sizes from 11DTV
resolution down to an iPod. On my tests,
11.264 looks pristine with almost lossless
video quality even though it compresses to

out the "Behnid the Scenes" footage to see
how they did it. Both of these videos arc in
11.264 and in both cases, the quality makes
the video.
Unfortunately. 11.264 is not for the light of

need at least a fairly recent computer to
watch 11.264 video. My old PowerMac G4
444 Mhz lacks the computing power to play
11.264 in realtime.
A new Intel iMac. however, will have no

Tech Talk
This week. Mac aficionados descended
on San Francisco's Moscone center for
Macworld, the one-week expo con
cerned with everything Apple.
The conference floor buzzed with life. As
flabby programmers flirted with young fe
male trade reps. iPod gizmos and gadgets
vied for space among rows of gleaning new
Intel-based laptops. Apple put on an impres
sive show.
The Macworld expo offers the perfect op
portunity to reflect on some of Apple's new
innovations. Mac users will benefit from the
new Intel processor and an overhaul of the
iLife software suite. The rest of the world
may appreciate some lesser-known progress
that Apple has made over the past few
months to bring 11.264 — a new. high-quality
video standard — to the Internet.
Bait and Switch
The biggest news from the conference was
that Apple has switched away from IBM's
PowerPC processor a new line of Intel-based
processors. This has been a long anticipated
transition, but most doubted that Apple
would release the new Intel machines so early.
For years, Apple used IBM's PowerPC
processor to run its computers. Rumors
abounded that the IBM processor wasn't up
to par with the more efficient Intel processor
in PC computers and laptops. Although
Apple made progress by releasing a new
iMac with a faster IBM G5 processor,
Apple's premiere laptop line — the Power-
Book — was stuck with a slower (14 proces

sor. Pundits speculated that the G5 processor
was too power hungry and dissipated too
much heat to fit into the sleek body of a
Powerßook.
All of that changed when Apple's Chief
Executive Officer Steve Jobs unveiled a new.
faster iMac and a Powerbook renamed the
MacßookPro. While the iMac looks un
changed and the MacßookPro retains its
shiny aluminum casing and translucent
Apple logo, both computers now run off of a
new Intel Dual Core Duo processor. Apple
claims the processor is up to four times faster
than its predecessors. Both computers have a
built-in iSight Web camera with remote con
trol, and the laptop comes with a nifty, trip
proof magnetic power cord.
After toying around with the new laptop.
I think Mac users will be pleased. It is every
thing the old laptops were — but faster.
I)o I Stay or Do I Go Now?
If you're looking to buy a Mac, you should
jump in now and get the new Intel machines.
Buying a G5 or G4 machine now would be a
mistake, as the Intel processors are clearly

the wave of the future.
But if you already own a Mac, there's no
need to toss out your old Ci 4 laptop just yet.
The new Intel machines don't benefit from
their fast processors when running most ex
ternal software such as Microsoft Word. For
the time being, these programs are run
through a translator called Rosetta that al
lows the old PowerPC software to speak to
the new Intel processor. I Jntil Microsoft and
Adobe release new versions of their software
specifically designed for the Intel Apples,
Mac users should not feel compelled to give
up their current machines.
