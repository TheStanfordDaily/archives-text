## Editorial Shopping period should be reconfigured 
### 
Stanford students are currently midway
through the so-called "shopping peri
od," during which they may attend var
ious classes without consequence before
submitting a final schedule at the end of the
second week. As most students are intensely
aware at this time, the shopping period has
various kinks that should be addressed.
The theory behind the shopping period is
that students should be allowed to attend the
first class sessions of as many courses as they
would like, in order to see which courses
they wish to take without being penalized
for missing the first several classes.
That theory', however, rarely translates
into successful practice. Any science or math
major can tell you that missing the first week
of lectures will not just put you hopelessly
behind in the material, but also may cause
you to miss the first problem set.
Any social sciences or humanities major
can tell you that if you eagerly enter an
upper-level seminar during week two and
expect to jump right in, you'll likely be
laughed out of the classroom both by the
professor who probably had to turn away
dozens of students the week before and by
the few remaining students who had to jump
through hoops just to stay there.
There's a noticeable disconnect between
the shopping period policy at a University
wide level and in the actual implementation
in individual classes. Some seminars require
students to register weeks ahead and to have
done several readings before the first class
meets, though this is often not publicized in
the Time Schedule or on Axess. Veteran
seminar attendees know to always shop
seminars over lectures and to enroll long be
fore the quarter starts.
Even lecture classes often assign section
times before the second week, meaning that
jumping into a lecture during week two may
result in a headache and additional paper
work. not to mention a backlog of reading
assignments.
It is understandable that professors have
these policies: The quarter system is already
short enough, and losing the first two weeks
to the shopping period results in a precious

few weeks of actual class sessions.
The University could do several things to
alleviate these problems and find a compro
mise between students who want time to
knowledgeably pick classes and professors
who want to hit the ground running.
First, professors should be required to
post course syllabi on Coursework, allowing
students to access them prior to or concur
rent with the shopping period.This is done at
many schools, such as MIT. Currently, few
syllabi are easily accessible because profes
sors don't like to post them, mostly out of a
concern that their classes may be copied at
other schools. Limiting access to Course
work registrants effectively keeps the syllabi
within the University population.
However, you should not be required to
be enrolled in the course on Axess to view
the syllabus. litis is currently the case for
many classes, which is a burdensome and un
necessary rule. With units capped at 20, stu
dents may not view unlimited syllabi unless
they constantly add and drop classes on
Axess. Coursework users should simply be
able to look at any and all syllabi they wish
to examine on the Web site.
Allowing students to access syllabi may
also cut down on the necessity to shop in the
first place: knowledge of the course curricu
lum. the readings, the assignments and due
dates often plays a large role in class selection.
Second, the University needs to clarify
what the shopping period technically means
for seminars and lectures, and professors
should help make it clearer. If a seminar's
limited participants are selected at the first
meeting, this should be indicated in the Time
Schedule and on Axess. How participants
are selected (by essay, by seniority or major,
etc.) should also be spelled out. If a lecture
requires some sort of mandatory first-day or
first-week attendance, this too should be
mentioned.
Stanford's shopping period is a noble ef
fort to give students time to explore classes. It
should remain. But as the policy stands now.it
does a disservice to many students who find
out too late that missing that first class session
leaves them shut out altogether.
