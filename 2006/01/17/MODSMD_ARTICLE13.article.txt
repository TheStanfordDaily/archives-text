# Car culture: One man's struggles with the beast
## 
### 
Being from New York City means
never needing to learn to drive. Pub
lic transportation makes it unneces
sary and Manhattan traffic makes it unbear
able. Also, the taxi drivers are all insane,
garage parking is as expensive as a studio
apartment and street parking requires mov
ing your car to the other side of the street
every morning. So I skipped the whole turn
-16-get-your-license rite of passage.
As a high school graduation present, my
aunt gave me money toward driving lessons.
She told me in no uncertain terms that in
California I would need to know how to
drive — she also told me that the correct
drink to order in a bar is "Old number
seven, straight up, water chaser."
Of course I spent the summer after grad
uation doing nothing. With only three weeks
left, I called a random driving school from
the phonebook. Three weeks to get my li
cense, and I'd never been behind the wheel
of a car before. I managed to squeeze nine
driving lessons into those weeks with Lenny
from the Ukraine, who would yell "Gas!
Gas! Give it gas! You drive like old woman!"
Lenny didn't expect me to get my license.
But I passed. Five left turns, five right
turns, a three-point U-turn and an almost
abortive parallel park — 1 was clearly fully
qualified to operate a motor vehicle. After
this, I became petrified of being in a car — if
I could get a license without actually know
ing how to drive, then all the other drivers
on the road could be just as unqualified and
incompetent as I was. This explained a lot
about cab drivers.
I flew to Stanford the next day and didn't
drive again fora year.
It wasn't until the start of junior year that
I decided I needed a car. I thought it was an
important part of being a good staff mem
ber. So I started the completely unforgiving
task of buying a used car.
Buying a used car without already own
ing a car is nearly impossible. People selling
their cars generally live in places that are in
accessible by public transportation; other
wise they probably wouldn't have a car. I felt
terrible asking my friends to take many
hours out of their day to drive me to see a
car I probably wouldn't buy.
Every car had something horribly wrong
with it. The first looked great on paper, but
when I went to see it, I found a riced Accord
with an after-market muffler and racing ped
als. The seller had a complicated story ex
plaining that he was selling the car fora
friend's lawyer's girlfriend who was in Japan.
The next car looked good on su.market.

but had recently been backed into a bollard
and needed at least a thousand dollars in
cosmetic repairs. The owner asked if I was
planning on buying it for myself, because
the car had a Hello Kitty sticker permanent
ly attached to the gas tank. This was not the
car for me either.
Next up was a used car lot in Mountain
View. Something was off about the place —
the showroom was basically an alley, and the
sales office had no identifying signs. It felt so
seedy that my friend Jenna refused to get
out of her car, as she was convinced her car
would be sent to a chop shop if she did.
After uncomfortably waiting in the lot for
about a minute, she leaned over and said "I
think all these cars are stolen." I was tempt
ed to agree,so we sped out of there in search
of Indian food.
The car I finally bought — a full year
after I'd started the search — was the most
boring car possible. Hie only way I could
imagine my silver Corolla being more bor
ing is if it were Florida-Grandma-Gold. The
lone interesting thing about the car is that it
might be gay.
I blame the previous owner for my car's
questionable sexuality, for reasons which
will become apparent.
The transfer of ownership was horribly
awkward. 1 was in an altered state after hav
ing bleached the kitchen drains in Lambda
Nu; she was a meek Singaporean woman.
We co-signed the title and she asked if I
wanted her to lie about the selling price, so
my taxes would be cheaper. In a chemical
induced fit of social responsibility, I de
clined this offer. We walked out to the car
and she handed me the keys. Neither of us
knew what to do next — the transaction was
over, yet neither of us were ready to part
ways. She was giving up her car. I was giving
up a few thousand dollars. We both wanted
some greater finality to the sale.
She broke the silence — "I call the car
Jim. because the license plate says JMY."
"Well, that's stupid." I thought. "JMY
spells Jimmy." While I tried to come up with


David
Blackman
Blackman's Back
something better, 1 kept using
Jimmy as a temporary name.
"You can't have a car named
Jimmy," my friends said. "Your car
needs to have a girl's name."
1 tried to come up with female
names to fit the letters. Jamey
seemed like it might work, but was
rejected because it would need a
creative spelling, was too androgy
nous and was also the name of a girl
who was messing with my mind.
Jemmy, Jomy. Jammy and Jummy
were all rejected because they're
not real names.
"You can't have a car named
Jimmy," my friends reiterated. "It
sounds ... gay. Think about it:
What'd you do today?' 'Oh. Jimmy
and 1 went to the beach.' Also,
there's already a brand of car named
Jimmy."
"Well, you guys come up with a
girl's name," 1 said
"We did — Jamie," they replied.
Lately, my car has been giving me
greater reason to believe it is gay —
it doesn't like it when 1 go out with
women. On a recent date Jimmy de
cided he wanted to make me look
bad. Before the date even started, he
fired a warning shot by burning out
a window motor.
Jimmy waited until the end of the
date to play his ace — he locked the
steering column. 1 put my key in the

ignition, but it wouldn't turn at all. 1
stared confusedly at the wheel. I
looked at the girl. I tried to turn the
key again. I contemplated things,
looked at the girl, hit random but
tons like the rear defroster toggle,
looked helplessly at the wheel and
tried again, with no luck. 1 turned to
the girl, "Umm, well, umm, it's not
working [duh], 1 guess 1 can call
someone to pick you up. and I'll call
AAA and wait fora tow."
1 think she misheard me. Either
that or she wanted to get out of that
car as soon as possible, because she
immediately called a friend of hers
to pick her up. 1 swallowed my pride
and called my father who was asleep
on the opposite coast. ' Did you try
turning the wheel?" he asked.
Which of course worked instant
ly, for reasons I still do not under
stand at all — requiring the girl to
cancel her ride and bear another 15
minutes with me while I tried to re
gain lost ground due to failing the
man-machine battle.
I think Jimmy's plan succeeded.
When I asked her on a second date,
she responded with the humorously
broken logic "I'm really busy this
week — so I don't think it's going to
work out."

Dave would like anyone who can ex
plain how jiggling the steering wheel
can fix things to e-mail him at hlack
mad@stanford.edu. Also, he requests
that you tune in to KZSU every Mon
day night/Tuesday morning from
midnight to 3 a.m. to hear him play
music and hitch.
