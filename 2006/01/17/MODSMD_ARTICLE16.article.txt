# The 						10 people you didn't know you knew
## 
### 
Look at your roommate, clipping his
toenails with his foot propped on his
desk at an impossible angle. Is that a
future brain surgeon wielding those nail clip
pers? Or maybe your roomie is singing along
to the Spice Girls as she folds her laundry. Do
you see a future CEO behind that pile of
socks and underwear?
1 daresay it's hard to picture most Stan
ford students as anything but, well, college
kids. But. in just a few short years, we won't
be college kids anymore; we'll be out in the
real world, fending for ourselves. Making the
big bucks. Rolling in dough. (Personally. I'm
aiming for anything above bankruptcy.) In
typical Stanford fashion, we are all secretly
harboring lofty goals and aspirations behind
the carefree, apathetic facades we put up —
and, though we'd never admit it, we know we
have the talent to reach them.
Of course, there undoubtedly will be a
handful of our classmates who put even the
best of the rest of us to shame. And let's be
honest — when we're old, we'll want to be
able to annoy our grandkids by telling them
the same stories over and over about the peo
ple we knew back in the day. So here they are,
the ten people at Stanford who you should
make sure to get to know:
• The businessman
See that frat guy who's taking inventory to
see how many kegs he'll need for Friday
night? Give him a few years, and he'll be sell
ing shares of TAP on the floor of the NYSE.
• The Supreme Court justice
William Rehnquist and Sandra Day O'-
Connor dated while at Stanford Law School.
Then they met again years later... on the
Supreme Court. Awwwwkward. Moral: If

you have your sights set on the nation's high
est court. don't hook up with a guy who wants
to be the Chief Justice.
• The Olympic athlete
He may be at practice all day long, but if
you're lucky enough to catch lunch with your
dorm's resident track star, take the time to
get to know him., You don't want to be the
person who lived next door to Tiger Woods
but never spoke to him.
• The Nobel Peace Prize winner
Is your inbox overflowing with messages
pleading with you to donate to the latest
charity? Take the time to get to know the
sender; somebody who can be this selfless at
age 20 is definitely a person you'll want to
keep around.
• The next Bill Gates
He's at the computer LaIR 24/7, so you'll
just have to make it a point to go there and
find out more about this mysterious CS ge
nius. Hey, people marry for money all the
time...
• The person who will save your life
You had better be nice to the chemistry
major sitting across from you at dinner: one
of these days, you could be staring up at her

from an ER stretcher. (With any luck, she
won't remember how much you made fun of
her when she came home drunk that one
night.) Actually, with all the pre-meds there
are around here, it's probably a good idea just
to be nice to everybody.
• Kevin Bacon
Stanford has got its share of rich and fa
mous students — or, at any rate, students
who know rich and famous people. Maybe
one of them knows Kevin Bacon. Or knows
somebody who knows somebody who knows
somebody...yeah, you get the idea.
• The mad scientist
He may have failed chemistry, but it's not
because he didn't know his stuff. He was just
too busy plotting world domination to spend
time studying.
• The president
He flirts with every girl at the party, no
matter how homely she is. He compliments
all the guys on their mad dancing skills.
Everybody loves him. With schmoozing skills
like this, nobody can say for sure where he'll
end up immediately after the party, but you
can bet that it won't take long for him to find
his way to the White House after graduation.
• The hum
Because for some of us, the couldn't-care
less attitude isn't just a front. Besides, who
needs a job when you have connections with
all these successful Stanford people?

If you re going to do great things someday, in
troduce yourself to Stephanie so that she can
say that she knew you way hack when. Her e
