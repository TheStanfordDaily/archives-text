Strippers are athletes, too
I have been deeply troubled by the recent
strip club scandal involving Stanford's foot
ball recruits. I think the controversy brings up
a very serious question that has not yet been
addressed in any publication: Are strippers
not athletes too? Surely our venerable foot
ball program would not be under such harsh
criticism if the recruits had been taken to a
baseball game or perhaps a cricket match.
And yet. the players of those games work
only a fraction as hard as your typical exotic
dancer-athlete.
As we know at Stanford, every athlete
here is in fact a scholar-athlete. I am disgust
ed by the philistines who have picked up on
the scandal, only to analyze it on its most
shallow level. Of course the recruits enjoyed
the visceral pleasure of watching hot. sweaty
strippers gyrate to obscene hip-hop while
slipping dollar bills into their G-strings. How

ever. we must also ask ourselves about the
deeply cerebral message that the older mem
bers of the squad were trying to impart to the
recruits through this ritual.
Isn't it abundantly clear that the recruits
were being taught the importance of the
Protestant work ethic through this outing?
The recruits must have understood the juxta
position between their leisure and the physi
cal effort the strippers were displaying, which
in turn must have led to a monumental rever
sal of any sloth-like tendencies to a realiza
tion that one must work harder than his or
her opponent to obtain success.
Further, through exposing the recruits to
the rhythmic moves of the strippers, the play
ers were undoubtedly trying to teach the re
cruits the importance of grace, agility and el
egance in even the most barbaric of situa
tions. If hard work and a deep respect of craft
are lessons we do not wish to impart to our
athletes, then by all means continue this

witch hunt. But I think the current approach
shows a callous disregard for the hidden wis
dom of our football players and an even
stronger bias against the oft-discriminated
against stripper-athlete.

University should provide more
services during winter break
As an international student who stayed
on campus over winter break. 1 agree with
the opinions and concerns expressed by the
editorial "Students need housing options
during break" (Jan. 12). Instead of sleeping
on a mattress in the Hammarskjold lounge. I
was lucky enough to find vacant graduate
housing during the break; however. I still felt
a considerable level of inconven
ience due to fact that dining halls, li
braries, student centers, and trans
portation services cease service dur
ing the break.
This University-wide closure pol
icy, approved by the board of
trustees, seems reasonable from a fi
nancial perspective. However, it also
seems reasonable to ask the Univer
sity to consider providing more op
tions to international students who
remain on campus in December â€”
choosing not to fly home during the

time when international airfare is
the most expensive. Suggested meas
ures include arranging home stays
via the Bechtel International Cen
ter, opening Tresidder Express and
the first floor of Meyer, providing
regular Marguerite Shopping Ex
press service and organizing large
Christmas and New Year dinners. In
ternational students sacrifice many
opportunities of home visits and re
unions with families when they de
cide to study abroad at Stanford, and
the University should offer better
service to these students who are left
on an empty and inactive campus in
a cold and rainy season.
