lead to just 70-64.
"When they cut it to six, they had momentum;
they were playing really hard, and they weren't
going to quit." Wiggins said. "You could tell, even in
the last seconds of the game, they were still going
really hard."
However. Wiggins and the Cardinal proved too
much for the upstart Bears. Senior guard Krista
Rappahahn knocked down a three, and Wiggins
scored seven points in the game's final 4:15 to ice
the victory.
Cal (12-5,4-3 Pacific-10 Conference) and a scor

Freshman guard Rosalyn Gold-Onwude drives against Cal on Saturday. The Cardinal continued their recent dominance over the cross-bay
rival, though this time the Bears kept the Cardinal squad on its toes for much of the game.

bined 13-for-28 on threes.
"They were really focused on the
inside and were playing a zone, so
it's always really easy to get an open
shot," Wiggins said. "And if you got
it, shoot it."
Wiggins' 33 points were comple
mented by junior center Brooke
Smith's 22. As the Cardinal sharp
shooters heated up from outside,
Smith found additional room to op
erate down in the post.
Cal was without the services of
freshman center Devanei Hampton
(16 points, seven rebounds per
game), who was suspended fora vi
olation of team rules. Many in the
press believed the violation to be a
fight at a local high school, a claim

Cal's coaches would neither confirm
nor deny.
Filling Hampton's scoring void
was Gray-Lawson, who scored 30
against the Cardinal,including three
three-pointers. Freshmen Jene Mor
ris and Ashley Walker added with 17
and 14 points respectively
Despite the victory, VanDerveer
said the squad lacked much of the
energy it had shown recently, a had
sign for the tougher challenges to
come.
"1 don't think we played inspired
basketball," she said. "I honestly
think we looked tired.This isn't how
we have been playing the last couple
games, and this isn't going to help us
playing against Arizona. [No. 15]
Arizona State or going to LA, or
playing Cal again. I just feel that we
need to play with a lot more energy."
Outside of improved energy
level. VanDerveer added that her
squad needed additional scorers to
step up. Wiggins. Rappahahn and

Smith accounted for 73 of Stan
ford's 87 points. No other Cardinal
added more than six.
"We're clicking pretty well on
three cylinders, but I think we're
going to need more contributions
from more people," VanDerveer
said.
All told then. VanDerveer was
slightly disappointed with the victo
ry.
"We played like we got in a fight,
started getting a bloody nose and
then we started playing." she said.
"That's too late. ITiis is not a team
you can do that against."
Fora squad that last made the
NCAA Tournament in 1993, Cal
looks like a program on the up
swing. And despite the increasingly
real threat that the Bears represent,
Stanford players claim to be nothing
but excited for their cross-bay rivals.
"I think it's great for the Pac-1()
that we're [both] getting better, and
I think it's great for the Bay Area
that Cal's getting better," said
Smith, a Bay Area native. " Ihey're
much more competitive than they
have been in the past, and 1 think
that a rivalry will be good. We had a
good crowd out here, and if they're
good games [in the future], 1 think
that'll be good."
lor now. though, the Cardinal
have to focus on this season's chal
lenges. After Saturday's tired per
formance. VanDerveer said the
team will need to reevaluate its
practicing and preparation.
"The days of 30-, 39-point games
are long over, so I hope our team
comes out next time playing much
better than we've been playing."
VanDerveer said.
The Cardinal next host Arizona
on Ifuirsdav.
