# Cardinal wrestling falls hard against No. 4 Illinois
## 
### DENIS GRIFFIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's wrestlers expected No. 4 Illinois to
be a challenge. Hut Sunday at Burnham Pavil
ion, the Fighting I llini proved they were more
than a challenge — they proved to wrestle at an
entirely different level, sweeping the Cardinal
fora 39-0 decision.
The match opened with the lone ranked
Stanford (3-3) wrestler, sophomore captain Fan
ner Gardner (No. 11), taking on Kyle Ott (No. 3)
of Illinois (3-0) at 125-pounds.
The match was the closest of the dual, in
terms of both time and score. As the match
headed into the final seconds, the two wrestlers
were knotted at three. But with six seconds re
maining, Ott, a two-time NCAA Finalist.scored
a two-point takedown, claiming a 5-3 decision.
"(Gardner) gave him all he had and it came
down to a takedown at the end." head coach
Kerry McCoy said. "We were right in that
match, and a different ref. different time, maybe
we win that one."
McCoy pointed to Gardner's performance
when asked for positives that the Cardinal could
take away from the defeat.
"For him to go out there and be able to per
form that well against top-notch competition,
that's definitely encouraging," McCoy said.
"He's one of the leaders of the team. Me went
out and gave [Ott] everything he had."
It was all downhill from there, though, as
Stanford wrestlers lost the next eight matches.
The team also lost one match by forfeit.
Gardner cited his team's inability to make
adjustments and capitalize on their opportuni
ties as a major issue in the Cardinal loss.
"We just need to make those little adjust
ments," Gardner said. "We need to get those

takedowns at the end of a match. We need to get
those takedowns on the edge when we're close
to getting them. We need to go after them and
win the close matches, and once we get over that
hump, we're going to be beating teams like that."
Indeed, the Illini did seem to avoid several
takedowns by escaping out of bounds or allow
ing the clock to expire. But coach McCoy em
phasized that there was more at the root of his
team's loss.
"Overall, I think our guys bought into the
hype of them being a top-ranked team," McCoy
said. "They're really tough, and we kind of went
out there and realized that and stopped realiz
ing that we're really good too. And that's one of
the negative things our guys didn't really be
lieve <tn the whole that we could win. And once
we get that belief, nothing's going to stop us."
Whether it's trepidation, talent or timing, a
39-0 drubbing implies that something isn't quite
right for Stanford. And with the meat of the sea
son fast approaching, the Cardinal need to find
that missing ingredient sooner rather than later.
"The guys just have to recover from this and
bounce back," McCoy said. "The goal is March
the N( A A Tournament and the Pac-lOTour
nament. We just have to use this to get better
and to fuel the lire. We know that we can do bet
ter than this in the long run."
Perhaps one consolation the Cardinal can
take from such a lopsided afternoon is that the
season remains young.
"Nothing changes," McCoy said. "From the
beginning, we set our goal, and this iv how we'll
get there. As time plays out, we're going to be
where we need to be at the end."
