# Honoring a Seattle Prep star's play
## 
### 
Forgive me if I pull just a bit for
an opposing player this Thursday
but one of my favorites is coming to
campus — Arizona guard Joy
Hollingsworth. She's the Wildcats'
leading scorer, averaging 14.6
points per game, but I know her as
the indomitable sparkplug in my
high school's championship run.
Despite having a legendary foot
ball coach on the staff, Seattle Prep
was first and foremost a basketball
school. Epic matchups with rivals
O'Dea and Rainier Beach kept the
gyms packed every year. There was
more than one occasion when
school was cancelled or shortened
to a half-day in order to give the
community a chance to support the
teams. 'ITiis was especially impor
tant on the days when both the
boys' and girls' teams played.
As a freshman in 1998 Joy broke
into the varsity lineup of a very tal
ented team.That year's tournament
was one we'd remember. The boys
did better than expected, the girls
exited earlier than we thought, and
we lost one of our most beloved
teachers. Many students and par
ents were at a state tourney game
when the PA announcer informed
us that Anne Jane Gleason, whose
daughter Erin part of Stanford?s
Class of 2005, had succumbed to
liver cancer.
With the team hit by graduation,
the sophomore Hollingsworth was
forced to become the star. Even that
early, she was growing into a com
plete player, with the ability to drive
inside, shoot the three and play
good one-on-one defense.
Although it didn't make the state
tournament, that team was great fun
to follow. I sort of felt badly for
them because the girls were lost in
the shadow of our top-ranked boys
team, which would send two play
ers, Erik Bond and Jeffrey Day, to
play in the Pacific-10 Conference. I
was friendly with a few of the girls
on the team and their point guard
was my senior prom date (hi, Kate),
so I made up my mind that if they
were going to have a student fan
base, I was going to be it.
1 gave them encouragement in
the hall, went to every game I could
and gave them props in the weight
room. I even took a cue from my
volleyball cheering days and paint
ed my face Panther blue and white.
It was important to let them know
they were appreciated. It went the
other way. too — Joy and her team
mates were big supporters of my
