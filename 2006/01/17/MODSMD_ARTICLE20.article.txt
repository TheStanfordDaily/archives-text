# Honoring a Seattle Prep star's play
## 
### 
Forgive me if I pull just a bit for
an opposing player this Thursday
but one of my favorites is coming to
campus — Arizona guard Joy
Hollingsworth. She's the Wildcats'
leading scorer, averaging 14.6
points per game, but I know her as
the indomitable sparkplug in my
high school's championship run.
Despite having a legendary foot
ball coach on the staff, Seattle Prep
was first and foremost a basketball
school. Epic matchups with rivals
O'Dea and Rainier Beach kept the
gyms packed every year. There was
more than one occasion when
school was cancelled or shortened
to a half-day in order to give the
community a chance to support the
teams. 'ITiis was especially impor
tant on the days when both the
boys' and girls' teams played.
As a freshman in 1998 Joy broke
into the varsity lineup of a very tal
ented team.That year's tournament
was one we'd remember. The boys
did better than expected, the girls
exited earlier than we thought, and
we lost one of our most beloved
teachers. Many students and par
ents were at a state tourney game
when the PA announcer informed
us that Anne Jane Gleason, whose
daughter Erin part of Stanford?s
Class of 2005, had succumbed to
liver cancer.
With the team hit by graduation,
the sophomore Hollingsworth was
forced to become the star. Even that
early, she was growing into a com
plete player, with the ability to drive
inside, shoot the three and play
good one-on-one defense.
Although it didn't make the state
tournament, that team was great fun
to follow. I sort of felt badly for
them because the girls were lost in
the shadow of our top-ranked boys
team, which would send two play
ers, Erik Bond and Jeffrey Day, to
play in the Pacific-10 Conference. I
was friendly with a few of the girls
on the team and their point guard
was my senior prom date (hi, Kate),
so I made up my mind that if they
were going to have a student fan
base, I was going to be it.
1 gave them encouragement in
the hall, went to every game I could
and gave them props in the weight
room. I even took a cue from my
volleyball cheering days and paint
ed my face Panther blue and white.
It was important to let them know
they were appreciated. It went the
other way. too — Joy and her team
mates were big supporters of my

fledgling rap career, so much so that
two of my five public appearances
involved the basketball team. (It was
a very short rap career.)
Their season was one of confu
sion and s—tumbling, until they exe
cuted a masterful comeback on the
road, outscoring the opponent 30-8
in the fourth period. With newfound
purpose, the very young team rode a
spirit that would not be extinguished
for over three years, and Joy brought
the skill, pride, dependability and
leadership.
Down the stretch, the squad sur
vived a series of elimination games
before finally being outed one win
away from State. The next season,
Joy brought renewed meaning to the
popular Seattle phrase "refuse to
lose", scoring the final 11 points of
the Metro League title game in 57
seconds, including the game-winning
three at the buzzer. At State, the
Panthers shook off an opening
round loss to the eventual champi
ons and won the next three games
for fifth place.

The season after that, Prep (in
cluding current Wildcat Ch? Oh)
beat hated rival Eastside Catholic to
win it all. I had a family friend tape
the game and mail it to me. 1 was all
smiles as the girls outfought a Cin
derella team that was the subject of
such serious recruiting allegations
that the coach left before the next
season.
Joy was masterful in her final
game, after which she was named
Tournament MVP and Washington
State Player of the Year. Even though
1 didn't get to see them at all that sea
son, I was there in the winter of 2(XX)
when the nucleus of the group started
to jell, and I was so proud to watch
them consummate success.
A cousin of former Washington
star Nate Robinson. Joy spent two
seasons at the San Francisco before
transferring to Arizona. Last year
she was named Most Inspirational,
despite having to redshirt the sea
son.
It's neat to be able to say "I knew
her when..."
Arizona is certainly glad they
know her now.
