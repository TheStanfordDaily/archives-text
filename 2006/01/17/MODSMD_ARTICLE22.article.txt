# Card go 0-2 over weekend
## Conference foes USC and Pepperdine defeat Stanford 
### ANDREW LOMELI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's volleyball team held high
hopes as it headed into this past weekend's
southern California road swing. But, despite its
optimism, the squad opened league play with
consecutive losses at the hands of Southern Cali
fornia and Pepperdine.
First, the Cardinal (1-5,0-2 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) fell to No. 12 Southern Cali
fornia on Saturday. 28-30,30-27,34-32,30-21.
The two squads battled for control through
out game one before a Trojan hitting error sealed
the deal for Stanford.
USC (3-2,2-0) was quick to retaliate in game
two, jumping to a 20-10 lead. Stanford pulled to
within one in the closing minutes, but the Trojans'
offense prevailed.

Stanford flew out of the gates in the third
game to claim early 11-5 and 22-18 advantages.
But USC slowly climbed out of its deficit to take
control at 23-22.The final rallies of the game held
the Lyons Center crowd in suspense well into
overtime before the Trojans squeaked out the
game.
USC easily sailed through the fourth game.
The Trojans opened a 10-point lead on the Cardi
nal at 23-13 and never looked back.
Stanford senior opposite Ben Reddy led both
tehms with 22 kills. Senior middle blocker Chris
Ahlfeldt paced the Cardinal defense with seven
blocks. The Trojans hit .381, compared to Stan
ford's .301.
"Coming off of the [UC-Santa Barbara] tour
nament, we played some pretty sloppy volley
ball," senior outside hitter William Clayton said.
"We really wanted to make improvements and
clean things up. We definitely can play better, bet
ter than we did this past weekend, and we're
going to need that in league play."
On Friday night, the Cardinal won the first
game against No. 3 Pepperdine (2-0.2-0) before

the Waves swept Stanford out of the building. 26-
30,30-18,31-29,30-24.
The Cardinal's game one momentum quickly
evaporated as the host Waves jumped to a dou
ble-digit victory in game two. Stanford posted an
impressive .394 hitting percentage in game three
but couldn't hang on in overtime.The Waves' ex
plosive offense never fell below .350 during the
match, driving the Waves to a six-point victory in
game four.
Reddy again led Stanford's offense with 17
kills. Junior libero Brian l.indberg paced the de
fense with 12 digs. Senior setter Jeremy Jacobs
added 42 assists. The contest was his first since
suffering an injury at the UCSB Elephant Bar
Tournament the previous weekend.
The Cardinal return home this weekend to
host UC-San Diego and Long Beach State Thurs
day and Friday, respectively.
"Our trajectory in practice the last few weeks
has been positive," Clayton added. "We need to
take the improvements and pick up on them. If
we do, we can play tough and get wins this next
weekend."
