## Paintball ticket vendor accused of fraud Police say tickets are real, students frustrated 
### ADA YEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For months, students have been say
ing that a man outside the Stanford
Bookstore representing Creative Mar
keting has been selling phony paintball
tickets. Cautionary tales of this alleged
scam have spread through word of
mouth and e-mails warning students
about the vendor have popped up on
dorm chatlists.
Freshmen Chris Lin and Patrick
Ardinger were convinced they them
selves nearly got scammcd out of $60

last week.
But to the frustration of many, the
Stanford Department of Public Safety
maintains no such scam exists.
"It's not a fake,"said Sergeant Hilary
Karp. " There is no criminal activity
going on."
Lin and Ardinger said they are not so
sure.
On Nov. l ), the two freshmen spotted
the booth on their way to purchase text
books. Hie vendor overheard Lin point
ing out the booth and approached them.
He offered to sell Lin and Ardinger
passes to a number of paintball fields
from around the area. Passes were being
sold in packs of 12 for $60, a large dis-

count fora package valued up
wards of $480.
The two students initially doubt
ed the legitimacy of the surprising
ly cheap tickets, but the vendor was
persistent â€” and persuasive.
"We were reluctant to buy at
first, and asked if we could come
back later," Lin said. "He said he
was leaving soon and offered us a
two-for-one deal."
"It was too good to be true,"
Ardinger added. "But the vendor
was a very smooth talker and a
good salesperson."
Lin. who was familiar with some
of the paintball fields listed on the
tickets, was convinced and pur
chased a set.
"There were really no creden
tials. but usually vendors in front of
the Bookstore are legitimate," he
said.
Later, friends told Lin and
Ardinger that a month previously,
they had bought passes which
proved to be phony. E-mails warn
ing students against purchasing the
tickets have been sent to the Le
land Stanford Junior Marching

Band chatlist as early as Dec. 12.
Lin returned to White Plaza imme
diately and successfully obtained a
refund. The bookstore declined to
comment to The Daily.
Sophomore Sunthar Premaku
mar, who saw the booth in the fall
and twice this quarter, had heard
similar news.
"I did see the guys outside the
Bookstore and it was very tempt
ing, because I love paintballing,"
Premakumar said. His roommate,
however, told him that the ticket
sale "had been happening fora
while" and was not legitimate.
"My roommate e-mailed the po
lice the second time he saw the ven
dors, which was last quarter," Pre
makumar said. "The police had
wanted him to call them the next
time he saw them. When he called
them up this time they had checked
it out and told him that they were
legitimate vendors."
Lin and Ardinger said they are
frustrated with the police as well,
after also being told that the opera
tion is legal.
"I talked to other classmates,
and it seems that the paintball peo
ple have been coming back every
quarter, every year," Lin said. "It's
disappointing that they've been
around on the campus so long that
the Stanford community knows

about it and yet nothing's been
done."
The vendor, whose passes are la
beled "Paintball USA," claims to
work fora Napa firm called Cre
ative Marketing and provided Lin
with a phone number and address.
The phone number is out of service,
and although internet maps indicate
that the building address does exist,
the apartment number is not listed.
Sergeant Karp said the police
stand by their position.
"If there is intent to defraud, we
take whatever action is appropri
ate: arrest or bring a charge to the
D.A.,"'Karp said, who had read a
brief on the incident but was not as
signed to the case. "All I know is
that the officers checked it out, and
everything was legitimate."
Unable to appease the students,
Karp could only offer some buying
advice.
"If something is too good to be
true, you've got to be suspicious of
it," Karp offered. "And as far as I
know, the tickets were being sold at
a pretty good price."
Premakumar agreed, but took a
slightly different stance.
"I'm surprised that other stu
dents haven't realized this yet," he
said. "It is stupid for anyone to
think that people would sell a $40
pass for $5."
