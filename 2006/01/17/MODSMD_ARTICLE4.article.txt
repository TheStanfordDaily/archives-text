# I guess Chris shot the ball 100 percent. I'm not a math guy, but 6-for-6, that's pretty good.

As it headed into Friday night's visit
from California, the Stanford men's bas
ketball's season was in dire straits. Hie
team stood only .500. and a loss would
leave the chances of a 12th straight NCAA
berth hanging by a thread.
Now, at least for the time being. Cardi
nal faithful can breathe easier. Stanford (7-
6,3-2 Pacific 10 Conference) looked confi
dent late against the Golden Bears and
pulled away fora 75-61 victory.
"We probably played as well as we've
played all year." coach Trent Johnson said.
"We probably played the best team we've
played to this date."
Senior forward Matt Haryasz also
called the performance Stanford's best this %
season.
"This was a big game for us and 1 think
we took it as a challenge," Haryasz said.
"Cal's solid across the floor. Ihey don't
have a spot where you can exploit."
Haryasz led all scorers with 24 points in
what Johnson deemed his best game this
season.
Senior guard Chris Hernandez added
20 points on perfect shooting from the
field, including 5-of-5 on three-pointers.
Hernandez became just the 34th Cardinal
to top the 1,000-point career mark in 93
years of Stanford basketball.
While Hernandez downplayed a night
when he literally could not miss — and the
career accomplishment — Haryasz cer
tainly took good-natured pride.
"I guess Chris shot the ball 100 per
cent," Haryasz said. "I'm not a math guy
but 6-for-6, that's pretty good."
The discrepancy in the teams' free
throw shooting almost exactly accounted
for the 14-point margin of victory. Both
teams entered shooting over 70 percent
from the line, but Stanford shot a season
best 90 percent (17-of-19), while Cal (9-5,
3-2) shot a season-worst 46 percent.
"I think it's a different game if we can
knock down some free throws," Cal coach
Ben Braun said. "We have no one to blame
but us. When you shoot I l-of-24 from the
free throw line, you're not brimming with
confidence."
Stanford suffered a scare as they
watched a 37-31 halftime lead shrink to
just 53-52. Cal forward Leon Powe (19
points, 10 rebounds) made his first four
shots of the half to pull the visitors within
one.
