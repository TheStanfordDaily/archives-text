# I guess Chris shot the ball 100 percent. I'm not a math guy, but 6-for-6, that's pretty good.

As it headed into Friday night's visit
from California, the Stanford men's bas
ketball's season was in dire straits. Hie
team stood only .500. and a loss would
leave the chances of a 12th straight NCAA
berth hanging by a thread.
Now, at least for the time being. Cardi
nal faithful can breathe easier. Stanford (7-
6,3-2 Pacific 10 Conference) looked confi
dent late against the Golden Bears and
pulled away fora 75-61 victory.
"We probably played as well as we've
played all year." coach Trent Johnson said.
"We probably played the best team we've
played to this date."
Senior forward Matt Haryasz also
called the performance Stanford's best this %
season.
"This was a big game for us and 1 think
we took it as a challenge," Haryasz said.
"Cal's solid across the floor. Ihey don't
have a spot where you can exploit."
Haryasz led all scorers with 24 points in
what Johnson deemed his best game this
season.
Senior guard Chris Hernandez added
20 points on perfect shooting from the
field, including 5-of-5 on three-pointers.
Hernandez became just the 34th Cardinal
to top the 1,000-point career mark in 93
years of Stanford basketball.
While Hernandez downplayed a night
when he literally could not miss — and the
career accomplishment — Haryasz cer
tainly took good-natured pride.
"I guess Chris shot the ball 100 per
cent," Haryasz said. "I'm not a math guy
but 6-for-6, that's pretty good."
The discrepancy in the teams' free
throw shooting almost exactly accounted
for the 14-point margin of victory. Both
teams entered shooting over 70 percent
from the line, but Stanford shot a season
best 90 percent (17-of-19), while Cal (9-5,
3-2) shot a season-worst 46 percent.
"I think it's a different game if we can
knock down some free throws," Cal coach
Ben Braun said. "We have no one to blame
but us. When you shoot I l-of-24 from the
free throw line, you're not brimming with
confidence."
Stanford suffered a scare as they
watched a 37-31 halftime lead shrink to
just 53-52. Cal forward Leon Powe (19
points, 10 rebounds) made his first four
shots of the half to pull the visitors within
one.
However, that was as close as Cal
would get. Five different Cardinal
combined for scores in a 15-4 run
that put Stanford ahead 70-57 with
4:20 to play. Cal never closed to with
in 10 again.
Powe was quiet during that Cardi
nal run and for most of the game, out
side his spurt to start the second half.
Post-game, Stanford players cred
ited sophomore forward Taj Finger
for shutting down a player Johnson
called "the best we've faced all year".
Finger said a combination of
more desire and knowledge of
Powe's tendencies led to his success.
"1 watched a lot of film on Powe
and knew exactly what he wanted to
do "Finger said. "[I thought] I might
not be as strong, but if I play more

physical against him, maybe I'll do
better."
Players said that an entire week of
preparation for Cal led to scouting
and play-calling that enabled their
success. Notably, Hernandez credited
screens drawn up this past week for
his flawless shooting from the field.
For his part, Johnson felt the rea
son for recent success after early-sea
son struggle is much simpler.
"For whatever reason, we're just
competing harder," Johnson said.
The players had been waiting for
this type of game all season.
"When I came in as a freshman,
Stanford had always been a winning
program and a top 25 team," Finger
said. "We have great players. We
have desire. I just knew we'd come

together."
Stanford's first three-game win
ning streak of the season moves the
squad above .500 for the first time
since November and into a tie for
second in the conference with Cal,
Washington (14-2. 3-2) and Oregon
(9-8, 3-2). Those four teams are a
half-game behind league-leader
UCLA (14-3. 4-2), who lost starting
forward Josh Shipp for the season
last week.
The victory continues Stanford's
recent dominance over Cal. The Car
dinal have won 16 of the last IS over
their cross-bay rivals, including six in
a row.
Stanford next plays at Arizona
(10-6. 3-3) on Thursday and at Ari
zona State (7-8,1-5) on Saturdav.
