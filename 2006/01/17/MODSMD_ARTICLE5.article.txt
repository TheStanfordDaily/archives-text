# Facts emerge in AD lawsuit
## Strip club visit forced recruiting policy alteration 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Sheryl Kanzaki, a former Stanford
Athletic Department accountant, is
suing the University and Senior Associ
ate Athletic Director Debra Gore-Mann
for wrongdoings she claims occurred
while employed at the University from
2001 to 2005. Many considered Gore-
Mann a likely replacement for outgoing
Athletic Director Ted (.eland before the
story broke last week.
Her suit, which seeks millions in dam
ages. alleges that the University did not
respond when she received a death
threat at work. She claims the University
summarily dismissed qualms she raised
about receipts, especially those that
showed Stanford football players taking
recruits to the New Century Theater — a

San Francisco strip club —on official
visits. Kanzaki also claims that the Uni
versity acted illegally in not accommo
dating her disabilities that resulted from
a fall in a Stanford parking lot and com
plications following a hysterectomy. Fi
nally, she claims the University effective
ly, and wrongly, fired her on Nov. 2,2(H)5.
The University's standard policy of
not commenting tin the merit of ongoing
litigation limited the defense it could
mount. However, in several areas, and es
pecially on the points concerning the
strip club visits. Senior University Coun
sel Patrick Dunkley explained why he
believes Kanzaki's suit is inaccurate.
Dunkley also explained how the Athletic
Department has adjusted its recruiting
policies in the wake of the strip club trips
and a subsequent internal investigation.
