# Facts emerge in AD lawsuit
## Strip club visit forced recruiting policy alteration 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Sheryl Kanzaki, a former Stanford
Athletic Department accountant, is
suing the University and Senior Associ
ate Athletic Director Debra Gore-Mann
for wrongdoings she claims occurred
while employed at the University from
2001 to 2005. Many considered Gore-
Mann a likely replacement for outgoing
Athletic Director Ted (.eland before the
story broke last week.
Her suit, which seeks millions in dam
ages. alleges that the University did not
respond when she received a death
threat at work. She claims the University
summarily dismissed qualms she raised
about receipts, especially those that
showed Stanford football players taking
recruits to the New Century Theater — a

San Francisco strip club —on official
visits. Kanzaki also claims that the Uni
versity acted illegally in not accommo
dating her disabilities that resulted from
a fall in a Stanford parking lot and com
plications following a hysterectomy. Fi
nally, she claims the University effective
ly, and wrongly, fired her on Nov. 2,2(H)5.
The University's standard policy of
not commenting tin the merit of ongoing
litigation limited the defense it could
mount. However, in several areas, and es
pecially on the points concerning the
strip club visits. Senior University Coun
sel Patrick Dunkley explained why he
believes Kanzaki's suit is inaccurate.
Dunkley also explained how the Athletic
Department has adjusted its recruiting
policies in the wake of the strip club trips
and a subsequent internal investigation.
The Death Threat
I iled on Nov. IS, 2(X)5. the 35-page
complaint states that the trouble
began on March 3,2003, when Kan
zaki e-mailed Provost John
Etchemendy to inform him that de
spite a University-wide hiring
freeze, "certain positions were
being created for friends of Gore-
Mann." The complaint stated that
Etchemendy told Kanzaki she
"would not be implicated" for
telling him of Gore-Mann's alleged
hiring of friends.
Just five days later though, Kan -
zaki claims she received a death
threat via voicemail, which she re
ported to the Department of Public
Safety.
"It was a voicemail that indicat
ed she was being targeted." said
David Secrest, Kanzaki's lawyer."lt
was essentially a taunt that the indi
vidual harmed would come to her.
'Hit me with your best shot,' 'Only
the good die young,' and so on."
Two days later, on March 10,
2003, the suit alleges that Tiffany
Girouard, an employee in the
Human Resources Department,
told Kanzaki that Gore-Mann was
'"looking to find out who disclosed
this information.' Girouard then
told [Kanzaki] to 'be very careful,
because we all know how Gore-
Mann works."'
The suit alleges that Gore-Mann
took no formal action after being in
formed of the death threat. The
complaint claims this caused Kan
zaki "enduring and severe mental
aguish and emotional distress."
Gore-Mann declined comment
through Athletic Department
spokesman Gary Migdol. Migdol di
rected all queries to Dunkley, who
initially cited standard University
policy not to comment on the merits
of pending litigation, but allowed
himself to clarify what he viewed as
"misconceptions."
"My understanding is that no
one within the Athletic Department
was aware of the allegation of a
death threat until her complaint was
filed in November 2005," Dunkley
said."lt certainly was not brought to
the attention of the general counsel,
and when I spoke to the administra
tion, they were also unaware."

The Strip Club
The suit then alleges that Kanza
ki received several receipts for "al
cohol purchases by minors and strip
clubs in San Francisco." Specifically,
Kanzaki claims that the receipts
were "for $20 each for expenditures
at the New Century TTieater on
Larkin Street in San Francisco
whose online site advertises 'Lap
dances, video booths, VIP lounges.'"
Allegedly, Kanzaki notified her
immediate supervisor, Susanna
Ching, and Gore-Mann of the "na
ture of the receipts submitted." The
suit then claims that Ching asked
Kanzaki "to make copies of the re
imbursement requisition forms 'for
her files/ and Gore-Mann personal
ly took possession of the handwrit
ten receipts and requisition forms."
Kanzaki then states she discovered
the handwritten receipts "had been
destroyed or removed from the ap
propriate file" and replaced with
lost receipt memos.
"Why did they remove invoices
that minors were taken to strip
clubs and given alcohol?" Secrest
asked."! think the question answers
itself. All she did was try to report it
and do her job."
Dunkley acknowledged that
Stanford football players and re
cruits went to New Century Theater
on Jan. K) and 17.2003, but insisted
no cover-up took place.
"In the complaint, it's intended
to give the impression that there
was some sort of cover-up going on
with how receipts were handled,"
Dunkley said. "That couldn't be fur
ther from the truth."
He explained that under NCAA
procedures, student-athletes are
given $30 apiece to entertain a re
cruit and are required to submit re
ceipts showing that they actually
spent the money on recruits. Dunk
ley added that some Stanford foot
ball players initially submitted
handwritten documentation show
ing that they had gone to the New
Century Theater. However, because
they weren't actual receipts, the
Athletic Department then required
that those football players submit
lost receipt forms in place of hand
written documents.
"Kanzaki tries to make the case
that the use of those lost receipt
forms was a cover-up," Dunkley
said. "However, those lost receipt
forms actually say on their face the

amount spent and what it was spent
for — namely the entry fee for stu
dent-athletes and recruits. How
could you cover up something with
a form showing who spent money,
where they spent it and how much
they spent?"
Kanzaki alleges she met with
then-Athletic Director Ted Leland
on Aug. 13,2003, when she informed
him of the strip club visit and result
ing "accounting irregularities." She
also claims she told Leland that
Ching was harassing another Ath
letic Department accountant, and
that department employees were
not being paid for overtime work.
In spite of her complaints, Kan
zaki said Leland failed to act.
"I think the evidence will show
he basically called her a whiner be
hind her back and did nothing," Se
crest said.
The Athletic Department
Response
After the reimbursement re
quests for the New Century Theater
trip were submitted to the Athletic
Department, it conducted an inter
nal investigation. Football players
confirmed that they attended the
strip club. As a result, Dunkley said,
the University took three actions in
the spring and summer of 2003.
• The director of NCAA compli
ance met with the football team to
discuss appropriate activities and
behaviors when entertaining re
cruits. At that point, football players
were expressly told that visiting
strip clubs was not appropriate.
• Then-head football coach
Buddy Teevens met with the foot
ball team and stated that taking re
cruits to strip clubs was improper.
• The University reported to the
NCAA that three student-athletes
overspent the amount allowable
under NCAA rules by between $3
and $7 apiece.
While admitting that taking re
cruits on strip club visits was inap
propriate, and potentially in viola
tion of Stanford's Fundamental
Standard, Dunkley stressed that the
strip club visits were not in violation
of NCAA policy at the time. How
ever, NCAA rules have since
changed in the wake of a football re
cruiting scandal at the University of
Colorado.Today, taking recruits to a
strip club would violate NCAA pol-

Dunkley also insisted that the
Athletic Department acted respon
sibly.
"No coaches were involved in
this activity," Dunkley said. "The
University self-reported alleged
NCAA violations, and the Universi
ty then instituted policy that was
consistent with the meeting the di
rector of NCAA compliance had
with the football team."
The new policy Dunkley alluded
to is a written policy that he said bans
the "use of entertainment money for
any sexually-related purpose when
entertaining recruits." He added that
athletes are required to sign a form
acknowledging their compliance
with this policy both when receiving
money and when submitting reim
bursement requests.
Dunkley said this new policy was
implemented "shortly after the
events of January 2003" and that he
believes it was in place for the 2004
recruiting season.
When asked about the Universi
ty's liability when its students take
recruits, many of them under 18, to
an 18-and-over strip club, Dunkley
suggested that Athletic Department
employees may not have known the
nature of the New Century Theater.
"It says on the receipt New Cen
tury Theater", Dunkley said. "Until
now. 1 would have no way of know
ing that was an adult-entertainment
establishment or strip club. I can't
speak to what the person who re
viewed the form might have been
thinking, but to me that does not in
dicate these recruits being taken to
any place inappropriate."
Dunkley added that he believes
that the strip club has a responsibil
ity to ensure its patrons are over 18.
A man answering the phones at
the New Century Theater said their
policy was to ID anyone who looked
under 25. He declined to give his
name.
The Falling Out
Kanzaki stated she had a hys
terectomy on Aug. 18, 2003. She
claims that the surgery's aftermath
rendered her disabled under Cali
fornia law and that she did not re
turn until Oct. 13,2003.
Upon her return, Kanzaki said
that the University did not provide
the accommodations her doctor
recommended, namely "a reduction
in workload, reduction in hours and

frequent walks to ease pain and dis
tress." Kanzaki claimed she sent
three emails to Gore-Mann re
questing a meeting to discuss these
accommodations. Kanzaki also al
leged that this meeting never took
place, and, rendered unable to sit for
more than two hours straight, her
hours increased to over 80 per week
for the next year.
Over that year, the complaint de
tails three instances in which Kan
zaki suspected wrongdoing in the
Athletic Department and informed
Gore-Mann of her suspicions. In
every case, Kanzaki alleges Gore ei
ther did not respond or summarily
dismissed her worries. She also al
leges Gore-Mann personally turned
down her request fora transfer to
Track and Field that she claimed she
made in October 2003.
In October of the following year,
Kanzaki claimed a fall in a Stanford
parking lot left her unable to return
to work on campus until Feb. 22,
2005.
The suit then states that on Nov.
y, 2004, Gore-Mann met with Kan
zaki to discuss disability-related ac
commodations so that she could
work out of her home. Allegedly,
Gore-Mann then told Kanzaki "to
work in a more 'cooperative' man
ner, and to 'relinquish' certain deci
sion-making duties."
Kanzaki claims she e-mailed
Gore-Mann about these new re
strictions and was told to discuss
them in person, presumably so that
there would be no paper trial, ac
cording to the suit.
The complaint alleges that on the
day of her return, Kanzaki met with
Gore-Mann and Ron Coverson of
Stanford Human Resources. Hie
suit details that the two essentially
stripped her of her job responsibili
ties, so that she was '"going away'
from 'auditing' of reimbursement
requests, but was instead told to
'just review and post'... and that vio
lations were 'not your concern.'"
The suit then claims that, on
March 23, 2005, the University de
nied her disability leave after suffer
ing severe headaches that were later
diagnosed as severe depression.
Kanzaki claims that the University
replaced her position — effectively,
firing her — on Sept. 2,2005.
The Causes of Action:
The suit asks fora jury trial and

specifies 10 causes of action —
grievances for which a plaintiff
seeks monetary redress — against
the University, the Board of
Trustees and Gore-Mann.
The first six causes of action are
for violations of the California Fair
Employment & Housing Act and
the California Family Rights Act.
The six charges allege that Gore-
Mann and the University discrimi
nated against Kanzaki in light of her
disabilities and her rights as guaran
teed under the two acts.
Another cause of action charges
all three defendants with "inten
tional infliction of emotional dis
tress" and charges the University
with negligent retention, negligent
supervision and unfair business
practices. The unfair business prac
tices charge alleges that recruiting
improprieties such as the football
recruits' visit to the New Century
Theater gave Stanford an unfair ad
vantage over competing colleges in
the Pacific 10 Conference and the
NCAA.
The suit seeks "an amount not
less than $1 million"for each of the
10 causes of action, except for "un
fair business practices," in which a
monetary amount is not specified.
Accordingly, while the complaint
asks for at least million, Secrest
deemphasized the figure's impor
tance.
Secrest refused to say he was
suing the University for million
because he viewed the statement as
inaccurate.
"My client is not seeking any par
ticular amount of money," he said,
adding that Kanzaki had no input
on the amount of any particular
claim. "The fact that there's a dollar
amount mentioned is not reflective
of any merit of the case or of any
particular desire by the client. It's
just a starting point."
As the legal process continues in
the upcoming months, Dunkley
asked that the general public resist
judging Gore-Mann and the Uni
versity before the suit is resolved.
"I think in today's society, law
suits are filed frequently enough
that when people learn of lawsuits it
would be most wise to reserve judg
ment until all of the facts come out."
Dunkley said. "As the defendant
you are at a disadvantage when
cases are tried in the media and
that's unfortunate."

The suit alleges that Gore-Mann
took no formal action after being in
formed of the death threat. The
complaint claims this caused Kan
zaki "enduring and severe mental
aguish and emotional distress."
Gore-Mann declined comment
through Athletic Department
spokesman Gary Migdol. Migdol di
rected all queries to Dunkley, who
initially cited standard University
policy not to comment on the merits
of pending litigation, but allowed
himself to clarify what he viewed as
"misconceptions."
"My understanding is that no
one within the Athletic Department
was aware of the allegation of a
death threat until her complaint was
filed in November 2005," Dunkley
said."lt certainly was not brought to
the attention of the general counsel,
and when I spoke to the administra
tion, they were also unaware."

The Strip Club
The suit then alleges that Kanza
ki received several receipts for "al
cohol purchases by minors and strip
clubs in San Francisco." Specifically,
Kanzaki claims that the receipts
were "for $20 each for expenditures
at the New Century TTieater on
Larkin Street in San Francisco
whose online site advertises 'Lap
dances, video booths, VIP lounges.'"
Allegedly, Kanzaki notified her
immediate supervisor, Susanna
Ching, and Gore-Mann of the "na
ture of the receipts submitted." The
suit then claims that Ching asked
Kanzaki "to make copies of the re
imbursement requisition forms 'for
her files/ and Gore-Mann personal
ly took possession of the handwrit
ten receipts and requisition forms."
Kanzaki then states she discovered
the handwritten receipts "had been
destroyed or removed from the ap
propriate file" and replaced with
lost receipt memos.
"Why did they remove invoices
that minors were taken to strip
clubs and given alcohol?" Secrest
asked."! think the question answers
itself. All she did was try to report it
and do her job."
Dunkley acknowledged that
Stanford football players and re
cruits went to New Century Theater
on Jan. K) and 17.2003, but insisted
no cover-up took place.
"In the complaint, it's intended
to give the impression that there
was some sort of cover-up going on
with how receipts were handled,"
Dunkley said. "That couldn't be fur
ther from the truth."
He explained that under NCAA
procedures, student-athletes are
given $30 apiece to entertain a re
cruit and are required to submit re
ceipts showing that they actually
spent the money on recruits. Dunk
ley added that some Stanford foot
ball players initially submitted
handwritten documentation show
ing that they had gone to the New
Century Theater. However, because
they weren't actual receipts, the
Athletic Department then required
that those football players submit
lost receipt forms in place of hand
written documents.
"Kanzaki tries to make the case
that the use of those lost receipt
forms was a cover-up," Dunkley
said. "However, those lost receipt
forms actually say on their face the

amount spent and what it was spent
for — namely the entry fee for stu
dent-athletes and recruits. How
could you cover up something with
a form showing who spent money,
where they spent it and how much
they spent?"
Kanzaki alleges she met with
then-Athletic Director Ted Leland
on Aug. 13,2003, when she informed
him of the strip club visit and result
ing "accounting irregularities." She
also claims she told Leland that
Ching was harassing another Ath
letic Department accountant, and
that department employees were
not being paid for overtime work.
In spite of her complaints, Kan
zaki said Leland failed to act.
"I think the evidence will show
he basically called her a whiner be
hind her back and did nothing," Se
crest said.
The Athletic Department
Response
After the reimbursement re
quests for the New Century Theater
trip were submitted to the Athletic
Department, it conducted an inter
nal investigation. Football players
confirmed that they attended the
strip club. As a result, Dunkley said,
the University took three actions in
the spring and summer of 2003.
• The director of NCAA compli
ance met with the football team to
discuss appropriate activities and
behaviors when entertaining re
cruits. At that point, football players
were expressly told that visiting
strip clubs was not appropriate.
• Then-head football coach
Buddy Teevens met with the foot
ball team and stated that taking re
cruits to strip clubs was improper.
• The University reported to the
NCAA that three student-athletes
overspent the amount allowable
under NCAA rules by between $3
and $7 apiece.
While admitting that taking re
cruits on strip club visits was inap
propriate, and potentially in viola
tion of Stanford's Fundamental
Standard, Dunkley stressed that the
strip club visits were not in violation
of NCAA policy at the time. How
ever, NCAA rules have since
changed in the wake of a football re
cruiting scandal at the University of
Colorado.Today, taking recruits to a
strip club would violate NCAA pol-

Dunkley also insisted that the
Athletic Department acted respon
sibly.
"No coaches were involved in
this activity," Dunkley said. "The
University self-reported alleged
NCAA violations, and the Universi
ty then instituted policy that was
consistent with the meeting the di
rector of NCAA compliance had
with the football team."
The new policy Dunkley alluded
to is a written policy that he said bans
the "use of entertainment money for
any sexually-related purpose when
entertaining recruits." He added that
athletes are required to sign a form
acknowledging their compliance
with this policy both when receiving
money and when submitting reim
bursement requests.
Dunkley said this new policy was
implemented "shortly after the
events of January 2003" and that he
believes it was in place for the 2004
recruiting season.
When asked about the Universi
ty's liability when its students take
recruits, many of them under 18, to
an 18-and-over strip club, Dunkley
suggested that Athletic Department
employees may not have known the
nature of the New Century Theater.
"It says on the receipt New Cen
tury Theater", Dunkley said. "Until
now. 1 would have no way of know
ing that was an adult-entertainment
establishment or strip club. I can't
speak to what the person who re
viewed the form might have been
thinking, but to me that does not in
dicate these recruits being taken to
any place inappropriate."
Dunkley added that he believes
that the strip club has a responsibil
ity to ensure its patrons are over 18.
A man answering the phones at
the New Century Theater said their
policy was to ID anyone who looked
under 25. He declined to give his
name.
The Falling Out
Kanzaki stated she had a hys
terectomy on Aug. 18, 2003. She
claims that the surgery's aftermath
rendered her disabled under Cali
fornia law and that she did not re
turn until Oct. 13,2003.
Upon her return, Kanzaki said
that the University did not provide
the accommodations her doctor
recommended, namely "a reduction
in workload, reduction in hours and

frequent walks to ease pain and dis
tress." Kanzaki claimed she sent
three emails to Gore-Mann re
questing a meeting to discuss these
accommodations. Kanzaki also al
leged that this meeting never took
place, and, rendered unable to sit for
more than two hours straight, her
hours increased to over 80 per week
for the next year.
Over that year, the complaint de
tails three instances in which Kan
zaki suspected wrongdoing in the
Athletic Department and informed
Gore-Mann of her suspicions. In
every case, Kanzaki alleges Gore ei
ther did not respond or summarily
dismissed her worries. She also al
leges Gore-Mann personally turned
down her request fora transfer to
Track and Field that she claimed she
made in October 2003.
In October of the following year,
Kanzaki claimed a fall in a Stanford
parking lot left her unable to return
to work on campus until Feb. 22,
2005.
The suit then states that on Nov.
y, 2004, Gore-Mann met with Kan
zaki to discuss disability-related ac
commodations so that she could
work out of her home. Allegedly,
Gore-Mann then told Kanzaki "to
work in a more 'cooperative' man
ner, and to 'relinquish' certain deci
sion-making duties."
Kanzaki claims she e-mailed
Gore-Mann about these new re
strictions and was told to discuss
them in person, presumably so that
there would be no paper trial, ac
cording to the suit.
The complaint alleges that on the
day of her return, Kanzaki met with
Gore-Mann and Ron Coverson of
Stanford Human Resources. Hie
suit details that the two essentially
stripped her of her job responsibili
ties, so that she was '"going away'
from 'auditing' of reimbursement
requests, but was instead told to
'just review and post'... and that vio
lations were 'not your concern.'"
The suit then claims that, on
March 23, 2005, the University de
nied her disability leave after suffer
ing severe headaches that were later
diagnosed as severe depression.
Kanzaki claims that the University
replaced her position — effectively,
firing her — on Sept. 2,2005.
The Causes of Action:
The suit asks fora jury trial and

specifies 10 causes of action —
grievances for which a plaintiff
seeks monetary redress — against
the University, the Board of
Trustees and Gore-Mann.
The first six causes of action are
for violations of the California Fair
Employment & Housing Act and
the California Family Rights Act.
The six charges allege that Gore-
Mann and the University discrimi
nated against Kanzaki in light of her
disabilities and her rights as guaran
teed under the two acts.
Another cause of action charges
all three defendants with "inten
tional infliction of emotional dis
tress" and charges the University
with negligent retention, negligent
supervision and unfair business
practices. The unfair business prac
tices charge alleges that recruiting
improprieties such as the football
recruits' visit to the New Century
Theater gave Stanford an unfair ad
vantage over competing colleges in
the Pacific 10 Conference and the
NCAA.
The suit seeks "an amount not
less than $1 million"for each of the
10 causes of action, except for "un
fair business practices," in which a
monetary amount is not specified.
Accordingly, while the complaint
asks for at least million, Secrest
deemphasized the figure's impor
tance.
Secrest refused to say he was
suing the University for million
because he viewed the statement as
inaccurate.
"My client is not seeking any par
ticular amount of money," he said,
adding that Kanzaki had no input
on the amount of any particular
claim. "The fact that there's a dollar
amount mentioned is not reflective
of any merit of the case or of any
particular desire by the client. It's
just a starting point."
As the legal process continues in
the upcoming months, Dunkley
asked that the general public resist
judging Gore-Mann and the Uni
versity before the suit is resolved.
"I think in today's society, law
suits are filed frequently enough
that when people learn of lawsuits it
would be most wise to reserve judg
ment until all of the facts come out."
Dunkley said. "As the defendant
you are at a disadvantage when
cases are tried in the media and
that's unfortunate."
Sheryl Kanzaki, a former Stanford
Athletic Department accountant, is
suing the University and Senior Associ
ate Athletic Director Debra Gore-Mann
for wrongdoings she claims occurred
while employed at the University from
2001 to 2005. Many considered Gore-
Mann a likely replacement for outgoing
Athletic Director Ted (.eland before the
story broke last week.
Her suit, which seeks millions in dam
ages. alleges that the University did not
respond when she received a death
threat at work. She claims the University
summarily dismissed qualms she raised
about receipts, especially those that
showed Stanford football players taking
recruits to the New Century Theater — a

San Francisco strip club —on official
visits. Kanzaki also claims that the Uni
versity acted illegally in not accommo
dating her disabilities that resulted from
a fall in a Stanford parking lot and com
plications following a hysterectomy. Fi
nally, she claims the University effective
ly, and wrongly, fired her on Nov. 2,2(H)5.
The University's standard policy of
not commenting tin the merit of ongoing
litigation limited the defense it could
mount. However, in several areas, and es
pecially on the points concerning the
strip club visits. Senior University Coun
sel Patrick Dunkley explained why he
believes Kanzaki's suit is inaccurate.
Dunkley also explained how the Athletic
Department has adjusted its recruiting
policies in the wake of the strip club trips
and a subsequent internal investigation.
The Death Threat
I iled on Nov. IS, 2(X)5. the 35-page
complaint states that the trouble
began on March 3,2003, when Kan
zaki e-mailed Provost John
Etchemendy to inform him that de
spite a University-wide hiring
freeze, "certain positions were
being created for friends of Gore-
Mann." The complaint stated that
Etchemendy told Kanzaki she
"would not be implicated" for
telling him of Gore-Mann's alleged
hiring of friends.
Just five days later though, Kan -
zaki claims she received a death
threat via voicemail, which she re
ported to the Department of Public
Safety.
"It was a voicemail that indicat
ed she was being targeted." said
David Secrest, Kanzaki's lawyer."lt
was essentially a taunt that the indi
vidual harmed would come to her.
'Hit me with your best shot,' 'Only
the good die young,' and so on."
Two days later, on March 10,
2003, the suit alleges that Tiffany
Girouard, an employee in the
Human Resources Department,
told Kanzaki that Gore-Mann was
'"looking to find out who disclosed
this information.' Girouard then
told [Kanzaki] to 'be very careful,
because we all know how Gore-
Mann works."'
The suit alleges that Gore-Mann
took no formal action after being in
formed of the death threat. The
complaint claims this caused Kan
zaki "enduring and severe mental
aguish and emotional distress."

"Kanzaki tries to make the case
that the use of those lost receipt
forms was a cover-up," Dunkley
said. "However, those lost receipt
forms actually say on their face the

amount spent and what it was spent
for — namely the entry fee for stu
dent-athletes and recruits. How
could you cover up something with
a form showing who spent money,
where they spent it and how much
they spent?"
Kanzaki alleges she met with
then-Athletic Director Ted Leland
on Aug. 13,2003, when she informed
him of the strip club visit and result
ing "accounting irregularities." She
also claims she told Leland that
Ching was harassing another Ath
letic Department accountant, and
that department employees were
not being paid for overtime work.
In spite of her complaints, Kan
zaki said Leland failed to act.
"I think the evidence will show
he basically called her a whiner be
hind her back and did nothing," Se
crest said.
The Athletic Department
Response
After the reimbursement re
quests for the New Century Theater
trip were submitted to the Athletic
Department, it conducted an inter
nal investigation. Football players
confirmed that they attended the
strip club. As a result, Dunkley said,
the University took three actions in
the spring and summer of 2003.
• The director of NCAA compli
ance met with the football team to
discuss appropriate activities and
behaviors when entertaining re
cruits. At that point, football players
were expressly told that visiting
strip clubs was not appropriate.
• Then-head football coach
Buddy Teevens met with the foot
ball team and stated that taking re
cruits to strip clubs was improper.
• The University reported to the
NCAA that three student-athletes
overspent the amount allowable
under NCAA rules by between $3
and $7 apiece.
While admitting that taking re
cruits on strip club visits was inap
propriate, and potentially in viola
tion of Stanford's Fundamental
Standard, Dunkley stressed that the
strip club visits were not in violation
of NCAA policy at the time. How
ever, NCAA rules have since
changed in the wake of a football re
cruiting scandal at the University of
Colorado.Today, taking recruits to a
strip club would violate NCAA pol-

Dunkley also insisted that the
Athletic Department acted respon
sibly.
"No coaches were involved in
this activity," Dunkley said. "The
University self-reported alleged
NCAA violations, and the Universi
ty then instituted policy that was
consistent with the meeting the di
rector of NCAA compliance had
with the football team."
The new policy Dunkley alluded
to is a written policy that he said bans
the "use of entertainment money for
any sexually-related purpose when
entertaining recruits." He added that
athletes are required to sign a form
acknowledging their compliance
with this policy both when receiving
money and when submitting reim
bursement requests.
Dunkley said this new policy was
implemented "shortly after the
events of January 2003" and that he
believes it was in place for the 2004
recruiting season.
When asked about the Universi
ty's liability when its students take
recruits, many of them under 18, to
an 18-and-over strip club, Dunkley
suggested that Athletic Department
employees may not have known the
nature of the New Century Theater.
"It says on the receipt New Cen
tury Theater", Dunkley said. "Until
now. 1 would have no way of know
ing that was an adult-entertainment
establishment or strip club. I can't
speak to what the person who re
viewed the form might have been
thinking, but to me that does not in
dicate these recruits being taken to
any place inappropriate."
Dunkley added that he believes
that the strip club has a responsibil
ity to ensure its patrons are over 18.
A man answering the phones at
the New Century Theater said their
policy was to ID anyone who looked
under 25. He declined to give his
name.
The Falling Out
Kanzaki stated she had a hys
terectomy on Aug. 18, 2003. She
claims that the surgery's aftermath
rendered her disabled under Cali
fornia law and that she did not re
turn until Oct. 13,2003.
Upon her return, Kanzaki said
that the University did not provide
the accommodations her doctor
recommended, namely "a reduction
in workload, reduction in hours and

frequent walks to ease pain and dis
tress." Kanzaki claimed she sent
three emails to Gore-Mann re
questing a meeting to discuss these
accommodations. Kanzaki also al
leged that this meeting never took
place, and, rendered unable to sit for
more than two hours straight, her
hours increased to over 80 per week
for the next year.
Over that year, the complaint de
tails three instances in which Kan
zaki suspected wrongdoing in the
Athletic Department and informed
Gore-Mann of her suspicions. In
every case, Kanzaki alleges Gore ei
ther did not respond or summarily
dismissed her worries. She also al
leges Gore-Mann personally turned
down her request fora transfer to
Track and Field that she claimed she
made in October 2003.
In October of the following year,
Kanzaki claimed a fall in a Stanford
parking lot left her unable to return
to work on campus until Feb. 22,
2005.
The suit then states that on Nov.
y, 2004, Gore-Mann met with Kan
zaki to discuss disability-related ac
commodations so that she could
work out of her home. Allegedly,
Gore-Mann then told Kanzaki "to
work in a more 'cooperative' man
ner, and to 'relinquish' certain deci
sion-making duties."
Kanzaki claims she e-mailed
Gore-Mann about these new re
strictions and was told to discuss
them in person, presumably so that
there would be no paper trial, ac
cording to the suit.
The complaint alleges that on the
day of her return, Kanzaki met with
Gore-Mann and Ron Coverson of
Stanford Human Resources. Hie
suit details that the two essentially
stripped her of her job responsibili
ties, so that she was '"going away'
from 'auditing' of reimbursement
requests, but was instead told to
'just review and post'... and that vio
lations were 'not your concern.'"
The suit then claims that, on
March 23, 2005, the University de
nied her disability leave after suffer
ing severe headaches that were later
diagnosed as severe depression.
Kanzaki claims that the University
replaced her position — effectively,
firing her — on Sept. 2,2005.
The Causes of Action:
The suit asks fora jury trial and

specifies 10 causes of action —
grievances for which a plaintiff
seeks monetary redress — against
the University, the Board of
Trustees and Gore-Mann.
The first six causes of action are
for violations of the California Fair
Employment & Housing Act and
the California Family Rights Act.
The six charges allege that Gore-
Mann and the University discrimi
nated against Kanzaki in light of her
disabilities and her rights as guaran
teed under the two acts.
Another cause of action charges
all three defendants with "inten
tional infliction of emotional dis
tress" and charges the University
with negligent retention, negligent
supervision and unfair business
practices. The unfair business prac
tices charge alleges that recruiting
improprieties such as the football
recruits' visit to the New Century
Theater gave Stanford an unfair ad
vantage over competing colleges in
the Pacific 10 Conference and the
NCAA.
The suit seeks "an amount not
less than $1 million"for each of the
10 causes of action, except for "un
fair business practices," in which a
monetary amount is not specified.
Accordingly, while the complaint
asks for at least million, Secrest
deemphasized the figure's impor
tance.
Secrest refused to say he was
suing the University for million
because he viewed the statement as
inaccurate.
"My client is not seeking any par
ticular amount of money," he said,
adding that Kanzaki had no input
on the amount of any particular
claim. "The fact that there's a dollar
amount mentioned is not reflective
of any merit of the case or of any
particular desire by the client. It's
just a starting point."
As the legal process continues in
the upcoming months, Dunkley
asked that the general public resist
judging Gore-Mann and the Uni
versity before the suit is resolved.
"I think in today's society, law
suits are filed frequently enough
that when people learn of lawsuits it
would be most wise to reserve judg
ment until all of the facts come out."
Dunkley said. "As the defendant
you are at a disadvantage when
cases are tried in the media and
that's unfortunate."
Sheryl Kanzaki, a former Stanford
Athletic Department accountant, is
suing the University and Senior Associ
ate Athletic Director Debra Gore-Mann
for wrongdoings she claims occurred
while employed at the University from
2001 to 2005. Many considered Gore-
Mann a likely replacement for outgoing
Athletic Director Ted (.eland before the
story broke last week.
Her suit, which seeks millions in dam
ages. alleges that the University did not
respond when she received a death
threat at work. She claims the University
summarily dismissed qualms she raised
about receipts, especially those that
showed Stanford football players taking
recruits to the New Century Theater — a

San Francisco strip club —on official
visits. Kanzaki also claims that the Uni
versity acted illegally in not accommo
dating her disabilities that resulted from
a fall in a Stanford parking lot and com
plications following a hysterectomy. Fi
nally, she claims the University effective
ly, and wrongly, fired her on Nov. 2,2(H)5.
The University's standard policy of
not commenting tin the merit of ongoing
litigation limited the defense it could
mount. However, in several areas, and es
pecially on the points concerning the
strip club visits. Senior University Coun
sel Patrick Dunkley explained why he
believes Kanzaki's suit is inaccurate.
Dunkley also explained how the Athletic
Department has adjusted its recruiting
policies in the wake of the strip club trips
and a subsequent internal investigation.
The Death Threat
I iled on Nov. IS, 2(X)5. the 35-page
complaint states that the trouble
began on March 3,2003, when Kan
zaki e-mailed Provost John
Etchemendy to inform him that de
spite a University-wide hiring
freeze, "certain positions were
being created for friends of Gore-
Mann." The complaint stated that
Etchemendy told Kanzaki she
"would not be implicated" for
telling him of Gore-Mann's alleged
hiring of friends.
Just five days later though, Kan -
zaki claims she received a death
threat via voicemail, which she re
ported to the Department of Public
Safety.
"It was a voicemail that indicat
ed she was being targeted." said
David Secrest, Kanzaki's lawyer."lt
was essentially a taunt that the indi
vidual harmed would come to her.
'Hit me with your best shot,' 'Only
the good die young,' and so on."
Two days later, on March 10,
2003, the suit alleges that Tiffany
Girouard, an employee in the
Human Resources Department,
told Kanzaki that Gore-Mann was
'"looking to find out who disclosed
this information.' Girouard then
told [Kanzaki] to 'be very careful,
because we all know how Gore-
Mann works."'
The suit alleges that Gore-Mann
took no formal action after being in
formed of the death threat. The
complaint claims this caused Kan
zaki "enduring and severe mental
aguish and emotional distress."
Gore-Mann declined comment
through Athletic Department
spokesman Gary Migdol. Migdol di
rected all queries to Dunkley, who
initially cited standard University
policy not to comment on the merits
of pending litigation, but allowed
himself to clarify what he viewed as
"misconceptions."
"My understanding is that no
one within the Athletic Department
was aware of the allegation of a
death threat until her complaint was
filed in November 2005," Dunkley
said."lt certainly was not brought to
the attention of the general counsel,
and when I spoke to the administra
tion, they were also unaware."

The Strip Club
The suit then alleges that Kanza
ki received several receipts for "al
cohol purchases by minors and strip
clubs in San Francisco." Specifically,
Kanzaki claims that the receipts
were "for $20 each for expenditures
at the New Century TTieater on
Larkin Street in San Francisco
whose online site advertises 'Lap
dances, video booths, VIP lounges.'"
Allegedly, Kanzaki notified her
immediate supervisor, Susanna
Ching, and Gore-Mann of the "na
ture of the receipts submitted." The
suit then claims that Ching asked
Kanzaki "to make copies of the re
imbursement requisition forms 'for
her files/ and Gore-Mann personal
ly took possession of the handwrit
ten receipts and requisition forms."
Kanzaki then states she discovered
the handwritten receipts "had been
destroyed or removed from the ap
propriate file" and replaced with
lost receipt memos.
"Why did they remove invoices
that minors were taken to strip
clubs and given alcohol?" Secrest
asked."! think the question answers
itself. All she did was try to report it
and do her job."
Dunkley acknowledged that
Stanford football players and re
cruits went to New Century Theater
on Jan. K) and 17.2003, but insisted
no cover-up took place.
"In the complaint, it's intended
to give the impression that there
was some sort of cover-up going on
with how receipts were handled,"
Dunkley said. "That couldn't be fur
ther from the truth."
He explained that under NCAA
procedures, student-athletes are
given $30 apiece to entertain a re
cruit and are required to submit re
ceipts showing that they actually
spent the money on recruits. Dunk
ley added that some Stanford foot
ball players initially submitted
handwritten documentation show
ing that they had gone to the New
Century Theater. However, because
they weren't actual receipts, the
Athletic Department then required
that those football players submit
lost receipt forms in place of hand
written documents.
"Kanzaki tries to make the case
that the use of those lost receipt
forms was a cover-up," Dunkley
said. "However, those lost receipt

money and when submitting reim
bursement requests.
Dunkley said this new policy was
implemented "shortly after the
events of January 2003" and that he
believes it was in place for the 2004
recruiting season.
When asked about the Universi
ty's liability when its students take
recruits, many of them under 18, to
an 18-and-over strip club, Dunkley
suggested that Athletic Department
employees may not have known the
nature of the New Century Theater.
"It says on the receipt New Cen
tury Theater", Dunkley said. "Until
now. 1 would have no way of know
ing that was an adult-entertainment
establishment or strip club. I can't
speak to what the person who re
viewed the form might have been
thinking, but to me that does not in
dicate these recruits being taken to
any place inappropriate."
Dunkley added that he believes
that the strip club has a responsibil
ity to ensure its patrons are over 18.
A man answering the phones at
the New Century Theater said their
policy was to ID anyone who looked
under 25. He declined to give his
name.
The Falling Out
Kanzaki stated she had a hys
terectomy on Aug. 18, 2003. She
claims that the surgery's aftermath
rendered her disabled under Cali
fornia law and that she did not re
turn until Oct. 13,2003.
Upon her return, Kanzaki said
that the University did not provide
the accommodations her doctor
recommended, namely "a reduction
in workload, reduction in hours and

frequent walks to ease pain and dis
tress." Kanzaki claimed she sent
three emails to Gore-Mann re
questing a meeting to discuss these
accommodations. Kanzaki also al
leged that this meeting never took
place, and, rendered unable to sit for
more than two hours straight, her
hours increased to over 80 per week
for the next year.
Over that year, the complaint de
tails three instances in which Kan
zaki suspected wrongdoing in the
Athletic Department and informed
Gore-Mann of her suspicions. In
every case, Kanzaki alleges Gore ei
ther did not respond or summarily
dismissed her worries. She also al
leges Gore-Mann personally turned
down her request fora transfer to
Track and Field that she claimed she
made in October 2003.
In October of the following year,
Kanzaki claimed a fall in a Stanford
parking lot left her unable to return
to work on campus until Feb. 22,
2005.
The suit then states that on Nov.
y, 2004, Gore-Mann met with Kan
zaki to discuss disability-related ac
commodations so that she could
work out of her home. Allegedly,
Gore-Mann then told Kanzaki "to
work in a more 'cooperative' man
ner, and to 'relinquish' certain deci
sion-making duties."
Kanzaki claims she e-mailed
Gore-Mann about these new re
strictions and was told to discuss
them in person, presumably so that
there would be no paper trial, ac
cording to the suit.
The complaint alleges that on the
day of her return, Kanzaki met with
Gore-Mann and Ron Coverson of
Stanford Human Resources. Hie
suit details that the two essentially
stripped her of her job responsibili
ties, so that she was '"going away'
from 'auditing' of reimbursement
requests, but was instead told to
'just review and post'... and that vio
lations were 'not your concern.'"
The suit then claims that, on
March 23, 2005, the University de
nied her disability leave after suffer
ing severe headaches that were later
diagnosed as severe depression.
Kanzaki claims that the University
replaced her position — effectively,
firing her — on Sept. 2,2005.
The Causes of Action:
The suit asks fora jury trial and

specifies 10 causes of action —
grievances for which a plaintiff
seeks monetary redress — against
the University, the Board of
Trustees and Gore-Mann.
The first six causes of action are
for violations of the California Fair
Employment & Housing Act and
the California Family Rights Act.
The six charges allege that Gore-
Mann and the University discrimi
nated against Kanzaki in light of her
disabilities and her rights as guaran
teed under the two acts.
Another cause of action charges
all three defendants with "inten
tional infliction of emotional dis
tress" and charges the University
with negligent retention, negligent
supervision and unfair business
practices. The unfair business prac
tices charge alleges that recruiting
improprieties such as the football
recruits' visit to the New Century
Theater gave Stanford an unfair ad
vantage over competing colleges in
the Pacific 10 Conference and the
NCAA.
The suit seeks "an amount not
less than $1 million"for each of the
10 causes of action, except for "un
fair business practices," in which a
monetary amount is not specified.
Accordingly, while the complaint
asks for at least million, Secrest
deemphasized the figure's impor
tance.
Secrest refused to say he was
suing the University for million
because he viewed the statement as
inaccurate.
"My client is not seeking any par
ticular amount of money," he said,
adding that Kanzaki had no input
on the amount of any particular
claim. "The fact that there's a dollar
amount mentioned is not reflective
of any merit of the case or of any
particular desire by the client. It's
just a starting point."
As the legal process continues in
the upcoming months, Dunkley
asked that the general public resist
judging Gore-Mann and the Uni
versity before the suit is resolved.
"I think in today's society, law
suits are filed frequently enough
that when people learn of lawsuits it
would be most wise to reserve judg
ment until all of the facts come out."
Dunkley said. "As the defendant
you are at a disadvantage when
cases are tried in the media and
that's unfortunate."
