# King Celebrated
## STANFORD KICKS OFF A WEEK OF EVENTS 
### KELLEY FONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Though Martin Luther King Jr. Day
was officially yesterday, the Stanford cam
pus will celebrate the holiday throughout
the week, in hopes that community mem
bers will better honor and understand
King's philosophy and vision.
"Each year Martin Luther King Jr. is
reduced to the I Have a Dream' sound
bite," said Tenisha Armstrong, associate
editor at the Martin Luther King Jr. Re
search and Education Institute at Stan
ford. "I hope this year's events lead to a
greater understanding of Dr. King the
preacher, activist, father, husband and
son."
The Institute planned a wide variety of
different events, from a church service to a
dramatic reading, to enlighten the Stan
ford community about King's life and
work.
Last Friday featured a reception and
open house celebrating the recently re
named Martin Luther Kini». Jr. Research

and Education Institute and its new affili
ation with Stanford's Center for Compar
ative Studies in Race and Ethnicity.
Sunday morning's worship service at
Memorial Church honored King as well.
Rev. John Harrison, coordinator for the
Clinical Pastoral Education programs at
Stanford Hospital and pastor in the
African Methodist Episcopal Zion
Church, delivered the sermon.
Harrison spoke about the dreams of
King and the dreams of biblical figures, re
lating them to the dreams people have
today.
"Racism, that old wall built by fear and
insecurity, is crumbling, but a portion of it
still stands," he said.
Harrison ended his sermon with a sim
ply stated message for the audience —
"Today I lift the challenge — dare to
dream."
Churchgoers left the sermon inspired.
"I thought the preacher did a great job
of connecting the dreams of Jesus and the
other figures from the Bible with the
dreams of Martin Luther King, Jr.,"
said junior Loretta Hickman.
Following the church service, a
dramatic reading was staged. Enti
tled "Passages of Martin Luther
King Jr.," the play was written by
Clayborne Carson, Stanford profes
sor of history and director of the new
institute.
In his introduction to the per
formance. Carson said, "[The play
has] been a labor of love to try to in
corporate the things that I've
learned about Martin Luther King
into a script that could be performed
in public."
Carson drew his material from
King's original letters, interviews,
personal papers, speeches and ser
mons.
The reading, which also featured
musical interludes between scenes,
presented various episodes from
King's life. Through the actors' por
trayals of King, his family and other
figures from the era like Malcolm X
and Stokely Carmichael, "Passages"
gave insight into the life and interac
tions of King.

The performance ended with an
emphasis on Kings willingness to
risk his life for his beliefs. The actors
spoke in unison, saying, "You die
when you refuse to stand up for
right. You die when you refuse to
stand up for truth. You die when you
refuse to stand up for justice. Take a
stand for what you think is right."
"Passages" received a standing
ovation and ended with noted
folksingers Guy and Candie
Carawan leading the audience in
"We Shall Overcome."
"1 really enjoyed hearing the
words of Martin Luther King be
cause they're always inspira
tional," said sophomore Olivia
Puerta. who attended the perform
ance. "I think it's just really useful
to be reminded of the effort to do
good in one's life."
The commemoration of King will
continue with a brown bag lunch and
discussion hosted by clergy today, as
well as a multi-faith celebration hon
oring King's life next Sunday morn
ing. Father J-Glenn Murray, S.J. will
preach a sermon entitled "The Con
tent of Our Character: Still a
Dream."
In addition to the Martin Luther
King Jr. Research and Education In
stitute, Stanford's Office of Reli
gious Life was integral in putting on
the week's events.

"Part of our role is to challenge
bigotry and injustice," said Debbie
McDevitt of the Office of Religious
Life. "Remembering and honoring
the life and work of a man so influen
tial in working toward these same
goals is in keeping with our values
and vision. In turn, we hope that we
are helping to perpetuate and strive
toward realizing Dr. King's dream."
"We need to remember that we
are all God's children," she contin
ued. "This sentiment is at the heart of
Martin Luther King Jr.'s teachings,
and should be at the center of our
thinking today. It's a philosophy that
merits repeating from generation to
generation."
Armstrong also expressed hope
that the student population would
spend time during the week to re
flect on King's philosophy.
"We spend a great deal of time
planning these events and brain
storming on topics that might be of
particular interest to the student
body," she said. "From what I under
stand, many students look forward
to skiing during the annual King
Holiday, and I hope in years to come,
more students spend some time at
these events, reflecting on Dr. King's
legacy."
She added, "This King Holiday,
we honor the past in hopes that it will
influence our future."

dramatic reading, to enlighten the Stan
ford community about King's life and
work.
Last Friday featured a reception and
open house celebrating the recently re
named Martin Luther Kini». Jr. Research

and Education Institute and its new affili
ation with Stanford's Center for Compar
ative Studies in Race and Ethnicity.
Sunday morning's worship service at
Memorial Church honored King as well.
Rev. John Harrison, coordinator for the
Clinical Pastoral Education programs at
Stanford Hospital and pastor in the
African Methodist Episcopal Zion
Church, delivered the sermon.
Harrison spoke about the dreams of
King and the dreams of biblical figures, re
lating them to the dreams people have
today.
"Racism, that old wall built by fear and
insecurity, is crumbling, but a portion of it
still stands," he said.
Harrison ended his sermon with a sim
ply stated message for the audience —
"Today I lift the challenge — dare to
dream."
Churchgoers left the sermon inspired.
"I thought the preacher did a great job
of connecting the dreams of Jesus and the
other figures from the Bible with the
dreams of Martin Luther King, Jr.,"
said junior Loretta Hickman.
Following the church service, a
dramatic reading was staged. Enti
tled "Passages of Martin Luther
King Jr.," the play was written by
Clayborne Carson, Stanford profes
sor of history and director of the new
institute.
In his introduction to the per
formance. Carson said, "[The play
has] been a labor of love to try to in
corporate the things that I've
learned about Martin Luther King
into a script that could be performed
in public."
Carson drew his material from
King's original letters, interviews,
personal papers, speeches and ser
mons.
The reading, which also featured
musical interludes between scenes,
presented various episodes from
King's life. Through the actors' por
trayals of King, his family and other
figures from the era like Malcolm X
and Stokely Carmichael, "Passages"
gave insight into the life and interac
tions of King.

The performance ended with an
emphasis on Kings willingness to
risk his life for his beliefs. The actors
spoke in unison, saying, "You die
when you refuse to stand up for
right. You die when you refuse to
stand up for truth. You die when you
refuse to stand up for justice. Take a
stand for what you think is right."
"Passages" received a standing
ovation and ended with noted
folksingers Guy and Candie
Carawan leading the audience in
"We Shall Overcome."
"1 really enjoyed hearing the
words of Martin Luther King be
cause they're always inspira
tional," said sophomore Olivia
Puerta. who attended the perform
ance. "I think it's just really useful
to be reminded of the effort to do
good in one's life."
The commemoration of King will
continue with a brown bag lunch and
discussion hosted by clergy today, as
well as a multi-faith celebration hon
oring King's life next Sunday morn
ing. Father J-Glenn Murray, S.J. will
preach a sermon entitled "The Con
tent of Our Character: Still a
Dream."
In addition to the Martin Luther
King Jr. Research and Education In
stitute, Stanford's Office of Reli
gious Life was integral in putting on
the week's events.

"Part of our role is to challenge
bigotry and injustice," said Debbie
McDevitt of the Office of Religious
Life. "Remembering and honoring
the life and work of a man so influen
tial in working toward these same
goals is in keeping with our values
and vision. In turn, we hope that we
are helping to perpetuate and strive
toward realizing Dr. King's dream."
"We need to remember that we
are all God's children," she contin
ued. "This sentiment is at the heart of
Martin Luther King Jr.'s teachings,
and should be at the center of our
thinking today. It's a philosophy that
merits repeating from generation to
generation."
Armstrong also expressed hope
that the student population would
spend time during the week to re
flect on King's philosophy.
"We spend a great deal of time
planning these events and brain
storming on topics that might be of
particular interest to the student
body," she said. "From what I under
stand, many students look forward
to skiing during the annual King
Holiday, and I hope in years to come,
more students spend some time at
these events, reflecting on Dr. King's
legacy."
She added, "This King Holiday,
we honor the past in hopes that it will
influence our future."
