With the first stage of the
confirmation pn>ccss behind
him. Judge Samuel Alito has
moved one step closer to re
placing Sandra I)ay O'Connor
on the U.S. Supreme Court.

PARTI
OF A SERIES

After a week of judicial committee hearings, Alito
emerged unscathed and without any major gaffes. As
Democrats sought to pin down Alito's positions on key
issues, he was able to sidestep most pointed questions,
denying Democrats the opportunity to prove his opin
ions are out of line with those of the country.
Alito, who is likely to move the ide
ological make-up of the court to the
right, remained calm as he delivered
well-crafted, albeit slightly ambiguous,
answers. This week the committee will
reconvene to deliberate and vote on
their recommendation before sending
the nomination to the Senate floor.
The judicial committee's question
ing provided little insight into the
judge's interpretation of the Constitu
tion. Democrats repeatedly quizzed
Alito on his views on abortion, citing a
1985 memo he wrote for the Reagan
administration in which he stated that
abortion is not protected by the Consti
tution.
In particular, pro-choice Senators
pressed Alito on the issue of judicial
precedence, or stare decisis, to deter
mine whether Alito would overturn
Roe vs. Wade.
In his carefully worded answers,
Alito provided esoteric and often eva
sive answers to such questions, frustrat
ing senators. Republican and Democ
rat alike. Senator Charles Schumer (D-
N.Y.) expressed this frustration when
he asked, "Can't you answer the ques
tion of' Does the Constitution protect
the right to an abortion?'" When Alito
again avoided a clear answer, the Sena

tor added that "any idea that you are
approaching this fresh, without any
bias" has gone "by the wayside."
Republicans, however, argue that if
confirmed. Aiito would, as he testified,
keep an "open mind" should an abor
tion case reach the Supreme Court.
Furthermore. Alito has also said that
the Constitution provides the right to
privacy, which determined the out
come of Roe in 1972. Alito did not say,
however, whether he feels that abor
tion is protected by that right.
The judge also faced tough ques
tions about his membership to the
Concerned Alumni of Princeton
(CAP). CAP is known for its opposi
tion to affirmative action and its exclu
sion of women and minorities. Alito
claimed no recollection of joining the
group despite its appearance on a 19K5
job application resume.
This week the focus will be on the
judicial committee's deliberations and
eventual vote before sending Alito's
nomination to the Senate floor. The
Committee will review Alito's com
ments and each senator will be granted
the opportunity to make statements
before voting on whether to recom
mend Alito. While these deliberations
could go on for several weeks, the De
mocrats seem to have conceded that
they will not be able to block his confir
mation.
Democrats, such as Schumer and
Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), will focus
their statements on Alito's evasive an

swers. In an attempt to sway Republi
cans, the Democrats will assert that be
cause he provided little new evidence
during questioning, they must revert to
his previous opinions for his views on
the issues. Those views. Democrats
claim, do not match those of the coun
tiry.
"Unfortunately,"Schumer stated at
the hearings conclusion,"by refusing to
confront our questions directly and by
giving us responses that really don't il
luminate how you really think, as op
posed to real answers, many of us have
no choice but to conclude that you still
embrace those views completely or in
large part."
Should the vote occur this week, the
committee will undoubtedly vote 10 to
eight along partisan lines in support of
Alito before sending the nomination to
the Senate floor. At that point, each
Senator will have the opportunity to
present arguments for or against Alito.
Should the Democrats become pas
sionate about blocking Alito's nomina
tion at that point they can filibuster to
block the vote.
Most Democratic Senators and
pundits, however, don't foresee that
happening, as only five Democrats
would have to support Alito in order to
give Republicans the 60 votes neces
sary to end the filibuster. A failed fili
buster would reflect very poorly upon
the Democrats who. at this point, seem
to want this nomination process to be
finished.
