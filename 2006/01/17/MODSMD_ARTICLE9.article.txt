Martin Luther King Jr. absent for the first time
in nearly four decades, preachers and politi

slain leader's lifelong pursuit of civil rights and
nonviolence.
On the holiday marking King's birth, some

her, stayed home and watched the ceremonies
on television. It was the first time in 38 years
she has missed the service at the church where

ATLANTA (AP) — With the widow of
Martin Luther King Jr. absent for the first time
in nearly four decades, preachers and politi
cians urged people Monday to continue the
slain leader's lifelong pursuit of civil rights and
nonviolence.
On the holiday marking King's birth, some

could be better spent domestically on projects
such as education, especially for blacks.
Coretta Scott King, recovering from a
stroke and heart attack that partially paralyzed
her, stayed home and watched the ceremonies
on television. It was the first time in 38 years
she has missed the service at the church where
King preached from 1960 until his death in
1 %8. She received a standing ovation Saturday
night when she appeared on stage with her
children at an awards dinner, her first public

pneumonia Monday at the same facility where he
was briefly hospitalized a month ago. his chief of
staff said. He was said to be doing well.
Ford. 92, was admitted Saturday to Eisenhow

rage in Southern California, Penny Circle said.
"Based on his age it is prudent for his initial

King was"a brother, a friend, a colleague, a

being filled with love, peace and compassion
for all humankind," Rep. John Lewis said at a
holiday breakfast in Minneapolis.
This year is the 20th anniversary of the fed
eral holiday, first held on Jan. 20,1986. Sunday
would have been the assassinated civil rights
leader's 77th birthday.
Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin said the
city has a particular obligation to preserve
King's "legacy of fighting for social and eco

poor and the neglected, a legacy of demanding
peace against senseless war."
As the mayor spoke, volunteers served
12,(XX) meals to the needy at the city's major
league baseball field. The poor and homeless
could also get medical checkups, haircuts and
clothing, as well as legal help and counseling.
In Washington, the president went to see
Abraham's Lincoln's Emancipation Procla

"It seems fitting on Martin Luther King
Day that I come and look at the Emancipation
Proclamation in its original form," Bush said,
"Abraham Lincoln recognized that all men
are created equal. Martin Luther King lived
on that admonition to call our country to a
higher calling, and today we celebrate the life
of an American who called Americans to ac
count when we didn't live up to our ideals."

been cleaned up in advance of a holiday pa

more than 60 percent black before Katrina dis
placed about three-quarters of its population.
"This city will be a majority African Amer
