## Vietnam enjoys respite from flu Bird flu has not occurred in humans since November 
### MARGIE MASON ASSOCIATED PRESS 
HANOI, Vietnam (AP) â€” As experts puzzle over the
fast rise of bird flu cases in Turkey, the country that's been
Ground Zero for the frightening virus is enjoying a quiet
victory: Vietnam hasn't seen any new cases in people
since November and no new poultry outbreaks have
been reported in the past month.
The relief felt in Vietnam offers comfort despite the
flu's worrying appearance in Turkey. So far, the virus has
not mutated to a form that spreads easily between peo
ple. The Turkish cases are still being investigated, but ex
perts say it appears that all of people involved were in
close contact with birds.There is no hard evidence point
ing to any direct human-to-human infection.
Health experts also say the latest human infections in
Eastern Europe were not unexpected.
"We've seen it expanding in the last two years and so
to have it cause human cases in countries outside of Asia
is not surprising," said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, a flu expert at
the World Health Organization in Geneva. Still, he cau
tioned. "we're all sort of holding onto the seat of our
pants."
As for Vietnam, Dr. Shigeru Omi. the WHO's region
al director for the Western Pacific, said an ambitious
mass poultry vaccination program last fall may have
helped slow outbreaks this winter, although there is no
scientific evidence to that effect.
Omi also warned the country must still get past the
Lunar New Year late this month when the transport of
people and poultry is at its highest.
"Vietnam is very excited, of course it's too early for us to
make any conclusions to say that in Vietnam the situation
is under control," Omi said. "But... this rather silent period
may indicate, partly, that their commitment paid off."
About 120 million birds were vaccinated in Vietnam,
where the bulk of human deaths have occurred. Since
early October, nearly 4 million birds died or were slaugh
tered as 24 provinces battled outbreaks. All those areas
have since gone at least 21 days with no new flare-ups, the
time required to consider an outbreak contained. No
new human cases have been reported since Nov. 14, ac
cording to the Health Ministry Web site.

Although the virus is now endemic in Vietnam, the
communist country has taken aggressive steps to try to
slow the spread, including regulating the transport of
poultry and products and ridding large urban centers of
live birds. High-level government officials have also
taken a strong role in working to raise awareness about
the disease
China also embarked on an ambitious poultry vacci
nation program, but sporadic outbreaks have continued
in birds and the WHO confirmed two new human deaths
last week. WHO also confirmed another death in In
donesia on Saturday.
Meanwhile, in Turkey, officials were scurrying to
slaughter poultry in affected areas where at least 19 peo
ple have tested positive for the HSNI virus this month,
including two deaths. Preliminary tests indicate another
death has occurred, but it has not been confirmed by the
WHO. In additional 12-year-old Turkish girl died Sunday
while her brother remained in hospitalized after testing
positive for the virus.Tests on the girl initially came back
negative, but are being conducted again.
So far, the virus has killed 77 people in east Asia and

two others in Turkey since it re-emerged in late 2003, ac
cording to the WHO.
The virus itself continues to baffle experts, but they are
slowly learning more about it.
A recent study suggested it is not nearly as deadly as
thought and has probably infected far more people who
became mildly ill and recovered. The research was only
circumstantial and scientists are calling for blood tests to
get a better handle on how many people may actually
have been infected with bird flu without needing hospi
talization.
WIIO is hoping to take blood samples and throat swabs
of villagers in Turkey where the disease has shown up.
The official count of cases by WHO suggests that half
those infected die, but many experts now believe that
only the most serious cases have been noticed and that
many people become ill without seeing a doctor.
Dr. Hitoshi Oshitani. a communicable disease control
and response consultant for WHO, said researchers have
much to learn about the ever-changing virus.
"We still have many unanswered questions regarding
this virus," he said."This HSNI virus keeps surprising us."
