WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen. Edward Kennedy,
who criticized Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito's
past membership in a controversial Princeton Universi
ty alumni club, severed his ties Tuesday with a former
Harvard college social club that bans women members.
"He has decided to be taken off their rolls, believing
that it is a mistake to continue to be affiliated,"
Kennedy spokeswoman Melissa Wagoner said in a
statement.
The Massachusetts Democrat, a member of the Sen
ate Judiciary Committee, grilled Alito during Senate
confirmation hearing last week about Alito's ties to the
Concerned Alumni of Princeton, an alumni group that
opposed the admission of women and minorities at the
Ivy League School.
A Washington Times story about Kennedy's Owl
Club ties last week sparked criticism from Republicans
who branded Kennedy a hypocrite.
Kennedy joined the Owl Club when he was a student
at Harvard.Though not an active member since college,
he donated about $1(X) to the club last October, his of
fice said TUesday.
Kennedy has sent a letter to the club asking for his
name to be removed from all official documents.
"Senator Kennedy joined Harvard's Owl Club in
1954, a social organization similar to a fraternity, before
women were admitted to the campus and long before
they were integrated into campus life," Wagoner said.
Harvard ended its ties with the all-male club and oth
ers like it in 1984.
"While we are glad Ted Kennedy has decided to get
on the equality bandwagon, it's laughable given that his
revelation comes less than a week after his hypocritical
attacks on Judge Alito," Republican National Commit
tee spokeswoman Tracey Schmitt said Tuesday.
Kennedy's spokeswoman said the Owl Club was pri
marily a social club, while the Princeton group actively
supported excluding women and minorities from the
school.
"There is absolutely nothing in common between this
social club and an organization like CAP that was estab
lished to push a political agenda to prohibit women and
minorities from attending Princeton," Wagoner said.
"No one can question Senator Kennedy's lifelong com
mitment to fighting for civil rights, equality and justice."
