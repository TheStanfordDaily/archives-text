## Hug an Engineer 
### 
I have a confession to make. It's a se
cret, so don't tell anyone. Engineers
are people, too. Yes, I realize that
may be shocking to some of you, but it's
true.
Regular readers (well, you can't
blame me for being a little optimistic)
may wonder what's wrong. After all,
engineers are far more often the sub
ject of gentle mockery in these columns
than anything else. So why the sudden
change of heart?
Well firstly, it's not a change of heart.
I don't actually hate engineers. I don't
even dislike them, I just think that
they're often a little awkward (as are
we all) and mildly amusing in their abil
ity to fulfill a stereotype. Plus, the way
they get annoyed at the occasional in
sult is awfully cute.
In their defense, though, you too
would probably get a little miffed if you
had to face the barrage of prejudice
that our technically-minded friends
have to.
I was recently in a discussion about
the hopeless social situation among the
graduate student community here at
Stanford when my companion made
the assertion that perhaps things
would work better if we segregated the
population.
Of course, she didn't put it quite like
that (and she recanted rather swiftly),
but the basic point was that everyone
else would get on much better if the en
gineers just kept to their own and the
rest of us (presumably minus the blacks,
Asians and Jews) stuck together.
Needless to say, it is a spurious com
parison to suggest that not wanting to
associate with a particular group of
people because of their choice of aca
demic discipline is somehow equiva
lent to refusing to hang out with some
one because of his or her race.
On the other hand, while one bias is
considerably more pernicious than the
other, both are equally absurd. Also,
while Stanford is relatively free of
racism, that doesn't appear to be the
case with engineerism.
The mildly ironic thing with charges
of interaction inadequacy is that they
are often used as an excuse by humanists
and the like to completely disconnect
from the Stanford social scene (such as it
is) and thus ensure that practically every
gathering in Rains turns into a EE-in
fested awkward zone (and awkward
solely by virtue of homogeneity).
It's not just social disdain that is
turned upon the inhabitants of Packard
and Terman. They also have to deal
with envy. And somewhat inappropri
ate envy at that.
There is a myth that engineers get
paid more than the rest of Stanford's
grads. And it's a myth that seems to
have a great deal of currency among
whining humanities folk.
I cannot claim to have serious data
on this, but my brief collection of anec
dotal evidence suggests that most grad
uate students earn approximately the
same amount during the bulk of the year
(summers work out a little differently).
What's more, even if engineers do
get paid more, it's worth remembering
that this University was built and nur
tured with engineering money. Without
it, there is no way the Cardinal would
be competing on the world stage.
Speaking of world stages brings me
to my final point and, I suppose, a minor
mea culpa. While social prowess is the
most obvious source of condescension,
there is also a more invidious kind of
discrimination. Academic snobbery.
There is a tendency of more abstract
thinkers — and sadly, I have done this
myself — to look down on the intellectu
al abilities of people who actually make
things. For some reason, directly con
tributing to society seems to be the an
tithesis of "proper" scholarly behavior.
It's unclear exactly why this is,
though in my case I know it stems from
a deep insecurity. What I do has little in
the way of tangible worth, so devaluing
the notion of concreteness helps me
feel a little better about myself.
Anyway, from now on I'm going to
try to ignore that little voice that tells
me to be superior, and instead show a
little love. Perhaps you could do the
same and we could all live in blissful,
idyllic harmony. Or something like
that.

In case you were wondering, none of this
means I'm going to stop mocking you
people. If that bothers anyone, e-mail
navins@stanford.edu with your hate
mail.
