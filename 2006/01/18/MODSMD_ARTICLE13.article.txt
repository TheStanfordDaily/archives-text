# The 						Joy of Kitchenette Cooking
## Graduate students host meal-making activities 
### KATIE BEARMAN MANAGING EDITOR 
While you may have bungled your last few attempts to
cook a fresh, multi-course meal, don't throw in the pot
holder just yet. At least once a quarter, you can hone your
culinary skills in chow-time classes with fellow graduate
students, organized by third-year biological sciences grad
uate student Maria Spletter and fifth-year chemistry grad
uate student Tracy Terry. The classes began last quarter,and
three will be offered Sunday.Jan. 29.
Terry says she enjoys putting the activities together
because food is something people associate with others
they care about.
"I lead these classes, using recipes from my family
and old friends, to help me remember and honor them,"
she explains. "Sharing family recipes with others brings
back all those feelings of home and comfort that we
sometimes lose while studying and working far away
from home."
Spletter adds that the activities have a valuable social
component.
"We get to meet people outside of our labs and outside

of our departments, and cooking gives us something in
common to talk about and bond over," she says.
Third-year law and business student Amy Chen also
says she enjoyed meeting new people in one of last quar
ter's classes.
"Cooking is always a relaxing and energizing experi
ence for me, all the better when you can do it with friends
— new and old," Chen comments.
Each cooking class can accommodate about 10 people.
While the GSC helps fund the program, Spletter and Terry
ask all participants to give a $3 to $5 contribution.
More than 150 people have expressed interest in the
classes, but there are only 30 spots this quarter.To accom
modate the growing interest, Spletter and Terry say they
need more graduate students or other volunteers who
can teach classes.
"The more leaders we can recruit, the more classes we
can hold," Terry explains.
In particular. Spletter and Terry hope to attract cooks
who can offer recipes from various heritages.
"We would like to recruit more head chefs with experi
ence in different types of cuisine so that we can offer
courses in dishes throughout the world," Terry says.

"There is really no better way to learn how to cook than
from someone who associates the food with their history."
Last quarter, groups of graduate students made two
Italian dinners and one "Sweet and Sour Southern Style
Dinner," according to Terry. Terry grew up in Alabama
and contributed recipes for the southern dinner.
On the Jan. 29 agenda is a pizza and salad lunch from
12 p.m. to 3 p.m. in the GSC and a "Classic American
Chicken" dinner from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. in the Escondido
Village Kitchens. Spletter, who is of German-American
heritage, will also lead a "Germanfest" dinner from 5
p.m. to 8 p.m. in the GSC.
Spletter and Terry say a volunteer may teach Indian
recipes in an event later this quarter. And they're always
looking for more theme ideas.
"The main constraints on the recipes are that they can
be completed in two hours, leaving a little time for acci
dents and time for eating; that the volunteer chef is com
fortable with the recipes and with leading the class; and
that the ingredients aren't too expensive,"Terry explains.
There are still a few spaces in the Jan. 29 classes. To
