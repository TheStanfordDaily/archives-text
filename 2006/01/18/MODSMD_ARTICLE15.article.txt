# Volunteers plant native species, care for Farm's grounds

### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
Though they aren't pulling rabbits
out of hats. Stanford students are never
theless practicing magic — in an eco
logical sense. Each weekend in January,
local non profit organization Magic Inc.
will organize volunteers to plant Cali
fornia native bunch grass and Califor
nia native oak seedlings on the Stanford
campus. Through various activities.
Magic Inc. teaches people about ecolo
gy to "clarify values, improve health, in
crease cooperation and steward the en
vironment," its Web site says. More than
40 people volunteered during the first
two weekends in January. Field work
sessions have been from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.
on Saturdays and either 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.
or 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Sundays.
The work is part of Magic's ongoing
habitat management program for Stan
ford's open spaces, primarily the ar
boretum — the area between central
campus and El Camino Real — and the

foothills. Thousands of Stanford stu
dents. faculty and staff have volun
teered on the project over the past 25
years.
The purpose of Magic's habitat stew
ardship is to enhance the ecological in
tegrity of the campus landscape, to
demonstrate the benefits of native
plants in urban and suburban settings
and to provide hands-on opportunities
for people to learn about ecology and
care for the natural environment.
According to Magic fellow David
Schrom, 2006 is the second year of large
scale grass plantings and the 26th year of
oak plantings. By the end of January,
Magic plans to have planted 30,000
grasses, fora two-year total of 80,000,
and 50 oaks, fora 25-year total of 2,500.
"Volunteering with Magic is a fun
way to be out of doors, work with friends
and get some exercise while contribut
ing to the ecological integrity of the
campus environment," Schrom says.
"It's a way to take care of your tempo
rary home and to develop more of a

sense of place. By participating in this
project,students contribute to providing
a very visible — and likely to be emulat
ed since Stanford is highly regarded —
demonstration of ecologically sensitive
landscape design and maintenance."
More than 30 years ago, while run
ning in Stanford's foothills, Schrom
noted that oaks were declining, and
young oaks were scarce.
"I realized that the landscape I so
much appreciated was changing and
wondered why and whether I might act
to preserve and protect the qualities
that I valued," Schrom says.
Magic plans to plant an additional
10.(XX) bunch grass plugs and 50 native
California oaks during the next two
weekends in January. The organiza
tion's habitat stewardship activities
continues throughout the year to care
for previously planted trees and assist
them in becoming established. Volun
teers are always needed.
