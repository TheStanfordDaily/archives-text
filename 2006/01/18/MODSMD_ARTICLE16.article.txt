## Editorial ASSU needs to overhaul budget approval process 
### 
Last week, the Undergraduate Senate
announced changes in funding policies
for student groups. These changes
were ostensibly in response to a budget over
draft of $158,784.98, — a significant portion
of the ASSU's annual budget. While the Sen
ate is not expected to be a paragon of fiscal
austerity, students generally expect the Sen
ate not to spend money that it doesn't have.
Nevertheless, it is to the current Senate's
credit that the problem was spotted early in
the year. We are also relieved to learn that the
Senate has already taken steps to mitigate
the fallout from last year's spending spree.
An e-mail has been sent out to student group
financial officers to inform them of the poli
cy changes.These changes include the imple
mentation of a soft cap of $40 per group
member, and a hard cap of $6,000 on all stu
dent group budget requests. We look forward
to subsequent announcements of further
policy changes.
However, this incident reveals a startling
lack of oversight and proper governance
within the Senate. As the organization re
sponsible for representing student interests,
the Senate should have been more meticu
lous in the way it managed our dues.
The budget overdraft arose partly due to
the lack of accountability within the Senate.
Under the current system, senators who ap
prove student budgets are rarely on the Sen
ate for more than one term. Loathe to make
unpopular decisions like denying funding to
student groups, and knowing they will not be
around the next year to deal with the fallout
from their decisions, they are likely to be gen
erous in approving student budgets until
funding runs out — or worse.
Granted, the Senate does not have an easy
task in trying to meet the budget requests of
all student groups on campus.The Senate can

choose to increase the General Fees,give out
less money to all student groups or fund only
selected groups — all of which are unpopu
lar courses of action.
Clearly, a system of accountability has to
be implemented that is able to function inde
pendent of individual senators passing
through the undergraduate senate.
Of course, the Senate can take further
steps to curb spending by scrutinizing indi
vidual line items in budgets submitted by stu
dent groups. And indeed, the Senate already
goes to great pains to do that — by demand
ing detailed budgets and questioning dubi
ous line items. In this way, the Senate can and
does already limit spending on food, enter
tainment or costly events that involve a small
number of people. Such scrutiny would put
an end to extravagant end-of-quarter dinners
and the like.
However, we believe that the Senate has
to make serious changes to its current
process of approving student group budgets.
From what we understand, budget re
quests are reviewed on a rolling basis
throughout the quarter. This leads to the pit
fall of being generous early in the quarter,
and subsequently stingier as the quarter pro
gresses.
One solution would be to review all budg
et requests early in the quarter. Budget re
quests should have a due date, at which time
they would all be examined simultaneously.
'ITiis method would allow the Senate to bet
ter compare budgets across the board. This
way, the Senate can approve funding for wor
thy causes, while nixing less-deserving proj
ects. The ASSU and its senators need to take
greater responsibility for distributing funds
in an equitable and prudent manner, and this
proposal seems a logical way to go about
doing so.
