# Drinking to MLK's ideals
## 
### 
Credit cards are great, aren't they? I
mean, I just love the way that they
can reduce nearly three weeks of va
cation into an itemized list of all (he booze
I drank, the high-calorie and high-carh
food and beverages that 1 consumed and
the expensive gifts that I purchased for my
friends and family (none of which they re
ally needed).
Unfortunately, most of those "priceless"
moments that the commercials talk about
were long forgotten and only appeared to me
as flashbacks in hung-over recollections of
the fun that I was told I had had. Even though
I'm not an outwardly religious person, it ap
pears that I had a lot to celebrate over the
break. At least my credit card bill tells me as
much.
Cut to me, last Monday, back at Stanford
in my cold Escondido Village studio apart
ment cutting lemon wedges and drinking
pints of Hefeweizen alone. I took a moment
before I raised the frosty freezer-chilled mug
to my lips and said aloud, "Thanks, Martin
Luther King, Jr." 1 took a drink, trying to
imagine that "freedom" tasted something
like wheat beer. It was delicious.
On the surface, it might look like my pri
orities are all out of whack. Yes, I spent
thousands of dollars over the break cele
brating holidays that weren't all that impor

tant to me. including the passage of a calen
dar year. In contrast, my observance of
MLK Day amounted to a six-pack of beer, a
lemon and a restful day without classes.
Shouldn't the two be switched? Shouldn't I
be spending thousands of dollars to cele
brate my civil rights? At the very least, don't
they deserve more recognition than I have
given them?
On the other hand, it appears as though
my celebration of MI ,K Day was perfect. You
see. thanks to the 21st Amendment, my right
to enjoy booze is protected by the Constitu
tion. It's my right!
Unfortunately, in many places it is still
legal to discriminate against me in employ
ment and housing. Even though sodomy is
legal,there is a policy that prohibits me from
having sexual bodily contact with a person
of the same sex while serving in the armed
forces of the United States (whether or not

the partner is also in the armed forces). Fur
ther, the policy prohibits any homosexual or
bisexual from disclosing his or her sexual
orientation, or from speaking about any ho
mosexual relationships — including mar
riages or other familial attributes — while
serving in the U.S. Armed Forces.
If I'm ever lucky enough to find a true
love, I still have to face the fact that, even if
they aren't banned, same-sex marriages are
not recognized across states. And let's sup
pose I live in a state where I'm allowed to
adopt children — their education is not a
civil right, either (at least it's not a right
mentioned in the Constitution).
I think it's important that while we re
member that Martin Luther King, Jr. was a
pioneer in the civil rights movement, we also
recognize that he was taken before his work
was finished. Ilie civil rights movement, at
least for people like me. is still a struggle
today — one that is not solved by taking a
day off.This year, it struck me how this day is
not only one of remembrance, but also one of
inspiration. Let's not forget that we're on the
front lines of a struggle that is still very much
around us.
Here's to MLK. Cheers, man.
