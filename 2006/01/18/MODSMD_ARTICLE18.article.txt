## Strike was effective but work remains 
### MATT SERIFF-CULLICK CIHAN BARAN 
The recent editorial "Tactics weaken
strike's image" (Jan. 11) raised questions that
were on many students' minds at the end of
winter quarter: Why schedule a strike on the
first day of finals? Why promote a boycott of
food that has already been purchased on stu
dent meal plans? Where can students find out
more information? As the editorial acknowl
edged, none of these questions deals directly
with the content of labor negotiations. We'd
like to briefly address these questions so that
the community may move on to more sub
stantive issues and be ready to support Stan
ford workers in the coming weeks.
The Daily's editorial places blame for the
strike's inconvenient timing to poor planning
on SEIU 715. In reality, the timing is only in
the hands of the union to a limited extent.
Workers resort to a strike only when negotia
tions, rallies and other actions fail to produce
good-faith bargaining by their employer. The
University, for its part, delayed the process
significantly: It took nearly 100 days after
workers submitted their demands for the
University to agree to sit down at the table as
required by contract. Workers and students

held a rally during the very first week of class
es, calling for the University to "Negotiate
Now.'"l\vo months later, we found ourselves
still promoting the same message in response
to the University's position.
No one wants a strike, and striking during
finals is the least ideal option. However, the
union's attempts to stick with the negotiation
process until the last possible moment, cou
pled with the required 10-day notice fora
strike at the Hospital, set the earliest possible
strike date as Dec. 12. Campus workers —
who were running a joint campaign with Hos
pital workers — had their final negotiating
session on Dec. 8, and thus chose to strike at
the same time to demonstrate solidarity.
The Daily is correct in pointing out that the
boycott of the dining halls was a gesture rather
than an economic attack (since students had
already paid for these meals). However, it was
far from a meaningless one. The student boy
cott was a symbolic act to show solidarity with
the workers and was visibly successful.
Dining executives, who were prepared for
long lines and increased food demand at each
dining hall instead found few patrons at each
location, particularly at the near-empty Mur
ray House. Administrators were surprised by
the extent to which students were willing to

make personal sacrifices in support of the
workers. Although the University may have
already cashed the checks for our meals, the
boycott of the dining halls sent a strong and
necessary message that students do care
about the workers.
In addition to broad participation in the
dining hall boycott, nearly I.(XK) students
demonstrated their support by signing a peti
tion for workers in the weeks leading up to
the strike. Student presence at the pre-strike
rally on Dec. 8 was the strongest it has been at
any demonstration this year.
Even more importantly, worker participa
tion in the boycott was phenomenal. High
percentages of unionized Hospital workers
and nearly UK) percent of unionized campus
workers honored the strike, as did several
other groups of workers who refused to cross
picket lines during the day.
As a result of worker solidarity and
strength, the dangerous transition to a two
tiered benefits system — originally sched
uled to begin Jan. 1 — remains on the negoti
ation table.That alone is reason enough to de
clare the strike effective.
Of course, none of the aforementioned
information addresses the content
of negotiations. In our effort to con
tinue providing as much informa
tion as possible about the actual is
sues, the Coalition for Labor Justice
invites all members of the Stanford
community to keep an eye out for
the informational and educational
sessions that will be held in coming
weeks.
Labor negotiations continue, and

both Hospital and University work
ers responded to the University's
most recent — and hardly altered —
proposals by rejecting these offers by
a 90 percent margin and authorizing
a strike. This week will be the last of
negotiations and will prove crucial in
avoiding a second strike.
Hie CLJ applauds The Daily's
recognition of the fact that a labor
strike is a far greater burden on
workers than on the students who it
inevitably also affects. The issues at
stake — including healthcare and re
tirement security — are of tremen
dous consequence.
Students have a great role to play

in ensuring that the deaf ear hereto
fore turned toward workers' de
mands will finally heed the call of the
entire Stanford community: "Stan
ford. it's time to bargain in good
faith! Fair contract now!"
