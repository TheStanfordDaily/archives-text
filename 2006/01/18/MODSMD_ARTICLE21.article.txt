The day has finally come: I'm fresh out
of BS. The Facebook and campus dat
ing just aren't doing it for me this
week. So, as a consolation, I've decided to
tell you how to make millions of dollars.
Sound good?
Look around. Palo Alto is slumbering
like a lion that just made the kill of a lifetime.
All is quiet as four of the 10 most expensive
housing markets in the United States, all
within a half-hour of Stanford, tranquilly
doze amid hundreds of billions of dollars of
new wealth.
Yeah — you and me — we missed that
whole dot-com thing.
The only hope for us is to anticipate the
next investing frenzy, which will correlate
with some great leap forward. I remember
when a partner at Lehman Brothers gave me
some words of wisdom at a sell weekend: He
said that you don't get into banking to make
money during a career, you do it for the
years when the market comes unglued and
investors go berserk.
So what's the next big thing? It may well
be nanotcchnology, something very Stan
fordesque. A seemingly abstruse term, nan
otechnology simply means controlling mat
ter on the sub-KM) nanometer scale (one
nanometer = 10 atoms). Nanotech thus im
plies the nexus of the sciences and engineer
ing at the atomic scale, where the traditional
distinctions between chemistry, biology and
physics finally blur into the same quantum
playbook.
This convergence will enable product de
sign that is fundamentally different from
anything we've attempted in the past. Since
the dawn of man, we have used the materials
made available by Mother Nature, and these
materials come biggie-sized. In a top-down
approach, we carve out raw materials from
the earth, joining them, soldering them and
mixing them to create the products we de
sire. Even microprocessors, one of the tiniest
techs to date, are created top-down using ul
traviolet light to burn circuit images into a
slab of silicon.
Nanotech goes the opposite direction,
bottom-up, building materials one atom at a
time. This reversal in the construction
process has the potential to revolutionize al
most every product in existence and make
the basic sources of well-being — food,
water,medicine and energy — more accessi
ble to the developing populations of the
world.
"Hmm..." you say. "Sounds fishy." Not
sure you want to trust the shady columnist
who constantly writes on completely useless
topics? Let's ask Michael Dell.
"Nanomaterials," Michael Dell said, in
response to what he would pursue if he had
to build his fortune today. A myriad of the
world's business and political leaders — in
cluding John Mauldin. Steve Jurvetson.John
Doerr, Hilary Clinton. Newt Gingrich and
George W. Bush — have made similarly en
thusiastic statements. I recently exchanged
e-mails with a billionaire who informally

wrote, "I think nanotechnology is really
freakin' cool. 1 only know the very basics,but
I have a feeling that there are going to be
some real fortunes made in that area."
Indeed, nanotechnology is now the most
well-funded government scientific initiative
since the space race. And thanks to recent
advances, nanotechnology is no longer just a
government pipe dream.The torch is finally
being passed to the private sector as com
mercialization increasingly becomes a reali
ty-
Lux Research estimated that private sec
tor spending outpaced government spend
ing on nanotechnology for the first time in
2004. Hie Forbes/Wolf Nanotech Report
stated in 2004 that over 1,500 companies
worldwide have publicly announced their in
volvement in "nanotechnology," and hun
dreds of start-ups have been launched in the
United States alone.
OK, great, so why could this be a boom?
Because it only takes a word to break the
markets. If you've read Malcolm Gladwell's
Tipping Point, you know what I mean. Peo
ple are largely ignorant and the markets are
too vast to understand. As a result, a sexy
and rousing word or idea sometimes comes
along that catalyzes the aggregation of capi
tal. The rest is just Psych 1. Money chases
money and the markets come unglued. A
few examples:
• Tulips
In 1593, Conrad Guestner imported the
first tulip bulb into Holland from Constan
tinople. ibey became a status symbol among
the rich but soon swept the nation in a tulip
trading craze. Ililip bulbs increased in value
more than 20-fold in one month.and by their
peak in the 1630s were worth about $76,000
each in today's currency.
• South Sea
In exchange for financing its war debts,
Britain granted exclusive trading rights in
the South Seas to the South Sea Company in
1711. Anticipating a monopoly on trade in
half of the New World and fueled by the ex
citement of the colonial period, investors
bid up shares more than 10-fold in a few
months. The stock crashed, leaving the
British economy in shambles. Isaac Newton
lost a large part of his fortune and re
marked, "I can calculate the motions of
heavenly bodies, but not the madness of
people."

• The Great Crash
The 1920s were known as the
"Roaring Twenties" because indus
trialization had introduced many
new technologies, such as the radio
and automobile, that radically al
tered human quality of life. The
economy boomed and the Dow in
creased six fold in under a decade,
that is. until the Great Depression.

Though each of these resulted in
a market crash, the latter three each
marked a great leap forward for
mankind — advances so exciting
they inspired investors to the point

of irrationality. Does the word "nan

psychological power as tulips in Hol
land. trade in the New World, inven

Maybe.
Companies are already playing
the name game. The Forbes/Wolfe
Nanotech Report noted that"nano"
name changes echo the".com" name
changes of the late-19905. During the
dot-com boom, the number of com
panies changing their names to
something containing ".com" in
creased dramatically because this re
labeling paid off in stock apprecia
tion. Similarly, the number of compa
nies pulling a "nano" name switch
has greatly increased in recent years
and resulted in stock appreciations.
Similarly, the number of refer
ences to "nanotechnology" in both
scientific journals and media refer
ences has increased exponentially,
from a few hundred to tens of thou
sands. in a matter of years. Look no
further than your shiny new iPod
Nano to see the term already being
used as a mass-marketing mecha

Not to worry — just like the in
formation revolution, your friendly
neighborhood faculty are on top this
thing. Small Times magazine ranks
the Pacific states as the number-one
region for nanotechnology, and
places Stanford in the top five uni
versities for nanotech research and
commercialization. A search of engi
neering and sciences faculty profiles
returns over 30 professors who list
nanotechnology among their re
search endeavors, and Stanford
Alumni Magazine recently ran a
cover story on nanotech at Stanford.
So, there you have it. You've got a
few years yet to decide for yourself
and perhaps get involved. Stanford
and Silicon Valley is the perfect
place to do it. Cash in your ticket.
The valley lion will reawaken soon

Alumni Magazine recently ran a
cover story on nanotech at Stanford.
So, there you have it. You've got a
few years yet to decide for yourself
and perhaps get involved. Stanford
and Silicon Valley is the perfect
place to do it. Cash in your ticket.
The valley lion will reawaken soon
enough.

The day has finally come: I'm fresh out
of BS. The Facebook and campus dat
ing just aren't doing it for me this
week. So, as a consolation, I've decided to
tell you how to make millions of dollars.
Sound good?
Look around. Palo Alto is slumbering
like a lion that just made the kill of a lifetime.
All is quiet as four of the 10 most expensive
housing markets in the United States, all
within a half-hour of Stanford, tranquilly
doze amid hundreds of billions of dollars of
new wealth.
Yeah — you and me — we missed that
whole dot-com thing.
The only hope for us is to anticipate the
next investing frenzy, which will correlate
with some great leap forward. I remember
when a partner at Lehman Brothers gave me
some words of wisdom at a sell weekend: He
said that you don't get into banking to make
money during a career, you do it for the
years when the market comes unglued and
investors go berserk.
So what's the next big thing? It may well
be nanotcchnology, something very Stan
fordesque. A seemingly abstruse term, nan
otechnology simply means controlling mat
ter on the sub-KM) nanometer scale (one
nanometer = 10 atoms). Nanotech thus im
plies the nexus of the sciences and engineer
ing at the atomic scale, where the traditional
distinctions between chemistry, biology and
physics finally blur into the same quantum
playbook.
This convergence will enable product de
sign that is fundamentally different from
anything we've attempted in the past. Since
the dawn of man, we have used the materials
made available by Mother Nature, and these
materials come biggie-sized. In a top-down
approach, we carve out raw materials from
the earth, joining them, soldering them and
mixing them to create the products we de
sire. Even microprocessors, one of the tiniest
techs to date, are created top-down using ul
traviolet light to burn circuit images into a
slab of silicon.
Nanotech goes the opposite direction,
bottom-up, building materials one atom at a
time. This reversal in the construction
process has the potential to revolutionize al
most every product in existence and make
the basic sources of well-being — food,
water,medicine and energy — more accessi
ble to the developing populations of the
world.
"Hmm..." you say. "Sounds fishy." Not
sure you want to trust the shady columnist
who constantly writes on completely useless
topics? Let's ask Michael Dell.
"Nanomaterials," Michael Dell said, in
response to what he would pursue if he had
to build his fortune today. A myriad of the
world's business and political leaders — in
cluding John Mauldin. Steve Jurvetson.John
Doerr, Hilary Clinton. Newt Gingrich and
George W. Bush — have made similarly en
thusiastic statements. I recently exchanged
e-mails with a billionaire who informally

wrote, "I think nanotechnology is really
freakin' cool. 1 only know the very basics,but
I have a feeling that there are going to be
some real fortunes made in that area."
Indeed, nanotechnology is now the most
well-funded government scientific initiative
since the space race. And thanks to recent
advances, nanotechnology is no longer just a
government pipe dream.The torch is finally
being passed to the private sector as com
mercialization increasingly becomes a reali
ty-
Lux Research estimated that private sec
tor spending outpaced government spend
ing on nanotechnology for the first time in
2004. Hie Forbes/Wolf Nanotech Report
stated in 2004 that over 1,500 companies
worldwide have publicly announced their in
volvement in "nanotechnology," and hun
dreds of start-ups have been launched in the
United States alone.
OK, great, so why could this be a boom?
Because it only takes a word to break the
markets. If you've read Malcolm Gladwell's
Tipping Point, you know what I mean. Peo
ple are largely ignorant and the markets are
too vast to understand. As a result, a sexy
and rousing word or idea sometimes comes
along that catalyzes the aggregation of capi
tal. The rest is just Psych 1. Money chases
money and the markets come unglued. A
few examples:
• Tulips
In 1593, Conrad Guestner imported the
first tulip bulb into Holland from Constan
tinople. ibey became a status symbol among
the rich but soon swept the nation in a tulip
trading craze. Ililip bulbs increased in value
more than 20-fold in one month.and by their
peak in the 1630s were worth about $76,000
each in today's currency.
• South Sea
In exchange for financing its war debts,
Britain granted exclusive trading rights in
the South Seas to the South Sea Company in
1711. Anticipating a monopoly on trade in
half of the New World and fueled by the ex
citement of the colonial period, investors
bid up shares more than 10-fold in a few
months. The stock crashed, leaving the
British economy in shambles. Isaac Newton
lost a large part of his fortune and re
marked, "I can calculate the motions of
heavenly bodies, but not the madness of
people."

• The Great Crash
The 1920s were known as the
"Roaring Twenties" because indus
trialization had introduced many
new technologies, such as the radio
and automobile, that radically al
tered human quality of life. The
economy boomed and the Dow in
creased six fold in under a decade,
that is. until the Great Depression.
• Dot-Coin
ITiis late-1990s boom needs no in

of the Internet to drastically alter the
economy and our way of life with
connectivity and knowledge-sharing.
Though each of these resulted in
a market crash, the latter three each
marked a great leap forward for
mankind — advances so exciting
they inspired investors to the point

of irrationality. Does the word "nan
otechnology" command the same
psychological power as tulips in Hol
land. trade in the New World, inven
tion in the industrial period and dot
coms in the Information Age?
Maybe.
Companies are already playing
the name game. The Forbes/Wolfe
Nanotech Report noted that"nano"
name changes echo the".com" name
changes of the late-19905. During the
dot-com boom, the number of com
panies changing their names to
something containing ".com" in
creased dramatically because this re
labeling paid off in stock apprecia
tion. Similarly, the number of compa
nies pulling a "nano" name switch
has greatly increased in recent years
and resulted in stock appreciations.
Similarly, the number of refer
ences to "nanotechnology" in both
scientific journals and media refer
ences has increased exponentially,
from a few hundred to tens of thou
sands. in a matter of years. Look no
further than your shiny new iPod
