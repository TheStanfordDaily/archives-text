## The
						eternal human drama of sports 
### 
I'll admit it. I'm a drama junkie and a sucker for
the most newsworthy headlines. I wait lor sig
nificant statistical milestones to be reached
and for longstanding records to be broken.
This is probably why the sports world intrigues
me. Some of my most profound moments of joy
come from witnessing the showdowns between
the greatest athletes or observing individuals or
teams whom I support show up and dominate
their competition. In a slightly more unusual
sense, I get the same kick out of seeing a triple
overtime, buzzer-beating, game-winning shot that
I do from seeing a highly-regarded pro golfer
shoot an incredibly poor stroke total, or two pro
fessional basketball teams approach the league
record for combined point-scoring futility.
Now, I am not a "bandwagoner" who flocks to
the fan base of the latest news-worthy ballclub or
athletic squad. I do have my allegiances, but the
drama of athletic competition is how I got my start
in each sport that 1 now follow unceasingly.
For example, my interest in the game of college
football first came about when I was 12. It was
1998, and my hometown UCLA squad, Kansas
State and Tennessee all entered their respective
final regular season games with undefeated
records.This was also the first year that the BCS
system was instituted to determine who should
play for the national championship trophy.
The new system added a new mathematical di
mension to the game, as computers would for the
first time take into account the margin by which
the teams won. In addition, human polls would be
factored in, so that should any of these three teams
lose its final game, it would be dropped from na
tional title contention.
Sure enough. UCLA lost in a shootout to
Miami, Kansas State blew the Big-12 title game to
a two-loss Texas A&M team,and the national title
game was ultimately held as a Tennessee-Florida
State matchup. UCLA was relegated to the Rose
Bowl, where it lost in a high-scoring game against
Wisconsin. This was one of my first tastes of truly
rooting fora particular team in big-time competi
tion.This also happened to be the same year as the
second Jordan-led three-peat, which produced my
great appreciation for the Bulls' great run, as well
as endurance for many close calls for the Utah Jazz
in their bid to snatch their first NBA title behind
the great Stockton-Malone duo.
To some of you. I have probably just demon
strated the youth of my existence as a devoted and
ever-learning sports fan. but now let me describe
what makes sports great in this day and age (and
by that, I mean the past several years).
The past four years have been a great and wild
ride for the Southern California football program,
which seemed to keep fans on edge, alternating
between one-sided blowouts and breathtaking
last-second victories (until this past Jan. 4, of
course, which I will not elaborate upon but do not
wish to understate).
After a breakout 10-2 season in 2(H)2, the Tro
jans lost Meisman Trophy winner and No. I overall
NFL draft pick quarterback Carson Palmer as well
