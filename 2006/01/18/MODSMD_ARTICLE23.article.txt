USC. In the second round. Wan met
the top-ranked singles player in the
country, Lars Poerschke of Baylor.
Wan won the first set before even

there remains much work to be done.
"These are big matches but [they
are only in] February,so we've got a
long way to go," Whitlinger said.
"We've got to take the matches and
play and learn from whatever hap
pens."
If the Sherwood Cup is an indicator of
Stanford's strength this season, it looks
like the Cardinal will be a force to be
reckoned with.

of the top teams in the tournament, which
was held over the weekend at the Sher
