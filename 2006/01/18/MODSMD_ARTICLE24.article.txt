### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
11 \v;is a long offseason for the members of
the women's gymnastics team, who were forced
to endure the sting of a disappointing and in
juiy filled 2005 season in which they failed to
make the NC AA Championship for the first
time in live years. But for the Stanford faithful
who showed up lor the Cardinal's 2006 home
opener, it was apparent that this year's squad
has made its rebound and is ready to challenge
lor the national title.
Coming oil an impressive second place ef
fort a week ago at the Cancun ( lassie, the No. 3
Cardinal looked to further improve their per
fortnancc as they took on San Jose State, UC-
Davis and Sacramento State on Sunday.
And the Cardinal did just that by stepping up
to produce a dominant effort. Stanford claimed
the top three finishes in each of the competi

tion's four events as the Cardinal cruised to a
spectacular 194.350 that easily outpaced run
ner-up Sacramento State's 191.525. The Spar
tans took third (190.575) while the Aggies fin
ished fourth (186.875).
Sophomore Tabitha Yim led the Stanford
charge. In only the third all-around of her career,
Yim posted a career-high 39.6(H) to finish with
the top individual total of the day. Yim produced
career-best scores on floor exercise and
vault (9.9(H)) en route to being named Pacific-10
Conference (iymnast of the Week.
Senior Natalie Foley (39.150) and freshman
Nicole Ourada (39.1(H)) rounded out the Cardi
nal sweep of the top three Ail-Around finishes,
and sophomore Liz THcase won on bars with a
near-perfect 9.950.
Ihc Cardinal have this week off before trav
eling to Corvallis.Ore., to take on Oregon State
on Jan. 27.
As for the men's squad — on the road for the
season opener and taking on a bitter rival as the
underdog — this weekend's schedule likely
couldn't have provided a more difficult chal
lenge for the No. 6 Stanford men's team.

Nevertheless, the Cardinal lose to the occa
sion and toppled No. 4 California in Berkeley
on Friday night by the narrowest of margins.
When the final competition was concluded and
the last scores tallied, it was the Cardinal who
stood on top, 205.650 to 205.550.
Were it not for dominant team performanc
es on vault and floor exercise, the Cardinal like
ly would not have come away with the victory.
But by finishing as the top three in both events,
sophomore David Sender.junior Dylan Carney
and senior Sean Doolan played large roles in
making the Cardinal's first effort ol the season a
success.
Sender, who concluded the competition's six
events with an Ail-Around score of 50.540. set
the standard on vault with a 9.550 and floor ex
ercise with a 9.350.
