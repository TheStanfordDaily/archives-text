## Niners hire Turner as offensive coordinator 
### GREG BEACHAM AP SPORTS WRITER 
SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) —
Norv Turner is going back to what he
does best, and his assistant-turned
boss is glad he chose the San Francis
co 49ers.
TUrner, fired as coach of the Oak
land Raiders two weeks ago, moved
across the San Francisco Bay to be
come the 49ers' offensive coordina
tor on lUesday.
Niners' coach Mike Nolan hired
his former boss with the Washington
Redskins to replace Mike McCarthy,
named the Green Bay Packers' head
coach last week after one terrible
season with the Niners.
Though llirner has failed twice as
a head coach, the two-time Super
Bowl winner with Dallas was court
ed by at least four teams last week for
his vaunted offensive mind and re

spected skills as a coordinator.
Though he wouldn't directly com
ment, TUrner seems to realize his
strengths might be best suited to an
assistant's role.
"There's a good foundation here,
and the way the 49ers ran the ball
late in the year is exciting for me,"
Turner said TUesday as he formally
took over the NFL's worst offense in
2(X)5. "This is a young team, and 1
look forward to being part of the
young players' development."
For once in a peripatetic coaching
life/Ilirner won't have to move to his
next job — and his son, who's been
in five schools in four years, can stay
enrolled as well.Hie native of nearby
Martinez said he plans "to be here
fora long time."
Turner, who also coached the
Redskins for nearly seven years, was
fired by the Raiders after just two
losing seasons. Nolan was the first

NFL coach to call TUrner after his
dismissal and many others followed.
Job offers soon arrived — a sign
of respect for Turner's career, which
is highlighted by his work as the
Cowboys' offensive coordinator dur
ing two championship seasons. His
reputation took a hit this season
when the Raiders struggled mightily
on offense despite stars Randy Moss,
LaMont Jordan and Kerry Collins.
"There were other places out
there I could have gone, but I feel
very comfortable with Mike,"TUrner
said." 1 know what Mike is about, and
he knows what I'm about."
Nolan was lUrner's defensive co
ordinator in Washington from 1997-
99, but Redskins owner Dan Snyder
essentially forced Nolan to resign
when his contract ran out. Both
coaches believe their mutual respect
will smooth this transition in their re
lationship.

"I had some bad years at Wash
ington.and it makes you step back
and re-evaluate what's important to
you." Nolan said."(Washington) was
a difficult situation. ... We tried to
make it work, but there was always
this outside force making it hard to
make it work."
TUrner went 49-59-1 with just one
playoff berth in Washington before
getting fired with three games left in
the 2(XX) season. He took charge of
the Raiders in January 2(X)4 but won
just nine games, leading to his dis
missal by owner A1 Davis.
TUrner will take over for Mc-
Carthy, who presided over one of the
worst offensive seasons in NFL his
tory in Nolan's first year in San Fran
cisco.
The Niners (4-12) managed just
3,587 total yards — the fewest in the
league, the franchise's lowest total
since 1%3.
