## No. 18 UCLA hobbles into rivalry game with USC 
### BETH HARRIS AP SPORTS WRITER 
LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” With three starters lost
to injury and others nursing aches and pains, No. 18
UCLA is hobbled as it heads into its rivalry game with
Southern California.
Despite a decimated lineup, the Bruins (14-3) have
managed to hang on to first place in the Pac-10 with a
4-2 record. They're coming off a 69-65 loss to then
nth-ranked Washington at Pauley Pavilion, one of
only two defeats at home this season.
llie Bruins will be without starters Josh Shipp (lost
for season due to hip pain), Lorenzo Mata (out at least
six weeks with a knee injury) and Cedric Bozeman
(injured shoulder) when USC visits Wednesday night.
Freshman Alfred Aboya sprained his right knee
last Saturday against Washington. He returned to
practiceTUesday and is expected to play against USC.
Already out three weeks, Bozeman was cleared to
shoot and dribble TUesday, but is not yet ready to play.
Bruins coach Ben Howland rattled off medical up
dates TUesday,saying,"lt's sad that 1 know all this. I'm
getting to be an expert at this stuff."
Star guard Jordan Farmar has been bothered on
and off by a sprained ankle.
"I'm getting better every day,"he said. "Not being
in practice every day and then trying to play in the
game has been tough."
Pain also has gotten to leading scorer Arron Affla

10, who fell hard at Arizona State one and a half weeks
ago and hurt his hip and backside.
"This team is still very good, despite all the injuries,
despite all the unfortunate circumstances and obsta
cles we've had to overcome," Afflalo said. "I still think
we can win. All these injuries are tough, but all you can
do is laugh at them, get in rehab and recover."
The upside to the injuries is the experience that
younger players are getting.
Freshman Michael Roll is scheduled to start his
third straight game Wednesday after playing limited
minutes earlier in the season. 1 le had 10 points against
Washington State and 17 against Washington.
Two other freshmen. Luc Richard Mbah a Moute
and Ryan Wright, have joined the starting lineup, too.
Mbah a Moute is the nation's top rebounder. averag
ing 8.7. He's led the Bruins on the boards in all but one
game this season.
"At least they're learning now instead of being
thrown into the fire during tournament time, which
makes a big difference," said Ryan Hollins, who
missed five of the first six Pac-10 games because of a
strained groin.
ITie Bruins swept the Trojans (12-5, 3-3) last sea
son, including a 21 -point thrashing at Pauley.The two
previous seasons, however, the IVojans swept the two
game series.
"No matter what the sport is. you always want to
beat SC," Farmar said. "It's definitely big.even though
the rankings might not show it."

by numerous injuries. UCLA's bench will be a huge factor against rival Southern California.
