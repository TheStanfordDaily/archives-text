## LGBT-CRC welcomes "Brokeback" Students say film could raise awareness about gay issues 
### CHRISTOPHER LIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stunningly enough, this year's Oscar buzz is not cen
tered on one man or woman's epic struggle to fight his or
her physical disability or mental illness to fulfill his or her
dreams with the help of a loving and caring mentor.
The film "Brokeback Mountain." directed by Ang Lee,
has been one of the most popular movies of the last
month, its popularity confirmed by four Golden Globes
on Monday night. Based on a short story by E. Annie
Proulx, author of "The Shipping News," the film stars
Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal as a ranch-hand and
a rodeo cowboy who meet one summer in Wyoming and
develop a passionate relationship that conflicts with their
culture and family life.
While the movie has gained the nickname "the gay
cowboy movie." junior Annie Osburn describes it as some
thing more — "The main perception [this movie] might
change is that 'gay' means any one thing, that you can sum
up this story as 'the gay cowboy movie.' It's about two peo
ple who fall in love and are separated by the governing
forces in their lives — their families, their obligations and
what they've grown up believing and how that influences
and overtakes their rebellion from the norm. It's not a 'gay
cowboy' movie; it's basically every tragic love story that's
ever been told."
Many on campus believe that the film presents an op
portunity to raise awareness about issues confronting the
queer community. Ben Davidson, director of the LGBT
CRC, said, "I think many queer people have been pro
foundly moved not only by the film itself but by the coun
try's fascination with it — by the fact that so many people
are seeing it."
Part of the movie's appeal may stem from its ability to
provide audiences with a universal story with whom they
can easily connect.
"I thought it was pretty intense as dramas go." said
sophomore Eric Boromisa. "'lTiere were very few people
who weren't crying in the theater. Even my fraternity
brothers cried. It's nice to see a LGBT love story that is
more mainstream and presented as something real, not an
artsy film that is going to have a specific audience and no
notability."
Indeed, "Brokeback Mountain" has generated an in

credible buzz in the film industry. The movie is on many
critics' lists of top movies for 2005, and Hollywood insiders
anticipate that the film will receive several Academy
Award nominations. Already, the film has received Gold
en Globes for Best Motion Picture (Drama), Best Direc
tor, Best Screenplay and Best Original Song, with three ad
ditional nominations, including Best Performance by an
Actor in a Motion Picture (Drama) for Heath Ledger.
Despite all the acclaim, some remain doubtful that the
movie can substantially change perceptions of the gay
community.
"For the most part, people aren't going to see this
movie without knowing they'll be seeing two men going at
it on a very large screen," Osburn said. "People who are
uncomfortable with homosexuality or believe that it's
wrong and abhorrent aren't going to see it; Golden Globes
and the fact that it's about cowboys aren't going to change
that."
Co-terminal student MehulTrivedi agreed that the film
would do little to change the minds of those already op
posed to the idea of homosexuality.
"In my hometown of Dallas, it's really difficult to find
theatres willing to show the movie," he said.
Sanjay Kairam, another co-terminal student, pointed
out that "some people could even be set off by the graph
ic scenes in the movie."
However, other students remain hopeful that the
movie can make a difference.
Local film critic Peter Canavese of the radio show Cel
luloid Dreams said."The story leaves the audience to con
sider the wages of individual and institutionalized respon
sibility for human oppression. In a time when gay marriage
has become a pressing point, Lee takes a long, hard look at
the human element of the last, as-yet-untamed frontier of
civil rights."
Lee's confrontation of universal elements of love and
the traditions of American film may just convince audi
ences of the universality of the homosexual cowboys' love.
Davidson added,"Part of the movie's appeal lies in the
way it simultaneously capitalizes on and subverts two of
our country's most cherished myths: the masculine ideal of
the cowboy and the appeal of presumed-to-be-hetero
young male movie stars. We may be fascinated by the idea
of gay cowboys but, on a deeper level, we are all — queer,
straight, whatever — moved by the forbidden, tragic love
shared by these two characters — who are beautifully
written, beautifully acted, beautifully shot."
Or, as Boromisa put it more simply, "Every girl should
take her boyfriend along to see it."
