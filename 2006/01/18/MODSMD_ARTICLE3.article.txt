## The

About 120 people gathered in Tresidder's
Oak Lounge East to hear Ibrahim Al-Marashi
discuss the British governments 2(X)3 plagia
rism of his doctoral dissertation, an error since
dubbed the "Dodgy Dossier" scandal. Nineteen
paragraphs of his article, "Iraq's Security & In
telligence Network: A Guide & Analysis," pub

view of International Affairs," were copied
nearly verbatim without his consent and used in
the intelligence dossier published by the Blair
government as its justification for the invasion
of Iraq.

government would not plagiarize such a vital

eventually acknowledge that entire portions of
my working dissertation had been copied and
pasted into the dossier, which was then deliv

the United Nations."
Al-Marashi outlined the chain of events that
took him to the chambers of Parliament, where
