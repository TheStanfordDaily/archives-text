# STILL DODGY
## The 						ramifications...go beyond plagiarism. 
### DAISY CHUNG STAFF WRITER 
— IBRAHIM AL-MARASHI

About 120 people gathered in Tresidder's
Oak Lounge East to hear Ibrahim Al-Marashi
discuss the British governments 2(X)3 plagia
rism of his doctoral dissertation, an error since
dubbed the "Dodgy Dossier" scandal. Nineteen
paragraphs of his article, "Iraq's Security & In
telligence Network: A Guide & Analysis," pub
lished in September 2002 in "Middle East Re
view of International Affairs," were copied
nearly verbatim without his consent and used in
the intelligence dossier published by the Blair
government as its justification for the invasion
of Iraq.
The event was organized by the Coalition for
Justice in the Middle East (CJME) and co-spon
sored by the ASSU Speaker's Bureau, the Mus
lim Student Awareness Network (MSAN), the
Organization of Arab Students in Stanford
(OASIS) and the Stanford Asian American Ac
tivism Coalition (SAAAC).
"We jumped at the opportunity to bring a
scholar with such extensive expertise in Middle
Eastern politics and inside knowledge of the
topic of faulty intelligence to speak to the Stan-

ford community," wrote Olivia Sohns, co-presi
dent of CJME, in an e-mail to The Daily.
"CJME seeks to promote awareness of the
Dodgy Dossier scandal because we feel it exem
plifies how the alliance between the British and
U.S. governments, in making a case for regime
change in Iraq, misconstrued the nature of the
Iraq threat in order to generate public support
for the war," she added.
Al-Marashi opened his talk, "Intelligence
Failures: Re-Examining the Case for the 2003
Iraq War," with a comparison between the
British government's actions and a college stu
dent plagiarizing a term paper.
"Perhaps I was trying to delude myself that a
government would not plagiarize such a vital
document," Al-Marashi said. "However. 1 did
eventually acknowledge that entire portions of
my working dissertation had been copied and
pasted into the dossier, which was then deliv
ered to Colin Powell and presented in front of
the United Nations."
Al-Marashi outlined the chain of events that
took him to the chambers of Parliament, where

gins and the British government's
possible misconstrual of the threat
Iraq posed prior to the 2(X)3 invasion.
"It must have been a busy day at
the office, and they must have just
taken the first document that came
up on the Yahoo! search when they
typed in Iraq' and 'intelligence serv
ices,"' he joked.
Though Al-Marashi made hu
morous asides throughout his talk,
he conveyed the central point that
the case for the Iraq war was made
on the basis of a plagiarized and mis
represented intelligence report, and
that British and American citizens
alike were misled by their govern
ments. Because the dossier was one
of the key elements that led to
Britain's decision to go to war
against Iraq, the significance of Al-
Marashi's work was magnified.
"The ramifications of this inci
dent go beyond the issue of govern
ments' plagiarizing documents," Al-
Marashi said. "The dodgy dossier
made people question the intelli
gence prior to the war and scrutinize
their governments more closely
about their justification for the Iraqi
invasion."

Al-Marashi fielded questions
from the audience after he delivered
his talk.
"There was a reason why they
called it Operation Iraqi Freedom
and not Operation Destroy
Weapons of Mass Destruction, be
sides the difficulty in saying it," Al-
Marashi said in response to a ques
tion about the justification offered
by the American and British govern
ments. "The governments didn't
know how to justify the war because
they didn't have evidence."
Students who attended the talk
commented on Al-Marashi's thor
ough knowledge of the situation in
Iraq.
"He really delved into everything
that happened, and is happening
now, and spun it in a very humorous
light," said junior Ann Walker. "He
downplayed the grave nature of the
incident and gave a different per
spective on what went on in those
early days."
Al-Marashi's presentation en
lightened the audience about the
role of intelligence in mobilizing
countries to go to war, several stu
dent attendees said.
"I never realized how big a role
the media plays in incidents like this
one," said junior Tala Alramahi. a
member of CJME. "We should be
more aware and responsible for the
information we are presented with."

represented intelligence report, and
that British and American citizens
alike were misled by their govern
ments. Because the dossier was one
of the key elements that led to
Britain's decision to go to war
against Iraq, the significance of Al-
Marashi's work was magnified.
"The ramifications of this inci
dent go beyond the issue of govern
ments' plagiarizing documents," Al-
Marashi said. "The dodgy dossier
made people question the intelli
gence prior to the war and scrutinize
their governments more closely
about their justification for the Iraqi
invasion."

Al-Marashi fielded questions
from the audience after he delivered
his talk.
"There was a reason why they
called it Operation Iraqi Freedom
and not Operation Destroy
Weapons of Mass Destruction, be
sides the difficulty in saying it," Al-
Marashi said in response to a ques
tion about the justification offered
by the American and British govern
ments. "The governments didn't
know how to justify the war because
they didn't have evidence."
Students who attended the talk
commented on Al-Marashi's thor
ough knowledge of the situation in
Iraq.
"He really delved into everything
that happened, and is happening
now, and spun it in a very humorous
light," said junior Ann Walker. "He
downplayed the grave nature of the
incident and gave a different per
spective on what went on in those
early days."
Al-Marashi's presentation en
lightened the audience about the
role of intelligence in mobilizing
countries to go to war, several stu
dent attendees said.
"I never realized how big a role
the media plays in incidents like this
one," said junior Tala Alramahi. a
member of CJME. "We should be
more aware and responsible for the
information we are presented with."
