## ASSU discusses student space, dining 
### MICHAEL TAMKIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate convened last
night to discuss issues involving student space in Tresid
der Union, student input in the University Dining Com
mittee and updates by Senate committees. The Senate
also approved funding for various student groups and
discussed the effects of the new Senate rule on fund allo
cations.
ASSU President Melanie Kannokada, a senior.

opened the meeting by commenting on a plan to facili
tate student use of space on the second floor ofTresidder.
Although the space currently needs to be reserved for
use by student groups. Kannokada said she wants stu
dents to have general access when no groups are present.
She also described a plan in progress that would pro
vide housing accommodations for students who have dif
ficulty going home during winter break.
"We spoke to President Hennessy, because Harvard
and Yale have similar programs," Kannokada said. "We
set up meetings with members of housing and the head

of Bechtel International Center. We realized that it's not
just international students but also low-income students
from the East Coast who might like to stay on campus
over winter break.
"We want to reach out to the community and to
young alumni.and ideally we would start with a pilot pro
gram for next winter break," she added.
The Senate then heard from sophomore Robert
Chubrich, student representative to the University Din-
ing Committee. Although Chubrich
acknowledged that the Stanford Din
ing officials are "very student-input
oriented and results-driven," he also
said that current plans to alter dining
services have been considerably
slowed by Dining Services' labor
problems.
Still, Chubrich commented that
student goals included menu rota
tions and said there were questions
of nutrition as an area of general con
cern. Dining Services, he said, seems
to be "less concerned with obesity
than with eating disorders."
"We also hope to focus on sustain
ability issues and working with local
farms," Chubrich said.
Finally, Chubrich commented on
the need for further student input on
dining issues in addition to comment
cards posted in dining halls.
"We want to find a deeper source
of information from surveys; gather
ing accurate and useful student input
will be a challenge," he said.
The Senate later voted to allocate
funding to student groups such as the
Black Pre-Business Society, the Fam
ily Resource Desk, Bursting the Bub
ble, Bent Spoon Student Dance
Company, Pakistanis at Stanford,
Students fora Sustainable Stanford,
Stanford Alpine Club and the dvB
dance group.
The governing body also ap
proved reserve transfer bills for Stu
dent Initiated Courses and the Asian
American Students Association.
Deputy Chair of the Senate Ap
propriations Committee Hershey
Avula, a sophomore, commented
positively on the Senate's new "soft
cap" rule for appropriations, which
uses a group's number of participants
as a guideline for how much to allo
cate and also no longer covers ex
penses, such as regular group meet
ings.

"We've adopted some of the
Graduate Student Council's policies,
and the new rules are correct to the
amount we can spend within our lim
its." Avula said. "We can't spend into
deficit, which is good because it also
means more groups will be able to be
interviewed for funds, since in years
past we ran out of funds by winter
quarter."
Chair of Student Life, Housing
and Education committee Kat Ker
shner, a sophomore,outlined plans to
ensure student input in the renova
tion of Old Union and the continua
tion of the Stanford Saver program.
"This quarter we're becoming
more involved in student space issues
as Old Union is renovated," Kershn
er said. "We're trying to make sure
space is reorganized so student
groups can hang out and have facili
ties available for music and dance re

hearsals."
Kershner also said that the com
mittee is negotiating contracts with
certain businesses for the Stanford
Saver Program and hopes to have the
participation of 40 or 50 companies,
varying from restaurants to hair sa
lons.
Finally, senior Andrew Hendel,
chair of the Campus Advocacy Com
mittee, outlined his group's plans for
the quarter.
"We're going to try to keep Green
Library open later, since it currently
opens at noon on Sunday and closes
at 9 p.m. on Fridays, two of the times
students indicate they want to use
Green Library," Hendel said. "This
Thursday, we're going to discuss in
vestment disclosure. We also want to
continue working with Student Initi
ated Courses and have a program on
parking."

ensure student input in the renova
tion of Old Union and the continua
tion of the Stanford Saver program.
"This quarter we're becoming
more involved in student space issues
as Old Union is renovated," Kershn
er said. "We're trying to make sure
space is reorganized so student
groups can hang out and have facili
ties available for music and dance re

hearsals."
Kershner also said that the com
mittee is negotiating contracts with
certain businesses for the Stanford
Saver Program and hopes to have the
participation of 40 or 50 companies,
varying from restaurants to hair sa
lons.
Finally, senior Andrew Hendel,
chair of the Campus Advocacy Com
mittee, outlined his group's plans for
the quarter.
"We're going to try to keep Green
Library open later, since it currently
opens at noon on Sunday and closes
at 9 p.m. on Fridays, two of the times
students indicate they want to use
Green Library," Hendel said. "This
Thursday, we're going to discuss in
vestment disclosure. We also want to
continue working with Student Initi
ated Courses and have a program on
parking."
