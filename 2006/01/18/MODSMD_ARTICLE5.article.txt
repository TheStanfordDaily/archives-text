## University, county agree on trails Stanford will construct two previously-disputed trails 
### CLAY BAVINGER 
Following sometimes heated dispute, Stanford
has finally reached an agreement with Santa Clara
County regarding the construction of two hiking
trails which will run through Stanford land. These
trails satisfy the conditions of Stanford's General
Use Permit (GUP), which the county issued to the
University five years ago.
The GUP is renewed every 10 years by Santa
Clara County, granting state government approval
to any developments on Stanford land, and stipu
lates that Stanford permanently dedicate two trails
on its land as part of the County's larger trail proj
ect. According to the 2(XX) GUPTYaiIs Conditions of
Approval, the University promised to "dedicate
easements for, develop, and maintain the portions
of the two trail alignments which cross Stanford
lands shown in the 1995 Santa Clara County wide
TVails Master Plan (Routes SI and CI)."
On Dec. 13, the Santa Clara County Board of Su
pervisors voted four to one to approve the trails.
However, the months leading up to the vote had
been surrounded by controversy over the location
of one of the paths.
The SI trail, which will cross over Stanford land
near Page Mill Road, was readily agreed to by the
University and the county.
Larry Horton, senior associate vice president
and director of government and community rela
tions for Stanford, said he "does not expect prob
lems" with the SI trail. Construction is under way,
according to Horton, and the trail should "open
within a year."
