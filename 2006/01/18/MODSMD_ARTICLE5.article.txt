## University, county agree on trails Stanford will construct two previously-disputed trails 
### CLAY BAVINGER 
Following sometimes heated dispute, Stanford
has finally reached an agreement with Santa Clara
County regarding the construction of two hiking
trails which will run through Stanford land. These
trails satisfy the conditions of Stanford's General
Use Permit (GUP), which the county issued to the
University five years ago.
The GUP is renewed every 10 years by Santa
Clara County, granting state government approval
to any developments on Stanford land, and stipu
lates that Stanford permanently dedicate two trails
on its land as part of the County's larger trail proj
ect. According to the 2(XX) GUPTYaiIs Conditions of
Approval, the University promised to "dedicate
easements for, develop, and maintain the portions
of the two trail alignments which cross Stanford
lands shown in the 1995 Santa Clara County wide
TVails Master Plan (Routes SI and CI)."
On Dec. 13, the Santa Clara County Board of Su
pervisors voted four to one to approve the trails.
However, the months leading up to the vote had
been surrounded by controversy over the location
of one of the paths.
The SI trail, which will cross over Stanford land
near Page Mill Road, was readily agreed to by the
University and the county.
Larry Horton, senior associate vice president
and director of government and community rela
tions for Stanford, said he "does not expect prob
lems" with the SI trail. Construction is under way,
according to Horton, and the trail should "open
within a year."


JAMES CHAN/The Stanford Daily
Two new trails are planned for construction on Stanford land. The University recently
concluded negotiations with Santa Clara County.
However, the County Board of
Supervisors butted heads with Stan
ford over the location of the CI trail.
The University proposed that this
trail run along Alpine Road.There is
already an old, derelict trail in place,
which the University suggested could
be refinished.
Because of community opposi
tion, the County thought a trail
through more interior land, away
from major roads, would be a better
idea.The County Board of Supervi
sors proposed a route that ran
through the area close to the Dish in
the foothills behind campus; They
claimed that this route would be
more aesthetically pleasing than the
Alpine Road location, which would
function more as a sidewalk to the
street.
However, Horton pointed out

many advantages to the Stanford
proposed CI route.
"We believe this is the correct
place to put the trail because [it]
avoids most environmental prob
lems and avoids destruction of the
golfcourse,"hesaid.
Other trail routes would have
likely cut through the golf course
property and necessitated costly re
designing of several holes.
Also,Horton brought attention to
the fact that the creek bed that the C I
trail borders is falling in and eroding
in many areas. Construction of the
trailwould allow Stanford to "restore
and stabilize" the creek bed.
Horton claims that the Universi
ty's CI trail is "in fact what we agreed
to" in the GUP. It is "where the trail is
called for,"he said.
Hr>rton admitted that there is
some ambiguity in the wording of the
GUP, but maintained that the Alpine
Road trail satisfies and fulfills the
conditions of the GUP
The County Board of Supervisors
finally agreed to Stanford's proposal

in December.
Although the Board has ap
proved the CI trail, Horton said
there is still much to be done before it
is finished.
The CI trail crosses through many
governmental jurisdictions, including
San Mateo County and the cities of
Portola Valley and Los Altos Hill&
The next step for Stanford is to con
vince these local governments to
work with the University 011 the con
struction.
Horton said Stanford will accom
plish this by "offering monetary in
centives." In fact, Stanford will offer
$8.4 million to San Mateo County
and $2.8 million to Portola Valley in
formal written offers.
In addition, the University plans
to pay Los Altos Hills just over $1
million to help construct the SI trail.
"This is a very lengthy process,"
explained Horton. However, he
added that Stanford plans to submit
these written offers soon and hopes
the process will proceed as quickly as
possible.
