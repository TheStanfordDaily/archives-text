On the eve of the holiday weekend,
Stanford's Martin Luther King Jr. Re
search and Education Institute appropri
ately celebrated its recent formation in the
Oak Room at Tresidder from noon to 2 p.m
last Friday. An "Annual Open House" suc
ceeded the first ceremony at 3 p.m. in the
King Institute's offices in Cypress Hall,
Founder and director of the Institute,

History Prof. Clayborne Carson graced
the Institute's inauguration with a speech,
as did Prof. Larry Bobo of the Sociology
Department and the Center for Compara
tive Studies in Race and Ethnicity
(CCSRE).
According to a schedule on the re
search group's Web site. Friday's inaugu
ration ushered in a week of similar com
memorative events sponsored by the Insti
tute and other related Stanford organiza
tions like the Office for Religious Life, the
Aurora Forum and the Freeman Spogli In
stitute for International Studies.
The actual inception of the King
Institute, which is now a subdivi
sion of CCSRE, can be dated to
2005, according to the group's Web
site. Ihe King Institute evolved out
of a need "to endow and expand
the work, of the Papers Project."
The King Papers Project is an
extensive and longstanding re
search endeavor that aims to pub
lish every salient written or spo
ken piece by King. Carson has
been at the helm of the project
since 1985, when the King Center
in Atlanta suggested that he spear
head the unprecedented research.
According to the King Insti
tute's Web site, "the King Papers
Project is one of only a few large
scale research ventures focusing
on an African American." The
project, which is now part of the
King Institute's mission, has suc
ceeded in publishing five volumes

of what they expect will be a 14-
volume series of the civil rights
leader's writings.
At the ceremony, several hon
ored guests received the Insti
tute's annual King Awards. The
most well-known were civil rights
folk singers Guy and Candie
Carawan and former Secretary of
State George Shultz. The two mu
sicians sang for the gathering. Re
tired Stanford staff members
Harold Boyd and Wayne Duck
worth, along with local artist-in
residence Drue Kataoka also re
ceived King Awards.
The King Institute was enabled
by generous donations from pri
vate parties and from the Universi
ty. The organization also develops
programs beyond the ongoing King
Papers Project. The Liberation
Curriculum Initiative is one such
sub-focus of the organization, and
has posted a wealth of civil rights
related teaching materials on the
King Institute Web site.
According to the mission state
ment, "the goal of the project is to
create historically accurate and

pedagogically effective curriculum
that addresses issues of social jus
tice, transformation, and reconcili
ation, while meeting state and na
tional standards." A number of les
son plans are available to non
members while access to primary
sources and online discussion fo
rums can be gained through regis
tration with the site.
The King Institute's Public Pro
grams' next exposition is entitled,
"Celebrating South African Free
dom: A Symposium on the Inter
national Campaign to End
Apartheid," which occurs Satur
day, Jan. 21, from 1:00-5:00 p.m. in
Kresge Auditorium.
The retrospective event, which
is also sponsored by the Aurora
Forum and the Education Insti
tute, features a discussion by anti-
Apartheid activists and the pre
miere showing of the documen
tary, "Have You Heard from Jo
hannesburg?" The film is jointly
produced by Carson and Academy
Award nominee Connie Field,
who also served as the documen
tary's director.
