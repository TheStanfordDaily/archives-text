# Stanford sends Katrina students to home schools
## 
### LOREN NEWMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, 38
students were offered admission to Stanford.
All 38— 12 graduates and 26 undergradu
ates — accepted the offer to study at Stan
ford during the 2(M)5 fall quarter, including
three freshmen, seven sophomores.eight jun
iors and eight seniors from eight states and
Mexico. However, the University is not plan
ning to offer an extended acceptance pro
gram. All students were obliged to return to
their previous universities at the conclusion
of the fall quarter regardless of their school's
condition.
Initially. Stanford announced that it
would not be accepting any Katrina trans

fers, hut a few days later — possibly after
witnessing the establishment of similar pro
grams at rival schools — administrators de
cided to admit academically qualified stu
dents from affected universities along the
Gulf Coast. After an accelerated admissions
process, the admitted applicants came from
the battered Gulf Coast schools of Ililane.
Xavier, Dillard and Loyola, some even leav
ing the day after being admitted. Almost half
of the guest students are from California, but
five are from Louisiana. Stanford even of
fered to pay the tuition of admitted students
and waived the mandatory New Student
Orientation fee.
"Students admitted through the autumn
quarter guest program were offered
enrollment for one quarter so that
they could continue their studies
until their universities and colleges
were functioning again," said Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Greg
Boardman. "All the universities that
were affected by Hurricane Katrina
have announced that they will re
open in January."
The schools affected by the hurri
cane are in various states of readiness

for students.
"The school I'm returning to,
Xavier University, is a work in
progress," said sophomore Megan
Minor. "It's definitely not the same
place I left in August, but it will be
better when it's finished."
At Loyola, classes began as
scheduled on Jan. 9. However, at
Dillard. students are still in the
process of picking through flooded
dormitories until Jan. 20. According
to a recent press release, Tulane an
nounced that as of yesterday, the
University was open to 86 percent of
students who attended classes pre-
Katrina — a figure that is admitted
ly impressive only a few months

after the storm. But what of those 14
percent who are left out?
Despite the limited offer of one
quarter only, some students, like
Minor, have been admitted through
the standard transfer application
process for the fall of 2(H)6.
"Guest students are welcome to
apply for transfer status through the
usual admission process," Boardman
said. "If admitted, students would be
offered admission for fall 2(K)6."
"If I could have stayed and fin
ished these next two quarters, I
would have. But I've returned to
New Orleans," Minor said. "[The
Stanford administration] has been
wonderful and very supportive.

They treated us like their own stu
dents. It was like studying abroad for
a semester."
Minor said she plans to be in con
tact with her new friends and profes
sors until she returns as a transfer in
the fall of 2(K)6.
"I'll definitely keep in touch,"
Minor said. "I've made a lot of friends
and enjoyed classes with many of the
professors. I want to thank all the stu
dents I had the pleasure of coming in
contact with, and thanks to all for
making this life-changing transition a
little smoother. Stanford for me was a
wonderful experience; it was defi
nitely different from what I'm used
to. but worthwhile."
