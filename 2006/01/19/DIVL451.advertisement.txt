HSNI-KILLER FLU
The PBS Documentary and a Panel Discussion
Presented by Stanford Health Library and Wide Angle Films
The world watches in fear as reports of the deadly HSNI bird flu increase

Delta, be the epicenter of a related, highly contagious human pandemic?
Watch Wide Angle's "HSNI - Killer Flu" and hear how Stanford doctors and
researchers are preparing to respond to this possible threat.
Thursday, January 19 • 7 p.m.
Fairchild Auditorium, Stanford University Medical Center
