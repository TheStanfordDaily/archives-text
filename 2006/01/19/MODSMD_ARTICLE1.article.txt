Cardinal Men's Basketball Pac-10 Conference Matchups

Few teams have matched the recent suc

joyed at the McKale Center, home of the
Arizona Wildcats. The Cardinal have won
four of the last five meetings in TUcson and
five of the last
seven overall.

The Wild

cats haven't started 10-6 since the 1986-87
season and their 3-3 Pac-10 record is their
worst since 1984-85.
But despite those struggles, Stanford head
coach Trent Johnson and his Cardinal squad
are not taking the Wildcats lightly.
"They look pretty strong to me," Johnson
said. "Everybody, not me included, wants to
say, 'They don't shoot it from the perimeter

Eight reasons why Cardinal men's
basketball will save its season
1 admit it. I jumped on the Cardinal basket
hall team's preseason bandwagon. You can
laugh at me and mock me all you want.
Yes, I enthusiastically gushed about the
Cardinal's ability and predicted them to reach
the Sweet 16 and win the Pacific-10 Confer
ence. Thanks to losses to UC-Davis, Montana
and UC-Irvine,the men's basketball team has
made me look like a fool.
However.the Cardinal's play in the last few
weeks has shown that they could potentially
restore my lost credibility. Well, some of it. I'm
not expecting a Sweet 16 appearance; heck, an
NCAA appearance seems a dream right now.
But let's recap. Aside from those devastat
ing early season losses, the team has faced the
brunt of the "curse of the bouncy floor," exe
cuted poorly and played with little or no
swagger.
Thanks to a wide-open Pac-10, Stanford is
currently locked in a four-way tie for second
place. But I'll proclaim now that I think the
Cardinal have a chance, at least, of closing the
season out on a run hotter than Jessica Alba.
Well, maybe not that hot. Still, I've got eight
reasons why this season can be salvaged.
First, the team is looking like a more cohe
sive unit.
I attribute this to players starting to figure
out their roles. Before this season, there were
two proven returning players, Chris Hernan
dez and Matt Haryasz.
The team is starting to pass better and de
fend better. With two regulars gone from last
season's roster, the players now seem to be
getting coach Trent Johnson's message. It's
like Hickory High in Hoosiers right before
Jimmy Chitwood joins the team. They're get
ting it and it's gonna lead to some great bas
ketball.
Second, the proven guys, Hernandez and

10:15 a.m., four hours before game-time

ready on the Maples Pavilion three-point
line. She was practicing her shot for Satur
day's match against California, hut Rappa

she does it almost every day.
As a rising top-notch scorer for the No.

pahahn averages around seven three-point
attempts in an actual game. The hundreds
she takes outside — the practice — pays
off: whether it was with six total three
pointers against Cal.five against UCLA or
one game-changing three against Oregon.
Rappahahn averages more than three
three-pointers per game and has a .456 per

that she's still not satisfied

Cardinal Men's Basketball Pac-10 Conference Matchups
Heating Up
Streaking men's squad travels
in search of first road win
By ALEX GYR
DESK EDITOR
Few teams have matched the recent suc
cess that Stanford men's basketball has en
joyed at the McKale Center, home of the
Arizona Wildcats. The Cardinal have won
four of the last five meetings in TUcson and
five of the last
seven overall.
Tomorrow,
Stanford (7-6,
3-2 Pacific 10
Conference)
looks to main

up its first
road victory in
a matchup of
two preseason
Pac-10 fa

The Wild
cats, who
were picked
to finish first
in the confer

preseason
media poll,
have stum
bled to a 10-6
record and
are coming
off consecu
tive losses to the Oregon schools. The Wild
cats haven't started 10-6 since the 1986-87
season and their 3-3 Pac-10 record is their
worst since 1984-85.
But despite those struggles, Stanford head
coach Trent Johnson and his Cardinal squad
are not taking the Wildcats lightly.
"They look pretty strong to me," Johnson
said. "Everybody, not me included, wants to
say, 'They don't shoot it from the perimeter
well.' Why do you have to shoot it on the out
side if you can get to the rim so well? Defen

Senior point guard Chris Hernandez drives downcourt to the basket. Hernandez, one of four sen
iors on the Cardinal roster, will attempt to lead Stanford to its first victory away from Maples.
Eight reasons why Cardinal men's
basketball will save its season
1 admit it. I jumped on the Cardinal basket
hall team's preseason bandwagon. You can
laugh at me and mock me all you want.
Yes, I enthusiastically gushed about the
Cardinal's ability and predicted them to reach
the Sweet 16 and win the Pacific-10 Confer
ence. Thanks to losses to UC-Davis, Montana
and UC-Irvine,the men's basketball team has
made me look like a fool.
However.the Cardinal's play in the last few
weeks has shown that they could potentially
restore my lost credibility. Well, some of it. I'm
not expecting a Sweet 16 appearance; heck, an
NCAA appearance seems a dream right now.
But let's recap. Aside from those devastat
ing early season losses, the team has faced the
brunt of the "curse of the bouncy floor," exe
cuted poorly and played with little or no
swagger.
Thanks to a wide-open Pac-10, Stanford is
currently locked in a four-way tie for second
place. But I'll proclaim now that I think the
Cardinal have a chance, at least, of closing the
season out on a run hotter than Jessica Alba.
Well, maybe not that hot. Still, I've got eight
reasons why this season can be salvaged.
First, the team is looking like a more cohe
sive unit.
I attribute this to players starting to figure
out their roles. Before this season, there were
two proven returning players, Chris Hernan
dez and Matt Haryasz.
The team is starting to pass better and de
fend better. With two regulars gone from last
season's roster, the players now seem to be
getting coach Trent Johnson's message. It's
like Hickory High in Hoosiers right before
Jimmy Chitwood joins the team. They're get
ting it and it's gonna lead to some great bas
ketball.
Second, the proven guys, Hernandez and
Haryasz. are stepping it up.
Haryasz has been consistent all year but re
ally turned it on against Cal after facing sur
prising criticism from Johnson. Hernandez, the

Hard work

10:15 a.m., four hours before game-time
and senior guard Krista Rappahahn was al
ready on the Maples Pavilion three-point
line. She was practicing her shot for Satur
day's match against California, hut Rappa
hahn's routine of attempting more than 100
three-pointers is nothing unusual for her —
she does it almost every day.
As a rising top-notch scorer for the No.
14 Stanford women's basketball team, Rap
pahahn averages around seven three-point
attempts in an actual game. The hundreds
she takes outside — the practice — pays
off: whether it was with six total three
pointers against Cal.five against UCLA or
one game-changing three against Oregon.
Rappahahn averages more than three
three-pointers per game and has a .456 per
centage, but what may be more amazing is
that she's still not satisfied
"I'm doing an okay job according to
me," Rappahahn said. "I'd like to shoot bet
ter than I am right now, and I think I can.
My goal is to shoot 50 percent or better
every game, and in the last two games I def
initely haven't been doing that. I've been
close, but I'm not there."
Many of Rappahahn's teammates at
tribute her success to this attitude. With a
strong work ethic and enthusiasm, Rappa
hahn has come to the forefront of the Car
dinal squad in her senior year, averaging
more than 25 minutes of playing time and
more than 10 points.
