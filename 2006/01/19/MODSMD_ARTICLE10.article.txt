# Strike two
## NEGOTIATIONS STALL AGAIN 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
Union leaders say they are ready fora 48-
hour strike at the Stanford Hospitals on
Tuesday, Jan. 24. As the Hospitals prepare for
a likely strike, their representatives and the
Service Employees International Union
Local 715 (SEIU) each met independently
with a federal mediator Tuesday. No dates
have been set for resumed talks. If no resolu
tion is reached by Jan. 23, there will be anoth
er strike, union representatives said.
In a separate negotiation. University rep
resentatives will meet with the SEIU today
to discuss re-opened portions of the contract
covering service workers. Workers voted last
Thursday to reject the University's latest
offer and authorize their negotiating team to
call a future strike if necessary.
"We are organizing all the support need
ed to carry out a successful strike [at the Hos
pitals]," said SEIU Chief Spokesperson John
Vellardita. "The timeline is ticking away."
The Hospitals said they are ready fora
strike.
"Through the process, we have always had
contingency plans in place for any type of
work stoppage," said Hospitals Spokes

woman Sarah Staley. "Patient care has been,
remains and always will be our priority."
Hospital workers voted by a 90 percent
margin last week to reject the latest contract
offer by the Hospitals and to authorize a
strike, the union said.
Staley said the Hospitals have doubts
about the union claim that 90 percent voted
to reject their proposal. She said that the
union refuses to disclose how many of their
members voted and said she doubts that all
the workers were completely and honestly
informed by union leaders about what they
were voting for.
Union negotiators expressed a willing
ness to strike if they feel it becomes neces
sary.
"We have offered to return to the bargain
ing table to discuss job security, healthcare
coverage and comparable market wages,"
said Jesus Andrade, chair of the Stanford
Hospital Bargaining Team, in a press release.
"We approach these discussions with the out
look to resolve this at the bargaining table
but if need be. we will strike again if we are
forced to."
Staley said that the Hospitals' representa-
tives were ready to bargain on Tues
day, but there was no face-to-face
meeting.
"We were prepared to meet with
the SEIU leadership and a federal
mediator on Jan. 17," she said. "The
mediator met with us first. He told us
he wanted the parties to meet face to
face to start the process. We agreed.
The mediator then went to the SEIU
team. An hour later, the mediator
came back and said there would be
no face to face meeting.The mediator
did not say why, but the Hospitals re
mained willing to meet."
SEIU served Stanford Hospital
and the Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital with a 10-day strike notice
last Friday. A petition with 1,000
worker signatures reiterated de
mands fora renewed contract, the
union said.
The Hospitals said they were dis

appointed by the decision to give of
ficial notice about a strike.
"While we support the right of our
employees to union representation,
we're disappointed that their leader
ship is resorting to work stoppages
instead of negotiating in good faith."
said Martha Marsh, president and
chief executive officer of Stanford
Hospital and Clinics, in a press re
lease.
The Hospitals said they hope that
some of the unionized employees will
cross the picket line in the instance of
a strike on Tuesday. A one-page flyer
prepared by the Hospitals and ob
tained by 'Hie Daily asks: "What do
SEIU leaders have to hide?" ITie
flyer tells workers they have the right
to work on Jan. 24. It ends in bold
caps-lock,"Use your voice! Use your
vote! Come to work!"
The Stanford Labor Action

Coalition (SLAC) is also in the
process of updating their Web site,
preparing informative pieces and
planning information sessions in the
case of a strike.
"The main thing is to make sure
people have access to as much infor
mation as they want," said SLAC
spokesman Matt Seriff-Cullick. a
sophomore.
The Union wants a salary in
crease, contract guarantees that jobs
will not be outsourced and health in
surance for employees and their fam
ilies at no cost.
Over sixteen percent, or 1,412 of
the 8,432, of employees at the 1 lospi
tals are covered by the union. The
SEIU Local represents housekeep
ers, food service workers, nursing as
sistants and certain technicians at the
Hospitals. They have been working
without a contract since Nov. 13.
