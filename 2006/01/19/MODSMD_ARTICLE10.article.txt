### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
Union leaders say they are ready fora 48-
hour strike at the Stanford Hospitals on
Tuesday, Jan. 24. As the Hospitals prepare for
a likely strike, their representatives and the
Service Employees International Union
Local 715 (SEIU) each met independently
with a federal mediator Tuesday. No dates
have been set for resumed talks. If no resolu

In a separate negotiation. University rep

union refuses to disclose how many of their
members voted and said she doubts that all
the workers were completely and honestly
informed by union leaders about what they
were voting for.
Union negotiators expressed a willing
ness to strike if they feel it becomes neces

"We have offered to return to the bargain

said Jesus Andrade, chair of the Stanford
Hospital Bargaining Team, in a press release.
"We approach these discussions with the out

Staley said that the Hospitals' representa-
