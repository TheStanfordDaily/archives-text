## Energy Bowl targets dorm conservation 
### MANDY KOVACH STAFF WRITER 
The efforts of Students fora Sustainable Stanford (SSS) to raise

environmental awareness and promote practical ways for the

University to achieve sustainable and efficient environmental

practices culminated in last January's first installment of

the Great Annual Stanford Energy Bowl and Water
Derby.
In the hopes mirroring this success, this year's compe-

tition kicked off at the beginning of the quarter and will last
through February. Each undergraduate house will compete to save
the most energy and water for various prizes, including energy or
water-saving technology installed at their residences.
"The Energy Bowl and Water Derby is an inter-dorm compe
tition that records the energy and water usage for each house or
dorm and compares that to the amounts used during the same pe
riod last year," said sophomore Nastassia Patin, the financial
manager of SSS. "There are two categories within the competi
tion. The first consists of all dorms — including Flo Mo, Stern.
Wilbur, FroSoCo — as well as Kimball, andToyon.The

second is made of Row and cluster houses, which include Yost
and East."
In each category, the dorm with the largest percentage de
crease wins prizes for each resident in the dorm or house. Ac
cording to Patin. last year's winner was FloMo, and each of
its students won a mug.This year, the winning residents may
find T-shirts waiting for them at the finish line —in addition *

to the free installation of an energy
saving appliance, she said.
Patin said she is very excited about
the strides the project has made in the
last year.
"I've taken part in some major
sustainability projects." she said. "I
am very enthusiastic, and 1 think this
is one of the best things our club
does."
Sophomore Gregory Lee, an SSS
member in his second year of work
ing on the competition,said the group
has met its original goal to raise indi
vidual awareness of energy use.
"I think the competition — where
it's properly publicized — adds
awareness and accessibility to the
problems of energy and water use,"
Lee said.'i think that it shows people
that their personal energy and water
use actually has an effect, even
though they never see the bill for it. In
this way, we get people to be more
conscious of their personal use, which
is the first step toward using less."
However, Lee added that he's also
ready to see the competition expand
even more in the next several years.
"That said, there are definitely

some parts of campus that miss out on
the competition," he said. "Last year,
some dorms heard about the compe
tition once in dorm meeting.and then
forgot about it, or didn't hear about it
at all. 'ITie key is we need people to
think about the competition for its
duration. When that happens, the
competition is a success. I think that
that happened in many places around
campus last year, and so I would label
the competition a success. But I also
think that we can do better and reach
more people."
Though participating in the com
petition for the first time, freshmen
members of SSS said they were also
enthusiastic about the event.
Freshman Kristen Barta, a mem
ber of SSS and resident of Branner,
said that while she has never worked
fora project similar to the Energy
Bowl and Water Derby, she thinks it
has the potential to be a great suc
cess.
"I've never been involved in plan
ning an event on the same scale as the
derby, simply because I previously
have never encountered students so
dedicated and motivated to take on
such a challenge," she said. "It's very
exciting to see the great things that
such a small group of students can or
ganize and bring to life, as well as the
impact and change that come of
them."
