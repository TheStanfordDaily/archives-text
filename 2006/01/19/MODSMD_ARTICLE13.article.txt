# SPECIAL EVENT
## Heart transplant recipient raises awareness 
### ARAM HUR STAFF WRITER 
It appears at first that Gaea Shaw, author of the recent
release, "Dying to Live" is very much like any other
woman her age. She goes on prom dress hunts with her
daughter, teaches her how to drive and has a witty sense of
humor. What is not so casual, however, is that these daily
practices would not have been possible if not fora heart
transplant eight years ago.
On Oct. 26.1997, Shaw found out she had an inherited
heart disease called cardiomyopathy. Her state was only
curable through a heart transplant, a procedure extreme
ly risky and rare due to the low number of organ donors.
According to Shaw, she was saved from being one of the
approximately 17 patients that die every day due to the
unavailability of an organ.
"I'm happy to be here." Shaw said to an audience in
Building 2(X). "Saying that takes on a new sense of mean
ing when you've been at the brink of death."
Since her second chance at life. Shaw has reached out
in many ways to share her private story and increase
awareness about organ and tissue donation. Last night's
event is onlv one of manv wavs Shaw has endeavored to
I 1m
happy to be
here," says Shaw

spread her message. Only nine months after her
transplant, she competed in her first U.S. Trans
plant Games and won gold medals for swimming.
The Transplant Games are Olympic-fashioned
competitions for organ transplant recipients. To
this day, she has competed in four U.S. and three
World Transplant Games total, amassing a dozen
gold, one bronze and seven silver medals for
swimming. She also authored "Dying to Live," a
personal memoir of her journey before, during
and after the transplant.
Her book differentiates itself from other
organ donation accounts because Shaw had the
opportunity to meet both her donor's family and
the nurse who cared for her 15-year-old donor,
Christopher Kuhlman, who died in a car accident.
Her union with the Kuhlmans was an extreme
rarity, as receiver and donor information is kept
strictly confidential. According to Shaw, only
when both parties happen to write to the Organ
Procurement Organization expressing their will
ingness to meet the other is such an event possi
ble.
"It was very magnificently intense, it was very
loving." Shaw said of the reunion. "There was a
tremendous connection between us."
Shaw also recalled an emotional moment
when Mrs. Kuhlman, tears streaming down her
face, called Shaw's name, asking if she could listen
to her son's heart beat.
Organ Donation Education, the University or
ganization that put together the event, is piloted
by a group of passionate undergraduates devoted
to raising awareness about the importance of
organ and tissue donation.
"Our goal is not to convince people to donate
organs but to educate people about the possibili
ty in it, to make people talk about it," said senior
Terrell Stevenson, president of Organ Donation
Education. "And there are a lot of myths out there
— mainly the myth that if you sign up to be an
organ donor, doctors will not try their hardest at
critical states."
Stevenson expressed her disbelief at how
many people had asked her about such myths and
hoped that organizations like hers would clarify
such doubts.
According to junior Kenneth Shaw, one of the
special events co-chairs who spearheaded the
presentation, such speaker talks are only one of
the many ways the organization attempts to
spread the word.
"We also have other programs like high school
teaching and organ transplant shadowing." Shaw

said. He summed up his experience working with
organ donation issues as "learning about your
own potential."
"You realize how much of an impact you have
on other people's lives," he said.
It is precisely because of that impact that Gaea
Shaw is living her life to the fullest potential. She
encourages those who have not yet signed their
organ donor cards to do so.
"1 want them to consider if life circumstances
suddenly changed and they were in need of an
organ, where that organ would come from," she
said. According to Shaw, there are 90,000 patients
on the waitlist for organs even today.
Shaw continued, calling her experience not a
transplant but a transformation.
"1 worry less. I'm more grateful, I feel more
peace, I've learned how to reach out for support
and accept it when it comes my way," she said.
"Those are things I didn't know I was going to get
— I thought I was getting a heart."
Toward the end of her talk. Shaw repeatedly
underscored the importance of learning gratitude

— in the sense of both giving and reeeiving. She
lamented that today's independent culture makes
it easy to give but very hard to ask for help. How
ever, she encouraged all of the listeners not to be
afraid of happily and thankfully accepting sup
port when needed. Her life is a testament to how
such debts can be repaid.
"The Kuhlmans have lost someone they loved,
but that person they loved has become a hero,"
she said. "Mv whole life is a thank you. an expres
sion of gratitude. I give thanks and blessings to
Christopher's family every day."
It was such notions of interactive gratitude
that especially touched Pinyi Ko, a freshman in
the audience.
"There seems to be a general lack of gratitude
and thank for life in general these days, and it was
really nice to come and see this happen." Ko said.
Despite admitting that she didn't personally
know anyone with an organ transplant, she still
left the talk deeply moved.
"I'm kind of left speechless right now," Ko
said.

It is precisely because of that impact that Gaea
Shaw is living her life to the fullest potential. She
encourages those who have not yet signed their
organ donor cards to do so.
"1 want them to consider if life circumstances
suddenly changed and they were in need of an
organ, where that organ would come from," she
said. According to Shaw, there are 90,000 patients
on the waitlist for organs even today.
Shaw continued, calling her experience not a
transplant but a transformation.
"1 worry less. I'm more grateful, I feel more
peace, I've learned how to reach out for support
and accept it when it comes my way," she said.
"Those are things I didn't know I was going to get
— I thought I was getting a heart."
Toward the end of her talk. Shaw repeatedly
underscored the importance of learning gratitude

— in the sense of both giving and reeeiving. She
lamented that today's independent culture makes
it easy to give but very hard to ask for help. How
ever, she encouraged all of the listeners not to be
afraid of happily and thankfully accepting sup
port when needed. Her life is a testament to how
such debts can be repaid.
"The Kuhlmans have lost someone they loved,
but that person they loved has become a hero,"
she said. "Mv whole life is a thank you. an expres
sion of gratitude. I give thanks and blessings to
Christopher's family every day."
It was such notions of interactive gratitude
that especially touched Pinyi Ko, a freshman in
the audience.
"There seems to be a general lack of gratitude
and thank for life in general these days, and it was
really nice to come and see this happen." Ko said.
Despite admitting that she didn't personally
know anyone with an organ transplant, she still
left the talk deeply moved.
"I'm kind of left speechless right now," Ko
said.

Heart transplant recipient Gaea Shaw shares her experiences with students. Shaw received the heart of a
15-year-old car accident victim eight years ago.
It appears at first that Gaea Shaw, author of the recent
release, "Dying to Live" is very much like any other
woman her age. She goes on prom dress hunts with her
daughter, teaches her how to drive and has a witty sense of
humor. What is not so casual, however, is that these daily
practices would not have been possible if not fora heart
transplant eight years ago.
On Oct. 26.1997, Shaw found out she had an inherited
heart disease called cardiomyopathy. Her state was only
curable through a heart transplant, a procedure extreme
ly risky and rare due to the low number of organ donors.
According to Shaw, she was saved from being one of the
approximately 17 patients that die every day due to the
unavailability of an organ.
"I'm happy to be here." Shaw said to an audience in
Building 2(X). "Saying that takes on a new sense of mean
ing when you've been at the brink of death."
Since her second chance at life. Shaw has reached out
in many ways to share her private story and increase
awareness about organ and tissue donation. Last night's
event is onlv one of manv wavs Shaw has endeavored to
I 1m
happy to be
here," says Shaw

spread her message. Only nine months after her
transplant, she competed in her first U.S. Trans
plant Games and won gold medals for swimming.
The Transplant Games are Olympic-fashioned
competitions for organ transplant recipients. To
this day, she has competed in four U.S. and three
World Transplant Games total, amassing a dozen
gold, one bronze and seven silver medals for
swimming. She also authored "Dying to Live," a
personal memoir of her journey before, during
and after the transplant.
Her book differentiates itself from other
organ donation accounts because Shaw had the
opportunity to meet both her donor's family and
the nurse who cared for her 15-year-old donor,
Christopher Kuhlman, who died in a car accident.
Her union with the Kuhlmans was an extreme
rarity, as receiver and donor information is kept
strictly confidential. According to Shaw, only
when both parties happen to write to the Organ
Procurement Organization expressing their will
ingness to meet the other is such an event possi
ble.
"It was very magnificently intense, it was very
loving." Shaw said of the reunion. "There was a
tremendous connection between us."
Shaw also recalled an emotional moment
when Mrs. Kuhlman, tears streaming down her
face, called Shaw's name, asking if she could listen
to her son's heart beat.
Organ Donation Education, the University or
ganization that put together the event, is piloted
by a group of passionate undergraduates devoted
to raising awareness about the importance of
organ and tissue donation.
"Our goal is not to convince people to donate
organs but to educate people about the possibili
ty in it, to make people talk about it," said senior
Terrell Stevenson, president of Organ Donation
Education. "And there are a lot of myths out there
— mainly the myth that if you sign up to be an
organ donor, doctors will not try their hardest at
critical states."
Stevenson expressed her disbelief at how
many people had asked her about such myths and
hoped that organizations like hers would clarify
such doubts.
According to junior Kenneth Shaw, one of the
special events co-chairs who spearheaded the
presentation, such speaker talks are only one of
the many ways the organization attempts to
spread the word.
"We also have other programs like high school
teaching and organ transplant shadowing." Shaw

said. He summed up his experience working with
organ donation issues as "learning about your
own potential."
"You realize how much of an impact you have
on other people's lives," he said.
It is precisely because of that impact that Gaea
Shaw is living her life to the fullest potential. She
encourages those who have not yet signed their
organ donor cards to do so.
"1 want them to consider if life circumstances
