encounter rooms where they can let
out anger on punching bags."

Bad grade on a midterm? Drama in the dorm? Trouble get
ting tenure? What if there was a place on campus where
students and faculty were actually encouraged to act out
their aggressions to relieve stress? This is what administrators of
Southwest Jiaotong University in China had in mind when they
created a new "anger management" room.
According to The China Daily, the room was fashioned in an
attempt to decrease depression and suicide among stressed-out
students. Students are encouraged to use the room to let out
their frustration in a controlled environment. The walls of the
room are lined with sandbags that can be etched with the faces
of generic enemy figures. Campus health professionals are also
on hand to help students cope with their anger.
The school "want[ed] to help students let out their intense
animosity or hostility without storing up such hatred," Ning
Weiwei. who is credited with designing the anger management
room, told The China Daily. Ning is a psychology professor at
Southwest Jiaotong University.
Emotional and academic stresses are just as familiar to Stan
ford students as they are to students at Southwest Jiatong Uni
versity, which is located in China's southwestern province of
Sichuan. But most Stanford students seem to think that such an
institutionalized outlet for aggression is a bad idea.
"It might intimidate people,or it might only intensify depres-

sion," says Carol Cao, a junior at Stanford. "It doesn't seem like
the ideai answer. Counseling or encouraging people to talk to
friends might be more productive."
Although the anger management room in China was de
signed with students in mind, it has proved popular among uni
versity faculty as well. However, Stanford's Assistant Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education Susie Brubaker-Cole
says she disagrees with the concept of such a room.
"The university experience should be one where students
can take what they have learned and apply it in the situations
they encounter outside of the 'ivory tower,"' she explains. "In
the outside world, students are not going to encounter rooms
where they can go let out anger on punching bags. I also think
we should hold higher standards for people like faculty mem
bers than that."
Despite the academic and emotional stresses that many
Stanford students encounter, the laid-back, peaceful atmos
phere on the Farm seems to clash with the idea of a venue for
aggression.
The China Daily states that creating an environment where
the release of aggression is specifically encouraged also raises
questions about human psychology. It is too early to determine
whether visiting the anger management room fosters positive
emotional results. Some are also concerned that a special out

let for anger could adversely affect mental health.
Experts like Chen Xin. a psychologist with the Institute of
Sociology under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,
have pointed out that the anger management room is only a
temporary solution to deep-rooted problems among young
people.
"China's elite education system and rapid economic devel
opment have misled young students," Xin told The China
Daily. These have undermined the traditional values of toler
ance and patience that are espoused by Chinese philosophy.
One question that remains is whether the anger management
room concept can be spread to other venues. Some supporters
have suggested taking the concept a step further, implementing
such rooms in the workplace.
Though the Southwest Jiaotong University faculty has good
intentions, some people at Stanford say they prefer more tra
ditional forms of counseling rather than taking it to the mat
when it comes to reducing depression and suicide rates.
"In the case of suicide, there should just be more psycholog
ical counseling services or something," says Stanford freshman
Nabill Idrisi."Letting out physical anger to deal with depression
would not fix the problem. Facilities like Vaden Health Center
and peer counseling are available for students here, so I think
Stanford can do without an anger management room."
