# Losing body-image rationality, one elliptical stride at a time
## 
### 
I got hack from the gym this morning to
find an unpleasant surprise on my answer
ing machine. I hit the flashing red 'play'
button to find that a disgruntled male caller
had left me a message demanding: Where was
I and why was I also not answering my cell
phone! '.' How dare / escape to the gym for two
hours! I thought to myself, fuming all through
my high water pressure shower.
I mean, seriously, I get to the gym for five
or six hours in a good week. So, when I'm at
the gym. I don't take my cell phone. In fact, I
think about only two things: me and myself.
So what? That's my favorite part of going to
the gym — the selfish, self-discovery time.
It's my therapy. It's a time when I get com
pletely lost in my personal thoughts and I

don't have to listen to anyone else talk about
anything else. I get to wonder if I'm going to
die alone in a loft full of medical journals,
copies of The New York Times and cats (and
whether that would be so bad). I get to won
der if I can really handle a high-powered ca
reer that involves life and death, if I give
enough back, how many more episodes it will
take before Meredith and Dr. McDreamv fi

nally sleep together again and if I can actual
ly make new friends in a big city like Los An
geles or Seattle. 1 even contemplate my next
column...occasionally.
And I think aboui the obvious at 24 Hour
Fitness: my body, especially the flabby parts.
When I compare myself to the Mountain
View and Palo Alto people working out
around me. I feel average — sometimes even
above average, particularly if it's soccer mom
afternoon time. But if the televisions are
tuned into a show with a stick-thin actress, I
usually run an extra mile or two and swear off
dinner for the next two nights.
I know it's not just me. because my friends
are all equally obsessed with body image. I find
it so aggravating that people as intelligent as us

fall into the same pop culture trap as main
stream society. We must be smarter than that.
Can't we apply our fancy private school liberal
arts critical thinking education to real life?
Yet I can't quite explain the completely ir
rational desire to be ridiculously thin and
toned. Iliat's the problem — it is irrational.
But reason and knowledge go a long way in
staying healthy, both mentally and physically.
Weight is, to a pretty large degree, geneti
cally determined. So no matter what, it is im
possible for most of us to be stick-thin or per
fectly sculpted. Most people who diet or
starve weight off end up gaining it back fair
ly quickly because the body's metabolism
slows as less food is ingested. In effect, your
body burns fewer calories when you eat less.

Cconsequently, you also end up feeling lethar
gic and are less likely to exercise.
It is generally accepted that eating more
frequent, smaller meals is better than eating
fewer large meals. Consuming healthy varied
meals comprised of vegetables, fruits, low-fat
dairy and whole grains throughout the day
helps keep your metabolism boosted and
prevents cravings. Consistent exercise sched
ules also help your body burn fat. Typically,
30 to 45 minutes of aerobic exercise at least
three to four times per week is recommend
ed for us normal folks wishing to burn fat and
get fit/stay fit.
