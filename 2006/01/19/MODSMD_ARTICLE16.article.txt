## Hope: is it justified? 
### 
Recently, a group of friends insisted
that 1 soften my cynical shell of pes
simism. an enclosure that has provid
ed a cozy nest for me. These hearty souls
seemed so willing in their requests that I now
feel compelled to give the whole subject of
hope a critical scrutiny — from why it does
n't make sense to why some people lose it.
What is hope? First, it is ini optimistic be
lief about uncertain future states of affairs. 1 112 1
have sure knowledge that it will rain tomor
row, I cannot hope it rains — I know that it
will rain. I cannot hope that one plus one
equals two. For any hope to materialize, un
certainty is requisite. Moreover, the content
of the belief must benefit me somehow. 1
can't hope that I lose the lottery — unless I
want to lose the lottery.
Proponents of hope argue that it induces a
beneficial, self-fulfilling prophecy. Because I
hope that the future will turn out in a way I
want, I have an uplifting and positive attitude
in my endeavors. Because I have an uplifting
and positive attitude, the future is more likely
to turn out the way I want. On the other hand,
so I am told, rejection of hope induces a bad
self-fulfilling prophecy. I may take to drinking
because I am hopeless about the future.Then
I may become all the more hopeless because I
took to drinking. (Credit George Orwell for
that last one.)
Now, the question I want to explore is
whether hope is actually a beneficial state of
mind.
Proponents of hope may cling to the idea
of a self-fulfilling prophecy. But to me, this
doesn't seem very feasible. For instance, what
kind of self-fulfilling prophecy are we talking
about? If it were something of the kind "I
hope that I hope," then it would be trivial.
However, what proponents usually have in
mind is something like:" I hope that I will suc
ceed." I, for my part, fail to see just how hop
ing can bring about or cause success.
If I am convinced to hope with the prom
ise that hope will bring about success, this
may actually bring about failure. I may think
that since I am hoping that I will succeed, I
have done all that is required to succeed: "I
am hoping, so I must succeed" — a grossly
false judgment indeed. Assigning hope
causal efficacy distracts the hoper from atti
tudes that are actually causally effective and
not just cosmetic.
People are also quick to point out the revi
talizing effects of hope. One might be going
through difficult times, but hope may help get
her through.To this, I can only say that the in
jurious aspects of hope are underemphasized.
I may hope that I'll get a good grade on an
exam. Yet. if 1 do badly, the disappointment
will be multiplied due to my previous hope.
Hope is not as innocent as many believe.
It seems wholly wrong to me to believe
something on insufficient grounds, and espe
cially something grounded in hope (I am as
suming that hope is belief without sufficient
evidence about the future). If I am allowed to

believe on insufficient grounds, then I can
just about hope for anything (provided that
there is enough uncertainty about its likeli
hood). Suppose that 1 am to hope that when
1 Hip eight coins, they'll all come out heads.
Given that 1 am allowed to hope on insuffi
cient grounds. 1 don't see what prevents me
from hoping for such a possibility, as counter
intuitive and irrational as it might seem. If I
do not allow myself this hope but stick to a
more probable one (such as four heads and
four tails), then I am already incorporating
evidence. My belief then isn't so much a hope
but a rational guess.
I don't think what drives some people to a
lack of hope is any of these considerations. 1
don't think many people think about hope
very much, and when they give upon it, it's not
due to some abstract reflection on the nature
of hope. I think despair is a more impulsive
and basic reaction.
That basic reaction that I have in mind re
lates to boredom and dissatisfaction with
hope. A person who is in a continual state of
hope may finally decide "the hell with the fu
ture." It's a breaking point, a rebellion, a
catharsis in which one gives up on the future
and decides to embrace the present as it is.
There is an ironic flavor in this experience.
The irony stems from the chasm between
one's previous hopeful state and the current
state of resignation. One now reconciles him
or herself to the present and, at that moment,
ceases to take one's self too seriously.
1 think there is also another aspect to let
ting go of hope — uniqueness. In a culture
that pressures its individuals to feel good all
the time, coming to terms with despair means
individuating one's self from all the (perhaps
bogus) shiny, happy faces around us.
Finally, hopelessness need not paralyze
one into inaction. When one reconciles her
self to the idea that the future probably will
not be desirable, it still can't hurt to try to
change things.
Even though I cannot promise hope to
those parties who so good-heartedly tried to
convince me to hope. I loosen my grip on pes
simism and grant them my skepticism about
the future.
Nevertheless, they can always count on my
ironv
