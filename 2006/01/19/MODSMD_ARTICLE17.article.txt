## Senate trying to tame ASSU spending 
### CHRIS NGUYEN 
The Daily pointed out the root of the
problems with the student group funding
system in an editorial yesterday ("ASSU
needs to overhaul budget approval process,"
Jan. 18): a lack of accountability over many
years.
For too long, the Senate consented to
funding ludicrous expenses like signs for po
litical protests, souvenir T-shirts for student
groups and weekly meals for group mem
bers at meetings. As a member of the Senate
Appropriations Committee last year, I re
peatedly objected to these pork barrel proj
ects. However, the rest of the committee
used the excuse that these groups were "spe
cial and deserve[d]" funding for these
bizarre boondoggles. This excuse was used
time and again by last year's senators, and al
most certainly by previous years' senators, to
defend their fiscal recklessness.
Years of overspending were buffered by a
$700,000 general fee surplus left over from
1999, when the ASSU Senate divided into
the Undergraduate Senate and the Gradu
ate Student Council. Before that, the gradu
ate senators were able to keep undergradu
ate spending in check, as they typically
served for longer periods of time and were
more willing to make unpopular funding
cuts to protect the system from bankruptcy.
When the old ASSU Senate divided, the
general fee surplus was also divided into un
dergraduate and graduate portions. The
graduates held their portion steady while the
undergraduates allowed spending to ex
plode.
The increased spending finally resulted in
the shutdown of general fee funding for stu
dent groups last winter. After the election of
the new senators in the spring, we imple
mented new. tougher funding policies. Fund
ing caps for meeting food and event food
were lowered, food had accounted for over
$104,000 in spending the previous year
(overspending of the entire general fee to
taled $158,000). Equipment expenses were
no longer funded in full, switching to an 80
percent subsidy.

However, it became clear during fall
quarter that these restrictions were simply
not enough to deal with the shortfall. The
senate secured a contract with Copy Ameri
ca for cheaper copies for Stanford students
and then funded student groups at the Copy-
America rates; this may seem trivial, but
copies accounted for nearly $30,000 of last
year's spending. We banned meeting food,
restricting food only to campus-wide events.
Yet, this still was not enough to make
funding sustainable. At the close of fall quar
ter. a joint committee of the Undergraduate
Senate and Graduate Student Council took
a critical look at the undergraduate funding
policies. The joint committee recommended
implementing a soft cap and a system of
matching funds for honoraria. The Appro
priations Committee then implemented a
$40 per group member soft cap and required
any honoraria above $1 ,(H)() be matched with
other sources of funding.
Will this be the last round of restrictions
011 the General Fee? We hope so. Do we
know? Frankly, no. After last year's disaster,
this is a year of experimentation.This will en
able the Undergraduate Senate to find poli
cies that will make the system sustainable for
the foreseeable future so that in future years
senators, student groups and students will
not have to grapple with this problem.
Students stand at a crossroads. Are these
funding policies what you want your fund
ing system to look like? Is $40 per member
an appropriate level to fund a student
group? If your answer is yes, then keep the
general fee where it is. If you believe stu
dents should be taxed more to increase lev
els of funding for student groups, then vote
to increase the general fee in the spring
quarter election. If $40 per member is too
high and the Senate policies are still too
generous, then you should vote to decrease
the general fee. The decision rests with the
student body. The Senate can only set poli
cies within the amount of money students
give to us to give back to groups.
