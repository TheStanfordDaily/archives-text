# Cardinal Men's Basketball Pac-10 Conference Matchups
## Heating Up Streaking men's squad travels in search of first road win 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
Few teams have matched the recent suc
cess that Stanford men's basketball has en
joyed at the McKale Center, home of the
Arizona Wildcats. The Cardinal have won
four of the last five meetings in TUcson and

five of the last
seven overall.
Tomorrow,
Stanford (7-6,
3-2 Pacific 10

record and

cats haven't started 10-6 since the 1986-87
season and their 3-3 Pac-10 record is their
worst since 1984-85.
But despite those struggles, Stanford head
coach Trent Johnson and his Cardinal squad
are not taking the Wildcats lightly.
"They look pretty strong to me," Johnson
said. "Everybody, not me included, wants to
say, 'They don't shoot it from the perimeter
well.' Why do you have to shoot it on the out
side if you can get to the rim so well? Defen
sively, this team is really talented and really
good. They can really cause problems. Can
anyone remember the last time Arizona has
