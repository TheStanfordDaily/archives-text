# Cardinal Men's Basketball Pac-10 Conference Matchups

Few teams have matched the recent suc

Arizona Wildcats. The Cardinal have won
four of the last five meetings in TUcson and

five of the last

lost three in a row?"
It's been more than 20 years
since the Wildcats lost three Pac-10
games in a row (IVS4-85) — while
Johnson was still coaching high
school basketball in Boise.
Iliis year's Arizona squad is
clearly not the same team as the
one that came frustratingly close
to reaching the Final Four last sea
son. Ilie Wildcats lost their two
top scorers Salim Stoudamire and
Channing Frye to the NBA and
sophomore guard Jawaan McClel
lan missed the first 14 games of
the season due to academic ineli
gibility.
Fortunately for the Wildcats,
senior guard Hassan Adams has
been there to pick up the slack.
Adams is leading the Pac-10 in scor
ing with just over 20 points per
game and has been a force inside as
well with 5.8 rebounds, good
enough for second on the team.
"Hassan is a handful," Johnson
said. "I don't think there is anyone
in the conference who can guard
him. Hopefully we can contain him
and slow him down."
The Wildcats are likely to use
Adams inside, creating possible
matchup problems fora front line
that may be depleted for the week
end series in the desert. Sophomore
center Peter Prowitt missed practice
this week with an injured back that
has hampered him in recent weeks.
Prowitt is expected to play in relief
of senior forward Matt Haryasz.

We want to make sure
[Hernandez] is as
healthy as possible,
especially considering
the pressure we're going
to face come Thursday
— TRENT JOHNSON

Prowitt wasn't the only Cardinal
with an injured back,as senior guard
Chris Hernandez tweaked his back
in practice earlier this week. He was
cleared to return to practice, but the
coaching staff opted to give him a
day off to recover, and he should be
healthy for tomorrow's game.
"We want to make sure that
[Hernandez] is as healthy as possi
ble, especially considering the pres
sure we're going to face come
Thursday," Johnson said.
Hernandez looks to add to his
career point total, which topped the
1.000 mark, after he scored 20
against California last Friday. With
1,011 points, Hernandez is just the
34th player in Stanford history to
score more than 1,000 in a career.
But Johnson knows that despite
Hernandez's recent hot streak.

even the senior guard might have
trouble against an athletic and
stingy Arizona defense.
"They are probably the best de
fensive team in the league in their
abilities to get into the passing lanes,
be active and steal the basketball
and go on big runs" Johnson said.
With the injury problems as well
as the assigned task of slowing one
of the nation's most explosive play
ers in Adams, the Cardinal's game
at Arizona State (7-8,1 -5) on Satur
day may have slipped to the back of
the team's collective mind.
Much like the Wildcats, the Sun
Devils lost their best player to the
NBA in Ike Diogu. Diogu almost
single-handedly led ASU to two
wins over the Cardinal last season,
combining for 67 points and 26 re
bounds in the pair of victories.
Without Diogu, the Sun Devils
have struggled. Two weeks ago, they
were swept by the Los Angeles
schools but dropped each game by
just one point. ASU finally picked
up its first conference win last
weekend, taking care of Oregon
State in overtime.
Offensively, the Sun Devils have
relied on the scoring of two guards,
Kevin Kruger and Bryson Krueger,
who have averaged 14.3 and 13
points respectively.
While the Wildcats may be the
primary threat, if the Cardinal
aren't careful they could be looking
at a third straight loss at the hands
of the Sun Devils.

lost three in a row?"
It's been more than 20 years
since the Wildcats lost three Pac-10
games in a row (IVS4-85) — while
Johnson was still coaching high
school basketball in Boise.
Iliis year's Arizona squad is
clearly not the same team as the
one that came frustratingly close
to reaching the Final Four last sea
son. Ilie Wildcats lost their two
top scorers Salim Stoudamire and
Channing Frye to the NBA and
sophomore guard Jawaan McClel
lan missed the first 14 games of
the season due to academic ineli
gibility.
Fortunately for the Wildcats,
senior guard Hassan Adams has
been there to pick up the slack.
Adams is leading the Pac-10 in scor
ing with just over 20 points per
game and has been a force inside as
well with 5.8 rebounds, good
enough for second on the team.
"Hassan is a handful," Johnson
said. "I don't think there is anyone
in the conference who can guard
him. Hopefully we can contain him
and slow him down."
The Wildcats are likely to use
Adams inside, creating possible
matchup problems fora front line
that may be depleted for the week
end series in the desert. Sophomore
center Peter Prowitt missed practice
this week with an injured back that
has hampered him in recent weeks.
Prowitt is expected to play in relief
of senior forward Matt Haryasz.

We want to make sure
[Hernandez] is as
healthy as possible,
especially considering
the pressure we're going
to face come Thursday
— TRENT JOHNSON

Prowitt wasn't the only Cardinal
with an injured back,as senior guard
Chris Hernandez tweaked his back
in practice earlier this week. He was
cleared to return to practice, but the
coaching staff opted to give him a
day off to recover, and he should be
healthy for tomorrow's game.
"We want to make sure that
[Hernandez] is as healthy as possi
ble, especially considering the pres
sure we're going to face come
Thursday," Johnson said.
Hernandez looks to add to his
career point total, which topped the
1.000 mark, after he scored 20
against California last Friday. With
1,011 points, Hernandez is just the
34th player in Stanford history to
score more than 1,000 in a career.
But Johnson knows that despite
Hernandez's recent hot streak.

even the senior guard might have
trouble against an athletic and
stingy Arizona defense.
"They are probably the best de
fensive team in the league in their
abilities to get into the passing lanes,
be active and steal the basketball
and go on big runs" Johnson said.
With the injury problems as well
as the assigned task of slowing one
of the nation's most explosive play
ers in Adams, the Cardinal's game
at Arizona State (7-8,1 -5) on Satur
day may have slipped to the back of
the team's collective mind.
Much like the Wildcats, the Sun
Devils lost their best player to the
NBA in Ike Diogu. Diogu almost
single-handedly led ASU to two
wins over the Cardinal last season,
combining for 67 points and 26 re
bounds in the pair of victories.
Without Diogu, the Sun Devils
have struggled. Two weeks ago, they
were swept by the Los Angeles
schools but dropped each game by
just one point. ASU finally picked
up its first conference win last
weekend, taking care of Oregon
State in overtime.
Offensively, the Sun Devils have
relied on the scoring of two guards,
Kevin Kruger and Bryson Krueger,
who have averaged 14.3 and 13
points respectively.
While the Wildcats may be the
primary threat, if the Cardinal
aren't careful they could be looking
at a third straight loss at the hands
of the Sun Devils.
Few teams have matched the recent suc
cess that Stanford men's basketball has en
joyed at the McKale Center, home of the
Arizona Wildcats. The Cardinal have won
four of the last five meetings in TUcson and

five of the last
seven overall.
Tomorrow,
Stanford (7-6,
3-2 Pacific 10
Conference)
looks to main
tain that suc
cess and pick
up its first
road victory in
a matchup of
two preseason
Pac-10 fa
vorites who
have failed to
live up to ex
pectations.
The Wild
cats, who
were picked
to finish first
in the confer
ence in the
preseason
media poll,
have stum
bled to a 10-6
record and
are coming
off consecu

tive losses to the Oregon schools. The Wild
cats haven't started 10-6 since the 1986-87
season and their 3-3 Pac-10 record is their
worst since 1984-85.
But despite those struggles, Stanford head
coach Trent Johnson and his Cardinal squad
are not taking the Wildcats lightly.
"They look pretty strong to me," Johnson
said. "Everybody, not me included, wants to
say, 'They don't shoot it from the perimeter
well.' Why do you have to shoot it on the out
side if you can get to the rim so well? Defen
sively, this team is really talented and really
good. They can really cause problems. Can
