# The
						right scent: is it Fresh or Glacial?
## 
### 
Ileft New York last week weighed down by
clothes, trinkets from foreign lands and my
oversized ego. So packed to the gills were my
bags that 1 was forced to leave behind certain
yardsticks of civilization, like a razor, my camera
charger and. most importantly, my soap. I let my
peach fuzz grow out and let my batteries dwin
dle, but 1 resolved this weekend that I ought to
acquire a cleaning agent, if only to fill my bath
room cubby.
ITie story of soap in my life has been a
complicated one. As a child. I was regarded as
fairly precocious in academics and social
graces. But hygiene eluded me. 1 sometimes
"faked" showers, turning on the faucet,
splashing water on my hair and the walls, and
walking out triumphantly in a towel. I picked
at my nails not out of nervousness but for lack
of a nail clipper. And I am fairly certain that a
toothbrush did not enter my mouth for most
of 1994. In the fourth grade. I was convinced
that playing in the sun had given me a nice tan
on my forearms, until closer inspection with a
washcloth revealed a layer of brown grime.
(By the way. for those of you keeping score at
home, the toothbrush comment was "hyper
bole." The rest is true.)
I eventually learned the ropes and now
practice what 1 consider to be pretty fair hy
giene. But it is with this backstory that I entered
Walgreen's to find soap. 1 have been using Old
Spice liquid soap for the past few years, but like
any great product, it continues to branch out
into new variations. Having been gone in the
fall. I wasn't prepared for the galaxy of choices
Proctor & Gamble had unleashed on the
American consumer. As I slinked into the store
and dragged my filthy self down the aisles, I was

confronted by not two, not three, but eight dif
ferent liquid soaps from Old Spice. There were
Fresh, Pure Sport. Mountain Rush, Pacific
Surge and Arctic Force. In addition, some new
offshoot. Red Zone, offered three even more
exotic options in the forms of After Hours,
Glacial Falls, Aqua Reef.
I low, I wondered, was 1 supposed to pick
just one of these delightful scents? First, I asked
myself what exactly I was looking for. Was it a
smell that I wanted to emanate or a certain per
sonal characteristic I was trying to get across?
If my goal was the former. After Hours
seemed the ideal choice. In the end, I'm not
cleaning up for my roommate or probation
officer, I'm getting sudsy in the hopes of im
pressing a lady. After Hours also has an adult
ring to it. Like I just logged 14 hours at the of
fice, and I'm off to a steak joint and maybe a
gentleman's club. And unlike Mountain Rush
or Pacific Surge, which imply a drive for a,
shall we say, premature conclusion, After
Hours seems to want to make this last fora
while. But the new brand. Red Zone, cannot
be dissociated in my mind from Stanford's
football fan club and the related failure of its
players to come up big in the clutch.
Beyond the outward persona 1 wish to proj

ect, which one captured my real essence? In
this regard. After Hours comes up short, be
cause many of my talents are best exhibited
during normal, daytime hours, so a soap that
limits me identity to the nighttime does not do
me justice. Pure Sport was a tempting choice, as
1 consider myself fairly sporty. But the word
"pure," suggesting that 1 am purely sports-ori
ented, cautioned me from that choice, because,
again, I consider myself to be something of a
Renaissance Man. Most of the other choices
faltered because, while I enjoy nature, I can't
say I identify singularly with any one locale, like
the mountains, the ocean or a barrier reef. 1 do
consider myself a risk taker though, and 1 be
lieve that attitude pervades most of my life.
Glacial Falls, then, appealed to that sensibility,
as 1 imagined hurling myself off a giant water
fall like 19th century daredevil Sam Patch.
Then a thought came to me. What if I could
combine these two goals and pick a soap that
would give me a great smell and also say some
thing about my character. Fresh fit those crite
ria. A clean, crisp, fresh smell is the best way to
start a day. Moreover, I consider my personali
ty to be cheeky and fun and my interactions
with friends and colleagues to be witty and
fresh.
Still, though. 1 couldn't bring myself to com
mit to one scent, and I left the store empty
handed. Lucky for me, my dorm mates have
stocked their cubbies with a wide selection of
Old Spice liquid soaps, allowing me to choose
the one that best suits my mood. Which, in the
end, just makes me an asshole.

Tell David which scent you are, or offer him a
sniff at dherbert@stanford.edu.
