Remembering the Other Dr. King
It would have been nice ifThe Daily had
paid attention toTenisha Armstrong when it
quoted her in its article on King ("King Cel
ebrated," Jan. 17):"Each year Martin Luther
King Jr. is reduced to the I Have a Dream'
sound bite." Sadly, this is pretty much exact
ly what The Daily did.
In a March 1%7 speech, "Beyond Viet
nam: A Tune to Break Silence," King de
clared:
"These are revolutionary times. All over
the globe men are revolting against old sys
tems of exploitation and oppression and out
of the wombs of a frail world new systems of
justice and equality are being born. The shirt
less and barefoot people of the land are ris
ing up as never before. 'The people who sat
in darkness have seen a great light.' We in the
West must support these revolutions. It is a
sad fact that.because of comfort.complacen
cy, a morbid fear of communism, and our
proneness to adjust to injustice, the Western
nations that initiated so much of the revolu

tionary spirit of the modern world have now
become the arch anti-revolutionaries."
Iliis is the King who battled against not
only racism, but also poverty and war.This is
the King who demanded a "unilateral cease
fire" in Vietnam and a strict timetable for
the return of American troops, and who in
sisted that the rich nations of the world had
an obligation to launch an "all-out war on
poverty." And this is the King who insisted
upon "radical changes in the structure of our
society" to redistribute wealth and power.
King's work did not finish with the Vot
ing Rights of Act of 1965. He was murdered
in I%N as he tried to organize sanitation
workers in Memphis and prepare fora
"Poor People's Campaign" to force the cre
ation of a "poor people's bill of rights." We
do King no favors by ignoring his more con
troversial positions and making him into a
two-dimensional idol."I have a Dream" was
the beginning, not the end.
