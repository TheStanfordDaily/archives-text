# Can anyone remember the last time Arizona has lost three in a row?
## MEN'S BASKETBALL Dan Grunfeld: Destined for hardwood success Senior has the pedigree and discipline to succeed on the court thanks in part to father's influence 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
If senior guard Dan Grunfeld
needs any advice or inspiration before
battling Arizona and Arizona State
this weekend, he needs to look no fur
ther than to his own father.
Dans father, Ernie Grunfeld. is the
Washington Wizards' president of
basketball operations. Before taking
his current post, he served as the gen
eral manager of two other NBA
squads — the New York Knicks and
the Milwaukee Bucks.
But for Ernie, 51, basketball suc
cess has come not only in the front of
fice, but on the hardwood as well. He
averaged 22 points per game at Ten
nessee before spending nine seasons
in the NBA.
For Dan, being raised in a basket
ball household has left an indelible
mark.
"Just growing up around basket
ball has given me not only great expe
riences, but also a fond appreciation
for the game," said the younger Grun
feld. whose 6-foot-6,220 pound frame
is nearly identical to his father's. "All
the memories 1 have growing up are
going to practices, going to games,
hanging out with some of the players
who were my idols."
Ask Dan about those memories,
and his voice rises, his pace quickens,
he leans forward in his chair and a
smile breaks across his face.
He tells first of being a ball boy for
a Chicago Bulls squad that played
against one of his dad's teams. Back in

the 19905, all-time greats Michael Jor
dan and Scottie Pippen grabbed the
headlines and led Chicago to six NBA
Championships. On that particular
night, though, the player who would
make the biggest impression on Grun
feld was Stacey King, a 6-foot-11.230-
pound power forward.
"I was rebounding for the players,"
said Dan, who estimates he was nine at
the time. "It was a big deal for me, so
I'm running out there, probably inter
rupting their shooting to get balls.
Stacey King was playing one-on-one
with one of his teammates. He went to
the hoop and just ran me over. 1 got
knocked out — I remember people
were huddled around me. and 1 was in
the locker room. My dad just said
'What were you doing?' That was
funny."
Though he wouldn't get knocked
out again, Dan had a similarly trau
matic experience a few years later, in a
one-on-one contest against his fa
vorite player at the time — the
Knicks' Allan Houston.
"I remember I did a move where I
kind of dribbled backwards and made
a jump shot on him." the younger
Grunfeld said."Then. I tried it the next
time. He blocked it all the way to the
other end of the court."
Dan adds that his childhood expe
riences aren't just good for laughs.
Somewhere between getting knocked
out by King and getting swatted by
Houston. Grunfeld has picked up
valuable morsels of knowledge about
the game. Even today, those messages
stick.
"I think anytime you're around
something a lot, you kind of have an
instinct for it," Grunfeld said. "So, for
me, when I'm playing basketball. I
just feel like it's just something very
natural because it's just something
I've done and focused on my whole
life."

— TRENT JOHNSON, head coach

Indeed, as Cirunfeld tells one last
game story, one can't help but think
that his on-court play and passion
today were molded in a two-on-two
game against complete strangers a

dozen years ago. Naturally, Dan's
teammate — both for that game and
for the countless obstacles that have
come since — is his father.
"My dad kind of gave me a look,"

Dan said, recreating his last story. "1
made a backdoor cut. and he hit me
fora lay-up. 1 just knew what to do. I
think that's a product of being around
the game and doing something I love."
