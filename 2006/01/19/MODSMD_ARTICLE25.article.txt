## Pac-10 Conference Matchups "We're going to have to come out from the start and play hard." WOMEN'S BASKETBALL Card energized to face visiting Arizona teams GETTING THE BALL ROLLING

KRISTA RAPPAHAHN, senior guard

After losing back-to-back games
to end 2005, the Stanford women's
basketball team has started 2006
with five straight victories and a re
newed determination to get back to
Boston — the site of its last loss and
the Final Four.
"We got sick of losing" sopho
more guard Candice Wiggins said. "1
had never experienced back-to-back
losses before, and 1 think the leaders
of the team started to take ownership
of the team. We developed this ag
gressive mentality that maybe we
should have had at the beginning of
the year."
Not surprisingly, the win streak
has coincided with the maturation
of the young Cardinal (11-4,6-1 Pa
cific-10 Conference). Nowhere has
this been more apparent than in the
emergence of freshman point-guard
Rossalyn Gold-Onwude. With
Gold-Onwude running the offense,
Wiggins has been freed up to con
centrate more on scoring. Wiggins'
70 points in the last two contests —
including a career high 37 on Jan. 7
at Oregon — have turned a lot of
heads, including men's basketball
coach Trent Johnson, who joked
about taking her with the men's
team to Arizona.
"Candice is definitely capable of
running the one, but when she can
focus on scoring it's a 20-point differ
ence," Gold-Onwude said. "So if my
presence as the point guard helps the
team, then I have no problem with
that."
The newly energized Stanford
squad will face its toughest test of the
New Year when Arizona (6-11, 5-2)
and No. 15 Arizona State (14-3,5-2)
visit the farm this Thursday at 7 p.m.
and Saturday at 2 p.m., respectively.
"Both the upcoming games are
very important for us," junior center
Brooke Smith said. " Iliey are athlet
ic, physical teams that we need to be
prepared for."
Arizona State, the conference's
second best shooting team at 46.2
percent, is currently third in the con
ference and one game behind the
Cardinal thanks in large part to its
post play. The Sun Devils are an
chored down-low by two dominant
forwards, senior Kristin Kovesdy and
pre-season All-Pac-10 junior Emily
Westerberg. Kovesdy currently leads
the team with 13.2 points per game
and leads the Pac-10 by shooting
59.5 percent from the field.
"Arizona State is maybe the most
physical team we'll play," head coach
Tara VanDerveer said. "They have a
nine-player rotation, and they play at

Five-game win streak
on the line tonight

The new year has been good to
the Stanford women, who last lost

the Cardinal atop the Pacific-10
Conference rankings.

a torrid pace. In order to be success
ful, we need to take care of the ball
and defend inside. I'd like to see us
run and use our defense to create
more offense."
Helping take the defensive bur
den off Smith will be junior forward
Kristin Newlin. Newiin returned to
the line-up last weekend against Cal
ifornia for the first time since suffer
ing a stress reaction in her leg. She
will provide another post presence to
a team that grew in her absence.
"When she was gone, it was a
wake-up call to the rest of the team,
especially when it comes to rebound
ing," Gold-Onwude said. "Brooke
was scoring a lot beforehand, but
now she's pulling down a lot of
boards too."
"It really hasn't sunk in that she's
back," VanDerveer added. "She's so
tough inside. Now we can rest
Brooke more and play big if we need
to with both of them available."
The Cardinal will also try to beat
the Sun Devils with the three-point
shooting of senior guard Krista Rap
pahahn and Wiggins. Stanford has
heated up to 40 percent behind the
arc in the last five games.
"I'm going to have to take my
shots, and we need to be strong with
the ball," Rappahahn said. "We're
going to have to come out from the
start and just be aggressive back and
not let them feel that they can play
with us."
The Arizona Wildcats (6-11, 2-5)
will visit Maples for the first time
since the tragic death of their star
center Shawntice Polk. Polk would
have been a senior this season, but
she collapsed and died suddenly in
September due to a pulmonary

Cardinal sophomore guard Candice Wiggins raises her arms in a defensive effort in a recent game. Wiggins, who has scored 70 points in the past two con

the season in her honor.
Though the team struggled early,
posting a -3.8 scoring margin, the
second worst in the conference, Ari

If the Cardinal can get through

their young talent can go.
