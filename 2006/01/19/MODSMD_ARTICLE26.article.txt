The Cardinal's loss to Illinois
Sunday was the kind of defeat not
soon forgotten. With every wrestler
in Stanford's lineup losing,the Cardi
nal need a win in the worst way. Even
though those individual losses came
against a talented fourth-ranked Illi
nois team, the after-effects of such a
loss could have a drastic impact on
the confidence and morale of the
Stanford squad.
But the Cardinal grapplers now
find themselves with no time for
looking back, as ihey plunge into
their conference schedule this

weekend.
On Friday. Stanford (3-3) is set to
take on CSU Bakerslield (1-3, 1-1
Pacific 10 Conference) to open their
Pac-10 schedule. And on Monday,
the Cardinal face CSU Fullerton (1-
9. 0-5) for their second conference
dual meet of the season. Both match
es will be at home for the Cardinal,
and are scheduled for 7 p.m. in Burn
ham Pavilion.
With the two conference matches
quickly approaching, it would be
comforting if Stanford had achieved
more success in its match against the
lllini. But head coach Kerry McCoy
deflated some of the importance of
the staggering defeat when he spoke

about the upcoming matches.
"Obviously the match [against
Illinois] — and every match —
counts." McCoy said. "But it's a dif
ferent situation. That was a non-con
ference dual.This is one where we?re
going to see these guys a couple of
times this year. Illinois, we won?t see
again until the national tournament."
As for the mental effects of the
39-0 drubbing, McCoy stressed that
his team would have to put the past
behind them to prepare for future
success.
"We dealt with the issues involved
with the match and now it's behind
us," McCoy said. "We can't dwell on
it any more. We can't worry about the
past; we have to move forward and
just continue to get better."
At IS4 pounds, senior Ryan
Hagen knows that some adjustments
need to be made for the Cardinal to
turn the team around.
"I think we need to be a lot quick

er." Hagen. a team captain, said.
"They definitely came out a lot
quicker. ITiey were a lot bouncier on
their feet. We need to be a little bit
more aggressive and attack more."
Whether or not an increased at
tack mentality would help the Cardi
nal. the familiarity of wrestling Pac
-10 rivals should provide added moti
vation fora team looking to find its
stride.
"You want to use that past experi
ence." McCoy said. 'Not to rely on it
exactly, but use it as motivation to do
better the next time out. 1 know Bak
ersfield has a history with Stanford
so we want to make sure to establish
ourselves as a team to beat."
But with Stanford starting such a
young lineup (only two of nine
wrestlers who faced Illinois were up
perclassmen). there may not be
much familiarity for the Cardinal to
