# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Card look to rebound from latest skid against UCSD and LBSU After five straight losses, the Stanford men look to score their first conference win 
### JOE KAY 
The Cardinal men's volleyball
team looks to bounce back from a
five-game "skid this weekend, but
the feat may be a tough one, as the
men take on UC-San Diego and
Long Beach State. UCSD visits
Stanford on Thursday in Burnham
Pavilion, while the No. 1 ranked
49ers play Stanford in Maples
Pavilion on Friday.
Chris Ahlfeldt, a senior middle
blocker for the Cardinal (1-5, 0-2
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion), sees his team improving, even
if the record doesn't show it.
"It's definitely frustrating to have
a losing record right now, but I think
we are getting better," Ahlfeldt said.
Ahlfeldt professed optimism for
future games, saying that if his team
keeps up the same positive attitude
and continues to improve at the same
rate, the wins will start to fall into
place.
For now, though, Stanford has to
focus its attention on UCSD (0-3,0-
1), the only Division 2 team in the
MPSF. The Tritons don't offer schol
arships, so they cannot sign some of
the best players in the MPSF, but
they never give in.
"(UCSD is) always pretty consis
tent," Ahlfeldt said. "We're expect
ing a decent team."
Head coach Don Shaw agrees
with Alhfeldt.
"San Diego is a team that is al
ways very scrappy, they are always
clawing for every win they can get."
he said.
When asked about San Diego's
inability to recruit the same quality
of players as many of the other West
Coast teams, Shaw immediately said
that the Tritons certainly don't play
like they are at a disadvantage.
UCSD's new head coach Kevin
Ring spent the past nine years as an
assistant coach for UCSD, his alma
mater.
Long Beach State (5-0,1-0) is cur
rently the top team in the nation and
has plenty of weapons to showcase
its talents.
Tyler Hildebrand was an all-

American last season as a junior and
was recently named the Most Valu
able Player at the UC-Santa Barbara
Elephant Bar College Invitational.
Shaw said that last season, Stan
ford's Kevin Hansen shared top hon
ors with Hildebrand as the best setter
in the country. Now, Hildebrand
stands alone. Shaw added that Hilde
brand possesses the ability to distrib
ute the sets to nearly any player no
matter where the pass is.
LBSU's top outside hitter, senior
Robert Tarr, was a first team All
American as a junior. He has a total
of 1,050 kills over his career and
stands at No. 14 of the all-time lead
ers in kills at his university.
Last year against the Cardinal,
Tarr amassed 36 kills in one game, his
career high. To stop that from hap
pening again, Stanford's block needs

to be consistent. Ben Reddy, Stan
ford's senior opposite hitter, Jeremy
Jacobs, a senior setter, and Alhfeldt
and sophomore Matt Ceran, the
starting middle blockers, will have to
focus on closing each block to con
tain Tarr.
Long Beach's middle blockers
pose a threat as well. Duncan
Budinger is the top hitter on the
team percentage wise at .475. Teddy
Liles leads the team in total blocks
with 32 in a young season.
The entire Stanford team remains
encouraged, despite the skid of five
straight losses.
"Each match we play, we want to
play it better than the last time out,"
Shaw said. "We've got to cut down on
our errors and give ourselves oppor
tunities to score points and eventual
ly win games."
