## A
						green light for grad student GO Passes? Caltrain passes for grad students to be extended 
### FRANCOIS JEAN-BAPTISTE STAFF WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) had a busy meeting last night,
discussing important developments
on the Caltrain passes, winter quar
ter programming — including week
ly graduate student pub events — as
well as approving student group
funding requests.
The transportation committee,
charged with extending the GO
Pass program, which subsidizes
Caltrain rides for graduate stu
dents who live off campus, made
major headway this week. Accord
ing to Councilmember Hannah
Scherer, a fifth-year earth sciences
doctoral student. University
Provost John Etchemendv has
agreed to fund the GO Passes
through 2006, provided interested
students are willing to pay part of
the cost. The GSC will also subsi
dize part of the cost.
As another contingency for the
Provost to provide funding for this
year's passes, student advocates
must promote the program as much
as possible and the GO Pass must be

placed on the special fees ballot for
future use beyond 2006, Scherer
said.
"Hannah and the transportation
committee have done a lot of work in
a short amount of time," said GSC
Co-chair Tom Lee, a fourth-year
electrical engineering graduate stu
dent. "They've been working on this
program largely in the last two
months, and they've done a lot of
work to get to this point: hats off to
them."
Another stated goal of the GSC
is to get as many students as possible
to purchase the GO Passes, Lee
said. At the same time, council mem
bers understand that price is an
issue.
"We want the GO Passes to be
economical for occasional users,"
Lee said. "The passes will be priced,
so they will be economical for the oc
casional users."
Lee also hinted about future ex
pansions to the GO Pass program
beyond the current calendar year.
"This year, the program is for off
campus graduate students only," he
said. "However, with special fees, we
would try to provide some free Cal

train rides for graduate students who
live on campus."
Details will be released soon
about how eligible graduate students
can purchase their subsidized Cal
train passes for 2006, Lee said. Inter
ested students should sign up on the
graduate commute e-mail list,"grad
commute." As soon as the discount
ed passes are available, the GSC will
let students know.
In addition, the council ap
proved funds for upcoming 750 Pub
events. The programs, which will
eventually be held on a weekly
basis, will be located at the Pub on
the first floor of the Graduate Com
munity Center.
Also, the GSC approved by con
sensus funds for two student groups,
the Korean Students Association
and the Pakistanis at Stanford.
The Korean Students Association

will be celebrating the Lunar New
Year Party on Friday, Jan. 27, coincid
ing with the Chinese New Year. The
Association is inviting all Korean
students as well as the greater Stan
ford community. Event organizers
said they expect between 350 and
400 students.
The Pakistanis at Stanford stu
dent group will hold a comedy event
Sunday, Jan. 22. Event organizers
have invited a famous comedian to
speak that night, and they expect be
tween 150 and 300 students.
The GSC is also looking fora new
Humanities Representative to the
council. The previous representative
David Lummus, a doctoral student in
Italian, had to resign due to teaching
responsibilities. People who are in
terested in this position should con
tact Tom Lee at gsc-chair@assu.stan
ford.edu.
