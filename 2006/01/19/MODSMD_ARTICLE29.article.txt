# Ricketts races to Reaganesque victory
## 
### SCOOP SCOOPERSTEIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"Let s win one for the Gipper,"
cried senior Camille Ricketts, cur
rent Daily Editor-in-Chief and the
only second-term candidate for the
position in recent memory, at last
night's election rally.
Ricketts, who won yesterday's
Volume 229 Editor-in-Chief vote in
an electoral landslide similar in
proportion to that of Reagan in his
1984 bid for the presidency against
the ill-fated Walter Mondale, could
not resist interrupting the roar of
the crowd to offer joyous yelps of
glee.
When the results were an
nounced, it turned out that Green
Party candidate Jules R. Penguin
only managed to bring in one vote
out of the 36 cast.
"I demand an immediate re
count," Penguin said. "Thereis ab
solutely no way I only got one vote
because I know 1 voted for myself at
least twice."
However, as of last night The
Daily's Election Commission re
fused to pursue Penguin's griev
ance, filed shortly after the elec
tion outcome was announced, with
the body's spokesperson explain
ing, "We'd follow up on it if we
could - but Tivo's down, and The

Daily Show is on."
Junior David Herbert, who did
not make any campaigning efforts
in the slightest, was the only indi
vidual to receive a write-in vote.
"I was completely excited about
that vote at first,"' Herbert said.
"But at the same time, I realized it is
kind of embarrassing because it
makes it look like 1 cast it. And I
didn't. Not that I'd admit it if I did,
of course. But really, I didn't."
One of the primary issues that
Penguin campaigned upon was the
goal of making The Daily's opera
tions more environmentally con
scious.
f'Here we are, printing 10,000
copies a day of a newspaper that is
some 16 pages long, just so some
jackass can read the Bunnies in be
tween class," Penguin said. "That's
not right. That's not justice."
However, it appears that Rick
etts plans to cast the large share of
votes she received as a mandate for
her ambitious policy agenda, which
has been criticized by some as being
too "pro-business."
"Remember, trees cause more
pollution than automobiles," Rick
etts said."So screw them. And we're
all riding our bikes to work, so I'd
say we're doing pretty damn good
for ourselves. Pretty damn good in
deed."
