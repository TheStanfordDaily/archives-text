# Eight reasons why Cardinal men's basketball will save its season
## 
### 
1 admit it. I jumped on the Cardinal basket
hall team's preseason bandwagon. You can
laugh at me and mock me all you want.
Yes, I enthusiastically gushed about the
Cardinal's ability and predicted them to reach
the Sweet 16 and win the Pacific-10 Confer
ence. Thanks to losses to UC-Davis, Montana
and UC-Irvine,the men's basketball team has
made me look like a fool.
However.the Cardinal's play in the last few
weeks has shown that they could potentially
restore my lost credibility. Well, some of it. I'm
not expecting a Sweet 16 appearance; heck, an
NCAA appearance seems a dream right now.
But let's recap. Aside from those devastat

swagger.
Thanks to a wide-open Pac-10, Stanford is
currently locked in a four-way tie for second
place. But I'll proclaim now that I think the
Cardinal have a chance, at least, of closing the
season out on a run hotter than Jessica Alba.
Well, maybe not that hot. Still, I've got eight
reasons why this season can be salvaged.
First, the team is looking like a more cohe

out their roles. Before this season, there were
two proven returning players, Chris Hernan
dez and Matt Haryasz.
The team is starting to pass better and de
fend better. With two regulars gone from last
season's roster, the players now seem to be
getting coach Trent Johnson's message. It's
like Hickory High in Hoosiers right before
Jimmy Chitwood joins the team. They're get
ting it and it's gonna lead to some great bas
ketball.
Second, the proven guys, Hernandez and
Haryasz. are stepping it up.
Haryasz has been consistent all year but re
ally turned it on against Cal after facing sur
prising criticism from Johnson. Hernandez, the
