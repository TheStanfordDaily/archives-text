# Eight reasons why Cardinal men's basketball will save its season
## 
### 
1 admit it. I jumped on the Cardinal basket
hall team's preseason bandwagon. You can
laugh at me and mock me all you want.
Yes, I enthusiastically gushed about the
Cardinal's ability and predicted them to reach
the Sweet 16 and win the Pacific-10 Confer
ence. Thanks to losses to UC-Davis, Montana
and UC-Irvine,the men's basketball team has
made me look like a fool.
However.the Cardinal's play in the last few
weeks has shown that they could potentially
restore my lost credibility. Well, some of it. I'm
not expecting a Sweet 16 appearance; heck, an
NCAA appearance seems a dream right now.
But let's recap. Aside from those devastat
ing early season losses, the team has faced the
brunt of the "curse of the bouncy floor," exe
cuted poorly and played with little or no
swagger.
Thanks to a wide-open Pac-10, Stanford is
currently locked in a four-way tie for second
place. But I'll proclaim now that I think the
Cardinal have a chance, at least, of closing the
season out on a run hotter than Jessica Alba.
Well, maybe not that hot. Still, I've got eight
reasons why this season can be salvaged.
First, the team is looking like a more cohe
sive unit.

I attribute this to players starting to figure
out their roles. Before this season, there were
two proven returning players, Chris Hernan
dez and Matt Haryasz.
The team is starting to pass better and de
fend better. With two regulars gone from last
season's roster, the players now seem to be
getting coach Trent Johnson's message. It's
like Hickory High in Hoosiers right before
Jimmy Chitwood joins the team. They're get
ting it and it's gonna lead to some great bas
ketball.
Second, the proven guys, Hernandez and
Haryasz. are stepping it up.
Haryasz has been consistent all year but re
ally turned it on against Cal after facing sur
prising criticism from Johnson. Hernandez, the

Stanford equivalent of Jack Bauer,
carried the team to a win against
Oregon State and had his best game
of the season Saturday, scoring 18
points on only six shots against Cal.
If the Cardinal are to advance,
these two will need to keep bringing
it.
I"hird, the team has upside.
Dan Grunfeld can (and I really
hope he will) get better after recov
ering from knee surgery. You also
have to hope that Hernandez and
Haryasz recover from their injuries
as well. Same is true of Peter Prowitt.
Ihen you must consider the re
cent performances. Prowitt getting
12 against Oregon State; Tim Morris
playing possessed against Oregon;
Mitch Johnson hitting key shots
against Cal.Taj Finger and Lawrence
Hill playing great defense against
Cal's Leon Powe. The team has six
freshmen and sophomores all play
ing big roles on the team. They're
only going to get better.
Four, the freshmen factor.
I give them their own point be
cause you see their hunger. Insert
cliche about how they are gamers,
champs, playing older than their age,
etc.
Easily the best freshman class in
my four years here, the rookies have
already made major contributions to
the team. Lawrence Hill looks Josh
Childress-like with his all around
play. Mitch Johnson is becoming
more confident with his semi-awk
ward shot and is cutting down on
turnovers. Anthony Goods, while not
receiving much playing time yet.
could be the secret weapon the Cardi

nal need to stretch defenses.
ITiese three soothe my doubt
about the Cardinal's future, but it's
their contributions in the present
that will determine if Stanford can
dance this year.
Fifth, the deja vu factor.
This year looks a lot like the last.
The Cardinal struggle in the presea
son. They lose their early Pac-1()
games. Then they go on a winning
streak (last year it was six games).
With a wide open — and I empha
size wide open — Pac-1(), it's possi
ble for the team to replicate last sea
son's Pac-1() success. Arizona is
weaker than last year, and the same
goes for Washington. At this point,
UCLA looks like the biggest threat
to the Cardinal.
This could be the mark of TYent
Johnson, whose teams thus far have
struggled out of the gate but then
picked it up. I really hope this deja vu
factor doesn't persist next year be
cause I'd like to think we have the
right captain for the ship. We'll see if
he can get the team to the tourna
ment after a dreadful start.
I hope he does, for his credibility
and for mine.

Fifth, the deja vu factor.
This year looks a lot like the last.
The Cardinal struggle in the presea
son. They lose their early Pac-1()
games. Then they go on a winning
streak (last year it was six games).
With a wide open — and I empha
size wide open — Pac-1(), it's possi
ble for the team to replicate last sea
son's Pac-1() success. Arizona is
weaker than last year, and the same
goes for Washington. At this point,
UCLA looks like the biggest threat
to the Cardinal.
This could be the mark of TYent
Johnson, whose teams thus far have
struggled out of the gate but then
picked it up. I really hope this deja vu
factor doesn't persist next year be
cause I'd like to think we have the
right captain for the ship. We'll see if
he can get the team to the tourna
ment after a dreadful start.
I hope he does, for his credibility
and for mine.

1 admit it. I jumped on the Cardinal basket
hall team's preseason bandwagon. You can
laugh at me and mock me all you want.
Yes, I enthusiastically gushed about the
Cardinal's ability and predicted them to reach
the Sweet 16 and win the Pacific-10 Confer
ence. Thanks to losses to UC-Davis, Montana
and UC-Irvine,the men's basketball team has
made me look like a fool.
However.the Cardinal's play in the last few
weeks has shown that they could potentially
restore my lost credibility. Well, some of it. I'm
not expecting a Sweet 16 appearance; heck, an
NCAA appearance seems a dream right now.
But let's recap. Aside from those devastat
ing early season losses, the team has faced the
brunt of the "curse of the bouncy floor," exe
cuted poorly and played with little or no
swagger.
Thanks to a wide-open Pac-10, Stanford is
currently locked in a four-way tie for second
place. But I'll proclaim now that I think the
Cardinal have a chance, at least, of closing the
season out on a run hotter than Jessica Alba.
Well, maybe not that hot. Still, I've got eight
reasons why this season can be salvaged.
First, the team is looking like a more cohe
sive unit.

I attribute this to players starting to figure
out their roles. Before this season, there were
two proven returning players, Chris Hernan
dez and Matt Haryasz.
The team is starting to pass better and de
fend better. With two regulars gone from last
season's roster, the players now seem to be
getting coach Trent Johnson's message. It's
like Hickory High in Hoosiers right before
Jimmy Chitwood joins the team. They're get
ting it and it's gonna lead to some great bas
ketball.
Second, the proven guys, Hernandez and
Haryasz. are stepping it up.
Haryasz has been consistent all year but re
ally turned it on against Cal after facing sur
prising criticism from Johnson. Hernandez, the

Stanford equivalent of Jack Bauer,
carried the team to a win against
Oregon State and had his best game
of the season Saturday, scoring 18
points on only six shots against Cal.
If the Cardinal are to advance,
these two will need to keep bringing
it.
I"hird, the team has upside.
Dan Grunfeld can (and I really
hope he will) get better after recov
ering from knee surgery. You also
have to hope that Hernandez and
Haryasz recover from their injuries
as well. Same is true of Peter Prowitt.
Ihen you must consider the re
cent performances. Prowitt getting
12 against Oregon State; Tim Morris
playing possessed against Oregon;
Mitch Johnson hitting key shots
against Cal.Taj Finger and Lawrence
Hill playing great defense against
Cal's Leon Powe. The team has six
freshmen and sophomores all play
ing big roles on the team. They're
only going to get better.
Four, the freshmen factor.
I give them their own point be
cause you see their hunger. Insert
cliche about how they are gamers,
champs, playing older than their age,
etc.
Easily the best freshman class in
my four years here, the rookies have
already made major contributions to
the team. Lawrence Hill looks Josh
Childress-like with his all around
play. Mitch Johnson is becoming
more confident with his semi-awk
ward shot and is cutting down on
turnovers. Anthony Goods, while not
receiving much playing time yet.
could be the secret weapon the Cardi

nal need to stretch defenses.
ITiese three soothe my doubt
about the Cardinal's future, but it's
their contributions in the present
that will determine if Stanford can
dance this year.
Fifth, the deja vu factor.
