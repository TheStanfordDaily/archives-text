## Study cites new gene linking nerve cells Researchers hope to re grow spinal tissue 
### MELISSA FUSCO STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Medical School re
searchers have discovered a key
gene that controls the development
of connections between the brain
and the spinal cord. Scientists hope
to combine the discovery with fur
ther stem-cell research, with the goal
of one day giving doctors the power
to re-grow spinal cord tissue in in
jured patients.
Biology Prof. Susan McConnell
co-authored the report with re
search associate Bin Chen and
graduate student Laura Schaevitz.
Their findings were first published
in the November 2005 issue of Pro
ceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences (PNAS), and their
work was presented at the annual
conference of the American Col
lege of Neuropsychopharmacolo
gy in December. The study was
funded by the National Institutes
of Health.
The gene, called Fezl, is a DNA
binding protein that controls the de
velopment and placement of nerve
cells in the body. Researchers isolat
ed it after studying the fetal develop
ment of mice, whose nervous sys
tems are similar to human nervous
systems. Their hypotheses about
Fezl's role in brain and spinal cord
development were confirmed when
genetically altered mice, whose Fezl
gene had been "knocked out." failed
to develop proper brain-spinal cord
connections.
"Normally, Fezl is required for
certain brain cells to grow along the
pathway that leads into the spinal
cord," said McConnell in an inter
view with the Stanford News Ser
vice. "In the mice lacking the gene
for Fezl, this pattern of corticospinal
tract development was not ob
served."
The implications of the study
have excited many in the field.
"The discovery of Fezl is a criti

cal finding in unlocking the intrica
cies of human brain development
and could have important implica
tions in the future treatment of
spinal cord injuries," McConnell
said. "Fezl is another critical step in
piecing together a complete picture
of brain and spinal cord develop
ment."
While applications to medical
treatment have yet to be developed,
there is hope that isolating the genes
that connect the brain and spinal
cord will lead to treatment for relat
ed injuries, which are particularly se
vere due to the difficulty the body
has in regenerating severed nerve
connections called axons. Axon
trauma often results in paralysis.
Now that Fezl has been isolated.
Chen explained, two major ques
tions remain.
"If we find a way to force Fezl's
expression in the cerebral cortex, we
may be able to make these neurons
send axons to the spinal cord," she
said."Second, we want to know what
genes are being regulated by Fezl.
The goal is to dissect out the whole
Fezl genetic pathway."
The Stanford team's discovery
has fueled enthusiasm and specula
tion over possible future applica
tions to stem cell therapies. Doctors
and researchers may one day be able
to use their knowledge of Fezl's role
in fetal spine-brain development to
stimulate the re-growth of connec
tions that have been damaged in
adult patients. Stem-cell therapies, in
particular, rely on knowledge of na
ture's cues to undifferentiated cells,
which cause them to develop in spe
cialized ways.
As both McConnell and Chen
noted, however, much remains to be
investigated.
"People have been talking about
using stem cell therapy to replace
diseased neurons in neurodegenera
tive disease or spinal injury," Chen
explained. "By studying the Fezl ge
netic pathway and other similar
pathways, we may find a way to ma
nipulate the stem cells to make them
become the type of neurons needed
for therapeutic purposes."
