# Film series aims to revisit American perceptions of Muslims
## 
### MATTHEW BOYD 
With images of a gun-toting Osama Bin
Laden and Saddam Hussein's trial for crimes
against humanity dominating the media, it is
an unfortunate reality that, to many Ameri
cans, these men have effectively become the
ambassadors between the Muslim world and
the US. citizenry.
Fora man like David Giovacchini. cur
rent perceptions of Muslims are nothing
short of disturbing. With degrees in Middle
Eastern Studies and Arabic from Cornell
and Princeton Universities and having
worked a stint as the Arabic Librarian at
Harvard University. Giovacchini has
demonstrated an understanding of the rich
ness and true nature of Muslim and Arab cul
ture. Also the curator of the Middle East Col
lection at Green Library, Giovacchini is one
of the main backers behind the second Mid
dle Eastern Film Series, which began yester
day at the Bechtel International Center.
"We have always felt that since the tragic

events of Sept. 11. and then the Iraq War.
Muslims have been demonized in the Amer
ican media." Giovacchini said. "We wanted
to give the people of the Stanford communi
ty a chance to see how Muslims portrayed
themselves and tell the stories of their every
day lives."
Combating the disproportionate amount
of influence that images of men
like Osama Bin Laden have over the prevail
ing idea of Muslims in American
socicty is the most important goal of the se
ries, he said.
"I have long been an exponent of the idea
that once you watch someone's
story on film, walk a mile in his or her shoes
so to speak, you are less likely to hate that
person or be willing to kill them." Giovacchi
ni explained, indeed you will be more
aware of the similarities between their lives
and your own."
John Pearson, director of the Bechtel In
ternational Center shared Giovacchini's
opinion that the film series can open minds.

"Our goal, in most of our programs, is to
offer the opportunity to learn about differ
ent cultures," he said. "These film series are
open to everyone and we think that it is espe
cially important to do all we can to provide
such programs that help to show the rich and
varied culture of the Middle East."
Backers of the film series also aim to ad
vertise the comprehensive and growing col
lection of Middle Eastern films here at Stan
ford, which now ranks among one of the best
in the nation.
"Before me, we only acquired Middle
Eastern films which got a U.S.
Release — these were mainly Iranian films
such as those by Abbas Kiarostami or Muh
sen Makhmlabaf: now we acquire films di
rectly from the source
countries," Giovacchini said.
Over the course of the first Middle East
ern film scries at Stanford, Giovacchini and
others noticed that many on The Farm
demonstrated little knowledge or awareness
about Middle Eastern film.

"In order to build our audience, we tried
in our first series to only show films by well
known directors such as Youssef Chahine,
the classics so to speak," he said.
The effort to build an audience and in
crease awareness of Middle Eastern
culture and of the film collection here on
campus seems to be successful so far, sup
porters say.
"We are expecting a good number of peo
ple to attend [the series]," said Ramzi Salti,
lecturer in Arabic language and Literature.
"This observation is based on the fact that, in
Beginning Arabic classes at Stanford alone
this quarter, we have over 50 students —
many of whom are extremely interested in
cultural productions from the Middle East."
With a firm base of supporters, organizers
of the Middle Eastern Film series have
deemed it acceptable to vary the types of
movies that will be incorporated into the se
ries.
"Now we can branch out a bit, and show
more obscure stuff," Giovacchini said. "In

deed, we have shown an Egyptian musical
from 1954 and introduced film-goers to the
best kept secret in world cinema, TUrkish
films."
One of the major themes uniting the films
of the series, regardless of origin, has been
the attempts by Middle Eastern women to
delineate a new, equal and largely free place
for themselves in their societies, and of Mid
dle Eastern men to accept this new and more
involved and equal place.
"This is a theme which grips the Middle
Eastern film makers at this time, and it has
not taken much planning on our part to in
clude in many of the films shown at the se
ries," Giovacchini said.
While the predominant perceptions of
Muslims in U.S. society won't
change overnight, organizers hope that a film
series illuminating the true nature of Muslim
culture will be a good starting point.
Future screenings will occur every other
Wednesday thereafter at 7:30 p.m. at the
Bechtel International Center.
