# WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
## Hard work pays off for senior guard 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
10:15 a.m., four hours before game-time
and senior guard Krista Rappahahn was al
ready on the Maples Pavilion three-point
line. She was practicing her shot for Satur
day's match against California, hut Rappa
hahn's routine of attempting more than 100
three-pointers is nothing unusual for her —
she does it almost every day.
As a rising top-notch scorer for the No.
14 Stanford women's basketball team, Rap
pahahn averages around seven three-point
attempts in an actual game. The hundreds
she takes outside — the practice — pays
off: whether it was with six total three
pointers against Cal.five against UCLA or
one game-changing three against Oregon.
Rappahahn averages more than three
three-pointers per game and has a .456 per
centage, but what may be more amazing is
that she's still not satisfied
"I'm doing an okay job according to
me," Rappahahn said. "I'd like to shoot bet
ter than I am right now, and I think I can.
My goal is to shoot 50 percent or better
every game, and in the last two games I def
initely haven't been doing that. I've been
close, but I'm not there."
Many of Rappahahn's teammates at
tribute her success to this attitude. With a
strong work ethic and enthusiasm, Rappa
hahn has come to the forefront of the Car
dinal squad in her senior year, averaging
more than 25 minutes of playing time and
more than 10 points.
"I'm so proud of her," sophomore guard
Candice Wiggins said. "I think her story is

JOEL LEWENSTEIN/The Stanford Daily
Senior guard Krista Rappahahn once learned from the likes of former Cardinal
shooters Susan Borchardt and Kelley Suminski. Now, in her final season with the
Card, she has blossomed into one of Stanford's most dependable deep threats.
incredible: how someone can be
supportive for all these years and
now step up this year and be one of
our key players."
Rappahahn is humble about her
performance this season, but enjoys
the role she has obtained after
heavy shooters Susan Borchardt
and Kelley Suminski graduated and
left the Cardinal.
"It's really exciting to be out
there because my three years before
this I had tremendous players in
front of me," she said. "I give them
tons of credit for helping me devel
op into the player that 1 am, but
being out there this year is just in
credibly exciting for me."
Rather than working to get on
the court, Rappahahn now has to
work to stay on it . With numbers and
a shot like hers, head coach Tara
VanDerveer says she will bench
Rappahahn if she doesn't keep tak
ing her open shots.
"What I tell Krista is'keep shoot
ing or you're coming out,'" Van-
Derveer said.
Rappahahn's teammates have
also followed suit to give her as
many openings as possible. On the
court,it's all about getting the ball to
"Rapp," according to VanDerveer's
orders.

THIS SEASON
Women's Basketball
After a lackluster 5-3 start, the
Cardinal ladies have picked it up
to remain undefeated in 2006.
5 straight wins

outscored opponents
this season
21.1 points

dace Wiggins

"We all trust Rapp to knock
down shots," sophomore guard Can
dice Wiggins said. "When I'm in
transition, coming down the court, I
just think 'Rapp — find Rapp,' and

almost every time you find her, it's
an instant three."
Rappahahn specifically credits
Wiggins and junior center Brooke
Smith for getting her open, ball in
hand, hut the whole team has been
supportive in providing her with as
many opportunities as possible fora
shot from the outside.
"This has been her most produc
tive season by a huge margin," fresh
man guard Rosalyn Gold-Onwude
said. "She's stepping up. she's going
to make it worthwhile and we're
going to try to make it happen for
her."
For Rappahahn, though, there's
more to making a three than getting
the chance for it . What takes her just
a couple seconds on the court fol
lows hours of preparation, before,
during and after practice. Of course,
proper footwork, a high release and
strong follow-through are all impor
tant to Rappahahn's shot, but the
years of coaching and advice from
her mother have made practice, and
not technique, the most crucial.
"I think most of it is muscle mem
ory," Rappahahn said. "You take so
many shots in practice, and the shots
you take in a game are just a small
fraction of that which you take in
practice."

In addition, shooting for practice
and shooting for the win are differ
ent. so Rappahahn has to prepare
herself mentally for the heat of the
game and moment.
"You start playing mind games
and put all this pressure on yourself
[on the courtj," she said. "You think
I got a wide-open three. Am I going
to make this shot?' But really, the
most effective way is to just catch
and shoot. You've done it thousands
of times — just catch the ball and
shoot it."
Wiggins, who has also shown a
strong three-point shot (seven
against Cal), understands how cru
cial confidence is and how well Rap
pahahn is able to handle it.
"You just have to keep shooting
and keep being confident, and I
think Rapp does a really good job of
that, not getting discouraged and not
getting down," Wiggins said.
Rappahahn admits she does get
frustrated at times with any misses,
but when she does make a three,
which is often, she's happy to have
fulfilled her role and contributed to
the team.
"When I make a shot it's like.
'That's it. I did my job,'" Rappa
hahn said. "That's how it's sup
posed to be."
