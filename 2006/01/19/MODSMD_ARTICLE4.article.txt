## Hard work pays off for senior guard 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
10:15 a.m., four hours before game-time
and senior guard Krista Rappahahn was al
ready on the Maples Pavilion three-point
line. She was practicing her shot for Satur

dinal squad in her senior year, averaging
more than 25 minutes of playing time and
more than 10 points.
"I'm so proud of her," sophomore guard
Candice Wiggins said. "I think her story is

Senior guard Krista Rappahahn once learned from the likes of former Cardinal
shooters Susan Borchardt and Kelley Suminski. Now, in her final season with the
Card, she has blossomed into one of Stanford's most dependable deep threats.
