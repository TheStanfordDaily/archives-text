### TOM GARDNER ASSOCIATED PRESS 
MAMMOTH LAKES, Calif. (AP) —Former
FEMA Director Michael Brown on Wednesday
accepted a greater share of the blame for the gov
ernment's failures after Hurricane Katrina, saying
he fell short in conveying the magnitude of the dis
aster and calling for help.
"I should have asked for the military sooner. I
should have demanded the military sooner,"
Brown told a gathering of meteorologists at a ski
resort in the Sierra Nevada.
"It was beyond the capacity of the state and
local governments, and it was beyond the capacity
of FEMA," said Brown, former head of the Feder
al Emergency Management Agency.
Brown's remarks Wednesday stood in contrast
to his testimony at a congressional hearing in Sep
tember, when he blamed most of the government's
failures on Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco and
New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin) — both Democ
rats.
He specifically targeted them for failing to
evacuate New Orleans, restore order and improve
communication.
"These are not FEMA roles," Brown told the
congressional committee. "FEMA doesn't evacu
ate communities. FEMA does not do law enforce
ment. FEMA does not do communications."

In an interview after his speech Wednesday,
Brown told The Associated Press: "I think it's im
portant to realize that all of us made mistakes....
After a while you get a different perspective."
He added:"l still do believe that things weren't
working too well down there."
He also told the gathering of broadcast and Na
tional Weather Service meteorologists that he
failed to delegate responsibility, saying he tried to
attend to the details himself.
"It was the largest natural disaster ever to strike
the United States) — 92,(K)0 square miles. Logis
tics were falling apart," he said.
Before joining FEMA in 2001, Brown was an
attorney, held local government posts and headed
the International Arabian Horse Association.
President Bush appointed him to head the agency
in April 2003.

FEMA came under fire immediately after Kat
rina struck the Louisiana and Mississippi coast
lines Aug. 29, killing more than 1,300 in five states
and leaving some 3,200 unaccounted for.
He was relieved of his command in the stricken
region and recalled Sept. 9 to Washington. Brown
resigned three days later, saying he feared he had
become a distraction.
Asked on Wednesday if he felt he had been rail
roaded out of his post. Brown replied:" I'm moving
on."
He said his biggest concern was the current em
phasis on reorganizing FEMA,particularly in light
of past budget cuts that had left hundreds of va
cancies in an agency with 2,500 employees.
"It's time to stop organizing and get FEMA
back to what it was before) — get its budget back
up to where it was."
