PESHAWAR. Pakistan (AP) — Pakistani intelligence agents hunted
Wednesday for the graves of four al-Qaida militants believed killed in an
airstrike near the Afghan border — including at least one suspected high
ranking al-Qaida figure.
ABC News and The New York Times reported that Pakistani ofticials
believe a master bomb maker and chemical weapons expert for al-Qaida
was killed in the attack on the village of Damadola last week, 112 le was iden
tified as Midhat Mursi. also known as Abu Khabab al-Masri, who ran an
al-Qaida training camp and has a $5 million reward on his head.
Also killed. Pakistani officials believe, was Khalid Habib, the al-Qaida
operations chief for Pakistan and Afghanistan, ABC said.The Times, how
ever, said officials were uncertain about whether he was killed.
The Times also reported that Pakistani officials believe Moroccan Abd al-
Rahman al-Maghrebi, the son-in-law of al-Qaida No. 2 Ayman al-Zawahiri,
and the man who ran the group's propaganda in the region, was killed in the
strike. ABC described al-Maghrebi as a senior operations commander.
The newspaper said an Egyptian chief of insurgent operations in a re
gion near the airstrikes also was believed killed and an Egyptian associate
of al-Zawahiri's was possibly slain.
Pentagon officials said they had no information on the reported iden
tities of the dead and CIA spokesman Tom Crispell said the agency could
not comment. A Pakistani intelligence official, speaking on condition of
anonymity because he's not authorized to speak to journalists, said au
thorities still did not know the names of the dead foreign militants but sus
pect one was a ranking al-Qaida figure.
"We have no names. We know one of them had value in al-Qaida. He
had intelligence value in the network, but we are still checking his name,"
said the official.
Pakistani Interior Minister Aftab Sherpao told The Associated Press
the government does not know the identities of the foreigners believed
killed in the missile strike Friday, which officials have said targeted Osama
bin Laden's top aide, Ayman al-Zawahri.
"We are still investigating. There's a possibility that some foreigners
were there, but we still do not know," said Sherpao, who was in New York
with visiting Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz.
Sherpao said the government had not retrieved the bodies of any of the
four foreign militants reported killed in the raid. He said the bodies may
have been taken by a local pro-Taliban cleric, Maulana Faqir Mohammed,
who also is being hunted by authorities.
The U.S. government refuses to discuss the airstrike, which has been
condemned by Pakistan.
Provincial authorities say the attack killed 18 residents of the Pashtun
village, and they also say they believe sympathizers took the bodies of four
or five foreign militants to bury them in the mountains, thereby prevent
ing their identification.
