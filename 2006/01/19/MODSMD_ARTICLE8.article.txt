## CURRENT EVENTS Health care creates stir among labor Employers feel the pinch as costs skyrocket 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
Health care spending reached $ 1.9 trillion
in 2004, the U.S. government reported last
week. That number is 16 percent of the U.S.
Gross Domestic Product and four times the
amount spent on national defense. Although
45 million Americans are uninsured, the
United States spends more on health care
than other industrialized nations with univer
sal health insurance. Public funds account for
less than half of total spending in this area.
Health care is facing an impending crisis,
experts say. Total out-of-pocket spending on
health care reached $230 billion in 2003, the
Health Affairs Journal reported. And ac
cording to the California Health Care Foun
dation, the amount spent per person in
creased 69 percent between 1993 and 2003.
Employers are feeling the greatest pinch
as health care costs skyrocket. The annual
premium that a health insurer charges an
employer fora health plan covering a family
of four averaged $9,950 in 2004, the Kaiser
Family Foundation reported. The National
Coalition of Health Care expects health in
surance premiums to rise to an average of
more than $14,500 for family coverage in

2006. Kaiser said in a
recent report that
the premiums for
employer-based
health insurance
rose by 11.2 percent
in 2004.
"The cost of in
surance is increas
ing," said Law Prof.
William Gould, the
former chairman of
the National Labor
Relations Board

under President Bill Clinton. "This is leading
more employers to absorb these costs. This is
leading to more disputes and in some in
stances strikes."
In this context, it is no surprise that a cen
tral point of contention in negotiations for
both unionized Hospital and University
workers is the cost and quality of health care
coverage. The ongoing labor disputes at
Stanford have drawn attention to parallels
with a changing national climate for organ
ized labor. Last week,The Daily reported on
the impact of a changing economy and an in
creasingly unfriendly regulatory environ
ment. We now examine health care, an issue
that has been central to recent collective bar
gaining across the country.
