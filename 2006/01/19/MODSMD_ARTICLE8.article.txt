## CURRENT EVENTS Health care creates stir among labor Employers feel the pinch as costs skyrocket 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
Health care spending reached $ 1.9 trillion
in 2004, the U.S. government reported last
week. That number is 16 percent of the U.S.
Gross Domestic Product and four times the
amount spent on national defense. Although
45 million Americans are uninsured, the
United States spends more on health care
than other industrialized nations with univer
sal health insurance. Public funds account for
less than half of total spending in this area.
Health care is facing an impending crisis,
experts say. Total out-of-pocket spending on
health care reached $230 billion in 2003, the
Health Affairs Journal reported. And ac
cording to the California Health Care Foun
dation, the amount spent per person in
creased 69 percent between 1993 and 2003.
Employers are feeling the greatest pinch
as health care costs skyrocket. The annual
premium that a health insurer charges an
employer fora health plan covering a family
of four averaged $9,950 in 2004, the Kaiser
Family Foundation reported. The National
Coalition of Health Care expects health in
surance premiums to rise to an average of
more than $14,500 for family coverage in

2006. Kaiser said in a
recent report that
the premiums for
employer-based
health insurance
rose by 11.2 percent
in 2004.
"The cost of in
surance is increas
ing," said Law Prof.
William Gould, the
former chairman of
the National Labor
Relations Board

under President Bill Clinton. "This is leading
more employers to absorb these costs. This is
leading to more disputes and in some in
stances strikes."
In this context, it is no surprise that a cen
tral point of contention in negotiations for
both unionized Hospital and University
workers is the cost and quality of health care
coverage. The ongoing labor disputes at
Stanford have drawn attention to parallels
with a changing national climate for organ
ized labor. Last week,The Daily reported on
the impact of a changing economy and an in
creasingly unfriendly regulatory environ
ment. We now examine health care, an issue
that has been central to recent collective bar
gaining across the country.

Labor Lulls

reject the University's latest

Hospitals and workers stalled

At Stanford
Perhaps the most heated issue in
current labor negotiations is health
insurance coverage guarantees.
Both Hospital and University
workers are holding out fora plan
that would provide full coverage for
employees and their families at no
cost. Stanford Hospital, the union
said, is offering a salary and health in
surance proposal that would cost
workers money in 2006/1116 Univer
sity worker union said in a press re
lease last week that employees pay
several hundred dollars a year to
keep their families insured.
John Vellardita, chief spokesper
son for Service Employees Interna
tional Union Local 715 (SEIU), told
The Daily that health insurance is a
huge issue in the current negotiations.
"Any raise we negotiate in salary
goes straight out of pocket to pay for
health insurance," he said. "It's a na
tional issue for organized and non
organized labor."
Ilie University maintains that it is
a market leader and argues that the
current compensation package is
generous.
"Just like wages, benefits cost real
money and have to be understood as
part of total compensation," Execu
tive Director of Human Resources
Diane Peck wrote in an e-mail to fac
ulty and staff members last week.
"On average, for every $100 in wages
Stanford pays an employee,it pays an
additional $31 in benefits."
Peck said Stanford provides 1 (K)
percent of the health care premiums
of the lowest-cost plan for the em
ployee, or 82 percent of the premium
of the lowest-cost plan for the em
ployee and their family. The Univer
sity also offers 100 percent of the
dental premium in two different
plans. Stanford offers University
workers a retiree medical benefit
that Peck says only 25 percent of Cal
ifornia employers provide.
"Stanford University has a 'man
aged competition' model of health in
surance," explained Graduate School
of Business Prof. Alain Enthoven and
University Human Resources finance
manager Brian Talbott, in a 2(X)4 arti
cle in 1 lealth Affairs, a policy journal
of the health sphere.
"The continued double-digit

growth in the premiums of even the
lowest-price plans is a major burden
and cause for concern, creating pres
sure to look for less costly alterna
tives" they wrote. "It is clear that con
tinuation on the present path is unsus
tainable. Stanford's problem is that
even the low-price plan faces price-in
elastic demand because so many em
ployers pay much more on behalf of
more costly than less costly plans."
Stanford offers three kinds of
health insurance. Health Mainte
nance Organizations (HMOs) re
quire enrollees to choose a primary
physician who refers them to special
ists. Point-of-Service (POSs) plans
offer more flexibility to choose how
and where to receive health care. Pre
ferred Provider Organizations
(PPOs) open up more options for
where to receive health care but pro
vide extra incentives to stay within
the network of providers.
Rising premiums
The Kaiser Family Foundation re
ported that all types of health plans
— including HMOs, PPOs and POSs
— saw double-digit increases over
recent years.
The California Employer Health
Benefits survey found that among
employer-based insurance offerings,
PPOs have the most expensive insur
ance premiums, both statewide and
nationally.
The same survey found that Cali
fornia employees are contributing
more to their health insurance pre
miums than in the past. The employ
ee share of premiums increased from
23 to 27 percent from 2(XK) to 2004.
Premiums for employee-sponsored
health insurance in the United States
have been rising five times faster on av
erage than workers' earnings since
2(MK). Hewitt Associates concluded
that the employees' share of health in
surance costs has soared 58 percent for
family coverage since 2(X)1.
As a result, according to an
Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality study released last week,
fewer employers pay the entire
monthly bill. About 28 percent of em
ployees worked at businesses offer
ing health plans requiring no contri
butions in 2003. compared with 35
percent in 1998, Bloomberg News re
ported in their coverage of the study.
Large employers, like Stanford, ac
counted for the largest declines in
fully paid health plans.
Trying to pass on the costs
Observers say that Stanford's re

sistance to guaranteeing full coverage
for employees and their families is
consistent with an effort by employers
everywhere to share more of the costs
for health care with their workers.
Insurance coverage has played a
central role in several high profile ne
gotiations recently. The grocery
worker labor negotiations that
caused 70,000 workers to strike in
2003 and 2004 — crippling tradition
al supermarkets in California —
hinged on health benefits. Last Octo
ber, the United Auto Workers union
accepted 25 percent cuts in retiree
health benefits at struggling General
Motors. Observers said that union
leaders recognized that the car mak
ers could not avoid bankruptcy with
out some significant concessions.
Economics Prof. John Pencaval
said that employers try to increase
the burden to pay for health insur
ance on their employees because
costs are increasing so quickly.
"Health care costs are rising so
fast that the old formulas which in
volve sharing costs between workers
and employers are proving very bur
densome," he said. "Firms are trying
to change the formula so that they do
not have such an increase in costs."
Collective bargaining is crucial in
protecting the generous benefits that
many employers are trying to limit,
others say.
"The cost of health care goes
down significantly if it is a shared
cost," said Stanford alumnus and
University of Utah Economics Prof.
Peter Philips. "Collective bargaining
allows workers to purchase health
care cheaper. Employers don't want
to be the middle man."
"It's a matter of sharing risks and a
concern by employers that they will be
left holding the bag," he added."At the
same time, the workers are concerned
that they will have to pay for health
care on their own. When both employ
ers and workers negotiate, they end up
focusing on health care. Both sides feel
under deep pressure. Outside of the
burden of collective bargaining, em
ployers can flush health care programs
when they cost too much."
Universities and corporations
alike are trying to limit the growth of
their health care obligations.
"Health care costs have gone
through the roof," said George Wash
ington University Law Prof. Charles
Craver, who specializes in labor arbi
tration."Universities everywhere are
fighting for the workers to pay more
and more."
