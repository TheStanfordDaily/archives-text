## ASSU senate imposes cap on funding Smaller groups more likely to be affected by "soft cap" 
### KAITLIN WOOD 
The recently-imposed soft cap placed on stu
dent group funding by the ASSU Senate Appro
priations Committee has left many student groups
questioning how they will meet their needs. Some
are now scrambling to come up with new ways to
deal with the now finite general fee resources pro
vided by the ASSU.
The ASSU imposed a $40 limit on the funding
per Stanford undergraduate participating in a stu
dent group. This cap complements the already ex
istent hard cap of $6,000, the maximum total
amount of funding allocated to an undergraduate
student group per year.
But how exactly will the soft cap affect various
groups on campus?
"For the student groups which now have to face
the soft cap, it largely depends on their condition,"
said Senate Appropriations Chair Faris Ali Mohi
uddin.
For example, while there are several groups on
campus that spend large amounts of money put
ting on events, many of them have a high participa
tion rate, and the soft cap only affects them moder
ately, if at all. In essence, they can continue doing
what they were doing before.
However, there are many groups that had a sig
nificant amount of funding they expected to get,
before the soft cap was imposed, that now may not
qualify for the funds. The new restrictions now
force them to think longer and harder about the
events they hold throughout the year. Because the
soft cap is good throughout the duration of the
school year, groups must now think on a more
long-term basis.
This may be difficult for some small to medium
sized groups, however, who still rely on large budg
ets. Examples include outdoor groups that have
big capital expenses such as gear and equipment,
or small performance groups that rely on funding
to cover facility and costume expenses.
"Financial officers have to think harder about
what they are requesting and when they are re
questing it," Mohiuddin said. "The groups have to
think about their values and about what events are
most important to them in terms of the costs."
Mohiuddin also offered some tips for how to
deal with the funding cuts. For example, collabo
rating with other groups could allow student or
ganizations to put on better events that smaller
groups would not be able to pull off by themselves,
he said. Moreover, with the additional number of
students participating, this combined group would
receive more funding.
In fact, the Senate already encourages this type
of collaboration.The executive branch has created
a grant that awards money specifically to collabo
rating groups.
"There is a lot of redundancy in student groups,
which are pursuing the same end." Mohiuddin
said. "That's inefficient because they should com
bine to put on better events, but there is no incen
tive to do this." However, this new funding policy
clearly provides incentive, he said.
Another solution is to cut expenses. Groups
won't necessarily have to cancel events, but rather,
find ways to reduce the costs of putting them on, he
added. Shopping around for the best prices could
greatly reduce expenses; additionally, the ASSU
publicizes where the lowest rates can be found.
A further option that student groups could pur-
sue is seeking out alternate sources
of funding. The Stanford Fund, for
example, is extremely underutilized.
Mohiuddin. Groups could also seek
funding through individual Univer
sity departments.
Finally, student groups should
brainstorm ways to take in revenue.
Performance groups, for example,
could charge admission fees that
would, in turn, go toward their over
all expenses. Mohiuddin also sug
gested that volunteer groups put up
some of the money themselves, per
haps by collecting dues from mem
bers. Not only would this cut costs,
but it would also attract more com
mitted members who feel more at
tached and invested in the groups.
Because the general fee goes to
ward funding undergraduate stu
dent groups, some argue that if it
were raised, then funding could be
raised as well. However, Mohiuddin
maintains that it is highly unlikely
that people will even have the op
portunity to vote for an increase
large enough to compensate for the
funding cuts in the upcoming spring
elections.
