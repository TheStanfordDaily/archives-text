# You can't regret what you've forgotten

### 
College is like the "random frat guy"
your freshman year roommate
hooked up with on the Rohle catwalk
during orientation. She couldn't remember
his name the morning after, and he became
a running joke the rest of the year. We will
remember Stanford's name, but as the sec
ond week of another quarter rolls to a close,
everything else is a bit of a blur. All the
specifics fade, and we are left with a catch
phrase here, a memory there. The past four
years begin to feel like they've boiled down
to an inside joke we've been passing around
for so long that we don't even remember
why it was funny in the first place.
In another six months, we won't remem
ber the details of calculating standard devia
tions, not reading William Blake's
"Jerusalem" or even analyzing "Long Day's
Journey into Night." It's not because they're
particularly complex topics. We also can't re
member the differences between ionic and
covalent bonds, and all that we can muster
about metallic bonds is that they probably
involve metals. Theoretically we learned
that at the age of 14. We can't remember the
specifics of every party, though we'll proba
bly be able to sing "Come on E ileen" on our
deathbeds.
This quarter, we're both surrounded by
sophomores and freshmen in introductory
courses we deliberately forgot to take. You
really shouldn't be able to count up to your
course number with your hands. We look
around and wonder if we looked like that as
sophomores: small, clean and slightly on
edge as we scribbled notes. We want to take
all those whippersnappers aside, stop them
as they write down verbatim quotes. We want
to let them know that after four years of ed
ucation. it's likely that they won't remember
anything quite as well as the anecdotes that
they failed to take down in their notes:
The professor who compared America's
recurring "loss of innocence" to the perenni
ally virginal Doris Day. then waxed poetic
about the "rehymenization" of America.
The time your PWR instructor told you the
too personal story of how he went swimming
naked in a sea at night and came out covered
in bioluminescent algae, "glowing like the
very body of a Greek god." When you've
forgotten your professor's name, you'll still
remember that her hair was five times the
volume of her head.

Forgetting the names of professors is one
thing. But forgetting the names of your
friends is unforgivable...and inevitable. How
many of the people you lived with freshman
year still have last names? In another quar
ter. on the eve of graduation, will anything
remain of the four parties we attended this
weekend? It seemed like a perfect slice of
college life: a live performance of early
Mozart quartets, vodka and whiskey from
an ice luge, fending off foreign grad students
on the dance floor, picking up a few bucks at
a 7-year-old's birthday party.
Four years, and all we've got is a grow
ing case of amnesia. Alzheimer's at the age
of 21.
But just as we're about to log on to Axess
to unenroll and save ourselves the tuition
for this quarter, it begins to come back to us.
Perhaps we did not read word for word all
the books for Language and Prehistory' or
Archaic Greek Art. But we begin to remem
ber snippets, and suddenly it returns: the
physical sensation of our minds being
blown. The moment I understood. "A word
is an artifact, like a pottery shard or a ruined
temple."The awe of seeing live remnants of
2,500-year-old Greek statues in a museum
after a quarter of seeing them merely pro
jected onto the wall. Staging a fake wedding
for forty guests.
So perhaps we still can't remember who
Fichte is. But in the end it's more surprising
that there are so many things we think we'll
never forget . And as the facts fade, the moral
of the fable remains. Don't do the smart
thing when you can do the memorable one.
Because though you can't regret what
you've forgotten, it would suck to get to the
end of four years and not remember any
thing.
