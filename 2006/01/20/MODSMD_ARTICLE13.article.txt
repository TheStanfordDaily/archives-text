# The 						Tree interview
## 
### 
In the spirit of our growing egos, we've
decided to expand our horizons and
enter the world of truly hard-hitting
journalism. Our talents are endless, and if
you think you've already been dazzled be
yond belief with our rhetorical prowess, you
haven't seen anything yet. So what do leg
endary journalists have that we haven't al
ready covered? Well, a top-secret exclusive
interview, of course.
The following is an account of two colum
nists' epic journey into stardom with an ex
tremely rare and controversial encounter
with the one and only Stanford Tree. How we
were able to pull off such an interview must
remain a secret that we shall take to our
graves — but we assure you that the infor
mation you are about to read will both shock
and disturb you to your very soul.
When we arranged our meeting, she insist
ed that we meet at the Treehouse — something
about returning to the Motherland. We sat qui
etly at our table. Waiting. Watching. Neither of
us said anything; how could we? All we could
think was that if we could just pull this off, we
would have done the impossible. Our lives
would change, humanity would be saved and
if we sent a copy of our masterpiece home, our
moms might even put it on the fridge!
Then we see her. The bad-ass tongue ring
and smell of evergreen and alcohol are unmis
takable. She orders a pitcher ofhalf-Bud-half-
Bud-Light, and a straw, then immediately in
sists that we relocate to a more discrete loca

lion. We inform her that we understand trees
have a long and illustrious history of spouting
hogwash to Daily reporters, but that we will
settle for nothing less than the honest-to-good
ness truth in full. With a sinful smirk, she
agrees to our terms and so began our en
counter with the inimitable Stanford Tree.
Spacey Sports: First things first, what's
your name?
Tree: Ellie May Greenhush.
SS: What? Our research says that your
name is Erin Lashnits. And that you're grad
uating this year with a master's in biology.
TiGraduate? I'm a sophomore... at Santa
Clara. I'm considering a major in home eco
nomics, although beauty school has been
calling me lately.
SS: Hmm. this is going to be harder than
we expected. Please keep in mind our agree
ment. OK. next question. If you were a tree,
what kind of —
T: Are you f***ing kidding me? You seri
ously dragged my ass all the way out here to

ask questions like that? Do you think you're
funny or something? If you want real an
swers. then ask me something that my public
wants to know.
SS: Alright, so much for gentle comedy.
Let's get into the real stuff then. Just what did
you do to become Tree?
T: Well, during Tree Week there are always
a lot of stunts performed to impress the selec
tion committee. I figured that since I was on
the diving team for four years — something
fairly unique among Tree candidates — 1
could use this to my advantage. On the last
night of Tree Week, I assembled a substantial
crowd of followers and headed over to the
pool. I climbed to the top of the 10-meter
tower and proceeded to pour a few gallons of
gasoline all over the Slip-n-Slide that I had
conveniently set up earlier that day. Donning
my fireproof suit, I saluted the crowd and lit
myself on fire. I slid off the tower with flames
surrounding me, completed three flips in the
air and as I hit the water, the entire pool —
also doused in gasoline — caught on fire. As
the fire spread to the edges of the pool, multi
colored professional-grade fireworks creat
ed a wall of pyrotechnics that was nothing
short of spectacular. I emerged from the
water victorious. Everyone was blown away.
SS: What do you see yourself doing when
your reign as Tree has ended?
T: [takes a sip from the now half-empty


Cassidy Krug &
Kevin Mclean
Sports
pitcher] Oh I don't know. Being a
D.A.R.E officer would be pretty
sweet.
SS: Do you consider yourself a
mentor to children?
T: [Laughs maniacally] Of course.
SS: What is your favorite food?
T: Live kittens...and beer.
SS: Alright, now a couple person
al questions. Would you rather shave
your head or order nachos from the
Treehouse naked?
T:They told me I had to put a shirt
on if I wanted to order...
SS: Would vou rather have a hor

izontal butt-crack and breast im
plants made of live locusts or go to
Cal?
T: This is a little awkward for me
to talk about, but... [pulls down pants
to reveal horizontal butt crack]
SS: We hear that bribery of for
mer Trees is a major part of the Tree
selection process; do you have any
advice for prospective candidates?
T: I like cars...and solid gold
nuggets.
SS: With Tree Week coming up.
what are your expectations of the
festivities from your end of the field?
T: Police will not have but a mo
ment's rest. The Treehouse will in
evitably be out of beer by the end of
every night. A handful of courageous
Stanford students will have the best,
most intense week of their college

careers, and one lucky bastard will
emerge as The One — the most
badass, insane, hardcore partier, with
the least regard for personal safety,
permanent police record or proper
liver function — the Tree.
So there you have it. History has
just been made. Media stars like Bar
bara Walters, Bob Woodward, Carl
Bernstein and Courtney Cox in
"Scream" haven't got anything on us
now. Pulitzer Prize? Pshh. They'll
have to come up with a whole new
award for us. Brace yourself world,
Cassidy and Kevin have arrived.

and smell of evergreen and alcohol are unmis
takable. She orders a pitcher ofhalf-Bud-half-
Bud-Light, and a straw, then immediately in
sists that we relocate to a more discrete loca

lion. We inform her that we understand trees
have a long and illustrious history of spouting
hogwash to Daily reporters, but that we will
settle for nothing less than the honest-to-good
ness truth in full. With a sinful smirk, she
agrees to our terms and so began our en
counter with the inimitable Stanford Tree.
Spacey Sports: First things first, what's
your name?
Tree: Ellie May Greenhush.
SS: What? Our research says that your
name is Erin Lashnits. And that you're grad
uating this year with a master's in biology.
TiGraduate? I'm a sophomore... at Santa
Clara. I'm considering a major in home eco
nomics, although beauty school has been
calling me lately.
SS: Hmm. this is going to be harder than
we expected. Please keep in mind our agree
ment. OK. next question. If you were a tree,
what kind of —
T: Are you f***ing kidding me? You seri
ously dragged my ass all the way out here to

ask questions like that? Do you think you're
funny or something? If you want real an
swers. then ask me something that my public
wants to know.
SS: Alright, so much for gentle comedy.
Let's get into the real stuff then. Just what did
you do to become Tree?
T: Well, during Tree Week there are always
a lot of stunts performed to impress the selec
tion committee. I figured that since I was on
the diving team for four years — something
fairly unique among Tree candidates — 1
could use this to my advantage. On the last
night of Tree Week, I assembled a substantial
crowd of followers and headed over to the
pool. I climbed to the top of the 10-meter
tower and proceeded to pour a few gallons of
gasoline all over the Slip-n-Slide that I had
conveniently set up earlier that day. Donning
my fireproof suit, I saluted the crowd and lit
myself on fire. I slid off the tower with flames
surrounding me, completed three flips in the
air and as I hit the water, the entire pool —
also doused in gasoline — caught on fire. As
the fire spread to the edges of the pool, multi
colored professional-grade fireworks creat
ed a wall of pyrotechnics that was nothing
short of spectacular. I emerged from the
water victorious. Everyone was blown away.
SS: What do you see yourself doing when
your reign as Tree has ended?
T: [takes a sip from the now half-empty


Cassidy Krug &
Kevin Mclean
Sports
pitcher] Oh I don't know. Being a
D.A.R.E officer would be pretty
sweet.
SS: Do you consider yourself a
mentor to children?
T: [Laughs maniacally] Of course.
SS: What is your favorite food?
T: Live kittens...and beer.
SS: Alright, now a couple person
al questions. Would you rather shave
your head or order nachos from the
Treehouse naked?
T:They told me I had to put a shirt
on if I wanted to order...
SS: Would vou rather have a hor

izontal butt-crack and breast im
plants made of live locusts or go to
Cal?
T: This is a little awkward for me
to talk about, but... [pulls down pants
to reveal horizontal butt crack]
SS: We hear that bribery of for
mer Trees is a major part of the Tree
selection process; do you have any
advice for prospective candidates?
T: I like cars...and solid gold
nuggets.
SS: With Tree Week coming up.
what are your expectations of the
festivities from your end of the field?
T: Police will not have but a mo
ment's rest. The Treehouse will in
evitably be out of beer by the end of
every night. A handful of courageous
Stanford students will have the best,
most intense week of their college

careers, and one lucky bastard will
emerge as The One — the most
badass, insane, hardcore partier, with
the least regard for personal safety,
permanent police record or proper
liver function — the Tree.
So there you have it. History has
just been made. Media stars like Bar
bara Walters, Bob Woodward, Carl
Bernstein and Courtney Cox in
"Scream" haven't got anything on us
now. Pulitzer Prize? Pshh. They'll
have to come up with a whole new
award for us. Brace yourself world,
Cassidy and Kevin have arrived.

In the spirit of our growing egos, we've
decided to expand our horizons and
enter the world of truly hard-hitting
journalism. Our talents are endless, and if
you think you've already been dazzled be
yond belief with our rhetorical prowess, you
haven't seen anything yet. So what do leg
endary journalists have that we haven't al
ready covered? Well, a top-secret exclusive
interview, of course.
The following is an account of two colum
nists' epic journey into stardom with an ex
tremely rare and controversial encounter
with the one and only Stanford Tree. How we
were able to pull off such an interview must
remain a secret that we shall take to our
graves — but we assure you that the infor
mation you are about to read will both shock
and disturb you to your very soul.
When we arranged our meeting, she insist
ed that we meet at the Treehouse — something
about returning to the Motherland. We sat qui
etly at our table. Waiting. Watching. Neither of
us said anything; how could we? All we could
think was that if we could just pull this off, we
would have done the impossible. Our lives
would change, humanity would be saved and
if we sent a copy of our masterpiece home, our
moms might even put it on the fridge!
Then we see her. The bad-ass tongue ring
and smell of evergreen and alcohol are unmis
takable. She orders a pitcher ofhalf-Bud-half-
Bud-Light, and a straw, then immediately in
sists that we relocate to a more discrete loca

lion. We inform her that we understand trees
