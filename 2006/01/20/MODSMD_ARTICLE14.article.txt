Lawsuit article misleading
Your headline in the article regarding a
suit brought against the University ("Facts
emerge in AD lawsuit," Jan. 17) is both inac
curate and misleading. The article presents
allegations made in the lawsuit. These alle
gations are not "facts." but rather claims
made in a legal complaint by the plaintiff.
The University will vigorously defend itself
against these claims and,should the suit go to
trial, a jury will determine the facts.
In a related matter, the article asserts that
the suit has had an impact on the search for a
new athletic director. In particular. Senior
Associate Athletic Director Debra Gore-
Mann is singled out. These assertions are
made without any substantiation. Although
it would be inappropriate to publicly discuss
a search for any position, the University was
aware of the allegations made in this suit be
fore former Athletic Director Ted Lcland re
tired and Gore-Mann subsequently became
a potential candidate for that position. The
extensive media coverage that merely re
cites, sometimes incorrectly, those allega
tions has not had an impact on the potential
candidacy of Gore-Mann.

Suit unjustified
I love The Daily. I read it from time to
time on break, and Tuesday's was by far the
best I've read in a long time. The two front
page stories I read were: "Freshmen De
frauded and Upset," and "World's Most
Troublesome Employee Fired — Files Suit
for Emotional Distress." I mean, honestly,
what freshman doesn't get defrauded at least
once? It's a valuable part of the university
learning experience. And I'm not even going
to start with my opinions of the woman who
claims that she stayed in a work environment
that made her miserable, was troubling to
her conscience and eventually will cause her
untimely demise. That's like one of the strip
pers at New Century Theater suing her man
agement for making her feel like a sex object
once she's 40 and has been working there for
19 years. Keep it coming.

"Brokeback" seen widely
In yesterday's article "LGBT-CRC wel
comes 'Brokeback,'" Mehul TVivedi seemed
to support gay cowboys breaking some
backs while getting their 'Mount on but also

claimed that, "In my hometown of Dallas, it's
really difficult to find theaters willing to
show the movie." Now I sometimes indulge
in Dallas-hating, but I have to point out he's
flat out wrong. When I saw 'Brokeback" in
Dallas over winter break, it was showing on
two screens at the theater, and about three
quarters of the packed seats were filled with
straight couples. In fact, it is only playing on
one more screen in San Francisco than in
Dallas, and there are two more theaters
showing "Brokeback" within 20 miles of my
house in Dallas than there are within 20
miles of Stanford.
Let's not let snobbery obscure one of the
best facts about "Brokeback" — it's doing
quite well in unexpected markets like
Kansas City, Fort Worth and even Utah
(seven theaters are playing it in the Salt Lake
City area).
That 40-pounding. Bush-voting, 10-gal
lon-hat-wearing SMU frat
boy may like to watch movies that go boom,
but that doesn't necessarily mean he's too
closed-minded to let his girlfriend (or gay
friend) drag him to "Brokeback."
