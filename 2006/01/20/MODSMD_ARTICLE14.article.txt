Lawsuit article misleading
Your headline in the article regarding a
suit brought against the University ("Facts
emerge in AD lawsuit," Jan. 17) is both inac
curate and misleading. The article presents
allegations made in the lawsuit. These alle
gations are not "facts." but rather claims
made in a legal complaint by the plaintiff.
The University will vigorously defend itself
against these claims and,should the suit go to
trial, a jury will determine the facts.
In a related matter, the article asserts that
the suit has had an impact on the search for a
new athletic director. In particular. Senior
Associate Athletic Director Debra Gore-
Mann is singled out. These assertions are
made without any substantiation. Although
it would be inappropriate to publicly discuss
a search for any position, the University was
aware of the allegations made in this suit be
fore former Athletic Director Ted Lcland re
tired and Gore-Mann subsequently became
a potential candidate for that position. The
extensive media coverage that merely re
cites, sometimes incorrectly, those allega
tions has not had an impact on the potential
candidacy of Gore-Mann.

Suit unjustified
I love The Daily. I read it from time to
time on break, and Tuesday's was by far the
best I've read in a long time. The two front
page stories I read were: "Freshmen De
frauded and Upset," and "World's Most
Troublesome Employee Fired — Files Suit
for Emotional Distress." I mean, honestly,
what freshman doesn't get defrauded at least
once? It's a valuable part of the university
learning experience. And I'm not even going
to start with my opinions of the woman who
claims that she stayed in a work environment
that made her miserable, was troubling to
her conscience and eventually will cause her
untimely demise. That's like one of the strip
pers at New Century Theater suing her man
agement for making her feel like a sex object
once she's 40 and has been working there for
19 years. Keep it coming.

"Brokeback" seen widely
In yesterday's article "LGBT-CRC wel
comes 'Brokeback,'" Mehul TVivedi seemed
to support gay cowboys breaking some
backs while getting their 'Mount on but also

claimed that, "In my hometown of Dallas, it's
really difficult to find theaters willing to
show the movie." Now I sometimes indulge
in Dallas-hating, but I have to point out he's
flat out wrong. When I saw 'Brokeback" in
Dallas over winter break, it was showing on
two screens at the theater, and about three
quarters of the packed seats were filled with
straight couples. In fact, it is only playing on
one more screen in San Francisco than in
Dallas, and there are two more theaters
showing "Brokeback" within 20 miles of my
house in Dallas than there are within 20
miles of Stanford.
Let's not let snobbery obscure one of the
best facts about "Brokeback" — it's doing
quite well in unexpected markets like
Kansas City, Fort Worth and even Utah
(seven theaters are playing it in the Salt Lake
City area).
That 40-pounding. Bush-voting, 10-gal
lon-hat-wearing SMU frat
boy may like to watch movies that go boom,
but that doesn't necessarily mean he's too
closed-minded to let his girlfriend (or gay
friend) drag him to "Brokeback."

More heart transplants needed
Gaea Shaw was very lucky to get
a heart transplant ("Heart trans
plant recipient raises awareness,"
Jan. 19). More than half of the peo
ple who need an organ transplant in
the United States will die before
they get one. Most of these deaths
are needless. Americans donate
only about half of the organs that
could save lives and relieve suffer
ing. They bury or cremate about
20,(XM) transplantable organs every
year. More than 6,(X)0 of their neigh
bors die every year as a result.
There is a simple solution to the
organ shortage — give organs first to
people who have agreed to donate
their own organs when they die.
Giving organs first to organ
donors will convince more people to
register as organ donors. It will also
make the organ allocation system
fairer. About 60 percent of the or
gans transplanted in the United
States go to people who haven't
agreed to donate their own organs

when they die. People who aren't
prepared to share the gift of life
shouldn't be eligible for transplants
as long as there is a shortage of or
gans.

Was it actually plagiarism?
The Stanford Daily has a respon
sibility to report facts, rather than
partisan claims, in its lead news arti
cles. A Jan. 18 article, "Still Dodgy?"
fails notably when it unthinkingly re
peats the speech organizers' plagia
rism allegation.
By definition, plagiarism is the
misrepresentation "as one's own" of
another's work. Yet even Ibrahim
Al-Marashi has conceded that the
dossier did not claim to be original
and stated up front that it drew upon
a number of sources, both intelli
gence and otherwise. Clearly, this is
not plagiarism, and given that the
dossier was for internal use only, it
could be considered fair use.
Agenda-driven organizations
such as the Coalition for Justice in
the Middle East may wish to drama
tize the issue, but that is not the role
of The Daily; such a journalistic faux

pas should be both acknowledged
and corrected.
Additionally it should be noted
that the official Lord Butler inquiry
found no evidence of either deliber
ate distortion or culpable negligence
in the Iraq report.

What deal?
In the debate over Stanford
reneging on its commitment to pro
vide decent trails in exchange for its
massive development, both sides
used the argument that a "deal is a
deal."
The deal that the Stanford boost
ers quote and which Santa Clara
Board of Supervisors most regret
tably endorsed shortly before Christ
mas ("University, county agree on
trails", Jan. 18), has the following
brief history:
It came out of a crucial meeting in
December 20()2, at which the super
visors caved in to the bully-boys
from Stanford. At that meeting the
Board voted to remove from further
study the two trails recommended by
their County Parks and Recreation
staff.
The process leading to the

Board's vote started with intimida
tion described by the Palo Alto
Weekly (Sept. IS. 2002) as a "full
court press" by Stanford manage
ment.That was followed by a barrage
of litigation threats from Stanford's
lawyers.
Because there was minimal no
tice related to that vote, it took place
with no debate in an eerily deserted
auditorium.
However, there is a deal that
should have been honored; the deal
that Stanford made at the beginning
of the process: to provide good, safe
and environmentally sound connec
tivity to the Arastradero Preserve. It
may well have been in some part a
good-faith agreement; good faith
with the community that has once
again been broken both by Stanford
and the supervisors. As The Palo
Alto Weekly noted last week:
"That's how Stanford wins — with
lawyers, money and a will to outlast
its critics."
However, giving the finger to the
community that surrounds it can be
very costly to a university over the
long term, and a day may come when
Stanford comes to regret the arro
gance of its current management.
