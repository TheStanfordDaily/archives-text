## No. 2 swimming trying to find form against Arizona schools 
### ALEXIS PETERSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Today, the formidable force that is Stan
ford men's swimming and diving team begins
its hunt fora national title. The Cardinal hit
the pool this afternoon to host their first
meet of the season against Arizona and Ari
zona State.
The competition between the No. 2
ranked Cardinal and the fifth-ranked Wild

cats is an important launching pad for the
rest of Stanford's season. Arizona, who has
failed to beat Stanford since 2(K)1, will fight
to defend its undefeated record. The Cardi
nal, meanwhile, will focus on demonstrating
the kind of crushing power that has led them
to Pac-10 dominance. Stanford boasts the
staggering record of having won every single
Pacific 10 Championship since IMB2.
So, junior freestyler Ben Wildman-To
briner is hardly exaggerating when he de

scribes this weekend as, "looking to start the
process of finding our championship form."
After all, this is a team that is skilled at
finding its championship form. And Wild
man -Tobriner, a world-class swimmer, is sure
to emerge as one of the team's strongest
leaders.
Strength, in general, isn't in short supply
among the Cardinal swimmers and divers.
Stanford returns a number of seasoned vet
erans to its program, notably senior swim

mers Tobias Oriwol, Michael McLean and
Mark Stephens. All three were instrumental
in the Cardinal's second-place NCAA finish
last year and look to be solid leaders in the
pool this year as well. Divers Nathan Kim, a
sophomore, and Kevin McLean, a junior,
also have the potential to make great contri
butions to the team, after promising per
formances at last year's Pac-lOs.
With so many talented individuals,
the key to greatness could be in Stan
ford's ability to solidify both its goals
and efforts as a team.
"Over the next six weeks our team
will mold into a cohesive unit; this is the
all-important beginning," Wildman-To
briner said.
Head coach Skip Kenney — a three
time Olympic coach, six-time NCAA
Coach of the Year and 17-time Pac-10
Coach of the Year — leads this cohe
sion process from the deck. He has seen
Stanford to seven NCAA titles and has
placed his team into the nation's top
three 21 times.
As Stanford looks to dominate the
competition over the course of the sea
son. the lessons Kenney has taught
carry even more importance. In the first
race in months, composure is every
thing.
According to Wildman-Tobriner,
"swimming smart, swimming with pas
sion and swimming with focus," are nec
essary fora win.
It also might help that Stanford cur
rently boasts what could ultimately
prove to be its best junior class in school
history. They have set four individual
school records (two by Wildman-To
briner. in the 50-meter free and the 100-
meter free) and the team has already
broken three team relay records.
But the Cardinal could have more
accomplishments by this week's end.
Wildman-Tobriner cites the possibility
of racing Wildcat swimmers Lyndon
Ferns and Simon Burnett as the most
exciting prospect for his weekend.
"These are two of the fastest sprint
ers in the world, and I always enjoy
competing against the best," Wildman-
Tobriner said.
Events begin at the Avery Aquatic
Complex today at 1 p.m.. as Stanford
hosts Arizona. Saturday, the Cardinal
take on the No. 23 Sun Devils beginning
at noon.
