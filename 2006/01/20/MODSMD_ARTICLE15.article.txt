## No. 2 swimming trying to find form against Arizona schools 
### ALEXIS PETERSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Today, the formidable force that is Stan
ford men's swimming and diving team begins
its hunt fora national title. The Cardinal hit
the pool this afternoon to host their first
meet of the season against Arizona and Ari
zona State.
The competition between the No. 2
ranked Cardinal and the fifth-ranked Wild

cats is an important launching pad for the
rest of Stanford's season. Arizona, who has
failed to beat Stanford since 2(K)1, will fight
to defend its undefeated record. The Cardi
nal, meanwhile, will focus on demonstrating
the kind of crushing power that has led them
to Pac-10 dominance. Stanford boasts the
staggering record of having won every single
Pacific 10 Championship since IMB2.
So, junior freestyler Ben Wildman-To
briner is hardly exaggerating when he de

scribes this weekend as, "looking to start the
process of finding our championship form."
After all, this is a team that is skilled at
finding its championship form. And Wild
man -Tobriner, a world-class swimmer, is sure
to emerge as one of the team's strongest
leaders.
Strength, in general, isn't in short supply
among the Cardinal swimmers and divers.
Stanford returns a number of seasoned vet
erans to its program, notably senior swim

mers Tobias Oriwol, Michael McLean and
Mark Stephens. All three were instrumental
in the Cardinal's second-place NCAA finish
last year and look to be solid leaders in the
pool this year as well. Divers Nathan Kim, a
sophomore, and Kevin McLean, a junior,
also have the potential to make great contri
butions to the team, after promising per
formances at last year's Pac-lOs.
