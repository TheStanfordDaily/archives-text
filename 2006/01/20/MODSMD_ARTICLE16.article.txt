## 'Cats no match for No. 14 Card Cardinal record sixth straight win in lopsided game at Maples

TARA VANDERVEER, head coach

Two days before its battle against
No. 15 Arizona State, the No. 14
Stanford women's basketball team
warmed up against a lackluster Ari
zona squad and won easily, 82-51, last
night.
Sophomore guard Candice Wig
gins had a season-low 11 points
against the Wildcats, but the rest of
the Cardinal more than made up for
it.

Stanford (12-4,7-1
Pacific-10 Confer
ence) led from the
start with a 10-0 run,
four and a half min
utes in. The Wildcats
never caught up as
the Cardinal finished
their first half ahead,
43-28, a gap that was
never lessened in the
second half.
With a comfort
able lead, Stanford
was able to have seven
players log 19 or more
minutes, and six
scored nine or more
points. Among those
were, as usual. Wig
gins, junior center

ALL-AROUND
EFFORT
The Cardinal had seven
players with 19 or more
minutes and six with nine
or more points. Usual
front-runners Wiggins,
Smith and Rappahahn
had 40 points combined,
but freshmen contributed
largely as well, with 13
from Harmon and nine
from Gold-Onwude.

Brooke Smith who had 20 points and
senior guard Krista Rappahahn who
had nine. Also stepping up, though,
were freshmen Jillian Harmon with 13
and Rosalyn Gold-Onwude with nine.
"It's always good for us to be able
to play our bench and get valuable
minutes for people," head coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "We had some real
good opportunities, and 1 think peo
ple will benefit from the playing time
they got."
The wide variety of contributions
for the night was a welcome change
for the Cardinal, who have been rely
ing on Wiggins, Smith and Rappa
hahn to score big and take the lead
the past few games.The trio account
ed for 73 of 85 points against Califor
nia on Sunday and 62 of 76 against
Oregon the week prior, but only 40
of 82 last night.
Making her first big contribution
since returning from an injury was

junior forward Kristen Newlin, who
missed eight games after a stress re
action in her left femur. She came
back Sunday, started against Cal and
garnered six points during 15 min
utes. Another 15 minutes and nine
points last night showed the Cardinal
that their post is ready to be a pres
ence on the court again. Newlin said
she feels better each day and felt no
pain in the game against the Wildcats.
"Kristen being back really gives
us a whole new ability to go inside
and be bigger, stronger and more
physical, and we have a lot of differ
ent options with that," VanDerveer
said. "The first game back 1 think she
was pressing a little bit. but this game
she looked relaxed and was finishing
really well inside."
Newlin adds much to the Cardinal
lineup, civine Smith help in the post

and allowing her
more in-game rest.
But among the
team as a whole, en
ergy has been a prob
lem. Sunday's victory
over Cal, although se
cured with a 12-point
margin, exemplified
this as Stanford came
out less enthusiastic
than normal. With in
creasing contribu
tions from more play
ers, however, the Car
dinal anticipate a
more rounded team,
which is more even in
energy output.
"We want to have,

I'd say, at least a
seven-player but more like an eight
player rotation to keep people
fresh," VanDerveer said.
Absent from last night's rotation
was sophomore guard Cissy Pierce.
Pierce missed a practice this week
and was suspended from last night's
game as well as Saturday's.
Wiggins looks to make a come
back on Saturday against Arizona
State after a disappointing 11-point
evening following 37 points at Ore
gon and 33 against Cal.
"She's extremely competitive,
and I think this will motivate her,"
VanDerveer said. "I wouldn't want
to guard her on Saturday â€” I would
n't ever want to guard her anyway. I
think she will compete at a higher
level. She likes to score; she likes to
make things happen. She won't get
down on herself, and she won't sec
ond guess; she'll just come out and
play harder."
