## Beerlympics: Competition for everyone 
### 
"X Tith the Torino Winter Olympics
%/%/ rapidly approaching (Feb. 10-
Y â–¼ 26), I find myself looking back
on my own sports career and wondering
if I ever had what it would take to make
the international stage.
I may not have the prototypical
Olympian build or all that "mental
toughness" that NBC loves to bring up
but, 1 still think, given the right sport, 1
could be a world class athlete.
As I think back over my various ath
letic endeavors. I sadly realize that, de
spite having spread a respectable
amount of athletic talent across base
ball, swimming, lacrosse, crew and golf,
there's still no pentathlon featuring
those particular five events.
Then it hit me. I have a skill constant
ly in use that could land me right on that
medal stand. I am a world class drinker.
And with that in mind, I'm going to
present you with my idea for the first
ever Beerlympics, a series of grueling
(and drooling) events designed to bring
the glitz and glamour of the internation
al stage to the common man.
First off, in our parade of pale ale
sports is the rage cage quarters tourna
ment. Comparable to a marathon, this
event is based on the simple premise of
bouncing a quarter off a table and into a
standard red plastic cup.
The set-up works as follows: the
"beerletes" circle around the table with
cups filled a quarter of the way up with
beer. There are two empty cups (there
can be more depending on the number
of beerletes) that start on opposite
sides of the table. After a tap in the cen
ter to begin, the shooting commences. If
able to get the quarter in the cup, you
pass to your right. If a cup catches up
with you while you are still shooting,
you must drink a cup filled with beer. If
a person makes the shot on the first at
tempt, the cup may be placed anywhere
on the table.
The beauty of rage cage quarters is
that, ultimately, your demise lies in your
hands. You are not done competing until
you tap out. thus halting the game and al
lowing you to bow out gracefully, saving
room for the second event, the Shotgun.
The Shotgun places a premium on
speed. The event is set up as a March
Madness type bracket. Contestants
square off and try to chug a beer as fast
as possible.Technique is key here, as the
contestant must suck the beer out of a
previously created hole in the side of
the can. By popping the top, a place for
air to escape is created and the liquid
flows quickly. The first one to finish the
beer moves on to the next round of play.
Now, as we know, the Olympics are
not all about individual performance
but instead highlight some of the most
beautiful team performances in the
world. The Beerlympics recognizes this,
and includes a variety of team-oriented
games in its venues that allow for coop
eration and teamwork.
Starting with a variation of rage cage
quarters, the Beerlympics brings you
team quarters. Here, the goal is not to
outlast the other team but rather to out
shoot them. A set number of cups are
placed on the table, each filled with the
same amount of beer. The two teams
square off, each with a quarter in hand.
After the tap to start the game, shoot
ing again commences. If a team is able to
hit a cup with beer in it.the other team
forfeits its quarter and must drink the
beer from the cup to regain the ability to
