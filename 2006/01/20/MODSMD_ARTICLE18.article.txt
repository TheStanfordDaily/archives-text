# TRACK AND FIELD
## Track hopes to build off strong finish 
### ISRAEL ROJAS 
After a record-breaking 2(X)5 season, the Cardinal hope to
continue improving until they reach the NCAA Champi
onships. Last season, several athletes etched their names into
the Stanford record book, and they hope to lead this year's
team to further success.
In what head coach Edrick Floreal described as perhaps the
second most successful women's season ever, the women
claimed the Pacific 10 Championships, ending UCLA's eight
year reign. At the 2005 NCAA meet, the women came away
with fifth-place, continuing a streak of top 10 finishes over the
last five years. With many athletes returning, the women are in
position to be even more competitive this year, and they look
to place in the top four at the NCA As.
The women boast a squad filled with members from the Na
tional Champion Cross Country team, continuing the Stanford
tradition of premier middle- and distance-runners. Arianna
Lambie, a four-time All-American junior who owns the nations
best 1.500 meter time fora freshman, leads the way. She is sup
ported by a deep squad, consisting of many All Americans who
hope to continue Stanford's dominance in the middle- and dis
tance-events.
A strong core of sprinters, jumpers and throwers compli
ments the distance team. Junior Janice Davis returns to at
tempt to break her own records in the 60 meter and 200 meter,
while redshirt junior Ashley Purnell looks to do the same in the
4(10.
Members from the record-breaking relays also return,
adding to.a strong sprint unit. Sophomore Erica McLain, a
member of Team USA at this summer's World Championships,
returns as arguably the best jumper in the nation to lead Stan
ford's jumping unit. She holds the national record in the triple
jump and was the first athlete to win both the long- and triple
jump at last year's Pac-10 Championship.
For the throwers, senior Sarah Hopping and redshirt soph
omore Danielle Maier also return, with school records in the
hammer and javelin, respectively. Floreal expects the throwing
unit to continue developing this season, and he expects strong
contribution towards a national championship campaign.
The men's 2005 season was a bit less successful, though it did
conclude with a seventh-place finish at the NCAA meet,
adding to Stanford's prolific success and giving it seven top 10
finishes in the last eight years. With the departure of some top
performers, the team rebuilding
Among the goals for this season is a return to the top of the
Pac-10. Stanford's trademark has always been middle- and
long-distances, and its number one priority is to reestablish its
dominance in the Pac-10.
"We are the benchmark [in middle- and distance- events],"
Florealsaid.
Stanford lost two top athletes, lan Dobson and Ryan Hall,
who have a combined 14 All-America honors, including Dob
son's 5,000 meter title champion Hall's outdoor 5,000 meter
title. But Stanford has the ability to replace even the best of
runners, and this year the task will be up to redshirt sopho
mores Neftalem Araia and Russel Brown and junior Joaquin
Chapa to fill those shoes.
For the throwing squad, senior Michael Robertson returns
to defend his national title in the discus. He owns the school
record and looks to lead his unit to further success.
Another former freshman who made an impact last year
was Wopamo Osaisai. With the school record in the 60 meter
and 100 meter, as well as the freshman record in the 200, Osai
sai will likely be depended on to score points for the sprinting
unit.
Jumpers Solomon Welch and Feranmi Okanlami return for
another chance at the school's triple jump record and to lead
the rest of the unit.
With few key freshman recruits for this season, Floreal is de
pending on current runners to step-up fulfill their potential.
"We have enough talent to be really good," Floreal said,
while citing that strong leadership from the runners will be es
sential towards achieving success.
While track can be viewed as an individual sport, teammates
have a huge impact on one another. Stanford's approach of let
ting everyone be an individual has led to much success,but Flo
real made it known where unity stands on the list of priorities.
"Number one: we're a team," Floreal said.
