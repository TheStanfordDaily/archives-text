ALVIN CHOW/The Stanford Daily
Freshman guard Mitch Johnson scored six points and added a team-high five
assists forthe Cardinal, who came back from an 1 1 -point halftime deficit, but
fell in overtime.
The overtime period turned on
two crucial turnovers by the Cardi
nal (7-7, 3-3), both on questionable
calls by the officials. With the game
tied at 77-77 and 2:48 to go in the pe
riod, senior center Matt Haryasz lost
the ball underneath the Stanford
basket. Arizona freshman forward
Marcus Williams made a layup on
Arizona's next possession and con
verted the three-point opportunity
to give the Wildcats an 80-77 advan
tage.
Haryasz converted two free
throws to bring the Cardinal within
one. But on the team's next posses
sion, Arizona center Ivan Radenovic
picked up a loose ball and called a
timeout a split second before he fell
out of bounds. Junior point guard
Mustafa Shakur converted a three
point play on Arizona's next posses

sion to put the Wildcats up, 83-79,
With 50 seconds left, Stanford was
forced to foul the rest of the way, and
Arizona made five of its six final
shots before Adams iced the game
with his emphatic dunk.
"Go down to the official's locker
room and ask those guys," Stanford
head coach TYent Johnson said when
asked for his reaction to the calls.
He was also whistled fora techni
cal foul in the first half, though John
son maintained that he was only try
ing to call a timeout.
He later added, "The officiating
had nothing to do with (the outcome
of the game]. What it boils down to is
that they made plays, and we didn't."
Stanford rallied in the second pe
riod after falling behind by 11 points
in the first. The Cardinal began the
second half looking to push the pace,

a strategy that seemed to catch a
much faster Arizona team by sur
prise. Haryasz converted two dunks
early on for four of his game-high 25
points. Then, with Arizona leading,
56-48, Stanford went on a 15-6 run.
The run, keyed by two Mitch John
son three-pointers and another by
senior point guard Chris Hernandez,
put the Cardinal up by one with 9:33
remaining in the half.
The game turned into a scramble
after that; as each point grew more
precious, each team seemed to have
trouble making shots and holding
onto the ball. Arizona shot only 33
percent from the field in the second
half, and the Cardinal committed
several of their 22 turnovers down
the stretch.
Haryasz had a chance to win the
game in the final seconds of regula

tion, but Arizona players forced a
jump ball when he went up fora shot
in the paint. Haryasz dropped to his
knees as if he had expected a foul,
but he refused to comment about
the officiating after the game.
"We fought back in the second
half," Haryasz said. "We had a
chance to win. and 1 was proud of the
way we played. But I want to give
credit to their team â€” they played a
very good game."
After falling behind. 8-3, to begin
the contest, the Wildcats exploded
with a 13-0 run early in the first half.
In a period of only 2:15, they had run
up a 16-8 lead on a series of fast
breaks and three-pointers. Shakur
dished out three of his career-high
12 assists during the run, the most by
an Arizona player since Luke Wal
ton had 13 against Stanford in 2000.

The Wildcats also shot well from
the perimeter in the first half, mak
ing seven of 11 three-pointers. They
shot 45 percent overall from the
field. Williams and forward Ivan
Radenovic made all five of their
combined three-point attempts in
the first half, forcing Stanford's for
wards to the perimeter and creating
space for Arizona's guards to drive
to the basket.
The Cardinal were able to stay
close throughout the rest of the half.
Williams, who finished with a team
high 22 points, was disappointed that
the Wildcats could not put Stanford
away in the second.
"We cannot give up a 10-point
lead, but we got the win. and that's
what's important," Williams said.
The Cardinal, already thin on big
men with the absence of injured

sophomore center Peter Prowitt,
suffered a scare when sophomore
forward Taj Finger injured his nose
with 11 minutes to play in the first
half. Finger returned with a face
mask near the end of the first half.
Freshman forward Laurence Hill
logged a season-high 32 minutes off
the bench and was on the floor for
much of the stretch run, along with
Johnson. Hill scored 13 points, and
Johnson dished out five assists.
Arizona, which had lost three of
its last four games heading into the
contest, was dealt a blow off the
court on Wednesday afternoon,
when head coach Lute Olsen an
nounced that Chris Rogers, the
team's third-leading scorer with 10.8
points per game, had been dismissed
from the team for undisclosed rea
sons.
