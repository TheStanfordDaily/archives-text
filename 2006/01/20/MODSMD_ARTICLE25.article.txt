# The 						time to act is now; the state of entertainment can't get much worse.

### BETSY CONGDON INTERMISSION SUNDAY MORNING TALK SHOW HOST 
Here at Intermission we have watched the state of entertainment
decline to reality television and lip-singing on S.N.L. The city of jazz
was severely damaged by a force of nature and Johnny Carson of
"Tonight Show" fame left us. And so, I ask. what is the state of enter
tainment? While this question might seem of minor consequence, it
truly reflects the current status of our world.
The state of entertainment is a sorry one. When the American
people come home to lose themselves in television only to find fake
reality shows; when UGGs can still be found on the feet of women
(even in the summer); when Intermission has to run two two-star
movies in the same week; our culture's fall into Limbo, oh wait... the
Catholic Church says that doesn't exist anymore so we're okay, is in
evitable.
At one time, American culture was celebrated around the world
as a leader of creative expression. Yet, its strength, as that of our econ
omy, is a shadow of what it once was. Intermission believes that it can
be better, that it should be better, and that YOU will make it better.
In 2(X)6, only you can prevent the destruction. It is a vital part of the
War on Terror. As the world stops respecting our entertainment, our
way of life, its citizens begin to be distrustful of our democratic ten
dencies.
Turn off your television. NetflixandXßox can supply hours of en-

tertainment without .laving to worry about how you feel horrible for
the contestants on "The Biggest Loser," particularly in the couples
edition. Besides, all of your favorite shows (even if they aren't anyone
else's favorite, i.e. the cancellation of "Arrested Development"),
come out in the DVD box set version which features no commericals.
Bonus, you don't have to wait a week between episodes.
Watch independent films. I'm not saying that you need to watch
those movies that are so "artistic" that you can't even follow the sto
ryline. But, if movies like "Good Night, and Good Luck" have taught
us anything, it's that in this age of ditigal entertainment it is only get
ting easier to see good independent films.
Support Live Music. With concert ticket prices skyrocketing due
to easy scalping via the internet, this request might be the hardest. The
music industry has been a hard thing to love over the last few years.
Screw-ups like prosecuting 10-year-olds over Napster and the Sony
debacle have left me wishing that they were in Limbo (Sorry, that
whole situation just cracks me up). Live 8 concerts and my own expe
rience at Vegoose (see Intermission on Nov. 4,20()5) prove that I can
hate the industry and still support the music.
The terrorists are winning in America. They are teaching our chil
dren fear. Terror is destorying our efforts to create democracies over
seas, democracies that will secure our safety and protect the rights of
people around the world. You, the American people must do your
part. You must preserve what is left of American culture, your cul
ture. God bless you all. God Bless the United States of America.
