## 'The New World' offers nothing new 
### JOSH SMITH INTERMISSIONS (ALMOST) JOHN SMITH 
in the midst of the dopey love story be
tween Pocahontas and John Smith in
writer/director Terrence Malick's "The
New World," Smith's voice-over narration
tells us that "there is only this — all else is

unreal/' Uh-huh. Maybe, John, if you
could paint with all the colors of the
wind. In this overly poetic (not to men
tion overly long) film, Malick manages
to take a beautiful (though mostly fabri
cated) star-crossed love story, serenely

idyllic cinematography and solid perfor
mances by his lead actors, and turns it

into maudlin gobbledygook, remi
niscent of something produced in an
eighth grade poetry class.
Mostly, it's Malick's directorial
tics that prohibit "The New World"
from being successful. Malick is in
famous for editing his films until the
very last minute, and, well, it shows.
I mean, how long can it take for Poc
ahontas to hand Smith a feather? (I

counted to 17, slowly.) Moreover, as

in"The Thin Red Line," the direc

tor's previous film, the reliance on
voice-over narration draws an even
deeper attention to the weakness of the

script. In fact, dialogue

is so sparse that the

characters never
utter the name

"Pocahontas." Not
even once! Fora

while, 1 was won
dering if I was

simply project
ing her into the

story.
This subtlety was misplaced, as nothing else
about the film was subtle. "The New World" is
a story in three acts, each divided by a full fade
to black. Act One sees Smith (Colin Farrell)
and his hundred or so compatriots land their
three small vessels upon the virgin Virginia
soil. Soon, Smith is captured by the "naturals,"
the Powhatan tribe. He is rescued from execu

tion by Pocahontas
(Q'Orianka Kilcher) and
then lives in peace with his
captors for the next several
months, falling deeply in
love with his young savior.
Act Two sees Smith return
to the fledgling colony,
where the savagery of the
Englishmen can be wit
nessed juxtaposed nicely
against the tranquility of

the Natives. Finally, Act Three sees Smith
tearfully return to England at the behest of

King James I. Slyly, John Rolfe (Christian
Bale) takes Smith's place by Pocahontas's

side, Anglifying her into a high-heeled
wearing tobacco farmer.

It is a nice story of the unrequited love
between Pocahontas and John Smith.
Who cares if Wikipedia insists that it
didn't happen? It is rather lovely.

Unfortunately, the film, just like its Disney pre
decessor with its inexplicable talking willow
tree, couldn't truly capture this. In"The New
World," the narrative makes little sense. At
first, it follows the story from Smith's point of
view, but Rolfe takes over the voice-over nar
ration when Smith leaves. Indeed, in the end, it
is Pocahontas we care about most, for it is her
ethereal effervescence that carries the film. In

deed, though only 14 at the
time the movie was shot,
Kilcher makes a mature and
jovial performance.
However, she can
not bail out this sinking
ship, as every plugged hole
just allows another to open.
Though the filming of the
natural settings is unmistak
ably impressive, James
Horner's out-of-place Wag

nerian score ruins it. By the end of the film,
someone should have demanded that the
piano soloist be taken out back and slapped
with a tube sock full of pounds sterling.
Though "The New World" comes complete
with a compelling story and some sensational
vistas, it is long and dull and has some cringe
inducingly lofty voice-overs. For something of
quality, I suggest looking once more just
around the river bend.
