# Looking For ... a reason to have watched This Movie

### FARIS AL MOHIUDDIN INTERMISSION COMEDIAN 
You've gotta love those fish out-of-water
scenarios: pacificists in the army, a male coach
of an all girl team, women in the CS depart
ment — all comic gold. Just set 'em up, stand
back and let the hilarity ensue! At least, that's
the conventional wisdom of most comedies
today.
Indeed, the premise of "Looking for Humor

in the Muslim World," writ
ten/directed by Albert
Brooks, seems to offer a po
tentially hearty helping of
engaging and timely satire.
Alas, this adroit opening is
ultimately wasted on a film
which meanders for anoth
er 90 minutes blindly grop
ing fora crescendo that
never manifests.

★★ i:
"Looking for Comedy in the
Muslim World"
Dir. Albert Brooks

Brooks plays actor Albert Brooks (damn
that Hollywood type-casting) as a hyper neurot
ic caricature of himself approached by the State
Department to spend a month in India and Pak
istan and write a 500-page report describing
what makes Muslims laugh. Woo-ed by a poten
tial Medal of Freedom. Brooks begrudgingly ac
cepts the task of using comedy to foster an un

derstanding of the Muslim world.
So here's my first problem: if the goal was to
understand supposedly the inscrutable, hostile
Muslim world, why send Brooks to South Asian
countries that enjoy strong relationships with
the United States? Wouldn't it have been more
telling to understand the Muslims of, oh I don't
know, the Middle East? Perhaps Brooks
thought a trek to Saudi Arabia would be too
"Syrianna-esque" for his taste. Although the

film's title seems provocative,
"Looking ..cops-out of a real
culture clash by boiling the Mus
lim world down to India.
As soon as Brooks arrives in
New Delhi, the obligatory out
source jokes commence — at
least they didn't resort to any cab
driver jokes. Immersed in a for
eign environment. Brooks has no

clue how to proceed (that's okay, because nei
ther does the film). We follow Brooks and his
über-perky assistant, Maya (Sheetai Sheeth) as
he futilely interviews Indians off the street,
stares blankly at yoga laughing exercises and
fails spectacularly at his attempt to put on
Delhi's first comedy show.
Brooks' endeavors prove fruitless, leaving
him only a few pages towards his report's mini-

mum length. Other than "shit jokes don't fly in
Delhi" and "Polish jokes work everywhere"

Brooks and the viewing audi
ence learn nothing about what
foreign cultures find funny.
Unfortunately, this stagnation
further detracts from any pos
sible character development.
Even a fish-out-of-water
movie needs to incorporate
some modicum of personal
growth — something to make
the experience worthwhile.
Yet Brooks, as a person and as
a comedian, seems no differ
ent from the film's opening
than when the credits start to
roll. An entirely disposable
subplot involving Maya and
her jealous Iranian boyfriend,
like the movie, goes nowhere.
Speaking of disposable
plots, there's the Indo-Pak
istan conflict supposedly ignit

ed by both nations' mutual suspicion of the co
median's presence. I find it just a bit ironic that
this pseudo-satire suggests that India and Pak
istan would go to war because their intelligence
cannot comprehend the context of "bombing a

comedy performance." There's only one coun
try I know that's gone to war based on unfound-

Ed accusations and faulty in
telligence. Which is it? Dis
cuss amongst yourselves,
kiddos.
An hour into
"Looking ..I grew wor
ried that this brilliant
premise would be marred
by an unnecessarily drawn
out climax. Boy, was I
wrong. The film ends on
such a bizarrely abrupt, un
fulfilling and downright de
pressing note that I couldn't
believe it was the actual con
clusion. Maybe the blank
screen was really just an in
termission? Maybe it'll be
resolved in the sequel:
"Looking for Anything In
teresting in the Canadian

World?" Or, maybe the real
Albert Brooks had just four weeks to make this
movie and ran out of time to shoot an actual end
ing. Who knows?
Even fora fish-out-water flick, this movie's
one flounder you oughtta throw back.


Al, baby, why you gotta do this to
me?
