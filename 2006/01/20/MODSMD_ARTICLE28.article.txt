# The 						State of the Union-mission
## the 						State of Horror Movies: We need new trends 
### RYAN LAMPE INTERMISSION CHAINSAW 
Eli Roth and Quentin
Tarantino were watching
horror movies at the"Pulp
Fiction" director's house
when Roth pitched his
idea fora movie about

the gruesome fate of two American backpackers in
Eastern Europe. Upon hearing the pitch, Tarantino
replied, "Are you fucking kidding me? That's the
sickest fucking idea I have ever heard. Eli. you've got
to do that."
Roth wrote, shot and edited the movie in the 12
months that followed. Released earlier this month,
"Hostel" was the number one film at the U.S. box of
fice, replicating the success of "Saw 2" late last year.
Unlike the recent spate of Japanese-inspired hor

ror films like "The Grudge" and"The

Ring 2," "Saw 2" and "Hostel" feature
some intensely graphic sequences. In
"Saw 2," one character is tossed into
a vat of syringes while another is
forced to remove his eye with a
scalpel in order to survive certain
death. In "Hostel," characters are tor
tured with drills, blowtorches, clippers
and (of course) chain saws.

In her review of "High Tension," an

other extremely gruesome horror film,
"New York Times" film critic Manohla

Dargis writes that "the return to such ex
treme horror is a natural consequence of
the 'Scream' movies." I agree. "Scream," a

self-conscious horror-thriller, was a great idea.

But its particular combination of self-referential

humor and plot twists couldn't sustain the myriad

clones it inspired. The heightened gore

of "Saw," "High Tension" and "Hos-

Tel" is a reaction to the formula los

ing its appeal.

This is a familiar pattern
in the recent history of horror

films. One landmark horror
film arrives; its formula is re

peated in a handful of se

quels and clones; the for

mula ceases to work; a
new landmark film ar
rives. "Halloween" was
. a huge hit in 1978. But
after numerous sequels
and "Friday the 13th"

movies, the concept of a

masked killer dispatching

hapless teens became tire

some. "A Nightmare on Elm Street," arguably the
best horror film of the 1980s, had a terrifically imagi
native premise. But its effectiveness was quickly di
luted by a series of increasingly inferior sequels that
made way for the "Scream" franchise to take over.
One could argue that the current state of horror
films, with their excessive brutality, is disturbing. But
it's worth noting that these films aren't entirely brain
less. "Hostel's" closing sequence, in which the film's
lead is given the chance to exact bloody vengeance, is
eerily subversive. And the premise of "Saw," a vi

cious psychopath testing his victims' will to live, is
a clever one.

Regardless, audiences will soon tire of

watching the type of violence depicted in
"Hostel" and "Saw." I sense anew breed of

horror movies is not far off. Perhaps a

breed that remembers its goal: to scare
the audience.
