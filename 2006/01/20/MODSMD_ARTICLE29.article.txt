# The
						State of Hollywood: Shut up
## 
### VICTOR FUSTÃ‰ INTERMISSION CELEBRITY 
During the 2004 presidential
[ election, Hollywood celebrities
112 stuck their noses where they didn't
belong. Famous bimbos like Jessi
ca Simpson and Britney Spears
used their monumental minds to
support the candidate they relat
ed to intellectually. Rapper
and occasional stage actor
Diddy even threatened to kill me
if I didn't vote. Hollywood was out
to change the world by telling peo-

c j - c? i
pie on which side of the political
spectrum they should be.
This fad of celebrities trying to
influence the public's views on
politics may seem to somealtruis-

tic and even beneficial to the fabric
of American politics to some, but it is
not. While movies like George

Gooney's "Syriana" and Michael
Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11" may

point out the stupidity, corruption
and deceptions of our elected offi
cials, the films' claims to unbiased
viewpoints are disingenuous and

rnisleading. Political information is presented as
fact. Though there are exceptioas, these people
can be just as misinformed about issues as anyone.
Now, before the folks at "The Review" start tout
ing me as their new Messiah, I am not saying that I
disagree with the message that these movies pro
mote. Politicians are greedy, underhanded crooks
who let their financial interests make their deci
sions for them rather than listening to the will of
the American people.
I am merely saying that I do not condone
celebrities shallowly supporting a politician in
stead of putting their names behind a certain issue.
Knee-jerk reactions like the "Vote or Die!" cam
paign do not promote informed debate about key
issues like education, social security, campaign fi
nancing, military spending or even the war in Iraq.
Instead this encourages voters to vote blindly
based on what they heard in a magazine.
That is not the role of an actor. Let the public
make up its own damn mind.
Granted, some celebrities like Angelina Jolie use
their status to benefit mankind. She, and others
like her who have joined in the campaign against
worldwide poverty and hunger, use their celebrity
to raise awareness of subjects that are crucial to the
survival of many in need.
It may turn out that raising awareness of pover
ty may also be a fad, which is unfortunate and

hopefully not the case, but the
long-term benefits of exposing

the plight of thousands

dying in third world

countries far out
weighs convincing

the public to
vote fora cer-

tain candidate.
I know I

would be de
luding myself
wishing that
celebrities
would keep
their raisin-]
formed opin-

ions to them
selves in 2008. It
will not happen.

r r
My only hope is
that people realize

that celebrities are
only people, often-

times just as clueless
as the guy who
thinks Saddam had
WMDs.
