# Health experts prepare for avian flu
## Officials take measures to prevent possible pandemic 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
A deadly virus has spread like wild fire
through the bird flocks of Asia and Cen
tral Europe.The 115N1 strain of influenza,
also known as Killer Flu, has claimed at

least 58 lives and threatens to mutate into
a pathogen that could spread from human
to human, kill millions and wreak havoc
on the global economy.
A panel of six Stanford health experts
discussed preparation fora pandemic, of
fered advice for individuals hoping to min
imize their risk and debated how great a
threat avian flu could be after the screen
ing of a PBS documentary in Fairchild Au
ditorium last night.

Hie presentation took an alarmist tone
at points.
"We were not prepared for Sept. 11; we
were not prepared for Hurricane Katrina;
so will we be prepared for Avian Flu?"
asked narrator Bill Moyers in the opening
sequence of a one-hour documentary pro
duced by PBS' Wide Angle Productions.
The documentary told the storv of the ef-
forts made by the American and
Vietnamese governments to limit the
transmission of avian flu.
"The general consensus among
scientists who are studying this is that
it is not a matter of if a pandemic will
happen, but when," said panel mod
erator Microbiology and Immunolo
gy Prof. Lucy Tompkins, after the
documentary.
When asked to offer an estimate
of how many could be infected,
Tompkins told the audience that an
outbreak could compare to the 1918
bird flu that killed more than 20 mil
lion people across the world, a num
ber greater than total dead from
shots fired in World War One.
Representatives of the University
and the Hospital said that precau
tions and preparations are made for
every kind of possible emergency, in
cluding the Killer Flu.
"The University is really trying to
prepare both to take care of their
own students if necessary but also to
see if or how the University could
take care of the community," Tomp
kins said.
"We have to prepare for every
thing," said Eric Weiss, chairman of
the Emergency and Disaster Com
mittee as well as the Bioterrorism
Task Force.
"The problem with disaster plan
ning is surge capability," he said.
Even without a tragedy or flu epi
demic, there are no unoccupied beds
available at the Hospital at this time.
The Hospital works to create the
ability to ramp up in case of emer
gency by accumulating beds, ventila
tors and other equipment people

would need in the case of an out
break, he added.
"We know what our total capacity
for ventilators is in this hospital,"
Tompkins said. "We could only cover
a miniscule amount of people who
might need those ventilators."
"(We are trying to develop] a new
triage system which allows us to take
care of the sickest patients and those
who have the highest chance of sur
vival," Weiss added.
"(Hospital representatives] are
on a number of committees that
look at planning fora pandemic,"
said Sasha Madison, the manager of
the Infection Control and Epidemi
ology Department at Stanford Hos
pital.
The hospitals have been working
with Santa Clara and San Mateo
County health officials to prepare
educational materials and hotlines
for the public in the immediate after
math of an outbreak.
Weiss told The Daily after the
event that county and state planning
is still in the "early stages." He re
cently participated in a county-wide
table top exercise. The county would
use an ice-skating rink as a makeshift
morgue, he noted.
He worried that health care work
ers might not report to work if wide
spread infection does occur. In
Toronto, he said, many health care
workers stayed home during the
SARS epidemic.
"My job is to educate [hospital
workers] so they can properly pro
tect themselves from the spread of
infectious diseases," he said. "If we
do this, we will ensure that they will

come into work."
Separation, isolation and quaran
tine would be important in case of a
serious pandemic, the panel mem
bers said.
"If people start getting the flu,
they need to separate themselves
from large groups of people," said In
fection Control Nurse Pat Ruther
ford, who discussed the formation of
neighborhood watch groups to check
on people who live alone. "We need
to think about what kinds of commu
nity resources we have that are not
going to costa lot of money."
Debra Johnson, a nurse at the In
fection Control and Epidemiology
Department at Stanford Hospital
and Clinics, implored audience
members to think about how they
would cope if there were a massive
outbreak in the Bay Area and to ex
ercise what she called "respiratory
etiquette."
"Now we have to start thinking
about what happens if we can not go
to work and kids can not go to
school," she said. "Families should
think about keeping basic medical
supplies and basic essentials."
Stanford doctors are key players
in the national effort to prepare for
an outbreak of bird flu. lliey are
seeking volunteers fora clinical
study of an experimental flu vaccine
in conjunction with the National In
stitutes of Health. The goal, they
said, is to determine the best vaccine
dose and combination of adjuvant, a
substance to enhance immunity.
Fliers were handed out to attendees,
and participants will be paid $30 for
each clinic visit.

Another concern expressed by
panelists was that younger people
are at greater risk of contracting
Killer Flu. Half of the people who
died from the 1918 pandemic were
20-to 40-years-old.The avian bird flu
in Southeast Asia has attacked vic
tims of all ages, as well.
One panelist took a contrary view
about the risk the disease poses, say
ing he was not as certain as other ex
perts.
"I do agree that this is a threat,"
said Microbiology and Immunology
Prof. Robert Siegel. "There may be
gaps in the ways governments are
thinking about intervening."
"We need to downgrade this from

a certainty into a possibility," he
added. "There are a number of other
strains that have entered the human
population, but you do not hear
about the other mutations."
Audience members said that the
panel helped them think about how
to better prepare fora possible out
break.
Husband and wife Pete and Sandi
Michel traveled 80 miles for the
event. They said they were struck by
the importance that panelists placed
on creating social distance and isola
tion to prevent the spread of the dis
ease.
"On the one hand, you could call
it alarmism," Pete Michel said. "But

on the other hand, it does not hurt to
prepare."
"Thousands of people come
through my office so I was trying to
look at the practical side of prepara
tion," added Sandi Michel, a social
worker who is concerned about the
risk of an outbreak.
Others in the audience said they
thought that public awareness cam
paigns are important to prepare for
Killer Flu.
"I am somewhat concerned about
educating the population," said
EMT Rakesh Bharania. "Without
going overboard, it is important to be
real with the problem and get past
the hype."

said Sasha Madison, the manager of
the Infection Control and Epidemi
ology Department at Stanford Hos
pital.
The hospitals have been working
with Santa Clara and San Mateo
County health officials to prepare
educational materials and hotlines
for the public in the immediate after
math of an outbreak.
Weiss told The Daily after the
event that county and state planning
is still in the "early stages." He re
cently participated in a county-wide
table top exercise. The county would
use an ice-skating rink as a makeshift
morgue, he noted.
He worried that health care work
ers might not report to work if wide
spread infection does occur. In
Toronto, he said, many health care
workers stayed home during the
SARS epidemic.
"My job is to educate [hospital
workers] so they can properly pro
tect themselves from the spread of
infectious diseases," he said. "If we
do this, we will ensure that they will

come into work."
Separation, isolation and quaran
tine would be important in case of a
serious pandemic, the panel mem
bers said.
"If people start getting the flu,
they need to separate themselves
from large groups of people," said In
fection Control Nurse Pat Ruther
ford, who discussed the formation of
neighborhood watch groups to check
on people who live alone. "We need
to think about what kinds of commu
nity resources we have that are not
going to costa lot of money."
Debra Johnson, a nurse at the In
fection Control and Epidemiology
Department at Stanford Hospital
and Clinics, implored audience
members to think about how they
would cope if there were a massive
outbreak in the Bay Area and to ex
ercise what she called "respiratory
etiquette."
"Now we have to start thinking
about what happens if we can not go
to work and kids can not go to
school," she said. "Families should
think about keeping basic medical
supplies and basic essentials."
Stanford doctors are key players
in the national effort to prepare for
an outbreak of bird flu. lliey are
seeking volunteers fora clinical
study of an experimental flu vaccine
in conjunction with the National In
stitutes of Health. The goal, they
said, is to determine the best vaccine
dose and combination of adjuvant, a
substance to enhance immunity.
Fliers were handed out to attendees,
and participants will be paid $30 for
each clinic visit.

Another concern expressed by
panelists was that younger people
are at greater risk of contracting
Killer Flu. Half of the people who
died from the 1918 pandemic were
20-to 40-years-old.The avian bird flu
in Southeast Asia has attacked vic
tims of all ages, as well.
One panelist took a contrary view
about the risk the disease poses, say
ing he was not as certain as other ex
perts.
"I do agree that this is a threat,"
said Microbiology and Immunology
Prof. Robert Siegel. "There may be
gaps in the ways governments are
thinking about intervening."
"We need to downgrade this from

a certainty into a possibility," he
added. "There are a number of other
strains that have entered the human
population, but you do not hear
about the other mutations."
Audience members said that the
panel helped them think about how
to better prepare fora possible out
break.
Husband and wife Pete and Sandi
Michel traveled 80 miles for the
event. They said they were struck by
the importance that panelists placed
on creating social distance and isola
tion to prevent the spread of the dis
ease.
"On the one hand, you could call
it alarmism," Pete Michel said. "But

on the other hand, it does not hurt to
prepare."
"Thousands of people come
through my office so I was trying to
look at the practical side of prepara
tion," added Sandi Michel, a social
worker who is concerned about the
risk of an outbreak.
Others in the audience said they
thought that public awareness cam
paigns are important to prepare for
Killer Flu.
"I am somewhat concerned about
educating the population," said
EMT Rakesh Bharania. "Without
going overboard, it is important to be
real with the problem and get past
the hype."

A panel of doctors and researchers discuss issues addressed in the PBS documentary "HSNI -Killer Flu.".
A deadly virus has spread like wild fire
through the bird flocks of Asia and Cen
tral Europe.The 115N1 strain of influenza,
also known as Killer Flu, has claimed at

least 58 lives and threatens to mutate into
a pathogen that could spread from human
to human, kill millions and wreak havoc
on the global economy.
A panel of six Stanford health experts
discussed preparation fora pandemic, of
fered advice for individuals hoping to min
imize their risk and debated how great a
threat avian flu could be after the screen
ing of a PBS documentary in Fairchild Au
ditorium last night.

Hie presentation took an alarmist tone
at points.
"We were not prepared for Sept. 11; we
were not prepared for Hurricane Katrina;
so will we be prepared for Avian Flu?"
asked narrator Bill Moyers in the opening
sequence of a one-hour documentary pro
duced by PBS' Wide Angle Productions.
The documentary told the storv of the ef-
forts made by the American and
Vietnamese governments to limit the
transmission of avian flu.
"The general consensus among
scientists who are studying this is that
it is not a matter of if a pandemic will
happen, but when," said panel mod
erator Microbiology and Immunolo
gy Prof. Lucy Tompkins, after the
documentary.
When asked to offer an estimate
of how many could be infected,
Tompkins told the audience that an
outbreak could compare to the 1918
bird flu that killed more than 20 mil
lion people across the world, a num
ber greater than total dead from
shots fired in World War One.
Representatives of the University
and the Hospital said that precau
tions and preparations are made for
every kind of possible emergency, in
cluding the Killer Flu.
"The University is really trying to
prepare both to take care of their
own students if necessary but also to
see if or how the University could
take care of the community," Tomp
kins said.
"We have to prepare for every
thing," said Eric Weiss, chairman of
the Emergency and Disaster Com
mittee as well as the Bioterrorism
Task Force.
"The problem with disaster plan
ning is surge capability," he said.
Even without a tragedy or flu epi
demic, there are no unoccupied beds
available at the Hospital at this time.
The Hospital works to create the
ability to ramp up in case of emer
gency by accumulating beds, ventila
tors and other equipment people

would need in the case of an out
break, he added.
"We know what our total capacity
for ventilators is in this hospital,"
Tompkins said. "We could only cover
a miniscule amount of people who
might need those ventilators."
"(We are trying to develop] a new
triage system which allows us to take
care of the sickest patients and those
who have the highest chance of sur
vival," Weiss added.
"(Hospital representatives] are
on a number of committees that
