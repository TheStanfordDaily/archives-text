# The 						State of Music: Pedophilia reigns
## 
### ALEXANDRAH GOVERE INTERMISSION PEDIOPHILE CATCHER 
With every new year comes a new definition of music, a new definition of who and
what is worth that $20 CD... or that million-dollar illegal downloading fee. Why are
music and musical artists ever-changing? Because as an audience changes, so must the
performer, hi order to have appeal, performers often imitate the looks, actions and in
terests of their listeners. What are today's artists imitating? In a world where numerous
people access child pornography daily, where Catholic Priests have gone insane and
where desperate Stanford boys go to Palo Alto High School for easy ass, the answer is
clear: pedophiles. So, Stanford, here are your hip-hop pedophiles:
R. Kelly
At 14, we were all so desperate for ass. The games we played — Truth or Dare, Spin
the Bottle — were, well, pathetic. Especially since we were sober. "Trapped in the

Closet," R. Kelly's recent 12-part song may not be as ingenious as the

media think. Four prepubescent words: Seven Minutes in

Heaven ... if that wasn't the 20th century equivalent

of being trapped in a closet, I don't know what is.

Could it be possible that R. Kelly is luring

\ preteens into his bedroom with all this
I talk of closets? Maybe, maybe not. But
in January 2003, Miami police found R.

Kelly in possession of 12 digital pornographic images, all of which portrayed females
under the age of 18. Oh well. What more can we expect from the man who wrote "Sex
Is On My Mind," "The Greatest Sex," "Sex Me" (parts one and two — because,
well, the first time always sucks) and "Sex in the Kitchen" ('cause sex next

to a boiling pot is hot in more ways than one.)
r>4L
You may not know who the heck D4L is, but if

you've been to a party in the past two months,
you better know about "Laffy Taffy." No,
my dear CS major, I'm not talking about
those rainbow-colored caramels you adored
as a child. I'm talking about booty, humps,

budunkadunk, straight-up ass. Nobody can taint your childhood memories of Laffy
Taffy, Chick-O-Sticks and Jolly Ranchers like D4L can. (Well, except for Johnny Depp
and his psycho-pedophile portrayal of Willy Wonka.) Point is. D4L is seducing inno
cent children with talk of colorful, sugar}' goodness. Little do they know that it sure ain't
colorful (unless we're talkin' more STDs than SAE), and it damn sure ain't sweet.
Nelly
Remember in middle school when braces were cool, and you either wanted them or
wanted the kid wearing them? In his song "Grillz," Nelly takes eighth-grade lust to a
whole new level. With his platinum teeth and a music video all about 'em, what preteens
won't wanna "take off all their clothes" in his overheated tour

bus? But don't be fooled — this isn't Nelly's first case of

musical pedophilia. Remember "Country Gram

mar?" "I'm goin' down down baby, yo' street in a
Range Rover." Lyrics stolen right out of a nursery
rhyme. It's time to open up the grill; Nelly's got a hot 1
dog to roast.
Eminem

Skinny white girls beware... particularly if your
backside resembles those of Hilary Duff, Jojo or A
the Olsen twins (all are mentioned in his single 8
"Ass Like That"). In the song, Eminem does, how- v
ever, state that "Hilary Duff is not quite old

enough." How respectable. At least he waits 'til
the big one-eight. (
Michael Jackson

Sorry Michael, 1 had to include a white guy so
as not to seem racist. Eminem doesn't quite

count.

Now, let's get this straight. Pedophilia is
bad. But with singles like "Trapped in the
Goset," "Laffy Taffy," "Grillz" and "Ass Lik<

That" blowing up the radio, it is also clear that pe
dophilia sells.
