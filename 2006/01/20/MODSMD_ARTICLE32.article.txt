## R.I.P. 'Star-Spangled Banner'; it's new national anthem time 
### LOREN NEWMAN INTERMISSION YANKEE DOODLE 
To say that the "Star-Spangled Banner" is
overplayed would be an understatement. I mean

play a song at every sporting event, Kindergarten

graduation and president's funeral and what

do you expect? Reminds me of that time in

fourth grade 1 bought The Offspring's

"Americana" album with my friends

and listened to "Pretty Fly fora

White Guy" over and over until we

all passed out in a fit of pre-pubes
cent glee.
Like all people who say things that
are vaguely un-patriotic, nobody
gloves America more than me. I
just think that celebrating this
great country of ours is better
done by music that doesn't bore me

to tears. Basically the "Battle

Hymn of the Republic" reminds me

of America about as much as Christ

mas reminds me of a brain tumor. Or is it

how much cereal reminds me of Ronald

Regan? Democracy and pontoon boats?

Dick Cheney reminds me of Jesus? Ear
muffs/wax and tartar sauce? So I've

come up with a list of songs about Amer
ica that don't betray the very freedoms
they celebrate:
Simon & Garfunkle's "America"

is a prime example. You're getting in your car with
your box of belongings ready to like, I dunno, cash in
on the American dream. What's more patriotic than
that?
Tom Petty s "American Girl." If I were a girl I
would closely identify with this song. Sort of like
everyone on facebook identifies with Holden in
"The Catcher in the Rye." I'm Holden alright, and
that's final you bunch of phonies. Plus, my friend
looks a lot like Tom Petty, and he would be really of
fended if this song didn't make the list.
The Guess Who's "American Woman." Though
it's a song about how evil American women are, per
haps a patriotic message can be found in the fact that
... American women are free to be evil. Petty's nice
"American Girl" all grown up.
Don McLean's "American Pie." I suppose that
people who are concerned with actual song lyrics
might think that this song is meaningless. But they're
wrong. There is some deeply rooted patriotic mes
sage in driving one's Chevy to a levee only to discov
er, to one's chagrin, that said levee is dry.
Jimi Hendrix's "The Star Spangled Banner
(live)." Unequivocally the best rendition of that
tired classic — so good it's actually included on the
list designed to replace it.

The Cedermont Kids' "Yankee Doodle."
Whoa, whoa... just kidding. Fora second there I though this was the 'Songs-to-drive-people-to-sui
cide-Clockwork-Orange-Style' list. But it's not, so be cool.
Ray Charles' "America The Beautiful." Have you seen "The Sandlot?" This song is all baseball
and fireworks and hotdogs. It makes you feel like you're Smalls, and for once you're not killing any
one.


Is it still a compliment to say something is as American as
apple pie?


Tom Petty looks like he just crawled out of a
swamp and someone threw a guitar on him.
