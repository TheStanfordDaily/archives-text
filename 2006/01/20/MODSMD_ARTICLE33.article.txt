### VICTOR FUSTÃ‰ INTERMISSION WORDLORD 
Every generation of young Americans has

a set number of phrases and words that
define them. Ours is no different.
Whereas 50 years ago, something might
have been "keen" or "swell," the youth of

today will describe it as "tight" 01
"sweet." These simple modifiers and
descriptors may seem innocuous, but
everyday use of these phrases and
words reaches a saturation point that
demands change. Today is that day.
The following few phrases are just
begging to die and be replaced by the
next etymological fad. Who better to
squelch the debates in the politics of
language and usher in a new age than
Intermission? No one, that's who.

Let's start simple. The word "ridiculous"
was once reserved for clowns and politi
cians. Our generation has bastardized this
word to describe anything that is difficult or
unbelievable. Example: "That test was

ridiculously difficult" or "Jack Bauer is one ridiculous mother."
Mark it on your calendar, fora new day has dawned on "ridicu
lous." By folding "ludicrous" into the cookie dough that is
"ridiculous" we achieve the chocolate chip cookie swirl of "ludi
cridous."
Next, graduate students have lived under the banner of
"sketchy" for too long. Are they poorly drawn, lacking in deter-

mined lines and shading? No! They are not drawings; they are

people (sort 0f...). Taking a page from the much more

cultured folks across the pond, the term "'sketchy" will
be replaced with "dodgy," and young folks will never

again have to live under the tyranny and oppression
of "sketchy."
Like "ridiculous" and "sketchy" before it, the
phrase "I'm not gonna lie, but..." has run its course.

If you weren't going to lie, you wouldn't have to say
that, would you?! It undermines all authority you have

on a subject and will ultimately make you look like a liar. The

Intermission solution phrase? "I'll be honest." These three

simple words (four if you're opposed to contractions) convey
your honesty and will make you popular with the ladies.

Finally, in an age in which paranoia is more
prevalent than prostitutes, the following few
phrases have been beaten to death so many times
that they are now just bloody pulps of words. The

words and names "liberty,"
"freedom," "terrorists,"
"America," "Saddam Hus
sein" and "A1 Qaeda" have
been vomited by politicians,
both conservative and liberal,
at the American people re
lentlessly in the last few years.
We here at Intermission are
so sick of these canned polit
ical phrases that we humbly

suggest these changes in national
rhetoric:
"liberty" = fun time
"freedom" = running in tulip fields

with puppies
"terrorists" = shmucks with sand in their shorts
"America" = Halliburtonia (or any other corporate sponsor
who pays top dollar) Examples: Microsoft-stan or Coca-Cola
land.
"Saddam Hussein" = Uncle Saddie
"A1 Qaeda" = The new South
So the next time you find yourself resorting to these phrases,
or if you think that a phrase is overdone Just make up your own
phrase or use one of ours and hope it catches on.


Saddam sees you. Yes, you with the
pencil. You can't hide.
