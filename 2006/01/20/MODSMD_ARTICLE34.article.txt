## Roxy explores the state of fun 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS, RESOLUTION BREAKER 
My fellow Stanfordians, as
we commence this wondrous
New Year, you have undoubt
edly pledged to uphold your
2006 resolutions. As adorable
as that is, Roxy thinks you
should forget about them now
instead of wasting your time.
No you're not going to get rich,
no you will not snag one half of
Brangelina (they're having a
kid together — you don't need
the extra responsibility) and
that new workout routine was
over as soon as it interfered

with your party schedule. Instead, Roxy has a
resolution for 2006 that everyone should
make: Get more F's.
No people, I'm not talking about grades, al
though if we were being graded on fun, every
body but Roxy Sass would get an F! Honestly,
let's face it — with everything else going on in
our lives, sometimes it seems like there's no
time for fun — which is precisely why 2006
should be the year you pledge to have fun. Yes
folks, and here at Stanford, the state of enter
tainment boils down to the three F's: Frats,

Facebook and Fucking . . . problem sets, of
course. (Roxy does realize you may not be able
to let go of your resolutions quite yet.)
Frats are undoubtedly the staple of our
party diet. They are the places where you meet
the people in your classes and some people
you know only from your Facebook stalking.
It's where everybody comes to loosen up,
dance and hopefully go home with a hottie.
Actually, it doesn't even have to be a hottie —
Roxy knows everybody looks better when the
lights are off and the beer goggles are on.

No wait, I take that back. It's NEVER ok to
hook up with a Fugly person — that is defi
nitely one F you want to avoid.
Anyway, let's talk about Facebook now.
Everywhere else, Myspace has quickly be
come the new way to make and break rela
tionships. Roxy is saddened by how she is no
longer asked for her digits anymore; it's more
like: Hey do you have a Myspace? How easy
do you think Roxy Sass is? Just giving away
personal information like that? However,
Facebook still is the best way to get to know

someone without ever actually speaking to
him or her. Because Roxy knows you have
something other than talking on your mind.
Facebook provides valuable information you
can use fora pickup line, like, "Hey aren't you
that girl in the Menage a Trois Facebook
group?"
Roxy also condones the brand new photo
feature that allows you to see people's other
pictures so that you know for sure whether
they're hot or just chose a great picture. Now
that's a handy little tool that Roxy knows will

help censor potentials.
Last but not least
we're on to those Fucking
problem sets. No my techie
friend, problem sets do not
count as fun. For 2006 I want
you to take those problem
sets, burn 'em and find your
self a nice little study buddy.
Of course by study buddy, I
mean someone who will get it
on with you in the stacks.
How do you get said study
buddy? You can find that lit
tle hottie on Facebook and
then "meet" him/ her at a
Frat party. Now that, my
friends, is what Roxy calls re
sourcefulness.
