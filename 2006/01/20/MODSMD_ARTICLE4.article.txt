### CHRISTIAN L. TOM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Perceptions of policy," said two-time journal
ism Emmy-nominee I -awrence Pintak,"can be as
important as the policy itself."
Pintak, the director of the Adham Center for
Electronic Journalism at The American Universi
ty in Cairo, spoke to an audience of approximate
ly 50 to 60 students and community members in
Building 420 Thursday night.
Pintak's speech, entitled "America, Islam and
the War of Ideas," was co-sponsored bv the Coali

Student Awareness Network (MSAN) and the
ASSU Speakers Bureau.
Pintak began his presentation with the Steve
Earle song "John Walker's Blues," written about
the so-called "American Taliban" John Walker

from American radio.
"Even this misguided take was banned from
U.S. airwaves," Pintak said.

One of his main points was'
that, "We all have a different
world view. We are all shaped
by our culture."
Pintak showed a series of
political cartoons — from
both the U.S. and the Middle
East — to demonstrate his
point: "It's all a matter of per

He also discussed a key

"the largest wellspring of sympathy in the Muslim
world in recent history." He compared that senti
ment to today, when our favorabilitv rating in
countries such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt has fall
en to only 2 and 4 percent, respectively.
" Iliere is an essential disconnect between 9/11
and where we are today in how Americans view
the world in terms of communication, perception,
and perspective," Pintak said.
"After 9/11," he added."We descended into an
us' versus them' dichotomy. Islam was there to
