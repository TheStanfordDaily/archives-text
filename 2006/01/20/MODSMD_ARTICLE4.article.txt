# A 						War of Ideas
## JOURNALIST SPEAKS ON WORLD PERCEPTIONS OF U.S. 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Perceptions of policy," said two-time journal
ism Emmy-nominee I -awrence Pintak,"can be as
important as the policy itself."
Pintak, the director of the Adham Center for
Electronic Journalism at The American Universi
ty in Cairo, spoke to an audience of approximate
ly 50 to 60 students and community members in
Building 420 Thursday night.
Pintak's speech, entitled "America, Islam and
the War of Ideas," was co-sponsored bv the Coali
tion for Justice in the Middle East, the Muslim
Student Awareness Network (MSAN) and the
ASSU Speakers Bureau.
Pintak began his presentation with the Steve
Earle song "John Walker's Blues," written about
the so-called "American Taliban" John Walker
Lindh. Pintak conducted a survey with the audi
ence and explained the reason many people had
never heard the song was because it was banned
from American radio.
"Even this misguided take was banned from
U.S. airwaves," Pintak said.

One of his main points was'
that, "We all have a different
world view. We are all shaped
by our culture."
Pintak showed a series of
political cartoons — from
both the U.S. and the Middle
East — to demonstrate his
point: "It's all a matter of per
spective."

He also discussed a key
change from Sept. 11 when the United States had,
"the largest wellspring of sympathy in the Muslim
world in recent history." He compared that senti
ment to today, when our favorabilitv rating in
countries such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt has fall
en to only 2 and 4 percent, respectively.
" Iliere is an essential disconnect between 9/11
and where we are today in how Americans view
the world in terms of communication, perception,
and perspective," Pintak said.
"After 9/11," he added."We descended into an
us' versus them' dichotomy. Islam was there to


PINTAK
replace the Soviets. Stereotypes be
came the frame of reference."
This was caused by media cover
age in both the United States and
abroad. Pintak said that "absolutist"
rhetoric was used on the part of both
the American and Middle Eastern
media.
"Where Americans asked, 'How
can they d 0...' Arabs asked, 'Can't
they understand why we d 0..."'
Pintak used the example of the
toppling of a Saddam Hussein statue
in Baghdad. Arab media printed a
photo of U.S. soldiers ripping down
the statue, while the widely-circulat
ed American photo showed the tum
bling statue framed alone. One per
spective supported a view of U.S. col
onization; the other simply portrayed
the overthrow of a tyrant.
"Now which one," Pintak asked
rhetorically, "is truth with a capital
>T'? We saw a completely different
version of reality than what was seen
in the Arab world."
Pintak outlined the way in which
Americans compare "what we do"
versus "what they are." Pintak
pointed to John Winthrop's popular
1630 "City on the Hill" viewpoint.
He connected this self-justifying
American attitude to the current
popular notion that, "individuals
may make mistakes, but not our so
ciety," while at the same time main
taining that "others intrinsically are
flawed."
This is a double standard, which
Pintak said packs powerful policy im
plications.
"The U.S. can no longer say one
thing and do another, can no longer
speak only to the domestic con
stituency," he said. "The U.S. must
carefully view — in advance — each
statement and action through the op
posing prism."
After the 45 minute presentation,
Pintak fielded questions from the au
dience. When asked if he thought the
current administration was making
progress, Pintak replied that he sees
at least a "glimmer of hope."

He also advised, "Educate your
self. Don't just read The New York
Times; read the news from Beirut,
from Jakarta. Educate yourself and
get others to educate themselves."
"An image in the news which is in
nocuous to us," Pintak said. "May to
others be an absolute confirmation
that [the Iraq War] is a war of Mus
lims versus Christians."
Reactions to Pintak's speech were
positive.
"It was a really successful event,"
said sophomore Sanah Parvez, an
MSAN member in attendance. "The
amount of people that attended
shows that our community is really
receptive to Muslim issues. We are
lucky to be at a place like Stanford."
"The talk was very informative,"
said Chang-Yeon Kom, who said he
was unsure what to expect at the talk,
but added,"Now I wonder what root
causes and other perceptions there
are other than our own media bias
and propaganda."
"It was nice to see a different per
spective," said sophomore Anissa
Kanoun, MSAN treasurer. "Pintak
was a very engaging speaker."
"We had a diverse audience,"
added junior Omar Shakir. MSAN
president. "The talk was good for
those without much experience to
the Muslim world. It was a great in
troduction to the main issues; I hope
it inspires people to learn more about
the Arab-Muslim world."
Audience member Hiam Hindi
concurred.
"Pintak spoke on relevant topics.
It was interesting to see the compari
son between the U.S. and the Middle
East," she said.
Audience members were able to
purchase advance copies of Pintak's
new book, "Reflections in a Blood
shot Lens: America, Islam and the
War of Ideas," to be released Feb. 15,
2006.
Pintak has delivered speeches at
USC and UC-davis this week and will
travel to Washington. D.C. next week
to visit the Naval Academy and the
State Department.
"The more people who are ex
posed to ideas from other perspec
tives," Pintak said in an interview
with The Daily."The better off we
are."
