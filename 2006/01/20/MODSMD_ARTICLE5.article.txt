## Employers snoop on Facebook Companies screen potential employees' Facebook profiles 
### ANDREA FULLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Though the wildly popular Facebook.com
began as a place for college students to post pic

tures and quirky interests, the site has

now become a tool for potential em

ployers, much to the chagrin of some

young job-seekers.
Director of the Career Develop
ment Center (CDC) Chov

confirmed that employers

routinely conduct Web
searches to find back

ground information on
job candidates. Compa
nies have furthered this
practice by using Face

book.
One senior who asked
to remain anonymous was

advised by an employee at

a company he was applying to a job for to untag
facebook pictures. Choy also noted that one
Stanford student had received a job offer from an
alumnus who used the site.
Choy mentioned several potential reasons
employers would choose to use Facebook to
check up on job candidates.
"Employers might be able to confirm back
ground information," he said. "Some students

write about their interests, and employers might
want to check on whether this supports their job

application. Some employers might try and
learn something about the student's personality

and whether it would be appropriate for the job
However, there is information on Facebook that
is not relevant to the job but may be used inap

propriately by employers to assess a candidate."

The use of Facebook by businesses has raised

ethical concerns for some students.
"I think the practice is just downright terri

ble," said senior Julie Lein "It places
an unnecessary burden on students
who think of Facebook as a place to
interact with friends, many times in a

humorous and crude manner. I per
sonally haven't had any employers
contact me, though I know of people
who have had comments made by in
terviewers on either their picture or
tagged pictures of them. It's unfortu
nate because I never took Facebook
seriously."
Senior Lily Cheng shared the view
that Facebook is not intended for em
ployer use.
"I see Facebook as a personal do
main, and one that should not be
used by employers to judge a stu
dent's qualifications," she said. "1
think the students should have the
freedom to decide whether his or her

Facebook site can be publicly viewed
by all. Employers should not have ac
cess to sites that are restricted to stu
dents only."
Though senior Jennifer Clark did
not share the same concerns, she said
she feels that Facebook is not the best
place for companies to evaluate job
candidates.
"1 don't think it's unethical but I
think it's stupid," she said. "How
would an employer know a good can
didate based on their Facebook pro
file? It's a bunch of random stuff you
put for your friends. It's not like a re
sume. It just seems weird. But it's def
initely not against the law and I don't
think it's unethical."
She also pointed out that students
do not have to respond to personal
interview questions if asked about
Facebook.
"If it is something 1 think is too

personal then I won't answer," she
said. "In sessions where they coach
you on interviewing they always tell
you that the employer may fish for
things they are not supposed to ask,
like your political affiliation, if you
have dependants, etc. You are always
free to explain that is a topic you'd
rather not discuss."
Though the career counselors
with whom Choy spoke had only
heard of one student receiving a job
offer through Facebook or being
asked about his or her profile, stu
dents have begun to monitor what
they put on the site.
"I have a lot of ridiculous tagged
photos from friends," Lein said."l felt
compelled to de-tag the photos over
break due to fear of employers see
ing the pictures."
Clark noted the importance of
monitoring personal information on

the Web.
"1 think if people are really wor
ried about Facebook being used
against them, they should simply
monitor what is on it," she said.
"Sometimes people get really per
sonal online where the whole world
can see and unless you are prepared
for the whole world to see it then you
should probably think twice."
Cheng agreed that students
should be responsible for managing
their profiles.
"Personally, 1 have not posted
anything on Facebook that 1 would
n't want an employer to know," she
said.
Choy said that the CDC encour
aged such caution.
"Be careful about the image you
portray in any public domain," he
said. "You don't know who could be
watching."
