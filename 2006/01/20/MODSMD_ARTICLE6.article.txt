## RCCs teach presentation skills 
### KELLEY FONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Intermediate Computing at Stanford, a com
puter class in its second year that focuses on mul
timedia and presentation skills, is now offered in
six freshman dorms, up from four last year. The
one-unit CS2C class is taught by dorm Residen
tial Computer Coordinators (RCCs).
"A lot of students come into college with more
experience with computers, so what we teach in
CSIC [including programs such as Microsoft
Word and Microsoft Excel) is not as relevant,"
said senior ChenLi Wang, coordinator of the
CS2C program."So the idea of CS2C was born to
be taught winter quarter, not exactly as a contin
uation sequence for lC,but as a level up."
"I think the primary difference (between CSIC
and CS2C] is that the focus is on presentation in
CS2C,sort of like the difference between PWR 1
and PWR 2," said Freshman/Sophomore College
RCC and CS2C instructor Nick Cheng,a junior.
"In PWR 2 especially, there's generally a
media component, which is either PowerPoint or
sometimes like editing a sound clip, or even mak
ing a short film or something like that, which is all
technology-intensive," he added.
"We're definitely working with the PWR 2
program to try and make sure that we can give
people the technical skills they need to present
things in a world where so much presentation is
digital," Cheng said.
"PWR instructors have often taken students
into media labs to have a quick intro to things like
iMovie," Wang said."Rut we thought it'd be great

if very knowledgeable people within the dorms,
the RCCs, could teach that."
Last year'scurriculum included work with Au
dacity, a sound editing program, iMovie. a video
editing program, Microsoft PowerPoint,a presen
tation-making program, and Adobe In Design, a
publishing program â€” "technologies we don't
usually cover in IC," Wang said.
Cheng emphasized that the skills taught in
CS2C are useful not just for classes like PWR 2.
"The software that we're teaching has a lot of
different applications," he said. "We try to plan
each class with a pretty big interactive compo
nent, to make sure that people get to actually play
around with the software."
According to Wang, new equipment such as
microphones and video cameras were purchased
for the CS2C program this year.These purchases
were funded by a grant to the ResComp program
from the vice provost for undergraduate educa
tion.
This year, said Wang, "we have more equip
ment ready to go from the beginning."
"We have a pretty good foundation to build
upon [this year]," he added. "And I think one of
my main roles is to make sure that this program
becomes stronger. Also, we hope to start achiev
ing this core set of curriculum and teaching mate
rials and experience, so that it becomes a more es
tablished and easier to run program in future
years."
Wang said that last year's class was a pilot pro
gram needed to gauge student interest,but that it
