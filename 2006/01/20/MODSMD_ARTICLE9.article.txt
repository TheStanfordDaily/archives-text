## Editorial Classes should stick to the right times 
### 
The shopping period at the start of each
quarter can be a heady combination
of excitement and stress. While
searching for new classes can be thrilling,
trying to fit all these classes into one's
schedule can sometimes be tricky. At times,
it may even seem as if all the classes you
want to take conflict with one another.
Scheduling conflicts are not necessarily
anyone's fault. Many arise because of de
mands between major requirements, pro
fessors' schedules and accommodating ath
letics. But there are a variety of conflicts that
could be avoided:
- Some classes meet on Mondays and Thurs
days (SOC 261B); Tuesdays, Wednesdays
and Thursdays (ENGLISH 21 ).or a similar
ly bizarre combinations of days.
- Other classes have a 15-minute overlap be
tween them, making it almost impossible to
attend both classes.given the time it takes to
bike from one class to another. Many of
these classes could easily fit into normal
times.
- A majority of classes are scheduled imme
diately before or after lunch, making it diffi
cult to find classes outside of the "prime
time" slots at 11 a.m. and 1:15 p.m.
Strange schedules can create nightmares
for many people: athletes who have more
demanding schedules are less able to ac
commodate non-standard class times: those
in requirement-laden technical majors who
have difficulty scheduling classes that satis
fy GERs. Even those in "flexible" interdisci
plinary majors may occasionally find it
tricky to register for classes across different
departments.
The University administration has noted
the problem. The Registrar's Web site clear
ly acknowledges that "students encounter
an unacceptable level of scheduling con
flicts." In response, the Registrar has offered
solutions. For instance, the Web site clearly
explains the scheduling policies and even
furnishes a list of allowable class times.
We support the Registrar's policies: not
only do they provide solutions to the prob
lem, they afford teaching staff a great deal of
flexibility. We do not see why some profes
sors choose not to abide with these policies.
After all, a single ill-timed class often throws
off an entire schedule.

We understand that professors and de
partment administrators have the preroga
tive to decide when to schedule classes, even
if it means deciding to schedule classes at
non-standard class times. However, given
the University's goals to provide a broad
based education, we believe that professors
contribute to the aims of the University by
allowing students the flexibility of attending
classes outside of their departments.
While there are clearly no easy solutions
to this problem, we can offer the following
suggestions:
- Currently, the policy is only strictly en
forced for classes that are held in classrooms
scheduled by the Registrar. In other words,
classes that are held in departmental spaces
are exempted from these recommenda
tions. We strongly suggest that all classes be
held to the same class time standards, re
gardless of where they are held. Professors
who wish to schedule classes at other times
should be required to submit a petition to
the Registrar.
- We suggest that every department be re
quired to schedule at least one popular class
at a less attractive timeslot. If each depart
ment makes it a point to schedule one class
at 9 a.m.. there will be less of a squeeze in the
popular 11 a.m. timeslot.
Lack of attendance is not a serious con
cern as students are likely to attend a class
they are interested in regardless of the time.
Seminars with mandatory participation can
also be scheduled earlier in the morning or
later in the evening.
Perennial favorites like Prof. William
Dement's Sleep and Dreams can easily be
scheduled at 9 a.m. without taking a serious
dent in its popularity (students sleep
through it anyway). For example. Richard
Powers' social dance classes routinely re
quire their devotees to get up in time for
class at K:45 a.m.
- Most departments do a pretty good job of
minimizing conflicts between classes within
the department. But departments should
strive to be less parochial in their thinking
and make it easier for students to explore
classes outside the department. By doing so,
departments and the University as a whole
could make a stronger statement about the
value of interdisciplinary education.
