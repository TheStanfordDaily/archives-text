Timothy Zerlang can
move 2.5 tons of bronze
with one strike of his fist.
But he is no modern-day
Hercules. He's the man
who plays the bells on the
top of Hoover Tower.
Zerlang first heard the bells
when he was a first-year graduate
student at Stanford in 1983. Now,
he's a professor in the Music De
partment.
"1 lived in a dorm room in
Crothers, at the very foot of the
Tower, and could hear them playing
all day,"he says. "So I became inter
ested in learning to play."
He eventually began taking les
sons from James Angell, who was
the carillonneur — another name
for bell player — at the time.
"It wasn't too hard to learn,"
Zerlang says. "1 had majored in
music as an undergraduate and al
ready played the piano and the
organ, which are similar instru
ments to this."
However, it still took him six
years to earn the title of carillon
neur at Stanford. In 1989, he went to
the conference for the Guild of Car
illonneurs of North America to ob
tain the title.
To become carillonneurs, candi
dates must learn three bell pieces by
heart and play one for the guild
members, who wait to tell the aspir
ing carillonneurs which piece to
play after they take the elevator to
the bell tower for their perform
ance. Afterward, they vote on
whether or not the carillonneur
title-seekers should be inducted.
Zerlang passed the test and took
over Angell's position in 1990.
His next challenge was to play
the old, outdated carillon — the of
ficial name of the bells — that were
first built for the Belgian Pavilion in
the 1939 World's Fair, held in New
York City.
Following the fair, Stanford
alumnus and former U.S. President
1 lerbert Hoover bought the bells for
the Hoover Institution. He put the
bells at the top of his tower name
sake in a glass room originally

meant to be a reading room. Hoover
told his architects of the change in
plans midway through the construc
tion.
But the bells suffered significant
damage in the 1989 Loma Prieta
Earthquake, requiring the university
to ship the bells to Holland in 2000,
where parts were replaced or re
paired. The refurbished bells were
replaced in 2002.
"We used to have 35 bells and now
we have 48, although only 13 of those
are from the original collection." Zer
lang explains. "The bells range in size
from 18 to S,(XK) pounds."
Zerlang plays the carillon with a

"baton keyboard" — each bell has a
wire attached to its clapper, which is
then attached to the end of the ba
tons. The batons look like two rows
of square, wooden rolling pins stick
ing out of the instrument's frame. To
play a particular note, he hits the end
of a baton with his fist, and a rich,
long note pours forth.
"I can play all of tne octaves with
my hands, but I can also play the
lower two octaves with my feet," he
says, pointing to a row of foot pedals.
"It's convenient, because sometimes
my hands are too busy to play every
thing at once."
Zerlang notes that most modern
day carillons are played with elec
tronic keyboards, much like an
organ.
"Most carillonneurs prefer this
because baton keyboards take con
siderably more effort to play," he

says."The batons are hard to push,
and you don't get any mechanical as
sistance."
But Zerlang says he enjoys Stan
ford's old-fashioned carillon., having
played other carillons across the na
tion, including one at the National
Cathedral in Washington, D.C. He
has even played all the carillons in
California, including the Garden
Grove.
"The Garden Grove carillon is
right next to Disneyland," Zerlang
says. "You can see the Matterhorn
ride from the bell tower!"
Zerlang can play a wide variety of
songs on the bells. A small bookcase
in his office holds the sheet music,
ranging from Mozart to video-game
themes.
"A few years ago, one of my grad
uating piano students found carillon
music for the theme from Super

Mario Brothers and asked if I would
play it for Senior Commencement,"
Zerlang says."I was happy to."
Zerlang also remembers one
crazy Halloween night in his days as
a student when he and some friends
snuck up to the top of the bell tower
and serenaded the campus with
songs befitting the holiday.
"We played lots of silly things,
like 'Casper the Friendly Ghost' and
TV themes from 'The Addams Fam
ily' and *TTie Munsters'," he says.
Zerlang plays the bells on a pure
ly volunteer basis, usually perform
ing for Hoover Institute Board of
Overseers. Freshman Convocation,
Senior Commencement and when
prestigious visitors come to campus.
He also tries to play for 45 minutes
every week to share bell music for
the enjoyment of Farm regulars.
"When I play every week depends

on my schedule," Zerlang explains.
"Last quarter it was Wednesday
evenings, which I hope to continue."
He does not play when other vis
itors are on the observation deck of
the tower because it's possible that
their hearing could be damaged.
"It's really not that bad — I don't
even wear earplugs when I'm up
here," he says. "But there is no escap
ing from the loud notes of the bells,
since the entire instrument is on one
floor."
There is one person, however,
who's allowed to watch him play up
close — a freshman who Zerlang is
tutoring in the arts of carillon.
"Hopefully, he can take over
from me in the future," Zerlang says.
"But I am willing to play as long as I
stay on the campus. I love playing the
carillon — it is one of my biggest
hobbies."
