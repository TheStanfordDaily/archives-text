Timothy Zerlang can
move 2.5 tons of bronze
with one strike of his fist.
But he is no modern-day
Hercules. He's the man
who plays the bells on the
top of Hoover Tower.
Zerlang first heard the bells
when he was a first-year graduate
student at Stanford in 1983. Now,
he's a professor in the Music De
partment.
"1 lived in a dorm room in
Crothers, at the very foot of the
Tower, and could hear them playing
all day,"he says. "So I became inter
ested in learning to play."
He eventually began taking les
sons from James Angell, who was
the carillonneur — another name
for bell player — at the time.
"It wasn't too hard to learn,"
Zerlang says. "1 had majored in
music as an undergraduate and al
ready played the piano and the
organ, which are similar instru
ments to this."
However, it still took him six
years to earn the title of carillon
neur at Stanford. In 1989, he went to
the conference for the Guild of Car
illonneurs of North America to ob
tain the title.
To become carillonneurs, candi
dates must learn three bell pieces by
heart and play one for the guild
members, who wait to tell the aspir
ing carillonneurs which piece to
play after they take the elevator to
the bell tower for their perform
ance. Afterward, they vote on
whether or not the carillonneur
title-seekers should be inducted.
Zerlang passed the test and took
over Angell's position in 1990.
His next challenge was to play
the old, outdated carillon — the of
ficial name of the bells — that were
first built for the Belgian Pavilion in
the 1939 World's Fair, held in New
York City.
Following the fair, Stanford
alumnus and former U.S. President
1 lerbert Hoover bought the bells for
the Hoover Institution. He put the
bells at the top of his tower name
sake in a glass room originally
