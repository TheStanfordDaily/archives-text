# Time to get HITCHED, bitch
## 
### 
A funny thing happened to two of my best child
hood girlfriends over winter break. They got
engaged. Engaged! Like with a ring. And a
guy. Forever.
Let me say first that 1 am super happy for them
(congratulationsJanay and Michelle). And let me say
secondly that 1 cannot figure out how my friends man
aged to find the man with whom they want to spend
the rest of their lives when 1 can't commit to one brand
of sugar-free chai for more than two weeks.
Now maybe comparing the search for the perfect
spouse to the search for the perfect warm beverage
isn't fair, but then again, dating is kind of like food
shopping, right? You need to have some idea of what
you're looking for. You have to compare different
types of products (For some reason. I have a very
strong urge to start talking about bananas right now).
In any case, it appears that we need to start putting
a little more thought into both our chai preferences
and our love lives if we want to avoid the tragic but in
evitable situation of turning twenty-two without
knowing what we are drinking or who we are sleeping
with. Granted, for me this situation is simply called
"Friday night," but I acknowledge that at some point
it is necessary to move on to bigger and better things.
Thus I have compiled "The Stanford Single Guide to
Getting Engaged" for your reading pleasure:
Step LThe Ring. This is by far the most important
part of getting engaged. If you are female, I would
suggest spending no less than ten hours a week perus
ing theTiffany.com website. They have this program
where you can create your ideal ring, and you need
plenty of time to check out all your options. If you
don't think you can make that kind of time commit
ment. try pitching the activity as a directed reading to
the Feminist Studies department so you can get aca
demic credit for your research. If you are a guy. put
down this newspaper this very instant and go get a job.
1 don't care if you already have one-go get another
one. Do you have any idea how much a diamond ring
costs these days? Let's see ... I'm just going to pick
one at random here ... ah. yes ... the Heart-Shaped
Fancy Diamond Engagement Ring starts at $4,690.
And I want it in platinum.
Step 2:The Fiance. Although significantly less im
portant than identifying the correct ring, it's probably
a good idea to find the right life partner as well. Ac
cording to Google Translator, the word "fiance"
means "be engaged" in French, so it's helpful to make
sure that your fiance is someone who is willing to be
engaged to you. or at least doesn't put up much of a
fight when you bring up the topic. For this reason, the
following people tend to be excellent fiances: the eld
erly. small children, drunks, the drunk elderly, elderly
children, small drunks, and ugly people. I would rec
ommend going with one of the first six options.
Step 3:The Proposal. If you have ever seen a chick
flick you may think that proposals are romantic, cre
ative, and often public confessions of love and com
mitment. This is bullshit. Proposals are legally bind
ing contracts invented for the sole purpose of ensur
ing that your "loved one" cannot hook up with anyone
else without severe social consequences such as cas
tration. For this reason, forget the whole "romantic
dinner and walk on the beach" proposal-it is far more
practical to plan a "corporate conference room filled
with lawyers and large men named Vinny" proposal.
Then you can sign the pre-nuptial agreement on the
spot, so that if anything happens to your endless love,
well, at least you'll get to keep the ring.

Marie is also considering the Marquise-Shaped Fancy
Diamond Engagement Ring. Comment on this article at
