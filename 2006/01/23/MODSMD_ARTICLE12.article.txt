# From fantasy to reality: In the studio with The Spins
## 
### MARIE CHRISTINE CANNIZZARO 
BERKELEY. Calif. — From the
parking lot, the stone-covered complex at
26(K)Tenth St. does not seem like the kind
of place where rock legends are horn. But
the lobby behind the double glass doors
paints a different picture: platinum
records decorate the reception area like
metallic wallpaper, and posters of every
one from En Vogue to Journey grace the
hallways. Here, people feel as though
they are walking on hallowed ground.
Here people understand why they call it
Fantasy Studios.
But it is Saturday morning, and fre
quent guests like Aerosmith and Chris
Isaak are nowhere to be found. The same
minimalist sofas used by U2 are current
ly occupied by four denim-clad college
students, some of them sleeping, all of
them exhausted. They are Stanford Uni
versity seniors — they are The Spins.
And they are about to record and mix
their music in the same place that San
tana created "Supernatural."
A sound: David Baron, 21, strums a

m
few chords from "December" on a newly
restrung acoustic guitar. With neat
blonde hair and a collared shirt, only the
bottle of Jack Daniels at his feet betrays
his burgeoning rock star status. His
greenish eyes focus intently as he alter
nates between up- and up-and-down
strokes, listening for the difference be
tween the techniques
"What about that?" he asks the others.
"I think it sounds like snow falling."
They are slow to respond. "I can't tell
a difference with my eyes closed." replies
Gabe Davis, 21. sprawled face down on
the couch. Jack Conte. 21, nods his agree
ment from behind a sweatshirt hood ob
scuring his face. Davis had a jazz gig in
San Francisco the night before that ran
late; Conte awoke at 6:30 a.m. fora Stan
ford Improvisers activity
Ben Grant. 22, says nothing while
drumming his hands against his thighs.
Like Baron, he exudes a deceptive whole
someness, but Grant possesses no calm
facade. The studio's chief engineer
Stephen Hart is not in.and the security
guard does not know when he'll arrive.
Without Hart. The Spins can do nothing

*
but wait.
It is an activity to which the hand is ac
customed. In some ways they waited over
three years for this opportunity. The origi
nal members —Baron on piano and vo
cals, Davis on bass and Grant on drums —
formed the piano-pop-rock group their
freshman year under the name The David
Baron Element.Ttoo "Battle of the Bands"
championships, three name changes and
hundreds of on and off-campus gigs later.
The Spins added Conte on keyboard and
contacted guitarist Diego Picetti. 27, of
Sunnyvale (Picetti was not a part of the
album production process). By Oct. 2005.
they were finally prepared to woo a big
time producer,and Hart fit the bill.
Unfortunately Hart's bill — at more
than $20.(HM) an album — could newt lit
The Spins, and the twenty-somethings re
alized they needed cither a lottery win or
a miracle in order to earn the Midas
touch on their masterpiece. They got the
miracle: Hart's teenage son raved about
The Spins' demos, and upon closer in
spection, the recording veteran realized
the band possessed an intelligence diffi
cult to find in a new group that writes

their own music. He chose to accommo
date their modest budget, a risky move
that boosted the band's confidence expo
nentially.
Ah. 1 lart. Magi-like he approaches the
musicians, bearing gifts of ginger ale and
roast chicken. Suddenly, everyone is
awake.
"Stephen!"
"Hey. Stephen! 1 low are you?"
"What have you been up to?"
"Getting reamed," he replies dryly.
Everyone laughs. Hart is of moderate
stature, with glasses that sit on the end of
his nose and a vague resemblance to Paul
McCartney The Spins call him "the pro
fessor" for reasons that cannot be printed
in a family newspaper.
Iliey quickly navigate labyrinthine
hallways to the red door of Studio A.the
same studio where Green Day recorded
"Dookie."The space is extensive, and in
cludes a kitchenette,a lounge, a recording
facility and a control room dominated by
a colossal mixing board.
"Some of those buttons probably

haven't been touched in a very long
time," Grant notes, eyeing the board.
"Maybe you should roll around
on the table like a beached whale and
touch 'em all," Davis offers. Grant
declines.
The schedule for today is decep
tively simple: record a few percus
sion, guitar and vocal tracks and then
mix "December." But "December" is
a particularly complex piece, requir
ing over 50 vocal and instrumental
tracks to create the unique sound
that has come to define The Spins. It
is a sound better described by what it
is not than what it is — piano-rock,
but significantly more upbeat than
Coldplay. Funky, but less stylized
than Maroon 5. Pop-y,but free of the
gag-inducing insipidity that plagued
the boy bands of the nineties.
The Spins have high hopes for
their self-titled album, which they
plan to distribute to record labels,
venue booking managers and friends
(some tracks will also be available on
their Web site, http://www.thespins
band.com). They unanimously agree
that "Tell Her Something" is the
most single-friendly track on the
album, the track that may allow them
to secure a recording deal and break
into the mainstream. But they all
have a soft spot for "December," if

only because it is their most ambi
tious technical undertaking.
As Grant heads to the sound
proof studio to record a tambourine
track, Hart fiddles with the computer
near the mixing board. Every record
ed sound sends EKCJ-like images to
the monitor, allowing the user to
play, copy, cut and paste sound clips
with a click of a button.This is Hart's
canvas — but The Spins need to sup
ply the paint. A few more taps on the
keyboard and he's ready to begin.
"You all set?" Hart asks through
the intercom.
Grant nods.
Silence. Then, music. Grant furi
ously shakes the tambourine.
Now it's bye, baby, bye, sing me one
last lullaby...
After a few seconds the clip is si
lenced and then played again so
Grant can record the same track. To
the average listener's ear, the tracks
sound nearly identical, but to discern
ing musicians, even the slightest
change of tempo is cause for discus
sion.
Now it's bye, baby, bye, sing me
one last lullaby ...
Now it's bye, baby, bye, sing me one
last lullaby...
"/ felt like it was a little sloppy on
the last part," Conte says. "Can you do

it one more timer
Now it's bye. baby, bye. sing me
one last lullaby ...
Finally, Davis draws an obscene
picture with the caption "We Have a
Winner!" on a piece of paper and
holds it up so Grant can see that it is
time for him to leave the soundproof
recording area. It took over half an
hour to record and polish the tam
bourine track, but the finished prod
uct comprises less than ten seconds
of the song.
"Boys, progress has been made,"
Hart sighs.
Next. Baron heads into the sound
proof studio fora guitar track, and
later records a series of background
vocal tracks. The process is painstak
ing, infuriating, laborious and largely
unsatisfying. By the time the tracks
are finished, several hours have
passed and the only thing the band
has to show for their efforts is a mass
of nonsensical recordings and a
pounding headache.
Finally, it is time to mix.
Hart disappears and then returns
a few minutes later with 10 unscent
ed candles (where did he find
them?), which he delicately places
around the control room at odd in
tervals.
"We need fire," he says, and lights

a match.
An angelic glow seeps into the
room. The mood is undeniably ro
mantic — Hart is preparing to make
love to the music.
He sits down at the computer and
starts with a beat, simple, primal,
pulsing. He adds another, more com
plex this time. He loops one sound
over and over again, adjusting the
volume here, cutting and pasting, ca
ressing. It is madness. It sounds like
nothing. But the tension between the
instruments is building. More layers,
more beats, more — yes, finally —
vocals. More. More. More.
The band watches solemnly, occa
sionally offering input when it is so
licited. Eventually they drop in and
out of the control room, and in and
out of consciousness. People take
turns sleeping on the couch. They
order Thai food. They peruse long
forgotten issues of The San Francisco
Weekly. It becomes very cold, and
even though there are no windows in
the studio, one has the impression
that it is dark outside.
At one point Baron, Grant and
Davis congregate in the kitchenette
and speak in hushed tones about a
comment Hart made in passing —
something about wanting to be along
for their ride up to the top. They are

nearly delirious with excitement.
Hart believes in them. He needs
them. This is it; they are going to
make it. This is what it feels like to be
on the cusp of greatness. Armed with
this knowledge, they file quietly back
into the control room.
It is now 8:00 p.m., more than
seven hours since the band first ar
rived at Fantasy Studios. The lounge
is barely discernable beneath a veil
of ginger ale cans, takeout contain
ers, the now half-empty bottle of Jack
Daniels and a naked chicken carcass.
Suddenly, the door swings open to re
veal Baron beaming like a proud
new father. The ethereal notes of
"December" trail in after him, and
the result is astounding. It sounds
like a polished single, and a damn
good one at that.
"We got a lot done today," Baron
says, smiling through his exhaustion.
It is finally time to head back home.
A few weeks later, the finished
album arrives. It's catchy. It's upbeat.
It is unapologetically pop-y, and sur
prisingly provocative. This is The
Spins. This is their sweat, their music,
their Hart, completely intertwined
and contained within a tiny piece of
plastic. This is their fantasy. And it is
undoubtedly the beginning of some
thing incredible.

Spins. This is their sweat, their music,
their Hart, completely intertwined
and contained within a tiny piece of
plastic. This is their fantasy. And it is
undoubtedly the beginning of some
thing incredible.
BERKELEY. Calif. — From the
parking lot, the stone-covered complex at
26(K)Tenth St. does not seem like the kind
of place where rock legends are horn. But
the lobby behind the double glass doors
paints a different picture: platinum
records decorate the reception area like
metallic wallpaper, and posters of every
one from En Vogue to Journey grace the
hallways. Here, people feel as though
they are walking on hallowed ground.
Here people understand why they call it
Fantasy Studios.
But it is Saturday morning, and fre
quent guests like Aerosmith and Chris
Isaak are nowhere to be found. The same
minimalist sofas used by U2 are current
ly occupied by four denim-clad college
students, some of them sleeping, all of
them exhausted. They are Stanford Uni
versity seniors — they are The Spins.
And they are about to record and mix
their music in the same place that San
tana created "Supernatural."
A sound: David Baron, 21, strums a

m
few chords from "December" on a newly
restrung acoustic guitar. With neat
blonde hair and a collared shirt, only the
bottle of Jack Daniels at his feet betrays
his burgeoning rock star status. His
greenish eyes focus intently as he alter
nates between up- and up-and-down
strokes, listening for the difference be
tween the techniques
"What about that?" he asks the others.
"I think it sounds like snow falling."
They are slow to respond. "I can't tell
a difference with my eyes closed." replies
Gabe Davis, 21. sprawled face down on
the couch. Jack Conte. 21, nods his agree
ment from behind a sweatshirt hood ob
scuring his face. Davis had a jazz gig in
San Francisco the night before that ran
late; Conte awoke at 6:30 a.m. fora Stan
ford Improvisers activity
Ben Grant. 22, says nothing while
drumming his hands against his thighs.
Like Baron, he exudes a deceptive whole
someness, but Grant possesses no calm
facade. The studio's chief engineer
Stephen Hart is not in.and the security
guard does not know when he'll arrive.
Without Hart. The Spins can do nothing

*
but wait.
It is an activity to which the hand is ac
customed. In some ways they waited over
three years for this opportunity. The origi
nal members —Baron on piano and vo
cals, Davis on bass and Grant on drums —
formed the piano-pop-rock group their
freshman year under the name The David
Baron Element.Ttoo "Battle of the Bands"
championships, three name changes and
hundreds of on and off-campus gigs later.
The Spins added Conte on keyboard and
contacted guitarist Diego Picetti. 27, of
Sunnyvale (Picetti was not a part of the
album production process). By Oct. 2005.
they were finally prepared to woo a big
time producer,and Hart fit the bill.
Unfortunately Hart's bill — at more
than $20.(HM) an album — could newt lit
The Spins, and the twenty-somethings re
alized they needed cither a lottery win or
a miracle in order to earn the Midas
touch on their masterpiece. They got the
miracle: Hart's teenage son raved about
The Spins' demos, and upon closer in
spection, the recording veteran realized
the band possessed an intelligence diffi
cult to find in a new group that writes

their own music. He chose to accommo
date their modest budget, a risky move
that boosted the band's confidence expo
nentially.
Ah. 1 lart. Magi-like he approaches the
musicians, bearing gifts of ginger ale and
roast chicken. Suddenly, everyone is
awake.
"Stephen!"
"Hey. Stephen! 1 low are you?"
"What have you been up to?"
"Getting reamed," he replies dryly.
Everyone laughs. Hart is of moderate
stature, with glasses that sit on the end of
his nose and a vague resemblance to Paul
McCartney The Spins call him "the pro
fessor" for reasons that cannot be printed
in a family newspaper.
Iliey quickly navigate labyrinthine
hallways to the red door of Studio A.the
same studio where Green Day recorded
"Dookie."The space is extensive, and in
cludes a kitchenette,a lounge, a recording
facility and a control room dominated by
a colossal mixing board.
"Some of those buttons probably

haven't been touched in a very long
time," Grant notes, eyeing the board.
"Maybe you should roll around
on the table like a beached whale and
touch 'em all," Davis offers. Grant
declines.
The schedule for today is decep
tively simple: record a few percus
sion, guitar and vocal tracks and then
mix "December." But "December" is
a particularly complex piece, requir
ing over 50 vocal and instrumental
tracks to create the unique sound
that has come to define The Spins. It
is a sound better described by what it
is not than what it is — piano-rock,
but significantly more upbeat than
Coldplay. Funky, but less stylized
than Maroon 5. Pop-y,but free of the
gag-inducing insipidity that plagued
the boy bands of the nineties.
The Spins have high hopes for
their self-titled album, which they
plan to distribute to record labels,
venue booking managers and friends
(some tracks will also be available on
their Web site, http://www.thespins
band.com). They unanimously agree
that "Tell Her Something" is the
most single-friendly track on the
album, the track that may allow them
to secure a recording deal and break
into the mainstream. But they all
have a soft spot for "December," if

only because it is their most ambi
tious technical undertaking.
As Grant heads to the sound
proof studio to record a tambourine
track, Hart fiddles with the computer
near the mixing board. Every record
ed sound sends EKCJ-like images to
the monitor, allowing the user to
play, copy, cut and paste sound clips
with a click of a button.This is Hart's
canvas — but The Spins need to sup
ply the paint. A few more taps on the
keyboard and he's ready to begin.
"You all set?" Hart asks through
the intercom.
Grant nods.
Silence. Then, music. Grant furi
ously shakes the tambourine.
Now it's bye, baby, bye, sing me one
last lullaby...
After a few seconds the clip is si
lenced and then played again so
Grant can record the same track. To
the average listener's ear, the tracks
sound nearly identical, but to discern
ing musicians, even the slightest
change of tempo is cause for discus
sion.
Now it's bye, baby, bye, sing me
one last lullaby ...
Now it's bye, baby, bye, sing me one
last lullaby...
"/ felt like it was a little sloppy on
the last part," Conte says. "Can you do

it one more timer
Now it's bye. baby, bye. sing me
one last lullaby ...
Finally, Davis draws an obscene
picture with the caption "We Have a
Winner!" on a piece of paper and
holds it up so Grant can see that it is
time for him to leave the soundproof
recording area. It took over half an
hour to record and polish the tam
bourine track, but the finished prod
uct comprises less than ten seconds
of the song.
"Boys, progress has been made,"
Hart sighs.
Next. Baron heads into the sound
proof studio fora guitar track, and
later records a series of background
vocal tracks. The process is painstak
ing, infuriating, laborious and largely
unsatisfying. By the time the tracks
are finished, several hours have
passed and the only thing the band
has to show for their efforts is a mass
of nonsensical recordings and a
pounding headache.
Finally, it is time to mix.
Hart disappears and then returns
a few minutes later with 10 unscent
ed candles (where did he find
them?), which he delicately places
around the control room at odd in
tervals.
"We need fire," he says, and lights

a match.
An angelic glow seeps into the
room. The mood is undeniably ro
mantic — Hart is preparing to make
love to the music.
He sits down at the computer and
starts with a beat, simple, primal,
pulsing. He adds another, more com
plex this time. He loops one sound
over and over again, adjusting the
volume here, cutting and pasting, ca
ressing. It is madness. It sounds like
nothing. But the tension between the
instruments is building. More layers,
more beats, more — yes, finally —
vocals. More. More. More.
The band watches solemnly, occa
sionally offering input when it is so
licited. Eventually they drop in and
out of the control room, and in and
out of consciousness. People take
turns sleeping on the couch. They
order Thai food. They peruse long
forgotten issues of The San Francisco
Weekly. It becomes very cold, and
even though there are no windows in
the studio, one has the impression
that it is dark outside.
At one point Baron, Grant and
Davis congregate in the kitchenette
and speak in hushed tones about a
comment Hart made in passing —
something about wanting to be along
for their ride up to the top. They are

nearly delirious with excitement.
Hart believes in them. He needs
them. This is it; they are going to
make it. This is what it feels like to be
on the cusp of greatness. Armed with
this knowledge, they file quietly back
into the control room.
It is now 8:00 p.m., more than
seven hours since the band first ar
rived at Fantasy Studios. The lounge
is barely discernable beneath a veil
of ginger ale cans, takeout contain
ers, the now half-empty bottle of Jack
Daniels and a naked chicken carcass.
Suddenly, the door swings open to re
veal Baron beaming like a proud
new father. The ethereal notes of
"December" trail in after him, and
the result is astounding. It sounds
like a polished single, and a damn
good one at that.
"We got a lot done today," Baron
says, smiling through his exhaustion.
It is finally time to head back home.
A few weeks later, the finished
album arrives. It's catchy. It's upbeat.
It is unapologetically pop-y, and sur
prisingly provocative. This is The
Spins. This is their sweat, their music,
their Hart, completely intertwined
and contained within a tiny piece of
plastic. This is their fantasy. And it is

A few weeks later, the finished
album arrives. It's catchy. It's upbeat.
It is unapologetically pop-y, and sur
prisingly provocative. This is The
Spins. This is their sweat, their music,
their Hart, completely intertwined
and contained within a tiny piece of
plastic. This is their fantasy. And it is
undoubtedly the beginning of some
thing incredible.
BERKELEY. Calif. — From the
parking lot, the stone-covered complex at
26(K)Tenth St. does not seem like the kind
of place where rock legends are horn. But
the lobby behind the double glass doors
paints a different picture: platinum
records decorate the reception area like
metallic wallpaper, and posters of every
one from En Vogue to Journey grace the
hallways. Here, people feel as though
they are walking on hallowed ground.
Here people understand why they call it
Fantasy Studios.
But it is Saturday morning, and fre
quent guests like Aerosmith and Chris
Isaak are nowhere to be found. The same
minimalist sofas used by U2 are current
ly occupied by four denim-clad college
students, some of them sleeping, all of
them exhausted. They are Stanford Uni
versity seniors — they are The Spins.
And they are about to record and mix
their music in the same place that San
tana created "Supernatural."
A sound: David Baron, 21, strums a

m
few chords from "December" on a newly
restrung acoustic guitar. With neat
blonde hair and a collared shirt, only the
bottle of Jack Daniels at his feet betrays
his burgeoning rock star status. His
greenish eyes focus intently as he alter
nates between up- and up-and-down
strokes, listening for the difference be
tween the techniques
"What about that?" he asks the others.
"I think it sounds like snow falling."
They are slow to respond. "I can't tell
a difference with my eyes closed." replies
Gabe Davis, 21. sprawled face down on
the couch. Jack Conte. 21, nods his agree
ment from behind a sweatshirt hood ob
scuring his face. Davis had a jazz gig in
San Francisco the night before that ran
late; Conte awoke at 6:30 a.m. fora Stan
ford Improvisers activity
Ben Grant. 22, says nothing while
drumming his hands against his thighs.
Like Baron, he exudes a deceptive whole
someness, but Grant possesses no calm
facade. The studio's chief engineer
Stephen Hart is not in.and the security
guard does not know when he'll arrive.
Without Hart. The Spins can do nothing

*
but wait.
It is an activity to which the hand is ac
customed. In some ways they waited over
three years for this opportunity. The origi
nal members —Baron on piano and vo
cals, Davis on bass and Grant on drums —
formed the piano-pop-rock group their
freshman year under the name The David
Baron Element.Ttoo "Battle of the Bands"
championships, three name changes and
hundreds of on and off-campus gigs later.
The Spins added Conte on keyboard and
contacted guitarist Diego Picetti. 27, of
Sunnyvale (Picetti was not a part of the
album production process). By Oct. 2005.
they were finally prepared to woo a big
time producer,and Hart fit the bill.
Unfortunately Hart's bill — at more
than $20.(HM) an album — could newt lit
The Spins, and the twenty-somethings re
alized they needed cither a lottery win or
a miracle in order to earn the Midas
touch on their masterpiece. They got the
miracle: Hart's teenage son raved about
The Spins' demos, and upon closer in
spection, the recording veteran realized
the band possessed an intelligence diffi
cult to find in a new group that writes

their own music. He chose to accommo
date their modest budget, a risky move
that boosted the band's confidence expo
nentially.
Ah. 1 lart. Magi-like he approaches the
musicians, bearing gifts of ginger ale and
roast chicken. Suddenly, everyone is
awake.
"Stephen!"
"Hey. Stephen! 1 low are you?"
"What have you been up to?"
"Getting reamed," he replies dryly.
Everyone laughs. Hart is of moderate
stature, with glasses that sit on the end of
his nose and a vague resemblance to Paul
McCartney The Spins call him "the pro
fessor" for reasons that cannot be printed
in a family newspaper.
Iliey quickly navigate labyrinthine
hallways to the red door of Studio A.the
same studio where Green Day recorded
"Dookie."The space is extensive, and in
cludes a kitchenette,a lounge, a recording
facility and a control room dominated by
a colossal mixing board.
"Some of those buttons probably

haven't been touched in a very long
time," Grant notes, eyeing the board.
"Maybe you should roll around
on the table like a beached whale and
touch 'em all," Davis offers. Grant
declines.
The schedule for today is decep
tively simple: record a few percus
sion, guitar and vocal tracks and then
mix "December." But "December" is
a particularly complex piece, requir
ing over 50 vocal and instrumental
tracks to create the unique sound
that has come to define The Spins. It
is a sound better described by what it
is not than what it is — piano-rock,
but significantly more upbeat than
Coldplay. Funky, but less stylized
than Maroon 5. Pop-y,but free of the
gag-inducing insipidity that plagued
the boy bands of the nineties.
The Spins have high hopes for
their self-titled album, which they
plan to distribute to record labels,
venue booking managers and friends
(some tracks will also be available on
their Web site, http://www.thespins
band.com). They unanimously agree
that "Tell Her Something" is the
most single-friendly track on the
album, the track that may allow them
to secure a recording deal and break
into the mainstream. But they all
have a soft spot for "December," if

only because it is their most ambi
tious technical undertaking.
As Grant heads to the sound
proof studio to record a tambourine
track, Hart fiddles with the computer
near the mixing board. Every record
ed sound sends EKCJ-like images to
the monitor, allowing the user to
play, copy, cut and paste sound clips
with a click of a button.This is Hart's
canvas — but The Spins need to sup
ply the paint. A few more taps on the
keyboard and he's ready to begin.
"You all set?" Hart asks through
the intercom.
Grant nods.
Silence. Then, music. Grant furi
ously shakes the tambourine.
Now it's bye, baby, bye, sing me one
last lullaby...
After a few seconds the clip is si
lenced and then played again so
Grant can record the same track. To
the average listener's ear, the tracks
sound nearly identical, but to discern
ing musicians, even the slightest
change of tempo is cause for discus
sion.
Now it's bye, baby, bye, sing me
one last lullaby ...
Now it's bye, baby, bye, sing me one
last lullaby...
"/ felt like it was a little sloppy on
the last part," Conte says. "Can you do

it one more timer
Now it's bye. baby, bye. sing me
one last lullaby ...
Finally, Davis draws an obscene
picture with the caption "We Have a
Winner!" on a piece of paper and
holds it up so Grant can see that it is
time for him to leave the soundproof
recording area. It took over half an
hour to record and polish the tam
bourine track, but the finished prod
uct comprises less than ten seconds
of the song.
"Boys, progress has been made,"
Hart sighs.
Next. Baron heads into the sound
proof studio fora guitar track, and
later records a series of background
vocal tracks. The process is painstak
ing, infuriating, laborious and largely
unsatisfying. By the time the tracks
are finished, several hours have
passed and the only thing the band
has to show for their efforts is a mass
of nonsensical recordings and a
pounding headache.
Finally, it is time to mix.
Hart disappears and then returns
a few minutes later with 10 unscent
ed candles (where did he find
them?), which he delicately places
around the control room at odd in
tervals.
"We need fire," he says, and lights

a match.
An angelic glow seeps into the
room. The mood is undeniably ro
mantic — Hart is preparing to make
love to the music.
He sits down at the computer and
starts with a beat, simple, primal,
pulsing. He adds another, more com
plex this time. He loops one sound
over and over again, adjusting the
volume here, cutting and pasting, ca
ressing. It is madness. It sounds like
nothing. But the tension between the
instruments is building. More layers,
more beats, more — yes, finally —
vocals. More. More. More.
The band watches solemnly, occa
sionally offering input when it is so
licited. Eventually they drop in and
out of the control room, and in and
out of consciousness. People take
turns sleeping on the couch. They
order Thai food. They peruse long
forgotten issues of The San Francisco
Weekly. It becomes very cold, and
even though there are no windows in
the studio, one has the impression
that it is dark outside.
At one point Baron, Grant and
Davis congregate in the kitchenette
and speak in hushed tones about a
comment Hart made in passing —
something about wanting to be along
for their ride up to the top. They are

nearly delirious with excitement.
Hart believes in them. He needs
them. This is it; they are going to
make it. This is what it feels like to be
on the cusp of greatness. Armed with
this knowledge, they file quietly back
into the control room.
It is now 8:00 p.m., more than
seven hours since the band first ar
rived at Fantasy Studios. The lounge
is barely discernable beneath a veil
of ginger ale cans, takeout contain
ers, the now half-empty bottle of Jack
Daniels and a naked chicken carcass.
Suddenly, the door swings open to re
veal Baron beaming like a proud
new father. The ethereal notes of
"December" trail in after him, and
the result is astounding. It sounds
like a polished single, and a damn
good one at that.
"We got a lot done today," Baron
says, smiling through his exhaustion.
It is finally time to head back home.
A few weeks later, the finished
album arrives. It's catchy. It's upbeat.
It is unapologetically pop-y, and sur
prisingly provocative. This is The
Spins. This is their sweat, their music,
their Hart, completely intertwined
and contained within a tiny piece of
plastic. This is their fantasy. And it is
undoubtedly the beginning of some
thing incredible.
