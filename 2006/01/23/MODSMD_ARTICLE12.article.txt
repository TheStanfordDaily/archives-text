# From fantasy to reality: In the studio with The Spins
## 
### MARIE CHRISTINE CANNIZZARO 
BERKELEY. Calif. — From the
parking lot, the stone-covered complex at
26(K)Tenth St. does not seem like the kind
of place where rock legends are horn. But
the lobby behind the double glass doors
paints a different picture: platinum
records decorate the reception area like
metallic wallpaper, and posters of every
one from En Vogue to Journey grace the
hallways. Here, people feel as though
they are walking on hallowed ground.
Here people understand why they call it
Fantasy Studios.
But it is Saturday morning, and fre
quent guests like Aerosmith and Chris
Isaak are nowhere to be found. The same
minimalist sofas used by U2 are current
ly occupied by four denim-clad college
students, some of them sleeping, all of
them exhausted. They are Stanford Uni
versity seniors — they are The Spins.
And they are about to record and mix
their music in the same place that San
tana created "Supernatural."
A sound: David Baron, 21, strums a

m
few chords from "December" on a newly
restrung acoustic guitar. With neat
blonde hair and a collared shirt, only the
bottle of Jack Daniels at his feet betrays
his burgeoning rock star status. His
greenish eyes focus intently as he alter
nates between up- and up-and-down
strokes, listening for the difference be
tween the techniques
"What about that?" he asks the others.
"I think it sounds like snow falling."
They are slow to respond. "I can't tell
a difference with my eyes closed." replies
Gabe Davis, 21. sprawled face down on
the couch. Jack Conte. 21, nods his agree
ment from behind a sweatshirt hood ob
scuring his face. Davis had a jazz gig in
San Francisco the night before that ran
late; Conte awoke at 6:30 a.m. fora Stan
ford Improvisers activity
Ben Grant. 22, says nothing while
drumming his hands against his thighs.
Like Baron, he exudes a deceptive whole
someness, but Grant possesses no calm
facade. The studio's chief engineer
Stephen Hart is not in.and the security
guard does not know when he'll arrive.
Without Hart. The Spins can do nothing

*
but wait.
It is an activity to which the hand is ac
customed. In some ways they waited over
three years for this opportunity. The origi
nal members —Baron on piano and vo
cals, Davis on bass and Grant on drums —
formed the piano-pop-rock group their
freshman year under the name The David
Baron Element.Ttoo "Battle of the Bands"
championships, three name changes and
hundreds of on and off-campus gigs later.
The Spins added Conte on keyboard and
contacted guitarist Diego Picetti. 27, of
Sunnyvale (Picetti was not a part of the
album production process). By Oct. 2005.
they were finally prepared to woo a big
time producer,and Hart fit the bill.
Unfortunately Hart's bill — at more
than $20.(HM) an album — could newt lit
The Spins, and the twenty-somethings re
alized they needed cither a lottery win or
a miracle in order to earn the Midas
touch on their masterpiece. They got the
miracle: Hart's teenage son raved about
The Spins' demos, and upon closer in
spection, the recording veteran realized
the band possessed an intelligence diffi
cult to find in a new group that writes

their own music. He chose to accommo
date their modest budget, a risky move
that boosted the band's confidence expo
nentially.
Ah. 1 lart. Magi-like he approaches the
musicians, bearing gifts of ginger ale and
roast chicken. Suddenly, everyone is
awake.
"Stephen!"
"Hey. Stephen! 1 low are you?"
"What have you been up to?"
"Getting reamed," he replies dryly.
Everyone laughs. Hart is of moderate
stature, with glasses that sit on the end of
his nose and a vague resemblance to Paul
McCartney The Spins call him "the pro
fessor" for reasons that cannot be printed
in a family newspaper.
Iliey quickly navigate labyrinthine
hallways to the red door of Studio A.the
same studio where Green Day recorded
"Dookie."The space is extensive, and in
cludes a kitchenette,a lounge, a recording
facility and a control room dominated by
a colossal mixing board.
