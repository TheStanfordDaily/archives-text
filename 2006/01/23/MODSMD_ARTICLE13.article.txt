## Editorial New management CEO should invest responsibly 
### 
The recent departure of Stanford Man
agement Company Chief Executive
Officer Mike McCaffery will likely be
received as one of the less noticed personnel
changes at this University. Students rarely, if
ever, interact with the Stanford Management
Company (the entity that manages the Stan
ford endowment) and McCaffery has been
everything but a controversial figure. We be
lieve that this silent exit is unfortunate given
his substantial contributions to Stanford's fi
nancial sustainability. McCaffery's contribu
tions have ensured that the University will
have the resources to remain at the pinnacle
of higher education for years to come.
However, the recent focus on the social
impacts of the endowment's investments
highlights the potential fora new CEO to ex
pand performance measures beyond rates of
return. We ask the University to take into
consideration a potential replacement's com
mitment to furthering discussion on invest
ment responsibility as a part of the selection
criteria.
Last year, the Stanford endowment sup
ported 17 percent of the University's operat
ing expenditures through its significant 19.5-
percent rate of return. At $12.4 billion, Stan
ford's endowment is among the largest in the
country and is invested in index funds, mutu
al funds and hedge funds, and is partially
managed by active money managers. This
complex investment infrastructure has per
formed well over one-year, three-year and
10-year time spans.
During his time at Stanford. McCaffery
has played an integral part in these positive fi
nancial returns. However, renewed student
focus on investment responsibility toward the
end of McCaffery's tenure warrants greater
discussion on the role and job responsibilities
of the management company's CEO.
As it currently stands, the University re
sponds to petitions for shareholder action by
requiring activists to submit claims to the Ad
ministrative Panel on Investment Responsi
bility (API R). This panel is composed of four
students, four members of the Academic
Council, two alumni members, two University
staff members and a liaison from the manage
ment company. APIR may recommend share
holder action to the Board of Trustees, and the
Board is given the final sav on any decisions.

During McCaffery's tenure. API R has re
mained largely unchanged in its mandate or
activities. Only recently — following the
Sudan divestment campaign and demands
for investment disclosure — has the panel
been forced to examine issues of investment
responsibility. McCaffery's financial prowess
has been impressive, but we find it regrettable
that the management company has remained
generally silent in advocating fora stronger
socially responsible investment infrastruc
ture. API R is in desperate need of reform and
McCaffery has largely stood on the sidelines.
The new management company CEO will
face new and emerging challenges when it
comes to how Stanford can and should bal
ance its principles with its investment method
ology. Will the University continue to stand by
the principles President John Hennessy reit
erated following Stanford's divestment from
companies doing business in Sudan? Or will
the management company ignore the moral
principles on which Stanford was founded in
pursuit of pure investment returns?
These are questions that the new manage
ment company CEO must answer and should
state publicly to members of the Stanford
community. We certainly call fora more thor
ough discussion about the way our endow
ment is being used for social good or bad. Ab
sent that, however, we believe it is at least in
cumbent upon the new CEO to use his posi
tion and resources to further this discussion
through the strengthening of institutions like
APIR.
Last April, the panel held a town hall
meeting at which Rick Banks, a Law School
professor and member of APIR. stated that
the panel must rely on community members
to file detailed complaints that allege wrong
doing because most people on the panel don't
have the time or resources to investigate spe
cific companies. The new CEO can take sub
stantive action by contributing the necessary
resources toward better research into alleged
wrongdoing (or by urging the University to
do so). I folding students responsible for pur
suing tasks that socially responsible invest
ment firms are paid several thousands of dol
lars to do essentially undermines the princi
ples of socially responsible investing.
