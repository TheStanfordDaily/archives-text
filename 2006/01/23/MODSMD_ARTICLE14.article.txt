# Lessons learned at La Poste
## 
### 
Winter quarters have always been my
most challenging months at Stan
ford, and this year is no exception.
It's junior year and I have to find an interest
ing, preferably well-paid internship for the
summer that will clarify my post-graduation
plans. It didn't fully dawn on me until this win
ter break that 1 would soon have to look fora
full-time job or apply to graduate school.
Since I have only vague ideas for life after
Stanford, and since I am considering far too
many options, I've been playing a mind game
called:"How many things could 1 theoretical
ly do simultaneously?"
For example, could I work as a manage
ment consultant and as a fiction or socio-po
litical writer — if time weren't an issue, that
is? The more I think about it.the more skep
tical 1 am about this possibility. These jobs re
quire ways of looking at the world that are
vastly different. As a management consult
ant, you are asked to think in terms of effi
ciencyl and problem-solving. As a fiction or
socio-political writer, your task is to notice
subtle details — in situations, in interactions,
in a political context — which are lost on
most people and which you hopefully man
age to convey through your prose.
A consultant's first reflex when he or she
encounters an inefficient organization is
probably to try to implement corrective
measures as soon as possible. A writer, on the
other hand, may find a charm in the ineffi
ciencies, or may want to look more closely at
how organization members interact with one
another — what they talk about, who gets
along with whom, etc.
I found myself torn between these two
mindsets during my internship at La Poste
(the French postal service, which also pro
vides banking and financial services) last
summer. On an efficiency scale, the office 1
worked in scored very poorly. This upset me
at times, especially when I was asked to exe
cute a task in a certain way when I could have
done it much more efficiently in a different
way — but most of the time 1 was very
amused and engaged by my work.
Indeed, my internship was incredibly rich
from a human perspective. I quickly became
attuned with the office's culture and informal
organization. Every morning at 10 a.m.. Joel,
who had been working at the office for 33
years, would leave his counter and take a 15-
minute break to carefully peel and eat an
apple — whether or not one of his colleagues
could take over his counter for those 15 min
utes. Sonia. my manager, constantly com
plained about the fact that she never had any
time to do her work because she had to do

other people's work. In fact, she did other
people's work because she got along very
badly with Claude, the person right below her
in the office hierarchy, and she wanted the
rest of the employees to like her better than
Claude.
For the first half of my internship, whenev
er a customer asked fora product that was a
little bit out of the ordinary — for example,
an extra-large envelope or fancy stamps —
the worker helping the customer would have
to leave his counter, walk all the way down a
long corridor, fill out a paper with the quanti
ty and price of the products he was taking and
walk back to his counter,often chatting with a
colleague on the way. During the waiting
time, customers understandably got impa
tient and angry. ITie workers got upset be
cause they felt that they were working hard
and were misunderstood. 'ITiey did work
hard, but in an inefficient environment which
they never questioned. Only when the new
office manager put big shelves right behind
the counters and stocked them with all the
necessary products did the corridor-walking
stop.
The office manager and I had daily discus
sions on solutions for making the office more
efficient. I helped him implement some of
them during the time I was there, but when 1
left the office it was still very much in a transi
tion phase. When I came back to visit two
months later.the office had been transformed
into a well-functioning organization. I was
filled with admiration for the office manager,
who had accomplished a formidable task.
But it also made me a bit sad. There had
been so much to talk and write about when 1
came home after a day of work: the strike, the
hourly coffee and cigarette breaks, broken
machines, angry customers. Now things ran
much more smoothly. My problem-solving,
efficient side rejoiced while my
sociologist/writer side longed for the chaotic,
unorganized period of transition that had
given me so much to think about on human
behavior.

hard, but in an inefficient environment which
they never questioned. Only when the new
office manager put big shelves right behind
the counters and stocked them with all the
necessary products did the corridor-walking
stop.
The office manager and I had daily discus
sions on solutions for making the office more
efficient. I helped him implement some of
them during the time I was there, but when 1
left the office it was still very much in a transi
tion phase. When I came back to visit two
months later.the office had been transformed
into a well-functioning organization. I was
filled with admiration for the office manager,
who had accomplished a formidable task.
But it also made me a bit sad. There had
been so much to talk and write about when 1
came home after a day of work: the strike, the
hourly coffee and cigarette breaks, broken
machines, angry customers. Now things ran
much more smoothly. My problem-solving,
efficient side rejoiced while my
sociologist/writer side longed for the chaotic,
unorganized period of transition that had
given me so much to think about on human
behavior.
