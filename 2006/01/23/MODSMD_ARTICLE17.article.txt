# Generation X? No, Generation $
## 
### 
Our generation isn't doing enough to
support this war. It's not like, you
know, some of us are fighting it. So it
makes complete sense for Congress to vote to
cut funding for student loans. The latest budg
et cuts, if they pass, would cut $14.3 billion
from student loans. 1 question a Congress that
places the burden of a war on the shoulders of
one generation — ours. The government is
calling for us to fight the war, and then asking
those who didn't go to have increased debts.
And that tax cut? Not really helping us.
Congress, in its defense, was split on the
issue. That means only half of Congress and
Dick Cheney really hate our generation. But
I still think the media's relative quietness and
the total lack of outrage at burdening stu
dents with extra loans are disgusting. 1 won
der if the Boomer generation remembers the
disillusion it felt during the Vietnam War. I
wonder if its members recall how they felt an
entire nation's burden had been placed on
their shoulders. 1 wonder how many drugs
they took to forget about it and dump a sim
ilar situation on us.
So we have to get back at our parents and
grandparents. I think I know how.
Imagine the headlines:"Entire generation
vows to get tattoos, piercings and listen to re
ally loud music." That'll show them old fo
gies. Oh! And then, we'll take CBS off the
air.' Next, we're going to nuke Florida. It'll be
the timeshare apocalypse. Retirees in mass
exodus — motorized rascals all trying to
cross into Georgia. Chaos! Anarchy! "Mat
lock" lovers!
Perhaps the best threat we can make is not
against the current age group in charge. They
won't be the ones footing the bill for this war,
and we really have no way of getting back at
them. And while they'll clearly don't like us, 1
know who they will like: our children. That's

right, the best way to get back at our parent's
and grandparent's generations is to threaten
to dump the whole mess on our children's gen
eration. We'll hold our own children hostage.
That deficit isn't going away. And just like
they've dumped today's problems on tomor
row's taxpayers, we can do the same thing.
See, they hate us, but they love their grand
kids. Imagine this scenario in the far future:
Your parents come to visit their grandchild;
you smile as they offer a present to your son.
You remark, "A toy for Billy? Well, Billy isn't
playing much with his toys anymore. In order
to deal with the massive deficit, my genera
tion voted to repeal child labor laws. Now that
Billy can speak, he's been working as a
greeter at Wal-Mart. At this rate, he may be
promoted to assistant manager by the time he
hits puberty." And just to drive home the
point that our children's generation will be re
ally screwed and we have our parents to
thank, we can add acerbically, "But thanks,
we'll sell the toy. Just like you sold us."
Perhaps the best way to demonstrate the
absurdity of the situation is to compare the
American system with our friends in Britain.
According to the Congressional Budget Of
fice, the average student-loan recipient is
now expected to incur $5,800 more in inter
ests and fees during repayment. What is in
teresting, and scary, is that $5,800 is similar to
the cost of an entire year of tuition at a

British university. With the exchange rate, •
this amount is roughly equivalent to £3,200. 2
That's quite a bit more than the £1,125 annu- *
al tuition costs at most British universities. «
Currently, a typical American student on fi- *
nancial aid leaves with about $17,500 in debt,
which is enough to pay for an entire college
career and possibly a master's degree in «
Britain. In contrast to the American system,
British universities hand out wands and 14-
year-old pieces of jailbait upon admission.
Let me clarify — my college education
has been expensive, but not worthless. 1 just
think it's interesting how education is a prior
ity in this country in the same way that "get- ;
ting clean" is a priority for Courtney Love. •
Tuition is costly and the government isn't
doing anything to make it easier for students.
In fact, it makes our generation's lives that
much more complicated.
We face increased debt, a national deficit,
a war without end and an international situa
tion which will probably not be resolved by
the time we inherit responsibility for the
country's governance. Bush gets no heat for
screwing over our generation, whereas Blair
is getting yanked through the fires of Mar
garet Thatcher's grave' because he suggested
increasing annual tuition to about £3,000. So
maybe it's not right to blame the president,
the Congress, or the current government.
Maybe it's time we look to ourselves, realize
we're getting screwed and do something
about it. I want my Hermione, dammit.
1 Old people watch it. Trust me.
No, she's not dead. It's figurative.

Thatcher; the British system and the Ministry of
