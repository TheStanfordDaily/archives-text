Course scheduling complicated
by various factors
Friday's editorial,"Classes should stick to
the right times" (Jan. 20). naturally present
ed the problem from the student viewpoint
and focused on student inconvenience and
difficulty when constructing a course sched
ule. However, this is an important issue that
has wider ramifications and alternative per
spectives.
Any large class meeting only TUesday,
Wednesday and Thursday allows that faculty
instructor to have a four-day weekend. More
over, these inefficient schedules cost the Uni
versity because more classrooms are re
quired. This practice is rumored to be long
standing and has apparently never been stud
ied. 1 have been told that for many years, large
humanities classes having senior faculty lec
turers are seldom scheduled on Fridays or on
Mondays. Faculty prosper but students suffer
from such schedules.
To enable more flexible course schedules,
classes could be scheduled at 8 a.m. or on a
Ttiesday-Thursday-Saturday calendar, as
they were many years ago. Such an efficient

schedule would, however, be a curse to most
students.

Yes, it actually was plagiarism
I am writing in response to Michael Bax's
letter ("Was it actually plagiarism?", Jan. 20).
As a representative member of the Coalition
for Justice in the Middle East, 1 would like to
say that Bax's claim that our organization only
wished to dramatize the "dodgy dossier" scan
dal merely indicates that Bax probably either
did not attend the lecture or did not pay close
enough attention to the lecture to realize the
intensity of the issue.
As students representing one of the most
respectable and prestigious academic institu
tions in the world, I think we should be more
aware of the many forms of plagiarism in the
academic (and governmental) arena and of
the ethical implications of trying to find loop
holes that might allow us to represent other
peoples' work as ours.
When 19 paragraphs of the British Intelli
gence report, which was used as justification

for the war in Iraq, are copied and pasted di
rectly from Ibrahim Al-Marashi's article with
out any attribution to his work, then that is in
fact plagiarism. The British government even
acknowledged its foul play by formally apolo
gizing to Al-Marashi.
Furthermore, certain words from Al-
Marashi's article were altered to make an ar
gument that Al-Marashi did not intend to
make. An example of this misinformation was
the blatant replacement of the term "opposi
tion groups" to "terrorist organizations." It is
also important to note that Al-Marashi's doc
toral thesis was not written to describe the
contemporary time period in Iraq, but rather
was an account describing Iraq in 1990.
As for Bax's claim that our organization is
"agenda-driven," I would like to clarify that
our only "agenda" is to promote awareness
and dialogue about issues pertaining to the
Middle East on campus. At a time when there
has been an immense focus on the problems
the Middle East faces. I believe that it is our
duty to educate the community and advocate
for justice and human rights in that region.
