The Daily incorrectly re
ported in "Stanford Sends Kat
rina Students to Home
Schools," published on Jan. 18,
that some students have been
admitted through the standard
transfer application process for
the fall of 2006. The Office of
Undergraduate Admission has
not admitted any transfer stu
dents for the fall of 2006 and
has not yet begun the evalua
tion of transfer applications.
Richard H. Shaw, dean of Ad
mission and Financial Aid, said
that Stanford will welcome the
opportunity to review the ap
plications of all transfer candi
dates, including those from
Stanford's Katrina Guest stu
dents, later this spring.
