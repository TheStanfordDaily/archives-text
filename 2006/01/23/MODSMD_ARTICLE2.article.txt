# Diamond a plaintiff in ACLU suit
## Civil Liberties Union takes on federal surveillance program 
### JENNY ALLEN CASSIE HARVEY 
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)
and the Center for Constitutional Rights filed two
separate lawsuits challenging the Bush administra
tion's domestic eavesdropping program on lUes
day, Jan. 17. These civil rights groups contend that
this program was used to illegally and unconstitu
tionally monitor communications by Americans

with connections to the
Middle East. Included
amongst the ACLU
plaintiffs is Political Sci
ence Prof. Larry Dia
mond, a senior fellow at
Stanford's Hoover In
stitution and co-direc
tor of the International
Forum for Democratic
Studies of the National
Endowment for
Democracy.
Diamond said he was
teaching his students
about "horizontal ac

countability" — the idea that different agencies of
government should hold others accountable for fol
lowing the Constitution and the law — right
around the time the lawyers from the ACLU called.
Diamond said his lawyers told him they "had
strong reason to believe" he had been among those
monitored under the surveillance program.
"It appears the ever-widening scope of the do
mestic surveillance program can get to the point
where it's monitoring people who are very distant
from terrorists," Diamond said, adding that phone
calls and e-mails to particular countries are detect
ed in the vast data-mining trove. Based on the ex
tent of contact he has had with people from these
countries, or who have had contact with him. Dia
mond said his lawyers believed it was very likely
that some of his phone calls — and especially his e
mails — have been intercepted.

workers, opposition activists and civil
society leaders in Asia and the Mid
dle East concerning human rights
abuses and political developments.
Diamond said he considers his
work contingent on his ability to
communicate freely with people
around the globe.
In his official statement for the
ACLU, Diamond wrote "wide
spread, warrantless surveillance will
inhibit my ability to gather informa
tion for research and advocacy and to
have unimpeded exchanges with
scholars around the world. It will
weaken our ties with people in these
countries, ties we need to cultivate
and expand, not constrict, if we want
to foster democratic change and win
the war on terror."
He said he fears that if these indi
viduals have reason to believe that
their communications are being in
tercepted, they may stop sharing in
formation that could be beneficial to
the United States' long-term national
interest.
According to Diamond, it is im
portant not to assume that "the U.S. is
necessarily the paragon of all demo
cratic virtue."
In his official statement he wrote
"we cannot fight for freedom abroad
by surrendering it at home. If we want
to be effective in promoting freedom
and democracy in the world, we have
to be faithful to our democratic prin
ciples. One reason why the United
States is held in such low esteem in
these parts of the world today is be
cause we are seen as hypocritical."
The ACLU suit represents the
first major court challenge to Presi
dent George W. Bush's domestic sur
veillance program, which permits the
National Security Administration
(NSA) to monitor telephone and e

mail exchanges without a court war
rant. Attorney General Alberto Gon
zales has defended the program as
part of the broad powers granted by
Congress in the post-Sept. 11 Patriot
Act. Both the ACLU and Diamond
reject this claim.
"1 do not believe Bush had any de
liberate desire to violate the Consti
tution," Diamond said. "But 1 think
Congress did not grant — and did
not intend to grant — the scope of
authority the president has claimed.
And more importantly, many mem
bers of Congress insist they had no in
tention of granting this degree of ex
ecutive discretion when they passed
the Patriot Act. The point is, at a min
imum, there is a very serious dispute
on whether this is constitutional and
the only way to settle the dispute is by
taking it to court."
Scott McClellan, Bush's press sec
retary, has referred to this case and
ones like it, as "frivolous lawsuits
that do nothing to help enhance civil
liberties to protect the American
people."
Diamond said he deeply resents
this response and that critical ques
tions about the "excessive expansion
of executive power" and the protec
tion of civil liberties lie at the heart of
the lawsuit.
"To call the lawsuit frivolous or
partisan 1 think is unfounded," he
said. "We can't be apathetic about it
simply because we face a threat of in
ternational terrorism. I believe if
there's one lesson in history, it's that
we must be extremely vigorous and
vigilant in defending democracy."
Diamond further explained that
the lawsuit is not driven by partisan
motives.
"1 am not on the left side of the po
litical party," he said. "1 very strongly
agree with the president's goals of

promoting democracy in the world.
There is a lot Bush is trying to do that
I support. 1 give him credit for that."
Sophomore Gabriel Winant, vice
president of the Stanford Democ
rats. said he believes that Congress
did not authorize federal spying,
based on Gonzales' contradictory
justifications that the resolution au
thorizing the use of force in
Afghanistan also authorized domes
tic spying and that the reason the
Bush administration never explicitly
requested such authorization from
Congress was that they did not be
lieve legislators would agree.
"With a Republican Congress ap
parently unwilling to make the ad
ministration answer for its gross vio
lation of the most basic constitution
al principles, this lawsuit is the next
and appropriate step to expose the
extraordinary paranoia of the Bush's
administration and clear the air of its
pungent whiff of authoritarianism,"
Winant said.

Other members of the Stanford
Democrats said they are also pleased
about the two lawsuits.
"The government had every op
portunity to obtain warrants and
eavesdrop legally, but instead decid
ed to violate the Fifth Amendment,"
said sophomore Debashish Bakshi.
"I am glad that the Center for Con
stitutional Responsibility and the
ACLU are taking civil action against
the Bush administration. 1 lowever.it
will take much more than lawsuits to
impel substantive change in U.S. sur
veillance policy. Greater and more
active congressional and judicial
oversight is both badly missed and
needed."
Representatives of the Stanford
College Republicans could not be
reached.
According to sophomore Margot
Isman, former president of the Stan
ford Democrats, the lawsuits were an
inevitable result of the Bush admin
istration's illegal plan to spy on

Americans.
"People of our country are sick of
being lied to by the Bush Administra
tion. and I hope that their latest at
tempt to subvert our rights in the
name of national security will be
brought to justice," Isman said.
Some students, however, said they
do not anticipate that the lawsuits
will be successful.
"1 believe that the case against the
domestic spying program has merit,
as it is a clear violation of the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Act," said
sophomore and Stanford Democrats
board member Bernard Fraga.
"However, the political pressure on
any judge who takes this case would
be immense, even if this were not the
Bush administration. Given the limit
ed success of cases brought against
this Administration, even when the
constitutional abuses seem clear. 1
cannot foresee a victory for the
ACLU or the Center for Constitu
tional Rights in their suits."

In his official statement for the
ACLU, Diamond wrote "wide
spread, warrantless surveillance will
inhibit my ability to gather informa
tion for research and advocacy and to
have unimpeded exchanges with
scholars around the world. It will
weaken our ties with people in these
countries, ties we need to cultivate
and expand, not constrict, if we want
to foster democratic change and win
the war on terror."
He said he fears that if these indi
viduals have reason to believe that
their communications are being in
tercepted, they may stop sharing in
formation that could be beneficial to
the United States' long-term national
interest.
According to Diamond, it is im
portant not to assume that "the U.S. is
necessarily the paragon of all demo
cratic virtue."
In his official statement he wrote
"we cannot fight for freedom abroad
by surrendering it at home. If we want
to be effective in promoting freedom
and democracy in the world, we have
to be faithful to our democratic prin
ciples. One reason why the United
States is held in such low esteem in
these parts of the world today is be
cause we are seen as hypocritical."
The ACLU suit represents the
first major court challenge to Presi
dent George W. Bush's domestic sur
veillance program, which permits the
National Security Administration
(NSA) to monitor telephone and e

mail exchanges without a court war
rant. Attorney General Alberto Gon
zales has defended the program as
part of the broad powers granted by
Congress in the post-Sept. 11 Patriot
Act. Both the ACLU and Diamond
reject this claim.
"1 do not believe Bush had any de
liberate desire to violate the Consti
tution," Diamond said. "But 1 think
Congress did not grant — and did
not intend to grant — the scope of
authority the president has claimed.
And more importantly, many mem
bers of Congress insist they had no in
tention of granting this degree of ex
ecutive discretion when they passed
the Patriot Act. The point is, at a min
imum, there is a very serious dispute
on whether this is constitutional and
the only way to settle the dispute is by
taking it to court."
Scott McClellan, Bush's press sec
retary, has referred to this case and
ones like it, as "frivolous lawsuits
that do nothing to help enhance civil
liberties to protect the American
people."
Diamond said he deeply resents
this response and that critical ques
tions about the "excessive expansion
of executive power" and the protec
tion of civil liberties lie at the heart of
the lawsuit.
"To call the lawsuit frivolous or
partisan 1 think is unfounded," he
said. "We can't be apathetic about it
simply because we face a threat of in
ternational terrorism. I believe if
there's one lesson in history, it's that
we must be extremely vigorous and
vigilant in defending democracy."
Diamond further explained that
the lawsuit is not driven by partisan
motives.
"1 am not on the left side of the po
litical party," he said. "1 very strongly
agree with the president's goals of

promoting democracy in the world.
There is a lot Bush is trying to do that
I support. 1 give him credit for that."
Sophomore Gabriel Winant, vice
president of the Stanford Democ
rats. said he believes that Congress
did not authorize federal spying,
based on Gonzales' contradictory
justifications that the resolution au
thorizing the use of force in
Afghanistan also authorized domes
tic spying and that the reason the
Bush administration never explicitly
requested such authorization from
Congress was that they did not be
lieve legislators would agree.
"With a Republican Congress ap
parently unwilling to make the ad
ministration answer for its gross vio
lation of the most basic constitution
al principles, this lawsuit is the next
and appropriate step to expose the
extraordinary paranoia of the Bush's
administration and clear the air of its
pungent whiff of authoritarianism,"
Winant said.

Other members of the Stanford
Democrats said they are also pleased
about the two lawsuits.
"The government had every op
portunity to obtain warrants and
eavesdrop legally, but instead decid
ed to violate the Fifth Amendment,"
said sophomore Debashish Bakshi.
"I am glad that the Center for Con
stitutional Responsibility and the
ACLU are taking civil action against
the Bush administration. 1 lowever.it
will take much more than lawsuits to
impel substantive change in U.S. sur
veillance policy. Greater and more
active congressional and judicial
oversight is both badly missed and
needed."
Representatives of the Stanford
College Republicans could not be
reached.
According to sophomore Margot
Isman, former president of the Stan
ford Democrats, the lawsuits were an
inevitable result of the Bush admin
istration's illegal plan to spy on

Americans.
"People of our country are sick of
being lied to by the Bush Administra
tion. and I hope that their latest at
tempt to subvert our rights in the
name of national security will be
brought to justice," Isman said.
Some students, however, said they
do not anticipate that the lawsuits
will be successful.
"1 believe that the case against the
domestic spying program has merit,
as it is a clear violation of the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Act," said
sophomore and Stanford Democrats
board member Bernard Fraga.
"However, the political pressure on
any judge who takes this case would
be immense, even if this were not the
Bush administration. Given the limit
ed success of cases brought against
this Administration, even when the
constitutional abuses seem clear. 1
cannot foresee a victory for the
ACLU or the Center for Constitu
tional Rights in their suits."
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)
and the Center for Constitutional Rights filed two
separate lawsuits challenging the Bush administra
tion's domestic eavesdropping program on lUes
day, Jan. 17. These civil rights groups contend that
this program was used to illegally and unconstitu
tionally monitor communications by Americans

with connections to the
Middle East. Included
amongst the ACLU
plaintiffs is Political Sci
ence Prof. Larry Dia
mond, a senior fellow at
Stanford's Hoover In
stitution and co-direc
tor of the International
Forum for Democratic
Studies of the National
Endowment for
Democracy.
Diamond said he was
teaching his students
about "horizontal ac

countability" — the idea that different agencies of
government should hold others accountable for fol
lowing the Constitution and the law — right
around the time the lawyers from the ACLU called.
Diamond said his lawyers told him they "had
strong reason to believe" he had been among those
monitored under the surveillance program.
"It appears the ever-widening scope of the do
mestic surveillance program can get to the point
where it's monitoring people who are very distant
from terrorists," Diamond said, adding that phone
calls and e-mails to particular countries are detect
ed in the vast data-mining trove. Based on the ex
tent of contact he has had with people from these
countries, or who have had contact with him. Dia
mond said his lawyers believed it was very likely
that some of his phone calls — and especially his e
mails — have been intercepted.
