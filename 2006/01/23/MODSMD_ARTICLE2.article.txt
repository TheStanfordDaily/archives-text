# Diamond a plaintiff in ACLU suit
## Civil Liberties Union takes on federal surveillance program 
### JENNY ALLEN CASSIE HARVEY 
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)
and the Center for Constitutional Rights filed two
separate lawsuits challenging the Bush administra
tion's domestic eavesdropping program on lUes
day, Jan. 17. These civil rights groups contend that
this program was used to illegally and unconstitu
tionally monitor communications by Americans

with connections to the
Middle East. Included
amongst the ACLU
plaintiffs is Political Sci
ence Prof. Larry Dia
mond, a senior fellow at
Stanford's Hoover In
stitution and co-direc
tor of the International
Forum for Democratic
Studies of the National
Endowment for
Democracy.
Diamond said he was
teaching his students
about "horizontal ac

countability" — the idea that different agencies of
government should hold others accountable for fol
lowing the Constitution and the law — right
around the time the lawyers from the ACLU called.
Diamond said his lawyers told him they "had
strong reason to believe" he had been among those
monitored under the surveillance program.
"It appears the ever-widening scope of the do
mestic surveillance program can get to the point
where it's monitoring people who are very distant
from terrorists," Diamond said, adding that phone
calls and e-mails to particular countries are detect
ed in the vast data-mining trove. Based on the ex
tent of contact he has had with people from these
countries, or who have had contact with him. Dia
mond said his lawyers believed it was very likely
that some of his phone calls — and especially his e
mails — have been intercepted.
