■ Card rebound to pull away in the second
half of a closely-fought game against ASU

After Stanford's draining overtime loss to Arizona on Hiursday.
the question of whether the team had anything left in the tank
popped up yetagain with 11 minutes remaining in the second half
and the Cardinal trailing Arizona State, 48-41, at Wells Fargo Arena
on Saturday.

But senior center Matt
Haryasz, playing his last colle
giate game in his home state,
provided the much-needed fuel
and propelled the team to a 70-
64 victory. He scored on the
perimeter, at the line and in the
paint, pouring in 10 of Stan
ford's next 14 points — all part
of a 14-3 run that gave the Car
dinal (8-7, 4-3 Pacific-10 Con
ference) a 55-54 edge with 6:08
left to play.
After the Sun Devils (7-10,1-
7) tied the score at 61 with just
over two minutes remaining,
Haryasz converted a three
point play, taking a pass from
senior guard Chris Hernandez
and kissing the ball off the glass
for the last of his career-high 27
points, 17 of which came in the
second period.

FINAL RETURN
Matt Haryasz
In the senior forward's final
game in his home state of
Arizona, Haryasz made his
mark, setting his Stanford
career-best for points scored
in a game with 27 against
Arizona State on Saturday.
On the offensive and defen
sive end of the floor, Matt has
anchored ihe Cardinal at
tack this season.

"When a fellas feeling it,you've got to keep giving him the hall ,"
Hernandez said. "And he was feeling it."
Haryasz's contributions didn't only come on the offensive end.
With 25 seconds left to play and Arizona State down by two. Sun
Devil guard Kevin Kruger drove the lane. Haryasz, in danger of
picking up his fifth foul, altered the shot. Kruger missed, Arizona
State forward Serge Angounou was whistled for traveling after he
fell to the floor with the loose ball, and the Cardinal escaped with
their first road win of the season and a much-needed Pac-10 victo
ry-
"lt feels awesome to play here," Haryasz said. "It was a special
game for me. and I'm glad we got the win."
Haryasz joked that it would have been a more memorable trip if
Stanford had beaten the Wildcats as well, but Arizona and Arizona
State defenders should have no trouble remembering the 52 com
bined points he scored against the two teams.
Because they were playing in a small.sparsely crowded arena —
a world away from Arizona's rollicking McKale Center — head
coach Trent Johnson might have been concerned that the Cardinal
would have trouble sustaining their intensity for 40 minutes.
"We knew coming in that if we didn't come out and match their
energy, we wouldn't be able to hang in this game." Johnson said. "I
told [the team] that there is no excuse in college basketball to not
have the same energy level every day, for every game. But I didn't
have to tell them that."
He certainlv didn't have to tell senior guard Dan Grunfeld.

who came out firing — scoring
Stanford's first nine points to keep
the game close after the Sun Dev
ils jumped out to a 13-6 lead in the
first six minutes of the first half. He
scored all 15 of his points in the pe
riod.
Grunfeld's performance was
matched by that of Sun Devil fresh
man Jeff Pendergraph, who scored
14 of his team's first 22 points on
seven-of-eight shooting before
falling to the floor with a sprained
ankle with 3:39 remaining in the first
half. Pendergraph would not return,
but he led Arizona State in scoring
despite playing only 10 minutes.
The Sun Devils led until 2:54 re
mained in the first half, when Grun
feld banked a shot off the glass from
just outside the key to tie the game
at 28. A Haryasz jumper from the
wing gave Stanford a 35-33 edge
heading into the half.
The second half started slowly
for both teams before Kevin Kruger
and Bryson Krueger, Arizona
State's leading scorers, went to
work. Kevin Kruger nailed an open
three to give Arizona State a 40-39
lead 4:35 into the half. Bryson
Krueger sank two short jumpers on
consecutive possessions and nailed
a three to close out a 14-4 Sun Devil
run. during which the Cardinal com
mitted four turnovers.
Then Haryasz took over. He
blocked a shot, ran the break, got
the ball back and dunked it. He
made three jumpers, two of the
turnaround variety, on Stanford's
next four possessions to give the
Cardinal the lead.
It was a nice win for Haryasz,
who was playing in front of a num
ber of family members. It was also a
crucial victory for the Cardinal,
who are only one game back in a
crowded Pac-10 race in which six
teams are within one game of the
top spot.
Hernandez was bothered by a
bad back throughout the game at
Arizona State, a recurring injury
that he attributed in part to fatigue;
he played 39 minutes against Ari
zona after practicing at less than full
speed in recent weeks.
Hernandez played 30 minutes
against the Sun Devils but scored
only nine points to go with two as
sists, well below his season averages.
Freshman guard Mitch Johnson
picked up the slack, notching a ca
reer-high six assists.
Tests over the weekend revealed
that sophomore forward Peter
Prowitt, who hasn't played since
Jan. 13, is suffering from bone bruis
es in his back. He is tentatively
scheduled to return to practice
today after sitting out last week.

ford's next 14 points — all part
of a 14-3 run that gave the Car
dinal (8-7, 4-3 Pacific-10 Con
ference) a 55-54 edge with 6:08
left to play.
After the Sun Devils (7-10,1-

over two minutes remaining,
Haryasz converted a three
point play, taking a pass from
senior guard Chris Hernandez
and kissing the ball off the glass
for the last of his career-high 27
points, 17 of which came in the
second period.

FINAL RETURN
Matt Haryasz
In the senior forward's final
game in his home state of
Arizona, Haryasz made his
mark, setting his Stanford
career-best for points scored
in a game with 27 against
Arizona State on Saturday.
On the offensive and defen
sive end of the floor, Matt has
anchored ihe Cardinal at
tack this season.

"When a fellas feeling it,you've got to keep giving him the hall ,"
Hernandez said. "And he was feeling it."
Haryasz's contributions didn't only come on the offensive end.
With 25 seconds left to play and Arizona State down by two. Sun
Devil guard Kevin Kruger drove the lane. Haryasz, in danger of
picking up his fifth foul, altered the shot. Kruger missed, Arizona
State forward Serge Angounou was whistled for traveling after he
fell to the floor with the loose ball, and the Cardinal escaped with
their first road win of the season and a much-needed Pac-10 victo
ry-
"lt feels awesome to play here," Haryasz said. "It was a special
game for me. and I'm glad we got the win."
Haryasz joked that it would have been a more memorable trip if
Stanford had beaten the Wildcats as well, but Arizona and Arizona
State defenders should have no trouble remembering the 52 com
bined points he scored against the two teams.
Because they were playing in a small.sparsely crowded arena —
a world away from Arizona's rollicking McKale Center — head
coach Trent Johnson might have been concerned that the Cardinal
would have trouble sustaining their intensity for 40 minutes.
"We knew coming in that if we didn't come out and match their
energy, we wouldn't be able to hang in this game." Johnson said. "I
told [the team] that there is no excuse in college basketball to not
have the same energy level every day, for every game. But I didn't
have to tell them that."
He certainlv didn't have to tell senior guard Dan Grunfeld.

Stanford's first nine points to keep
the game close after the Sun Dev
ils jumped out to a 13-6 lead in the
first six minutes of the first half. He
scored all 15 of his points in the pe
riod.
Grunfeld's performance was
matched by that of Sun Devil fresh
man Jeff Pendergraph, who scored
14 of his team's first 22 points on
seven-of-eight shooting before
falling to the floor with a sprained
ankle with 3:39 remaining in the first
half. Pendergraph would not return,
but he led Arizona State in scoring
despite playing only 10 minutes.
The Sun Devils led until 2:54 re
mained in the first half, when Grun
feld banked a shot off the glass from
just outside the key to tie the game
at 28. A Haryasz jumper from the
wing gave Stanford a 35-33 edge
heading into the half.
The second half started slowly
for both teams before Kevin Kruger
and Bryson Krueger, Arizona
State's leading scorers, went to
work. Kevin Kruger nailed an open
three to give Arizona State a 40-39
lead 4:35 into the half. Bryson
Krueger sank two short jumpers on
consecutive possessions and nailed
a three to close out a 14-4 Sun Devil
run. during which the Cardinal com
mitted four turnovers.
Then Haryasz took over. He
blocked a shot, ran the break, got
the ball back and dunked it. He
made three jumpers, two of the
turnaround variety, on Stanford's
next four possessions to give the
Cardinal the lead.
It was a nice win for Haryasz,
who was playing in front of a num
ber of family members. It was also a
crucial victory for the Cardinal,
who are only one game back in a
crowded Pac-10 race in which six
teams are within one game of the
top spot.
Hernandez was bothered by a
bad back throughout the game at
Arizona State, a recurring injury
that he attributed in part to fatigue;
he played 39 minutes against Ari
zona after practicing at less than full
speed in recent weeks.
Hernandez played 30 minutes
against the Sun Devils but scored
only nine points to go with two as
sists, well below his season averages.
Freshman guard Mitch Johnson
picked up the slack, notching a ca
reer-high six assists.
Tests over the weekend revealed
that sophomore forward Peter
Prowitt, who hasn't played since
Jan. 13, is suffering from bone bruis
es in his back. He is tentatively
scheduled to return to practice
today after sitting out last week.

■ Card rebound to pull away in the second
half of a closely-fought game against ASU

After Stanford's draining overtime loss to Arizona on Hiursday.
the question of whether the team had anything left in the tank
popped up yetagain with 11 minutes remaining in the second half

on Saturday.
