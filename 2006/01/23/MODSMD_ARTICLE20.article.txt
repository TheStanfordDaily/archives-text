■ Card rebound to pull away in the second
half of a closely-fought game against ASU

After Stanford's draining overtime loss to Arizona on Hiursday.
the question of whether the team had anything left in the tank
popped up yetagain with 11 minutes remaining in the second half
and the Cardinal trailing Arizona State, 48-41, at Wells Fargo Arena
on Saturday.

But senior center Matt
Haryasz, playing his last colle
giate game in his home state,
provided the much-needed fuel
and propelled the team to a 70-
64 victory. He scored on the
perimeter, at the line and in the
paint, pouring in 10 of Stan
ford's next 14 points — all part
of a 14-3 run that gave the Car
dinal (8-7, 4-3 Pacific-10 Con
ference) a 55-54 edge with 6:08
left to play.
After the Sun Devils (7-10,1-
7) tied the score at 61 with just
over two minutes remaining,
Haryasz converted a three
point play, taking a pass from
senior guard Chris Hernandez
and kissing the ball off the glass
for the last of his career-high 27
points, 17 of which came in the
second period.

FINAL RETURN
Matt Haryasz
In the senior forward's final
game in his home state of
Arizona, Haryasz made his
mark, setting his Stanford
career-best for points scored
in a game with 27 against
Arizona State on Saturday.
On the offensive and defen
sive end of the floor, Matt has
anchored ihe Cardinal at
tack this season.

"When a fellas feeling it,you've got to keep giving him the hall ,"
Hernandez said. "And he was feeling it."
Haryasz's contributions didn't only come on the offensive end.
With 25 seconds left to play and Arizona State down by two. Sun
Devil guard Kevin Kruger drove the lane. Haryasz, in danger of
picking up his fifth foul, altered the shot. Kruger missed, Arizona
State forward Serge Angounou was whistled for traveling after he
fell to the floor with the loose ball, and the Cardinal escaped with
their first road win of the season and a much-needed Pac-10 victo
ry-
"lt feels awesome to play here," Haryasz said. "It was a special
game for me. and I'm glad we got the win."
Haryasz joked that it would have been a more memorable trip if
Stanford had beaten the Wildcats as well, but Arizona and Arizona
State defenders should have no trouble remembering the 52 com
bined points he scored against the two teams.
Because they were playing in a small.sparsely crowded arena —
a world away from Arizona's rollicking McKale Center — head
coach Trent Johnson might have been concerned that the Cardinal
would have trouble sustaining their intensity for 40 minutes.
"We knew coming in that if we didn't come out and match their
energy, we wouldn't be able to hang in this game." Johnson said. "I
told [the team] that there is no excuse in college basketball to not
have the same energy level every day, for every game. But I didn't
have to tell them that."
He certainlv didn't have to tell senior guard Dan Grunfeld.
