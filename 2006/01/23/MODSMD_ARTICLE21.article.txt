# The 						benefits of writing uninformed
## 
### 
It's funny what people get riled up about. That's
what I was thinking as I was riding from theTUc
son airport to my hotel this weekend to cover the
men's basketball team for The Daily in a van, driven
by a guy named Wayne, that smelled like someone
had chain-smoked in it as recently as five minutes
before I got in. (Probably Wayne.)
He was listening to conservative talk show host
Michael Savage and laughing along with it. turning
back to me every once in a while to make sure that 1
was enjoying his selection. 1 especially remember
him doing this after Savage had referred to Arabs as
"soulless people wearing dirty tablecloths." I expect
ed him to say the same of hippies, but maybe that
was implied.
I was relieved when they cut to commercial after
Savage started making a list of people whom he
thought the U.S. government should put into intern
ment camps. He started with the leadership of the
American Civil Liberties Union and moved on to
every non-American citizen before the radio station
cut him off, presumably because it was afraid that it
wouldn't have any listeners left by the time Savage
was through.
I'm sure he gets plenty of e-mails about his show.
Anyone who writes a book called "Liberalism is a
Mental Disorder" should expect as much.
As a spineless (not to mention mentally disor
dered) liberal. 1 have never tried to take a stance
about anything in my column, with the exceptions of
former White Sox owner Charles Comiskey, who has
been dead for 75 years, and violence, which most
people agree is to be avoided.
But while Savage can probably anticipate the let
ters he gets, I have been surprised by the responses
I've received to columns I've written over the course
of this volume. They have ranged from prophetic to
lunatic, and 1 would like to share some of them here.
In my first column, I referred in passing to former
Stanford Indians mascot Timm Williams, who per
formed traditional tribal dances on the sidelines at
football games for 18 years, as "a guy who called
himself Prince Lightfoot." A1 Kirkland, a defensive
tackle on the 1952 Stanford Rose Bowl team, wrote
to defend Williams, saying that "guy" is a bit of an
understatement for someone who represented his
culture, without pay. for nearly two decades.
We started corresponding, and a few weeks later
I found myself at the team's 54th year reunion din
ner, talking to some of the players and debating
whether the word Cardinal is plural or singular with
Bob Mathias, a two-time decathlon winner and for
mer U.S. Congressman. I knew this column would
take me places.
After I wrote an article that mildly criticized the
Yankees, a Yankee fan named Lisa wrote me a
tongue-in-cheek e-mail asking what I would say
when her team signed Johnny Damon. I haven't
written her back yet.
Th%largest number of e-mails I've received came
after a column in which I made fun of the Stanford
football team. But none of them were from Stanford
fans. Strangely (and sadly), all 19 of them came from
BYU die-hards, fora side-comment I made about
BYU being a weak team (As you have probably re
alized by now. I 'm not much of a fact-checker).
Most of the e-mails began with "Hey [insert fa
vorite epithet here]," included some expletives and
suggestions about where I can put my opinions, as well
as other things, and concluded by saying that I have no
future in journalism, which I couldn't do much to re
fute. One of them even went line-by-line through my
article and pointed out all the parts that weren't funny,
backing up each claim with a detailed explanation.

Go Robber Barons!
Needless to say, I took notes.
I'm always amused and surprised
by what people respond to. Every
one brings their own background
and interests to the table, creating a
dialogue that is at times fascinating
and at others, maddening.
By tossing out uninformed opin
ions, I have learned a whole lot more
that I would have had I been factual
ly accurate. For instance, that the
USC "V" doesn't actually stand for
"Victory," but was originally the sign
that bowmen in the Trojan War
made when returning from battle to
signify that they hadn't been cap
tured, in which case they would have

had their fingers cut off. After all. the
Trojans lost the war. (Thank you,
Christina Moore).
So to crazies like Michael Savage,
I say: Keep talking, dude. It gets peo
ple thinking about why, for example,
internment camps in fact are not a
very good idea, something they
might not have had to consider oth
erwise. Dialogue is something we
could always use more of.
This will be my last column this
year. I would like to thank Jessica
Peters, Scott Allen and Joel Stein for
their inspiration. I would also like to
thank you for reading.
Unless you're a BYU football
fan.

Even though Sean Howell won't be
writing a column next volume, feel fret
to e-mail him nt showell@stanford.edu.
He'd really appreciate it.
