# Stanford scores needed victory
## After being beaten soundly by Illinois last week, the Cardinal win over Bakersfield 
### DENIS GRIFFIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Cardinal may not have admit
ted it, but they needed a win Friday
night against Cal State Bakersfield.
After Illinois swept the Stanford
wrestlers a week before, the team had
to find some shred of hope in Friday's
dual — a daunting task considering
Stanford's abysmal 2-25 all-time
record against Bakersfield going into
the contest.
But with strong showings from
younger team-members and seasoned
veterans alike, the Cardinal bounced
back for their first dual meet win over
the Roadrunncrs since the 2001-02
season.
From the start, it was a different
Cardinal team wrestling the Bakers
field Roadrunners — far superior to
the one fans saw the previous week
against the Illini. Stanford (4-3,1 -0 Pa
cific 10 Conference) took a dominat

ing early lead, with six wins in a row to
start the competition. ITie Cardinal
then held on late for the 27-14 team
victory over Bakersfield (2-4,1-2).
It was youth that got the Cardinal o
ff to a solid start. Sophomores Josh
Zupancic and Scott Loescher. at 149
and 165 pounds, respectively, both
took convincing wins over their Bak
ersfield opponents. Zupancic's deci
sion and Loescher's pin put the Cardi
nal up 9-0 after the first two matches,
with senior captain Ray Blake to fol
low at lf>s-pounds.
"The biggest thing in any sport is
momentum," Stanford head coach
Kerry McCoy said. "Josh had a big
win. fie went out there and dominated
his guy. l"hen Scott got a big pin and set
Ray up to come in. ITiey just kept
building momentum."
Blake's match proved to be some
what of a turning point for the Cardi
nal. It was among the closest and hard
est fought bouts of the evening, in a
matchup of strength versus strength.
In the end, Blake won 7-5 over Bak
ersfield's Brian Busby, who came into
the match ranked fourth in the Pac-10
— one spot above Blake.
"That was definitely one of the

must-win matches in terms of getting
us in a position to win." McCoy said.
"Overall, it's great to sec Ray contin
ue to go out there and improve."
McCoy also pointed out that
Blake's victory came against an oppo
nent who had beaten him earlier in the
year. The victory would affect Blake's
individual standing in the I'ac 10.
"Fveryday he's getting better,"
McCoy said. "He's avenged three or
four losses that he's had this year, so
we know that he's moving in the right
direction, l or the dual.yes.it was a big
swing match. For his individual sea
son, it was a big match. And it was big
for the team knowing that we're doing
the right thing. So that match was a
defining moment in a lot of areas."
Stanford kept right on rolling after
Blake's match, with wins from 174-
pound freshman I.uke Feist, IK4
pound senior captain Ryan llagen
and junior lan Bork.
llagen won his first dual meet match
of the season, after an early season
knee-injury had slowed his training.
Bork collected the second of the Car
dinal pins for the night and put Stan
ford on top 24-0.
Despite a slow finish to the

evening, as only 125-pound sopho
more captain Fanner Gardner cap
tured a victory in the final four bouts,
the Cardinal had clearly come a long
way since their defeat by Illinois.
"We talked to them after the Illinois
match about believing in themselves,"
McCoy said. " Ihe whole theme of the
season is to believe in ourselves. If we
work hard enough we should be able to
go out there and show it So that was a
realization — that we just have to go
out there and do it."
Ihe Cardinal can only hope that a
big win over a team they've struggled
against in the past is a sign of good
things to come.
"For guys like Ray and Ryan,
who've been on the team for four or
five years to have never come out with
a win, this is a huge thing." McCoy
said."We had a good energy level and
support from the fans who came out.
Hie more we can do, the more atten
tion we'll get and the better the pro
gram will do overall."
Stanford's next test comes tonight
against CSIJ l ullerton in the Cardi
nal's second conference contest of the
season. Ihe match is scheduled to
begin at 7 p.m. in Burnham Pavilion.

year. The victory would affect Blake's
individual standing in the I'ac 10.
"Fveryday he's getting better,"
McCoy said. "He's avenged three or
four losses that he's had this year, so
we know that he's moving in the right
direction, l or the dual.yes.it was a big
swing match. For his individual sea
son, it was a big match. And it was big
for the team knowing that we're doing
the right thing. So that match was a
defining moment in a lot of areas."
Stanford kept right on rolling after
Blake's match, with wins from 174-
pound freshman I.uke Feist, IK4
pound senior captain Ryan llagen
and junior lan Bork.
llagen won his first dual meet match
of the season, after an early season
knee-injury had slowed his training.
Bork collected the second of the Car
dinal pins for the night and put Stan
ford on top 24-0.
Despite a slow finish to the

evening, as only 125-pound sopho
more captain Fanner Gardner cap
tured a victory in the final four bouts,
the Cardinal had clearly come a long
way since their defeat by Illinois.
"We talked to them after the Illinois
match about believing in themselves,"
McCoy said. " Ihe whole theme of the
season is to believe in ourselves. If we
work hard enough we should be able to
go out there and show it So that was a
realization — that we just have to go
out there and do it."
Ihe Cardinal can only hope that a
big win over a team they've struggled
against in the past is a sign of good
things to come.
"For guys like Ray and Ryan,
who've been on the team for four or
five years to have never come out with
a win, this is a huge thing." McCoy
said."We had a good energy level and
support from the fans who came out.
Hie more we can do, the more atten
tion we'll get and the better the pro
gram will do overall."
Stanford's next test comes tonight
against CSIJ l ullerton in the Cardi
nal's second conference contest of the
season. Ihe match is scheduled to
begin at 7 p.m. in Burnham Pavilion.
