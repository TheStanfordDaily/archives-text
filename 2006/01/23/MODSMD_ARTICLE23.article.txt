games between the Cardinal and

Despite being down by a season-high
13 points with 6:46 left in the first half. No.
14 Stanford clawed back against No. 15
Arizona State on the play of Candice Wig
gins. Wiggins' 33 points, and a crucial
three-pointer by senior guard Krista Rap
pahahn in the final three minutes ensured
Saturday's Cardinal victory over the Sun
Devils, 84-78.
"The thing about the game of basket
ball is it is always about runs and spurts,"
said Wiggins,a sophomore guard."Getting
the tie really did change things, because it
got the crowd back into it but I think
Rapp's three down the stretch was the
biggest play of the game."
For most of the first half, Arizona
State (15-4, 5-4 Pacific 10 Conference)
out-battled Stanford (13-4.8-1) by being
more aggressive, especially on the glass.
Senior forwards Kristin Kovesdy and
Amy Denson led the Sun Devils with
four rebounds apiece in the first half.
Arizona State went into the break with
21 boards while the Cardinal could only
get 12 of their own.
"You can't print some of the things I
was thinking," said head coach Tara Van-
Derveer about her defense's first half.
"I'm not happy about the rebounding,
and 1 think our team will be angry about
it all week. But Candice and Brooke
[Smith] put the team on their back. The
second half was the most intense 20 min
utes of the season so far. This was a tour
nament game of tough, smash-mouth
basketball. [We won because] we became
the aggressor."
Stanford turned to its recipe for success
in the second half â€” a steady dose of jun
ior center Smith who led the team with 15
field goal attempts. Wiggins' scoring and
Rappahahn from outside. The Cardinal
also compensated for their rebounding by
forcing 14 turnovers in the second half.
"You've got to take it to them; you can't
be a reactor," freshman point guard Ros
alyn Gold-Onwude said. "1 needed to do
my part and put more pressure on the ball."
The Cardinal were able to take advan
tage of the Sun Devils physicality through
out the contest as they went 26-31 from the
charity stripe, while Arizona State only

took 10 free throws. One particularly ag
gressive foul was called on junior forward
Emily Westerberg. Hie preseason all-Pac
-10 selection took Wiggins down to the
hardwood on a lay-up attempt with under
a minute to go and was given a technical
foul.
"When people climb all over you. you
have to take advantage of it." Wiggins said.
"1 like it when teams are physical."
After shooting seven of 11 to start the
game, the Cardinal offense sputtered dur
ing a nine-minute span, and Arizona State
took advantage with a 21-5 run.
"When we were the more aggressive
team we were winning." Sun Devils' head
coach Charli Ilirner Thorne said. "We
knew it would come down to Smith and
Wiggins. They hit big shots down the
stretch and we didn't execute.The biggest
turning point in the game was when we
turned the ball over."
Arizona State was able to keep its lead
at around five or six points for the majori
ty of the night. The game appeared to be
turning when a Wiggins three-pointer
brought Stanford within three with 1:19
remaining in the first half. However, the
Sun Devils fired right back with a three
pointer of their own by freshman guard
Danielle Orsillo. Smith ran out to cover
the shot and hit Orsillo as she fell. The
freshman missed her first attempt at con
verting the four-point play but made her
second after a lane violation.
The Cardinal finally broke through
with 6:36 left in the game, as Smith made
back-to-back lay-ups and then Wiggins
stole the ball at half court and easily laid it
in fora 64-60 lead.
Hie final blow came with 2:47 as Rap
pahahn, who had missed her last four at
tempts from behind the arc received a
kick-out pass from Gold-Onwude and
drained a three-pointer from the left side.
"Rapp has hit big shots for us all year
and she did again today." Smith said. "I
have such confidence in her shooting that
every time she shoots 1 think it's going in."
With the victory, the Cardinal remain
on top of the Pac-10. while Arizona State
falls three games back of the leaders.
"We go 9-0 from here." Thorne said.
"We've seen every team and we know
what we have to do. 9-0 is our goal, and
whether we do it or not remains to be
seen."
Next weekend the Cardinal head to Los
Angeles to face IJCLA (10-8,5-4) and USC
(13-5,7-3) on Friday, Jan.27 at 7:00 p.m. and
Sunday. Jan. 29 at noon, respectively.
