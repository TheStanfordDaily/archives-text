## Win and loss mark up-and-down week Cardinal follow three-game sweep of UC-San Diego with four-game loss to Long Beach 
### ANDREW LOMELI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 15 Sanford men's volleyball team saw
both extremes of the spectrum this past week, losing
to the country's top-ranked squad only one night after
sweeping the conference's last-place team.
The Cardinal dealt UC-San Diego ;i 30-25,30-27,
30-26 loss Thursday night before dropping ;i 30-22,30-
21,27-30,30-22 decision to No. 1 long Beach State
Friday at Maples Pavilion.
Long Beach (7-0.3-0 MPSF) dominated Stanford
in games one and two, out-hitting the Cardinal .4(H) to
. KM) and .379 to .320. Stanford attempted to challenge
the 49ers' middle blockers early on. but the visitors ad
justed by making their strong outside hitters the focal
point of their attack. Unable to block the outside, the
Cardinal (2-6.1-3 MPSF) quickly found themselves in
deep deficits and incapable of climbing back.
"We're just playing to get better each day." head
coach Don Shaw said. "We have a lot of work to do.
Technically, we got some weaknesses. Long Beach,
being as good a team as they are. exploited some of
those weaknesses."
Game three was a different story for Stanford, who
mixed around the lineup with the addition of freshmen
setter Miki Groppi and junior middle-blocker Bran
don Williams.The team looked like a different group,
establishing its largest lead of the match at 17-10.
The 49crs clawed back to within one in the game's
closing moments at 27-26. but a combination of late
Long Beach hitting errors and a kill from senior out
side hitter William Clayton sealed the deal for Stan
ford
"We made a couple of changes in the lineup, and I
think they gave us a little more enthusiasm out there."
Shaw said. "Guys got really fired up. We served a lot
tougher and passed a lot better. We did a much better
job passing and serving in the later games, but those
guys inserted a lot of energy into the lineup."
The 49ers never trailed in game four, leading by as
many as eight. Stanford continued to fight, but the na
tion's top offense proved too much for the Cardinal as
Long Beach's Tyler Hildebrand notched a kill to put
the match away.
Senior opposite Ben Reddy again fueled Stan
ford's attack with IK kills. Groppi collected 35 sets,
and the Cardinal hit .264 collectively, while the 49ers"

Sophomore middle-blocker Matt Ceran goes fora kill following a set by freshman Miki Grop
pi against Long Reach State. Groppi was instrumental in the game three win against the 49ers.
Robert Tarr nabbed 21 kills as Long
Beach hit .403.
"We came out flat in game four,
probably because we were carried
away with the win in game three,"
Reddy said. "We just need to put to
gether an entire match of good play.
[The 49ers) are the top team in the
country, and there's a lot we can
learn from playing against them.
They do a lot of things well that we
need to work on."

One night before falling to Long
Beach, Stanford made easy work of
last-place UC-San Diego (0-5, 0-3
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation).
The first game saw the two teams ex
change blows before the Cardinal es
tablished a permanent lead at 19-18.
The second game featured five ties,
including one late in the game, at 26-
26. Sophomore outside hitter Jesse
Meredith's kill allowed Stanford to
escape with the victory.

The Cardinal responded to the
Tritons' early game-three advantage
by posting their own 15-9 lead.
UCSD climbed to within two at 26-
24 before kills from Meredith and
Reddy iced the game.
Reddy notched 14 kills to lead the
match, while Meredith collected 12.
UCSD's ( hi is Sayers' 10 kills led the
Tritons.
"We played pretty well, but I
think we can absolutely do better,"

Groppi said. "We played with enthu
siasm. We are going to keep working
during the week and get better with
every single practice. 1 believe in this
team, I believe in this environment,
and I believe in these guys."
Shaw echoed Groppi's optimism.
"We're going to keep working at
it,"he said. "We're going to try to get
better. We're a very inexperienced
team, so with every match we're
gaining valuable experience."
