# Muslim Comic Skewers Stereotypes
## Usman pushes limits with Muslim jokes

"I have a raw deal because if I give a
bad performance tonight, the headline
in the school paper tomorrow will read
Muslim comic bombs," and even if I do
well the headline will read 'Muslim
comic kills...the audience explodes with
laughter,"' quipped American-Muslim
comedian Azhar Usman to a sold out
crowd during last night's Bin Laughin'
held at Annenberg Auditorium.
Terrorist suspects and language bar
riers were fair game during the standup
routine performed by Usman. Known as
the "Ayatollah of Comedy," Usman
founded the "Allah Made Me Funny"
tour in 2004.
The show brought together students
both Muslim and not, though it focused
on many issues relating to the Muslim-
American community.
"It was more of a turnout than what
we expected, in terms of size and the di
versity of the crowd," said senior Moham
mad Subeh.vice president of the Muslim
Student Awareness Network (MSAN).
"Hopefully, this will promote more dis
cussion about issues relevant to the Mus
lim-American community. The show was
geared toward a diverse audience."
Usman was also pleased with the
crowd's reception of his act.
"I am completely overwhelmed to re
ceive a standing ovation, especially from
such a diverse audience," Usman said. "I
gathered it was about half Muslims and
half not, or maybe even more non-Mus
lims. To begin branching out to play
more diverse and more mainstream
crowds helps me grow as a comedian, so

I consider it a tremendous honor."
Usman said he also hoped to make a
statement about the dual identity of
Muslim-Americans.
"i feel that as a comic I'm sometimes
talking out of two sides of the mouth," he
said. "One is speaking to fellow Muslims
from around the world and telling them
that I 'ma Muslim just like you, but guess
what? I'm also an American and I'm not
going to apologize for that. The other
side of the mouth is speaking to my fel
low Americans to whom I wish to say
that I'm an American just like you, but
guess what? I'm also Muslim and I 'm not
going to apologize for that."
Freshman Russell Guajardo, who at
tended the show, said he appreciated the
broad appeal of the night's content.
"I thought it was really interesting
because most comedians wouldn't go
into some of the areas that he went into,"
he said. "I thought he did a good job in
cluding everyone in the audience too.
He wasn't just going for the Muslim au
dience. I could relate to some of those
situations."
Freshman Liane Al-Ghusain said she
enjoyed the show because it hit close to
home.
"I was very intrigued by the genre,"
she said. "I just wanted to hear a differ
ent point of view. There were a lot of
things that rang true. It was like 'My Big
Fat Greek Wedding' for us Muslims."
Pakistanis at Stanford (PaS) coordi
nated most of the event, with the help of
the MSAN.
"I thought it was a huge success," said
PaS president Uzair Nasim, a junior. "It
was sold out, so it was good. It touched
on issues that are really controversial
right now and it touched on stereotypes
that are mostly untrue. We hope people
realize that the way the media paints
Muslims isn't really accurate."
Nasim said he was excited to bring

such a famous figure to come to Stan
ford.
"A lot of our members had heard
clippings of Usman's comedy act and
had found him to be very funny," he said.
"We were also impressed by his cover
age in leading publications and channels
like The New York Times, BBC, The
Washington Post, TIME, The Daily
Show with John Stewart and so on.
Usman has also performed to much ac
claim in other countries around the
world."
Usman was also enthusiastic about
the opportunity to come to Stanford.
"It's an honor to perform for any
crowd but especially fora highly sophis

ticated and intelligent audience at a
prestigious university," he said. "I pride
myself on striving to put out comedy
that makes you laugh and think. So. I fig
ured what better place to do that than
Stanford University."
Usman championed the personal na
ture of his comedy, both for himself and
his audience.
"If I have an audience that has come
to sincerely listen to what I have to say
and they haven't prejudged me and what
I'm talking about. I've always found that
there's something special about that
connection." he said. "Everything I talk

about is what we might say 'inspired
from a true story.' I believe that my
comedy does come from a very per
sonal place which is probably why if
a show goes well I feel a truly inti
mate connection with the audience."
Nasim said that the goal of PaS
and MSAN in bringing Usman to
Stanford was to highlight common
misconceptions about the Muslim
community. He hoped that the audi
ence could apply the show's mes
sage in the broader context of their
lives.
"Our main motive for organizing
the event was to basically joke about
the absurd nature of some of the
stereotypes about Muslims in the
U. 5.," he said. "We hope to use
humor to remind ourselves that the
Muslim living across the hall in our
dorm or in our neighborhood is just
as friendly and open-minded as any
other community member. At a
more basic level, we're also just try
ing to show that Muslims laugh as
well."
