Stanford's impending third annual South Asian Awareness
Week attempts to answer the question: what does it take to suc
ceed? Presented by Sanskriti, Stanford's South Asian Organi
zation, themed "a South Asian Success Story," will run from
Monday Jan. 23 to Friday Jan. 27.
"This year, we wanted to make the theme as general as pos
sible," said sophomore Vineeta Agarwala, co-organizer of the
event. "We wanted to shed light not only on how South Asians
are unique culturally, but how they are unique professionally."
The program features speakers from diverse fields rang
ing from the film industry to politics, and includes some high
profile guests. Dinner will also be served at every event. Se
nior Ankit Garg, co-chair of Sanskriti. said he feels the pro
gramming represents a wide variety of professions that inter
est students.
"The goal is for people who attend to get a sense for what
they feel the contributions of South Asians have been to the
community they live in," Garg said. Whether it be in entertain
ment or medicine, or if the next face they see in Congress is a
South Asian face. People will just get a sense of what this com
munity has done for society as a whole."
On Wednesday, Jan. 25, Anmol Mahal, president of the Cal
ifornia Medical Association, will deliver a speech, which Garg
anticipates will draw a large audience.
"Stanford has a lot of pre-meds in the South Asian commu
nity," Garg said. "It will be an inspiration to any aspiring pre
med. South Asian or not, to hear what he has to say."
Sophomore Ankur Gupta, a member of Sanskriti, said he
agrees that Mahal's lecture will appeal to a large demo
graphic.
"There are quite a few South Asians in the medical field or
who are interested in medicine, so I think having that speaker
will attract a lot of people," Gupta said. "I'm definitely going to
that night. A man of his caliber is hard to get."
Another high-profile event is Friday's teaser-montage of
the upcoming film "Americanizing Shelley." It will be accom
panied by a panel, including the president of Bollywood film
production and distribution company UTV-North America.
Agarwala said she and other organizers tried to invite
speakers who would attract a large sector of the student popu
lation.
