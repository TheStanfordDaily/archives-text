## Democrats stall Alito's appointment Opposition seeks to prove judge's views don't represent U.S. 
### JEREMY JACOBS 
After a week of Judicial Committee debates and
various public appearances. Senate Democrats
have finally laid out their game plan in opposition
to the confirmation of Judge Samuel A. Alito to the
U.S. Supreme Court.
In an unexpected move, the Democrats on the
Senate Judiciary Committee asked for the Com
mittee vote to be postponed until this comingllies
day — seeking more time to present their objec
tions to Alito's testimony of the previous week. Re
publicans, like Committee Chairman Arlen
Specter (R-Pa.), were angered by the Democrats'
request, citing a former agreement between the
parties for the vote to occur two Fridays ago. These
Democrats, however, claimed no such agreement
existed.
While members of both parties agree Alito will
be confirmed. Democrats hope to delay his confir
mation — which will be viewed as a Republican
victory — for as long as possible. Ideally, they want
the Senate vote to occur after the upcoming State
of the Union address on Jan. 31.
In particular. Democrats expressed their con
cern with Alito's views on the Supreme Court's
role as a check on executive powers during this past
week's deliberations. Sen. Patrick
Leahy (D-Vt.) and the ranking De
mocrat on the Judiciary Committee,
highlighted these concerns in a re
cent talk he gave at Georgetown
Law School.
"There is no reason to believe
that Judge Alito will serve as an ef
fective check and balance on govern
ment intrusion into the lives of
Americans," he said. "Indeed, his
record suggests otherwise."
Amid the recent National Securi
ty Agency wire-tapping scandal, ex
ecutive powers have become a chief
interest for Democrats. Leahy posed
the following questions in his
speech:
"Can this president or any presi
dent order illegal spying on Ameri
cans?" he questioned the crowd."Can
this president or any president defy
our laws and Constitution to hold
American citizens in custody indefi
nitely without anv court review?"

After the speedy confirmation of
now Chief Justice John Roberts —
who received 78 bipartisan votes —
Democrats hope to highlight what
they feel are ambiguous answers in
Alito's testimony. They also hope
that a lengthy discussion of Alito's
opinions will persuade the country
that his views do not match their
own. Three Democrats who voted
to confirm Roberts have announced
they would oppose Alito's confir
mation— Leahy, Ken Salazar (D-
Colo.) and Max Baucus (D-Mont.).
Republicans are countering the
Democrats efforts already, by run
ning television and radio advertise
ments on Alito's accomplishments
and service to the country. They have
targeted these spots to run specifi
cally in states that President Bush
won in the last election, but that also
have at least one Democratic Sena
tor — North Dakota, South Dakota,
Louisiana and Arkansas.
Advocacy groups such as
NARAL Pro-Choice America are
turning their attention toward lobby
ing Democratic senators to filibuster
the nomination, the only way Democ
rats could conceivably block Alito's

confirmation. Most, including Dianne
Feinstein (D-Calif.) who appeared on
CBS's "Face the Nation" last week,
don't think a filibuster would be ef
fective, since Republicans only need
five votes to attain the 60 needed to
end a filibuster. Only one Democrat,
Ben Nelson of Nebraska, however,
has pledged his support to Alito.
Senator Edward Kennedy (D-
Mass.) expressed the urgency of the
situation.
"This is the vote of a generation,"
he said, "If confirmed, this nominee
will have an enormous impact on our
basic rights and liberties for years
and even decades to come."
