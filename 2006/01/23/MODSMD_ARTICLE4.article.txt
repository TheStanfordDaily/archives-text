### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
A strike planned to begin tomorrow
was averted Friday when workers voted to
accept the terms of a new three-year con
tract with Stanford Hospitals. A federal
mediator helped negotiators find a middle
ground late in the evening on Thursday.
Ilie contract, with significant concessions
on both sides, was ratified by an 87 percent
margin of voting union members from the
Service Employees International Union
Local 715 (SEIU).
"We feel we are moving forward." said
SEIU spokesman John Vellardita. "This is
an agreement that both sides can live
with."
"It's a real win for the SEIU-represent
ed employees," said Hospitals spokes
woman Sarah Staley. "Iliese employees
deserve to be earning these increased
wages and benefits. We are delighted that
the contract was ratified and agreed to. We
are pleased that the 48-hour strike has
been called oft"
The I lospitals made 11th hour conces
sions on health care and job security. Ilie
union conceded on the level of salary in
creases and the extent of recognition
rights at new medical facilities being
opened as part of the Hospitals' ongoing
expansion.
Highlights of the new agreement in

elude increased wages over three years av
eraging at least 12 percent, continued MX)
percent employer-paid health coverage
for employees and their children, 75 per

spouses and KM) percent employer-paid
health coverage for spouses of employees
earning less than $50,(XX) a year. Ilie I los
pitals also agreed to increased retirement
contributions for employees working 15
years or more.
SEIU Spokesman Greg Pullman called
the agreement a win for the union, point
ing to job security agreements and health
care coverage as the most important issues
involved in the negotiation.
Workers making less than $50,000 per
year will be offered fully-paid health care
for dependents in the first year of the con
tract.llie I lospitals had insisted that some
benefit expansions not be phased in until
the second year of the three-year agree
ment. the union said.
"Workers will save well over $1,000 on
health care by moving up fully paid insur
ance for this year." he said.
Both sides compromised on their initial
stances relating to subcontracting, out
sourcing and movement of jobs from one
facility to another.The I lospitals agreed to
give the union 45 days notice in the event
that either Stanford Hospital or Lucile
Packard Children's I lospital decides to
transfer a unionized job from one medical

facility to another. ITie contract specifies
that no union member will be forced to
move to a non-union job at another hospi
tal. Ilie Hospitals also pledged that no
workers will be laid off due to the creation
of a new outpatient clinic in Redwood
City, the union reported.
"With the I lospitals' aggressive expan

about job security," Vellardita said. "We
won improved language that allows nego

nition rights,meaning that theSEIU Local
715 would have automatically represented
certain categories of workers at any new
facilities.
"As a result, we will have to organize
those facilities into the union when they
