# Strike Averted
## STANFORD HOSPITALS AND UNION REACH AN AGREEMENT 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
A strike planned to begin tomorrow
was averted Friday when workers voted to
accept the terms of a new three-year con
tract with Stanford Hospitals. A federal
mediator helped negotiators find a middle
ground late in the evening on Thursday.
Ilie contract, with significant concessions
on both sides, was ratified by an 87 percent
margin of voting union members from the
Service Employees International Union
Local 715 (SEIU).
"We feel we are moving forward." said
SEIU spokesman John Vellardita. "This is
an agreement that both sides can live
with."
"It's a real win for the SEIU-represent
ed employees," said Hospitals spokes
woman Sarah Staley. "Iliese employees
deserve to be earning these increased
wages and benefits. We are delighted that
the contract was ratified and agreed to. We
are pleased that the 48-hour strike has
been called oft"
The I lospitals made 11th hour conces
sions on health care and job security. Ilie
union conceded on the level of salary in
creases and the extent of recognition
rights at new medical facilities being
opened as part of the Hospitals' ongoing
expansion.
Highlights of the new agreement in

elude increased wages over three years av
eraging at least 12 percent, continued MX)
percent employer-paid health coverage
for employees and their children, 75 per
cent employer-paid health coverage for
spouses and KM) percent employer-paid
health coverage for spouses of employees
earning less than $50,(XX) a year. Ilie I los
pitals also agreed to increased retirement
contributions for employees working 15
years or more.
SEIU Spokesman Greg Pullman called
the agreement a win for the union, point
ing to job security agreements and health
care coverage as the most important issues
involved in the negotiation.
Workers making less than $50,000 per
year will be offered fully-paid health care
for dependents in the first year of the con
tract.llie I lospitals had insisted that some
benefit expansions not be phased in until
the second year of the three-year agree
ment. the union said.
"Workers will save well over $1,000 on
health care by moving up fully paid insur
ance for this year." he said.
Both sides compromised on their initial
stances relating to subcontracting, out
sourcing and movement of jobs from one
facility to another.The I lospitals agreed to
give the union 45 days notice in the event
that either Stanford Hospital or Lucile
Packard Children's I lospital decides to
transfer a unionized job from one medical

facility to another. ITie contract specifies
that no union member will be forced to
move to a non-union job at another hospi
tal. Ilie Hospitals also pledged that no
workers will be laid off due to the creation
of a new outpatient clinic in Redwood
City, the union reported.
"With the I lospitals' aggressive expan
sion plans, we had significant concerns
about job security," Vellardita said. "We
won improved language that allows nego

tuition.
He complained that the Hospitals re
fused to allow portability of union recog
nition rights,meaning that theSEIU Local
715 would have automatically represented
certain categories of workers at any new
facilities.
"As a result, we will have to organize
those facilities into the union when they

open up," he said.
The union had been asking for
pay increases of more than 20 per
cent over the next three years. The
union said they gave up some of the
salary increases they had wanted for
better benefits.
"The Hospitals' proposal still fell
short," Vellardita said. "The Hospi
tals still did not meet those standards
in the marketplace."
In response, the Hospitals con
tend that the wage increases are
tremendously generous.
"This contract preserves the Hos
pitals' ability to maintain high quali
ty patient care and provides employ
ees substantial wage and benefit in
creases," said Martha Marsh, presi
dent and chief executive officer of
Stanford Hospital & Clinics, and
Christopher Dawes, president and
CEO of the Children's Hospital, in a
statement released Friday.
Unlike the union's contract with
the University, the agreement with
the Hospitals does not permit the re
opening of the contract until its re
negotiation in three years.
The union, citing their by-laws,
declined to disclose the number of
members who voted on the final pro
posal. Vellardita said that "a signifi
cant number of workers participated
and demonstrated."
Members could vote throughout
the day on Friday at the Lucie Stern
Community Center on Middlefield
Road in Palo Alto. The Hospitals did
not allow voting to take place on site,

the union said.
The Hospitals said they were glad
that union leadership finally listened
to employees who they said have
largely been satisfied with their pro
posals since November.
"Had it not been for the educated
and smart voices of the SEIU-repre
sented workers telling their leader
ship that this contract was fair, we
likely would not have this agree
ment," Staley said. "Since the SEIU
broke up with the AFL-CIO last
summer, they have been afraid about
their own organizing abilities. We be
lieved that they have focused on
their larger agenda and not always
on what is right for their employees
at the Hospital."
Union spokesmen said that the
I lospitals' view was "detached from
reality" and that the final agreement
was significantly better than previ
ous offers made since negotiations
began last September. Last week, the
union said it delivered a petition with
1 .(KM) signatures from members de
manding concessions on health care
and job security.
"All in all, for SEIU members this
was a significant contract and strug
gle," Vellardita said. "Our members
held in.The Hospital waged a pretty
intense campaign to persuade union
ized workers to see the light as they
saw it. Our members twice in six
weeks rejected the Hospital's pro
posal."
The Hospitals have stated that
the contract was fair and beneficial

for all stakeholders.
"With this contract, everyone
wins â€” our employees, our patients
and our community," Marsh and
Dawes said. "We value all our em
ployees and are pleased that we
could reach a contract agreement
that is fair and equitable for all."
Jesus Andrade, a dietary food
services worker and chair of the ne
gotiating team for the union, said
that the contract met many of the
union's goals.
"Our members sent a clear mes
sage to the hospital that we needed
family health care this year and im
provements in job security," he said
in a statement. "We are pleased to
say that our message was finally re
ceived by the hospital and a strike
will be averted."
Of the more than B,(XH) workers at
the Hospital, only 1,412 are affected
by the agreement. The negotiators
represented workers in housekeep
ing, food service and nursing assis
tant positions.
SEIU Local 715 continues negoti
ations with the University over re
opened portions of the contract not
set to expire until later this year. Uni
versity and union negotiators met
Friday with the assistance of a feder
al mediator. Negotiations broke off
with what the union called "marginal
progress." No date has been set, but
discussions will resume this week.
The negotiating team for the SEIU
has been empowered by a vote of
workers to call a strike at any time.
