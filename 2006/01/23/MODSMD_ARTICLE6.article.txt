## Snow trips triumph over stormy weather Some trips plagued by traffic, overcrowding and accidents 
### ALLISON DEDRICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The season for snow trips is here again — the past two week
ends have seen dorms across campus packing up to make the trek
to the Tahoe area, leaving the drizzly Stanford climate in search
of powder.
Several dorms, including West Florence Moore Hall, Cedro
and Junipero, took advantage of the three-day weekend over
Martin Luther King Day for their snow trips. While the trips were
successful overall, heavy snow on Saturday, Jan. 14 made trans
portation very difficult.
Junior Charlotte Helvestine, a resident assistant in Cedro,
commented on Saturday's inclement weather.
"We had a lot of skidding and sliding and chain problems and
a few accidents but luckily no permanent damage," she said.
Theo Polan,a freshman in Freshman/Sophomore College who
attended West FloMo's snow trip, called the transportation "an
unmitigated disaster."
On Saturday,he said, the traffic stopped four times to the point
that the vans turned the engine off for an hour. The trip took a
total of 12 hours instead of the usual four.
"We got out of the car and had a snowball fight in the middle
of the interstate," he said.
Despite several transportation snags, residents said they still
had a good time.
"The skiing was awesome," Polan said. "It was unbelievable
snow and pcrfcct conditions, sunny and warm."
Many residents took the opportunity to go downhill skiing,
sledding, ice skating or to simply play in the snow.The freshly-fall
en powder was a benefit for most outdoor activities, but the heavy
winds from the storm on Saturday forced the cancellation of
some activities, such as snow tubing.
For many, the snow was the main attraction, but hanging out
with friends away from campus was also an integral part of the ex
perience.
Emily Cirubert.a freshman in Cedro, said,"lf college is like a
slecpover. snow trip is an even bigger sleepover — it's a lot of
fun."
Junior Donner RA Jasmine Hanifi said she really enjoyed the
times "when we were all hanging out in the kitchen, eating food
and talking."
Most of the problems dorms en
countered were weather-related; oth
ers were relatively minor. Helvestine
said the minivans Cedro rented didn't
hold up well in the storm. Overcrowd
ing also presented an issue.
"Staying clean at Tahoe was the
biggest problem we encountered be
cause the bathrooms were usually oc
cupied," Hanifi said. "Cooking for 80-
plus people was quite a chore, but the
freshmen handled everything really
well, partied responsibly, cleaned up
on time and thoroughly impressed
the staff."
Helvestine agreed that the trip
was a success.

"Overall our trip went very well,
which was definitely a relief because 1
know the staff was very stressed out
in the weeks leading up to the trip,"
she said. "We knew that if anything
went wrong, we had to make the deci
sions for the group, and that's a big re
sponsibility to take on when you're
leading 70 freshmen up to Tahoe for
the weekend."
In past years, some dorms have
been kicked out of their accommo
dations for exceeding their capacity
limits. This has not yet occurred this
year.
Polan said they had six people in
each hotel room — rooms designed
to house four — and that "the hotel
probably knew but just didn't care."
Helvestine said one of the major
differences from past trips was the
ban on alcohol, enforced by Cedro
staff members.

"I really feel like the residents
bonded much more without the alco
hol," she said. "Without the alcohol,
people that don't usually hang out to
gether were mixing, and everyone
seemed very happy."
Helvestine advised other dorms
that pasta is one of the easiest meals
to cook for large numbers of people.
Polan suggested "employing a bus
company that has been to Tahoe be
fore and has experience with snow
and chains." And Grubert reminded
people to bring board games to play
at the house.
Overall, most said they planned to
go on snow trips again in future years.
Gladys Jimenez, a freshman in
Gavilan, called her trip an "unforget
table adventure," adding that it was
the first time she had seen snow other
than man-made snow at Big Bear and
Mammoth.
