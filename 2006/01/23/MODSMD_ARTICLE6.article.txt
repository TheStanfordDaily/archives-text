## Snow trips triumph over stormy weather Some trips plagued by traffic, overcrowding and accidents 
### ALLISON DEDRICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The season for snow trips is here again — the past two week
ends have seen dorms across campus packing up to make the trek
to the Tahoe area, leaving the drizzly Stanford climate in search
of powder.
Several dorms, including West Florence Moore Hall, Cedro
and Junipero, took advantage of the three-day weekend over
Martin Luther King Day for their snow trips. While the trips were
successful overall, heavy snow on Saturday, Jan. 14 made trans
portation very difficult.
Junior Charlotte Helvestine, a resident assistant in Cedro,
commented on Saturday's inclement weather.
"We had a lot of skidding and sliding and chain problems and
a few accidents but luckily no permanent damage," she said.
Theo Polan,a freshman in Freshman/Sophomore College who
attended West FloMo's snow trip, called the transportation "an
unmitigated disaster."
On Saturday,he said, the traffic stopped four times to the point
that the vans turned the engine off for an hour. The trip took a
total of 12 hours instead of the usual four.
"We got out of the car and had a snowball fight in the middle
of the interstate," he said.
Despite several transportation snags, residents said they still
had a good time.
"The skiing was awesome," Polan said. "It was unbelievable
snow and pcrfcct conditions, sunny and warm."
Many residents took the opportunity to go downhill skiing,
sledding, ice skating or to simply play in the snow.The freshly-fall
en powder was a benefit for most outdoor activities, but the heavy
winds from the storm on Saturday forced the cancellation of
some activities, such as snow tubing.
For many, the snow was the main attraction, but hanging out
with friends away from campus was also an integral part of the ex
perience.
Emily Cirubert.a freshman in Cedro, said,"lf college is like a
slecpover. snow trip is an even bigger sleepover — it's a lot of
fun."
Junior Donner RA Jasmine Hanifi said she really enjoyed the
times "when we were all hanging out in the kitchen, eating food
and talking."
