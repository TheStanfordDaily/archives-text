# 1 THE TOP STORY Calls for safety overhaul gather steam after deaths of 14 in West Virginia coal mines

### VICKI SMITH ASSOCIATED PRESS 
CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) â€” In
death, 14 West Virginia coal miners have
achieved something that just a month ago
seemed an unlikely goal: Labor, industry
and lawmakers are united in demanding
that a dangerous subterranean occupation
be made safer.
One day after the bodies of two missing
miners were found in Aracoma Coal's
Alma No. 1 mine at Melville, Gov. Joe
Manchin was crafting legislation that he
wanted lawmakers to approve by Monday
night.
"1 wish we would have done it sooner,"
Manchin told The Associated Press on
Sunday." I know we would have saved lives
in these last two tragedies."
West Virginia's congressional delega
tion and the National Mining Association
and the United Mine Workers of America
said Sunday that they, too, want a major
overhaul of state and federal mine safety
laws.
"This is a time for all of us who share re
sponsibility for mining safety to come to
gether and look for ways to make mining
safer," said Carol Raulston, spokeswoman
for the National Mining Association in
Washington. "We have made dramatic im
provements over the last 15 years, but
there's more to be done."
The bodies of Don I. Bragg, 33, and
Ellery "Elvis" Hatfield, 47, were found
Saturday, two days after a conveyor belt
caught fire inside the Alma mine in south
ern West Virginia. Their deaths came just
weeks after a Jan. 2 mine explosion that led
to the deaths of 12 other miners exposed to
carbon monoxide inside the Sago Mine in
the northern part of the state.
UMW president Cecil Roberts said
Congress and state legislatures must take

steps to ensure existing regulations are
strictly enforced.
"We must also develop new initiatives
that will give every miner a vastly im
proved chance to walk out of a mine after
an accident, alive and well and safe in the
arms of their loved ones," he said.

A Senate Appropriations subcommit
tee scheduled hearings on mine safety
Monday, and Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., who
chairs the Senate Health Education Labor
and Pensions Committee, which oversees
mine safety, also planned a hearing.
Nationally, there were 22 mine deaths

in 2005, a record low. Three of those were
in West Virginia, the nation's second
largest coal producer.
Manchin said his proposals would im
prove rapid response to mine emergencies
and set up electronic tracking technology
for lost miners and reserve oxygen stations
underground. He also plans to meet with
federal lawmakers in Washington.
"We must put into place commonsense
proposals like these that will provide im
proved safety and security for miners and
their families," said Sen. Jeff Bingaman, a
Democrat from New Mexico, which has
the nation's fifth-largest underground coal
mine by tons produced.
IfManchin seffort resultsin federal action,
it could be the third time that a West Virginia
tragedy has had nationwide ramifications.
The Mine Safety and Health Act was
written a year after a 1968 explosion at
Farmington that killed 78 miners, includ
ing Manchin's uncle. Federal laws govern
ing the construction of mine drainage set
tling ponds were adopted after 125 people
where killed when an impoundment gave
way in 1972 and flooded communities
along Buffalo Creek, less than 20 miles
from the Alma mine.
"When people get mad, they're more
likely to do something," said Sen. Jay
Rockefeller, D-W.Va., who was with
Manchin when the families of the Alma
miners were told the men were dead.
"When I go back to Congress ... what's
happened at Sago and what's happened
here, there's got to be a lot of mad people."
The Bush administration is reviewing
safety equipment in mines after scrapping
similar initiatives started by the Clinton
administration. Miners' advocates said
pulling those initiatives stopped potential
ly important safety rules from becoming
reality; the Republicans cited changing
priorities and resource concerns.
