It isn't always clear to people at first that they're right
for the D. E. Shaw group. Like the poet we hired to
head an automated block trading unit. Or the woman
who designs solar-powered race cars; we hired her to
help launch a new venture in computational chem
istry. They didn't think of themselves as "financial
types," and neither did we. We thought of them as
people with extraordinary talent.
The D. E. Shaw group is a highly successful invest
ment and technology development firm with an
international reputation for financial innovation and
technological leadership. Since 1988 we've grown into
a number of closely related entities with approxi
mately US $19 billion in aggregate capital by hiring
unusually smart people from a wide range of back
grounds. A robotics guru. A nationally ranked black
jack player. An operatic mezzo-soprano. And a lot of
people who are just exceptionally strong in CS, EE,
math, and finance.
The firm currently has openings in quantitative
analysis, software development, information tech
nology, computer architecture, business develop
ment, computational chemistry, accounting, finance,
and trading. We're looking for creative but pragmatic
people: articulate, curious, and driven. Our working
environment is intense but surprisingly casual. We
provide unusual opportunities for growth. And we
compensate extraordinary people extraordinarily well.
