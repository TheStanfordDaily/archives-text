# So you want to make it rich...

### 
Mark Zuckerberg was a sophomore at
Harvard when he started the Face
book.com. Within only a few years,
the Facebook has grown to become the ninth
most visited site on the Internet, used by
nearly 5 million college students.
That is nothing to sneeze at. Zuckerberg,
however, was neither an expert programmer
nor an MBA student. He didn't even gradu
ate from college. This begs the question — If
Zuckerberg can create a wildly successful In
ternet startup, why can't you?
As a technology columnist, it is my duty to
ponder such questions. After careful re
search. I have reached the following conclu
sion: all Internet success capitalizes on at
least one of three categories — human lazi
ness, desire for information or primordial
human insecurities. In fact, the entire Inter
net rests on these three pillars of human na
ture. As I will explain, Zuckerberg stumbled
upon a technology that took advantage of
people's inherent insecurities.This is only the
fastest growing of the three models. Once
you understand that people are lazy, desper
ate for information and insecure, you too
may be able to become insanely wealthy at a
young age.
The People-are-Lazy Model
The first batch of successful Internet start-

Ups merely replaced traditional brick-and
mortar business with online alternatives.This
model had its advantages. Simply take some
thing that's already done and turn it into an
Internet site. Given the opportunity people
will gladly avoid jumping into a car and inter
acting with other humans if they can get the
same service or product online. In a sentence,
people are lazy. As a result, Amazon.com re
placed the corner bookstore and i'Rines re
placed the record shop. Netflix is just a digi
tal Blockbuster and Ebay and Craigslist are
the online analogues of auctions and garage
sales. E-mail exists because people are too
lazy to lick envelopes and too impatient to
wait for real mail.
Unfortunately, businesses based on the
people-are-lazy model are by far the most
obvious. As a result, most of the good ones
are already taken. CEOs like Amazon's Jeff
Bezos and Apple's Steve Jobs beat us to it.
Darn. It is hard to find a brick-and-mortar

store that doesn't already have a highly prof
itable digital analog. Foriunately, people also
have an insatiable desire for information.
The People-need-Information Model
The second type of successful Internet
startups gain success because they order the
vast amount of information in the world.
People constantly need information. They
need to find directions, people, facts, organ
izations and institutions. You name it.and
chances are that someone is looking for it.
So companies like Yahoo!, Excite,
MapOuest and AltaVista came along to
help people find information. Then Google
arrived on the scene and blew the pants off
all those companies by making a search en
gine so good, even stupid people could find
the information they needed. Search en
gines like Google have no analog in the
brick-and-mortar world. They are in a busi
ness model unto themselves: the people
need-information model.
But entry into the people-need-informa
tion market can be tricky. Sifting through
petabytes of data on command is no easy
task. It took some very smart people a
whole Stanford Ph D thesis just to figure it
out. Luckily, people are also incredibly in
secure. This is where our friend Zuckerbcrg
comes in.

The People-are-Insecure Model
The most promising area of Internet ex
pansion that which assuages people's insecu
rities. People are lonely. The rapidly growing
$2.5 billion Internet pornography industry
knows this all too well. People want to feel in
control of their lives, image and future. Most
importantly, people want to feel connected,
loved and popular. Only recently have com
panies such as the Facebook been able to so
successfully tap into people's insecurities.
The New York Times reports that the av
erage Facebook user checks the site six times
a day. Why are we college students so addict
ed to it? The Facebook is more than a rolodex
with photos. It provides an exact measure of
our stature, popularity and coolness. It allows
us to place ourselves in a pseudo-fictional
world where everyone we know is pigeon
holed into friend or non-friend. We never
have to worry about our looks because with
enough Photoshopping we can present our
selves exactly how we want to be perceived.
Moreover, everyone on the Facebook is at
the center of a massive web of friends. Un
sure? Click "Visualize my friends" and it will
even draw you a map.
Other successful Internet innovations like
instant messaging are specifically designed to
appeal to our constant need to feel connected
and appreciated. With instant messaging we

can constantly keep in touch with our buddies
without ever worrying about any of the social
awkwardness associated with face-to-face in
teractions. If a conversation goes bad. we can
just type "brb," and we're fine! With instant
messaging — just like with the Facebook —
we can have friends without the hassle and re
sponsibilities that normally comes with them.
This may be a cynical outlook, but there is
plenty of reason for cheer. The targeted ad rev
enue that Zuckerberg is collecting must be un
precedented. Appealing to human insecurities
is an easier way to make money than writing
search engines or actually selling real products.
The Facebook is neither technologically inno
vative nor expensive to design. In fact, my
friend down the hall wrote a fully functional
knock-off — the Enemy Book —in a few
weeks' time, just for kicks. Best of all, there is no
shortage of human insecurities. Tools like the
Facebook won't be going away any time soon.
For those budding hi-tech entrepreneurs
my advice is this: remember that people are
lazy, information starved and insecure. I'd
start a company myself, but first I have to go
update my Facebook account. Best of luck!

Internet site. Given the opportunity people
will gladly avoid jumping into a car and inter
acting with other humans if they can get the
same service or product online. In a sentence,
people are lazy. As a result, Amazon.com re
placed the corner bookstore and i'Rines re
placed the record shop. Netflix is just a digi
tal Blockbuster and Ebay and Craigslist are
the online analogues of auctions and garage
sales. E-mail exists because people are too
lazy to lick envelopes and too impatient to
wait for real mail.
Unfortunately, businesses based on the
people-are-lazy model are by far the most
obvious. As a result, most of the good ones
are already taken. CEOs like Amazon's Jeff
Bezos and Apple's Steve Jobs beat us to it.
Darn. It is hard to find a brick-and-mortar

store that doesn't already have a highly prof
itable digital analog. Foriunately, people also
have an insatiable desire for information.
The People-need-Information Model
The second type of successful Internet
startups gain success because they order the
vast amount of information in the world.
People constantly need information. They
need to find directions, people, facts, organ
izations and institutions. You name it.and
chances are that someone is looking for it.
So companies like Yahoo!, Excite,
MapOuest and AltaVista came along to
help people find information. Then Google
arrived on the scene and blew the pants off
all those companies by making a search en
gine so good, even stupid people could find
the information they needed. Search en
gines like Google have no analog in the
brick-and-mortar world. They are in a busi
ness model unto themselves: the people
need-information model.
But entry into the people-need-informa
tion market can be tricky. Sifting through
petabytes of data on command is no easy
task. It took some very smart people a
whole Stanford Ph D thesis just to figure it
out. Luckily, people are also incredibly in
secure. This is where our friend Zuckerbcrg
comes in.

The People-are-Insecure Model
The most promising area of Internet ex
pansion that which assuages people's insecu
rities. People are lonely. The rapidly growing
$2.5 billion Internet pornography industry
knows this all too well. People want to feel in
control of their lives, image and future. Most
importantly, people want to feel connected,
loved and popular. Only recently have com
panies such as the Facebook been able to so
successfully tap into people's insecurities.
The New York Times reports that the av
erage Facebook user checks the site six times
a day. Why are we college students so addict
ed to it? The Facebook is more than a rolodex
with photos. It provides an exact measure of
our stature, popularity and coolness. It allows
us to place ourselves in a pseudo-fictional
world where everyone we know is pigeon
holed into friend or non-friend. We never
have to worry about our looks because with
enough Photoshopping we can present our
selves exactly how we want to be perceived.
Moreover, everyone on the Facebook is at
the center of a massive web of friends. Un
sure? Click "Visualize my friends" and it will
even draw you a map.
Other successful Internet innovations like
instant messaging are specifically designed to
appeal to our constant need to feel connected
and appreciated. With instant messaging we

can constantly keep in touch with our buddies
without ever worrying about any of the social
awkwardness associated with face-to-face in
teractions. If a conversation goes bad. we can
just type "brb," and we're fine! With instant
messaging — just like with the Facebook —
we can have friends without the hassle and re
sponsibilities that normally comes with them.
This may be a cynical outlook, but there is
plenty of reason for cheer. The targeted ad rev
enue that Zuckerberg is collecting must be un
precedented. Appealing to human insecurities
is an easier way to make money than writing
search engines or actually selling real products.
The Facebook is neither technologically inno
vative nor expensive to design. In fact, my
friend down the hall wrote a fully functional
knock-off — the Enemy Book —in a few
weeks' time, just for kicks. Best of all, there is no
shortage of human insecurities. Tools like the
Facebook won't be going away any time soon.
For those budding hi-tech entrepreneurs
my advice is this: remember that people are
lazy, information starved and insecure. I'd
start a company myself, but first I have to go
update my Facebook account. Best of luck!

Mark Zuckerberg was a sophomore at
Harvard when he started the Face
book.com. Within only a few years,
the Facebook has grown to become the ninth
most visited site on the Internet, used by
nearly 5 million college students.
That is nothing to sneeze at. Zuckerberg,
however, was neither an expert programmer
nor an MBA student. He didn't even gradu
ate from college. This begs the question — If
Zuckerberg can create a wildly successful In
ternet startup, why can't you?
As a technology columnist, it is my duty to
ponder such questions. After careful re
search. I have reached the following conclu
sion: all Internet success capitalizes on at
least one of three categories — human lazi
ness, desire for information or primordial
human insecurities. In fact, the entire Inter
net rests on these three pillars of human na
ture. As I will explain, Zuckerberg stumbled
upon a technology that took advantage of
people's inherent insecurities.This is only the
fastest growing of the three models. Once
you understand that people are lazy, desper
ate for information and insecure, you too
may be able to become insanely wealthy at a
young age.
The People-are-Lazy Model
The first batch of successful Internet start-

Ups merely replaced traditional brick-and
mortar business with online alternatives.This
model had its advantages. Simply take some
thing that's already done and turn it into an
Internet site. Given the opportunity people
will gladly avoid jumping into a car and inter
acting with other humans if they can get the
same service or product online. In a sentence,
