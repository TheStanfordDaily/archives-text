## Editorial Facebook not for employers 
### 
On Friday,The Daily reported on the
development of employers using
personal Facehook.com profiles to
check out job applicants. Students have since
expressed shock and dismay; however, they
probably should have seen it coming. With
so many juicy personal tidbits posted on
Facebook, it was only a matter of time before
employers did a little Facebook stalking of
their own. Nevertheless, we believe that
using Facebook to screen potential candi
dates is a questionable practice.
Employers: Facebook snooping is
unethical and illegal
In this digital age, employers can easily
find out more information about you than
you would care to reveal during a job inter
view. Your future employer can Google you,
surf your Web site and read your blog to re
search more about you. While such extensive
background checks are distasteful, they are
not illegal. Information posted on Web sites
and blogs is public and freely available to all,
including nosy corporate recruiters.
Dredging up private information on
Facebook, however, is an entirely different
matter. Facebook is a Web site expressly set
up for personal, noncommercial use. This
makes it unethical for employers to find out
personal information through Facebook, es
pecially if it involves logging in using the ac
count of a Stanford alumni member.
Because of the restricted access to the Web
site (only current students, alumni and com
munity members may log on to Stanford's
Facebook), students feel less inhibited about
posting personal information on Facebook
than on most other online venues. As a result,
employers can find a wealth of sensitive infor
mation about job applicants, including their
political affiliation and sexual orientation.
While asking personal questions about such
traits during an interview is illegal, employers
can obtain all this information and more on
Facebook. Employers could even theoretical
ly use the photographs on the site to screen
candidates on the basis of race or looks.
Admittedly, some employers might be
surfing Facebook profiles merely to satisfy
their curiosity about potential candidates.
Perhaps these recruiters are recent Stanford
alums; having graduated only a few months
ago and still intimately connected to the
Stanford community, they want to find out
more about a candidate's interests and incli
nations, and whether or not they share com
mon friends and college experiences.
Nevertheless, employers who do so may
find their hiring judgments colored by such
information — no matter how objective
they claim to be. We therefore believe that
there is no valid justification for employers
to snoop around on Facebook. Using Face
book profiles to screen job applicants is poor
hiring policy.
Students: Protect yourself with
privacy settings
Although Facebook is ostensibly limited
to the Stanford community, it is all too easy
for employers to gain access to personal pro
files. As such, everyone who uses Facebook

should be aware that by posting private in
formation online, they make such informa
tion available to future employers.
Your job search could be jeopardized by
risque quotes or embarrassing photographs
involving alcohol and varying degrees of
public nudity. Without becoming completely
paranoid, you should consider taking the fol
lowing steps to protect your employability.
• Consider whether or not you are comfort
able with employers viewing all information
on your Facebook profile.This includes per
sonal information like your political affilia
tion and sexual orientation, as well as other
things like your Facebook groups or ran
dom comments on your wall.
•Temporarily remove private information
and photographs before embarking on your
job search. Photographs that have been re
moved or untagged can be uploaded or re
stored at a later date.
• Restrict access to your Facebook profile, al
lowing only your friends to view your per
sonal information. At the very least, stu
dents should consider restricting access to
their profiles by excluding alumni members
until after completing their job search. This
is a very useful privacy setting of which
many students are unaware.
• Decline to comment, or be prepared with a
witty answer, if asked about your Facebook
profile during a job interview.
Facebook: Step up privacy protections
It is tricky for site owners to police a site
like Facebook, which was created to facili
tate cyber-stalking. Yet it is in their commer
cial interest to ensure the privacy of Face
book users. Students need to feel comfort
able representing themselves however they
wish, far from the prying eyes of employers.
Otherwise, students are apt to censor their
profiles, turning Facebook into a collection
of professional resumes.
The site administrators at Facebook need to
make students more aware of all available pri
vacy settings. Periodic advertisements could re
mind students of these options and alert them
to possible access by prospective employers.
The Facebook should also include a poli
cy statement expressly warning employers
against using the site to screen potential can
didates. Students will then have a legal basis
for alleging employment discrimination on
the basis of political affiliation, sexual orien
tation or any other personal information
that could have been made available
through Facebook. The current policy
against noncommercial use, while signifi
cant, seems insufficient.
A large part of Facebook s popularity lies
in its ability to foster a vibrant online com
munity that taps into our society's confes
sional culture. We believe that students
should be allowed to enjoy Facebook re
sponsibly by posting witty quotes and funny
pictures; we hope that site administrators
will do all they can to protect our privacy and
that prospective employers will do all they
can to respect our privacy.

On Friday,The Daily reported on the
development of employers using
personal Facehook.com profiles to
check out job applicants. Students have since
expressed shock and dismay; however, they
probably should have seen it coming. With
so many juicy personal tidbits posted on
Facebook, it was only a matter of time before
employers did a little Facebook stalking of
their own. Nevertheless, we believe that
using Facebook to screen potential candi
dates is a questionable practice.
Employers: Facebook snooping is
unethical and illegal
In this digital age, employers can easily
find out more information about you than
you would care to reveal during a job inter
view. Your future employer can Google you,
surf your Web site and read your blog to re
search more about you. While such extensive
background checks are distasteful, they are
not illegal. Information posted on Web sites
and blogs is public and freely available to all,
including nosy corporate recruiters.
Dredging up private information on
Facebook, however, is an entirely different
matter. Facebook is a Web site expressly set
up for personal, noncommercial use. This
makes it unethical for employers to find out
personal information through Facebook, es
pecially if it involves logging in using the ac
count of a Stanford alumni member.
Because of the restricted access to the Web
site (only current students, alumni and com
munity members may log on to Stanford's
Facebook), students feel less inhibited about
posting personal information on Facebook
than on most other online venues. As a result,
employers can find a wealth of sensitive infor
mation about job applicants, including their
political affiliation and sexual orientation.
While asking personal questions about such
traits during an interview is illegal, employers
can obtain all this information and more on
Facebook. Employers could even theoretical
ly use the photographs on the site to screen
candidates on the basis of race or looks.
Admittedly, some employers might be
surfing Facebook profiles merely to satisfy
their curiosity about potential candidates.
Perhaps these recruiters are recent Stanford
alums; having graduated only a few months
ago and still intimately connected to the
Stanford community, they want to find out
more about a candidate's interests and incli
nations, and whether or not they share com
mon friends and college experiences.
Nevertheless, employers who do so may
find their hiring judgments colored by such
information — no matter how objective
they claim to be. We therefore believe that
there is no valid justification for employers
to snoop around on Facebook. Using Face
book profiles to screen job applicants is poor
hiring policy.
Students: Protect yourself with
privacy settings
Although Facebook is ostensibly limited
to the Stanford community, it is all too easy
for employers to gain access to personal pro
files. As such, everyone who uses Facebook

should be aware that by posting private in
formation online, they make such informa
tion available to future employers.
Your job search could be jeopardized by
risque quotes or embarrassing photographs
involving alcohol and varying degrees of
public nudity. Without becoming completely
paranoid, you should consider taking the fol
lowing steps to protect your employability.
• Consider whether or not you are comfort
able with employers viewing all information
on your Facebook profile.This includes per
sonal information like your political affilia
tion and sexual orientation, as well as other
things like your Facebook groups or ran
dom comments on your wall.
•Temporarily remove private information
and photographs before embarking on your
job search. Photographs that have been re
moved or untagged can be uploaded or re
stored at a later date.
• Restrict access to your Facebook profile, al
lowing only your friends to view your per
sonal information. At the very least, stu
dents should consider restricting access to
their profiles by excluding alumni members
until after completing their job search. This
is a very useful privacy setting of which
many students are unaware.
• Decline to comment, or be prepared with a
witty answer, if asked about your Facebook
profile during a job interview.
Facebook: Step up privacy protections
It is tricky for site owners to police a site
like Facebook, which was created to facili
tate cyber-stalking. Yet it is in their commer
cial interest to ensure the privacy of Face
book users. Students need to feel comfort
able representing themselves however they
wish, far from the prying eyes of employers.
Otherwise, students are apt to censor their
profiles, turning Facebook into a collection
of professional resumes.
The site administrators at Facebook need to
make students more aware of all available pri
vacy settings. Periodic advertisements could re
mind students of these options and alert them
to possible access by prospective employers.
The Facebook should also include a poli
cy statement expressly warning employers
against using the site to screen potential can
didates. Students will then have a legal basis
for alleging employment discrimination on
the basis of political affiliation, sexual orien
tation or any other personal information
that could have been made available
through Facebook. The current policy
against noncommercial use, while signifi
cant, seems insufficient.
A large part of Facebook s popularity lies
in its ability to foster a vibrant online com
munity that taps into our society's confes
sional culture. We believe that students
should be allowed to enjoy Facebook re
sponsibly by posting witty quotes and funny
pictures; we hope that site administrators
will do all they can to protect our privacy and
that prospective employers will do all they
can to respect our privacy.
