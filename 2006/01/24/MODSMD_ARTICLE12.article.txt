# What's your type?

### 
a he's a great guy, hut he's just
I 1 not my type." Every time one of
my girlfriends uses a cliche like
this as an excuse for why her latest boy-toy
isn't quite up to par, I'm tempted to slap her
across the face and give her a much-needed
reality check.
As much as we criticize guys for only being
interested in tall, thin blondes, girls are just as
bad when it comes to classifying men into rigid
categories. We say,"All I want is a nice guy," or
"I love a guy who can make me laugh" or the
classic "Bad boys make me so hot."
I suppose it makes things simpler if you
know what you're looking for (or at least if
you think you know), but deciding what you
want before you are even presented with the
options isn't fair to either side. After all, if all
you're looking for is a "type," what makes
the person you finally choose to be with spe
cial? To assume that everybody falls neatly
into one, and only one, category is to grossly
underestimate the value of individuality.
The ability to fit into a mold — even if it
is the mold of a Greek god — should not be
the first checkmark on your list of "perfect
man" criteria. On second thought, having a
list probably isn't a good idea at all, unless
you want to turn into a crazy old spinster
who, having given up on finding a man who
meets all her qualifications, spends her time
knitting stockings for her houseful of four
legged, litter-box-using "children."
Admittedly, it is fun to imagine what the
perfect man would be like, and I, like every
girl who has ever been to a middle school
slumber party, have written my share of lists
in the past. He'll be smart, funny, handsome,
romantic, rich, always willing to come over
with chicken soup when I'm sick or with
chocolate and roses when it's not even
Valentine's Day... I could go on, but I'm a
busy person; I don't have time to wait
around for Prince Charming to leave Cin
derella and come to the real world.

Even if he did exist, who would really
want to be with that guy? Don't get me
wrong; no girl in her right mind would turn
down the perfect man. but standing next to
him would make anybody feel a little (okay,
a lot) less-than-perfect. Besides,all your girl
friends would hate you for going on about
the romantic seaside picnic he took you on
last weekend, and you would be completely
left out of their "guys are jerks" bitch ses
sions. Where's the fun in that?
Instead, free yourself from that precon
ceived notion of what a love interest should
be. At first, your girlfriends may try to tell
you."He's not your type" (in which case you
should take no shame in slapping them again
for hating on the guy you're head over heels
for),but if you ignore them long enough, you
may find yourself pleasantly surprised. You
could find something great that you weren't
expecting, something that you never even
thought about looking for.
Your perfect match may fall into what
you have categorized as your "perfect type,"
or he may not. But if you limit your options,
you could very well be excluding the one
person who will make you the happiest —
whether he's a good guy or a bad boy, a co
median or a brain surgeon.
The only thing I ask is that he remembers
my birthday.
