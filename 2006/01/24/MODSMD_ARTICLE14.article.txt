# "Ski Tripping at the Gates of Hell"
## 
### 
In a continuing series of how-tos, as in
spired by the Linux Documentation Pro
ject, David explains how to have the best
ski trip of your life.
Obviously, one must get from Stanford to
Tahoe, and it's generally a good idea to make
plans to return as well. If you are in a dorm,
you will probably charter buses to make this
voyage. The buses will be half the size of the
ones promised, the heat won't work, the driv
ers are going to be lecherous drunks and they
will refuse to make pickups from the ski
slopes.
If you live in a house, you may get rental
cars.They will only have two-wheel drive and
the brakes will squeal. The kid who said he
could get his parent's Suburban will show up
with a vintage Beetle. The guy with the ski
rack on his Jeep who wanted to get in a full
two days of skiing — well, he'll be ready to
go. In fact, he'll leave without the residents he
said he was going to take.
You should leave at 2:30 p.m. on Friday to
maximize driving time; after all, it's during
these long college road trips that the impor
tant issues get hashed out — nuclear prolif
eration, the impact of ethnic theme housing
on the Stanford community and which dorm
consistently has the hottest freshman. I am
convinced that if only we could find some
way of creating perpetual college road trips,
in which uninformed opinions are thrown
around like divine facts, we could solve most
of the world's problems. I suggest picking a
topic to debate in advance and finalize it by
sending a proposal to the White House upon
arrival in Tahoe.
It is best if your staff does not confirm the
cabin reservation until they are already on
Highway 50. This is when you find out that
the house is booked for the wrong weekend.
Accept this fact. Plan on it, even. Booking a
house fora random date will probably have
resulted in a higher chance of getting a reser
vation for MLK weekend than any amount
of advance planning, anyway.
One popular and effective solution to this
problem is fora displaced dorm to show up
en masse at the front door of another dorm's
cabin (preferably before the renters get
there) and beg for charity.This can be accom
plished by relying on the kindness of the
other dorm's staff, or with vague promises of
sexual favors. Either one works.
Once people begin trickling into the
house, the dorm should make an effort to
split themselves by social status as quickly as
possible. The cool kids should immediately
stake out a bedroom and revert to being
eight years old by locking the door and com
ing up with a password for entry. The staff
also gets its own room as compensation for
planning this absurd enterprise. Dornicest
couples, no matter how reviled by their fel
low dormmates. will manage to convince
everyone that their lust entitles them to their
own bed. This decision will be regretted by
the kids who end up sleeping under those
beds.
At some point the realization sets in —

being on ski trip is just like spending a week
end in your dorm, albeit a smaller and colder
one, and with a greater potential for major
physical injury. Some popular options for
cabin activities include:
• Puking in the hot tub
Why this activity is so much more popular
than merely sitting in the hot tub wondering if
her breasts are supposed to float like that or
even puking in the bathroom is beyond me.
But it will happen. At least it discourages
people from having sex in the hot tub, which
is a good thing because sex in the hot tub 1)
makes the virgins in the house cry 2) almost
ensures that someone contracts an STD from
the water.
• Ten Fingers
This can be played one of two ways. It can
be played correctly or incorrectly. We'll call
these two styles of play Wilbur and FroSoCo.
The Wilbur rules expressly forbid any ques
tions not involving sex.This inevitably results
in a one-upmanship that ends in questions
like "Never have I ever been walked in on
while having sex with two farm animals." In
an effort not to appear as innocent as you re
ally are, lying about such escapades is per
fectly acceptable. The FroSoCo school of ten
fingers involves confessions like "Never have
I ever taken a CASA class."
• Taboo
Nothing gets Stanford students as com
petitive as this incredibly innocuous game,
and our competitive spirit is only amplified
by alcohol at high altitudes. Why we continue
to play it is beyond me, since we've all played
it enough times to have memorized the list of
possible answers. But that's inconsequential
in the minds of all the desperate boys on ski
trip who feel entitled to a hookup and are
convinced that their attractiveness on a par
ticular night is directly correlated to the total
score they have compiled in the games
played that night.
• Boundary-exploring bisexual orgy (BFBO)
Ski trip is one of the most sexually
charged and least sexually satisfying events
at Stanford (after Full Moon on the Quad,
Exotic Erotic, that French porn class and
TUesday nights). This tension is only height
ened as students are forced to come up with
new ways to sublimate their raging one-sided
sexual desire while sleeping in the same beds
as their objects of infatuation. Half of Tahoe

is in Nevada, which is also home to Vegas.
However, this has absolutely no bearing on
what happens in South Lake Tahoe, Calif.
What happens on ski trip gets broadcasted
via text message five minutes after it hap
pens. Still, I think the BEBO could be the
perfect dorm bonding experience. (And
Ralph Castro could moderate!)
• Not eating
All this repression is bound to make a
man hungry, which is why there will never be
any food in your cabin. Chocolate, trail mix,
five pounds of mustard and two handles of
Popov Vodka, sure. Edible cold cuts? Never.
So it will fall to the dorm mother to cook
enough pasta to feed a small army, which no
one will eat because it won't be done until
everyone has already passed out from mild
alcohol poisoning.
In an effort to be sensitive to those mem
bers of the Stanford community without
legs, we're no longer allowed to call it ski
trip. It's "snow trip" now. But that's irrele
vant and factually incorrect, because really,
everyone goes to Tahoe to ski (or at least
pretend to).
Skiers break off into three groups. Group
1: People who have never skied before and
the experienced skiers who have volunteered
to teach them. Group 2: Members of Sigma
Kappa lota, Austrians, Swiss and Saint
Bernards. Group 3: Everyone else, ranging
from people who skied for the first time on
their freshman year ski trip to kids with a
cabin at Squaw Valley (which is where the
real skiers go, as they will repeatedly tell
everyone within hearing range). Shockingly,
everyone in this group will be at the same
level of proficiency — "Not bad for how
many times I've gone skiing."
Getting everyone back from the slopes
will take hours. No one will stay with the
group of people he or she drove in with and
cell phones won't work, so the martyred staff
will drive white-knuckled back and forth
through Tahoe, in unfamiliar SUVs on unlit,
unpainted roads.
Once everyone has been safely returned
to the house, the whole process can begin
again — only with renewed vigor, since
there's only one night left to make up for lost
games of Taboo, missed opportunities for
hookups... and that jar of mustard isn't going
to eat itself.
Finally, it's not a real ski trip unless
someone goes to the hospital, preferably
minutes before checkout time at the cabin.
Possible scenarios that can make this a real
ity: homemade sled jumps, intimate en
counters with a tree, drinking too much.
Bonus points for requiring an airlift. Major
party foul if anyone dies.

David Blackman was too busy spending this
weekend as a martyred staff member to sleep;
as a result, he will be spending the weekend
dead, for tax purposes. Send love to black

In a continuing series of how-tos, as in
spired by the Linux Documentation Pro
ject, David explains how to have the best
ski trip of your life.
Obviously, one must get from Stanford to
Tahoe, and it's generally a good idea to make
plans to return as well. If you are in a dorm,
you will probably charter buses to make this
voyage. The buses will be half the size of the
ones promised, the heat won't work, the driv
ers are going to be lecherous drunks and they
will refuse to make pickups from the ski
slopes.
If you live in a house, you may get rental
cars.They will only have two-wheel drive and
the brakes will squeal. The kid who said he
could get his parent's Suburban will show up
with a vintage Beetle. The guy with the ski
rack on his Jeep who wanted to get in a full
two days of skiing — well, he'll be ready to
go. In fact, he'll leave without the residents he
said he was going to take.
You should leave at 2:30 p.m. on Friday to
maximize driving time; after all, it's during
these long college road trips that the impor
tant issues get hashed out — nuclear prolif
eration, the impact of ethnic theme housing
on the Stanford community and which dorm
consistently has the hottest freshman. I am
convinced that if only we could find some
way of creating perpetual college road trips,
in which uninformed opinions are thrown
around like divine facts, we could solve most
of the world's problems. I suggest picking a
topic to debate in advance and finalize it by
sending a proposal to the White House upon
arrival in Tahoe.
It is best if your staff does not confirm the
cabin reservation until they are already on
Highway 50. This is when you find out that
the house is booked for the wrong weekend.
Accept this fact. Plan on it, even. Booking a
house fora random date will probably have
resulted in a higher chance of getting a reser
vation for MLK weekend than any amount
of advance planning, anyway.
One popular and effective solution to this
problem is fora displaced dorm to show up
en masse at the front door of another dorm's
cabin (preferably before the renters get
there) and beg for charity.This can be accom
plished by relying on the kindness of the
other dorm's staff, or with vague promises of
sexual favors. Either one works.
Once people begin trickling into the
house, the dorm should make an effort to
split themselves by social status as quickly as
possible. The cool kids should immediately
stake out a bedroom and revert to being
eight years old by locking the door and com
ing up with a password for entry. The staff
also gets its own room as compensation for
planning this absurd enterprise. Dornicest
couples, no matter how reviled by their fel
low dormmates. will manage to convince
everyone that their lust entitles them to their
own bed. This decision will be regretted by
the kids who end up sleeping under those
beds.
At some point the realization sets in —

being on ski trip is just like spending a week
end in your dorm, albeit a smaller and colder
one, and with a greater potential for major
physical injury. Some popular options for
cabin activities include:
• Puking in the hot tub
Why this activity is so much more popular
than merely sitting in the hot tub wondering if
her breasts are supposed to float like that or
even puking in the bathroom is beyond me.
But it will happen. At least it discourages
people from having sex in the hot tub, which
is a good thing because sex in the hot tub 1)
makes the virgins in the house cry 2) almost
ensures that someone contracts an STD from
the water.
• Ten Fingers
This can be played one of two ways. It can
be played correctly or incorrectly. We'll call
these two styles of play Wilbur and FroSoCo.
The Wilbur rules expressly forbid any ques
tions not involving sex.This inevitably results
in a one-upmanship that ends in questions
like "Never have I ever been walked in on
while having sex with two farm animals." In
an effort not to appear as innocent as you re
ally are, lying about such escapades is per
fectly acceptable. The FroSoCo school of ten
fingers involves confessions like "Never have
I ever taken a CASA class."
• Taboo
Nothing gets Stanford students as com
petitive as this incredibly innocuous game,
and our competitive spirit is only amplified
by alcohol at high altitudes. Why we continue
to play it is beyond me, since we've all played
it enough times to have memorized the list of
possible answers. But that's inconsequential
in the minds of all the desperate boys on ski
trip who feel entitled to a hookup and are
convinced that their attractiveness on a par
ticular night is directly correlated to the total
score they have compiled in the games
played that night.
• Boundary-exploring bisexual orgy (BFBO)
Ski trip is one of the most sexually
charged and least sexually satisfying events
at Stanford (after Full Moon on the Quad,
Exotic Erotic, that French porn class and
TUesday nights). This tension is only height
ened as students are forced to come up with
new ways to sublimate their raging one-sided
sexual desire while sleeping in the same beds
as their objects of infatuation. Half of Tahoe

is in Nevada, which is also home to Vegas.
However, this has absolutely no bearing on
what happens in South Lake Tahoe, Calif.
What happens on ski trip gets broadcasted
via text message five minutes after it hap
pens. Still, I think the BEBO could be the
perfect dorm bonding experience. (And
Ralph Castro could moderate!)
• Not eating
All this repression is bound to make a
man hungry, which is why there will never be
any food in your cabin. Chocolate, trail mix,
five pounds of mustard and two handles of
Popov Vodka, sure. Edible cold cuts? Never.
So it will fall to the dorm mother to cook
enough pasta to feed a small army, which no
one will eat because it won't be done until
everyone has already passed out from mild
alcohol poisoning.
In an effort to be sensitive to those mem
bers of the Stanford community without
legs, we're no longer allowed to call it ski
trip. It's "snow trip" now. But that's irrele
vant and factually incorrect, because really,
everyone goes to Tahoe to ski (or at least
pretend to).
Skiers break off into three groups. Group
1: People who have never skied before and
the experienced skiers who have volunteered
to teach them. Group 2: Members of Sigma
Kappa lota, Austrians, Swiss and Saint
Bernards. Group 3: Everyone else, ranging
from people who skied for the first time on
their freshman year ski trip to kids with a
cabin at Squaw Valley (which is where the
real skiers go, as they will repeatedly tell
everyone within hearing range). Shockingly,
everyone in this group will be at the same
level of proficiency — "Not bad for how
many times I've gone skiing."
Getting everyone back from the slopes
will take hours. No one will stay with the
group of people he or she drove in with and
cell phones won't work, so the martyred staff
will drive white-knuckled back and forth
through Tahoe, in unfamiliar SUVs on unlit,
unpainted roads.
Once everyone has been safely returned
to the house, the whole process can begin
again — only with renewed vigor, since
there's only one night left to make up for lost
games of Taboo, missed opportunities for
hookups... and that jar of mustard isn't going
to eat itself.
Finally, it's not a real ski trip unless
someone goes to the hospital, preferably
minutes before checkout time at the cabin.
Possible scenarios that can make this a real
ity: homemade sled jumps, intimate en
counters with a tree, drinking too much.
Bonus points for requiring an airlift. Major
party foul if anyone dies.
