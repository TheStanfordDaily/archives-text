## "I thought this first weekend was a very good dress rehearsal for us." TOBIAS ORIWOL, senior backstroker Off to a HOt Start No. 2 Stanford sweeps Arizona opponents 
### ALEXIS PETERSON 
Stanford men's swimming and diving
tamed the Wildcats Friday in a decisive
127-115 victory over fifth-ranked Ari
zona. Fueled by this win, the Cardinal
went on to defeat Arizona State Satur
day bv a crushing 51-point margin, 144-
93.
The matchup between the No. 2 Car
dinal and Arizona was an important
start to the winter racing season. The
Wildcats placed third at last year's
NCAA Championship and returned 18
members from that team — including
one defending national champion.
While Arizona continues to trail Stan
ford in the national polls, some specu
late that the Wildcats could be a prime
candidate to win it all in 2(X)6.
Hie Cardinal victory is therefore a
promising step for the team. Even more
encouraging, however, is the fashion in
which Stanford captured the win. A 1 -2-
3 finish in the S(M)-free (which included
a season-best performance by senior
Michael McLean) was perhaps the
highlight of the afternoon as the Cardi
nal went on to prevail in a total of seven
events.
"The Arizona meet was a great test
to find out where our team is at this
point in the season, and for us to come
out and beat them was certainly a good
sign of things to come," said junior
Shaun Phillips, who recorded a win in
the I,(HM)-free and swam to second in
the 500-free. "We are recently coming
out of our heaviest training, so to swim

The No. 2 Cardinal swimming and diving team snuck past No. 5 Arizona on Friday, 127-1 15. It was a much easier road to victory the next day, as
Stanford trounced Arizona State, 144-93.
fast at this point tells us that things
can only get better as we go along."
The size of the Stanford team is
also promising as the Cardinal look
ahead to the race fora national title.
Competition within the team is
pushing every swimmer to consis
tently perform at the top of his game.
"With as large a team as we have
this year, people have to earn a spot
on the travel team and that helped
push the team as a whole," said jun
ior Andy Grant, who captured a vic
tory in the 200-free. "Everyone was
battling for the smallest of points,
even if the person they were trying
to beat had an'S' instead of an 'A on
their cap. Our key to success came
from the fourth- and fifth- place fin
ishes of the guys on the bubble fight
ing fora spot in the meet against
Arizona State."
Stanford was also victorious in
the 200-IM (Tobias Oriwol. 1:46.62),
the 200-back (Hongzhe Sun,
1:43.28), the 200-fly (Mark Stephens,
1:47.78) and in one-meter diving
(Dwight Dumais).
Less than 24 hours later, when
the Cardinal again hit the pool to
take on Arizona State, they faced a
team determined to make a nation
al impact. Twentieth at NCAAs last
year, the Sun Devils returned 13 of
23 members of their squad, includ
ing a two-time Olympic diver who
last year won two individual nation
al championships in the same sea
son and boasted an impressive in
coming class.
All this was no match for Stan
ford's unflagging strength and deter
mination. Winning eight of 13 events
throughout the day, the thrashing of
the Sun Devils raised the Cardinal's
dual meet record to 3-0.
The tone of the day was set right
out of the gate with a Stanford win in
the 4(H) medley relay. Sun, freshman
Paul Kornfeld, junior Ben Wildman-

Tobriner and freshman Jason Dun
ford swam it in 3:16.11, which is the
second-best time for that event this
year.
"We had some breakout per
formances from a few freshmen,
which is always exciting," Wildman-
Tobriner said. "I am eager to see my
teammates' performances in the
coming weeks as we continue to get
faster."
The second event of the day con
tinued Stanford's winning trend as
Oriwol swam to a season-best time
(1:37.20) and first place in the 200-
free.
"I thought that this first weekend
was a very good dress rehearsal for
us." Oriwol said.
Hie Cardinal continued to show
case amazing performances all after
noon. Oriwol posted a team season
best time in the 200-fly (1:46.33),
winning the event. Stanford also
went 1-2-3 in four other events —
the 50-free (Wildman-Tobriner,
Dunford. Matt Crowe), the 200-IM
(Sun, Stephens, Nate Cass), the 100-
free (Wildman-Tobriner, Dunford,
and again Crowe) and the 200-back
(Oriwol, Cass, Grant).
Hie real excitement of the double
victory, however, lies in what it
means for the rest of Stanford's sea
son.
"We have a deep, strong, group of
guys who are really excited about
having fun and doing big things this
year — we eagerly await our next
chance to perform," Philips said.
"We had guys step up and beat out
some 'Zona guys who just didn't
want it as badly — our depth just
proved too much for them."
"We've spent the entire fall train
ing hard and preparing for the
NCAA season, so finally getting to
race was a fulfilling start to what
should be an excellent couple of
months," Wildman-Tobriner added.
The next step in this journey is set
to take place Feb. 3, as the Cardinal
head south to compete against CSU-
Bakcrsfield. Feb. 4. Stanford contin
