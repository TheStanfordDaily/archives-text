## "I thought this first weekend was a very good dress rehearsal for us." TOBIAS ORIWOL, senior backstroker Off to a HOt Start No. 2 Stanford sweeps Arizona opponents 
### ALEXIS PETERSON 
Stanford men's swimming and diving
tamed the Wildcats Friday in a decisive
127-115 victory over fifth-ranked Ari
zona. Fueled by this win, the Cardinal
went on to defeat Arizona State Satur
day bv a crushing 51-point margin, 144-
93.
The matchup between the No. 2 Car
dinal and Arizona was an important
start to the winter racing season. The
Wildcats placed third at last year's
NCAA Championship and returned 18
members from that team â€” including
one defending national champion.
While Arizona continues to trail Stan
ford in the national polls, some specu
late that the Wildcats could be a prime
candidate to win it all in 2(X)6.
Hie Cardinal victory is therefore a
promising step for the team. Even more
encouraging, however, is the fashion in
which Stanford captured the win. A 1 -2-
3 finish in the S(M)-free (which included
a season-best performance by senior
Michael McLean) was perhaps the
highlight of the afternoon as the Cardi
nal went on to prevail in a total of seven
events.
"The Arizona meet was a great test
to find out where our team is at this
point in the season, and for us to come
out and beat them was certainly a good
sign of things to come," said junior
Shaun Phillips, who recorded a win in
the I,(HM)-free and swam to second in
the 500-free. "We are recently coming
out of our heaviest training, so to swim
