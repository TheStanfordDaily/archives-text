# Peyton needs to hold his tongue
## 
### 
With the Steelers back in the
Super Bowl and the Sea
hawks playing in it for the
first time ever, I don't want to take
away from the teams' glory by
redacting the affairs of last week's
NFL Divisional Playoffs. Nonethe
less, the truly ugly sights in Indi
anapolis last weekend will resonate
through next season.
Despite getting several close
calls and a gift turnover in their
favor, the Colts played poorly in a
21-18 loss to Pittsburgh. Indy fans
began venting their rage, even be
fore the clock had run out. Message
boards on the website of the Indi
anapolis Star were ablaze, stating
that Indy would never win the big
game with quarterback Peyton
Manning at the helm and offering
dozens of doomsday scenarios re
garding the departure of players
from the team. Hie fans — who
have only had the team in town for
20 years — acted as if they were
part of the long-suffering Red Sox
and White Sox contingents.
The most incendiary quote of
the weekend, with the exception of
Steeler linebacker Joey Porter's as
sessment that the game officiating
was fixed, was Peyton Manning
telling reporters, "Let's just say we
had some problems in protection."
It was true that the Colts had a
lot of trouble blocking Pittsburgh's
defense. What surprised fans,
though, was not the statement, but
Manning's hemming and hawing
before answering, mumbling and
remarking, "I'm trying to be a good
teammate here."
It was clearly taking him a lot of
time to euphemize and sanitize his
criticism that the offensive line let
him down. Clips of what appeared
to be Manning chastising his line
during the game backed up this per
spective. With his own shortcom
ings, he might have been better off
to say, "We had trouble with the
front but I threw a lot of bad pass
es...as a team, we just played badly."
Manning's statement is all the
more audacious given the fact that
his famously convulsive pre-play
routine results in him calling a good
portion of the plays at the line, and
thus he should be putting the line in
position to protect him.
Colts nemesis Tom Brady of the
Patriots stars in a Visa campaign
that plays on the legend of a quar
terback taking his line out for din
ner, as the Patriots' linemen play
the "metaphors" of Visa's credit
protection. Meanwhile, Manning
stars — alone — in a surreal set of
MasterCard spots cheering for
everyday workers like waitresses
and stock boys.
The contrast is stark and unmis
takable. Brady comes off as a "team
guy," and Manning looks like a "me
guy." ITiis is not to say the impres
sions are correct, but in mass media,
including sports marketing, percep
tion is reality. My friend theorized
that "Peyton makes the metaphors
pay, and that's why he has problems
with protection."
Surely, all the Colts are frustrat
ed with the playoff failure. The
team is in a fragile state and the last
thing it needs is finger-pointing.
There is no greater buzz-kill than
teammates questioning each other
in public. Peyton should watch his
steps carefully, for sooner or later
some fingers may point at him, and
he might start losing some precious
trust.
And once the over-exposure air
starts leaving the balloon, things
can turn quickly. Donovan McNabb
and Kurt Warner have both suf
fered precipitous downturns after
their aura were pierced. With a 3-6
playoff record to juxtapose with the
passing records and media atten
tion, NFL fans might get bored.
Now let it be said that none of
the above makes Manning a bad
person. But it has been long enough
that it can be said: maybe—just
maybe — this whole Manning fam
ily legend is getting a bit overblown.
