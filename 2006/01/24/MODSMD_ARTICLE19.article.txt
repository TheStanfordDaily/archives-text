# MEN'S GYMNASTICS
## Men's gym wins Stanford Open "When we go into a gym I tell the guys to make it theirs—they own it." THOM GLIELMI, head coach 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR ROSELYN HALLETT 
Though more than 7(H) gymnasts of all
ages traveled through Burnham Pavilion
this past weekend, it was the Cardinal's
14-man squad which stole the show Sat
urday night. With strong first-place per
formances on vault, high bar and still
rings, the No. 6 Cardinal beat No. 7 Cali
fornia by a little over two points.
The Stanford Open pitted the cross-
Bay rivals for the second time this season,
and each time the outcome was the same.
Stanford (2-0) defeated Cal (0-2) last
week in its season opener at Berkeley
205.650 to 205.550. Sunday, the margin
was slightly larger: Stanford 208.625, Cal
206.425.
According to head coach Thom Gliel
mi, Stanford adjusted this past weekend
to win by another narrow margin. Hie
men were more consistent and the team's
hit (made) percentage was better in each
event.
'ITie win raises the Cardinal hopes of a
possible national championship and also
gave them a glimpse at possible future
competition.
"I believe our effort this past weekend
will move us up to fifth," Glielmi said.
"However my philosophy is not to worry
about the other teams or rankings —
when we go into a gym I tell the guys to
make it theirs — they own it — they are
there to show their mastery of that piece
of equipment. Have they mastered their
bodies, their minds, their nerves? When
they know this, they will be successful and
what the other teams do is irrelevant."
Sophomore David Sender won the
All-Around with 51.625 points after per
forming well on the parallel bars and
floor exercise and taking the top spot in
the vault competition with a 9.450.
With plenty of support from the home
crowd, two more Cardinal took individual
titles. Senior Nate Downs placed first on
the high bar with a 9.250, and junior team
mate Dylan Carney tied for second with
the Golden Bears' Kyson Bunthuwong in
the event. Junior Alex Schorsch's 9.650
won him the title on still rings.
The Bears placed first in only one
event, parallel bars, where Tim McNeill
scored a 9. KM) over Sender's 8.975. The
bars, a weak spot for the team last season,
eluded the Cardinal in the Open, but
Glielmi was satisfied with his team's per
formance Sunday night and mentioned
this year's change in code of points plays
a large role in final scores.
"A gymnast must do much more now
in order to start from a 10," Glielmi said.
"If the guys did the same routines they
did last year — say David Sender: his
routine last year started at 9.7 — that
same routine would now be worth 9.4. In
a sport of lOths that is substantial. So con
sidering that I'd say we are doing very
well. We are 10 deep on parallel bars and
that is a very competitive event for us."
I le added that the team's 35.25 in the
event is the second-highest in the nation.
Nebraska took third place in the meet,
with a score of 198.475. Washington and
two All Star teams also participated.
While Stanford will compete as a team
again, this weekend the Cardinal plan to
compete as individuals at the Winter Cup
Challenge, beginning Thursday in Las
Vegas, Nev. According to Glielmi, the
event is a reranking meet for the USA
National Team.
