## Campus braces for utility bill increase No tuition hike, says administration

University students around the
country are being asked to turn back
their thermometers. As the price of
natural gas continues to rise, univer
sities are busy trying to find ways to
account for the higher utility costs.
For many schools, the new utility
fees will translate into tuition hikes,
but things should remain relatively
stable for Stanford students.
"We are affected," said Associate
Vice Provost for Facilities Chris
Christofferson, "but not as much as
other universities."
In the past week, articles have
been run in the papers of Harvard
University, University of Vermont,
University of Wyoming and Ohio
University regarding the increase in
utility costs. On Jan. 13, Florida's
state universities asked the Senate
Education Appropriations Commit
tee fora 5 percent tuition hike.
Stanford's utilities, however, are
unique in that they work with a
third-party-owned co-generation
plant located on campus that locks in
favorable rates, particularly for elec
tricity. The contractor purchases gas
out on the whole-sale market for use
by the plant.
Co-generation refers to the fact
that Stanford uses its central campus
plant for cooling, heating and elec
tricity. Many universities require a
central plant, but house electricity
elsewhere. The fact that all three
utilities are under one roof allows
excess heat to be used to generate
electricity.
Christofferson called Stanford's a
"pioneering arrangement," in which
the Utility Department generates
more power than the campus actual
ly needs and then exports the extra
power to the grid of Pacific Gas &
Electric.
The biggest change, Christoffer
son said, is that there will be an in
crease in steam rates for heating
buildings. However, the warmer cli
mate puts Stanford in a better posi-
