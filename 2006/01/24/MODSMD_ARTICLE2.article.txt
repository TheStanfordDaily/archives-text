## Campus braces for utility bill increase No tuition hike, says administration 
### BOB BOREK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
University students around the
country are being asked to turn back
their thermometers. As the price of
natural gas continues to rise, univer
sities are busy trying to find ways to
account for the higher utility costs.
For many schools, the new utility
fees will translate into tuition hikes,
but things should remain relatively
stable for Stanford students.
"We are affected," said Associate
Vice Provost for Facilities Chris
Christofferson, "but not as much as
other universities."
In the past week, articles have
been run in the papers of Harvard
University, University of Vermont,
University of Wyoming and Ohio
University regarding the increase in
utility costs. On Jan. 13, Florida's
state universities asked the Senate
Education Appropriations Commit
tee fora 5 percent tuition hike.
Stanford's utilities, however, are
unique in that they work with a
third-party-owned co-generation
plant located on campus that locks in
favorable rates, particularly for elec
tricity. The contractor purchases gas
out on the whole-sale market for use
by the plant.
Co-generation refers to the fact
that Stanford uses its central campus
plant for cooling, heating and elec
tricity. Many universities require a
central plant, but house electricity
elsewhere. The fact that all three
utilities are under one roof allows
excess heat to be used to generate
electricity.
Christofferson called Stanford's a
"pioneering arrangement," in which
the Utility Department generates
more power than the campus actual
ly needs and then exports the extra
power to the grid of Pacific Gas &
Electric.
The biggest change, Christoffer
son said, is that there will be an in
crease in steam rates for heating
buildings. However, the warmer cli
mate puts Stanford in a better posi-
tion than many universities where
students are more reliant on heating
systems for warmth. At Ohio Uni
versity the energy management di
rector told students that if they could
all turn their thermometers hack just
one degree, it would result in a 5 per
cent savings on the University's
heating bill.
Christofferson emphasized that
projections are constantly being
made and sent to the budget office.
"The increases we are seeing
were expected and planned for,"he
said.
The University also operates an
aggressive conservation retro-fit
program. Christofferson said that
they have already implemented
many of the ideas that other univer
sities are just now beginning to try
out. such as higher-efficiency light
ing.
Each year. Stanford allocates
$750,000 for retro-fit programs. In
the case of auxiliaries or the Medical
School, who get their utilities via
Stanford, they can apply for project
funding that will then be paid for out
of this fund.
What happens when energy costs
rise, Christofferson said, is that the
University goes back and looks at
the campus buildings that use the
most energy.They then examine dif
ferent retro-fit programs that might
have a reasonable payback. Often,
proposals about energy conserva
tion in various buildings already
exist but were not economically vi
able when they were first produced.
High energy costs often make ener
gy conservation projects more prac
tical and more likely to be imple
mented. since the energy savings are
higher compared to the fixed cost of
implementing a project.
