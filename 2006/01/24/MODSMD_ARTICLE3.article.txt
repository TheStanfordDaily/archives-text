Rows of crosses lined White Plaza yesterday.as
the Stanford Students for Life sponsored a me
morial for the supposed "victims" of Roe vs.

Supreme Court case that provided women the
right to abort pregnancies under certain condi

legally aborted since 1973.
Intended to raise awareness about pregnancy
and women's health issues. Students for Life
members distributed pamphlets and other infor

club, and sophomore Chris Hammen spoke with
students who stopped by the booth in the plaza
and answered questions about the memorial.
"We educate people about life from concep

for Life is more about raising awareness than any

Hammen, meanwhile, raised concerns about

bolic significance of the demonstration, the stu
dent club expressed the need for societal reforms.
"In working to end abortion, we must simulta
neously work to increase the support, education
