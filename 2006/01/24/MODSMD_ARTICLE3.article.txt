# A 						Plaza Divided
## PRO-LIFE AND PRO-CHOICE STUDENT GROUPS TAKE TO WHITE PLAZA Roe vs. Wade anniversary prompts demonstrations 
### AMIT ARORA STAFF WRITER 
Rows of crosses lined White Plaza yesterday.as
the Stanford Students for Life sponsored a me
morial for the supposed "victims" of Roe vs.
Wade. Marking the anniversary of the landmark
Supreme Court case that provided women the
right to abort pregnancies under certain condi
tions, the memorial was erected to remember the
approximately 45 million fetuses that have been
legally aborted since 1973.
Intended to raise awareness about pregnancy
and women's health issues. Students for Life
members distributed pamphlets and other infor
mational materials throughout the afternoon.
Hoping to stimulate discussion about alternatives
to abortion and reproductive health practices,
graduate student Becky Currano, secretary of the
club, and sophomore Chris Hammen spoke with
students who stopped by the booth in the plaza
and answered questions about the memorial.
"We educate people about life from concep
tion to birth," Currano said. "Stanford Students
for Life is more about raising awareness than any
thing else."
Hammen, meanwhile, raised concerns about
the notion of choice.
"When it comes to abortion, choice is really
the decision of whether a human being should die
or not," he said. "In any other situation, to simply
kill a person out of convenience is completely un
heard of. Somehow, our society believes that it is
acceptable here."
To address the issue. Students for Life mem
bers attributed the number of abortions to social
and cultural factors. In a flier explaining the sym
bolic significance of the demonstration, the stu
dent club expressed the need for societal reforms.
"In working to end abortion, we must simulta
neously work to increase the support, education

and pregnancy resources available to women;
we must also combat those aspects ol our cul
ture which have led to the disrespectful, utili
tarian attitude on the part of men who engage
in irresponsible sexual behavior and leave
the resulting 'inconvenience' to their female
partners." read the publication.
Opposite the booth in White Plaza, the
Stanford Students for Choice also recognized
the 33rd anniversary of the Court decision
with information on abortion and the impor
tance of a woman's right to choose. Sopho
more Selena Simmons-Duffin, speaker and
manager for the club, described the group's
activities.
"I think that we should celebrate our re
productive health rights today," she said.
"We're celebrating 33 years of the right to
choose. We will also be coming out tomorrow
with even more information and activities."
Faced with the likely nomination of social

ly conservative Judge Samuel Alito to the
U.S. Supreme Court, many pro-choice groups
are wary about a potential overturn of Roe.
Senior Neela Penumarthy, co-president of
the Students for Choice,said she is motivated
by the pressing need for activism.
"I think there is a definite possibility that
Roe v. Wade is overturned," she said. "1 think
that if students on campus believe that there
will not be active opposition to the case, then
they are really in denial. Even if the case is not
overturned, 88 percent of counties in the
country already do not have abortion
providers and 400 local and state laws cur
rently limit the practice of abortion. We have
to be active to protect our rights."
Penumarthy also noted that the club does
not restrict itself solely to the issue of abor
tion.
"A full range of reproductive rights is not
limited to abortion alone," she said. "It in

eludes women's health coverage, prenatal
care and access to the day-after pill."
Offering visibly opposite positions on re
productive health rights, both sides civilly
recognized the many differences in their
viewpoints. Junior Jessica 1 laro, co-president
of the Students for Choice, described the two
clubs' interaction.
"When you get right down to it, there is al
most nothing that we agree on," she said. "We
support comprehensive sex education and
the availability of a wide number of options,
including abortion. They want to override
abortion. We have fundamental differences."
Both clubs, however, remained peaceful
throughout the afternoon, largely as a result
of an agreement to respect club activities and
the right to openly express all opinions. The
Students for Life members said that most
passersby were generally receptive to the
club's message.

"More people who have stopped by have
been supportive rather than antagonistic,"
Currano said. "They have all generally been
respectful."
In addition to the Students for Life and
the Students for Choice, an independent stu
dent sponsored his own demonstration re
garding abortion in White Plaza. On a large
cardboard poster, senior Ben Crosby dis
played the message "'A woman's body is her
own fuckin' business.' — Jay, the movie
Clerks."
When questioned about his motivation for
the display, Crosby relayed a personal experi
ence.
"I have a friend back home who had an il
legal abortion before Roe v. Wade that really
upset her," he said. "It has caused a lot of pain
in her life and she has had to work through
that. For this reason, I support legal abortions
in this country."

Groups share Plaza peacefully, despite differences

and pregnancy resources available to women;
we must also combat those aspects ol our cul
ture which have led to the disrespectful, utili
tarian attitude on the part of men who engage
in irresponsible sexual behavior and leave
the resulting 'inconvenience' to their female
partners." read the publication.
Opposite the booth in White Plaza, the
Stanford Students for Choice also recognized
the 33rd anniversary of the Court decision
with information on abortion and the impor
tance of a woman's right to choose. Sopho
more Selena Simmons-Duffin, speaker and
manager for the club, described the group's
activities.
"I think that we should celebrate our re
productive health rights today," she said.
"We're celebrating 33 years of the right to
choose. We will also be coming out tomorrow
with even more information and activities."
Faced with the likely nomination of social

ly conservative Judge Samuel Alito to the
U.S. Supreme Court, many pro-choice groups
are wary about a potential overturn of Roe.
Senior Neela Penumarthy, co-president of
the Students for Choice,said she is motivated
by the pressing need for activism.
"I think there is a definite possibility that
Roe v. Wade is overturned," she said. "1 think
that if students on campus believe that there
will not be active opposition to the case, then
they are really in denial. Even if the case is not
overturned, 88 percent of counties in the
country already do not have abortion
providers and 400 local and state laws cur
rently limit the practice of abortion. We have
to be active to protect our rights."
Penumarthy also noted that the club does
not restrict itself solely to the issue of abor
tion.
"A full range of reproductive rights is not
limited to abortion alone," she said. "It in

eludes women's health coverage, prenatal
care and access to the day-after pill."
Offering visibly opposite positions on re
productive health rights, both sides civilly
recognized the many differences in their
viewpoints. Junior Jessica 1 laro, co-president
of the Students for Choice, described the two
clubs' interaction.
"When you get right down to it, there is al
most nothing that we agree on," she said. "We
support comprehensive sex education and
the availability of a wide number of options,
including abortion. They want to override
abortion. We have fundamental differences."
Both clubs, however, remained peaceful
throughout the afternoon, largely as a result
of an agreement to respect club activities and
the right to openly express all opinions. The
Students for Life members said that most
passersby were generally receptive to the
club's message.

"More people who have stopped by have
been supportive rather than antagonistic,"
Currano said. "They have all generally been
respectful."
In addition to the Students for Life and
the Students for Choice, an independent stu
dent sponsored his own demonstration re
garding abortion in White Plaza. On a large
cardboard poster, senior Ben Crosby dis
played the message "'A woman's body is her
own fuckin' business.' — Jay, the movie
Clerks."
When questioned about his motivation for
the display, Crosby relayed a personal experi
ence.
"I have a friend back home who had an il
legal abortion before Roe v. Wade that really
upset her," he said. "It has caused a lot of pain
in her life and she has had to work through
that. For this reason, I support legal abortions
in this country."
