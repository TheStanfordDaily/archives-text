### CHRISTIAN L. TOM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite a marked increase in private dona
tions to overseas universities, Stanford still
benefited from a record $603.9 million in gifts
last year.
That figure, representing the fiscal year
ending Aug. 31,2005, constituted a rise of ap
proximately 15 percent, or nearly $80 million

over the previous years total.
"There have been more gifts to organiza
tions outside the U. 5.," said John Ford, senior
vice president for University resources. "There
is no doubt about it."
Still, Stanford outstripped any other school
of higher education in the United States in
terms of private donations, he added.
Though conceding that the University al
ways faces stiff competition from other
schools. Ford reported that, "We've done very
well."
Much of the overseas giving now comes
from and goes to either the United Kingdom

or Asia.
According to Ford, in the late 1980s, Cam
bridge and Oxford took notice of the success of
American universities, particularly their abili
ty to appeal to donors.
Consequently, he said those schools, "con
tacted and involved their alumni in a way look
ing a lot like the private universities in Ameri
ca."
In addition, a number of high-profile, large
scale donations have gone to Oxford and Cam
bridge. Tom Tseng, associate director of devel
opment at the Office of Asian Relations, point
ed out the publicity surrounding the Bill and

Melinda Gates Foundation's $210-million gift
to Cambridge in 2(XK).
As part of the school's B(X)th Anniversary
Campaign, Cambridge has initiated a $1.78-
billion goal for donations.
Ford also emphasized the shift in giving to
and from universities in Hong Kong, Singa
pore and the People's Republic of China.
"There are many wealthy people of Chi
nese ancestry making large gifts, feeling that
since China is thriving, [they should promote]
opportunities to help educate in that country,"
