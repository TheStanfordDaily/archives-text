## Stanford competes with overseas campuses for funds Record $604 million raked in this year from private donors 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite a marked increase in private dona
tions to overseas universities, Stanford still
benefited from a record $603.9 million in gifts
last year.
That figure, representing the fiscal year
ending Aug. 31,2005, constituted a rise of ap
proximately 15 percent, or nearly $80 million

over the previous years total.
"There have been more gifts to organiza
tions outside the U. 5.," said John Ford, senior
vice president for University resources. "There
is no doubt about it."
Still, Stanford outstripped any other school
of higher education in the United States in
terms of private donations, he added.
Though conceding that the University al
ways faces stiff competition from other
schools. Ford reported that, "We've done very
well."
Much of the overseas giving now comes
from and goes to either the United Kingdom

or Asia.
According to Ford, in the late 1980s, Cam
bridge and Oxford took notice of the success of
American universities, particularly their abili
ty to appeal to donors.
Consequently, he said those schools, "con
tacted and involved their alumni in a way look
ing a lot like the private universities in Ameri
ca."
In addition, a number of high-profile, large
scale donations have gone to Oxford and Cam
bridge. Tom Tseng, associate director of devel
opment at the Office of Asian Relations, point
ed out the publicity surrounding the Bill and

Melinda Gates Foundation's $210-million gift
to Cambridge in 2(XK).
As part of the school's B(X)th Anniversary
Campaign, Cambridge has initiated a $1.78-
billion goal for donations.
Ford also emphasized the shift in giving to
and from universities in Hong Kong, Singa
pore and the People's Republic of China.
"There are many wealthy people of Chi
nese ancestry making large gifts, feeling that
since China is thriving, [they should promote]
opportunities to help educate in that country,"
Ford said.
He added that, "some of the uni
versities are really trying to grow,
particularly in the mainland. Some
of the biggest gifts are being an
nounced in that part of the world."
Universities in Asia are also mak
ing an effort to mimic the successful
American fundraising strategies.
Tseng provided the example of a col
league who worked to fundraise for
Princeton University and was lured
to China by Tsinghua University in
Beijing.
So, how has Stanford been able to
counteract the appeal of overseas
universities to its prospective
donors?
Rebecca Smith-Vogel, director of
marketing and communications at
the Office of Development, credits
Stanford being Stanford.
"As far as appealing to overseas
donors," Smith-Vogel said. "Stan
ford really is becoming an increas
ingly global university."
Smith-Vogel attributes Stanford's
appeal in part to University President
John Hennessy's three initiatives on
international affairs, environmental
stability and human health.
" These initiatives," explained
Smith-Vogel, "have the potential to
have tremendous impact on what
have been considered intractable
global problems."
As Stanford provides donors with
many reasons to invest in the Uni
versity, more total donations world
wide will only result in more money
tunneling into Stanford's coffers.
Ford and Tseng cite the proven
qualities of Stanford academics and
money-management history.
"We are the best in the industry,"
Ford said. "Students are coming
from all over the world to train
here."
Tseng also credited the Stanford
name-brand and its ability to stand
on its own.
"Stanford manages donors' gifts
carefully," Tseng said. "We have a
good track record of growing gifts.
'ITiat's what a donor wants to hear:
that their money is going to good
use."
All the competition from other
schools — both overseas and do
mestic — is healthy. And according
to Ford, in the end, to the Universi
ty's advantage because, "Stanford
offers good reason to invest in us."
ITie issue is less about money sim
ply being diverted from Stanford to
various universities in China, but in
stead more about a general trend of
increased giving from Asia, among
other places.
" Hie pie for philanthropy is get
ting bigger." Tseng explained.
Ford agreed.
"Our percent may not go up, but
it is a percentage on a much larger
amount being given away," he said.
"1 think it is a situation where all
boats can rise in this tide."
