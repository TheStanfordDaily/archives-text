## Staff trio recognized for public service 
### GERRY SHIH DESK EDITOR 
One of them recounted two un
wavering years spent teaching Eng
lish to an immigrant family.
Another told the story of a life
spent volunteering and fundraising.
The third recalled the time she
organized a group of "crazy ladies"
to park their cars next to drug deal
ers at an East Palo Alto playground
so children could come back and
play safely.
Casually progressing through
both brief lulls of reminiscence and
healthy bursts of laughter, Joan Kar
lin, Ador Escoto and Jennifer Jack
son told their personal histories of
public service to an audience of over
100 faculty, staff and students at a re
ception in the TYesidder Oak Room

yesterday at noon. The three Stan
ford staff members were honored at
the winter quarter "Community
TYeasures" lunch, an event spon
sored by the Office of the President
to recognize Stanford staff members
who are active in community volun
teerism. Special counselor to the
President LaDoris Cordell moderat
ed the event, which covered both the
personal lives of the trio as well as
their service records.
Karlin, the associate dean for ad
ministration in Student Affairs, was
recognized for her work helping an
immigrant Russian family adapt to
life in the United States.
Hearing a rabbi speak in 1980
about his visit to the Soviet Union
changed her life, Karlin said. Follow-
