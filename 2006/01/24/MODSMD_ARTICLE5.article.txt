# AWARDS & HONORS
## Staff trio recognized for public service 
### GERRY SHIH DESK EDITOR 
One of them recounted two un
wavering years spent teaching Eng
lish to an immigrant family.
Another told the story of a life
spent volunteering and fundraising.
The third recalled the time she
organized a group of "crazy ladies"
to park their cars next to drug deal
ers at an East Palo Alto playground
so children could come back and
play safely.
Casually progressing through
both brief lulls of reminiscence and
healthy bursts of laughter, Joan Kar
lin, Ador Escoto and Jennifer Jack
son told their personal histories of
public service to an audience of over
100 faculty, staff and students at a re
ception in the TYesidder Oak Room

yesterday at noon. The three Stan
ford staff members were honored at
the winter quarter "Community
TYeasures" lunch, an event spon
sored by the Office of the President
to recognize Stanford staff members
who are active in community volun
teerism. Special counselor to the
President LaDoris Cordell moderat
ed the event, which covered both the
personal lives of the trio as well as
their service records.
Karlin, the associate dean for ad
ministration in Student Affairs, was
recognized for her work helping an
immigrant Russian family adapt to
life in the United States.
Hearing a rabbi speak in 1980
about his visit to the Soviet Union
changed her life, Karlin said. Follow-

Community
Treasures
Joan Karlin, Domi
nador "Ador" Escoto
and Jennifer Jackson
receive awards for
their community vol
unteerism at a
lunchtime reception
held at Tresidder
Oak Room.
ing the sermon, she was introduced
to a woman who connected mem
bers of the congregation to Jews who
had recently taken refuge in Ameri
ca.
"It caught me at a time when I
had the time and money," Karlin
said. "It's a way of giving hack, to
touch my roots."
After being matched with the
family, she went to their home in
Menlo Park once a week for two
years to tutor English. Her students
have since flourished and maintain a
close friendship with Karlin.
Ador Escoto, a finance manage
ment analyst at the Medical School,
has been active in public service
since his college days â€” an urge
driven by an "obsession to help peo
ple in need " he said.
Since arriving at Stanford, he has
rallied over $6.0(K) toward earth
quake relief and book donations for
his native Philippines, and $3,(KK) for
the Haas Center for Public Service.
Besides regularly donating his own
money to the Salvation Army, Habi
tat for Humanity, the American Red
Cross and charities for breast cancer
and diabetes, Escoto has also been a
prolific community organizer in his
Filipino hometown as well as a vol

unteer firefighter following Sept. 11.
Jackson, an employee at the Lu
cile Packard Children's Hospital,
founded the annual Children's Day
in East Palo Alto 15 years ago. She is
currently a registrar for the Adoles
cent Health Van, a mobile clinic that
offers free health care to homeless
and uninsured teens in the Bay Area.
She was named a "Local Hero" by
KQED-TV in 2004 and now,after 35
years of community activism, has yet
to show signs of slowing down.
"Anybody who knows me," Jack
son wrote in an e-mail read by
Cordell at the reception, "knows I
will fight until the bitter end for
something I believe in, especially if
it's helping the underserved. But I
want people to know, there is always
something we can all do to make a
difference."
In particular, her stories of altru
istic but naive Stanford doctors who
ventured into East Palo Alto's noto
riously rough Sacramento Street
drew laughter from the receptive au
dience.
After the event, Cordell was met
by many audience members who
praised her dexterous interviewing
skills and expressed their apprecia
tion for the lunch series.
"I'm happy to do this," Cordell
said. "It gets me energized, because
this is only the tip of the iceberg. So
many staff and faculty are involved
outside campus and changing lives.
It's my goal to find those people and

honor them."
Cordell also stressed that the
lunches serve as an excellent plat
form for community activists to not
only talk about their work, but also
spread their message.
"Most students might not care so
much about staff,compared to facul
ty, but it's very important to come
here and get inspired," she said.
Karlin agreed.
"It seems like a nice way to com
municate to the Stanford community
that we are, in fact, a part of the
broader community," she added.
The lunch series was the brain
child of Cordell. who first organized
a dinner at the Haas Center in Fall
2004 to recognize over 200 faculty
and staff members who were active
in community service. In response to
the success of that event. Senior As
sistant to the President Jeff Wachtel
and Cordell decided to expand the
program to make it a quarterly
iunchtime series beginning this past
fall.
With two "Community Trea
sures" lunches already under her
belt, Cordell said she feels very con
fident about the sustainability of the
series. When asked if she had any
larger ambitions for the future of the
program, Cordell shrugged off the
question without hesitation.
"No," she responded immediate
ly with a big, comfortable smile.
"This is beautiful. If it ain't broke,
don't fix it."
