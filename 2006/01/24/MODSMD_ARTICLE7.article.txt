## Kuwaiti emir to step down from power Ailing new ruler reaches compromise with government 
### DIANA ELIAS ASSOCIATED PRESS 
KUWAIT CITY (AP) —Kuwait's ailing
emir has agreed to abdicate under a deal
worked out within the ruling family, a lawmak
er said Monday — paving the way for the
prime minister and longtime de facto ruler to
take the reins of power.
The accord followed an unprecedented
public quarrel within the ruling family over
who would lead the country, one of Washing
ton's most steadfast allies in the Middle East
and a major oil producer, after the death of its
longtime leader.
One faction backed the ailing new emir.
Sheik SaadAl Abdullah A1 Sabah.and the other,
including the Cabinet, supported the prime min
ister, half brother to the previous leader, who
died Jan. 15.The two camps met Monday night to
try to reach a compromise before a parliament
debate Hiesday over whether Sheik Saad should
be ousted in favor of the prime minister. Sheik
Sabah A1 Ahmed A1 Sabah.
In announcing the abdication deal, lawmak
er Nasser al-Saneh told The Associated Press
"an agreement has been reached in the family
and (Sheik Saad) will sign the abdication pa
pers tomorrow."
It was not known when Sheik Sabah would
take the oath as emir. As prime minister. Sheik
Sabah has been running the day-to-day affairs
of Kuwait since the longtime ruler. Sheik Jaber
A1 Ahmed A1 Sabah, suffered a brain hemor
rhage in 2(X)1. Sheik Jaber ruled for 27 years and
had been restored to power by U.S. forces after
Saddam Hussein invaded the country in 1990.
As crown prince. Sheik Saad, Sheik Jaber's
cousin, was treated fora bleeding colon in 1997.
Both Sheik Saad and the prime minister are

in their mid-70s — their exact ages are not
known - but Sheik Sabah is the more fit of the
two. He had a heart pacemaker implanted but
otherwise is said to be in good health.
The leadership crisis came to a head Friday
when scores of ruling family members visited
Sheik Sabah at his residence and asked him to
take charge of the country.
The push for Sheik Sabah's ascension, how
ever, was snarled when some members of
Sheik Saad's branch of the ruling family ob
jected. Key among them was Sheik Salem A1
Ali A1 Sabah, chief of the national guard and
the oldest member of the family. His status as
family elder added particular weight to his ob
jection.
Some lawmakers had said they would boy
cott Tuesday's parliamentary debate, hoping
the ruling family would find a compromise.
"Lawmakers don't want to take sides," Is
lamist legislator WalidTabtabai, told reporters.
The 1964 succession law gives the Cabinet
the right to ask parliament to transfer the
emir's powers to the crown prince if it is proven
the ruler is physically unable to carry out his
duties. A two-thirds vote is needed.
Many Kuwaitis had voiced fears Sheik Saad
would be unable to recite the full oath of office
stipulated by the constitution. Since he suc
ceeded his cousin just over a week ago, he has
appeared in a wheelchair and has not spoken
in public.
"I never wanted things to reach the point of
removing his highness the emir," Hussein al-
Qallaf. a Shiite cleric and lawmaker said. "It is
difficult and it weighs heavily on all legislators.
Sheik Saad is loved by all Kuwaitis."
The ailing emir is the son of Abullah A1
Salem A1 Sabah, who is known as the "father of
democracy" and the founder of modern
Kuwait.
Kuwaitis, who are used to a smooth succes
sion, had hoped fora compromise by the ruling
family. The nation's news media, meanwhile,
had sided with Sheik Sabah.
