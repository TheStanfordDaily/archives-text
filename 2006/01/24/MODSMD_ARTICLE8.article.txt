NEW YORK (AP) — Oscar, welcome
to the Big Apple.
On a bleak and rainy Monday in New
York City, 50 golden Oscar statuettes
gleamed inside a Times Square window
display as tourists and curious city folk
paused to ogle and snap pictures — or
shrug and keep walking.
"This is the closest I think I ever will
be," mused Ulysses Amoros. 50, a New
Yorker who said he would like to win an

Oscar for Best Picture. "That's why I'm
this close, dreaming."
The newly minted statuettes made
their New York debut as part of a "Meet
the Oscars" exhibition at Times Square
Studios (44th St.and Broadway) present
ed by the Motion Picture Academy of
Arts and Sciences. They will be displayed
through Feb. l.Then they're off to sunny
Los Angeles to take centerstage at the
Academy Awards ceremony, which will be
held March 5.
Each eight-and-a-half pound Oscar
stands 13-inches tall and is made of gold

plated britannium, a metal alloy. (Let's
hope tiny Reese Witherspoon. if her name
is called, has a solid grip.)
"They're shinier and look better
made," observed Marcia Fokas, 55, a
lawyer from Queens. "I think it's good
they're coming to New York. ... I think
jaded New Yorkers take this in stride be
cause we see this kind of stuff all the time,
but to out-of-towners, this would seem
special."
Veerle Romsse, 30, a veterinarian visit
ing New York by way of Belgium, snapped
souvenir pictures on her camera.
