## Making the MARK Google purchases radio advertising firm dMarc, promising more bang for your online ad buck 
### ILENA GEORGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Google announced on TUesday its $102-million plan to
purchase dMarc Broadcasting, a radio advertising
agency that provides advertisers with an automated sys
tem to search through and purchase radio advertising
slots to fit with a particular client's target audience — a process
similar to Google's AdWords.
"We anticipate that this acquisition will bring new ad dollars
and accountability to radio by combining Google's expansive net
work of advertisers with dMarc's talented team and innovative
radio advertising technology," says Tim Armstrong, Google's vice
president of advertising sales.
DMarc's process can be an important tool for small businesses
as clients are purchasing ad time without a middleman. Another
draw is the local focus of dMarc's system. Advertisers — particu
larly smaller businesses — can use it to gain access to specific au
diences in a manner that is cost-effective and efficient. With the
new connection to Google, small advertisers will now have access
to multiple forms of media.
"The idea is that if you are a small advertiser, you have the abil
ity to link your ad to radio time in an automated fashion, and you
can imagine in the future that as an advertiser you could bid on
multiple different media, and that could probably apply to larger
advertisers," says Graduate School of Business Prof. Haim
Mendelson, director of the Center for Electronic Business and
Commerce.

AdWords. Google's automated ad-selling program, operates
similarly to dMarc — it places clients' ads on pages where specific
target words appear. Mendelson says that because of its ability to
"match advertisers with content providers." Google's clients range
from small advertisers to much larger companies. By reaching out
into a new medium, the benefits for Google stand to be substantial.
"With the rise of tools such as podcasting, the barrier for many
businesses and organizations to produce and upload their own radio
spots is falling," says Ward Hanson, director of Interactive Econom
ics within the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research.
Hanson taught a class called "Economics of the Internet" in the fall.
"Extending into radio allows Google to tap into another pool
of advertising dollars, which is tens of billions of dollars worth per
year in the United States, while staying true to a familiar ap
proach," he added.
Whereas the impact of radio advertisements is difficult to
quantify, AdWords directly measures the efficacy of Internet ads
through its Pay-Per-Click method of charging advertisers
(Google charges advertisers each time an Internet user clicks on
an advertisement). Another benefit of the acquisition is the abili
ty to more closely monitor the effect of radio ad campaigns.
"Merging radio with online campaigns should make it easier to
see when radio ads work and when they don't," Hanson says."This
should make radio advertising more accountable — whether
radio advertising in total will shrink or expand from this is a tough
call. It should, however, be more scientific."
Although some pundits believe this is a definite step in
Google's future expansion into other media, radio is an attractive

advertising medium. In particular, small advertisers benefit from
low overhead costs in creating commercials and lower price of ad
time, especially in comparison to television.
"(R]adio is much easier than video," Hanson says."It is much
more challenging to make video that looks professional than it is
to make audio that works well. Semi-automated radio ads work
much better than video. [Also,] local spot radio works well for
small business. This is a very lucrative part of the business that
Google is comfortable dealing with."
Mendelson also explains that television advertising is a more
complex system that would be more difficult to automate than
radio or the Internet.
But The San Jose Mercury News reports that this acquisition is
part of a trend as Google works its way into other media and that
television could be next.
"Google has quietly moved into print advertising, buying and
reselling space in select newspapers, trade publications and mag
azines," says a Jan. 18 article in The Mercury titled 'Google casts
its net over radio.'
"And its recently launched Google Video Store, which offers
previously aired CBS prime time shows as well as classics for $ 1.99
each, created a partnership with a network. Analysts think the
Mountain View company could next establish a presence in TV
advertising — perhaps with cable TV — helping companies place
ads targeted in particular regions," the article continues.
If dMarc meets specific performance and business objectives,
Google will pay up to an additional $1,136 billion over a three
year period.
