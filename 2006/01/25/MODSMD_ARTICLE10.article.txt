## Building collapse kills 14 in Kenya 
### ANTHONY MITCHELL ASSOCIATED PRESS 
NAIROBI. Kenya (AP) — An unknown number of
construction workers remained missing Tuesday in a
building collapse in Kenya's capital as teams from the
United States, Britain and Israel arrived to help rescuers
struggling to reach those trapped inside.
The death toll rose to 14 as rescuers cut into concrete
slabs and iron rods with newly arrived power tools and
pulled four survivors from the rubble.
"We want to pray the people still not recovered may
be recovered," President Mwai Kibaki said after return
ing early from an African Union summit in neighboring
Sudan. "It is too soon to say anything about what has
happened, but we need courage and to work hard."
He pledged to buy professional rescue equipment for
future disasters.
An estimated 2XO construction workers had been in
side the five-story building in central Nairobi on Monday
when it began to sway and quickly collapsed. Many of the
workers had been on a break, napping.
Most were day laborers and no one has been able to
provide authorities with a detailed list of who was at the
site. It was not known how many managed to flee before
the building fell.
Officials have accounted for 106 people, said army
Maj. Gen. Paul Opiyo, who was leading the operation.
Workers struggled through the night to reach sur
vivors using sledgehammers, metal-cutters and crowbars
while shouting encouragement through drainage pipes
and holes in the rubble.
Opiyo said rescuers Tuesday found four survivors
trapped in two locations under the rubble.
"A third site has been identified where survivors may
be huddled " he said.
Rescuers were concentrating their efforts in areas
where they could hear tapping or muted voices, police
spokesman Superintendent Jaspher Ombati said.
"We have to move quickly to get them out," Ombati
said, adding that authorities were concerned about fur
ther collapse.
Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Gershon, leader of a team of sol
diers and other Israeli rescuers, said he was confident
more survivors would be rescued.
"If there are holes or air pockets, we can save many
people," he said as his team probed the rubble with ad
vanced detection equipment.

U.S. Marines and Navy engineers based in nearby Dji
bouti were on the scene and a British team of experts ar
rived Tuesday afternoon.
Gershon said eight bodies had been recovered and
two remained crushed in the rubble. Hospital officials
said four people had died while being treated.
Doctors appealed for blood donations at Kenyatta
General Hospital, where 42 were in stable condition.
One construction worker, who would not give his
name for fear of repercussions from his employer, said
Monday that an inspector had warned last week that the
structure was not safe and workers had been trying to
stabilize it.
Maj. Gen. Mohammed Hussein Ali, the police commis

sioner, said detectives have opened a criminal investigation
into the collapse. Local Government Minister Musikari
Kombo suspended four senior city engineers Tuesday.
"I'm suspending the officers who were directly in
volved in this project," Kombo said in a statement. "In
the meantime, a ministerial task force will be put in place
to investigate the matter and make recommendation to
the government."
Raila Odinga.the main opposition leader and a mem
ber of parliament, said a thorough investigation was
needed and that those found responsible should face the
death penalty.
"I suspect the building collapsed because they used
poor materials or that the job was rushed," he said.
