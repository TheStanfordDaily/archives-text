# Graduate Life
## Down by the Seashore — Students live, research at Hopkins 90 miles south of Stanford, graduate students dive into their dissertations 
### ANJALEE SUJANANI 
Life at Stanford normally con
jures up images of students bustling
about on our sylvan campus against
a backdrop of sloping hills.
But fora group of Stanford stu
dents at the Hopkins Marine Station
in Monterey, the waters of the scenic
peninsula have replaced classrooms
on the Farm.
Founded in 1892, the Hopkins
Marine Station is a marine biology
facility that functions as a research
and educational branch of the De
partment of Biological Sciences at
Stanford. The station provides stu
dents with a unique opportunity to
observe and research the marine
world first-hand.
However, due to the distance be
tween Stanford and Hopkins, there
arises a need to give these students
the same cultural and intellectual
stimulation that the main campus
provides.
This need has been recognized by
the Hopkins Marine Station Gradu
ate Student Organization (HMSG
SO), which consists of all graduate
students in residence at the Hopkins
Marine Station.
"The group was created by the
students to coordinate activities and
provide community support that
cannot be gained from opportunities
on the main campus due to the dis
tance," says fourth-year biological
sciences doctoral student Heather
Galindo.
Galindo, who is doing full-time
research at Hopkins, says that many
people at Stanford are not even
aware of their existence.
This is what inspires many of
HMSGSO's endeavors.
"The HMSGSO makes up a sig
nificant portion of the Department
of Biological Sciences at Stanford
and every year provides important
contributions to the field of biologi
cal sciences," Galindo says.
She adds that Hopkins gives both
graduate and undergraduate stu
dents the chance to "conduct state
of-the-art research — both in the
lab and in the field — along with ac
cess to faculty members that you just
can't find on the main campus. The
efforts of the HMSGSO are aimed
at improving our visibility on and
connection to the main campus, im
proving life for graduate students in
residence at Hopkins and making
contributions to our surrounding
community through outreach."
According to Galindo, the HMS
GSO has organized events such as
the Hopkins Open House in 2(X)3,
weekly station-wide student semi
nars, academic and career-building
workshops and educational outreach
activities.
And in early November last year,
the student group Students for Col
laborations on Ocean Research and
Education (SCORE) — which con
sisted of four core members of
HMSGSO — hosted an interdisci
plinary Oceans Research Colloqui
um at the marine station.
"Although a large number of lab
oratories at Stanford are conducting
world-class research on marine,
coastal and estuarine conservation
problems.no formal forum currently
exists in which Stanford graduate
students with common ocean-relat
ed interests and research goals can
interact," a SCORE publication
says.
The colloquium aimed to address
this problem by initiating relation
ships between research laboratories
so that future avenues of permanent
communication could be made pos
sible.
Galindo says that future outreach
activities "include tentative plans for
another Hopkins Open House and
educational activities with
groups...that visit our campus each
year. We are also on the lookout for
opportunities to bring additional ca
reer and academic workshops to our
community."
The Hopkins Open House lets
the public view research and visit the
marine station, which is usually re
stricted to University faculty, stu
dents and station personnel.
In addition to research, Danna
Shulman. a second-year biological
sciences doctoral student, says that
undergraduate courses are also of
fered at Hopkins.
"Some excellent teaching faculty
offer several really stellar courses
each quarter, and undergrads who
come down to Hopkins to take one
or more of these classes are housed

within walking distance of the ma
rine station "she says."lt's a neat op
portunity for us to have some under
grads around, and for some lucky
undergrads to see a gorgeous part of
campus they normally wouldn't be
exposed to."
So. what is it like for Stanford stu
dents to be living on the Monterey
Peninsula, 90 miles south of the
Farm?
"Living in Monterey is outstand
ing for folks who like the outdoors,
especially the water," says Christian
Reilly. who had his biological sci
ences doctoral degree conferred this
month. "In my free time I do a lot of
surfing, and I do a lot of hiking with
my dog and new daughter."
Cialindo admits that it can be dif
ficult at times, but believes that de
spite the spacial isolation. Hopkins
fosters a close-knit community
among its residents.
"There is no permanent housing

for graduate students at the station
so all students live off campus,"
Galindo says. "Although the dis
tance from Palo Alto does create
both academic and some personal
inconveniences, the Monterey
Peninsula is a beautiful small-town
environment with lots of opportuni
ties for those who like to be out
doors."
Since Melissa Adams, a doctoral
student in marine microbial physiol
ogy and ecology, is being co-advised
with an advisor at Hopkins and on
the main campus, she says she feels
she has the best of both worlds. She
spends the majority of her time at
Hopkins and visits the Stanford
campus every other week.
"1 hope to learn techniques and
take more microbial courses on
main campus that I can transfer to
the station in order to initiate re
search on marine microbial life," she
says, adding that the "main campus is

also a good source of seminars as
well as student interest groups."
Biological sciences student Car
rie Kappel. who completed her Ph.D
last month, says that Monterey is a
beautiful place to live, and those
with active lifestyles enjoy hiking,
diving, surfing and hiking right out
side their front doors.
"We've been especially blessed
by the amazing community of peo
ple at the marine station," she says,
adding that "people here look out
for each other — there are always
helping hands around whether
you're moving houses, beating your
head against some statistical analy
sis or looking for someone to watch
your dog."
Kappel sums up the sentiments
echoed by many graduate students
at the Hopkins Marine station:
"It's a pretty special place."
Research at the Station

With nine labs, the Hopkins facil
ity enables students to carry out an
array of marine biology research.
"There are currently 21 graduate
students in residence at Hopkins
with four more set to come down
from the main campus in the spring,"
Galindo says. "These 25 students
comprise a significant portion of the
110 total graduate students in the Bi
ological Sciences Department, with
research interests spanning from
molecular.cellular and developmen
tal biology to ecology, evolution and
biophysics."
Young giant squid
"We're lucky to be located literal
ly next door to the Monterey Bay
Aquarium," says Shulman. "So some
students and lab groups have collab
orated both with the aquarium and
with the Monterey Bay Aquarium
Research Institute (MBARI), which
is located about half an hour up the
coast."
Shulman. who is specializing in
integrative/organismal biology,
works in the Gilly Lab at Ilopkins.
"One of the big projects in the
Gilly Lab is on the jumbo — or
Humboldt — squid. Dosidicus
gigas." she says. "Gilly has been on
numerous expeditions to tag and re
lease these animals. The tag records
time and depth information which is
transmitted via satellite, so we can
learn about the squid's behavior and
migratory patterns."
Shulman says that in June 2(M)5.
she went on an MBARI cruise with
her advisor "to catch jumbo squid
off the back of the boat and bring
them on board for respirometry ex
periments." which involved measur
ing the rates of breathing and oxy
gen consumption at a variety of tem
peratures and oxygen concentra
tions.
According to Shulman. this helps
researches learn about squids' me
tabolism and provides insight into
how active they can be at the depths
recorded by the tags.
Shulman adds that her own re
search is likely to be focused on the
early life history of the jumbo squid
— namely, the biology of young
squid.
"Dosidicus hatchlings...are very
small and we know verv little about

them," she says. "They can some
times be caught in plankton nets, but
I would like to raise them in labora
tory conditions to observe their be
havior and development."
Intertidal environments
"I am currently beginning a col
laboration — advised by Prof.
George Somero of Hopkins and
Prof. Chris Francis of the geo
sciences department — to investi
gate microbial physiology and diver
sity in the rocky intertidal zone,"
Adams says.
"My research is aimed at eluci
dating the taxonomic composition
and physiological adaptations of mi
crobes in the rocky intertidal envi
ronment. where organisms face ex
tremes of temperature, salinity and
oxygen availability," she continues.
She says that the broader impli
cations of the research include
achieving greater understanding of
how microbes work in ecological
dilemmas, such as climate change.
"A side interest of mine is com
parative physiology," Adams adds."l
hope to go to Antarctica one day to
study microbial life in this extreme
environment and investigate how
fluctuating temperatures may affect
bacterial composition in polar re
gions."
Hiimuns and ecology
Kappel specializes in marine
community ecology and conserva
tion biology and works at the Miche
li Lab at Hopkins. Her dissertation
research was part of the Bahamas
Biocomplexity Project.
' Iliis is an interdisciplinary proj
ect that involves ecologists,oceanog
raphers, economists, sociologists, ge
neticists and mathematical model
ers, all aimed at understanding the
coupled human and natural dynam
ics of marine reserve network design
for the Bahamas archipelago," Kap
pel says.
She continues."the Bahamas is in
the process of establishing a network
of no take marine reserves, which
may eventually protect as much as 20
percent of their marine environ
ment. 1 lowever.they have little base
line data upon which to base scientif
ic design of this reserve network."

Kappel explains that the project
— which involves marine habitat
mapping, detailed fish, invertebrate,
and algal surveys, sociological sur
veys, and analytical and Geographi
cal Information System (GIS)
model development — "will put
critical information and decision
support tools in the hands of man
agers and decision makers in the
country."
Fishes' night vision
Reilly's thesis was titled "Ther
mal Noise Effects on Low-Light
Sensitivity and Effects of Sensitivity

Variation in the Retinae of Rockfish
(Genus Sebastes)".
"I worked on night vision in
fishes, and the effects of tempera
ture changes and light pollution on
the ability of fish to use their night
vision to relate to their environ
ment," Reilly says."In my mind, it
was close to the perfect combina
tion of laboratory neurobiology,
and field scuba collections and ob
servations."
Reilly explains that he is interest
ed in how differences in vision re
late to differences in lifestyle.
"Rockfish are a neat group of
fish — there are over 1(X) species,
and they segregate the environment
in all different ways — depth, lati
tude and, especially interesting to
me, by diurnal and nocturnal activi
ty," he savs.
