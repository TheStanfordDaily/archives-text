## Editorial Dorm staff should create party registry calendar 
### 
Anyone who had hoped to "drop it
like it's Bob" on Friday night and
then tried to choose which fraternity
to party at on Saturday experienced a com
mon problem of the Stanford social scene
— there are either too many or too few par
ties on any given weekend night. This issue
seems easily remedied, given the technolo
gy and networking at students' disposal.
Currently, no central party registry openly
exists for party planners, who struggle to
choose dates for their social events. We rec
ommend that such a service be created in
order to facilitate party planning — often a
difficult and thankless job.
One possible solution would be for the
Office of Student Activities to be the central
coordinating body for registering parties.
Currently, those planning registered all
campus parties must already go through the
office but don't have access to a master cal
endar indicating all upcoming registered
parties. Student Activities could maintain
such a calendar online and grant students
access to view it. A potential problem with
this is that those outside of the Stanford
community could gain access to this calen
dar. However, this can be easily avoided by
requiring a SUNet ID to enter the site.
This solution, however, would be un
wieldy and difficult to establish. It would in
volve significant red tape, unnecessarily add
to the bureaucracy involved in hosting
events and force University administrators
to assume the cumbersome position of party
planning — a role not in their job descrip
tions. As such, it is unlikely to get off the
ground.
A more reasonable alternative — and
one that we are hopeful will come to fruition
— would be for Row and Greek social man
agers and dorm RAs to coordinate through
an online scheduling program — such as
Yahoo Calendar — a database to which
only they would have the password.This op
tion seems more logical, as well, given that
the primary' concern is planning parties —

not promoting them to the campus at large.
Two risks seem evident in this solution;
fortunately, both are easily addressed. First,
there is the legitimate worry that the pass
word for this Web site would be widely dis
seminated not only outside of the party
planning community, but beyond the Stan
ford community. However, given that the
events listed on this site are by their very na
ture registered parties that are closed to
Stanford outsiders, this would not be as
problematic as it first appears. Student IDs
are required to enter these events, so even if
outsiders learned of them, they theoretical
ly would not be able to attend. Unregistered
parties, which do not require student IDs,
are irrelevant to this fear because they
would not be on the calendar.
Second, unhoused fraternities and soror
ities and cultural and other organizations
would not have access to this site, despite
their hosting of campus-wide events. Such
events, however, generally take place in a
dorm or Row house, and as such can be co
ordinated in conjunction with a residence
staff member. In instances like the
Queer/Straight Alliance's Genderfuk,
which is not housed in a campus residence
but inTresidder,event planners may contact
the Web site's administrator instead. One
student, under whose e-mail address the site
could be registered, would need to volun
teer to be the central contact for anyone
wishing access to this information for legiti
mate reasons. The burden on this student
would not be too great, because such in
stances are rare and it is unlikely that it will
be necessary for planners to contact the ad
ministrator very often.
We're hopeful that enterprising social
managers or RAs will take the initiative to
coordinate such a calendar system. That
way, by the time of spring quarter's Notori
ous B O B. party, the student body will be
able to expect a full but not overloaded
gamut of social options on every Friday and
Saturday.
