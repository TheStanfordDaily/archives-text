# Radical thinkers are like, rad, dude

### 
If 1 were a student at UCLA, I'd be pretty
confused right now. I mean, is conserva
tive alumnus Andrew Jones going to pay
me $ KM) for tape recordings and lecture
notes or not? He also said he'd settle for $50
for just the handwritten notes and $10 for
course handouts. If I'm sick one day, will he
pay me $45? What if he can't read my hand
writing? $35? And am I supposed to report
this income to the 1.R.5.? Will he deduct my
Social Security contribution? I might need
those benefits later in life.
Perhaps Andrew confused UCLA with
the University of Phoenix-online. From
what I've been told.its lecture recordings are
available quite easily. You don't have to pur
chase them from ramen-noodle-guzzling
college students with bad handwriting. An
drew, you can just download them via the In
ternet and let the learning begin!
However, from what I gather, Andrew
isn't interested in obtaining lecture record
ings, notes or handouts in an effort to contin
ue his education, like some of us die-hard
grad students do. Instead, he uses the infor
mation to advance a project called the
"Dirty Thirty" list from the Bruin Alumni
Association that "exposes UCLA's radical
professors." [Side note: According to The
New York Times, "The Bruin Alumni Asso
ciation is essentially a one-man operation
run out of Mr. Jones's apartment in Culver
City." ("Conservative alumnus pulls offer to
buy lecture tapes," Jan. 24)]
Now, I realize that I'm not "hip" with the
lingo of today's college students because
when I was younger, the term "radical" was
n't typically spoken in such a derogatory
tone. In fact, it was a word that was thrown
around carelessly by the Californian
speaking "Teenage Mutant Ninja TUrtles"
who — somehow — picked up that way of
conversing in the sewers of New York City.
According to them, everything was radical
— or "rad" as they often abbreviated the
term.
It was then, as an impressionable youth
growing up in Montana, that I began to ad
mire the radical things in life. Instead of
killing evil mutants, I was radical by getting
straight A's. attending regular marching
band rehearsals and excelling at one-player
video games. I didn't have many friends, no.
I wasn't "popular" in the sense that I con
formed to most people's ideas of what being
"cool" involved. Nope. I was just the "rad"
little gay Native American kid that rode
around on his bike making motorcycle nois
es. occasionally riding around outside the

house of a boy I had a crush on. often hoping
to get into an accident that required mouth
to-mouth resuscitation.
My suspicion is that Andrew's attack on
the most "radical" faculty members at
UCLA is. in fact, an effort to identify the
most "liberal" professors. But who is to say
that they are one and the same? Certainly
you can be liberal without being radical and
vice versa. And if we went by my definition
of liberal, nobody would really be all that
radical these days.
I think it's safe to say that Andrew and I
disagree on much more than politics. In my
opinion, radical people make the world go
round (or at least make it a much more in
teresting place in which to live). We need
radical people as professors because they
promote ways of thinking that deviate from
the status quo. It's not necessarily the con
tent of their teaching that always matters,
but the ways that they provide the inspira
tion for critical thinking, challenging nor
mative structures and surpassing medioc
rity. I see radical people, from both sides of
the spectrum, as valuable learning tools
that enhance and promote the growth and
development of new knowledge and ideas.
It takes courage to be different — be you a
gay boy in Montana or a professor at
UCLA.
For that reason. I can see why Andrew
Jones is interested in identifying the radical
professors at UCLA. It is obvious that he is
a product of their teaching because, as a rad
ical thinker himself. Andrew was thinking
outside of the box when he offered to pay
UCLA students for taped recordings, hand
written notes and handouts from their cours
es. Sure, he failed to research UCLA's policy
on academic freedom, copyright infringe
ment or student code of conduct. After all,
those are minor details, even if they did re
quire him to rescind his offer.

radical people as professors because they
promote ways of thinking that deviate from
the status quo. It's not necessarily the con
tent of their teaching that always matters,
but the ways that they provide the inspira
tion for critical thinking, challenging nor
mative structures and surpassing medioc
rity. I see radical people, from both sides of
the spectrum, as valuable learning tools
that enhance and promote the growth and
development of new knowledge and ideas.
It takes courage to be different — be you a
gay boy in Montana or a professor at
UCLA.
For that reason. I can see why Andrew
Jones is interested in identifying the radical
professors at UCLA. It is obvious that he is
a product of their teaching because, as a rad
ical thinker himself. Andrew was thinking
outside of the box when he offered to pay
UCLA students for taped recordings, hand
written notes and handouts from their cours
es. Sure, he failed to research UCLA's policy
on academic freedom, copyright infringe
ment or student code of conduct. After all,
those are minor details, even if they did re
quire him to rescind his offer.

you 'd like to teach him CPR — that is, if you
don't find him in an accident outside of Rohle
or Mirrielees.
