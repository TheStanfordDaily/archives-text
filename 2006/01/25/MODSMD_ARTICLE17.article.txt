# The 						reality tragedy
## 
### 
I recently asked myself a question: Why do
my columns generally address meaning
less topics? Perhaps I only contemplate
meaningless topics — this seems fairly plausi
ble. Or maybe I can't conceive of anything
complicated as being interesting (also plausi
ble). Or perhaps I think the Stanford commu
nity doesn't want to exercise its brain when
reading The Daily; we exercise it enough as it
is. However, none of these produced an "aha"
moment for me. It wasn't until I journeyed to
the CNN homepage for my daily helping of
tragedy and useless anecdotes that my realiza
tion occurred — the news, as we once knew it,
is gone. Reality television nation... here's your
reality tragedy.
As I write this article, the CNN Web site has
a disturbing set of stories on its currently listed
top 10. including:"Lifesaving Mount Olympus
rescue,""AFC champs Motown bound," "U.S.
Navy destroyer captures pirate ship." "Why
don't cops drive foreign cars?" Though they
satisfy our appetite for the sensational, these
stories are not world-moving events.
Similarly, consider some of the protracted
news stories that have gripped the nation over
the last year: the Terri Schiavo "debate,"
Michael Jackson's trial, the miners trapped in
West Virginia and various trials related to
"cool" moms or teachers having sex with
teenage boys. When selecting from the billions
of human events in the world, it's not hard to
find reality news stories that can rival the con
trived reality shows put on by major networks.
We, in turn, become emotionally hooked to
these developing tales involving real people in
distress and their eventual fates.
The Schiavo story, for instance, was a na
tional embarrassment of epic proportions.
What was a special case in medicine and the
law (that only an infinitesimal percentage of
the nation will ever face in their life) became
the obsession of the entire country. So much so
that the U.S. government was brought to its
knees as it yielded to public pressure to react
to the events.

This was a case where the news made news.
If the networks didn't sell us the Schiavo case
as the next reality tragedy, nobody in Congress
would have even heard about it and the situa
tion would have been dealt with through nor
mal processes. Did this issue need national
emergency attention from Congress, the most
powerful ruling body on Earth?
Like the Schiavo case, the recent story
about the trapped West Virginia miners pulled
some heartstrings and promptly became a na
tional spectacle, consuming the attention of
the media for three days. Yet to put this event
in perspective, more children died drowning
in swimming pools during that 72-hour period
(statistically) than West Virginian miners.
Also, more miners died in China per day last
year than were lost in this incident.
"Why not gawk, "you say."What did we re
ally miss out on?" As it happens, during the 72-
hour rescue effort. Russia and the Ukraine
struck a landmark gas deal, the EU held talks
on the oil crisis, the Fed indicated it planned to
stop raising interest rates, India and Pakistan
considered a Kashmir troop pull-out. Western
agencies reported Iran's plan to build nuclear
missiles and China confirmed a new bird-flu
outbreak in its southwestern interior.
Ihat's some heavy stuff, yet we found our
selves more consumed by a heartfelt narrative
involving miners in West Virginia. If it's not
news, why does CNN peddle it?
Well, if you've ever seen the Hearst Castle
just down Highway 1, the answer is pretty
straight forward — it sells. In the early 1900s,
newspaper magnate William Randolph

Hearst adorned his castle with countless
sculptures, paintings and structures now con
sidered priceless. Most were crafted or built
during antiquity and imported by Hearst from
Europe to his 127-acre coastal estate. Hearst
then populated his monster parkland with at
least 30 species of exotic animals including
tigers, zebras and kangaroos. I guess it pays to
be a newspaper magnate.
The truth is it paid particularly well for
Hearst. Known as the father of yellow journal
ism, he began publishing human interest sto
ries that "equated the sensational reporting of
murders, gory accidents and the like, with the
need of the democratic common man to be
entertained by subjects beyond dry politics."
These journalistic meanderings were hardly
innocuous. In the 1890s. Hearst engaged in se
lective, biased and highly sensationalized re
porting of the sufferings of Cubans at the
hands of the Spanish. These stories eventually
led to great public outcry and the possibly un
justified declaration of the Spanish-American
war.
Things did change with time, however.
Around 1910, yellow journalism fell out of
favor. Circulation of newspapers that ran such
stories fell dramatically. There were no wor
ries for Hearst though; he was busy building a
ludicrous castle. But the question is, have we
come full circle? Has yellow journalism re
turned?
The government's reaction to the Schia
vo obsession is oddly reminiscent of the
journalistic fomenting of the Spanish-
American War. CNN should cover events of
domestic and global relevance and leave the
human interest stories to Nightline, Good
Morning America and 60 Minutes. When
the content of these sources becomes con
flated, as it is now, the public loses sight of
which issues are important on a national or
global scale. Let's just hope that CNN, in the
mean time, does not compel us to pick a

So, America, in conclusion, here
are your top two most-read
CNN.com news stories on this Sun
day, Jan. 22,2(X)6, respectively: "Lux

mutiny" and "Terri Schiavo widower

distress and their eventual fates.
The Schiavo story, for instance, was a na
tional embarrassment of epic proportions.
What was a special case in medicine and the
law (that only an infinitesimal percentage of
the nation will ever face in their life) became
the obsession of the entire country. So much so
that the U.S. government was brought to its
knees as it yielded to public pressure to react
to the events.

This was a case where the news made news.
If the networks didn't sell us the Schiavo case
as the next reality tragedy, nobody in Congress
would have even heard about it and the situa
tion would have been dealt with through nor
mal processes. Did this issue need national
emergency attention from Congress, the most
powerful ruling body on Earth?
Like the Schiavo case, the recent story
about the trapped West Virginia miners pulled
some heartstrings and promptly became a na
tional spectacle, consuming the attention of
the media for three days. Yet to put this event
in perspective, more children died drowning
in swimming pools during that 72-hour period
(statistically) than West Virginian miners.
Also, more miners died in China per day last
year than were lost in this incident.
"Why not gawk, "you say."What did we re
ally miss out on?" As it happens, during the 72-
hour rescue effort. Russia and the Ukraine
struck a landmark gas deal, the EU held talks
on the oil crisis, the Fed indicated it planned to
stop raising interest rates, India and Pakistan
considered a Kashmir troop pull-out. Western
agencies reported Iran's plan to build nuclear
missiles and China confirmed a new bird-flu
outbreak in its southwestern interior.
Ihat's some heavy stuff, yet we found our
selves more consumed by a heartfelt narrative
involving miners in West Virginia. If it's not
news, why does CNN peddle it?
Well, if you've ever seen the Hearst Castle
just down Highway 1, the answer is pretty
straight forward — it sells. In the early 1900s,
newspaper magnate William Randolph

Hearst adorned his castle with countless
sculptures, paintings and structures now con
sidered priceless. Most were crafted or built
during antiquity and imported by Hearst from
Europe to his 127-acre coastal estate. Hearst
then populated his monster parkland with at
least 30 species of exotic animals including
tigers, zebras and kangaroos. I guess it pays to
be a newspaper magnate.
The truth is it paid particularly well for
Hearst. Known as the father of yellow journal
ism, he began publishing human interest sto
ries that "equated the sensational reporting of
murders, gory accidents and the like, with the
need of the democratic common man to be
entertained by subjects beyond dry politics."
These journalistic meanderings were hardly
innocuous. In the 1890s. Hearst engaged in se
lective, biased and highly sensationalized re
porting of the sufferings of Cubans at the
hands of the Spanish. These stories eventually
led to great public outcry and the possibly un
justified declaration of the Spanish-American
war.
Things did change with time, however.
Around 1910, yellow journalism fell out of
favor. Circulation of newspapers that ran such
stories fell dramatically. There were no wor
ries for Hearst though; he was busy building a
ludicrous castle. But the question is, have we
come full circle? Has yellow journalism re
turned?
The government's reaction to the Schia
vo obsession is oddly reminiscent of the
journalistic fomenting of the Spanish-
American War. CNN should cover events of
domestic and global relevance and leave the
human interest stories to Nightline, Good
Morning America and 60 Minutes. When
the content of these sources becomes con
flated, as it is now, the public loses sight of
which issues are important on a national or
global scale. Let's just hope that CNN, in the
mean time, does not compel us to pick a

I recently asked myself a question: Why do
my columns generally address meaning
less topics? Perhaps I only contemplate
meaningless topics — this seems fairly plausi
ble. Or maybe I can't conceive of anything
complicated as being interesting (also plausi
ble). Or perhaps I think the Stanford commu
nity doesn't want to exercise its brain when
reading The Daily; we exercise it enough as it
is. However, none of these produced an "aha"
moment for me. It wasn't until I journeyed to
the CNN homepage for my daily helping of
tragedy and useless anecdotes that my realiza
tion occurred — the news, as we once knew it,
is gone. Reality television nation... here's your
reality tragedy.
As I write this article, the CNN Web site has
a disturbing set of stories on its currently listed
top 10. including:"Lifesaving Mount Olympus
rescue,""AFC champs Motown bound," "U.S.
Navy destroyer captures pirate ship." "Why
don't cops drive foreign cars?" Though they
satisfy our appetite for the sensational, these
stories are not world-moving events.
Similarly, consider some of the protracted
news stories that have gripped the nation over
the last year: the Terri Schiavo "debate,"
Michael Jackson's trial, the miners trapped in
West Virginia and various trials related to
"cool" moms or teachers having sex with
teenage boys. When selecting from the billions
of human events in the world, it's not hard to
find reality news stories that can rival the con
trived reality shows put on by major networks.
We, in turn, become emotionally hooked to
these developing tales involving real people in
distress and their eventual fates.
