University should take stronger
stance regarding AD lawsuit
I am disappointed with University Coun
sel Patrick Dunkley's insufficient and uncon
vincing responses ("Facts emerge in AD law
suit." Jan. 17 and "Lawsuit article mislead
ing," Jan. 20) to charges that Department of
Athletics employees — including a candi
date for the Athletic Director position —
previously tried to cover up reimbursements
for strip club outings (where alcohol was pre
sumably served) with underage athletic re
cruits, as well as to accusations of employee
harassment and retaliation.
From Dunkley's troubling responses, we
do not get the sense that the University cares

much about anything but avoiding legal re
sponsibility. It would have been nice if he had
said, unequivocally and on the record, that it
is completely outrageous for the Athletics
Department — or any department — to pay
for recruiting trips to strip clubs. It also would
have been nice if he had reminded us that the
University takes very seriously any sort of
workplace harassment, even while it at
tempts to defend itself against specific
charges. Instead, he brushes aside the trou
bling nature of the allegations and essential
ly tells us that the University technically did
nothing wrong and that it subsequently
changed the rules, with the impetus behind
that rule change becoming widely known
only now, years later.

If. as has been charged, certain Athletic
Department employees took any part in at
tempting to cover up reimbursements for
strip club outings — let alone engaged in the
sort of retaliation behavior that has been al
leged (fora jury to decide) — then those in
dividuals should not be considered for the
Athletic Department's top position. Of
course, I know only what is reported in the
media and it is possible that no wrongdoing
occurred, but I am left feeling disappointed
with the University's inadequate response.
On a more positive note, thank you to The
Daily for thoroughly reporting on this story.
