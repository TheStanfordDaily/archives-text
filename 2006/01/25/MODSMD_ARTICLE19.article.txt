# More tales from the city
## 
### 
Some time ago, as I was perched at the bar of The
750, struggling to create my weekly masterpiece
for The Daily, a friend suggested checking out the
apparently hilarious Web site "Overheard in New
York" for inspiration.
The premise of the site is to post conversational
snippets that people have, well, overheard in New
York. While this may not seem like the most spectacu
lar use of server space, it turns out that people say the
darnedest things.
Now as it happened. I managed to come up with a
witty and brilliant column that week without the aid of
an electronic muse. What's more. New York chatter did
n't seem particularly relevant to life in the bubble, where
an overheard conversation is usually about the week's
problem set.
Despite all of this, the site stuck in my mind, and 1
found myself flicking to it more and more frequently, es
pecially after 1 moved to the city.
I had initially assumed that people just made their
submissions up; after all, it is the Internet — the whole
point is to make stuff up. However, I've been spending
more time in urban environments lately and it turns out
that, in fact, many folks say really odd things in public.
My newly-acquired complete collection of "Buffy
the Vampire Slayer" DVDs means that 1 can no longer
get any work done at home, so I've relocated to the
local cafes.
Such places are — beyond being purveyors of liquid
decadence — bubbling hotbeds of social interaction.
Being somewhat deprived of such social interaction as a
graduate student, I find that watching other people at it
is surprisingly soothing.
The location of choice for this sort of thing in my
neighborhood is the über-trendy "Ritual Coffee Roast
ers." The interior of this place looks a little like the floor
of an Apple showroom — complete with the requisite
gaggle of hipsters armed with the usual Powerbook and
iPod fashion accessories.
As one sits down and settles in with a long calculation

and a hot cup of tea, one swiftly realizes that the back
ground chatter is really quite remarkable.
While the denizens of the Mission District are defi
nitely of a particular type, there is enough variety to
keep one entertained. I've overheard tales of sexual
conquest, corporate deals, musical inspirations, aca
demic debates and a surprising number of conversa
tions on body piercing.
Actually. I don't think that what one can overhear in
a city is generally more exciting that what you might pick
up elsewhere (Palo Alto, as the dullest place on the plan
et, being an exception). Rather, other people's thoughts
are much harder to pick out in the suburbs.
Cities are turbulent; they carry their color and their
excesses on the surface. Furthermore, I'm new here.
Without ties to anchor you in place and relationships
to keep you occupied, you get to spend a great deal
more time on your own. disconnected from your sur
roundings.
That slight sense of separation, combined with the
thrill of the new is, I suppose, at the heart of what makes
urban life so appealing after immersion in Stanford's de
pressingly inadequate campus life.
Plus, not only do I get to overhear the wacky thoughts
of the locals, I'm also picking up some real useful tips...
