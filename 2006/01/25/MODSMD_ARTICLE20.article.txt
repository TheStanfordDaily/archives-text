## Cardinal Stay on Top 
### DENIS GRIFFIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford wrestlers hosted Cal State
Fullerton on Monday in a matchup of Pacific
-10 Conference rivals. Fresh off of their win over
Cal State Bakersfield Friday, the Cardinal (5-3.
2-0) built themselves a two-game win streak as
they defeated the Titans 26-11, gaining confi
dence and momentum in the process.
"This was a good win," head coach Kerry
McCoy said. "We had some rough spots, but the
guys fought hard. We were at a high level of in
tensity. We were better than we were on Friday
night, and we're getting better every time out."
With their two victories, the Stanford
wrestlers have now defeated two Pac-1() teams
of superior conference rank in the last week.
And while the latest rankings still show the
Cardinal at eighth in the Pac-10, the team can
expect continued success to improve its confer
ence standing.
"Everyone's getting some success, and
everyone likes it a lot," said 165-pound senior
Ray Blake.a team captain."! think they want to
keep it up. I think we're just building momen
tum. Guys are going to work harder because
they want that success. We're beating teams
that we haven't beaten in years, and hopefully
that will continue."
The Cardinal started rolling early in the
match against Fullerton (2-10, 0-6). Heavy
weight redshirt freshman Jared Boyer notched
his first conference victory in an 8-5 decision
over the Titans' Matt Methling. Afterwards,
125-pound sophomore captain Tanner Gard
ner earned a technical fall against Johnny
Rojas of Fullerton to put Stanford on top 8-0.
The Cardinal eventually rolled out to a 14-4
lead before the real drama of the night began.
Sophomore Scott Loescher, weighing in at
157 pounds, jumped out to a big 8-1 lead over
his opponent early. But Loescher found himself
in overtime after Fullerton s Shawn Reilly No.
5 in the Pac-10 fought his way back into the
match. For Loescher, the story had a happy
ending, as he scored quickly in overtime to take
the 15-11 win. But 174-pound redshirt fresh
man Luke Feist, who also allowed his opponent
back into a match after dominating early,lost 8-

7 under similar circumstances.
"I think he started to think about it and tried
to hang onto the lead a little bit and stopped
wrestling," McCoy said. "It's kind of like in
football when you put the prevent defense on.
You go out there in prevent mode â€” and
you're not wrestling. You try and hang on and
you stop. And you're getting away from your
power and the things you do well."
Blake, who had the match between Loesch
er'sand Feist's, wrestled with a more aggressive
style than usual to earn an 11 -4 victory.

"Scott had been cruising and then he fell a
little bit behind at the end, and they were get
ting a little bit of momentum," Blake said. "I
felt like the team kind of needed a spark. So I
felt like I. being a senior captain and every
thing. had to go out and wrestle with some in
tensity and inspire some of the other guys."
Blake's match turned out to be the last Stan
ford highlight of the evening. The Cardinal
would go on to win only one of their final three
matches as junior lan Bork won by forfeit. Nev
ertheless, Stanford now takes a two-match win

ning streak into its road meet with UC-Davis
this Friday.
"It's always nice to think about what hap
pened before,but you can't dwell on it," McCoy
said."The guys will enjoy it now, but it's back to
work tomorrow. UC-Davis is definitely one of
the top teams in the conference,and we have to
go out there and wrestle better than we did
tonight to be able to compete with them. But I
know that we can do it. If our guys continue to
believe in themselves, we should have similar
results."
