## Freshman Bruch takes collegiate tennis world by storm 
### BEN BACKES 
After a disappointing season and the de
parture of senior All-American Sam Warburg.
Stanford's tennis team needed some help. It
came in the form of freshman Matt Bruch.
In his first few months on the Farm, Bruch
has had more success than many do in an en
tire career. After a semifinal appearance in
the All-American Championships in his first
college tournament,he reached the quarterfi
nals of the National Indoor Championships
and the finals of the Sherwood Cup two
weeks ago in Ibousand Oaks, Calif.
Bruch. who is the fourth-ranked singles
player in the country, has dropped only three
of his 18 singles matches this year. He has also
enjoyed success in doubles, reaching the fi
nals of the Sherwood Cup with James Pade.
Stanford can thank its winning tradition
and strong academic reputation for luring the
freshman here. For Bruch. the decision to
come to Stanford was an easy one.
"I think if you ask any athlete here, I don't
think there's a school that's a better combina
tion of academics and athletics," Bruch said.
"Every sport is one of the best and you really
can't beat that. Every varsity sport gets some

of the best recruits and best athletes in the na
tion coming to play."
Ilie decision about whether to play profes
sional or college tennis was a more difficult
one. Bruch put his professional tennis career
on hold for the opportunity to develop first.
"'lhe reason why I chose college is to start
my education and get my degree," Bruch said.
"I also need to physically develop some more
to get stronger and a little bit bigger. Other
wise I would have gone 011 to play. Otherwise,
whenever I finish, if I can't make it in tennis I
can come back and have that degree."
Bruch, who started playing when he was
seven years old, also played some baseball
and golf before choosing tennis. Although he
has played tennis most of his life, the team
oriented college game is a contrast to the in
dividual tournaments in which juniors play.
Bruch understands what it takes to win at the
college level.
"I watched Stanford play in Chicago last
year, and it seems like there's so much more
to having a team because tennis is such an in
dividual sport," said Bruch, who has only
played in one dual match. "It's just as impor
tant for me to win and KC [Corkery] and
James |Pade| at the top of the lineup as it is

for Blake [Muller], Phil Kao and James Wan
to win at their respective spots. Everybody's
equal, and you want the best for every per
son."
Bruch cites junior James Pade as someone
who has helped his transition to college ten
nis. After his loss in the Sherwood Cup final,
in which he was hampered by an injury, Bruch
needed a lift.
"I was frustrated and upset, and he was
able to sit me down and talk to me," said the
freshman. "You can't ask for anybody better
than that, and I'm thankful to have that."
Pade has been happy with the progress
he's seen in Bruch.
"It's been nice to see him do well," Pade
said."l've tried to help him in his transition to
college tennis because it is an individual
sport, and no one coming into college is used
to giving up time for the team."
Bruch has only played in one dual match,
but Stanford has three in the next week and a
half. Ihe last of those three is Feb. 4 against
UCLA, who beat Stanford twice last year.
Head coach John Whitlinger thinks Bruch is
ready for the challenge of team play.
" I he guy is a competitor, and he'll thrive in
the dual match situation," Whitlinyer said."l

can't wait to see it."
"I think he will definitely be ready," added
Pade. "It's a very quick learning experience."
Although Stanford has a tradition of ten
nis success, it has not won a team champi
onship since 1998. its longest drought in more
than 30 years. This year, Stanford will he the
first-ever host of a combined NCAA men's
and women's tennis championship. Bruch be
lieves there is some pressure to live up to past
performances by Cardinal tennis teams.
"When you have a lineage of incredible
players 1 think there has to be pressure, and I
think wc have the best lineup in the past cou
ple years," Bruch said. "There should be pres
sure because [the NCAA championshipj's
going to be at home, and we should be com
peting for it. We're more than happy to have
the pressure on us. Pressure is good if you can
channel it correctly."
Stanford hosts Hawaii tomorrow at 3 p.m.
Although Stanford beat Hawaii 7-0 in the
teams' previous meeting this season,
Whitlinger is ready to see his team out on the
courts.
"I can't wait to start out and get playing
matches," he said, "1 want to see a good com
petitive effort by our guys."

Bruch understands what it takes to win at the
college level.
"I watched Stanford play in Chicago last
year, and it seems like there's so much more
to having a team because tennis is such an in
dividual sport," said Bruch, who has only
played in one dual match. "It's just as impor
tant for me to win and KC [Corkery] and
James |Pade| at the top of the lineup as it is

for Blake [Muller], Phil Kao and James Wan
to win at their respective spots. Everybody's
equal, and you want the best for every per
son."
Bruch cites junior James Pade as someone
who has helped his transition to college ten
nis. After his loss in the Sherwood Cup final,
in which he was hampered by an injury, Bruch
needed a lift.
"I was frustrated and upset, and he was
able to sit me down and talk to me," said the
freshman. "You can't ask for anybody better
than that, and I'm thankful to have that."
Pade has been happy with the progress
he's seen in Bruch.
"It's been nice to see him do well," Pade
said."l've tried to help him in his transition to
college tennis because it is an individual
sport, and no one coming into college is used
to giving up time for the team."
Bruch has only played in one dual match,
but Stanford has three in the next week and a
half. Ihe last of those three is Feb. 4 against
UCLA, who beat Stanford twice last year.
Head coach John Whitlinger thinks Bruch is
ready for the challenge of team play.
" I he guy is a competitor, and he'll thrive in
the dual match situation," Whitlinyer said."l

can't wait to see it."
"I think he will definitely be ready," added
Pade. "It's a very quick learning experience."
Although Stanford has a tradition of ten
nis success, it has not won a team champi
onship since 1998. its longest drought in more
than 30 years. This year, Stanford will he the
first-ever host of a combined NCAA men's
and women's tennis championship. Bruch be
lieves there is some pressure to live up to past
performances by Cardinal tennis teams.
"When you have a lineage of incredible
players 1 think there has to be pressure, and I
think wc have the best lineup in the past cou
ple years," Bruch said. "There should be pres
sure because [the NCAA championshipj's
going to be at home, and we should be com
peting for it. We're more than happy to have
the pressure on us. Pressure is good if you can
channel it correctly."
Stanford hosts Hawaii tomorrow at 3 p.m.
Although Stanford beat Hawaii 7-0 in the
teams' previous meeting this season,
Whitlinger is ready to see his team out on the
courts.
"I can't wait to start out and get playing
matches," he said, "1 want to see a good com
petitive effort by our guys."
