# With Kobe, nothing is impossible
## 
### 
From week to week. I have at
tempted to make this column
the paragon of equal-opportu
nity coverage. While 1 generally
offer my opinions on a diverse num
ber of sports-related topics, recent
events of historical proportion have
forced me to come back to the topic
of Kobe Bryant.
By this point in the week, if you 1)
have been in the vicinity of any
sports fan, 2) flipped past ESPN
while trying to find something
worthwhile to watch at 2 a.m. any
time in the past three days or 3) are
even at least a casual fan of basket
ball, then you have undoubtedly
heard of Kobe's 81. For those of you
who have glanced through my last
few words, and still have no idea
what I'm talking about, "Kobe's 81"
is not a new band. But don't worry.
Just keep reading. You will be in
spired.

on Sunday night (and for that mat
ter, all over again on Monday too),
attempting to see just one more take
on Kobe's magnificent performance
Sunday night. I think I've finally ex
hausted them all, though the buzz
will no doubt inspire additional in
sights by writers across the nation
for some time to come.
In the mean time, here's one
more.
First, let me set the stage for those
who haven't heard. In the month of
January, up until Sunday night, Kobe
had been averaging an amazing 42
points per game, leading the Los An
geles Lakers' push for playoff con
tention (they're currently seventh in
the West). On Sunday night, Kobe
stepped on the court at the Staples
Center and prepared himself for just
another game against Toronto.
By halftime, he was holding a
Kobe-esque stat-line with 26 points
in 18 minutes, but the Lakers still
trailed the Raptors by 14 points, 49-
63.
'ITiat changed at about the nine
minute mark of the third quarter.
Kobe wasn't about to let the Lakers
lose. He took it upon himself to en
sure that his vision of victory would
not go unrealized that night. Bryant
just let loose on the Raptors, drain
ing contested shot after contested
shot, finishing the period with 27
points and a total of 53 with one
quarter still to play. By this point in
the game, the Lakers had taken the
lead, 91-85. It was a close-enough
game that I was sure Kobe would
have 60 by the end of the fourth pe
riod and might even beat his then
career high — set a few weeks ago
— of 62.
But Kobe had other plans. He

iced the game, making history all the
while. And as Chick Hearn, the late
legendary Lakers broadcaster
would have said, he made sure the
game was in the refrigerator, the
lights were out, the eggs were cool
ing, the butter was getting hard and
the Jello was assuredly jigglin'! And
when he drained his 18th free throw
of the game with 43 seconds remain
ing, Kobe tallied his 81st point of the
contest.
Just imagine the magnitude of
the scoring exhibition — these 81
points come in second in NBA histo
ry, trailing only Wilt Chaimberlain's
celebrated l(K)-point game. In his
magnificent performance. Wilt took
63 field goal attempts. By compari
son, Kobe took just 46 (not even a
career-high ... interpret this how you
may).
In fact, the astounding statistic
was that, up until that night, 99
squads this season had failed as an
entire team to match the scoring
output of Kobe's 81.Truly, the effort
was a sight to behold, and the ques
tions inevitably recurred: would
Kobe ever reach the ever-mythical
century mark? (It truly is mythical,
since there is no video footage of
Wilt's barrage of points.)
After all, several "experts" criti
cized Kobe in blogs and columns fol
lowing his three-quarter 62-point
showing in December. Iliey claimed
that he would never again have the
same chance to pursue history and
this was likely a feat that would not
be repeated in an enormously long
time. Iliey were wrong, unless by
"enormously long time".they meant
just a few weeks.
Kobe showed the world Sunday
night that he is currently the most
outstanding basketball player in the
league. This is a man in whom most
would be disappointed if he scored
fewer than 40 points on any given
night.
I think most would be satisfied
with being the best of the best-of
the-best at the peak of their careers.
But not Kobe. He admitted immedi
ately following the game that he
likely would not be able to under
stand the magnitude of the feat for
some time, but that he was ecstatic
about his team getting the "W."
It is Kobe's never-ending thirst to
win and to improve that leads him to
blaze his path to greatness — and as
he showed us one more time on Sun
day night, it is a thirst that is not and
will never be satisfied.

Kobe showed the world Sunday
night that he is currently the most
outstanding basketball player in the
league. This is a man in whom most
would be disappointed if he scored
fewer than 40 points on any given
night.
I think most would be satisfied
with being the best of the best-of
the-best at the peak of their careers.
But not Kobe. He admitted immedi
ately following the game that he
likely would not be able to under
stand the magnitude of the feat for
some time, but that he was ecstatic
about his team getting the "W."
It is Kobe's never-ending thirst to
win and to improve that leads him to
blaze his path to greatness — and as
he showed us one more time on Sun
day night, it is a thirst that is not and
will never be satisfied.
From week to week. I have at
tempted to make this column
the paragon of equal-opportu
nity coverage. While 1 generally
offer my opinions on a diverse num
ber of sports-related topics, recent
events of historical proportion have
forced me to come back to the topic
of Kobe Bryant.
By this point in the week, if you 1)
have been in the vicinity of any
sports fan, 2) flipped past ESPN
while trying to find something
worthwhile to watch at 2 a.m. any
time in the past three days or 3) are
even at least a casual fan of basket
ball, then you have undoubtedly
heard of Kobe's 81. For those of you
who have glanced through my last
few words, and still have no idea
what I'm talking about, "Kobe's 81"
is not a new band. But don't worry.
Just keep reading. You will be in
spired.

on Sunday night (and for that mat
ter, all over again on Monday too),
attempting to see just one more take
on Kobe's magnificent performance
Sunday night. I think I've finally ex
hausted them all, though the buzz
will no doubt inspire additional in
sights by writers across the nation
for some time to come.
In the mean time, here's one
more.
First, let me set the stage for those
who haven't heard. In the month of
January, up until Sunday night, Kobe
had been averaging an amazing 42
points per game, leading the Los An
geles Lakers' push for playoff con
tention (they're currently seventh in
the West). On Sunday night, Kobe
stepped on the court at the Staples
Center and prepared himself for just
another game against Toronto.
By halftime, he was holding a
Kobe-esque stat-line with 26 points
in 18 minutes, but the Lakers still
trailed the Raptors by 14 points, 49-
63.
'ITiat changed at about the nine
minute mark of the third quarter.
Kobe wasn't about to let the Lakers
lose. He took it upon himself to en
sure that his vision of victory would
not go unrealized that night. Bryant
just let loose on the Raptors, drain
ing contested shot after contested
shot, finishing the period with 27
points and a total of 53 with one
quarter still to play. By this point in
the game, the Lakers had taken the
lead, 91-85. It was a close-enough
game that I was sure Kobe would
have 60 by the end of the fourth pe
riod and might even beat his then
career high — set a few weeks ago
— of 62.
But Kobe had other plans. He

iced the game, making history all the
while. And as Chick Hearn, the late
legendary Lakers broadcaster
would have said, he made sure the
game was in the refrigerator, the
lights were out, the eggs were cool
ing, the butter was getting hard and
the Jello was assuredly jigglin'! And
when he drained his 18th free throw
of the game with 43 seconds remain
ing, Kobe tallied his 81st point of the
contest.
Just imagine the magnitude of
the scoring exhibition — these 81
points come in second in NBA histo
ry, trailing only Wilt Chaimberlain's
celebrated l(K)-point game. In his
magnificent performance. Wilt took
63 field goal attempts. By compari
son, Kobe took just 46 (not even a
career-high ... interpret this how you
may).
In fact, the astounding statistic
was that, up until that night, 99
squads this season had failed as an
entire team to match the scoring
output of Kobe's 81.Truly, the effort
was a sight to behold, and the ques
tions inevitably recurred: would
Kobe ever reach the ever-mythical
century mark? (It truly is mythical,
since there is no video footage of
Wilt's barrage of points.)
After all, several "experts" criti
cized Kobe in blogs and columns fol
lowing his three-quarter 62-point
showing in December. Iliey claimed
that he would never again have the
same chance to pursue history and
this was likely a feat that would not
