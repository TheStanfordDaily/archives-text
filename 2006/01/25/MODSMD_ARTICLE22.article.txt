# With Kobe, nothing is impossible
## 
### 
From week to week. I have at
tempted to make this column
the paragon of equal-opportu
nity coverage. While 1 generally
offer my opinions on a diverse num
ber of sports-related topics, recent
events of historical proportion have
forced me to come back to the topic
of Kobe Bryant.
By this point in the week, if you 1)
have been in the vicinity of any
sports fan, 2) flipped past ESPN
while trying to find something
worthwhile to watch at 2 a.m. any
time in the past three days or 3) are
even at least a casual fan of basket
ball, then you have undoubtedly
heard of Kobe's 81. For those of you
who have glanced through my last
few words, and still have no idea
what I'm talking about, "Kobe's 81"
is not a new band. But don't worry.
Just keep reading. You will be in
spired.

on Sunday night (and for that mat
ter, all over again on Monday too),
attempting to see just one more take
on Kobe's magnificent performance
Sunday night. I think I've finally ex
hausted them all, though the buzz
will no doubt inspire additional in
sights by writers across the nation
for some time to come.
In the mean time, here's one
more.
First, let me set the stage for those
who haven't heard. In the month of
January, up until Sunday night, Kobe
had been averaging an amazing 42
points per game, leading the Los An
geles Lakers' push for playoff con
tention (they're currently seventh in
the West). On Sunday night, Kobe
stepped on the court at the Staples
Center and prepared himself for just
another game against Toronto.
By halftime, he was holding a
Kobe-esque stat-line with 26 points
in 18 minutes, but the Lakers still
trailed the Raptors by 14 points, 49-
63.
'ITiat changed at about the nine
minute mark of the third quarter.
Kobe wasn't about to let the Lakers
lose. He took it upon himself to en
sure that his vision of victory would
not go unrealized that night. Bryant
just let loose on the Raptors, drain
ing contested shot after contested
shot, finishing the period with 27
points and a total of 53 with one
quarter still to play. By this point in
the game, the Lakers had taken the
lead, 91-85. It was a close-enough
game that I was sure Kobe would
have 60 by the end of the fourth pe
riod and might even beat his then
career high — set a few weeks ago
— of 62.
But Kobe had other plans. He
