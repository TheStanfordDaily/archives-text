## LELE FOROOD, head coach, speaking about the strength of her squad Women's tennis squad set to play host Cardinal enter Hawaii and Fresno State matchups with momentum after sweeping Las Vegas doubles and singles 
### 
After an impressive showing two weeks ago,
when the Cardinal women's tennis team lit up the
Las Vegas courts, Stanford now sets it sights on a
plaee not often seen in competition thus far this
season — home.
The last time the Cardinal women met a
challenge at the Taubc Tennis Center was
about three months ago, in the I PA Regionals
Oct. 21-24. Since then. Stanford has been on
the road in Arizona, Ohio, Hawaii, Southern
California and Las Vegas and, for the most
part, has been as successful as in past years.
Stanford sophomore Celia Durkin is coming
off her title-winning performance at the UNLV

Freeman Memorial Championship. She wasn't the
only one that left I.as Vegas with big winnings,
however. Stanford swept the Freeman Memorial
titles, as Alice Barnes and Anne Yelsey paired up
for their third doubles championship together.
Durkin defeated UCLA's Laura Gordon,6-2,6-0,
and the Cardinal tandem defeated Arizona State's
dllo. 9-7.
Hawaii comes to the Farm for the Rainbow
Wahine's second matchup against the Cardinal to
morrow. Stanford hosts Fresno State on Friday.
Two from women's volleyball squad named All
Americans
As a testament to the incredible individual per
formances that highlighted the women's volleyball
team's 2005 campaign, junior Kristen Richards and
freshman Foluke Akinradewo continued to garner
superlative postseason accolades this week.
Richards, who paced the Cardinal offense with
544 kills this year, was recently named a first

team All American by ASICS/Volleyball for her
play at outside hitter this season. It was the sec
ond first-team All-American nomination
Richards has received this year — she was also
named to the All-American first team by the
American Volleyball Coaches Association
(AVCA) in December.
With her senior season still to play,
Richards' 1,422 career kills already rank her ninth
on the Stanford all-time kills list. She also holds the
fifth-best Cardinal career digs total with 1,247 —
further evidence of her invaluable role on the
women's squad.
Akinradewo. earlier named the 2(X)5 Pacific-10
Conference Freshman of the Year for her dominant
play at middle blocker, was named a second-team
All American by ASICS/Volleyball. In her first
year on the Farm, Akinradewo finished third in the
Pac-10 and 10th in the nation with a .397 hitting
percentage. Additionally, the freshman contributed
a team-high 1.09 blocks per game in her impressive
rookie season.
