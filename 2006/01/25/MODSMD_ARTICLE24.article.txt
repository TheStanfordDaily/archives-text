# Duke defense frustrates, No. 1 Tennessee falls
## 
### GALEN VAISMAN THE CHRONICLE (DUKE 
(CSTV U-WIRE) DURHAM. N.C.
— Looking at the stat sheet before
Duke's game against No. 1 Tennessee, it
seemed like the Blue Devil defense was
going to have its hands full.
ilie Lady Vols entered the contest av
eraging 82.1 points per game, and the
team features two of the nation's most
dangerous scorers in Candace Parker and
Shanna Zolman.
Instead, No. 2 Duke's matchup zone
and intense on-the-ball pressure gave
Tennessee headaches all night. The Blue
Devils frequently took away the Lady
Vols best shot and held their opponent to
a season-low 53 points and forced them
into committing 22 turnovers.
"I'm really proud of our defense,"
Duke head coach Gail Goestenkors said.
"I thought we really set the tone on the
defensive end. I thought it was a great
team effort."
Duke's defensive pressure paid huge
dividends during a key stretch in the first
half, as the team was able to capitalize on
a flurry of Lady Vol turnovers to build a
lead the Blue Devils would not relinquish.
Starting with a Jessica Foley steal with
7:41 to go in the first half, the Blue Dev
ils managed to take away five balls and
grab two defensive rebounds, turning a
slim one-point lead into a seven-point
advantage.
The lackluster performance of the

Lady Vols starkly contrasted Duke's fiery
defensive effort. Tennessee allowed the
Blue Devils to run their offensive sets un
challenged all night.
The Lady Vols struggled to keep up
with the speed of Duke's hackcourt and
failed to contain any of the Blue Devils'
outside shooters. This allowed Abby
Waner and Jessica Foley to rain back
breaking threes on the Lady Vols when
they seemed poised to regain momentum
in the second half.
"There was quite a difference in how
their defense affected what we did offen
sively than our defense did against
Duke," Tennessee head coach Pat Sum
mitt said. "'lTiey pretty much ran what
they wanted to run, handled traps. We
didn't rotate our defense. But bottom
line, defensively, 1 just thought they dis
rupted us and we did not disrupt them. It
was a tough night for us, but they had an
awful lot to do with it."
Duke's defensive effort was spear
headed by the sensational play of Lindsey
I larding, who upset the tempo of the Ten
nessee offense all night.The junior relent
lessly hounded point guard Alexis Horn
buckle whenever she brought the ball up
the court, finishing with a career-high
eight steals.
"Lindsey was amazing," Goestenkors
said. "If there's a better defensive player
in the nation I'd like to see her. She did a
little bit of everything on the defensive
end and disrupted so many things they
wanted to do."

Hornbuckle recorded just three assists
on the night while committing a season
high six turnovers. Harding said she tried
to pressure the sophomore into dribbling
as much as possible with the hope that it
would cause her to lose control of the ball.
"We didn't handle the intensity that
they were throwing up," I lornbuekle said.
"We didn't match their energy. Our shots
weren't falling and our defense wasn't
there, and you can't win a big game like
this if you don't play defense."
I"he Blue Devils were especially effec
tive in shutting down Zolman, who en
tered the game averaging nearly 16 points
per game and finished with none. In addi
tion, the shooting guard was held without
an assist, rebound or steal, making her
two turnovers her only contribution of
the night.
"Shanna was a non-factor," Summitt
said. "And the disappointing thing is that
when she wasn't scoring,she wasn't doing
other things. That was a big disappoint
ment,and it obviously hurt us. She's got to
he more involved and do other things."
Chante Black and Mistie Williams also
came up big for the Blue Devils in the
paint, especially when starting center Ali
son Bales got into foul trouble in the first
half. The pair combined for 14 rebounds
and two blocked shots, and Black even
managed to pick up two steals.
"I was able to get good open looks and
just finish the play," Black said."Their post
players are good and aggressive, but I was
able to come in and be more mobile."
