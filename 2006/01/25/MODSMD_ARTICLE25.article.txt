## Steelers' Super Bowl choice bucks tradition 
### ALAN ROBINSON AP SPORTS WRITERS 
PITTSBURGH (AP) — To coach Bill
Cowher, the Pittsburgh Steelers simply look
right in white.
ITie Steelers will buck years of tradition and
wear their white away uniforms in the Super
Bowl against Seattle, even though they are des
ignated by the NFL as the home team and could
wear their more imposing black jersey tops.
Ilie black jerseys and gold pants are the
Steelers' traditional look, and numerous sports
teams have switched to black uniforms in recent
years because they believe it creates a more in
timidating presence.
Cowher made the choice by himself and
without consulting with ownership, saying,
"We're not playing at Heinz Field so, in my
mind, it's an away game."
Ilie Steelers' unprecedented success as a
road team no doubt factored into Cowher's de
cision to wear white for the fourth consecutive
game. The Steelers are the only sixth-seeded
team to reach the Super Bowl and the first to
knock off the No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 teams in a
conference to get there. They have won in suc
cessive weeks at Cincinnati. Indianapolis and
Denver.
The Steelers also will go against another tradi
tion by not flying to Detroit until Monday — nor
mally, teams travel to the Super Bowl site on the
Sunday before the game. With Pittsburgh located
so close to Detroit, Cowher said there was no rea
son to go any earlier since the first big Super
Bowl-related event is Tuesday's media day.
But it was Cowher's decision to wear white
that caused the biggest stir in a town where it's
difficult to drive past more than one or two
houses without seeing a black and gold Terrible
Towel or banner. Cowher became perplexed at
the constant questioning about the issue at his
weekly news conference, finally saying. "You
want to know what shoes I'm wearing, too?"
"I didn't think it was that big a deal what jer
sey color you're wearing," Cowher said. "Maybe
that's just me, okay? To me, if you're not playing

at Heinz Field it's an away game. I think anyone
can understand that rationale. If it's a sensitive
issue to people, I'm sorry."
Sensitive issue, maybe. But could it be super
stition?
"We've been playing well the last three
weeks on road, and this is another fourth game
on the road — I don't know if that's supersti
tious." he said.
Uniform issues aside. Cowher effectively re
vealed the Steelers' theme for the next two
weeks, and it's a familiar one — we ain't done
nothing yet. Despite the Steelers' three-for
three AFC road sweep, he said any Super Bowl
finalist's season is defined by what it does in this
game and not how it gets there.
"The deal isn't done yet," he said. "This is
going to be our toughest challenge. Seattle is
playing at an extremely high level, and we
haven't accomplished anything yet. That's the
thing to keep in mind.... it all can change in one
play, one quarter, one bad game."
Ilie Steelers know all about that, having lost
four AFC title games at home and a Super Bowl
in the last dozen seasons,gaining them a reputa
tion of being a team that can't stand up to the
challenge of big games. While this road run may
be altering that theory, Cowher understands it
will be stamped on his team again — especially
since the Steelers are favored against Seattle
after being underdogs the last two weeks.
"They're just as hungry as we are." Cowher
said. "It's a golden opportunity for us, but don't
underestimate the challenge that's in front of us.
... You realize how hard it is to get there, but don't
lose sight that the goal is to win a championship.
"Nobody remembers that you lost a Super
Bowl, they remember who won a Super Bowl,"
he added.
Cowher did reveal one other thought he had
after the Steelers ended a streak of three consec
utive losses in the AFC title game by beating
Denver 34-17 Sunday.
"Thank goodness I'm not going back to
Hawaii," he said.
ITie losing coach in each conference champi
onship game handles the Pro Bowl teams, so
Cowher has coached the AFC four times since
the 1994 season. Iliis is his second time in the
Super Bowl; the Steelers lost 27-17 to Dallas in
Januarv 1996 as a two-touchdown underdoe.
