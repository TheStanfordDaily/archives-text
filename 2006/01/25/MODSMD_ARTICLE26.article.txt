## Study shows college students lacking skills 50 percent of graduates lack basic literacy 
### JULIE KLEIN 
Will you he ready for the real world
after graduation? Stanford is known for
offering a top-notch education, and a col
lege degree will provide students with
many opportunities. But will they know
how to handle the basic tasks of balanc
ing a checkbook or calculating a restau
rant tip?
According to a recent study conduct
ed by CNN.com, a shocking 50 percent of
graduates from four-year colleges do not
have the literacy level needed to under
stand newspaper editorials. The percent
age goes up to 75 for graduates of two
year colleges.
These results were found through a lit
eracy study funded by the Pew Charita
ble Trusts. The test found that a student's
major does not affect his ability to handle
the three types of literacy — analyzing
news articles, understanding documents
and basic math skills.
The students were given the same test
used by the National Assessment of
Adult Literacy. Twenty percent of gradu
ating students only had basic quantitative
skills, meaning that they could not esti
mate if their car had enough gas to get to
a service station. Most students demon
strated intermediate skills; they were ca
pable of identifying a location on a map.
So, does Stanford prepare its students
more than the average college? S e -
nior Chris Hartfield says no. However,
while Hartfield, a double major in inter
national relations and psychology, does
n't think the University provides students
with these skills, he doesn't discount the
ability of his peers either. According to
Hartfield. "The average Stanford student
enrolls here with the ability to perform
standard math computations or to com
pare credit card offers with respect to
APR and yearly fees."
Other students were not as confident.

Sophomore Takeo Rivera said he knows
that if he doesn't make the effort, his ed
ucation won't prepare him for life.
"1 think that's a major concern," he
said. "From a purely functional stand
point, classes themselves don't provide
daily living skills."
However, while Rivera said that he
feels like he does not have these skills yet,
he does have a plan for the future.
"I know that for seniors, they offer
seminars [on basic skills]," he said. "And
you need to have these skills when you go
out into the world."
Sophomore Rachel Danford has a
similar plan.
"1 think 1 have the skills to balance a
checkbook, but not do my taxes or do
anything more than that," Danford said.
Like Rivera, she is eventually planning to
take an economics class and is also con
sidering an accounting class.
The need for certain practical class re
quirements seemed to be a common real
ization among students. Freshman Cary
Robbins, for example, plans on taking
Econ I:"lntroduction to Economics."
"It should be required," she said.
"These skills are really important, but
students aren't required to learn them."
The good news is that the average lit
eracy of college students is much higher
than that of less-educated adults, proving
that colleges do improve literacy abilities
to some extent.
However, Joni Finney, vice president
of the National Center for Public Policy
and Higher Education, is not satisfied.
"But do they do well enough fora
highly educated population?" she asked
in the CNN report. "Fora knowledge
based economy? The answer is no."
Luckily, most Stanford students —
such as freshman Diana Peng — are con
fident that they will develop the profi
ciency needed for life by the time that
they graduate.
"At Stanford, kids are really capable
and creative in thinking," Peng said. "I
know that they can handle these simple
life situations."
