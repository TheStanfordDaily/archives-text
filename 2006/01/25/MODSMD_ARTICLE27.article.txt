## High school aid policy worries students Program will reward academic rigor with aid 
### DENISE SOHN 
Just four years after the No Child Left Be
hind policy went into effect, the federal gov
ernment has unveiled a new education pro
gram that will "rate the academic rigor of the
nation's 18,000 high schools," according to a
recent New York Times article.This multibil
lion dollar initiative will offer grants ranging
from $750 to $1,300 to low-income students
who have completed a "rigorous" high
school course of study. It will he left up to the
Secretary of Education to determine how to
define "rigorous."
In any case, this new program has sparked
controversy and debate among students. Kiat
Chuan Tan, a freshman from Singapore,com
pared the new program to others around the
world.
"Federal money for education is always
good." he said. "In Europe, education is basi
cally free, so people have a chance to get
higher education without worrying about
family background."
He also described the Singaporean merit
based system of education, in which high
achieving students get significant help to pay
for college.
Senior Crissy Iglesias, a private high
school graduate, had a different take.
"I think the Bush philosophy on educa
tion is misguided," she said. "It consistently

takes money away from the schools and stu
dents that really need it."
She added that, if the program were to be
approved, it would be unfair to private
school students, who would be ineligible to
compete for the grants.
Freshman Allison Dedrick agreed.
"I think the program will backfire," she
said. "The people who end up in the lowest
achieving schools are in most need of federal
aid, as a general rule. It unfairly punishes the
students who cannot attend more highly
achieving public and private schools."
As a public high school graduate, Dedrick
added that it would also be difficult to accu
rately get a sense of any real high school ex
perience.
"Classes can be rigorous but not have of
ficially rigorous titles, and some classes that
are Advanced Placement might be really ter
rible," she said.
While the "rigorous" standards have yet
to be defined, some combinations of AP and
International Baccalaureate courses have
been proposed as a possible definition.
Sophomore Nellie Olsen had her own
take on the issue. While she admitted that "fi
nancially supporting students from low-in
come families is frequently a positive thing
and always sounds good," she had her own
concerns.
"Frequently government regulation does
n't have a box for "other," which results in
headache for people who choose non-tradi
tional methods of completing high school,"
she said. "I was home schooled for most of

schools and students
that really need it

high school, an experience that I value high
ly, and think 1 was well prepared for Stanford.
I think it would be a disservice to the country
if home schoolers, because they couldn't fit in
the boxes designed for another system, were
penalized in some way"
Olsen also said that her best teachers were
those more concerned with students than
tests and more enthusiastic about their sub
jects than rankings. With high schools hurry
ing to have their courses recognized as "rig
orous," Olsen predicted that education in
schools might actually suffer.
Despite this speculation and predictions
about the consequences of this new federal
aid program, students will not have to wait
long to learn the outcome. The measure is
expected to pass in the House next month
and will affect the financial aid system im
mediately.
