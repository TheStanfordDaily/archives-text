## Native American groups demand apology for shirts 
### DAISY CHUNG STAFF WRITER 
For many students, the Stanford Cardinal has always repre
sented the University on its playing fields, exemplifying the
spirit of the school within its ranks and to the community at
large. However, alumni who attended Stanford before 1972
might recall an entirely different mascot — the Stanford Indi
an.
With an increased sensitivity to the issues at stake in a multi
cultural community, the University officially replaced the Indi
an mascot after 55 students and staff members submitted a pe
tition asking that the symbol be removed.
In recent months, however, the Native American communi
ty at Stanford has noted a reemergence of the Stanford Indian
on various spirit and athletic paraphernalia.
"We were extremely disappointed by the recent reappear
ances of the Stanford Indian." said senior Jackson Brossy, co
chair of the Stanford American Indian Organization (SAIO).
One incident involved T-shirts advertised in the varsity sail
ing team's newsletter. Members of the sailing team and head
coach Jay Kehoe declined to comment.
"The T-shirts were printed by an alumnus before Big Game
— the individual intended to distribute them to other alums
and members of the sailing team," said Gary Migdol, assistant
athletic director.

He explained that the T-shirts featured an Indian sitting on
a bear.
"I believe there were 25 T-shirts printed, and five were left
over after Big Game," he said. "The alumnus suggested that the
team sell these shirts, and an ad was placed in the sailing team's
newsletter."

The Stanford Indian is making a comeback, inspired by such
vintage T-shirts as this, which was made before Stanford be
came the Cardinal.
noticed the shirts and brought
the issue up for consideration
within their organization.
"The sailing team plans to
print a letter in their next
newsletter apologizing for the
advertisement, which was inap
propriate," Migdol said.
In another sighting of the
Stanford Indian, the Sigma Chi
Fraternity designed Big Game
shirts that used the "Chief" logo
this past November.
"There has been a recent
resurgence of the Stanford

'Chief logo throughout the cam
pus and our use of it was meant
to invoke visions of tradition and
history (which was reinforced by
the phrase Killing Bears since
1892...' on the back of the T
shirt),not racism or intolerance,"
said senior Kunal Gullapalli,
president of the Alpha Omega
Chapter of Sigma Chi.
Representatives of the Native
American community, however,
took offense at these images.
These symbols, caricatures,
and crude sketches of American
Indians are to the Stanford com
munity, especially the Native
American community," Brossy
added. "Characterizing more
than S(H) individual nations as
wild-eyed, big-nosed, toma

hawk-chopping savages is racist
and cannot be tolerated by the
greater Stanford community."
Student groups who have res
urrected the Indian maintain
that they were merely referenc
ing the University's history.
"There was absolutely no in
tention of offending any group
with this shirt (with the possible
exception of the UC-Berkeley
Bears)," Gullapalli wrote in an e
mail to The Daily. "We still rec
ognize that, while our good in
tentions may be clear, any use of
images representing racial
stereotypes can negatively im
pact the consciousness of our
community. Thus, Sigma Chi
looks forward to proactively co
operating with the University

and campus groups to resolve
this unfortunate misunderstand
ing as well as working towards
preserving our open and respect
ful campus,"
Members of the Native Amer
ican community on campus are
also working toward a renewed
awareness of the issue within the
larger Stanford population.
"We plan to deliver a letter to
President Hennessy, the athletic
director and the University
[today], asking fora public de
nouncement of the use of the
mascot, and a reiteration of the
message that the use of the
American Indian mascot will not
be tolerated because it is de
meaning and offensive," Brossy
said.
