## Native American groups demand apology for shirts 
### DAISY CHUNG STAFF WRITER 
For many students, the Stanford Cardinal has always repre
sented the University on its playing fields, exemplifying the
spirit of the school within its ranks and to the community at
large. However, alumni who attended Stanford before 1972
might recall an entirely different mascot — the Stanford Indi
an.
With an increased sensitivity to the issues at stake in a multi
cultural community, the University officially replaced the Indi
an mascot after 55 students and staff members submitted a pe
tition asking that the symbol be removed.
In recent months, however, the Native American communi
ty at Stanford has noted a reemergence of the Stanford Indian
on various spirit and athletic paraphernalia.
"We were extremely disappointed by the recent reappear
ances of the Stanford Indian." said senior Jackson Brossy, co
chair of the Stanford American Indian Organization (SAIO).
One incident involved T-shirts advertised in the varsity sail
ing team's newsletter. Members of the sailing team and head
coach Jay Kehoe declined to comment.
"The T-shirts were printed by an alumnus before Big Game
— the individual intended to distribute them to other alums
and members of the sailing team," said Gary Migdol, assistant
athletic director.

He explained that the T-shirts featured an Indian sitting on
a bear.
"I believe there were 25 T-shirts printed, and five were left
over after Big Game," he said. "The alumnus suggested that the
team sell these shirts, and an ad was placed in the sailing team's
newsletter."

The Stanford Indian is making a comeback, inspired by such
vintage T-shirts as this, which was made before Stanford be
came the Cardinal.
