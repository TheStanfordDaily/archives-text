### CHRISTOPHER LIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Soon, your summer job feeding diced
frogs to the donkeys at a local ranch may
no longer be enough to pay for your ed
ucation.
On Feb. 1, the House of Representa
tives will vote on S. 1932, the Conference

Report on Budget Reconciliation. The
bill cuts $12.7 billion dollars from student
loan programs, and according to the Na
tional Association of Student Financial
Aid Administrators (NASFAA), is the
largest reduction in student assistance
ever. If the bill is passed, government
loans would also shift from a variable in
terest rate to a fixed interest rate of about
7 percent. Although the bill was already
passed by both the House and the Senate
in December, Senators opposing the bill
invoked a parliamentary procedure that
required a second House vote.
The NASFAA urges people to write

to their representatives opposing the bill
and has said that the money taken from
student loan programs "is over one
quarter of the savings in the entire Rec
onciliation bi11... a very large percentage
of the total cuts or increases in fees will
be paid by students. At a minimum, their
loan burdens will grow. At worst, their
educational opportunities will be severe
ly constrained. Instead of using the sav
ings for improved student aid benefits,
the bill directs the savings to be used for
federal deficit reduction."
