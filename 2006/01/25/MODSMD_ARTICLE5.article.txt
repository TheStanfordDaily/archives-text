## Bill could cut student loan money Feb. bill could cut $12.7 billion dollars from student loan programs 
### CHRISTOPHER LIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Soon, your summer job feeding diced
frogs to the donkeys at a local ranch may
no longer be enough to pay for your ed
ucation.
On Feb. 1, the House of Representa
tives will vote on S. 1932, the Conference

Report on Budget Reconciliation. The
bill cuts $12.7 billion dollars from student
loan programs, and according to the Na
tional Association of Student Financial
Aid Administrators (NASFAA), is the
largest reduction in student assistance
ever. If the bill is passed, government
loans would also shift from a variable in
terest rate to a fixed interest rate of about
7 percent. Although the bill was already
passed by both the House and the Senate
in December, Senators opposing the bill
invoked a parliamentary procedure that
required a second House vote.
The NASFAA urges people to write

to their representatives opposing the bill
and has said that the money taken from
student loan programs "is over one
quarter of the savings in the entire Rec
onciliation bi11... a very large percentage
of the total cuts or increases in fees will
be paid by students. At a minimum, their
loan burdens will grow. At worst, their
educational opportunities will be severe
ly constrained. Instead of using the sav
ings for improved student aid benefits,
the bill directs the savings to be used for
federal deficit reduction."
I More students rely on scholarships

Sophomore Antardeb Guharay
said he was disheartened by the bill.
"With college tuitions rising so
rapidly, expenses are getting out of
hand," he said. "It's time the federal
government started increasing finan
cial aid, not decreasing it."
This latest cut is part of a steady
decrease in government financial aid
over the last several years. Mary
Morrison, director of funds manage
ment in the Financial Aid Office,
said, "Every year, the government
gives out proportionally fewer grants
and more loans. There has been a
long constant trend of the percent
age of loans increasing. Obviously, it
is cheaper to give out loans because
the government gets at least some of
the money back."
However, the budget reconcilia
tion bill may also have some benefits
for students.
"The bill is not designed to take
away funds from students," said
Karen Cooper, director of financial
aid. "Most of the cuts are from back
end enticements for people to con
tribute to government funds for
loans, and the bill will actually ex
pand the money available for first
vear students. The bill will also ex

pand the parent loan program avail
able to graduate students, so we can
focus on federal programs instead of
private loans."
Cooper also noted that although
the new fixed interest rate of 7 per
cent is higher than the current vari
able rate of 5.3 percent, "the rate
jumped two percent last year, so the
variable rate was heading in the
same direction as the fixed interest
rate anyway."
The bill will have a particularly
large impact because many students
rely on government loans for finan
cial assistance.
"Students prefer subsidized loans
from the U.S. Department of Educa
tion because they don't have to pay
interest or make payments while still
in school," Morrison explained. "In
general, government loans have
lower interest rates than commercial
loans. Governments have more capi
tal than any bank, and give money
out of political motives, while banks
are there to be competitive and
make money."
Freshman Cathy Ye is one student
who may be affected by the changes
in government loan programs.
"I have both a Stafford loan from

the government and a commercial
loan from Citibank," she said."Right
now, the Stafford loan's interest rate
is 2 percent lower than Citibank's."
Students use a variety of sources
to scrounge up the sizable amount of
money necessary to attend Stanford.
Undergraduate tuition is $31,200
each year, and the Financial Aid Of
fice estimates that total annual costs,
including room, board and personal
fees, totals $44,667 each year.
Freshman Jennifer Evans said
that she preferred applying fora va
riety of private scholarships instead
of loan programs.
"1 feel that if it's worth a few hours
writing out an application if it can give
me the same amount of money 1
would get from working at a job all
summer," she said. "I once spent one
hour filling out an application, and got
$2,000 in scholarship money."
No matter what, though. Cooper
assured students that Stanford re
mains committed to fulfilling stu
dents' financial needs.
"Because we are a need-based
program, the University has made a
contract to meet every student's
need, even if big changes happen,"
she said.
