# PART FOUR OF A SERIES ON LABOR
## The 						Pension Problem DESPITE PROGRESS, UNION COULD STILL CHOOSE TO STRIKE 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
While some progress has been
made in talks between the Universi
ty and the union representing its
service employees,a strike could still
be called any time by the workers'
negotiating team. A representative
from the Service Employees Inter
national Union Local 715 (SEIU)
told The Daily that both sides remain
in a continuous dialogue but added
that the parties are still far apart.
"Pensions are the driving issue in
the negotiations," said SF.IU
spokesman John Vellardita."We are
looking fora benefit level that some
body can live on when they retire."
Across the country in all sectors,
pensions are playing an increasingly
central role in labor negotiations.
The ongoing labor dispute at Stan
ford has drawn attention to its paral

lels with a changing national climate
for organized labor.The Daily has re
ported on the impact of a changing
economy, an increasingly unfriendly
regulatory environment and the role
of health care benefits labor negotia

ines pensions.
Around the Country
in virtually all the major negoti
ations through the country, both
health care and the availability and
access to pensions are critical
points," said Law Prof. William
Gould, the former chairman of the
National Labor Relations Board
under President Bill Clinton.
On the pension front, every in
dustry seems to be affected. High
pension costs are crushing tradition-
I Union, Stanford disagree on pensions

al companies like airlines and auto
mobile manufacturers.
On Sunday, Sprint Nextel an
nounced they would freeze their de
fined pension plan for 39.000 employ
ees and move to 401(k) plans. Early
this month. International Business
Machines (IBM) announced similar
plans. The transit strike in New York
City that cost the economy hundreds
of millions of dollars in December
was almost entirely a result of a dis
agreement about how much employ
ees should contribute toward pen
sions.
The automobile industry faces
particular challenges due to legacy 1
costs from decades past for its work
ers. The United Auto Workers recent
ly agreed to negotiate with General
Motors about pension coverage even
though they were not obliged to. The
union recognized that the company's
imperiled competitiveness could im
pact their ability to deliver benefits in
the long term, Gould said.
"The high cost of maintaining
and funding pensions affects a num
ber of companies who have gone
bankrupt or threatened bankrupt
cy," he said. "Some major companies
have even discontinued their pen
sion plans."
George Washington University
Law Prof. Charles Craver said in an
interview with The Daily that since
the defined pension plans have been
historically very generous, "compa
nies did not want to fund pensions,
and many have jettisoned pension lia
bility."
In a 401 (k) plan, the employer
only has to contribute if the employee
decides to put money aside from their
salary fora retirement plan. Fewer
employees take advantage of these
plans, so employers save billions in
contributions.
"There has been a decline in the
willingness of employers to increase
benefits," said Stanford alumnus and
University of Utah Economics Prof.
Peter Philips, who complained that
the increasingly common 401 (k)
plans offer no guarantees in retire
ment.
The Crisis
"If we don't do something about
pensions and health care, it will be
come a crisis," Craver said. "If pen

sions disappear, there are a lot of peo
ple who would be in dire straits."
Many companies have under
funded pension plans that pay retiree
benefits. Some experts worry that this
will cause a major economic calamity
As baby boomers retire and live
longer, they begin to collect more
benefits than ever before. These fac
tors put a massive strain on the retire
ment system and the economy.
"The federal system to ensure
pensions are funded is wholly inade
quate," Philips said.
As a result of poor federal over
sight. most pensions are under fund
ed.
"At present, the under funding of
defined-benefit pension plans is a
pervasive and sizable phenomenon."
the Congressional Budget Office
found in a June 20()5 report."! Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation] esti
mates that the vast majority of plans
are currently under funded to some
degree. The agency's best estimate of
total under funding (on a termination
basis) among all insured plans is $600
billion."
The struggle over pensions prima
rily effects organized labor since only
one in seven non-union workers re
ceives a defined benefit pension plan
from their employers, according to
the Labor Research Association.
"The reason benefits are a major
issue with respect to pensions is be
cause collective bargaining is the
main vehicle through which workers
can be assured they know what they
are going to get when they retire,"
Philips said.
At Stanford
At a time when employers almost
everywhere are making cuts in pen
sions or reneging on commitments
made decades ago. University work
ers say they want an increase in their
guaranteed defined pensions.
The SEIU says that the defined
benefit plan as it is now does not meet
the needs of University employees
when they retire. Stanford has offered
to increase the total pension benefit,
but the union has called their offer in
adequate. The University says it is
committed to offering fair and com
petitive pension benefits.
"The University workers feel like
thev have lagged behind," Craver

said."The workers hope that the costs
won't go up. It's not a wage problem.
It's about fringe benefits."
The union members complain that
a high cost-of-living and an antiquat
ed funding formula put workers at a
disadvantage.
"It is a formula that is based on
1992 economics in 2(X)6," Vellardita
said. "Workers have significantly less
buying power with that than they did
14 years ago. We have a retirement
plan, but will we be able to retire on
that retirement plan?"
Executive Director of Human Re
sources Diane Peck defended the
University's compensation in an e
mail to faculty and staff members two
weeks ago.
"The University's position on pen
sion plans: moving forward, not back
ward," she wrote. "The union has
asked the University to expand the
defined benefit pension plan SRAP
(Stanford Retirement Annuity Plan)
that remains in force fora minority of
current bargaining unit employees. In
response we have proposed to in
crease the base earnings year for
SRAP to 1994 (from 1992) which will
increase the benefit."
Most University employees are in
Stanford's Contributory' Retirement
Plan (SCRP), the kind of plan more
employers other places are moving
toward.
"In fact, several notable compa
nies have not been able to keep the
retirement promises they made to
their employees," Peck said in her e
mail.
In this plan, employees put aside
money in a pension that is matched by
the school. The University con
tributes up to 10 percent of the em
ployee's salary into the plan on the
employee's behalf, they say.There is a
5 percent basic contribution and up to
an additional 5 percent in matching
contributions.
"In other words, for each dollar
the employee saves, Stanford con
tributes two," she wrote. "That contri
bution is higher than contributions by
most other universities and private
employers as well."
"We have not proposed reducing
the benefits that our defined benefits
plan provides," she added. "However,
the future is in defined contribution
plans, and the Stanford plan SCRP,

which covers the majority of Univer
sity employees, is where our focus will
remain."
Spending from Endowments
Union sympathizers argue that
Stanford is different than regular pri
vate business employers because they
say the school can afford to perma
nently pay more generous benefits
due to the large endowment fund.The
size of the endowment has been con
tinually mentioned by both union or
ganizers and student supporters at
the Stanford Labor Action Coalition.
"(These pension guarantees] do
costa lot of money" Vellardita ad
mits. "However, the University is not
poor. They have consistently had a
significant return on their endow
ment. This is one of the wealthiest in
stitutions in the country. They had
tens of millions of dollars in surplus
revenue this year.
"We're just asking that our work
ers be able to live when they retire,"
he said.
Stanford's endowment fund grew
23 percent to $12.21 billion in the fis
cal year ended Aug. 31, The Wall
Street Journal reported Monday. The
endowment is the third largest in the
countrv. behind only Harvard and
Yale.
Most observers dismiss the argu
ment that increased pensions can
come from the endowment fund.
They say that the University is faced
with the same competitive pressures
that other private sector companies
face.
"The universities are in dire
straits," complained Craver. "TUition
is going up so they feel tremendous
pressure to keep the unions out. As
much as $12 billion seems like a lot.it
costs a huge amount to operate a uni
versity like Stanford."
When the University makes con
cessions to unions, it needs to find
somewhere to pay for it. It may cut fi
nancial aid for students, funding for
professors or defer maintenance.
Universities give up future income if
they tap into their endowment funds,
said Economics Prof. John Pencaval.
"The issue is what will be cut fora
pay raise," he said. "Stanford workers
are already paid pretty well by com
parison to other workers in the Bay
Area."
