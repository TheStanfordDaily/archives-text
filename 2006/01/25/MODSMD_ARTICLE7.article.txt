# STUDENT GROUPS
## Fund caps irk groups 
### NICK PARKER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When the ASSU announced earlier this
month that it would institute several restrictions
on student group funding in an effort to prevent
massive overspending by undergraduate groups,
such as the $158,784.98 overdraft that occurred
last year, the response was mixed.
Hie new policy affects only groups that re
ceive general lees, which tend to have relatively
small numbers of members. Larger groups that
get their money from special fees — such as the
Asian American Student Association (AASA)
and the Muslim Student Awareness Network
(MSAN) are unaffected by the new ASSU
funding policies.
ITie major change in the new system is the in

stitution of a "soft cap," which states that no gen
eral fees group can receive more than $40 per
Stanford undergraduate participating in the or
ganization. This new "soft cap" is in addition to an
existing "hard cap" of an absolute maximum of
$6.(HM) per group (community service groups
have a "hard cap" of $8,(HK)).
Therefore, unless a group has 150 or more
members — and most groups approaching that
size are governed by the special fees system and
are thus unaffected by the new policies — it can
not receive the full $6,000 maximum allotted to it
under the Senate's by-laws.
Leaders of various student groups affected by
the new policy have responded with opposition to
this new "soft cap."
Olivia Sohns, a senior, who is the
co-president of the Coalition for Jus
tice in the Middle East (CJME).said
she felt that all student groups are
underappreciated by the University.
"I believe it is scandalous how
hard it is for student groups to fund
their activities at Stanford," she said.
"Every year new construction proj
ects are initiated around campus, but
every year the real infrastructure of
student life at Stanford — student
groups that enrich undergraduate
education with talks, performances
and other programming — goes
overlooked by the University."
Sohns added that she felt that the
new policy unfairly targets small
groups such as CJME. which brings
speakers to campus every year to
discuss issues pertaining to human
rights, justice and U.S. foreign policy
in the Middle East.
"This year, it has gotten even
harder [to get funding] because the
ASSU, our main source of funds, has
now installed a funding policy that
discriminates against small groups
like ours, making funding propor
tional to the number of 'active'
members a group has," she said.
Sohns said she believes that the
new policy's discrimination against
small groups is unwarranted due to
the major benefits that small groups
can bring to campus.
"This policy is unfair to small
groups like CJME because it fails to
take into consideration that small
groups can contribute greatly to

campus life in spite of their size," she
said. "CJME. for example, organizes
more events than even large groups
on campus because we are fortunate
to have a remarkably dedicated core
of officers who care very much about
promoting awareness and dialogue
on campus about issues relating to
the Middle East."
Even the leaders of the larger
groups that operate on the special
fees system and are thus unaffected
by the new policy agree that the "soft
cap" seems unfair.
"I think the new policy is an at
tack on student groups and student
programming," said Linda Iran, a
senior and co-president of AASA.
The ASSU. meanwhile, has a dif
ferent take on its new funding poli
cies. ASSU Senate Chair Chris
Nguyen, a junior, told The Daily that
many student groups have respond
ed well to the new policy.
"Student groups have been very
understanding about the situation."
he said. "Many groups have asked us
to help them find other sources of
funding. We have worked to lower
costs for student groups in many dif
ferent ways, including securing a
contract with CopyAmerica for
cheap printing and working with
Stanford Dining on the Cardinal To
Go program's low-cost food items."
Nguyen also encouraged student
groups to contact the ASSU with any
problems or concerns they might
have with funding and reinforced his
claim that most groups have been re
ceptive to the new policies.
"Groups have been very cooper
ative." he said. "We appreciate their
understanding and urge them to
contact us with any concerns they
have."
