# STUDENT GROUPS
## Fund caps irk groups 
### NICK PARKER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When the ASSU announced earlier this
month that it would institute several restrictions
on student group funding in an effort to prevent
massive overspending by undergraduate groups,
such as the $158,784.98 overdraft that occurred
last year, the response was mixed.
Hie new policy affects only groups that re
ceive general lees, which tend to have relatively
small numbers of members. Larger groups that
get their money from special fees — such as the
Asian American Student Association (AASA)
and the Muslim Student Awareness Network
(MSAN) are unaffected by the new ASSU
funding policies.
ITie major change in the new system is the in

stitution of a "soft cap," which states that no gen
eral fees group can receive more than $40 per
Stanford undergraduate participating in the or
ganization. This new "soft cap" is in addition to an
existing "hard cap" of an absolute maximum of
$6.(HM) per group (community service groups
have a "hard cap" of $8,(HK)).
Therefore, unless a group has 150 or more
members — and most groups approaching that
size are governed by the special fees system and
are thus unaffected by the new policies — it can
not receive the full $6,000 maximum allotted to it
under the Senate's by-laws.
Leaders of various student groups affected by
the new policy have responded with opposition to
this new "soft cap."
