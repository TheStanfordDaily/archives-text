Cabinet's efforts to live up to its
motto of "execute" with plans to en
courage student groups to work to
gether.
"Last quarter we had a Volun
teer Student Organizations leader
summit meeting where we invited
student leaders and talked about
the importance of collaborating
and about funding collaborative
projects." Kannokada said. "[The]
ASSU Executive Cabinet has set
aside funds, and Vice Provost Greg
Boardman has agreed to match
them.
"Financial managers will apply
to the [SSE Capital Group) and this
should encourage collaboration
which will increase visibility and
turnout for groups, and also allevi
ate the budget issues from the Sen
ate's soft cap." Kannokada added.
She also described plans fora
concert to benefit Hurricane Katri
na victims, which is scheduled for
spring quarter.
Administration and Rules
Chair Kai Lukoff, a sophomore,
explained his committees' dia
logues to amend the ASSU Consti
tution in order to provide the Sen

ate with more flexibility.
"We've been convening joint
meetings between [the Graduate
Student Council] and members of
the Senate, conducting a constitu
tional review to see what works and
what doesn't." Lukoff said. "We
want to move items from the Con
stitution — which are too meticu
lous and require a two-thirds vote
by the GSC, the Senate and the vot
ers to amend — into the Senate's
By-Laws which the Senate can
amend itself.
"We're also discussing ideas in
cluding creating an Attorney Gen
eral position which would be re
sponsible for interpreting leaner
rules, and these changes would be
up for consideration in the spring
election." Lukoff said.
Communications Chair Rong
Xu. a junior, then detailed plans for
the Senate's quarterly "office
hours." during which the Senate
members hear complaints and com
ments in order to address student
concerns.
"Last quarter we held them in
White Plaza, we had Jamba Juice
for students and we received com
plaints about Stanford Dining and
about Graduation." Xu said. "We
collect complaints and suggestions
to follow up with students and this
year's office hours are tentatively
scheduled for Valentine's Dav. This

year it will be on Escondido Road;
there should be candy and choco
late and we might have a raffle."
The Senate then received an up
date on efforts for investment dis
closure from Chair of the Campus
Advocacy Committee Andrew
Hendel, a senior.
"Last Thursday we met with two
members of the Stanford Coalition
for Investment Disclosure who
want us to take on this issue," Hen
del said. "SC1D wants to create a
forum between University officials,
members of the Stanford Manage
ment Company (SMC) and stu
dents to discuss investment. They
want disclosure of public invest
ments and they want to reform
proxy voting to make it more trans
parent.
"SCID also wants paid student
researchers on committees and
more regular meetings of the Advi
sory Panel on Investment Respon
sibility, although we are waiting to
get in touch with representatives
for SMC or the Board of Trustees
before taking a stance," Hendel ex
plained.
The Senate confirmed co-termi
nal student Brendan Marten as
publications director and junior Al
ison Ayer as assistant publications
director.
According to sophomore Danny
Arbeiter. deputy chair of the Sen

ate, Marten and Ayer will serve as
advocates for student publications.
"Their responsibility is to fund
student publications and work on
their behalf by maintaining the
Storke Publication Building, help
ing new groups start up, working on
door to door distribution and in
creasing publicity," Arbeiter said.
"Brendan has four and a half years
of experience with the Daily and
he's the most knowledgeable per
son about publication in Stanford."
Arbeiter also supported Ayer's
confirmation and looked forward
to their efforts and said, "Alison
has experience in the real world of
publications. They should be con
tacting publications and soliciting
nominations for the publications
board to help represent publica
tions at Stanford."
Finally, the Senate approved
funding bills for such groups as the
Caribbean Students Association,
the Jewish Students Association,
Satrang, Fellowship in Christ at
Stanford, Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers, Phi Kappa
Psi Fraternity, Kuumba African
Dance and Drum Ensemble, Niger
ian Students Organization. Stan
ford Black Pre-Law Society and the
