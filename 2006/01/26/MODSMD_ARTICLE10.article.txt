# SPECIAL EVENT
## Texas prof condemns porn Industry is taking content too far, speaker argued 
### SEAN BRUICH 
With many college students flush with
hormones and away from their parents for
the first time, perhaps it's no wonder that
sex and pornography are frequent topics of
conversation on university campuses. But
only rarely are these issues approached
from an academic perspective, leading the
Stanford Women's Community Center to
host what they hoped would be an intellec
tual discussion about pornography on
Wednesday night.
Invited speaker Robert Jensen, a jour
nalism professor at the University of Texas,
presented a fairly biting criticism of the
medium, warning that the content of
pornography is "increasingly cruel, degrad
ing and hostile to women."
But both Jensen and student organizers
emphasized that the event sought to move
the discussion away from more traditional
debates on the morality of pornography to
more intellectual discourse.
"It's important for people to understand
that the feminist critique of pornography is
distinct from the conservative or religious
objections," Jensen said. "I'm not a right
winger, nor am I a religious fanatic."
Instead, Jensen said, his objections to
pornography stem from"a feminist cri
tique" that focuses on pornography's impact
on women and children.
"It's a perspective that in the course of
the last 15 years or so. has increasingly been
pushed to the margins," he said, adding that

pornography is becoming more mainstream.
"Today it is everywhere," he said. "What
was once considered on the margins is itow
central in the culture. It's not unusual for
people to talk openly about using porn, but
that was not the case when 1 was in college."
Jensen characterized the pornography

industry as extremely profitable and said
that in 2005 alone, the industry produced
some 13.000 videos and netted an estimat
ed $12 billion in total revenues — all from
an audience that consists primarily of
men.
Jensen went on to describe the produc
tion, content and effects of pornography —

often in very frank and sometimes graphic
language.
"The charge of pornography is the sexual
ization of male dominance and female subor
dination, and that's the appeal to men,"
Jensen claimed. He then detailed recent
