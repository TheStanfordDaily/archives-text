# SPECIAL EVENT
## Texas prof condemns porn Industry is taking content too far, speaker argued 
### SEAN BRUICH 
With many college students flush with
hormones and away from their parents for
the first time, perhaps it's no wonder that
sex and pornography are frequent topics of
conversation on university campuses. But
only rarely are these issues approached
from an academic perspective, leading the
Stanford Women's Community Center to
host what they hoped would be an intellec
tual discussion about pornography on
Wednesday night.
Invited speaker Robert Jensen, a jour
nalism professor at the University of Texas,
presented a fairly biting criticism of the
medium, warning that the content of
pornography is "increasingly cruel, degrad
ing and hostile to women."
But both Jensen and student organizers
emphasized that the event sought to move
the discussion away from more traditional
debates on the morality of pornography to
more intellectual discourse.
"It's important for people to understand
that the feminist critique of pornography is
distinct from the conservative or religious
objections," Jensen said. "I'm not a right
winger, nor am I a religious fanatic."
Instead, Jensen said, his objections to
pornography stem from"a feminist cri
tique" that focuses on pornography's impact
on women and children.
"It's a perspective that in the course of
the last 15 years or so. has increasingly been
pushed to the margins," he said, adding that

pornography is becoming more mainstream.
"Today it is everywhere," he said. "What
was once considered on the margins is itow
central in the culture. It's not unusual for
people to talk openly about using porn, but
that was not the case when 1 was in college."
Jensen characterized the pornography

industry as extremely profitable and said
that in 2005 alone, the industry produced
some 13.000 videos and netted an estimat
ed $12 billion in total revenues — all from
an audience that consists primarily of
men.
Jensen went on to describe the produc
tion, content and effects of pornography —

often in very frank and sometimes graphic
language.
"The charge of pornography is the sexual
ization of male dominance and female subor
dination, and that's the appeal to men,"
Jensen claimed. He then detailed recent

trends in pornography tending toward more
hostile acts,such as violent oral sex and simul
taneous penetration by multiple partners.
"It's aggressive, but it's designed to be
that way," he said.
Whiie Jensen rejected the often-carica
tured feminist position that "porn causes
rape," he said he believes it to be "non-con
troversial" that pornography can strongly
influence the thoughts and behaviors of
those who view it.
"Cruelty and degradation becomes
largely invisible to those who watch it,"he
said. "[Porn] industry people don't recog
nize that it's the sexualization of dDmina
tion and subordination. In fact, most men
who use it don't recognize it."
"I think porn also contributes to the
shaping of a view of men, women and sexu
ality that is rooted in a domination-subordi
nation dynamic; that the role of men is to

naturally dominate and for women to natu
rally submit," he said.
Relying primarily on case studies of sex
ual offenders, Jensen also argued that for
some men. repeated use of porn can blur
the line between reality and fantasy.
The 70-person audience, which was ap
proximately one-third men. was largely
supportive of Jensen's message.
Freshman Grace Davis, who admitted to
being the "dorm feminist," believed Jensen
addressed the issues "very fairly and very
thoughtfully."
Others said they were inspired to take
action.
"I want to crusade against porn now,"
said senior Alii Dencker. "I'm calling my
boyfriend right now and telling him not to
look at any more porn."
Some, however, had more mixed feel
ings. A female junior, who declined to give

her name, said that despite the talk, she has
"no clear stand on the issue" but expected
to "reflect on it a lot tonight."
A senior male, on the other hand, ques
tioned some of Jensen's methods and sug
gested that it is not such a black-and-white
issue.
"Much of what he said was legitimate,
but he was unwilling to draw any distinc
tions between porn that is harmful and porn
that might be more acceptable," he said.
"He seemed interested in pulling out the
most alarming examples rather than deal
ing with it more realistically."
The senior, who also declined to be
named, suggested that a more pragmatic
approach would be necessary to address the
reality of pornography in society.
"Porn's here to stay," he said. "We need
to figure out how to deal with it rather than
condemning it wholesale."
