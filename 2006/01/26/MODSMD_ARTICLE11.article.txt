## Study finds marketing affects product performance Researchers claim "you get what you pay for" 
### BEN EPPLER 
The results of an experiment conducted
by a Stanford professor and published in
the Journal of Marketing Research could
have a significant impact on current percep
tions of how marketing and pricing affect
the efficacy of products.
In a study entitled "Placebo Effects of

Marketing Actions: Consumers May Get
What They Pay For." Graduate School of
Business Marketing Prof. Baba Shiv con
cluded that that "consumers who pay a dis
counted price fora product... may derive
less actual benefit from consuming this
product...than consumers who pay its regu
lar price."
Shiv conducted the study during 2004
and 2005 in cooperation with Ziv Carmon,
associate professor of business at the Euro
pean Institute of Business Administration
(INSEAD), a prestigious business school

with campuses in Singapore and
Fontainebleau in France, and Dan Ariely, a
professor of management science at Massa
chusetts Institute ofTechnology.
Previous experiments had already
demonstrated that marketing and product
presentation have a significant effect on
consumer perceptions of such subjective
qualities as taste. For example, previous
studies found that meat packaged as "75
percent fat free" tasted better than the
same meat labeled "25 percent fat" and
beer that had a favorite-brand label was

found to taste better than the same beer in
a generic bottle.
The new study, published in November
of last year, sought to provide an answer to
the question of whether "the beliefs and ex
pectations that marketing actions evoke...
can also influence the actual efficacy of the
marketed product?"
In three experiments, Shiv, Carmon and
Ariely tested over 400 students and found
that those who had paid full price for Sobe
Adrenaline Rush were able to solve more word
jumble puzzles than students who paid a re
duced price. The potential ramifications of these
findings may be widespread, the researchers
found.
For example, the study suggested that if the
effectiveness of over-the-counter medicines
could similarly be linked to price, both health
policy and the marketing of these drugs could
be affected. Shiv, Carmon and Ariely reported
that a small-scale study of 29 students over the
course of a semester found that those who pur
chased national-brand cold medicine at full
price rated it more effective than those who
purchased the same type of medicine at a dis
count.
Shiv had this potential link in mind as he
planned the experiment.
"[My pursuit of this experiment] began with
my purchasing a medication on sale for my son,
my son not feeling better, and my wife complain
ing that I should not have purchased the medica

tion on sale," he wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
Some found the study's findings — that un
conscious beliefs about price could alter the ef
ficacy of products — alarming.
"That's surprising," said sophomore Eric
Frenkiel, who expressed willingness to pay more
for medicines if he knew they would perform
better than a similar national brand on sale. "But
then again, I'd probably go with the more expen
sive one... people are willing to spend a lot for
the perceived effect."
Other students said they were not so willing
to abandon sale products.
"I don't intend to stop buying products on
sale "said freshman Danny Berring."First,price
is not always the best indicator of effectiveness.
Second, because oftentimes I don't need the
best performer. Like a T-shirt. I don't buy Gucci
T-shirts, because my $<S cotton T-shirt will do just
as good a job."
According to Shiv, the effect of unconscious
perceptions on pricing can be neutralized, "by
drawing people's attention to their broad price
quality beliefs to make them realize that these
beliefs may not apply all the time." However, the
advertising blitz that defines American society
can make this possible change a difficult one to
make.
