## Doctor shares the secrets of achievement Talk given as part of South Asian Awareness Week 
### BARRETT W. SHERIDAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
South Asian Awareness Week continued last
night with a tale of economic advancement from
Anmol Mahal, current president of the California
Medical Association.
The theme of South Asian Awareness Week
this year is "South Asian Success Stories," and
Mahal opened his speech with a pontification on
the meaning of success.
"Success comes to all of us in different propor
tions." he said."lt depends on what you recognize
as success. It's a funny thing — when you're
young, success means a lot of different things to
different people. When you get to my age the per
ception of what is success changes a little bit."
The pursuit of success was a constant motiva
tor for Mahal. The son of a psychiatry professor,
he grew up amid humble surroundings in New
Delhi. He remembers his mother pointing out the
rickshaw drivers that transported his family
around town, warning that only studying would
allow him to escape their fate.
"We were driven to education as an economic
necessity to get to the next level," he said.
He worked hard enough to graduate from an
Indian medical school at age 23 and secured him
self an intern slot at a New Jersey medical school.
The culture shock, he said, was a challenge.
"They allow you to bring two suitcases [into
the country]," he said. "I only could bring one
book. You put your whole life in two suitcases,get
on a plane, and you land in a strange place. Every
thing is moving around a lot faster — certainly
the cars are moving a lot faster. Everything is a lot
bigger, and everything is a lot faster. Even the
human beings are a lot bigger than you. It's a
unique experience, and pretty soon the few dol
lars you brought with you. you run out of."
The Watergate scandal rolled on as Mahal con
tinued his studies in New Jersey, and he and the
other interns found themselves sneaking peeks at
hospital televisions to catch the hearings on their
breaks. During one particularly tense hearing, he
found himself starting a sentence by
saying, "We Americans ought t0..."
No one looked at him strangely for
his declaration.
"This is one incredible society
that accepts everyone," he said.
Now after decades in the country,
he spoke with authority on the expe
rience of being an immigrant.
"It's a fulfilling experience, and
it's a tensing experience," he said.
"Simply, it's not one of the easiest
things to do, because there are so
many things to learn. One of the
things I have most trouble with is
local humor."
Yet Mahal's own sense of humor
was in full swing last night. After
mentioning a free health clinic he is
helping to organize at an Indian
Community Center in Milpitas, he
cracked, "Milpitas — sounds like a
pediatric disease when you say it."
Mahal is organizing the Milpitas
project in his current capacity as
president of the California Medical
Association, an organization for
which he long served as an advocate
for minority and immigrant doctors.
When elections rolled around.
Mahal's work put him at the top of
the candidates' field.
"Being a minority can be a disad
vantage, but in this case, being a mi
nority was an advantage," he said.
"They wanted a minority to be pres
ident."
Mahal ended his prepared
speech with a list of his reasons for
being optimistic about beginning a
career in medicine, which included
the aging baby boomer population
and breakthroughs in human
genome studies.
