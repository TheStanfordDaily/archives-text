## The
						Voice Behind Our Bodies Ourselves 
### DEBORAH SOHN 
Even technological snafus could not dampen the
crowds enthusiasm at author Judy Norsigian's lecture
last Thursday titled "Women and Health in Todav's
World."
Norsigian co-authored the book "Our Bodies, Our
selves" in 1970 with women from the Boston Women's
Health Book Collective — a group that 12 women started in
the late I%o's to educate themselves and others about
women's health. Since then, eight editions of "Our Bodies,
Ourselves" have been released. It is sold in many languages
and with various cultural nuances so that it cnn benefit
women all over the world.
The student-led group. Promoting Women's Health and
Human Rights (PWHHR), brought Norsigian to campus.
Hie group studies issues of "social justice through a gender
lens," says senior Tiffany Young, a PWHHR member.
It was"a breakthrough to bring [Norsigian] here," Young
adds. "She's such an important figure."
Before she began her presentation, the author shared a
brief description of the most recent copy of the book — a Ti
betan version — with the audience. Young and other audi
ence members say they found the details of "the books from
around the world" striking.
Norsigian's speech focused on the effects that "media
hype" has on women's body image issues and eating disor
ders. For example, she claimed that the media helps trigger
an increasing drive for low-fat — or even no-fat — diets,
and that this endangers health. She says she regrets that
many women are "avoiding fats that we desperately need"
in order to live up to beauty stereotypes portrayed in mag
azines, television shows and other media.
Additionally, Norsigian addressed the role that movies
play in rising rates of smoking and lung cancer. She said that
often, tobacco companies pay movie producers to include
scenes of actors smoking and that "usually, the attractive char
acters are smoking."
Next, Norsigian discussed what she called "direct-to-con
sumer advertising of prescription drugs" and the problems as
sociated with it. Pharmaceutical companies used to advertise
only to doctors, but in the late 19905, "the Food and Drug Ad
ministration gave guidelines on how to advertise directly to
consumers," she explained. "These ads don't always accurate
ly advertise the drugs — they downplay risks."
One example Norsigian gave concerned the drug tamox
ifen, which was once heavily advertised as decreasing one's
risk of developing breast cancer. She pointed out, however,
that one ad contained an "egregious error" that "confused rel
ative risk and absolute risk." Eventually,"the FDA forced the
company to retract the ad," she added.
Finally, Norsigian talked about egg donation for stem
cell research. She explained that Lupron — a drug used for
multiple-egg extraction — has not yet been approved by
the FDA. Therefore, "asking women to undergo risks for
multiple-egg extraction right now just does not make
sense," Norsigian said.
Stanford medical student Peter Simon says that he found
this topic the most interesting part of the lecture.
"Whereas much of the opposition to stem cell research
currently comes from the conservative right because of pro
life issues, [Norsigian] presented entirely different arguments
against it, such as the exploitation and safety of women,"
Simon says.
He attended the lecture because he had "heard about the
book and was interested in women's health issues," and as
serts that "solutions to these problems can't only come from
women."
But PWHHR does not have any male members,according
to senior Ariana Milman.
"[Males] do come to events, though." Milman says. "Even
if they're not active members. We are trying to extend [the
group] to guys."
PWHHR encourages all students interested in women's
health to get involved in their efforts and activities. The
group meets on Tuesdays at K p.m. in the Women's Commu
nity Center.
