# At least I won't get syphilis
## 
### 
My week that started with an amaz
ing high — watching Kobe Bryant
score 81 points at the Staples Cen
ter on Sunday night (be envious. Be very en
vious!) — is going to end on, shall we say, a
lower point. Sprawled out, vulnerable, on a
gynecological exam table, to be exact.'[hat's
right. Friday 1 have to go to the gyno, an an
nual appointment I dread 365 days a year.
I really like my gynecologist. She's real
ly smart, and I waited more than six
months to become one of her patients. I
even kind of want to pursue obstetrics and
gynecology as a medical specialty.
In terms of the actual visit, the minor
discomfort of the exam and Pap smear are
no big deal. It's very quick.The obvious em
barrassment of disrobing and lying on the
cold exam table with my feet in the stirrups
is also completely clinical and mundane.
So why do I really hate going? It's all
the prying questions that bother me.
First the nurse asks me all about
who/what/when/why/how, and then the
physician asks the same. Last year I was
flattered that they did not believe me when
1 said I didn't have a lot to brag about. At
least there was something to be discussed.
This year I've really set an all-time low.
I personally have no problem with the
fact that I'm not getting any. I'm a very
busy girl. I haven't been in a relationship
since 2004, I'm not a big fan of casual sex
and I've been in a different city almost
every other weekend this academic year. I
like to spend my limited free time out with
friends — people I already know I love —
not on awkward dates with people I'll most
likely never want to see again. Plus, being a
senior and applying to medical school isn't
exactly conducive to a sex life.
So I'm fine with this conversation up
to the point at which my physician wants
to test me for everything in the book. I get
annoyed when she asks one by one if I
"might have (blank)." As if maybe I for
got to mention something. No, really, I am
clean as a whistle. I'm not making it up to
avoid the awkward "Ms. Ramos, we need
to treat you for syphilis" conversation
down the line. And then eventually I'll
start to feel a little insecure and then a lit
tle offended the more I hear myself af
firm that I'm not getting laid.
Then finally I'll get to hear all about
how normal college-aged kids have tons
and tons of sex and how my chance of de
veloping cervical cancer increases with the
number of sexual partners. Certain types
of the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV),
which you are typically exposed to through
unprotected sex, have indeed been found
in cervical cells in cancerous or pre-cancer
ous stages. My doctor will also mention
how having children may reduce my
chances of contracting ovarian cancer.
Noooooooo! I don't want to have kids, I'll
retort, so just kill me (or better yet, take
out my stupid ovaries).
Whatever.so I'm not getting any. I don't
have to get tested for anything this way.
Besides, I did see Kobe score 81 points on
Sunday night. That was quite an orgasm.

Not getting any either? Let's watch the Lak
ers together. E-mail nranios@stanford.edu.
