Another Sunday morning arrives and you
have to finish the work you've avoided since
Friday afternoon. But that raging headache
from a long night of drinking, partying and
grinding with that pretty girl or cute guy pre
vents you from focusing on your problem set.
Your eyes are so bloodshot that you can bare
ly read the words in your textbook. What you
need is some sort of miracle to remedy this
monster of a hangover. Does any such thing
exist?
You've probably tried the usual remedies,
like coffee and aspirin. While they seem to
work pretty well, they still don't get you com
pletely back to normal. Of course, there are al
ways the other so-called cures like the Fire
cracker — a 50/50 shot of tequila and Tabasco
sauce. There are also cures that will have you
running around like Hilary Duff on crack, like
an ice cold Dr. Pepper followed by a Mocha
Frappuccino with extra mocha sauce.
And the natural beverage company MD
Drinks, Inc. recently created Function, a bever
age that the inventors claim is a medical cure
for the hangover. A physician founded MD
Drinks. Inc. "to bring effective, science-based.

all natural functional beverages to the market
place," its Web site says.
Function is a blend of fruity flavors, but
tastes like many dietary or supplemental
drinks out on the market. Still, it's not half bad.
and it's supposed to make you feel better by re
hydrating your system. Function is "infused
with an enzyme called N-acetyl cysteine
(which is what ER doctors give to patients who
come into the hospital with alcohol poison
ing)," the company says.
But according to the Poison Control Hot
line, N-acetyl cysteine is not used for alcohol
poisoning. Rather, doctors give it to people
who have taken too much or had a bad reac
tion to Tylenol. Patients who come in for alco
hol poisoning are usually given something else
that has nothing to do with this enzyme, the
hotline says.
In addition. Natalie Larson — a nurse at
Redwood City's Sequoia Drug and Alcohol
Rehabilitation Center, which specializes in
detoxification — says that there is no cure for
hangovers.
"There's nothing you can do except wait
until the alcohol leaves the body on its own."
Larson explains. "The rate at which it does this
is .015 percent BAC, which means that if your
blood alcohol content is .150, it will take 10

hours for it to fully leave your body through
sweat or urine."
According to Larson, the best you can do is
take Tylenol to get rid of headache symptoms
or drink Gatorade to replace electrolytes.
"There's no difference between alcohols,
whether you're drinking tequila, vodka, wine or
beer," Larson adds. "The different claims that
people have in terms of the feeling a certain
liquor produces usually has to do with the at
mosphere. For example, the reason you feel
more relaxed when you drink wine is because
you're usually just relaxing in general and the
reason you feel so energized after taking
shots is because you're usually getting V
ready to go to a party or listening to high I I
energy music.The drink does not make aIL
difference on how you feel the next day 40
either. Alcohol is alcohol is alcohol and
no matter what form it is in, the only thing that
will have an effect is how much you drink. The
only cure is time."
Of course, should you choose to continue
your search fora hangover cure, there is always
a high-energy activity, followed by a cold show
er, followed bv a feast of deep fried, high-calo
rie foods that will give you a plethora of other
problems and make you forget about your
hangover altogether.
