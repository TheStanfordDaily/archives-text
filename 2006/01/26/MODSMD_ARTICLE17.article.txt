SUBJECT: Domestic Wiretapping Affects YOU
Dear charmingly complacent Stanford students:
By now, most of you have hopefully taken a break from fountain-hopping, disc golf and
partying long enough to have heard that the National Security Agency has been analyz
ing large volumes of telephone and Internet communication coming into and out of the
United States without court-approved warrants.
Your instinctive response may be to say, "So what?"
The Daily's story on Jan. 23 about Prof. Larry Diamond's participation in the American
Civil Liberties Union's lawsuit against the Bush administration's domestic eavesdrop
ping program only reinforces what should already be readily apparent: this wiretapping
affects YOU.
Our generation is more reliant on technology for communication than any previous
generation. We call our parents on cell phones that can be overheard, find each other
at parties using text messages that can be intercepted, order packages and conduct
business through e-mails that can be traced and viewed. We do a host of other things
over IP addresses, the records of which can (and have) been scanned and analyzed.
Where our grandparent's generation may have occasionally called home on the phone,
they conducted most of their correspondence through the Wells Fargo-style mail or,
God forbid, in person.
The use of wiretapping is growing in usefulness and scope as a tool for intelligence
gathering — with that comes increased government access to all aspects of our daily
lives.
The domestic wiretapping brings up two important issues: First, procedurally,
should our president and his administration be allowed to issue orders by fiat and
sidestep established federal procedures before spying on U.S. citizens? Second, sub
stantively, are we comfortable being spied on in the name of national security, even
when the burden of proof that we may be related to terrorists is startlingly low?
We can understand why you may be apathetic about the riots in France or the earth
quake in Pakistan, two international issues about which this editorial board has previ
ously written. These issues might not directly affect you (or, at least, resonate with your
most immediate concerns).
But this issue affects you and your civil liberties. Think about it. Ask yourself if you
agree with the wiretapping. Discuss with your friends whether you are at all comfort
able with this administration sidestepping a simple warrant for the sake of protect
ing national security. The answers to both questions may be yes, a position with
which we disagree but can respect — as long as you've spent time considering the
matter.
But just because we are privileged to be at a relaxed, comfortable and thoroughly bub
bled university does not mean we are exempt from such weighty considerations as the
sanctity of our fundamental rights and liberties. Otherwise, someday soon, as in George
Orwell's classic "1984," you may find yourself saving certain discussions for in-person
communication, rather than the many übiquitous forms of technology on which we
have become so thoroughly reliant.
