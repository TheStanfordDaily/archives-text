# Cardinal Men's Basketball
## Pac-10 Conference Matchups ON THE LINE Men enter critical home series against WSU and No. 10 Washington 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
Conventional wisdom would dictate that
when Washington State and Washington
come to town this weekend to face the Car
dinal men's basketball team, most of Stan
ford's preparation would be geared toward
the No. 10 Huskies.
The Cardinal (8-7,4-3 Pacific-10 Confer

matchup at home against Washington (16-2,
5-2), but for the time being the focus is on the
Cougars (9-7, 2-5), who come to Maples

pressure on the ball."
The Cougars are led by head coach Dick
Bennett, known as one of the best defensive
coaches in the nation. His teams are
renowned for their slow-paced and techni

game the way it is supposed to be played.
There is a premium on making good deci

On the season, WSU is leading the con

points per game. The Cougars' deliberate
pace means that the Cardinal will have to

Stanford will be aided by a critical injury
in the Cougars' starting lineup. Sophomore
point guard Derrick Low has missed the last
five games after suffering a broken foot in
practice on Jan. 3. Prior to the injury. Low
was second on the team in points and assists
and had started the first 11 contests.
"Losing Derrick Low to their basketball
team is like losing Chris Hernandez to ours,"
