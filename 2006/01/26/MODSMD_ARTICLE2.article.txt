# Cardinal Men's Basketball
## Pac-10 Conference Matchups ON THE LINE Men enter critical home series against WSU and No. 10 Washington 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
Conventional wisdom would dictate that
when Washington State and Washington
come to town this weekend to face the Car
dinal men's basketball team, most of Stan
ford's preparation would be geared toward
the No. 10 Huskies.
The Cardinal (8-7,4-3 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) are looking ahead to a Sunday
matchup at home against Washington (16-2,
5-2), but for the time being the focus is on the
Cougars (9-7, 2-5), who come to Maples
tonight.
While Washington State may be less
flashy compared to their instate rivals, Stan
ford head coach Trent Johnson remembers
last year's 0-2 regular season record against
the Cougars.
"Every team has its own set of problems
in terms of preparation," Johnson said.
"Washington State is a team that doesn't
beat itself. They really value the possession
of the basketball. Defensively, they present a
real difficulty. You have to understand that
every shot you take is going to be chal
lenged. They are always going to be putting
pressure on the ball."
The Cougars are led by head coach Dick
Bennett, known as one of the best defensive
coaches in the nation. His teams are
renowned for their slow-paced and techni
cally-sound style of play.
"The average fan may think that Dick
Bennett-coached teams are boring," John
son said. "I think it's special. He teaches the
game the way it is supposed to be played.
There is a premium on making good deci
sions. There is a premium on playing with a
level of toughness. For us, it's a challenge."
On the season, WSU is leading the con
ference in scoring defense, giving up just 56.9
points per game. The Cougars' deliberate
pace means that the Cardinal will have to

Stanford will be aided by a critical injury
in the Cougars' starting lineup. Sophomore
point guard Derrick Low has missed the last
five games after suffering a broken foot in
practice on Jan. 3. Prior to the injury. Low
was second on the team in points and assists
and had started the first 11 contests.
"Losing Derrick Low to their basketball
team is like losing Chris Hernandez to ours,"

Cougars, Huskies present
unique challenges for Cardinal

Johnson said. "But they've shown
that they're capable of playing well
without him."
The Cardinal haven't been able to
avoid the injury bug either. Sopho
more center Peter Prowitt missed an
other week of practice with a spinal
bruise in his lower back. Johnson said
that even if the team's medical staff
clears him. Prowitt may not play
tonight.
Hernandez, a senior guard,
missed practice this week as well due
to back spasms. His pain was so bad
against Arizona State last week that
he was not able to sit down on the
bench during timeouts because it
hurt too much to stand up.
"Regardless of what Chris tells
you. you don't understand how much
pain he was in this last week," John
son said. "(Just try] to get up when
you have lower back spasms, let
alone play."
Rounding out the major injuries
for the Cardinal is Fred Washington,
who underwent surgery on his left
knee on Monday and will be out for
the rest of the season.
Fortunately for Stanford, senior
forward Matt Haryasz picked up the
slack against the Arizona schools,
going off for 52 points and 17 re
bounds in two games en route to win
ning last week's Pac-10 Player cf the
Week award.

al two days of rest between games —
a time that can be used to get health
ier — before facing No. 10 Washing
ton on Sunday.
The Huskies have been one of the
pleasant surprises in the Pac-10,
jumping out to an early lead in the
conference race. They have picked
up impressive wins over then No. 6
Gonzaga.then No. 11 UCI.A on the

road and took Arizona to double
overtime before finally losing 95-%
in what could be the most exciting
conference game to date.
TTie Huskies play a completely
different style of basketball than
Washington State; while the Cougars
score a paltry 62.9 points per game,
Washington leads the nation in scor
ing offense at 86.8 points per game.
Senior Brandon Roy has been the of
fensive star for the Huskies this year,
averaging 18.2 points per game to go
along with 5.3 rebounds.
While Roy provides the offensive
fireworks and the senior leadership,
some of his most important team
mates are freshmen. Jon Brockman
and Justin Dentmon, two first-year
players, have been fixtures in the
Husky staring lineup this season.
Brockman averages 10 points per
game, while Dentmon averages 8.3.
"We were hoping that [Brock-

man| could average somewhere
around double figures and grab
seven or eight rebounds a game, and
that is what he is doing," said Wash
ington head coach Lorenzo Romar
about his highly-recruited freshman,
"You look across the country and
you look at the McDonald's All-
American's from last year and you
look at their numbers, you will see
that Jon is in the top five of those Mc-
Donald's All Americans, in terms of
their numbers and productivity,"
Washington is hoping that this
year's incoming class will finally help
the Huskies achieve some success in
Northern California. Washington has
not swept the Stanford and Califor
nia series in the Bay Area since I^Bs.
Starting tonight, the Cardinal
would love to pick up a critical win
over a top 10 team, keeping the
Huskies begging in the Bay Area
once again.

THE FORECAST
The Cardinal went 0-2 against the Cougars in the regular season last year. They hope to do better this
year against a team known for its stingy defense and slow and steady play.
