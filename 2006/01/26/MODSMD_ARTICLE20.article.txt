# [SPAM######] Stanford cheap!
## 
### 
Spam is a funny thing. It annoys us, we go
to great lengths to block it and it's al
ways finding new and creative ways to
attack us — not unlike a Chem 31 teaching
assistant. It is designed to catch our eye and
draw us in, and in this way it reveals a lot
about our society. Study the subject lines of
all the spam in your mailbox and it invariably
falls into two types: money and sex and the
fastest routes to both. But most spam is tar
geted to an older, less virile audience. As
such, I submit to prescription drug importers
and pornographers spam with a Stanford
slant, in the hopes that my Webmail inbox
will one day be filled with something more
relevant to my life.
