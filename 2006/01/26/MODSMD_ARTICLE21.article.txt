# Baran's razor: why 'The OCâ€™just can't be real
## 
### 
Since I started listening to my iPod shuffle
around campus, my life feels a lot like a
movie. When our character is entering
Green Library, it's the Wagner tunc,"Ride of
the Valkyries" whose loftiness contrasts with
the utter insignificance of the moment. The
contrast is so off-key that it produces a smile.
Before I got an iPod. 1 only felt like 1 was in
a movie sometimes. It would happen when I
was in a car and everyone was silent, but the
car stereo kept playing. Ihe characters, weary
of a days journey, stare blankly around in the
car as we hear a soft tune that makes us feel
bad for no reason.
It's "In Limbo" by Radiohead as our char
acter thinks what to write next.
To be honest with you, these pseudo-scenes
always felt much more real to me. In your typ
ical cheesy, phony Hollywood flick, you can al
ways count on good guys to win. where win
ning ranges from saving the world to having
sex with some hot woman. I keep thinking to
myself, "Why can't movies be more like life?
Why does everything in movies and television
shows need to be so phony?"
At a dinner table, feeling disquieted by the
silence, I ask. "Why does everything in Ihe
OC" need to be so phony? 1 mean, other shows
are phony, too, but they at least have some
grain of truth."
Feeling suddenly enlivened. 1 ask a friend at
that dinner.'Did you know that there is no mi
nority character in 'The OC?"'
"Well, not many minorities live in the OC."
my interlocutor tells me.
"1 checked the demographics," 1 say. "It's
only 64.81 percent white." And all my listeners

fall into hysterical laughter.
Having charged the most popular show on
campus of phoniness, I feel a certain burden of
proof on my shoulders. Just explaining that
there are no minorities doesn't make it totally
fake. Fora conclusive argument, I need to use
my most valuable contribution to life, Baran's
Razor.
In science (and other fields), there is a
philosophical idea that goes by the name of
"Occam's Razor," attributed to 14th century
English logician William of Ockham. Formally,
Occam's Razor states that entities required to
explain an event should not be multiplied be
yond necessity.This means that given two com
peting explanations of a situation, choose the
simpler one. (The notion of simplicity is a con
troversial one. but 1 don't have space to discuss
this controversy.)
For example.suppose paper sheets started
flying around in a room. You are given two
competing explanations: (a) a mysterious soul
threw them around or (b) the wind blew in
through the window. Choice b is in many ways
the simpler explanation and therefore is to be
preferred according to Occam's Razor.
Occam's Razor "shaves off' all explanations

except the simplest one.
Having paid my homage to a fellow
philosopher, I 'd like to present Baran's Razor:
Baron's Razor: In any given situation in
volving people and their interactions with one
another, choose the most boring explanation
that accounts for the situation.
So. let's see Baran's Razor in action. Re
member the cute girl (or guy) who just hazily
glanced at your direction? Well, pal. she wasn't
looking at you. She was waiting for her friend
and looked to see if her friend came. And you
know what, she probably has a boyfriend.
This particular example might give the im
pression that Baran's Razor always favors pes
simism, lliis is wrong. What Baran's Razor fa
vors is boredom. Let me illustrate with an ex
ample. Remember that girl who you thought
hated your guts? Guess what.she doesn't even
remember you. She doesn't have enough
knowledge about you to form any opinion.
Armed with the lethal weaponry of Baran's
Razor, let us return to "The OC." First, all of
the characters (except the protagonist) in the
show are good looking. This is just too exciting
to be true/Ihere is an ongoing drama of inter
nal conflicts, of confusions, of feuds and break
ups. In one episode, one character may ascend
to the height of morality and in the next de
scend to the pit of egoism. Such emotional
drama and character trait fluctuations don't
happen in reality. Iliese are too exciting, and
life is too boring. Consequently, Baran's Razor
entirely shaves off "The OC."
I can hear my cerebral readers saying.
"What about the times when we have real
drama? What about the time I got so drunk

that I almost killed myself? What about the
time I made out with this girl because she was
too drunk to notice anything?" My view is that
these incidents are to be regarded as statistical
anomalies that have no bearing on the general
trend that Baran's Razor captures so vividly. If
999 of 1 .(KK) coins are copper and one is gold,
I'd side with the man who says "all are copper"
instead of the man who says "all (or even
some) are gold."
One option is to suspend our boredom by
indulging ourselves in TV drama like "The
OC." Alternatively, we can create drama in our
lives and get into silly struggles with our
friends and loved ones.This can have negative
consequences. Albert Camus writes in"The
Rebel" of a woman who committed suicide.
She thought the rocks down a cliff were like
those in Emily Bronte's "Wuthering Heights'
and decided to throw herself off the cliff. Nei
ther the onscreen nor real-life version of
drama is a viable option for me. I tend to value
truth and common sense rather highly.
My proposed solution is that we unite in
solidarity against the monotony that so intru
sively underpins our reality. Once we have
given up on the notion that our lives won't be
poetic, our interactions become more interest
ing and real. As Jon Winokur wrote,"So. ennui
sufferers unite! You have nothing to lose but
the blahs."
It's "End of the Movie" by Cake as our
character finishes his column.

does. E-mail him at cihanh@stanford.edu.

the Valkyries" whose loftiness contrasts with
the utter insignificance of the moment. The
contrast is so off-key that it produces a smile.
Before I got an iPod. 1 only felt like 1 was in
a movie sometimes. It would happen when I
was in a car and everyone was silent, but the
car stereo kept playing. Ihe characters, weary
of a days journey, stare blankly around in the
car as we hear a soft tune that makes us feel
bad for no reason.
It's "In Limbo" by Radiohead as our char
acter thinks what to write next.
To be honest with you, these pseudo-scenes
always felt much more real to me. In your typ
ical cheesy, phony Hollywood flick, you can al
ways count on good guys to win. where win
ning ranges from saving the world to having
sex with some hot woman. I keep thinking to
myself, "Why can't movies be more like life?
Why does everything in movies and television
shows need to be so phony?"
At a dinner table, feeling disquieted by the
silence, I ask. "Why does everything in Ihe
OC" need to be so phony? 1 mean, other shows
are phony, too, but they at least have some
grain of truth."
Feeling suddenly enlivened. 1 ask a friend at
that dinner.'Did you know that there is no mi
nority character in 'The OC?"'
"Well, not many minorities live in the OC."
my interlocutor tells me.
"1 checked the demographics," 1 say. "It's
only 64.81 percent white." And all my listeners

fall into hysterical laughter.
Having charged the most popular show on
campus of phoniness, I feel a certain burden of
proof on my shoulders. Just explaining that
there are no minorities doesn't make it totally
fake. Fora conclusive argument, I need to use
my most valuable contribution to life, Baran's
Razor.
In science (and other fields), there is a
philosophical idea that goes by the name of
"Occam's Razor," attributed to 14th century
English logician William of Ockham. Formally,
Occam's Razor states that entities required to
explain an event should not be multiplied be
yond necessity.This means that given two com
peting explanations of a situation, choose the
simpler one. (The notion of simplicity is a con
troversial one. but 1 don't have space to discuss
this controversy.)
For example.suppose paper sheets started
flying around in a room. You are given two
competing explanations: (a) a mysterious soul
threw them around or (b) the wind blew in
through the window. Choice b is in many ways
the simpler explanation and therefore is to be
preferred according to Occam's Razor.
Occam's Razor "shaves off' all explanations

except the simplest one.
Having paid my homage to a fellow
philosopher, I 'd like to present Baran's Razor:
Baron's Razor: In any given situation in
volving people and their interactions with one
another, choose the most boring explanation
that accounts for the situation.
So. let's see Baran's Razor in action. Re
member the cute girl (or guy) who just hazily
glanced at your direction? Well, pal. she wasn't
looking at you. She was waiting for her friend
and looked to see if her friend came. And you
know what, she probably has a boyfriend.
This particular example might give the im
pression that Baran's Razor always favors pes
simism, lliis is wrong. What Baran's Razor fa
vors is boredom. Let me illustrate with an ex
ample. Remember that girl who you thought
hated your guts? Guess what.she doesn't even
remember you. She doesn't have enough
knowledge about you to form any opinion.
Armed with the lethal weaponry of Baran's
Razor, let us return to "The OC." First, all of
the characters (except the protagonist) in the
show are good looking. This is just too exciting
to be true/Ihere is an ongoing drama of inter
nal conflicts, of confusions, of feuds and break
ups. In one episode, one character may ascend
to the height of morality and in the next de
scend to the pit of egoism. Such emotional
drama and character trait fluctuations don't
happen in reality. Iliese are too exciting, and
life is too boring. Consequently, Baran's Razor
entirely shaves off "The OC."
I can hear my cerebral readers saying.
"What about the times when we have real
drama? What about the time I got so drunk

that I almost killed myself? What about the
time I made out with this girl because she was
too drunk to notice anything?" My view is that
these incidents are to be regarded as statistical
anomalies that have no bearing on the general
trend that Baran's Razor captures so vividly. If
999 of 1 .(KK) coins are copper and one is gold,
I'd side with the man who says "all are copper"
instead of the man who says "all (or even
some) are gold."
One option is to suspend our boredom by
indulging ourselves in TV drama like "The
OC." Alternatively, we can create drama in our
lives and get into silly struggles with our
friends and loved ones.This can have negative
consequences. Albert Camus writes in"The
Rebel" of a woman who committed suicide.
She thought the rocks down a cliff were like
those in Emily Bronte's "Wuthering Heights'
and decided to throw herself off the cliff. Nei
ther the onscreen nor real-life version of
drama is a viable option for me. I tend to value
truth and common sense rather highly.
My proposed solution is that we unite in
solidarity against the monotony that so intru
sively underpins our reality. Once we have
given up on the notion that our lives won't be
poetic, our interactions become more interest
ing and real. As Jon Winokur wrote,"So. ennui
sufferers unite! You have nothing to lose but
the blahs."
It's "End of the Movie" by Cake as our
character finishes his column.

Cilian feels that his piece doesn t hit the nail on
the head hut the Facebook group "F*#k the OC"
does. E-mail him at cihanh@stanford.edu.
