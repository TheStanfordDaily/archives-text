A cemetery for whom?
Your excellent, balanced front
page article on the anniversary of Roe
vs. Wade ("A Plaza Divided," Jan. 24)
rightly referred to "fetuses...legally
aborted" since 1973 instead of adopt
ing the so-called "pro-life" language
of saying "human beings" have been
"killed."
Of course, anyone has the right to or
ganize a demonstration on this issue.
What we find abhorrent, for the second
year in a row. is the erecting of a blatant
field of crosses that assault rather than
"educate" people, as Stanford Students
for Life claims to be doing.
Last year, with irony, I asked some
one staffing the table whether fetuses
aborted by Jewish women, for instance,
were not equally lamentable. I was
told. "Oh, I think we didn't have
enough wood."
A peaceful green field pierced with
white crosses has to evoke, at least in
people aware of wars past and present,
the military cemeteries harboring sol
diers actually killed while serving their
countries — like the 2.236 Americans
killed in Iraq. A mindless and offensive
equating of those deaths with legally
terminated pregnancies brings tears of
anger and desperation.
