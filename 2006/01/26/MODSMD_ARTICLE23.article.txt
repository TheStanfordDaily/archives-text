# Sometimes you want to be out [on the court] so bad, but I'm hoping my time will come.
## The 						life of a walk-on Brown's experiences as a walk-on help him grow as a player and a teammate 
### SEAN HOWELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It is hard enough to walk on to a
Division I men's basketball team, let
alone one that went 30-2 the year be
fore. But following his admittance to
Stanford, this was what Kenny
Brown tried to accomplish when he
contacted former head coach Mike
Montgomery's coaching staff in the
spring of 2004.
Then-assistant coach Russell
Turner watched Brown's tapes and
encouraged him to come out for the
team in the fall. On a visit to the cam
pus, Brown worked out with the
team and received good feedback
from both coaches and players.
Based on TUrner and Montgomery's
support, it sounded as though the
coaching staff had a spot set aside for
him.
"He was very positive throughout
the process," Brown said of Turner.
"That took some of the pressure out
of the situation."
Then Montgomery left Stanford
for the Golden State Warriors. Turn
er soon followed, and Brown's situa
tion was suddenly up in the air again.
"When school started, 1 had to
start all over, building relationships
with the coaches again," Brown said.
"It was intimidating, especially be
cause 1 didn't know what was going
to happen."
Brown started coming to the gym
to work out with the team at 7 a.m.
He was just starting to become famil
iar with new head coach Trent John
son and his staff, but the fact that
Brown had already been in contact
with the team and players gave him
an edge in the process. Rob Little
and Nick Robinson, seniors at the
time, welcomed Brown as TUrner had
in the spring.
By the time the open tryout rolled
around. Brown's participation in the
process was little more than a techni
cality. He had a spot on the team.
And though the redshirt freshman
guard has only seen game action

WAITING HIS
TURN
Kenny Brown
After redshirting in his first year at
Stanford, Brown has finally got
ten his chance on the court. In
his first action in a Cardinal uni
form on Dec. 21 against Prince
ton, he sunk his first field goal at
tempt from behind the three
point line. His smooth shot and
strong work ethic has made him
a realistic candidate for more
playing time in the future..

once, he hasn't looked back.
"I'm glad I chose Stanford,"
Brown said. "Sometimes you want to
he out [on the court] so bad, but I'm
hoping my time will come."
After he was accepted to Stan
ford. Brown's decision was easy. His
relationship with the Stanford
coaches, especially Turner, was much
better than with the personnel at any
of the other schools that had recruit
ed him — a list that included Pepper
dine, Baylor and several other
schools near his hometown of South
lake.Tex.
Though he said that his family has
struggled at times to pay for his
schooling —as a walk-on. Brown
does not earn a scholarship — his
parents, intent on providing him with
a first-rate education, encouraged
him to go to Stanford.
For Brown, the move has paid off,
if only for the benefit of practicing
with the team.
"I have improved so much, just
playing against good players and
learning from them," he said. "It's
forced me to become better."
To talk to Brown, it would seem
that the experience has been all
gravy. He is energetic and excitable,
and he says that he's laughing and
smiling most of the time. But he read
ily acknowledged that there have
been a few low points and frustrating
moments along the way. At those
moments, however, his teammates
were there to pull him aside and keep

his spirits up.
"People really try to help me out
and not just my 08 friends," Brown
said, referring to classmates Taj Fin
ger and Peter Prowitt. 'A lot of times,
it's the actual leaders of the team, the
seniors — Matt [Haryasz], Dan
[Grunfeld], Chris [Hernandez] and
Jason [HaasJ.They have been instru
mental in keeping me uplifted."
A few moments after Brown
spoke, and as if to demonstrate the
point, Haryasz walked out of a press
conference and put a hand on
Brown's shoulder.
"He's a great kid and a great
teammate," Haryasz said. "And he
has the wettest jumper on the team.
Print that."
"Stuff like that," Brown said,
though he couldn't define "wettest."
"They are also always honest; they'll
really sit down and talk to you. I
know they're not just saying things to
make me feel better. It's genuine."
Brown's anxiety to get into a
game was finally dispelled in a Dec.
21 contest against Princeton at the
Oakland Coliseum. He played five
minutes in the second half of a 58-34
Stanford blowout and sank his first
shot — a three-pointer, fitting fora
player who prides himself on his out
side shooting.
"I felt very relieved," Brown said.
"It made it a better Christmas. I was
n't nervous, I was just really anxious
to get out there."
Anxious defines the situation
well. Brown was on the verge of for
feiting his redshirt status last year.
The team had only eight available
players at times and made due with
just three guards for most of the sea
son. But Brown retained an extra
year of eligibility, something that
might come in handy down the road.
"I really hope that I will be able to
contribute next year," Brown said.
"We will be big-man dominant {with
incoming freshmen Brook and
Robin Lopez], and we will be thinner
at the guard position [with the loss of
Haas, Hernandez and Grunfeld]."
Brown is banking on the Cardinal
needing an outside shooter in years
to come to keep defenses honest. If
his shot in the Princeton game was a
sign — and if Haryasz's assessment
of Brown's jumper was correct —
then there's a good chance he will get
that opportunity.

Redshirt freshman guard Kenny Brown saw limited action in his first season as a walk-on. He scored three points in his
Stanford debut this season, hitting his first career shot.
