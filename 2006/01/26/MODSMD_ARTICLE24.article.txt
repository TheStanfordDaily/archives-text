# Kirk, Card head to LA
## 
### KATHERINE BELL 
After an inspiring win against No.
5 Arizona last weekend, the No. 3
Stanford women's swimming and
diving team should have the confi
dence to perform well against its tal
ented Southern California rivals this
weekend.
On Friday, Stanford heads to Los
Angeles to take on No. 7 UCLA and
then faces No. 12 Southern Califor
nia on Saturday.
Head coach Lea Maurer was proud
of her team's performance against Ari
zona but thinks the competitions this
weekend could be even better.
"At the meet this weekend I
thought we did a great job regroup
ing after each race to prepare for the
next one," Maurer said. "I thought
we had a great team effort in terms
of enthusiasm, support and focus.
Something we need to work on is to
execute the meet the way we did this
weekend but look for faster times
and put tougher expectations on
ourselves."
Dana Kirk, one of the team's sen
ior captains, knows that defeating

both foes will not be an easy feat. In
what could be one of the more excit
ing races of the weekend. Kirk goes
head-to-head with UCLA senior
Kim Vandenberg in the 100- and 200-
yard butterfly. Vandenberg and Kirk
have posted the nation's third and
fourth best times, respectively, in the
200-yard butterfly.
"UCLA and USC are always a
challenge and facing them in their
home pools will only add to that at
mosphere." Kirk said."But as a team
we are stronger and deeper than we
have been in several years, with the
sophomore class in particular mak
ing heads turn around the country."
Kirk referred to the recent per
formances of sophomores Brooke
Bishop and Elizabeth Durot, who
have both had breakout years. Bish
op is positioning herself as one of the
nation's top sprint freestylers and
backstrokers, posting the nation's
fourth top time in both the 100- and
200-yard backstrokes. Durot was
named Swimmer of the Meet at the
Speedo Cup Invitational in Novem
ber following her wins in the 200-,
500- and 1,650-yard freestvles.

Durot is part of a fierce contin
gency of distance swimmers, which
include juniors Desiree Stahley, Lau
ren Costella and Morgan Hentzen.
These women are likely to be relied
upon to set the tone in both meets
with the 1.000-yard freestyle, the
opening individual event.
Other possible strong Cardinal
performers are seniors Kristen
Caverly and Laura Davis in the IM
events and sophomore Erica Liu in
the breaststrokes.
A deep and versatile freshmen
class contributes as well. In the diving
well, junior Cassidy Krug should con
tinue to lead the Cardinal against
strong USC and UCLA diving teams.
This weekend marks the last
string of dual meets before the sea
son ender against California on Feb.
11, and Kirk hopes to learn from this
weekend to prepare for the upcom
ing end-of-season meets.
"Personally, I am looking at this
meet as another chance to practice
different race strategies and to see
our team practice winning, which will
come in handy at our dual meet
against Cal and beyond," she said.
