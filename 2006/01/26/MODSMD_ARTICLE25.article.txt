## Women visit young OSU squad 
### JUSTINA GRAYMAN 
Most freshmen are expected to be
bright-eyed onlookers, temporary
benchwarmers and eager learners.
But there are exceptions.The Cardi
nal women's gymnastics team will
face a number of these unique first
years when the squad takes on Ore
gon State this weekend.
Tomorrow's meet in Corvallis pits
the Beavers, a team struck by depart
ed faces, against the Cardinal, a team
which returned much of its roster.
The No. 19 Beavers placed second
to UCLA in their season opener at
Oahu, Hawaii. OSU returned only 10
of 24 routines from 2005, and in its
first meet, over half the routines
were performed by freshmen.
Sixth-ranked Stanford aptly
boasts, "We're All Back" as its sug
gestive media slogan. All of the
starters from last year are back for
more, and the team is beginning to
reveal its depth and focus on consis
tency. Head coach Kristen Smyth
commented that her three goals for
Friday were to be consistent, to stick
landings and to have depth.
OSU's top returnees include sen
ior Chrissy Lamun. senior Angela
Morales and sophomore Megan De
vencenzi. But Oregon State fresh
men seem to be doing more than tak
ing in the newness of their collegiate
experiences
Freshman Tasha Smith garnered
the all-around title at the Beavers'
Jan. 13 meet against Florida,
Brigham Young and lowa. Smith and
freshman Jamie Lanz have season
highs of at least 9.8 in three events.
Lamun, a strong leader for the
Beavers, has already scored at or
above 9.85 this year on three events.
She is ranked 13th in the nation and
fifth in the Pac-10 in the all-around.
For Stanford, sophomore Tabitha
Yim — last week's Pac-10 Gymnast
of the Week — has an impressive
season record. She scored a 9.9 or
above on three events at the team's
Jan. 15 meet. Her high scores not
only set a career-high 39.6. but she
also garnered the meet's all-around
title and a top-ranking in the country.
Yim is the top-ranked gymnast in
the conference in all events except
the uneven bars, where she is ranked
second only to sophomore teammate
Liz IVicase. Senior Natalie Foley is
also strong across events and holds a
No. 9 national ranking in the all
around.
OSU freshman Nicole Ourada,
who is ranked seventh nationally and
second in the Pac-10 on floor, has
also shown her potential. She has al

ready posted a 9.9 this season and
will challenge the skill level of the
competition with a full-in on floor.
Freshman Kelly Fee is also upping
her skill level with a triple full-twist
ing layout.
Veterans have also posted im
pressive numbers.
Stanford senior Glyn Sweets and
Yim currently share a No. 3 ranking
on vault in the Pac-10. Both have
scored 9.9 or above on the event this
season. Yim and Foley excel at the
beam, and feliow upperclassman
Sweets will increase her difficulty on
beam by performing a front tuck.
At Stanford's last home meet, the
Cardinal dominated the top three in

every event, including the all
around. Most recently, Oregon State
scored a 195.4 in its meet against
UCLA on Jan. 22. All three all
around gymnasts (Lamun, Lanz and
Smith) scored at or above 39.0 in the
meet.
Whether freshman or veteran.
Beaver or Cardinal, the important
thing the gymnasts have to focus on
is individual performance. And when
asked which is more important, ab
solute scores or relative places,
Smyth had a stern response.
"Neither are important," she said.
" ITie most important thing is that
our girls perform as well as they can.
Iliat's all that we can control."
