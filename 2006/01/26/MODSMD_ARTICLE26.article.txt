## Sherlock Holmes project channels Victorian England Stories released the same way they were in 1891 
### MATTHEW BOYD 
Try to imagine a time without radio, televi
sion, movie theatres or cell phones bringing you
instant entertainment and live news. Such was
the era of Victorian England, during which
Arthur Conan Doyle's "Adventures of Sherlock
Holmes" served as the 19th century equivalent
to today's Friends, 24, Law and Order and
countless other smash-hit television series that
draw religious followings.
At Stanford, the Discovering Sherlock
Holmes project seeks to keep this tradition alive
by serially releasing Sherlock Holmes stories in
the same manner they were printed in illustrat
ed in Ilie Strand Magazine between July 1891
and June 1892.
"Ihis project is a unique opportunity to show
today's readers how works originally appeared
and to provide them with the same experience
(as) a person reading in the nineteenth century,"
said Margaret Kimball, University archivist and
special collections librarian. "Especially given
how we all get tied to electronic media, it is good
to understand how works were originally dis
tributed and received."
Hie Discovering Sherlock Holmes project
was largely the brainchild of Linda Paulson, as
sociate dean and director of the master of Lib
eral Arts Program, who is also the director of
the Discovering Sherlock Holmes program.
The project has come to include the support of
Continuing Studies at Stanford, University
President John Hennessy,The Stanford Alum
ni Association and Stanford University Li
braries.
"The project began in 2(X)2-2(X)3, with an 18
week release of the facsimile of the serial ver
sions of Dickens' 1860-1861 novel,' Great Ex
pectations'; in 2004, we released Dickens' A
Tale of Two Cities over 15 weeks," said Paulson,
who also directed the Discovering Dickens pro
gram, the inspiration for the Holmes project.
"'lTie project. Discovering Sherlock Holmes,
runs this year from January 27 through April 14,
with one serial number arriving each Friday for
12 weeks. This year we're offering two early
short stories, 'A Scandal in Bohemia' and 'The
Speckled Band'; the full nine-part series of 'The
Hound of Baskervilles;' and the final' Holmes
story, the confrontation between Holmes and
Moriarty.'The Final Problem."'

With almost 12,000 subscribers alreadv
signed up, the success of the Sherlock Holmes
project so far has organizers surprised.
"When Linda Paulson told me that Sherlock
Holmes had been chosen as the successor to
Dickens, I was delighted, and confident that it
would prove to be a terrific and popular choice,
said Special Collections Librarian John Mus
tain. "I had no idea then how popular it would
become."
Indeed the project has been so successful
that its reach has extended far beyond Stanford
and Palo Alto. The group offers both paper fac
smiles of the original magazine releases as well
as digital copies on its Web site.
"We originally thought that this would be a
local program, but we have subscribers from all
50 states, and we have many requests from
abroad," Paulson said.
If the project sought to preserve the tradition
of printed, serial entertainment, it certainly
seems to have done so. 1 lowever, organizers say
the project is as much a tribute to Conan Doyle
as it is to the tradition of popular literature.
"1 have been interested in Sherlock Holmes
and a fan of Arthur Conan Doyle since first
reading the 1 lolmes stories when 1 was in junior
high school," Mustain said. "The stories are
wonderful and the characters memorable. This
project highlights a prolific writer of his time,
who wrote on a wide variety of subjects; Sher
lock Holmes is what he is most famous for, but
his historical novels are good reads and his
Brigadier Gerard stories are among the most
fun short stories 1 have ever read."
According to Mustain, if any university is
most apt to undertake the task of preserving the
legacy of Conan Doyle and the timeless stories
of Sherlock Holmes, it is Stanford.
"Doyle as a novelist, man of letters and a fig
ure in English literature has been a part of the
Stanford library collections, I would guess, since
the early years of the University," Mustain said.
"We certainly have editions in our general
stacks collections that date from the late nine
teenth and early twentieth century."
Stanford's libraries also contain Conan
Doyle's writings on the Boer War, The Great
War (WWI), Spiritualism, his autobiographical
works and much of his fiction.
"We are exceptionally fortunate, however, in
that the Stanford University Libraries' Depart
ment of Special Collections and University
Archives has an extensive collection of books
by and about Arthur Conan Doyle, including
the Sherlock Holmes stories," Mustain said.

Stanford's libraries also contain Conan
Doyle's writings on the Boer War, The Great
War (WWI), Spiritualism, his autobiographical
works and much of his fiction.
"We are exceptionally fortunate, however, in
that the Stanford University Libraries' Depart
ment of Special Collections and University
Archives has an extensive collection of books
by and about Arthur Conan Doyle, including
the Sherlock Holmes stories," Mustain said.
