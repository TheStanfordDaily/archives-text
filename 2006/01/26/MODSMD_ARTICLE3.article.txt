# Nash, Kobe and Wade â€”10 Laws of NBA Action
## 
### 
This half-season of NBA play reveals
what 1 like to call the 10 Laws of NBA
Action.
Law I: Nash's Equilibrium.
No matter who plays with Stev.e Nash, he'll
always find a way to guide the team to victory.
He won the MVP last year, but his perform
ance this season has been even more amazing.
Phoenix replaces Joe Johnson and Quentin
Richardson with castoffs Raja Bell and Boris
Diaw. No problem. Amare Stoudamire hasn't
played yet. Wait, is that Phoenix in first place?
I'm convinced that Steve could win the Pacif
ic Division with my fraternity's intramural
basketball team. If he did, would it really sur
prise you?
Law 2: Kobe can score. But I'd rather have
Shaq on my team.
