# Nash, Kobe and Wade —10 Laws of NBA Action
## 
### 
This half-season of NBA play reveals
what 1 like to call the 10 Laws of NBA
Action.
Law I: Nash's Equilibrium.
No matter who plays with Stev.e Nash, he'll
always find a way to guide the team to victory.
He won the MVP last year, but his perform
ance this season has been even more amazing.
Phoenix replaces Joe Johnson and Quentin
Richardson with castoffs Raja Bell and Boris
Diaw. No problem. Amare Stoudamire hasn't
played yet. Wait, is that Phoenix in first place?
I'm convinced that Steve could win the Pacif
ic Division with my fraternity's intramural
basketball team. If he did, would it really sur
prise you?
Law 2: Kobe can score. But I'd rather have
Shaq on my team.

10 — right behind Stanford — and
is on a five-game winning streak,
which included a recent close 73-70
win over UCLA.
"USC's going to he really deter
mined to heat us at their place
same with UCLA — but this is espe
cially a huge matchup for us because
we're one and two in the rankings,"
Wiggins said.
Though its team is young, USC is
riding on a wave of talent. Sopho
more guard Camille LeNoir was
named last week's Pac-10 Player of
the Week and junior guard Eshaya
Murphy is No. 5 in conference scor
ing with an average 16.4 points per
game.
"USC's a very deep, very aggres
sive team and rebounds very well,"
Smith said. The Cardinal's
own rebounding has been a main
focus in this week's practices, as has
defense. This follows a close victory
against No. 15 Arizona State, during
which the Sun Devils exploited easy
baskets en route to a halftime lead.
"Our transition defense is going
to be really key against both USC
and UCLA — that we don't give
them the easy shots we gave Arizona
State in the first half," VanDerveer
said. "We really have to get matched
up quickly and turn it around. Both
teams have excellent point guards
and excellent back courts that score
and really push the tempo."
With the motivation and home
court advantage of the LA schools,
the Cardinal will have to come out
fierce from the start — something
they haven't done in recent games.
Against California and ASU this
month, Stanford started softly. Ihe
Sun Devils even held the lead until
the last 10 minutes when the Cardi
nal rallied to an 84-78 victory.
"I think it's always been a prob
lem for Stanford," Wiggins said.
"Everyone always perceives us as
the nice team, or the nice girls from
Stanford that aren't going to push
them around ... I think it's all about
getting that mentality — you really
just have to have that Tm-going to
push you-back' mentality, and I
think we're working all the time on
it."
In an effort to improve and hope
fully bring out the squad's aggres
sion, VanDerveer brought in male
players to this week's practice.
" llicy'rc a reminder that the
game can be played quicker, that we
need to be more aggressive, and that
we need to box people out." Van-
Derveer said.
Reentering the fold this weekend
is sophomore guard Cissy Pierce,
who served a two-game suspension
for missing practice last week. Van-
Derveer confirmed she is ready to
play.
"Cissy's really working hard in
practice, and she's really pushing us
and showing that she really wants to
be a part of the team -it's great to
have her back and playing hard for
us." Wiggins said.
Pierce's presence and the recent
return of junior center Kristen Newl
in prepare the Cardinal to mount a
potent attack in LA this weekend.
"If we are the aggressor, it's not
going to be about them." Wiggins
said."lt's going to be about what we
do on our team."

I'lie ( aidiiml are coining oj) oj (i tough home win against No. 15 Arizona State at home. The win
should provide them n ith some momentum as they take on a solid No. 23 USC team this weekend.

end 11 i"y round out tlir In si half of ihe conleience season 8-1 and begin the second half tomorrow in L.A.
This half-season of NBA play reveals
what 1 like to call the 10 Laws of NBA
Action.
Law I: Nash's Equilibrium.
No matter who plays with Stev.e Nash, he'll
always find a way to guide the team to victory.
He won the MVP last year, but his perform
ance this season has been even more amazing.
Phoenix replaces Joe Johnson and Quentin
Richardson with castoffs Raja Bell and Boris
Diaw. No problem. Amare Stoudamire hasn't
played yet. Wait, is that Phoenix in first place?
I'm convinced that Steve could win the Pacif
ic Division with my fraternity's intramural
basketball team. If he did, would it really sur
prise you?
Law 2: Kobe can score. But I'd rather have
Shaq on my team.

10 — right behind Stanford — and
is on a five-game winning streak,
which included a recent close 73-70
win over UCLA.
"USC's going to he really deter
mined to heat us at their place
same with UCLA — but this is espe
cially a huge matchup for us because
we're one and two in the rankings,"
Wiggins said.
Though its team is young, USC is
riding on a wave of talent. Sopho
more guard Camille LeNoir was
named last week's Pac-10 Player of
the Week and junior guard Eshaya
Murphy is No. 5 in conference scor
ing with an average 16.4 points per
game.
"USC's a very deep, very aggres
sive team and rebounds very well,"
Smith said. The Cardinal's
own rebounding has been a main
focus in this week's practices, as has
defense. This follows a close victory
against No. 15 Arizona State, during
which the Sun Devils exploited easy
baskets en route to a halftime lead.
"Our transition defense is going
to be really key against both USC
and UCLA — that we don't give
them the easy shots we gave Arizona
State in the first half," VanDerveer
said. "We really have to get matched
up quickly and turn it around. Both
teams have excellent point guards
and excellent back courts that score
and really push the tempo."
With the motivation and home
court advantage of the LA schools,
the Cardinal will have to come out
fierce from the start — something
they haven't done in recent games.
Against California and ASU this
month, Stanford started softly. Ihe
Sun Devils even held the lead until
the last 10 minutes when the Cardi
nal rallied to an 84-78 victory.
"I think it's always been a prob
lem for Stanford," Wiggins said.
"Everyone always perceives us as
the nice team, or the nice girls from
Stanford that aren't going to push
them around ... I think it's all about
getting that mentality — you really
just have to have that Tm-going to
push you-back' mentality, and I
think we're working all the time on
it."
In an effort to improve and hope
fully bring out the squad's aggres
sion, VanDerveer brought in male
players to this week's practice.
" llicy'rc a reminder that the
game can be played quicker, that we
need to be more aggressive, and that
we need to box people out." Van-
Derveer said.
Reentering the fold this weekend
is sophomore guard Cissy Pierce,
who served a two-game suspension
for missing practice last week. Van-
Derveer confirmed she is ready to
play.
"Cissy's really working hard in
practice, and she's really pushing us
and showing that she really wants to
be a part of the team -it's great to
have her back and playing hard for
us." Wiggins said.
Pierce's presence and the recent
return of junior center Kristen Newl
in prepare the Cardinal to mount a
potent attack in LA this weekend.
"If we are the aggressor, it's not
going to be about them." Wiggins
said."lt's going to be about what we
do on our team."

I'lie ( aidiiml are coining oj) oj (i tough home win against No. 15 Arizona State at home. The win
should provide them n ith some momentum as they take on a solid No. 23 USC team this weekend.
