## Card begin part two of Pac-10 play 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Having finished their first round of
Pacific-10 Conference competition with
an 8-1 record, the Cardinal head into the
second half of the conference season with
matches against UCLA and Southern
California this weekend.

The Cardinal defeated both
teams easily a month ago, 91-68 and

77-56, respectively, but playing on
the Los Angeles schools' home
courts this time could prove a dif
ferent story.
"When you've beaten a team al
ready in the season, I think it gives

them a lot of extra motivation,"
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "It's just going to be a
very challenging weekend for us. This
is probably the toughest road trip we
have, with two really tough games."
UCLA (10-8, 5-4) presents an
offensive threat to the Cardinal to
morrow night, having the No. 2 scor
ing offense in the Pac-10. Although
Stanford is No. 1 in the conference, it
has been relying mostly on the scor
ing efforts of three players: sopho
more guard Candice Wiggins, junior
center Brooke Smith and junior guard

Krista Rappahahn, who accounted for
more than two-thirds of Stanford's total
in three of the past four games.
ITie Bruins, on the other hand, have
four players averaging over 10 points per
game, including the No. 2 scorer in the
conference, senior guard Lisa Willis, who
averages 17.9 points.
"UCLA's got some great perimeter
players; there's some great talent, so
that'll he a good game just because
they're capable of playing really well,"
Smith said.
Posing an even greater threat, howev
er, are the Women of Troy on Sunday.

Pac-10 Rundown
How Stanford women's
basketball stands in the
division
By the Numbers
Stats for best women's
team in the Pac-10
Kobe's 81-point outburst was the
most incredible thing I have ever
seen. Still, the man traded Shaq. He
single-handedly voted off, excom
municated, banished, punked the
most dominant player in the NBA.
That's like Michael kicking out Scot
ty, Magic dumping Kareem or Bird
axing McHale. You just don't do it.
Hell, Kobe could score 100 points
a game, but he'll still be watching
Shaq in the conference finals on TV
when his team is swept in the first
round of the playoffs.
Law 3: Jerry West has a magic
wand.
We all knew "The Logo" is a ge
nius executive. Still, no one, includ
ing myself,thought that the Grizzlies
could make the playoffs. 1 mean,
every move West makes works.
Hubie Brown retires. Fine, where's
Mike Fratello? Bonzi Wells and
Jason Williams are being egocentric
losers. Just replace them with Bobby
Jackson and Eddie Jones. Every
thing this man touches turns to gold.
Law 4: The pure point guard is
starting to return.
Ah, basketball purists will like
this one. After years and years of
getting stuck with shoot-first point
guards like Stephon Marbury. Steve
Francis and Baron Davis, we're
starting to see some pass-first play
ers star in the league. Nash and Jason
Kidd obviously top the list of pure
points. Reformed shoot-first guys
like Tony Parker and Chauncey
Billups are also there.
Soon, youngsters Shaun Liv
ingston, Chris Paul and Deron
Williams will be added to the list.
And teams with extreme ball-hog
ging point guards have been either
mediocre or downright awful this
season. It pays to have the pure
point.
Law 5: Dwayne Wade is one of
those quiet but deadly scorers.
Wade may seem extremely
flashy, but when I watched the guy
live, I realized he's pretty fundamen
tal. A lot of mid-range shots and
nifty drives to the hoop, but he's un
like a lot of NBA players in that he
doesn't hold the ball for 10 seconds
before making a decision.
At the end of the game, my room
mate James said. "You know. Wade
didn't really do anything today." I
agreed. But then, a quick glance at
the scoreboard showed us that Wade
had scored 30. Turns out James was
asleep for part of the game, but the
point is still valid.
Law 6: The Clippers are the best
team in Los Angeles.
Note:'lliis column is not designed
to bash the Lakers, though I admit
that I do get some perverse pleasure
from it. Still, the Clippers are good.
Very good.
They have some young, develop
ing players like Chris Wilcox and
Livingston, balanced by veterans
Sam Cassell, Cuttino Mobley and
Elton Brand, who has been amazing
this season. The X-Factor is Chris
"Caveman" Kaman. Ihe guy is so
underrated; he rebounds and has a
deceptively soft touch around the
rim.
Law 7: Dwight Howard is a beast.
I m expecting 20-10 and smother
ing defense from this kid as he be
comes one of the NBA's dominant
big men. When I watch him and
Chris Bosh of Toronto, I see
glimpses of the big men who domi
nated the NBA in the past.
Law 8: Greg Oden is a beast.
Alright, he's not in the NBA, and
I hate to repeat the word beast, but 1
saw him play on TV last week. First,
he's huge. I can't believe he's only 17
years old. Second, he's an athletic
defender who scares you with his
shot-blocking ability. Third, he
played unselfishly and seems to play
smart. Oden's development could
be good news for those missing the
presence of the dominant center.
Law 9: College coaches can 't han
dle the NBA. This one's directed to
our favorite college coach in the
NBA.
Mike Montgomery's in a tough
spot. His team has struggled recent
ly. and it looks like he's not having
any fun in the pros. In fact, it never
really did look like he was having
fun at Stanford, but at least he
looked comfortable on the Farm. It
looks increasingly like he could be
gone at the end of the season.
Law 10: Ihe Spurs will reign as
NBA champs.
As I predicted at the beginning of
the season, San Antonio should re
peat its title. The team has more
depth than last year, and Parker is
blossoming into a floor general. De
troit's been incredible so far. but 1
think the Pistons need a gunner off
the bench before they can beat San
Antonio.
