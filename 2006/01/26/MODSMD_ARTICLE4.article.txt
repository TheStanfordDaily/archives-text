## Card begin part two of Pac-10 play 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Having finished their first round of
Pacific-10 Conference competition with
an 8-1 record, the Cardinal head into the
second half of the conference season with
matches against UCLA and Southern
California this weekend.

The Cardinal defeated both
teams easily a month ago, 91-68 and

77-56, respectively, but playing on
the Los Angeles schools' home
courts this time could prove a dif
ferent story.
"When you've beaten a team al
ready in the season, I think it gives

them a lot of extra motivation,"
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "It's just going to be a
very challenging weekend for us. This
is probably the toughest road trip we
have, with two really tough games."
UCLA (10-8, 5-4) presents an
offensive threat to the Cardinal to
morrow night, having the No. 2 scor
ing offense in the Pac-10. Although
Stanford is No. 1 in the conference, it
has been relying mostly on the scor
ing efforts of three players: sopho
more guard Candice Wiggins, junior
center Brooke Smith and junior guard

Krista Rappahahn, who accounted for
more than two-thirds of Stanford's total
in three of the past four games.
ITie Bruins, on the other hand, have
four players averaging over 10 points per
game, including the No. 2 scorer in the
conference, senior guard Lisa Willis, who
averages 17.9 points.
"UCLA's got some great perimeter
players; there's some great talent, so
that'll he a good game just because
they're capable of playing really well,"
Smith said.
Posing an even greater threat, howev
er, are the Women of Troy on Sunday.
