# Road to recovery not an easy one for junior Newlin
## Cardinal center trying to get back to early-season form 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
To a casual Stanford basketball
fan, it looked like things were start
ing to come easy to junior forward
Kristen Newlin.
She started the season averag
ing a double-double (12.3 points
and 10.3 rebounds per game) as a
key low-block player for the Cardi
nal. She even recorded a breakout

game against then No. 2 Tennessee on Dec. 4 with
a team-high 20 points and 10 rebounds.
But what made her early season numbers even
more impressive was that for the three weeks
leading up to the Dec. 4 game, Newlin was playing
through pain during the best games of her colle
giate career.
"[The injury] wasn't from just one fall or im
pact " Newlin said. "I had a sharp pain in my leg
that progressively got worse. I finally got it
checked out a week after the game and realized it

BACK IN
ACTION
Kristen Newlin
After averaging 12.3
points and 10.8 re
bounds per game, junior
center Kristen Newlin
was lost for eight games
with a stress fracture in
her femur. She is just now
reestablishing her pres
ence on the court.

was a stress fracture in my left
femur and that I needed to stay off
of it."
For the next four and a half
weeks, Newlin was forced to sit on
the bench and wait as her team
struggled to find itself. It was espe
cially difficult as the Cardinal bot
tomed out with back-to-back road
losses, including a loss to Boston
College in which they were out-re
bounded 42-32. Before the injury,
Newlin was Stanford's leading re
bounder.
"It was tough to watch," Newlin
said. "But [the injury] was some
thing I couldn't control, so I tried
not to dwell on it a lot and tried to
help out my team the best way I

knew how."
Unable to bear any weight on the leg, Newlin
turned to bicycle workouts and eventually an un
derwater treadmill to maintain her aerobic condi
tioning with minimal stress. But. as she and the
coaches have learned, there was still a fair amount
that was lost.
"Nothing can replace running on the court,so I
really noticed it when I came back." Newlin said.

Junior forward Kristen Newlin was averaging a double-double befor she was
forced out of the lineup with a stress fracture.
"I wasn't in the kind of shape I needed to be."
Meanwhile, the young Cardinal stinted t<>
learn new roles and develop chemistry without
Newlin as they rattled off four straight confer
ence victories.
"We've improved so much in a month because
Rosalyn [Gold-OnwudeJ has improved a lot.and
Candice j Wiggins] is playing better." head coach
Tara VanDerveer said. "And Krista Rappahalui.
[the difference between] where she was last veai
to where she is this year is night and day."
The Cardinal now face a dilemma: they need
to develop Newlin back to the level she was at be
fore the injury without upsetting the balance that
has developed since.
'ITie coaching staff originally brought Newlin
back in a starting role against California on Jan.
14 but is now taking a more conservative ap
proach to phasing her back onto the coui t. In are
serve role, she adds a layer of depth down low and
puts another player into a depleted rotation that

sometimes involves only live or six players.
I lei biggest contiibntion right now is to give
lis ;i low Noel, piesence when Biooke isn't in the
game. Van I >erveersaid."( )bviously, ideally both
Brooke and Kristen wonlil be plaving together.
I'm livi'ig to balance that a little bit. Ihe first
Jstepl is |to| give Hrooke a little lest.give lis that
inside presence and then work together and
shaie it."
Since her return, Newlin is averaging 6.3
points and 4.b rebounds in three games.
"I think in some ways she's pressing a little bit,"
VanDerveer siiicl "She did much better against
Ari/ona State, but there were times where she
vv is mat ing moves that she was scoring on earlier
in the season. It will come back with practice."
Despite the physical transition back 011 the
comt. Newlin leels like she is still on the same
mental page as the test of the team.
" Ihe team never forgot about me," Newlin
said. "I vv us with them even practice and every

Newlin back in the rotation after injury

game. They've been really supportive now that
I've come back, helping me find my role again.
Mi inging me back to the level I was at could take
awhile, but they're glad to have me back, and I'm
glad to be back."
And the coaching staff feels that the days
when the rust will come off and Newlin will begin
to dominate again are coming sooner rather than
later.
"| I ler skills arc J there, there's no doubt." Van-
Derveer said. "In my mind, it's like riding a bicy
cle. You might wobble a little bit at the beginning,
but you just get back on there, and once you learn,
she can do the things that we need her to do.
"We remember where Kristen was when she
went out." VenDerveer added. "If she can get a
|double double J against Tennessee's big post
players, then she can get it against anybody we
plav against.That's what I think she's capable of,
so if she does it this weekend then that would be
great"
