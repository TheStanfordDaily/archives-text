# Road to recovery not an easy one for junior Newlin
## Cardinal center trying to get back to early-season form 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
To a casual Stanford basketball
fan, it looked like things were start
ing to come easy to junior forward
Kristen Newlin.
She started the season averag
ing a double-double (12.3 points
and 10.3 rebounds per game) as a
key low-block player for the Cardi
nal. She even recorded a breakout

game against then No. 2 Tennessee on Dec. 4 with
a team-high 20 points and 10 rebounds.
But what made her early season numbers even
more impressive was that for the three weeks
leading up to the Dec. 4 game, Newlin was playing
through pain during the best games of her colle
giate career.
"[The injury] wasn't from just one fall or im
pact " Newlin said. "I had a sharp pain in my leg
that progressively got worse. I finally got it

BACK IN
ACTION
Kristen Newlin
After averaging 12.3
points and 10.8 re
bounds per game, junior
center Kristen Newlin
was lost for eight games
with a stress fracture in
her femur. She is just now

was a stress fracture in my left
femur and that I needed to stay off
of it."
For the next four and a half
weeks, Newlin was forced to sit on
the bench and wait as her team
struggled to find itself. It was espe
cially difficult as the Cardinal bot
tomed out with back-to-back road
losses, including a loss to Boston
College in which they were out-re
bounded 42-32. Before the injury,
Newlin was Stanford's leading re
bounder.
"It was tough to watch," Newlin
said. "But [the injury] was some
thing I couldn't control, so I tried
not to dwell on it a lot and tried to
help out my team the best way I

knew how."
Unable to bear any weight on the leg, Newlin
turned to bicycle workouts and eventually an un
derwater treadmill to maintain her aerobic condi
tioning with minimal stress. But. as she and the
coaches have learned, there was still a fair amount
that was lost.
"Nothing can replace running on the court,so I
really noticed it when I came back." Newlin said.
