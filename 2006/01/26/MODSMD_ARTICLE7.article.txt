## Palestinian election shakes fragile peace 
### RAVI NESSMAN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) — Hamas fared
better than expected in Palestinian elections Wednes
day, exit polls showed, raising the prospect that the rul
ing Fatah Party might be forced to form a coalition with
the Islamic militant group that calls for Israel's de
struction. The outcome could put Mideast peacekeep
ing at risk.
Fatah had said before the first parliamentary contest
in a decade that it would rather team with small parties
than join forces with Hamas, which has carried out
dozens of terror attacks against the Jewish state and
whose presence in the government would likely cause
friction with Israel, the US. and Europe.
But with the militants making a strong showing in
their first legislative run, Fatah would need the backing
of an array of smaller parties to cobble together a gov
ernment. Because some of the smaller parties have ties
with Hamas, Fatah might not be able to court enough of
them to form a coalition firm enough to survive the
Palestinians' domestic challenges — and face Israel
again at the negotiating table.
An exit poll by Bir Zeit University in Ramallah
showed Fatah winning 63 seats in the 132-member par
liament with 46.4 percent of the vote and Hamas taking
58 seats with 39.5 percent. Smaller parties received 11
seats, according to the poll of B,(XM) voters in 232 polling
stations. The poll had a one-seat margin of error.
A second survey showed Fatah beating Hamas 42 per
cent to 35 percent, or 58 seats to 53. Official results are
due Thursday.
"Neither Fatah or Hamas can form the Cabinet on its
own, so they need to get into a coalition with other fac
tions or with each other," said pollster Khalil Shikaki,
who carried out the second survey.
Saeb Erekat, a Palestinian Authority negotiator who
won re-election to parliament in his West Bank home
town of Jericho, indicated that options were open.
"It's premature to speak now about the shape and form
of the Cabinet," he told The Associated Press, "but I can
tell you that this will be the beginning of a new Palestin
ian political life, a new horizon."
Before the election, pollsters said the race was too
close to call. Hamas made a stronger showing than the 30
percent that many pollsters expected.

The election was the Palestinians' first truly competi
tive vote, and officials hoped it would help cement
democracy in the post-Yasser Arafat era. But it also gave
unprecedented clout to Hamas, which carried out dozens
of suicide bombings against Israel and is listed as a terror
group by the United States and European Union.
The strong showing by Hamas reflected popular discon
tent with Fatah over corruption, mismanagement and in
creasing lawlessness.
After voting ended. President Bush said Washington
would not deal with Hamas unless it renounced violence
against Israel. "Not until you renounce your desire to de
stroy Israel will we deal with you," he said in an interview
with The Wall Street Journal.
The election will usher in a new parliament and Cab
inet. but Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, who was
elected president last year, will remain head of the Pales
tinian Authority regardless of the results.
In Gaza City, Fatah loyalists fired rifles out of car win
dows. sounded their horns and waved the yellow flag of

their movement as they drove around the streets after
getting word of the exit polls.
"Even though this is not the official result we have to
celebrate " said 22-year-old Omar Abdel A1 Raouf, wav
ing an assault rifle from his car window. "The winner is
the Palestinian people."
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians flooded
polling stations throughout the West Bank and Gaza
Strip fora vote to determine how Palestinians wanted to
be governed and whether they would pursue negotia
tions or confrontation with Israel.
Long lines formed at polling stations, and 77.7 percent
of 1.3 million eligible voters cast ballots. Under a com
promise with Israel, some Arabs in east Jerusalem were
allowed to cast absentee ballots at post offices in the dis
puted city, and voting was extended there by two hours
because postal workers were slow.
Routine power cuts in the Gaza Strip town of Khan
Younis forced election workers to count ballots by can
dlelight.
