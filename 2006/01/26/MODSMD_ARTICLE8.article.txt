# Mine tragedy inquiry stalled
## Investigators from mining union turned away by coal company

MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) â€” Flans to begin
gathering evidence inside the Sago Mine fell apart
Wednesday when International Coal Group Inc. re
fused to let members of the United Mine Workers of
America accompany state and federal investigators un
derground.
The federal Mine Safety and Health Administration,
which had already recognized the union as the legal rep
resentative for several workers at the nonunion mine,
went to U.S. District Court in Elkins seeking an order to
grant the union access.The hearing was scheduled to re
sume Thursday.
The union's involvement has been a point of con
tention for nearly two weeks. More than 90 percent of
ICG's miners are being represented not by the UMWA
but by three co-workers.
"Some of the Sago miners requested that the United
Mine Workers be their representatives for the purposes
of this investigation, and they have a right to be there,"
said Ed Clair, associate solicitor for Mine Safety and
Health. "Together, the state and MSHA made a com
mitment to the families that we would conduct a fair,
open investigation, and we decided we needed to take
this extraordinary step to keep that commitment."
The company, meanwhile, accused the federal
agency of yielding to the union's political influence and
violating federal law by refusing to share the identities
of the union-represented workers. ICG has said it will
not punish those workers but wants to verify their em
ployment.
"International Coal Group strongly objects to the
transparent attempts by UMWA leadership to use the
Sago accident as an opportunity to advance their or
ganizing efforts and rally their political influence,"
President Ben Hatfield said. "Such conduct is wholly
inappropriate and disrespectful of the tragic circum
stances."
State and federal investigators had hoped to enter
the mine Wednesday, more than three weeks after an
explosion that left 12 men dead.
