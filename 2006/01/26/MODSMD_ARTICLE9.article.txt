## New OSP location a success "I believe the small size of the group is very advantageous" — Prof. Timothy Stanton 
### ARAM HUR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's Bing Overseas Studies Pro
gram may have to add another branch in
South Africa, as the one-time pilot Cape
Town program already has students and fac
ulty deeming it a success only two weeks in.
While previous overseas seminars have been
held there, this is the first and only time that
the OSP has offered a full program in affilia
tion with the University of Cape Town.
"The Center for African Studies affiliated
faculty have been advocating for an overseas
program in Africa for years, as this has been
the only continent not represented in BOSP

programming," said Prof. Timothy Stanton,
senior lecturer in the School of Medicine,
who also spearheaded the program's cre
ation. While the BOSP roster has estab
lished programs in various parts of Europe,
South America, Australia and Asia, it lacked
opportunities in Africa.
The 10-week program focuses on studies
of community reconstruction in the post
apartheid country and public health condi
tions. While these are issues that can clearly
be studied in the States, junior and current
participant Rebecca Pratt stressed the im
portance of being in South Africa.
"It is another experience entirely to be
able to witness the effects of disease and

poverty and the political and community
mechanisms implemented to contain and al
leviate these problems," she said. While ad
mitting that it has only been two weeks into
the program, Pratt said she felt the program
was going to be enriching, being both aca
demically and personally challenging.
Pratt is one of 15 currently in the program.
While the size of the student body is relative
ly small compared to the more established
BOSP options, Stanton praised the benefits
of the group's size.
"I believe the small size of the group is
very advantageous for students and the in
volved faculty" he said. "We just returned
from a field trip to Johannesburg, which en

abled me and my wife to get to know the stu
dents on a personal basis, which will be most
beneficial to our working togethec in class
and on the research projects."
The program currently includes three
classes: "Community Development and Re
construction." "History and Politics of South
Africa" and "Public Health and Primary
Health Care in a Changing Community Con
text." A glance at the course titles shows that,
while the program was originally designed
for students interested in South Africa, it by
no means is limited only to that region. As
the coursework ranges from political science
to public health, the program has attracted
students from diverse majors like human bi

ologv. economics and Science, technology,
and society to mention a few.
In addition to academics, the program of
fers a unique edge of what Pratt called serv
ice learning — the coupling of community
service with coursework. Each student inter
acts with the community through weekly vol
unteer service at organizations centered in
neighboring townships. According to Pratt,
some options include helping AIDS orphans,
working at HIV testing clinics and volunteer
ing with the elderly.
"The philosophy behind this program is
that service learning is an effective way to en
gage students in the learning process by in
tegrating academia and community serv
ice," she said.
Students will also work on a communi
ty research project in conjunction with the
University of Cape Town.The institution is
in the process of opening clinics in nearby
townships, where their medical students
will be doing rotations. Stanford students

get to play an essential part in this first
time effort by amassing information on
the health status of township residents.
"Our role in their program will he to
conduct health assessments so that the
clinics will know what health needs they
should target," Pratt said. "We are just
starting this process, and our main mode
for data gathering will be interviewing
members of the community."
However, apart from its abounding op
portunities, the program faces some prac
tical difficulties as well. One is the chal
lenge posed by scheduling. According to
Stanton.South African university students

are on holiday until mid-February, which
does not allow for as much interaction
with the student life at the University of
Cape Town.
While there is no official word from the
OSP office about solidifying the program
into an annual offering, Pratt said it should
strongly consider doing so.
"I believe that it is important to have a
program in Africa and an abroad program
for people thinking of going into public
policy or health care," she said. "I also
think that this model of service learning is
effective. I'm in full support of the pro
eram."\
