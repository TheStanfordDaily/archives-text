Leonard Susskind
Thursday, February 2, 7:30 p.m.
E Leonard Susskind, widely regarded
as the father of string theory, posits
a revolutionary twist to his own
ideas in The Cosmic Landscape
(Little, Brown and Company),
Susskind suggests that String
Theory's myriad solutions represent
"pocket universes" within an overall
"megaverse" of gigantic proportions.
The observable universe, therefore,
Leonard j s actually just a tiny island in a
Susskind vastly bigger sea of reality. How is it,
then, that the corner of this land
scape that we inliabit is so cunningly designed? The
answer he presents is: we couldn't exist otherwise! Hear
Susskind as he explores tliis question and explains the
Anthropic Principle.

~T Pulitzer Prize-winning and best
selling author Taylor Branch con
cludes his magnificent history of
t lljllfe 40. the civil rights movement and
2 Martin Luther King's heroic role at
the center of it in AT CANAAN'S
EDGE: America in the King
Years, 1965-68 (Simon & Schuster,
jwf : a February 1,2006). As Branch's dra
nnfrt », ..1 ma ti c account demonstrates. King
Taylor Branch attained a stature akin to that of
Lincoln - a commanding, prophetic,
and sanctified figure who not only changed the legal
and political structure of the nation and led a victori
ous struggle for African-American equality, but lifted
the patriotic spirit of the entire United States toward
our defining national purpose - freedom. AT
CANAAN'S EDGE can be read independently of its
two preceding volumes, but continues the
Shakespearean epic begun in Parting the Waters (for
which Branch won the Pulitzer Prize and the National
Book Critics Circle Award) and Pillar of Fire, both
New York Times bestsellers.
