# China's Internet censorship rises
## Google agrees to filter Web searches made in China for content 
### CHRISTOPHER BODEEN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
(AP) — Google's decision to filter sensitive topics from
Web searches in China is a major triumph for the regime's
campaign to have the Internet censor itself, observers said
Thursday, amid mounting criticism of the move.
However, scholars who study the Internet in China
said free speech advocates still had room for optimism.
While China's grip on Web content appears to be tight
ening, communist authorities can't stop the overall
trend toward access to more information and greater
transparency, they said.
Mountain View, Calif.-based Google Inc. said its de
cision to launch a sanitized version of its famed search
engine using China's ".cn" suffix was aimed at reaching
China's massive Internet audience. It defended the
move as a trade-off.
The new site, launched on Wednesday, omits inde
pendent Web sites from searches about human rights,
Tibet and other topics sensitive to Beijing. Instead users
are directed only to Web sites espousing the govern
ment's views on such issues.
One prominent human rights advocate, U.S. Con
gressman Chris Smith, said it was "astounding" that
Google, whose company motto is "Don't Be Evil," would
cooperate with such censorship "just to make a buck."
"Many Chinese have suffered imprisonment and
torture in the service of truth — and now Google is col
laborating with their persecutors." said Smith, who has
called for legal sanctions against US. technology com
panies that aid Chinese Web censorship.
Amnesty International said such cooperation clear
ly curtailed freedom of expression and information,
calling Google's policy "short-sighted."
"Agreements between global corporations and the
Chinese authorities have entrenched Internet censor
ship as the norm in China," the group's secretary gener
al, Irene Khan.said from the World Economic Forum in
Davos, Switzerland.
Despite the criticism, Google may have little cause
for worry in the long-run. Similar complaints against
Yahoo! and Microsoft Corp.'s MSN.com for submitting
to China's censorship rules have so far failed to gel into
any serious consumer or legal action against them.
