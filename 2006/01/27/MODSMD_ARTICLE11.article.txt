## Pizza My Pineapple 
### 
Applewood Pizza
1001 El Camino Real, Menlo Park
Personal pizza $6.75,
Large pizza $1 8.75

It is the epitome of pizza parlors. It's
noisy, crowded and smells greasy. The
tables are full of families with gurgling
toddlers tipping over their parents' pitch
ers of beer and soda. We ask for a table.
The employee gives us a strange
look. "You have to get your own. Just
wait until someone is done eating."
"The vulture system," I remark to
Adam. "Very interesting."
We lurk awkwardly around a table
whose diners look to be finishing their
pizza.They leave, and we sit down quick
ly before any else can take our hard
earned spot. An employee trips over us
trying to wipe away the pizza grease.
As we sit down, I take a look around
the restaurant. It is filled with the oblig
atory dark-wood booths and neon beer
logo signs. A bar in the back sits under a
TV broadcasting ESPN. One table is full
of Stanford grad students, but most
spots are occupied by young families.
Across the aisle from us, a preschool
age boy is playing with an impressive
collection of plastic lizards.
We turn our attention to the menu,
and my impressions of Applewood im
prove slightly.The pizzas are creative, but
not so weird as to turn off potential din
ers. Roughly half of the pizzas are named
after cities or geographical regions. Aca
pulco pizza has ground beef, salsa and
chilies. Scandinavian pizza has smoked
salmon and capers. There are also some
more local options. Los Altos pizza has
BBQ chicken, red onions, pesto and
tomatoes. Menlo Combo has pepperoni,
salami, Italian sausage and mushrooms.
Apparently, no one in our group
wants a geographical region-themed
pizza. Betsy and I decide to split a medi
um Margherita pizza. Ashley wants
Hawaiian but no one else does, so she
gets a personal pizza. Adam and Ricky
are indecisive, so they decide to pick
their own toppings. This quickly turns
into the "what is the grossest combina
tion we can come up with" game.
"Prawns and pineapple!"
"Anchovies and pineapple!"
"Eggplant and pineapple!"
"Why does pineapple add another
dimension of weirdness to everything?"
Adam wonders.
Eventually,they decide on pepperoni
and mushroom — without pineapple.
We place our orders and eagerly an
ticipate our pizza. Adam notices the
ceiling paint job. It's painted rather in
congruously, and resembles a pale blue
sky with fluffy clouds.The stucco is peel
ing off under one cloud, producing a
jagged — and frightening — effect.
Adam is Iaughing:"Cumulus...cumu
lus... cumulus... Oh my god!"
We wait for our numbers to be called
so we can go grab our pizzas. But they're
not called in any logical order.
"What if there was a restaurant
where they assigned numbers from a
random number generator?" someone
suggests.
"No," Betsy says. "A math-themed
cafe where the numbers can only be
primes!"
Ashley has a better idea: "I think
they should call out words instead of
numbers."
Luckily, our pizza is ready before we
can think of any more ideas. We carry
the steaming pies back to our table. The
delicious smell brings my opinion of
Applewood up another notch. I bite
into a slice. The crust is thick and light
and golden brown.The basil pesto com
plements the three cheeses perfectly. I
am momentarily transported out of the
crowded pizza parlor, into bliss.
A bit later, Bianca brings me back to
the moment. She is alleviating her bore
dom by emptying the table's salt shaker
onto her plate.
This seems to be our cue to leave.
We finish our pizzas and I bid the
squalling toddlers of Applewood a re
spectful farewell.
THE VERDICT
I'm not a big fan of the pizza parlor ex
perience. Still, this restaurant offers the
best pizza I've had in a while. I would get
take-out from Applewood any day.
