# Drive to Drink
## Take the highways (and the "Sideways") to Napa 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS EDITOR IN CHIEF 
2 here are some places in the world so beautiful they always
leave you wondering how and when you'll get back. Lucky
for us, California has its fair share of geographical gems —
al within a two hour drive of the Stanford campus. San
Francisco is too often the default for students looking for fun on
a lazy weekend. Meanwhile, the Napa Valley sits just northeast
of the city, offering breathtaking sights, affordable accommo-

dations and some of the most famous wineries on
the planet.

Dotted with small sleepy towns like
Sonoma, Calistoga and St. Helena, the
Valley is home to much more than grapes
and cows, but also some of the best shop
ping and unique attractions in Northern
California. So if you're feeling adventur
ous, let this article be your guide. 1 guar
antee, if you make the trip, Napa will be
come one of those college memories
you'll carry with you for years to come.
Despite its wealth of other features.

the Napa Valley is universally known
for its expert winemaking. It's pitch
perfect climate and culture converge to
make it an idyllic environment for rows
upon rows of grape vines. Driving
through the rolling hills that hug the val
ley, the signs you pass read like a who's
who for even an inexperienced wine
drinker: Beringer, Mondavi, Sebastiani.

Upon my first wine-tasting trek

through the region, I had no idea how easy
it was to go tasting. It seems almost counter
intuitive that you can just drive up to any one
of these sprawling estates, walk right in to a
full bar serviced by people who obviously love
iheir jobs (who could they not?) and order from
i full menu of different wines, including many

you'll never find in your local grocery store.
Don't be intimidated if you know nothing
about wine.To generalize, most wine pourers at these
tasting rooms love nothing more than sharing their

vast amount of knowledge with the customers who pass
through. They'll fill you in on the fine distinctions, which
wine to order with what.They'll even give you pointers on

how to look like a wine aficionado when you're out with
friends (you know, the whole swirl and inhale number you
iaw in "Sideways").The more places you stop the more you'll
earn not only about the differences between a good or bad

wine, but also about how it's made and the delicate interplay be
tween the weather, the land and technique that makes a wine
truly unique.
After a few stops you'll begin to detect the subtle flavors that
distinguish one Cabernet Sauvignon from another. Like any
thing else it takes practice. Most wineries will present you with a
tasting menu off of which you can select five wines to taste for
something like $5 to $7. After getting your fill at the counter, re
member to wait a little while before getting back in the car. Why
not take a walk around the fields or through the cellar? Some
places even have tours where they walk you through the process
that goes into a bottle of wine.
If it's your first wine-tasting expedition, 1 have several recom
mendations. The Imagery Estate Winery, owned by Benziger.has
one of the friendliest and most helpful staffs I've encountered.
Not only did our pourer sneak us dark chocolate to accentuate
the flavors in the port we were testing, but he taught us a great
deal about the history of Benziger itself.The Imagery Estate also

includes an art gallery for pleasant perusal.
Chateu St. Jean, located close to Imagery, should also be on
your list of stops. Surrounded by gardens and sloping vineyards,
it is one of those rare places that make you wonder why you
aren't spending your entire life there. The staff was also very
helpful and took great delight in educating novices.
The third must-see winery is Domaine Carneros, located just
outside Sonoma. As you drive down the Carneros Highway
you'll see the stunning chateau perched on a hill overlooking
vineyards for miles in all directions. This location, with its rich
Tattinger-family history, specializes almost exclusively in North
ern California sparkling wine (what we might off-handedly refer
to as champagne). Not only is the selection at this site delicious,
but it's also home to one of the most fascinating tours around.
Sparkling wine is a tricky thing to manufacture, requiring the cu
mulative knowledge of centuries of wine-makers (as it turns out,
mostly women — even back in France when the bubbly-libation
first emerged).
But even if you're under the legal drinking age. there's plenty
waiting for you in the Napa Valley. Sonoma, perhaps the most
charming of the places to visit, combines the appeal of small
town America (complete with an old-style movie theater and a
Cheese Factory serving up the best darn hamburgers you'll ever
eat) with high artistic and culinary standards. Many artists in all
media have chosen to live in or near this quiet Mecca.They come
out several times a year to showcase their work at various festi
vals, events and shows.
For instance, the weekend of Feb. 4 and 5. galleries through
out the Napa Valley will be throwing parties to showcase a
Weekend of Fine Art, part of the annual Napa Mustard Festival.
The festival will continue on Feb. 11 when all restaurants and
wineries in St. Helena bring out their best for visitors and
tourists. For you jazz fans, Calistoga will be hosting Mustard,
Mud and Music Jazz Festival on March 11. To find out more
about the dozens of events included in the festival, jvisit

tourist information and the best deals on where to stay and eat.
While it is definitely possible to take in the wonders of this region
in a single day, it would also be a great opportunity to spend a re
laxing weekend between midterms and finals. There are plenty
of small motels and bed and breakfasts scattered throughout the
valley that should fit your thin student budget.
As a side note, one of the best things about a trip into the heart
of the Napa Valley can be how you choose to get there. There are
several routes to choose from, and anyone else you ask will prob
ably recommend that you first cross the Dumbarton Bridge and
then wind your way north through the East Bay.This may be the
shorter trip, but if you're on vacation, then why not take in the
scenery?
If you're leaving on a Saturday, the best time to go is around
3 p.m. to avoid traffic. From campus, get on Interstate-280 going
north. Eventually it will turn into 19th Avenue going through San
Francisco. Here you might run into traffic, but it probably won't
be too bad in the early afternoon. Follow 19th Avenue all the way
past Golden Gate Park to the Golden Gate Bridge. On a clear
day you'll be able to see most of Sausalito, Alcatraz, the Bay
Bridge and the dazzling cityscape (which by the time you get
there should be all aglow with the sinking sunlight).
After your cross the bridge (a mandatory experience for all
Stanford students), you'll stay on Highway-101 until you see
signs for Napa and you can follow them on to your destination
through Marin andTiburon.
So instead of wondering which house party to drag yourself to
this Saturday night, or confining yourself to hours of reading
(even if you probably should), pile in a car with your most adven
turous friends and head north. Hopefully it will be only your first
of many trips to the Valley of the Moon.
