# Huck in the Muck: Lake Lag, Ahoy!
## 
### JESSAMYN EDRA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Shortly after I started jogging around Lake
Lag in the early morning mist, 1 stopped short
— the lake actually had water in it! And ducks,
too!
Surely a hallucination. I thought. I had
never seen Lake Lag as anything but a dry pit,
and 1 have more than once chuckled to myself
over the misnomer — in Spanish. Lake Lagu
nita literally means "Lake Little Lake."
Though my run that morning was not too
fun, it inspired a great rafting adventure on the
lake that perhaps rivaled Huckleberry Finn's.
For the majority of the year. Lake Lag's sta
tus as a rocky crater inspires many a myth. But
the Stanford Visitor's Guide reveals a truth
about the lakebed — it's a breeding ground for
endangered tiger salamanders. In fact, the Uni
versity no longer holds the pre-Big Game bon
fire there to protect these quirky creatures.
The salamanders arc an endangered
species because of "habitat loss due to agricul
ture and urbanization, excessive use of pesti

cidcs and the introduction of fish." according
to the Northern Prairie Wildlife Research
Center's Web site.
Endangered salamanders or not, there is
nothing quite like having a filled lake on campus.
As with most important things in Stanford
culture, there exists a "Fill Lake Lag" interest
group on Facehook.com, with 491 members
and three groupies. As stated on their site, the
group collected 394 signatures in early 2005 to
urge the University to put water in the lake.
"The collective spiritual health of the Uni
versity demands that the lake be filled lest we
continue to perpetuate a pervasive aura of dis
honesty and iniquity that stems from the
crushing weight of the vast emptiness that is
the giant ditch behind Roble Hall," a portion
of the group's Web site says.
Winter rains and runoff from the San Fran
cisco Creek usually fill the lake in time for
spring quarter. And when the season is right,
the Athletics Department even offers wind
surfing lessons.
If there is not enough rain, then there is no
lake.

When there is enough rain. Stanford stu
dents must take advantage of it. There's no
guarantee that it will stay full. So before it's
too late, put on some old clothes and go ex
plore Lake Lag!
"The lake is awesome!" exclaims freshman
Daisy Morin. "It's nice to get out of the dorm
on the weekend and play in the lake."
Grass has sprouted on the bank's edges,
and though there is still a fair amount of rocks
and mud around. Lake Lag beckons many
dorm residents.
Still, there is an issue of cleanliness.
"If you can get over the fact that it is a
cesspool — teeming with bacteria, mosquitoes
and who knows what else — it's really rather
nice to look at," quips freshman Zach Nevin.
But I call on you to do more than just look
— Lake Lag is a great place to have a picnic,
skip rocks, walk around with a bunch of
friends, take photos or simply study.
For the very brave, there is a raft, which sits
anywhere its previous crew has seen fit to dock
it. Made up of wooden planks with a Styrofoam
base, the raft is about four-feet-by-four-feet and

able to carry two or three people.
For freshman Amy Dinh and friends, the
raft provided a mere starting point.
"Along with the raft, we also had three pool
lounges,so it was like a whole FroSoCoan fleet
on the lake," Dinh says. "At first, people were
worried about getting wet until one of our
dorm mates just charged into the water."
Dinh adds that after that, it was a free-for
all
"It was wet and dirty...good times," she says.
In addition to giving the raft a whirl, fresh
man Adam Cole splashed around in the shal
lows.
"I had trouble deciding which was more dan
gerous — wading in the putrid lake or setting
foot on the tetanus-breeding ground we called a
raft," he says."So 1 played it safe and tried both."
And sophomore Gavin Jenkins says he en
joys biking through the muck.
Whether you're sunbathing, navigating the
lake on foot, rafting straight across or taking a
moonlit stroll with a special someone. Lake
provides its fair share of fun to more
than just endangered salamanders.
