## Editorial Keep Capetown

The Overseas Studies Program repre
sents Stanford at its best, giving stu
dents both adventure and education
at the same time. Yet, with the 2002 closure
of its programs in Buenos Aires, Argenti
na, and Puebla, Mexico something is miss
ing from the overseas program: diversity.
With five of the permanent overseas pro
grams in Europe, one in Japan, and anoth
er in Australia the present set of overseas
programs are overwhelmingly biased to
wards the rich western world. Even the
one in South America sits in a thriving,
Americanized city.
The Overseas Studies Program has
moved towards addressing that problem
with its recent opening of a campus in Bei
jing. But we are most excited about is the
current program in Capetown, South Africa.
We believe that a permanent Capetown pro
gram could become a unique resource for
Stanford students.
Until this year, Africa was the only inhab
ited continent not represented in the Over
seas Studies Program (beyond overseas
seminars), yet at the same time this is the
continent that needs an overseas program
the most. Most students can easily imagine
visiting or even living in Oxford or Florence
without the assistance of an overseas pro
gram; traveling through Africa is more ambi
tious. An overseas program in Capetown
provides a safe way for students to visit a
continent where they might have concerns
about everything from language to crime if
they traveled on their own.
And for many, visiting Africa should be
an important part of their undergraduate ca
reers. International health is a natural choice
for Human Biology majors and pre-meds.
International relations majors need to study
development, not just the Western world.
And future leaders from any field would get
a much more complete picture if they
stepped outside of not just the Stanford bub
ble but the whole bubble of the first world.
There are already many ways to visit de
veloping countries at Stanford. Undergradu
ate Research Programs provides numerous

grants for overseas research, often in health
and development. Many of the overseas
seminars go places where the University
lacks a regular presence, including Tanzania.
Students can join another school's overseas
program that goes where they want to go.
But none of these options has the advan
tages of a actual overseas program: perma
nence, connections and a true commitment
by the University.
There may be other options that are bet
ter than Capetown.The University must bal
ance many factors in making its decision, but
it should not discount the idea that if they
build it, students will go. An overseas pro
gram in the developing world could be com
bined with a health care program for med
ical students who are finishing their degrees.
It could offer quarter or summer internships
that could let students break into careers in
international health.
Indeed, the students in Capetown already
are working on many great projects. In part
nership with the University of Capetown,
local township community health commit
tees and health clinics, all students engage in
community health assessment projects.
Other students are pursing independent re
search, studying medical care for HIV posi
tive women.
And indeed, Capetown might be the right
place fora new permanent program. As an
English speaking country, it lacks a foreign
language requirement. Also, South Africa
represents an intersection between the first
and third world, lessening the culture shock
of traveling to Africa.
We know that it is too early to judge the
success of the South Africa program, but we
have outlined why the program has great po
tential. As the only program in Africa, it
would add great diversity to overseas lineup,
and it provides opportunities to enter inter
national health unavailable on Stanford cam
pus. Given the great potential of the pro
gram, we hope that Stanford will make the
Capetown program's success a top priority,
even if it has to clear liability, donation and
interest hurdles to do so.
