# Headhunting for hope
## 
### 
Our favorite people now live in
garages; we were worried that we
would become them.
Garages store the things most people
don't think they will use fora while. What
better place to rediscover the life that you
put aside during your 16 years of education.
Yet in this liminal space they haven't found
vocations. Our friends have found peace
playing video games, applying to profession
al schools, or tutoring Palo Alto's richer chil
dren. When they venture out of their hovels
they take classes at Foothill College, that
jewel of California's education system that
also serves as a halfway house for recent
Stanford graduates.
You could hang around the Arrillaga
Alumni Center all day long and have repeti
tive conversations with graduates from 1942.
But we'd rather be talking to recent escapees
who return to glamorize our past and galva
nize our futures. They are our lackluster he
roes.
These graduates have severed their ties.
They don't owe anything to anyone here.
Like outlaws in the Wild West, they'd as soon
shoot you as look at you. Well, maybe not
that last one
When they come back, they exude a non
chalant glow as if they were B-list stars ap
pearing from the premiere of their latest
straight-to-DVD release. Perhaps it's hum
bling to admit that we look up to them. But
B-list columnists that we are, it's hardly sur
prising.
We've accepted that offers from the New
Yorker are not forthcoming. We've also ac
cepted that our dream of marrying well is an
tifeminist, and unlikely. Thankfully, we were
recently reminded that we are eminently

employable, with our carefully honed com
munication skills and all that critical think
ing we did before sleep deprivation drilled
holes in our frontal lobes.
We won't despair because in addition to
these garage dwellers and nostalgic re
turnees, we have a secret weapon who prom
ises to "show all those corporate fucks in
Sigma Nu that hippies get jobs, too. To pro
tect the guilty, we have changed the name,
but for those who know Garfield Roosevelt,
his actions will speak for him.
When we told Garfield we wanted to write
about him, he laughed his understated
chuckle and said that he was honored to be
interviewed by anyone other than the police
or homeland security. But legal issues aside,
if we had all done Stanford the right way, we
would have done it like Garfield Roosevelt.
All the joys of four years spent frittering
about in the finer arts of poetry, drinking and
conversation, without the looming shadow
of future mendicancy. Garfield, a 2005 grad
uate with a master's degree in English, cur
rently works as a corporate headhunter in
San Francisco. What does a corporate head
hunter do? Garfield hangs around the office
looking good and networking.
