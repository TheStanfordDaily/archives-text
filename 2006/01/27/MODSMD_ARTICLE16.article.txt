## Senator defends funding 
### DANNY ARBEITER 
Wednesday's news article "Funding Cap
Irks Groups" (Jan. 25) demonstrates some
common misconceptions about the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate that warrant clarifi
cation. The statement that "unless a group
has 150 or more members...it cannot receive
the full $6,000 maximum allotted to it in the
Senate by-laws," implies that the Senate by
laws automatically apportion money to
groups, rather than the Senate itself. The ar
ticle misleads student groups into having un
reasonable expectations and a false sense of
entitlement.
To clarify, the Undergraduate Senate by
laws do not "allot" any money to student

groups. The by-laws only establish the maxi
mum amount groups can receive from the
Senate, and they in no way imply that a
group deserves that amount, nor do they es
tablish that every group or any group is enti
tled to that amount.
Look at the numbers: If we were to equal
ly fund all 250 student groups that apply for
general fee funding, evaluating groups on no
criteria other than whether or not they exist,
we could afford to give each group approxi
mately $1,790. If one must assign a dollar
value to the amount groups are "entitled to,"
it would be far more accurate to use this fig
ure than the $6,000 maximum.
Because we don't have an infinite
budget, every time an allocation
over $ 1,7W is given, another group's
funding has to be sacrificed. Just to
give an idea, fewer than 10 groups
have actually requested less than
$1,790.This should make it clear that
cuts have to be made.
For this reason. I find it unfortu
nate that anyone feels attacked by
the new policies. I think everyone
can agree that groups arc better off
now than they were last winter, when
the general fee went bankrupt from
overspending, and the Senate had to
stop allocating funds altogether.
Viewing the soft cap as an alterna
tive to last year, I think student
groups should be pleased.
Rather than asserting that this
policy favors larger groups over
smaller groups (which is not neces
sarily a bad idea), I would focus on

the fact that now. all groups will at
least have the opportunity to receive
Senate funds.
If students want to help alleviate
the situation, I call upon them to
pressure their financial managers to
present the Senate with budgets that
reflect a greater attempt to minimize
costs. Not every student perform
ance group needs $2,(XM) worth of fa
cilities (the cost of Dinkelspiel or
Kresge Auditorium) and equipment
rental to perform before fewer than
2(M) people, when they could perform
in Toyon lounge fora mere $20
cleaning fee. If they feel that profes
sional-grade lighting and sound are
required fora performance, there
are ways to do this fora reasonable
cost.
For instance, an a capella group
could rent an auditorium fora per
formance at 7 P.M. and then hand off
the facility to a dance group to have
a performance at 9 P.M..splitting the
costs. If the events are scheduled
back-to-back, the groups could even
cross-promote and offer special tick
et prices to attendees of both events.

leading to a larger audience and
higher revenues. These groups would
become eligible for even more
money via the VSO Collaboration
fund. Student group collaboration is
a true win-win-win situation as the
student groups, the ASSU and the at
tendees of their events benefit.
As the Senate has been saying all
along: The new funding policies are
not ideal, but they are the best op
tion given the situation. If anyone
has a better way to allocate funds,or
any suggestions at all for the Senate,
I encourage them to submit their
ideas to any Senator, and we'd be
more than happy to consider them.
Beyond Wednesday's Daily article,
the Senate has not received any
negative feedback regarding the
new funding policies, so we'd love to
hear the concerns of student group
leaders.
