## Senator defends funding 
### DANNY ARBEITER 
Wednesday's news article "Funding Cap
Irks Groups" (Jan. 25) demonstrates some
common misconceptions about the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate that warrant clarifi
cation. The statement that "unless a group
has 150 or more members...it cannot receive
the full $6,000 maximum allotted to it in the
Senate by-laws," implies that the Senate by
laws automatically apportion money to
groups, rather than the Senate itself. The ar
ticle misleads student groups into having un
reasonable expectations and a false sense of
entitlement.
To clarify, the Undergraduate Senate by
laws do not "allot" any money to student

groups. The by-laws only establish the maxi
mum amount groups can receive from the
Senate, and they in no way imply that a
group deserves that amount, nor do they es
tablish that every group or any group is enti
tled to that amount.
Look at the numbers: If we were to equal
ly fund all 250 student groups that apply for
general fee funding, evaluating groups on no
criteria other than whether or not they exist,
we could afford to give each group approxi
mately $1,790. If one must assign a dollar
value to the amount groups are "entitled to,"
it would be far more accurate to use this fig
ure than the $6,000 maximum.
