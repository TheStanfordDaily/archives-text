# An athlete's guide to airport terminals
## 
### 
Student athletes travel. A lot. When we're
in season, it's sometimes possible to go
through our athletic department plan
ners and find that a majority of days in one
quarter will be spent on the road. Professors
love this. The jet-set lifestyle, however, gives
Stanford's athletes a unique set of resume
boosting capabilities:
Traveling at one of the airports of the Pac
-10 and need to find full-service Starbucks?
Just call up an athlete; we've got every termi
nal memorized. Want to know which airline
has the best in-flight snack boxes? Give us a
ring, we've tried them all. (It's Southwest.)
Opened your in-flight magazine to find the
crossword half completed already? Well,
we're probably responsible for that too.
Traveling is a healthy opportunity to get
away from the Stanford bubble and observe
life in the outside world. (And yes,for those of
you who haven't left campus, watched TV, or
read any paper but The Daily since Winter
Break, it still exists.) Some people are really
interesting to watch. Business travelers, for
example. Although their generic grey suits
and uniform attache cases label them as card
carrying (ha! literally!) businessmen, it's al
most impossible to tell, just by looking, what
they really do. Is that a billion dollar banker,
or the president of a candy factory? A sleazy
scam artist or just an Ebay executive?
Frankly, the enigma turns us on.
But trips to the airport are not just for idle
people-watching. The observation thing
works both ways, and sometimes, they're
more interested in you than you are in them.
This can be a problem.
Slap on your best Stanford sweatsuits and
meander to Gate 1428 with similarly-dressed
teammates and you're likely to get more than
a few odd exclamations from fellow travelers.
The first thing they usually notice is red.
Something about a sea of zippy red uniforms
seems to make normal people go a little
crazy. Sucked in by the powerful force of the

athletic mystique, they automatically shout
out the first thing that comes to mind. Usual
ly it's something dumb.
"Yeah Wisconsin!" or "Go NC State!"
Ok, people. Look before you leap. We're in
San Jose International Airport.There are pic
tures of Stanford athletes on the walls here!
for cripes sake. Just because your dumb alma
mater's colors were also red and white does
n't necessarily mean that the stars aligned to
send an entire team of Badgers or the Wolf
pack in your direction.
But luckily, most travelers hold their
tongues long enough to note the telltale white
S on the front of the jackets. This, however,
does not necessarily improve the quality of
dialogue. For example, everyone's got to get a
word in about the mascot.
"So what's your mascot anyway?"
"We're the Cardinal, sir."
"The Cardinal? You sure? because I guess
I've always thought you guys were the trees.
Where's the cardinal? Is it sitting in the tree?
And how 'bout them Indians?"
"No, no sir. It's actually the color Cardinal.
It's red."
"So where the heck did the tree come
from?"
As you can imagine, this is a discussion
that can last for hours. Days, even, from what
we've heard. Although that might just be an
urban legend.
But even if your seatmates avoid being
distracted by the color of your uniforms, and
they somehow know to ignore the mascot,

they still aren't immune to silly assumptions.
An educated observer can look at a sea of
Cardinal sweats and have a pretty good idea
what team she's looking at. Gymnasts are
short. Basketball and volleyball players are
tall. Swimmers have droopy shoulders.
Golfers have raccoon tan lines; distance run
ners are wiry.
This doesn't always work.The last time the
divers traveled as a team, some poor flight at
tendant asked us if we were a cheerleading
squad.
In any case, once they know what sport
you play, it's pretty much over. You can expect
all sorts of silly comments. We'll take one
from personal experience:
"You're a diver? That's great. My grand
children love to snorkel in the bathtub!"
"No ma'am, not that kind of diver."
And then there's the upstanding academic
reputation. Athlete or no, everyone has prob
ably dealt with the-guy-in-the-middle-seat at
least once. You know what guy we're talking
about.
"Doing work, huh? Figures since you're
from Stanford and a11...h0w about I tell you
my life story?" At this point, you close your
textbook, pull out the in-flight magazine,
open to the crossword puzzle, pull out head
phones, and crank your iPod volume up as
high as it'll go. Even so, you can vaguely hear
your seatmate work his way from early child
hood to college years.
We can make fun of the jocks, the nerds,
the jersey chasers and the sorority girls all we
want, but really, none of these cliched campus
subcultures can compare to the odd sorts of
people we meet in airports. It's like we're zoo
animals, but someone forgot to put up the
"please don't feed, touch, or ask silly ques
tions of the Cardinal" sign.
