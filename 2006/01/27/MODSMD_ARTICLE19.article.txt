Hopkins not just for grads
Your article on Hopkins Marine Station
in the Grad Life section ("Down by the
Seashore," Jan. 25) only briefly mentioned
the opportunities available to undergradu
ates. Undergrads at Hopkins can take the Bio
Core or any of a number of fantastic ad
vanced courses, do exciting research (and
publish it), and this spring can even apply to
go on a month-long journey in Baja Califor
nia. Essentially, they can do everything the
grad students do, but without the complicat
ed neuroses you read about in the comic
strips.
Undergrads interested in living by the
ocean and taking some of the best classes at

Stanford needn't wait.They can apply at hop
kins.stanford.edu — no GRE scores re
quired.

Re: "Texas Prof Condemns Porn" (Jan. 26).
That so much porn today is utterly tasteless
and appeals to misogynistic temperaments is
hardly reason enough to condemn the whole
of erotica.
In a fundamentally juvenile society such
as ours — at once terrified and titillated by
sex — the vibrancy and perversity of the
porn industry should come as no surprise.
The mainstream media routinely shun erotic

content in favor of more socially acceptable
violent content, thus relegating the art of
arousal to the domain of business, where
questions of taste and social responsibility
are less pressing, and profit is irresistible.
The situation is reminiscent of the drug
war, in which the denial of the reality of drug
use led us to cede the recreational drug trade
to violent criminals for whom safety and
quality are of little concern. Porn is merely a
symptom of a much greater cultural ill that
will take considerable time and wisdom to
remedy.
