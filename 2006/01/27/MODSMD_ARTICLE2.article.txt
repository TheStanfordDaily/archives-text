# Japanese Leader Speaks
## DISCUSSES U.S. AND CHINA RELATIONS 
### MIMA MOHAMMED STAFF WRITER 
"Quite rarely 1 speak at a universi
ty in the United States. Sometimes I
am quite fearful," said former Japan
ese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimo
to as he addressed a large audience —
many of them standing — in Bechtel
Conference Center last night. He
spoke in Japanese because — as he ex
plained — it is the only language he
understands. Earphones providing an
English translation were available for
members of the audience.
In his speech, Hashimoto addressed
a variety of topics, including national
ism in Japan, economic fluctuations
and issues and Japanese relations with
China, North Korea and the United
States. He said that he is worried for
Japan and the relations they have with
neighboring countries, which may ex
plain the rise of nationalism in Japan.
"I have a feeling that the entire
country of Japan is swinging toward
the right-conservative trend. I do not
think this is a desirous trend. National
ism is very easy to instigate," said
Hashimoto.
Hashimoto spent a great deal of

time during the question and answer
section addressing questions about the
relations between Japan and China.
An audience member brought up the
issue that education in Japanese and
Chinese schools may not be reflective
of true history. However, Hashimoto
said he did not wish to engage in the
debate of whether textbooks are true.
"1 am concerned about the bilateral
relations. We can change that [animos
ity between Japan and China]. Leaders
of these two countries have stopped
interaction. 1 plan to visit Beijing,
China with business leaders of Japan
in mid-April," explained Hashimoto.
He did highlight the fact that the
youth between the two countries are
engaging in activities together, al
though their leaders are not. Hashimo
to praised the program where mid
level military officers from Japan and
China visit one another, which give
them an opportunity to learn about
each other. He believes that there
needs to be a re-examination of histo
ry between Japan and China.
"1 would like the people [of Japan
and China] to learn more about each
other, but I am not too optimistic
about it," said Hashimoto.

Hashimoto expressed a lot of con
cern about Japan with North Korea,
highlighting the fact that the Japanese
never said they will not cooperate with
North Korea. Japanese people have
been kidnapped by North Korea and
they have been called upon to engage
in a dialog. However, Hashimoto said
initially the North Koreans denied the
kidnappings. Subsequently they ad

mitted and returned some of those
who were kidnapped. Many Japanese
still want to know about their relatives
who have been kidnapped.
"We are still in the scope of North
Korean missiles, they do not have one
that can fly to the U.S. We need to be
piepared so we can intercept missiles.
