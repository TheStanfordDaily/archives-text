# Japanese Leader Speaks
## DISCUSSES U.S. AND CHINA RELATIONS 
### MIMA MOHAMMED STAFF WRITER 
"Quite rarely 1 speak at a universi
ty in the United States. Sometimes I
am quite fearful," said former Japan
ese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimo
to as he addressed a large audience —
many of them standing — in Bechtel
Conference Center last night. He
spoke in Japanese because — as he ex
plained — it is the only language he
understands. Earphones providing an
English translation were available for
members of the audience.
In his speech, Hashimoto addressed
a variety of topics, including national
ism in Japan, economic fluctuations
and issues and Japanese relations with
China, North Korea and the United
States. He said that he is worried for
Japan and the relations they have with
neighboring countries, which may ex
plain the rise of nationalism in Japan.
"I have a feeling that the entire
country of Japan is swinging toward
the right-conservative trend. I do not
think this is a desirous trend. National
ism is very easy to instigate," said
Hashimoto.
Hashimoto spent a great deal of

time during the question and answer
section addressing questions about the
relations between Japan and China.
An audience member brought up the
issue that education in Japanese and
Chinese schools may not be reflective
of true history. However, Hashimoto
said he did not wish to engage in the
debate of whether textbooks are true.
"1 am concerned about the bilateral
relations. We can change that [animos
ity between Japan and China]. Leaders
of these two countries have stopped
interaction. 1 plan to visit Beijing,
China with business leaders of Japan
in mid-April," explained Hashimoto.
He did highlight the fact that the
youth between the two countries are
engaging in activities together, al
though their leaders are not. Hashimo
to praised the program where mid
level military officers from Japan and
China visit one another, which give
them an opportunity to learn about
each other. He believes that there
needs to be a re-examination of histo
ry between Japan and China.
"1 would like the people [of Japan
and China] to learn more about each
other, but I am not too optimistic
about it," said Hashimoto.

Hashimoto expressed a lot of con
cern about Japan with North Korea,
highlighting the fact that the Japanese
never said they will not cooperate with
North Korea. Japanese people have
been kidnapped by North Korea and
they have been called upon to engage
in a dialog. However, Hashimoto said
initially the North Koreans denied the
kidnappings. Subsequently they ad

mitted and returned some of those
who were kidnapped. Many Japanese
still want to know about their relatives
who have been kidnapped.
"We are still in the scope of North
Korean missiles, they do not have one
that can fly to the U.S. We need to be
piepared so we can intercept missiles.

A large audience gathered to hear a talk by former Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto in the Bechtel Conference Center last night.
If we have a confidence they would
n't do that, we wouldn't be working
to prevent it," said Hashimoto.
Hashimoto reflected on Sept. 11,
saying that he believes that we have
to fight terrorists in all countries.
However, he did comment on the
relations between the United States
and the United Nations.
"The U.S. and the United Na
tions are not on good terms. That is
unfortunate. I want the U.S. to do its
share in contributing to the U.N.
said Hashimoto.
There was a disagreement be
tween an audience member and the
status of minorities in Japan. One
audience member said he believed
that Japan is homogeneous with
some groups of minorities burgeon
ing in size. The former prime minis
ter believes that Japan is not homo
geneous, and that the Japanese need
to be more open to diversity.
Before he was elected prime
minister of Japan in January 19%,
Hashimoto was a veteran politician,
highly respected for his knowledge

of domestic affairs. In his speech,
Hashimoto considered the changes
under way in Japan. In September
2005, Hashimoto's Liberal Democ
ratic Party experienced a landslide
victory.
Hashimoto briefly worked at
Toyobo Co., a spinning firm, until
his father's untimely death. He then
became a second-generation politi
cian, at the age of 26, he was elected
to the House of Representatives —
always part of the Liberal Democra
tic Party's mainstream.
Hashimoto guided some of the
most important developments in
modern Japanese history, from im
proving trade and security relations
with the United States to imple
menting crucial deregulation poli
cies and administrative reforms.
He served two years as prime
minister of Japan and 13 terms in
the House of Representatives.
I lashimoto also made significant
gains on the diplomatic front, and
through summit meetings with U.S.
President Bill Clinton, reinforced

the bilateral security arrangements

Administrative Reform Promotion
at the LDP headquarters, and Min
ister of State for Administrative Re

"I would've liked to see greater
discussion concerning the treat
ment of minorities within Japanese
society. While it was refreshing to
hear Hashimoto acknowledge the
need for growth in his nation's atti
tude towards diversity, the question
of ethnic tension was disappointing
ly focused on foreign affairs," said
senior Blake Arnold about
Hashimoto's address.
"I have twelve grandchildren.
When my grandchildren grow up, I
do not want Japan to disappear
from the surface of the earth. I will
work hard to not make that hap
pen," said Hashimoto in his last re
marks.

"The U.S. and the United Na

There was a disagreement be

status of minorities in Japan. One
audience member said he believed
that Japan is homogeneous with
some groups of minorities burgeon

geneous, and that the Japanese need
to be more open to diversity.
Before he was elected prime
minister of Japan in January 19%,

victory.

his father's untimely death. He then

cian, at the age of 26, he was elected
to the House of Representatives —

most important developments in
modern Japanese history, from im

the bilateral security arrangements
on which the post-Cold War Japan-
U.S. alliance is founded. Since leav
ing office in 1998, Hashimoto has
served as senior adviser to Prime
Minister Koizumi, senior advisor for
Administrative Reform Promotion
at the LDP headquarters, and Min
ister of State for Administrative Re
form.
"I would've liked to see greater
discussion concerning the treat
ment of minorities within Japanese
society. While it was refreshing to
hear Hashimoto acknowledge the
need for growth in his nation's atti
tude towards diversity, the question
of ethnic tension was disappointing
ly focused on foreign affairs," said
senior Blake Arnold about
Hashimoto's address.
"I have twelve grandchildren.
When my grandchildren grow up, I
do not want Japan to disappear
from the surface of the earth. I will
work hard to not make that hap
pen," said Hashimoto in his last re
marks.
"Quite rarely 1 speak at a universi
ty in the United States. Sometimes I
am quite fearful," said former Japan
ese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimo
to as he addressed a large audience —
many of them standing — in Bechtel
Conference Center last night. He
spoke in Japanese because — as he ex
plained — it is the only language he
understands. Earphones providing an
English translation were available for
members of the audience.
In his speech, Hashimoto addressed
a variety of topics, including national
ism in Japan, economic fluctuations
and issues and Japanese relations with
China, North Korea and the United
States. He said that he is worried for
Japan and the relations they have with
neighboring countries, which may ex
plain the rise of nationalism in Japan.
"I have a feeling that the entire
country of Japan is swinging toward
the right-conservative trend. I do not
think this is a desirous trend. National
ism is very easy to instigate," said
Hashimoto.
Hashimoto spent a great deal of

time during the question and answer
section addressing questions about the
relations between Japan and China.
An audience member brought up the
issue that education in Japanese and
Chinese schools may not be reflective
of true history. However, Hashimoto
said he did not wish to engage in the
debate of whether textbooks are true.
"1 am concerned about the bilateral
relations. We can change that [animos
ity between Japan and China]. Leaders
of these two countries have stopped
interaction. 1 plan to visit Beijing,
China with business leaders of Japan
in mid-April," explained Hashimoto.
He did highlight the fact that the
youth between the two countries are
engaging in activities together, al
though their leaders are not. Hashimo
to praised the program where mid
level military officers from Japan and
China visit one another, which give
them an opportunity to learn about
each other. He believes that there
needs to be a re-examination of histo
ry between Japan and China.
"1 would like the people [of Japan
and China] to learn more about each
other, but I am not too optimistic
about it," said Hashimoto.

Hashimoto expressed a lot of con
cern about Japan with North Korea,
highlighting the fact that the Japanese
never said they will not cooperate with
North Korea. Japanese people have
been kidnapped by North Korea and
they have been called upon to engage
in a dialog. However, Hashimoto said
initially the North Koreans denied the
kidnappings. Subsequently they ad

mitted and returned some of those
who were kidnapped. Many Japanese
still want to know about their relatives
who have been kidnapped.
"We are still in the scope of North
Korean missiles, they do not have one
that can fly to the U.S. We need to be
piepared so we can intercept missiles.

A large audience gathered to hear a talk by former Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto in the Bechtel Conference Center last night.
If we have a confidence they would
n't do that, we wouldn't be working
to prevent it," said Hashimoto.
Hashimoto reflected on Sept. 11,
saying that he believes that we have
to fight terrorists in all countries.
However, he did comment on the
relations between the United States
and the United Nations.
"The U.S. and the United Na
tions are not on good terms. That is
