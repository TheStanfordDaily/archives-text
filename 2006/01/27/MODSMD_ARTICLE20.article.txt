## Andrew Rogers Umpiring is now a risky business 
### 
When 1 was a freshman in high
school, I took a summer job as a
baseball umpire. I figured I
could use a little extra cash, and what bet
ter way to do it than spending time on the
diamond, where I basically lived any
way? Little did I know that my easy
earned cash would come with a side of
emotional scarring and a general feeling
of embarrassment.
I worked for Little League Baseball,
which has become infamous for the be
havior of some of its coaches and par
ents. If you're not familiar with the vicar
ious living syndrome that seems to run
rampant in youth sports today, here's the
gist of it.
In a society that places an ever grow
ing emphasis on sporting greatness and
identifying and developing talent early,
a disturbing trend has developed. Par
ents, coaches and fans have become so
involved with the future of their little
athletes that their conduct has gone
from loving support to dirty play. While
this behavior is far from the norm, more
and more stories are popping up about
adults acting recklessly, even resorting
to violence.
Once, when I was calling a baseball
game, a fly ball was hit to the outfield.
With a runner on second base, 1 ran out
to the outfield to make sure the catch was
made. After the out, the runner tagged
and moved to third,or so I thought. After
the play, the coach of the team in the field
had his pitcher throw the ball to second
base to see if the runner had left early. I,
of course, signaled safe as I had before,
and then all hell broke loose.
The coach stormed out of the dugout
and ran out to second base where I was
standing. Cussing and screaming (mind
you, I'm umping an eight- and nine-year
old game), he called me things that I'm
not allowed to write in this column.
Needless to say,it wasn't pretty. Not only
was it inappropriate, but I actually felt a
little threatened. If the coach hadn't
been about five inches shorter and 45
pounds lighter than I was, I would have
called the cops.
I'll admit. I could have been paying a
little better attention to what was going
on in the infield. The kid may have left
early, but I didn't have enough evidence
to overturn the call, and it was my call.
I've moved on.
But you can't expect referees in gen
eral to always get things right. There 1
was, a freshman in high school who still
had to get my parents to take me to and
from my job, getting railed by this 50-
year-old who had probably already in
vested a college tuition and a coronary in
his son's baseball career.
I thought my incident might be isolat
ed or not part of a general trend. Wrong!
I did a little searching online, and came
up with these perfect displays of un
sportsmanlike conduct:
