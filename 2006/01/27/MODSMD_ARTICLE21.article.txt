# Card down Cougars at home, 69-59
## Senior Matt Haryasz's point total tops 20 for fourth-straight game 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
The Cardinal's first half last night against Washington
State may have been the best 20 minutes of basketball
that the team had put together all season long. Yet Stan
ford couldn't avoid another dramatic ending and had to
hold on to win, 69-59.
It took a series of defensive stops and made free
throws for Stanford (9-7.5-3 Pacific 10 Conference) in
the final three minutes to fight off a pesky Cougar squad
(9-8,2-6). The Cougars had cut a 12-point deficit to just
two in the second half.
No Cardinal player had a bigger role in the final min
utes than freshinan guard Mitch Johnson. While he
scored just eight points in the game, he hit a key jump
shot that extended Stanford's late lead to seven. He then
made four critical free throws in the final minute of play
and ripped the ball away from Cougar guard Kvle
Weaver with 32 seconds left to seal the win.
"He's gotten better, but this is what I've expected
from him. and this is what he's expected for himself,"
head coach Trent Johnson said. "He's doing what he's ca
pable of doing, and he's doing what we need him to do in
order for us to be successful. He's not afraid to make
plays. He has a lot of confidence."
While Mitch Johnson may have put the final touches
on the win, senior forward Matt Haryasz once again car
ried the offensive load for the Cardinal. After scoring 52
points in two games last weekend against the Arizona
schools, Haryasz dumped in 22 points on nine of 13
shooting and added nine rebounds.
"His teammates continue to give him the ball in situ
ations where he can score." Trent Johnson said. "We
have two guys who can take the ball and make other
people better in Mitch and [senior guard] Chris [Her
nandez]. In the course of the game they do a good job of
finding the open man."
Stanford's offensive success, especially in the first
half, came as a surprise given that Washington State is
known for its stingy defense and slow, consistent play.
The Cougars came into the game with an NCAA top-10
scoring defense, giving up under 57 points per contest,
but the Cardinal seemed to have no difficulty moving
the ball up and down the court.
In the Cardinal's remarkable first half, they turned
the ball over just two times in the first period while pick
ing up 10 assists.
The lack of mistakes combined with the Cardinal's
ability to hit open shots led to a 38-27 lead at the half. In
contrast, Stanford scored just 26 points total in the two
first halves of two regular-season Cougar victories.
"They like to push the ball a little more [than pre
vious Washington State teams]," said Hernandez,
who finished the game with 11 points and three as
sists."They don't wind the clock down 33 seconds and
then execute well and get a good shot and nail it.They
like to run it a little more which is definitely benefi
cial for us."
Stanford used a 16-5 run with 13:35 left in the first
half to build up to a game-high 12-point lead.'lTie spurt
was highlighted by nine points from Haryasz, eight of
which came in the paint.
"We executed really well against a good defensive
team," coach Johnson said. "We passed the ball very
well. We played very unselfishly out there."
Yet, despite the quality of play through the first 20
minutes, the Cardinal could never pull away from the
Cougars. Six minutes into the third period, the big half
time lead was cut to just four points, as the Cougar de
fense began to play up to form.
The Cardinal turned the ball over eight times in the
second half and shot just 7-19 from the field. Meanwhile,
the Cougars began to show signs of life on the offensive
end. Guard Josh Akognon hit two three-pointers at mo
ments when Stanford finally seemed to be pulling away
and finished with a team-high 15 points.

Senior guard Dan Grunfeld chipped in nine points in last night's contest The Cougars, who have lost five straight, led only once
during the game, at 2-0.
"I thought it was a combination of
us getting fatigued a little hit and what
they did," Johnson said. "They are a
good basketball team. I want to give
credit to their defense rather than just
us getting careless with the ball."
With the score 43-34, Washington
State went on a seven-point run over
a span of 5:23 to cut the Cardinal
lead to two. ITie Cardinal shot 0-3
from the field and turned the ball

over twice in that span. The series
was capped by a pair of layups from
Weaver, who had 14 points on the
night before fouling out in the
game's closing moments.
But the Cougars could never tie
or take the lead as the Cardinal re
sponded with a five-point surge of
their own. including a three pointer
from Haryasz.

The Cardinal's first half last night against Washington
State may have been the best 20 minutes of basketball
that the team had put together all season long. Yet Stan
ford couldn't avoid another dramatic ending and had to
hold on to win, 69-59.
It took a series of defensive stops and made free
throws for Stanford (9-7.5-3 Pacific 10 Conference) in
the final three minutes to fight off a pesky Cougar squad
(9-8,2-6). The Cougars had cut a 12-point deficit to just
two in the second half.
No Cardinal player had a bigger role in the final min
utes than freshinan guard Mitch Johnson. While he
scored just eight points in the game, he hit a key jump
shot that extended Stanford's late lead to seven. He then
made four critical free throws in the final minute of play
and ripped the ball away from Cougar guard Kvle
Weaver with 32 seconds left to seal the win.
"He's gotten better, but this is what I've expected
from him. and this is what he's expected for himself,"
head coach Trent Johnson said. "He's doing what he's ca
pable of doing, and he's doing what we need him to do in
order for us to be successful. He's not afraid to make
plays. He has a lot of confidence."
While Mitch Johnson may have put the final touches
on the win, senior forward Matt Haryasz once again car
ried the offensive load for the Cardinal. After scoring 52
points in two games last weekend against the Arizona
schools, Haryasz dumped in 22 points on nine of 13
shooting and added nine rebounds.
"His teammates continue to give him the ball in situ
ations where he can score." Trent Johnson said. "We
have two guys who can take the ball and make other
people better in Mitch and [senior guard] Chris [Her
nandez]. In the course of the game they do a good job of
finding the open man."
Stanford's offensive success, especially in the first
half, came as a surprise given that Washington State is
known for its stingy defense and slow, consistent play.
The Cougars came into the game with an NCAA top-10
scoring defense, giving up under 57 points per contest,
but the Cardinal seemed to have no difficulty moving
the ball up and down the court.
In the Cardinal's remarkable first half, they turned
the ball over just two times in the first period while pick
ing up 10 assists.
The lack of mistakes combined with the Cardinal's
ability to hit open shots led to a 38-27 lead at the half. In
contrast, Stanford scored just 26 points total in the two
first halves of two regular-season Cougar victories.
"They like to push the ball a little more [than pre
vious Washington State teams]," said Hernandez,
who finished the game with 11 points and three as
sists."They don't wind the clock down 33 seconds and
then execute well and get a good shot and nail it.They
like to run it a little more which is definitely benefi
cial for us."
Stanford used a 16-5 run with 13:35 left in the first
half to build up to a game-high 12-point lead.'lTie spurt
was highlighted by nine points from Haryasz, eight of
which came in the paint.
"We executed really well against a good defensive
team," coach Johnson said. "We passed the ball very
well. We played very unselfishly out there."
Yet, despite the quality of play through the first 20
minutes, the Cardinal could never pull away from the
Cougars. Six minutes into the third period, the big half
time lead was cut to just four points, as the Cougar de
fense began to play up to form.
The Cardinal turned the ball over eight times in the
second half and shot just 7-19 from the field. Meanwhile,
the Cougars began to show signs of life on the offensive
end. Guard Josh Akognon hit two three-pointers at mo
ments when Stanford finally seemed to be pulling away
and finished with a team-high 15 points.

Senior guard Dan Grunfeld chipped in nine points in last night's contest The Cougars, who have lost five straight, led only once
during the game, at 2-0.
"I thought it was a combination of
us getting fatigued a little hit and what
they did," Johnson said. "They are a
good basketball team. I want to give
credit to their defense rather than just
us getting careless with the ball."
With the score 43-34, Washington
State went on a seven-point run over
a span of 5:23 to cut the Cardinal
lead to two. ITie Cardinal shot 0-3
from the field and turned the ball

over twice in that span. The series
