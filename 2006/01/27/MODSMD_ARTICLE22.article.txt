### JOE KAY 
In their third trip to face Southern California
schools this season, the Cardinal hope to build on
last weekend's triumphs and emotional victories.
Stanford (2-6,1-3 Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration) is scheduled to visit CSIJ-Northridge on
Friday at 7 p.m, then travel up the coast to face UC'-
Santa Barbara at 8 p.m. on Saturday
Despite dropping out of the top-15 AVCA
rankings, the team's 3-0 win against UC-San Diego
(0-5,0-3) on Thursday broke Stanford's five-game
losing skid. The Cardinal also had an encouraging
match against to No. 1 Long Beach State (6-0.2-0)
last Friday, putting up a fight but ultimately going
down in four games.
LBSU took the first game, but toward the end of
the second game, Stanford subbed in two inexperi
enced but eager freshmen in Miki Groppi and
Brandon Williams. Their intensity sparked a 30-27
win in the third game. Groppi. a setter, finished
with a team-high 35 assists.
The Cardinal lost the fourth game, but associate
head coach John Kosty — who will take over the
program when head coach Don Shaw retires this
year — concluded they are a better team following
the loss.
"I think they're responding very well," Kosty
said. "We had a good practice [ Iliesdayj. We had a

very good film meeting on Monday. I"hey have a
very positive attitude in practice knowing that
we're close to Long Beach. I think that with the
loss, there were a lot of positives that came out of
it."
"We're working harder," added Matt Ceran, a
sophomore middle blocker. "We're trying to get
more emotional so we don't go flat like we did in
games I.2,and 4 (against I.BSU|. As well as getting
the technical aspects of the game, we're trying to
get the emotional aspects into it too."
To improve their chances of winning, the Cardi
nal will need to be more accurate with their serves.
Stanford had 17 serving errors alone in the game
against the 49ers, including six from Groppi alone.
Another concern is the squad's passing ability
Against I .BSU.the Cardinal's passes were often er
rant, forcing Stanford to set its outside hitters.This
allowed the 49ers to set up a triple block, inhibiting
Stanford's ability to make runs.
"If you can't make a good pass, you can't run
your offense." Ceran said. " Ihe [opposing) block
ers know where the ball's going to go.'l Tic offense
is limited."

likely the center of every team's
game plan when facing the No. 9
Gauchos (2-5, 1-3). The Cardinal
have decided to focus on other play
ers. shifting their focus away from
last year's 6-foot-7 All-American.
Stanford plans on letting Patak
wreak as much havoc as he can. as
long as the Cardinal step up their
game in other forms.

"If Evan has a career night, well
that's fine, but we have to contain
everybody else." Kosty said.
Patak has amassed 147 kills in this
young season. He also has 18 serving
aces in just 25 games, amounting to
.72 serving aces per game count.
i le is ripping his jump serve and
he's keeping it in so he is putting a lot
of pressure on the sideout team,"
Kosty said.
Stanford hopes to get back into
the top 15 after this weekend, but to
do that, the Cardinal will have to
build on the experience they gained
from the passionate loss to LBSU.
