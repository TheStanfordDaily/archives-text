### ISRAEL ROJAS 
Stanford's 2006 track season begins this weekend at
Washington's Dempsey Indoor facility. In what is now
the fifth annual UW Invitational, athletes look to es
tablish their position on the traveling squad.
UW plays host to some of the top programs from
across the Pacific 10 Conference. For several teams,
the event marks the beginning of their respective 2006
campaigns, and teams use the competition to gauge
themselves against the rest of the conference.
While both the men's and women's teams have
more than 100 athletes, only 40 of them will be allowed
to travel with each team.
About 75 percent of the roster is set, with the rest of
the spots fluctuating from week to week. Even last sea
son's NCAA discus champion Michael Robertson is
unsure of his status.
"I sort of see myself on the bubble (of making the
traveling team)," Robertson said. When asked why a
national champion would be worried about making
the team, Robertson responded,"lndoor track doesn't
have discus."
Robertson hopes to make the team in the shotput
and hammer.
One of the biggest differences between indoor and
