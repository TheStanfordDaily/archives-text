## Indoor season challenges begin at UW 
### ISRAEL ROJAS 
Stanford's 2006 track season begins this weekend at
Washington's Dempsey Indoor facility. In what is now
the fifth annual UW Invitational, athletes look to es
tablish their position on the traveling squad.
UW plays host to some of the top programs from
across the Pacific 10 Conference. For several teams,
the event marks the beginning of their respective 2006
campaigns, and teams use the competition to gauge
themselves against the rest of the conference.
While both the men's and women's teams have
more than 100 athletes, only 40 of them will be allowed
to travel with each team.
About 75 percent of the roster is set, with the rest of
the spots fluctuating from week to week. Even last sea
son's NCAA discus champion Michael Robertson is
unsure of his status.
"I sort of see myself on the bubble (of making the
traveling team)," Robertson said. When asked why a
national champion would be worried about making
the team, Robertson responded,"lndoor track doesn't
have discus."
Robertson hopes to make the team in the shotput
and hammer.
One of the biggest differences between indoor and
outdoor is the size of the track. Typical indoor
tracks are 200 meters long while an outdoor
track is 400m long. This difference makes it
much harder for inexperienced indoor run
ners to do well their first time around.
Sophomore sprinter Wopamo Osaisai
mentioned rumors about the pitfalls of in
door — the tracks are usually on a platform
of some sort.
"I didn't want my first experience to be
falling off the track," he said.
Aside from the East Coast, indoor track is
fairly low-key. In the other regions, good
weather permits runners to compete out
doors, so many athletes don't experience in
door track until they get to college. Consider
ing that indoor tracks are usually harder to
run on — smaller lanes, tighter turns — its
easier to see why outdoor track captures
more national attention, among both athletes
and fans. Osaisai made sure to point that out.
"I could tell you who won [NCAA] out
doors, but I don't know who won indoors." he
said.
A long-term goal for all athletes is to hit
NCAA-qualifying times and distances. How
ever, the focus isn't given to the qualification
itself. Instead, the focus is on the event.
"I just have to focus on my race," Osaisai
said. "Like my coaches always tell me, 'As
long as you run your race, the clock will take
care of itself"'
Head coach Edrick Floreal expects his
veteran athletes to step up as leaders for this
year's squad. As a senior, Robertson will have
his share of responsibilities.
Before transferring to the Farm last sea
son, Robertson was the youngest member of
his track squad and wasn't prepared fora
leadership role. But after his victory at last
year's NCAAs, he is ready to help the
younger guys and hopes everyone can con
tribute and help Stanford return to the top.
"We don't see ourselves as a sixth-place
team [in outdoor track]," Robertson said.
Although Stanford is more of an outdoor
track team, it has not prevented the Cardinal
from having success indoors. The women
have especially flourished, with Dempsey's
facility record book including the names of
four Stanford athletes: Janice Davis, Ashley
Purnell, Alicia Craig and Erica McLain. Both
Davis, a junior sprinter, and McLain, a soph
omore, return for another chance to improve
upon their records (Purnell and Craig gradu
ated after last season).
Because many athletes have been out of
competition fora while, this meet will be
more of an introduction to competitive oppo
nents.
"It's not too big of a meet; there's UCLA
and a few other Pac-10 schools," Robertson
said. "The meet is more to get back into the
season, see where everybody stands."
