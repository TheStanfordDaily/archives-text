# INTERMISSION TABLE OF CONTENTS
## Peace out, home fry! One of Intermission's editors says good-bye. (Except not realty, because she's just relocating to the sports desk.) 
### CALEY ANDERSON INTERMISSION-LESS 
Intermission defies categorization
and rules. We're allowed to say fuck, en
courage raunchy sex, talk to Cameron
freakin' Crowe and can write headlines
that have nothing to do with the articles.
We had a garage sale and seceded
from the Daily for pete's sake.
What 1 learned over the past four
months, however, was that as quirky
(and, yes, sometimes pretentious) we
are, we are not fluff. The articles we pro
duce are the real deal (yes, Roxy, even
you.)
. While news and ops steal all of the
street cred, writing for an A&E section is
a lot harder than it looks. You have to
find the truth in a topic that, if put in the
wrong hands, would be like whipped
frosting: tasty, but cheap and ultimately
full of empty calories.
Yet, what I read this volume was anal
ogous to rich fudge frosting — meaning
ful, delicious and satisfying. I couldn't fig
ure out how to bring the idea of uncover
ing a universal truth into the frosting
metaphor, but many of our writers found
it. Really, I spent most of the volume
being impressed.
Like many Daily staffers (and proba
bly many of you reading this) I was on my
high school's newspaper staff. I started
my first year completely oblivious to
what I was getting myself into. That 1 was

on the staff was a fluke — I had tried out
because all of my friends were.
I had never given journalism a second
thought before the group interview.
AP style? A new brand of jeans.
Slugs? Those slimy brown aliens that
shriveled when covered with salt. Photo
shop? Where you sell pictures (of what
kind is up to your discretion).
Clearly I knew nothing.
Then something funny happened: I
was accepted, none of my friends were.
And quickly I fell in love. I wrote stories
about CDs from our teachers' genera
tion, how boys prepare for prom and the
cross-country team. I laid-out center
spreads and even took photos of base
ball.
Senior year I was editor-in-chief (big
surprise — Stanford student here. If
we're not in charge, what good are we?).
The difference between the two experi
ences was immense. Suddenly I had all of
this "responsibility" and people "listened
to me".and "asked for my advice." I was
even hated by a small faction of the staff
after about three months.
It was awesome.
Working for Intermission kind of hap
pened the same way. Granted, I now go
to a private school (yes, I went to public
school, bitch!), but being an Intermission
editor was an honor that happened out of
sheer luck. And while my exiting may
seem counter to what I'm about to say,
this has been one of the best experiences

I've had at Stanford.
I need to thank Betsy first and fore
most for sticking it out with me until the
very bitter end. The beginning of the vol
ume felt like someone had dumped us
into the jungle with no map, five match
es, a machete and a friendly, "Good
luck!" Yet the journey has been ridic
amounts of unforgettable fun.
My love and gratitude goes out to
Joseph, Victor, V. Ross, Justicz, Brendan
and Camille; you six have been here for
us all volume (whether you wanted to or
not), and I'm not sure I would have sur
vived without your help and smiling
faces.
Last, but not least, I need to thank
Tam Vo for bringing me under her wing
and being there for me at all hours of the
day with unconditional support and love.
Even though your time has ended, you
are Intermission, and I am grateful you
trusted me with your baby.
What? A semi-serious article in Inter
mission? In the editor's note spot no less?
I'm sorry. It's been a long week and my
funny bone needed a rest. Though, I'm
pretty sure only three people will read
this, two of which are my parents, and
even then it's spotty. What I can promise
you, however, is next volume will un
equivocally rock.
And it is with that knowledge that 1
can leave Intermission and still sleep
soundly tonight. Well, that and the two
glasses of wine.
