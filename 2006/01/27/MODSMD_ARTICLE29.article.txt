## Fanatasy so ugly that it will make you laugh 
### KATHRYN McGARR INTERMISSION MARRY POPPINS 
Seven children with a widower father
play pranks on a series of governesses to
get attention from

Dad. Sounds like
a job for Julie <
Andrews! But J
instead of either I

Fraulein Maria *
or Mary Poppins,

the ill-behaved
Brown children get

Emma Thompson
as Nanny McPhee.

who brings her
own kind of un- .
orthodox A
magic to the

screen and

does not dis
appoint.
There's a twist to the fairytale. Mary
Poppins may dispense strawberry cough

syrup with a
spoonful of sugar,
but Nanny
McPhee's measles
medicine looks
like tar, bubbles
like hot oil and
presumably tastes
like crap. Oh, and
one other differ
ence —Nanny

McPhee has two hairy warts, a bulbous red
nose, a snaggle tooth, droopy ears and no
discernable figure.
The story takes place in make-believe
Victorian England, as most good magical
tales do. You will not recognize anything
in "Nanny McPhee," except Colin Firth's
hotness as Mr. Brown, and for this reason
you will enjoy it thoroughly.
You will use your imagination, and you
will find yourself having uncontrollable
visceral reactions along with other chil
dren in the audience. When Dad's ridicu
lous fiancee eats a worm sandwich,
you'll squirm and make "that's
gross" noises. If you have a low gag
threshold (not that I do) you'll gag, too.
You'll close your eyes when the children
eat the baby. When the wedding party
breaks out in a food fight, you'll squeal
with delight. And when there are "awww,
how sweet" moments, you'll say, "awww,
how sweet."
Best of all. you'll laugh. Mr. Brown is a
mortician, which is always hilarious. The
children are cute and comical, even that
scrawny blonde kid from "Love Actually"

who just can't catch a break from his
moms dying.
At first it might seem like the story has
no structure. Then Nanny McPhee's five
lessons are introduced. Children must go
to bed when they're told and get up when
they're told. Plus, "When you need her but
don't want her, she'll stay. When you want
her but don't need her, she must go."
Structure. Mr. Brown's crotchety aunt,
played by Angela Lansbury (who unfortu
nately got old), gives her nephew one
month to find a new wife or else she'll cut
off his allowance. Deadlines.

These lessons and deadlines make it
easy to hop on board with the plot, and
conflict, romance, pranks and merri
ment abound.
Thompson, also from "Love Actually"
(and "Much Ado About Nothing,"

"Sense and Sensibility," "Primary Col
ors," "Harry Potter," etc., etc.), wrote
the screenplay. She was daring to write
herself a looks-challenged character. I've
got to be honest — when I saw the pre-

views I didn't think I could sit
through a movie with a scary
witch-lady in the title role.
Three consolations: the
movie's good, the hairy warts
thing is only distracting right
at the beginning and she gets
prettier as the movie pro
gresses.
One concern: a bad
message. The better you be-

have, the prettier your nanny gets and the
prettier she gets, the more you want her to
stay. Fairytales generally equate goodness
with prettiness, and this is a message that I
clearly perpetuate in my concerns about
sitting through this movie. It's too late for

me, but we can
still save the

children.


Do I make you homy, baby?



"A Modest Proposal" anyone?
