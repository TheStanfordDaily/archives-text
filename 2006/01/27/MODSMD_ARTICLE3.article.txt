### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Interested in the Muslim world? Unsure of what
Islam is all about? Get ready for Islam Awareness
Month, which kicks off this Sunday with a session ap
propriately titled Islam 101.
Islam Awareness Month (lAM), sponsored by the
Muslim Student Awareness Network (MSAN) and the
Islamic Society will last until Feb. 26. Events including
speakers, dinners and documentary screenings, will "ex
pose the Stanford community to the fundamentals of
Islam and how it is practiced as a way of life," according

to MSAN Vice President Mohammad Subeh.a senior.
This year's theme is "Confronting Contemporary
Challenges: A Muslim Response to Poverty, Urban
Decay, Racism, and the Environment." Subeh ex
plained that past years have focused on hot topics in the
media, such as the treatment of women, but that this
year lAM will have a different approach. This year
"we're not being apologetic," he said.
The goal is "to raise awareness in a proactive way,
saying what we stand for rather than what we don't
stand for," junior Omar Shakir, MSAN president, said.
Junior Ahmed Ashraf, the public relations director
of MSAN, said the events focus on "introducing the re
ligion in a different way, in response to daily challenges."
The core programming for lAM consists of five
speaker presentations on Sunday evenings, followed by
dinner with cuisine from different regions of the Muslim

world. Speakers for the events are coming from across
the nation, including faculty from Georgetown and
New York University.
The first event, happening this Sunday, is "Islam 101:
Sounds of Islam" and will be a basic introduction to
Islam, covering topics such as the pillars of faith. In
donesian food will be served.
The remaining four speaker events are called "Mak
ing Poverty History: the Qur an and Compassion,"
"Confusion in Color: Uprooting Racism in our Com
munities," "Conservation in Faith: Islam and the Envi
ronment," and"In Life or Death: Islam and Bioethics."
The dinners along with the lectures will have food from
West Africa, the United States, the Middle East and
Central Asia, respectively.
