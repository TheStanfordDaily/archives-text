# Josh and Barrett Do Sundance
## The 						Barrett and Josh Guide to Sundance 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN JOSH SMITH INTERMISSION 
The Sundancc Film Festival in Park City, Utah is a lot of
things. Perhaps first and foremost, it's a delightful ego boost for
Robert Redford. He must pat himself on the back each time he con-

vinces an industry's worth of sun-loving vegan liberals to congregate in
the ice palace that is wintertime Utah.
Secondly, it's a celebration of cinema. Films with budgets big and small, in
English or Farsi, with $10 million distribution deals or a rendezvous with

oblivion, all get screened at Sundance. For the Paris Hiltons among us, Sun
dance means a time to show-off new UGGs lined with $100 bills and used con
doms. For the rest of us, Sundancc means seeing nine films in three days. It
means lining up in front of the ticket office — which opens at 8 a.m. — starting
at 10 p.m. the night before. It means walking down Main Street and seeing the

back of The Edge's head or, if you're lucky, a three-quarters profile.
Let us now raise out glasses and have a toast. To Sundance! Where
Starbucks is simultaneously an event sponsor and the subject of a doc-

umentary damning the evils of the coffee business! Where a Mor
mon enclave is transformed into West Hollywood — even if it's
one where the beer is limited to 3.2 percent alcohol per vol-

ume! Where Joshua almost got plowed down by Joe
Pantoliano looking fora bar!
Sundance, we salute you.

6:30 p.m. Arriving at the house in Park City, the
first group realizes the garage door code doesn't
work and they can't get into the house. They wait
fora maintenance guy to arrive. It's seven de
grees outside. While waiting, Jenny Maehara
throws a snowball at Barrett's ear from a foot
away. Barrett kills her and dumps her body in a
snowdrift. Tit-for-tat.

1:44 p.m. "Special" writer/director Jeremy Pass
more tells the audience this story, which sounded
vaguely like standup comedy: "So my house was
robbed last Thursday. A window was smashed,
and a bunch of my stuff was stolen. The cop
showed up and told me I looked remarkably
happy for having just been robbed. I was like,
'Shit yeah! My movie's at Sundance!"'
10:30 p.m. In a lukewarm hot tub, Lindsay Mecca
claims she wouldn't go to bone-town with Brad
Pitt. A collective "Bullshit" arises from the
steam. "I'd go to bone-town with Brad Pitt,"
Joshua avers.

4:34 p.m. Barrett and Josh see Shannon Eliza

They're under-impressed — who hasn't seen
Shannon Elizabeth naked? It's just not special
anymore.
4:50 p.m. Barrett and Josh cram their way into
the Star Bar, Sundance's music venue, to be
awed by Imogen Heap, the female half of Frou

maculate voice, Imogen proceeds to play her
band's signature "Let Go" on a mini-grand. She
follows this up with a rousing set.

then jet-setting to Utah where the loveable Sesame Street lot taught
me about all about the difficulties of getting a program aired on

Bangladeshi television. Just like the children's show at its core, "The World
According to Sesame Street" is enormously educational. The film follows the

adaptation of the universally adored show into mar
kets in Bangladesh, South Africa, and war-torn
Kosovo. Each country has a unique vision of Da
Street, including an HIV-positive muppet in South
Africa and Serb and Albanian muppets getting along

famously in the Kosovar version.
What made "The World According to
Sesame Street" so fascinating, aside from the ridicu-

lously awesome foreign muppets, was the positive
role American culture is seen playing on the in-

ternational stage. So often, both in Sundance
films, and, well, in real life, America is kind of

an asshole. But with exporting Sesame Street and reworking it
to fit other cultures, we as a society have done something

unmistakably right. Now if I only knew how to

Somebody points out that alcohol deprivation

We deliberate whether to sell the beer on Ebay

"Okay, I'm back."
"Will you take a picture with us?" we ask.
"Yes!" He lays down on our sleeping bags.
"Everyone spoon!" A picture is taken. Then, as
he's leaving, he asks if there's anything he can do
for us. "Are you cold? Do you want my scarf?"
"Uh...sure!" Barrett answers.
"Here!" He walks off.
"Wow, Barrett," Natalie says. "That's a Fendi
scarf."
"What's a Fendi scarf?" Barrett asks. #112 ,

in the late-1800s, Arthur (Huston), Charlie
(Pearce) and 14-year-old Mikey form the noto
rious Burns' Brothers Gang and are wanted for
savage crimes like rape (but not pillaging). When a

do-good British trooper captures Charlie and Mikey,
he offers the elder brother a proposition: find and kill
gang leader Arthur or allow Mikey to be hung on
Christmas day. What ensues is an odyssey of ultra-vio
lence: an aborigine's head is obliterated by a shotgun

blast; a man stomps a trooper to death; and someone gets a spear
through his chest.
Director Hillcoat wanted to authentically portray the savagery

of the outback during this era, but something tells me this
much brutality couldn't have been crammed into a nine- '

day span. The violence comes at the expense of story;
Arthur and his brother Charlie are fascinating

characters but static in their development,

and the ultimate twist comes out

"Flannel Pajamas" is a romantic drama that refreshingly refus
es to make grandiose statements about the meaning of love in favor

of a tight and realistic portrayal of a normal-ish couple. Unfortunate-

ly, both Stewart and Nicole are the type of people that would merit Jon
Stewart's high-pitched "...awkward!"

Nicole has an abusive father, an anti-Semitic mother and this weird fetish
about her own pee. Stewart is an emotionally devoid, self-indulgent bastard
who likes to pass as generous. Neither character merits any kind of empathy,
and the voyeuristic nature of the direction makes "Flannel Pajamas" down
right hard to watch at some points.

Though the film has its moments, and a pretty soundtrack, Stewart and
Nicole aren't interesting or likable enough to merit such a close look —

a look, I might add, that includes plenty of extended full-frontal nudi
ty. That icky feeling the lead actors must have gotten doing Q and

A in front of 300 people who had just seen them fully naked

was the same one we'd had for the preceding two hours.

There were times during "The Science of Sleep" that you almost made me forget
"Eternal Sunshine." Garcia Bernal plays a shy, quirky French-Mexican that mixes up his
dreams and reality. I saw through you, Michel, and I recognized this conceit as an excuse

"Wrestling with Angels"
has led to me to believe. Just

like his audience at Sundance,
the man who penned "Angels

in America,"and more recently
the screenplay for "Munich," is

the epitome of the liberal elite. This homosexual, Jewish, New York
intellectual wouldn't stand for the Pledge of Allegiance in high
school, and now in his 40s, keeps himself busy speaking at Yasser's

graduation ("I am here to be political") and being amazingly ar
ticulate and poignant at massive anti-war protests. "Wrestling
with Angels" is a flattering look at a true artist, one who is

very worth the praise director Freida Lee Mock heaps

upon him. Unfortunately, Mock's film isn't nearly as
