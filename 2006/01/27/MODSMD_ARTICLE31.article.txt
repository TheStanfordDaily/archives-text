### CALEY ANDERSON INTERMISSION ONE-ACT WONDER 
Most festivals — music, theater, dance — can often be roller
coasters of disjunction. Some acts will be engaging and inspiring
while others fall flat. Individual participants will leave an im
pression on the departing audience, but on the whole the festival
will not have achieved a unifying theme or purpose.
Last year's Original Winter One-Acts fell into the roller
coaster category. The three one-acts had no common threads,
and while it would be boring if each play were the same, the lack
of cohesiveness left us wanting, and expecting, more out of the
production.
Fortunately, experiencing this year's one-acts was a smooth
ride. The three selections complemented each other, finding
common ground in comedy. Each play was student written-, di
rected, produced, designed and acted in, and each used differ
ent aspects of the comedy genre to create insightful characters
and jokes that had the audience in Pigott Theater giggling at
times, snickering at others and thoroughly enjoying themselves
this past weekend.
"The Calling of St. Matthew," written by sophomore Andrew
Burmon and directed by junior Hollis Moore, explored the rela
tionship between a father and son during their trip to Rome. Fresh-

man Yoni Teitelbaum shone as the father, his
"old man" shuffle was effective and he han
dled the one-liners with aplomb. He conveyed
the father's struggles with his newly adult son
with maturity far beyond the typical college
student. Unfortunately John Gustafson (an

undergraduate who is not on Facebook and
therefore we don't know his grade) seemed
less comfortable with the dialogue, and his

performance came across as awkward and
forced, losing much of the emotional
I punch along the way.

Junior Ashley Brewer stole the show
in"The Waiting Room" (written by
senior Chris Ryan and directed by
sophomore Aaron Berg). She ef-

fectively portrayed Sunny Rose, a
woman stuck in a doctor's waiting
room that quickly evolves into a

Scene from"The Twilight Zone." The comedy came in the unex
pected quirks each of the periphery characters displayed: the
nurse walking in the background while wearing a space helmet;
her husband robot ically reading an invisible magazine; a fellow
patient who won't stop staring at her. Brewer's shift from anger

to confusion to righteousness was effortless, and her perfor
mance made up for the moments when the writing tried too hard
to be off-the-wall and vague.
"Devils in a Blue Dress," written by graduate student Dan
Bentley and directed by sophomore Paz Hilfinger-Pardo, ended
the show. The idea behind the one-act was creative — that dif
ferent actresses portray the different sides of the girl, literally
slipping in and out of character by putting on a blue dress — but
the dialogue tried too hard in places to be "deep." The myriad ac
tresses handled their respective roles well, but the show belonged
to junior Gabe Bombara. His portrayal of a guy attempting to
navigate the shifting moods of his girlfriend was eerily real. Many
of the scenes were uncomfortable to watch because they could
just as easily have happened to you or me.
For all the criticism I gave the dialogue, "Devils" receives the
Funniest Line Award. After showing up at his dorm room drunk
and sopping wet, "Girl" hugs "Guy" (neither has a name), and
then quickly retreats, sobbing, "I forgot — you're a computer
person! You don't like water!" "Guy" quickly responds, "It's the
computer that doesn't like water. We don't like sunlight."
Even though all three one-acts ended on serious notes, the
humor found in lines like that was more characteristic of the
evening and hopefully the future direction of Original Winter
One-Acts.


I believe I can fly...
