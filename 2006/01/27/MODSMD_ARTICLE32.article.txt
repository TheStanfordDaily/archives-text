# Poisoning Intermission staff: 'Poisoned Palms' is an adventure in badness
## 
### SETH SHAMBAN INTERMISSION MR. GREEN 
Just because you're playing Clue doesn't mean you're
having a good time. Too many players, too many clues and a
complete lack of creative murder weapons makes for

figuring out who killed High Chancellor Pewter
smith in the powder room with a Q-tip. No

matter how suspenseful fictionalized murder
ought to be, it can, nevertheless, let down

C 7 ' ' *
even the most easily thrilled and ex
citable players.

"Poisoned Palms: The Murder of
Jane Lathrop Stanford," by Dorothea

N. Buckingham, retells the story of
the death of our university's

foremother. Most
—«► students re-

main unaware that the woman whose body lies in the Mau
soleum did not necessarily die a natural death. While she was
a horrendously obese woman getting on in her years — and
probably taking far too much "Women's Helper Tonic" —
Buckingham postulates that any number of avaricious people
surrounding the woman referred to as "Lallah" by her friends
was really removed from this plane of existence by an unfor
tunately lazy poison.
But who could have poisoned her? Was it her assistant,
Mrs. Benson? Her awful, money-grubbing brother desper
ately lusting after his inheritance? Or someone on the is
land, simply trying to make a quick score of her $75,000
travel-size jewelry collection? If Mrs. Stanford's stupen
dously sly slayer had used a good, old-fashioned batch of
hemlock, Buckingham's tale might have been much easier
to swallow.

In order to keep a reader "guessing till the end," as the

back cover promises, a tale must hook its audience. Based
on the frustratingly superficial coverage she offers of the
characters, and the wholly uninterested narrator who fre
quently pauses from narrating this SUSPENSEFUL
STORY OF INTEREST to give the reader a history les-

son, Buckingham sat at her desk and thought to herself,
l"I just cannot absolutely refuse to put out any bait A

# _ - -j | —
for my readers."
L. I'm easily won over as a reader — for

a Stanford student, I'm positively uncultured and illiterate —
but Buckingham unsuccessfully makes this a tale 1 want to
commit to. She fails to take advantage of the fantastic poten
tial of Hawaii as the story's setting. Instead of being a com
pelling, exotic world, Hawaii appears to be quite boring.

Characters feel one-dimensional and stagnant, rather

than vital and having volume in some

quantity. One great character

can carry a reader through

almost anything. But as it

stands, one should

only read "Poisoned

Palms" in order to

sympathize
with my pain.
