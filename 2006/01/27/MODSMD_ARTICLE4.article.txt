# MODERN ETHICS
## Corporate social responsibility issues debated 
### ANDREA FULLER STAFF WRITER 
At a time when Enron has become a dirty word
and lobby scandals have made recent headlines, the
Stanford Law Schools' corporate social responsibility
lecture last Thursday night raised the challenging
moral issues that corporations face.
David Luban, Haas Professor of Law and Philoso
phy at Georgetown University, and Patrick Byrne,
founder of Overstock.com, led the discussion. Luban
is a visiting professor at Stanford.
The Stanford Center on Ethics and the Ethics in
Society Program co-sponsored the event. Director of
the Stanford Center on Ethics Lawrence Quill
noted the popularity of such programs on ethics.
"We chose to sponsor the event because corpo
rate social responsibility is a subject of increasing
interest for scholars and corporation," he said.
"The Center co-hosted a similar event with the
GSB last year with David Vogel from UC-Berke
ley, who has just written a book called 'The Market
for Virtue' on this subject."
Quill championed the format of the program.
"It is useful to have a practitioner talk about
corporate social responsibility and to approach it
theoretically as well," he said. "We also try to en
courage a dialogue format in discussions of this
kind rather than formal presentations. The goal of
the program is to include students and faculty in an
interdisciplinary discussion about corporate social
responsibility."
Luban said that his interest in Byrne's work
motivated him to participate in the event.
"I wanted to do it because of Patrick Byrne," he
said. "I've been particularly impressed with his ef

forts to start Worldstock. At the same time, Patrick
and I have very different overall outlooks, which
we have debated for years. When Prof. Deborah
Rhode suggested the dual event, I was delighted at
the opportunity to continue our discussion in pub
lic."
Luban said the goal of the talk was to present
his philosophical notions along with Byrne's real
istic experience.
"I wanted to surface some very basic questions
of applied moral philosophy," he said. "What does
social responsibility mean in the context of busi
ness? Why should a business be socially responsi
ble rather than single-mindedly pursuing profit
maximization? But then I want to try to tap into
the insights of someone who is actually running an
important business, to see if we can make some of
these rather abstract questions concrete."
Byrne and Luban began by debating the ration
ale of corporate social responsibility, what Luban
defined as sacrificing profit maximization for the
benefit of another party. Byrne argued that corpo-

Industry ethics under consideration

rations can see themselves as serving a social
cause, though they may actually be hurting people.
"Just seeking profits makes you socially re
sponsible," he said. "By the invisible hand, you will
do the most good for society. It's false to say you're
going to be socially responsible by changing pric
ing. If you don't let the market set prices for itself,
you may be disrupting it."
Luban disagreed with this perspective and
pointed out how Byrne has shown enormous re
sponsibility in the founding of Worldstock, a com
pany that champions building a humane work
place and allows artisans in the developing world
to bring their products to market and achieve eco
nomic self-reliance.
"I'm not nearly committed enough to that phi
losophy that I'm willing to follow through," Byrne
said. "It's a big question — How do I square that
idea with my own work? My argument though is
that we've adopted these socially responsible poli
cies from the beginning, so investors know what
they're getting into."
Byrne championed the socially responsible
principles upon which Worldstock is founded.
"1 was in Cambodia visiting the artisans," he
said."lt has a lot of landmine survivors who get re
trained as potters and weavers. We focus on
women and disabled artisans. About 60 to 70 per
cent of what you spend goes back to the artisans.
We're not trying to make any money on this."
However, Byrne noted that this corporation
still faced morally ambiguous social issues. World
stock allows child labor for less than two hours a
day, coupled with mandatory schooling, because
such labor occurs in the home rather than the fac
tories.
"It's a blurry world," he concluded.
Luban said that honesty is the most important
issue in corporate ethics today.
"Quite frankly, the most important thing in cor
porate ethics in the post-Enron era is nothing
fancy," he said in an interview with The Daily. "It is
elementary honesty in a business environment
where the incentives to crookedness are great."
The talk drew a group of students and faculty
with diverse backgrounds. Luba Gloukhov, a soph
omore at Foothill Community College, attended
the talk out of interest.
"I've always been interested in the subject," she
said."l'm an econ and math major so I've been in
terested in corporate social responsibility and how
you maintain that in a capitalist system. I agreed
with the 'blurry world' concept."
Jon Dolle, a doctoral student in education, at
tended the talk because of its relevance to interna
tional issues.
"My interest is just generally in international
development and compensation for low-age
workers," he said. "Byrne is a remarkable model
and he's somebody who acts on principle. It's very
remarkable."

rate social responsibility is a subject of increasing
interest for scholars and corporation," he said.
"The Center co-hosted a similar event with the
GSB last year with David Vogel from UC-Berke
ley, who has just written a book called 'The Market
for Virtue' on this subject."
Quill championed the format of the program.
"It is useful to have a practitioner talk about
corporate social responsibility and to approach it
theoretically as well," he said. "We also try to en
courage a dialogue format in discussions of this
kind rather than formal presentations. The goal of
the program is to include students and faculty in an
interdisciplinary discussion about corporate social
responsibility."
Luban said that his interest in Byrne's work
motivated him to participate in the event.
"I wanted to do it because of Patrick Byrne," he
said. "I've been particularly impressed with his ef

forts to start Worldstock. At the same time, Patrick
and I have very different overall outlooks, which
we have debated for years. When Prof. Deborah
Rhode suggested the dual event, I was delighted at
the opportunity to continue our discussion in pub
lic."
Luban said the goal of the talk was to present
his philosophical notions along with Byrne's real
istic experience.
"I wanted to surface some very basic questions
of applied moral philosophy," he said. "What does
social responsibility mean in the context of busi
ness? Why should a business be socially responsi
ble rather than single-mindedly pursuing profit
maximization? But then I want to try to tap into
the insights of someone who is actually running an
important business, to see if we can make some of
these rather abstract questions concrete."
Byrne and Luban began by debating the ration
ale of corporate social responsibility, what Luban
defined as sacrificing profit maximization for the
benefit of another party. Byrne argued that corpo-

Industry ethics under consideration

rations can see themselves as serving a social
cause, though they may actually be hurting people.
"Just seeking profits makes you socially re
sponsible," he said. "By the invisible hand, you will
do the most good for society. It's false to say you're
going to be socially responsible by changing pric
ing. If you don't let the market set prices for itself,
you may be disrupting it."
Luban disagreed with this perspective and
pointed out how Byrne has shown enormous re
sponsibility in the founding of Worldstock, a com
pany that champions building a humane work
place and allows artisans in the developing world
to bring their products to market and achieve eco
nomic self-reliance.
"I'm not nearly committed enough to that phi
losophy that I'm willing to follow through," Byrne
said. "It's a big question — How do I square that
idea with my own work? My argument though is
that we've adopted these socially responsible poli
cies from the beginning, so investors know what
they're getting into."
Byrne championed the socially responsible
principles upon which Worldstock is founded.
"1 was in Cambodia visiting the artisans," he
said."lt has a lot of landmine survivors who get re
trained as potters and weavers. We focus on
women and disabled artisans. About 60 to 70 per
cent of what you spend goes back to the artisans.
We're not trying to make any money on this."
However, Byrne noted that this corporation
still faced morally ambiguous social issues. World
stock allows child labor for less than two hours a
day, coupled with mandatory schooling, because
such labor occurs in the home rather than the fac
tories.
"It's a blurry world," he concluded.
Luban said that honesty is the most important
issue in corporate ethics today.
"Quite frankly, the most important thing in cor
porate ethics in the post-Enron era is nothing
fancy," he said in an interview with The Daily. "It is
elementary honesty in a business environment
where the incentives to crookedness are great."
The talk drew a group of students and faculty
with diverse backgrounds. Luba Gloukhov, a soph
omore at Foothill Community College, attended
the talk out of interest.
"I've always been interested in the subject," she
said."l'm an econ and math major so I've been in
terested in corporate social responsibility and how
you maintain that in a capitalist system. I agreed
with the 'blurry world' concept."
Jon Dolle, a doctoral student in education, at
tended the talk because of its relevance to interna
tional issues.
"My interest is just generally in international
development and compensation for low-age
workers," he said. "Byrne is a remarkable model
and he's somebody who acts on principle. It's very
remarkable."
