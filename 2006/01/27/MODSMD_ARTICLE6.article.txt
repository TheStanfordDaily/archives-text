### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
Faculty Senate Chairs Edward Harris Jr. and Eric Roberts sat
before the 38th Senate of the Academic Council yesterday to dis
cuss an array of items. Room 18() in the Law School was half full but
spirited discussion was nevertheless maintained.
The meeting opened with the unanimous approval of both the
list of Candidates for Baccalaureate Degrees and the 19 page list of
Candidates for Advanced degrees.The Senate then proposed me
morial resolutions to community members Marvin Chodorow
(1931-2005) and Mary V. Sunseri (1916-2003). Both were adopted
and followed by a moment of silence.
The Steering committee reported that is has been working to
create agendas for both the remainder of this quarter and the entire
ty of spring quarter.This has been difficult due to various scheduling
conflicts. Research administration software has been introduced
and is reportedly very successful.
The venerated Committee on
Committees made a presentation
about the challenges facing various
Stanford committees. Ihey are con
cerned about the recent assault on the
validity of research apparently going
on nationwide. Through the steering
committee. Stanford plans to create a
public policy panel that will assist the
University in these new developments.
The committee is currently seeking
members to fill this panel.
Additionally, a new child care policy
went into effect yesterday which,
among other provisions, offered preg
nant female graduate students a respite
from University TA and RA duties.
Undergraduate Provost John
Etchemendy will undertake programs
to improve graduate student diversity,
fund a summer institute similar to the
undergraduate sophomore college
and strengthen the graduate student
mentorship program.
"It was great to hear President
Hennessy address graduate student
concerns," said ASSU President
Melanie Kannokada, a senior. "I was
glad to hear him address diversity and
mentoring issues."
Last night marked the beginning of
a new feature for the senate as the aca
demic program in archaeology went
under review for the renewal of its de
gree-nominating authority. After a

brief discussion about the merits of
such a small program, the senate unan
imously moved to renew the authority
to the archaeology program. In the fol
lowing weeks the senate will review
similar interdisciplinary programs,
some of which are not expected to pass
so easily.
To finish off the night, Larry Gibbs
issued a report on the emergency pre
paredness of Stanford University. Ac
cording to Gibbs, the University is tak
ing major steps in order to secure itself
in case of a major disaster, similar in
scope to Hurricane Katrina. Gibbs
showed senate members a compre
hensive PowerPoint presentation out
lining the steps his team had taken to
improve the readiness of Stanford.
'After the 1906 earthquake," Gibbs
reminded senators. "Stanford had to
increase faculty salaries 60 percent in
order to keep teachers and administra
tors from leaving."
"It's about time we had another
one." quipped an unidentified repre
sentative. "Bring it on." The chamber
erupted with laughter.
On a more serious note Gibbs re
ported that all buildings on campus
have been retrofitted for earthquakes,
all undergraduate residences have
been equipped with fire sprinklers and
emergency generators had been in
stalled in "critical buildings." Stanford
is, according to Gibbs. very safe but
there are certainly aspects that need
improvement.
"This is basically business as usual
at the Faculty Senate meeting " Kan
nokada explained. "It's all fairly rou
tine."
