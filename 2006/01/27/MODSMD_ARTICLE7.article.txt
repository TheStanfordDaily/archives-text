## Texas prof criticizes biased journalism Media coverage on the Middle East thought to be insufficient 
### JAMES HOHMANN WORLD NATION EDITOR 
The American media has failed in its cover
age of the Middle East, a University of Texas
journalism professor told students last night.
"There are consistent failures in the media,
especially in covering U.S. foreign policy as it
relates to the Middle East" said Prof. Robert
Jensen in his speech at the Language Corner
sponsored by the Coalition for Justice in the
Middle East. "There is lots of reporting on
Brad and Jolie, but it's very hard apparently to
write about things that might lead to the de-

struction of the planet."
"Everybody hates the media," he said."The problem is that
everybody does not hate the news media for the right reasons."
Jensen said that the corporate structure and commercial na
ture of the news media has made it beholden to advertisers. He
said journalists too often let sources in positions of power and


Swanson
authority shape the angle and direc
tion of their coverage. He also com
plained that American journalists
have a predisposed bias to support
capitalism and democracy.
Jensen said the news media
should be judged on its ability to be
an independent source of factual in
formation, provide historical and so
cial context to make sense of facts
and offer the widest coverage from
all possible opinions.
"On the Middle East, there are
specific ideological blinders," he
said."lf you have an idea that has not
been considered by the Republicans
or Democrats, then it is considered
out of the mainstream by reporters."
In a speech replete with jokes
about Texas, President George W.
Bush, American culture and well
known news figures, he singled out
New York Times reporter Judith
Miller and CNN broadcaster Aaron
Brown as symbols of what he called
larger, underlying institutional prob
lems in the press.
"Aaron Brown is a pseudo-intel
lectual goof ball," he said, after citing
a recent defense the correspondent
made of his network for giving more
coverage to Hurricane Katrina than
an anti-war protest.
"The problem with the U.S. news
coverage of the anti-war movement
is not that they do not cover the
movement," he said."The problem is
that they do not cover the reasons
we are protesting."
Jensen said that the development
of 24-hour cable news networks has
made matters worse. He complained
that virtually all the guests on these
shows share the same basic frame
work for thinking — even if they are
from different parties.
"It's a great struggle to say any
thing meaningful on those shows,"
he said. "If you get a chance to say
something coherent for seven sec
onds, it feels like you have found the
New Jerusalem."
He called television news "a toxic
waste dump" and offered — "I am a
journalism professor who does not
have a television in his home."
"There has never been a culture
that knows as little about the world
as this one," he said of what he la
beled an "insular" modern-day

America.
Jensen offered a three-part strat
egy to respond to what he called an
out of touch news media. He said
that progressives should engage the
media, critique coverage and push
for a more democratic new media.
"In a mass media world where
people experience the world prima
rily through the media, if we do not
win this fight, it is going to be diffi
cult to make progressive political
gains anywhere else," he said."If you
have progressive political ideals, en
gage the news media on their terms
and their turf."
The former professional journal
ist said that increased unionization
for reporters would "give working
journalists some control over their
own work."
"Sometimes journalists know the
truth, and they do not want to write
it out of fear," he said.
He also called for a stronger pub
lic broadcasting system and the ex
pansion of dissident alternative
media sources.
Jensen received an overwhelm
ingly favorable reaction from a
friendly partisan audience.
Coalition for Justice in the Mid
dle East co-President and junior his
tory major Olivia Sohns called his
speech clear and organized.
"Investigative journalism is lack
ing in a big way, and it is hard to hold
journalists accountable," she said.
"This speech really calls me to ques
tion where the media has been."
"He put the whole situation in a
lively context," said junior econom
ics major Tala Alramahi. "Now that
the United States is in Iraq, we real
ly need to critique the news we see
and not just take it for granted."
Several of the approximately 70
audience members came from
around the Bay Area after they
heard about the event through the
left-leaning,anti-war group Peninsu
la Peace and Justice.
"This reminded me that we all
have been indoctrinated into the ex
isting world system," said group
member Peter Bickford of Moun
tain View. "Listening reminds me of
my reactions when I was younger
about how messed up the whole sys
tem is."
This was Jensen's second speech at
the University in as many days. He
spoke Wednesday night about the
detrimental effects of pornography in
a presentation sponsored by the Stan
ford Women's Community Center.
