## Hamas win majority in parliamentary elections 
### RAVI NESSMAN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
(AP) — Islamic militant Hamas' land
slide victory in Palestinian elections un
nerved the world Thursday, darkening
prospects for Mideast peace and ending
four decades of rule by the corruption-rid
dled Fatah Party.
The parliamentary victory stunned
even Hamas leaders, who mounted a well
organized campaign but have no experi
ence in government. They offered to
share power with President Mahmoud
Abbas, the Fatah chief, who said he may
go around the new government to talk
peace with Israel.
Underscoring the tensions between the
secular Fatah and fundamentalist Hamas,
some 3.000 supporters of the militant group
marched through Ramallah and raised
their party's green flag over the Palestinian
parliament. Fatah supporters tried to lower
the banner. The two sides fought for about
30 minutes, throwing stones and breaking
windows in the building.
Abbas, who was elected last year to a
four-year term as president of the Palestin
ian Authority, has yet to decide how close
ly to work with a group that built its clout
through suicide bombings. But his Fatah
Party decided not to join a Hamas govern
ment, Fatah legislator Saab Erekat said.
"We will be a loyal opposition and re
build the party," Erekat said after meeting
with Abbas.
Hamas won a clear majority in
Wednesday's vote, capturing 76 of the 132
seats in parliament, according to official,
near-complete results released Thursday.
The results of the popular vote were not
announced.
Four independent candidates backed
by Hamas also won seats. Fatah, which has
dominated Palestinian political life since
the 1960s but alienated voters because of
rampant corruption, got 43 seats. The re
maining went to smaller parties.

Palestinians across the Gaza Strip and
West Bank greeted the election results
with joy.setting off fireworks and firing ri
fles in the air.
But leaders across the world demand
ed that Hamas, which is branded a terror
group by the U.S. and European Union,
renounce violence and recognize Israel.
"If your platform is the destruction of
Israel, it means you're not a partner in
peace, and we're interested in peace,"
President Bush said in Washington.
Acting Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Olmert said Israel will not negotiate with
a Palestinian government that includes
Hamas members, and senior Cabinet offi
cials held an emergency meeting to discuss
the repercussions of the vote. Acting For
eign Minister Tzipi Livni asked the EU
not to deal with a "terror government."
Hamas leaders immediately took to
the international — and even Israeli —
airwaves to send out a moderate message.
"Don't be afraid," Ismail Haniyeh. a
Hamas leader, told the BBC.
Mahmoud Zahar, another Hamas
leader, said the group would extend its
year-old truce if Israel reciprocates. "If
not, then I think we will have no option
but to protect our people and our land,"
he said.
At a victory news conference late
'Thursday, however, Haniyeh said Hamas
will "complete the liberation of other
parts of Palestine." He did not say which
territories he was referring to or how he
would go about it.
Hamas has largely adhered to the
cease-fire declared last February, while a
smaller militant group. Islamic Jihad, car
ried out six suicide bombings against Is
raelis during that period.
Abbas said he remained committed to
peace talks and suggested they be con
ducted through the Palestine Liberation
Organization rather than the Palestinian
Authority. That could help him sidestep a
Hamas-run government in peace talks.

"I am committed to implementing the
program on which you elected me a year
ago," he said in a televised speech. "It is a
program based on negotiations and
peaceful settlement with Israel."
Prime Minister Ahmed Qureia and his

Cabinet resigned to make room fora
Hamas-led government.
The Islamic group quickly reached out
to Abbas to try to work out a partnership,
Haniyeh said, adding that he did not ex
pect the Palestinian leader to resign.
