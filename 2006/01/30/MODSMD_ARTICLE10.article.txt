## xin inán kuàilè! The 						history behind Chinese New Year tradition Written by Robbie Yan 
### 
Chinese New Year arrived yester
day, marking the first day of a year on
the lunar calendar.
Legend has it that a Chinese emperor invented
the lunar calendar to synchronize with phase
changes of the moon. The moon completes its
phase shift in a 29.5-day cycle, so each lunar month
is allotted either 29 or 30 days. It turns out. howev
er, that 12 lunar months do not completely cover
the 365.242 days that make up a year — the Earth's
revolution period around the sun.
To fill this gap, the emperor established an elab
orate system that involves leap months — extra
months that occur once every two to three years.
This way, roughly seven in every 19 years have 13
months each.
In comparison, the most widely-used calendar
today — the Gregorian calendar — proposes a
much simpler solution to this problem. But it relin
quishes synchronization with the moon's phase
changes by stuffing extra days into each lunar
month and adding one day to the calendar every
four years.
Folk tales gave rise to the concept of a year,
which translates to the word "man" in Chinese.
About 4,0()0 years ago, a tribe of animals more
powerful and voracious than lions and tigers
roamed the northeast plain of China.These animals
were called nian, and it is said that they only sought
food at the end of winter season.They would attack
humans and devour their cattle.
With time, people discovered that these mon
sters feared one thing — fire. So when winter was
almost over, people would burn and pop firecrack
ers to scare nians away. They called this activity

"nians' depar
ture," which became

the modern-day expression
"departure of the year." Though
nians are nowhere to be found today, the Chinese
still maintain the tradition of burning firecrackers
at this time of year.
The Chinese have established other traditions to
celebrate the new year. For example, young people
kneel in front of their elders to receive red pockets
— or little red envelopes — which contain money
to buy snacks and toys. Families gather to make
dumplings, because their wrapped-up shape con
notes togetherness. People also dress up and per
form "lion dances" and "dragon dances" in the
street.
Finally, people post two stretches of calligraphy
works termed spring couplets — one on each side
of their doors. Chinese characters on the right cou
plet must complement their corresponding charac
ters on the left couplet in meaning and style. And
both couplets must express blessings for the new
year. Sometimes, it's more challenging to write a
new couplet than a structured poem.
This year is a year of the dog, according to the

Chinese zodiac, which consists of 12 animals — the
rat. the ox, the tiger, the rabbit, the dragon, the
snake, the horse, the sheep, the monkey, the rooster,
the dog and the pig. Some say that many Chinese
elders remember the zodiac sign of their birth years
to more easily recall their ages.
Stanford students this year celebrated the Lunar
New Year in various ways. The Association of Chi
nese Students and Scholars at Stanford hosted a
celebration party in the Arrillaga Alumni Center
last Wednesday. Performers at the party included
members of Stanford Wushu and dancers from the
San Jose Yao Yong Dance School, an organization
that tries to educate communities about traditional
Chinese dance. The Taiwanese Cultural Society
held a "Night Market" event where students shared
Asian cuisines and traditions such as Chinese yo-yo
and origami.
Confucius once remarked, "time flies by, just
like this flowing body of water." Let's hope and
strive for the best this new vear.
