# The
						emotional hookup manifesto
## 
### 
Last night 1 hooked up.There was no alcohol
or nudity, just a random discussion with a
perfect stranger. When I gave my friend
Aaron the play-by-play the next morning, we
came to the following conclusion:
Many weekend mornings, a disheveled herd of
students roams the campus in search of their dorms.
As they replay the events of the previous night,
marks appear on a mental tally of what clothes were
removed, what bases were rounded and so forth.
The score-keeping often focuses on physical events
and their outcomes â€” somewhat less often does
one consider the emotional hookups they experi
ence. These are the fleeting conversations where
the barriers we as Stanford students have so clever
ly constructed are left unguarded. Emotional
hcx)kups are rampant on this campus and should be
reflected on with the same care we give (or should
give) our physical interactions.
Freshman year, we use our initially reserved
yet curious dorm-mates for emotional and intel
lectual experimentation. At this point, the excite
ment of finding a new self in the college environ
ment has never been so tangible. But as we grow
older and the opportunity to reinvent oneself
fades, there emerges an urgency to reaffirm our
individuality and character.
These are the nights when we want to be ap
preciated for our uniqueness, and thus we enter
the unstable yet irresistible arena of emotional
hookups. Small talk is the innocent brushing and
tickling, leading up to a suddenly deeper and un
expected question, like the first exploratory' kiss
of the evening. Emotional clothes come off as
your partner asks what you are truly afraid of in
life, and you feel surprisingly comfortable telling
her. Eventually there is the terrible yet fascinat
ing realization that he might actually understand
you, and that the "you" once guarded by witty
Facebook quotes and flirty smiles is suddenly in a
place to be attacked and simultaneously rescued
by a complete stranger.
Emotional hookups, like their physical coun
terparts, can be cause for a nervous 10 a.m. call to
Vaden. When someone doesn't 1M the next day
after really caring for you in the sweaty corner
behind the DJ table, you feel a sense of betrayal
and abashed humiliation. Similarly, if the people
we open up to suddenly disappear, we can feel
disoriented and empty. The vulnerability persists
both in the physical and emotional realms, mak
ing the one-night stand charged with infinite
promise and peril.
As Stanford students, we desperately crave
emotional connections so that we can shed our
loner personas like a black lace thong. The con
versations that let us flirt with these feelings of
closeness are sometimes found in the most un
likely places. A friend you didn't know too well
suddenly sees something in you that you wish oth
ers did too. The guy sitting across from you likes
you for what you think are the right reasons and
not why everyone else seems to.These feelings do
not spontaneously materialize but are birthed
through the lowering of emotional and personal
defenses. As our campaign to "be me" wears on
after four years, the opportunity to throw caution
to the wind and carelessly let someone in has
never seemed so ripe and appealing.
Botched hookups happen, physical and emo
tional alike. The way our bodies yearn for atten
tion, so do our selves cry out for someone to ac
knowledge them, encouraging us to make bold
choices in what we say and do.This is not at all to
suggest that emotional hookups are by nature un
healthy. On the contrary, they can make for some
of the most singularly wonderful nights of our
lives. But like any responsible student looking to
score, please practice safe emotional hooking up.
Go ahead, get emotionally drunk, dance on
the table and see who catches your eye. Maybe
you'll take them home and subject yourself to the
danger and beauty of going all the way.
