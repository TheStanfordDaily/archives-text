# WCC to host gender dialogue, tea on Friday
## 
### JESSAMYN EDRA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Gender is most easily understood as a
continuum with masculinity on one endpoint
and femininity on the other," says junior Re
nata Sanchez."But both sides being unobtain
able. We all exist somewhere on this continual
line, and our spot on the line changes daily."
The Women's Community Center's Gen
der Dialogue Program will challenge students
on Friday, Feb. 3 to find their spot on the line
and talk about how this ever-changing con
cept called gender affects race, stereotypes,
the community and activism. Senior Vijaya
TYipathi, the program's coordinator, will lead
the discussion, which is the second event in

the WCC's Gender Dialogue tea series.
Before you can discuss how gender affects
portions of your life, you must have some no
tion of what gender is. Some say that gender is
more than just biological.
"Very little of what we consider gender is
based on biology," freshman Katie Frank com
ments. "Gender is performed in daily activities
— women wearing makeup and speaking in
higher-pitched voices, men fixing cars and
speaking in lower-pitched voices, for example."
But when filling out official forms, gender
is limited to two boxes — male or female.
According to IVipathi, each event in the
tea series starts with a definition of both bio
logical gender and social gender in order to
frame and enhance the discussion.

"Nowadays, people throw around the
word 'gender' quite often, but we are very
rarely provided with an actual definition,
which means we may be using the word incor
rectly, or at least not understanding it fully,"
Tripathi says.
While it's important for both males and fe
males to become educated about these issues,
the male to female turnout was about one to
four at the last Tea Series event, according to
Tripathi.
It's possible that fewer males attended be
cause the event was held at the Women's Com
munity Center,coordinators say. But males and
females alike should feel welcome to come to
the teas, and most other events at the Center.
"(People who come] can expect an infor

mal discussion over tea and cookies, which is
really led and informed by their own experi
ences," Tripathi says. "Fundamentally, the Tea
Series seeks with each themed event to en
courage participants to consider how gender
intersects with a certain aspect of their lives."
During Friday's discussion, Tripathi will
act as facilitator and bring pertinent ideas, im
ages and words to the table. Still, she says
she'll ultimately place the discussion in the
participants' hands.
"The participants truly direct the conver
sation — ultimately, it is what they make of
it," she says.
Perhaps the same can be said about gender
— it is what a person makes of it, whether this
means following the arbitrary guidelines of

society or breaking through the biology — it
is ultimately what people themselves decide.
"Gender is a social construct, fluid and
changing along with society," Sanchez says.
Tea Series events will continue through
February and March. Topics will range from
discourses on human rights to sexuality to
rhetoric.
"The participants always learn from each
other, and I learn from them," she says.
Friday's event will be at 3 p.m. in the
Women's Community Center. All students,
men and women, are encouraged to attend —
and not just for the tea and cookies.
