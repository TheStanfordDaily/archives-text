## Editorial Grad pregnancy policy will attract students 
### 
It's not very often that University admin
istrators read our minds, but they did last
week. The Editorial Board was planning
to call for a University-wide pregnancy poli
cy for graduate students. But Prof. Gail Ma
hood, associate dean for graduate policy,
beat us to it at the Faculty Senate meeting
last Thursday when she announced a new
policy with six weeks of paid leave, automat
ic deadline extensions and a way to maintain
full-time student status.
Better yet, this isn't some policy that will
go through three committees and get
tweaked and manipulated by each individ
ual department. Instead, it's a cross-campus
policy that is effective immediately, actually
making a statement and taking a lead —
Stanford is only the second major university
to offer a policy like this (MIT was the first).
The new policy is just a first step, but it is
a big step, and the University got it right in
almost every way. By making sure it encom
passes the whole University, including pro
fessional schools and doctoral programs, the
policy avoids a piecemeal implementation.
By stating that new mothers will keep their
full-time student status, the University re
fused to take the easy way out and say that
each student needs to make her own deci
sions regarding leave requirements. And by
providing a generic six weeks of leave, the
University gives students an out that cannot
be coerced or influenced by research advis
ers, coursework demands or outside funding
sources.
The University should have gone all the

way and granted 12 weeks of leave, a policy
comparable to the Chemistry Department's
pregnancy policy and to many policies in the
private sector. But six weeks of paid leave is
pretty good and sets a baseline for depart
ments and schools to build on.
We hope that the schools within the Uni
versity create their own policies, working
with the University policy to customize ac
cording to the demands of each program. In
some cases, such as at the professional
schools, it may make the most sense to en
courage students to take a year off so that
they stay on track. Or it may be more advis
able to figure out a way — such as targeted
support services and flexible deadlines — in
which students who miss their allotted six
weeks can catch up relatively smoothly. Care
should be taken so that this new policy does
not encourage discrimination — but we are
not very concerned on that front.
The new pregnancy policy is a perfect ex
ample of how the University shouldn't be
making excuses about women in the Ph.D
pipeline when the University can do things
about it.This policy won't just attract women
who are planning to have children soon; it
will attract women — and men — who
value a true commitment to diversity.
But Stanford shouldn't view it as just a
competitive tactic, and we don't think Uni
versity administrators do. The University
should encourage other schools to join it and
MIT in implementing their own pregnancy
policies for graduate students as a means to
increase overall diversity in academia.
