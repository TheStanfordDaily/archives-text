# Screw with the government

£ £ | 1 very time you masturbate. Rove is
I—H watching"? '"Bate and Bin Laden
1 vuiinc"*> "Touching yourself = ter
rorism"? I'm trying to think of catchy slogans
for the Bush administration's campaign
against porn. Recently they have asked a fed
eral court to subpoena Google. Google re
fused to comply with the government's re
quest to randomly select searches.They claim
they are trying to figure out if people are
abiding by the Child Online Protection Act.
So basically, they are looking for child porn.
Most of us will not. therefore, be affected
by the investigations. Still, I don't know
about you, but I'm not sure I want the feder
al government to be monitoring what I view
at all. Every time I go on bigtit — ahem — 1
mean strongwilledfeministtastefullymade
portraits.com. I don't want the government
to be looking over my shoulder.
I think if Karl Rove and George W. Bush
can view what we are viewing, we should be
able to view what they are viewing. That's
why if the administration succeeds in getting
Google to turn over its results, the search en
gine should also make public the searches of
various members of the Bush administration.
It will keep things honest.
I think the public, for example, will find
Rove's fetish for exposing things interesting.
As everyone knows. Bush loves the outdoors,
but hates the environment. This contradic
tion is embodied in his fetish for female lum
berjacks.
Condi has a fetish for rich white men in
power. Duh.
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales is re
ally into "fantasies." He thinks it's really hot
when people in remote locations are
strapped to a chair, pushed around, berated
in several tongues and sometimes hit with a
phone book.
Judging by his hesitance to give soldiers in
Iraq body armor, it's no surprise Donald
Rumsfeld has a scantily-clad soldier fetish.
This would also explain his insistence that a
USO show theme be "GI Joe in Pantyhose."
Dick Cheney doesn't look at porn on the
Internet. Ever. He simply disappears for days
on end and goes to a dark unsecured location
with a crumbled up picture of Condi and...
never mind. That's classified.
All kidding aside, if you think about it, this
is a bit scary. The Patriot Act curtailed our
civil liberties; the wire taps eavesdrop on our
phones and now the government wants to
look at our porn. Is nothing sacred? As John
Locke once said,"The root of all rebellion, of
all free thought, lies in the selection of one's
adult pictures."
My bitter roommate also has a say in this.

Hung-over again, he remarked: "Great.
They've taken Nazi Germany a step further.
While the Germans wanted only blond
haired blue-eyed people, Bush can arrest
people who don't think blond-haired blue
eyed people are attractive." His girlfriend, by
the way, is blonde, so I have no idea why he's
so worried.
I'm not sure the justification for the gov
ernment's subpoena of Google is valid. Up
holding anti-child porn laws is perfectly justi
fiable, but investigating the random sam
plings of Google users? Not the best way to
do it. And where does one draw the line? If
they go after child porn today, what is to stop
backwards states like Texas — which only re
cently decriminalized sodomy — from going
after people who search for gay porn? At a
certain point, you begin to police people's
thoughts rather than their actions.The ability
to abuse this information, for the searches to
become a control mechanism, is about as
horrifying as seeing what Ann Coulter mas
turbates to.
The only thing really fascist, though,
would be to completely censor the Internet.
In communist China, you couldn't read this
column. Instead, Google would give you re
sults on "The reasons Chris Holt is bad for
the party" or "Chris Holt: Enemy of the peo
ple or harmless asshole from Jersey?" That is
to say, with Google's recent compliance with
Chinese censorship laws, they are taking the
proverbial flag of freedom and having it
shoved up their ass.
But that's not a bad thing. Think of all the
things the Chinese won't have to put up with.
It's like that AOL commercial: Spam?
Blocked. Viruses? Thwarted. Porn? Deleted.
Free speech? Hunted down and squelched
by the secret police.
While fighting one "overreaching"
regime, you lose any moral high ground by
then aiding an even more intrusive regime.

Chris thinks Google's compliance with the
Chinese government is even sadder when we
realize that MSN.com and Yahoo have already
decided that money is more important than in
tegrity or free speech. Send complaints to
