# A
						war against yourself

### 
We human beings have the capacity
to trick ourselves into believing
something false or illogical when
we want to believe it. In politics, for example,
we tend to buy into our favored candidate's
policy' program even if we know that it is
economically unfeasible. Alternatively, even
after it became clear that Iraq did not have
weapons of mass destruction, the vast major
ity of Bush supporters, including the highly
educated ones, asserted that Iraq did possess
WMDs.
But nowhere do we play more cognitive
tricks with ourselves than in dieting and
weight loss. I remember laughing hysterically
with my sister after she showed me a maga
zine ad for a "body sculpting" product called
"Transbustyl." The supposed effect of the
product was to transfer grease from the but
tocks to the breasts — hence the "transbust"
part of the name — through some magical
process, the details of which were not provid
ed. The laughter increased when my sister
and I envisioned what would happen if the
grease got stuck in mid-journey, somewhere
around the abdomen area.
The magazine my sister found the ad in
was not Cosmo, Seventeen, Fitness, or any

other body-and-look-oriented magazine. It
was just your general weekend magazine.
Although the ad was much more far
fetched than most, we are surrounded by
ads that similarly promise miraculous ef
fects on the body. If we took just one
minute to think about their messages ob
jectively, we would realize how intellectu
ally insulting they are. Drinks and caffeine
rubs that "drain" the grease from your
thighs? Gels that will "tone" and "shape"
your bottom in a month? Who believes that
stuff?
Evidently, plenty of people, or else there
wouldn't be such a large offer of weight loss
and body sculpting products. So the interest
ing question becomes, why do we want to be
lieve that these products will work? The an

swer is partly contained in the ads. Fat and
cellulite are unacceptable.The word cellulite
is probably a top contestant in the "words
with the worst connotation" list. It is the sign
of weakness, of aging, of self-indulgence, of
failure, of unsexy motherhood. Eat greasy,
fatty, sugary foods, even just a couple of
times, and they will go straight from your
mouth to your thighs, forever implanted in
your flesh.
The foods will stay with you unless you de
cide to wage a war on the "excess" pounds,
which is the only acceptable thing to do.
There are numerous options to tackle the
problem. You can drain. You can tone. Shape.
Sculpt. Work out. Work it off. Burn it off.
Detoxify. (I've always wondered what the
toxic part was.) The rhetoric of weight loss
and body sculpting is both abundant and
repetitive. If you let them, these ads will
make you feel inadequate. They will make
you think you need to take action to change
your body. You can either go along with their
message, or you can refuse to wage a war
against yourself.
