Cap hurts small groups
In his op-ed ("Senator defends funding,"
Jan. 27), Danny Arbeiter fails to address why
granting more funds to large groups is justi
fied based on size alone. Logically, the fund
ing apportionment should be based on the
level to which groups contribute to the Stan
ford community and enrich student life
through their programming.
Some small groups, like Coalition for Jus
tice in the Middle East, serve the community
even more than some large groups do.The new
"soft-cap" funding policy will save the ASSU
money, but it will also hurt small groups like
ours with this false assumption that the size of
a group's membership is the most important

qonsideration in funding student groups.
It is an admirable goal for the ASSU to
limit wasteful spending, but not by installing
unfair policies that penalize small groups, re
gardless of how much they contribute to stu
dent life.

Open letter to Stanford's studious,
athletic travelers
As a sleepy Stanford campus was shaking
off its Friday morning hangover and reading
over coffee Cassidy Krug's and Kevin
McLean's column on the tribulations of trav
eling in Cardinal uniform, I was flying to Los

Angeles with the Stanford Band to support
the women's basketball team against UCLA.
I can sympathize with your difficulties, and I
want you all to know that there is an escape.
Simply don your favorite fluorescent
muumuu, leopard-print pants or Soviet-style
fur hat and tell anyone who asks that you're
with the San Jose State Debate Society or the
World Christian Youth Conference. It seems
to work for us, even if it doesn't deter the oc
casional weird Swiss tourist hell-bent on giv
ing a 20-minute piano recital in the hotel
lobby once he guesses we're musicians. Can't
win 'em all, I guess.
May the funk be with you. and go Card.
