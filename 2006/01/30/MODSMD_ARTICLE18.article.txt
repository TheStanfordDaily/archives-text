## A 						tough loss and a good win for Card AT A GLANCE 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Traveling to Los Angeles for the
start of the second round of Pac-10
competition, the No. 11 women's
basketball team knew it had a major
challenge on its hands. Both UCLA
and No. 23 USC were ready for re
venge after the Cardinal scored two
easy wins a month ago in Palo Alto,
and they each fought tough in a diffi
cult weekend split. UCLA first took
a 90-80 decision before Stanford re
bounded to down USC 78-69.
The Bruins' offense, ranked sec
ond in the conference, proved too
much for the Cardinal to handle. Ju
nior guard Noelle Quinn had 25
points on the night, while Senior
guard Nikki Blue had 24. In total, the
Bruins (11-8. 6-4) had four players
crack double figures.
Despite a career-high 26 points
and 17 rebounds from junior center
Brooke Smith. Stanford's offense
couldn't keep pace. Sophomore
guard Candice Wiggins scored 26.
pulling her to 999 on her collegiate
career, while senior forward Krista
Rappahahn added 12. But no one
else contributed more than six.
"Candice is capable of doing
more and doing better, and Brooke is
capable of doing more and doing
better, but they need some help."
coach Tara Vanberveer said. "We got
to have some people scoring."
UCLA led from the start, and the
Cardinal trailed 46-32 by halftime. In
the second half, Stanford kept up. but
couldn't close to within nine.
"Every time we had a basket, they
would answer — always," Wiggins
said. "So. it wasn't really that our of
fense was problem. It was our de
fense — we weren't stopping them."

Stanford gave up a season-high 90
points to the Bruins. The Cardinal
knew UCLA would be strong on the
perimeter, but Stanford said unsatis
factory rebounding and lack of ag
gression allowed the Bruins to run
the court.
"We didn't do the defensive work
that we needed to do, and then that
fueled UCLA's offense," Van-
Derveer said. "They were hitting
some tough shots, but then we gave
them easy baskets on top of that.
Layups. [and off] offensive boards."
Earlier this season, the Card hand
ily defeated UCLA at home. 91-68,
but after 14 straight losses to Stan
ford, and on their own home court,
the Bruins were ready for a change.
"People don't like getting beat,
and that's what they said tonight.
Iliey didn't like it, and they said it
loud," Van Derveer said.
USC showed its frustration at re
cent Card dominance as well on Sun
day. coming out firing on all cylin
ders.
For much of the first half, the Car
dinal kept pace with the Women of
Troy, trailing by four at most. But
then, USC pulled ahead on a 7-2 run
to lead 29-23 with five minutes re
maining in the period and close the
half on top, 36-30.
In the second half the Cardinal
were able to shut down USC's top

scorer, junior guard Eshaya Murphy,
and brought back Smith, who sat out
most of the first half with early foul
trouble.
"I 'm really proud of our resiliency
and how we came back," Van-
Derveer said. "We had to fight it out,
and we had to dig in, and it was real
ly good."
Unlike Friday, the Cardinal re
ceived contributions from several re
serves. including 15 points from
freshman forward Jillian Harmon.
Passing the 1000-point mark on an
early three-pointer, Wiggins led
Stanford with 18, while Smith and
freshman guard Rosalyn Gold-On
wude added 14 apiece.
"1 think everyone contributed,"
Smith said. "Jillian had some big
shots for us. Roz did well in the sec
ond half. Clare covered Shay [Es
haya Murphy] really well — every
one helped."
The Cardinal regained the lead
for the first time since early in the
first half with a banked-in three
pointer by Gold-Onwude with 3:35
left. Stanford was down by as many
as seven just four minutes before, but
ended the game on a 23-7 run.
"After losing, this was a huge win,"
VanDerveer said. "We battled, and
I'm really proud of our comeback.
I'm really proud of our team. We
struggled, but we fought through it."
The weekend may have been an
initial disappointment,but, with their
strong finish, the Card said they
showed they were intent on avoiding
back-to-back losses for the second
time this season.
"I think we showed a lot of deter
mination," VanDerveer said. "1
thought [our performance] was real
ly gutsy, we showed some grit, and we
showed some heart."

Junior center Brook Smith had a career high in both points and rebounds
against UCLA, but it was not enough as the No. 1 1 Cardinal fell 90-80.
Traveling to Los Angeles for the
start of the second round of Pac-10
competition, the No. 11 women's
basketball team knew it had a major
challenge on its hands. Both UCLA
and No. 23 USC were ready for re
venge after the Cardinal scored two
easy wins a month ago in Palo Alto,
and they each fought tough in a diffi
cult weekend split. UCLA first took
a 90-80 decision before Stanford re
bounded to down USC 78-69.
The Bruins' offense, ranked sec
ond in the conference, proved too
much for the Cardinal to handle. Ju
nior guard Noelle Quinn had 25
points on the night, while Senior
guard Nikki Blue had 24. In total, the
Bruins (11-8. 6-4) had four players
crack double figures.
Despite a career-high 26 points
and 17 rebounds from junior center
Brooke Smith. Stanford's offense
couldn't keep pace. Sophomore
guard Candice Wiggins scored 26.
pulling her to 999 on her collegiate
career, while senior forward Krista
Rappahahn added 12. But no one
else contributed more than six.
"Candice is capable of doing
more and doing better, and Brooke is
capable of doing more and doing
better, but they need some help."
coach Tara Vanberveer said. "We got
to have some people scoring."
UCLA led from the start, and the
Cardinal trailed 46-32 by halftime. In
the second half, Stanford kept up. but
couldn't close to within nine.
"Every time we had a basket, they
would answer — always," Wiggins
said. "So. it wasn't really that our of
fense was problem. It was our de
fense — we weren't stopping them."

Stanford gave up a season-high 90
points to the Bruins. The Cardinal
knew UCLA would be strong on the
perimeter, but Stanford said unsatis
factory rebounding and lack of ag
gression allowed the Bruins to run
the court.
"We didn't do the defensive work
that we needed to do, and then that
fueled UCLA's offense," Van-
Derveer said. "They were hitting
some tough shots, but then we gave
them easy baskets on top of that.
Layups. [and off] offensive boards."
Earlier this season, the Card hand
ily defeated UCLA at home. 91-68,
but after 14 straight losses to Stan
ford, and on their own home court,
the Bruins were ready for a change.
"People don't like getting beat,
and that's what they said tonight.
Iliey didn't like it, and they said it
loud," Van Derveer said.
USC showed its frustration at re
cent Card dominance as well on Sun
day. coming out firing on all cylin
ders.
For much of the first half, the Car
dinal kept pace with the Women of
Troy, trailing by four at most. But
then, USC pulled ahead on a 7-2 run
to lead 29-23 with five minutes re
maining in the period and close the
half on top, 36-30.
In the second half the Cardinal
were able to shut down USC's top

scorer, junior guard Eshaya Murphy,
and brought back Smith, who sat out
most of the first half with early foul
trouble.
"I 'm really proud of our resiliency
and how we came back," Van-
Derveer said. "We had to fight it out,
and we had to dig in, and it was real
ly good."
Unlike Friday, the Cardinal re
ceived contributions from several re
serves. including 15 points from
freshman forward Jillian Harmon.
Passing the 1000-point mark on an
early three-pointer, Wiggins led
Stanford with 18, while Smith and
freshman guard Rosalyn Gold-On
wude added 14 apiece.
"1 think everyone contributed,"
Smith said. "Jillian had some big
shots for us. Roz did well in the sec
ond half. Clare covered Shay [Es
haya Murphy] really well — every
one helped."
The Cardinal regained the lead
for the first time since early in the
first half with a banked-in three
pointer by Gold-Onwude with 3:35

as seven just four minutes before, but
