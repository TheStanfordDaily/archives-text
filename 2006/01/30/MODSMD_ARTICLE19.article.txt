dual-match in a row with wins over Hawaii and Fresno State.
'ITie Northern California climate
may have hurt Hawaii. The match
started at 3 p.m.. later than most dual
matches and not long before the sun
began to set. The Hawaii players did
not seem able to adjust.
"Everyone looked like they were
just freezing out there." Kao said.
"My opponent never even took off
her sweatpants. I don't think anyone
did. They just wore them over their
skirts. There's no way you can play
your best with that kind of bulk."
Fresno State proved a scrappier
and more competitive team than
Hawaii, but Stanford's dominance
was never in question.The team won
the doubles point and the first three
singles points with ease.clinching the
5-2 win before Fresno State had a
chance to score.
"Fresno State was an interesting

match because they had added new
players since we had seen them at
Regionals in October," Forood said.
"They have a very talented squad, so
it was a good test for us in dealing
with quality teams."
Stanford again swept the doubles
matches, despite an altered lineup.
Barnes and Yelsey remained part
nered and won 8-5 at the No. 1 spot.
Sophomore Celia Durkin and senior
Amber Liu won 8-4 at the No. 2 dou
bles spot, while Deason and Logar
won 8-5 at the No. 3 position.
Yelsey, the ITA's No. 2 ranked
player, finished her singles match first,
beating Magdalena Tokarska 6-2,6-4
at the No. 3 spot. Nguyen dispatched
Bruna Paes at the No. 6 position next,
6-1.6-1, and Durkin clinched the win
at the No. 5 spot, 6-4.6-4.
Logar, currently ranked fourth in
the country by the ITA.played at the
No. 2 position and also won. 6-2,6-3.
Fresno State's points were won at
the No. 1 and No. 4 positions, as
Melanie Gloria beat fourth-ranked
Barnes 6-4,1-6,1-0 (10-5) and Lucia

Sainz beat Deason 6-4,7-6 (4).
Gloria, a freshman from Montre
al, once heat professional player
Daniela Hantuchova, currently
ranked 35th in the world.
"I really thought 1 was starting to
play much better in the second set
and would have preferred the
chance at a full third set," Barnes
said of her loss to Gloria. "That said,
I knew the 10-point tiebreaker was
coming and you always know that is
a bit of a lottery and that's just the
way it is. You have to deal with it "
Fresno State typically has a heavi
ly-international team and this year is
no exception. All of Friday's singles
players and doubles players hail from
outside the United States — one each
from Spain. Germany, Jamaica. Brazil
and Poland, and two from Canada.
This week, the team travels to
Madison, Wise, for the team indoors
tournament. This will be the team's
first chance to see how it shapes up
against other top teams.
"I feel like indoors is where the
season really takes off," Barnes said.
