## Cardinal vanquish No. 10 Washington in comeback victory—Hernandez's charity stripe heroics force OT 
### SEAN HOWELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When Stanford senior guard Chris Her
nandez stepped to the free-throw line with
two-tenths of a second left in regulation, his
team trailing 63-60, and three shots coming to
him, he knew that this was the moment he had
been waiting for. And he was ready.
"It's funny, because we were in the shoot
around today, and [assistant] coach [Tony]
Fuller slammed me for the Virginia Tech

game, when I missed those free throws down
the stretch," Hernandez said, referring to the
Cardinal's 59-52 loss to the Hokies on Dec.
17."I thought about that when I was shooting
[the free throws]. It made me focus on the
game."
Hernandez stepped to the line with a typi
cally stoic expression and swished the first
two before Washington head coach Lorenzo
Romar called a timeout, forcing the guard to

"We call that the home run play,"
head coach Trent Johnson said. "We
work on situations like that in every
practice. We try to get it to the shooter
and get a three."
Haryasz noted that they had never
run the play against a defense, even in
practice.
"It's not even close to simulating it
when you've got a packed house
against Washington, down by three,"
Haryasz said.
Hernandez had plenty of time to
think about the free throws — and the
Virginia Tech game — after the offi
cials reviewed the call, eventually de
termining he had gotten the shot off
with 0.2 seconds remaining. He also
waited through the four timeouts that
Johnson called to set up the final play.
Stanford carried the momentum
that Hernandez provided into over
time, using an 11-2 run to seal the vic
tory. The Cardinal played tough de
fense and. fittingly enough, made eight
free throws in the bonus time. 1 lernan
dez had four of those and finished with
15 points, and a perfect nine-of-nine
from the line.
"When we reached overtime, we
said, this is our second chance, and you
don't get many second chances," said
Haryasz. whose 24 points paced the
squad. "We got one, and we took ad
vantage of it. I was confident we were
going to win the game when it went to
overtime."
Haryasz put the team on his shoul
ders in the second half, notching 10 of
the Cardinal's first 15 points after the
break. But Washington — and senior
guard Brandon Roy especially — an
swered every time. Roy scored 15 of
his game-high 25 in the second period
before Stanford senior guard Dan
Grunfeld held him to two free throws
in the overtime session.
Grunfeld's hustle also helped the
Cardinal stay close in the second half.
The Huskies took a 54-48 lead with
7:48 to play when Roy converted a
three-point play, but Grunfeld — who
had been fairly quiet up to that point

— fought back.
After Stanford freshman Mitch
Johnson missed a fast-break lay-up.
Grunfeld scooped up the loose ball
and scored. He stripped Washington's
Joel Smith on the next play, which led
to a Hill three-pointer. After,grabbing
a rebound on the Huskies' next pos
session. Grunfeld raced down the
floor and made a layup. drawing a hard
foul. The ball fell through the hoop as
Grunfeld hit the floor,and he convert
ed the free throw to put Stanford
ahead 56-54.
The Cardinal stretched the lead to
60-56 on free throws by Hernandez
and Haryasz, but Washington battled
back. A layup from Roy put the
Huskies up 61-60 with 1:03 to play.
Stanford had a chance to score
after Johnson stole the ball from Roy
with 15 seconds remaining. But John
son lost the handle trying to find
Grunfeld with three seconds left, forc
ing Grunfeld to toul Roy immediately.
He was fouled again on the ensuing in
bounds pass, putting Washington into
the bonus and sending Roy to the line.
He sank both free throws to push the
Washington lead to three, setting up
Hernandez's heroics.
The shots spelled redemption for
Hernandez, and not just from the Vir
ginia Tech game. He sat out the first
half's final 12:16 after picking up his
second foul and watched from a fold
ing chair as the Huskies went on a 17-
5 run to finish the half ahead 33-28.
The margin probably should have
been wider — the Huskies attempted
13 more shots than the Cardinal did in
the first period — but Stanford held
the nation's highest-scoring offense to
only 39 percent from the field in the
half, and 37 percent in the game.
Even Hernandez admitted that he
was nervous shooting the free throws,
hut Haryasz knew that the Cardinal
had the right man at the line.
"When Chris went to the line, he
was like, 'What's up?"' Haryasz said
after the game. "I was like. 'Chilling.
We're going to overtime.'"

Senior forward Matt Haryasz helped lead a critical stretch run en route to
a 76-67 victory over No. 10 Washington. He also made the pass to Chris
Hernandez that set up the game-tying play.
