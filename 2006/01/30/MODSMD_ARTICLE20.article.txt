# Top 10 foes stymie Cardinal
## Stanford drops two matches in straight sets to No. 5 CSU-Northridge and No. 9 UCSB 
### JOE KAY 
Men's volleyball tried to build off an encouraging loss to top
ranked Long Beach State last weekend, but proved unsuccessful,
falling to two top-10 ranked teams.
Stanford (2-8. 1-5 MPSF) lost in straight sets to both No. 5
CSU-Northridge on Friday evening and No. 9 UC-Santa Barbara
on Saturday night. Against Northridge (5-3,1-2), the Matadors
won 30-23, 30-25, 30-23. Against UCSB (4-5, 3-3), the Cardinal
lost 27-30,18-30,19-30.
Against the Matadors, senior opposite hitter Ben Reddy led
the team with 14 kills on a .225 hitting percentage. Senior outside
hitter William Clayton posted six kills. He hit .231, but the team
as a whole only hit .107 on the night.
Senior setter Jeremy Jacobs also had a solid night, dishing out
23 assists and posting four digs and two blocks.
On the other side of the net, the Northridge team was led by
junior opposite hitter Dan Rhodes and senior outside hitter Cary
Hanson. They had 16 and 11 kills, respectively. Sophomore setter
Travis Bluemling recorded 45 assists on 82 attempts, eight less
than Jacobs was offered.
"We got our hands on a lot of attacks, but we just couldn't con
vert on many of them." head coach Don Shaw said. "We had
chances to score points, but we just didn't take advantage of
them. You couple that with the unforced hitting errors that we
made, and that's the reason we lost that match."
In game one, the Cardinal had a chance to pull ahead when
the deficit shrank to 21-24. However. Northridge responded
with two straight kills, and the Cardinal finished out the game
with two errors.
Game two was much more closely contested. The game was
tied at 22 when a Reddy error and a Northridge kill forced the
Cardinal to take a timeout. A Reddy spike brought the score to
23-24. However, Stanford would pull no closer.
"If we had cut down on a few hitting errors, and taken advan
tage of a few point-scoring opportunities, it would have been a
much more even match," associate head coach John Kosty said.
Against USCB. Reddy once again paced the Cardinal with 13
kills/
Jacobs and freshman Miki Groppi split setting duties. Jacobs
had another solid night, racking up 16 sets with a .444 setting per
centage. Groppi had 11 assists, but was less accurate. He was
given 39 set attempts to Jacobs' 36.
As expected, redshirt junior opposite hitter Evan Patak was the
kill leader for UCSB. He had 17 kills on a .556 hitting percentage.
Two of their other hitters got into double figures, as Bryan
Berman and Michael Fisher hit for 13 and 10 kills, respectively.
"Their outside hitters controlled us," Kosty said. "They hit for
a very high percentage, which made it difficult for us to win the
match."
Stanford jumped out to a 20-16 lead in the first game with
Reddy leading the way, but a 7-1 UCSB run put a damper on any
hopes that the Cardinal might pull away with a win.

Patak, who was the force behind that run, led the team to con
vincing wins in games two and three.
"Our coach would tell us that if we play well we're capable of
taking down any team in the country" said senior outside hitter
Nick Manov. "We played well at times and we were in control at
several times in those matches."
The Cardinal next face the University of Pacific in Stockton,
Calif. Friday at 7 p.m.
