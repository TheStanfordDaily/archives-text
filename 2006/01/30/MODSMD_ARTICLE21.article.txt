### BEN BACKES 
The men's tennis team opened its dual
match schedule this year in unusual fash
ion â€” alongside its top-ranked female
counterpart. Sharing the tennis courts at
Taube Family Tennis Stadium, both the
men's and women's teams picked up wins
over underdog Hawaii squads.
Winning the top slots in both singles
and doubles, senior captain KC Corkery
led the No. 14 squad to a 6-1 victory. He
teamed with James Pade to defeat Jarrod
Diepraam and Ryan Sceats 8-3 in his dou
bles match, and then beat Sascha Hcine
mann 6-2,6-3 in singles.

Pade, who redshirted last season, at
times looked overpowering in his singles
match. The junior won 6-1,6-2 over Bryon
Weinberg in the No. 2 singles position.
Stanford's doubles play, which was
plagued with inconsistency last season,
again failed to impress. Although the fifth
ranked Pade / Corkery combination
looked imposing in the top slot, senior Jon
Wong and freshman Blake Muller
dropped the No. 2 doubles match 8-3 to
Weinberg and Jeff Fitch.
Last year, the Cardinal only won eight
of 25 matches in dual match play at the No.
2 doubles position.The doubles point was
the difference in many of the tight 4-3

matches that Stanford lost last season.
After the first two doubles matches
had been completed, the doubles point
rested on the shoulders of junior James
Wan and sophomore Chris Rasmussen.
With the score tied at 5-5 and down a
break point. Wan hit a service winner
down the middle of the court.
"[At 5-5,] I thought about all the times
I had been in that situation before and I
knew that we would pull through," Wan
said."l just stepped up to the line and went
for my serve, and that proved to get us out
of some trouble."
