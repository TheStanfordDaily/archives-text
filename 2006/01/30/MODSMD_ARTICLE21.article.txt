## 
### BEN BACKES 
The men's tennis team opened its dual
match schedule this year in unusual fash
ion â€” alongside its top-ranked female
counterpart. Sharing the tennis courts at
Taube Family Tennis Stadium, both the
men's and women's teams picked up wins
over underdog Hawaii squads.
Winning the top slots in both singles
and doubles, senior captain KC Corkery
led the No. 14 squad to a 6-1 victory. He
teamed with James Pade to defeat Jarrod
Diepraam and Ryan Sceats 8-3 in his dou
bles match, and then beat Sascha Hcine
mann 6-2,6-3 in singles.

Pade, who redshirted last season, at
times looked overpowering in his singles
match. The junior won 6-1,6-2 over Bryon
Weinberg in the No. 2 singles position.
Stanford's doubles play, which was
plagued with inconsistency last season,
again failed to impress. Although the fifth
ranked Pade / Corkery combination
looked imposing in the top slot, senior Jon
Wong and freshman Blake Muller
dropped the No. 2 doubles match 8-3 to
Weinberg and Jeff Fitch.
Last year, the Cardinal only won eight
of 25 matches in dual match play at the No.
2 doubles position.The doubles point was
the difference in many of the tight 4-3

matches that Stanford lost last season.
After the first two doubles matches
had been completed, the doubles point
rested on the shoulders of junior James
Wan and sophomore Chris Rasmussen.
With the score tied at 5-5 and down a
break point. Wan hit a service winner
down the middle of the court.
"[At 5-5,] I thought about all the times
I had been in that situation before and I
knew that we would pull through," Wan
said."l just stepped up to the line and went
for my serve, and that proved to get us out
of some trouble."
The duo went on to win the next
two points,and then won the final two
games to clinch the doubles point.
Rasmussen was also a winner at
singles, topping Fitch 6-2,6-2.
The only point that Stanford lost
came when Muller dropped his sin
gles match to Sceats, 1-6,7-6.1-0 (9).
After moving indoors because of
rain, Muller lost a tiebreaker for the
second set. Since the Cardinal had
already clinched victory, Muller and
Sceats played a tiebreaker to decide
the match, which Sceats won.
Although Muller had a slow start
to the dual-match season, his team
mates remain confident in his abilities.
"Blake is a great player," Wan said.
"He came to Stanford as one of the
top juniors in the country and I have
no doubt that he'll play an important
role in the success of our team."
Along with Muller. another play
er who might fill out the bottom of
the Cardinal singles lineup is Phil
kao. The sophomore had a strong
debut to the 2(K)6 season, winning
convincingly at No. 4 singles, 6-2,6-4.
Wong also notched a singles win
for Stanford in a close match. 7-6,7-6.
While it is still early in the season,
one of the most important weekends
of the year looms ahead for the Car
dinal. Stanford hosts No. 20 Southern
California on Friday at 1:30 p.m. and
No. 5 UCLA on Saturday at 1:00 p.m.
Injuries may make improving on
last season's 14-11 record difficult.
Freshman Matt Bruch. the fourth
ranked singles player in the country,
missed the match against Hawaii with
an injured shoulder. 1 le is expected to
be in the lineup this weekend.
Wan. who injured his foot in the
final game of his doubles match and
sat out singles play against Hawaii,is
also expected to play against USC
and UCLA.
