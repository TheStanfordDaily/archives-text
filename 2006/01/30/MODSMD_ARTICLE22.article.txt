Hello Readers!

Could our new sports volume
possibly kick off on a better
night? On my only evening off
from Stanford sports for the next
four months, there I was in the
front row, screaming at those
god-awful refs, praying and
swaying as Chris Hernandez
nailed three clutch free throws,
and storming the court after our
biggest win this season — with
dozens of my friends, and hun
dreds of other students. I was just
another student enjoying Stan
ford athletics — and that's the
audience I want to enjoy reading
this section, and appreciate and
understand the changes we're
making.
I'm excited to announce sev
eral new initiatives that we're
confident will improve the
Sports section. Perhaps the most
noticeable change is our addi
tion of instant recaps. For the
first time in the Daily's 101 -year
history, you can now log on to
stanforddaily.com within an
hour of the final to read our full
length recaps of all men's and
women's basketball games. (To
be fair, we didn't exactly have the
Internet 103 years ago. but this is
still an exciting — and quasi-his
toric — announcement.)
I'm am similarly pleased to
announce that, starting today, we
are including box scores for
every men's and women's bas
ketball game — a lone overdue
