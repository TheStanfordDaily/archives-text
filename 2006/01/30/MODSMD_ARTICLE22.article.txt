# WELCOME FROM THE MANAGING EDITOR
## 
### 
Hello Readers!

Could our new sports volume
possibly kick off on a better
night? On my only evening off
from Stanford sports for the next
four months, there I was in the
front row, screaming at those
god-awful refs, praying and
swaying as Chris Hernandez
nailed three clutch free throws,
and storming the court after our
biggest win this season — with
dozens of my friends, and hun
dreds of other students. I was just
another student enjoying Stan
ford athletics — and that's the
audience I want to enjoy reading
this section, and appreciate and
understand the changes we're
making.
I'm excited to announce sev
eral new initiatives that we're
confident will improve the
Sports section. Perhaps the most
noticeable change is our addi
tion of instant recaps. For the
first time in the Daily's 101 -year
history, you can now log on to
stanforddaily.com within an
hour of the final to read our full
length recaps of all men's and
women's basketball games. (To
be fair, we didn't exactly have the
Internet 103 years ago. but this is
still an exciting — and quasi-his
toric — announcement.)
I'm am similarly pleased to
announce that, starting today, we
are including box scores for
every men's and women's bas
ketball game — a lone overdue
addition.The Daily will include both
instant online recaps and hard-copy
box scores for future seasons' head
line sports — baseball and Softball
in the spring, and football and
women's volleyball next fall.
I believe one way our section can
improve is by placing a greater em
phasis on breaking sports news, and
we plan to do just that. In fact, we'll
be running three such stories this
week (including two tomorrow on
the new stadium).
We don't just want to report the
breaking news though, we want to
bring you the people that make it. In
that vein, we're looking to run regu
lar interviews with high-profile Stan
ford athletes, coaches and adminis
trators. starting as soon as we possi
bly can.
I also want to also announce the

introduction of "Through My Eyes",
features that will help readers con
nect to Stanford athletes — not just
as stats-garnering machines, but as
friends, as classmates, as people. We
hope to give our readers an intimate
connection with a team, so we will
profile as many members of the
women's tennis squad as possible,
starting this Wednesday and every
week thereafter.To provide a feel for
the many other teams on campus,
we'll also be running weekly
"Through My Eyes"featuring an ath
lete from a different sport each week.
We are reemphasizing standard
AP style with our writers, in an at
tempt to provide you with the high
est quality content. To compliment
the qualitative changes, we are also
planning to introduce new graphics
and layout techniques that make the
page more useful to the reader.
Check out our new sport-specific "At
A Glance" boxes today, and credit
AJ Minich in layout and Joseph
Bergen in graphics.
None of this would be possible

without the hard work of our writers
and editors. They are second-to
none. I also want to thank Elizabeth
Aguilar. who held this position from
the start of the school year until this
past week, setting the bar high.
I hope that throughout our transi
tion period and beyond, you will feel
free to contact us to suggest changes,
make comments or ask questions. (If
you e-mail us a particularly witty com
ment by 4 PM. we'll even find a way to
get it in the next day's paper, with your
name attached.) Not only do we value
your feedback, but we rely upon it to
build the best section possible.
Finally, if you are interested in
joining the sports team here at the
Daily, we are always looking for
fresh blood to help us realize our
goals (and have a ton of fun along
the way). E-mail sports@daily.stan
