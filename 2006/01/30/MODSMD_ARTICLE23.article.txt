# The 						Zen 0f... Ow,my bulging disc
## 
### 
As a near-perpetual stress
case — I bite my fingernails
so much, they aren't even
long enough to open the clasp on my
watch — I have been seeking en
lightenment for a long time, though
admittedly somewhat half-hearted
ly. I long for the day when, freed
from earthly suffering. I will be able
to transcend my petty daily concerns
and focus on things that are really
important — like getting my watch
off my wrist without having to ask
my roommate for help.
I had that in mind when I signed
up for yoga this quarter. It seemed
like a meditative practice, with all
those poses and their soothing
sounding names.
But on Thursday, as I walked
backwards up a wall while support
ing myself with my hands. I started
to question the impact yoga was
having on my peace of mind. Our
yoga instructor frequently talks
about finding a sense of content
ment in poses,but usually all I can do
is try to stay standing as I kiss my big
toe.
Then again, at times, I can see
why people rave about it so much.
These moments usually come when
we're lying on our sides to unwind at
the end of a session, or when I'm
limping back to my dorm room. I
never guessed how hard this was
going to be when I watched kids bik
ing around campus with those goofy
mats sticking out of their backpacks.
I guess 1 should have gotten the idea
when 1 overheard Trent Edwards
talking about how hard his 10 a.m.
yoga class was while I walked in for
the 11 :(X) session. It is not a sport for
the faint of heart.
But it is popular. The Athletic
Department offers nine sections of
yoga, and the room for it is so big. I
often have trouble hearing the in
structor over the "Now! This is
Music: Vol. 37" mix that he frequent
ly plays.
There's a good reason that yoga
appeals to Stanford students: This
place can be an academic pressure
cooker. and the practice of yoga is
commonly held to relieve stress. It
forces you to focus on one thing —
alignment, contentment, the girl in
front of you — and to let frantic
thoughts about homework, extra
curricular and the girl behind you
fade away. You also get a unit for a
class in which the only homework
assignments involve stretching.

The Turnaround
Yoga has certainly forced me to
live in the present and forget about
the minutiae that usually occupies
my time. When you're try ing to per
form a backwards somersault with
out the use of your arms and without
touching your head to the ground,
there's not much room left to think
about getting a new watch clasp. Our
instructor often returns to the theme
of being aware of your body, some
thing that's easy to do when you're
sitting in the lotus pose and your

ankle bone is nearly scraping the cal
cium off your knee.
Or when you're trying not to fall.
Which, so far. has been my main ob
jective. I am confident that there will
be a point at which I can ease into the
poses and think about them in the
spiritual language in which the in
structor describes them, rather than
in terms of pain threshold. I'm hold
ing out that yoga will still be able to
help me achieve enlightenment. At
least I will have paid my dues, right?
Then again, maybe nirvana can
only be achieved when you stop try
ing. That is one of the main tenets of
Zen Buddhism: the more you think
about anything, the further away you
are from achieving it. Don't talk

about it,don't read about it;just do it.
I don't think that really applies to
yoga, despite the insistence of our in
structor (who always makes sure to
literally push you into a deeper, mus
cle-straining stretch as he talks about
the road to inner peace).
1 think I will always be struggling
along this road. In his visit to Stan
ford, the Dalai Lama suggested that
the audience try to meditate for half
an hour each day. He then paused,
noted that he sometimes has trouble
sitting still for that long, and amend
ed his advice to 15 minutes. Finally,
he said with a laugh that five minutes
would be pretty good, seeing as
we're active college students.
He seemed to have achieved

peace, but 1 have a feeling that it's
more through conscious effort to be
happy than any great amount of
metaphysical grappling. Maybe
peace of mind — like yoga — is at
least partially a function of will
power. «
I'm still not quite sure that yoga's
for me. It requires a degree of flexi- *
bility and strength that I clearly don't
have — at least not yet. as evidenced
by my collapsing in a heap every five
minutes or so.
But it sure beats running.

ing around campus with those goofy
mats sticking out of their backpacks.
I guess 1 should have gotten the idea
when 1 overheard Trent Edwards
talking about how hard his 10 a.m.
yoga class was while I walked in for
the 11 :(X) session. It is not a sport for
the faint of heart.
But it is popular. The Athletic
Department offers nine sections of
yoga, and the room for it is so big. I
often have trouble hearing the in
structor over the "Now! This is
Music: Vol. 37" mix that he frequent
ly plays.
There's a good reason that yoga
appeals to Stanford students: This
place can be an academic pressure
cooker. and the practice of yoga is
commonly held to relieve stress. It
forces you to focus on one thing —
alignment, contentment, the girl in
front of you — and to let frantic
thoughts about homework, extra
curricular and the girl behind you
fade away. You also get a unit for a
class in which the only homework
assignments involve stretching.

The Turnaround
Yoga has certainly forced me to
live in the present and forget about
the minutiae that usually occupies
my time. When you're try ing to per
form a backwards somersault with
out the use of your arms and without
touching your head to the ground,
there's not much room left to think
about getting a new watch clasp. Our
instructor often returns to the theme
of being aware of your body, some
thing that's easy to do when you're
sitting in the lotus pose and your

ankle bone is nearly scraping the cal
cium off your knee.
Or when you're trying not to fall.
Which, so far. has been my main ob
jective. I am confident that there will
be a point at which I can ease into the
poses and think about them in the
spiritual language in which the in
structor describes them, rather than
in terms of pain threshold. I'm hold
ing out that yoga will still be able to
help me achieve enlightenment. At
least I will have paid my dues, right?
Then again, maybe nirvana can
only be achieved when you stop try
ing. That is one of the main tenets of
Zen Buddhism: the more you think
about anything, the further away you
are from achieving it. Don't talk

about it,don't read about it;just do it.
I don't think that really applies to
yoga, despite the insistence of our in
structor (who always makes sure to
literally push you into a deeper, mus
cle-straining stretch as he talks about
the road to inner peace).
1 think I will always be struggling
along this road. In his visit to Stan
ford, the Dalai Lama suggested that
the audience try to meditate for half
an hour each day. He then paused,
noted that he sometimes has trouble
sitting still for that long, and amend
ed his advice to 15 minutes. Finally,
he said with a laugh that five minutes
would be pretty good, seeing as
we're active college students.
He seemed to have achieved

peace, but 1 have a feeling that it's
more through conscious effort to be
happy than any great amount of
metaphysical grappling. Maybe
peace of mind — like yoga — is at
least partially a function of will
power. «
I'm still not quite sure that yoga's
for me. It requires a degree of flexi- *
bility and strength that I clearly don't
have — at least not yet. as evidenced
by my collapsing in a heap every five
minutes or so.
But it sure beats running.
