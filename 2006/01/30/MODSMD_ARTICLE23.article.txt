As a near-perpetual stress
case — I bite my fingernails
so much, they aren't even
long enough to open the clasp on my
watch — I have been seeking en
lightenment for a long time, though
admittedly somewhat half-hearted
ly. I long for the day when, freed
from earthly suffering. I will be able
to transcend my petty daily concerns
and focus on things that are really
important — like getting my watch
off my wrist without having to ask
my roommate for help.
I had that in mind when I signed
up for yoga this quarter. It seemed
like a meditative practice, with all
those poses and their soothing
sounding names.
But on Thursday, as I walked
backwards up a wall while support
ing myself with my hands. I started
to question the impact yoga was
having on my peace of mind. Our
yoga instructor frequently talks
about finding a sense of content
ment in poses,but usually all I can do
is try to stay standing as I kiss my big
toe.
Then again, at times, I can see
why people rave about it so much.
These moments usually come when
we're lying on our sides to unwind at
the end of a session, or when I'm
limping back to my dorm room. I
never guessed how hard this was
going to be when I watched kids bik
ing around campus with those goofy
mats sticking out of their backpacks.
I guess 1 should have gotten the idea
when 1 overheard Trent Edwards
talking about how hard his 10 a.m.
yoga class was while I walked in for
the 11 :(X) session. It is not a sport for
the faint of heart.
But it is popular. The Athletic
Department offers nine sections of
yoga, and the room for it is so big. I
often have trouble hearing the in
structor over the "Now! This is
Music: Vol. 37" mix that he frequent
ly plays.
There's a good reason that yoga
appeals to Stanford students: This
place can be an academic pressure
cooker. and the practice of yoga is
commonly held to relieve stress. It
forces you to focus on one thing —
alignment, contentment, the girl in
front of you — and to let frantic
thoughts about homework, extra
curricular and the girl behind you
fade away. You also get a unit for a
class in which the only homework
assignments involve stretching.
