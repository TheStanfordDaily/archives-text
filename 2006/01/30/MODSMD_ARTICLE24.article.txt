## Women's gym upset by young Oregon State squad Sophomore Yïm wins vault and floor, but team falls 
### JUSTINA KAMIEL GRAYMAN 
Everyone knows the classic underdog
story — the team with less experience, hype
and rank wins.
And that's just what happened Friday, in
Corvallis, where No. 19 Oregon State defeat
ed the No. 6 Stanford women's gymnastics
team. 195.15-194.125.
Head coach Kristen Smyth gave her
squad's performance a mixed review.
"We had great individual performances,
but we still haven't put together a great team
effort," Smyth said.
The team began on uneven bars, where
freshman Kelly Fee started strong with a
9.825. But two subsequent misses by her
teammates seemed to halt the positive flow.
This tide turned back in the Cardinal's
favor when sophomore Liz Tricase gained
the bars title (9.85) and Fee earned second.
Senior Natalie Foley was fourth with a 9.775.
From Oregon State, freshman Jamie Lanz
was third (9.8) on bars. Cassandra Rowell
and Keegan Fitzgerald shared fourth with
Foley.
The Beavers held the lead after a solid
first rotation on vault.
Stanford's second rotation was its best of
the night. The team picked up the lead with a
49.05, and sophomore Tabitha Yim captured
the vault title (9.9).
Yim's three teammates — sophomore
Alex Pintchouk, Foley and Tricase — tied for
third behind Oregon State freshman Tasha
Smith.
Next for the Cardinal was the floor. The
squad executed some impressive stunts like a
triple full and a full-in, but could not retain

the lead after Oregon State's beam perform
ance of 48.875.
Yim shared her second event title (9.85)
on floor with Oregon State's Smith, but is
more worried about team than individual
success.
"I'm doing it for the team," she said. "It's
not about me. My team needs me to do well."
On floor, Foley shared third (9.825) with
sophomore Megan Devenicenzi and Lanz.
The Cardinal progressed to beam, where
the team endured its lowest event score of
48.15. Fee's score of 9.825 was the only one to
crack 9.8. Fee placed second and Yim placed
fifth (9.775).
Smyth described the team's bars and
beam performances as "a little too relaxed,"
but she found positives in one gymnast's rou
tine.
"Kelly Fee is an outstanding leader and
has great promise," she said.
OSU freshmen again dominated the
team's beam performance, with Smith and
Lanz earning first (9.875) and third (9.8), re
spectively. Senior Chrissy Lamun shared
third with Lanz.
Oregon State's last rotation was on floor,
where they clinched the win with a strong
49(H).
Freshmen Lanz and Smith shared the all
around title with a 39.125. Stanford freshman
Nicole Ourada placed third (38.85). Team
veterans Lamun of OSU and Foley of Stan
ford placed fourth (38.65) and fifth (37.15).
respectively.
" The freshmen really stepped up," Smyth
said.
Despite Smyth's optimism — and individ
ual wins on floor, vault and bars — Yim and
Tricase were not satisfied.
"The top thing is what I can do for the
team," Tricase said. "Anything that happens
individually is icing on the cake."
