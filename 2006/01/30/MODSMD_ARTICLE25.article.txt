### KAT LEWIN STAFF WRITER 
Islam Awareness Month kicked
off last night with an evening of
music, food and information titled
"Islam 101: Sounds of Islam."
The event, presented by the Is
lamic Society of Stanford University
(ISSU) and the Muslim Student
Awareness Network (MSAN), was
attended by approximately 75 peo
ple and held in Bechtel International
Center.
To begin the evening, MSAN
President Omar Shakir, a junior,
noted the growth of Stanford's Mus
lim community over the past several
decades. Currently, there are approx
imately 12 student groups — includ
ing the Muslim Students Awareness
Network and Pakistanis at Stanford
(PAS), among others — who are af
filiated with Stanford's Muslim com
munity.

Shakir then announced a formal
petition for a Muslim Cultural Com
munity Center to be built on campus
and a full-time Muslim community
center director to run it.
"We have no real voice in the
University and no connection to
University resources except on a stu
dent-to-student basis, rendering our
community invisible and inaccessi
ble to most," he said. "We, as a cultur
al community, feel we've reached a
point where we need a communal
gathering place that also can serve as
a central point for the Stanford com
munity to learn about Islam and
Muslim culture in a comfortable en
vironment."
According to the proposal, Stan
ford's Muslim community has no
"meeting space, office, event, storage
or community congregation space
on campus" and is "instead allotted
only a small prayer room in Old
Union."
Audience reception to the an
nouncement was warm.
