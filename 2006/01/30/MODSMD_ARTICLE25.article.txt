# SPECIAL EVENT
## Islam Awareness Month kicks off Event features Muslim food, music and culture 
### KAT LEWIN STAFF WRITER 
Islam Awareness Month kicked
off last night with an evening of
music, food and information titled
"Islam 101: Sounds of Islam."
The event, presented by the Is
lamic Society of Stanford University
(ISSU) and the Muslim Student
Awareness Network (MSAN), was
attended by approximately 75 peo
ple and held in Bechtel International
Center.
To begin the evening, MSAN
President Omar Shakir, a junior,
noted the growth of Stanford's Mus
lim community over the past several
decades. Currently, there are approx
imately 12 student groups — includ
ing the Muslim Students Awareness
Network and Pakistanis at Stanford
(PAS), among others — who are af
filiated with Stanford's Muslim com
munity.

Shakir then announced a formal
petition for a Muslim Cultural Com
munity Center to be built on campus
and a full-time Muslim community
center director to run it.
"We have no real voice in the
University and no connection to
University resources except on a stu
dent-to-student basis, rendering our
community invisible and inaccessi
ble to most," he said. "We, as a cultur
al community, feel we've reached a
point where we need a communal
gathering place that also can serve as
a central point for the Stanford com
munity to learn about Islam and
Muslim culture in a comfortable en
vironment."
According to the proposal, Stan
ford's Muslim community has no
"meeting space, office, event, storage
or community congregation space
on campus" and is "instead allotted
only a small prayer room in Old
Union."
Audience reception to the an
nouncement was warm.
"This is the first I have heard

about it," said freshman Yasmeen
Abdul-Karim. "I am so excited. It's
so hard now, I never know where
things are going to be, you have to
keep checking your e-mail. This is
wonderful."
After the announcement, In
donesian food was served, including
such dishes as osing kacang and gado
gado. Stanford international student
and Fulbright Scholar Ony Jamhari
gave a short lecture on the country,
which has 197 million Muslim citi
zens.
The musical component of the
evening featured a performance of a
melodious Islamic prayer called
Athan by junior Adnan Majid.
Sophomore Ahmed Maani sang
verses of Arabic poetry praising the
prophet Mohammad in Arabic, So
mali and Swahili. Finally, there was a
recitation of the 93rd chapter of the

Koran by engineering graduate stu
dent Umair Marfani.
"Many people never have been
introduced to Muslim music," said
event organizer Mohammad Subeh.
"We're telling everybody that Mus
lims listen to music. It's a part of
many people's lives. It's a tool for
people to relax, kick back, or, de
pending on the lyrics, listen to for
meaning. We're showing a diversity
of sound, a diversity of music from all
over the world."
The "Islam 101" segment of the
event featured dentist-in-tfaining
and professional speaker Ahmed
Soboh, who explained the pillars of
Islam and what it means to be Mus
lim.
According to Soboh, Islam is the
second largest religion in the world,
with 1.3 billion followers. However,
it suffers from many misconceptions.
One of these, he said, is the number
of Muslims within the United States.
"There are seven million Muslims
in the US." Soboh said. "If you go on
the Internet and look for an official
number of Muslims in the United

States, you will see 1.5 or 2 million.
When I go to the mosque to pray 1
see 400 people; when we go to vote,
there are only 80 of us. I tell people to
register, and they tell me they're
afraid to."
One theme that Soboh stressed
throughout his speech was the differ
ence between religion and culture.
He said he wanted to dispel the neg
ative stereotypes that are spread on
television about Islam.
"One day I was giving a speech
and I said Islam does not force
women to wear scarves over their
heads," he said."A woman said.'You
are lying. 1 saw it on TV.' That isn't
Islam, that's culture."
Soboh described the six pillars of
Iman — beliefs that Islam pro
scribes its followers must hold —
and the five pillars of Islam — ac
tions such as prayers and a declara
tion of faith that Muslims must per
form throughout their lives.
"Once the Muslim does these five
pillars, then he can start building on
his religion and his life," Soboh said.
After explaining the tenets of

Islam, Soboh worked to dispel nega
tive stereotypes, specifically about
women in Islam. Muslim women
were granted by the Koran the rights
to vote, hold positions in govern
ment, choose their marriage partner,
obtain education and own property.
Soboh called the prophet Mo
hammed "the first feminist."
Soboh concluded his speech by
urging the audience not to judge
Muslims based on stereotypes
spread through the press.
"Many bad things are happening
in the Muslim world," he cautioned.
"I want you to imagine poor people
living under oppression. Regardless
of religion, bad things will happen.
But there are also good things hap
pening in the Muslim world."
Shakir said he was happy with the
event's outcome, and audience
members seemed similarly pleased.
"I thought it was really nice,"
Abdul-Karim said. "I didn't know
what to expect, they had a lot of
things: the Koranic recitation, the
speech, the food. Everything was
great." .

"Many people never have been
introduced to Muslim music," said
event organizer Mohammad Subeh.
"We're telling everybody that Mus
lims listen to music. It's a part of
many people's lives. It's a tool for
people to relax, kick back, or, de
pending on the lyrics, listen to for
meaning. We're showing a diversity
of sound, a diversity of music from all
over the world."
The "Islam 101" segment of the
event featured dentist-in-tfaining
and professional speaker Ahmed
Soboh, who explained the pillars of
Islam and what it means to be Mus
lim.
According to Soboh, Islam is the
second largest religion in the world,
with 1.3 billion followers. However,
it suffers from many misconceptions.
One of these, he said, is the number
of Muslims within the United States.
"There are seven million Muslims
in the US." Soboh said. "If you go on
the Internet and look for an official
number of Muslims in the United

States, you will see 1.5 or 2 million.
When I go to the mosque to pray 1
see 400 people; when we go to vote,
there are only 80 of us. I tell people to
register, and they tell me they're
afraid to."
One theme that Soboh stressed
throughout his speech was the differ
ence between religion and culture.
He said he wanted to dispel the neg
ative stereotypes that are spread on
television about Islam.
"One day I was giving a speech
and I said Islam does not force
women to wear scarves over their
heads," he said."A woman said.'You
are lying. 1 saw it on TV.' That isn't
Islam, that's culture."
Soboh described the six pillars of
Iman — beliefs that Islam pro
scribes its followers must hold —
and the five pillars of Islam — ac
tions such as prayers and a declara
tion of faith that Muslims must per
form throughout their lives.
"Once the Muslim does these five
pillars, then he can start building on
his religion and his life," Soboh said.
After explaining the tenets of

Islam, Soboh worked to dispel nega
tive stereotypes, specifically about
women in Islam. Muslim women
were granted by the Koran the rights
to vote, hold positions in govern
ment, choose their marriage partner,
obtain education and own property.
Soboh called the prophet Mo
hammed "the first feminist."
Soboh concluded his speech by
urging the audience not to judge
Muslims based on stereotypes
spread through the press.
"Many bad things are happening
in the Muslim world," he cautioned.
"I want you to imagine poor people
living under oppression. Regardless
of religion, bad things will happen.
But there are also good things hap
pening in the Muslim world."
Shakir said he was happy with the
event's outcome, and audience
members seemed similarly pleased.
"I thought it was really nice,"
Abdul-Karim said. "I didn't know
what to expect, they had a lot of
things: the Koranic recitation, the
speech, the food. Everything was
great." .
Islam Awareness Month kicked
off last night with an evening of
music, food and information titled
"Islam 101: Sounds of Islam."
The event, presented by the Is
lamic Society of Stanford University
(ISSU) and the Muslim Student
Awareness Network (MSAN), was
attended by approximately 75 peo
ple and held in Bechtel International
Center.
To begin the evening, MSAN
President Omar Shakir, a junior,
noted the growth of Stanford's Mus
lim community over the past several
decades. Currently, there are approx
imately 12 student groups — includ
ing the Muslim Students Awareness
Network and Pakistanis at Stanford
(PAS), among others — who are af
filiated with Stanford's Muslim com
munity.

Shakir then announced a formal
petition for a Muslim Cultural Com
munity Center to be built on campus
and a full-time Muslim community
center director to run it.
"We have no real voice in the
University and no connection to
University resources except on a stu
dent-to-student basis, rendering our
community invisible and inaccessi
ble to most," he said. "We, as a cultur
al community, feel we've reached a
point where we need a communal
gathering place that also can serve as
a central point for the Stanford com
munity to learn about Islam and
Muslim culture in a comfortable en
vironment."
According to the proposal, Stan
ford's Muslim community has no
"meeting space, office, event, storage
or community congregation space
on campus" and is "instead allotted
only a small prayer room in Old
Union."
Audience reception to the an
nouncement was warm.
"This is the first I have heard

Abdul-Karim. "I am so excited. It's
so hard now, I never know where
things are going to be, you have to
keep checking your e-mail. This is
wonderful."
After the announcement, In
donesian food was served, including
such dishes as osing kacang and gado

and Fulbright Scholar Ony Jamhari
gave a short lecture on the country,
which has 197 million Muslim citi
