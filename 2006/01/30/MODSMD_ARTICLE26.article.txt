## Flicks combines Sunday screenings 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM STAFF WRITER 
Eschewing tradition. Ricks management has de
cided to alter the weekly Flicks schedule for Winter
Quarter 2006, debuting each week's film only once,
at an 8 p.m. screening.
A Flicks press release pinned the change to the
service's "constant effort to improve the movie
going experience for everyone in the Stanford com
munity."
A part of the ASSU's Stanford Student Enter
prises (SSE), Flicks has for at least 15 years held two
screenings on Sunday nights, one at 7 p.m. and one at
10 p.m.according to sophomore Zach Kinloch, man
ager of Flicks.
In an interview with The Daily, Kinloch said the
change in schedule was enacted "in an effort to in
crease attendance," which he reported "has been in
decline the past few quarters."
To that end, the Ricks team held focus groups,
composed of both undergraduate and graduate stu
dents, last spring quarter and early fall quarter.
Kinloch observed that many students are "feeling
the stress of classes," With the screening ending late
on Sunday nights for 10 p.m. shows, students were
often left "with no chance to get back to work."
The change, however, has drawn mixed student
support.
"I am less inclined to finish my work by 8 p.m.,"
said freshman Elizabeth Doyle. "And I would feel
bad about going if I had work."

Freshman Zach Chotzen-Freund concurred.
"[The 8 p.m. show] is a more inconvenient time," he
said."l liked it later,so I could get work done and let
myself go a little."
The new show schedule "could encourage more
people to go," reasoned sophomore Andrew
Buchan, who said he does not attend Flicks often.
Now in its 78th year, Flicks has been breaking
even in recent years, drawing an average crowd of
about 700 per showing, according to Kinloch.
The financial aspect, however, was only a minor
consideration, said Kinloch.
Instead, a consensus vote was taken by SSE Chief
Executive Officer Justin Fishner-Wolfson.SSE Gen
eral Manager Shannon Enox, Kinloch and his co
managers— sophomores Wade Ray and Shehu
Garda.
Historically, Flicks has had its lowest atten
dance during winter quarters, and the service's ad
ministrators decided it would be an apt time to try
the completely experimental format. Kinloch
added that before making the change permanent,
the team will evaluate the response at the end of
the quarter.
Right now, explained Kinloch, "it's pretty evenly
balanced" between those who support the new
schedule and those who argue they might be "ruin
ing a Flicks tradition or have conflicts."
"Although 8 p.m. is not the traditional time," stat
ed a press release issued by Flicks management,
"feedback suggests that an earlier start and end time
will allow students to avoid the cold winter nights

and accommodate their late-night studying before
early morning classes."
Kinloch noted that during the focus groups, fresh
men seemed most receptive to the new program, as
they had "not yet established [Flicks] as a part of
their weekly schedule."
Upperclassmen, however, might have already
worked out a schedule of "doing stuff before Flicks
at 10 p.m.."
The management is working on numerous other
improvements to the service. According to their
press release, "Flicks is negotiating with Vice
Provost John Bravman to provide a much needed
Marguerite shuttle for distant west campus resi
dents."
In addition. Kinloch explained that Flicks is
working on numerous other marketing events, such
as inviting actress Reese Witherspoon — who
briefly attended Stanford from 1995 to 1996 — to
answer questions accompanying the showing of her
film, "Walk the Line."
The management will have a good sense of what
to do spring quarter within the next two to three
shows.
"I went to one of the 8 p.m. shows and it wasn't all
that full." said freshman Anuraag Chigurupati. "It
makes sense for them to consolidate the showings to
fill the theater."
"We were thinking of a way — how do we revive
Flicks?" said Kinloch. "We thought maybe a time
change would bring people in and make this a big
campus-wide event again."
