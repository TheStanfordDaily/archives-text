to Native American students, staff

The statement seemed to come in
part as a response to a letter deliv

the Stanford American Indian Orga

attention from local media outlets.

condemned by University President
John Hennessy.
stakeholders to respect Native
Americans, invoking the Fundamen
tal Standard in his press release.
"I urge all members of the Stan
ford community to comply with our
policy that use of the symbol be dis
continued," he said. "Moreover, I ask
that we all take seriously the com
mitment in the Fundamental Stan
dard to treat all members of the
community with respect. Such re
spect is central to our existence as an
academic community, and each of us
has a responsibility to uphold this
commitment."
The letter's authors told The
Daily that they were pleased with
Hennessy's statement, adding, how
ever, that they hope more is done.
"The Stanford American Indian
Organization is very pleased with
both responses by Hennessy and
Dean Boardman," Patten and
Brossy wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily. "We appreciated their time
ly reaction to our concerns and will
continue to hold them accountable
for upholding the policy when fu
ture mascot incidents occur. De

spite this tremendous step for
ward, we still hope to arrange a
meeting with Hennessy to recom
mend a more stringent policy for
reacting to the wearing, printing,
selling or promotion of the Stan
ford Indian mascot by Stanford af
filiated parties."
One of the groups that was re
cently drawn criticism for its use of
the Indian on Big Game T-shirts re
sponded favorably to the president's
statement.
"Sigma Chi fully supports the
statement released by President
Hennessy regarding the use of the
Indian caricature," said Sigma Chi
President Kunal V. Gullapalli, a sen
ior, in an e-mail to The Daily. "Our
chapter plans on meeting with Uni
versity officials and student groups
to resolve this issue and address any
remaining concerns."
The Indian symbol, which had
been the official Stanford mascot,
was rejected by former University
President Richard Lyman in 1972 at
the insistence of Native American
groups and some alumni. Since then,
the same Native American groups
have been watchful of any use of
what they hold to be an offensive
symbol.
In preparation for Big Game, the
Sigma Chi fraternity prepared shirts

featuring the Indian killing a bear,
the symbol of Stanford's arch-rival,
U.C. Berkeley.
In a separate instance, an alum
nus of the sailing team printed T
shirts invoking the logo. An adver
tisement was later placed in the sail
ing team's newsletter to sell five left
over shirts.
Both parties backed down when
Native American groups voiced con
cerns. Sigma Chi said they had not
intended to offend Native Ameri
cans. Instead, they said they felt the
Indian highlighted memories of tra
dition and history.
An Athletics Department
spokesman said that the sailing team
will print a letter of apology in their
next newsletter.
"I fully support President Hen
nessv's comments," Sailing team
head coach Jay Kehoe told The
Daily. "We were in complete error
in printing that shirt and using it for
anything. It was an alumni-based
shirt and our alumni have been
written a letter to and asked not to
use it."
The University administration's
swift condemnation of groups using
the Indian logo stands in stark con
trast to some other universities
around the country where adminis
trators are joining prominent alum

ni and students to actively fight an
August NCAA decree that they re
move Indian imagery and mascots.
In some cases, as with the Semi
nole Tribe of Florida. Native Amer
ican groups have vocally supported
the use of the Indian as a mascot, ar
guing that it represents courage,
fierceness and other positive char
acteristics — not hostility or
racism.
Presidents at both the University
of North Dakota and Florida State
University have been vocal support
ers of their use of Indian symbols.
"That the NCAA would now
label our close bond with the Semi
nole Tribe of Florida as culturally
'hostile and abusive' is both outra
geous and insulting," said Florida
State President T.K. Wetherell in an
August statement on his school's
Web site.
"Our logo was designed by a
very well-respected American-Indi
an artist," said North Dakota Presi
dent Charles Kupchella in an open
letter sent to the NCAA and posted
online. "The logo is not unlike those
found on United States coins and
North Dakota highway patrol cars
and highway signs. So we can't
imagine that the use of this image is
abusive or hostile in any sense of
these words."
