# Under Review
## Student publication to be tried by University 
### KAT LEWIN STAFF WRITER 
East Campus became the site of civil
disobedience on Jan. 21, when staff mem
bers of The Stanford Review distributed
copies of their publication in violation of
dorm distribution policies. Due to these
actions. The Stanford Review now faces
indictment by the University and a possi
ble appearance before the Organization
al Conduct Board.
"From our calculations, we ended up
distributing about a thousand issues
door-to-door," said sophomore Ryan
Tracey, editor in chief of The Stanford
Review. "We covered Stern, Branner,
Manzanita and all of Wilbur besides

Otero — they were having a ski trip, so
no one would let us in. We would have
distributed there too if we could."
Resident fellows at the dorms that re
ceived copies of The Review said they
were displeased with the breach of distri
bution policy.
Godfrey Mungal, resident fellow at
Rinconada, said ITie Review "violated
our policy and we were not happy. A com
mon location for all distribution is best —
actually not unlike a person's real home,
which is what the dorm is meant to be."
According to Tracey, he and two other
members on The Review's staff — then-
Editor in Chief Alex Medearis and Editor
in Chief Emeritus Ben Guthrie — re
ceived an e-mail from Dean of Students
Morris Graves informing them that the
Office of Residental Education had filed
a formal complaint against the publica
tion on Jan. 24. The complaint charged
The Review with violating both the distri

bution policy and the Fundamental Stan
dard.
Laura Harrison, director of the
Women's Community Center, has been
charged with investigating the case,
Tracey said. She will interview all parties
involved in the policy violation in order
to compile an investigative report.
Graves will use the report to determine
whether the incident warrants review by
the Organizational Conduct Board
(OCB).
"There's a chance he can throw away
the report,"Tracey said. "But most likely.
Graves is going to put together an OCB
hearing. They'll decide if we are guilty of
the formal complaint, and if so, they will
decide a punishment."
According to the official OCB Web
site, possible punishment includes educa-
tional sanctions, monetary fines and
removal of University recognition.
In spite of the indictment,
Guthrie said he defends The Re
view's decision to distribute in vio
lation of the current policy.
"It was an intentional act of civil
disobedience in protest of a rule
that we believe to be unjust," he
added. "Door-to-door distribution
is essential for the publications
community, essential for students
interested in reading our publica
tions and consistent with the values
for which both Stanford and Resi
dential Education stand."
The incident was another
episode in the ongoing battle be
tween some student groups and the

Office of Residential Education's
official "opt-in" policy for door-to
door distribution of student publi
cations. According to ASSU Senate
Chair Chris Nguyen, a junior, the
student body voted in last spring's
election to replace the current poli
cy with an "opt-out policy," which
would allow door-to-door distribu
tion in dorms by default. However,
Residential Education has not
changed its stance.
"I view this as a freedom of press
issue." Nguyen said. "Banning door
to-door distribution on this campus
is a way to make sure that papers
don't get viewed. It seems that by
restricting door-to-door distribu
tion we stifle free speech."
To this end, Guthrie said he and
Tracey recently co-founded the
Stanford Review Distribution
Commission, an ad hoc committee
within the Review.
"As part of the commission we

invited other Review members to
brainstorm ideas about how to
more effectively distribute our
newspaper," Tracey said. "We came
up with ideas about news racks, dis
tribution patterns, but we realized
that none of this meant a lot. We de
cided at that meeting to go ahead
and distribute door-to-door for our
next issue."
The Stanford Review Distribu
tion Commission has also been
working with The Stanford Progres
sive "to reach out to the other pub
lications and make a joint statement
to the administration," Guthrie
said.
Sophomore Lindsay Reinsmith,
managing editor of The Progressive,
agreed that she considers door-to
door distribution a hot-button issue.
"Door-to-door distribution is
nice in that it allows students to ac
cess publications," she said. "They
have to make literally no effect to

get publications produced on cam
pus. However, it creates a mess of
paper on campus, and students
don't necessarily want their own
copies of publications. You have to
find a balance here between allow
ing students to find ready access to
material without overwhelming
them."
Some, however, said they felt
that allowing door-to-door distribu
tion would have a negative impact
on student life.
"The major point of a university
is to educate its students." said Lan
tana Resident Fellow Brent Sock
ness. "There should be spaces left in
the university — e.g. the classroom,
residence halls, even the athletic
fields — where students aren't
being marketed to all the time. If
you allow door-to-door distribution
to go widespread, it could be like
not having a junk mail filter on your
e-mail inbox. Think about it."

residence halls, even the athletic
fields — where students aren't
being marketed to all the time. If
you allow door-to-door distribution
to go widespread, it could be like

e-mail inbox. Think about it."
East Campus became the site of civil
disobedience on Jan. 21, when staff mem
bers of The Stanford Review distributed
copies of their publication in violation of
dorm distribution policies. Due to these
actions. The Stanford Review now faces
indictment by the University and a possi
ble appearance before the Organization
al Conduct Board.
"From our calculations, we ended up
distributing about a thousand issues
door-to-door," said sophomore Ryan
Tracey, editor in chief of The Stanford
Review. "We covered Stern, Branner,
Manzanita and all of Wilbur besides

Otero — they were having a ski trip, so
no one would let us in. We would have
distributed there too if we could."
Resident fellows at the dorms that re
ceived copies of The Review said they
were displeased with the breach of distri
bution policy.
Godfrey Mungal, resident fellow at
Rinconada, said ITie Review "violated
our policy and we were not happy. A com
mon location for all distribution is best —
actually not unlike a person's real home,
which is what the dorm is meant to be."
According to Tracey, he and two other
members on The Review's staff — then-
Editor in Chief Alex Medearis and Editor
in Chief Emeritus Ben Guthrie — re
ceived an e-mail from Dean of Students
Morris Graves informing them that the
Office of Residental Education had filed
a formal complaint against the publica
tion on Jan. 24. The complaint charged
The Review with violating both the distri

bution policy and the Fundamental Stan
dard.
Laura Harrison, director of the
Women's Community Center, has been
charged with investigating the case,
Tracey said. She will interview all parties
involved in the policy violation in order
to compile an investigative report.
Graves will use the report to determine
whether the incident warrants review by
the Organizational Conduct Board
(OCB).
"There's a chance he can throw away
the report,"Tracey said. "But most likely.
Graves is going to put together an OCB
hearing. They'll decide if we are guilty of
the formal complaint, and if so, they will
decide a punishment."
According to the official OCB Web
site, possible punishment includes educa-
tional sanctions, monetary fines and
removal of University recognition.
In spite of the indictment,
Guthrie said he defends The Re
view's decision to distribute in vio
lation of the current policy.
"It was an intentional act of civil
disobedience in protest of a rule
that we believe to be unjust," he
added. "Door-to-door distribution
is essential for the publications
community, essential for students
interested in reading our publica
tions and consistent with the values
for which both Stanford and Resi
dential Education stand."
The incident was another
episode in the ongoing battle be
tween some student groups and the

Office of Residential Education's
official "opt-in" policy for door-to
door distribution of student publi
cations. According to ASSU Senate
Chair Chris Nguyen, a junior, the
student body voted in last spring's
election to replace the current poli
cy with an "opt-out policy," which
would allow door-to-door distribu
tion in dorms by default. However,
Residential Education has not
changed its stance.
"I view this as a freedom of press
issue." Nguyen said. "Banning door
to-door distribution on this campus
is a way to make sure that papers
don't get viewed. It seems that by
restricting door-to-door distribu
tion we stifle free speech."
To this end, Guthrie said he and
Tracey recently co-founded the
Stanford Review Distribution
Commission, an ad hoc committee
within the Review.
"As part of the commission we

invited other Review members to
brainstorm ideas about how to
more effectively distribute our
newspaper," Tracey said. "We came
up with ideas about news racks, dis
tribution patterns, but we realized
that none of this meant a lot. We de
cided at that meeting to go ahead
and distribute door-to-door for our
next issue."
The Stanford Review Distribu
tion Commission has also been
working with The Stanford Progres
sive "to reach out to the other pub
lications and make a joint statement
to the administration," Guthrie
said.
Sophomore Lindsay Reinsmith,
managing editor of The Progressive,
agreed that she considers door-to
door distribution a hot-button issue.
"Door-to-door distribution is
nice in that it allows students to ac
cess publications," she said. "They
have to make literally no effect to

get publications produced on cam
pus. However, it creates a mess of
paper on campus, and students
don't necessarily want their own
copies of publications. You have to
find a balance here between allow
ing students to find ready access to
material without overwhelming
them."
Some, however, said they felt
that allowing door-to-door distribu
tion would have a negative impact
on student life.
"The major point of a university
is to educate its students." said Lan
tana Resident Fellow Brent Sock
ness. "There should be spaces left in
the university — e.g. the classroom,
residence halls, even the athletic
fields — where students aren't
being marketed to all the time. If
you allow door-to-door distribution
to go widespread, it could be like
not having a junk mail filter on your
e-mail inbox. Think about it."
