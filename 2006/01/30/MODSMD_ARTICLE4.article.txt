# Under Review
## Student publication to be tried by University 
### KAT LEWIN STAFF WRITER 
East Campus became the site of civil
disobedience on Jan. 21, when staff mem
bers of The Stanford Review distributed
copies of their publication in violation of
dorm distribution policies. Due to these
actions. The Stanford Review now faces
indictment by the University and a possi
ble appearance before the Organization
al Conduct Board.
"From our calculations, we ended up
distributing about a thousand issues
door-to-door," said sophomore Ryan
Tracey, editor in chief of The Stanford
Review. "We covered Stern, Branner,
Manzanita and all of Wilbur besides

Otero — they were having a ski trip, so
no one would let us in. We would have
distributed there too if we could."
Resident fellows at the dorms that re
ceived copies of The Review said they
were displeased with the breach of distri
bution policy.
Godfrey Mungal, resident fellow at
Rinconada, said ITie Review "violated
our policy and we were not happy. A com
mon location for all distribution is best —
actually not unlike a person's real home,
which is what the dorm is meant to be."
According to Tracey, he and two other
members on The Review's staff — then-
Editor in Chief Alex Medearis and Editor
in Chief Emeritus Ben Guthrie — re
ceived an e-mail from Dean of Students
Morris Graves informing them that the
Office of Residental Education had filed
a formal complaint against the publica
tion on Jan. 24. The complaint charged
The Review with violating both the distri

bution policy and the Fundamental Stan
dard.
Laura Harrison, director of the
Women's Community Center, has been
charged with investigating the case,
Tracey said. She will interview all parties
involved in the policy violation in order
to compile an investigative report.
Graves will use the report to determine
whether the incident warrants review by
the Organizational Conduct Board
(OCB).
"There's a chance he can throw away
the report,"Tracey said. "But most likely.
Graves is going to put together an OCB
hearing. They'll decide if we are guilty of
the formal complaint, and if so, they will
decide a punishment."
According to the official OCB Web
site, possible punishment includes educa-
