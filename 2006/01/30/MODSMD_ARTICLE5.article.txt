## Female grad students get maternity time University implements pregancy accomodations for mothers-to-be 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
At last Thursday's Faculty Senate meeting. Uni
versity officials announced a groundbreaking new
maternity policy for graduate students, becoming
the second school — after MIT — to offer preg
nant female graduate students a full spectrum of ac
commodations.
"The policy is intended to address the fact that a
women's primary child-bearing years are the same
years that she's likely to be in graduate school and
establishing her career," said Associate Dean of
Graduate Policy Gail Mahood. as she unveiled the
policy Thursday night. "So our main goal was that
we maintain women graduate students all the way
through the academic pipeline."
The plan offers a two-quarter academic accom
modation period, during which students may post
pone course assignments and examinations. Women
will remain eligible for full-time registration during
their pregnancy. Pregnant students will be granted a
one-quarter extension on all departmental require
ments and will be excused from any regular TA or
RA duties for a six-week period during which they
will continue to receive support.
"We're still expecting the affected students to
participate in coursework and research," said Ma
hood. "Even if it is in a somewhat lower capacity."
Nationwide, pregnancy during graduate school
has presented a dilemma for many female profes
sionals and academics. According to ITie Boston
Globe, in fields such as biology — which is evenly
split between men and women as far as numbers of
doctorate recipients — the number of female assis-
tant professors and full professors
drops dramatically. This is known
as the "leaky pipeline" phenome
non. Many women train profession
ally in the sciences but never enter
the academic profession. Pregnan
cy is a major factor in this occur
rence, a finding corroborated by a
2002 report by the National Coun
cil for Research on Women.
Understandably, Stanford's fe
male graduate students expressed
enthusiasm for the policy; however,
many said they felt the need to cre
ate focus groups for the purpose of
addressing policy changes.
"Since Stanford is leading the
way with this new policy, I think it
would be helpful for the University
to havq an annual focus group con
sisting of students who take advan
tage of the childbirth policy to as
sess whether any policy reforms are
needed," said second-year law stu
dent Jenny Allen, co-chair of the

Graduate Student Council. "Such a
review process will improve overall
quality of life for female graduate
students with newborns, whose
ability to balance motherhood and
lab or school is very inspiring to
me."
Last November, the Chemistry
Department initiated its own policy
allowing female students a 12-week
accommodation period to prepare
for and care for a newborn. During
this time, students would technical
ly be enrolled full-time. However,
as the policy states, "[this time] is
intended to serve as an accommo
dation and not a leave of
absence...lt is the student's respon
sibility to make arrangements with
faculty and with Student Services
for course completion and for con
tinuation of teaching and/or re
search activities before and follow
ing the twelve-week accommoda
tion period."
"Hopefully, this action by our
University will lead to other insti
tutions following suit," said Chem
istry Department Chair Richard
Zare. "It really is important for
leading institutions of higher edu
cation to lead. I am proud of Stan
ford for leading the way."
Though the University has re
ceived high praise from peer insti
tutions for the policy, no other
school has yet to follow suit.
