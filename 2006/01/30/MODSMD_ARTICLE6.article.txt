lay the end of this year, the hard
hats will come off, according to the
Department of Project Manage
ment, which anticipates that the
Stanford Stadium and renovated
Old Union projects will be com
pleted by September 2006 and Fall
2006, respectively.
According to Jack Cleary, direc
tor of Project Management, nei
ther site has experienced any sig
nificant budgeting problems or
scheduling delays.
Since the Stanford Stadium's
press building and seats were de
molished in November 2005, con
struction crews have completed
rough grading, installed under
ground electrical and other utilities
and built structural columns,Cleary
said. In the next few months, all
structural wOrk — including foun
dations, walls and piers, as well as
backfill mechanically-stabilized
earth walls, a foundation for the
press box and three newly-dug tun
nels — should be finished.

With regard to Old Union,
Geary said that all occupants have
been relocated to allow for selected
interior demolition. Over the next
few weeks, construction fencing will
be placed around the building as
the interior demolition begins. Ad
ditional construction will occur
with Board of Trustees approval.

At the beginning of the 2005-06
academic year, the ASSU worked
with the Office of Student Activi
ties to find space alternatives for in
dividual students and clubs that
traditionally resided in Old Union.
"I'm really excited to see what
the new Old Union will look like be
cause I truly believe it has the poten
tial to become a central hotspot for
students, which is something I've
found to be lacking in my under

graduate career," said ASSU Presi
dent Melanie Kannokada, a senior.
Since the recent site of Com
mencement — Stanford Stadium
will not be available in 2(H)6 due to
construction, the ASSU has also
partnered with Stanford seniors and
administrators to develop an alter
native solution. Graduation for the
Class 0f2006 will be held at the Stan
ford football practice field.
"The relocation of 2(K)6 Com
mencement discussions made it
clear to me that the most important
part of the ceremony is not the loca
tion, but being able to share the ex
perience with my family and closest
friends," Kannokada said.
Graduate Student Council Co-
Chair Thomas Lee,a fourth-year elec
trical engineering doctoral student, is
especially exited about how the two
projects will impact student life.
"In terms of Old Union, having
more student space in the center of
campus will be a great thing for stu
dent life," Lee said."l hope that it will
serve as a social center and bring the
campus closer together. Plus a small

er, more intimate stadium will make
for a better football experience. I
hope the new facility translates into
more wins for the Cardinal."

Chief Executive Officer Justin Fish
ner-Wolfson believes that the reno
vation of Old Union is an opportuni
ty to revitalize space at the center of
campus, which will greatly benefit
student life.
"Space allocation is an incredibly
complicated process, and while the
University has involved students
during planning, they must continue
to work hard to ensure that the plans
are flexible as needs change," Fishn
er-Wolfson said. "Dean Boardman is
relatively new to the current plan,
but he has been very responsive, and
I expect the final product to be a vi
brant student center"
Students using the cultural centers
also expressed their satisfaction with
the improvements to Old Union.
"I'm glad to see that the Universi
ty is creating a central student servic
es center in Old Union." said first
year education doctoral student
Adam Bad Wound, who frequently
uses the Native American Cultural
Center. "It's nice to see a historical
building like Old Union being re
stored and its original presence pre
served."
