lay the end of this year, the hard
hats will come off, according to the
Department of Project Manage

Stanford Stadium and renovated
Old Union projects will be com

2006, respectively.
According to Jack Cleary, direc

ther site has experienced any sig
nificant budgeting problems or
scheduling delays.
Since the Stanford Stadium's
press building and seats were de
molished in November 2005, con
struction crews have completed
rough grading, installed under
ground electrical and other utilities
and built structural columns,Cleary
said. In the next few months, all
structural wOrk — including foun
dations, walls and piers, as well as
backfill mechanically-stabilized
earth walls, a foundation for the
press box and three newly-dug tun

With regard to Old Union,
Geary said that all occupants have
been relocated to allow for selected
interior demolition. Over the next
few weeks, construction fencing will
be placed around the building as
the interior demolition begins. Ad
ditional construction will occur
with Board of Trustees approval.

traditionally resided in Old Union.
