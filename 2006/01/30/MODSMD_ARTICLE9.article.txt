# 1 Israel says no talks until Hamas renounces violence, vows to 'liquidate' attackers
## THE 						BIG STORY 
### JOSEF FEDERMAN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel's acting
prime minister on Sunday ruled out contacts
with a Palestinian government led by Hamas
unless the Islamic group renounces violence,
and the defense minister threatened to "liq
uidate" militants if they attack Israelis.
Acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert
said Israel will stop the monthly transfer of
tens of millions of dollars in tax rebates
and other funds to the Palestinian Author
ity if a Hamas government is installed.
With the latest comments, Israel
showed no signs of backing down from the
hard line it has taken since Hamas won a
surprising landslide victory in Palestinian
legislative elections last week.
Hamas, which opposes the existence of
Israel and has killed hundreds of Israelis in
suicide bomb attacks, is expected to lead
the next Palestinian government, hurting
the chances for a peace deal.
Also Sunday, about 7,(XK) Israeli securi
ty forces, anticipating violent resistance,
were training to dismantle two small West
Bank settlement outposts later this week,
police said. Resistance is expected to be
fierce in Amona and among Israeli squat
ters who took over an abandoned market
in the Palestinian city of Hebron.

Olmert, addressing the weekly meeting
of his Cabinet, said he has been in touch
with leaders around the world in recent
days and received support for the tough Is
raeli stance against Hamas.

"We clarified that without a clear aban
donment of the path of terror, a recogni
tion of Israel's right to exist in security and
peace... Israel won't have any contact with
the Palestinians," Olmert said. "These
principles are accepted by the internation
al community. On this issue, I don't intend
to make any compromises."
Hamas refuses to disarm or recognize
Israel, though it has hinted that it could
reach a long-term truce or other accom

modation with the Jewish state.

Israeli officials said the ban on contacts
did not extend to Palestinian leader Mah
moud Abbas, who accepts the Israeli con
ditions and is eager to resume peace talks.

Abbas was elected to a four-year term last
year and remains in power.
However, Olmert said Israel will not
hand over value added tax and customs
funds it collects on behalf of the Palestini
ans to a Hamas-led government.
Israel has "no intention" of sending
funds to terror groups, Olmert told a joint
news conference with Merkel.
Every month, Israel transfers an aver
age of $54 million collected at ports and
border crossings. In the past, Israel has
held up the transfers during times of ten
sion. Such a delay now would cripple the
cash-strapped Palestinian government.

Minister Shaul Mofaz said Hamas "is por
traying policies of responsibility" and even
has tried to restrain suicide attacks by the
radical Islamic Jihad group.
But earlier, Mofaz said Israel is pre
pared to kill Hamas militants if the group
resumes its attacks.
"Those who head terror organizations
and continue to engage in terror against
the state of Israel will be liquidated," he
told Channel 2 TV on Saturday night.
During five years of fighting with the
Palestinians, Israel killed dozens of Hamas
militants in airstrikes, including the
group's founder and spiritual leader.
Ahmed Yassin.
Since a cease-fire declaration last Feb
ruary, Hamas has not claimed involvement
in a suicide attack and Israel has not killed
any of the group's leaders.
Abbas, whose Fatah Party was routed in
last week's election, has asked Hamas to
form a new government and now must find
a way to work with the Islamists. The
arrangement could potentially put Hamas
in charge of some, if not all, of the 58,(XM)
Palestinian security forces.
