## Editorial University should do more to conserve energy 
### 
Stanford spent almost $4 million on elec
tricity and water in 2004. In addition to
utility costs, the University's energy use
exacts unknown but significant environmen
tal costs that we all have to hear. With this in
mind, the editorial hoard would like to take
the opportunity to commend Students for a
Sustainable Stanford and Residential and
Dining Enterprises for partnering on the
2006 Energy Bowl. The Editorial Board
agrees that significant steps can and should
be taken by the student body to conserve en
ergy and incentives should be put in place to
ensure their participation.
Energy use at Stanford largely suffers
from a common problem in economics
known as the "tragedy of the commons." Be
cause students living in dorms and Row
houses don't bear the costs of energy use in
dividually. they tend to over-consume elec
tricity and water. In the end. higher utility
prices may be passed on to future students in
the form of increased housing costs —
something no one wants — but any individ
ual's actions to reduce their own energy use
will have minimal effect on this price.
To force each student to pay their own
utilities cost would be infeasible and expen
sive. The Energy Bowl, however, which re
wards students for consuming less energy, is
a practical and rewarding solution to the sta
tus quo. Students should be rewarded for en
gaging in habits that reduce utility costs and
benefit the environment. One would hope
that these habits continue throughout one's
life as we all strive to be better environmen
tal citizens.
Based on last year's performance, we
know that the Stanford Energy Bowl is an ef
fective tool toward achieving measurable re
ductions in Stanford's energy usage. R&DE,

however, would do well to pass even more of
their cost savings from the competition on to
students. It might consider giving dorm com
plexes a certain percentage of their facility's
Energy Bowl utilities savings in a dorm fund
supplement. Dorms might continue to com
pete for additional prizes but all would be
given stronger incentives to conserve energy
regardless of their relative positions.
Furthermore, the idea that winning
dorms will receive free installations of ener
gy-saving appliances is disconcerting. Why
isn't the University itself seriously undertak
ing energy conservation and installing ener
gy-saving devices in all dorms? Even when
ignoring environmental costs, high fuel
prices coupled with long-term savings from
reduced energy consumption should pro
vide more than the sufficient impetus to in
stall energy-conserving devices now.
All of the reasons that Stanford should
continue its generally positive direction to
ward conservation can be based in cost-sav
ings for the University and, by extension, its
students.The University, however,should in
vest in energy conservation — even if it is
not financially cost-efficient — as part of its
role as a responsible global citizen. Rampant
energy use, if left unchecked, will continue to
accelerate the processes of global warming
and environmental degradation. Of course,
Stanford will not single-handedly stop all en
vironmental damage, but it still remains in
cumbent upon this University to do its part
to help the environment.
We again applaud the Students for a Sus
tainable Stanford and R&DE for continuing
the Energy Bowl. More has yet to be done,
however, and we encourage Stanford to act
responsibly by engaging in more extensive
future environmental initiatives.
