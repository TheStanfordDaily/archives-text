# The
						not-so-surreal life

Why is it that the stars of reality
shows always seem to lead lives
that are so much more interesting
than those of regular people? Granted,
there's something to be said for clever edit
ing and situational factors (who wouldn't
start to go a little crazy after spending weeks
on a deserted island?), but the fact still re
mains that — even off-screen — these are
probably not your run-of-the-mill people
with run-of-the-mill issues.
Reality TV couldn't be further from real
ity for us normal folk. 1 daresay that most of
us lead lives so humdrum that only de
pressed break-up victims flipping channels
at 3 a.m. and old ladies who can't figure out
how to work the remote control would
watch reality shows about our lives. A cam
eraman would have to follow the average
person around for days before he got even a
minute of footage worth airing. 1 can only
imagine what the first (and unless the net
work got really desperate, only) episode of
my family's reality show would be like:
(Mom, dad and teenage son at the dinner
table)
Dad: How was everybody's day?
Son: (shovels food in mouth) Fine, (shovels
more food in mouth)
Mom: I finished a week's worth of billing
today at the office.Then 1 volunteered at the
concession stand during the JV girls' bas
ketball game.
Dad: We should call Steph at school and tell
her all this. But first, let's do today's Sudoku
puzzle!
You are probably thinking, OK, so my

home life isn't all that exciting, but I'm at
college now! There are always events and
parties going on, stressed-out and/or drunk
people all over campus and enough twisted
relationships for everyone to be involved in
at least a couple of love triangles. There
must be the makings of a good reality show
somewhere in all that.
True enough; a college campus is a
cesspool lor drama. But let's compare the
drama of college life to the drama of televi
sion. A TV show might go something like
this:
(in the Stacks of Green)
Mike: (to himself) This bio test is going to
destroy me.
Random hot girl who just happens to be
roaming the library at this exact moment: I
know where there's a book that can give you
exactly what you need. Come with me.
(leads him into the depths of the Stacks)
(Cut to next day.)
Jim: Dude, how did you manage to ace that
test?
Mike: Let's just say I had some hands-on
practice last night.
