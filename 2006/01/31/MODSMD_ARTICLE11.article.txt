# The 						not-so-surreal life
## 
### 
Why is it that the stars of reality
shows always seem to lead lives
that are so much more interesting
than those of regular people? Granted,
there's something to be said for clever edit
ing and situational factors (who wouldn't
start to go a little crazy after spending weeks
on a deserted island?), but the fact still re
mains that — even off-screen — these are
probably not your run-of-the-mill people
with run-of-the-mill issues.
Reality TV couldn't be further from real
ity for us normal folk. 1 daresay that most of
us lead lives so humdrum that only de
pressed break-up victims flipping channels
at 3 a.m. and old ladies who can't figure out
how to work the remote control would
watch reality shows about our lives. A cam
eraman would have to follow the average
person around for days before he got even a
minute of footage worth airing. 1 can only
imagine what the first (and unless the net
work got really desperate, only) episode of
my family's reality show would be like:
(Mom, dad and teenage son at the dinner
table)
Dad: How was everybody's day?
Son: (shovels food in mouth) Fine, (shovels
more food in mouth)
Mom: I finished a week's worth of billing
today at the office.Then 1 volunteered at the
concession stand during the JV girls' bas
ketball game.
Dad: We should call Steph at school and tell
her all this. But first, let's do today's Sudoku
puzzle!
You are probably thinking, OK, so my

home life isn't all that exciting, but I'm at
college now! There are always events and
parties going on, stressed-out and/or drunk
people all over campus and enough twisted
relationships for everyone to be involved in
at least a couple of love triangles. There
must be the makings of a good reality show
somewhere in all that.
True enough; a college campus is a
cesspool lor drama. But let's compare the
drama of college life to the drama of televi
sion. A TV show might go something like
this:
(in the Stacks of Green)
Mike: (to himself) This bio test is going to
destroy me.
Random hot girl who just happens to be
roaming the library at this exact moment: I
know where there's a book that can give you
exactly what you need. Come with me.
(leads him into the depths of the Stacks)
(Cut to next day.)
Jim: Dude, how did you manage to ace that
test?
Mike: Let's just say I had some hands-on
practice last night.

(Cue laugh track to make audience
think horrible joke is funny)
In the Stanford version, however,
events would play out quite differ
ently:
(in the Stacks of Green)
Mike: (to himself) This bio test is
going to destroy me.
Nerdy guy at the next table: Shut
up! People are trying to get work
done!
(Cut to next day)
Jim: How did you do on the test? I
was so worried that I was going to
get an A-minus, which would have
ruined my transcript and my chances
of getting in to Harvard Medical
School, but I managed to pull off an
A. You failed the first midterm,
right? Don't worry; they may still let
you into a state med school if you did
well enough on this one. So, what did
you get? Huh? Huh?
Mike: Bite me. (goes hack to his
dorm room and drinks cheap liquor
until he passes out alone on his
futon)

Even when drama seems to fill
our lives, it is rarely worthy of a spot
in the prime time line-up; nobody
wants to watch a freshman freak out
about his first set of exams, nor are
they nearly as interested as you are
in staring at the phone for hours
waiting for that guy from your math
class to call. Besides, people like TV
shows with happy endings — or at
least exciting, dramatic finales —
not stories that trail off into noth
ingness like so many do in real life.
I'm not saying that real life is bor
ing (though it does have its boring
moments — but that's another
story for another day). But it's so
much more fulfilling to get emo
tionally involved in an exaggerated
scenario that we know will work out
eventually, regardless of how bad
things get in the meantime. And, if
nothing else, it makes our own is
sues seem a little more bearable by
comparison.

Would your life make a good reality
TV show? Pitch your idea to
Stephanie at salessi@stanford.edu.
But be forewarned; she has no Holly
wood connections whatsoever, so
don't expect to see yourself on the sil
ver screen anytime soon. She is more
likely to sell your story to the Nation
al Enquirer.

Mike: (to himself) This bio test is going to
destroy me.
Random hot girl who just happens to be
roaming the library at this exact moment: I
know where there's a book that can give you
exactly what you need. Come with me.
(leads him into the depths of the Stacks)
(Cut to next day.)
Jim: Dude, how did you manage to ace that
test?
Mike: Let's just say I had some hands-on
practice last night.

(Cue laugh track to make audience
think horrible joke is funny)
In the Stanford version, however,
events would play out quite differ

Mike: (to himself) This bio test is
going to destroy me.
Nerdy guy at the next table: Shut
up! People are trying to get work
done!
(Cut to next day)
Jim: How did you do on the test? I
was so worried that I was going to
get an A-minus, which would have
ruined my transcript and my chances
of getting in to Harvard Medical
School, but I managed to pull off an
A. You failed the first midterm,
right? Don't worry; they may still let
you into a state med school if you did
well enough on this one. So, what did
you get? Huh? Huh?
Mike: Bite me. (goes hack to his
dorm room and drinks cheap liquor
until he passes out alone on his
futon)

Even when drama seems to fill
our lives, it is rarely worthy of a spot
in the prime time line-up; nobody
wants to watch a freshman freak out
about his first set of exams, nor are
they nearly as interested as you are
in staring at the phone for hours
waiting for that guy from your math
class to call. Besides, people like TV
shows with happy endings — or at
least exciting, dramatic finales —
not stories that trail off into noth
ingness like so many do in real life.
I'm not saying that real life is bor
ing (though it does have its boring
moments — but that's another
story for another day). But it's so
much more fulfilling to get emo
tionally involved in an exaggerated
scenario that we know will work out
eventually, regardless of how bad
things get in the meantime. And, if
nothing else, it makes our own is
sues seem a little more bearable by
comparison.

Would your life make a good reality
TV show? Pitch your idea to
Stephanie at salessi@stanford.edu.
But be forewarned; she has no Holly
wood connections whatsoever, so
don't expect to see yourself on the sil
ver screen anytime soon. She is more
likely to sell your story to the Nation
al Enquirer.
