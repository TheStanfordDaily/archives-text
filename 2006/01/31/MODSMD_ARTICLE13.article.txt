# So many addictions, so little time
## 
### 
Most of my life revolves around some
form of addiction — coffee, alcohol,
music, rejection. Addictive personal
ities run in my family.
Speed
As a former speed freak, my father told
me if 1 ever did uppers, he would track me
down and kill me. I always respected this
opinion because my father is obviously
speaking from experience.Then 1 read David
Sedaris. Much of "Me Talk Pretty One Day"
is a nuanced portrayal of the dangers of ad
diction. This message, however, was almost
entirely lost on me. Sedaris wrote, "Speed
eliminates all doubt. Am 1 smart enough?
Will people like me? These are questions for
insecure potheads. A speed enthusiast knows
that everything he says or does is brilliant.
The upswing is that, having eliminated the
need for both eating and sleeping, you have a
full 24 hours a day to spread your charm and
talent." I couldn't imagine a better drug for
an insecure intellectual with OCD and ADD.
But my father's words have stuck with me,
and 1 have yet to try the stuff. I just live vicar
iously through SAE.
However, I'm currently hoping that 1 can
spend my late-20s as a international coke-ad
dled literati bisexual playboy Yes, I have been
reading "Lunar Park."
Coffee
Instead of meth, I, like most Stanford stu
dents, solve my near-constant exhaustion with
caffeine. In high school. I fed my nascent caf
feine addiction with Jolt Cola. For those of you
who have never experienced the joy of Jolt, it's
like the crack cocaine form of Coca Cola —

thicker, sweeter and more caffeinated. I've
since replaced this with the equivalent adult
addiction — coffee.
My roommate and I spent a quarter and a
half going on late-night Starbucks runs, de
bating the relative merits of Moonbeans ver
sus Peerless Coffee (it's in the Bookstore if
you haven't found it yet — it's one of the bet
ter cups of coffee on campus), and bemoan
ing how amazingly bad Peet's (and, by asso
ciation, the CoHo) is. So we decided to set up
our own coffee brewing operation in our
room.
Which has been a mild disaster on multi
ple levels. Our room now permanently smells
like a boutique coffee shop. All of our cloth
ing is covered in a thin film of coffee grinds,
and our desks with coffee rings. All the time
saved not driving to Starbucks is spent debat
ing which of the horribly imprecise settings
on our electric kettle works best in our
espresso press.
TV
Remember when TV sucked? When being
addicted to TV was considered unhealthy?
There was a time, in recent memory even,
when leaving a party early to catch the latest
installment of "24" was frowned upon. People

who were addicted to serialized television
shows (then called "soap operas"), were
known as "white trash."
But then HBO had to go screw it up for all
of us snobs, who had formerly watched noth
ing but Britcoms and "Seinfeld" reruns. When
HBO decided to make shows worth watching.
Tivo gave us control of our television sched
ules. Then came the "Sex and the City"
episode (on HBO) in which Miranda fell in
love with her Tivo, and the unholy cycle was
completed.
1 guess I couldn't escape my grandmoth
er's genes — I've got my soaps now. too.
There's "Desperate Housewives" (which
started life as an amazing black comedy and is
now a subpar soap), "Battlestar Galactica"
(soap... in... spaaaaace), "Lost" (instead of
amnesia and backstabbing wives,"Lost"gives
us black smoke monsters and a clairvoyant
kid) and"The OC" (which has never been
anything but a soap).
"The OC" is the worst offender in the
bunch. Like almost all television in which ac
tors facing the prospect of turning 30 get to
play teenagers. "The OC" is all about trying to
sell a high school experience no one ever real
ly had. No one's friends are that beautiful, that
incestuous or that rich. Couples don't come in
perfectly-matched pairs. Dorks don't date the
girl-next-door, and airheads don't earn near
perfect scores on their SATs.
The show is really just an insidious mar
keting campaign for the music industry McG
is expecting viewers will be compelled to buy
Phantom Planet's "The Guest" so they can
play "California" while driving down the 101
