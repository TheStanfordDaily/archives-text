## Cutting loans will hurt thousands 
### KAI STINCHCOMBE 
Congress is one vote away from approving a budget
that would deal a devastating blow to those of us who
weren't lucky enough to be born into families that can af
ford $40,(XX) a year for tuition. Tomorrow, U.S. legislators
are scheduled to vote on a $12.7 billion cut to higher ed
ucation loans, which would make college out of reach for
many qualified children. This is the largest cut in the his
tory of federal student loans.
For many Americans, loans are the only way to afford
a college education. Undergraduates typically leave with
around $18,(XX) in loans, while graduate students typical
ly leave with approximately $32.(XX). Total student loans
taken out in the last decade have grown over 1(X) percent.
Under the proposed bill, 70 percent of the savings
would come directly out of the pockets of students and
their families through interest rate hikes. Interest rates
on Stafford loans and PLUS loans would be increased by
about 25 percent of the current rate. The maximum
amount for Pell grants was held constant for the fourth
year in a row. despite the double-digit percent increases

in tuition across the country, adding insult to injury to the
5.3 million students that depend on these grants.
Every year, 2(X).(XK) high school students in America
forego college for financial reasons. Squeezing students
out of college will hurt our international competitiveness,
slow our economy and increase dependence on public
support programs from people who can't find jobs in a
knowledge-based economy without a college education.
If we wanted to reduce the deficit, stopping the Pease
provision tax cut and the personal exemption phase-out
—97 percent of which are for people making over
$2(X),CXX) a year — would be a great place to start. Telling
poor kids they can't go to college anymore is the wrong
priority for America. We shouldn't have to be lucky to be
able to afford a college education.
