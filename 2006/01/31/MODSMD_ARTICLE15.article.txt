T-shirts are not Fundamental
Standard violations
I sympathize with Native Ameri
cans who are offended by the Stan
ford Indian: I know the deep pain
and feelings of violation that aT-shirt
can cause. I am Estonian. Every
Lenin or CCCP T-shirt I see reminds
me of my grandparents' flight from
their native land, of 50 years of brutal
communist dictatorship and of the
one-third of the Estonian population
that the Soviet government mur
dered. imprisoned or forced into
exile.
But I do not assume that people
who wear Mao or Lenin T-shirts
want to offend me. However mis
guided their choice, their sentiment
probably has more to do with fight
ing for social justice or dressing fash
ionably than with offending the vic
tims of communism. To equate their
fashion expression to Fundamental
Standard violations like assault or

fraud would make Stanford's admin
istration no better than Mao or Stal
in. That would truly desecrate the
memory of every victim of commu
nism.

Google/porn issue is about
governmental power
In Chris Holt's column yesterday
("Screw with the government," Jan.
30), he claimed that the government
requested information from Google
to investigate child pornography,
when in reality it is looking into chil
dren's ability to access porn. This is
an important distinction, as every
one agrees that child pornography
should be stopped, but access protec
tions are often little more than a
form of censorship.
The issue at hand is less about
personal privacy — as the data re

quested is anonymous — and more
about checking governmental
power. Should the government he
able to force companies to turn over
information that will not be used in a
criminal investigation? The feds
could have collected the data them
selves or purchased it from a third
party. Instead, they chose to pressure
Google to use company resources to
create their report — and when
Google said no, they brought down a
subpoena.
