## Jumping Into the Season WELCH SHATTERS THE CARDINAL'S TRIPLE JUMP RECORD Track team uses weekend to record NCAA provisional marks 
### ISRAEL ROJAS 
Senior Solomon Welch knows how to begin a
season.
Welch, a two-time All-American, began his final
season on the Farm by breaking Stanford's 20-
year-old record in the triple jomp during last week
end's track invitational in Seattle. Wash. His jump
of 51-5 1/2 feet topped the old record of 50-2 feet
by over a foot.
Stanford began the weekend-long invitational
with impressive victories for both the men's and
women's distance medley relay (DMR) teams.The
DMR consists of legs of 1,200, 400, 800 and 1,600
meters.
The women's team — sophomore Katy Trotter,
and juniors Janice Davis, Ashley Freeman and Ari
anna Lambie — qualified for NCAAs by posting an
11:06.68. the third-best mark in school history. The
women's B team's time of 11:25.48 also broke the
NCAA provisional qualifying time.
The men's team of junior Joaquin Chapa, and
sophomores Michael Garcia, Wopamo Osaisai and
Russell Brown burned the competition with a
NCAA provisional mark of 9:41.08.
An NCAA provisional mark is one that is used
early in the season to give athletes an idea of how
they should be performing. Depending on how
many athletes are hitting the provisional mark, the
time/distance/height can be increased or decreased
to ensure that only the top athletes are able to com
pete at the national championships.
None of this weekend's events were scored, as
the purpose of the invitational was to qualify ath
letes for NCAAs. Senior Michael Robertson de
scribed the purpose of the event as giving athletes
an opportunity "to start knocking the rust off [their]
spikes."
Welch was not alone as a victor on the men's side,
as sophomore Graeme Hoste also took first place in
the pole vault. In winning the event, Hoste set a new
personal record of 17-0 3/4 feet, which ranks second
in school history and topped the NCAA provision
al qualifying height.
The women had even better luck this weekend,
coming away with victories in four events: the 60
meters. 200 meters,3,(XX) meters and the triple jump.
Davis won the 60 meters in 7.36. Sophomore
Chauntae Bayne (7:37) and junior Jakki Bailey
(7:51) completed the Cardinal trifecta. Both Davis
and Bayne ran NCAA provisional qualifying times.
Freshman Alana Walker made herself noticed
with a victory in the 2(H) meters in 24.53.the sixth
best time in Stanford history.
Sophomore Teresa McWalters captured first in
the 3,000 meters, coming in at 9:09.19 minutes.That
time was fast enough to qualify her for the NCAA
Indoor Championships.
Winning the triple jump and qualifying for the
Indoor Championships was sophomore Erica
McLain. Last season. McLain set the school record
for the triple at the same meet, but this year her
mark of 44-1 1/2 feet was more than a foot shy of
her record 45-7 1/2 feet. McLain also made her col
legiate debut in the 60 meters, finishing in at 7.86
seconds.
