## No matter how dull, the Super Bowl lives on 
### now, you've heard it 
Sports pundits from across the nation have
dubbed this year's NFL Championship extrava
ganza the "Snore Bowl" and "Super Bore." Sup
posedly, the matchup between the Steelers and
the Seahawks lacks any sort of compelling rea
son for viewers to tune in.
Yeah. I'll believe that when Mike Holmgren
stops being the walrus to Matt I lasselbeck's
egghead.
There are plenty of reasons why this Super
Bowl will be entirely watchable and compelling
to the diehard fanatic and the casual viewer
alike.
Forgive me if I'm missing something, but did
n't Shaun Alexander win MVP this year?
Isn't Jerome Bettis a first-ballot Hall-of-
Famer who has yet to win the big game?
Then, of course, come the coaches.
Two years ago, many thought Bill Cowher
would be gone after a 6-10 finish. Mike Holm
gren was stripped of his GM title just this past
off-season.
Both men will have the ultimate chance at
redemption in the "Snore Bowl."
Although a matchup featuring a nonexistent
L.A. team and a New York franchise would
seem more compelling to national media, the
sky isn't falling just because Seattle is facing
Pittsburgh.
Both may be "small-market teams," but the
Steelers are one of the most iconic franchises in
all of sports.
Seattle, on the other hand, can finally escape
from the decades of obscurity they've lan
guished in since their entrance into the league in
1976.
And yet, amidst all of this, the game has al
ready been vilified as completely unworthy of
our attention. It seems that it's all gloom and
doom for the NFL without Peyton Manning or
Tom Brady.
But maybe, just maybe, part of the appeal of
sports in general is that you don't know the out
comes in advance.
So my 49ers versus the Texans in the big one
didn't pay off. I'm a little bit wiser for it now,
that's all.
Realistically, there's no doubt that the game
will continue to rake in the viewers, no matter
who's playing.The Super Bowl is the one televi
sion event that has drawn consistently excellent
ratings, and there's no credible reason why this
year should be any different.
Think about it. If the Tampa Bay Buccaneers
versus the Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl 37
succeeded, so too can the Seahawks against the
Steelers.
Games like this prove that it doesn't matter
who actually plays — Americans tune in any
way.
The degree to which the national sports
media proves itself to be its own worst enemy
will never cease to amaze me.
It's trendy to bash teams, cities and even re
gions for being insignificant. Detroit is too cold.
Pittsburgh is too small, and no one on the East
Coast even knows where Seattle is.
But Super Bowl Sunday will still be a holiday
of nearly religious proportion for millions of
people across the country.
That is, unless the viewers are convinced oth
erwise.
I don't know about you, but when people
who can only benefit from my interest in a
sporting event tell me I shouldn't be interested.
I'm inclined to listen.
Maybe this Super Bowl will be watched by
fewer than many in recent history. But if it is. I'd
be willing to bet that a big reason for
that isn't the product on the field,
but rather how it was sold.
Still, if there's one thing that will
save the Super Bowl, it's the com
mercials.
We all have those friends who an
nually claim not to be watching the
broadcast for the event, but for the
ads. And ladies and gentlemen,
when you've got that going for you,
how can you fail? Those slots literal
ly sell themselves. Literally.
If I'm watching commercials for
the sake of the commercials, then
the advertisers really can't lose, can
they? That is why. ultimately, no
body can kill the Super Bowl.
Okay, so 1 guess Janet Jackson.
Justin Timberlake and the FCC
could. But that was probably a one
time thing.
