# Women suffer first season loss, recover against USC

### ALEXIS ANN PETERSON CONTRIBUTING WRITFIR 
On Friday afternoon, a cloud de
scended on the women's swimming and
diving team, as Stanford suffered a 120-
180 loss to UCLA. The Cardinal re
bounded on Saturday, however, to out
stroke Southern California, 158-142.
"I think we dealt with the loss
against USC very well," said sophomore
Brooke Bishop, who led the No. 3 Car
dinal (13-1,4-1 Pac-10) with victories in
the SO- and 100-meter free and I (K) hack
on both days. "We were a different team
at the pool on Saturday, and it paid off"
First, though, came the loss to
UCLA, Stanford's first of the season.
The Card took only six of the 16 events
in the meet, and of those six. Bishop
won three.
Senior Dana Kirk dominated in
both the KM) fly (53.68) and 200 IM
(2:03.92), and junior Cassidy Krug
earned Stanford's final victory in one
meter diving.
"The loss helped us to switch gears
and remember what Stanford swim

ming is all about: cheering and support
ing your teammates and winning the
close races," Bishop said.
It also reminded the Cardinal to
pause and learn from such defeats.
"Of course it's always hard to lose to
a team that we know we can — and will
— beat later in the season," Costella
said. "But at the same time, this was an
opportunity for us to take a step back
and realize where we can improve and
make changes to better our swimming."
Indeed, a reenergized, newly deter
mined Cardinal showed up on the deck
Saturday.
