# Women suffer first season loss, recover against USC
## 
### ALEXIS ANN PETERSON CONTRIBUTING WRITFIR 
On Friday afternoon, a cloud de
scended on the women's swimming and
diving team, as Stanford suffered a 120-
180 loss to UCLA. The Cardinal re
bounded on Saturday, however, to out
stroke Southern California, 158-142.
"I think we dealt with the loss
against USC very well," said sophomore
Brooke Bishop, who led the No. 3 Car
dinal (13-1,4-1 Pac-10) with victories in
the SO- and 100-meter free and I (K) hack
on both days. "We were a different team
at the pool on Saturday, and it paid off"
First, though, came the loss to
UCLA, Stanford's first of the season.
The Card took only six of the 16 events
in the meet, and of those six. Bishop
won three.
Senior Dana Kirk dominated in
both the KM) fly (53.68) and 200 IM
(2:03.92), and junior Cassidy Krug
earned Stanford's final victory in one
meter diving.
"The loss helped us to switch gears
and remember what Stanford swim

ming is all about: cheering and support
ing your teammates and winning the
close races," Bishop said.
It also reminded the Cardinal to
pause and learn from such defeats.
"Of course it's always hard to lose to
a team that we know we can — and will
— beat later in the season," Costella
said. "But at the same time, this was an
opportunity for us to take a step back
and realize where we can improve and
make changes to better our swimming."
Indeed, a reenergized, newly deter
mined Cardinal showed up on the deck
Saturday.

After an upset loss to the Bruins, the Cardinal traveled across Los Angeles to defeat
the Lady Trojans.
However, the Card had to sweat
it out against No. 11 USC (3-4, 1-3),
as the meet was close until Stanford
swept five events in a row.
Senior Dana Kirk kicked off the
Cardinal hot streak, making her vic
tory in the 200 fly look easy. Her time
of 1:58.87 beat second-place finisher
Cait Connealy of USC by over four
seconds.
After that, Stanford could not be
stopped.
Bishop triumphed next in the 50
free (22.99), followed immediately
by Krug's win in one-meter diving.

Bishop then earned Stanford's
fourth consecutive victory by racing
to first in the 100 free with a time of
49.98.
Senior Kristen Caverly rounded
out the run with her victory in the
200 back (1:59.93).
Junior Lauren Costella was also a
key in the dual-meet triumph. Her
upset over 2005 Pac-10 champion
and 2004 Olympian Kaylan Keller in
the 1,650 free swung momentum in
Stanford's favor. Costella's time
(16:23.14) was also her best this sea
son.
Costella attributed the victory
over USC to an adjustment in out
look.
"Losing to UCLA also helped us
to approach this meet with a better
attitude," Costella said. "We had

more fun. We were relaxed, confi
dent and ready to race."
While the victory over Southern
California pulled Stanford one step
closer to its goal of a conference
championship, the swimmers were
more concerned with simply re
bounding after the UCLA loss.
"(Head coach] Lea [Maurer] got
a few desserts called Death by
Chocolate at dinner for us to share,
and told everyone that this will
never happen again," Kirk said."The
next day against USC, we came back
with a passion and with something to
prove. Then we proved it."
The Cardinal hope to continue
their rebound on Feb. 11 against Cal
ifornia at the Avery Aquatic Center.
