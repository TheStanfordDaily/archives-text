# UC-Davis takes down Stanford
## 
### DENIS GRIFFIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Heading into Friday's dual meet against Pac-10 rival
UC-Davis, Stanford wrestling appeared confident. Sure,
basketball and football had fallen short against the Aggies,

but the wrestling
squad had won two
straight, as victories
over CSU-Bakers
field and CSU-
Fullerton had wiped
away the disap
pointment of a 39-0
loss to Illinois.
Despite their re
cent success, howev-

er, the Cardinal fell easily against UC-Davis, going down
by a 38-6 margin.
"I credit it mostly to momentum," coach Kerry McCoy
said. "Our guys were maybe a little bit down because of the
circumstances going into the match, where we're not able
to get that spark that we've had the last few weeks."
Indeed, the Stanford loss was rather one-sided. The
only points for the Cardinal (5-4,2-1) came off of a Davis
forfeit to redshirt freshman Luke Feist at 174 pounds.
To be fair, though, many of the wrestlers who had
played a large role in Stanford's prior success did not par-

ticipate against the Aggies (4-6,2-2).
Senior captain Ray Blake at 165
pounds, sophomore captain Tanner
Gardner at 125 pounds and sopho
more Josh Zupancic at 149 pounds,
all team standouts, were missing in
the loss.
"Tanner and Ray had little minor
injuries," McCoy said. "If need he,
they would have wrestled. But again,
it's just a dual meet, not the NCAA
tournament, so we decided to err on
the side of caution and let them take
some time to recover. And Josh was
sick, so we had those unfortunate
things happen. We don't have much
depth at some of our weight classes,
and when some of those guys go
down you have no other options."
By forfeiting two of those match
es. the Cardinal essentially opened
the match in a 12-point hole.
"We knew that down 12. we had a
lot to come back from," McCoy said.
"I think maybe the guys thought
about it a little too much. We went
out there thinking we had to pick it
up and do all this extra stuff instead
of just going out and wrestling."
Stanford has little time to con
template the loss. The team gears up
to host three Pac-1() rivals this week
end.
"You've got to put the past be
hind you," McCoy said. "We have
three tough matches this weekend,
and we're four weeks out from the
Pac-10 [Championships], And that's
the focus of our season â€” doing well
in the Pac-10 and moving on to Na
tionals. So we just have to put it be
hind us and be ready to move for
ward."
Perhaps this loss wouldn't seem
so serious if it didn't fit the pattern of
Stanford's up-and-down season thus
far. The team had been enjoying a
similar rebound when it faced the
lllini, only to come away with an eeri
ly similar result.
"1 think it was very similar,"
McCoy said. "And Ill go back to mo
mentum and say the first match set

the tone. From there, little close calls
here and there made the difference.
McCoy, however, does see one
key difference between the two per
formances.
"Our guys wrestled better against
Davis than they did against Illinois,"
McCoy said. "We just didn't get the

wins.
At the very least, Stanford can
take comfort in the fact that there is
still time before the crucial Pac-10
Tournament in late February. And, in
the wake of total collapses against
the lllini and Aggies, it appears to be
time the Cardinal will need.

"In the grand scheme of things,
it's always difficult to come away
with one of those," McCoy said of the
tough loss. "But it is just one match,
one competition. And we'll be better
for it at the end if we can respond to
it. It's better for this to happen now
than for it to happen in the first

round of the Pac-10."
This weekend. Stanford hosts
conference rivals Oregon. Oregon
State and Portland State in Burnham
Pavilion. The first two matches are
scheduled for Friday at 2 p.m. and 7
p.m., respectively. Ilie Portland State
tilt takes place Saturday at noon.

Sophomore Josh Zupancic helped Stanford defeat CSU-Fullerton, 26-1, on Jan. 23 with his 6-3 decision. The 149-pound Zupancic was missing from the Car
dinal's match against the Aggies this past weekend. He was out sick and it appeared that his squad sorely missed him.
