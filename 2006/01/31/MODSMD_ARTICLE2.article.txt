### CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON 
Undergraduate and graduate students will receive discounted admission
to Stanford football games in 2006, according to a stadium seating plan un
veiled Monday by Athletic Department officials. Additional highlights in
clude the creation of premium seating sections that require Buck/Cardinal
Club donations, a series of community meetings to market ticket packages
and a Family Fun Section in the upper bowl to complement a family seating
package.
Through the efforts of an unnamed donor, both undergraduate and gradu
ate students will have access to free football tickets. Athletics spokesperson
Marie Vasquez told' Hie Stanford Daily that students who pay a registration fee
of about $11 will receive a red shirt and free admission to all 2006 home games.
The Department anticipates the steep drop in cost will encourage football
game attendance in Stanford's combined student body, which numbers more
than 15,000.


JAMES CHAN/The Stanford Daily
Interim Athletic Director Bill Walsh and Special Assistant to the Athletic Director on Stadium Management Chris Hutchins announced a new priority seating pro
gram yesterday. New plans also cater to students; for a small registration fee, students will be able to attend all home football games free of additional cost.
The general-admission student
section will run from the 50-yard line
to the corner of the south end zone,
expanding the current student sec
tion on the eastern side of the stadi
um. How the registration fee will fac
tor into the price of the All AXF
cess Pass has not yet been finalized.
Season ticket prices for non-stu
dents range from $180 in end zone
sections to $275 between the 45-
yard lines. Faculty, staff and alumni
will be able to purchase seats be
tween the 30- and 45-yard lines at a
15 percent discount. Faculty will sit
directly above students, between the
left 30- and 45-yard lines in the
upper bowl.
Current season ticket holders will
be assigned seats according to the
new Priority Seating Program, de
signed "to achieve an equitable dis
tribution of seats" between recent
and long-time supporters, according
to Stadium Management Assistant

Chris Hutchins.
Seven factors will give general
season ticket holders preference in
seating. In order, these factors are:
donations to the Buck/Cardinal
Champions Fund; how long an at
tendee has held football season tick
ets; the number of season tickets
held for other Cardinal sports; total
donations to both athletics and the
University at large; and commitment
to consecutive donations, and alumni
status.
ITie Champions Fund is a new
arm of the Buck/Cardinal Club,
which assists with athletic scholar
ships and program support. A yearly
donation of at least $1 .(XX) or $2,(XX)
to the Champions Fund earns the
donor the right to purchase a seat be
tween the 45-yard lines. Benefits as
sociated with premium-seating plans
include parking accommodations,
express lines at concessions and ac
cess to a hospitality concourse in the
press box.
Hutchins and Interim Athletic
Director Bill Walsh emphasized that
mandatory-donation tickets com
prise less than five percent of the
new stadium's 50,000 seats, and

Walsh numbered the most expensive
seats at just 889. All other seats
would not require a donation.
Citing recent Athletic Depart
ment deficits of around $3 million.
Walsh was blunt about the fundrais
ing perks of premium seating. How
ever, he also stated that the revenues
from the premium sections would
help keep ticket prices low in the rest
of the stadium, in keeping with his
stated goal of "access for anyone and
everyone."
Families can purchase four sea
son tickets — for two adults and two
children under age 12 — for $160.
Walsh played up the importance of
the total Stanford experience, hy
pothesizing that a family might "take
their kids to the soccer game, have
lunch at the stadium and then see
our (football] game."
Hie Athletic Department hopes
to create interest among locals
through a series of informational
meetings, held over the next month
from Sacramento to Monterey. De
partment officials plan to describe
the seating plan and answer ques
tions from interested fans. The first
of those meetings occur today at

kissick Auditorium in the Arrillaga
Family Sports Center at 7 a.m. and 6
p.m.
Walsh said the Department's goal
is to have a game-day attendance of
50,000 in the privately-funded $90
million stadium, with up to 10,000
additional bleacher seats available
for high-demand events such as Big
Game.
Walsh likened the intimacy of the
facility to Navy-Marine Corps
Memorial Stadium at the U.S. Naval
Academy — where Stanford played
on Sept. 10. 2005 — and lauded the
proximity of the stands to the field, a
feature that has drawn comparisons
to Autzen Stadium at Oregon.
Drawing laughs. Walsh added that
"the restroom facilities are outstand
ing." He also alluded to the wild fin
ish of Sunday's basketball game
against Washington, saying it was a
goal to make the game-day experi
ence on par with the raucous atmos
phere of Maples Pavilion.
Prices for individual game tickets
are not yet set. Hutchins said that a
price schedule for individual tickets
will be released in July, after the sea
son ticket packages are allocated.

to Stanford football games in 2006, according to a stadium seating plan un
veiled Monday by Athletic Department officials. Additional highlights in
clude the creation of premium seating sections that require Buck/Cardinal
Club donations, a series of community meetings to market ticket packages
and a Family Fun Section in the upper bowl to complement a family seating
package.
Through the efforts of an unnamed donor, both undergraduate and gradu
ate students will have access to free football tickets. Athletics spokesperson
Marie Vasquez told' Hie Stanford Daily that students who pay a registration fee
of about $11 will receive a red shirt and free admission to all 2006 home games.
The Department anticipates the steep drop in cost will encourage football
game attendance in Stanford's combined student body, which numbers more
than 15,000.


JAMES CHAN/The Stanford Daily
Interim Athletic Director Bill Walsh and Special Assistant to the Athletic Director on Stadium Management Chris Hutchins announced a new priority seating pro
gram yesterday. New plans also cater to students; for a small registration fee, students will be able to attend all home football games free of additional cost.
The general-admission student
section will run from the 50-yard line
to the corner of the south end zone,
expanding the current student sec
tion on the eastern side of the stadi
um. How the registration fee will fac
tor into the price of the All AXF
cess Pass has not yet been finalized.
Season ticket prices for non-stu
dents range from $180 in end zone
sections to $275 between the 45-
yard lines. Faculty, staff and alumni
will be able to purchase seats be
tween the 30- and 45-yard lines at a
15 percent discount. Faculty will sit
directly above students, between the
left 30- and 45-yard lines in the
upper bowl.
Current season ticket holders will
be assigned seats according to the
new Priority Seating Program, de
signed "to achieve an equitable dis
tribution of seats" between recent
and long-time supporters, according
to Stadium Management Assistant

Chris Hutchins.
Seven factors will give general
season ticket holders preference in
seating. In order, these factors are:
donations to the Buck/Cardinal
Champions Fund; how long an at
tendee has held football season tick
ets; the number of season tickets
held for other Cardinal sports; total
donations to both athletics and the
University at large; and commitment
to consecutive donations, and alumni
status.
ITie Champions Fund is a new
arm of the Buck/Cardinal Club,
which assists with athletic scholar
ships and program support. A yearly
donation of at least $1 .(XX) or $2,(XX)
to the Champions Fund earns the
donor the right to purchase a seat be
tween the 45-yard lines. Benefits as
sociated with premium-seating plans
include parking accommodations,
express lines at concessions and ac
cess to a hospitality concourse in the
press box.
Hutchins and Interim Athletic
Director Bill Walsh emphasized that
mandatory-donation tickets com
prise less than five percent of the
new stadium's 50,000 seats, and

Walsh numbered the most expensive
seats at just 889. All other seats
would not require a donation.
Citing recent Athletic Depart
ment deficits of around $3 million.
Walsh was blunt about the fundrais
ing perks of premium seating. How
ever, he also stated that the revenues
from the premium sections would
help keep ticket prices low in the rest
of the stadium, in keeping with his
stated goal of "access for anyone and
everyone."
Families can purchase four sea
son tickets — for two adults and two
children under age 12 — for $160.
Walsh played up the importance of
the total Stanford experience, hy
pothesizing that a family might "take
their kids to the soccer game, have
lunch at the stadium and then see
our (football] game."
Hie Athletic Department hopes
to create interest among locals
through a series of informational
meetings, held over the next month
from Sacramento to Monterey. De
partment officials plan to describe
the seating plan and answer ques
tions from interested fans. The first
of those meetings occur today at

kissick Auditorium in the Arrillaga
Family Sports Center at 7 a.m. and 6
p.m.
Walsh said the Department's goal
is to have a game-day attendance of
50,000 in the privately-funded $90
million stadium, with up to 10,000
additional bleacher seats available
for high-demand events such as Big
Game.
Walsh likened the intimacy of the
facility to Navy-Marine Corps
Memorial Stadium at the U.S. Naval
Academy — where Stanford played
on Sept. 10. 2005 — and lauded the
proximity of the stands to the field, a
feature that has drawn comparisons
to Autzen Stadium at Oregon.
Drawing laughs. Walsh added that
"the restroom facilities are outstand
ing." He also alluded to the wild fin
ish of Sunday's basketball game
against Washington, saying it was a
goal to make the game-day experi
ence on par with the raucous atmos
phere of Maples Pavilion.
Prices for individual game tickets
are not yet set. Hutchins said that a
price schedule for individual tickets
will be released in July, after the sea
son ticket packages are allocated.
