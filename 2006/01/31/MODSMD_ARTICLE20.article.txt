## BRIEFS SPORTS

Immediately following Stan
ford's heart-stopping upset over
No. 10 Washington on Sunday, the
spotlight shone brightest on senior
guard Chris Hernandez. Yester
day, however, the headline-grab
ber was senior center Matt
Haryasz, who was named Pac-10
Player of the Week for the second
week in a row.
Haryasz has been instrumental
in keeping the Cardinal afloat this
season, and has come on especially
strong as of late. In the 76-67 over

time win against Washington,
Haryasz notched a team-high 24
points and 10 rebounds.
Just three days earlier. Haryasz
tallied 22 points on 9-of-13 shoot
ing and grabbed nine rebounds
against a Washington State scoring

defense that entered the weekend
leading the Pac-10.
All told. Haryasz notched 46
points and 19 rebounds in two wins
against the Washington schools for
Stanford (10-7.6-3).
Haryasz' latest heroics came off
a similarly impressive weekend in
Arizona. In a weekend split, the
Page, Ariz, native scored 52 total
points against Arizona and Arizona
State. All told. Sunday marked the
fifth-straight game Haryasz
cracked the 20-point milestone.
