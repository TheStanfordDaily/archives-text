## Course Guide to undergo renovation 
### CHRISTOPHER LIN STAFF WRITER 
Shopping classes can he tough when three of your op
tions all occur during lunch, which also happens to he the
time slot for your weekly meetings of the Society for Prop
agating Proper Facebook Etiquette and the Stanford
Competitive Tiddlywinks Team. It was for situations like
these that Stanford's online Course Guide was invented.
The trouble, as freshman Daniel Sheehan put it. is that
"Course Guide just doesn't offer students very much.
There isn't enough information and what they do have isn't
very helpful. 1 know most students don't use it; lots haven't
even heard of it."
Sheehan is just one of numerous Stanford undergradu
ates disappointed in the quality of Stanford's online
Course Guide. Many students forgo use of the Web site al
together because of its inconsistency, inaccuracy and irrel
evancy. But the guide is set to receive a face-lift at the end
of winter quarter, when the Registrar's office plans to roll
out a more reliable system.The new Course Guide will be
designed by CollegeNET. the same company that built
Stanford's online scheduling system.
"The old Course Guide was incredibly inaccurate," said
sophomore Kai Lukoff. an ASSU senator who is collabo
rating with the Registrar's office on the new site. "When 1
first got here, I tried to access the guide for the courses I was
taking, and I found two random comments that were about
10 years old. The new Course Guide will greatly increase
the ability of students to get accurate information about
classes."
According to Lukoff, the new Course Guide system will
replace the usual mid-quarter paper evaluation forms with
an online form for submitting answers to the same ques
tions. The system will be integrated with the Stanford net
work to make sure that only students who have actually
taken the classes can submit comments. Students will be
able to submit comments during the last two weeks of each
quarter; comment submissions will close before students
receive their grades in order to. as Lukoff put it, "prevent
jadedness."
In addition to providing student comments, the new
system will, for the first time, also allow students to view
quantitative analysis of how students rated various as
pects of the course and qualities of the professors. Al
though all paper evaluations collect statistical informa
tion about how students rank professors' teaching and
course organization, this information is not currently dis
played on Course Guide.
Despite the new features, some students expressed con
cern that Course Guide would still fail to collect useful in
formation.
Citing the slowdown of the Coursework site this past
fall quarter, freshman David Chiang said, "Putting things
online might only make things worse, unless the campus
expands its server capabilities. Also, an online system with
voluntary comment submissions wouldn't work. Half of
my Chem 31a class couldn't log on to the class Web site to
do the course evaluations. Some just simply forgot."
Lukoff said he plans to answer these worries about the
new system's ability to provide comprehensive informa
tion with an aggressive campus-wide publicity campaign.
"The critical factor is student participation," he said.
"When evaluation time rolls around. I intend to do some
thing of a publicity blitz with e-fliers, ads in the Daily, and
emails to RA's and as many mailing lists as possible. We
hope to get the most response from the freshmen, since
they're the ones who will be using this guide for the next
four years."
