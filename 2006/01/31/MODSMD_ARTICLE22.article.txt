# SUPREME COURT UPDATE
## Alito confirmation likely despite opposition 
### JEREMY JACOBS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Though they concede Judge Samuel Alito's
conformation is inevitable, key Senate Democ
rats entered last week's confirmation debates
hoping to use the national stage to highlight
President George W. Bush's warrantless domes
tic spying program, which they call unconstitu
tional.
Following the Judiciary Committee's 10-8
vote along partisan lines to recommend Alito's
confirmation, the Senate debates began last
Wednesday along a predictable course. Democ
rats have highlighted Alito's judicial opinions in
which he exhibited an expansive view of execu
tive powers, arguing that he will fail to adequate
ly check presidential actions that infringe upon
citizens' civil liberties.
Sen. Herb Kohl (D-Wis.) expressed these con
cerns in his remarks on the Senate floor.
"I fear that Justice Alito will narrow our rights,
limit our freedoms and overturn decades of
progress," Kohl said.
His Wisconsin counterpart. Sen. Russell Fein
gold, also a Democrat, noted that Alito's opinions
are relevant today amid the current NSA wire
tapping scandal. Feingold said Bush "thinks his ex
ecutive power permits him to violate explicit crim
inal statutes by spying on Americans without a
court order."
In response to these comments. Bush held an
impromptu press conference last Thursday, hoping
to defend the domestic spying program by uphold
ing its legality.

"There's no doubt in my mind it is legal,"
Bush said.
In response to a question insinuating that Bush
was attempting to sidestep the 1978 Foreign Intel
ligence Surveillance Act — which requires court
warrants for wiretaps — Bush adamantly defend
ed his actions.
"Wait a minute," he said. " That's a — there's
something — it's like saying, you know. 'You're
breaking the law.' I'm not."
Bush also argued that the surveillance act "was
written in 1978" and that "it's a different world"
that the United States faces today.
Republican senators have praised Alito over
the course of the debates and scolded Democrats
for making the nomination a partisan contest. Sen.
Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) berated his opposition,
angered by the lack of bipartisan support. He
claimed that Republicans had kept a far more
open mind in the nomination proceedings of Jus
tices Ruth Bader Ginsberg and Stephen Breyer
during the Clinton administration.
"What'schanged?"Graham asked."lt's not the
quality of the nominees, it's the quality of the
process."
Confident that Alito will be confirmed. Re
publicans welcomed him to Capitol Hill last
Wednesday for what was essentially a victory lap.
Republican senators and Bush congratulated
Alito on his performance in the Judiciary Com
mittee hearings and his seemingly imminent con
firmation.
Graham and fellow Republicans also contend
that Democrats are seeking to use the nomination
as a launching pad for the 2(M)8 presidential elec

tion. In particular, Republicans responded nega
tively to a call Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) made
last Thursday to Democratic Senate leadership
from the World Economic Forum in Davos.
Switzerland. During the call. Kerry emphasized
the need for a filibuster, the only way Democrats
can block Alito's confirmation.
Steve Schmidt, a senior White House aide
working on Alito's confirmation, touched upon
these issues in recent remarks on Kerry's call.
Schmidt said that Kerry's last-minute call "says
a lot less about Alito than it does about the lowa
primary in 2(X)8," insinuating that Kerry — the
2(M)4 Democratic presidential candidate — is at
tempting to solidify a liberal base in order to re
gain the party's nomination.
Despite Republican claims, Kerry's efforts
have delayed the Senate vote. Speaking on the
floor last Friday, Kerry focused on the importance
of the vote, claiming that it could not be rushed.
"This is not the vote of Monday afternoon," he
said,"this is a vote of history."
Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.). who originally
hoped to end the debates last Friday, supported
Kerry's remarks, stating that he would not vote to
end the Senate debates on Monday. Last Friday,
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) also reversed her
position from last week, stating she would support
a filibuster. Reid was quick to point out. however,
that Democrats do not have the votes to sustain
this strategy.
Yesterday. Reid's prediction came true, as both
Democrats and Republicans voted 72-25 to end
Senate debates. A more balanced vote to confirm
Alito is expected today.
