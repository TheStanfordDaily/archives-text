## Tennis alum sentenced to prison Former tennis star Roscoe Tanner arrested for violating probation 
### CLAY BAVINGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Former Stanford tennis star Roscoe Tanner was re
cently sentenced to two years in prison for violating
probation after a grand theft conviction.
Tanner, Class of 1973, was "the single most impor
tant player to the resurrection of the program," said
current men's tennis coach Dick Gould, who instructed
Tanner while he was at Stanford.
Gould said he remembered that the 1960s were
marked by USC and UCLA's domination of collegiate
tennis.
Stanford was always good during this period, he
said, but was never able to compete with these two
schools.Tanner was the first player to "believe we could
beat them and have the skills and talent to do it,"he
said. Apart from his ability, Gould said Tanner "was ex
tremely popular among the players, and always dis
played a great attitude."
Tanner won the national doubles championship
once, though he never won the singles title despite two
finals appearances.
Even today, a large picture of him is displayed in the
tennis team room.
"We definitely still talk about Tanner because he

is one of the greatest players to come out of Stan
ford," said current team member Eric McKean, a
junior.
After graduating with a degree in political science.
Tanner embarked on an impressive professional ca
reer. His dominating serve, heralded as the fastest of
the day, helped him to win 18 titles, including one major
â€” the 1977 Australian Open.
Since retiring from professional tennis, however.
Tanner has encountered legal trouble. Over the past
few years, he has spent time in prison in Germany,
Florida and New Jersey, mostly due to his failure to
make child support payments.
He was most recently convicted of grand theft, after
writing a bad check for $35,595 to purchase a 32-foot
boat. When the check bounced, authorities chased him
through the states and into Germany, where they
caught and convicted him.The judge sentenced Tanner
to a 10-year probationary period in which to pay off his
debt.
After his conviction, Tanner said he was turning his
life around, and that he "regained [his] faith and felt a
million percent better." He wrote a tell-all autobiogra
phy, "Double Fault: My Rise and Fall, and My Road
Back," which chronicles his run-ins with the law and his
supposed redemption.
However, Tanner was arrested several months ago
in Tennessee for failing to keep up his probation pay
ments. Earlier this month, he was sentenced to two
years in prison by a court in Pinellas County, Fl.
