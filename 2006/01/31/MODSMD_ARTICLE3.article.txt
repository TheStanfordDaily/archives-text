While unforeseen construction delays may postpone the opening of
the renovated Stanford Stadium by one week, Stanford officials an
nounced in a Monday morning press conference that they "expected" to
complete the construction on target.
Should construction not be completed in time for Sept. home-open
er against San Jose State, that contest would take place in San Jose. That
would force the Cardinal to move into their new home one week later in
their bout with Navy.
Senior Associate Athletic Director for Facilities Ray Purpur said the
San Jose option is more of a contingency plan.
"We aren't willing to conceive playing our first home game at San Jose
State," he said. "We expect to play at Stanford."
No decision will be finalized until
mid-summer, when the Athletic De
partment hopes to have a firmer
grasp on the stadium's timeframe.
Despite the precautionary an
nouncement. construction currently
appears on schedule.
"Nothing indicates a cause of
concern for me," said Dave Schinski,
Assistant Athletic Director for Cap
ital Planning."! have full confidence
we will open in time. There are so
many fronts, so if one gets delayed,
we can just work on something else."

Crews have worked two eight
hour shifts from 6:30 a.m. to 11 p.m..
Monday through Saturday since late
November. Purpur added that John
Arrillaga, the largest donor to the
project — and Forbes' magazine's
346 th richest man in the world —
has visited the site daily to oversee
construction.
Schinski said excessive rain dur
ing winter break did not severely im
pact construction, as crews built a
trench and pipes to drain out water.
Construction crews are currently
moving dirt and working on spatial
arrangement, making the site resem
ble a large dirt bowl. Pillars and walls
are also being installed throughout
the future lower concourse.
Natural grass will most likely be

used on the field, though negotiations
still remain. Purpur mentioned that
relatively flexible county water re
strictions and maintenance costs were
the primary motive for preferring nat
ural turf over artificial field. The field
is scheduled to be installed in July.
The lower bowl will be composed
of 30,(KX) seats, compared to the
upper bowl's 2().(XX). Seats along the
sidelines will include armrests while
end zone seating will have one con
tinuous back for each row.
Additional plans include building
a new scoreboard on the stadium's
north end and moving the stadium
lights about 40 feet closer to the
field. The new press box will lie atop
the upper-level concourse and will
feature leather seating. The upper

howl and press box construction is
slated to begin in February.
Stadium parking locations will not
be affected by construction, though
ticket holders under the new priority
seating program will receive pre
ferred parking.
'ITie Athletic Department plans to
engage the third phase of the stadi
um's website tomorrow, allowing
surfers to virtually see their future
scats at stanfordstadium.com.
"This is going to be an incredible
stadium." Interim Athletic Director
Bill Walsh said. "This project is so
unique to intercollegiate sports. We
are proud that this stadium is being
built with private funding without
debt or university funds. Everything
will be the very best."
