While unforeseen construction delays may postpone the opening of
the renovated Stanford Stadium by one week, Stanford officials an
nounced in a Monday morning press conference that they "expected" to
complete the construction on target.
Should construction not be completed in time for Sept. home-open
er against San Jose State, that contest would take place in San Jose. That
would force the Cardinal to move into their new home one week later in
their bout with Navy.
Senior Associate Athletic Director for Facilities Ray Purpur said the
San Jose option is more of a contingency plan.
"We aren't willing to conceive playing our first home game at San Jose
State," he said. "We expect to play at Stanford."
