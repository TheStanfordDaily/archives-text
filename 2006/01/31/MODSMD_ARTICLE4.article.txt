# STUDENT EVENTS
## Career week kicks off with lib arts fair 
### KATHERINE COX STAFF WRITER 
A crowd of student job-seekers, some in business attire, converged at
the Ttesidder Union's Oak Room at noon yesterday for the Liberal Arts
Career and Internship Fair — the first event of the Annual Stanford Ca
reer Week, a six-day informational sequence sponsored by the Stanford
Career Development Center (CDC). The series culminates with Satur
day's Career Conference, co-sponsored by the CDC and the Stanford
Alumni Association with support from the Dean of Students Office.
Recruiting representatives from more than 40 firms were seated
around the conference room at designated stations until the event closed
at 4 p.m.The employers offered interested students literature about their
companies and answered questions about starting positions and the na
ture of the work.
Marlene Stern, a career counselor with the CDC. said yesterday's
event was on par with past fairs.
"The turnout is pretty standard for an
indoor event like this," she said.
According to Stern, the Career De
velopment Center maintains contacts
with a large pool of employers, many of
whom return on a yearly basis.
"We have a huge database of employ
ers who expressed interest in recruiting
Stanford students in the past," she said.
rhe CDC is not proactive about se
curing certain firms for the fair — in
stead, companies usually respond to in
formation about upcoming events on the
Center's Web site and arrange their par
ticipation.
Though it was titled the Liberal Arts
Career and Internship Fair, the confer
ence hosted companies from a range of
industries seeking undergraduates from
all majors. Among those present were
Alesco Global Advisors, a San Mateo in
vestment advisor in real estate securities;
Gap Inc.; Grassroots Campaigns, an or
ganization that specializes in supporting
progressive candidates or movements
and U.S. Army Health Care.
Stern opined that she found a correla
tion between one's major and eventual
career to be unusual and often unpre
dictable.
"My take on it is that your degree is
about learning, and what you actually
major in does not have much bearing on
what kind of job you get," she said. "It is
a myth that you have to major in X to get
a career in X, Y or Z. What is important
is learning about work in general and ac
quiring skills through involvement in
leadership, clubs, student groups, intern
ships or research."
Some of the employers said they were
unconcerned about the prospective em
ployee's area of expertise. Eric Carlson,
dean of the boarding program at Portola
Valley's Woodside Priory School spoke
to students about a unique opportunity
to teach one of a variety of topics at the
school.
"We're an independent school, so
we're able to hire people who do not
have teaching credentials. We are look
ing for college graduates who have a de
gree in any number of subjects," he said.
Carlson said he had received only a
few resumes but had held some valuable
conversations with students who had
shown a genuine interest in teaching.
Junior Dinakar Muthiah, an electrical
engineering major who had visited a
number of booths, said he thought the
employers seemed flexible.
"I've found that you can do pretty
much whatever you want in terms of a
major," he said.
Muthiah was looking for a summer
internship and was intrigued by the
Teach for American program.
"It looks interesting," he said,"and it
seems like a non-evil thing to do."
However, many of the consulting
firms present outlined stricter require
ments for job candidates.
Melissa Gerber of Nera Economic
Consulting,said."We are looking for up
perclassmen primarily for summer in
ternships. Also, though we do recruit at

liberal arts colleges, a background in eco
nomics, math or finance is somewhat re
quired."
Gerber also said Nera was mostly tar
geting graduating seniors looking for
jobs "on the full-time end." She and her
associate did not expect to select stu
dents for positions or accept applications
while on campus, although they provided
interested students with the necessary
contact information.

"This visit is probably more for main
taining relations with the Stanford stu
dents," Gerber explained.
Senior Mamei Sun said she was disap
pointed by the strong presence of con
sulting firms.
"I came here looking for something
interesting to do this summer and it was
a little disappointing because there are a
lot of consulting firms which don't neces
sarily encapsulate the most interesting

kind of work ," she said.
Another attendee, freshman Julia
Greenberg, wanted to line up a market
ing internship for the summer. She said
the career fair was different than she had
anticipated.
"ITiere is only one company here in
marketing," she said. "The other didn't
show. And unfortunately, most of the
companies are recruiting upperclass
men."
