## Flashmob organized around Claw Inexplicable gathering of several students connected to bicycle safety 
### DENISE SOHN 
At 12:20 p.m. precisely yesterday afternoon, stu
dents gathered at pre-determined locations to partici
pate in Stanford's first ever Flashmob, "an inexplica
ble gathering of a group of people in a place for a short
period of time," according to the event's Web site.
Despite this explanation, few knew what to expect.
The instructions, widely distributed through e-mail and
posted online, were vague and left much unexplained.
Students were to come to a certain location according
to their zodiac signs to receive further instructions —
students born under Aquarius, Leo, Scorpio, Cancer,
Gemini or Taurus were to meet at the 'IYeehouse wear

ing a hat. Meanwhile, students born under Aries. Pisces.
Libra, Sagittarius, Virgo, or Capricorn were to meet at
the red fountain in front of Green Library wearing sun
glasses.
Undeterred by the cryptic orders, a sizeable crowd
gathered at both locations by 12:20 p.m., mostly out of

curiosity. One fountain attendee, sophomore Melissa
Kunz, said thai she did not know what to expect, but
came because it "sounded like a fun thing to do to add
some variation to my day."

Students ride around the Claw fountain "counter-clockwise as slow as physically possible," following the directions
of Stanford's first-ever Flashmob. Organizers said they hoped the mysterious event promoted bike safely.
Soon enough, a Flashmob repre
sentative appeared and handed out
instructions, which read as follows:
"1. Make sure you're wearing your
sunglasses. 2. Bike to the White
Plaza fountain (opposite the Book
store). 3. At 12:25 P.M.. ride counter
clockwise around the fountain as
slow as physically possible. 4. When
you hear an air horn, stop immedi
ately, get out your cell phone, and
call a friend. Say "stay on the right,"
pay them a compliment and hang
up. 5. Immediately disperse in dif
ferent directions. 6. Carry on with
your lives as per normal. 7. Return
to the website http://www.geod
ties.com/stanfordflashmob/ for your
final step."
At White Plaza five minutes
later, despite the moderate rainfall,
approximately 30 students began
to circle the fountain. Several by
standers in front of the Bookstore
stopped to watch the sluggish bike
riders curiously. When the air horn
sounded, the students stopped and
got on their cell phones to com
plete their directions before dis
persing.
Though Flashmob was over, it
was still not clear what had really
happened, or what the purpose had
been. Three Flashmob representa
tives, who asked to remain anony

mous, were willing to provide fur
ther details.
"We noticed that a lot of bike ac
cidents happened because people
weren't paying attention to where
they were going, like they would if
they were driving a car," said one of
the students.
"Also, a lot of head-on collisions
happen when people can't decide
whether to go left or right," another
said, adding that he hoped the event
would clear up this sort of indecision.
When asked why they chose to
announce the event with such secre
cy, one representative explained that
they just "wanted there to be more
mystery to it. rhis way. more people
would turn up to find out where to
go. Also, this way, it was funnier for
the people who were randomly
around to witness it."
Another representative added
that Flashmobs have occurred be
fore in other parts of the world —
they are "usually random gatherings
of large numbers of people who turn
up and do something for 5 minutes."
He explained he had previously par
ticipated in one in the United King
dom.
While trying to promote bike
safety, the group thought Flashmob
would be an interesting and distinc
tive way to accomplish their goals.
"This way, hopefully the people
will remember better than if we had
just held up signs or something," one
of the organizers remarked.
And the mysterious final step?
