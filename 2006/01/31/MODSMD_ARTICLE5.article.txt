## Flashmob organized around Claw Inexplicable gathering of several students connected to bicycle safety 
### DENISE SOHN 
At 12:20 p.m. precisely yesterday afternoon, stu
dents gathered at pre-determined locations to partici
pate in Stanford's first ever Flashmob, "an inexplica
ble gathering of a group of people in a place for a short
period of time," according to the event's Web site.
Despite this explanation, few knew what to expect.
The instructions, widely distributed through e-mail and
posted online, were vague and left much unexplained.
Students were to come to a certain location according
to their zodiac signs to receive further instructions â€”
students born under Aquarius, Leo, Scorpio, Cancer,
Gemini or Taurus were to meet at the 'IYeehouse wear

ing a hat. Meanwhile, students born under Aries. Pisces.
Libra, Sagittarius, Virgo, or Capricorn were to meet at
the red fountain in front of Green Library wearing sun
glasses.
Undeterred by the cryptic orders, a sizeable crowd
gathered at both locations by 12:20 p.m., mostly out of

curiosity. One fountain attendee, sophomore Melissa
Kunz, said thai she did not know what to expect, but
came because it "sounded like a fun thing to do to add
some variation to my day."

Students ride around the Claw fountain "counter-clockwise as slow as physically possible," following the directions
of Stanford's first-ever Flashmob. Organizers said they hoped the mysterious event promoted bike safely.
