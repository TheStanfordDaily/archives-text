## Design school project teaches bike safety 
### ADA YEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Passing through White Plaza last Thursday, stu
dents may have noticed a terrible bike accident or
some unfortunate fellow moaning that he shouldn't
have been wearing earphones. Returning from class,
some may have wondered who left the flier to get
those bike tires filled.
Or. perhaps, some saw that impromptu round
about at Stanford's affectionately named Intersec
tion of Death and thought,"Hey, good idea."
These ideas were the product of team efforts by
students in ML 377,"Experiences in Innovation and
Design Thinking.'"l"he course is the first to be offered
by the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford,
or d.school for short.
Launched just last year, the d.school draws gradu-
ate students from a variety of depart
ments across campus, including the
Graduate School of Business, com
puter science, mechanical engineer
ing and education. By gathering dif
ferent disciplines together, the pro
gram aims to teach collaborative in
novation — a special skill the
school's leaders dub design thinking.
"Design thinking is a different
way of thinking," said Alex Kazaks, a
member of the course's teaching
team. "There are all different kinds
of intelligences, and one of these is
creative intelligence. Design think
ing is an analog for that. This is not
something usually taught in a univer
sity setting, and we're trying to make
it available to students."
Also listed as ME 206 A and OIT
333, ME 377 is the flagship of the fair
ly new d.school, which will not confer
regular departmental degrees of its
own. Introductory in nature, the class
focuses primarily on teamwork.
"This is a class for students inter
ested in leading teams and leading
innovation within teams," said teach
ing team member Perry Klebahn.
In an effort to reach beyond theo
ry, the class is built entirely around
team projects. ME 377 students have
24-hour access to their own class
room workspace — a comfortable
looking space with couches, work
benches, whiteboards across every
wall and pink carnations in the plas
tic cups that hold markers.
"In the GSB, we look at case stud
ies and analyze and talk," said GSB
Prof. Bob Sutton, a founding mem
ber of the d.school. "The whole
d.school is based on doing stuff in in
terdisciplinary teams."
The bike safety projects that

swept campus the past week were
the second of these learning-by
doing assignments.
"We had to spend eight hours
making changes that are meant to in
crease bike safety on campus, and we
had to actually do something, not
just plan it," said second-year GSB
student Max Pulido London — one
of the group that staged the White
Plaza bike accident.
An additional constraint re
quired team members to work with
in 20 feet of one another.
"It was kind of like the d.school
version of [reality show] 'The Ap
prentice,'" said first-year electrical
engineering graduate student Joel
Darnauer.
As the mock accident's victim,
Darnauer lay on the ground covered
in fake blood as his teammates hand
ed out fliers with bike safety tips.The
long yellow fliers, which were made
by the campus police, featured a 10
percent-off coupon for a helmet.
Pulido. Darnauer and four other
teammates decided on their project
after collecting information on bike
safety, a process that included inter
viewing bike shop salespeople, stu
dents and the campus deputy.
" There are about 50 reported ac
cidents annually and many more
that go unreported — several per
day according the bike shop folks,"
Darnauer said. "According to the
campus deputies, the main problems
are: bikers not paying attention to
stop signs at busy intersections, rid
ing without a light at night and riding
while distracted by a cellphone or an
iPod."
"In general, we found that there is
an awareness on campus of the dan
gers of not wearing helmets," Pulido
said, "Yet people tend to feel that it
cannot happen to them, but to some
one else."
Projects, which students present
ed yesterday afternoon, ranged from

awareness campaigns to directing
actual bike traffic. All groups collect
ed preliminary data, which included
findings on undergraduate attitudes
towards bike safety. One such group
reported that undergraduate stu
dents regarded helmet-wearing as
"socially uncool."
Many students said they were
surprised that their week-long exer
cise in teamwork garnered real and
positive reactions.
"We handed out about 200 fliers,"
Darnauer said. "Most people were
interested in what we had to say. A
few visiting high school students
stopped to take pictures."
The group that built the tempo
rary roundabout, complete with po
lice assistance and artwork, present
ed videos of cyclists using the round
about to make safe turns. One
woman even gave them a thumbs
up.
Another group completed bike
inspections on parked bikes, leaving
pamphlets for students with flat tires
or broken brakes. This group report
ed seeing students pause to examine
their bikes, and no students threw
the notices away.
A third group organized a "virus"
game, and distributed a phone num
ber for students to report their
biggest complaints about biking on
campus. The group received 21 calls.
ME 377 students deemed the
projects a good experience, allowing
them to meet their peers in other dis
ciplines and work in a more hands
on setting. They realized as well that
the course's design was a collabora
tive project itself.
"The content of this class will
drive a lot of the content for the
spring quarter," Klebahn said.
"It's been a little chaotic," said
first-year mechanical engineering
student Michael Ho, another mem
ber of the bike safety team. "But it's
exciting to be a part of this."
