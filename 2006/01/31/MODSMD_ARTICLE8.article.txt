# Grad Life
## What to expect when you're expecting.....from the University 
### Jenny Allen STAFF WRITER 
For some female graduate stu
dents, it appears that one moth
er's day gift has arrived early
this year with the addition of
the University's first-ever
comprehensive childbirth

policy, to be administered by the Office
of the Dean of Research.

Female graduate and professional
students who are pregnant or have re
cently given birth are eligible for (1) an

"academic accommodation period" of
up to two quarters before and after
birth, during which a student can post
pone course work, exams and other ac
ademic requirements; (2) full-time en
rollment during the academic accom
modation period as well as access to
Stanford facilities. Cardinal Care
healthcare and University housing; (3)
an automatic one-quarter extension of
requirements, including Ph.D. qualify
ing exams; and (4) six weeks of paid
leave for students receiving stipends
and salaries from teaching, research and
work as communitv associates.

What do those affected think
about the new policy ?

In general, female graduate students seem
appreciative of the new childbirth policy,
which they view as a great first step, and noted
some improvements that should be made in the
near future.

"As a member of the Graduate Student Council

Diversity Committee (GSC-DC). 1 think this new pol-

icy is a big win for the graduate community," says Href-

na Marin Gunnarsdottir. a sixth-year electrical engineer-

ing doctoral student and mother of a two-year-old. "It
makes Stanford more attractive for women who are consider-

ing childbirth and will hopefully also make female grad student

childbirth a little more acceptable to the eyes of the Stanford com-

munity. I know from my own department that graduate women with

children are very few. which is a shame since these are indeed our prime
childbearing years."
Gunnarsdottir identifies several changes she would like to see made in
the current policy â€” an extension of paid maternity leave to at least the
California norm of 12 weeks, additional provisions for new fathers and
possibly a childcare subsidy for graduate students.
GSC-DC member Tracy Terry, a fifth-year chemistry doctoral student,
is concerned that the new policy does not make child rearing practical for
women studying laboratory sciences.
"I don't know anyone who has gotten a baby on a regular sleep sched
ule in six weeks, much less feels comfortable leaving the baby behind while
returning to work after so short an amount of time,"Terry said. "And what
are we supposed to do with the baby after six weeks? Is it supposed to take
care of itself while you go back to lab? Is the father going to stay home and
take care of the baby? Are we going to find affordable childcare near cam- |
pus? No. None of the above."
Terry said she thinks the new policy will not change the fact that it is ex
tremely challenging for women to have a baby and work in a laboratory
at the same time.
"Even puppies have to be nine weeks old before you are allowed to ,
take them away from their mother, but we are expected to drop our six
week-old babies off at daycare miles away from our work,"Terry contin- j
ues."This is not the way I imagined equality."

And what do others think?
Professor of Geological and Environmental Sciences Gail Mahood,
associate dean of Graduate Policy, who developed the new policy with
feedback from administrators, faculty, students and staff, says she believes
that it will have a major impact on those women who become pregnant
and give birth while they are still in graduate school.
"It is important because it provides for continuity of funding and Uni
versity services while also serving as a sort of template for having what
some woman students have described to me as very difficult discussions
with not-so-sympathetic advisers about how to accommodate the coming
birth of a child," Mahood says. "Even for those women who don't plan on
becoming pregnant while in grad school, I think the policy sends a reassur

ing

message

that Stanford

welcomes women stu

dents, that we take their concerns

seriously and that pursuing an advanced degree and

having a family need not be antithetical."

Chemistry Department Chair Richard Zare, who implemented a 12-
week maternity leave policy within the Stanford Chemistry Department
starting last fall, said he is pleased that Stanford University is leading the
way in recognizing the needs of female graduate students.
"The details of the policy are probably less important than the fact that
we have a policy in place,"Zare savs. "The existence of a childbirth accom
modation policy should help to remove the awkwardness of addressing
the situation of being an expectant mother with someone's thesis advisor.
To me, that is the most important gain."
Vice Provost and Dean of Research and Graduate Policy Arthur lii
enenstock says he believes that the new policy will help female graduate
students maintain continuity in their studies.
"This new policy is important for women,"Bienenstock says."lt is also
important for the nation as we will need their contributions."
Geological and Environmental Sciences Prof. Adina Paytan said she
thinks the new policy promotes retaining women in academia, which will
have a positive influence on both male and female graduate students as
well as faculty.
"The new policy shows that Stanford understands that a female grad
uate student can successfully be a mom and productive professional." Pay
tan says. "[The policy] will certainly make it easier for women, who arc se
riously considering parenthood but were discouraged by the less than sup
portive environment and the impact this decision might have on their ca
reer, to go ahead with their plans."
Paytan is particularly impressed that the policy strongly advocates
communication between advisers and the students who are expecting.
" What we really need is a change in culture where everyone realizes and
accepts the diversity of life choices and needs of different people," Paytan
continues. "This policy will unfortunately not change some attitudes, but I

believe it is a fine first step
toward change in the culture. It

will, at a minimum, empower a few
women who want to start a family and

have encountered unsupportive reactions from
advisers to do so."

Stanford's three deans at the Graduate Life Office (GLO) con
sider the new childbirth policy a well-thought out and welcome addition
that will greatly benefit graduate students and all departments on campus.
"While balancing graduate work and taking care of family can still be
a challenge, this policy offers tangible support and accommodations," says
GLO Assistant Dean Ken Hsu. "It reflects an important institutional
value in families, in that family and graduate work need not be competing
choices, but are both priorities in life. I think it will be an important mes
sage and practice in the retention and recruitment of women to Stanford's
graduate programs."
GLO Assistant Dean Andy I lernandez says she believes it will also be
important in the future to evaluate University support for male graduate
students whose academic progress is impacted when their spouses or part
ners give birth.
In addition, GLO Director and Associate Dean of Student Affairs
Chris Griffith said she believes that "for women graduate students and
their faculty advisers, there will now be a starting point for the conversa
tion about how to accommodate childbirth."
University of Oregon Chemistry Prof. Geraldine Richmond, chair of
the Committee on the Advancement of Women Chemists, has spent two
decades encouraging academic departments to develop childbirth poli
cies similar to those at Stanford so that young female scientists can ad
vance their careers and personal family goals simultaneously.
"Given how very few institutions have such policies, Stanford's new
childbirth policy sets a good example of how small institutional changes
can send a powerful message to women graduate students that they are
welcome in our academic institutions and that a balanced life is a produc
tive life." Richmond says."l anticipate that many other institutions around
the country will follow."
