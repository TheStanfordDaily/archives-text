# Grad GO Pass program gets a second chance in 2006
## 
### MIMA MOHAMMED DESK EDITOR 
GO Passes, which subsidizes Cal
train rides for graduate students who
live off campus, for 2006 are now
available for purchase at Parking
and Transportation Services at a sub
sidized cost of $60 for off-campus
graduate students.
However, the future of the pro
gram depends on the outcome of the
upcoming spring elections. The 2005
pilot project used non-general fund
ing provided by the University ad
ministration. It established coordi
nation with the Graduate Student
Council (GSC) and was intended to

provide an opportunity for graduate
students to experience the program,
and for students to establish future
funding opportunities to continue
the passes.
Although the 2005 program con
cluded with no funds earmarked for
its continuation in 2006, the graduate
student body has been given a final
opportunity to establish funding for
the program.
"The GSC Parking and Trans
portation Committee worked with
Provost John Etchemendy and Di
rector of Parking and Transportation
Brodie Hamilton to secure funding
for the 2006 GO Pass pilot program
for off-campus graduate students,"

says GSC Co-chair Tom Lee, a
fourth-year electrical engineering
student. "The 2006 program is being
funded by a combination of funds
from the Provost's Office, Graduate
Student Council and fees paid by stu
dent pass holders. In order to sustain
the program for 2007 and beyond,
and as a condition for continuing the
pilot program for 2(X)6, the GSC
agreed to place funding for the stu
dent GO Pass program on the ballot
for the 2006 spring quarter election."
Graduate students will be given
the chance to vote for ongoing fund
ing for GO Passes in April. Many
benefits of the GO Pass include the
potential savings for commuters be

cause of the costlier monthly and an
nual Caltrain passes. Also the GO
Pass eliminates the need for a Stan
ford parking permit. The pass essen
tially pays for itself in approximately
five to six round-trip Caltrain tickets
to San Francisco, or eight-round trip
tickets to San Jose.
"The GSC Parking and Trans
portation Committee is currently
working on a formal proposal to put
on the ballot this spring," Lee ex
plains. "In addition to continuing the
GO Pass for off-campus graduate
students, we are looking to expand
the program to give transportation
options to on-campus students as
well. Since any fee will be levied on

the entire population, we want to
make sure that all students will bene
fit, and that the program balances the
different needs of on and off-campus
students. Our goal is for the program
to give all graduate students im
proved connectivity between campus
and the surrounding area."
Those living off campus can get
their 2006 GO Pass today by bring
ing their Stanford IDs to Parking
and Transportation Services (340
Bonair Siding, open 7:30 a.m. to
5p.m., Monday through Friday).
Continuation of the program for
2007 and beyond will depend on the
results of the election.
Graduate students must live off

Stanford property to be eligible for
the program. Stanford West and Oak
Creek Apartments are considered
part of the campus. Those eligible for
the GO Passes include University
faculty and staff, because of their
large numbers.
"The parking and transportation
committee is seeking student input
for the fee proposal," Lee says. "In
particular, on-campus students are
encouraged to express what they
would like to see in a CallYain pro
gram for 2(X)7. Comments can be
sent to GSC Parking and Transporta
tion Committee Chair Hannah
Scherer. 1 ler email address is avail
able on the GSC Web site."
