## Editorial We need to be more earthquake safe 
### 
Last week, the Faculty Senate heard a
report on the state of the University's
emergency preparedness. One hun
dred years after the 1906 San Francisco
Earthquake, Associate Vice Provost of En
vironmental Health and Safety Larry
Gibbs reported on the concrete steps taken
to curb the consequences of a large-scale
natural disaster.
We are heartened that the University has
taken measures to prepare itself in case of an
emergency. In particular, we commend the
Department of Environmental Health and
Safety for taking a proactive stance on this
issue, renovating most of the buildings on
campus, and bringing every building up to
much higher standards in the last 10 years.
During the two previous disasters in 1906
and 1989, the campus suffered major dam
age to many buildings, forcing several to
close for extended periods. The damage that
resulted cost the University millions of dol
lars to repair; extensive restoration efforts
were made possible only through the dona
tions of generous alumni.
After the 1994 Northridge earthquake
that devastated several Southern California
universities, Stanford administrators real
ized that they needed to step up seismic
retrofitting in preparing for the next earth
quake. The next 10 years saw a flurry of re

pairs and seismic upgrades, and now just
about every inhabited building on campus
could withstand a sizable tremor.
But while there have been many infra
structural changes, there is a general lack of
awareness among the student body when it
comes to earthquake preparedness. Stu
dents caught in Memorial Church during an
earthquake might be alarmed by the fact
that the church was severely damaged dur
ing the past two. Should they dive under the
pews or run out to the Quad? Similarly,
falling palm trees and fast-moving traffic
could create extraordinary hazards for stu
dents strolling down Palm Drive in the midst
of a natural disaster.
Most importantly, while dorms may be
structurally sound, most students don't have
much of an idea what to do if caught at their
desks or in bed when the Big One hits. In the
orientation packets students receive an
emergency whistle and some basic guide
lines, but these are easily missed in the initial
flood of information.
The lack of earthquake drills means that
students are less likely to respond to an
emergency situation in a calm manner. In
particular, out-of-state and international
students may be especially unfamiliar with
