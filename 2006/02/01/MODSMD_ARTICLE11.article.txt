# Stanford: the future is bright
## 
### 
I've written many columns critical of
Stanford over the last half-year on topics
including Stanford stereotypes, dating,
professors and administrative policies. One
of these columns, "Stanford Undergrads:
Not Active Learners?," (Nov. 9, 2005) was
controversial enough that 1 had professors
and grad students scold me while under
grads told me they pinned it to their door
like Martin Luther's 95 Theses. Regardless
of what I've said in the past, I am, in fact, a
huge fan of this school. So as my farewell
column, 1 will read from the crystal ball and
tell you where Stanford's been and where
it's going in a 1,000 words or less. Fasten
your seatbelt.
Let's start with the facts. As a world-class
research institution. Stanford is distin
guished more for its well-rounded nature
than any single aspect. According to U.S.
News rankings. Stanford contends with the
Ivy League in the liberal arts with a top-5
program and has the number two engineer
ing program. It ranks in the top 3 in almost
all the math and science disciplines, as well
as business and law schools. Beyond aca
demics, Stanford can claim the happiest stu
dents (Princeton Review) and an athletics
program that would have been seventh in
medal count at the 1996 Olympics were it a
country and that has won the Sears Cup for
the top NCAA program every year since its
inception.
Not bad. But Stanford's peers have at
least some combination of these attributes;
what sets Stanford apart is its momentum.
That's right, Stanford is like Britney Spears
emerging from high school, or Tiger Woods
from college. In spite of being the youngest
university among the top 20 listed in U.S.
News and World Report (on average by

more than 120 years for those in the top 10),
Stanford boasts the third largest endow
ment, behind only that of Harvard and Yale,
and has outpaced Ivy greats such as Cornell
and Dartmouth more than three-fold. In re
cent years alumni giving has been in a class
with only two members as Stanford and
Harvard now trade blows for number one.
To the Ivy League, we're the funny-looking
guy in a flower-print T and sandals who ap
peared out of nowhere to collect an unseem
ly number of Rhodes Scholarships, Nobel
Prizes and Olympic gold medals.
The Past:
So, how did it happen? Founders Leland
and Jane Stanford contemplated the princi
ples on which their university would be
founded after speaking with various universi
ty presidents. Mr. Stanford — builder of the
first transcontinental railroad, governor of
California, and fabled businessman — be
lieved in the development of "cultured and
useful" citizens through an education both
liberal and practical in nature:"! attach great
importance to general literature for the en
largement of the mind and for giving business
capacity. 1 think 1 have noticed that technical
ly educated boys do not make the most suc
cessful businessmen....A man will never con-

struct anything he cannot conceive."
Mr. Stanford charged the Univer
sity with the mission of providing a
world-class liberal arts and sciences
education complemented by strong
engineering and research programs.
This philosophy differed from those
of Eastern universities established
before the signing of the Declaration
of Independence, which were more
indicative of the enlightenment peri
od in their emphasis on the liberal
arts and quest to educate "thinkers."
Stanford, in a way, became the first
great American university by merg
ing the classical model of the enlight
enment with America's most hal
lowed touchstone: innovation.
Although New York newspapers
predicted that Stanford professors
would "lecture in marble halls to
empty benches," students came in
unexpected numbers. Within a cen
tury's time, Stanford had spawned
the greatest technology business
center in the world: Silicon Valley.
The Future:
University President John Hen
nessy remarked in November of
2(X)3. "At Stanford, buildings speak
powerfully to our sense of place and
our history...This fall, two dedications
reminded us of how our vision of the
future is inextricably tied to our past."
The Hewlett Packard building and
the Clark Center (Bio-X), to which
Hennessy's dedication refers, typify a
new and great interdisciplinary mis
sion for the University, one that

echoes Stanford's founding paradigm
of uniting disciplines in application.
Both Hennessy and Provost John
Etchemendy came to their positions
in 2(XX) with a "reputation for broad
interdisciplinary understanding," and
the Clark Center, uniting biology and
engineering, is just one part.
This vision for the 21st-century is
not limited to technical or scientific
applications. When Bob Joss, dean of
the business school, spoke to my
class, he said that one of the GSB's
greatest challenges in coming years
will be to integrate itself with the
University for the purpose of pro
moting cross-disciplinary education.
This quarter I'm taking one such
course under this directive, Neuro
surgery 279 — Concepts in Drug-
Device Combinations, with students
from the business, law, medical, and
engineering schools.
Indeed, University planners are
rebuilding Stanford around the no
tion of cross-functional centers. For
instance, in November of 2(X)5, the In
ternational Initiative announced a
multi-million dollar plan to further
connect different fields relating to in
ternational affairs. In 2(XW, the Stan
ford Institute for the Environment
(SIE) was announced as an interdisci
plinary center that will act as a hub for
environmental research on campus.
The theme of more cross-discipli
nary education and research is not
unique to Stanford. It's everywhere,
in business, medicine, government
and other universities. The good
news is that Stanford is extraordinar
ily well positioned for this transfor
mation compared to its peers and
competitors.
Yale's business, science, and engi
neering programs are weak to non

existent. Princeton, though boasting
a fantastic undergraduate program,
has only a small graduate program,
and for that reason is not a major re
search institution. The remainder of
the Ivy League lacks scale and is gen
erally weak in engineering and the
sciences. Conversely, MIT and Cal
Tech have little beyond their engi
neers and scientists. The only other
university with similar strength
across programs, and thus the ability
to build strong cross-functional cen
ters in various fields, is Harvard. In
the next century we will see Stanford
and Harvard and other wide-bodied
universities like Duke and Berkeley,
run away from peers in their ability
to attract talent and funding. It's an
inevitability that was set in motion
150-years ago by the industrial revo
lution — knowledge is power, or
better yet. the application of knowl
edge is power.
Etchemendy remarked upon his
appointment in 2(KX). "I think we're
very, very close to being the best uni
versity in the entire world." Well, you
know where my loyalties lie; I'd say
we're beyond close. Stanford has
spectacular momentum entering the
next century, especially in the sci
ences and technology which will
prove increasingly relevant in solving
the world's most vexing problems.
And it doesn't hurt that as Asia's in
exorable rise continues, Stanford will
be the only great U.S. university situ
ated on the Pacific Rim. For fellow
"Lost" fans out there, you might say,
"All roads lead here." Oh, and the
weather's good, too.

Sad or glad this is my last column of
the year? E-mail me at brown_clay
ton@gsh.stanford.edu to tell me why.
