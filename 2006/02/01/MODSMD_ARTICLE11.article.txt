# Stanford: the future is bright

### 
I've written many columns critical of
Stanford over the last half-year on topics
including Stanford stereotypes, dating,
professors and administrative policies. One
of these columns, "Stanford Undergrads:
Not Active Learners?," (Nov. 9, 2005) was
controversial enough that 1 had professors
and grad students scold me while under
grads told me they pinned it to their door
like Martin Luther's 95 Theses. Regardless
of what I've said in the past, I am, in fact, a
huge fan of this school. So as my farewell
column, 1 will read from the crystal ball and
tell you where Stanford's been and where
it's going in a 1,000 words or less. Fasten
your seatbelt.
Let's start with the facts. As a world-class
research institution. Stanford is distin
guished more for its well-rounded nature
than any single aspect. According to U.S.
News rankings. Stanford contends with the
Ivy League in the liberal arts with a top-5
program and has the number two engineer
ing program. It ranks in the top 3 in almost
all the math and science disciplines, as well
as business and law schools. Beyond aca
demics, Stanford can claim the happiest stu
dents (Princeton Review) and an athletics
program that would have been seventh in
medal count at the 1996 Olympics were it a
country and that has won the Sears Cup for
the top NCAA program every year since its
inception.
Not bad. But Stanford's peers have at
least some combination of these attributes;
what sets Stanford apart is its momentum.
That's right, Stanford is like Britney Spears
emerging from high school, or Tiger Woods
from college. In spite of being the youngest
university among the top 20 listed in U.S.
News and World Report (on average by

more than 120 years for those in the top 10),
Stanford boasts the third largest endow
ment, behind only that of Harvard and Yale,
and has outpaced Ivy greats such as Cornell
and Dartmouth more than three-fold. In re
cent years alumni giving has been in a class
with only two members as Stanford and
Harvard now trade blows for number one.
To the Ivy League, we're the funny-looking
guy in a flower-print T and sandals who ap
peared out of nowhere to collect an unseem
ly number of Rhodes Scholarships, Nobel
Prizes and Olympic gold medals.
The Past:
So, how did it happen? Founders Leland
and Jane Stanford contemplated the princi
ples on which their university would be
founded after speaking with various universi
ty presidents. Mr. Stanford — builder of the
first transcontinental railroad, governor of
California, and fabled businessman — be
lieved in the development of "cultured and
useful" citizens through an education both
liberal and practical in nature:"! attach great
importance to general literature for the en
largement of the mind and for giving business
capacity. 1 think 1 have noticed that technical
ly educated boys do not make the most suc
cessful businessmen....A man will never con-
