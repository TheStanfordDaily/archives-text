## Correction

Can you imagine what it must have
been like to attend Stanford before
the advent of the Internet? In my
mind I envision some sort of cave-person
world where people were forced to grunt to
one another directly, sometimes even face
to-face like barbarians. Before email, people
actually had to write things down on pieces
of paper and pay a postage fee to have them
sent. People couldn't shop, date or even read
the news online. And with all those real
world problems, how did anyone get any
procrastinating done?
There are many Stanford-related Web
sites that I visit multiple times a day, includ
ing Axess, Coursework and GoStanford.com
(I'm not an athlete, but I have a crush on the
majority of the basketball team, and I'm
slowly starting to feel like they feel the same
way). But let's be honest, the majority of my
time on the computer is spent on Facebook
or Myspace or some other complete waste of
time.
All of you die-hard procrastinators are
right there with me; I see you logged in at
non-residential locations, your online status
is usually active, and the away message that
you've posted is only to keep others from
distracting you during your procrastination
routine (which also involves the reading of
said away messages). None of us are better
than one another — and we can smell our
own — so stop pretending like I'm not talk
ing about YOU. As far as I can tell, we're
everywhere, even if we're invisible offline.

Now. it might surprise you to know that
my single-person Escondido Village studio
apartment is not the social center of the Uni
versity. However, thanks to the power of the
Internet, I'm able to communicate with peo
ple from all corners of campus, many of
whom I've never met before. But in an effort
to connect people, sometimes things don't
connect at all.
For example, this past fall quarter was a
difficult one forme. It's not a sob story — I'm
happy to be here and quite content with my
life as a graduate student, but that's not to say
that I haven't gotten lonely from time to time.
A few things have happened to me, though,
that make me think there's a much bigger dis
connect going on that I once thought.
For starters, I came to the understanding
that I was ready to try to start some sort of
relationship. I don't have tons of free time,
but I was willing to make an effort to be
more emotionally invested in social activi
ties at Stanford, and I haven't exactly en-

Yesterday's editorial, "University
should do more to conserve ener
gy," understated the amount the
University spends each year on
water and electricity. The Universi
ty spent $56 million last fiscal year,
not $4 million.
In yesterday's article, "Design
School project teaches bike safety,"
The Daily incorrectly stated that
Bob Sutton was a professor at the
Graduate School of Business. He is
actually a professor of Management
Science and Engineering. The arti
cle also failed to mention that the
Design Institute, or d.school, is a
unit of the School of Engineering.
In Tuesday's Daily, the article "De
sign school project teaches bike
safety" incorrectly labeled Robert
Sutton as faculty from the Graduate
School of Business. Professor Sut
ton, and the d.school itself, are from
the department of Management Sci
ence and Engineering.

joyed attending almost all of them
alone (at least not as much as if I had
a dude there with me). Unfortunate
ly, this step was quite devastating
when I realized that the biggest
commitment I've ever made was, in
fact, to Leland Stanford Junior
(University) when I decided to com
mit to five years in a Ph.D. program.
Talk about a long-term-relationship.
How could anyone compete with
that?
Secondly, I decided that my Ph.D.
program was not exactly the type of
emotional commitment I was look
ing for, so I began to survey the field
for eligible bachelors who also like
eligible bachelors. As I opened my
eyes, I noticed that in many cases eli
gibility was irrelevant: there are just a
lot of other lonely people around me.
Some are even women, too (al
though, I do notice them a little less).
I felt bad. I could see the loneliness in
their eyes, they could see it in mine,
but we couldn't help each other out.
Compatibility is a bitch sometimes.
I guess what bothers me most
about these misaligned dating or
friending experiences is that people
can't be reduced to profiles. I'm talk
ing less about privacy and risk issues
and more about the ways that we
join groups, update photos and play
silly little games to be "virtually"
popular or attractive. Part of the ap
peal of these Web sites is that you
can be anyone you want, even if that
person isn't really you. So although
the sites appear to connect us, they
also distract us from who's really be
hind the profile.
Fortunately, I finally got a call out

of the blue from a guy that I had gone
on a couple of dates with last year be
fore he was called to duty in Eastern
Europe. (He's in the military.) He's
back in California now and wanted
to have dinner. Eventually, that led to
other things, and I'm glad to say that
the forecast for Valentines Day is
looking good this year.
But the difference with this guy —
as opposed to the few eligible ones
that I've met here — is that not only
does he not go to Stanford, but he also
spends almost no time on the Inter
net. In fact, one of the things that I ad
mire most about him is the fact that
we connected offline and off campus.
In my opinion, these sites are
great places to waste time, but in the
end, they can really be just a waste
of time. Remember those days
when people had to talk on the
phone — which was attached by a
cord to a wall — in order to speak
to one another? Those were the
days. And since when did these so
cial network Web sites basically be
come personal ads? Sometimes a
guy just wants friends, nothing
more.
Like anybody, I appreciate the at
tention I get on these sites, and
sometimes they really do help me
feel less lonely in the world. But real
conversations, real connections and
real life are a whole lot more satisfy
ing than the shallow ways that I pass
my time. I'm not saying that I'll be
disconnecting my Internet connec
tion anytime soon, but it has been
nice removing the "virtual" from my
reality lately.

you probably already knew that. He's
currently logged-in from a non-resi

that too.

eligible bachelors. As I opened my
eyes, I noticed that in many cases eli
gibility was irrelevant: there are just a
lot of other lonely people around me.
Some are even women, too (al
though, I do notice them a little less).
I felt bad. I could see the loneliness in
their eyes, they could see it in mine,
but we couldn't help each other out.
Compatibility is a bitch sometimes.
I guess what bothers me most
about these misaligned dating or
friending experiences is that people
can't be reduced to profiles. I'm talk
ing less about privacy and risk issues
and more about the ways that we
join groups, update photos and play
silly little games to be "virtually"
popular or attractive. Part of the ap
peal of these Web sites is that you
can be anyone you want, even if that
person isn't really you. So although
the sites appear to connect us, they
also distract us from who's really be
hind the profile.
Fortunately, I finally got a call out

of the blue from a guy that I had gone
on a couple of dates with last year be
fore he was called to duty in Eastern
Europe. (He's in the military.) He's
back in California now and wanted
to have dinner. Eventually, that led to
other things, and I'm glad to say that
the forecast for Valentines Day is
looking good this year.
But the difference with this guy —
as opposed to the few eligible ones
that I've met here — is that not only
does he not go to Stanford, but he also
spends almost no time on the Inter
net. In fact, one of the things that I ad
mire most about him is the fact that
we connected offline and off campus.
In my opinion, these sites are
great places to waste time, but in the
end, they can really be just a waste
of time. Remember those days
when people had to talk on the
phone — which was attached by a
cord to a wall — in order to speak
to one another? Those were the
days. And since when did these so
cial network Web sites basically be
come personal ads? Sometimes a
guy just wants friends, nothing
more.
Like anybody, I appreciate the at
tention I get on these sites, and
sometimes they really do help me
feel less lonely in the world. But real
conversations, real connections and
real life are a whole lot more satisfy
ing than the shallow ways that I pass
my time. I'm not saying that I'll be
disconnecting my Internet connec
tion anytime soon, but it has been
nice removing the "virtual" from my
reality lately.

You can contact Adam at bad

you probably already knew that. He's
currently logged-in from a non-resi

that too.
Can you imagine what it must have
been like to attend Stanford before
the advent of the Internet? In my
mind I envision some sort of cave-person
world where people were forced to grunt to
one another directly, sometimes even face
to-face like barbarians. Before email, people
actually had to write things down on pieces
of paper and pay a postage fee to have them
sent. People couldn't shop, date or even read
the news online. And with all those real
world problems, how did anyone get any
procrastinating done?
There are many Stanford-related Web
sites that I visit multiple times a day, includ
ing Axess, Coursework and GoStanford.com
(I'm not an athlete, but I have a crush on the
majority of the basketball team, and I'm
slowly starting to feel like they feel the same
way). But let's be honest, the majority of my
time on the computer is spent on Facebook
or Myspace or some other complete waste of
time.
All of you die-hard procrastinators are
right there with me; I see you logged in at
non-residential locations, your online status
is usually active, and the away message that
you've posted is only to keep others from
distracting you during your procrastination
routine (which also involves the reading of
said away messages). None of us are better
than one another — and we can smell our
own — so stop pretending like I'm not talk
ing about YOU. As far as I can tell, we're
everywhere, even if we're invisible offline.

Now. it might surprise you to know that
my single-person Escondido Village studio
apartment is not the social center of the Uni
versity. However, thanks to the power of the
Internet, I'm able to communicate with peo
ple from all corners of campus, many of
whom I've never met before. But in an effort
to connect people, sometimes things don't
connect at all.
For example, this past fall quarter was a
difficult one forme. It's not a sob story — I'm
happy to be here and quite content with my
life as a graduate student, but that's not to say
that I haven't gotten lonely from time to time.
A few things have happened to me, though,
that make me think there's a much bigger dis
connect going on that I once thought.
For starters, I came to the understanding
that I was ready to try to start some sort of
relationship. I don't have tons of free time,
but I was willing to make an effort to be
more emotionally invested in social activi
ties at Stanford, and I haven't exactly en-
