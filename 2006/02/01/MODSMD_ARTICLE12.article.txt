Can you imagine what it must have
been like to attend Stanford before
the advent of the Internet? In my
mind I envision some sort of cave-person
world where people were forced to grunt to
one another directly, sometimes even face
to-face like barbarians. Before email, people
actually had to write things down on pieces
of paper and pay a postage fee to have them
sent. People couldn't shop, date or even read
the news online. And with all those real
world problems, how did anyone get any
procrastinating done?
There are many Stanford-related Web
sites that I visit multiple times a day, includ
ing Axess, Coursework and GoStanford.com
(I'm not an athlete, but I have a crush on the
majority of the basketball team, and I'm
slowly starting to feel like they feel the same
way). But let's be honest, the majority of my
time on the computer is spent on Facebook
or Myspace or some other complete waste of
time.
All of you die-hard procrastinators are
right there with me; I see you logged in at
non-residential locations, your online status
is usually active, and the away message that
you've posted is only to keep others from
distracting you during your procrastination
routine (which also involves the reading of
said away messages). None of us are better
than one another — and we can smell our
own — so stop pretending like I'm not talk
ing about YOU. As far as I can tell, we're
everywhere, even if we're invisible offline.

Now. it might surprise you to know that
my single-person Escondido Village studio
apartment is not the social center of the Uni
versity. However, thanks to the power of the
Internet, I'm able to communicate with peo
ple from all corners of campus, many of
whom I've never met before. But in an effort
to connect people, sometimes things don't
connect at all.
For example, this past fall quarter was a
difficult one forme. It's not a sob story — I'm
happy to be here and quite content with my
life as a graduate student, but that's not to say
that I haven't gotten lonely from time to time.
A few things have happened to me, though,
that make me think there's a much bigger dis
connect going on that I once thought.
For starters, I came to the understanding
that I was ready to try to start some sort of
relationship. I don't have tons of free time,
but I was willing to make an effort to be
more emotionally invested in social activi
ties at Stanford, and I haven't exactly en-
