Every now and again I miss life on cam
pus. Then I recall that life on campus is
a heady mix of dreadful dullness,
punctuated by moments of excruciating
boredom.
That being said, there are occasions when
life in Rains seems genuinely appealing (un
like life in Escondido Village, which is just un
pleasant). Take, for example, last Thursday.
What happened last Hiursday? Well. The
750 got a pool table.
Now, 1 know that at first glance that does
n't appear to be much. There are, after all.
pool tables elsewhere. Many of them, in fact.
You would be entirely justified in thinking
that one has to lead a pretty tragic life to be
excited by the velvety caress of soft felt, the
rigid hardness of a solid cue and the silken
smoothness of well polished balls.
However, the point is not the pool table, it's
The 750. Or rather the potential of The 750.
I've done some shilling for the place already
(though I should make it clear that I'm no Arm
strong Williams). but that was over the summer,
so I thought we should revisit the issue.
Despite the fact our very own bar has been
open for a while, it appears that it's not quite
doing the roaring trade one might expect.
Why?
Well, if one were naive (by naive. 1 mean
undergraduate), one might think that it's be
cause the graduate student population is a lit
tle, well. limp.
However, we know we don't just flop
around doing mundane, everyday tasks. I've
seen you people sack work to go party and
get horribly drunk — my adviser should
note, though, that obviously I've never done

that, and it really did take me a week to find
that minus sign.
If not dysfunction, then what prevents the
crowds from flocking? I've spent enough
time in the bars of Palo Alto (yes, there is
more than one) to know that there's no con
glomeration of grad students there. No, it's
not better options that keep us away.
I suspect that, in reality, the problem is
somewhat subtler in origin. You see, 1 don't
think we understand the point of a student bar.
Such places don't exist on the same plane
as the sort of debonair drinking dens you
might find yourself daydreaming about when
stuck in the dusty corner of your department
library. It's not a place to dress up for, or a
place to bump and grind with potential mates.
Rather than a Nola's or an F& A's, the per
fect student bar should be a Cheers. It should
be somewhere where everyone (or at least
several people) knows your name.
There's an occasional tendency to believe
that going out should always be Going Out. I
suspect it comes from the fact that life as a
graduate student can be so bereft of anything
resembling social activity that when free time
presents itself we want to make the most of it.
The problem with this idea, thoughts that
options for Going Out tend to be somewhat

limited if one doesn't spend at least a little
time going out.
There's surprisingly little in the way of
broader community, the kind of community
where you know people you haven't seen
across a lab bench, at Stanford, especially
amongst the graduate students. We stick in
our little groups and cliques, rarely venturing
beyond to see what else is out there.
Of course, venturing out is hard; as charm
ingly awful as they are, the GSC parties aren't
really conducive to anything other than gen
tle sobbing at the state of your life, and that
never made anyone new friends.
In fact, most opportunities to meet people
outside your department carry the same un
pleasant sense of being forced. They're all
that sort of uncomfortable social mixer that
leaves an unpleasant stench of desperation
on everyone, despite the best intentions of
the organizers and guests.
Which brings us back to The 750. And its
pool table. You see, this place of ours carries
none of that uncomfortable baggage. It's
somewhere to hang out, to grab a drink before
turning in for the evening or to pick up a late
night snack before heading back to the lab.
I know that there are better bars to pick
up boys. There are better bars to dance the
night away and better bars to order the per
fect martini. But maybe a few games of pool
with real people will help you upgrade those
imaginary friends.

Hey 750 folks, I better get a free beer for this.
The rest of you, don't bother e-mailing
(navins@stanford.edu, if you must), instead
come and have a drink with me on Thursday
night. I'm usually there by 10:30 p.m.

amongst the graduate students. We stick in
our little groups and cliques, rarely venturing
beyond to see what else is out there.
Of course, venturing out is hard; as charm
ingly awful as they are, the GSC parties aren't
really conducive to anything other than gen
tle sobbing at the state of your life, and that
never made anyone new friends.
In fact, most opportunities to meet people
outside your department carry the same un
pleasant sense of being forced. They're all
that sort of uncomfortable social mixer that
leaves an unpleasant stench of desperation
on everyone, despite the best intentions of
the organizers and guests.
Which brings us back to The 750. And its
pool table. You see, this place of ours carries
none of that uncomfortable baggage. It's
somewhere to hang out, to grab a drink before
turning in for the evening or to pick up a late
night snack before heading back to the lab.
I know that there are better bars to pick
up boys. There are better bars to dance the
night away and better bars to order the per
fect martini. But maybe a few games of pool
with real people will help you upgrade those
imaginary friends.

Hey 750 folks, I better get a free beer for this.
The rest of you, don't bother e-mailing
(navins@stanford.edu, if you must), instead
come and have a drink with me on Thursday
night. I'm usually there by 10:30 p.m.
