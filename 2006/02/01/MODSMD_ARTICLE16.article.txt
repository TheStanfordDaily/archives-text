## Door-to-door distribution is necessary 
### VILAS RAO, JOSH WEINER, RYAN TRACEY ALEX MEDEARIS 
Suppose you are the editor of a student
publication seeking to abide by the Office of
Residential Education's policy on door-to
door distribution and that you are interested
in distributing your publication to residents
in Castano. Res Ed's Web page currently in
dicates that "Castano does not allow any
form of door-to-door distribution or solicita
tion." This statement came as news to Cas
tano's residents, however, who voted at the
beginning of this year to allow door-to-door
distribution. This conflict might leave you
wondering: "Can we distribute door-to-door
in Castano or not?" If Res Ed expects student
publications to abide by its policies, they
should make it clear where door-to-door dis
tribution is permitted.
Res Ed's policy is ambiguous and confusing.

Res Ed's Web page declares that "as a stan
dard policy, door-to-door distribution of any
materials (except for those identified as house
announcements) is prohibited in residences.
However, each house, under the guidance of
their Resident Fellow or College Director
may modify the standard policy." That is, in
some dorms, the RF unilaterally decides dorm
policy. In dorms with a more permissive RF,
resident assistants may decide policy, and in
others, students arc allowed to vote. The non
uniform implementation of the current Res
Ed policy results in an incoherent hodgepodge
of distribution guidelines and is just one of the
many reasons the policy must change to allow
campus-wide door-to-door distribution.
Students want change.
Last year, students passed an advisory ref
erendum indicating that students support a
change in Res Ed's door-to-door distribution
policy. Res Ed ignored the referendum and

did not change its policy.
A ban on door-to-door distribution limits
students' access to publications and their
freedom to choose what they read.
Since its inception. Stanford has prided it
self on being an institution dedicated to
"teaching the blessings of liberty regulated
by law." Yet the current distribution policy is
both a restriction on student freedom and in
consistent with the law outside of the Stan
ford bubble. Put simply, door-to-door distri
bution is the most effective means for publi
cations to inspire discourse on campus. Many
student publications do not publish frequent
ly enough for students to know where they
can find each new issue.
So called "free speech zones" in lounges
are inadequate for distribution because they
are often obscured and in a state of disarray.
The result is that students are often
unable to find or perhaps are not even
aware of the publications that they
fund through the special fees system.
Res Ed's policy undermines the
ability of the students to decide what
they want to read. Door-to-door dis
tribution is the only way to ensure
that students can consistently access
publications that may not have a
large advertising budget and that
students may not be familiar with.
Some have argued that door-to

door distribution might create a
mess of paper on campus and that
students might become over
whelmed. However, most student
publications publish either quarterly
or monthly, and the notion that there
will be stacks of paper lining the hall
ways of dorms is improbable.
Prior to Res Ed's decision to
begin enforcing a selective ban on
door-to-door distribution in 2003,
many student publications did dis
tribute door-to-door and no one was
overwhelmed by a deluge of paper.
Furthermore, the alleged nuisance of
receiving a publication should not
outweigh the importance of free
speech, especially on a college cam
pus that is supposedly dedicated to

intellectual pursuits.
The only consistent policy is to
allow door-to-door distribution in all
dorms. Students who do not wish to
receive publications could easily opt
out of the system with a note on their
door or could simply recycle the un
wanted publication. We feel that Res
Ed has ignored students' wishes for
too long. We request that Res Ed re
consider the current policy and allow
door-to-door distribution for regis
tered Stanford student publications.
