## Door-to-door distribution is necessary 
### VILAS RAO, JOSH WEINER, RYAN TRACEY ALEX MEDEARIS 
Suppose you are the editor of a student
publication seeking to abide by the Office of
Residential Education's policy on door-to
door distribution and that you are interested
in distributing your publication to residents
in Castano. Res Ed's Web page currently in
dicates that "Castano does not allow any
form of door-to-door distribution or solicita
tion." This statement came as news to Cas
tano's residents, however, who voted at the
beginning of this year to allow door-to-door
distribution. This conflict might leave you
wondering: "Can we distribute door-to-door
in Castano or not?" If Res Ed expects student
publications to abide by its policies, they
should make it clear where door-to-door dis
tribution is permitted.
Res Ed's policy is ambiguous and confusing.

Res Ed's Web page declares that "as a stan
dard policy, door-to-door distribution of any
materials (except for those identified as house
announcements) is prohibited in residences.
However, each house, under the guidance of
their Resident Fellow or College Director
may modify the standard policy." That is, in
some dorms, the RF unilaterally decides dorm
policy. In dorms with a more permissive RF,
resident assistants may decide policy, and in
others, students arc allowed to vote. The non
uniform implementation of the current Res
Ed policy results in an incoherent hodgepodge
of distribution guidelines and is just one of the
many reasons the policy must change to allow
campus-wide door-to-door distribution.
Students want change.
Last year, students passed an advisory ref
erendum indicating that students support a
change in Res Ed's door-to-door distribution
policy. Res Ed ignored the referendum and

did not change its policy.
A ban on door-to-door distribution limits
students' access to publications and their
freedom to choose what they read.
Since its inception. Stanford has prided it
self on being an institution dedicated to
"teaching the blessings of liberty regulated
by law." Yet the current distribution policy is
both a restriction on student freedom and in
consistent with the law outside of the Stan
ford bubble. Put simply, door-to-door distri
bution is the most effective means for publi
cations to inspire discourse on campus. Many
student publications do not publish frequent
ly enough for students to know where they
can find each new issue.
So called "free speech zones" in lounges
are inadequate for distribution because they
are often obscured and in a state of disarray.
