### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
Welcome to our inaugural
" Ilirough My Eyes" — a new
Daily initiative that allows ath
letes to tell stories like they've
never been told before. Senior Amber Liu, a
two-time NCAA singles champion, kicks off
our first-person profiles for the women's ten
nis team, and we'll feature a teammate of I.iu
nearly every Wednesday until the NCAA
Championships this May. In addition,
"Through My Lyes" will start profiling Stan
ford athletes from dozens of other sports start
ing next week. Enjoy!
My final season:
Ifiis off-season, I've been working on
making the pro rankings again. In the past,
I've earned most of tny points over the sum
mer. Because my shoulder was injured this
past summer, it's almost like starting all
over again.
Last week, 1 was in Hawaii for a $50,000
challenger that conflicted with our first dual
match. I took a redeye back the day after I
finished that tournament to play against

Fresno State, which is why I only played dou
bles that day.
My fellow seniors:
llie seniors on this team are amazing. Our
close friendship has meant a lot to me over the
past three years. I couldn't have asked for a
better class to be a part of.
I think that what helped us bond from the
start was that we were a big class coming into
a very young team our freshman year. Ihe
girls that we were replacing had pretty much
been the solid leaders of the team. We felt like
we had big shoes to fill, both playing-wise and
leadership-wise.
I think it hasn't quite set in yet that I'm a
senior and that my Stanford playing days will
be over in a few short months. I think it'll be
really emotional for my class once we start
NCAAs this year -especially because we
are so close.
We also all have personalities that fit prct
ty well together. We're each pretty different,
but really get along great. I've always wanted
to comment on these girls because they're
awesome.
I think Alice |liarncs| is the true leader of
this team, both on and off the court. She leads

by example as one of the haidest workers dur
ing practice and fitness. She is by far the most
articulate speaker on the team, and she is a
great motivator beloie matches. She is also a
leader in her dual match record. Her leader
ship and friendship have made the team great
over the past three yeais.
I Everyone loves Joiimiii | K:•<> | She is like
the mother of the team - this year we voted
her the one who will be the best mother in the
futute. ()n and off the court, she takes care of
everyone. We know she has such a solid head
on her shoulders, and everyone holds her
opinion about team issues in very high regard.
We wouldn't be the same team without her.

Jess|icii Lock | is also an instrumental part
of the team. She is a great leader for us in off
court fitness and a remarkable motivator dur
ing practice. 1 ler upbeat attitude wears off on
everyone — and she really knows how to get
the team pumped up for matches. Jess plays
such a huge role in why the team is so close
both on and off the court, and we really would
n't have the same camaraderie without her.
