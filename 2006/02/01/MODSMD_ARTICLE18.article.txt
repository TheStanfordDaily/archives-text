## Desert Duel: Sin City merely a foil Freshman talent gives fencing team much needed infusion 
### ANDREW SHEN 
Mast Stanford students would be ecstatic
to spend a weekend in Las Vegas. For seven
members of the fencing team, however, this
weekend's Duel in the Desert is just one small
step towards a much larger goal.
"The Duel in the Desert is not an NCAA
Tournament," said senior Ail-American Mar
tin Lee, who explained the event was an indi
vidual tournament intended to prepare the
squad for postseason play. "1 hope that our
team members will get a feel for competition
and support each other as much as possible."
Unlike Lee. coach Lisa Milgram stressed
the importance of the tournament, describing
it as "a national competition and one that is
the strongest on the west coast."
"We are hoping to see great things," Mil
gram said.
The Cardinal come off success in Chicago,
where they defeated nine of ten opponents â€”
only defending champion Notre Dame
topped Stanford. Coming off that strong per
formance. All-American senior captain Steve
Gerberman believes this year's team is capa
ble of contending for national honors.
"This year our team is the strongest it has
been in a few years. Ihis is mostly due to a
great freshman class that's complemented by
a strong and dedicated upperclass," Cierber
man said.
