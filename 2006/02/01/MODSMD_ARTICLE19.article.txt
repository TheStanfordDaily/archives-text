It was the Cardinal against the Cardinals
on Saturday, as top-ranked Stanford dunked
No. 3 University of the Incarnate Word 103-
82 in San Antonio,Tex. Stanford, the defend
ing national champion, swept all four events
to improve to 2-0.
"The team did a great job in lexas." head
coach I leather ()lson said. "We had solid lifts
and tight patterns, and exhibited great tech
nical ability."

Sophomore captain Sara Lowe led the
way. The 2(KM (Hympian swam to three golds
on Saturday, winning the solo category, the
duet with sophomore Courtenay Stewart and
the team program.
Stewart, junior Samantha Hongiovanni-
Duclos and sophomore Elizabeth-Anne
Markman took the trio competition to com
plete the sweep for Stanford (2-0). Mnrktnan
also won the gold medal for elements.
"()ur team has had a very good start to the
season, (but |we need to improve on our abil

ity to refocus after each event," Olson said.
In the grueling format of collegiate dual
meets, that opportunity to refocus comes in
just a ten-minute window between swims.
Hie small margin for error is not lost on Stan
ford's squad of nine women, four of whom
swim three events each.
"Incarnate Word is very good at swim
ming with a lot of intensity and energy,"
Olson said. "We can really improve in this

Markinan expressed a similar
sentiment, noting that even in such a
strong performance, the Cardinal
still have room for development.
"Since it is still the beginning of
our season, there are many things we
would like to improve upon, [such
as) our execution and endurance,"
she said. "Hut I think that for so early
on in the year, we are an incredibly
close, motivated and dedicated
team."
Juniors Danielle Kramer and
Aleksandra Lazovic led UIW (0-1)

with second- and third-place finishes
in the solo category.
"It was a great competition and a
wonderful experience competing
against the best team in the country,"
UIW head coach Kim Wurzel Lo-

squad to train with the U.S. national
team. In Carlig's absence, the team
will reshuffle their lineup, and try
new routines and a technical pro
gram not usually swum in collegiate
competition.
"It is always difficult to swim
without one of your top competi

tors," Marktnan said. "We will swim
our technical routines instead of
our free routines, [because] these
routines are easier to complete
when a person is missing. Eivery
part is exactly the same for each
swimmer, whereas in a free compe
tition, there are many different
parts and different people who lift
and get lifted."
Still, the Cardinal are looking for

challenge.
"This weekend will he the perfect
opportunity to swim a Technical
Duet and our Tech Team," said
Olson, whose team will compete in
both the Collegiate Nationals held in
March at Stanford, and the U.S. Na
tional Synchronized Swimming
Championships in April. "We are
going for gold at both events."
