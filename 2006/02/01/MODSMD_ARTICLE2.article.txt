# University, union reach deal
## STANFORD MAKES CONCESSIONS, AVOIDS STRIKE Union claims "victory for workers at Stanford" 
### JAMES HOHMANN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Service workers approved an agree
ment yesterday between their union and
the University, averting a strike that
could have come at any time. The union
reported that 93 percent of voting work
ers supported the deal struck on re
opened portions of their contract.
As part of the agreement, the Univer

sity made concessions on defined pen
sion plan contributions. Other issues of
contention have been deferred until a
new series of negations resume this sum
mer.
Zev Kvitky, a spokesman for Service
International Employees Union Local
715 (SElU).said that the agreement was
not what the union had hoped for but
called it a "reasonable offer."
"The vote shows that our members
recognized it is a real victory for the
workers at Stanford." he said. "While we
were not able to win everything that we
wanted, we were able to overturn deci

sions that were made by the Board of
Trustees."
Alan Acosta, director of University
communications told ITie Daily that the
University was glad it found middle
ground while still at the bargaining table.
"We reached a good agreement for
Stanford's union workers," he said.
"There was an improvement on retire
ment pension plans, and we think that is a
good thing."
The University agreed to increase the
amount of money it contributes to de
fined-pension plans by increasing the
base vear for contributions. A more re

cent base year means a higher benefit
due to the impact of inflation.
"As part of the agreement, the Uni
versity will change the base earnings
year' for the Stanford Retirement Annu
ity Plan (SRAP) from 1992 to 1994 effec
tive retroactive to Sept. 1,2005," Acosta
said in a statement, explaining that an
other increase will be made in 2008. "In
addition, SRAP will not be a subject of
negotiations this summer, when discus
sions for the next contract begin."
