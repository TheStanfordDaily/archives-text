# University, union reach deal
## STANFORD MAKES CONCESSIONS, AVOIDS STRIKE Union claims "victory for workers at Stanford" 
### JAMES HOHMANN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Service workers approved an agree
ment yesterday between their union and
the University, averting a strike that
could have come at any time. The union
reported that 93 percent of voting work
ers supported the deal struck on re
opened portions of their contract.
As part of the agreement, the Univer

sity made concessions on defined pen
sion plan contributions. Other issues of
contention have been deferred until a
new series of negations resume this sum
mer.
Zev Kvitky, a spokesman for Service
International Employees Union Local
715 (SElU).said that the agreement was
not what the union had hoped for but
called it a "reasonable offer."
"The vote shows that our members
recognized it is a real victory for the
workers at Stanford." he said. "While we
were not able to win everything that we
wanted, we were able to overturn deci

sions that were made by the Board of
Trustees."
Alan Acosta, director of University
communications told ITie Daily that the
University was glad it found middle
ground while still at the bargaining table.
"We reached a good agreement for
Stanford's union workers," he said.
"There was an improvement on retire
ment pension plans, and we think that is a
good thing."
The University agreed to increase the
amount of money it contributes to de
fined-pension plans by increasing the
base vear for contributions. A more re

cent base year means a higher benefit
due to the impact of inflation.
"As part of the agreement, the Uni
versity will change the base earnings
year' for the Stanford Retirement Annu
ity Plan (SRAP) from 1992 to 1994 effec
tive retroactive to Sept. 1,2005," Acosta
said in a statement, explaining that an
other increase will be made in 2008. "In
addition, SRAP will not be a subject of
negotiations this summer, when discus
sions for the next contract begin."
The University has tried to move

away from defined benefit pension
plans, as have many other employ
ers, in favor of a plan that empowers
employees to make matched contri
butions in the Stanford Contributo
ry Retirement Plan (SCRP).
Kvitky described the change in
the base years as a significant gain
for labor negotiations.
"We were able to stop that two
tiered retirement plan from going
into effect so that new employees
will have the same retirement plan
we do and will not have contribu
tions reduced," he said.
The union and its supporters said
the threat of a strike played an im
portant role in their favor during the

negotiations. Union members had
voted by a 92 percent margin to au
thorize the negotiating team to call a
strike if necessary.
"We were able to reach this
agreement in part under the threat
of another strike," Kvitky said.
"Until there had been a strike on
Dec. 12, the University had refused
to negotiate on some of the most im
portant proposals we put forward. It
was not until we showed our
strength in the strike that their posi
tion changed."
Labor leaders on campus ap
peared to have an emboldened tone
after what they considered a major
victory.
"This is the first time that work
ers have really stood up at Stan
ford to defend benefits and fight
policy decisions made by the sen
ior most decision makers at the
University," Kvitky added. "It is

important that workers and stu
dents at Stanford understand that
they have the power to change
those decisions."
"This demonstrates that the Uni
versity has the ability to fulfill work
er's requests," said Student Labor
Action Coalition (SLAC)
spokesman and sophomore Matt
Seriff-Cullick in an interview with
The Daily.
Both sides acknowledged that
the agreement covered a limited
range of issues. The remaining
points of contention, including
wages and other benefits, will be ad
dressed when negotiations for a new
contract begin this summer. Dates
have not yet been set for these talks
to begin. The current contract, in
cluding the re-opened portion, is set
to expire on Sept. 1,2(K)6.
University and union representa
tives said they hope for good faith

bargaining when they meet to nego
tiate again.
"This agreement shows that diffi
cult issues can be resolved at the
bargaining table," said Executive
Director of Human Resources
Diane Peck in a statement released
by the University last night. "We are
optimistic that this same spirit of
meaningful dialogue and coopera
tion will be central to the upcoming
negotiations this summer."
"We have won the battle, but
there is still a fight ahead," Kvitky
said.
The contract was reopened last
Fall by the SEIU to discuss benefits.
The new agreement affects nearly
1,2(K) University workers, including
maintenance, custodial and food
service employees. The Hospital
workers, also represented by the
SEIU, ratified a new contract on
Jan. 20.

ry Retirement Plan (SCRP).
Kvitky described the change in
the base years as a significant gain
for labor negotiations.
"We were able to stop that two
tiered retirement plan from going
into effect so that new employees
will have the same retirement plan
we do and will not have contribu
tions reduced," he said.
The union and its supporters said
the threat of a strike played an im
portant role in their favor during the

negotiations. Union members had
voted by a 92 percent margin to au
thorize the negotiating team to call a
strike if necessary.
"We were able to reach this
agreement in part under the threat
of another strike," Kvitky said.
"Until there had been a strike on
Dec. 12, the University had refused
to negotiate on some of the most im
portant proposals we put forward. It
was not until we showed our
strength in the strike that their posi
tion changed."
Labor leaders on campus ap
peared to have an emboldened tone
after what they considered a major
victory.
"This is the first time that work
ers have really stood up at Stan
ford to defend benefits and fight
policy decisions made by the sen
ior most decision makers at the
University," Kvitky added. "It is

important that workers and stu
dents at Stanford understand that
they have the power to change
those decisions."
"This demonstrates that the Uni
versity has the ability to fulfill work
er's requests," said Student Labor
Action Coalition (SLAC)
spokesman and sophomore Matt
Seriff-Cullick in an interview with
The Daily.
Both sides acknowledged that
the agreement covered a limited
range of issues. The remaining
points of contention, including
wages and other benefits, will be ad
dressed when negotiations for a new
contract begin this summer. Dates
have not yet been set for these talks
to begin. The current contract, in
cluding the re-opened portion, is set
to expire on Sept. 1,2(K)6.
University and union representa
tives said they hope for good faith

bargaining when they meet to nego
tiate again.
"This agreement shows that diffi
cult issues can be resolved at the
bargaining table," said Executive
Director of Human Resources
Diane Peck in a statement released
by the University last night. "We are
optimistic that this same spirit of
meaningful dialogue and coopera
tion will be central to the upcoming
negotiations this summer."
"We have won the battle, but
there is still a fight ahead," Kvitky
said.
The contract was reopened last
Fall by the SEIU to discuss benefits.
The new agreement affects nearly
1,2(K) University workers, including
maintenance, custodial and food
service employees. The Hospital
workers, also represented by the
SEIU, ratified a new contract on
Jan. 20.
