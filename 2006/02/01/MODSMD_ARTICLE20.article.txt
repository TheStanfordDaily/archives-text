# Hey media; Supersize XL Bowl
## 
### 
Remember lust month? I lie
Indianapolis Colts marched
to a 13-0 record and took full
control of the AM' South.'l he ques
tions of a perfect season never
seemed to cease for head coach
Tony Dungy.
But each time the question was
asked, he stood by his answer: no
body (particularly himself) cares
about 16-o.The main goal remains to
win the Super Bowl
Today, just four da\s in advance
of Detroit's Super Bowl XL. the
Pittsburgh Steelers and Seattle Sea
hawks stand primed for the big
stage. So perhaps it's a moot point,
but I wonder if Dungy s words of
wisdom could have simply been a
coaching tactic beyond my modest
football intelligence? I urther,even
if he was serious, is this really a
good way to go about thinking
about the game?
Winning the Super Bowl this sea
son would have made the Colts the
40th team all-time to claim the title
of World Champions. Going 16-0, on
the other hand, would have put the
Colts in much more elite company,
as only one other team in the history
of the NFL has completed an entire
regular season undefeated.
Let's look at the situation at
hand, though. Hie front page ol
ESPN.conr's coverage of tire Super
Bowl this past weekend was the
story of Jerome Bettis returning to
his hometown of Detroit, looking
for his first championship ling in
what looks to be his first final game.
During the hour-long media day
session yesterday, Bettis fielded
questions from everyone with a tape
recorder. It was not until the 52nd
minute, however, that there came a
question about the actual upcoming
big game. I'm not saying that the
hometown angle isn't air interesting
subplot and a nice feel good story.
But it is just that: a subplot.
In the past few years, when the
New England Patriots made their
historic championship runs, at least
the story was about the combination
of star players without a superstar
talent, save for 'Ibm Brady, lhat
group of guys just knew how to get it
done, little by little, strategi/ing
around the tools that they had.
In our current situation, we have
two medium-market teams who
don't even have that storyline going
for them, lire Scahawks do have
Shaun Alexander, the regular sea
son's MVP, hut they won their con
ference championship game essen
tially without his services.
On the front page of most spoils
Web sites iir the last five days, there
have been more iron Super Bowl
headline stories than I can count on
one hand. Two Sundays ago, on the
niglrt of the AM" and NIC ('hampi
onship games that would send two
teams on to Detroit for the Big One,
a man named Kobe Bryant upstaged
the entire spoit of football by scor
ing a historic SI points against the
Toronto Raptors.
That same night, Ray Allen beat
the buzzer in double overtime to
give his Seattle Supersonics a com
paratively meaningless 152-149 win
that was the highest scoring game I
can remember.
lit the time since then, hockey
icon Mario Lemieux retired for the
second time from the Pittsburgh
Penguins, Michelle Kwan confirmed
her controversial spot on the U.S.
Olympic Figure Skating leam and
the Senior Bowl (one of the most
prominent college football all stai
games) showed that the drama ol
just getting into the NI L is more
news-worthy than anything actually
regarding the game that ultimately
decides the champions of that veiy
league.
It was interesting over the last
week how every practice was heavi
ly scrutinized and every detail
recorded for the Senior Bowl, as
scouts, coaches and players in
eluding Stanford's Julian Jenkins.
Jon Alsoir and Balnitundc Oshi

Sure, advancing to the next level
in any aspect of life is exciting.This is
why signing and draft days are
among the most exciting on the

sports calendar. But since when did
merely cracking the pro ranks be
come more important than winning
(he actual championship?
Here's hoping that, despite the
relative lack of buildup to this year's
Super Bowl, the actual football in
this game ultimately gives fans
something to care about.
