## Cal beckons for No. 13 Card Card looking for strong beam performance from freshman 
### JUSTINA KAMIEL GRAYMAN 
ITie curse of the early season: early misses, sudden
falls and breaks in technique.
On Friday, the No. 13 women's gymnastics team
will compete against No. 35 California. Team totals
speak volumes, and Cal's 190.762 average in compar
ison to Stanford's 194.475 reflects the absence of indi
vidual standouts on the Bears' squad.
Stanford, meanwhile, has found an all-around gem
in sophomore Tabitha Yim. Not only is she ranked in
the Pac- 10's top-two in every event, but her 39.6 aver
age also earned her a top national ranking in the all
around.
Cardinal freshman Nicole Ourada is also powerful
in the all-around, ranking fifth in the Pac-10 with a
38.992 average. Senior Natalie Foley, who has the sea
son-high in the all-around with 39.15, is looking to
bounce back from last week's low 37.15.
Cal freshman Jessica Kelley is ranked No. 15 in the
Pac-10 in the all-around with a season average of 38.5.
Junior Siobhan Luce and senior Britani Pittullo both
have season all-around highs of 38.2.
The Cardinal are statistically strongest on vault,
ranking sixth (49.008 average) in the nation and atop
the Pac-10. Key contributors include Yim,sophomore
Liz Tricase, sophomore Alex Pintchouk.and Ourada.
In the Pac-10, Yim is ranked second (9.858 aver
age),Tricase fifth (9.808 average) and Pintchouk sev
enth (9.8 average) on vault. Senior Glyn Sweets' early
season performance of 9.925 in the vault also high
lighted her potential.
Berkeley lacks individuals who consistently shine
in the event, with no gymnast averaging over 9.65 on
vault for the season. Pittullo's 9.75 is the team's lead
ing score, but the Bears' 47.463 average pales in com
parison to Stanford's 49.008.
Both teams' uneven bars skills are the near the top
of their event lineups. Cal enters Friday's meet with a
48.125 season average while Stanford holds a 48.692.
Cal's leading performer is freshman Joanna Bennett,
whose 9.6875 season-high is also the team's highest
mark.
In the Bears' Jan. 13 meet against Sacramento
State, three Cal gymnasts tied for first in the uneven
bars: Bennett, ranked No. 18 on bars in the Pac-10
(9.687 average), Pittullo, and sophomore Nicki Wells,
who also performed a 9.725 against Oregon State on
Jan. 20, and is ranked No. 15 in the Pac-10 in bars (9.7
average).
With a season-high of 49.25, and four gymnasts
cracking 9.8 this season, includingTVicase's spectacu
lar 9.95, bars is a strong event for Stanford. In bars,
Yim is sixth (9.9 average) and Tricase is eighth in the
nation (9.892 average).
"Bars is going to be the event that I can contribute
the most on throughout the season." said TYicase, who
also looks forward to being joining the floor lineup
soon.
Although balance beam is a common weakness for
many teams, both Cal and Stanford are consistently
better in beam than in floor exercise.
Cal freshman Lydia Williams' 9.775 is the most im
pressive beam high. Freshman teammate Tiffany
Tarn's 9.675 average places her No. 11 in the Pac-10.
Freshmen may be battling it out on beam, as Card
freshman Kelly Fee, ranked 7th in the Pac-10 with a
9.75 average, posted a tremendous 9.825 on beam last

weekend against Oregon State.
Yim's 9.825 beam average reflects a consistency
that has earned her a No. 8 national ranking on beam.
Floor is the weakest event for both the Cardinal
and the Bears.
On floor, Stanford gymnasts Foley (ranked third in
the Pac-10) and Yim (ranked fourth nationally) lead
the pack with highs of 9.875 and 9.925, respectively.
Both are consistent, averaging above 9.8. Additional
ly, Ourada ranks second in the Pac-10 with a 9.85 floor
average.
California's Kelley, ranked 18th in the confer
ence on floor, has a consistent average of 9.708
along with a high of 9.725. Junior Isabel Garcia also
boasts consistency, sporting a 9.65 high and a 9.606
average on floor.
As the Cardinal work their way toward mid-sea
son, Friday's meet against California will provide
them a measuring stick. Yim is confident her team will
stack up well.
"We have a talented team, and we're motivated,"
Yim said."l really think we can win the NCAAs."
