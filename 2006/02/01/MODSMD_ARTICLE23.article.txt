If upsetting Cal twice in two weeks wasn't enough,
the men's gymnastics team has another reason to cel
ebrate. After an impressive performance at Berkeley,
sophomore David Sender was honored as the MPSF

Gymnast of the Week.
The award was a
first for Sender. His
victories against Cal
(0-2) on Jan. 13 in the
floor exercise (9.35)

and vault (9.55), along with a shared win on the rings
with freshman teammate Bryant Hadden (9.3), were
instrumental in the narrow Cardinal (2-0) upset.
Sender also claimed the all-around title at the Stan
ford Open on Jan. 21, with a score of 51.625. His first
place finish on the vault (9.450), along with the previ
ous win at Cal, earned Sender a first-place ranking na
tionally on the vault.
Sender's dominance extends beyond the vault, as
he is also ranked fifth nationally in the all-around,
sixth on the floor exercise and eighth on the still rings.
Sender is one of five Cardinal gymnasts competing
in the Winter Cup in Las Vegas, Nev. from Feb. 2 to
Feb. 4. Juniors Dylan Carney and Alex Schorsch and
sophomores Sho Nakamori and Jason Shen will com
pete with Sender, and the top six all-around finishers
will qualify for the U.S. National Team.
