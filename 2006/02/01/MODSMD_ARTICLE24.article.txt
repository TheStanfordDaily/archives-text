## Mascot controversy mirrors national debate Professional sports teams also under fire for racist logos, emblems 
### ANDREW BURMON STAFF WRITER 
On Jan. 26th President Hennessy
released a statement condemning
the use of the now defunct Indian
Mascot in association with the Uni
versity, on the grounds that the re
tired mascot constituted a racist de
piction of Native Americans. The
statement came in reaction to an
outcry from the campus Native
American community over T-shirts
made by Sigma Chi and, separately,
by two alumni members of the sail
ing team.
Hennessy's statement pleased
Co-Chair of the Stanford American
Indian Organization Jackson Brossy,
a senior, who said he had been hop
ing for this kind of statement for sev
eral years.
"I'm glad he finally took a stance
on this issue," Brossy told The Daily,
adding that he was also "disappoint
ed that today this is even a debate
about whether or not it is permissible
to use the Stanford 'Indian' carica
ture."
But the debate continues, not
only on campus, but nationally.
In 1991 a group of well-known
Native American activists founded
the National Coalition on Racism in
Sports and Media, an organization
that has spent the last several years
attacking the Cleveland Indians,
Washington Redskins, Kansas City
Chiefs and Atlanta Braves.
The NCRSM is headed by Ver
non Bellecourt, a key player in the
1973 siege at Wounded Knee, North
Dakota — where Native Ameri
cans sought to reclaim a piece of land
and were blocked by the federal gov
ernment.
In 1998, Charlene Teters, senior
editor of Indian Artist Magazine,
wrote an article on the subject of the
Cleveland Indians mascot stating
that "Chief Wahoo offends Indian
people the same way that little black
sambo offended African Americans
and the frito bandito offended the
Hispanic community." In the same

essay she called for the elimination
of Indian mascots by the year 2000.
Now, in 2006, little has changed.
By and large this seems to be a prod
uct of apathy that pervades not only
Cleveland, Ohio but Stanford Cali
fornia. Talking to students, it is near
ly impossible to get a positive or neg
ative reaction concerning the Indian
Mascot issue.
Most students don't seem to feel
that the old mascot is offensive to
their heritage either. This fact seems
to explain the campus's indifference
toward the issue at stake. Brossy said
he still can't believe anyone would
be careless enough to reinstate the
racist depiction.
"I most definitely find that mas
cot to be personally offensive," he
said "Those who print such carica
tures must know that too; why else
would it be banned?"
Luukas lives, a freshman who
wrote a letter to the editor of The
Daily said that "equating students]
fashion expression to Fundamental
Standard violations like assault or
fraud would make Stanford's admin
istration no better than Mao or Stal
in" still thinks otherwise. He sites the
Indian logo as a free speech issue and
asks, "who stands up for free speech
— no matter how ugly it might be —
when the interests of a minority be
come law?"
In this case the law was created in
1975 when a referendum overturned
the Stanford mascot by a majority of
more than 2-1 against. That majority,
while sizeable, had taken three years
of lobbying to solidify. In 1972, a sim
ilar referendum held and the Stan
ford Indian had weathered the
storm.
As of today, Stanford has no offi
cial mascot, unless you count the am
biguous cardinal color. The Tree is
truly the mascot of the Band. While
members of Sigma Chi and The Sail
ing Team have eagerly apologized to
the Native American Community, it
is unlikely that anyone will come up
with a viable alternative the students
said.
Sanjay Kairam, a philosophy co
term, had one suggestion.
"Maybe we could be the Stanford
Host of Possibilities that, on closer
inspection, may not be available to
you," he said.
