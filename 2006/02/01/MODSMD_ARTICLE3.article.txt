## Next on the table: proper manners Etiquette Dinner part of ongoing Career Week events, draws long waiting list 
### MELISSA FUSCO STAFF WRITER 
As part of Career Week, the Career Develop
ment Center (CDC) will host a full-scale eti
quette dinner at the Faculty Club tonight at 6
p.m., to instruct students on how to handle inter
views and meetings in formal settings.
Sharyn Kennedy Amoroso, a certified eti
quette and protocol consultant, will host the
event, walking the attendees through the finer
points of handling a business meal. The four
course dinner will feature a full complement of
utensils and table settings.
Lance Choy, director of the CDC, charac
terized the dinner as a study in "elegant west
ern continental dining," something job appli
cants will frequently confront in the corporate
world.
Provided in the event's program is a detailed
map of a formal place setting, including three
different forks, five knives, three glasses, a
water goblet and a champagne flute at every
seat.
"We have everything but the fish fork — they
didn't have those at the Faculty Club," said Veda
Jeffries, assistant director of counseling at the
CDC, who organized the event.
Also on hand will be Nordstrom's Fashion
Consultant Maureen Norton, who will provide
tips on how to dress for interviews and other such
occasions.
Choy noted that dress codes can vary in dif
ferent work environments. Technology compa
nies such as Apple, as well as small startups, are
typically casual, while management consulting
and Wall Street environments are generally
more formal.
However, there will always be details that re
main mysterious to prospective job applicants,
Choy said.
"What kind of suit should a guy
wear?" he asked. "What color socks
does he need to go with the suit?"
"Does he need ankle socks?
Does he need socks at all?"
Choy noted that instruction on
formal etiquette can be especially
helpful to students from diverse
backgrounds.
"Different countries have differ
ent customs, and this information
can be very helpful to students com
ing from different traditions," he
said. "Vegetarians, for example,
might have questions about how to
handle a dining situation gracefully.
Another frequent question we get is
about when it is appropriate to offer
to pay for a dinner, and how this
should be done."
Students attending the event
have been asked to dress in formal
attire.The cost of the event is $20 per
student, with the CDC covering half
of the total expenses.
This is the first year that the CDC
has hosted a dinner focusing solely
on etiquette.
With more than 160 students reg
istered and 200 currently on the
waiting list, Choy and Jeffries char
acterized the event as a major suc
cess.
"It's great that we've had such a
positive response," Jeffries said. "I
am glad people are taking advan
tage of this opportunity."
