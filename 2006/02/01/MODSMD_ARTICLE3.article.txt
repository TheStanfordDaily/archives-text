## Next on the table: proper manners Etiquette Dinner part of ongoing Career Week events, draws long waiting list 
### MELISSA FUSCO STAFF WRITER 
As part of Career Week, the Career Develop
ment Center (CDC) will host a full-scale eti
quette dinner at the Faculty Club tonight at 6
p.m., to instruct students on how to handle inter
views and meetings in formal settings.
Sharyn Kennedy Amoroso, a certified eti
quette and protocol consultant, will host the
event, walking the attendees through the finer
points of handling a business meal. The four
course dinner will feature a full complement of
utensils and table settings.
Lance Choy, director of the CDC, charac
terized the dinner as a study in "elegant west
ern continental dining," something job appli
cants will frequently confront in the corporate
world.
Provided in the event's program is a detailed
map of a formal place setting, including three
different forks, five knives, three glasses, a
water goblet and a champagne flute at every
seat.
"We have everything but the fish fork â€” they
didn't have those at the Faculty Club," said Veda
Jeffries, assistant director of counseling at the
CDC, who organized the event.
Also on hand will be Nordstrom's Fashion
Consultant Maureen Norton, who will provide
tips on how to dress for interviews and other such
occasions.
Choy noted that dress codes can vary in dif
ferent work environments. Technology compa
nies such as Apple, as well as small startups, are
typically casual, while management consulting
and Wall Street environments are generally
more formal.
However, there will always be details that re
main mysterious to prospective job applicants,
Choy said.
