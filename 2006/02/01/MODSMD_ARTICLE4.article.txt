# STATE OF THE UNION
## Speech elicits mixed reviews Bush goes global, students want domestic focus 
### RAHUL KANAKIA, DEBORAH SOHN DENISE SOHN CONTRIBUTING WRITERS 
Students gathered in residence hous
es across campus last night at 6 p.m. to
watch President George W. Bush deliver
his annual State of the Union address.
While he spent over half of his speech

discussing the foreign policy and terror
ism, most students said they were con
cerned with his domestic policies.
Bush's address touched on a wide
range of his administration's policies, in
cluding continuing the war in Iraq. So
cial Security and Medicare reform and
independence from foreign oil. In addi
tion, he addressed the recent ethical
scandals exposed within the Republican
Party, his guest-worker program, fight
ing AIDS and increasing efforts to edu
cate America's children in the maths
and sciences.
Reactions to the speech across cam

pus were mixed.
Morris Fiorina, a political science
professor and senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution found the address to
be a "strong speech." 1
"While the address was somewhat of
a pep talk, it was nevertheless a strong
speech " Fiorina told The Daily. "What
was striking was that he did not back
down on anything. I le strongly defended
the wiretapping and the Patriot Act."
Furthermore, Fiorina felt that most
Americans would trade some liberty for

the promise of security.
University President John Hen
nessy released a statement indicat
ing he was encouraged by the presi
dent's foresight in recognizing the
need to maintain America's leader
ship in science and technology. Ac
cording to Hennessy, the nation's
educational leaders stand ready to
work with the executive branch to
increase the federal commitment to
scientific research and improving
the quality of education in the maths
and sciences at the high school level.
The Roosevelt Institute, a stu
dent-run progressive think tank on
campus, had assigned a group of stu
dents to write responses to the State
of the Union, with each focusing on
different issues.
Senior Julia Spiegel, a member of
the Institution, concentrated on in
ternational development.
"President Bush," she said,"con
tinually mentioned HIV/AIDS and
malaria initiatives, which was good.
But there wasn't any explicit men
tion of Darfur or what we should be
doing there. That was disappoint
ing."
Craig Segall Holt, a second-year
law student, commented on envi
ronmental issues.
"I'm very pleased that President
Bush addressed America's addic
tion to oil, but he ignored the ele
phant in the room, which is global
climate change," he said. "While his
proposed research into nuclear,
solar, coal and wind power is a step
forward, it is not enough. He should
create market incentives to encour
age industry to adopt those alterna
tives."
Tim Telleen-Lawton, a co-termi
nal, also expressed surprise. Telleen-
Lawton said he was pleased by
Bush's mention of the addiction to
oil and the portrayal of oil in a nega
tive light. However, he also noted
that Bush did not address any will
ingness to cut down on US oil con
sumption.
Roosevelt Institution member
senior Jonathan Elkin expressed
mixed feelings on education policy.
"I liked that Bush encouraged
American educational competitive
ness. His idea of training 70,(XX) new
teachers sounds great," Elkin said.
"But to successfully encourage
quality people to enter the profes
sion will require incentives like
mortgage housing assistance, sign
ing bonuses and student loan for
giveness. These cost money, and

judging from Bush's consistent
under funding of No Child Left Be
hind, I'm not holding my breath that
his actions will match his rhetoric. I
hope he proves me wrong."
Sophomore Ben Fong shared
Elkin's skepticism.
"His emphasis on the math and
sciences is a good idea," he told The
Daily. "But he didn't say how he
would go about making them."
"President Bush did a fair job of
addressing the mistakes of his ad
ministration, like Hurricane Katri
na," Fong added. "It was interesting
that he tried to reach out to other
nations, and at the same time, assert
ed American leadership. It seemed a
little contradictory."
Sophomore David Hall said he
was disappointed with Bush's com
ments on the domestic spying scan
dal.
"He failed to address the scan
dal. He mentioned it briefly, but re
ally skirted the issue of domestic
surveillance," he said.
Junior Donald Stevens, president
of the Stanford College Republi
cans, disagreed, remarking that he
felt Bush appropriately addressed
the domestic eavesdropping pro
gram.
"I think it's really good that he
addressed the ethical violations in
Congress," he said. "As a Republi
can I have been waiting a long time
for this to happen. It's definitely
time for the Republican Party to
step up, and they definitely did it
tonight and said that we're not going
to tolerate anyone breaking the
rules.
"The President encouraged his
opposition to put aside the past and
focus achieving victory in Iraq,"
Stevens added.
Not all students who tuned into
the address expressed strong opin
ions about the speech.
Junior Megan Stacy said, "He
didn't really say anything different.

dent it would have been the same."

dent it would have been the same."
Students gathered in residence hous
es across campus last night at 6 p.m. to
watch President George W. Bush deliver
his annual State of the Union address.
While he spent over half of his speech

discussing the foreign policy and terror
ism, most students said they were con
cerned with his domestic policies.
Bush's address touched on a wide
range of his administration's policies, in
cluding continuing the war in Iraq. So
cial Security and Medicare reform and
independence from foreign oil. In addi
tion, he addressed the recent ethical
scandals exposed within the Republican
Party, his guest-worker program, fight
ing AIDS and increasing efforts to edu
cate America's children in the maths
and sciences.
Reactions to the speech across cam

pus were mixed.
Morris Fiorina, a political science
professor and senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution found the address to
be a "strong speech." 1
"While the address was somewhat of
a pep talk, it was nevertheless a strong
speech " Fiorina told The Daily. "What
was striking was that he did not back
down on anything. I le strongly defended
the wiretapping and the Patriot Act."
Furthermore, Fiorina felt that most
Americans would trade some liberty for


President Bush speaks to the nation during last night's annual State of the Union address
the promise of security.
University President John Hen
nessy released a statement indicat
ing he was encouraged by the presi
dent's foresight in recognizing the
need to maintain America's leader
ship in science and technology. Ac
cording to Hennessy, the nation's
educational leaders stand ready to
work with the executive branch to
increase the federal commitment to
scientific research and improving
the quality of education in the maths
and sciences at the high school level.
The Roosevelt Institute, a stu
dent-run progressive think tank on
campus, had assigned a group of stu
dents to write responses to the State
of the Union, with each focusing on
different issues.
Senior Julia Spiegel, a member of
the Institution, concentrated on in
ternational development.
"President Bush," she said,"con
tinually mentioned HIV/AIDS and
malaria initiatives, which was good.
But there wasn't any explicit men
tion of Darfur or what we should be
doing there. That was disappoint
ing."
Craig Segall Holt, a second-year
law student, commented on envi
ronmental issues.
"I'm very pleased that President
Bush addressed America's addic
tion to oil, but he ignored the ele
phant in the room, which is global
climate change," he said. "While his
proposed research into nuclear,
solar, coal and wind power is a step
forward, it is not enough. He should
create market incentives to encour
age industry to adopt those alterna
tives."
Tim Telleen-Lawton, a co-termi
nal, also expressed surprise. Telleen-
Lawton said he was pleased by
Bush's mention of the addiction to
oil and the portrayal of oil in a nega
tive light. However, he also noted
that Bush did not address any will
ingness to cut down on US oil con
sumption.
Roosevelt Institution member
senior Jonathan Elkin expressed
mixed feelings on education policy.
"I liked that Bush encouraged
American educational competitive
ness. His idea of training 70,(XX) new
teachers sounds great," Elkin said.
"But to successfully encourage
quality people to enter the profes
sion will require incentives like
mortgage housing assistance, sign
ing bonuses and student loan for
giveness. These cost money, and

judging from Bush's consistent
under funding of No Child Left Be
hind, I'm not holding my breath that
his actions will match his rhetoric. I
hope he proves me wrong."
Sophomore Ben Fong shared
Elkin's skepticism.
"His emphasis on the math and
sciences is a good idea," he told The
Daily. "But he didn't say how he
would go about making them."
"President Bush did a fair job of
addressing the mistakes of his ad
ministration, like Hurricane Katri
na," Fong added. "It was interesting
that he tried to reach out to other
nations, and at the same time, assert
ed American leadership. It seemed a
little contradictory."
Sophomore David Hall said he
was disappointed with Bush's com
ments on the domestic spying scan
dal.
"He failed to address the scan
dal. He mentioned it briefly, but re
ally skirted the issue of domestic
surveillance," he said.
Junior Donald Stevens, president
of the Stanford College Republi
cans, disagreed, remarking that he
felt Bush appropriately addressed
the domestic eavesdropping pro
gram.
"I think it's really good that he
addressed the ethical violations in
Congress," he said. "As a Republi
can I have been waiting a long time
for this to happen. It's definitely
time for the Republican Party to
step up, and they definitely did it
tonight and said that we're not going
to tolerate anyone breaking the
rules.
"The President encouraged his
opposition to put aside the past and
focus achieving victory in Iraq,"
Stevens added.
Not all students who tuned into
the address expressed strong opin
ions about the speech.
Junior Megan Stacy said, "He
didn't really say anything different.
If it had been a Democratic presi
dent it would have been the same."
