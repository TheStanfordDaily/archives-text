## ASSU Senate goes techie to solve campus problems Committees look to address finances and funding 
### MICHAEL TAMKIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate con
vened last night to discuss plans to improve
the use of technology around campus, hear
updates from committees and plan for cam
pus-wide cultural events. In addition, the

Senate approved confirmation of a new
ASSU associate financial manager and
passed funding bills for various student
groups.
The meeting opened with a presentation
from ASSU Vice President Aneto
Okonkwo, a senior, concerning the findings
of the Student Technology Assessment
Committee (STAC), which was founded
last spring.
"We had a series of meetings over the
course of spring quarter last year, and I'm

hoping senators will feel passionate about a
certain issue and try to make some
changes," Okonkwo said. "Our main goals
were to improve student life and cost of liv
ing using technology, streamline University
interaction through technology, impact
University Technology policy-making and
coordinate different technology initiatives
across the University."
Okonkwo outlined some of his commit
tees' recommendations, including the fol
lowing: more wireless hotspots around cam

pus — mitigating the overload of Axess
and housing servers at peak times — an in
crease in both e-mail storage and virtual
storage space for students and increased
staffing for Residential Computing.
"We'd also like to have cheaper and
more flexible technology training for soft
ware to reduce the digital divide so students
with a less technical background are not at
a disadvantage," Okonkwosaid. "We're one
of the top technical schools in the country so I
think the University could do more to help bridge
the divide.
"We've also been trying to work on online
room reservations and scheduling, which is cur
rently a huge bane on student groups," he added.
ASSU Financial Manager Justin Fishner-
Wolfson then gave the Senate an update on re
fund requests for student group fees, which closed
last week. He reported that around 7(X) people re
quested refunds, which represented a refund rate
similar to previous years' and subsequently
should not represent a problem for group budgets
for the rest of the year.
Recently confirmed Publications Director
Brendan Marten, also chief operating officer of
The Daily, spoke to the Senate about his plans for
the quarter.
"We've been getting a list of publications we're
supposed to oversee and will figure out soon
who's going to be on the board," Marten said.
"We've also emailed The Stanford Review with
regards to the distribution policy and we'll see
what we can do to help that situation.
"Some of our more long-term projects include
dining hall distribution and getting golf carts for
publication distribution, so we're going to contin
ue talking to Dining Services about how to get the
publications into bins," Marten explained.
The Senate then heard updates from the chairs
of various standing committees, including Senate
Communications Chair Rong Xu, a junior.
"We discussed with the Stanford Cardinal
Broadcasting Network the possibility of having
Senate meetings filmed, and we're talking with
other ASSU groups to see if they would like to
have their meetings filmed as well," Xu said.
He also announced that the Senate's quarterly
"office hours" will be held this year on Feb. 14,
sometime between 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m.
Additionally providing the updates for her

committee was Student Life, Housing and Educa
tion Chair Kat Kershner, a sophomore, who de
scribed continuing efforts to discuss student space
issues in Tresidder Union, as well as plans for a
community-center outreach event.
"We would like to recognize community cen
ters on campus for all the work they do, and put
on an event similar to an Art Affair, with the focus
possibly on cultural food," Kershner said. "We
will probably hold it in White Plaza or in an audi
torium sometime during spring quarter."
In one of the meetings' action bills, the Senate
approved recent alumnus Matt McDonald as as
sociate ASSU financial manager, pending ap
proval by two-thirds of the Graduate Student
Council (GSC). If confirmed, McDonald would
serve in the position until July, when he would be

come the financial manager.
According to ASSU President Melanie Kan
nokada, a senior, McDonald stood out due to "his
motivation and enthusiasm for the job."
"He's an outsider, which means he brings good
ideas and experience, and he's also just graduat
ed, which will give him a full two quarters to
train," she added.
Finally, the Senate passed funding bills for
groups including Urban Styles Dance Company,
Black Graduation Committee, Alliance Street
dance, Stanford Black Pre-Med Organization,
Chabad at Stanford, Black Liberation Month,
United Students for Veterans' Health, Stanford
Cooking Club and Alpha Phi Omega.
The Senate also approved a reserve transfer
for the Stanford Band.
