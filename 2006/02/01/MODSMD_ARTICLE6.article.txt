## Stanford to test Bird Flu vaccine Researchers asking for human volunteers to take part 
### STEPHANIE FAGLIANO STAFF WRITER 
Whenever a new strain of influenza emerges,
the current vaccines are rendered largely inef
fective and a flu pandemic can occur.
Chiron, a multi-dimensional biotech compa
ny. plans to conduct vaccine clinical trials at sev
eral facilities, including Stanford, to avert such
crises.The company initially started working on
a vaccine for Avian Flu soon after the virus' out
break in Hong Kong first affected humans in
1997.Hie National Institute of Health,or NIH,
formed a contract with Chiron to manufacture
the vaccine so they could test it at top-notch fa
cilities like the University.
Today, the risk of an Avian Influenza, com
monly known as the Bird Flu, pandemic is real.
Since 2(X)3. the number of humans who have
contracted the Bird Flu has been growing. Cases
have been reported in Thailand. Vietnam, Cam
bodia. Indonesia and'llirkey.and more than half
of the people who have been infected with the
virus have died.
Exposure to infected poultry is believed to
be the cause of each of these cases, but there is
concern that that the Bird Flu will evolve into a
virus capable of human-to-human transmission.
Stanford got involved with the testing re
garding Avian Flu last fall and received federal
funding from the NIH, said Cornelia Dekker, a
doctor in Stanford's Pediatrics Department
heading the study.
"Stanford has had a long interest in influen
za vaccines," Dekker said. "When we heard
about the Bird Flu studies we asked if we could
participate."
Stanford will test the vaccine on people be
tween the ages of 18 and 64.
"Predominantly older adults have volun
teered rather than students," clinical research
coordinator Sally Mackey said in an interview
with The Daily. "But we have had several stu
dents express interest."
So far the virus has spread from birds to peo
ple,"but it's possible that it could become a per
son-to-pcrson transmission" Mackey warns.
"We'd like to be able to test it on people in case
that happens. Furthermore, if you're trying to
prevent the illness in humans, then you have to
test it on humans."
According to Dekker. uncertainties remain
through the vaccines current, first phase of test
ing. However, because the Bird Flu vaccine and
standard yearly flu shots involve the same man
ufacturing processes, Dekker sees this human
test trial as having relatively low risk levels.
" There are always risks when you're testing
something for the first time." she said."but the
vaccine has been made using the same manu
facturing process that is used to make our fall
flu vaccine. We think, therefore, that the risks
should be very similar for the risks described
for the regular fall flu vaccine. But until we test
it on humans we can't say that for sure. Part of
