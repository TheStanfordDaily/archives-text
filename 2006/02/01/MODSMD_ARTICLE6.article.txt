## Stanford to test Bird Flu vaccine Researchers asking for human volunteers to take part 
### STEPHANIE FAGLIANO STAFF WRITER 
Whenever a new strain of influenza emerges,
the current vaccines are rendered largely inef
fective and a flu pandemic can occur.
Chiron, a multi-dimensional biotech compa
ny. plans to conduct vaccine clinical trials at sev
eral facilities, including Stanford, to avert such
crises.The company initially started working on
a vaccine for Avian Flu soon after the virus' out
break in Hong Kong first affected humans in
1997.Hie National Institute of Health,or NIH,
formed a contract with Chiron to manufacture
the vaccine so they could test it at top-notch fa
cilities like the University.
Today, the risk of an Avian Influenza, com
monly known as the Bird Flu, pandemic is real.
Since 2(X)3. the number of humans who have
contracted the Bird Flu has been growing. Cases
have been reported in Thailand. Vietnam, Cam
bodia. Indonesia and'llirkey.and more than half
of the people who have been infected with the
virus have died.
Exposure to infected poultry is believed to
be the cause of each of these cases, but there is
concern that that the Bird Flu will evolve into a
virus capable of human-to-human transmission.
Stanford got involved with the testing re
garding Avian Flu last fall and received federal
funding from the NIH, said Cornelia Dekker, a
doctor in Stanford's Pediatrics Department
heading the study.
"Stanford has had a long interest in influen
za vaccines," Dekker said. "When we heard
about the Bird Flu studies we asked if we could
participate."
Stanford will test the vaccine on people be
tween the ages of 18 and 64.
"Predominantly older adults have volun
teered rather than students," clinical research
coordinator Sally Mackey said in an interview
with The Daily. "But we have had several stu
dents express interest."
So far the virus has spread from birds to peo
ple,"but it's possible that it could become a per
son-to-pcrson transmission" Mackey warns.
"We'd like to be able to test it on people in case
that happens. Furthermore, if you're trying to
prevent the illness in humans, then you have to
test it on humans."
According to Dekker. uncertainties remain
through the vaccines current, first phase of test
ing. However, because the Bird Flu vaccine and
standard yearly flu shots involve the same man
ufacturing processes, Dekker sees this human
test trial as having relatively low risk levels.
" There are always risks when you're testing
something for the first time." she said."but the
vaccine has been made using the same manu
facturing process that is used to make our fall
flu vaccine. We think, therefore, that the risks
should be very similar for the risks described
for the regular fall flu vaccine. But until we test
it on humans we can't say that for sure. Part of
this first testing is to assess those
risks."
The human participants are vol
unteers. They are given $30 and a
parking voucher for travel costs, but
that is considered to be reimburse
ment, not payment.
So why take the time and poten
tial risk to participate in the testing?
"The best reason for volunteer
ing for a study of a phase one vac
cine," Dekker said, "is to really help
scientists learn how the vaccine

works."
Trying to predict whether or not
the virus will spread to humans is "a
little bit of a crystal ball," Dekker
said. "While we know that the virus
is mutating all the time we don't
know if this particular strain is going
to develop that mutation that will
allow it to go person to person. We
really can't say."
Still, the development of the vac
cine is an important preventative
measure in case the virus does
spread.
"If we have to turn to vaccines to
protect a population we would want
to be able to offer that vaccine to as
many people as possible," Dekker
explained. "If the vaccine is more

potent, we can use less on each per
son and would have more vaccine to
give to more people."
Stanford is testing to develop the
vaccine at this potent level.
"The first goal of this testing is to
identify the best dose combination,"
Dekker said. "After this trial would
be finished it would be important to
test the chosen combination in other
populations not included in this
study. We're testing healthy people
between the ages of 18 to 64. But we
would also want to be able to test the
elderly and children.
We know from studies that the
very youngest have the highest rate
of hospitalization from regular in
fluenza, and we have always target-

Ed the elderly for regular vaccina
tion in the fall."
Stanford cannot begin testing
until it receives the vaccine from the
NIH. It will be coming from Eng
land. and uncertainty exists as to
when testing will begin, though it is
slated for the end of February. In the
meantime volunteers are leaving
contact information and will be
called once testing begins.
"The goal of developing this vac
cine would be to have something
available to help everyone," Dekker
said. "We won't get there with just
this one trial, but the big picture here
is that we'd like to have something
available to protect our population
in case we need it."

bodia. Indonesia and'llirkey.and more than half
of the people who have been infected with the
virus have died.
Exposure to infected poultry is believed to
be the cause of each of these cases, but there is
concern that that the Bird Flu will evolve into a
virus capable of human-to-human transmission.
Stanford got involved with the testing re
garding Avian Flu last fall and received federal
funding from the NIH, said Cornelia Dekker, a
doctor in Stanford's Pediatrics Department
heading the study.
"Stanford has had a long interest in influen
za vaccines," Dekker said. "When we heard
about the Bird Flu studies we asked if we could
participate."
Stanford will test the vaccine on people be
tween the ages of 18 and 64.
"Predominantly older adults have volun
teered rather than students," clinical research
coordinator Sally Mackey said in an interview
with The Daily. "But we have had several stu
dents express interest."
So far the virus has spread from birds to peo
ple,"but it's possible that it could become a per
son-to-pcrson transmission" Mackey warns.
"We'd like to be able to test it on people in case
that happens. Furthermore, if you're trying to
prevent the illness in humans, then you have to
test it on humans."
According to Dekker. uncertainties remain
through the vaccines current, first phase of test
ing. However, because the Bird Flu vaccine and
standard yearly flu shots involve the same man
ufacturing processes, Dekker sees this human
test trial as having relatively low risk levels.
" There are always risks when you're testing
something for the first time." she said."but the
vaccine has been made using the same manu
facturing process that is used to make our fall
flu vaccine. We think, therefore, that the risks
should be very similar for the risks described
for the regular fall flu vaccine. But until we test
it on humans we can't say that for sure. Part of
this first testing is to assess those
risks."
The human participants are vol
unteers. They are given $30 and a
parking voucher for travel costs, but
that is considered to be reimburse
ment, not payment.
So why take the time and poten
tial risk to participate in the testing?
"The best reason for volunteer
ing for a study of a phase one vac
cine," Dekker said, "is to really help
scientists learn how the vaccine

works."
Trying to predict whether or not
the virus will spread to humans is "a
little bit of a crystal ball," Dekker
said. "While we know that the virus
is mutating all the time we don't
know if this particular strain is going
to develop that mutation that will
allow it to go person to person. We
really can't say."
Still, the development of the vac
cine is an important preventative
measure in case the virus does
spread.
"If we have to turn to vaccines to
protect a population we would want
to be able to offer that vaccine to as
many people as possible," Dekker
explained. "If the vaccine is more

potent, we can use less on each per
son and would have more vaccine to
give to more people."
Stanford is testing to develop the
vaccine at this potent level.
"The first goal of this testing is to
identify the best dose combination,"
Dekker said. "After this trial would
be finished it would be important to
test the chosen combination in other
populations not included in this
study. We're testing healthy people
between the ages of 18 to 64. But we
would also want to be able to test the
elderly and children.
We know from studies that the
very youngest have the highest rate
of hospitalization from regular in
fluenza, and we have always target-

Ed the elderly for regular vaccina
tion in the fall."
Stanford cannot begin testing
until it receives the vaccine from the
NIH. It will be coming from Eng
land. and uncertainty exists as to
when testing will begin, though it is
slated for the end of February. In the
meantime volunteers are leaving
contact information and will be
called once testing begins.
"The goal of developing this vac
cine would be to have something
available to help everyone," Dekker
said. "We won't get there with just
this one trial, but the big picture here
is that we'd like to have something
available to protect our population
in case we need it."
