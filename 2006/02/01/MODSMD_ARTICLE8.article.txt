## Get On the BUS... Students teach science to East Palo Alto children 
### MARISSA KLEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After spending countless hours poring over re
search, it may be easy for the average graduate
student to forget what first sparked his or her
interest in science. But seeing a child's face light
up as he or she discovers the intricacies of the universe
may inspire this appreciation anew. This is just one of the
rewards of Science Bus, an after school science enrich
ment program for students of the East Palo Alto Charter
School (EPACS) that Stanford students run.
There are about 30 volunteers, most of whom are grad
uate students. Twice a week, half the group visits EPACS
to mentor elementary and middle school students who are
interested in science. Stanford volunteers conduct experi
ments and demonstrations to illustrate concepts and then
work with EPACS students one-on-one or in small groups
for about an hour.
All of the EPACS students who participate in Science
Bus do so voluntarily because they are interested in sci
ence, but the Stanford students who volunteer don't
need to be science specialists, or even science majors.
Group members emphasize that one simply needs to be
enthusiastic.
"Stanford students should get involved if they appreci
ate the look of wonder and curiosity on a child's face as he
or she marvels at the mysteries of science," says Paul San-
Giorgio. a fifth-year physics graduate student.
Getting to know the students and encouraging them to
look at the world in ways they may not have considered
are highlights for many of the program's volunteers. By
taking science out of dry textbooks and exploring it
through creative projects, one of the goals of Science Bus
is to inspire students.
"I hope that they find that science is a useful and fun
endeavor that everyone — including themselves — can
practice on a daily basis and that they can spend time with
some real-life scientists and discover that studying science
in college is an attainable goal for themselves," says Ross
Venook, a sixth-year electrical engineering graduate stu
dent who serves as the group's secretary and membership
coordinator.
The group's specific programs change each quarter,
and the focus of winter quarter is the Science Olympics, an
annual event for fifth through eighth graders.
"The kids spend all quarter working on projects —
egg drop devices, popsicle stick bridges, balloon-powered
cars, etc. — which they bring to Stanford for a one-day
competition, barbecue and all-around great time," says
Kai-Mei Fu, a fifth-year applied physics graduate student
who serves as the group's president and program coordi
nator.
During the summer and fall. Science Bus program
ming focuses on thematic lessons on such topics as light,
the solar system and the science of sports. In the spring,
volunteers will concentrate on helping the students pre
pare projects for an annual science fair. TTie EPACS stu
dents who participate in the program are enthusiastic
about whatever they learn, especially since they do not
necessarily have science classes in school every day or
every quarter.
"I"his program is special because of the kids,"SanGior
gio says. "Since this is a volunteer after school activity, this
means that all of the kids we work with are eager to learn
and curious about science."
EPACS is located in a low-income area. According San-

Giorgio, virtually all the
students participate in

free or reduced
price lunch pro
grams, and
nearly 70 per
cent of students

do not speak English at home.
"Many of them have no idea what a scientist is or
what one does before they come to Science Bus," San-
Giorgio says. "The first time you hear one of the kids say,
'I want to be a scientist when 1 grow up' is something you
never forget."
While the EPACS students explore new ideas they may
have never considered, some Stanford volunteers say the
experience enriches their lives. For one thing, Stanford
students may be reminded of the spark of curiosity and ex
citement that first interested them in science — some
thing that many graduate students may forget while toil
ing in a lab.

"[Science Bus] challenges me to constant

ly re-examine and re-establish my own
relationship with science and with

education, to view the fun
damentals of the discipline
from different perspec
tives and to spend time in

the playful mind of a
younger self," Venook
says. "It's nice to spend
one to two hours each

week outside of my
lab just playing at
science with the
kids. Their enthu
siasm is conta
gious and refresh
ing."

like to get involved with Science
Bus hut cannot make a weekly
commitment, there are also
one-time volunteer opportuni
ties each quarter such as testing

Science Olympics projects at
the end of this quarter or
judging the science fair in

spring.
"I feel like I'm giving
an opportunity to a kid
that might not get it
otherwise," Fu says, en
couraging other Stan
ford students to get in
volved. "[Science Bus]
is a fun, low time corn

mitment and an excuse to play for an hour and to maybe
make a difference is some kid's life."

need to be science specialists, or even science majors.
Group members emphasize that one simply needs to be
enthusiastic.
"Stanford students should get involved if they appreci
ate the look of wonder and curiosity on a child's face as he
or she marvels at the mysteries of science," says Paul San-
Giorgio. a fifth-year physics graduate student.
Getting to know the students and encouraging them to
look at the world in ways they may not have considered
are highlights for many of the program's volunteers. By
taking science out of dry textbooks and exploring it
through creative projects, one of the goals of Science Bus
is to inspire students.
"I hope that they find that science is a useful and fun
endeavor that everyone — including themselves — can
practice on a daily basis and that they can spend time with
some real-life scientists and discover that studying science
in college is an attainable goal for themselves," says Ross
Venook, a sixth-year electrical engineering graduate stu
dent who serves as the group's secretary and membership
coordinator.
The group's specific programs change each quarter,
and the focus of winter quarter is the Science Olympics, an
annual event for fifth through eighth graders.
"The kids spend all quarter working on projects —
egg drop devices, popsicle stick bridges, balloon-powered
cars, etc. — which they bring to Stanford for a one-day
competition, barbecue and all-around great time," says
Kai-Mei Fu, a fifth-year applied physics graduate student
who serves as the group's president and program coordi
nator.
During the summer and fall. Science Bus program
ming focuses on thematic lessons on such topics as light,
the solar system and the science of sports. In the spring,
volunteers will concentrate on helping the students pre
pare projects for an annual science fair. TTie EPACS stu
dents who participate in the program are enthusiastic
about whatever they learn, especially since they do not
necessarily have science classes in school every day or
every quarter.
"I"his program is special because of the kids,"SanGior
gio says. "Since this is a volunteer after school activity, this
means that all of the kids we work with are eager to learn
and curious about science."
EPACS is located in a low-income area. According San-

Giorgio, virtually all the
students participate in

free or reduced
price lunch pro
grams, and
nearly 70 per
cent of students

do not speak English at home.
"Many of them have no idea what a scientist is or
what one does before they come to Science Bus," San-
Giorgio says. "The first time you hear one of the kids say,
'I want to be a scientist when 1 grow up' is something you
never forget."
While the EPACS students explore new ideas they may
have never considered, some Stanford volunteers say the
experience enriches their lives. For one thing, Stanford
students may be reminded of the spark of curiosity and ex
citement that first interested them in science — some
thing that many graduate students may forget while toil
ing in a lab.

"[Science Bus] challenges me to constant

ly re-examine and re-establish my own
relationship with science and with

education, to view the fun
damentals of the discipline
from different perspec
tives and to spend time in

the playful mind of a
younger self," Venook
says. "It's nice to spend
one to two hours each

week outside of my
lab just playing at
science with the
kids. Their enthu
siasm is conta
gious and refresh
ing."

If you're interested
in getting involved
with the group, sub
scribe to science

hus@lists.stanford.edu and

contact SanGiorgio at psan
gior@stanford.edu. If you would
like to get involved with Science
Bus hut cannot make a weekly
commitment, there are also
one-time volunteer opportuni
ties each quarter such as testing

Science Olympics projects at
the end of this quarter or
judging the science fair in

spring.
"I feel like I'm giving
an opportunity to a kid
that might not get it
otherwise," Fu says, en
couraging other Stan
ford students to get in
volved. "[Science Bus]
is a fun, low time corn

mitment and an excuse to play for an hour and to maybe
make a difference is some kid's life."
