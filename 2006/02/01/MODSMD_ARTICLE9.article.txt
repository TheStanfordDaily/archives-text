# Internet telephony services cheap, convenient
## Skype, others offer after native to traditional phone plans 
### SAM BHAGWAT DESK EDITOR 
Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis might
not be billionaires quite yet, but that doesn't
mean they haven't had quite a run at fame
and fortune. In March 2001, the Dutch com
pany Consumer Empowerment released
their brainchild, a then little-known pro
gram by the name of KaZaa. Nearly 400 mil
lion downloads and a somewhat smaller
number of lawsuits later, KaZaa helped
keep file-sharing widespread after the col
lapse of Napster and made the Danish duo
famous in the geek community.
In August 2003, Zennstrom and Friis re

leased online the first beta version of Skype,
a service using VoIP (Voice Over Internet
Protocol) to send calls from one computer
to another. Over the next year and a half, it
added the ability to send out calls from com
puters to traditional phone numbers, as well
as the ability to call computers from those
phone numbers. Its customer base expand
ed with its features, hitting 10 million users
in October 2004 and 60 million in October
2005. This remarkable growth has not gone
unnoticed — online auctioneer eßay
bought Skype shortly thereafter, to the tune
of a cool $2.6 billion — plus another $1.5
billion conditional on meeting future goals.
Not too shabby.
So, what is Vol P's appeal? As computers
have grown in everyday use, many people,
especially students, find it more efficient to
talk online.

Applications like Skype and Google
Talk, a program enabling voice conversa
tions and instant messaging between users
of Google's Gmail service, are free to down
load. They also have simple, no-frills inter
faces, in contrast to the more bells-and
whistles programs like AOL Instant Mes
senger. But the advantages of VoIP go far
beyond this convenience.
Long-distance and international calls
Skype isn't alone in its field. It faces com
petition from other Internet telephony
services like Vonage and Jajah. For those
who don't get good coverage on Stanford's
campus or use all of their minutes talking to
their friends. Vol P offers a cheap way to call
home. Skype also allows calls to landline
phones anywhere in the United States for

all of 1.7 cents a minute — and is being un
dercut by Jajah which offers them for one
cent a minute. And for international stu
dents, Skype and Jajah both offer calls to the
European Union and China for under 2
cents a minute and to Japan for only slightly
more. Calls elsewhere are slightly more ex
pensive but significantly less than tradition
al calling card rates; for example, calls to
India are 12.5 cents a minute on Skype,com
pared with 90 cents a minute on an AT&T
calling card.
Weaknesses
VoIP does have several downsides,
though. Skype has been in the news recent
ly after an MIT professor noted that its
setup made it conducive to conduct denial
of-service attacks, a useful tool for hackers
to disable other computers unnoticed. Still,
while this poses problems for the general

public, the glitch does not specifically con
cern non-hacker Skype users.
A more serious drawback lies in Skype's
software. By accessing the hard drive multi
ple times per minute, the program prevents
it from entering sleep or idle modes. If users
do not carefully close Skype after each time
they use it, the resulting heat can lead to
shortened hard drive lifespan. It is not
known if other VoIP applications such as
Jajah also have this problem. The solution?
Remember to close the Skype application
after use and turn off its "open on startup"
option.
VoIP is cheap, and while students should
make sure it doesn't overheat their hard
drives, they should consider it as an alterna
tive to other ways of keeping in contact with
those nagging parents. At the least, if you
get bored hearing about the visit to Uncle
Ned for the umpteenth time, you can go surf
the Internet.
