# Defining harassment
## STUDENTS EXPRESS DOUBTS OVER RECENT STUDY "It's not the victim that draws the line, it's the policy" 
### GERRY SHIH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A recent online survey conducted by the Amer
ican Association of University Women (AAUW)
revealed that 62 percent of college students say
they have encountered some type of sexual ha
rassment while at school.
The report concluded that sexual harassment is
widespread on campuses across the country, that it
takes an especially heavy toll on female students,
and that most students do not report the cases.
Critics everywhere have been quick to voice
their doubts about the survey's validity, contend
ing that 62 percent is a questionably high figure.
At Stanford, response to the findings has been
mixed.
Laura Harrison, assistant dean and director of
the Stanford Women's Community Center, said
that while she had no Stanford-specific data the
AAUW's findings, she found the survey's results
believable.
"It's hard to tell," she said. "But just anecdotal
ly, if you define sexual harassment pretty broadly,
that number doesn't necessarily surprise me."
Senior JJ Ross said she would probably believe
the statistic, but noted that "it very much depends
on the definition."
"I think it depends on the person," she said.
"I've definitely seen people of byth genders do
things that I thought was harassment, but neither
of them thought so, or vice versa."
Because it is so difficult to objectively define
and measure sexual harassment, some Stanford
students dismissed the survey's statistics as insub

stantial and meaningless, while simultaneously ac
knowledging such harassment's übiquitous pres
ence on college campuses.
"If a girl considers a guy touching her butt at a
party sexual harassment, then yes. the statistic
sounds believable," said Irina Issakova, a sopho
more. "However, that's stupid, and 1 don't think
most girls would think that."
Other students agreed that the number might
have been too high to be taken seriously.
"It may be too high.but 1 wouldn't be surprised
if it were close," said a female sophomore who
asked that her name be withheld."Some girls over
exaggerate."
Though individuals may define sexual harass
ment differently. Harrison explained that the Uni
versity does try to maintain an objective standard.
"It's not the victim that draws the line, it's the

policy," she said. "But most things that have been
brought to my attention do qualify as sexual ha
rassment."
Harrison went on to define the University's
twofold policy.
"Number one, it has to be unwanted," she said.
"If people are playing around and people are con
senting, it's not sexual harassment. Number two
seems obvious, but it isn't: It has to be sexual in na
ture. For example if it's belligerent but not in a sex
ual nature, it's not sexual harassment."
Though the survey's subjects likely had differ
ent definitions in mind, Issakova said that it is not
that hard to determine rough boundaries.
"I think that there are some girls who would
consider something innocent sexual harassment,"
she said. "Then, there are other girls that wouldn't
consider anything sexual harassment, but the ma
jority of girls are normal about it, so the extremes
average each other out."
Mike Kneupfel, a junior, said he understands
that the lines drawn fluctuate from person to per
son, adding that he was not surprised by the sur
vey's results.
"I think the definition of sexual harassment de
pends on the girl." he said. "But I think in general
they put up with a lot. For some girls, I think they
put up with it on a daily basis, and for guys it may
just be a one or two time kind of thing."
According to the AAUW — reporting that 51
percent of the survey's male participants admitted
to harassing — most men are not as considerate as
Kneupfel.
