## GSC clears up Constitution, eyes fees and funding Students voice concerns over dinner with Hennessy 
### FRANCIE NEUKOM STAFF WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council (GSC)
met last night to discuss the recent graduate
student dinner with University President
John I lennessy and to vote on a new bill con
cerning petitions for special fees as an
amendment to the GSC Constitution.
Natalie Chun, the Council's social sci
ences representative, attended last week's
dinner, held on Jan. 30, and explained thÂ«
three main issues attendees raised with Hen
nessy.
The first. Chun said, was a request for
lower health-insurance payments for inter
national graduate students with spouses who

cannot work. The second was student con
cern over a lack of tuition funding after pass
ing qualification exams. And the final topic
concerned whether or not socioeconomic
status would be taken into consideration
when admitting graduate students in the fu
ture.
On the last issue, Hennessy was very clear.
"Hennessy said that Admissions could
never accept students based on their in
come" Chun said."He told us it would be too
many boxes to check."
Graduate students meet with a senior ad
ministrator each quarter. After this meeting
with Hennessy, they hope to bring Provost
John Etchemendy together with students in
the spring.
The GSC also voted unanimously 12-0-0
to pass a bill pertaining to special fees appli
cations. The bill allows groups qualified for
special fees to petition electronically, and re
quires more information from each group.

The bill also clarified some of the more am
biguous parts of the old Constitution.
"Most of the former clauses in the bylaws
were pretty confusing," said Tom Lee, co
chair of the GSC. "By passing this bill, we
wanted to bring them more up-to-date and
make them more compatible with the way
things work today. We wanted to take advan
tage of the new technology available to us
and make petitioning a more efficient
process for everyone."
The. new information required from
groups applying for additional funding in
cludes their budgets from the previous
year, the proposed budgets for the money
the groups hope to receive this year, the
current group budgets (if available) and
any other funding the groups may receive
from outside businesses or sponsorships.
The GSC members also discussed their
concerns over the large number of student
cultural groups that have recently petitioned

for special fees. One idea raised was for simi
lar cultural groups to meld together to create
an umbrella group that could then pool the
money into a general fund to help groups
host cultural awareness workshops and par
ties.
Some members favored this idea, assert
ing that it would allow cultural groups more
flexibility and more resources for their
events, comparing the proposed plan to the
way Club Sports operates now.
Others, however, said they strongly dis
agreed.
"It's unfair for us to lump similar groups
together, especially if they want to cele
brate events each in their own individual
way," said Stephen Hunt, the representa
tive from the Medical School. "When peo
ple vote on this proposal.it will smack of fa
voritism whichever way they vote."
The GSC decided to discuss the proposal
more thoroughly at a later date.
