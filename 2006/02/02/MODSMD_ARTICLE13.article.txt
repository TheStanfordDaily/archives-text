## County OKs new Munger Residences Construction set to begin by the end of the month 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
The Munger Graduate Residences project,
unanimously approved by the Santa Clara Coun
ty Planning Commission on Jan. 5, will officially
begin construction at the end of the month.
ITie project, made possible by a $43.5 million
gift from investment mogul Charles T. Munger
and his wife Nancy Munger, an alumna, will cre
ate housing for 6(K) graduate students. The five
buildings will total more than 45(),(MX) square-feet
of floor space.
According to the project's Web site, "The resi
dences will offer an array of modern apartments
and communal space to encourage cross-discipli
nary thought, debate and collaboration. The
buildings will be oriented around a pedestrian
plaza and landscaped walkways."
Project Manager Mark Boninosaid that he ex
pects the residences to be completed in 2(X)8.
"Much of the project is still in design," he said.
"Although some permits are being left for the
early construction, [we are] preparing Mariposa,
Serra. Rogers. Owen and Drell [houses] for relo
cation and starting excavation for Parking Struc
ture 6. In addition, a significant number of trees
arc being relocated."
The project includes the construction of a four
level. 1,227-stall parking garage beneath Wilbur
Field and the restoration of the Wilbur parking lot
and residences.
Hie 355 housing units will include studio
apartments as well as one, two and four bedroom
units. Common spaces such as an exercise area, a
great hall and a convenience store are also being
planned.
"The Munger Graduate Residences project will
help alleviate the long-standing problem of pro
viding housing to graduate students who need it,"
says the Web site. "In particular, Stanford has
been unable to meet demand for high-end gradu
ate housing, which is increasingly important in the
recruitment of the best graduate students."
While Law School students will be given first
priority and will likely occupy about one-third of
the units, the residences will house students from
all disciplines. The project aims to create commu
nity space for these students as well expand un
dergraduate housing, as Crothers Hall and
Crothers Memorial will be converted into under
graduate dorms.
Munger's location, which totals six acres near
the center of campus, was selected for its proxim
ity to the Law School â€” which, according to the
Web site,"fulfills the goal of moving graduate stu
dents closer to the core campus in order to en
courage them to take an active role in the univer
sity community [and] provides for a Law School
living and learning' environment."
"The residences will be situated in the Stern and
Law School parking lots and on both sides of Sal
vatierra Walk," said Bonino. "Alvarado Row, be
tween Campus Drive and Galvez Mall, will be
closed, with a new replacement serv
ice road adjacent to Stern 1 fall."
Construction on the parking lots
will displace approximately 450
parking stalls; during construction, a
temporary lot between Stern and
Wilbur will be created to accommo
date up to 108 of these stalls.
fTie project's location has pro
voked opposition from some mem
bers of the Stanford community who
want the space preserved.
John Felstiner, professor of Eng
lish. spoke on behalf of the Con
cerned Members of the Stanford
Community about the proposed
construction site.
"We don't object to dorms being

built," said Felstiner. "It's just that
Stanford has many acres and other
places it could have considered."
Felstiner. a longtime campus resi
dent, went on to suggest less sensitive
locations, such as the Wilbur mod
ules, which are located between the
Wilbur dorms and Campus Drive.
"[The proposed area is] one of the
very few remaining quiet green
spaces on the inner campus," he said.
"It's a tributary, a vein leading into
the center of campus. Hundreds and
hundreds of people take it every sin
gle day."
Project representatives did not re
spond to questions about these con
cerns by press time, but the Web site
makes it clear that the project site
was chosen for its centrality, hoping
to create, "a one-of-a-kind mixed
graduate student community... that
links the main campus to the various
Lower Row residences."
