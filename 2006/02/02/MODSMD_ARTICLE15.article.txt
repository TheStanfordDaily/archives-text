# WE'VE GOT ANSWERS.
## JOBHUNTING WOES? Career Week gives students access to employment opportunities 
### Written By LESLIE GEORGATOS 
I hat do you get
I when you pack over 100
Stanford alumni in com
munications, law, engineering, health

care and other fields into Arrillaga Alumni
Center for a day? The punchline is Saturday's
9:00 A.M.-5:30 P.M. Career Conference, the
culmination of the Career Development Cen
ter's Career Week.
Career Week, which spans Jan. 30 to Feb. 4,
also includes a Networking Workshop, an Eti
quette Dinner, a Liberal Arts Career Fair and
a Public Service Career Fair.
"The purpose of Career Week is to give
students the chance to learn to utilize alumni
in their career planning, explore career op
tions and connect with potential employers,"
says Director Lance Choy of the CDC.
Career Fairs consist of tables for compa
nies and organizations recruiting students for
jobs ranging from internships to full-time po
sitions. Public Service Career Fair partici
pants ranged from the Central Intelligence
Agency to the City of Palo Alto. Liberal Arts
Career Fair organizations included 53 compa
nies like AT&T. Gap, Enterprise Rent-a-Car
and many financial services firms. Detailed
maps with information about participating
groups helped students navigate the fair.
Students approach these fairs with differ
ent purposes. While some leave resumes and
solicit jobs, many simply use the day to gather
information.
"1 usually go online later to get more infor
mation," says senior Lizet Ocampo of the
Public Services Career Fair.
"I went because I wanted information
about one organization and because I wanted
experience in networking at a career fair," says

ju n -
ior Mayuree
Rao. "Although I didn't
meet with many employers, I'm glad I got ex
posure to what a career fair is like."
Freshman Daniel Blocksom finds it hard
to meet a specific interest.
"I wanted to work in state or national pol
itics, and most of the organizations were local
ly based," he says. "But it still helped to know
what's out there."
Other students echoed the complaint that
most participating companies came from the
Bay Area.
Other events provide students with useful
abilities for job searches. At Wednesday's Eti
quette Dinner, professional consultant
Sharyn Amoroso helped 160 students sharp
en etiquette skills.Today's Networking Work
shop will help students learn to ask produc
tive questions when interacting with alumni.
But Saturday's day-long Career Confer
ence is the week's highlight. The event pres
ents a chance for students to interact person
ally with alumni, in keeping with CDC's new
emphasis on the value of alumni connections
for job-seeking students.
"Students often dislike the idea of contact
ing alumni or anyone for informational inter
views," C'hoy says."The CDC hopes students
will be more motivated and feel more at ease
about contacting alumni after this event."
Over 20 panels of alumni in various profes-

sions will be open to all students throughout
the clay. Panelist biographies are available on
line to help students find panels that suit their
interests.
"I hope to get a better idea of what some
long term career paths will look like in dif
ferent fields so that 1 can make a good first
step into the job market," says senior Adam
Harris.
At the Networking Luncheon between
panels,students interact more personally with
alumni. Approximately 300 students have
signed up to sit at specific tables with alumni
in career fields related to their interests. After
dining at a table with one to three alumni and
eight other students, attendees can mingle for
the second half of the luncheon.
"Students do not realize that alumni are a
valuable asset that they can utilize for their
career development," says Choy. "The pro
grams connecting students to alumni are all
part of an effort to educate students about the
value of the alumni community."
