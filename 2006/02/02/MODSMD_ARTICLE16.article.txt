It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that the
Cantor Center for the Visual Arts is the cultural epicen
ter of campus. Home to thousands of paintings, sculp
tures and other objects, Cantor provides valuable expe
riences for all its visitors.
On Wednesday, a new exhibition, entitled American
ABC: Childhood in 19th Century America, opened at
Cantor. The exhibition is composed of artwork that re
flects the childhood experience in 19th century Ameri
ca. featuring the work of such artists as Thomas Eakins.
William Harnett. Winslow Homer and Jacob Riis.
Lauren Silver, associate curator for education, says
the purpose of the exhibition is "to explore issues of
national identity using paintings, prints, photographs
and books."
During an era when the Founding Fathers and their
idealistic visions were threatening to decline,"images of
children were portrayed as the hope for democracy,"
says Silver. "There were parallels drawn between a child
and the nation in its formative years."
The exhibition does not only feature the idealistic
image of children and how they should act. Rather, the
exhibition is divided into six sections and addresses a
wide variety of issues of the time period.
While the sections "The Country Boy" and "Daugh
ters of Liberty" concern young boys and girls and their
roles in the future of American democracy. "Children of
Bondage.""Ragamuffin." and"The Papoose" deal with

slavery, urbanization, and the circumstances of Native
Americans, respectively.
Silver explains that "embodying these issues in im
ages of children brought them to a non-threatening
level."
The last section. "The New Scholar," explores the
19th century's new focus on public education.
"It was a way of unifying and finding common
ground to offset the explosion of diversity of the time,"
Silver says.
In addition, the exhibition also includes a hands-on
classroom, with books, toys, chalkboards and more,
where visitors can experience what the classroom was
like during the time period.The hands-on classroom will
also feature live portrayals of famous historical and lit
erary people of the time. For example, Frederick Dou
glass and Mark Twain are both scheduled to perform.
Though children and families may appreciate the
classroom the most, the exhibition is intended for a
much greater audience than just young children.
According to the learning goals that were expressed
in the exhibition's proposal. Cantor is trying to reach
two kinds of people — within the Stanford community,
students and faculty in American Studies, and in the
broad public, all people interested in their social and cul
tural heritage.
In addition to these things, the exhibition reflects
"the ways in which we can take a historical approach to
issues, such as gender roles and cultural diversity, which
are very much still issues today," Silver says."The exhi
bition gives us a historical as well as contemporary per

spective."
Several students praise the value ol'Cantor as an on
campus center of learning.
"It's a really good resource, for both education and
pleasure and very accessible to us" says freshman Jun
Jiang.
The process of bringing together such an exhibition is
a "long and involved one," according to Silver. "The cu
rator Claire Perry has spent at least six to seven years
working on it."
Exhibitions often are developing with curators brain
storming ideas and then explaining to others why partic
ular exhibitions would be valuable,says Silver. Once the
idea is refined and proposed, the steps necessary to as
semble objects and paintings begin.
Silver emphasizes the great number of logistical de
tails and responsibilities that come with borrowing
works from other museums. Often, there are require
ments — concerning lighting and security, for example
— that must be fulfilled.
In the end, all efforts prove to be worthwhile when
the finished exhibition opens for the public to view. In
particular. Cantor encourages students to attend its First
Thursday Program on Feb. 2 at Cantor at 7:30 P.M. In
addition to viewing the exhibition, students can also
enjoy free food and the performance of the Spoken
Word Collective at 8:15 P.M.
This exhibition cannot stay at Cantor forever. Next, it
will travel to the Smithsonian Museum in Washington,
D.C. and then to the Portland Art Museum in Maine.
So hurry in!
