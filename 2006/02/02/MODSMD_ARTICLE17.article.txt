## Editorial No more Wednesday Sophomore Formals 
### 
Many members of the sophomore
class attended last night's annual
Sophomore Formal, held in the Ar
rillaga Alumni Center, but many others had
to stay home to study for their upcoming
midterms — most notably this morning's Bi
ology 42 exam.
The decision to hold Sophomore Formal
on a Wednesday this year came as a disap
pointment to many students who couldn't
afford to take a break from their studies in
the middle of midterm season, let alone on a
weekday.
As one of the few events that break the
monotony of the sophomore slump. Sopho
more Formal should not have been sched
uled on a Wednesday in the fourth week of
the quarter. Class presidents have a tough job
scheduling any event like this, but there are a
few concrete steps that these and future pres
idents can take to avoid such a problem.
Plans to hold Sophomore Formal during
fall quarter fell through due to extenuating
circumstances. Consequently, the sopho
more class presidents consulted with previ
ous class officers and decided that the formal
should be held as early as possible. At first,
January 13 was considered a possible date,
but that date conflicted with certain dorms'
ski trips and was ruled out as a possibility.
The sophomore class presidents also con
sidered holding the event off-campus, but all
venues were either too expensive or unwilling
to host college students. By the time the
Alumni Center was chosen as the venue,
weekends at the Alumni Center were booked
for the rest of the quarter. Because the only
days available for winter quarter were Mon

days and Wednesdays, the class presidents
settled on the earliest possible Wednesday so
as to avoid as many midterms as possible —
but still managing to hit quite a few.
Scheduling Sophomore Formal in the
middle of winter quarter was unfortunate,
but not unavoidable. The Alumni Center's
busy schedule should not have come as a sur
prise, since the center is one of the few places
on campus that can accommodate large
scale formal events. Most of the necessary
planning should have begun months in ad
vance, well before the start of winter quarter.
While this may prove difficult as class offi
cers change every year, class presidents are
elected in the spring and should begin plan
ning the event before the beginning of sum
mer — even if this planning amounts to just
setting a date and booking a venue.
Future class presidents should be aware
of the many obstacles of planning a formal,
such as overbooked or expensive venues and
Stanford students' many conflicting activi
ties. They should take care to book a date at
the Alumni Center, or any other venue of
their choice, during spring quarter of the
previous academic year or the beginning of
fall quarter, at the very latest.
Future presidents should also attempt to
pick a week with as few conflicting midterms
or finals as possible, such as the third week of
either fall or winter quarter. Finally, sopho
more class presidents should set the date of
the formal for the same quarter each year —
much like the Freshman Formal, which is al
ways in the fall, or the Senior Formal in the
spring — making the decision easier for fu
ture class officers.
