With all this talk of coke lately, I'll be
honest: I feel a little left out. This
may surprise you, but despite my
New York upbringing and prep school pedi
gree, I have improbably managed to miss
every chance to try it.
While I was gone this summer, all my
friends in Brooklyn were doing it. 1 wanted
to join a frat, but my drawmates didn't want
to.
There was the time I was taking a piss in a
single-occupancy bathroom at a bar in New
York and a youth — probably an NYU film
student — barged in.
"Oh, sorry," he offered, before pulling out
a coke spoon. It's cool, but next time, offer
me some of that blow, guy.
I nearly went to Yale, where the streets
are paved with gold — Colombian gold, that
is. New Haven is for cokeheads what
Georgetown is for politicos and Princeton is
for assholes. Don't believe me? Look no fur
ther than the movie "American Psycho":
Patrick Bateman: He was into that whole
Yale thing.
Donald Kimball: Yale thing?
Bateman: Yeah, Yale thing.
Kimball: What whole Yale thing?
Bateman: Well, he was probably a closet
homosexual who did a lot of cocaine.
Then there was the 6 a.m. walk back to
our hostel in Madrid when my friends and 1
spotted some gentlemen hanging around in
an alley.
"Ha, I bet they're doing coke," I quipped,
continuing the long-running joke of the
quarter that we would have been cokeheads
had we gone to Yale. Then we walked past
and they were doing lines off an upturned
barrel.
Of course. I'm kidding about wanting to
do coke, if only for the fact that it is bad for
your gums, increases the risk of heart attack
and is pretty expensive. Oh, and it's very ille
gal. Alas, like most great pharmaceutical dis
coveries, the government banned cocaine as
soon as they figured out how cool it was.
But the squares haven't stopped some of
the great minds of Western civilization from
partaking. Important figures like Culture
Club frontman Boy George, former Wash
ington D.C. mayor Marion Barry and Pope
Leo XIII have used the drug. Who else but
someone under the magical influence of co
caine could have produced the hit track
"Karma Chameleon?"
Surely we owe the coca leaf the same re
spect we afford inspirational substances like
coffee and Ritalin. Some scholars even con
tend that Thomas Edison was misquoted,
and that he actually opined, "Genius is one
percent inspiration and 99 percent a hol
lowed-out Bic pen and blow I picked up in
East Menlo Park."
And something about cocaine captivates
our imaginations in ways that other drugs
don't. Movies and television continuously
portray it in a comical light, whether it is
"Family Guy's" Brian getting addicted to
blow or Doogie Howser doing lines off a
stripper's ass in a speeding car in "Harold
and Kumar Go to White Castle." I can't

imagine a TV show using a laugh track to
someone shooting up or smoking PCP. And
cocaine has retained its reputation as a
classy drug — and rightfully so, since Kate
Moss doing a line off a mirror looks a lot hot
ter than Marlon Wayans fumbling with a
spoon and lighter.These two factors have led
to the drug's resurgence in recent years, es
pecially among college students and young
adults.
And yet, all jokes aside, there isn't a lot to
laugh about. Cocaine has taken a lot of
promising lives, from funnymen Chris Farley
and John Belushi, rapper 0.D.8. and rockers
Bobby Hatfield and John Entwhistle. And
the drug has caused the deaths of countless
innocent bystanders, ripped apart families
and led to the exploitation and oppression of
millions of Latin Americans caught up in its
production.
Basically, coke is bad. Girls, if you want to
lose weight, take Fen-Pfen. Guys, if you want
to feel good about yourself, trim — it makes
it look bigger. You don't need drugs to
change your life. All you need is your mind.
See you at Pub Night.
