other series against the Oregon schools. And
this time, they will have something else to
prove.
Stanford (12-7,6-3 Pac-10) takes on Ore
gon (10-11,4-5) today in Eugene.The Cardi
nal's ability to win on the road — where
they are 1 -5 so far — will be put to the test at
Mac Arthur Court. The arena is notoriously
difficult to play in for a variety of reasons,
ranging from a loud student section to dark
lighting to its history and 'mystique,' de
pending on whom you ask.
Whatever the reason, it's working for the
Ducks; the team is 9-4 at Mac Arthur so far,
despite being swept at home last weekend
by UCLA and Southern California. They
are only 1-7 away from Mac Arthur.
"We're ready for Mac Arthur Court,"
Stanford head coach Trent Johnson said.
"It's not the fans that beat you. It's the five
guys on the court that beat you. We have to
be tough-minded and find a way to win on
the road."
Though it's thought to be one of the most
difficult Pac-10 arenas to play in, that has
not necessarily been the case for the Cardi
nal, who have won seven of the last nine
games they have played at Mac Arthur. Se
nior center Matt Haryasz, the answer to
most of the team's problems over the past
two weekends, has played particularly well
there throughout his career. He dropped 19
points there in his first start in a Stanford
uniform two years ago, then returned last
year to score 18 and hit the game-winning
jumper.
"The Pit Crew [Oregon's student section]
rides me a lot personally, and that makes it
fun. I'm really excited to play there,"
Haryasz said.
He scored 16 points in the teams' only
meeting this season and led a comeback in
the final four minutes to give Stanford a 64-
62 win. But he said that the Oregon big men

will be ready for him.
"They were pretty physical last
time," Harvas/ said. "I remember
having a guy leaning on me every
minute of the game."
Oregon will likely send a rotation
of forwards to guard Haryasz,
though the principal duties should
fall to Maarty Leunen, who leads the
team with 6.7 rebounds per game.
But any conversation about the
Ducks begins in their backcourt, with
sophomore Malik Hairston and jun
ior Aaron Brooks. Hairston. a high
flying, smooth-shooting wing, leads
the team with 14.4 points per game.
Point guard Brooks is a close second
with 11.4, and also paces the squad
with 4.8 assists per contest.
Ihe Cardinal's comeback victory
over Oregon early in the season gave
the team confidence that it could
tough out close wins. But the team's
recent run has surprised even its own
coach. Haryasz said that he remem
bered Johnson watching a game be
tween Washington and Gonzaga im
mediately after Stanford lost to Divi
sion II UC-Davis, wondering aloud

TRENT JOHNSON

how the Cardinal were ever going to
beat teams like that.
But Johnson didn't blame his
players for the team's sluggish start.
"One of the reasons we struggled
early in the year was probably be
cause of the guy who's coaching
them," he said. "I point the blame at
myself."
Interestingly enough, Stanford so
far seems to have followed the trajec
tory that it was on last year. That
team went 6-7 in its first 13 games be
fore winning its next six to compile
the exact same overall and confer
ence record as this year's squad at
this point in the season.

after senior guard Dan Grunfeld had

eight roster players to work with.
This club hopes to avoid a similar
fate.'llle key may be in the continued
improvement of two freshmen who
have seen increased playing time in
the last few games — guard Mitch
Johnson and forward Lawrence Hill.
"Lawrence has never seen a shot

that while Hill's performance has

Stanford (12-7,6-3 Pac-10) takes on Ore
gon (10-11,4-5) today in Eugene.The Cardi
nal's ability to win on the road — where
they are 1 -5 so far — will be put to the test at
Mac Arthur Court. The arena is notoriously
difficult to play in for a variety of reasons,
ranging from a loud student section to dark
lighting to its history and 'mystique,' de
pending on whom you ask.
Whatever the reason, it's working for the
Ducks; the team is 9-4 at Mac Arthur so far,
despite being swept at home last weekend
by UCLA and Southern California. They
are only 1-7 away from Mac Arthur.
"We're ready for Mac Arthur Court,"
Stanford head coach Trent Johnson said.
"It's not the fans that beat you. It's the five
guys on the court that beat you. We have to
be tough-minded and find a way to win on
the road."
Though it's thought to be one of the most
difficult Pac-10 arenas to play in, that has
not necessarily been the case for the Cardi
nal, who have won seven of the last nine
games they have played at Mac Arthur. Se
nior center Matt Haryasz, the answer to
most of the team's problems over the past
two weekends, has played particularly well
there throughout his career. He dropped 19
points there in his first start in a Stanford
uniform two years ago, then returned last
year to score 18 and hit the game-winning
jumper.
"The Pit Crew [Oregon's student section]
rides me a lot personally, and that makes it
fun. I'm really excited to play there,"
Haryasz said.
He scored 16 points in the teams' only
meeting this season and led a comeback in
the final four minutes to give Stanford a 64-
62 win. But he said that the Oregon big men

will be ready for him.
"They were pretty physical last
time," Harvas/ said. "I remember
having a guy leaning on me every
minute of the game."
Oregon will likely send a rotation
of forwards to guard Haryasz,
though the principal duties should
fall to Maarty Leunen, who leads the
team with 6.7 rebounds per game.
But any conversation about the
Ducks begins in their backcourt, with
sophomore Malik Hairston and jun
ior Aaron Brooks. Hairston. a high
flying, smooth-shooting wing, leads
the team with 14.4 points per game.
Point guard Brooks is a close second
with 11.4, and also paces the squad
with 4.8 assists per contest.
Ihe Cardinal's comeback victory
over Oregon early in the season gave
the team confidence that it could
tough out close wins. But the team's
recent run has surprised even its own
coach. Haryasz said that he remem
bered Johnson watching a game be
tween Washington and Gonzaga im
mediately after Stanford lost to Divi
sion II UC-Davis, wondering aloud

TRENT JOHNSON

how the Cardinal were ever going to
beat teams like that.
But Johnson didn't blame his
players for the team's sluggish start.
"One of the reasons we struggled
early in the year was probably be
cause of the guy who's coaching
them," he said. "I point the blame at
myself."
Interestingly enough, Stanford so
far seems to have followed the trajec
tory that it was on last year. That
team went 6-7 in its first 13 games be
fore winning its next six to compile
the exact same overall and confer
ence record as this year's squad at
this point in the season.

Perhaps Stanford has a momentum edge, but the stats appear fairly similar for the three schools

But the Cardinal tailed oil last
year, finishing the season on another
6-7 slide. Most of that stretch came
after senior guard Dan Grunfeld had
torn his ACL, giving Stanford only
eight roster players to work with.
This club hopes to avoid a similar
fate.'llle key may be in the continued
improvement of two freshmen who
have seen increased playing time in
the last few games — guard Mitch
Johnson and forward Lawrence Hill.
"Lawrence has never seen a shot
he didn't like," Johnson said with a
smile. "He doesn't lack confidence to
make plays." Johnson later added
that while Hill's performance has

been a bit of a surprise, he always ex
pected Mitch Johnson to plav at a
high level, though the guard was
sidetracked by an injury in July.
Mitch Johnson took over redshirt
sophomore Tim Morris' starting
guard spot one game before the Car
dinal's recent streak and has been a
solid contributor since then, often
running the team from the point
guard position while senior guard
Chris Hernandez slides over to the
wing. Over the last seven games, he is
averaging 27.minutes, six points
and 4.7 assists per contest, a category
in which he recently surpassed Her

junior forward Taj Finger, whom
Johnson likes in the starting role be

tensity he provides. I lill has averaged
23.7 minutes per game during the
Cardinal's run, scoring eight points
