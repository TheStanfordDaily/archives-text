# Philosophy for social anxiety
## 
### 
There I was, doing what I shouldn't have
done. When the music quieted in a room
of dancers for a brief moment, I said, "So
you did not choose to go back to FroSoCo?" to
my interlocutor, who was a dark, graceful and
feminine creature with oceanic blue eyes that
must have drowned many.
"No, I did n0t..."
And a silence settled like a fog that over
takes a crimson mountain and cleaves it out of
existence.
There are moments that suck. Then there
are those moments that bewilder you so much
that you can't tell whether the moment sucks
or not. Is it possible to be confused so much
that all thinking stops? Any inkling of
thought.any attempt to reason,is resisted with
doubt and fear. A conscious slumber occupies
one's mind like a fog.
This was one of those wounding moments.
And I am going to cauterize it with philos
ophy.
In philosophy, determinism is the idea that
all events of the future are determined by the
state of the past together with natural laws.
The idea gained prominence with the advent
of Newtonian physics and the increasing abil
ity of science to explain more and more phe
nomena. Determinism assumes that humans
don't posses an immaterial soul. Hence the
same laws that govern billiard balls govern
human beings.
Determinism has traditionally posed prob
lems concerning moral responsibility. If what
I am going to do is determined by the current
state of the world, how can I be morally re
sponsible for any of my actions? Another wor
risome aspect of determinism is that it seems
to take away all our humanity. If I am just a
bunch of atoms colliding, am I really a person?
Aren't all my thoughts a product of nature
and therefore "I" simply non-existent?

For now, forget about the last bits.
Believe in determinism. Let it be the anti
dote to all your social ills.
All your awkward silences and all your
anxiety — let nature be responsible for it, not
you! Drain the springs that animate your life,
believe in determinism. Forget about the fu
ture. Forget about the past. For 10 minutes, be
lieve in determinism. Climb to the zenith of
your existence and jump off it.
Believe in determinism. All your past, all
the painful memories — I say believe in de
terminism. Change the lyrics to the Radio
head song "Blackstar" and sing: Blame it on
determinism, blame it on the falling sky, blame
it on the satellite that beams me home.
However, soon everything is going to tum
ble, for determinism is not as sturdy an anti
dote as we thought it was. Consider the follow
ing thought experiment, adopted from Prince
ton philosopher Harry Frankfurt.
Suppose Jennifer Connelly wants to kill
me. (She does "kill" me quite frequently. Have
you seen "House of Sand and Fog?") And also
suppose that Amy Hempel also wants me
killed but she is not willing to do it on her own.
Amy inserts diodes into Jennifer's brain. If
Jennifer hesitates in the act of murder, Amy
can press the button on her electronic trans
mitter and activate the diodes on Jennifer's
brain. The diodes compel Jennifer to murder
me no matter what. Jennifer goes on to kill me

(I told you that she "killed" me) without
Amy's ever needing to activate the diodes.
Now, Jennifer could not have done otherwise
but does that save her from moral responsibil
ity? I tend to think not.
Once I realized that Jennifer Connelly (in
Harry Frankfurt's argument) makes a good
case for the claim that determinism is com
patible with all my awkward silences, I start
ed looking for other scapegoats. Consider
moral luck.
Moral luck is the claim that moral respon
sibility depends not only on the factors that
are under the moral agent's control but also
on factors that depend on chance.
Consider another thought experiment:
T\vo murderers willingly shoot at victims. One
kills his victim. The other misses because his
victim accidentally bends forward during
shooting. Law and our moral intuition assign
more moral burden to the former case. Both
murderers acted the same with respect to the
factors they can control, yet one of them gets
more blame.
So, I say, believe in moral luck. All your
awkward silences, all your anxiety... All the
painful memories... Believe in moral luck.
Climb to the zenith of your existence and
jump off it. Believe in moral luck. Change the
lyrics to the Radiohead song "Blackstar" and
sing: Blame it on the moral luck, blame it on
the falling sky, blame it on the satellite that
beams me home.
For 10 minutes. Forget about everything.
Moral luck is your redemption. All your
jokes that have not worked, blame it on
moral luck. For 10 minutes, this is your salva
tion.

believe in determinism. Forget about the fu
ture. Forget about the past. For 10 minutes, be
lieve in determinism. Climb to the zenith of
your existence and jump off it.
Believe in determinism. All your past, all
the painful memories — I say believe in de
terminism. Change the lyrics to the Radio
head song "Blackstar" and sing: Blame it on
determinism, blame it on the falling sky, blame
it on the satellite that beams me home.
However, soon everything is going to tum
ble, for determinism is not as sturdy an anti
dote as we thought it was. Consider the follow
ing thought experiment, adopted from Prince
ton philosopher Harry Frankfurt.
Suppose Jennifer Connelly wants to kill
me. (She does "kill" me quite frequently. Have
you seen "House of Sand and Fog?") And also
suppose that Amy Hempel also wants me
killed but she is not willing to do it on her own.
Amy inserts diodes into Jennifer's brain. If
Jennifer hesitates in the act of murder, Amy
can press the button on her electronic trans
mitter and activate the diodes on Jennifer's
brain. The diodes compel Jennifer to murder
me no matter what. Jennifer goes on to kill me

(I told you that she "killed" me) without
Amy's ever needing to activate the diodes.
Now, Jennifer could not have done otherwise
but does that save her from moral responsibil
ity? I tend to think not.
Once I realized that Jennifer Connelly (in
Harry Frankfurt's argument) makes a good
case for the claim that determinism is com
patible with all my awkward silences, I start
ed looking for other scapegoats. Consider
moral luck.
Moral luck is the claim that moral respon
sibility depends not only on the factors that
are under the moral agent's control but also
on factors that depend on chance.
Consider another thought experiment:
T\vo murderers willingly shoot at victims. One
kills his victim. The other misses because his
victim accidentally bends forward during
shooting. Law and our moral intuition assign
more moral burden to the former case. Both
murderers acted the same with respect to the
factors they can control, yet one of them gets
more blame.
So, I say, believe in moral luck. All your
awkward silences, all your anxiety... All the
painful memories... Believe in moral luck.
Climb to the zenith of your existence and
jump off it. Believe in moral luck. Change the
lyrics to the Radiohead song "Blackstar" and
sing: Blame it on the moral luck, blame it on
the falling sky, blame it on the satellite that
beams me home.
For 10 minutes. Forget about everything.
Moral luck is your redemption. All your
jokes that have not worked, blame it on
moral luck. For 10 minutes, this is your salva
tion.
