Did the mob make them safer?
Am I the only person who noticed that in
the flashmob-for-bike-safety photo in Tues
day's paper ("Flashmob organized around
Claw," Jan. 31). none of the cyclists were
wearing a helmet and one was even talking
on his cell phone? Also, didn't flashmobs
come into — and go out of — fashion two
years ago?

Too much water for grass
i laughed to myself when I read your edi
torial encouraging students to use less water
and electricity ("University should do more
to conserve energy," Jan. 31). Don't get me
wrong. I fully support energy conservation,
but take a look around campus. Those lovely
green patches of grass require a lot of water
to stay in their current oh-so-lovely crab
grass-ridden state. How about planting na
tive plants or using rock gardens, as they do in
many drier parts of the country? Yes, it is
rainy in the winter, but for the other nine

months, it's sunny and extremely dry here.
Perhaps if the University itself decides to be
more frugal with its water usage, then admin
istrators can urge students to do so as well.

Robber Barons over Indians?
Maybe the University would not have
such problems with students trying to revive
the Indian mascot ("Native American groups
demand apology for shirt," Jan. 25) if they
had let us become the Robber Barons. For a
university that prides itself on quirkiness and
a sense of humor, the administration can be
awfully uptight sometimes.

Indian not purely offensive
The recent controversy over the Stanford
Indian mascot and the administration's deci
sion to threaten students with the Funda
mental Standard ("Hennessy condemns In
dian logo," Jan. 30) are evidence of a dysfunc

tional university.
Freedom of speech was established on the
principal that, in a free marketplace of ideas,
the best idea will eventually emerge victori
ous. Free speech is absolutely crucial to the
proper functioning of the University. If
speech is stifled, no exchange of ideas can
take place, and education cannot occur.
The Indian mascot controversy is a per
fect example of such stifling. Both The Daily
and local television stations have seized on
the Stanford American Indian Organiza
tion's complaints concerning the mascot, but
not a bit of coverage has been dedicated to
the history of the mascot or to the reasons the
mascot is considered offensive. The crush of
media attention has given the SAIO a golden
opportunity to educate the Stanford commu
nity about the controversy, but that opportu
nity has been missed.
These organizations take their cue from
the administration, which has stifled all de
bate on the issue by invoking the Fundamen
tal Standard.
Not everyone finds the Stanford Indian
symbol offensive. Furthermore, as a symbol
of a Stanford tradition, it is not without re

deeming value.
These opposing views need to be ex
pressed in a free discussion even if it is only so
that they can be refuted.
Instead, debate is stifled, no discussion
takes place and no one is educated.
