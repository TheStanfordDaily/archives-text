— CANDICE WIGGINS, sophomore

ITiirty-scven seconds into the No. 15/13
women's basketball team's game against South
ern California this past weekend, sophomore
guard Candice Wiggins made a three-pointer. It
was far from unusual for the Cardinal s leading
scorer. Hut, in fact, that's exactly why it was spe
cial.

With the shot,
Wiggins sur
passed 1,000
points in her
year-and-a-half
career at Stan
ford. But, for
Wiggins, the
four-digit club
was no big deal.
"It just hap
pened.'' Wiggins
said. "I didn't
even know."
At a prior
practice, head
coach Tara Van-
Derveer had
told Wiggins
that she was ap
proaching 1,000.

1017 POINTS,
BUT NOT
COUNTING
Candice Wiggins
Sophomore guard Can
dice Wiggins cracked the
1000-point mark in just
54 games and ranks
third nationally with 21.3
points per game. But for
Wiggins, the milestones
and attention don't mat
ter —just her team's ac
complishments.

prised she had so many points, but she said it
didn't become a focus for her in the weekend's
games. She came within one point of 1,000 in a
loss to UCLA before topping the mark in the
victory over USC.
"I'm just happy to do whatever I can for my
team," Wiggins said."l'm not like 'Oh, I've got to
get a thousand."'
Regardless, Wiggins became the 26th player
in Stanford history to surpass 1 .(KM) points. More
impressively, she was the second fastest to do so,
hitting the mark in 54 games. Jeanne Ruark Hoff
crossed 1.000 in 19X0 after 49 games.
"It is a milestone," VanDerveer said. "It
shows that she can really score, and I think the
fact that her percentage [.491 ] is so good — be
cause she's not just taking a lot of shots nor does
she play the whole game — makes it a real com
pliment to her and her game."
Meanwhile. Wiggins remains characteristical
ly modest about her accomplishment.
"She's such a humble person, you'd never
even know [she's accomplished so much)," jun
ior center Brooke Smith said.
"She understands that basketball is a team ef
fort," VanDerveer added. "It's not something
you do by yourself. Someone is passing her the
ball,someone is rebounding, someone is putting
up a screen for her. She's a consummate team
player."
Despite such support. Wiggins said shooting
was difficult last season. She admits that, at
times, she would question herself when she
missed shots.
Nonetheless. Wiggins led last year's team
with 17.5 points per game. This year, with more
practice — and confidence — under her belt,

she averages 21.3 points, good enough to place
her third in the nation.
"She's very aggressive, but she's taking better
shots," VanDerveer said. "She's on balance
more, and she's not forcing things as much. Not
that she did a lot last year anyway, but now she
lets the game come to her."
Smith also recognizes Wiggins' improve
ment, especially on the perimeter. Wiggins' .422
three-point percentage is among the best on the
squad.
"Candice is one of the most competitive peo
ple. She's always working hard and she's always
going to get better." Smith said.
Wiggins showcased her improvement by
posting a career-high 37 points against Oregon
earlier this season.The game was one of four this
season in which she scored over 30.

Again though, Wiggins insists she pays the
statistics little attention.
"I'm like'Oh, OK, I scored 30,'" Wiggins said.
"I feel like I'm trying to do as much as I can, and
I don't necessarily look at the scoreboard like 30
equals a good game. [A good game is] a game
that I can walk away from and say that I gave
everything and helped my team."
This team focus is what has led Wiggins to set
a team-first ultimate goal for her Stanford ca
reer: leading the Cardinal to the Final Four, just
two wins away from a national championship.
"There's great tradition, great individual
players at Stanford, but I just want our team to
get there — that would make me so happy," Wig
gins said."l think that's the best kind of player —
(one] that can make people around her better
and take her team the furthest."

Wiggins ranks third in the nation in scoring, an effort that will likely land the sophomore her second
straight All-American recognition. Above, Wiggins looks for space against Arizona's Ashley Whisonat.
