# Super? Not most NFL Title Games
## 
### 
I love everything about the Super
Bowl. 1 love (he two weeks leading
up to the game, when the media runs
out of news and ends up repetitively
writing the same dramatic feature story
using different words five days in a row
(kind of like what I do with my column
every week). And don't forget the way
ESPN will have a pre-game show start
ing literally two days before the game,
analyzing everything from the quarter
back to grass conditions to the quality
of beer served at Ford Field.
I have stayed up late into the night
watching countless recaps of past
Super Bowls on every major sports
channel. I enjoy watching non-sports
fans' eyes light up at the sight of the
most expensive commercials of all
time. And there's always the hope that
whatever hot artist is playing the half
time show (though this year it's the
Rolling Stones) will have a wardrobe
malfunction.
The highlight of Super Bowl Sunday,
though, is the pre-Bowl game of foot
ball you play with your friends, leaving
you unable to do anything afterwards
but sit on the couch and stare at the tel
evision, consuming a steady dose of hot
wings. Kielbasas, pizza, burgers and
beer. It's better than Christmas.
A good game makes it even better,
though that rarely happens.
In my life, I have looked forward to
the actual game part of only two Super
Bowls. The first was the 1997 Denver-
Green Bay game, which pitted Brett
Favre against John Elway. That game
lived up to the hype with Elway's leg
endary bootleg run for a touchdown.
The second was last year's Super Bowl,
where Philadelphia faced oif against
New England, in a game that was close
but not well played.
Of course, my favorite Super Bowl
of all time was when Steve Young. Jerry
Rice, Ricky Watters, Brent Jones,
Deion Sanders and the rest of the 49ers
absolutely destroyed San Diego like it
was a game of Super Tecmo Bowl.
Without an exciting matchup or the
49ers in it. this year's game doesn't look
too hot for me
I blame it on the Seahawks. For most
of their existence, the Seahawks have
symbolized mediocrity. Even this cur
rent Holmgren-Hasselbeck-Alexander
team is known more for choking than
for winning. I hope for the sake of the
game that they've turned the corner and
learned from those mistakes. But a part
of me can see a dumb Hasselbeck inter
ception or an Alexander fumble in
crunch time.
Then we have the Steelers. A nuni
ber-six seed making it to the Super
Bowl and becoming a four-point fa
vorite. rhat's telling. The sixth-best
AFC team is still better than the top
NFC team.
But I still think the game could be
good.
Both coaches. Bill Cowher and
Mike Holmgren, have something to
prove — Holmgren that he can win the
big one without Favre. and Cowher
that he can win the big one, period.
Jerome Bettis is running in his last
game in his hometown. Is there any
better way to motivate him? Shaun
Alexander can prove he's more than
just a Fantasy Football freak.
But the two dynamic players in this
game are both USC alums and both on
defense. Troy Palamalu, the hard hit
ting safety who at times reminds you of
Ronnie Lott, is no doubt Pittsburgh's
MVP this season.
On the other hand, Lofa Tatupu of
Seattle is an emerging star at linebacker.
Go back and watch the Carolina game.
This guy was everywhere — sacking the
quarterback, deflecting passes, nailing
whatever poor back the Panthers could
send his way. Both Tatupu and Palamalu
are future defensive icons in this league.
A big game here could give either one
the presence that guys like Lawrence
Taylor and Lott had.
The game will come down to these
guys, and I see Tatupu pulling through.
One of the most mediocre franchises in
NFL history beats out one of its most
storied. Seattle wins 28-24. Trust me, it
took two weeks of pain to come up with
that prediction.
Even though I really won't care how
the game actually turns out.
