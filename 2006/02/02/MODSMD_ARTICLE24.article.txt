# FINALLY, FREEBIES START DROPPING
## 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
With 0.2 seconds left on the clock
and the Cardinal down by three, sen
ior guard Chris Hernandez stepped
to the free-throw line to attempt
three shots to tie the score at 63 and
send the game to overtime. For Stan
ford, there was certainly no man they
would have preferred attempting
those crucial, high-pressure shots.
Yet, statistically, Stanford fans

should have felt
comfortable
with any number
of Stanford play
ers on the line.
While Hernan
dez does lead the
team — shoot
ing an incredible
87.7 percent
from the charity
stripe — there
are seven players
on the Cardinal
roster shooting
above 75 per
cent, and one
(Dan Grunfeld)
just below.
As a team.

Stanford is one of the best free-throw
shooting teams in the nation. The
Cardinal lead the Pac-10 in team
shooting from the line, and their
nearest competitor (Arizona) is
nearly five percentage points behind.
How much has this consistency
helped the Cardinal this season? It is
clear that without Hernandez's abili
ty to hit free-throws, Stanford would
have fallen to Washington last Sun
day.
Stanford's three lowest shooting
percentage games of the season all
came in non-conference losses to
weaker opponents. They shot just
52.4 percent in a loss to Montana,
46.7 percent in a loss to Division II
UC-Davis and hit just 66.7 percent of
their freebies while falling to Vir
ginia Tech, including two missed
front ends of one-and-ones by Her
nandez in the closing minutes.

IN THE
CLUTCH
Chris Hernandez
Sure, Chris Hernandez' late
game Washington heroics
won't be soon forgotten, but
a larger trend is at play. After
a slower start, Stanford has
been dominant at the free
throw line as of recently, and
men's basketball beat writer
Alex Gyr explores why.

But,despite the importance to the
Cardinal of good free throw shooting
and the ability to convert in critical
situations, head coach Trent Johnson
says that free-throws don't affect the
offensive planning for most of the
game.
"The only time I talk about free
throw situations and changing
what we do offensively is if we're
going down the stretch and we're
in the bonus, we try to attack the
driving lanes and take the ball up

the middle," John
son said. "You can't
get away from what
you do, which is to
go inside out and
stay aggressive."
But Johnson ad
mits that while he
doesn't change his
coaching style to fit
the free-throw ability
of his team, some of
the players adjust
their games based on
the free-throw situa
tion.
"The kids know,"
Johnson said. "We
talk about being ag
gressive and taking

the angles and attacking the rim."
Senior forward Matt Haryasz,
who despite being 6-foot-ll is still
one of the best free throw shooters
on the team at 79 percent, uses his
ability to shoot free throws not only
as an offensive weapon, but as a de
fensive one as well.
"I always try to get to the line,"
Haryasz said. "It's an easy way to get
in rhythm early in the game. It gets
you points and it gets the opposing
big men in trouble. I think we've
done a really good job of getting
other teams' big men in foul trou
ble."
Harayasz's success from the field
has only increased his ability to get to
the line. Against Washington,
Haryasz took a season-high 13 free
throw attempts, while shooting 8-of
-14 from the field. He missed five at
tempts on the night, a rare poor free

throw shooting night for 1 laryasz.
"In regulation and overtime. Matt
missed a couple of free throws and he
got frustrated." Johnson said. "I
looked at him and said, 'You aren't
going to make (hem all.' but he just
loves to shoot the ball."
Haryasz is just one of a number of
big-men on the Cardinal who can
consistently shoot freebies. Fresh
man forward Lawrcnce Hill hit five
critical free throws against Washing
ton and is shooting 80 percent on the

season. Sophomore center Peter
Prowitt is also shooting above 80
percent.
Haryasz and his Stanford team
mates' ability to hit an unguarded
shot 15 feet from the backboard
could pay off down the stretch in the
Pac-10, when every game and every
point matters.
ITie Cardinal face Oregon tomor
row. I he Ducks are last in the confer
ence from the charity stripe. When
the teams played earlier this season.

Stanford made 11 free-throws while
shooting 70 percent; the Ducks hit
just five and shot 50 percent from the
line.The Cardinal wen! on to win by
just two points.
Hernandez's effort last Sunday
showed a level of control and cool
ness that few can duplicate. But if his
teammates' efforts in similar situa
tions this season are any indication.
Hernandez may not have been the
only Cardinal player with so smooth
a hand.

20 points for five straight games, an effort that has earned him Pac-10 Player of the Week honors two weeks straight.
