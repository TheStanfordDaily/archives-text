# Wrestling with the future: Oregon schools await
## 
### DENIS GRIFFIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Cardinal wrestlers are already
focused on the Pac-10 Tournament,
slated to begin on Feb. 26, that will de
cide their individual fates moving into
the NCAA Tournament and their
team standing within the conference
at the end of the year. But that's not to
say that this weekend's events — the
final home dual meets of the season —
are meaningless.
"They're big matches," coach Kerry
McCoy said. "Obviously every match
from here is big, with implications for
conference seeding. But they're also
big matches, coming off the loss last
weekend, in how we respond to that."
After their very disappointing 38-6
loss to UC-Davis (4-6,2-2 Pac-10), the
Cardinal (5-4, 2-1) are scheduled to
face three more conference rivals this
weekend at Burnham Pavilion. On
Friday, Stanford will square off against
Oregon (6-4, 4-3) and Oregon State
(10-2-1,5-1) at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. Then,
on Saturday, wrestling closes out its
home dual meet schedule with a noon
match against the Portland State
Vikings (3-14,0-4).
Stanford's senior wrestlers will be
honored at Saturday's match against
the Vikings. Cardinal fans will have
their last chance to see the graduating
class of wrestlers in action in the dual
meet setting.
The final home swing of the season
gives Stanford an opportunity to con
tinue gearing up for the Pac-10 Tour
nament.
"We're four weeks away from the
Pac-10, so we can't look at just getting
ready for these dual meets," McCoy
said. "We have to continue to prepare
for the end of the year. We're going to
continue to train hard, with our focus
being getting ready for the Pac-10, and
then realize that we have a few stops
along the way."
One of those stops has proved to be
notably challenging for the Cardinal
over the years. Stanford has compiled
a 1-28-1 record against the Beavers
since the series began in 1953. Howev
er recent history has seen the nature of
that rivalry begin to shift.

The Cardinal had never beaten
Oregon State until 2004, when Stan
ford posted an 18-17 upset over the
Beavers. Then, last season, Stanford
posted an 18-18 tie against their con
ference rival. This year's match could
be a telling signpost for the direction
of the series. But the Beavers won't be
the only team posing a challenge for
the Cardinal.
"Oregon State and the guys have
built up a really big rivalry the last
couple of years," McCoy said. "And
Oregon's got a really tough team.
Those are big matches. Portland State
is a great way to finish out our home
season — we've got to be ready to
wrestle hard against them. On paper
they're not as strong as some other
teams, but we can't take anything for
granted."
One good sign for Stanford is the
improved health of the team, which
was a factor in the match against UC-
Davis.
"I think all of our guys are starting
to come back," McCoy said. "All of our
guys have been in the room practicing,
shaking off their little injuries, sick
ness. stuff like that. It seemed like
everything happened at the wrong
time, but better for it to happen then
than for it to happen in a couple of
weeks."
With the crucial end of the season
rapidly approaching, McCoy noticed
his team's intensity improving.
"I don't have to remind them,"
McCoy said, "but I've been saying
every workout that we're four weeks
out. It's a constant reminder that this is
the goal that we've been working for
all year — to get to this point — and
now we're there. So we've got to re
member to keep focused."
