# Water polo eases into season with Pacific
## 
### WES MATEO SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For the members of the Stanford
women's water polo team, the wait
ing game is nearly over.
When the first whistle sounds at
noon this Saturday in the Avery
Aquatic Center, it will be signaling
more than just the start of the Cardi
nal's home-opener against the Pacif
ic Tigers — it will be signaling the re
newal of an NCAA title hunt that
every member of the Stanford squad
is burning to get under way.
li has been a long offseason for
the Stanford women, who upset rival
Southern California in last year's
NCAA semifinal match before
falling to undefeated UCLA in the
championship game. The heart
breaking loss at the hands of the Bru
ins came by the narrowest of mar
gins, with the Cardinal trailing by a
single goal as time expired.
But the members of this year's
squad have put the past behind them
and have dedicated themselves to
taking their performance this season
one notch higher. And sporting a ros
ter of seasoned veterans and promis
ing underclassman, the Cardinal
look well prepared to succeed in that
endeavor.
Captaining the Stanford women
this season are seniors Scotti Shafer
and Laurel Champion. In addition to
stepping up to assume the team's
leadership roles, both Shafer and
Champion will be counted on for
their varied contributions in both
ends of the pool.
"Laurel is a terrific defender
whose speed and strength make her
a bona fide threat in transition and in
front of the goal," head coach John
Tanner said. "Scotti makes great de
cisions under pressure. She is ex
tremely difficult to guard."
Two-meter Nancy El-Sakkary
rounds out the team's corps of sen
iors. Along with junior Christina
Hewko, she will provide a powerful
offensive presence at set.
"We're doing really well at two
meters with Nancy and Christina,"
junior driver Katie Hansen said. "So
we should have a really good front

court."
Hansen led the squad in scoring
last year, racking up an impressive 43
goals in 29 games. El-Sakkary and
Hewko finished close behind, post
ing totals of 34 and 33 goals, respec
tively.
Yet despite having dependable
options at the two-meter mark,
speed and movement will continue
to define the Cardinal's offensive
strategies.
"We're a really fast team, so we're
going to have a really dynamic
game," Hansen said.
Four of the squad's five incoming
freshman are listed as drivers on the
team's roster, as are the Cardinal's
four sophomores: Megan May,
Jacquelyn Gauthier, Megan Nesland
and Jenna Scalmanini. So while
quickness and transitions will be no
table strong points for the Cardinal,
size will be of more concern — par
ticularly following the graduations of
two-meter stalwarts Hannah and
Kelty Luber, and the loss of senior
Val Riss to a shoulder injury.
Nevertheless, the Cardinal have
confidence that the versatility of
their squad will enable them to make
the necessary compensations.
"We lost a lot of size in graduating
Hannah and Kelty," Hansen said. "So
we don't have as much two-meter de
fense as we did last year. But we're
having a lot of people fill in that role,
so we should be fine. And we still
have [junior] Alison Gregorka and
Laurel, who are doing awesome."
Freshman two-meter defender
Jessica Steffens, who at six feet is the
tallest member of the team, will also
likely get into the defensive mix as
the season progresses.
But according to Hansen, the
Cardinal's ability to effectively shut

down the opposition's offense has al
ways stemmed from impeccable
team work and communication.
"Our front court defense has been
strong because we play as a team and
are really tactful about what works in
certain situations," she said. "That
leads into counters, which we can
take care of because we're so fast."
Anchoring the Stanford women's
defensive effort in net is junior goalie
Meridith McColl. Given her statisti
cal record during her two years on
the Farm — including 190 saves last
season — it would be easy to take for
granted McColl's habit of frequently
turning in highlight-reel perform
ances.
But the play of the Stanford
squad's underclassmen looks to be
equally exciting this year, as a wide
range of players stand to emerge as
consistent threats when in posses
sion of the ball. Hansen spoke highly
of the potential that both the fresh
men and sophomores on the team
have displayed.
"They're all doing well," she said.
"Jackie [Gauthier]'s filling in more
two-meter post-up roles, and Megan

May's a pure driver. They're all get
ting to be a lot more experienced and
are defining where they fit into the
team."
The rapid adjustments that the
team's freshmen have made is per
haps as impressive as the talent they
have displayed.
"As a group they've really come
together and improved so much,"
Hansen said. "They've also worked
so hard and are really aggressive
players. Jess [Steffens] can fill in
Hannah and Kelty's role, Lolo [Sil
ver] and Koree [Blyleven] are great
outside shooters, Heather [West] is
going to be asked to do a lot of two
meter stuff and Kira [Hillman] is a
really good reader."
Given their level of talent, energy
and enthusiasm, the Cardinal know
that everything is fully within their
reach this season.
"[Our goal is] to win everything,"
Hansen said. "We could go undefeat
ed if it all works out. A lot of that
comes down to luck, but a lot of it is
within our means. We came really
close last year, so it's going to be a fun
year."

Out of Ann Arbor, Mich.'s Pioneer High School, junior two-meter defender Al
ison Gregorka has made her mark thousands of miles away at Stanford. Last
season, she tallied 1 7 goals for the national runners-up.
