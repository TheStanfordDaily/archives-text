## Card look to feast on bottom feeders Head coach VanDerveer could notch 650th coaching win 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
Focusing on each and every game has been one
of the hallmarks of Tara VanDerveer's success for
many years. So much is swirling around her team
this week — including an essential come-from
behind win at Southern California last weekend,
Candice Wiggins scoring her I,oooth point and
VanDerveer approaching 650 lifetime wins and
500 at Stanford. But the No. 15/13 Cardinal are
working extra hard to keep their concentration on
two potential sleeper games against Oregon and
Oregon State this weekend.
"Oregon State (9-9,3-7 Pac-10) has struggled
in the past, but they're definitely getting better,"
junior center Brooke Smith said. "They beat Ore
gon last week, which is obviously a big win for
them. And Oregon (13-7,4-6) has had some losses
that they shouldn't necessarily have had, but
they're very talented as well. You're going to get
everyone's best effort, so you can never look past
them."
The Cardinal (14-5, 9-2) return to Maples
Pavilion from one of their hardest conference
road trips. Stanford currently posts an all-time
.9375 conference winning percentage, including
six straight victories on the home court — making
Maples one of the toughest places for visitors to
play in all of women's basketball.
