## Card look to feast on bottom feeders Head coach VanDerveer could notch 650th coaching win 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
Focusing on each and every game has been one
of the hallmarks of Tara VanDerveer's success for
many years. So much is swirling around her team
this week — including an essential come-from
behind win at Southern California last weekend,
Candice Wiggins scoring her I,oooth point and
VanDerveer approaching 650 lifetime wins and
500 at Stanford. But the No. 15/13 Cardinal are
working extra hard to keep their concentration on
two potential sleeper games against Oregon and
Oregon State this weekend.
"Oregon State (9-9,3-7 Pac-10) has struggled
in the past, but they're definitely getting better,"
junior center Brooke Smith said. "They beat Ore
gon last week, which is obviously a big win for
them. And Oregon (13-7,4-6) has had some losses
that they shouldn't necessarily have had, but
they're very talented as well. You're going to get
everyone's best effort, so you can never look past
them."
The Cardinal (14-5, 9-2) return to Maples
Pavilion from one of their hardest conference
road trips. Stanford currently posts an all-time
.9375 conference winning percentage, including
six straight victories on the home court — making
Maples one of the toughest places for visitors to
play in all of women's basketball.

Junior center Brooke Smith averages 1 7.9 points per game on 57%
shooting from the field. Every "Superwoman" has her kryptonite, and for
Smith, it's a more human 76.1% from the charity stripe.
The Cardinal have been espe
cially successful against both the
Ducks and the Beavers. The only
win for either of the two schools in
38 total games was an Oregon vic
tory on March 5,1987.
"I think it's great for us. momen
tum-wise [to play five of our last
eight games at home], especially
going into the Pac-10 Tournament
and then NCAAs," junior guard
Clare Bodensteiner said. "The be
ginnings of the games are so impor
tant to us because being at home
just extends your lead, and you've
definitely got to win at home and
get what you can on the road."
The match-up with the Ducks
will pit the conference's top scoring
offense (79.6 points per game)
against Oregon's top-ranked de
fense (56.5 points allowed per
game).
"Which one are we?" Van-
Derveer joked on a Pac-10 telecon
ference.
"A lot of it is match-ups, and to
be honest I don't really look at that
stuff," she said. "In Oregon's situa
tion. I think a lot of that has been
because of the tempo of the game."
Oregon will look primarily in
side to sophomore center Gabrielle
Richards. The Australian native

THE FORECAST
They say they don't play the games on paper, but it sure doesn't look good for Oregon or Oregon
State. Stanford leads the entire Pac-lOhy two games, and these squads are seventh and eighth.

currently leads the conference with
an 87.9 free throw percentage and
anchors a tough unit of big players
who lead the Pac-10 in blocks and
defensive rebounding.
"They're really big and they play
a lot of people," Bodensteiner said.
"They can all shoot. Individually,
they're very skilled and they play
tough."
"We really need to rebound and
run the floor on them," Smith said.
"If we just focus on the things we
want to do well, like pushing the
ball in transition and coming up big
defensively, [we'll be successful]."
Oregon State,on the other hand,
depends on the combination of sen
ior guards Mandy Close and Anita

Rivera. Both Close and Rivera are
almost always on the floor — they
average an amazing 36.61 minutes
per game.
Close, who leads the Pac-10 in
assists per game (4.78). will look to
her favorite target, senior forward
Kim Butler. Butler leads her team
in scoring with 17.3 points per
game, which is good for fourth in
the conference.
"Oregon State plays a small ro
tation, but those who do play are
very skilled," Bodensteiner said.
"They're not quite as big, but
they're a little more athletic, a little
scrappier. Each game is going to be
quite different for us and we're
going to have to adjust to the style."

Also on the radar for the Cardi
nal is a small list of big individual
achievements. VanDerveer would
reach her 650 th win with a sweep
this weekend, and is only four wins
away from S(X) at the helm of Stan
ford's program. Sophomore guard
Candice Wiggins also makes her re
turn to Maples after becoming the
second fastest player in team histo
ry to reach 1 ,(XK) career points. But
all these distractions will not cloud
the team's focus on the ultimate
goal.
"We all try to focus on the
team ," Bodensteiner said. "(Can
dice] tries to focus on the team,
coach focuses on the team, and
that's how it works out so well."
