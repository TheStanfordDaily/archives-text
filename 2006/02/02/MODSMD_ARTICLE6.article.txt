## Police raid EBF junior, wire leads to cocaine bust Suspected dealer stopped on way to Tahoe, charges have not yet been filed 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD MANAGING EDITOR 
In a sting operation involving a student wearing a
wire and a five-squad-car ambush, Stanford police ar
rested junior Paul Larson on Friday for possession of co
caine and other illicit drugs with the intent to sell.
According to eyewitnesses and police, the squad cars
pulled over the vehicle carrying Larson — who was
bound for Lake Tahoe on the Enchanted Broccoli For
est ski trip — at 4:05 p.m. on Campus Drive near Vaden
Health Center. During a subsequent search of the vehi
cle, officers found marijuana and later obtained a war
rant to search Larson's room in EBF.
There, police say they found cocaine, psilocybin —
commonly termed mushrooms — and more marijuana,
as well as implements to sell narcotics. Larson was taken
into custody before his room was searched, and was
booked into San Jose Main Jail for possession of a con
trolled substance and paraphernalia and for possession
of implements for the sale of narcotics.
Sophomore Peter Zaffaroni, who was driving by
Vaden when the suspect was handcuffed by police, char
acterized Larson's facial expression as admixture of ter
ror and fury."
An additional passenger in the vehicle was found in
possession of less than one ounce of marijuana, said
Deputy Ken Bates of the Stanford Department of Pub
lic Safety. The passenger, a junior, was taken to the sta
tion with Larson, cited and released shortly thereafter.
Hours after the arrest, police obtained a warrant and
raided Larson's EBF dorm room very early Saturday
morning, seizing the illicit drugs and related property.
Sources told The Daily that the amount of cocaine
found was roughly 15 grams. Officers had been staking
out Larson's dorm room before obtaining the warrant,
witnesses said.
Police also confiscated paraphernalia and discovered
evidence in the room that strongly suggested Larson
was involved in selling the drugs. Bates said.
The investigation began Thursday, according to stu
dents familiar with the incident after a junior was hospital
ized, having suffered a seizure associated with cocaine use.
Police approached the student at the hospital and con
vinced her to cooperate in the investigation of Larson.
The student was then outfitted with a wire and direct
ed to buy more cocaine from Larson. In the course of
their conversation, police were able to glean enough in
formation to move forward, according to several sources.
When questioned about the use
of a wire in the investigation. Bates
said he could "neither confirm nor
deny" such reports.
The case is currently under review
by the Santa Clara County District
Attorney's Office. Formal charges
have not yet been filed, and Larson's
sentence depends on a host of differ
ent factors, according to Bates.
This is not Larson's first run-in
with the law. In January 2004, the
then-freshman was arrested and
charged for being a minor in posses
sion of alcohol, resisting arrest, giv
ing a false name and being drunk in
public at a Branner party.

When contacted by The Daily
about his recent arrest, Larson re
fused to comment.
Citing the Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act, Vice Provost
of Student Affairs Greg Boardman
said he was unable to speak on the
specifics of the situation, but said
that the case will also be processed
through Stanford Judicial Affairs.
The incident was "not only an al
leged violation of the law, but also an
alleged violation of the Fundamen
tal Standard," Boardman said.
He also chose not to comment on
the University's specific role in the
investigation, but said, "Once we get
a report that there has been the sell
ing of illegal drugs, we are obligated
to report it to the police."
Such arrests on campus are rare,
he stressed.
"We have zero tolerance for use of

illegal drugs on campus," Boardman
said. "This is not something that hap
pens on a frequent basis, certainly."
While marijuana use is not un
common on campus, and the alleged
15 grams of cocaine recovered is not
large by most standards. Bates em
phasized that the implications of the
incident should not be lost on other
campus residents.
"This is serious stuff," he said.
"Not only is what this person was
doing serious and dangerous to him,
but also to his clients. People who
supply this kind of stuff have history
of being violent, not necessarily this
seller, but perhaps the person above
him. And now his supplier is intro
duced to Stanford, which introduced
a whole new crime element into the
community."
