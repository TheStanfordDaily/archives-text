# LOOKING AHEAD
## Footballinks 18, Class ranks 44th 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
At 6:30 p.m. last night, defensive tackle Sione Fua
went on Fox Sports West television to verbally commit
to playing football for either Stanford, BYU or Ore
gon, starting next fall. When Fua announced his inten
tions to come to the Farm, he provided a dramatic
flourish to National Signing Day, a day on which 18
total players formally declared their intent to attend
Stanford next season.
Scout.com ranks the incoming class 44th nationally
and eighth in the Pac-1(). Eleven of these players are of
fensive (five wide receivers, four linemen, one running
back and one quarterback), with the remaining seven on
defense (four linemen, two linebackers and a defensive
back). Five of these players are prep All-Americans and
11 are All-Region selections.
Head coach Walt Harris was pleased with the incom
ing class.
"This was a good, solid year for us," he said. "We're
excited about the progress we're making. 44
According to Mike Eubanks, who runs Stanford's
Scout.com site — a national network specializing in col
lege football and basketball recruiting — the headliners
of this year's class are Fua. defensive end Levirt Griffin,
running back Toby Gerhart and wide receiver Richard
Sherman.
As a four-star player on Scout's
one-to-five scale, Fua earned the
highest rank of any incoming Cardi
nal. Tempering the enthuasiam,
though, is the fact that Fua may post
pone his playing days by two years
by taking a Latter-Day Saint mis
sion.
Griffin was originally committed
to California, but decommitted from
the Bears to instead pledge with
Stanford. Eubanks believes that he
projects well at the college level as a
physical pass-rusher.
"He's a brawler," Harris said."He
likes to knock players around. He's
just a physical guy — he has some
thing like 39-inch sleeves and hands
that can easily reach around a pass
er." »
Gerhart is unique in that he is
also very talented at baseball. So
gifted, in fact, that while he plans to
be a dual-sport athlete in college,
there is also a strong possibility that
he will be an early-round draft pick
in the Major League Baseball draft
this June. While Stanford did not
offer a scholarship to Gerhart for
baseball, he figures to be a key con
tributor to the squad should he come
to Stanford next fall. Eubanks be
lieves this fact may encourage Ger
hart to delay the draft.
"Gerhart is a risk," Eubanks said.
"The last time Stanford signed a
multi-sport athlete, he never made it
here. But we need him on the base
ball team, and [baseball head coach]
Mark Marquess doesn't lose his
players to the professional draft."
Sherman is from Compton,Calif.,
an inner-city area not often repre
sented in the Stanford community.
As a versatile athlete — he's an Ail-
American in the triple-jump —
Sherman can play both receiver and
cornerback. Sherman's ability to
play in the secondary is significant,
because it is usually difficult for
Stanford, with its stringent admis
sions policies, to recruit at those po
sitions.
"The question of where to play
Sherman first [receiver or corner

— WALT HARRIS,
football head coach
back] will be a difficult one," Eu
banks said."He may not match some
of the most elite Pac-10 receivers,
but he's still very good. He is a Mark
Bradford-type athlete. But Stanford
also needs cornerbacks."
Rounding out the signees are
Stephen Carr, Mark Mueller, Mar
cus Ranee and Austin Yancy at wide
receiver, Brian Bulcke and Derek
Hall at defensive end, Joe Dem
besky at offensive tackle, John Kyed,
Bert Mcßride and Andrew Phillips
at offensive line, Tyler Porras at cor
nerback, Nick Macaluso and Sam
Weinberger at linebacker and Alex
Loukas at quarterback.
Harris repeatedly expressed en
thusiasm for the attitude of the in
coming class.
"We were looking for guys that
really have passion," he said. "How
they carry themselves is so impor
tant. We want eager, bright-eyed, en
thusiastic players. There's nothing
like coaching those kids. I talked to
some guys in my office and they fired
me up. I had one guy who was so ex
cited, I thought he was going to jump
across the table and give me a kiss."
