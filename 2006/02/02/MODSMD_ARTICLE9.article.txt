## STUDENT GROUPS Muslim groups lobby for community center Full-time center director also a goal, students say 
### MIMA MOHAMMED CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Several student groups au
thored a proposal last fall for the
construction of a Muslim Commu
nity Center. More recently, the
groups have been lobbying for ap
proval of their request for space
and funding for a full-time center
and director.
The groups behind the proposal
include the Muslim Students
Awareness Network (MSAN), Is
lamic Society of Stanford Universi
ty (ISSU), Organization of Arab
Students in Stanford (OASIS),
Lebanese Student Association at
Stanford (LSAS), Muslim Board,
Stanford Egyptians Association
(SEA). Pakistanis at Stanford
(PAS) and the Coalition for Justice
in the Middle East (CJME). The
Students of Color Coalition
(SOCC), Stanford American Indi
an Association (SAIO), Asian
American Student Association
(AASA) and MEChA have also
expressed support for the proposal.
"This unified call comes from
the entire community, comprised of
a dozen cultural groups, with stu

dents from Morocco to Indonesia
— a region that represents one
fourth the world's population, 52
nations and 60 languages — and
the many students, staff and faculty
interested in the Muslim world,"
said MSAN President Omar
Shakir, a junior. "We hope to estab
lish a center that will make the
Muslim community on campus ac
cessible and visible to all those in
terested in learning about the cul
ture and region."
In addition to the construction
of a Muslim Community Center,
the proposal requests the funds to
hire a full-time staff member who
would act as a liaison to the Univer
sity and help students with counsel
ing. This position would also pro
mote cultural interactions within
the community,strengthen ties with
other community directors, pro
fnote academic and cultural pro
gramming and direct interested
students to available resources.
The proposal, which examines
the growth of the Muslim commu
nity at Stanford, outlines how the
personal, educational and organi
zational needs for cultural groups
on campus have changed.
Student leaders that support the
proposal plan to meet with various
administrators; the first of these
meetings is scheduled with Vice
Provost of Student Affairs Greg
Boardman on Feb. 8. In addition. Po
litical Science Prof. Larry Diamond,
a senior fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion who endorses the proposal, has
promised to write a letter to Board
man.
A link to the online petition sup
porting the proposed Muslim Com
munity Center is currently circulat
ing dorm and group chat lists,gather
ing 350 signatures in its first 36 hours.
"The center would serve anyone
in the community who has a person
al, political, economic or social inter
est in the Muslim world," said soph
omore Sanah Parvez, treasurer of
the Islamic Society of Stanford.
"After Sept. 11,1 think that everyone
who identifies with some aspect of
the Muslim world, religiously or not.

unwittingly became a representative
of it. For this reason, there is a strong
need for a safe space on campus for
Muslim students where they can
learn and grow and communicate
with people who are undergoing
similar experiences and do this with
out fear."
Although there are many Stan
ford students involved in Muslim
and Middle Eastern groups on cam
pus, these groups' combined budget
is estimated at only $25,000. There is
currently no hired staff member to
support these organizations.
"Stanford has constantly set the
bar in creating a diverse, vibrant
campus community," said Shakir.
"But it has been slow meeting the
growing demand to learn more
about the Muslim world. We hope
Stanford can take this step forward
and re-establish itself as a leader in
promoting dialogue about Islam."
Other students have been largely
positive about the Muslim Commu
nity Center.
"I think it's great — there is no
reason for there not to be one, no

reason some groups should have
centers and others should not," said
Carla Pugliese, a sophomore. "If as a
campus we are to have ethnically, re
ligiously, racially themed centers,
there is no reason to exclude Middle
Eastern students."
"I believe that creating this Mus
lim Community Center — with the
goal of bringing the Stanford com
munity together — has beautiful po
tential to inform our thinking from a
perspective that is commonly misun
derstood and misrepresented on
many levels," said Quincy Tanner, a
sophomore. "With the number of in
ternational security and democratic
development classes and initiatives
that are available on campus, it is of
utmost importance to first realize
that with great opportunity here at
Stanford also comes great responsi
bility to be informed about the com
munities that surround us."
Due to time constraints, the short
term realistic goal of the proposal's
advocates is to have a portable meet
ing space and part-time advisor
hired by Sept. 2006.

"The center would serve anyone
in the community who has a person
al, political, economic or social inter
est in the Muslim world," said soph
omore Sanah Parvez, treasurer of
the Islamic Society of Stanford.
"After Sept. 11,1 think that everyone
who identifies with some aspect of
the Muslim world, religiously or not.

unwittingly became a representative
of it. For this reason, there is a strong
need for a safe space on campus for
Muslim students where they can
learn and grow and communicate
with people who are undergoing
similar experiences and do this with
out fear."
Although there are many Stan
ford students involved in Muslim
and Middle Eastern groups on cam
pus, these groups' combined budget
is estimated at only $25,000. There is
currently no hired staff member to
support these organizations.
"Stanford has constantly set the
bar in creating a diverse, vibrant
campus community," said Shakir.
"But it has been slow meeting the
growing demand to learn more
about the Muslim world. We hope
Stanford can take this step forward
and re-establish itself as a leader in
promoting dialogue about Islam."
Other students have been largely
positive about the Muslim Commu
nity Center.
"I think it's great — there is no
reason for there not to be one, no

reason some groups should have
centers and others should not," said
Carla Pugliese, a sophomore. "If as a
campus we are to have ethnically, re
ligiously, racially themed centers,
there is no reason to exclude Middle
Eastern students."
"I believe that creating this Mus
lim Community Center — with the
goal of bringing the Stanford com
munity together — has beautiful po
tential to inform our thinking from a
perspective that is commonly misun
derstood and misrepresented on
many levels," said Quincy Tanner, a
sophomore. "With the number of in
ternational security and democratic
development classes and initiatives
that are available on campus, it is of
utmost importance to first realize
that with great opportunity here at
Stanford also comes great responsi
bility to be informed about the com
munities that surround us."
Due to time constraints, the short
term realistic goal of the proposal's
advocates is to have a portable meet
ing space and part-time advisor
hired by Sept. 2006.
