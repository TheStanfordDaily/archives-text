# 7 hot spots to get your fix
## 
### roselyn ballet 
0H0" was my first Stanford
word and unfortunately, dur
ing my earliest months here,
my first and only coffee
source, too. I dabbled in Peet's, the Bookstore
and Moonbeans, of course, but for the most part
my reflex about where to go for coffee? CoHo.
As my tastes matured, I longed for new ex
periences. 1 wanted variety, atmosphere culture
— and I wanted better tasting coffee.
So this week, I resolved — No Go CoHo. I
will branch out and explore other sources for
my caffeine fix.
Olives
My first stop is Olives. The cafe accommo
dates customers with indoor and outdoor seat
ing, a convenient location behind the history
corner and — the big bonus — the fact that
you can use meal plan points. The staff will also
modify any drink on their menu.
"Students will say 'Hey, can you make this?'
and we'll do it; we'll do whatever it is to try to
please the palate," says employee Lupe Pena.
Pena cites sugar-free options as one very
popular accommodation and offers me a sugar
free, soy milk chai latte,so I can see why for my
self. It's delicious and tastes more like tea than
any sickly-sweet alternative I've had else
where.
The cafe teems with regulars, among them
freshman Sarah Vick.
"I have my scone and soy latte from Olives
every single day," she says."I don't think 1 could
live without them."
The Cubberley Cafe outdoor seating is

charming — garden path-style lights, delicate
tables and old-fashioned wastebaskets. In
doors. it is just as cozy.
On my visit, doctoral student Jong Lee sat
in an armchair with his usual-black coffee.
He comes "almost every day" for the com
fortable atmosphere and "just right" serving
sizes.
"Cubberley's cups are smaller than other
places'," Lee says, indicating his own short cof
fee. "They Ye just the right size."
Another draw:Torrefazione.
Manager Davennia Washington says their
coffee has "a different flavor."
"We carry Torrefazione Italia, and nobody
else has it on campus," she says.
cgiao!
Next, my thoughts turn to Italy, so I visit
Ciao!. It's a practical, quiet workspace, with
shiny tables and a pool-like fountain outside.
Customers buzz in and out. Ciao!, it seems, is a
dining oasis.
The specialty is LavAzza coffee latte.
"The latte is definitely our most popular
drink," says employee Hamilton Woods.
The enticing menu includes Tiramisu, gela
to, Panini and — of course — espresso.
"A lot of Italians come in; they love the cof
fee," Woods says.
"And friendly people work here!" exclaims
Violet Rosario, another employee.

1 reach Cafe DNA at "Happy Hour," the
time between 8 and 10 a.m. when the cafe's low
prices are further reduced.
"Our Happy Hour prices are the lowest on
campus," says employee Jose Bonilla, citing

that a "single latte, from 8-10, is $ 1.75."
Despite this attraction, Bonilla estimates
that only 5 percent of customers are students.
"It's a secret place," he says.
The cafe is in a bright atrium. Potted plants
are arranged around wicker tables, couches
and armchairs. It has a Tahiti-like atmosphere,
except the scent wafting through is not co
conut, but rather Sodium Hypochlorite.
Drinking my Moschetti-brand coffee. I real
ize I don't want to leave.
c Tbe cfjafe
The Cafe at the Arrillaga Alumni Center is
both tasteful and tasty. Sunlight streams
through the windows onto tables decorated
with old pictures. I expect to see an artist brood
ing in the corner.
"Our coffee is better than Starbucks, basi
cally," says employee Pierre Ugur. "And we
make everything from espresso to mocha to
cappuccino."
I take my coffee outside. Here, palm trees
soar above a fountain. It's like a high-tech clear
ing in a rainforest.
"I love studying in the garden — it's peace
ful and really nice," says senior Jenna Boiler.
Boiler adds that "they have wireless out
there, so you can check email while you're
working."
Sports c Bafe
At Jimmy V's Sports Cafe, sports channels
play on TVs and football helmets serve for dec
oration.
Senior athletes Matt Haryasz and Dan
Grunfeld are brunching with their friend Julian
Pena.
"We're here four days a week," Haryasz

says. "It's a real comfortable atmosphere. You
see a lot of your friends come through "
The boys skipped coffee today but not for
lack of selection or quality.
"We're a mini-Peet's," says owner Jimmy V
himself. "We don't carry beans, but we have all
the coffees."
That includes those irresistible mocha milk
shakes, of which 1 partake. Mmmm.
1 vow to return for Thursday's special — 14-
inch burritos for $5.
(Bytes «6afe
1 jump decades into the future at Bytes.The
chairs alone are like nothing I've ever seen.
Laptops hum on indoor and outdoor tables.
The line of customers stretches to the door, but
moves quickly, and I'm soon served my Boca
burger Panini.
The cafe's star, though, is the coffee.
"Our beans are individually oak-wood
roasted before they're blended," says employ
ee Jeff Peirano.
The result is beans with a "soft, subtle fin
ish," which make milder, less bitter coffee.
"People come from all over campus be
cause they like the coffee so much," Peirano
;ickls.
"I've been coming here since I was an un
dergrade says statistics master's student
Daniela Witten.
I'm given a sample — a cappuccino. A
multi-colored swirl spins across the foam.
"The secret," says Peirano,"is to mix a little
coffee in with the foam."
As I sip my cappuccino and gaze upon the
infinite whiteness of the Packard Electrical En
gineering Building, I can't help but wonder —
could this be heaven?

prices are further reduced.
"Our Happy Hour prices are the lowest on
campus," says employee Jose Bonilla, citing

that a "single latte, from 8-10, is $ 1.75."
Despite this attraction, Bonilla estimates
that only 5 percent of customers are students.
"It's a secret place," he says.
The cafe is in a bright atrium. Potted plants
are arranged around wicker tables, couches

0H0" was my first Stanford
word and unfortunately, dur
ing my earliest months here,
my first and only coffee
source, too. I dabbled in Peet's, the Bookstore
and Moonbeans, of course, but for the most part
my reflex about where to go for coffee? CoHo.
As my tastes matured, I longed for new ex
periences. 1 wanted variety, atmosphere culture
— and I wanted better tasting coffee.
So this week, I resolved — No Go CoHo. I
will branch out and explore other sources for
my caffeine fix.
Olives
My first stop is Olives. The cafe accommo
dates customers with indoor and outdoor seat
ing, a convenient location behind the history
corner and — the big bonus — the fact that
you can use meal plan points. The staff will also
modify any drink on their menu.
"Students will say 'Hey, can you make this?'
and we'll do it; we'll do whatever it is to try to
please the palate," says employee Lupe Pena.
Pena cites sugar-free options as one very
popular accommodation and offers me a sugar
free, soy milk chai latte,so I can see why for my
self. It's delicious and tastes more like tea than
any sickly-sweet alternative I've had else
where.
The cafe teems with regulars, among them
freshman Sarah Vick.
"I have my scone and soy latte from Olives
every single day," she says."I don't think 1 could
live without them."
The Cubberley Cafe outdoor seating is

charming — garden path-style lights, delicate
tables and old-fashioned wastebaskets. In
doors. it is just as cozy.
On my visit, doctoral student Jong Lee sat
in an armchair with his usual-black coffee.
He comes "almost every day" for the com
fortable atmosphere and "just right" serving
sizes.
"Cubberley's cups are smaller than other
places'," Lee says, indicating his own short cof
fee. "They Ye just the right size."
Another draw:Torrefazione.
Manager Davennia Washington says their
coffee has "a different flavor."
"We carry Torrefazione Italia, and nobody
else has it on campus," she says.
cgiao!
Next, my thoughts turn to Italy, so I visit
Ciao!. It's a practical, quiet workspace, with
shiny tables and a pool-like fountain outside.
Customers buzz in and out. Ciao!, it seems, is a
dining oasis.
The specialty is LavAzza coffee latte.
"The latte is definitely our most popular
drink," says employee Hamilton Woods.
The enticing menu includes Tiramisu, gela
to, Panini and — of course — espresso.
"A lot of Italians come in; they love the cof
fee," Woods says.
"And friendly people work here!" exclaims
Violet Rosario, another employee.
