# Weather too gray? Diversions to save for a rainy day
## 
### JANET KIM 
With the winter quarter in full swing, many
Stanford students are discovering a drizzly
season that is nowhere to be found in convinc
ingly sunny University brochures. Though
winter rain in California is relatively mild, it
nonetheless encourages many students to
cancel plans and loiter in dorms, avoiding pro
ductivity and wet bicycle seats. Slightly more
adventurous students frequent the CoHo,
measuring rainy days by used teabags and ex
ponentially decreasing mealpoints.To combat
this atypical winter lethargy. The Daily ex
plores some activities that are overlooked in
fairer weather and which may be enjoyed in
this season.
Visiting the Cantor Art Center
Located in the far, northerly reaches of
campus, the Cantor Art Center may seem like
an inconvenient location to visit on a rainy
day. The center, however, provides an appro
priate combination of entertainment, culture
and ambiance for those who brave the jour
ney. In addition to an extensive collection of
world art, the museum features themed ex
hibits, like "Fired at Davis: Figurative Ceram
ic Sculpture," a collection of ceramics created
by students and professors at the University
of California at Davis, and "American ABC:

Childhood in 19th-century America," a col
lection of paintings depicting childhood in a
dynamic, turbulent century.
Freshman Ruth McCann is among those
who visit Cantor for a less obvious reason —
to read.
"It's the best place on campus to read,
hands down," McCann notes. She was refer
ring to the orange sofas on the second floor of
the museum; there are two. each adjacent to a
main window, providing for well-lit reading
spaces. They are cleanly used and frequently
empty, and people-watchers may appreciate
the occasional murmurs that sound from mu
seum patrons on the first floor.
The Cool Cafe on the first story provides a
more conventional setting for readers and
chatters, as well as a wall-to-wall window
through which to watch the falling rain and a
selection of gourmet desserts, sandwiches and
salads.
Rock Climbing at the Arrillaga Center
for Sports and Recreation
For the physically active, the Arrillaga
Center for Sports and Recreation's rock
climbing complex offers a welcome diversion
from the rain. The complex, which has walls
that are 26 feet tall and 50 feet deep, can ac
commodate 30 to 40 climbers comfortably
and makes for a stimulating workout.

"Rock climbing is an excellent sport to do
on rainy days," says Dan Arnold, head instruc
tor of rock climbing. "It's a real sport, the best
sport."
Menesha Mannapperuma, a sophomore
majoring in history, agreed.
"Climbing provides excellent strength
training and endurance training and it's fun."
she says.
Budding climbers can visit the rock-climb
ing complex from 3 to 10:45 p.m. Monday
through Thursday, and 2 to 8 p.m. on Friday.
Shoe rentals cost two dollars and climbing in
structors provide education on climbing tech
niques and safety precautions.
Discovering Campus: Marguerite
Privileges, the Hoover Tower
Observation Deck
The vastness of the campus can handicap
efforts to become intimately acquainted with
Stanford's geography. There are multiple so
lutions to remedy this problem during the
rainy season; the Marguerite, Stanford's
friendly shuttle system, is one way to improve
one's familiarity with important campus desti
nations. Not only are the buses a dry, comfort
able way to navigate the Stanford campus, but
they are also equipped with announcement
systems that are informative and accurate.
Enjoy the full tour of the Stanford campus.

and finally find answers to compelling, years
old questions like: do the A and B lines ever
intersect? Where does the C line go? How
many roundtrips can one passenger make be
fore the bus driver finally becomes suspi
cious?
The more impatient may prefer discover
ing campus through the Hoover Tower Obser
vation Deck. Despite the fact that students
and their immediate family members are ad
mitted free to the observation deck, few take
advantage of this privilege.
"There are a lot of seniors in the spring
who come to the tower before they graduate,
who say they haven't been here in their entire
Stanford careers," says junior Galen Thomp
son, who works at the Hoover Tower's infor
mation center. A short elevator ride takes vis
itors to the top of the tower, where a spectac
ular view of the campus and the neighboring
bay area is available.
For students who insist on discovery
through first-hand experience, senior Govind
Persad offers a solution.
"I try to walk home without getting wet."
he says."I walk through buildings, and under
roofs and trees: it's a challenge, but it's fun.
and it brings me places that I haven't been be
fore. Once, I stopped under a palm tree in the
middle of the quad and looked up at the rain.
It was gorgeous. And I was still dry."

Discovering Campus: Marguerite
Privileges, the Hoover Tower
Observation Deck
The vastness of the campus can handicap
efforts to become intimately acquainted with
Stanford's geography. There are multiple so
lutions to remedy this problem during the
rainy season; the Marguerite, Stanford's
friendly shuttle system, is one way to improve
one's familiarity with important campus desti
nations. Not only are the buses a dry, comfort
able way to navigate the Stanford campus, but
they are also equipped with announcement
systems that are informative and accurate.
Enjoy the full tour of the Stanford campus.

and finally find answers to compelling, years
old questions like: do the A and B lines ever
intersect? Where does the C line go? How
many roundtrips can one passenger make be
fore the bus driver finally becomes suspi
cious?
The more impatient may prefer discover
ing campus through the Hoover Tower Obser
vation Deck. Despite the fact that students
and their immediate family members are ad
mitted free to the observation deck, few take
advantage of this privilege.
"There are a lot of seniors in the spring
who come to the tower before they graduate,
who say they haven't been here in their entire
Stanford careers," says junior Galen Thomp
son, who works at the Hoover Tower's infor
mation center. A short elevator ride takes vis
itors to the top of the tower, where a spectac
ular view of the campus and the neighboring
bay area is available.
For students who insist on discovery
through first-hand experience, senior Govind
Persad offers a solution.
"I try to walk home without getting wet."
he says."I walk through buildings, and under
roofs and trees: it's a challenge, but it's fun.
and it brings me places that I haven't been be
fore. Once, I stopped under a palm tree in the
middle of the quad and looked up at the rain.
It was gorgeous. And I was still dry."
