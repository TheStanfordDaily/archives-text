## Editorial Labor deal is promising 
### 
We applaud the administration and
SEIU 715 for reaching a deal re
garding the recent disagreements
on pensions. In doing so, they avoided the im
pending occurrence of another strike. Per
haps most importantly, their compromises
provided an encouraging model for future
disputes. Both sides showed a willingness to
make concessions in order to reach an agree
ment and move forward. We hope that this
pattern continues as the University and
union begin negotiations this summer for a
new contract.
Wages and other benefits have yet to be
renegotiated, but we are optimistic that co
operation the two parties will continue. The
current contract, set to expire Sept. 1, can
and should be carefully discussed, especially
with regard to the remaining points of con
tention. However, the discussions should be
cordial; we hope the recent goodwill exhibit
ed by both parties can continue this summer.
Middle ground should be sought, and both
sides should again be willing to compromise
for the good of all involved.

Although the Dec. 12 served its purpose
in raising awareness of workers' contract ne
gotiation issues, we hope that such actions
are not a precedent for future contract rene
gotiations. Having successfully compro
mised in a way satisfactory to both the uni
versity and roughly 92 percent of workers,
we believe that this demonstrates the concil
iatory efforts by both sides are realistic and
that an uncontroversial ending to contract
negotiations is achievable.
The University highlighted during the
strike how generous its pension and benefits
are compared to comparable employers. For
the most part, we agree, and the recently an
nounced deal reconfirms the University's
genuine effort to provide its workers with
competitive and satisfactory employment
packages. Stanford Labor Action Coalition,
which supported workers during the strike
with demonstrations and education efforts,
strives to remind students that university
workers are a vital part of this campus. As
shown by the recent agreement, we're glad
that the University recognizes this.
