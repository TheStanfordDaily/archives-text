# Fair-weather fans
## 
### 
Are you sitting down? Have you had
your blood pressure checked recent
ly? Are all sharp or pointy objects
well out of reach? We're not trying to scare
you off; we're just trying to give you fair
warning, because believe it or not, your fa
vorite Daily columnists have done it again.
Faithful readers of "Spacey Sports" will
probably be shocked by the following re
port. After all, we've built our reputations on
the "other side of athletics" platform, paying
little attention to mainstream college (or
professional, for that matter) athletics. But
at least one of us could hold out no longer.
Drum roll, please.
Cassidy has become a Steelers fan.
No, maybe that's an inaccurate state
ment. Cassidy hails from Pittsburgh, a city
famous for its passionate, steel-town love af
fair with the game of football; a place where
backing the wrong football team (i.e., any
team that isn't the Steelers) can get'you a
swift kick in all the wrong places. So no, Cas
sidy did not "just become" a Steelers fan. It's
always been in her blood — it's just been
dormant for a very, very long time.
So what brought it out? Flash back to two
weeks ago, the day of the final playoff game
between the Steelers and the Broncos with
kickoff only hours away. Cassidy knows in
her heart of hearts that the game starts at 2
p.m., so she's been preparing herself all day
— finishing work, making snacks, poring
over the sports page. She waits with bated
breath for the clock to change — 1:30, 1:45,
1:50 — at I:sB,she can't take it anymore and
she flips on the television. Crap. The game
started at noon.
Unfazed by this minor setback, she sits
back in her chair, intent as ever, only to find it
is halftime. Hoping to at least catch a glimpse
of the flashing lights and glamorous celebri
ties in the halftime show, she is disappointed
to find that it is not being televised. Apparent
ly after having Ashlee Simpson booed off the
stage and Janet Jackson flashing her "stage
presence" all over the field, network execu
tives are somewhat reluctant to place unnec
essary focus on these festivities.
When the game finally resumes, the heat
is on. With the Steelers already in the lead,
they are really asserting their dominance on
the field. What a pass! What a catch! Touch
down! The excitement is enough to make
any Pittsburgh fan jump, scream and even
lose bladder control. Meanwhile, though the
direction in which Cassidy's head is facing
says that she's paying attention to the action,
the dull, glazed-over look in her eyes seems
to suggest otherwise. Then the light snoring
confirms it — she's fallen asleep with her
eyes open.
Preposterous! Steve Madden would be
rollingoverinhisgraveifhesawthisdisgusting

lack ofenthusiasm.What? Steve Madden isn't
dead? 0h... well, whatever,yougetthepoint.
With a snort and quick jolt, Cassidy re
gains consciousness. In an effort to get into
the football mood, she starts to mimic the
behaviors she has seen other football fans
exhibit as the TV flashes in front of them.
Eyes glued to the screen, she smashes a few
chips into her mouth, allowing half the
crumbs to drop sloppily in her lap. She
grunts a few times. She screams obscenities.
She scratches her... self.
Once she really feels one with the game,
Cassidy gets bold and starts making astute
comments such as "00h... that guy threw the
ball to the wrong guy" and, "See... even the
refs are Steelers fans. They keep throwing
Terrible Towels on the field!" Somewhere in
the fourth quarter, as the clock edges closer
to zero, it finally dawns on her: "Hey, we're
winning by a lot, aren't we? Hey, we might
win. Hey, we won! Weeeee!" (Yes, sadly
enough, Cassidy says "weee" when she
thinks she should be excited.)
And with that, Cassidy joined the ranks
of the few, the proud — the fair-weather
fans.
Now Cassidy's not just any fair-weather
fan. She doesn't sit through games for
"Partly Cloudy" or "Clear but Muggy." Ba
sically, the air must be cloudless, the sun
must be shining, the temperature must be
79 degrees and cupcakes have to fall from
the sky before she'll give in to that band
wagon bullhonkey and give a "hell yeah"
for the home team.
Alright, so you get that Cassidy's knowl
edge of football is such that a month or two
ago, it would have been questionable
whether or not she was actually aware that a
professional football team existed in Pitts
burgh. That is one fact that we've pretty
much drilled into the ground. And you know
that Cassidy's blind hometown love will
shine this Sunday. So just what exactly is our
point, you ask? You know...you'd think we'd
have one. Have a safe weekend, everyone,
and enjoy Super Bowl Sunday.

Are you sitting down? Have you had
your blood pressure checked recent
ly? Are all sharp or pointy objects
well out of reach? We're not trying to scare
you off; we're just trying to give you fair
warning, because believe it or not, your fa
vorite Daily columnists have done it again.
Faithful readers of "Spacey Sports" will
probably be shocked by the following re
port. After all, we've built our reputations on
the "other side of athletics" platform, paying
little attention to mainstream college (or
professional, for that matter) athletics. But
at least one of us could hold out no longer.
Drum roll, please.
Cassidy has become a Steelers fan.
No, maybe that's an inaccurate state
ment. Cassidy hails from Pittsburgh, a city
famous for its passionate, steel-town love af
fair with the game of football; a place where
backing the wrong football team (i.e., any
team that isn't the Steelers) can get'you a
swift kick in all the wrong places. So no, Cas
sidy did not "just become" a Steelers fan. It's
always been in her blood — it's just been
dormant for a very, very long time.
So what brought it out? Flash back to two
weeks ago, the day of the final playoff game
between the Steelers and the Broncos with
kickoff only hours away. Cassidy knows in
her heart of hearts that the game starts at 2
p.m., so she's been preparing herself all day
— finishing work, making snacks, poring
over the sports page. She waits with bated
breath for the clock to change — 1:30, 1:45,
1:50 — at I:sB,she can't take it anymore and
she flips on the television. Crap. The game
started at noon.
Unfazed by this minor setback, she sits
back in her chair, intent as ever, only to find it
is halftime. Hoping to at least catch a glimpse
of the flashing lights and glamorous celebri
ties in the halftime show, she is disappointed
to find that it is not being televised. Apparent
ly after having Ashlee Simpson booed off the
stage and Janet Jackson flashing her "stage
presence" all over the field, network execu
tives are somewhat reluctant to place unnec
essary focus on these festivities.
When the game finally resumes, the heat
is on. With the Steelers already in the lead,
they are really asserting their dominance on
the field. What a pass! What a catch! Touch
down! The excitement is enough to make
any Pittsburgh fan jump, scream and even
lose bladder control. Meanwhile, though the
direction in which Cassidy's head is facing
says that she's paying attention to the action,
the dull, glazed-over look in her eyes seems
to suggest otherwise. Then the light snoring
confirms it — she's fallen asleep with her
eyes open.
Preposterous! Steve Madden would be
rollingoverinhisgraveifhesawthisdisgusting

lack ofenthusiasm.What? Steve Madden isn't
dead? 0h... well, whatever,yougetthepoint.
With a snort and quick jolt, Cassidy re
gains consciousness. In an effort to get into
the football mood, she starts to mimic the
behaviors she has seen other football fans
exhibit as the TV flashes in front of them.
Eyes glued to the screen, she smashes a few
chips into her mouth, allowing half the
crumbs to drop sloppily in her lap. She
grunts a few times. She screams obscenities.
She scratches her... self.
Once she really feels one with the game,
Cassidy gets bold and starts making astute
comments such as "00h... that guy threw the
ball to the wrong guy" and, "See... even the
refs are Steelers fans. They keep throwing
Terrible Towels on the field!" Somewhere in
the fourth quarter, as the clock edges closer
to zero, it finally dawns on her: "Hey, we're
winning by a lot, aren't we? Hey, we might
win. Hey, we won! Weeeee!" (Yes, sadly
enough, Cassidy says "weee" when she
thinks she should be excited.)
And with that, Cassidy joined the ranks
of the few, the proud — the fair-weather
fans.
Now Cassidy's not just any fair-weather
fan. She doesn't sit through games for
"Partly Cloudy" or "Clear but Muggy." Ba
sically, the air must be cloudless, the sun
must be shining, the temperature must be
79 degrees and cupcakes have to fall from
the sky before she'll give in to that band
wagon bullhonkey and give a "hell yeah"
for the home team.
Alright, so you get that Cassidy's knowl
edge of football is such that a month or two
ago, it would have been questionable
whether or not she was actually aware that a
professional football team existed in Pitts
burgh. That is one fact that we've pretty
much drilled into the ground. And you know
that Cassidy's blind hometown love will
shine this Sunday. So just what exactly is our
point, you ask? You know...you'd think we'd
have one. Have a safe weekend, everyone,
and enjoy Super Bowl Sunday.
