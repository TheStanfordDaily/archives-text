I am of the Cayuga Nation of the Haudenosaunee
(Iroquois) Confederacy and Dine (Navajo) Nation. I
hope to appeal to the reason and common sense of the
Stanford community with the aim of promoting peace
with respect to the recent mascot issues.
The NCAA is currently enforcing a policy of keeping
schools with mascots deemed "hostile and abusive" from
hosting championship events. Some schools have felt it
necessary to appeal the NCAA's ruling in their respective
cases. Florida State, Central Michigan and Utah universi
ties have won their appeals, largely on the basis that their
mascots have the approval of the nations involved.
In the case of the University of Illinois, however, there
exists no such nation, for the school uses the symbol —
not mascot — "Chief Illiniwek." According to
Wikipedia, the Illiniwek people were largely wiped out
by other indigenous nations rather than by European ag
gression, which begs the question: who can Chief Illini
wek offend? A non-Native student wears a costume —

another troublesome term — sold to the university by an
Oglala Sioux chief named Frank Fools Crow and per
forms a dance that has its origins in Indian Lore studied
by former Boy Scouts at the university, to the song "Three
in One." So, do the Boy Scouts or Mr. Fools Crow have
the right to fabricate a personality claiming Indigenous
origin? And is the NCAA the body to answer that ques
tion?
It's not hard to think of an Asian analogy that would
justifiably enrage many casual onlookers. Curiously, I
don't think a European analogy would have as much
force, which I think raises deeper, more important ques
tions. Why did people at the University of Illinois feel the
need to take on the identity of Indigenous people? What
drives these students to dig up their "Indian Lore" Boy
Scout manual or fundraise for a Chief Illiniwek costume?
Why not dress up like Prime Minister Winston Churchill
or fabricate some fictional European leader instead?
