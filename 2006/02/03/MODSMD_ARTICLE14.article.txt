## The 						decline of reverence 
### KIMBALL BIGHORSE 
I am of the Cayuga Nation of the Haudenosaunee
(Iroquois) Confederacy and Dine (Navajo) Nation. I
hope to appeal to the reason and common sense of the
Stanford community with the aim of promoting peace
with respect to the recent mascot issues.
The NCAA is currently enforcing a policy of keeping
schools with mascots deemed "hostile and abusive" from
hosting championship events. Some schools have felt it
necessary to appeal the NCAA's ruling in their respective
cases. Florida State, Central Michigan and Utah universi
ties have won their appeals, largely on the basis that their
mascots have the approval of the nations involved.
In the case of the University of Illinois, however, there
exists no such nation, for the school uses the symbol —
not mascot — "Chief Illiniwek." According to
Wikipedia, the Illiniwek people were largely wiped out
by other indigenous nations rather than by European ag
gression, which begs the question: who can Chief Illini
wek offend? A non-Native student wears a costume —

another troublesome term — sold to the university by an
Oglala Sioux chief named Frank Fools Crow and per
forms a dance that has its origins in Indian Lore studied
by former Boy Scouts at the university, to the song "Three
in One." So, do the Boy Scouts or Mr. Fools Crow have
the right to fabricate a personality claiming Indigenous
origin? And is the NCAA the body to answer that ques
tion?
It's not hard to think of an Asian analogy that would
justifiably enrage many casual onlookers. Curiously, I
don't think a European analogy would have as much
force, which I think raises deeper, more important ques
tions. Why did people at the University of Illinois feel the
need to take on the identity of Indigenous people? What
drives these students to dig up their "Indian Lore" Boy
Scout manual or fundraise for a Chief Illiniwek costume?
Why not dress up like Prime Minister Winston Churchill
or fabricate some fictional European leader instead?
Dr. Richard Grounds recently stated in an interview
with The Stanford Daily that "'the
curious thing of playing Indian'
started while the genocide [of in
digenous peoples] was being carried
out" (Nov. 14, 2005). He said this
after showing a 1913 catalog offering
skulls of Mound-builder people for
sale according to condition to a
group of students. He went on to
argue that mascots are an attempt to
usurp the identities of the massacred
in order to assuage the national con
science of the conquerors, who claim
to stand for equality and freedom.
Thus Natives become caricatures,
fictional cartoon characters and cos
tumes (or T-shirts) to be worn bv the

conquerors — anything but real, liv
ing, breathing people.
1 think it should trouble us as ed
ucated members of society that as re
cently as our grandparents' genera
tion, human skulls were bought and
sold like baseball cards. Somehow
the sense of sacredness of human re
mains was lost. Once much of what is
sacred is lost, whether national iden
tity or religion or human life itself, it
leaves a void in the hearts and souls
of people and they fill that void with
whatever they see fit, sometimes
without regard for what others hold
sacred for themselves.
1 suggest we take a moment to
reflect on what we truly revere. Do
we watch NFL football or play on
line poker religiously? Perhaps we
hold sacred our daily run or a year
ly retreat. What would stir the very
deepest passions of your heart and

soul were it to be defaced or pub
licly mocked or taken away? Your
car, your degree or, maybe, your
family? Beyond taking stock of
yourself, try to appreciate that other
people have different lists from
your own, each of which needs to be
respected and even honored. If your
list is short or full of superfluous
things, perhaps it's time to do some
deeper thinking. And if your list is
mutually exclusive with too many
other people's lists, maybe it's time
to revise it, especially if someone
else has died for what's on their list.
As future leaders and educated peo
ple, I hope that we would all eagerly
and happily respect and honor what
others revere.
