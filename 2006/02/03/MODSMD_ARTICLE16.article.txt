# Most improved columnists, least improved human beings

Free food. Morbid curiosity. A vague
sense of obligation to a student group
you are only peripherally involved in.
You look around and you see yourself in the
eyes of the silent, freshman Asian twins to
whom you have just introduced yourself. You
are callous and experienced and condescend
ing. You realize that neither curiosity, nor de
lectable edibles, nor even duty could possibly
justify your presence here. If you haven't
found yourself in this situation, you haven't
been at Stanford long enough.
Last Saturday night we found ourselves,
once again, in this situation. We slouched in
conspicuously — one in aviator sunglasses in
an already dimly-lit room and one in pseudo
intellectual corduroy and plaid — against the
wall where we entertain suitors and admirers.
We are the life of the party.The Daily end-of
volume party.
Squeezing two extra chairs into an already
overflowing table, we smartened ourselves
up and gave in to the awkwardness. We were
faced with a choice: We could either go into
middle-school social anxiety disorder mode,
or make complete fools of ourselves. We pro
ceeded to do the latter. With gusto.
In less than 10 minutes, we began to hate
ourselves.Telling other people's drinking sto
ries. Propping up failing conversation with
inane questions. And perhaps the worst part of
it was the perverse enjoyment of how easy it
was to charm and smarm our way through this
ail-too familiar scene.
We demanded to be introduced to our one
self-professed fan. who launched into a
slurred motivational speech: "I know what
it's like to bust your ass, day in and day out,
and no one appreciates what you're doing. I
just want you to know I know what it's like."

Our asses hurt just thinking about it.
Neither the flattery — nor the advice —
is likely to go to our heads. Our editors, whom
we flocked to among the anonymous faces,
have asked us how we managed to get posi
tions at The Daily, after all. The kinder one of
them tries to soften that with the backhand
ed compliment about how we are "hands
down Tlie Daily's most improved colum
nists," with our "freshly cliched" take on
Stanford standards. We were complimented,
insulted and one-upped all over the place.
We don't know which made us feel better
— the honest evaluation of our work or the
half-serious attempts at come-ons that seem
to be standard operating procedure for
physics graduate students the world over. We
turned away from them to our favorite colum
nist, who also may or may not have been hit
ting on us. He regaled us with his rejection of a
life of poetry and contemplation, in favor of a
position at Google.The New York branch. He
was wearing a black ribbed turtleneck. And
even in the darkened corner, his hair still
shined.
Leaning against that wall, looking into the
cubist collage of faces, we realize finally that
we've become a mockery of ourselves. A re
alization that is not as disheartening as it
sounds. As freshmen, we didn't know enough

about our character to mock ourselves. In
four years, we've solidified had habits, addic
tions, dependencies, mannerisms, the whole
spiel about where we'll be after graduation.
We've come a long way. There's that age-old
adage that the soul, after all, is not given, but
crafted. Just as we're about to take some
meaningful, philosophical lesson from this
absurdist experience — this embarrassing
exaggeration of personality —we realize
that writing about our souls in a Daily col
umn is an altogether horrible idea.
Instead, we leave you with a parting image.
The following is an instruction for how to cre
ate your very own awkward party — your
own Daily banquet in your own home:
1. Invite your friends' significant others
without inviting your friends.
2. Invite your RCC who was always brag
ging about how he had the biggest porn col
lection at Stanford.
3. Play nothing but schlock B-side ballads
from the 19705.
4. Sit your guests in a large circle and don't
let them eat until everyone knows everyone
else's name.
5. Create a purposeful dearth of hors
d'oeuvres.
6. Serve only Everclear and O'Douls, and
insist that your guests can only drink water
via body shots.
7. Sit the most talkative person you know
next to your acquaintance who never talks,
but merely moves his eyes in circles to cause
a vague sense of impending doom.
8. Lock the doors. We are horrible people.

We're throwing a party Friday night. E-mail us
at robinp@stanford.edu and mhutcher@stan
ford.edu if you want to come.
