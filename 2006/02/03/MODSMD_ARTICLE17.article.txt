Is that comedy?
"Comedy" about the fitness ben
efit of hunting women for the pur
pose of sexual assault and rape?
"Jokes" that recommend young girls
raise their self-esteem by selling
their bodies as prostitutes instead of
giving them away for free? "Humor"
about supporting 'third world' chil
dren from Rwanda at reduced rates
because they're missing a few body
parts? If none of that strikes you as
funny,then perhaps the comedy rou
tine delivered by host Ryan Stout at
The 750 is not the place to be. It's a
pity, because several of the comedi
ans at the GSPB-hosted comedy
night were talented and funny, un
like Stout, who just left a bad taste in
the mouth.
Perhaps the Graduate Student
Programming Board should pay a
little more attention to the content
of comedians' routines that they
host. And maybe as an audience.

Stanford students should be more
discerning. The majority of us greet
ed Stout's routine with sheepish
smiles; it was as if we were afraid to
offend a comic who was being gross
ly offensive and derogatory. Next
time, I'd like to see genuinely funny
comic routines at The 750 comedy
night, not a despicable outpouring of
twisted and sick "humor" that ap
plauds criminal and horrifying acts.

We are not a mascot
Many people cease to under
stand the problem American Indi
ans have with the mascot or with
other inaccurate images of Indian
people. While I cannot speak for all
American Indians — because we
are not one lump sum. we do differ
by tribe, language and traditions —
1 can tell you why I mind. Every day
of my life, I am American Indian.

I've lived the majority of my life on
or near a reservation. I am connect
ed to the traditional ways of my peo
ple, and I honor and respect my eld
ers. I am American Indian.
I mind that my identity as an
American Indian at Stanford has
only been recognized by non-Amer
ican Indian people once, and that
was when I wore my moccasins, a
shawl and a feather in my hair for
the traditional senior honor song
during the Stanford Powwow. On
my return to the dorm that evening,
I heard numerous times: "Wow, you
really look Indian today."
No, I look Indian everyday, be
cause I am Indian everyday. What
those individuals meant was that I
suddenly resembled some of the
countless images of Indians used
as mascots or as television charac
ters. As a result, I suddenly
seemed authentic to them. My
problem with images of Indians as
mascots or in the media is largely
due to the fact that those images
provide for other people an un
derstanding of how an Indian
"should" look and behave. When I
fail to conform to these standards,
my identity as an Indian is not
seen as valid by other people.
I mind that some American Indi
an people will give in to images of In
dian mascots by saying: "I would
rather be a mascot than be invisible."
I find it sad that, to some extent, this
is actually true. If American Indians
are not being made fun of — be
cause it doesn't honor me to see a

comical and inaccurate version of my
ancestral people — then they just
don't exist in the eyes of other peo
ple.
I've sat on the plane back to New
Mexico many times and heard peo
ple comment about how they are ex
cited to finally see "real Indians." A
real Indian is sitting right next to
them, but without my feather and
my moccasins, I'm invisible and I
mind. Back in high school I use to
work at the Visitor's Center on the
reservation, and people would stop
by and ask: "Where are all the Indi
ans?" We are actually all around. We
are students, doctors, lawyers, teach
ers, politicians, university faculty, au
thors — we're a lot of things, but we
are not a mascot!
