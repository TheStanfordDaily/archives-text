## Hamas victory threatens Middle East 
### PHILIP NARODICK 
Right now, Palestine and Israel
seem to be reaching the latest fork
in the long road toward peace. Israel
had experienced 10 suicide bomb
ings or other bombing attacks in
2005, most of which were claimed by
Palestinian terrorist groups. Yet de
spite the frequent violence and ir
reverence by these separatist
groups toward the peace process,
the Israeli government made a mo
mentous and highly controversial
move to withdraw all settlements
from the Gaza Strip — a move that
prompted mass protests within the
country.
At the dawn of 2006, the people
of Israel sit in a very vulnerable and
interesting position. They have just
withdrawn from the Gaza Strip in a
show of support for the peace
process, their prime minister is in a
coma and they have just suffered the
first suicide bombing of the year —
an explosion in a crowded restau
rant that injured 21 people.
Yet it seems as though Palestine

took the other fork in the road. In
stead of taking advantage of this
unique opportunity in which Israel is
both vulnerable and interested in
stopping violence by making a ges
ture of peace, Palestine elected the
largest terrorist group in the area to
run the government. No, that's not an
error — Palestine is now run by the
terrorist group Hamas.
Has Palestine lost all of its credi
bility by becoming an official terror
ist government? How can Palestine
respond to Israel's historic and long
awaited withdrawal from Gaza by
giving a terrorist group power? I'm
not trying to hide from the plight of
Palestinians behind the Bush-ist
shieid of "The War on Terror," I'm
just both disappointed at the out
come of the elections and asking: Is it
ethical for us to support a govern
ment that makes so little effort to
ward peace?
