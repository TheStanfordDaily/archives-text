# Search engines shouldn't censor
## 
### AVI TUSCHMAN 
Why does it matter if the new Chi
nese version of Google's search en
gine censors Web pages with terms
such as "freedom" or "democracy"?
One reason is that freedom of infor
mation affects how much it costs to
manufacture goods in China. A Chi
nese business can cut costs by pollut
ing and violating human rights with
impunity if it is unaccountable to a
free press; the rest of the world pays
the price of these externalities, such
as global warming and illness. Mean
while, markets flooded with under
priced Chinese goods undermine our
economy.
Legitimate communications
media in China must also ensure that
corruption does not jeopardize free
trade. Beijing's censorship seeks to
hide tens of thousands of protests
that occur in China every year. Un
derreported civil unrest can build up
and create instability detrimental to
foreign investment in the long run. In
the short term, as China benefits
from free trade, Google (as well as
Yahoo and Microsoft) should not
sabotage in China the same rules
that companies doing business in
democracies must follow.

A strong argument for doing busi
ness with China has been to make
the country more democratic; open
markets need free speech to function
efficiently. How has Google distort
ed this principle into the morally pa
thetic statement that access to some
information is better than access to
none? Much of the information on
sensitive topics that Google's filters
let through to the Chinese people is
Communist Party propaganda that
inverts reality.
The second reason that censorship
in China should alarm Americans is
that, since the same U.S. information
companies work for both govern
ments, U.S. citizens' cyber-privacy is
increasingly interconnected to that of
the Chinese people. Yahoo, for exam
ple. helped China prosecute a dissi
dent journalist by revealing the indi
vidual's personal records. ShiTao will
spend 10 years in jail for posting a
government order that bars the pub
lic discussion of the anniversary of the
Tiananmen Square massacre.
Yahoo has also divulged US. citi
zens' private information to the U.S.
government, an effort which began
under the pretext of "fighting
pornography."
Unlike Yahoo, Google has done

well by not caving in to pressure to
divulge the personal information to
the Bush administration. Neverthe
less, Google's collaboration in Chi
nese censorship makes a travesty of
the company's own "Don't be evil"
motto. For example, the company
helps the Communist Party hide the
genocide in Tibet that has killed over
a million people.
Such hypocrisy is like that of an
unscrupulous doctor who. breaking
the Hippocratic Oath not to harm
people, participates in torture in ad
dition to "normal" practice. Would
you want your physician to moon
light as a torturer? Would you want
the company that you trust with your
most intimate information to devel
op spying technologies that incarcer
ate Chinese citizens who express po
litical beliefs similar to your own?
If we turn a blind eye to our most
powerful information companies'
ethics in China, it is only a matter of
time before they use thesesamemech
anisms to invade the privacy of inno
cent U.S. citizens without a warrant.
Google and Yahoo.do the right thing.
