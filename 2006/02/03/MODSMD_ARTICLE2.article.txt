# LAZEAR APPOINTMENT
## Economists support Council nominee GSB Professor nominated to Council of Economic Advisors, awaits confirmation 
### JAMES HOHMANN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Both economists and colleagues have said
they widely support the confirmation of
Hoover senior fellow and Graduate School of
Business Prof. Edward Lazear to become
chairman of President W. Bush's Council of
Economic Advisers (CEA). Lazear, nominat-

Ed Monday, is lauded by those who have
worked with him as an energetic, brilliant and
level-headed economist who knows how to
communicate with non-academics. Lazear is
expected to strongly support the Bush eco
nomic agenda after his likely Senate confir
mation.
Economists of all political leanings who
know him said that Lazear is not un ideologue,
but rather a pragmatic economist focused on
data and empirics.
"Eddie is a free-market economist," said
Hoover Senior Fellow Kenneth Judd."He be
lieves that free markets are the best way to or
ganize an economy, and that the role of gov-

eminent is to provide the
foundation for those free
markets."
"I do not detect a sim

government is bad," said
Kenneth Arrow, Nobel

others. He has the view of
limiting government's role.

Paul Oyer, associate professor of economics

at the Graduate School of Business (GSB).
"He can really quickly grasp the economics
of a situation."

climate of the nations capitol.
"Eddie is a superb economist," said recent
CEA Chair and Harvard Economics Prof.
Greogry Mankiw in an email to The Daily."He
continues the long tradition of the CEA at
tracting top talent from academia into a period
of public service."

David Kreps, a senior associate dean at the
GSB and economics professor, called him
"extremely energetic" and a "great communi
cator."
Lazear "expresses his point of view very
forthrightly, and convinces you that it was (and
is) your point of view," he said.
Others concur that he is not the stereotypi
cal academic stuck in the Ivory Tower.
"He has a great style that will fit in with
Washington, Judd said. "He is quick on his
feet, and will express his ideas in a direct and
clear, hut personable manner. He is not a
