# LAZEAR APPOINTMENT
## Economists support Council nominee GSB Professor nominated to Council of Economic Advisors, awaits confirmation 
### JAMES HOHMANN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Both economists and colleagues have said
they widely support the confirmation of
Hoover senior fellow and Graduate School of
Business Prof. Edward Lazear to become
chairman of President W. Bush's Council of
Economic Advisers (CEA). Lazear, nominat-

Ed Monday, is lauded by those who have
worked with him as an energetic, brilliant and
level-headed economist who knows how to
communicate with non-academics. Lazear is
expected to strongly support the Bush eco
nomic agenda after his likely Senate confir
mation.
Economists of all political leanings who
know him said that Lazear is not un ideologue,
but rather a pragmatic economist focused on
data and empirics.
"Eddie is a free-market economist," said
Hoover Senior Fellow Kenneth Judd."He be
lieves that free markets are the best way to or
ganize an economy, and that the role of gov-

eminent is to provide the
foundation for those free
markets."
"I do not detect a sim
ple-minded reflex that the
government is bad," said
Kenneth Arrow, Nobel
laureate. "He sees the
government as important
in some areas and less in
others. He has the view of
limiting government's role.

but he's certainly not an extremist."
"He is not a right-wing ideologue," said
Paul Oyer, associate professor of economics

at the Graduate School of Business (GSB).
"He can really quickly grasp the economics
of a situation."
Lazear's Style
Colleagues said Lazear can relate to non
economists and has the types of skills neces
sary to be successful in the politically-charged
climate of the nations capitol.
"Eddie is a superb economist," said recent
CEA Chair and Harvard Economics Prof.
Greogry Mankiw in an email to The Daily."He
continues the long tradition of the CEA at
tracting top talent from academia into a period
of public service."

David Kreps, a senior associate dean at the
GSB and economics professor, called him
"extremely energetic" and a "great communi
cator."
Lazear "expresses his point of view very
forthrightly, and convinces you that it was (and
is) your point of view," he said.
Others concur that he is not the stereotypi
cal academic stuck in the Ivory Tower.
"He has a great style that will fit in with
Washington, Judd said. "He is quick on his
feet, and will express his ideas in a direct and
clear, hut personable manner. He is not a


LAZEAR
stuffy academic."
Lazear is thought by those who
have worked with him to have a calm
temperament and good composure,
important traits for Washington insid
ers.
White House Agenda
Observers wonder what might be
expected from Lazear if he becomes
chairman. Experts said that his past re
search interests should not necessarily
be a guide for the direction the White
House's economic policy may now
take. Instead, the CEA's research goals
have traditionally followed the political
agenda of the administration in power.
"He will focus on whatever the
president wants the CEA to think
about," Judd said. "The agenda of the
CEA is set by other people in Wash
ington. For example, one of its main,
but little publicized,jobs is to deal with
various government agencies and
their economic proposals.
"This is often like putting out fires
since government bureaucrats have
an unbounded ability to come up with
bad ideas, and the CEA members
have to spell out to them why their
ideas are not in the president's or
country's interest," he explained.
"This requires CEA members to
quickly grasp the essential economics
involved in these discussions and ex
plain the full economic implications of
alternative policies."
Others said the CEA will face the
challenge of recommending policies
that will keep the economy growing.
"I lis main responsibility will be to
give advice on how to keep the already
long economic expansion in the Unit
ed States going," said John Taylor,
Stanford economics professor and
Hoover senior fellow. "His expertise
in labor economics will be valuable
here, especially to communicate about
the importance of keeping the US.
labor markets flexible."
Kreps said he had no idea what
agenda Lazear will be given by the
White House. Based on the State of
the Union address, he guessed that
Lazear may immediately focus on so
cial security reform and energy policy.

He has a great style that will fit in with
Washington. He is not a stuffy academic.

KENNETH JUDD, Hoover Senior Fellow

"But that's up to his bosses," he
wrote.
Some said they expect that his past
interest in the labor market will have
an influence on his priorities if he is
confirmed.
"He may concentrate more on the
labor market than has been the case in
the past," Arrow said, citing the impact
of productivity gains as an example of
an issue he might examine. "This
would be a good thing."
Oyer speculated that Lazear might
focus on taxes, health care and social
security during his tenure in Washing
ton. He too reiterated that the issues
will ultimately be determined by
Bush's agenda.
CEA's Limited Authority
The CEA, often called the White
House's economics think tank, was
formed in 1946. Much of the council's
work is done behind the scenes, and
the three-member panel typically
gives advice to the president and sen
ior White House officials. Traditional
ly the chairman attends cabinet meet
ings as well.
One observer said that the CEA —
while still very important and highly
competent in the reporting it does — is
less influential than it was in the decades
immediately after its formation.
"The CEA has played a very sec
ondary role in policymaking for many
years," Arrow said.
He attributed some of this decline
in influence to the rogue actions of
CEA Chair Martin Fcldstein during
the first Ronald Reagan administra
tion. Feldstein publicly questioned
some of the White House economic
policy aims such as the large deficit
and consequently may have partially
damaged the prestige of the office.

Arrow said.
"As a result, the Council was kind
of shut out," he said. "It has happened
with every subsequent president. I
think that includes Bill Clinton."
Arrow added that the appreciation
of economics has become more wide
spread and other federal government
departments' economic analysis divi
sions have become more influential,
specifically the National Economic
Council and the Treasury Depart
ment.
"As a result, the CEA is just one
input into the economic process," he
added.
Perhaps symbolically, the CEA,
which used to be located immediately
adjacent to the White House, was
moved several blocks away.
Even though the Council may not
be as influential as it was before.
Arrow still believes it plays an impor
tant role in the formation of national
economic policy, asserting "the Coun
cil still has the economists with the
broadest view."
Arrow added that the CEA has
traditionally brought academics into
the realm of policymaking.
"The tradition of the Council is to
take important economists and infuse
them as policy makers," he said.
Tax Panel
Lazear was appointed to be a
member of the President's panel on
Tax Reform, which released its report
last year. Some speculate that Lazear
may have increased his visibility and
credibility with the administration
during this time.
Colleagues said the tax panel work
demonstrates that he knows how to
work well inside the Beltway.
"His recent service on the Bush

Tax Reform panel has made him an
expert on the tax system and how to
improve it." said Judd. "It is impossi
ble to separate his work from any of
the other members of the Panel.
Overall. 1 thought that the panel did
an excellent job of laying out the is
sues in their report."
Kreps wrote. "Ideologues on both
sides were unhappy, always a sign that
they did a good job," he wrote. "Seri
ously, if you look hard at it. you see a
lot of extremely sensible economics in
the proposals."
Research
As a professor at the Graduate
School of Business, Lazear has done
seminal groundbreaking work in both
theoretical and applied economics. He
is especially respected for his work on
personnel economics, a field that he is
credited for pioneering.
Arrow hailed Lazear's novel work
on micro-incentives for employees to
function well on behalf of firms, in
cluding his research into pay for top
executives.
"1 lis research centers on employee
i ncent i ves, prt >mot ions. compensati on.
and productivity in firms," reports the
GSB Web site. "His current research is
on entrepreneurship, leadership, and
its relation to personnel economics."
Lazear teaches three courses: "In
centives and Productivity," "Research
Methods in Economics" and "Person
nel Economics."
Stanford Kconomics
Lazear. who has been a senior fel
low at the Hoover Institution since
1985 and a professor at GSB since
1992. was appointed to fill the position
vacated by Ben Bernanke, who was
confirmed as chairman of the federal
Reserve's Board of Governors this
week. Bernanke taught economics at
Stanford from 1979 to 14K5.
Last Friday, Bush nominated Stan
ford alumnus Kevin Warsh to serve as
a member of the same board. Warsh.
who earned his bachelor's degree from
the University, will serve until 2018 if
confirmed by the Congress, according
to a White I louse press release.

since government bureaucrats have
an unbounded ability to come up with
bad ideas, and the CEA members
have to spell out to them why their
ideas are not in the president's or
country's interest," he explained.
"This requires CEA members to
quickly grasp the essential economics
involved in these discussions and ex
plain the full economic implications of
alternative policies."
Others said the CEA will face the
challenge of recommending policies
that will keep the economy growing.
"I lis main responsibility will be to
give advice on how to keep the already
long economic expansion in the Unit
ed States going," said John Taylor,
Stanford economics professor and
Hoover senior fellow. "His expertise
in labor economics will be valuable
here, especially to communicate about
the importance of keeping the US.
labor markets flexible."
Kreps said he had no idea what
agenda Lazear will be given by the
White House. Based on the State of
the Union address, he guessed that
Lazear may immediately focus on so
cial security reform and energy policy.

He has a great style that will fit in with
Washington. He is not a stuffy academic.

KENNETH JUDD, Hoover Senior Fellow

"But that's up to his bosses," he
wrote.
Some said they expect that his past
interest in the labor market will have
an influence on his priorities if he is
confirmed.
"He may concentrate more on the
labor market than has been the case in
the past," Arrow said, citing the impact
of productivity gains as an example of
an issue he might examine. "This
would be a good thing."
Oyer speculated that Lazear might
focus on taxes, health care and social
security during his tenure in Washing
ton. He too reiterated that the issues
will ultimately be determined by
Bush's agenda.
CEA's Limited Authority
The CEA, often called the White
House's economics think tank, was
formed in 1946. Much of the council's
work is done behind the scenes, and
the three-member panel typically
gives advice to the president and sen
ior White House officials. Traditional
ly the chairman attends cabinet meet
ings as well.
One observer said that the CEA —
while still very important and highly
competent in the reporting it does — is
less influential than it was in the decades
immediately after its formation.
"The CEA has played a very sec
ondary role in policymaking for many
years," Arrow said.
He attributed some of this decline
in influence to the rogue actions of
CEA Chair Martin Fcldstein during
the first Ronald Reagan administra
tion. Feldstein publicly questioned
some of the White House economic
policy aims such as the large deficit
and consequently may have partially
damaged the prestige of the office.

Arrow said.
"As a result, the Council was kind
of shut out," he said. "It has happened
with every subsequent president. I
think that includes Bill Clinton."
Arrow added that the appreciation
of economics has become more wide
spread and other federal government
departments' economic analysis divi
sions have become more influential,
specifically the National Economic
Council and the Treasury Depart
ment.
"As a result, the CEA is just one
input into the economic process," he
added.
Perhaps symbolically, the CEA,
which used to be located immediately
adjacent to the White House, was
moved several blocks away.
Even though the Council may not
be as influential as it was before.
Arrow still believes it plays an impor
tant role in the formation of national
economic policy, asserting "the Coun
cil still has the economists with the
broadest view."
Arrow added that the CEA has
traditionally brought academics into
the realm of policymaking.
"The tradition of the Council is to
take important economists and infuse
them as policy makers," he said.
Tax Panel
Lazear was appointed to be a
member of the President's panel on
Tax Reform, which released its report
last year. Some speculate that Lazear
may have increased his visibility and
credibility with the administration
during this time.
Colleagues said the tax panel work
demonstrates that he knows how to
work well inside the Beltway.
"His recent service on the Bush

Tax Reform panel has made him an
expert on the tax system and how to
improve it." said Judd. "It is impossi
ble to separate his work from any of
the other members of the Panel.
Overall. 1 thought that the panel did
an excellent job of laying out the is
sues in their report."
Kreps wrote. "Ideologues on both
sides were unhappy, always a sign that
they did a good job," he wrote. "Seri
ously, if you look hard at it. you see a
lot of extremely sensible economics in
the proposals."
Research
As a professor at the Graduate
School of Business, Lazear has done
seminal groundbreaking work in both
theoretical and applied economics. He
is especially respected for his work on
personnel economics, a field that he is
credited for pioneering.
Arrow hailed Lazear's novel work
on micro-incentives for employees to
function well on behalf of firms, in
cluding his research into pay for top
executives.
"1 lis research centers on employee
i ncent i ves, prt >mot ions. compensati on.
and productivity in firms," reports the
GSB Web site. "His current research is
on entrepreneurship, leadership, and
its relation to personnel economics."
Lazear teaches three courses: "In
centives and Productivity," "Research
Methods in Economics" and "Person
nel Economics."
Stanford Kconomics
Lazear. who has been a senior fel
low at the Hoover Institution since
1985 and a professor at GSB since
1992. was appointed to fill the position
vacated by Ben Bernanke, who was
confirmed as chairman of the federal
Reserve's Board of Governors this
week. Bernanke taught economics at
Stanford from 1979 to 14K5.
Last Friday, Bush nominated Stan
ford alumnus Kevin Warsh to serve as
a member of the same board. Warsh.
who earned his bachelor's degree from
the University, will serve until 2018 if
confirmed by the Congress, according
to a White I louse press release.
Both economists and colleagues have said
they widely support the confirmation of
Hoover senior fellow and Graduate School of
Business Prof. Edward Lazear to become
chairman of President W. Bush's Council of
Economic Advisers (CEA). Lazear, nominat-

Ed Monday, is lauded by those who have
worked with him as an energetic, brilliant and
level-headed economist who knows how to
communicate with non-academics. Lazear is
expected to strongly support the Bush eco
nomic agenda after his likely Senate confir
mation.
Economists of all political leanings who
know him said that Lazear is not un ideologue,
but rather a pragmatic economist focused on
data and empirics.
"Eddie is a free-market economist," said
Hoover Senior Fellow Kenneth Judd."He be
lieves that free markets are the best way to or
ganize an economy, and that the role of gov-

eminent is to provide the
foundation for those free
markets."
"I do not detect a sim
ple-minded reflex that the
government is bad," said
Kenneth Arrow, Nobel
laureate. "He sees the
government as important
in some areas and less in
others. He has the view of
limiting government's role.

but he's certainly not an extremist."
"He is not a right-wing ideologue," said
Paul Oyer, associate professor of economics

at the Graduate School of Business (GSB).
"He can really quickly grasp the economics
of a situation."
Lazear's Style
Colleagues said Lazear can relate to non
economists and has the types of skills neces
sary to be successful in the politically-charged
climate of the nations capitol.
"Eddie is a superb economist," said recent
CEA Chair and Harvard Economics Prof.
Greogry Mankiw in an email to The Daily."He
continues the long tradition of the CEA at
tracting top talent from academia into a period
of public service."

David Kreps, a senior associate dean at the
GSB and economics professor, called him
"extremely energetic" and a "great communi
cator."
Lazear "expresses his point of view very
forthrightly, and convinces you that it was (and
is) your point of view," he said.
Others concur that he is not the stereotypi
cal academic stuck in the Ivory Tower.
"He has a great style that will fit in with
Washington, Judd said. "He is quick on his
feet, and will express his ideas in a direct and
clear, hut personable manner. He is not a


LAZEAR
stuffy academic."
Lazear is thought by those who
have worked with him to have a calm
temperament and good composure,
important traits for Washington insid
ers.
White House Agenda
Observers wonder what might be
expected from Lazear if he becomes
chairman. Experts said that his past re
search interests should not necessarily
be a guide for the direction the White
House's economic policy may now
take. Instead, the CEA's research goals
have traditionally followed the political
agenda of the administration in power.
"He will focus on whatever the
president wants the CEA to think
about," Judd said. "The agenda of the
CEA is set by other people in Wash
ington. For example, one of its main,
but little publicized,jobs is to deal with
various government agencies and
their economic proposals.
"This is often like putting out fires

an unbounded ability to come up with
bad ideas, and the CEA members
have to spell out to them why their

economic policy, asserting "the Coun
cil still has the economists with the
broadest view."
Arrow added that the CEA has
traditionally brought academics into
the realm of policymaking.
"The tradition of the Council is to
take important economists and infuse
them as policy makers," he said.
Tax Panel
Lazear was appointed to be a
member of the President's panel on
Tax Reform, which released its report
last year. Some speculate that Lazear
may have increased his visibility and
credibility with the administration
during this time.
Colleagues said the tax panel work
demonstrates that he knows how to
work well inside the Beltway.
"His recent service on the Bush

Tax Reform panel has made him an
expert on the tax system and how to
improve it." said Judd. "It is impossi
ble to separate his work from any of
the other members of the Panel.
Overall. 1 thought that the panel did
an excellent job of laying out the is
sues in their report."
Kreps wrote. "Ideologues on both
sides were unhappy, always a sign that
they did a good job," he wrote. "Seri
ously, if you look hard at it. you see a
lot of extremely sensible economics in
the proposals."
Research
As a professor at the Graduate
School of Business, Lazear has done
seminal groundbreaking work in both
theoretical and applied economics. He
is especially respected for his work on
personnel economics, a field that he is
credited for pioneering.
Arrow hailed Lazear's novel work
on micro-incentives for employees to
function well on behalf of firms, in
cluding his research into pay for top
executives.
"1 lis research centers on employee
i ncent i ves, prt >mot ions. compensati on.
and productivity in firms," reports the
GSB Web site. "His current research is
on entrepreneurship, leadership, and
its relation to personnel economics."
Lazear teaches three courses: "In
centives and Productivity," "Research
Methods in Economics" and "Person
nel Economics."
Stanford Kconomics
Lazear. who has been a senior fel
low at the Hoover Institution since
1985 and a professor at GSB since
1992. was appointed to fill the position
vacated by Ben Bernanke, who was
confirmed as chairman of the federal
Reserve's Board of Governors this
week. Bernanke taught economics at
Stanford from 1979 to 14K5.
Last Friday, Bush nominated Stan
ford alumnus Kevin Warsh to serve as
a member of the same board. Warsh.
who earned his bachelor's degree from
the University, will serve until 2018 if
confirmed by the Congress, according
to a White I louse press release.
