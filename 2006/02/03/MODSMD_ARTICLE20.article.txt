## Major League Impact Without him, we would have no chance of being successful. MARK MARQUESS, head coach 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's John Hester looks every
inch the pro.
At 6-foot-4, Hester has the idealized
build of a Major League player and the
chiseled features of an All-American.
Even crouched behind the plate, the senior
looks massive. His charged bat, strong
throwing arm and solid ability to hold run
ners don't hurt the image either.
Hester is just what Stanford baseball
needs this season. But, for one brief mo
ment, the Cardinal almost lost the natural
leader.
After an impressive junior year, in
which he batted .282 and caught all but one
of Stanford's 59 games, Hester received a
quick phone call from the Boston Red
Sox. He was in his car running errands —
moving out of Mirrelees at the end of
spring quarter — when he was told that he
had been selected in the 34th round of the
2005 MLB First-Year Player Draft.
Hester, a native of Roswell, Georgia,
knew he would get drafted someday. When
he played sports a child, he would pretend
to be none other than himself — in the
major leagues. But when the opportunity
came that afternoon, Hester passed.
"Some guys like to leave early, whether
it's for money or because they're ready to
get out of here, but I wanted to come
back," Hester said. "There's no reason to
cut college short. I knew I'd be in a leader
ship position and it's something 1 wanted
— to lead the team and spend one more
year around Stanford baseball."
And for Stanford baseball, that news
was a godsend.
"Without him we would have no
chance of being successful," coach Mark
Marquess said."Of all the players we could
least afford to lose, it's Hester."
Stanford's success this season truly
does hinge in large part on Hester. The
squad lost five wouid-be-seniors to the
draft in John Mayberry Jr. (first round to
the Texas Rangers), Jed Lowrie, Mark Ro

manczuk, Peter Duda and Jeff Gilmore.
With their departure, this years Cardinal
needs as much experience and confidence
as it can get to get back to the postseason.
Compared to previous years' teams,
last year's squad struggled without a real
senior. Even Hester admits that last year's
34-25 finish could have been better. That's
one other reason he came back.
"I want one more opportunity to get to
Omaha," he said.
This season, the squad has four seniors,
and Marquess already knew in the fall that
he would depend on his catcher to lead the
team. With last year's top two starters gone
and a large freshman class, working with
inexperienced pitchers is Hester's top pri
ority. During batting practice and intra
squad games, he gives them feedback on
what works and what doesn't, work Hester
trust will pay off come game-time.
"Even though we're friends, he still has
no problem getting on me during the
game," senior right hander Matt Manship
said. "If he has to come out and straighten
me up. he has no problem doing that."
Had Hester decided to sign with the
Red Sox last spring, he likely would have
spent his summer in New England, and
with some talent and luck, he could have
been where Mayberry is now — attending
spring training camps and watching the
pros roll in.
He's talked to a couple of his former
teammates, and they tell him how they
enjoy the experience. Hester said it was
obviously honor to be drafted, but, ulti
mately, he did not want to miss his senior
year in college. So the decision was de
layed. Just for a bit.
"He will sign," Marquess said. "He's
going to play professional baseball."
Before the start of last year's Pac-10
season, Hester remarked that in the past, it
was Sam Fuld's team, Jonny Ash's team,
and even Ryan Garko's (a former catcher
now with the Cleveland Indians) team.
This year, the pieces are all set for it to
be John Hester's team. And John Hester
knows it.
