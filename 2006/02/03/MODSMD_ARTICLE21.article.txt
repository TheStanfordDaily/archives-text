## Maples magic: Card top visiting Ducks 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With the way things have gone.
Stanford might want to schedule all
their games against Oregon at
Maples Pavilion. The Cardinal
opened Iliursday's game on a 9-0 run
and never looked hack in a 79-58
rout, pushing their all-time home
record against the Ducks to 18-1.
"I think [the home-court advan
tage] could he something." Oregon
head coach Bev Smith said. "It must
be, because I don't se<. our team as in
tense or together on that court."
Stanford (15-5, 10-2 Pac-10), who
has struggled out of the gate often
this season, opened with stifling de
fense, especially on the interior.
Oregon (13-8, 4-7) responded by
missing their first nine shots from the
field. The Ducks finally made their
first field goal — a three-pointer by
sophomore guard Brandi Davis —
with 11:41 left in the first half.
But by that point the Cardinal had
already built a 10-point lead which
would only expand.
"The five of us starters got togeth
er before the game and said 'Let's

start this off how we'd like,'" junior center Brooke Smith said. "We
played with a lot of energy, especially in the first half."
Davis' outside shooting was the only real bright spot for Oregon.
Her 15 points, on 5-12 three-point shooting, led a team that otherwise
could not get going offensively.
On the offensive end, the Cardinal were aggressive and forced the
Ducks to foul early and often. Sophomore guard Candice Wiggins (15
points, eight rebounds), though only 3-7 from the field, was a perfect 9-
9 from the free-throw line.
"Candice struggled from the perimeter but she got to the free-throw
line," VanDerveer said. "1 actually think she could've gotten to the line
a little more."
Stanford outrebounded Oregon by a margin of 44-19. More impor
tant to the players is that by beating Oregon on the offensive glass 14-
12, they will avoid running suicides in a deal VanDerveer calls "the re
bounding game."
