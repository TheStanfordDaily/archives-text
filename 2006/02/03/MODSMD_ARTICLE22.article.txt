# MEN'S TENNIS
## Battle of the Tennis Titans Card come off Hawaii win, weekend trio combines for 49 titles 
### BEN BACKES 
With its sights set on the NCAA Champi
onships — which will be held on its home courts in
May — men's tennis will host last year's champi
on, No. 4 UCLA, Saturday afternoon. The No. 12
Cardinal will also host No. 18 Southern California
on Friday.
These three schools have historically dominated
the sport, racking up a combined 49 NCAA titles.
Since 1973, there have only been six years in which
one of the three schools did not win the title.
Stanford head coach John Whitlinger knows the
weekend is important.
"If you look at college tennis, it's just an awe
some rivalry — both of them," he said.
While USC and UCLA have traditionally visited
Stanford in April, this year's matches present an
early-season challenge for the Cardinal.
Senior captain KC Corkery likes the opportuni
ty to begin the year in front of the home fans — and
against the Bruins and Trojans.
"I love being able to start the season off at
home," he said. "I feel like we have a great atmos
phere and there's so much tradition on those
courts."
While Whitlinger welcomes the chance to open
the season at home, he is cautious about placing too
much importance on the venue.
"All of February we're at home and we want to
take advantage of that," he said. "It's nice to start
out here, [but] when we're playing USC and UCLA
we could play them [anywhere] and it wouldn't mat
ter. It's such great competition."
Last year, Stanford dropped both its matches to
UCLA, 4-3. Although the scores were close, the
Cardinal struggled at the lower singles positions,
winning only one of six times at the No. 4-6 singles
spots. Other than Sam Warburg, who graduated last
year, only Corkery and junior James Wan won a sin
gles match against UCLA.
Corkery thinks that Stanford has a shot at de
feating the defending national champions this
weekend.
"We have a team that can compete with anyone
in the country, so we always feel like going into any
match we have a chance to win," he said. "This
weekend is no different."
Friday's opponent, USC, should not be taken
lightly either. Last year, Stanford played well
against USC, sweeping the Trojans — 5-2 in Los
Angeles and 5-1 on the Farm. The Trojans, who most
recently won the NCAA Championship in 2002, are
led by Jamil Al-Agba, who was ranked seventh in
the ITA fall rankings.
Whitlinger realizes that, regardless of the result,
the season is just getting underway.
"Win or lose, there's still a lot of tennis to be
played," he said. "If we win, let's not get too excit
ed."
One question mark for Stanford this season has
been the team's health. Freshman Matt Bruch —
the fourth-ranked singles player in the country —
and Wan both missed singles play against Hawaii
last week. Wan is the only returning player to win
both singles matches against UCLA last year.
Even with his lineup in question, Whitlinger re
mains optimistic.
"We'll just see who we have," he said."lf we have

a full lineup,great. If not.it gives guys an opportuni
ty to play. Everybody knows that and will be ready
for the matches, called upon or not. I have confi
dence in the guys.l'll put out there."
One area that hurt Stanford last year was its dou
bles play. The Cardinal coaching staff has been tin
kering with the team's doubles lineup, trying to find
the best combinations.
"It's still a work in progress," Whitlinger said.
"We've got to get some guys healthy. We have a
ways to go in doubles yet, in figuring out who's right
for one another. We'll look at it in practice and
matches and see."
The coaches and players are ready for their first
matches against ranked opponents.
"Guys are ready to go and excited about this sea
son and this weekend should be a good way to show
our enthusiasm." Corkery said.
