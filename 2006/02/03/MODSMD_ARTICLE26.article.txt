## Bookstore answers critics of high prices 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STMT WRITER 
As winter quarter reaches its
midpoint, the mad scramble and
the long lines at the Stanford
Bookstore to buy textbooks have
died down. The high price of text
books and course readers, howev
er, still lingers in students' minds.
Many said they buy their books
from a variety of venues, especially
online or at the Bookstore.
"I usually buy my books at the
Bookstore and keep track of how
much they cost so 1 can sell them
back to my friends later on," said
freshman John Sillcox.
Freshman Alison Teo, however,
said she prefers online sources be
cause she can find them virtually
new but for prices that may be bet
ter than the Bookstore's used
book prices.
Most agree that prices of books
seem, in general, too high. Director
of Stores Ken Bowers, who recent
ly joined the Bookstore after
working at UC-Santa Barbara and
UC-San Diego, explained that the
system for pricing textbooks is
largely formula-driven.
"The bookstore industry hasn't
changed its basic formulas in
decades," Bowers said. "I've been
in this business since 1978 and
we're using the same formulas
today as we did then."
Bowers explained that there
are different methods of pricing
books, depending on how they arc
sold by the publisher. There are
two types of new books that the
bookstore buys in: net price books,
sold by the publisher at a set rate,
and list price books, where sold by
publishers for slightly less than
their appraised value. Used books
are sold at 25 percent off of the re
tail price.
The Bookstore sells net price
books for a slightly higher price

than what they were bought for,
while it follows the publisher's as
sessment price for list-price books.
"Our policy is that when there's
a publisher-recommended price
for a book, that's what we sell it
for," Bowers said. "We don't mark
those up. We think that's a cleaner,
more straightforward policy."
Course readers, on the other
hand.follow a more vague pricing
system than textbooks. Fred
TUrner, an assistant professor in
communication, commented on
the rocketing prices for course
readers.
"The course reader situation is
pretty extreme; fees for readers
are awfully high," he said."l'm not
saying profit shouldn't be earned.
It's a very valuable service but
[course readers) are getting very
expensive, far more expensive
than the collection of articles
would be if it had been produced
as a book."
Ihe course readers sold by the
Bookstore are produced by Uni
versity Custom Publishing (UCP).
UCP occupies space in the down
stairs of the Bookstore and also
has an office in Mountain View.
Most of the course readers are pro
duced at one of those two sites.
UCP has produced course read
ers for Stanford since the fall of
2(K)5 under a subcontract. UCP
produces the readers at the re
quest of the faculty, compiling the
materials and obtaining the per
mission to publish. According to
Bowers, UCP then sells the
course readers back to the book
store, where final pricing follows
the aforementioned formula for
textbooks.
"There's a lot of workload (that
goes into the production of course
readers) that isn't apparent on the
front-end," said Bowers. "Some
times permission is a lot more ex
pensive than actually printing the

pages. I always thought it might be
an intriguing idea to print the cost
of permission on the cover," he
said.
Local copy companies in Palo
Alto also produce readers, but
much less frequently. Kim Bower
from Jungle f)igital Imaging said
that they usually produce one
reader a year but that this year
they have made five. Bower didn't
know who pays the fees for the
permission to publish.
Asked about the most frustrating
challenge in book pricing. Bowers
pointed to high charges.
"The number one challenge is
students think prices are too high
and I sometimes think they're
pretty high myself," Bowers said. "I
remember being a student a long
time ago and thinking, my gosh,
textbooks are such a huge part of
my cost of attending school. So it's
been an ongoing issue."
However, he also noted that
since students at most high schools
didn't have to buy textbooks,
prices may feel higher than they
actually are.
"Most students arrive at a col
lege or university never having had
bought a textbook in their lives,"
said Bowers. "So we're sort of
trained to view a book as essential

ly free, on loan. Then you arrive at
a major university and you've got a
$400 textbook bill and you say this
is not what I've expected."
Students appreciated that the
Bookstore does not have complete
control over its prices.
"Course readers are just way
too expensive but I don't think
that's the bookstore's fault," Teo
said. "It is expensive to get the
copyrights and pay for the repro
ductions of portions of books. The
bookstore has to make money too
and textbooks in general are ex
pensive."
Bowers said he plans to make a
real attempt to reach out and make
the bookstore more relevant to the
student community.
"The textbook business, when
you really get into it, is a fascinat
ing area, and it's so poorly under
stood by the core customer [stu
dents]," Bowers said. "We've never
done a very good job of educating
students about textbook pricing."
Despite the fact that most stu
dents have misconceptions about
the Bookstore. Bowers said they
are still its first priority.
"We think our core mission here
is to make sure the books students
need to get through school are al
ways here," he said.
