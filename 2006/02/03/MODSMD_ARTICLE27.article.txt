# GRADUATE ADMISSIONS
## New GRE set for October Students divided over planned changes in format 
### ANDREA FULLER STAFF WRITER 
The new Graduate Record Exami
nation (GRE), the standardized gate
keeper for most students applying to
graduate school, will debut in October.
The revisions represent the greatest
change in the test s 55-year history.
The revised test strives to provide
greater validity and information about
students' performance, as well as better
security, worldwide access and techno
logical advancements, proponents
have said.
The new verbal section will focus on
higher cognitive skills — rather than
vocabulary — and will emphasize
more complex reading. It will also in
clude two 40-minute sections rather
than one 30-minute section. The entire
test will increase in length from two
and-a-half to a little over four hours
and will include one either 30- or 40-
minute section that will not count to
ward the final score.
Students expressed concern over
the proposed changes.
"I heard there are no more analo
gies, and they changed it to twice as
long," said junior Patrick Callier. "I
think longer is probably not better but
analogies need to go. I think I might try
to take it before the change happens. I
think it will be harder. The whole idea
of the test seems like an endurance
trial."
Senior Chin-Yin Tseng, who already
took the test, agreed that the change in
length is excessive.
"I'm fine with the things tested, but
twice as long is just horrid," she said.
"My eyes went blurry after 1 took the
GRE. I don't think I could handle more
reading passages."
Quantitative reasoning questions
will also include more real-life scenar
ios with fewer geometry questions. An
on-screen calculator will be provided
as well. It will include two 40-minute
sections rather than one 45-minute
section.
The third section of the test — ana
lytical writing— will present more fo
cused prompts that reduce the possibil
ity of using memorized materials. The
writing sections will include 30-minute
argument and issue tasks.
ITie new writing section will be 15
minutes shorter than its old version.
However, senior Jesse Young, who
took the current version, said he
wished it had provided more time for
writing.
"It would be nice if the GRE al
lowed more time for the essay sec
tions," he said. "Eorty-five minutes
was barely enough for me to decide

on an outline."
The new GRE format will also scale
verbal and quantitative scores from
110 to 150, in one-point increments, in
stead of 200 to 800. A conversion table
will be made available in January of
2007 to compare old and new scores.
Bert Lain, a lecturer in the Classics De
partment, said the new scoring system
will pose a challenge for departments
evaluating potential graduate students
during the first year of the new test.
"'Hie first year it's used, depart
ments will have to figure out how to in
terpret the GRE," he said."The current
grad students took a different test and
it will be difficult to see if they're get
ting the same kind of person, even with
a conversion scale."
I"he test is currently presented in a
computer-adaptive format, meaning
that the difficulty of each question is
determined by the number of previous
right or wrong answers. The new test
will present the same questions to all
students, and there will be little or no
repeat of the same questions on differ
ent test dates.
Tseng approved of this move to
standardized questions.
"I think I'd like the fact that every
one has the same questions, like the
SATs," she said. "I like it if there's just
this one set of questions, and you get
the same number of points for each
question that you missed."
Callier said he plans to study for the
new test in much the same way he
would have prepared for the old one.
"I don't think I would necessarily
study that differently," he said. "In
terms of preparation it will be pretty
much the same except skipping analo
gies — which anyone would be happy
to do. I think I'll have enough trouble
reviewing high school math to begin
with. In high school I was more ready to
do the whole standardized test thing."
When asked about their opinions of
the changes overall, students were gen
erally pessimistic. Senior Leigh Barn
well. who also took the current test, did
not feel that changes would truly im
prove the effectiveness of the exam.
"I am not sure if I would want to
change anything about the test," she
said. "I think most standardized tests
are unfair in one way or another, and I
am not sure that this one was any more
or less unfair than other standardized
tests."
Senior Nick Manov agreed that no
matter what changes are made, other
factors better reflect a student's readi
ness for graduate school.
"The test is really a fornialityjike the
SAT for college." he said. "It is perhaps
a convenience to colleges that people
can be separated by test scores, but
these mostly reflect general knowledge
and test-taking skills. Your application
stands out because of experience and
grades."

test will increase in length from two
and-a-half to a little over four hours
and will include one either 30- or 40-
minute section that will not count to
ward the final score.
Students expressed concern over
the proposed changes.
"I heard there are no more analo
gies, and they changed it to twice as
long," said junior Patrick Callier. "I
think longer is probably not better but
analogies need to go. I think I might try
to take it before the change happens. I
think it will be harder. The whole idea
of the test seems like an endurance
trial."
Senior Chin-Yin Tseng, who already
took the test, agreed that the change in
length is excessive.
"I'm fine with the things tested, but
twice as long is just horrid," she said.
"My eyes went blurry after 1 took the
GRE. I don't think I could handle more
reading passages."
Quantitative reasoning questions
will also include more real-life scenar
ios with fewer geometry questions. An
on-screen calculator will be provided
as well. It will include two 40-minute
sections rather than one 45-minute
section.
The third section of the test — ana
lytical writing— will present more fo
cused prompts that reduce the possibil
ity of using memorized materials. The
writing sections will include 30-minute
argument and issue tasks.
ITie new writing section will be 15
minutes shorter than its old version.
However, senior Jesse Young, who
took the current version, said he
wished it had provided more time for
writing.
"It would be nice if the GRE al
lowed more time for the essay sec
tions," he said. "Eorty-five minutes
was barely enough for me to decide

on an outline."
The new GRE format will also scale
verbal and quantitative scores from
110 to 150, in one-point increments, in
stead of 200 to 800. A conversion table
will be made available in January of
2007 to compare old and new scores.
Bert Lain, a lecturer in the Classics De
partment, said the new scoring system
will pose a challenge for departments
evaluating potential graduate students
during the first year of the new test.
"'Hie first year it's used, depart
ments will have to figure out how to in
terpret the GRE," he said."The current
grad students took a different test and
it will be difficult to see if they're get
ting the same kind of person, even with
a conversion scale."
I"he test is currently presented in a
computer-adaptive format, meaning
that the difficulty of each question is
determined by the number of previous
right or wrong answers. The new test
will present the same questions to all
students, and there will be little or no
repeat of the same questions on differ
ent test dates.
Tseng approved of this move to
standardized questions.
"I think I'd like the fact that every
one has the same questions, like the
SATs," she said. "I like it if there's just
this one set of questions, and you get
the same number of points for each
question that you missed."
Callier said he plans to study for the
new test in much the same way he
would have prepared for the old one.
"I don't think I would necessarily
study that differently," he said. "In
terms of preparation it will be pretty
much the same except skipping analo
gies — which anyone would be happy
to do. I think I'll have enough trouble
reviewing high school math to begin
with. In high school I was more ready to
do the whole standardized test thing."
When asked about their opinions of
the changes overall, students were gen
erally pessimistic. Senior Leigh Barn
well. who also took the current test, did
not feel that changes would truly im
prove the effectiveness of the exam.
"I am not sure if I would want to
change anything about the test," she
said. "I think most standardized tests
are unfair in one way or another, and I
am not sure that this one was any more
or less unfair than other standardized
tests."
Senior Nick Manov agreed that no
matter what changes are made, other
factors better reflect a student's readi
ness for graduate school.
"The test is really a fornialityjike the
SAT for college." he said. "It is perhaps
a convenience to colleges that people
can be separated by test scores, but
these mostly reflect general knowledge
and test-taking skills. Your application
stands out because of experience and
grades."
