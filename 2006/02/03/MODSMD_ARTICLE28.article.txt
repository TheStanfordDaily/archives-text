Injuries strike football's Trent Edwards, Evan Moore
After introducing 18 incoming recruits on Wednesday, football
head coach Walt Harris gave Stanford fans some less welcome
news.
Because of a lingering right shoulder injury, quarterback
Trent Edwards, a fifth-year senior next season, may not be on the

field when spring practice
kicks off on April 7, accord
ing to a San Francisco
Chronicle report.
Edwards injured his
throwing arm in Stanford's
final game of 2005, a 38-31

loss to Notre Dame on Nov. 26.The shoulder had been healing, but
Edwards recently experienced "a relapse," Harris said.
Two MRIs this week showed bursitis, an inflammation which
creates painful friction in the joint. Harris was guardedly opti
mistic that no surgery would be necessary.
"I'm not looking at surgery and he's not looking at surgery, but
we're not really sure yet," he said. "We are hoping it is what the
doctors have diagnosed and we can treat it."
Edwards may be joined on the sidelines at spring practice by
junior wide receiver Evan Moore, who missed the entire season
after dislocating his hip against Navy in September. He has re
cently been experiencing back pain which has hampered his reha
bilitation of the hip.
"It's not in the hip area," Harris said."But it's slowed him down
a little."
Women's tennis looking strong early
in Wisconsin tournament
On a day that saw several top programs falter, top-ranked
Stanford women's tennis swept over-matched No. 12 Kentucky to
open the U.S. Tennis Association/Intercollegiate Tennis Associa
tion National Women's Team Indoor Championship in Wisconsin
Thursday.
Stanford rolled to a 7-0 victory while the next five seeded
teams all bowed out in the first round. No. 1 singles player Amber
Liu and the top doubles team of senior Alice Barnes and junior
Anne Yelsey led the Cardinal juggernaut, though the entire roster
contributed. None of the matches went to a third set and only one
featured a tiebreaker.
With the win. Stanford advances to the quarterfinals of the
tournament and will face No. 10 North Carolina Friday afternoon.
The Cardinal have claimed the title in Wisconsii, for the last two
years and have not lost in their last 59 matches.
Three Cardinal garner pre-season softhall honors
With a week to go until the start of the season. Stanford soft
ball players are already garnering national attention. Three Car
dinal players were named to the Amateur Softball Association
watchlist for Player of the Year honors Thursday. Seniors Lauren
Lappin and Catalina Morris and junior Jackie Rinehart will all
battle for the title.
The list, featuring 50 players from 28 schools, will be cut to 25
in April. Ten finalists will be named in May with the winner
crowned at the Women's World Series in June.
Shortstop and catcher Lappin, 2005 Pac-10 Defensive Player
of the Year, was named to the 25-person short list as a junior and
as a sophomore.
Rinehart. an outfielder who led the team in hits as a freshman
in 2004, joined Lappin on last year's preseason list.
This is the first time centerfielder Morris, Stanford's career
record holder in triples, has been selected.
No. 7/9 Stanford will kick off the 2006 season Feb. 10 in
Phoenix, Ariz.
