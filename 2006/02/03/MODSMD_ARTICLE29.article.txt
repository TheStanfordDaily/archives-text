# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Two Tiger tangos test team Stanford tries to rebound from two narrow losses to Pacific last season 
### JOE KAY 
Still searching for the missing
piece of the puzzle, the men's vol
leyball team is hoping for a reassur
ing win tonight, at Pacific in Stock
ton. Calif.
The Tigers (2-7, 1-5 MPSF) and
Stanford are the only D-I men's vol
leyball teams located in Northern
California. UOP. thus far. has fared
no better than the Cardinal (2-8, 1-
5). The Tigers' only win in MPSF
play came at the expense of UC-San
Diego, a D-I I squad.
The Cardinal have already met
UOP twice this season — once in
October in the Husky Dino Cup in
Calgary, Canada, and again in the
Elephant Bar Invitational last
month at UC-Santa Barbara. The
Cardinal lost both times, but the
matches were close, as Stanford lost
in five and four games, respectively.
"It's a team we're pretty familiar
with; we've seen them a lot," junior
opposite Ben Reddy said. "It's a
team we can definitely beat. We just
need to play solid volleyball like
we're capable of doing, [although]
we haven't put it together for a
whole match this season."
Reddy is far and away the team
leader in kills with 152 on the season
on 338 attempts. The next highest
player in the kill column is senior mid
dle blocker Chris Ahlfeldt, with 77.
Reddy has emerged as Stan
ford's clutch player, but he can't al
ways rescue the Cardinal.
The team has worked to address
the lack of depth.

"We've improved our blocking
over the past week." assistant coach
Al Roderigues said.
The goal is for the Cardinal to
soft-block many of their opponent's
hits, slowing down the ball and mak
ing it easier to pass. This allows the
middle blocker to get involved in
the play and can open up the entire
court.
Pacific doesn't have as clear of a
leader as Stanford and many other
teams do. Junior outside hitter An
dreas Baboulidis leads the team in
kills. He has amassed 131, averaging
3.97 per game.
Sophomore outside hitter Pekka
Seppanen is the team leader in digs,
with 6«S on the season and an aver
age of 2.06 per game. He is also
proving that he can play the entire
rotation, gathering S9 kills at a rate
of 2.70 per game.
Pacific's setter, junior Mitch
liazelett, has 370 assists and is dish
ing out 12.76 sets per game.
Stanford plays UOP twice in a
row this week, once tonight at 7 p.m.
and again on Wednesday at 7 p.m. in
Burnham Pavilion. Next weekend.

the Cardinal will play two matches
in a tournament in Springfield.
Mass., against Springfield College
and Penn State.
Although the Nittany Lions
have been the East Coast's most
dominant team over the years, Stan
ford believes they have a good
chance to take both of these match
es. A four-game win streak would be
huge for the Cardinal, who have yet
to win two in a row this season.
But, the Cardinal stress they can
not afford to look too far ahead. For
right now, the focus is on the Tigers.
"[UOP] is definitely a team that
does a lot of predictable things,"
Reddy said. "They know us very
well and we know them very well.
[The winner is] going to be whoever
comes out and plays better."
