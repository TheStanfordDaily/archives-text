# STANFORD 57, OREGON 56
## DEJA TRUE: Hernandez Again Heroic Following UW magic, he swishes NBAlength three with defender in his face 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
Trailing 63-60 with 0.2 seconds re
maining against No. 15 Washington (16-
4,5-4 Pac-10) on Sunday, senior guard
Chris Hernandez hit three straight free
throws to send the contest to overtime.
The 76-67 final capped the Card's most
dramatic victory yet under second-year
head coach Trent Johnson.
Last night at Oregon though, Her
nandez might just have outdone him
self. Down 56-54 with 11.3 seconds re
maining, the preseason All-American
candidate swished an NBA-length
three-pointer over the outstretched
arms of Oregon guard Brandon Lin
coln, and Stanford survived a wild fin
ish to eke out the 57-56 victory.
'it looked good and straight when I
let it go. so it was just a matter of
whether it was long or short," Hernan
dez said "Time was running out and it
was a pretty good look. I just had to let
it go."
Oregon (10-12, 4-6) looked in con
trol late. In front of a raucous home
crowd at the McKale Center, the Ducks
led the entire second half, and built a
54-49 advantage with 2:04 to play.
Then, Hernandez caught fire.

First, the Fresno, Calif, native
drained a three to pull Stanford (11-7,7-3) to within two.
But Oregon sophomore guard Malik Hairston (23 points
on 9-of-14 shooting) immediately countered with a layup,
leaving Stanford down 56-52 with under a minute to play.
Hairston was most, frequently shadowed by Stanford's Dan
Grunfeld, and the senior guard often appeared a step or two
too slow for the speedster out of Detroit.
