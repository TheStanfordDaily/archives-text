# STANFORD 57, OREGON 56
## DEJA TRUE: Hernandez Again Heroic Following UW magic, he swishes NBAlength three with defender in his face 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
Trailing 63-60 with 0.2 seconds re
maining against No. 15 Washington (16-
4,5-4 Pac-10) on Sunday, senior guard
Chris Hernandez hit three straight free
throws to send the contest to overtime.
The 76-67 final capped the Card's most
dramatic victory yet under second-year
head coach Trent Johnson.
Last night at Oregon though, Her
nandez might just have outdone him
self. Down 56-54 with 11.3 seconds re
maining, the preseason All-American
candidate swished an NBA-length
three-pointer over the outstretched
arms of Oregon guard Brandon Lin
coln, and Stanford survived a wild fin
ish to eke out the 57-56 victory.
'it looked good and straight when I
let it go. so it was just a matter of
whether it was long or short," Hernan
dez said "Time was running out and it
was a pretty good look. I just had to let
it go."
Oregon (10-12, 4-6) looked in con
trol late. In front of a raucous home
crowd at the McKale Center, the Ducks
led the entire second half, and built a
54-49 advantage with 2:04 to play.
Then, Hernandez caught fire.

First, the Fresno, Calif, native
drained a three to pull Stanford (11-7,7-3) to within two.
But Oregon sophomore guard Malik Hairston (23 points
on 9-of-14 shooting) immediately countered with a layup,
leaving Stanford down 56-52 with under a minute to play.
Hairston was most, frequently shadowed by Stanford's Dan
Grunfeld, and the senior guard often appeared a step or two
too slow for the speedster out of Detroit.

Senior guard Chris Hernandez shoots in a 76-67 overtime win over No. 15 Wash
ington on Sunday. At Oregon, he notched 20 points and an equally dramatic clutch shot.
"Malik Hairston is as good of a
player as there is in this league," John
son said.
However — and just like against
Washington four days earlier — Her
nandez bailed out his teammates. His
two free throws with 36 seconds left
cut Stanford's deficit to 56-54, setting
up his final dagger just 24 seconds
later.
"A game like this can rip your heart
out somewhat, but you take the loss,
get it behind you and move on," Ore
gon coach Ernie Kent said.
All told, Hernandez scored Stan
ford's final eight points. On the game,
he finished with 20 points on 6-of-ll
overall shooting, including 4-of-6 be
yond the arc.
"Chris was clutch last week and he
was clutch this week," senior forward
Matt Haryasz said. "He stepped up
and made big plays."
Haryasz, meanwhile, led all players
with 24 points and 14 rebounds — his
sixth straight contest with at least 20
points and seven boards. But, despite
an impressive stat line, Haryasz looked
to be the game's goat as the final sec
onds ticked away.
Trailing 56-52 with 1:14 to go,
I laryasz could only look on in disbelief
as an easy entry pass from Hernandez
bounced off both his hands before
rolling straight to Oregon forward
Ivan Johnson.
Later, Oregon guard Aaron
Brooks turned it over immediately
following Hernandez's final three.
Brooks fouled Haryasz with 2.4 sec
onds to go, but Haryasz missed the
front end of a one-and-one to give the
Ducks new life.
Off an Oregon timeout, Brooks
received an in-bound near half
court with two seconds remaining.
Brooks again committed the
turnover — this time dribbling the
ball off his leg and out-of-bounds —
and Stanford survived its craziest
final seconds since just four days
earlier.
"We've had a couple of wild games
and it's great to be on this end of
them," Grunfeld said.
Despite the late-game bedlam,
the Card's season actually seems to
be stabilizing. After a rollercoaster 4-
6 start, Stanford has won four in a
row and seven of their last eight. At
least for now, dreams of a conference

title and an NCAA Tournament
berth can resume.
"We're fighting to stay in this
thing," Haryasz said. "We're in a race
and now we're one game out of [first
place in the Pac-10]."
Oregon went into the locker room
with a narrow 30-29 halftime edge. De
spite the close margin, however, the
first half was a seesaw affair.
Oregon's streak came first, as the
Ducks jumped to a quick 9-0 lead that
they stretched into a 22-10 advantage
seven minutes into the game. Hairston
contributed 12 of the Ducks' points
during the spurt.
But Stanford responded. A Haryasz
lay-in started an 18-2 run that put the
Card ahead 28-24 with 4:17 remaining
in the period. Six straight Hernandez
points in a span of just 35 seconds

sparked the rally.
Despite the final outcome, inconsis
tency continued to plague Stanford
away from Maples, where the Card im
prove to just 2-6 this season.
From the field, Stanford finished
just 38% (21-of-55). Haryasz, Hernan
dez and sophomore forward Taj Finger
were a combined 49% (19-of-39),
while the rest of the team shot just
13% (2-of-16).
The picture wasn't any prettier
from the free throw line, where Stan
ford finished just 58% (11-of-19). Big
men Haryasz and Finger fared a com
bined 2-of-9.
Stanford now has a day to prepare
for Saturday's 5 p.m. visit to Oregon
State (10-11, 3-7). Last night, the
Beavers lost easily to visiting Cal, 69-
52.
