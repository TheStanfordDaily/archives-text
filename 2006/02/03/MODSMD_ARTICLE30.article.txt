# Runners face elite at Husker Invite
## 
### ISRAEL ROJAS 
With momentum building from last weekend's
record-breaking meet, Stanford heads to Nebraska
hoping to pick up where it left off. The Bob Devaney
Sports Center Indoor Track will be the site of the 31st
annual Frank Sevigne Husker Invitational. Several
of the nation's top athletes will square off in a week-

end full of competi
tion.
The field of ath
letes combines to
hold 43 NCAA quali
fying marks, 23 of
them ranking among
the nation's top 10.
Among the teams
competing this week
end are UTEP, Kansas
and Kansas State,
whose men's teams
rank in the top 25. Host
Nebraska's men's and
women's teams both
rank in the top 10.

Although the Stanford men have so far failed to
break into the list of top-25 track programs in the nation
— the women are ranked third — senior Solomon
Welch is confident that the team is among the best.
"We're definitely a top-10 team," Welch said. "We
have the talent to make noise at NCAAs."
As one of the leaders on the team, Welch wants to
ensure that Stanford's newcomers both appreciate
level of athleticism at the meet, but also relax.
"It's important to show we're taking care of busi
ness, but also to have fun," Welch said.
Focuses differ between non-scored invitationals
and team competitions. In a team competition, the
emphasis remains on scoring points for the team. In
an invitational meanwhile, athletes want to position
themselves in the faster heats and in the better track
lanes, hoping the speedy competition will propel
them to better times.
One of the most intriguing events this weekend is
the women's 60-meter dash. Stanford brings two of
the nation's top runners in the event: junior Janice
Davis and sophomore Chauntae Bayne. Davis is
ranked eighth nationally, and Bayne 12th. The pair
will be running against the nation's 14th-ranked run
ner. Priscilla Lopes of Nebraska.
Given the high level of competition, Stanford ath
letes have a chance to catapult themselves onto the
NCAA provisional marks list. For those Stanford
athletes who have already hit the provisional mark,
the NCAA automatic qualifying mark still looms, for
hitting a provisional mark does not guarantee a spot
at the indoor championships.
One of Welch's goals this weekend is to use his
record-breaking performance last weekend as a step
ping stone toward that automatic qualification.
Welch's provisional mark in the triple jump ranks
eighth in the nation, unlikely to be displaced by oth
ers, but that is still no guarantee.
Welch appreciates Stanford track's rich tradition.
A Bay Area native, he recalls going to track meets at
Berkeley and walking away impressed by Stanford's
enthusiasm and determination.
"The captains cheered, the teams were loud and
they performed well," Welch said."They were having
fun with it."
One defining characteristic of a leader is the abil
ity to deliver, and if last weekend's performance was
any indicator. Welch is poised to lead Stanford back
to prominence.
"I think we're ready," he said.
