# MEN'S SWIMMING
## USC, Bakersfield beckon 
### KATHERINE BELL 
The No. 3 men's swimming and
diving team may have fallen a spot in
the polls, but when the Cardinal race
No. 9 Southern California in Los An
geles on Saturday, they will be work
ing toward nothing less than their
first NCAA Championship in six
years.
The weekend looks to have its
share of down-to-the-wire races that
will help prepare the men for their
final dual meet — archrival No. 2
California in two weeks.
Coming off an encouraging win
over No. 5 Arizona, the undefeated
Cardinal say they will be confident
when racing USC stars Larsen
Jensen and Ous Mellouli, the
NCAA defending champions in
the 1,650-yard freestyle and the
400 individual medley, respectively.
According to junior Chuy Phillips,
the meet offers many incentives for
the men to record some fast times
that will be noticed around the
country.
"This weekend we'll be building

off our wins against the Arizonas,"
Phillips said. "Those meets were re
ally important for us to practice rac
ing, but now we need to focus on rac
ing as well as putting some good
times up on the board. USC has a few
good individuals to push us, but we'll
also be competing amongst our
selves for spots on the travel team for
Pac-lOs and scoring spots for the Cal
meet."
While Phillips has high hopes to
defeat Jensen — a 2004 Olympic sil
ver medalist who has just returned
from an injury — in the mile, his
classmate Andy Grant will look to
hold off Mellouli in the 500 free.
Mellouli has posted the nation's
fastest time in that event this year,
while Grant's best time places him
third.
The Card appear positioned to
fare well in the sprint freestyles, led
by juniors Ben Wildman-Tobriner
and Kyle Ransom, the backstroke,
with junior Hongzhe Sun. and the
IM. with seniors Tobias Oriwol and
Mark Stephens. In addition, the team
expects good things from the talent-

Ed duo of freshman Paul Kornfeld
and Chris Ash to perform well in the
breaststrokes, as well as freshman
phenom Dwight Dumais in diving.
To practice racing when tired —
an essential aspect of championship
meets — the squad will race against
CSU-Bakersfield on Friday before
facing the Trojans on Saturday.
"The meet against Cal State Bak
ersfield is a chance to tune up for
USC and race some of our off
events," Phillips said. "Being able to
come back and swim strong the sec
ond day is really important since
Pac-lOs and NCAAs are multi-day
events."
Stephens, a team captain, predicts
the back-to-back meets will be vital
to helping the men gear up for the
upcoming championship season.
"Training has been hard, but
we're starting to focus more on rac
ing and holding our technique when
we're tired." Stephens said."Beyond
just having fun and growing as a
team, we hope to use the weekend to
focus on our turns,our technique and
winning the close races."
