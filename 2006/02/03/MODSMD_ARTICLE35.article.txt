Hello.
Welcome Volume 229 of The Daily.
We actually have no idea what volume of
Intermission this is, but we are going to as
sume that it is Volume 230. In any case,
hold on to your butts, because it's going to
be wild ride.
In the first whirlwind week of this shiny
new volume, someone has stolen our

phone — we'd like it back —
and we have discovered that
Camilie s fridge makes
slushies. If this is any indica-.
tion, we'll probably cure cancer
by June.
The newest addition to the
Intermission editorial staff is
Victor. Underfed and under
paid — no Costco run, my ass!
— the powers that be have fi
nally decided to let their prodi
gal son take the step up from
layout. We're not saying that it
was a wise choice, but like we
always said in elementary
school, "No backsies!
Betsy's still holding down
the fort, keeping the preco
ciously bright-eyed and bushy-

tailed Victor from getting ahead of him
self. In his defense, the Indian burns and
purple nurples were a bit excessive.
So, in the aftermath of the Daily Ban
quet and the revolting clean-up that en
sued, we have taken the reigns of the roar
ing beast that is Intermission. We will
tame it and do our best to do justice to past
volumes. All 229 of them.
With this attitude in mind, we make it
our personal manifesto to keep the jour
nalistic integrity and the pure family ori
ented nature of Intermission intact. There

will be no more swearing, referencing to
lewd acts of perversion, and no more
Roxy Sass. Consider her dead. Forget she
ever lived. Also, all of our articles will be
kept under the strictest regulation to en
sure veracity of fact and relevance to the
moral fabric of our school.
We'd also like to take this opportunity
to remind all of you that we are full of shit.
If you actually believed any of the previ
ous paragraph, please read the container
in which Intermission comes in (i.e. The
Daily). They actually believe in all that
crap.

So now that you have a
general idea of our journalis
tic stance that will be promot
ed over the course of the vol
ume, we'd like to get serious a
moment and thank all those
editors of Intermissions past.
If it wasn't for folks like Bren
dan Marten, Tom Haneda,
Sam Tanzer, Betsy Congdon
(wait, why are you thanking
yourself?), Caley Anderson
and —most importantly of
all —Tam Vo, Intermission
would not have the same level
of awesomeness.
So welcome to the fu
ture. The Future-mission.


Our signing bonus. Brendan, we'll be expecting this sometime in the
near future. Make sure it comes before the middle of the volume.
