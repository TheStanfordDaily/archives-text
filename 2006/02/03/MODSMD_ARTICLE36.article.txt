### CALEY ANDERSON INTERMISSION FUTURF. -OLOGIST 
In 1976 it was Devo and Heart.
1986 brought us Sade and the Beast
ie Boys and 1996 saw the emergence
of the Fugees. That eclectic list illus
trates the difficulty of pinpointing
the artists that will explode onto the
music scene in the future, but 2006
looks promising.
To jumpstart your 2006 musical
collection. Intermission predicts the
artists whose names may seem for
eign today, but will be übiquitous by
this time next year.
Steel Train
Hailed by critics as the next Cros
by, Still, Nash and Young. Steel
Train fuse folk, rock, funk and coun
try into a refreshing conglomeration
of styles without going over the top.
As intense as CSNY were about their

protest songs. Steel Train is as laid
back about their harmonies. You are
more likely to see the five band mem
bers hot boxing than marching, so
while the comparison to CSNY is un
derstandable, it sounds like Steel
Train is having more fun.
Originally from the New
York/New Jersey area, Steel Train's
influences reflect their extensive
West Coast travels. Their new CD
"Twilight Tales From the Prairies of
the Sun" would be the perfect
soundtrack for a road trip to Santa
Cruz.
The group members are notorious
for playing anywhere at anytime, and
their devotion to the music will keep
jam-bands around for a long time to
come. ■ : J

Imogen Heap
Best known in the United States as
half of Frou Frou, whose song "Let
Go" was popularized in the movie
"Garden State," Imogen Heap began
her career as a solo artist in England.
Her current release, "Speak for Your
self," proves that Heap can thrive on
her own.
«Sfy" is an inventive mix of elec
tronica, pop and earnest singer-song
writer lyrics (I'm using the electronica
adjective as a compliment here). It's a
triumph of technology and vision that
prevent the synthesizers from turning
the record into something that belongs
at a rave.
Saying her music is pop is mislead
ing. because there is little on "SFY"
that is light and fluffy. Heap knows
how to layer intensity into her vocals,
and the musical "arrangements are
complex. 4*

Out of all the artists on the list.
Heap is most likely to be everywhere
tomorrow. Her songs have been fea
tured on "The 0.C." and creator. Josh
Schwartz, praises Heap whenever he
can. Unlike much of "The O.C.'s"
hype, Heap's is well-deserved.

Schoolyard
Heroes
The least known out of the three
picks. Schoolyard Heroes belongs in its
own musical category. As they are from
Seattle, if you listen closely you will
hear a little Nirvana, a bit of Soundgar
den, a splash of Heart and . . . Rob
Zombie?
Schoolyard Heroes' subject matter
is a bizarre mix of horror, zombies,

werewolves, robots and skeleton
armies. Yet there is nothing ghastly
about their latest CD, "Fantastic
Wounds." The music is tight and dri
ving. The biting guitar riffs and drums
are relentless, and lead singer Ryann
Donnelly's vocals are forceful.
With song titles like "Serial Killers
Know How to Party," "Centaur: Hall-
Man Half-Motorcycle" and"The Girl
Who Was Born Without a Face,"
Schoolyard Heroes is not afraid of the
creepy. They just finished touring with
Vendetta Red and Pretty Girls Make
Graves and will be playing shows most
ly in Washington for the next few
months. Hopefully they will make their
way down to the Bay Area soon.
This is not a band you will easily for
get, which is why they are Intermission's
dark horse pick for 2006.
