## The
						Future will Fucking Suck... According to mainstream Hollywood 
### FARIS ALI MOHUIDDIN INTERMISSION APOCALYPTO 
You know how people say we
must learn from the past or else we 're
doomed to repeat it? Well, according
to the movies, those people are full of
shit. If you're hankering for a
scathing critique of the slippery slope
on which your society has descended,
look not to the past hut rather the fu
ture where metaphors, monsters, ro
bots and gratuitous use of hyperbole
runs rampant. So, let's take a look at
some awful movies which depict an
equally awful future and maybe, just
maybe, we'll learn something...
The Last Man on Planet Earth
(1999) (set in: supposedly
ummm...the future) — During a
(what was then considered a far
fetched hypothetical) war with
Afghanistan, the Y-bomb all but de
stroys the male population. Seizing
the opportunity, the war-fearing
women survivors decide to outlaw
manhood in efforts to avoid future
conflict and toilet seats left up. But
then it dawns on them that they sort
of need men t0...y0u
know...sorta...procreate. Oh
women, never thinking things
through! Hence, they genetically
engineer a man devoid of the capac
ity to commit violence and — actu
ally, the plot's really irrelevant.
This entire blurb has been a thin
ly-veiled excuse for the following
Man-Hating Lesson: We mustn't
judge a world populated by lesbians
that only use men periodically as sex
slaves. One man's apocalyptic vision
is about 2.5 billion men's fantasy.
See, that's diversity.

Class of 1999 (199(1) (set in: suppos
edly, you guessed it: 1999) — Killer
robots are disguised as teachers to
keep the student body in line by any
means necessary — and you
thought the Honor Code and the
Fundamental Standard were intimi
dating! Maybe gruesome murder is
what public schools really meant by
invoking 'zero tolerance' policies.
Thought it couldn't get any worse?
Check out "Class of 1999 11: The
Substitute", in which renowned
method actor, Sasha Mitchell (of
Cody fame on TV's "Step by Step")
kills unruly students only to realize
he's not a robot-but just a angry man
in a bullet-proof vest that thinks he's
a robot. I think it's loosely based on
something Jane Austen wrote.

The Running Man (1987) (suppos
edly 2019) —The efficacy of the
penal system is a complex issue
which pundits, politicians and po
licemen have grappled with for
decades. But why the hell would you
waste a movie tackling those issues
when you could just force convicts to
fight to the death? This cinematic
catastrophe stars good ole Governa
tor Arnie (another method actor) as
a wrongfully accused convict who
must brave a maze of traps, torture
devices and maniacs in order to win
his freedom — all on national TV.
Although his takes place in the fu
ture. 1 am fairly sure ESPN 2 tried
this in the mid-nineties, and I'm sure
Fox tried it two to three times last
year.
The Island (2005) (supposedly 2019)
— Yeah, this only came out last year

but apparently no one saw it. So con
sider this your brush-up. This com
paratively less shitty Michael Bay Hick
centers around a society in which
clones are cultivated for no other rea
son than to provide spare parts should
their real-world counterparts need
them. The perfect cover for this per
verse recycling program? A mix be
tween reality TV and the lotto system
in which "winners" receive a one-way
ticket to the ideal island at which all
ones dreams come true. If by dreams
come true you mean dismembered
for scrap limbs, then you're spot on!
Can hottie clones Ewan McGreggor
and Scarlett Johansson liberate them
selves from this human chop shop?
Apparently, no one seemed to
care...so I won't delve into it.
No Escape (1994) 2022 —So you
want to enact a perverse incarna
tion of justice on criminals, but you
think nationally broadcast murder
as a game show is too humane? I
mean, they could survive! Thus, the
US in 2022 decides that the best way
to deal with crime is to take a cue
from the British and create Aus
tralia: Version 2.0. Yes, the worst of
the worst are relegated to an island
on which survival of the fittest is the
only recognized law.
