# Visit the future of GATTACA

### RYAN LAMPS INTERMISSION GENETICIST 
In JW7, director Andrew Niccol
used the debate surrounding the future
of genetic engineering as it aspiration for
his first movie, Today, almost tune
vegrs wtqr, *<Jattaca's" vision of the fu
nur remains as topical and thought
provoking as ever. jg
wealing in relation to "Back to
the Future, Part 2," director Robert
♦ Zemeckis claims that "the only kind of
future that the audience accepts is an
Orwellian, dark future." A casual
glance at popular science-fiction
movies confirms his belief. Films like
■"The Matrix." :"The Terminator" and
"I, Robot" alldepict bleak futures. Di
rector Andrew Niccol's debut feature.
•'Gatlapa 4 "lis no different.
However, Niccol uses the setting in
a more sophisticated way than these
other movies. To those directors, the
future is merely a device that enables
storylines involving the subjugation of
humans by malfunctioning robots.
Conversely, "Gattaca" uses the setting
to challenge its audience with difficult
questions about how society will con
front opportunities that lie ahead.
"Gattaca" is not just set in the future, it
is about the future.
The movie considers a world in
which genetic engineering allows par
ents to determine the complete genet
ic makeup of their children. With ge
netically perfect offspring, the film
proposes a new brand of discrimina
tion, one based on "science.'' Vincent,
played by Ethan Hawke, dreams of
going into space. Unfortunately, with
a life-expectancy of only 30 years, he
has little chance of being accepted into

the aerospace company Gattaca. The
film chronicles Vincent's efforts to tri
umph over a system determined to see '

him fail.
"Gattaca'' is an in-

telligent movie

with a rich
screen
play.

In an early scene, Vincent's parents
visit a geneticist who calmly advises
thorn that nothing should be "left to
chance" with their second child. "You
want to give your child the best possi
ble start. Believe me, we have enough
imperfections built in already...Keep
in mind the child is still you, simply the
best of you." "Gattaca's" premise is
entirely plausible because its charac
ters are making rational decisions.
And the screenplay dissects these deci
sions perfectly.
Michael Nynian's score is also be
yond reproach. Masterfully conveying
sadness in the film's characters while
pointing toward their eventual tri
umph. it is likely his finest work in cin
ema. "Gattaca" has an Orwellian feel
but it is also strangely uplifting.
Nyman's score captures both of these
elements beautifully.
Two of the film's performances are
also worth mentioning. Jude Law,
who plays the donor of a genetic iden
tity allowing Vincent to enter Gattaca,
is exceptional. His character is a mix of
conflicting emotions: frustrated be
cause his perfect DNA has not allowed
him to succeed but gratified because
Vincent is able to overcome the same
system that placed him second. Law
deftly conveys both emotions. It is not
surprising that he went on to become
one of 112 lolly wood's biggest stars.
"Gattaca" is not a perfect movie. The
film's murder mystery subplot is unin
teresting. And a twist involving Vin
cent's brother seems contrived and im
material. Nevertheless, it remains one
the best science-fiction films ever
made. Unlike "The Matrix'' and"I.
Robot," "Gattaca" has something in
teresting to say about the future. It is a
cautionary tale that challenges the
viewer and is a superb* piece of film
making.
