## As Uggs leave fashion-chic... the mullet returns 
### LAUREN OTERO INTERMISSION EUROPEAN 
Fashion trends in America are
either recycled or borrowed. From
70s hippie chic to the 80s Madon
na-inspired gear, signature styles
refuse to disappear entirely. In this
renaissance of fashion, styles
resurface time and again, often al
tered but still operating in full
force as mainstream trends.
In contrast, the source of new
fashions, and the inspiration for fu
ture looks are really just a plane
ride away, stationed in high-end
European fashion districts and on
the bodies of your average 20-
something Londoner.
Most fashions emerge from Eu
rope's trendy fashion scene before
making their way into chains
across America. Once trends hit
the American market, they debut
everywhere from high-end bou
tiques catering to celebrities all the
way to cheap mini-mall stores in
tended for the most fashion con
scious pedestrians.
Having just returned from a trip
to Europe, I noticed many unique
ly European fashions. Given that
our fashions lag just behind those
of Europe, it is only a matter of
time before these styles become
widespread among American fash
ionistas.
Out with the Ugg and in with the
new. European women trade the
heavy Ugg style —that somehow
still survives on Stanford campus,
in exchange for sleek sophistica
tion. Wearing their jeans and pants
tucked tightly into heeled laather
boots, Europeans aim for ele
gance.
Designs ynd styles vary widely
across the spectrum from the
wedged slouchy boot to the sleek.

straight kitten heeled version. No
matter what type of boot, the look
has created a common fashion
statement in cities from Edinburgh
to Milan.
Other fashionable European
items include the military style
jacket with metal buttons running
down the front panels, and for guys
and girls alike, the ultimate fashion
statement in Spain appeared in the
form of the mullet — bringing
back the "business in the front,
party in the back" deal. 1 doubt
that the Spanish realize that this is
one uniquely American look that
should have died with the 90s.
For a future look at fashion
trends one can either go the expen
sive route and vacation in Europe
or simply refer to high-end fashion
magazines like "Vogue" and "W."
In the mean time, keep your eyes
peeled for reappearances by the
leg warmer and other fashions
linked to the not-so-forgottfcn past.


The "Slater" look has crossed the
pond. God, he's gorgeous.
