# On Deck: Cal State Fullerton
## Marquess' troops enter season unranked for first time ever Questions abound for CSF opener Starting pitching, heart of the order identified as major concerns 
### SEAN BRUICH STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Cardinal face a stiff challenge
this weekend as the Cal State Fullerton Titans
visit Sunken Diamond to open the 2(M)6 base
ball season.
The Titans, who went 46-18 last season and
came within one win of a College World Series

appearance, are currently ranked by Baseball
America as the number five team in the country
and look poised for another run for Omaha.
"Cal State Fullerton will be a good test for
us," Stanford head coach Mark Marquess said.
"After this series, we'll have a much better idea
of where we need to improve."
Stanford baseball's dominance over the last
decade makes it difficult to imagine the pro
gram in the role of the underdog, but the Cardi
nal certainly have a lot to prove this weekend.
After going just 34-25 last season (and 12-12 in
the Pac-10), Stanford enters the season un
ranked in Baseball America's Top 25 for the

first time in history.
The 2006 team will rely heavily on an untest
ed starting rotation and an offense lacking an
established middle-of-the-order hitter. But the
Cardinal also possess a deep and experienced
roster, a dynamic cast of freshman and several
players with the potential for breakout per
formances.
It could be a season full of surprises, said Mar
quess, who named starting pitching as the top con
cern going into 2006.
With longtime rotation stalwarts Jeff Gilmore
and Mark Romanczuk now in professional base
hall, the Cardinal will turn to right-handers Greg
Reynolds and Matt Manship to take over the top
two weekend spots.
Reynolds was a much-heralded prospect out of
Terra Nova High School in Pacifica, Calif., but he
has struggled with injuries and inconsistency for

the last two sea
sons. He seemed
to find a groove
down the stretch
last season and
earned an instant
place in Stanford
lore with a gutsy,
11.0 inning per
formance against
Baylor in the
Waco Regional.
Overall, he went 2-
3 with a 5.08 ERA
in 22 games, five of
them starts.
"It's taken me
two years to get to
this point," said
Reynolds of his

"Nine" has led Stan
ford to 12 straight
NCAA Tournaments,
and captured the 1987
and 1988 national ti
tles on The Farm. Last
year's squad, however,
finished tied for sixth in
the Pac-10, Stanford's
worst ever

Friday night nod."lt's a testament to how hard I've
worked this offseason."
Manship, meanwhile, provided the Cardinal
with solid relief in the late innings all season long
last year, posting five saves, a 2-0 record and a mi
croscopic 0.80 ERA. But the senior has only made
three previous career starts, all of those coming in
his freshman and sophomore seasons.
If Fullerton has a weakness, it is their equally
inexperienced pitching staff. The Titans lost three
starters (Rickey Romero, Ryan Schreppel and
Scott Sarver) who combined for 28 wins and a 3.17
ERA last season. But the talent continues to flow
for Fullerton, who hope returning starter Wes
Roemer (7-3,3.90 ERA last season) and the inex
perienced but hard-throwing Jared Clark (1-1,
5.33 ERA) can quiet the Cardinal bats this series.
The bats are yet another concern for Stanford.
The team's offense was inconsistent and hit just
.287 on the 2005 season, seventh in the Pac-10 and
Stanford's lowest mark since 1994. While the line
up lost two huge run-producers in Jed Lowrie
(.317, 14 HR, 66 RBI) and John Mayberry. Jr.
(.303,8 HR.53 RBI) to the draft last spring.it does
return six starters.
"I can't remember the last time that we didn't
have an All-Conference player returning," said
Marquess. 'We've also lost the middle of our line
up. But the good news is that our defense will be
solid. We have some returning seniors to provide
leadership and we have good freshman players
who will push the regulars for playing time."
The team's leading hitter, junior Adam Sorgi,
rebounded from a rough freshman campaign to
hit .322 with five homeruns and 41 RBI last year.
He, along with a trio of seniors — catcher John
Hester (.282,5 HR,4I RBI), shortstop Chris Mi
naker (.291,3 HR.37 RBI) and leftfielder-turned
second baseman Chris Lewis(.266,B HR,35 RBI)
— are expected to be major factors in the offense
this season.
But perhaps the most dynamic player on the
Cardinal roster is sophomore right fielder Michael
Taylor, who has the potential to be exactly the type
of power-hitting offensive threat that the Cardinal
need. The 6-foot-6, 250-pound Taylor improved
tremendously over the course of the season (.289,
4 HR, 28 R81,9 SB) before dominating the Alas
ka League this summer.
Speedy centerfielder Jim Rappaport (.297, 3
HR, 25 RBI) and DH/outfielders Ryan Seawell
(.250, 2 HR. 9 RBI) and Brendan Domaracki
(.208,1 HR, 14 RBI) also all saw playing time last
season and are expected to start on a regular basis.
"I think we'll be a better offensive team this sea
son," said Hester."Top to bottom as a team, we have
a lot more balance and a lot more experience."
Several freshman, including Jason Castro and
Brent Melville, who are already pushing for play
ing time at first base, and a pair of highly regarded
two-way players in Sean Ratliff and Jeremy Ble
ich, are also likely to see action early in the season.
The Titans are expected to be a dangerous of
fensive force once again and return five .300+ hit
ters to the lineup this season. Known for their pro
fessional approach at the plate, Fullerton hitters
averaged 7.4 runs per game last season (compared
to Stanford's 6.4).The offense will be led by senior
outfielder Danny Dorn (.272,10 HR, and 49 RBI
in 2005) and junior first baseman Brett Pill (.327,9
HR. 57 RBI).
A record-tying 14 players were drafted out of
Cal State Fullerton last season, but in a testament
to the players' faith in head coach George Horton,
five members of the starting lineup elected to re
turn for their senior campaigns, including Dorn,
whom Baseball America tabbed as their top sen
ior prospect.
The series with Fullerton is just the beginning
of what could be a brutal preseason schedule for
the Cardinal. In the first six weeks of the season,
the team will face off against five Top 25 teams in
cluding the defending National Champion and
No. 1 ranked Texas Longhorns February 17-19.

Scott Sarver) who combined for 28 wins and a 3.17
ERA last season. But the talent continues to flow
for Fullerton, who hope returning starter Wes
Roemer (7-3,3.90 ERA last season) and the inex
perienced but hard-throwing Jared Clark (1-1,
5.33 ERA) can quiet the Cardinal bats this series.
The bats are yet another concern for Stanford.
The team's offense was inconsistent and hit just
.287 on the 2005 season, seventh in the Pac-10 and
Stanford's lowest mark since 1994. While the line
up lost two huge run-producers in Jed Lowrie
(.317, 14 HR, 66 RBI) and John Mayberry. Jr.
(.303,8 HR.53 RBI) to the draft last spring.it does
return six starters.
"I can't remember the last time that we didn't
have an All-Conference player returning," said
Marquess. 'We've also lost the middle of our line
up. But the good news is that our defense will be
solid. We have some returning seniors to provide
leadership and we have good freshman players
who will push the regulars for playing time."
The team's leading hitter, junior Adam Sorgi,
rebounded from a rough freshman campaign to
hit .322 with five homeruns and 41 RBI last year.
He, along with a trio of seniors — catcher John
Hester (.282,5 HR,4I RBI), shortstop Chris Mi
naker (.291,3 HR.37 RBI) and leftfielder-turned
second baseman Chris Lewis(.266,B HR,35 RBI)
— are expected to be major factors in the offense
this season.
But perhaps the most dynamic player on the
Cardinal roster is sophomore right fielder Michael
Taylor, who has the potential to be exactly the type
of power-hitting offensive threat that the Cardinal
need. The 6-foot-6, 250-pound Taylor improved
tremendously over the course of the season (.289,
4 HR, 28 R81,9 SB) before dominating the Alas
ka League this summer.
Speedy centerfielder Jim Rappaport (.297, 3
HR, 25 RBI) and DH/outfielders Ryan Seawell
(.250, 2 HR. 9 RBI) and Brendan Domaracki
(.208,1 HR, 14 RBI) also all saw playing time last
season and are expected to start on a regular basis.
"I think we'll be a better offensive team this sea
son," said Hester."Top to bottom as a team, we have
a lot more balance and a lot more experience."
Several freshman, including Jason Castro and
Brent Melville, who are already pushing for play
ing time at first base, and a pair of highly regarded
two-way players in Sean Ratliff and Jeremy Ble
ich, are also likely to see action early in the season.
The Titans are expected to be a dangerous of
fensive force once again and return five .300+ hit
ters to the lineup this season. Known for their pro
fessional approach at the plate, Fullerton hitters
averaged 7.4 runs per game last season (compared
to Stanford's 6.4).The offense will be led by senior
outfielder Danny Dorn (.272,10 HR, and 49 RBI
in 2005) and junior first baseman Brett Pill (.327,9
HR. 57 RBI).
A record-tying 14 players were drafted out of
Cal State Fullerton last season, but in a testament
to the players' faith in head coach George Horton,
five members of the starting lineup elected to re
turn for their senior campaigns, including Dorn,
whom Baseball America tabbed as their top sen
ior prospect.
The series with Fullerton is just the beginning
of what could be a brutal preseason schedule for
the Cardinal. In the first six weeks of the season,
the team will face off against five Top 25 teams in
cluding the defending National Champion and
No. 1 ranked Texas Longhorns February 17-19.
The Stanford Cardinal face a stiff challenge
this weekend as the Cal State Fullerton Titans
visit Sunken Diamond to open the 2(M)6 base
ball season.
The Titans, who went 46-18 last season and
came within one win of a College World Series

appearance, are currently ranked by Baseball
America as the number five team in the country
and look poised for another run for Omaha.
"Cal State Fullerton will be a good test for
us," Stanford head coach Mark Marquess said.
"After this series, we'll have a much better idea
of where we need to improve."
Stanford baseball's dominance over the last
decade makes it difficult to imagine the pro
gram in the role of the underdog, but the Cardi
nal certainly have a lot to prove this weekend.
After going just 34-25 last season (and 12-12 in
the Pac-10), Stanford enters the season un
ranked in Baseball America's Top 25 for the

first time in history.
The 2006 team will rely heavily on an untest
ed starting rotation and an offense lacking an
established middle-of-the-order hitter. But the
Cardinal also possess a deep and experienced
roster, a dynamic cast of freshman and several
players with the potential for breakout per
formances.
It could be a season full of surprises, said Mar
quess, who named starting pitching as the top con
cern going into 2006.
With longtime rotation stalwarts Jeff Gilmore
and Mark Romanczuk now in professional base
hall, the Cardinal will turn to right-handers Greg
Reynolds and Matt Manship to take over the top
two weekend spots.
Reynolds was a much-heralded prospect out of
Terra Nova High School in Pacifica, Calif., but he
has struggled with injuries and inconsistency for

the last two sea
sons. He seemed
to find a groove
down the stretch
last season and
earned an instant
place in Stanford
lore with a gutsy,
11.0 inning per
formance against
Baylor in the
Waco Regional.
Overall, he went 2-
3 with a 5.08 ERA
in 22 games, five of
them starts.
"It's taken me
two years to get to
this point," said
Reynolds of his

tles on The Farm. Last
year's squad, however,

the Pac-10, Stanford's

Manship, meanwhile, provided the Cardinal
with solid relief in the late innings all season long
last year, posting five saves, a 2-0 record and a mi
croscopic 0.80 ERA. But the senior has only made
three previous career starts, all of those coming in
his freshman and sophomore seasons.
If Fullerton has a weakness, it is their equally
inexperienced pitching staff. The Titans lost three
starters (Rickey Romero, Ryan Schreppel and
Scott Sarver) who combined for 28 wins and a 3.17
ERA last season. But the talent continues to flow
for Fullerton, who hope returning starter Wes
