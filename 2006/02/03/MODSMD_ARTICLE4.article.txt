# On Deck: Cal State Fullerton
## Marquess' troops enter season unranked for first time ever Questions abound for CSF opener Starting pitching, heart of the order identified as major concerns 
### SEAN BRUICH STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Cardinal face a stiff challenge
this weekend as the Cal State Fullerton Titans
visit Sunken Diamond to open the 2(M)6 base
ball season.
The Titans, who went 46-18 last season and
came within one win of a College World Series

appearance, are currently ranked by Baseball
America as the number five team in the country
and look poised for another run for Omaha.
"Cal State Fullerton will be a good test for
us," Stanford head coach Mark Marquess said.
"After this series, we'll have a much better idea
of where we need to improve."
Stanford baseball's dominance over the last
decade makes it difficult to imagine the pro
gram in the role of the underdog, but the Cardi
nal certainly have a lot to prove this weekend.
After going just 34-25 last season (and 12-12 in
the Pac-10), Stanford enters the season un
ranked in Baseball America's Top 25 for the

first time in history.
The 2006 team will rely heavily on an untest
ed starting rotation and an offense lacking an
established middle-of-the-order hitter. But the
Cardinal also possess a deep and experienced
roster, a dynamic cast of freshman and several
players with the potential for breakout per
formances.
