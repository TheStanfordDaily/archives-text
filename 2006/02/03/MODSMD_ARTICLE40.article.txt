### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION SEX GODDESS OF THE FUTURE 
While many people are going
around telling us kiddies to value our
"virtue," and wait for true love, there
are many of you that understand what
Roxy's been telling you all along:
Fuck virtue and why wait? Not to dis
on those that have taken his words lit
erally, but where's the fun in that? I
mean, Roxy values love as much as the
next person, but who knows when
we'll find love, for all I know I may die
a virgin tomorrow. Of course, that's
not true because, well 1 am the sex
goddess. Anyway, back to my point: as
we all know, the future of sex is that
more people will be having more sex.
At least that's the number one prayer
in Roxy's agenda. Here at Stanford,
hopefully the future of sex will comply
with the motto: More is better.
I mean really, as college students
we are in the prime of our lives. Never
again will we have so many people at
our command. Roxy knows this first
hand, having fished in this ocean many
times. The time will come when we'll
all have to settle down, get real jobs,
and *gasp get married.
Obviously in college we need to
make the most of our time and get it all
out of our systems, or should we?
Think about this: Many statistics tell
us that by the time we get married our
sex lives will diminish. That doesn't
sound like much fun, now does it?
Here's a statistic Roxy does like:
The more sex you have, the more you
need it. Apparently a guy who's get
ting laid constantly, needs to mastur
bate up to ten times more than a guy
who isn't. So what does this mean for
our future? It means we need to set
the standard now! The future of sex
depends on it.
You don't want to be one of those

people who lose their sex lives the
minute they graduate from college.
But Roxy, you say, that'll never hap
pen to me. Au contraire mon frere-it
could happen to you. So what do you
do? Well, my dears you've come to the
right woman. Roxy says find yourself
a little hookup buddy-you know,
someone who's ready to go at the drop
of a hat.
How do you find this person? Fig
ure it out. This campus affords so
many opportunities to meet people,
you just need to be creative in how you
approach them. I mean, as Roxy
knows, a coy little line can work mira
cles. In fact, forget about a line alto
gether, what about a look. Remember
in Wedding Crashers when the "prop
er girl in the hat" seduces Vince
Vaughn with a single look. Yeah,
point made.
Once you've seduced your sweetie,
now comes the fun stuff. Keep in mind
that people need sex and contrary to
popular belief, girls are just as horny as
guys are. Believe me, Roxy always has
to hear from her girly friends how
much they need ass tonight!
Just remember the three funda
mentals: scented candles, massage oil,
and alcohol. Never underestimate the
power of a little buzz-not full on
drunkenness because... well some
people can't perform under those cir
cumstances. Now, if you give this per
son the best night of their lives-up
against a wa11... oops sorry Roxy's
reminiscing here... then you'll be guar
anteed another hookup.
So people, if you follow Roxy's ad
vice, you'll get plenty of sex, and you
will help to secure the future of sex by
making it impossible for anybody to
go without sex. So, by the time you get
*gasp hitched, the problem won't be
too little sex, it'll be finding a new and
more exciting place to do it. Now
that's a beautiful world.
