## Law School to host Mock Trial contest Six local law schools invited to The Farm to compete for nationals 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
This weekend, teams from six local
law schools will convene to compete in
the third annual Bay Area Mock TVial
Invitational, hosted by the Stanford
Law School's Mock Trial team.
"One of the things [the founders of
the Stanford Mock Trial team] wanted
to do to get the team off the ground was
to host an invitational where teams
would come and compete against one

another before the big regional compe
tition that determines who goes on to
nationals," said team president and
third-year law student Rae Wmxls.
Stanford will be joined by teams
such as Boalt Hall of UC-Berkeley,
Golden Gate University School of Law.
Santa Clara University School of Law.
UC-Hastings College of the Law and
UCLA School of Law, according to the
team's Web site.
The 18 teams currently slated to
compete make this invitational the
largest one yet.
"It's a little bit bigger every year"
said third-year law student and vice
president of the invitational Brian
Sandstrom, "but that just gives more
people the opportunity to participate."
He added that the invitational is an
opportunity for the teams to practice
before the major competition in Los
Angeles in late February.
"A lot of the law schools have more
teams than they can send to Ange
les, so we and some other schools use it
also as a way of looking at our teams

and determining who we think will be
the best qualified to compete," he said.
"It also lets people who aren't neces
sarily going to be able to go to Los An
geles have an opportunity to compete
in what we think is a decent replica of
what goes on elsewhere," Sandstrom
continued.
When the teams arrive the morning
of Feb. 4, they will compete in a three
hour trial. After a lunch break,there will
be another three-hour trial in which the
team members will switch roles. The
competition will be judged by local
legal professionals.
"On Sunday, most of the other

schools will go home, and then we'll
have what we're calling the 'Stanford
Showdown. " Wotnls said. "That's be
cause we have so much interest in Mock
Trial at Stanford that we have too many
teams. Those teams are going to com
pete against each other on Sunday to
figure out who's the best of the best, and
then the top two teams will progress to
the regionals."
Each Mock Trial team consists of
five students — two defense attorneys,
two plaintiff attorneys and an alternate.
Students take turns playing witnesses.
Woods described the format of the
Mock Trial program.

"The trials are usually about three
hours long, and they include everything
from opening statements to a mock
jury, to direct examination and cross-ex
amination of witnesses, to closing argu
ments," he said. "We go from the begin
ning of the trial until the end, just like
they do in real life."
Teams use fact patterns, usually
about 6() pages long, which include
background material on the case as well
as statements from the fictional wit
nesses.
"Usually the fact patterns are based
on real cases and they just change some
of the facts around to make it more in

teresting or to make it simpler," Woods
said.
This year's case involves a field me
chanic pressing charges after a pulley
system broke and caused the 3,(XX)-
pound watering pump he was lifting to
fall on him.
"It's a pretty technical case," Woods
said. "The issues in the case are whether
the person which they were renting the
hoist from had a duty to maintain it and
make sure it was working properly. As
far as legal elements, we have to prove
they had a duty, that they breached their
duty and then that that's what caused
his injury."

Woods called Mock Trial "just a fan
tastic opportunity to learn the rules of
evidence. You learn them in depth
when you're standing up there arguing
an objection."
"You have to be prepared and you
have to respond on your feet," she
added. "It requires a lot of fast thinking.
Another thing is public speaking skills...
It's so important for lawyers to be able
to communicate, and especially with
this [year's] case, it's so complicated and
technical that trying to distill it into
something that's easy to understand
and entertaining is going to be a chal
lenge."
