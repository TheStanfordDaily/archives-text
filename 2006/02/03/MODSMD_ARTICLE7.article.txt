## Networking skills to cure your social ills 
### MIMA MOHAMMED CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Widely acknowledged as a huh for today's intellectuals, Stanford is also
home to students sometimes lacking in social graces. Yesterday's workshop,
"Networking: It's Not Just Schmoosing & Using," hosted by the Career Devel
opment Center (CDC), provided tips for those who feel uncomfortable in so-

cial and business settings.
The event was a precursor
to the CDC's Networking
Luncheon slated for Satur
day Feb. 4.
Goals of the workshop
included sharing network
ing tips to use during Satur
day's career conference and
convincing attendees that
networking is not as scary
or soulless as it may seem.
Students participated in
a series of role-play exer
cises, practicing self-intro
ductions and establishing
rapport. One of the key tips
given to students was to al
ways state where they are
from â€” because it leads to
more conversation topics.
Stern said that it is always a
good idea to know before
hand what you want to
achieve from a networking
situation, whether it is to
learn more about a specific
organization, particular in
dustry, career field or grad
uate school.
Stern stressed that stu
dents should not feel un-

comfortable about simply speaking to someone for the sole purpose of obtain
ing information or a job. She explained that the alumni come back to Stanford
because they want to have an opportunity to connect with students and share
their experiences and stories. While it is inappropriate to straight out ask an

alum for an internship, sincerely asking how
they got their first jobs or if they can help point
to someone who can aid in their internship
searches is legitimate, she said.
"Networking is more like connecting; it is re
ally a two way exchange," Stern said. "It is al
ways good to have an idea in mind before going
to the event. You are not just using them to get
information, because in a dialogue you have in
formation to share with them as well. Everyone
has someone to bring to the conversation."
Students expressed interest in learning tips on

how to end conversations, especially since it can
be awkward when potential topics are exhausted.
"I hate that creeping feeling of guilt after
you're done talking," said a freshman who
asked not to be named. "You feel like you've
just used the person and feel like you have to say
sorry or something."
Stern said that students should use the op
portunity at the end of interactions to summa
rize and clarify their points and always remem
ber to say thank you before exiting gracefully.
"I always tell people that if they arc shy. they
should take an extroverted friend to this type of
event, so their friend can help them and make
the experience more fun," Stern said.
The biggest "don't" when networking. Stern
added, is specifically asking the individual with
whom you are speaking to help find an intern

ship, provide a job or call a contact they have
provided because you are too shy to do it your
self. Role-playing with roommates or counselors
at the CDC is always a great way to enhance
proactive communication techniques as well.
Senior Sanghyup Kwak praised the practical
importance of the workshops.
"Networking is the basis of pretty much any
business activity," he said. "All major deals and
negotiations are done through contacts and
networking."
This year's Career Week included a variety
of events that can be found at the CDC website.
Although many of the events on Saturday may
already be booked, not all registered students
may show up. For example, while 65 students
registered for yesterday's workshop, a little
under half took part.
