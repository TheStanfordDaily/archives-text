After two mediocre Thai dining expe
riences in the Palo Alto area, 1 was over
joyed to find AmarinThai Cuisine, where
my growing fear of living in an area trag
ically devoid of good Thai food was hap
pily dispelled. Amarin is one of many
restaurants that line Mountain View's
Castro Street. If you. like me last Friday,
want to eat out but aren't sure where you
want to go, heading over to Castro Street
will ensure that you have a buffet of
restaurant options to choose from. My
friends and I mulled over the possibilities
of Japanese or Italian, before we fortu
itously stumbled upon Amarin.
Walking through Amarin's door. I was
greeted by the rather unpleasant odor of
stale cigarette smoke, which unfortunate
ly overpowered the otherwise inviting
smell of spices. Even though the dining
room was full of chatting customers, my
friends and I were seated immediately, a
sign of Amarin's extremely efficient staff.
A hostess led us through the large, bright,
tastefully decorated dining room featur
ing several tatami-style sunken tables in
addition to regular seating. All the tables
sported blue and gold plates, with nap
kins and real flowers, an aesthetic plus. As
we walked, I was relieved to observe that
the smoke smell did not pervade
throughout the entire restaurant.
Amarin offers an extensive menu
that includes many Thai favorites, un
less you're a connoisseur of noodle dish
es; as the smallest section on the menu,
the noodles selection did not include
übiquitous Pad See Ewe or Drunken
Noodles. But Amarin does offer more
noodle dishes at lunch — at about a dol
lar less than the dinner prices to boot.
Dinner prices are already fairly reason
able; most items cost from $7.95 to
$9.95. Seafood dishes cost a few dollars
more, and there is a one dollar charge
for white rice. For the health-conscious,
brown rice is available for $1.50.
If you're a vegetarian, a vegan or sim
ply a person who loves to eat their vegeta
bles, Amarin offers an entirely vegetarian
menu in addition to its standard fare. It
also goes to great lengths to be friendly
toward both spice lovers and those with
more timid pallets. Their menu makes a
point of stating "Thai food is not always
too spicy — please indicate the degree of
spiciness desired." This put the trepida
tion of one of my friends to rest.
After battling indecision in the face
of a multitude of tasty possibilities, my
dining party settled on fresh spring rolls
($7.95). Pad Thai ($8.95), Fresh Mango
with Tofu ($10.95) and Cashew Chicken
($8.95). Our appetizer arrived quickly.
Arranged in pieces of varying height to
create a flower shape, the spring rolls
came with both a sweet and a spicy chili
sauce and included enough pieces for a
group of four to enjoy two each.
Amarin's skillfully inconspicuous
servers ushered away finished dishes at
the precise moment they were completed.
We also did not wait long before our main
courses were served. As further evidence
of Amarin's conscientious service, my re
quest to exclude peanuts from my meal
due to an allergy was honored, unlike at
many other Iliai restaurants. Earning
Amarin major points.
The presentation of the main dishes
was as carefully executed as that of the
appetizer.The MangoTofu rested inside
a hollowed out mango, and all dishes in
cluded decorative garnish that made
them look as good as they tasted. The
Cashew Chicken was especially tasty.
Far from the sometimes "gloppy," super
sweet fried monstrosity this dish can
sometimes be, Amarin's Cashew Chick
en was an absolutely delicious saute,
which benefited greatly from the use of
fresh ginger. The Pad 'ITiai had a mild
but tasty flavor. My friend raved about
it,saying,"l seriously think this might be
the best Pad Thai I've ever had." Al
though I did enjoy the Pad Thai, I per
sonally preferred the other dishes and
would probably try a stir-fry or curry
dish instead next time. And there will
definitely be a next time.
