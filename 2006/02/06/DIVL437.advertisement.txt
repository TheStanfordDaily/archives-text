Come see if American Studies is
right for you!
What can I do with an American studies major?
American studies majors become lawyers, journalists, health
researchers, filmmakers, marketing gurus, artists, museum
curators, heads of non-profit foundations, management
consultants, college professors, and more! A strong liberal arts
education will prepare you for any field you decide to pursue.
What will I study?
Besides foundational classes, American studies helps you design
your own thematic concentration such as Race and Law in
America, Contemporary Popular Culture, America and the Global
Economy, The Artist in American Society,
and Gender in American Culture.
You can study what interests you.
Want to learn more?
