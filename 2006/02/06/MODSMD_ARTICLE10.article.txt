## How to go on a coffee date 
### 
Do not call it a coffee date. Do
not call it a date. Do not call it
anything other than "stopping
by the CoHo after class." It doesn't
matter whether or not you actually
enjoy drinking coffee, or if the mere
smell of roasted beans makes you
throw up a little. A coffee date is one of
two socially acceptable dating-like situ
ations on the Stanford campus, the
other one being accidentally touching
the Treehouse cashier's hand when he
gives you your change. But you are
pretty sure that Julio is married, so even
though his skin is creamy and smooth,
you are going to have to resort to a cof
fee date with the hot girl from your
stats section. Just don't call it a date.
The best time to approach the girl is
right after section as people are pack
ing up their books. You will of course
have remembered to find a seat next
to her for just this reason, because
sprinting across the room to ask a
chick out is social suicide. Even walk
ing across the room to ask a chick out
is social suicide. No, you will have se
cured a seat next to her at all costs,
even if it means telling someone that
they must vacate that particular seat
because you have very sensitive but
tocks and that is the only chair that
won't give you a rash. But make sure
that she doesn't hear that part. Rashes
are social suicide.
You should begin the post-section
conversation with a clever comment
about the course material. "This class
blows," is a good one. "I am going to
kill myself," is not. "This quiz is going
to dominate me with a giant chi
squared phallus," is ideal. Anything
that expresses the joy of learning or a
coherent grasp of statistical concepts
is completely unacceptable. You need
to show her that you are quick, witty
and definitely not a nerd.
If you are lucky your comment will
make her laugh. This is a good sign.
Take the opportunity to ask her how
she did on the problem set, or if she
also thinks that your TA looks like a
child molester. Smile. Lean in closer.
Pretend that you are not trying to look
at her boobs out of the corner of your
eye. If you can keep the conversation
going for a few minutes, make your
move and tell her that you need some
caffeine. Tell her that you are going to
stop by the CoHo for a few minutes
and grab a latte. Casually mention that
she is welcome to join you.
Assuming she says yes, keep up the
small talk as you make your way across
White Plaza. Ask her where she lives.
If she lives in a Row House, ask her
how often she has to hash dishes. If she
lives in a co-op, ask her how often she
smokes hash. If she lives near a dining
hall, ask her how she likes the hash
browns. If she lives in SLE. punch her
in the face as hard as you can. Living in
SLE is social suicide.
As you enter the CoHo, everyone
will stare at you accusingly as if you
had entered the CoHo against its will.
Ignore them. Confidently stroll over
to the cashier and order a latte and
whatever your date wants. Pay for
your date's drink before she can
protest. Make your way to the picnic
tables toward the entrance, because
the bistro tables are too exposed and
the couches are for vagrants. You will
not be able to sit comfortably at the
picnic tables because they were made
for legless midgets, but do not com
plain about this to your date. Also do
not allow her to see that you have
burned your tongue on your latte and
are now fighting back tears.
Breathe deeply. Relax. Continue
to talk about life. Laugh when she
tries to make a joke. Look serious
when she tells you something deep.
Sip your latte slowly and begin to
enjoy the warmth of the beverage, the
quality of the conversation and the
pleasure of her company. And be
proud that you, a Stanford student,
are on a coffee date.
