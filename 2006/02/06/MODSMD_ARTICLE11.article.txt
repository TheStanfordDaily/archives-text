# SERVE UP SOME MENTORSHIP
## Stanford students do homework, play sports with school kids in the East Palo Alto Tennis and Tutoring Program 
### SINI MATIKAINEN 
The East Palo Alto Tennis and Tutoring
program unites hundreds of volunteers
with East Palo Alto youth each week
for academic mentoring. Many Stanford stu
dents serve as volunteers, but EPATT itself is
a separate, nonprofit organization. EPATT
differs from conventional tutoring programs
in that it emphasizes both physical exertion
and intellectual exploration â€” Stanford vol
unteers provide not only academic tutoring
but also help full-time EPATT staff facilitate
tennis games twice a week.
"We use tennis as a tool to reinforce the
message of hard work, endurance and effort
as well as give kids an opportunity to learn a
new sport and get much needed exercise."
says Kesha Weekes, who graduated from
Stanford and now works as the academic di
rector of the EPATT program. "The purpose
of the program is to assist our 100 kinder
garten through 12th-grade participants and
their families achieve their students' highest
academic and athletic potential."
The program reaches this goal through
one-on-one tutoring sessions between Stan
ford volunteers and East Palo Alto school
kids. Each volunteer commits to semi-week
ly tutoring sessions that last 90 minutes and
focus on homework help and responsible ac
ademic habits. Either before of after their tu
toring sessions, the school kids can play ten
nis at Stanford's facilities under the supervi
sion of EPATT staff.
The program has enjoyed considerable
success, including an award from the Associ
ation ofTennis Professionals for being one of
the nation's top 10 best tennis programs for
underprivileged children. The East Palo
Alto students participating in the program
have also shown considerable improvement.
Stanford senior Alexandra Backis,the af
ternoon tutor coordinator, says she feels that
personal attention is at the heart of the pro
gram's success.
"Because EPATT is a one-on-one tutor

ing program, you have the amazing opportu
nity to really get to know a student and be
more than just a tutor, but also a mentor and
friend," Backis says.
Started in 1990 by former professional
and Stanford tennis player Jeff Arons, the
program now works with hundreds of volun
teers and East Palo Alto youth. An average
of 80 to 100 Stanford community members
volunteer each quarter and are paired with
1 (K) to 110 East Palo Alto school kids, rang
ing from kindergarteners to high school sen
iors.
The students are broken up into three
groups: kindergarten and elementary
school, middle school and high school. Each
student comes to Stanford twice a week for

90 minutes of tutoring and an hour of tennis.
Tutor coordinators from Stanford drive
students from East Palo Alto to the Farm for
the program. In contrast to volunteers, tutor
coordinators are paid and must apply for the
position. Coordinators are responsible for
administrative tasks, transportation and
monitoring the academic progress of stu
dents in the program. In addition, tutor coor
dinators work the same number of hours as
volunteers, who they support in various ways.
"1 like to think that tutor coordinators are
the cheerleaders of EPATT. making sure that
volunteers feel loved and appreciated, be
cause they most definitely are," Backis says.
While many of the volunteers and coordi
nators are undergraduates, graduate stu

dents are also involved in the organization.
"We do have several Stanford graduate
students that help during tutoring as well as
on the court."says Linda Khiev. a volunteer
and afternoon tutorial coordinator. "They
definitely bring a level of maturity and wis
dom our kids benefit greatly from."
The tutors themselves also benefit from
the relationships they form through EPATT.
Development Director Mary Liz Maletis
says that she greatly enjoys her interactions
with the students in the program.
"It is very rewarding being in direct con
tact with the EPATT kids," Maletis says.
"They are courteous,enthusiastic students. It
is amazing to see the progress they make."
Sophomore volunteer Becca Velasco
agrees that tutoring relationships are defi
nitely beneficial to both sides.
"I've tutored Elena Chavez, a fourth grad
er, since I started working with EPAIT last
year," Velasco says. "I've seen her grow
tremendously, and watching her progress with
her academics has been really rewarding."
Velasco also praises the program's flexi
bility. Volunteers can choose to work either
Mondays and Wednesdays or Tuesdays and
Thursdays, and EPATT strives to provide
volunteers with convenient tutoring times.
"I like the program because it's very casu
al and the tutor coordinators really try hard
to accommodate our busy schedules," Velas
co says.
For those seeking a unique community
service activity, EPATI' offers a flexible
schedule, a rewarding personal relationship
with a tutee and a chance to practice one's
backhand.
And. as Backis points out, "It's a fun and
easy way to get out of the Stanford Bubble
without ever having to leave campus."
