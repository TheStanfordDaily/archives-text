English Department lec
turer Adam Johnson is
teaching a course titled
"Intro to the Creative Writing
Minor" this quarter. His stu
dents have been working on
writing "speed villanelles" —
poems that students write col
laboratively under strict time
limits. Other groups of students
wrote villanelles without time
limits, and still others wrote
sonnets and blank-verse
poems. Johnson wants to share
his students' work with the
Stanford community.

Villanelle for Durand
It is an old and dying structure
Chipped walls and falling paint
Above the sink lies a dripping rupture
You'll sit on faded, cold furniture
The sound of the stair is hardly faint
It is an old and dying structure
Walls faded to the color of ancient scripture
Its wet long after it raint
Above the sink likes a dripping rupture
Haunted by an opera overture
You want to fix it, but you caint
It is an old and dying structure
There's rust all over the lamp fixture
On the mattress where you've just laint
Above the sink lies a dripping rupture
It will make you feel like in rapture
Likened to a body part, it is the taint
It is an old and dying structure
Above the sink likes a dripping rupture
— junior Caleb Thomas

The follmnng two speed villanelles were written in under 10 minutes by /fairs oj students in Johnson 'v eourse

Hungry in Homeroom
It speaks to me in the middle of class
Drowning out the professor's voice
My stomach is such a pain in the ass
Our lesson was moved out onto the grass
I was pleased with the old fogy's choice
For it speaks to me in the middle of class
We gathered our books and marched out en masse
Rumbling footsteps matching its noise
My stomach is such a pain in the ass
I am so desperate, I could eat trash
I have the hunger, but not the poise
It speaks to me in the middle of class
My mind moves to money-have I the cash?
For a decadent brownie, warm and moist?
My stomach is such a pain in the ass
Thank god this class is my last
And onto my shoulder my purse I'll soon hoist
It speaks to me in the middle of class
My stomach is such a pain in the ass
— senior Morgan Thrower and junior Jasmine Hanifi

lhis villamHe was written without time limits:
Black Ski Weekend 2006
Specks of black in pure white snow.
Two strangers meet with feet locked in skis.
And up the lift do we go.
To he polite I take the conversation slow
And ask him about this cold wintry freeze.
Specks of black in pure white snow.
"It's cold, but not like these white folks-you
know?"
I nod, but wonder if it's just a matter of degrees.
And up the lift do we go.
He's come with his family for five years or so.
But when he was a boy he ate
government cheese.
Specks of black in pure white snow.
How far we've gone up the mountain,
neither of us know.
Our vision is obscured by more than
just the trees.
Specks of black in pure white snow.
And up the lift do we go.
