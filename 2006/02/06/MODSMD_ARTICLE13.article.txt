## Editorial Edit Board bids farewell 
### 
The Daily Editorial Board doesn't often
take time to reflect on its positions.
Sometimes this leads us to contradict
ourselves, especially between volumes when
the members of the board change. Some
times this gives us the freedom we need to
change our minds, because we do. But as The
Daily transitions from one editorial board to
another, we feel it's worth looking back on
how we've succeeded and where we've
failed.
The Editorial Board meets weekly and
discusses everything involving Stanford that
we can come up with. We discuss world
events, trends that affect the University, per
sonal and collective complaints, and, yes,
even places where we think the administra
tion is doing a great job. Most of these don't
turn into editorials.
Sometimes we strongly disagree with
each other, and often we decide that there is
little that our voice can add. What more can
we say about the Israel-Palestine conflict, for
example? So we try to stick to Stanford issues
that affect a number of students and look at
all sides involved to pick out those that are
actually responsible. For instance, we have
been as critical of the senior class presidents'
handling of Commencement as we were of
the administration. And last spring we called
on students to stop complaining about advis
ing and take initiative to improve their own
educations.
Mostly, we try to comment where we
think there has not been enough discussion,
or where we see concrete improvements that
can be made. While we aren't going to fix the
world, we take our role as self-appointed ad
visers seriously. We know no one chose us.
but we also know that there's no one else
who is going to evaluate the ASSU presiden
tial candidates or represent student views to
the administration with well-reasoned, con
textually sound arguments.
Sometimes, our editorials make a differ
ence. On Commencement, for example, we
scored a victory for student participation,
which should pay dividends in the long term
— not just on this one issue.
The Law School is officially switching to
the quarter system, though gradually. And
even though we don't hold much sway on
that part of campus, we hope that the Edito
rial Board and the rest of Stanford will keep

pushing to integrate the professional school
with the rest of the University.
We made some small strides involving
dining — it has gotten easier to change your
meal plan online, and over time Stanford
Dining has become much more responsive to
student input.
The Course Guide is finally being re
vamped after The Daily spent many volumes
calling for changes. After our editorial re
questing more centralized party planning,
there is now a nascent party registry calen
dar. And the University is looking into pro
viding improved winter break options for in
ternational students — in fact, a pilot pro
gram is already in motion for next winter
break.
But perhaps most exciting of all, the new
Stanford Stadium will include a revamped
student section right next to the field — in
stead of all the way up the stands. And with
free student admission, we hope that the
football team can build a fan base similar to
that of the Sixth Man section.
Not all our requests have been met when
it comes to the Stadium. In a little-noticed
loss, the young alumni and former athlete
benefit of $75 admission to everything but
Big Game has disappeared. Now recent stu
dents get the "benefit" of $234 tickets, a 17
percent increase on the most expensive tick
ets last year.
But we were bound to lose some of our
battles. Past volumes have called for divest
ment from companies operating in Sudan
and increased financial aid (successfully) and
lower tuition and a more scientific alcohol
policy (unsuccessfully).
Hie Editorial Board, under new direction
starting tomorrow, will keep fighting for the
same general causes: more student input in
University decisions and more fairness
around campus.
Row housing policies will probably get
another critical review and both donations
and tuition will be scrutinized. But most im
portantly. the new Board will hopefully pro
vide an insightful nudge that might just cause
change in the right direction.
If not, we can always learn from our least
successful editorial ("Beat Cal!" Nov. 18,
2(M)5). In case you don't remember, it was two
words long and involved football. Oh well,
there's always next year.
