## A 						historical take on the Hamas election 
### OLIVIA SOHNS 
Philip Narodick apparently lacks histor
ical understanding of the Israeli-Pales
tinian conflict. In his article "Hamas
Victory Threatens Middle East" (Feb. 3), he
misleads Daily readership by saying that Is
rael is the peaceful side, the Palestinians are
inclined towards violence and Hamas is the
singular "terrorist" party to the conflict. Ad
ditionally, Narodick's question about
whether or not it is ethical for the United
States to support Hamas as an elected gov
ernment brings into question his commit
ment to democracy in the Middle East.
First of all, Narodick uses the word "ter
rorist" in a selective way that seeks to dis
credit and demonize the Palestinians for a
political purpose. Despite Israel's numerous
human rights violations and abrogation of
international law, it continues to be viewed
an ally of the United States for its strategic
value as a proxy of American force in con
trolling the region. This is belied by the fact
that Israel is the U.S.'s largest foreign aid re
cipient, with $2.56 billion in military aid
alone in 2005.
Therefore, because Hamas threatens Is
rael's monopoly on the use of force and con
trol over dictating the terms of peace, the
United States and Israel have an interest in
discrediting Hamas by selectively choosing
to label it "terrorist." If the definition of ter
rorism is violence directed against civilians
to pursue a political or military objective,
Hamas is undoubtedly a terrorist group be
cause it targets civilians through suicide
bombings. However, by this definition. Is
raeli governments could also have been
characterized as "terrorist."
In fact, it could be argued that Israel was
founded with the help of terrorist tactics.
Former Israeli Prime Minister Menachem
Begin was a member of the Irgun.a militant
Zionist group that bombed the King David
Hotel in 1946, killing 91 people — most of
them civilians — in an effort to make the
British leave Palestine and cede control to
the Jews. Isn't this comparable to suicide
bombing because it targeted civilians? And
if so. doesn't this imply that Begin was a ter
rorist.and that the Israeli government under
his leadership would be qualitatively similar
to a government led by Hamas?

In more recent times, where was the in
ternational outrage when the Israeli people
elected Ariel Sharon as Prime Minister even
though he was complicit in the massacres of
the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and
Shatilla in Lebanon in 1982? In these mas
sacres, between 7(K) and 3,5(X) Palestinians
were killed. The world should hold the Is
raeli people to the same standards as the
Palestinians in electing leaders that have a
commitment to peace, human rights, and
disdain for the murder of civilians.
Moreover, when Narodick asks whether
the Palestinians are committed to peace
when they install a terrorist group in their
government, he ought to ask the same ques
tion of the Israeli people when they elect
prime ministers that the Palestinians consid
er terrorists.The eruption of Palestinian vio
lence in the second Intifada would make
more sense if Narodick comprehended
Sharon's dark past and therefore could un
derstand the Palestinians' horror at his elec
tion as Prime Minister and their outrage at
his visit to the holiest Muslim site in
Jerusalem in 2001.
The United States would do well to honor
our supposed commitment to democracy in
the Middle East and our ideological opposi
tion to terror and human rights violations by
respecting the democratic elections of the
Palestinian people and taking a more critical
stance toward Israel. We should view
Hamas' incorporation into the political sys
tem as a beneficial development because it
will be normalized as a political party. Hamas
will likely moderate its views so it can engage
with other groups through compromise and
to appeal to a broader political base.
We must seek to understand the Pales
tinians' perspective, rather than discredit
their position by using labels in a selective
and rhetorical manner. We must recognize
that the Hamas victory does not indicate
that the Palestinian's want more violence
(as they are hurt by it just as much as Israeli
citizens are), but that they see in Hamas a
possible change in the status quo, better bar
gaining power with Israel and perhaps less
corrupt, more representative government.
