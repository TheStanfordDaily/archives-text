# Hello from a foreign country
## 
### 
Hi! 1 bet you forgot I even existed! I'm
that annoying friend of yours who
has gone abroad for a quarter. Now
I'm going to tell you and 50 other randomly
selected people about it in great detail.
I'm currently residing in a foreign country
for the quarter. Man. what a trip. I've been
going to bars like every night and everybody
is so nice here. I've met some guys from
Florida and they are like totally rad. I'm put
ting pictures of them up on my blog.
See, that's us posing hilariously in front of
that world-renowned monument. Isn't it
funny that we're doing that ridiculously inap
propriate gesture?! I've bet you've never
seen it before.
And man. there are so many hot women
here. I feel like I've really gotten to know the
locales, so many different peoples and stuff.
I've grown, dude. Like just last night I went
into a bar and I met this totally hot girl from
Cal State Chico and I'm so glad I got to go
abroad and meet such unique and interesting
people. They don't even have In-N-Out near
her! I mean, I've met people from Chico.
Kansas, Syracuse, even from South Beach!
We all speak the language together so we're
all getting really good. Now that I know how
to order a beer, I don't have to just point.
My language abilities are really improv
ing. Like right now I'm going to include a
local saying in my e-mail to you that is both
timeless and in a foreign language. It will be

poorly translated and make no sense but it
sounds cool and my friend decided to get it
tattooed on her back: "Les yeux dans mes
pantalons." Doesn't that sound authentic?
You'd never know that I have no idea what
I'm talking about.
I don't want to weigh you down with dis
cussion of classes, dude. I'll write about my
academics in these e-mails just as soon as the
movie "Hostel" boosts tourism sales. I will go
on about cafes, statues, women and pretty
much everything else you could pick up from
a tourist manual. I will never actually discuss
academics, classes or the "study" part of
"studying abroad." But I'll say plenty about
"broads," am I right dude?!
I make it seem like classes are taught in
small cigarette filled cafes. At nights, classes
are moved to clubs where I learn more about
the exchange rate from American dollars to
foreign beer to casual sex with sorority girls
from Cal State Chico. There are many girls
from Cal State Chico here. I have never actu

ally met a girl remotely near my age that is
from the native country and finds me attrac
tive. They are too busy talking in their for
eign language, discussing the art and archi
tecture of the local areas, and quite possibly
making fun of the stupid American college
students who are buying "rats piss" beer.
This is the part of the e-mail where I'm
supposed to tell you how much I miss you all
and declare some large boisterous plans for
when I return to campus, most likely involv
ing eating massive quantities of uniquely
American food like pizza and red peppers
found in pouch form. You probably actually
are wishing that I do not return because my
e-mail is way too long and you actually forgot
that I went abroad. That is to say. though 1
may miss you. you didn't know I left campus
and instead thought 1 jumped off the face of
the earth and moved to Manzanita Park.
Anyway, although it seems by the length
of this e-mail 1 have way too much time on
my hands, I'm going to go to a local bar now
and create another international incident. I
miss my bros, but as the locales say,
"L'Amours des velo encornet."

Chris's roommate and Chris's own experiences
abroad were nor like this at all, hut he's received
enough e-mails like this to make it worth writing
this column. He apologizes to his high school
French teacher for intentionally butchering her
language. Send complaints to cholt@stanford.edu.
