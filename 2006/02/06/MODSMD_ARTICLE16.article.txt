# Stanford, it's all about the people
## 
### 
One comment I heard over and over
during Admit Weekend and New
Student Orientation from upper
classmen, faculty and staff was that "the best
thing about Stanford is the people." How
corny. I thought, and how typically American
— just like Barney's theme song: "1 love you.
you love me, we're a happy family." 1 was sure
I would meet some nice and interesting peo
ple, but there were so many other things I
was also looking forward to: fascinating
classes, brilliant professors, the athletic facil
ities, extracurricular, etc.
Halfway into my junior year, I can safely
say that few comments have proven to be
more true. Never before coming to Stanford
had I encountered such an impressive collec
tion of people. Just last night, I met an envi
ronmental engineering student who.during a
gap year, taught history and geography in
one of the Caroline Islands, I.(KK) miles east
of the Philippines. Some of his students
would come to school by boat, and he used
old American textbooks as his course mate
rial. The Caroline Islands were U.N. Trust
Territory placed under U.S. control until
1991, so the United States had donated old
textbooks to schools in this region. His
biggest challenge, he said, was making the
material relevant and interesting for his stu
dents — especially when the topic of the day
was the Magna Carta.
Stories of incredible obstacles overcome
leave me in awe. For example, my friend's fa
ther is paralyzed from the waist down be

cause of pesticides in the fields he worked in;
her mother is also unable to work full-time
and she has two siblings. She went to a public
school from which no one had ever gone to
any "top" school and still managed to acquire
the skills and knowledge necessary to get
into Stanford.
Or another friend of mine from a small
village in Vietnam who got recruited by the
Singaporean government because of his high
math potential and excelled in his Singapore
an high school — though he was far from his
family and knew no English at first.
Stanford students, I learned, arc not afraid
of pursuing their interests, however "eccen
tric" people might ordinarily think they are.
Among my acquaintances research topics in
clude Japanese musicals, the portrayal of
teenage female depression in novels and the
link between eye-gazing patterns and con
sumer choices. The University encourages
students to generously pursue their interests
by equally respecting all fields (at least in
theory) and doling out research grants, but,
ultimately, students? passions are what drive

the system forward.
Students' research takes them all over the
world, from South Africa to observe the most
recent elections, to India to study call centers.
If Stanford students were to write about their
travelling experiences, I'm sure the result
would be a far more complete and interest
ing travel guide than anything on the market.
I now love being surrounded by people
whose experiences are so unique and differ
ent from mine,but I found it quite bewildering
at first. I longed for people to whom I would
n't have to explain my background, and who
wouldn't say: "Oh really, you're from Paris,
that's so cool!" I wanted to make jokes using
cultural references. 1 loved the diversity, but 1
also wanted people "like me."
If there's one thing I've gained from my
two and a half years at Stanford, it's becom
ing 1(X) percent comfortable with a very di
verse group of people. At the beginning of
freshman year, it was hard for me to over
come cultural barriers enough to be close
friends with people who were very different
from myself, would get along well with al
most everyone, but found it hard to bond
with most, because we lacked common
ground. Those days are over. As for cultural
references, I realized that you build them by
living with people and sharing both good and
bad times. When I leave Stanford, I know it's
the people I'll miss the most.
