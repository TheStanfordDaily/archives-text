## Munger dorms destroy Salvatierra Walk 
### JOHN FELSTINER 
One fine morning seven years ago, I woke
up to look out my bedroom window at
a Kafkaesque sight: surveyors working
the Mayfield Playfield, a one-and-one-quarter
acre green patch close to Stanford's center
campus.
It turned out the administration meant to de
velop inevitably expensive housing to lure
high-salaried faculty A number of us joined in
formally to save this precious space, used year
long in 50 different ways by students, campus
residents, community members and hordes of
summer session kids. Planners called the Play
field an "infill site," making it less offensive to
develop. Finally they consented to open discus
sions, lengthy presentations of the architecture
destined for this green lung. Eventually, appro
priate places were found elsewhere to ease the
housing shortage, and today the playfield con
tinues to serve thousands of grateful folks.
As someone who's taught at Stanford for
over 40 years, and as a longtime campus resi
dent, I've been involved for two years now in a
movement to question a similar project. The
multi-billionaire Charles Munger, of Berkshire
Hathaway investment company, promised to
donate $43.5 million if Stanford would build a
600-bed graduate housing cluster and an im

mense underground garage adjacent to the
Law School.
The Munger project's sudden proclamation
surprised many people by the force of this fait
accompli, its foregone conclusion. Again it
took dogged questioning before public meet
ings were fielded, and again a bland juggernaut
pushed ahead. In fact, biking one day along Sal
vatierra Walk, the project site. I noticed that its
street sign had been changed to read "Sal
vatierra Mall."
The point is, those in the University commu
nity who question this project are not at all
against the building of new dorms. It's just the
donor-driven dictation of where they must be,
destroying irreversibly one of the few quiet and
humane areas left on the inner campus. Stanford
has other land to build on. What we're seeing, at
bottom, is a disregard, a recklessness of place.
Arguments prepared by a San Francisco en
vironmental law firm indicate that Stanford's
measures to relocate five venerable houses are
insufficient in reducing significant environ
mental impact. And the State Office of Historic
Preservation actually suggested that an Envi
ronmental Impact Report would be in order
before such a move. With so much at stake, this
would clearly have been a desirable precaution
to take. Yet the Santa Clara County Planning
Commission recently acceded to the universi

ty's grandiose and inappropriate plans.
A year ago, for the overall project, the ad
ministration's so-called "mitigation" resulted
in revising a three-building cluster — four
story, five-story and five-and-a-half story —
into not three but five buildings, of four and
five stories. What's more, the footprint grew
rather than diminishing, and required displac
ing not three but five houses. These, of course,
would have been loomed over by grossly dis
proportionate structures. So instead of remov
ing the project to a suitable site, it was conven
ient to displace all five houses — not to men
tion the Campus Bike Shop, whose faithful
owner was totally left out of the process that
concerned his livelihood. And not to mention
the magnificent trees on this site, some of
which are being moved, some removed, i.e. de
stroyed. Already Salvatierra Walk, a truly de
cent space, is gone for good.
Stanford's planning people insist that the
five houses being plopped in Tresidder's park
ing lot and elsewhere did not form a "historic
district," which would warrant an ElR.and that
over time, this area has "disintegrated." So
their logic, instead of preserving the pleasant
way into campus that somehow survived, pro
motes disintegrating it totally.
For those who walk or hike to work at Stan
ford, Salvatierra Walk was one of our main trib

utaries. For 20 years, along with countless others,
1 passed daily through the targeted area. I
proudly took out-of-town guests that way to
show them an especially amenable side of Stan
ford. It's acutely painful to see this terrain disfig
ured, lost to an aggrandizement foisted upon us.
I've heard faculty,staff and students in the
Law School privately lamenting this project
too, but wary of speaking out. Just the other
day, 1 was consulting a fairly high staff member
about how 1 might encourage my son. who's
coming back from the work force, to apply to
Stanford Law as well as elsewhere. This person
cautiously admitted dismay at the proposed
project.
1 admire the great things my University has
done or maintained: the cactus garden in the
arboretum, the Oval and Palm Drive restora
tion, the Papua New Guinea sculpture garden,
the Andy Goldsworthy "Stone River" outside
the museum, plus our increasing academic ex
cellence over the decades. I know some of my
remarks are expertly dismissed by administra
tion employees. If my words seem a bit harsh or
skeptical, they nonetheless come from one
among many longtime Stanford citizens who
love the campus and value the University.

tinues to serve thousands of grateful folks.
As someone who's taught at Stanford for
over 40 years, and as a longtime campus resi
dent, I've been involved for two years now in a
movement to question a similar project. The
multi-billionaire Charles Munger, of Berkshire
Hathaway investment company, promised to
donate $43.5 million if Stanford would build a
600-bed graduate housing cluster and an im

mense underground garage adjacent to the
Law School.
The Munger project's sudden proclamation
surprised many people by the force of this fait
accompli, its foregone conclusion. Again it
took dogged questioning before public meet
ings were fielded, and again a bland juggernaut
pushed ahead. In fact, biking one day along Sal
vatierra Walk, the project site. I noticed that its
street sign had been changed to read "Sal
vatierra Mall."
The point is, those in the University commu
nity who question this project are not at all
against the building of new dorms. It's just the
donor-driven dictation of where they must be,
destroying irreversibly one of the few quiet and
humane areas left on the inner campus. Stanford
has other land to build on. What we're seeing, at
bottom, is a disregard, a recklessness of place.
Arguments prepared by a San Francisco en
vironmental law firm indicate that Stanford's
measures to relocate five venerable houses are
insufficient in reducing significant environ
mental impact. And the State Office of Historic
Preservation actually suggested that an Envi
ronmental Impact Report would be in order
before such a move. With so much at stake, this
would clearly have been a desirable precaution
to take. Yet the Santa Clara County Planning
Commission recently acceded to the universi

ty's grandiose and inappropriate plans.
A year ago, for the overall project, the ad
ministration's so-called "mitigation" resulted
in revising a three-building cluster — four
story, five-story and five-and-a-half story —
into not three but five buildings, of four and
five stories. What's more, the footprint grew
rather than diminishing, and required displac
ing not three but five houses. These, of course,
would have been loomed over by grossly dis
proportionate structures. So instead of remov
ing the project to a suitable site, it was conven
ient to displace all five houses — not to men
tion the Campus Bike Shop, whose faithful
owner was totally left out of the process that
concerned his livelihood. And not to mention
the magnificent trees on this site, some of
which are being moved, some removed, i.e. de
stroyed. Already Salvatierra Walk, a truly de
cent space, is gone for good.
Stanford's planning people insist that the
five houses being plopped in Tresidder's park
ing lot and elsewhere did not form a "historic
district," which would warrant an ElR.and that
over time, this area has "disintegrated." So
their logic, instead of preserving the pleasant
way into campus that somehow survived, pro
motes disintegrating it totally.
For those who walk or hike to work at Stan
ford, Salvatierra Walk was one of our main trib

utaries. For 20 years, along with countless others,
1 passed daily through the targeted area. I
proudly took out-of-town guests that way to
show them an especially amenable side of Stan
ford. It's acutely painful to see this terrain disfig
ured, lost to an aggrandizement foisted upon us.
I've heard faculty,staff and students in the
Law School privately lamenting this project
too, but wary of speaking out. Just the other
day, 1 was consulting a fairly high staff member
about how 1 might encourage my son. who's
coming back from the work force, to apply to
Stanford Law as well as elsewhere. This person
cautiously admitted dismay at the proposed
project.
1 admire the great things my University has
done or maintained: the cactus garden in the
arboretum, the Oval and Palm Drive restora
tion, the Papua New Guinea sculpture garden,
the Andy Goldsworthy "Stone River" outside
the museum, plus our increasing academic ex
cellence over the decades. I know some of my
remarks are expertly dismissed by administra
tion employees. If my words seem a bit harsh or
skeptical, they nonetheless come from one
among many longtime Stanford citizens who
love the campus and value the University.
