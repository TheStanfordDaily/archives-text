# Hear Hamas out before passing judgment
## 
### AHMED ASHRAF 
The world had already made up its mind,
even before Hamas took proper control
of the Palestinian Authority from the in
cumbent Fateh movement. The media and
world leaders proclaimed Hamas a terrorist or
ganization and insist that now there's no way
peace can be achieved. Let's cut the funding,
break diplomatic ties and hope to God they
don't cause too much havoc.
Somehow, the much larger and brighter pic
ture got lost in the hysteria. Firstly, the Pales
tinians have taken part in a free and fair dem
ocratic election and chosen their representa
tives without a violent incident. In the general
ly undemocratic Middle East, and given ex
traordinary circumstances — the Israeli occu
pation and lack of statehood — that's a bril
liant victory.
Secondly, Hamas has taken part in the po

litical process rather than operate outside of
it, unlike the many factions that have chosen
the less peaceful route in the blood bath of
Iraq.
Thirdly, and most importantly, Palestinians
have chosen to elect a movement that shatters
the unbroken, corruption-ridden reign of their
previous governing party. Much like the United
States, Palestine voted on domestic concerns
— clean government, better provision of social
services and internal security — as opposed to
international issues concerning Israel. This is
democracy at work and — given all the idealis
tic yelling we do at the wider Muslim world —
we have to respect it.
Up till now, it has been the Palestinians who
have had to respond to the whims of the Israeli
electorate and their equally dubious selection
of leadership — Prime Minister Ariel Sharon,
despite the frantic public relations labeling, is a
convicted war criminal who first created the il

legal settlements that lie at the heart of the con
flict today.
Blinded by the specter of the rather fashion
able "Islamic terrorist" labeling, people have
failed to take notice of the positive statements
coming from Hamas, which has taken many
steps to compromise and to stake out a realistic
position — such as combining militant groups
into a national army and ensuring that interna
tional funds are used expressly for civilian pur
poses, not terrorism. Suicide bombings are like
ly to end. as Hamas begins to acknowledge that
its role lies in effective government, not sense
less violence. Hamas will learn very quickly
that it's easy to criticize and take extremist po
sitions when you're not accountable for them.
But now that it has achieved office, political
power will be a moderating force — as many
predicted for hawkish Sharon.
Most people also fail to realize that Hamas
is better recognized as a relatively efficient.

corruption-free social service provider in
Palestine rather than a militant organization.
During the crushing Intifada, it managed to
provide basic social services that the govern
ment itself could not deliver and — although
Palestinians may have voted an Islamist party
into office — they themselves are largely sec
ular and will resist efforts by Hamas to insti
tute religious custom. As Northern Ireland's
Sinn Fein-Irish Republican Army has shown,
the inclusion of dual groups can bring mean
ingful developments to the peace process.
After all. the previous Palestinian govern
ment was crippled by its inability to confront
groups like Hamas. If Israel plays its cards
right and makes compromises like the Pales
tinians are willing to make, there may yet be
hope for a two-state solution.
