## VanDerveer earns 650th career victory in 84-57 win over Beavers VanDaveer ninth conch to reach 650—just two victories array from 500 W's at Stanford 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer joined some elite
company Saturday as she became the ninth coach in Divi
sion 1 women's basketball history to win 650 games. The
milestone victory came easily as the No. 15 Cardinal rolled
over Oregon State, 84-57.
"That's a lot of wins," senior guard Krista Rappahahn (10
points, two rebounds) said. "She deserves it more than any
one. She's such a knowledgeable coach."
"I watched her on TV when I wasyoungand I'm just glad

I got to be a part of [her
legacy]," sophomore guard
Candice Wiggins added.
With the loss, the
Beavers fall to 0-20 all
time at Maples Pavilion.
Oregon State (10-10,4-
8 Pac-10) kept the game
within 10 until Rappahahn
delivered the knockout
punch. Her put-back with
time expiring in the first
half pushed the lead to 12,
and the Beavers would
never recover.
"[Rappahahn's shot]
was very deflating." Ore
gon State head coach
LaVonda Wagner said.
"The whole first half was

deflating. We came out with good intensity, but after that we
kind of let them take us out of what we wanted to do."
'ITie Cardinal (16-5, 11-2) were paced by a consistent
perimeter attack — seven of their first 12 shots were three
pointers. Stanford shot 44.4 percent from behind the arc in
the game.
Wiggins led all scorers with 24 points in only 26 minutes,
shooting 7-12 from the field. She was perfect from the free
throw line (6-6) for the second game in a row.
Down low, junior Kristin Newlin (10 points) was a per
fect 4-4 from the field but even more impressive was her de
fensive effort punctuated by two emphatic blocks. Junior
center Brooke Smith added 11 points and six rebounds of
her own.
Stanford capitalized on a tired and sloppy OSU team by
forcing 20 turnovers, while committing only nine.
"It was a story of turnovers," senior forward Kim Butler
said.
Stanford also benefited from a much deeper bench than
Oregon State.The Cardinal played their entire team, and all
but one of their players scored. Meanwhile, four Beavers
played more than 34 minutes.
"Our depth was the difference," VanDerveer said. "It
helps us a lot, because it helps us bring good energy into the
gym every day."
With the win, VanDerveer takes another step towards
her 500 th win at the helm of the Stanford program. The 52-
year-old head coach now has 498 wins with the Cardinal,
and could reach S(H) next week with a sweep of UCSB and
Cal.
