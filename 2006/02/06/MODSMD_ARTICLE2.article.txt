## Stanford Mock Trial takes second place Two Stanford teams to compete at regional?, may face each other 
### ENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
The biggest competition yet, the Third Annu
al Bay Area Mock Trial Invitational took place
on campus this weekend as Stanford Law
School's four-person team fell short of its UCLA
opponents. Third place was secured by Golden

Gate Law School; UC-Berkeley's Boalt Hall and
Hastings Law Schools also competed. The top
three teams won engraved gavels and the UCLA
team took home 10,000 Westlaw Rewards
points, to be redeemed for merchandise.
Each judge singled out individuals for Best
Attorney Awards, who received 1.000 Westlaw
Rewards points each. Four Stanford students
recognized as Best Attorneys — Rae Woods,
Nancy Glass, Jeremy Presser and Lindsey Powell
— were ranked first by every judge in their
rounds.
The two-day invitational involved rounds of
competitions during which future litigators de
livered opening and closing statements, argued
objections and motions and examined witnesses
using the fact pattern of the upcoming Associa
tion of Trial Lawyers of America (ATLA) Na
tional Student Advocacy Competition. Stanford
will soon be sending two teams to the ATLA Re
gional Championship in Santa Monica.
Throughout the country, 224 teams competed
at 14 ATLA regionals, vying to win a slot at na
tionals. This year's case involves a field mechan
ic who was injured when the hoist he was operat
ing broke, causing a 1.5-ton load to fall to the
ground. In 2005, a team from Stanford Law
School won the regional championship title: they
went on to compete at the ATLA Student Advo
cacy National Championship in West Palm
Beach, Fla., where it was recognized as one of the
top 15 Mock Trial teams in the nation.
"We are sending some very talented students
to defend Stanford's title this year," said Presi
dent of the Stanford Mock Trial Program and
second-year law student Rae Woods, captain of
one of the two Stanford teams attending the
ATLA tournament. "I'm especially excited to
see such superstar first-year students in the mix.
Stanford is unique from other law schools be-

Invitational this weekend.
cause it allows first-year students to
compete interscholastically — and
the program is better for it."
The team captain of the other
qualifying Stanford team, Dave
Iliompson. a second-year student,
said he hopes to defend the team's
title earned at last year's tourna
ment.
"We've been putting so much
work into this, so many late nights in
classrooms, that it's an amazing pay
off to get to represent Stanford at
the next level of competition,"
Thompson said. "The team didn't
believe me when I told them that
they would be spending every night
working on this case, but the hard
work has all paid off."
Thompson also said the two
Stanford teams hope to face off
against each other at regionals.
"It would be the Mock Trial
equivalent of the Williams sisters
meeting in the Wimbledon finals,"
he said.
Woods said he believes that the
Bay Area Mock Trial Invitational
provided an excellent opportunity
for the competitors to exercise their
trial advocacy skills.
"The Invitational gave us all a
chance to apply the legal knowledge
we're learning in the classroom in a
fun, interactive, entertaining set
ting," Woods said."But, most impor
tantly, it gave us a chance to come
together as a team — to examine
the case problem, to explore differ
ent theories, and to support each
other as we presented our case. That
teamwork and the relationships I've
built during my Mock Trial years are
what really makes the whole experi
ence worthwhile."
Woods was also very apprecia
tive of Stanford Law Dean Larry
Kramer's support of the Mock Trial
Program as well as the devotion of
over 40 local attorneys, judges and
mock trail coaches who acted as
guest judges at the invitational.
Many felt that the student-run
event was a tremendous success.
"The tournament has gotten big
ger each year, and this year's tourna
ment ran very smoothly, through the
hard work of the program's execu
tive board members and the cooper
ation of the law school administra
tion." noted Mock Trial Director of
External Relations and second-year
law student Lindsey Powell.
Team Captain and second-year
law student Scott Reents described
the competition as "very intense."

"Mock trial requires that you
have total mastery of a set of very
complicated and ambiguous facts,
develop a compelling legal strategy
and execute that strategy while
ducking objections and cross-exam
inations from a hostile, competent
opposing team," Reents said. "It's
sort of like trying to put together a
model airplane while riding a bike
through an obstacle course pursued
by people who are trying to knock
you off, all the while a crowd of peo
ple is judging your performance. In
other words, it's a lot of fun!"
First-year Chrystal Tindell said
she was very impressed by her fel
low competitors.
"I think the thing that astounded
me most was the level of sportsman
ship shown by all the teams — I can
only hope that legal professionals
work in the same way,"Tindell said.
"Also, to put it succinctly, it was an
exhausting and exhilarating experi
ence — a mock trial is a three-hour
adrenaline rush."
Several of the participants noted
that they joined the Mock Trail Pro
gram in order to better prepare for
the unpredictability of the court
room.
"The judges at the Invitational
were practicing attorneys, many of
whom go to trial regularly, so their
feedback was really valuable," said
second-year Stanford participant
Jason Fan. "I joined Mock Trial to
get on my feet in a trial setting.This
experience will help me decide
whether I want to focus on litigation
in the future."
Second-year law student Olga
Kuskova, Mock Trail vice president
of competition and training, said
that the Invitational was "fantastic
preparation for real world trial
work."
"The artificialities of this being
an academic exercise are kept to a
minimum, the opportunity to be
scored and judged by practitioners
is incredibly useful and ultimately,
it's just so much fun," Kuskova said.
"The opportunity to spend time in
the well of a real courtroom, objec
tion fights, creative argumentation,
even playing witnesses is wonderful,
and I enjoy every moment of it."
Founded in 2003, the Stanford
Mock Trial Program participates in
the annual American Bar Associa
tion National Mock Trial Tourna
ment as well as the Texas Young
Lawyers Association Invitational
National Trial Competition Region
al Tournament, which may result in
one of two Stanford teams advanc

"The tournament has gotten big
ger each year, and this year's tourna
ment ran very smoothly, through the
hard work of the program's execu
tive board members and the cooper
ation of the law school administra
tion." noted Mock Trial Director of
External Relations and second-year
law student Lindsey Powell.
Team Captain and second-year
law student Scott Reents described
the competition as "very intense."

"Mock trial requires that you
have total mastery of a set of very
complicated and ambiguous facts,
develop a compelling legal strategy
and execute that strategy while
ducking objections and cross-exam
inations from a hostile, competent
opposing team," Reents said. "It's
sort of like trying to put together a
model airplane while riding a bike
through an obstacle course pursued
by people who are trying to knock
you off, all the while a crowd of peo
ple is judging your performance. In
other words, it's a lot of fun!"
First-year Chrystal Tindell said
she was very impressed by her fel
low competitors.
"I think the thing that astounded
me most was the level of sportsman
ship shown by all the teams — I can
only hope that legal professionals
work in the same way,"Tindell said.
"Also, to put it succinctly, it was an
exhausting and exhilarating experi
ence — a mock trial is a three-hour
adrenaline rush."
Several of the participants noted
that they joined the Mock Trail Pro
gram in order to better prepare for
the unpredictability of the court
room.
"The judges at the Invitational
were practicing attorneys, many of
whom go to trial regularly, so their
feedback was really valuable," said
second-year Stanford participant
Jason Fan. "I joined Mock Trial to
get on my feet in a trial setting.This
experience will help me decide
whether I want to focus on litigation
in the future."
Second-year law student Olga
Kuskova, Mock Trail vice president
of competition and training, said
that the Invitational was "fantastic
preparation for real world trial
work."
"The artificialities of this being
an academic exercise are kept to a
minimum, the opportunity to be
scored and judged by practitioners
is incredibly useful and ultimately,
it's just so much fun," Kuskova said.
"The opportunity to spend time in
the well of a real courtroom, objec
tion fights, creative argumentation,
even playing witnesses is wonderful,
and I enjoy every moment of it."

The biggest competition yet, the Third Annu
al Bay Area Mock Trial Invitational took place
on campus this weekend as Stanford Law
School's four-person team fell short of its UCLA
opponents. Third place was secured by Golden

Gate Law School; UC-Berkeley's Boalt Hall and
Hastings Law Schools also competed. The top
three teams won engraved gavels and the UCLA
team took home 10,000 Westlaw Rewards
points, to be redeemed for merchandise.
Each judge singled out individuals for Best
Attorney Awards, who received 1.000 Westlaw
Rewards points each. Four Stanford students
recognized as Best Attorneys — Rae Woods,
Nancy Glass, Jeremy Presser and Lindsey Powell
— were ranked first by every judge in their
rounds.
The two-day invitational involved rounds of
competitions during which future litigators de
livered opening and closing statements, argued
objections and motions and examined witnesses
using the fact pattern of the upcoming Associa
tion of Trial Lawyers of America (ATLA) Na
tional Student Advocacy Competition. Stanford
will soon be sending two teams to the ATLA Re
gional Championship in Santa Monica.
Throughout the country, 224 teams competed
at 14 ATLA regionals, vying to win a slot at na
tionals. This year's case involves a field mechan
ic who was injured when the hoist he was operat
ing broke, causing a 1.5-ton load to fall to the
ground. In 2005, a team from Stanford Law
School won the regional championship title: they
went on to compete at the ATLA Student Advo
cacy National Championship in West Palm
Beach, Fla., where it was recognized as one of the
top 15 Mock Trial teams in the nation.
"We are sending some very talented students
to defend Stanford's title this year," said Presi
dent of the Stanford Mock Trial Program and
second-year law student Rae Woods, captain of
one of the two Stanford teams attending the
ATLA tournament. "I'm especially excited to
see such superstar first-year students in the mix.
Stanford is unique from other law schools be-

cause it allows first-year students to
compete interscholastically — and
the program is better for it."
The team captain of the other
qualifying Stanford team, Dave
Iliompson. a second-year student,
said he hopes to defend the team's
title earned at last year's tourna
ment.
"We've been putting so much
work into this, so many late nights in
classrooms, that it's an amazing pay
off to get to represent Stanford at
the next level of competition,"
Thompson said. "The team didn't
believe me when I told them that
they would be spending every night
working on this case, but the hard
work has all paid off."
Thompson also said the two
Stanford teams hope to face off
against each other at regionals.
"It would be the Mock Trial
equivalent of the Williams sisters
meeting in the Wimbledon finals,"
he said.
Woods said he believes that the
Bay Area Mock Trial Invitational
provided an excellent opportunity
for the competitors to exercise their
trial advocacy skills.
"The Invitational gave us all a
chance to apply the legal knowledge
we're learning in the classroom in a
fun, interactive, entertaining set
ting," Woods said."But, most impor
tantly, it gave us a chance to come
together as a team — to examine
the case problem, to explore differ
ent theories, and to support each
other as we presented our case. That
teamwork and the relationships I've
built during my Mock Trial years are
what really makes the whole experi
ence worthwhile."
Woods was also very apprecia
tive of Stanford Law Dean Larry
Kramer's support of the Mock Trial
Program as well as the devotion of
over 40 local attorneys, judges and
mock trail coaches who acted as
guest judges at the invitational.
