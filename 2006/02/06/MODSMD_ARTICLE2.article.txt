## Stanford Mock Trial takes second place Two Stanford teams to compete at regional?, may face each other 
### ENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
The biggest competition yet, the Third Annu
al Bay Area Mock Trial Invitational took place
on campus this weekend as Stanford Law
School's four-person team fell short of its UCLA
opponents. Third place was secured by Golden

Gate Law School; UC-Berkeley's Boalt Hall and
Hastings Law Schools also competed. The top
three teams won engraved gavels and the UCLA
team took home 10,000 Westlaw Rewards
points, to be redeemed for merchandise.
Each judge singled out individuals for Best
Attorney Awards, who received 1.000 Westlaw
Rewards points each. Four Stanford students
recognized as Best Attorneys — Rae Woods,
Nancy Glass, Jeremy Presser and Lindsey Powell
— were ranked first by every judge in their
rounds.
The two-day invitational involved rounds of
competitions during which future litigators de
livered opening and closing statements, argued
objections and motions and examined witnesses
using the fact pattern of the upcoming Associa
tion of Trial Lawyers of America (ATLA) Na
tional Student Advocacy Competition. Stanford
will soon be sending two teams to the ATLA Re
gional Championship in Santa Monica.
Throughout the country, 224 teams competed
at 14 ATLA regionals, vying to win a slot at na
tionals. This year's case involves a field mechan
ic who was injured when the hoist he was operat
ing broke, causing a 1.5-ton load to fall to the
ground. In 2005, a team from Stanford Law
School won the regional championship title: they
went on to compete at the ATLA Student Advo
cacy National Championship in West Palm
Beach, Fla., where it was recognized as one of the
top 15 Mock Trial teams in the nation.
"We are sending some very talented students
to defend Stanford's title this year," said Presi
dent of the Stanford Mock Trial Program and
second-year law student Rae Woods, captain of
one of the two Stanford teams attending the
ATLA tournament. "I'm especially excited to
see such superstar first-year students in the mix.
Stanford is unique from other law schools be-
