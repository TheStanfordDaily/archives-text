# Olympics? No way!
## 
### 
If the Super Bowl is your Christmas, then I
guess it's Chanukah time for us Jews.
That's right, the Olympics start this Fri
day and I could not care less.
Welcome to an event that we're told mat
ters in the world. I guess that the Super Bowl is
neat, hut if you cannot get enough stupid little
stories like Jerome Bettis playing his last game
at home, then I think you should start tuning
into NBC's coverage of the Olympics this year.
1 can't wait to hear about how Emily Hughes
feels about Michelle Kwan taking her place or
how Apollo Anton Ohno is the coolest guy
ever. 1 wonder what he eats for breakfast.

And instead
of not caring
whether the
Pittsburgh Steel
ers or the Seattle
Seahawks, two of
the most under
the-radar teams
from two of the
most under-the
radar cities, wins,
I know that who
ever is sporting
my red, white
and blue better
march on to vic
tory over other
unpatriotic coun
tries. Or else.
Okay, the
Olympics might
not be the best
sport competi
tion ever, but it

I'll have to
make a special
"Olympic Clause: ''
no watch ing
without 7 V
remote in hand
ready to flip
or mute,
depending on how
dire
the situation

definitely beats out the World Cup. And
don't get me wrong, 1 gave the World Cup
more than its fair shot.
I was that guy who woke up at 1 a.m. (1
lived on the East Coast) and watched every
single game until school started. And I'm not
talking about just the USA — or even Brazil
— games.
I loved to watch games where people ac
tually cared about the sport they were play
ing. For some of those countries, if the players
didn't win, they didn't eat. And let us not for
get the guy from Columbia who got shot for
his poor performance against the U.S. a few
World Cups back.
But, far too often — especially when I was
watching Brazil, Italy, France and the rest of
Western Europe — 1 would have rather
watched my sister playing in the backyard. At
least she isn't worried about falling down,
getting an ouchie and losing that multimil
lion-dollar contract.
But, back to the point at hand, we're told
that the Olympics matter. It's a giant two-week
human interest story. People supposedly care.
Another reason we "should," but ultimate
ly don't care: for a lot of the athletes, it's their
first time out of the country. How many times
do you think those Canadian curlers have
been to the Italian Alps? More important
question: How many times do you think those
Canadian curlers want to be to the Italian
Alps? They have their own damn mountain
range. And they're Canadian. I could care less.
Well, at least the professional hockey
players are excited. Maybe it's because the
Americans are still running off the fuel of the
1980 "Miracle on Ice" phenomenon. Person
ally, I think the real reason is they will finally
have a viewing audience in excess of 12.
Of course, for the Canadians, hockey is all
they have to live for and winning the
Olympics for Team Canada is more presti
gious than being elected Prime Minister.
And I hate to admit it, but even the over
hyped Super Bowl beats the Olympics in one
key regard: commercials.
1, for one, cannot stand that one commer
cial with Lindsey Jacobellis, the snowboarder.
You know, the one whose coach tells her that
her Visa Check Card got stolen, so she wins
the race. Besides the content, I have seen this
commercial way too many times just from
watching the NFL playoffs. But at least I
won't have to watch it during the Super Bowl
— commercials there are usually new.
But for the Olympics, the same damn
commercials play for weeks on end. Simply
imagine it. Better yet, don't. Frankly, I think
the 92nd straight time we see a remade "Eye
of the Tiger"... "Roy, Roy, Roy, Roy"... it's ac
tually negative publicity for Starbucks.
1 think I'll have to make a special
"Olympic Clause:" no watching without TV
remote in hand, ready to flip or mute, de
pending on how dire the situation.
So here we go, the Olympics.Time in start
ing on Friday and be able to finally watch a
sport where when the woman in your life asks
you what is going on, you can tell her with a
clean conscience,"! don't know."Enjoy.

Jamie Marincola comes across a bitter sopho
more, perhaps because of the woman in his life.

But, back to the point at hand, we're told
that the Olympics matter. It's a giant two-week
human interest story. People supposedly care.
Another reason we "should," but ultimate
ly don't care: for a lot of the athletes, it's their
first time out of the country. How many times
do you think those Canadian curlers have
been to the Italian Alps? More important
question: How many times do you think those
Canadian curlers want to be to the Italian
Alps? They have their own damn mountain
range. And they're Canadian. I could care less.
Well, at least the professional hockey
players are excited. Maybe it's because the
Americans are still running off the fuel of the
1980 "Miracle on Ice" phenomenon. Person
ally, I think the real reason is they will finally
have a viewing audience in excess of 12.
Of course, for the Canadians, hockey is all
they have to live for and winning the
Olympics for Team Canada is more presti
gious than being elected Prime Minister.
And I hate to admit it, but even the over
hyped Super Bowl beats the Olympics in one
key regard: commercials.
1, for one, cannot stand that one commer
cial with Lindsey Jacobellis, the snowboarder.
You know, the one whose coach tells her that
her Visa Check Card got stolen, so she wins
the race. Besides the content, I have seen this
commercial way too many times just from
watching the NFL playoffs. But at least I
won't have to watch it during the Super Bowl
— commercials there are usually new.
But for the Olympics, the same damn
commercials play for weeks on end. Simply
imagine it. Better yet, don't. Frankly, I think
the 92nd straight time we see a remade "Eye
of the Tiger"... "Roy, Roy, Roy, Roy"... it's ac
tually negative publicity for Starbucks.
1 think I'll have to make a special
"Olympic Clause:" no watching without TV
remote in hand, ready to flip or mute, de
pending on how dire the situation.
So here we go, the Olympics.Time in start
ing on Friday and be able to finally watch a
sport where when the woman in your life asks
you what is going on, you can tell her with a
clean conscience,"! don't know."Enjoy.
