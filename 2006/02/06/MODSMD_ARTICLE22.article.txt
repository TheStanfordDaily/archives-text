# MEN UPSET BRUINS
## No. 12 Cardinal take down No. 18 USC and No. 4 UCLA at Taube 
### BEN BACKES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It was a familiar situation: after losing
the doubles point, the match was tied at
three and Stanford needed a win at the bot
tom of the singles lineup to secure victory.
The result, however, was a new one, as Stan
ford's singles players pulled out clutch wins
and the No. 12 Cardinal (3-0) defeated No.
18 Southern California (4-2) on Friday and
No. 4 UCLA (3-1) on Saturday at theTaube
Family Tennis Center.
On Saturday, Stanford's hope of knock
ing off defending national champion
UCLA rested on their No. 6 singles player,
sophomore Chris Rasmussen.
Rasmussen won the first set against the
Bruins' Jeremy Drean, but trailed 1-3 be
fore winning four of the next five games to
pull ahead 5-4. With his teammates and an
excited crowd cheering from the bleachers
behind him, Rasmussen quickly took a 0-40
lead in the final game. After an ace from
Drean to save one match point, the Bruin
double faulted to give Stanford the victory.
During the decisive match, Rasmussen
said he did not let the circumstances affect
his play.
"I was not really nervous," he said."l was
pretty excited because I was really confi
dent. I was sure 1 was going to win that
match."
Rasmussen's teammates sprinted down
from the bleachers to congratulate the
sophomore, who redshirted last season.
"It was my first experience with some
thing like that and it was pretty incredible,"
Rasmussen said.
The sophomore's match-saving battle
may not have even happened, as Ras
mussen did not play singles against USC.
Head coach John Whitlinger made the deci
sion to change the lineup against the Bruins.
"Sometimes as a coach you have a little
bit of a feel." Whitlinger said. "I just wanted
to give him a chance. I felt it might be
Chris's time. Sometimes you roll the dice
and it works. Yesterday it worked."
Friday's hero was freshman Blake
Muller. who clinched the victory over USC
with a 6-0,6-7,6-4 victory over Garrett Sny
der at the No. 4 singles spot.
"1 was nervous, but [it helped] having a
coach out on the court," Muller said. "As the
third set started I just remembered what
they told me and tried to stay as loose as
possible and that helped a lot."
Muller also posted a 6-0, 6-4 victory
against Philipp Gruendler against UCLA
on Saturday, making for a very successful
weekend for the freshman in his first dual
matches against ranked opponents. He
credited the coaching staff's preparation.
"Going into the matches our coaches
talked to us about the importance [of the
matches]," he said."l thought the coaching
staff did a great job of getting us ready, both
mentally and physically."
Whitlinger was impressed with Muller's
performance.
"I was really happy for him," Whitlinger
said. "[lt's not easy for] a freshman to be
thrown into a situation to clinch a match.
Nerves were taking over a bit and you never

know how guys are going to act, especially
as a freshman. 1 really was proud of the way
he finished the match."
Along with Muller. juniors James Pade
and James Wan were solid in the middle of
the singles lineup for Stanford, which had a
1 -6 record in matches decided by a 4-3 score
last season/Hie No. 2-4 singles players each
won their matches against USC and UCLA.
Pade, another player who redshirted last
year, added to his string of dominating per
formances while losing only 12 games dur

ing the weekend matches. He defeated
Kaes Van't Hot" of USC, 6-3, 6-4 and
Haythem Abid of UCLA, 6-2,6-3. He also
teamed with senior KC Corkery for Stan
ford's only doubles victory of the weekend.
ITie fifth-ranked duo defeated Jamil Al-
Agba and Dejan Cvetkovic of USC, N-4.
Making Stanford's victories over the
southern California schools even more im
pressive was the absence of freshman Matt
Bruch, who continues to be plagued by in
juries. Bruch. the fourth-ranked singles

player in the country, has yet to appear in a
dual match for Stanford this year.
Corkery, playing at the No. I singles and
doubles positions in both matches, suffered
a rare loss on Saturday, dropping a 6-0,6-2
decision to third-ranked singles player Ben
jamin Kohlloeff of UCLA. Corkery defeat
ed USC's Dejan Cvetkovic, 6-3,6-4, on Fri
day.
Stanford's only match this week is
against UC-Irvine this Friday at 5:00 p.m. at
Taube.

may not have even happened, as Ras
mussen did not play singles against USC.
Head coach John Whitlinger made the deci
sion to change the lineup against the Bruins.
"Sometimes as a coach you have a little
bit of a feel." Whitlinger said. "I just wanted
to give him a chance. I felt it might be
Chris's time. Sometimes you roll the dice
and it works. Yesterday it worked."
Friday's hero was freshman Blake
Muller. who clinched the victory over USC
with a 6-0,6-7,6-4 victory over Garrett Sny
der at the No. 4 singles spot.
"1 was nervous, but [it helped] having a
coach out on the court," Muller said. "As the
third set started I just remembered what
they told me and tried to stay as loose as
possible and that helped a lot."
Muller also posted a 6-0, 6-4 victory
against Philipp Gruendler against UCLA
on Saturday, making for a very successful
weekend for the freshman in his first dual
matches against ranked opponents. He
credited the coaching staff's preparation.
"Going into the matches our coaches
talked to us about the importance [of the
matches]," he said."l thought the coaching
staff did a great job of getting us ready, both
mentally and physically."
Whitlinger was impressed with Muller's
performance.
"I was really happy for him," Whitlinger
said. "[lt's not easy for] a freshman to be
thrown into a situation to clinch a match.
Nerves were taking over a bit and you never

know how guys are going to act, especially
as a freshman. 1 really was proud of the way
he finished the match."
Along with Muller. juniors James Pade
and James Wan were solid in the middle of
the singles lineup for Stanford, which had a
1 -6 record in matches decided by a 4-3 score
last season/Hie No. 2-4 singles players each
won their matches against USC and UCLA.
Pade, another player who redshirted last
year, added to his string of dominating per
formances while losing only 12 games dur

ing the weekend matches. He defeated
Kaes Van't Hot" of USC, 6-3, 6-4 and
Haythem Abid of UCLA, 6-2,6-3. He also
teamed with senior KC Corkery for Stan
ford's only doubles victory of the weekend.
ITie fifth-ranked duo defeated Jamil Al-
Agba and Dejan Cvetkovic of USC, N-4.
Making Stanford's victories over the
southern California schools even more im
pressive was the absence of freshman Matt
Bruch, who continues to be plagued by in
juries. Bruch. the fourth-ranked singles

player in the country, has yet to appear in a
dual match for Stanford this year.
Corkery, playing at the No. I singles and
doubles positions in both matches, suffered
a rare loss on Saturday, dropping a 6-0,6-2
decision to third-ranked singles player Ben
jamin Kohlloeff of UCLA. Corkery defeat
ed USC's Dejan Cvetkovic, 6-3,6-4, on Fri
day.
Stanford's only match this week is
against UC-Irvine this Friday at 5:00 p.m. at
Taube.
