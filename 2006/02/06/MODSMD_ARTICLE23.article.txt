# MEN'S SWIMMING & DIVING
## No. 9 USC drowns Cardinal in L.A. 
### KATHERINE BELL 
After cruising to a 134-115 victory over Cal State
Bakersfield, the nation's top-ranked Division 11
team, on Friday, the men's swimming and diving
team had their work cut out for them on Saturday
against No. 9 Southern California. Sure enough, the
Trojans upset the Cardinal 123-120 in what proved
to be the team's toughest and closest competition so
far this year.
Senior Michael McLean said the men had been
expecting a challenging meet.
"USC came out strong from the start," McLean
said. "We knew they were going to swim fast since
it was their last home meet, and that we'd have to
swim strong and come together as a team."
Though edged out by the Trojans (2-3,2-2 Pac
-10) — who set three new pool records in route to
their upset — the previously undefeated Cardinal
(3-1,2-1) recorded five individual wins and many
close second-place finishes.

Junior Hongzhe Sun won the 200 back with a
1:42.86, freshman Paul Kornfeld took the 200
breast with a 1:57.41, and Oriwol captured the 200
IM with a 1:46.48. In the only double-win of the
day for Stanford, freshman Dwight Dumais swept
the diving events with a 336.90 in the 1-meter and
a 360.82 in the 3-meter.
Several men managed to swim to multiple sea
son-best times, showcasing their depth a ability that
bodes well for the upcoming end-of-season compe
titions. These include juniors Chuy Phillips (500
and 1,650 free) and an under-the-weather Ben
Wildman-Tobriner (50 free), sophomores Phillip
Morrison (500 free) and Danny Beal (200 fly),and
freshmen Chris Ash (200 breast) and Jason Dun
ford (1 (K) free). McLean predicts the team will be
more ready to race No. 2 California in their final
dual meet in two weeks.
"I think we can come out stronger in the first
couple of events and take the early lead against
Cal," McLean said. "We'll be more rested and ex

cited since it's our last home meet, and from there
we'll just have to keep up the intensity and win
through our depth."
The upset marks only the seventh dual meet
loss in 13 years for head coach Skip Kenney's.
However, Kenney, who has led the men to 24
straight Pac-10 titles, was encouraged by the
team's fast swimming despite the final outcome.
"We had some fast times and he wanted us to be
upbeat about the meet and focus on the rest of the
season — especially the championship meets
coming up." McLean said.
On their way down to Los Angeles, the No. 3
Card stopped in Bakersfield to walk away with all
but one event. The races included such non-
NCAA sprint events as the 50-yard backstroke,
breaststroke and butterfly and the KM) individual
medley. The Stanford men went 1-2-3 in seven of
the 15 events, and senior Tobias Oriwol clocked in
the team's best time — and the nation's fifth best
time — this year in the 400 1M (3:48.71).

team, the Card won 14 of 15 events and won 134-1 15.
