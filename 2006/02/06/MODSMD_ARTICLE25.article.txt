## Stanford examines comet Dust could particles hold key to the origination of the universe 
### KAT LEWIN STAFF WRITER 
Scientists at Stanford have been feeling
a little spacey lately. On Jan. 15. NASA's
Stardust mission touched down after a
seven-year excursion through space, hear
ing precious interstellar dust. The particles
brought back are now being evaluated at
approximately two-dozen universities, in
cluding Stanford as part of project Star
dust@home.
ITie stardust was collected from the tail of
comet WILD-2 (pronounced " vilt"). Accord
ing to Sean Brennan, a physicist at the Stan
ford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory
(SSRL) physicist, this collection was especial
ly significant because the comet has only
passed by the sun five times.
"This is the first time we have brought
back extraterrestrial materials since Apollo,
and it's the first time we've had access to pris
tine meteoric material." Brennan said."Prior
to' 74, WILD-2 was in orbit outside of Jupiter,
far from the sun. We were worried that every
thing we'd been looking at had been
processed by the sun. What you really want to
do is fly out past Jupiter and grab one of those
rocks."
The limited exposure to the sun differen
tiates the particles from meteorites that have
been studied in the past,explained third-year
chemistry graduate student Maegan
Spencer, who will also be studying the space
dust.
"When a meteorite falls to Earth it's so
hot it forms a fusion crust," Spencer said.

"The rock melts and preserves everything
in it."
Spencer and Brennan are both part of
collaborative preliminary examination team
comprised of about 150 scientists all over the
world. Spencer explained, 'lliis team will
have exclusive access to the particles until
September 2006, according to Brennan. and
will analyze aspects of the dust ranging from
bulk chemistry to isotopes to amino acids
and organic compounds. Among the first in
stitutions to have access to these particles are
a BayPac consortium of approximately 15 to
20 scientists from the Stanford Linear Accel
erator Center (SLACK I'C-Berkeley and
the Lawrence Livermore National Labora
tory. The team's results will be published col
lectively until the end of this time period,
after which the particles will be made avail
able to other members of the scientific com
munity.
"In science there's this unfortunate repu
tation of competition," Brennan said. "Peo
ple may ask: Why did Berkeley get the sam
ples before us? But in the end. we're trying to
get the best science out there."
To this end. scientists have been develop
ing methods to retrieve and examine the par
ticles since the project's launch. A major ob
stacle confronted by the mission, according
to Spencer, was figuring out how to collect
the samples slowly enough that they were
not damaged. To accomplish this, the collec
tion plate on the shuttle was fitted out with
130 panels of a substance called aerogel.
Aerogel is a silica structure, like glass, that is
99.9 percent air. making it the lowest density
solid known to man. Spencer said. Due to this,
it has been dubbed "solid smoke.'"llie low den-
sity of the aerogel allowed the particles
to be slowly captured by the shuttle.
"The comet moves at six times the
speed of a rifle bullet," Spencer said.
"Usually you can't see the particles
with the naked eye, so scientists study
the tracks and trails the dust leaves in
aerogel. When particles go through
aerogel, they leave fragmentary de
bris."
Spencer will analyze this debris
through two-step laser mass spec
trometry in order to find polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons. She is part of
a team of scientists studying the organ
ics of the particles based on these frag
ments left in aerogel.
"We can get information out of
stuff that would be trash to other peo
ple," she said.
Brennan and his research partners,
Konstantin Ignatyev.Katharina Luen
ing and Piero Pinanetta will map the
elemental composition of the particles

using an X-ray microprobe at SLAC.
According to Brennan, this will help
scientists begin to evaluate the process
of star formation.
"This is a piece of unaltered pre
solar material," Brennan said. "Our
solar system coalesced out of pre-solar
nebula 4.6 billion years ago. Think
about it: you have all this dust, and the
lion's share becomes the sun, the next
biggest portion forms Jupiter, and the
rest is left for the other planets â€” but
there's still some floating around, and
it makes comets. WILD-2 is one of
those comets. This is an extremely im
portant step forward in potentially im
proving our understanding of how the
solar system was formed."
Brennan's team is slated to start
research at the end of February;
analysis of the particles has already
begun for some members of the Bay-
Pac consortium.
"We are not going to have com
pletely studied these particles by the
end of our allotted time," Brennan
said. "We will be examining them for
five years minimum before we run of
out tests to do on them.This is going to
be a treasure trove for years to come."
