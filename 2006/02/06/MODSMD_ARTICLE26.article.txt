## U.N. worker urges support for Palestine 
### BEN EPPLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Azza Karam of the United Nations De
velopment Program passionately argued for
American and European cooperation with
the newly-elected Hamas government and
discussed the gender egalitarianism of the Is
lamist movement in her speech at Stanford
last Friday.
"We don't have the luxury of turning our
back on the Palestinian elections," she said.
The talk, sponsored by the Coalition for
Justice in the Middle East (CJME) and co
sponsored by the Roosevelt Institute's Cen
ter for International Security and the Muslim
Students Awareness Network, characterized
political Islam as distinct from Islam as a cul
ture, a religion and a fundamentalist move
ment. Coinciding with last week's electoral
victory of I lamas. Karam's discussion "could
not be more timely," said to Nizar Melki, vice
president of CJME.
In most Arab countries, Karam said,"The
halo around Islamism is amazing." As the
"untried political alternative," political Is
lamist parties enjoy tremendous popular
support not just in Palestine but around the
Arab world. Islamist parties would win elec
tions held in Egypt and Jordan today.
Pointing to corruption in Fatah, Pales
tine's more secular former ruling party, and
the autocratic manner in which Egyptian
President Hosny Mubarak oppresses opposi
tion, she argued, "Secular politicians have to
take responsibility for their failure to reach
the hearts and minds of the people in the way
that political Islam has been able to."
The election represents "a new form of
political engagement and development" for
the Islamist movement, according to Karam.
"If the Palestinians get their rights and the Is
raelis get their peace, who can complain?"
she asked. Even if Hamas is not successful in
negotiating a satisfactory settlement, as
seems likely, the radical Islamic group will
still have to "be politicians."The newly-elect -
eU government will need to address ap
palling conditions in Palestinian refugee
camps, organize social services and come to
the table with Israel, she added.
"They cannot fight as they have been
doing," Karam said.
At a time when Western countries threat
en to withhold support from the Palestinian
government if Hamas does not renounce its
more radical stances, Karam called such a
policy negligent.
"How dare we turn our back on that?" she
asked, referring to the United States' de
clared support for democracy around the
world.
Karam also offered practical reasons for
the United States and European Union's
continued engagement with Hamas. If the
Western world withdraws its backing from a
government, she warned, "we create mar
tyrs."
Karam also noted distinctions within the

Islamist sphere. Like any movement, Is
lamism consists of moderates, radicals and
those in between. "The main difference be
tween radical Islamists and moderates is
their position vis a vis the use of violence."
The militant, terrorist-sponsoring arm of
Hamas belongs at the radical end of the spec
trum. she said, expressing her hope that the
group will continue the moderate shift initi
ated by its decision to participate in the polit
ical process.
Although Karam's 50-person audience
had questions pertaining to specific points of
her argument, many listeners found it com
pelling.
"Of course, the biggest danger is always
'one man. one vote, once,'" said aerospace
engineering and international relations grad
uate student Ben Goldsmith. "But if we can
sidestep that, I think there's an opportunity
for real change."
One of Karam's more controversial
points was her contention that — with the
election of Hamas and other Islamist parties
— "women will become very critical inter
locutors." She argued that since the begin
ning. women have played key roles in Is
lamist movements, doing everything from
"sitting on central committees to smuggling
weapons beneath their [coverings]."

Audience members expressed skepticism
on this point, alluding to the Iranian revolu
tion and arguing that, although women
played key roles in that upheaval, they were
later betrayed and oppressed by the Islamist
government. Karam responded by noting
that until the election of President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad last June, Iran had a female
vice president. She blamed gender inequality
on conservative interpretations of the
Qur'an. Enlightened interpretations of the
Muslim holy book embrace gender equality,
she said.
Karam also argued that Western media
stereotypes the role of Muslim women in the
Middle East, explaining that women play a
greater political role than is widely believed.
"It's just much easier to believe that if a
woman is wearing a bikini she is liberated
and if she is wearing a veil she is oppressed,"
she noted.
CJME representatives said they were
pleased with the dialogue.
"We felt that Dr. Karam's talk achieved
the important goal of CJME, which is to pro
mote campus awareness of topics pertaining
to the Middle East and U.S. foreign policy to
wards the region," Olivia Sohns,co-president
of the coalition, wrote in an email to The
Daily.
