## GSB jumps again in Financial Times rank Administrators, students say they do not put much stock in media ratings 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM STAFF WRITER 
In rankings released last week by The
Financial Times of London. Stanford's
Graduate School of Business (GSB)
ranked third in the world among busi
ness schools, behind the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton School and the
Harvard Business School.
The 2006 results continued an im
pressive trend of improvement for the
GSB. which climbed to number seven in
2004 and then jumped three more places
to the number four slot in 2005.
Rounding out the top five in this
year's rankings were Columbia Business
School and London Business School.
According to its Web site, the annual
Financial Times global MBA rankings
were first published in 1999. They are
based on "three sets of criteria: the ca
reer progress of alumni from the school,
the international make up of the school
and how effectively the school generates
new ideas."
"There are a plethora of rankings
around business schools. Each one
measures something different," said
Dan Rudolph, senior associate dean at
the GSB. "There are many fine schools,
each with a different program and char
acter."
"Although it is always great to be rec
ognized for what we do we do not live
and die by these surveys," remarked
Sharon Hoffman, associate dean and di
rector of the MBA program at the GSB.
GSB students also said they were not
overly concerned with the results.
"Although naturally it makes stu
dents proud," said first-year business
student Patrick Kann, "it doesn't show
the personality, diversity and social life
of Stanford students."
Second-year business student Anto

nio F. Buehler agreed.
"I don't pay attention to those rank
ings," he said. "We do well in some and
worse in others."
Part of the difficulty in giving rank
ings credence is the enormous range in
their conclusions, noted Hoffman.
"The sheer fact that on an annual
basis we are ranked anywhere from
number one to number seventeen sug
gests that it is really hard for us to know
how we're doing," she said. For example,
this year The Wall Street Journal ranked
the GSB as 15 in the nation.
However, the breakdown of informa
tion in the rankings can provide valuable
insights, I ioffman explained.
"There is information you can glean
from these surveys," she said.
She provided the hypothetical exam
ple of the trend that more alumni want
to hear from their schools. Discovering
this from a survey such as that ofTTie Fi
nancial Times might allow the school to
hone the services they provide.
A school should not, however, rely on
media rankings to be cognizant of such
issues as the status of alumni relations.
Said Hoffman, "If we're doing our job
right, we will not learn a lot from a sur
vey."
"While we learn what we can from
what each survey tells us, no single rank
ing captures the whole of what we do."
To that end, the GSB plans to stay
true to its course, regardless of surveys
conducted by various news sources.
In terms of the GSB's academic pro
grams. Hoffman said, "We will not
change our academic focus based on a
media study."
"Everyone who comes here knows
what they're getting, and leaves well
off," Buehler explained.
Indeed, the rankings — though per
haps interesting to compare and moni
tor — play little role in the grand
scheme of things.
"We are delighted to be noticed,"
added Hoffman. "But we try to stand
apart from the surveys."
