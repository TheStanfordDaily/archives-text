## Gender committees created Law school investigates sexual misconduct through committees 
### AMIT ARORA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Facing allegations of sexual harassment and
misconduct, Stanford Law School announced the
creation of four committees to investigate gender
relations on campus last week. Comprised of both
students and faculty, the committees will examine
admissions, career services, classroom participa

tion and student life.
With input from Law School administration, the
faculty, the Law Association and the Women of
Stanford Law, Law School Dean Larry Kramer
promoted the idea of committees and expressed his
support for student discourse in a letter to the Law
School student body. 1 le described the necessity for
such discussions and referred to allegations of sex
ual harassment involving conduct between stu
dents.
"Some serious charges were brought to us of
physical groping, sexual harassment,
verbal abuse and other sexual miscon
duct," Kramer wrote. "Preliminary in
quiries made clear that these warrant
ed further scrutiny."
Kramer also referred to possible
disciplinary action upon further inves
tigation bv the University's Counsel
Office.
"If any of the charges prove to be
founded, the case will be referred to
Judicial Affairs and appropriate disci
plinary action — which may include
expulsion or suspension — will be
taken," he wrote. "Ihe University and
the Law School take such misconduct

very seriously and will not tolerate it."
While the committees will not ad
dress specific claims, they will address
the long-term ramifications of such
conduct and gender relations in gener
al. By encouraging students of both
sexes and all years to participate in the
process, the administration looks to
stimulate positive discussion and cre
ate substantial change. Associate
Dean of Student Affairs Cathy Glaze
wrote a letter to the student bt>dy de
scribing the importance of diversity in
the discussions on January 31.
"In order to make sure that the
committees will arrive at ideas that will
gain broad support within the Law
School community, each committee
needs to reflect a diverse range of ex
periences and perspectives," she
wrote.
While the committees will address

issues of gender relations at the Law
School, such charges of sexual miscon
duct are widespread among law
schools around the nation. Law School
Prof. Deborah Rhode acknowledged
the universality of such issues in an in
terview with The Daily.
"The problem, by no means, is
unique to Stanford," she said. "Virtual
ly every law school has had issues of
these concerns. I was called to Yale
Law School, for example, where stu
dents had made posters rating the
most attractive students in the class.
These issues have continued to pop up
throughout law schools around the na
tion."
In March 2(K)3, Rhode wrote an ar
ticle about former Boalt I lall School of
Law Dean John Dwyer. who resigned
following student claims of sexual ha
rassment in 2(X)2. In the article,she rec

ognized the difficulty of raising such al
legations.
"Fewer than 10 percent of those
who experience harassing conduct are
willing to file complaints." she wrote.
"For most victims, the personal costs of
public action are prohibitive, including
time, energy and sometimes money.
And their payoffs include shame,
ridicule and blacklisting."
Administrators at the Stanford
Law School, however, hope to avoid
the embarrassment and difficulty of
reporting through committees. Rhode
endorsed the idea and stressed its im
portance on campus.
"For years, students have talked
with me regarding these issues," she
said. "Their concerns with reporting
are that their classmates will ask them
to get ;i life. I think that the Law School
is attempting to constructively re

spond to these issues. I think that these
concerns are real and the desire to deal
with them is also real."
In relation toother universities and
law schools, Stanford Law School's ap
proach through committees is some
what unique. Kramer recognized the
differences in an interview with The
I )aily.
" Ilie usual approach when this has
happened elsewhere has been to cre
ate a single, public commission that in
vestigates and issues a report with rec
ommendations and then goes out of
existence," he said. "After consulting
with faculty, students, staff and alumni,
as well as University officials, we decid
ed to take a slightly different ap
proach, with several, smaller, more fo
cused groups.This would enable more
people to become involved, ease the
sense that one needed to finish bv a

fixed date, generate a wider range of
ideas and recommendations and shift
the emphasis from reporting to doing."
With no deadline for the individual
committees, the administration looks
to stimulate positive and permanent
change. Kramer ultimately placed
value on the Fundamental Standard
and the necessity for sufficient support
and respect.
"Stanford Law School has long
had a well-deserved reputation for its
supportive environment and healthy,
respectful student culture," he said.
"This is still the case.The significance
of the issue now comes from the fact
that we take any complaint seriously
and do not want to wait until problems
grow. Our approach is to be proactive,
to ensure that Stanford remains a sup
portive and respectful place, rather
than reactive."
