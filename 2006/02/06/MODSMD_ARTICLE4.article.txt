## Stanford lab invents voice recording email service Yackpack enables time-delayed communication 
### H. WELLS WULSIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Thanks to the work of a Stanford technology
lab, those who want to leave a voicemail but are dis
appointed to hear a real live person answer the
phone may dial in fear no more. Yackpack, a free
new service available at http://www.yackpack.com.

makes it easy to leave voice messages for friends
without the risk of speaking directly to another
human being.
I .ike email, Yackpack enables users to send
messages to multiple recipients. But instead of
typing messages on a keyboard, the user records
his or her own voice with a computer microphone.
BJ Fogg, director of Stanford's Persuasive
Technology Lab. founded Yackpack and launched
the service to the public last November. In the fu
ture, Fogg expects the site will continue to offer a
free version of the service with advertisements, as
well as an advanced level of service for a monthly
fee.
"It has all the convenience of email with all the
richness of voice," said Fogg, "in a system that's

completely Web-based and free."
Yackpack features a simple inter
face so intuitive that, according to
Fogg, "even a three-year-old can use
it." The screen shows users the mem
bers of his or her "pack" — a group
of friends. Click one, a few or all of
them, and then record the "yack" —
an audio file to send. Recipients are
notified by email, and can listen to
the message on the Yackpack Web
site. Users can only yack to someone
who has been invited into their pack,
thus preventing yack-spam from
strangers.
Yackpack and email are examples
of asynchronous communication,
meaning the message may be re
ceived an extended time after being
sent. While real-time communication
already exists for voice (telephone)
and text (instant messaging), Yack
pack is among the first applications to
offer asynchronous voice communi
cation.
"Synchronous voice has been
around for, what — a hundred years?
But there hasn't been any easy way to
do asynchronous voice," Fogg said.
"There are two advantages to asyn
chronous audio over real-time: It's
more convenient and more control
lable. I don't have to schedule an ap
pointment with you. or hope you're
not in the shower when I call. 1 do it
on my time, you can do it on yours.
And it's controllable, because if I
don't like my message, 1 can re
record it."
Fogg developed the idea for Yack
pack after a year of researching how
women create and maintain relation
ships.
"Women are a lot better about
talking about relationships than men
are, and they're eager to tell you what
works and what doesn't," he said.
"After about six months, 1 stepped
back and looked at the big picture. I
found the more these women tried to
use email to maintain their relation
ships, the more these relationships
deteriorated.
"I kept hearing the same story
again and again.'We were good
friends, but we stopped phone-calling
and started emailing, and the emails
gradually got shorter and shorter,
and then we lost touch,"' he said.
Fogg said he envisions Yackpack
as bridging a communication gap that

email simply can't fill.
"Even 10 years ago, something
like this wasn't as needed as it is
today, because we weren't as busy,
and we weren't as spread out," he
said. "Email has become the way of
doing everything and that's hurting
our relationships because email lacks
emotional richness."
"What I needed to develop was an
interface that's as easy to use as
email, but with emotional richness,?
he said. "Voice is magical. It contains
so much information that words and
text don't contain. You could pick a
phrase like 'Hey, that's pretty cool,'
and say it 50 different ways, and mean
something different by every one."
Fogg said he designed Yackpack
with communication among family
members and friends in mind, but
that it has already caught the atten
tion of businesses and organizations.
"A charter school in Las Vegas is

using it to teach Spanish," Fogg said.
"A private school in the Bay Area is
using it among staff for feedback and
acknowledgment for great work.
Schools are using it for parent
teacher communication."
Derek Baird, an educational con
sultant in Los Angeles, said he uses
Yackpack to collaborate with col
leagues overseas.
"1 work in online education." he
said."For us it is a huge thing. A lot of
times you have students from all over
the world. When you hear the voice,
there's an emotional connection. It
clicks."
Though none of the handful of
Stanford students interviewed had
heard of Yackpack. some thought it
could be useful. Jenn Chen, a junior,
said it might be handy for times when
a single phone call won't suffice.
"I feel like it would be useful in
certain situations, like if you're hav

ing a party and you want to invite a
lot of people," Chen said.
Nicole Yeh, a sophomore, agreed.
"Sometimes when 1 want to call
my dad [in Taiwan] and he might not
pick up. then this could be useful," she
said.
Michael Baumgaertner, a junior,
was not impressed by the idea.
"No, God no." Baumgaertner
said."lt's impersonal. 1 don't like dis
embodied mechanical voices. II I
wanted to talk to these people. 1
would call them. Emails are bad
enough, this seems worse."
Fred Chang,a senior, also said that
text satisfies his communication
needs.
"1 find email so much more effi
cient because I can see what I've writ
ten and revise it if 1 need." he said.
"Given that I have four or five IM ap
plications on my desktop already, this
would just be an extra burden."
