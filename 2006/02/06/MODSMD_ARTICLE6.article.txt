## Hernandez leads Card to W despite loss of Haryasz for second half 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
Senior guard C'hris Hernandez
made clutch, last-second shots in
Stanford's last two contests —
heart-stopping victories over
Washington and Oregon. And
though Saturday's tilt at Oregon
State wasn't quite as dramatic as
the two games that preceded it,
Hernandez was just as key down
the stretch — and the Cardinal
once again claimed a victory.
On the strength of a 20-4 first
half run.and a season-high 28
points from I lernandez — includ
ing 11 straight Stanford points in
the game's final minutes — the
Card withstood the loss of senior
forward Matt Haryasz to a bruised
left eye, and hung on for a 71-64
win over Oregon State 11^-12,3-8
Pac-10).
Haryasz's injury was just about
the only negative on an otherwise
outstanding day for the Cardinal
(12-7, 8-3), winners of six straight
and eight of their last nine.
With 4:15 left in the first half
and Stanford leading 29-14, Ore
gon State forward Sasa Cuic (15
points) drove the lane against
Haryasz, the two-time defending
Pac-10 Player of the Week. As
Cuic laid in a finger-roll with his
right hand, his left hand caught
Haryasz in the left eye.
Haryasz, who was whistled for
a defensive foul on the play, lay
motionless on the court for sever
al seconds before being taken to
the locker room. He returned just
a few minutes later with his left
eye swollen shut, and could not
reenter a contest that saw the
Beavers slowly chip away at Stan
ford's double-digit lead.
