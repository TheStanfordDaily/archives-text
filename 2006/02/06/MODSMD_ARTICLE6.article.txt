## Hernandez leads Card to W despite loss of Haryasz for second half 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
Senior guard C'hris Hernandez
made clutch, last-second shots in
Stanford's last two contests —
heart-stopping victories over
Washington and Oregon. And
though Saturday's tilt at Oregon
State wasn't quite as dramatic as
the two games that preceded it,
Hernandez was just as key down
the stretch — and the Cardinal
once again claimed a victory.
On the strength of a 20-4 first
half run.and a season-high 28
points from I lernandez — includ
ing 11 straight Stanford points in
the game's final minutes — the
Card withstood the loss of senior
forward Matt Haryasz to a bruised
left eye, and hung on for a 71-64
win over Oregon State 11^-12,3-8
Pac-10).
Haryasz's injury was just about
the only negative on an otherwise
outstanding day for the Cardinal
(12-7, 8-3), winners of six straight
and eight of their last nine.
With 4:15 left in the first half
and Stanford leading 29-14, Ore
gon State forward Sasa Cuic (15
points) drove the lane against
Haryasz, the two-time defending
Pac-10 Player of the Week. As
Cuic laid in a finger-roll with his
right hand, his left hand caught
Haryasz in the left eye.
Haryasz, who was whistled for
a defensive foul on the play, lay
motionless on the court for sever
al seconds before being taken to
the locker room. He returned just
a few minutes later with his left
eye swollen shut, and could not
reenter a contest that saw the
Beavers slowly chip away at Stan
ford's double-digit lead.

Senior guard Chris Hernandez, seen here hitting the game winning shot against Oregon
Thursday night, scored 22 of his 28 points in the second half en route to a 71-64 win.

As of press-time Sunday the in
jury does not appear serious enough
to hold him out of this Thursday's
contest at Cal.
After garnering no fewer than 22
points in each of his last six games.
I iaryasz finished with just six in just
13 minutes against the Beavers. With
I laryasz injured and sophomore for
ward Taj Finger and center Peter
Prowitt in foul trouble in the game's
final minutes, Stanford finished se
verely shorthanded in the front
court, and relied heavily on fresh
man forward Lawrence Hill — and
Hernandez.
After dishing to 1 laryasz through
out much of the first half, Hernandez
shouldered more of the scoring load
in the second, notching 22 of his 28
points in the final period.
Hernandez's most impressive mo
ments came in a 4:35 stretch run during
which he scored 11 straight Stanford
points. He single-handedly kept pace
with the Beavers during that spurt, as a
57-50 Cardinal lead transformed into a
68-61 lead with one minute to play.
"I made some early turnovers in
the first half trying to be too un
selfish." said Hernandez, who fin
ished 9-of-13 overall and 4-of-6 be
yond the arc. "In the second half
when I got to the lane, 1 just tried to
make some plays."
Senior guard Dan Grunfeld added
13 for the Card, who jump into a tie
for second place in the league with
California (14-6, 8-3). The cross-bay
rivals, who trail league-leader UCI.A
(19-4.9-2) by one game.The two will
battle for sole possession of second

place in Berkeley on Thursday after
use (15-7. 6-5), Arizona (13-9, 6-5)
and Washington (16-5, 5-5) — the
next three teams in the league stand
ings — all lost on Saturday.
Despite rising in the Pac-10 stand
ings. Stanford still has a long ways to go
to earn a berth in the NCAA Tourna
ment. Most experts project Stanford to
currently rank about 90th in the Rat
ings Percentage Index (RPI) — the
computer formula the NCAA Selec
tion Committee carefully scrutinizes
when selecting teams for its postsea

son tournament. Assuming the Cardi
nal do not win the Pac-10 Tournament
and the associated automatic bid in
March, an RPI of 50 or lower will like
ly he needed for the Cardinal to garner
serious postseason consideration.
To rise that far in the ratings. Stan
ford will likely need to win at least
five of its eight remaining regular
season contests. This week's visits to
Cal and No. 5 Gonzaga, a Feb. 23 visit
to No. 15 Washington and the regu
lar-season finale versus No. 13
UCLA highlight the slate.
