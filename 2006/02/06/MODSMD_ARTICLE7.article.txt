## Card start hot with home sweep Freshman tested in shocking sweep of No. 5 CS-Fullerton 
### SEAN BRUICH 
With its freshman class delivering
huge dividends all weekend long, the
Stanford Cardinal captured three close
wins to upset No. 5 Cal State-Fullerton
with a season-opening series sweep.
The Cardinal picked up two one-run
victories to start the series — 2-1 on
Friday night and 6-5 on Saturday after
noon — before taking Sunday's game
6-3.
"This was huge for us," said sopho
more right-fielder Michael Taylor, who
hit .364 (4-11) with a homerun in the se
ries. "This was a really big series and a
big stage for us."
Amid questions about their pitching
staff and the heart of their batting order,
Stanford (3-0) entered the 2(H)6 season
unranked by Baseball America for the
first time in history. But the Cardinal
matched up well against the highly
ranked Titans (0-3).
Mead coach Mark Marquess wasted
no time in testing his youngest players,
giving seven freshman (Joey August, Je
remy Bleich. Jason Castro, Brent
Milleville,Cord Phelps, Sean Ratliff and
Austin Yount) a chance to make their

collegiate debuts this weekend.
Bleich. Ratliff and Yount each picked
up a win in the series after making their
first appearances on the mound for
Stanford, combining for nine innings of
scoreless relief.
Yount and Ratliff also got into the act
at the plate. Yount started the first two
games of the series at third base — in
place of tjjje injured Adam Sorgi — and

contributed a double, a triple and a
homerun to go along with a team-lead
ingfour RBI. Ratliff pinch hit on Sunday
and added a sacrifice fly.
"You can't say enough about our
freshman class so far," Yount said.
"Everyone is pretty intense and wants to
contribute as much as possible."
