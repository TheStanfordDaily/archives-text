## Card start hot with home sweep Freshman tested in shocking sweep of No. 5 CS-Fullerton 
### SEAN BRUICH 
With its freshman class delivering
huge dividends all weekend long, the
Stanford Cardinal captured three close
wins to upset No. 5 Cal State-Fullerton
with a season-opening series sweep.
The Cardinal picked up two one-run
victories to start the series — 2-1 on
Friday night and 6-5 on Saturday after
noon — before taking Sunday's game
6-3.
"This was huge for us," said sopho
more right-fielder Michael Taylor, who
hit .364 (4-11) with a homerun in the se
ries. "This was a really big series and a
big stage for us."
Amid questions about their pitching
staff and the heart of their batting order,
Stanford (3-0) entered the 2(H)6 season
unranked by Baseball America for the
first time in history. But the Cardinal
matched up well against the highly
ranked Titans (0-3).
Mead coach Mark Marquess wasted
no time in testing his youngest players,
giving seven freshman (Joey August, Je
remy Bleich. Jason Castro, Brent
Milleville,Cord Phelps, Sean Ratliff and
Austin Yount) a chance to make their

collegiate debuts this weekend.
Bleich. Ratliff and Yount each picked
up a win in the series after making their
first appearances on the mound for
Stanford, combining for nine innings of
scoreless relief.
Yount and Ratliff also got into the act
at the plate. Yount started the first two
games of the series at third base — in
place of tjjje injured Adam Sorgi — and

contributed a double, a triple and a
homerun to go along with a team-lead
ingfour RBI. Ratliff pinch hit on Sunday
and added a sacrifice fly.
"You can't say enough about our
freshman class so far," Yount said.
"Everyone is pretty intense and wants to
contribute as much as possible."


GUS JEWELL/The Stanford Daily
Junior centerfielder Jim Rapoport slid safely into home in Sunday's 6-3 win over the
No. 5 Titans. Seven freshman made their debuts in the series for Stanford.
Using an array of off-speed offerings, Stanford's
pitching staff also kept the middle of the Fullerton line
up off balance the entire weekend.The Titans' 3-4-5 hit
ters — seniors Blake Davis, Brett Pill and Chad Curtis
— were a combined 5-for-36 in the series.
The Cardinal set a tone on Friday night when they
captured a 2-1 victory in the bottom of the ninth inning.
With the score tied 1-1, Taylor began the inning with a
triple down the right field line, breaking a string of eight
straight batters retired by the Titans's staff. Fullerton
then intentionally walked the bases loaded to set up a
force play at the plate.
After fouling off several tough pitches, pinch hitter
Brendan Domaracki bounced a sharp single through
the left side of the infield, plating Taylor for the winning
run.
Bleich picked up his first collegiate victory with 21/3
innings of scoreless relief. He came on in place of start
ing pitcher Greg Reynolds with two men on board in
the seventh inning and promptly hit leadoff hitter
Brandon Tripp to load the bases. But Bleich rebound
ed to retire the second baseman Turner on a deep fly
ball to right field to end the inning and the threat. He
followed the escape with two perfect innings in the
eighth and ninth to keep the game tied at 1-1.
Saturday offered another gripping contest as the
two teams went into extra innings tied 5-5 before a balk
brought home the winning run in the tenth.
With senior catcher John Hester on third base after
a leadoff walk and two groundouts, Hester bluffed like
he was headed home on a steal attempt, rattling Fuller
ton hurler Ryan Harris enough to cause the balk.
Ratliff earned the win for Stanford in relief with 3
2/3 innings of scoreless pitching, allowing just one hit
and two walks against six strikeouts.
On Sunday, it was the veterans' turn as Taylor hit a
solo homerun in the first inning and senior second
baseman Chris Lewis followed with a two-run shot in
the second to stake Stanford to an early 3-0 lead. Stan
ford hitters tacked on three more runs in the fifth as the
Titan bats could manage only single runs in the fifth,
sixth, and seventh innings.
But the game would not end without drama. After
debuting as a pitcher and retiring six-straight Fullerton
hitters, Yount faltered in the ninth,allowing a single and
a hit-by-pitch to bring the tying run to the plate.
But head coach Mark Marquess went back to Friday
night's winning pitcher in Bleich, who retired the next
three batters for the save.
"Cal State-Fullerton is a really good team who is going
to be in the mix at the end of the year," Marquess said.
"It's a long season but for us to sweep a team like this
at any point in the season is really important."

With its freshman class delivering
huge dividends all weekend long, the
Stanford Cardinal captured three close
wins to upset No. 5 Cal State-Fullerton
with a season-opening series sweep.
The Cardinal picked up two one-run
victories to start the series — 2-1 on
Friday night and 6-5 on Saturday after
noon — before taking Sunday's game
6-3.
"This was huge for us," said sopho
more right-fielder Michael Taylor, who
hit .364 (4-11) with a homerun in the se
ries. "This was a really big series and a
big stage for us."
Amid questions about their pitching
staff and the heart of their batting order,
Stanford (3-0) entered the 2(H)6 season
unranked by Baseball America for the
first time in history. But the Cardinal
matched up well against the highly
ranked Titans (0-3).
Mead coach Mark Marquess wasted
no time in testing his youngest players,
giving seven freshman (Joey August, Je
remy Bleich. Jason Castro, Brent
Milleville,Cord Phelps, Sean Ratliff and
Austin Yount) a chance to make their

collegiate debuts this weekend.
Bleich. Ratliff and Yount each picked
up a win in the series after making their
first appearances on the mound for
Stanford, combining for nine innings of
scoreless relief.
Yount and Ratliff also got into the act
at the plate. Yount started the first two
games of the series at third base — in
place of tjjje injured Adam Sorgi — and

contributed a double, a triple and a
homerun to go along with a team-lead
ingfour RBI. Ratliff pinch hit on Sunday
and added a sacrifice fly.
"You can't say enough about our
freshman class so far," Yount said.
"Everyone is pretty intense and wants to
contribute as much as possible."


GUS JEWELL/The Stanford Daily
Junior centerfielder Jim Rapoport slid safely into home in Sunday's 6-3 win over the
No. 5 Titans. Seven freshman made their debuts in the series for Stanford.
Using an array of off-speed offerings, Stanford's
pitching staff also kept the middle of the Fullerton line
up off balance the entire weekend.The Titans' 3-4-5 hit
ters — seniors Blake Davis, Brett Pill and Chad Curtis
— were a combined 5-for-36 in the series.
The Cardinal set a tone on Friday night when they
captured a 2-1 victory in the bottom of the ninth inning.
With the score tied 1-1, Taylor began the inning with a
triple down the right field line, breaking a string of eight
straight batters retired by the Titans's staff. Fullerton
then intentionally walked the bases loaded to set up a
force play at the plate.
After fouling off several tough pitches, pinch hitter
Brendan Domaracki bounced a sharp single through
the left side of the infield, plating Taylor for the winning
run.
Bleich picked up his first collegiate victory with 21/3
innings of scoreless relief. He came on in place of start
ing pitcher Greg Reynolds with two men on board in
the seventh inning and promptly hit leadoff hitter
Brandon Tripp to load the bases. But Bleich rebound
ed to retire the second baseman Turner on a deep fly
ball to right field to end the inning and the threat. He
followed the escape with two perfect innings in the
eighth and ninth to keep the game tied at 1-1.
Saturday offered another gripping contest as the
two teams went into extra innings tied 5-5 before a balk
brought home the winning run in the tenth.
With senior catcher John Hester on third base after
a leadoff walk and two groundouts, Hester bluffed like
he was headed home on a steal attempt, rattling Fuller
ton hurler Ryan Harris enough to cause the balk.
Ratliff earned the win for Stanford in relief with 3
2/3 innings of scoreless pitching, allowing just one hit
and two walks against six strikeouts.
On Sunday, it was the veterans' turn as Taylor hit a
solo homerun in the first inning and senior second
baseman Chris Lewis followed with a two-run shot in
the second to stake Stanford to an early 3-0 lead. Stan
ford hitters tacked on three more runs in the fifth as the
Titan bats could manage only single runs in the fifth,
sixth, and seventh innings.
But the game would not end without drama. After
debuting as a pitcher and retiring six-straight Fullerton
hitters, Yount faltered in the ninth,allowing a single and
a hit-by-pitch to bring the tying run to the plate.
But head coach Mark Marquess went back to Friday
night's winning pitcher in Bleich, who retired the next
three batters for the save.
"Cal State-Fullerton is a really good team who is going
to be in the mix at the end of the year," Marquess said.
"It's a long season but for us to sweep a team like this
at any point in the season is really important."

ton hurler Ryan Harris enough to cause the balk.
Ratliff earned the win for Stanford in relief with 3
2/3 innings of scoreless pitching, allowing just one hit
and two walks against six strikeouts.
On Sunday, it was the veterans' turn as Taylor hit a
solo homerun in the first inning and senior second
baseman Chris Lewis followed with a two-run shot in
the second to stake Stanford to an early 3-0 lead. Stan
ford hitters tacked on three more runs in the fifth as the
Titan bats could manage only single runs in the fifth,
sixth, and seventh innings.
But the game would not end without drama. After
debuting as a pitcher and retiring six-straight Fullerton
hitters, Yount faltered in the ninth,allowing a single and
a hit-by-pitch to bring the tying run to the plate.
But head coach Mark Marquess went back to Friday
night's winning pitcher in Bleich, who retired the next
three batters for the save.
"Cal State-Fullerton is a really good team who is going
to be in the mix at the end of the year," Marquess said.
"It's a long season but for us to sweep a team like this
at any point in the season is really important."

With its freshman class delivering
huge dividends all weekend long, the
Stanford Cardinal captured three close
wins to upset No. 5 Cal State-Fullerton
with a season-opening series sweep.
The Cardinal picked up two one-run
victories to start the series — 2-1 on
Friday night and 6-5 on Saturday after
noon — before taking Sunday's game
6-3.
"This was huge for us," said sopho
more right-fielder Michael Taylor, who
hit .364 (4-11) with a homerun in the se
ries. "This was a really big series and a
big stage for us."
Amid questions about their pitching
staff and the heart of their batting order,
Stanford (3-0) entered the 2(H)6 season
unranked by Baseball America for the
first time in history. But the Cardinal
matched up well against the highly
ranked Titans (0-3).
Mead coach Mark Marquess wasted
no time in testing his youngest players,
giving seven freshman (Joey August, Je
remy Bleich. Jason Castro, Brent
Milleville,Cord Phelps, Sean Ratliff and
Austin Yount) a chance to make their

collegiate debuts this weekend.
Bleich. Ratliff and Yount each picked
up a win in the series after making their
first appearances on the mound for
Stanford, combining for nine innings of
scoreless relief.
Yount and Ratliff also got into the act
at the plate. Yount started the first two
games of the series at third base — in
place of tjjje injured Adam Sorgi — and

contributed a double, a triple and a
homerun to go along with a team-lead
ingfour RBI. Ratliff pinch hit on Sunday
and added a sacrifice fly.
"You can't say enough about our
freshman class so far," Yount said.
"Everyone is pretty intense and wants to
contribute as much as possible."


GUS JEWELL/The Stanford Daily
Junior centerfielder Jim Rapoport slid safely into home in Sunday's 6-3 win over the
No. 5 Titans. Seven freshman made their debuts in the series for Stanford.
Using an array of off-speed offerings, Stanford's
pitching staff also kept the middle of the Fullerton line
up off balance the entire weekend.The Titans' 3-4-5 hit
ters — seniors Blake Davis, Brett Pill and Chad Curtis
— were a combined 5-for-36 in the series.
The Cardinal set a tone on Friday night when they
captured a 2-1 victory in the bottom of the ninth inning.
With the score tied 1-1, Taylor began the inning with a
triple down the right field line, breaking a string of eight
straight batters retired by the Titans's staff. Fullerton
then intentionally walked the bases loaded to set up a
force play at the plate.
After fouling off several tough pitches, pinch hitter
Brendan Domaracki bounced a sharp single through
the left side of the infield, plating Taylor for the winning
run.
Bleich picked up his first collegiate victory with 21/3
innings of scoreless relief. He came on in place of start
ing pitcher Greg Reynolds with two men on board in
the seventh inning and promptly hit leadoff hitter
Brandon Tripp to load the bases. But Bleich rebound
ed to retire the second baseman Turner on a deep fly
ball to right field to end the inning and the threat. He
followed the escape with two perfect innings in the
eighth and ninth to keep the game tied at 1-1.
Saturday offered another gripping contest as the
two teams went into extra innings tied 5-5 before a balk
brought home the winning run in the tenth.
With senior catcher John Hester on third base after
a leadoff walk and two groundouts, Hester bluffed like
he was headed home on a steal attempt, rattling Fuller
ton hurler Ryan Harris enough to cause the balk.
Ratliff earned the win for Stanford in relief with 3
2/3 innings of scoreless pitching, allowing just one hit
and two walks against six strikeouts.
On Sunday, it was the veterans' turn as Taylor hit a
solo homerun in the first inning and senior second
baseman Chris Lewis followed with a two-run shot in
the second to stake Stanford to an early 3-0 lead. Stan
ford hitters tacked on three more runs in the fifth as the
Titan bats could manage only single runs in the fifth,
sixth, and seventh innings.
But the game would not end without drama. After
debuting as a pitcher and retiring six-straight Fullerton
hitters, Yount faltered in the ninth,allowing a single and
a hit-by-pitch to bring the tying run to the plate.
But head coach Mark Marquess went back to Friday

"Cal State-Fullerton is a really good team who is going
to be in the mix at the end of the year," Marquess said.
"It's a long season but for us to sweep a team like this
at any point in the season is really important."
