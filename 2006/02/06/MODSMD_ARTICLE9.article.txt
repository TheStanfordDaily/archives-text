## 1 Protesters torch Danish mission in Beirut as violence escalates over caricatures

BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — Muslim
rage over caricatures of the prophet
Muhammad grew increasingly violent
Sunday as thousands of rampaging pro
testers — undaunted by tear gas and
water cannons — torched the Danish mis
sion and ransacked a Christian neighbor
hood. At least one person reportedly died
and about 200 were detained, officials
said.
Muslim clerics denounced the violence,
with some wading into the mobs trying to
stop them. Copenhagen ordered Danes to
leave the country or stay indoors in the
second day of attacks on its diplomatic
outposts in the Middle East.
In Beirut, a day after violent protests in
neighboring Syria, the crowd broke
through a cordon of troops and police that
had encircled the embassy. Security forces
fired tear gas and loosed their weapons
into the air to stop the onslaught.
The protesters, armed with stones and
sticks, damaged police and fire vehicles
and threw stones at a Maronite Catholic
church in the wealthy Ashrafieh area — a
Christian neighborhood where the Danish
Embassy is located.
Flames andsmoke billowed from the 10-
story building, which also houses the Aus
trian Embassy and the residence of Slova
kia's consul. Protesters waved green and
black Islamic flags from broken windows
and tossed papers and filing cabinets out
side.
Witnesses said one protester, apparent
ly overcome by smoke, jumped from a win
dow and was rushed to the hospital. Secu
rity officials said he died.
Thirty people were injured, half of

them members of the security forces, offi
cials said, making it the most violent in a
string of demonstrations across the Mus
lim world. All the injuries were from beat
ings and stones.
Prime Minister Fuad Saniora said be
fore meeting with top Islamic leaders that
about 200 people were detained, and po
lice said they included 76 Syrians, 35 Pales
tinians and 38 Lebanese.

The first apparent victim of the political
fallout from the violence was Interior Min
ister Hassan Sabei, who submitted his res
ignation. It was not immediately clear if
the resignation was accepted.
Sabei said authorities had tried to pre
vent the protest from turning violent.
"Things got out of hand when elements
that had infiltrated into the ranks of the
demonstrators broke through security

shields." he said. "The one remaining op
tion was an order to shoot, but I was not
prepared to order the troops to shoot
Lebanese citizens."
Sabei, like other Lebanese politicians
and Grand Mufti Mohammed Rashid
Kabbani, spiritual leader of Lebanon's
Sunni Muslims, suggested Islamic radicals
had fanned the anger.
Kabbani said outsiders among the protest
ers were tryingto"distort the imageof Islam."
The United States accused the Syrian
government of backing the protests in
Lebanon and Syria.
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said in a statement that the resentment
over the caricatures "cannot justify vio
lence, least of all when directed at people
who have no responsibility for, or control
over, the publications in question."
The Danish Foreign Ministry urged
Danes to leave Lebanon.The violence Sat
urday in Damascus prompted a similar
warning.
"The government has no intention to
insult Muslims," Danish Foreign Minister
Per Stig Moeller said on public radio in
Copenhagen. "We are trying to explain to
everyone that enough is enough."
The Syrian state-run daily newspaper
Al-Thawra said Denmark was to blame
because its government had not apolo
gized for the September publication of the
caricatures in Jyllands-Posten.
The drawings — including one depict
ing the prophet wearing a turban shaped
as a bomb with a burning fuse — have
since been republished in several Euro
pean and New Zealand newspapers as a
statement on behalf of a free press.
Islamic law is interpreted to forbid any
depictions of the Prophet Muhammad for
fear they could lead to idolatry.
