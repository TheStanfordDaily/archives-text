# Grad Life
## Uniquely grand, uniquely grad 
### 
By birth I rank above thee but be
not afraid of grad students. Some
are born to be grad students, some
achieve the grad student status and some
have grad life thrust upon "em by over
zealous parents. Beholding the bare
breasted bevies of bathing beauties at
beaches of Bahamas may beckon some,
but I would rather indulge in intellectual
ly instigating interests of'l.' Meandering
in the myriad meanings of my master's
(thesis advisor) mystic messages is merry
making for me. Sustained sweating of my
scholarly skills for the service of science
and society is the silver I seek.
"Thou was't not born for vanity, im
mortal grad No BMW driving undergrads
tread thee down; The used-bike I see you
riding this passing day was ridden 'In an
cient days by emperor and clown."'
You really believe that about grad stu
dents. don't you? Wearing your purple
hairdo and pink sunglasses, the low-rise
jeans both revealing and concealing your
tattooed posterior, you consider the grads
as dull duds, dutifully performing little
tasks. You scorn and scoff at us, take pity
on our plight, sympathize and shrug.
Grads have no sartorial smartness;
grads have no street smartness. Are the
grads even aware of the pleasures of wine,
women and snuff? What could the grads
have done anyway with their intelligence
of mules and beauty of cacti?
Someday, you tell yourself, that when
you drop out of college (partly because
of the failing grades) and start a compa
ny of your own, you will employ an army
of ex-grad s. Bearing 'the undergrade
burden', you will show them the money
(which will obviously be greater than
their pittance of research assistant
ships) and show them the life and hence
be absolved of all your sins for this noble
deed.
The grad students are so weird, so
geeky, so jerky and so different that you
don't want to even mingle with them. No
one should even mention these creative
ly dumb and emotionally numb grads
during Full Moon on the Quad. All the
undergrads events are separate, all the
undergrad parties are separate and I
won't be surprised if someday they start
reserving front seats of the Marguerite
for undergrads.
Guess what? We still love you. When
you were boozing off watching weekend
football, the grads were toiling in their
dark, dank basement laboratories so that
they could make your TV image a little
higher definition.The cell phone you used
for fixing up your date was the result of
some grad student's broken promise of
taking his wife out for dinner. When you
were getting all hot over Playboy's newest
issue, a grad student was arduously read
ing 'The Fundamentals of Thermodynam
ics,' so that tomorrow in his TA office
hours he could help even the least-pre
pared undergrad.
Yes, we did all that you do now and
more in our younger days. We, after all,
were undergrads once upon a time. But
then we set off on the road less traveled.
Much like those who graduate and work,
we too savor the pleasures of our jour
ney and dream of making our small little
changes in the world in our own small lit
tle way.
Need we mention the fortunate cir
cumstance we consider ourselves in? The
Eureka! moments of figuring a feasible
hypothesis for an incredibly involved
problem; the Oh Damn! moments of ex
periments gone horribly wrong; the
Thank God! moments of success after
failed trials; these undulations make our
life interesting. The 'good job' comment
from the research advisor; the acceptance
of a manuscript in the journal 'Nature';
that enthusiastic ovation after the re
search conference presentation; those
thank you notes from the grateful stu
dents; these are the moments we anxious
ly live for.
So, yes, in a way we grad students are
different. Our sorrows and satisfactions
are different; our clothes and curiosities
are different; we are unique if you want to
call us that. But. we are also, after all,
uniquely exquisite, uniquely grand,
uniquely grad.

views on grad life, e-mail me at ad
