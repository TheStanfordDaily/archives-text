# Dance the Night Away
## First ever graduate student formal to be held next month 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
/ 112 or the first time ever, Stanford gradu
" Late students will have a formal all to

I themselves. The Graduate Student
JL Council (GSC) and the Graduate

Student Planning Board (GSPB) are co
planning and sponsoring this annual

event, which will take place on March 3 at
the Crowne Plaza Cabana in Palo Alto.

"There are several reasons for having a
graduate-wide formal," says GSC Pro-

gramming Coordinator Donna Winston, a
student at the School of Education. "First,

all of the professional schools have formals,
but none of the other graduate schools do.

Several people have commented on this and
expressed a desire for a formal. Secondly, a for-

mal is a way students can come together and meet
each other that's different from other grad-wide
parties that are offered. Lastly, it gives grad stu
dents a chance to dress up and have a really spe
cial night that won't cost them an arm and a leg."
Currently, tickets are on pre-sale and will be
until Feb. 24 for $25 each. After the deadline, the
price will rise to $30 per ticket until the event on
March 3. Tickets are available at the Escondido
Village housing office, located at 859 Escondido
Rd. The office is open 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday
through Thursday and 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Fridays.
Only graduate students can purchase tickets,
though each student can purchase up to two tick
ets and bring a non-Stanford graduate guest. Each
ticket includes appetizers, an open bar (both alco
holic and otherwise), transportation to the event
on charter busses and optional dance lessons.
"There are only 800 tickets available for 8,093
Graduate students," says GSC Co-Chair

Jenny Allen, a second-year law student.
"Each graduate student can purchase up

to two tickets, so I suspect that the tick
ets won't last long."

There will be two different
types of entertainment available in
two separate rooms. In the main

room DJ Kwake and
Eric Pop will take

turns laying down
Top-40 hits. In the side

out with friends and meet other grad students as
well. Based on that response, we're giving people
what they want."
Organizers are fairly confident that the Gradu
ate Formal will return next year.
"It will be up to the new GSC programming co
ordinator, who will assess the level of interest
based on this year's graduate winter formal,"
Allen says."I highly suspect that the Graduate
Winter Formal will become a tradition."
"We plan on making this an annual event."says
Winston. "There is nothing else like it that's open
to the entire graduate community and we feel it
fills a social void. How the event goes this year will
really inform what will happen in successive
years."

GSC programming coordinator

The planning of the event

is a joint effort
between the
(is( and
GSPRThe for
mal committee.

which consists of four
graduate students and

a GSC freshman in-

tern, meets weekly
to set goals, assess
progress and assign

duties. There is not
set leader and the

board decides on all issues in a democratic fash
ion.
According to Allen, there is already a great deal
of buzz in the graduate student community, even a
month before the event. The formal will run from 9
p.m. to 1 a.m. For more information, visit the event
