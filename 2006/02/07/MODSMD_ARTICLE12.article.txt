# Speed dating — The new interdepartmental mixer?
## 
### MIMA MOHAMMED DESK EDITOR 
Graduate students are often pressed for
time, as they pursue their advance degrees
and research projects within their respective
fields. Accordingly, opportunities to meet stu
dents from all across the campus are rare. But
some graduate student groups have come up
with a unique, if not romantic way to bridge
the gap — speed dating.
Speed dating is one of the biggest dating
trends in the country; it is almost old-fash
ioned in contrast with other dating services
that use videotapes or the Internet in match
making. However, there are numerous speed
dating companies that hold events through
out the world, but especially in the United
States, since the format of speed dating caters
to the busy American lifestyle.
The general concept of speed dating in
volves putting women and men in a room and
pairing them briefly to test compatibility. Every
few minutes, they change partners and start
again. One of the great aspects of speed dating
is that there are no strings attached. If there is
an interest between two parties, they can
choose to contact each other after the event.

Lyman's Fourth Annual Speed Dating
event will occur this Friday. Feb. 10 in the
Lyman Atrium, just in time for Valentine's
Day. Out of the many who applied, between
40 and 50 (20-25 of each gender) graduate stu
dents from all departments will be selected to
participate in successive four minute speed
dates. Each participant will receive a packet
containing basic information about each of
their dates, and contact information of each
person's matches will be given out at the end
of the night.
Information will only be given out if both
parties are interested following the date. This
event provides an opportunity for single grad
uate students to meet in a fun, friendly envi
ronment with no pressure to exchange contact
information if the spark is not mutual. Orga
nizers warn: do not attempt to crash the event,
because all the spots are filled beforehand.
"I think this event gives single graduate
students from different departments an op
portunity to meet in a fun, friendly environ
ment with no pressure to exchange contact in
formation," says one of the event coordina
tors and fourth-year doctoral student in me
chanical engineering Beverly Tang. "It allevi
ates the stress and redundancy of meeting

people in bars and will hopefully bring togeth
er people who may not ever cross paths on
this big campus.
Selection for the speed dating was mostly
on a first-come-first-serve basis, with priority
given to residents in Lyman, which houses 220
people on the corner of Campus Drive and
Santa Teresa Street. Participants were chosen
in a manner to promote diversity, a wide range
of departments and interests.
"Past surveys/personal communications
have shown the event to be pretty successful,
and some have started dating people that
they've met through the event, and many
have become good friends or activity partners
with those that share common interests."Tang
says. "Everyone always says that they have a
great time at the actual event — it's always
pretty hectic and entertaining. Last year, [Es
condido Village staff] came to observe our
event so they could model their own Speed
Dating event off of ours, and 1 know that
Rains and the [Graduate Student Council]
also hold similar events now."
The Graduate Student Programming
Board (GSPB) is putting on a speed dating
event this Wednesday at 8:30 p.m. at the GCC.
All the slots are already filled. Iliere will be 20

males and 20 females at the event, and each
male and female will have an opportunity to
talk to one another for three minutes, as the
women will stay seated and the men will
change seats; wine will also be served.
"In holding this event, the GSPB hopes to
provide yet another medium for graduate stu
dents to interact and get acquainted with fel
low graduates students," said the events coor
dinator, management science and engineer
ing master's student Eric Cheung.
If you did not have a chance to sign up for
a speed dating event, do not fret. You can al
ways meet your future spouse at this year's
graduate students Valentine's Day party,
which is expected to draw 500 guests. Dress to
impress, this event will be held at the Gradu
ate Community Center this Friday from 9
p.m. to 1 a.m. and is free.
"I am very excited about this year's grad
Valentine's party!" says event coordinator
Andy Sadhwani. "[Organizers] have teamed
up to make this annual event twice as big and
twice the fun as last year s party. There are
door prizes for the ladies, lots of single stu
dents and fun drinks for all. Stanford ID and
proof of age are required and students must
be 21 and up."
