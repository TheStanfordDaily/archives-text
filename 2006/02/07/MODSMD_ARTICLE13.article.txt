## Editorial The 						Editorial Board's confession of faith 
### 
The Editorial Board is a voice without a
name. As members of the Board, we
write these unsigned editorials under
the veil of anonymity, which somehow
grants us the right to editorialize freely on
controversial issues. Despite our small size
and mysterious existence, we espouse views
that are designed to represent the collective
opinions of the Stanford student body.
As the new members of the Board, we
seek neither fortune nor fame. Many of us
simply enjoy writing about topics we care
deeply about. We feel passionately about a
variety of issues and want others to feel
strongly about them too. We believe that
these topics matter and are not afraid to tell
you why. Moreover, we believe that our
unique experiences and diverse back
grounds give us refreshing insights into
these issues. Together, we are committed to
the process of dialogue and change.
The Daily's Editorial Board is a vehicle of
change, though not always in an obvious way.
Previous boards have often made bold recom
mendations. attempting to influence every
thing from the location of Exotic Erotic to the
choice of the new Pope. At times, the Editori
al Board has been able to reverse decisions
and influence opinions. But often, real change
is slow and concrete results are elusive.
Even so, we are determined to effect
change of a different sort. As a microcosm of
the Stanford community, the Board hopes to

work through our diverse opinions to reach
a consensus. We will debate abortion, gay
rights and stem-cell research. We might also
choose to discuss whether Peer Health Edu
cators should get paid more, and whether
Subway should be open for dinner on week
ends. During our heated debates, we will in
variably and inevitably disagree with one
another. But such is the nature of true dia
logue, and we must strive to work through
our disagreements to reach a compromise.
After all, it is this process of dialogue that we
believe to be the process of lasting change.
Today marks the first editorial by an en
tirely new Editorial Board. We hope to chal
lenge you to think more clearly, to feel more
deeply and to care more fervently. We may
have a new voice, a new writing style and
new perspectives, but we will still have the
same commitment to sustained discourse
and continued engagement with the most
pressing issues of our day.
Our unsigned editorials are only the first
step in the long road to increased dialogue
on the Stanford campus. Our discussions do
not cease at the end of each Board meeting.
We ask you to help us continue the conver
sations we start. We encourage all parties to
be open with us, to keep us informed and to
help us represent viewpoints fairly. We invite
you to contribute letters and opinion pieces
to the page. Above all, we urge you to remain
engaged.
