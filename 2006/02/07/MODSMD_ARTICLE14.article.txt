# Banish awkwardness now
## 
### 
Have you ever said something so stupid
that you felt like you belonged at
Berkeley instead of at Stanford? Do
you often find yourself wanting to initiate a
dialogue with somebody but are unable to
come up with any witty conversation
starters? Do you ever end an 1M chat by put
ting up your away message and leaving the
room because you just don't know how to tell
your buddy good-bye? If you answered "yes"
to any of these questions, this column is for
you!
After extensive research on the subject. 1
have come to two conclusions: First, awk
ward situations are inevitable — they occur
in everybody's life, most prominently in
small gatherings of college-aged students
(especially when one or more of said college
students is lusting after another within the
group). But the second and more important
conclusion is that YOU have the power to
eliminate awkwardness from your life
NOW! Next time you find yourself in an un
comfy situation, try using one of these six
simple techniques and watch embarrassment
become a thing of the past:
1. Share a random fact. Some people propose
reading the newspaper in order to keep up
to-date on current events, but I find that mag
azines are an excellent source of interesting
information. Every issue of Cosmo has a
page of conversation starters. Sports Illus

trated is a wealth of sports trivia and People
is the place to go for celebrity gossip. If you
really want to impress people, however. I rec
ommend poring through old issues of Seven
teen and other teenage girls' magazines —
they are filled cover-to-cover with useless,yet
fun facts. In fact. I still talk about the article
that documented one girl's experiment with
food-scented perfume (take note: the scent
of buttered popcorn attracts guys; the scent
of meat attracts flies).
2. Choose another person in the room. Stare
at that person until he yells at you to stop
being so weird. Congratulations, you have
just broken the silence!
3. Break into song. Ideally, the ensemble cast
of your life will join in. After all, everybody
loves a good musical. However, you may find
that the others in the room slip subtly but

swiftly out the door or that they whis
per snide comments to one another
about your Yoko Ono-esque voice.
But fret not, because your efforts
were not in vain. You have single
handedly dispersed a crowd of peo
ple who had nothing to say to each
other — or at the very least given
them something to talk about. Good
work!
4. Poll your friends. Deep, intellectu
al conversations are interesting and
rewarding, but let's take it one step at
a time. I find that an excellent topic
for the virgin pollster is the classic su
perhero preference question: Super
man, Spiderman or Batman? You
can learn a lot about a person by
knowing who she would like to have
save her from a burning building.
5. Sneeze. Unless everybody around
you is completely lacking in social
graces, at least one person will re
spond with a "Bless you" or
"Gesundheit," to which you can re
spond, "Thanks." Okay, so it's a lame
conversation, but it's better than

nothing.
6. Announce that you are attending a
ballroom dance soon and that you
are looking for a practice partner.
Surely somebody will be willing to
tango with you; take that person to
the center of the room and show off
your moves. Before long, everybody
else will realize how much fun you
are having and will begin to feel left
out; at this point you should split
from your partner and get everyone
out on the dance floor. Before you
know it, you will have a dance party
on your hands — awkward situation
long forgotten.
These tips are only a springboard
for your journey into social compe
tence; once you have mastered these
six techniques, you may want to inte
grate some of your own awkward
ness-busters into your repertoire.
Remember, awkwardness is a state
of mind, and you are now equipped
with all the tools you need to get past
it — so what are you waiting for?
Get out there and banish social inep
titude forever!
