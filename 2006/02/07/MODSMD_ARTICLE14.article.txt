# Banish awkwardness now
## 
### 
Have you ever said something so stupid
that you felt like you belonged at
Berkeley instead of at Stanford? Do
you often find yourself wanting to initiate a
dialogue with somebody but are unable to
come up with any witty conversation
starters? Do you ever end an 1M chat by put
ting up your away message and leaving the
room because you just don't know how to tell
your buddy good-bye? If you answered "yes"
to any of these questions, this column is for
you!
After extensive research on the subject. 1
have come to two conclusions: First, awk
ward situations are inevitable — they occur
in everybody's life, most prominently in
small gatherings of college-aged students
(especially when one or more of said college

group). But the second and more important
conclusion is that YOU have the power to
eliminate awkwardness from your life
NOW! Next time you find yourself in an un

simple techniques and watch embarrassment
become a thing of the past:
1. Share a random fact. Some people propose

is the place to go for celebrity gossip. If you
really want to impress people, however. I rec
ommend poring through old issues of Seven
teen and other teenage girls' magazines —
they are filled cover-to-cover with useless,yet
fun facts. In fact. I still talk about the article
that documented one girl's experiment with
food-scented perfume (take note: the scent
of buttered popcorn attracts guys; the scent
of meat attracts flies).
2. Choose another person in the room. Stare
at that person until he yells at you to stop
being so weird. Congratulations, you have
just broken the silence!
3. Break into song. Ideally, the ensemble cast
of your life will join in. After all, everybody
loves a good musical. However, you may find
that the others in the room slip subtly but
