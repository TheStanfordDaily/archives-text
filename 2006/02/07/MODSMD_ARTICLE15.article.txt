# Op-Ed
## Hamas must be held politically accountable 
### DAVID COHEN LYUBA WOLF 
Yesterday's op-eds about the Palestin
ian election of Hamas ("Hear Hamas out"
and "A historical take on the Hamas elec
tion", Feb. 6) whitewash the radical goals of
that terrorist organization.
When Olivia Sohns equates the Israel
Defense Forces to terrorists, she over
looks the reality that the Israeli army rou
tinely jeopardizes the lives of its soldiers
in order to minimize casualties on the
other side, whereas Hamas operatives
take steps to maximize the number of
civilian deaths. Hamas is a terrorist organ
ization by any reasonable definition of the
term. Even the European Union, which is
reluctant to apply the terrorist label to
many violent organizations which target
civilians, has placed Hamas on its terrorist
list.
Furthermore, the experience of the 1979
Iranian revolution should temper any opti
mism in the moderating effects of political
power. Professor Abbas Milani's essay
"Iran: a Revolution Betrayed" recounts the
Iranian mullahs' promises to embrace
democracy, which they made in order to
court the pro-democracy movement. Pre
revolutionary Iran was more modern and

secular than the current Palestinian territo
ries and had a large middle-class, and yet
proved completely susceptible to a funda
mentalist coup.
Rather than embrace democracy.
Mamas officials have declared the protec
tion of private paramilitary activities to
be a fundamental goal — a stance that se
verely undermines the democratic in
tegrity of their regime. In the months
leading to the elections, they repeatedly
defied the democratically elected Pales
tinian Authority's decree forbidding the
brandishing of weapons in public, under
mining the development of rule of law
and order in the territories.
While America should praise Palestin
ian democratic progress, it must continue
to pressure Hamas to disarm and re
nounce its intention to destroy Israel.
Only a purely political Hamas will be
democratically accountable, and only a
peaceful Hamas that recognizes its neigh
bor's existence can work towards a two
state solution.
