# 'No, I will not go out with you'

How do I end my run of being the most
beloved Daily columnist since Joel
Stein? By writing the forbidden col
umn. the column that's been hiding inside all
of my writing since I wrote the first words of
my first column from freshman year:"l'm out
here, putting my heart on my sleeve."The col
umn about dating.
There's one theory that says that every
thing I've ever written has, on some level,
been about dating (this is mostly true).
There's another that suggests that every
Daily column I've written this year has been
an attempt to woo a specific female (only
true, as far as I can tell, for one column) and
still another that supposes that if I'm ever in
a happy, stable relationship, my creative en
ergy will dry up like an unwatered lawn at
Stanford (I sincerely hope this is not true).
But this doesn't seem to be much of a
problem, since dating (or even hooking up)
has never been my strong suit. I trace my
perennial failures in love to the day my jun
ior high pseudo-girlfriend and I broke up.
Everyone knew we were dating, the school
principal and our parents included... Every
one except for Shara, that is, which is why I
preface "girlfriend" with "pseudo." Also, we
never kissed. When I asked her if we could,
she thought for a minute and then said.
"Eww... grossl" The next day she had her
mother tell me. "Shara needs some space."
Some day I should send Shara my accumulat
ed therapist bills.
Most people don't believe me when I say
I came to Stanford to meet women. But it's
true. I could have gone to Rochester Institute
of Technology and gotten the same CS edu
cation I got here — and not had to worry
about all these unpleasant interactions with
the opposite sex. Everyone promised me that
when I got to college, dating would get easi
er. Everyone lied. My four years here have
been a nearly endless stream of rejection and
heartbreak.
"You're a great guy, but I just don't think
of you in that way. I'm not ready for a rela
tionship; I need some time to find out what
it's like to be single. You're too Jewish, you're
not Jewish enough. I'm Christian and you're
not. I love you. but I've chosen darkness. I'm
too busy. I couldn't make you happy. You're
not in love with me; you're in love with the
idea of me. You're still in love with your ex;
I'm still in love with my ex.
"I'm trying to be a better lesbian. I only go
for older men; I'm dating an investment
banker I met in a bar last week. I'm dating
Dave Baron. You don't look as good in a dress
as that hairless Asian man does. You're only

interested in me because you struck out with
my best friend. You're a virgin — I wouldn't
want to be your first time. You're not confi
dent enough. I cheated on you. I'm 16. I'm
leaving the country next week. I'm emotional
ly unavailable; I only keep men around to toy
with them. I live on a diet consisting only of
broken hearts. I've already filled my quota for
hooking up with people I went to high school
with — better luck next year.
"I was interested, but now I've moved on
— if only you'd asked me last year, last
month, last week. What we had last night was
great, but I'm sort of seeing someone right
now; actually I'm dating about five other
guys right now. I think you're an asshole. I
only date athletes. I'm too spacey, you're too
grounded. I think you're gay and don't know
it. You're too pretentious, you're not preten
tious enough. I'm your English TA. I'm a
sorority girl — I only date members of the
Greek system. I think of you as my little
brother. I'm in a cult. I'm only interested in
dating someone with marriage potential."
Another common bit of false encourage
ment goes (actual quote): "I've always been
impressed that you keep looking and trying
to find the right girl." But I'm not looking for
the right girl. I'm looking for a girl. In fact, I
don't want to find the right girl just yet — I
have a long list of types I'd like to audition
before casting the part.
An English major for the late nights spent
arguing over the artistic merits of Jonathan
Safran Foer. A CS major for the pleasure of
being able to talk without anyone's eyes glaz
ing over about the latest posting on Slashdot
and the finer points of fourth-generation
programming languages. A psych major, be
cause they're just so damn hot. An indie hip
ster for the guaranteed company to rock
shows and thrift stores. A hippie, so I don't
feel so guilty about never having lived in a co
op. A Pi-Phi for the fashion advice and the
"Revenge of the Nerds"-style validation. A
pair of twins, so that later in life I can say
"Hey, remember that time when my life was
like a Penthouse forum letter?" My Daily ed
itor, so that I could pepper my columns with
little private jokes and ask for extensions by

offering to make her breakfast in bed. (Whit
ney, see what you missed out on?) A redhead
because, well. I just have a thing for redheads.
A New York Jew to make my mother happy
— and for the help with The New York Times
crossword.
Maybe I pursue relationships like a check
list because 1 was exposed to "Fiddler on the
Roof" at too young of an age — "For Papa
make [her] a scholar, for Mama make [her]
rich as a king." But the real reason I'm trying
so hard is because I'm incredibly paranoid
that if I'm failing at relationships in an envi
ronment that is theoretically as conducive to
dating as Stanford, then I'm screwed after
graduation.
While at Stanford, I can pretend that
everyone here is relatively sane (they're not
— all girls are crazy), that no one has an STD
(also untrue) and that everyone is decently
intelligent (this one I'll concede — intellec
tual. though, not so much). If I superficially
approach a girl because she is physically at
tractive, I can tell myself that I'm not a horri
ble, shallow human being. By virtue of her
being at Stanford, I can assume that she is
someone Robin Mamlet was proud of admit
ting — an interesting and well-rounded per
son with a base level of positive personal
qualities that I'll be sure to discover in the
process of going on a date.
But none of these myths apply outside of
college, which is why the real world scares me
so much. The singles scene sounds like the
most awful, vapid, lonely,desperate and awk
ward social activity since New Student Ori
entation. Although TV shows and Craigslists'
"missed connections" postings have taught
me that the best way to meet your future
lover is to bump into her on the subway and
cause her to spill coffee on her brand new
dress, or to coyly eye a fellow patron of a
small musty bookstore for weeks. I'm pretty
sure that meeting women after college is
going to be hell.
...And I'm out! Much love to my dedicat
ed readers. If you've enjoyed my column this
year, you should also thank Whitney, my edi
tor, who convinced me to write it by drunkcn
ly flirting with me and who has been a con
stant source of good ideas and wonderful
non-intrusive editing. I'll see you all in New
York. Check www.whizziwig.com for possi
ble future updates about my life, and tune in
to KZSU Mondays at midnight for my show,
"The Sad Men's Club"the —the musical ac
companiment to this column.
