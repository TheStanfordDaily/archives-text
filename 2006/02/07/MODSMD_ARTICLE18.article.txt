The headline of yesterday's article,
"U.N. worker urges support for
Palestine," was both misleading and
inaccurate. Dr. Azza Karam did not
speak for or on behalf of the United
Nations. Additionally, her speech de
livered Friday did not express sup
port for any particular country, peo
ple or point of view. Rather, it ex

plained some of the current political
dynamics taking place in the Arab
region. The Daily regrets the error.
The caption on the photo paired with
the article "Stanford Mock Trial
takes second place," published yes
terday, incorrectly identified team
member and first-year law student
Jeremy Presser as first-year law stu
dent Benjamin Ratner.
