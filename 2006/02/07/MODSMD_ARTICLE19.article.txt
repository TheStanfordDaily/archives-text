In addition to funding private
and public sector research, the ini
tiative also proposes $380 million in
new federal support for math, sci
ence and technological education in
K-12 schools. The money would ex

pand low-income students' access
to Advanced Placement and Inter
national Baccalaureate courses by
training 70,000 additional teachers
over five years, and would encour
age math and science professionals
to become adjunct high school
teachers.
However, some students ex
pressed dissatisfaction with the
educational aspects of the initia
tive.

"It would be great if it worked,"
said freshman Patrick Ardinger.
"But for Bush to claim success on
his past educational policies like the
No Child Left Behind Act, he has to
actually produce the funding for
them. Bush needs to focus on actu
ally devoting money toward im
proving the quality of education in
public schools and increasing incen
tives to teach by offering teachers
higher wages."

In the meantime, however, edu
cators remain hopeful that the ini
tiative will succeed.
Said Hennessy,"The nation's ed
ucation leaders stand ready to work
together with the executive branch,
the Congress and the business com
munity to educate a new generation
of teachers and scientists who will
create new knowledge, strengthen
the economy and sharpen the coun
try's competitive edge."
