## Prof tackles core of human cognition Prof Douglas Hofstadter delivers second Presidential and Endowed Lecture 
### KATHERINE COX STAFF WRITER 
Last night, Cubberly Auditorium was packed long before Prof.
Douglas Hofstadter of Indiana University College of Arts and Sci
ences took the stage to lecture on his fundamental theory on human
cognition in a talk entitled, "Analogy as the Core of Cognition."
Every seat was occupied at the 8 p.m. start time and stragglers found
themselves huddled in the wings of the auditorium straining to see
the stage. Many attendees sat in the lobby area and listened to the
lecture over a set of speakers; some even lined the back of the stage.
The lecture was second in this year's lineup of Presidential and
Endowed Lectures in the Humanities and Arts. The program re
ceives funding from the President's Office and the speakers are
chosen by an advisory committee of Stanford faculty members. Ac
cording to Matthew Tiews, the associate director of the Stanford
Humanities Center, speakers aren't necessarily affiliated with
Stanford, but are usually high-profile individuals who have pio
neered new areas of thought in their respective disciplines. Hofs
tadter, however, is a Stanford alumnus who returned to complete
his John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship in the computer science
department.
