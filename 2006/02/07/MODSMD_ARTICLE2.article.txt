## Prof tackles core of human cognition Prof Douglas Hofstadter delivers second Presidential and Endowed Lecture 
### KATHERINE COX STAFF WRITER 
Last night, Cubberly Auditorium was packed long before Prof.
Douglas Hofstadter of Indiana University College of Arts and Sci
ences took the stage to lecture on his fundamental theory on human
cognition in a talk entitled, "Analogy as the Core of Cognition."
Every seat was occupied at the 8 p.m. start time and stragglers found
themselves huddled in the wings of the auditorium straining to see
the stage. Many attendees sat in the lobby area and listened to the
lecture over a set of speakers; some even lined the back of the stage.
The lecture was second in this year's lineup of Presidential and
Endowed Lectures in the Humanities and Arts. The program re
ceives funding from the President's Office and the speakers are
chosen by an advisory committee of Stanford faculty members. Ac
cording to Matthew Tiews, the associate director of the Stanford
Humanities Center, speakers aren't necessarily affiliated with
Stanford, but are usually high-profile individuals who have pio
neered new areas of thought in their respective disciplines. Hofs
tadter, however, is a Stanford alumnus who returned to complete
his John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship in the computer science
department.


SHAMS SHAIKH/The Stanford Daily
Indiana University Collegeof Arts and Sciences Prof, of Cognitive Science and
Director of Center for Research on Concepts and Cognition Douglas Hofstadter
signed copies of his bpok, dubbed "GED," last night.
Donald Kennedy, a former presi
dent of the University and the cur
rent editor-in-chief of Science Maga
zine, enumerated some of Hofs
tadter's honors and achievements in
his introduction. In 1979, Hofstadter
published "Godel, Escher, Bach: an
Eternal Golden Braid," (GEB) for
which he received the Pulitzer Prize
in 1980.
Currently a professor of Cogni
tive Science and the Director of the
Center for Research on Concepts
and Cognition at Indiana University,
Hofstadter sampled many disci
plines in his graduate and under
graduate career. He pursued a de
gree in mathematics and physics be
fore turning to his current field.
Monday's lecture featured the
concept of the analogy as the glue
between complex systems of lan
guage and human understanding of
those lingual representations. Hofs
tadter explained that analogy is just
"a perception of the common
essence between two things." He il
lustrated how an individual creates
an analogy or identifies a common
ality between two "categories," or
"circumstances that evoke a particu
lar primordial concept," through a
humorous example about his child
hood and observations of his infant
daughter Monica.
"When I was a child, I filled note
books with tables of integers raised
to various powers. I was fascinated
with the exponent," Hofstadter said.
He recalled inquiring about the sub
scripts written in one of his father's
notebooks. He said he remembered
feeling completely "flattened by" his
fathers answer that the subscripts
really didn't perform any mathemat
ical function.
Hofstadter linked this particular
sensation to a circumstance he wit
nessed years later.
"My daughter was playing with
the buttons on a hand-held vacuum
cleaner, and she discovered that one
of them didn't work," he said."When
I explained to her that one of the
buttons really didn't do anything, I
recalled my childhood moment of
disappointment."
Hofstadter presented a trans

parency that showed each corre
sponding part of the timelines
evoked an association. He conclud
ed that analogies "have no purpose
â€” they just happen. Their only pur
pose is to serve evolution."
The remaining portion of Hofs
tadter's lecture focused on the accu
mulation of analogies into increas
ingly complex concepts. He present
ed various lists of words, in modern
American vernacular, which might
only be defined by some sort of com
plex flow chart of more essential,
"primordial" concepts.
"How could you explain the con
cept of Wikipedia to someone who
lived a few centuries ago?" Hofs
tadter joked. "And yet, these are
concepts that we use and understand
very fluidly."
Finally, Hofstadter introduced
the idea of "word blends."
"We use analogy to judge
whether something is a member of a
category, or in other words, whether
to use that word or phrase," he said.
Word blends are common speech er
rors that he claims reveal the compe
tition between two or more applica
ble words or concepts.
Audience members character
ized Hofstadter's presentation as
sweeping.
Freshman Aaron Quiggle, an as
piring philosophy major, said he
"found the lecture entertaining and
funny."
"1 though he might go into more
detail however," he said. "There
seems like there could be another
reason for why words and language
are competing. He didn't give a solid
defense of his theory or say why we
should prioritize his explanation
over others."
Another listener, Gordon Cichon
of Santa Clara, said, "1 read the
[GEB], and it is definitely more so
phisticated than what I got from the
lecture. It takes you months to read
and understand. I really like Hofs
tadter's book because I think it is a
magnificent piece of art; however, I
personally think that the human
mind is not that easily understood.
We have been trying to simulate
analogy and human thought in com
puters for years and apparently the
mind doesn't work that way."
The lecture will be followed by a
question and answer session today at
4 p.m. at the Stanford Humanities
Center.
