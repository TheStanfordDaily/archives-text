## Smooth Waters WOMEN OPEN SEASON WITH BLOWOUT WIN Tigers fall to Cardinal in an embarrassing 17-2 match 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
The Cardinal's season opener against Pa
cific on Saturday certainly wasn't the most
thrilling game the Stanford women will play
this season. The Cardinal's eight goals in the
first period of play quickly removed all ques
tion as to the outcome of the game, which
Stanford water polo ultimately won by a 17-
2 margin.
Sophomore driver Jacquelyn Gauthier
led the offensive onslaught for No. 3 Stan
ford (1-0,1-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation) with a career-high four goals. Fresh
man driver Lauren Silver notched a hat-trick
in her first collegiate appearance, and eight
other Cardinal tallied goals in the game.
But what the Cardinal's matchup against
the Tigers lacked in excitement, it more than
made up for with the experience it offered
Stanford's younger players. All five Stanford
freshman — Silver, two-meter defender Jes
sica Steffens, driver Heather West, driver
Kira Hillman and driver Koree Blyleven —
received playing time in the contest.
"Seeing [them] out there for so many
minutes was really cool because they had
more of a chance to get all the nerves out,"
senior captain Laurel Champion said.
Silver, Steffens (two goals). Blyleven (one
goal) and Hillman (one goal) all got into the
scoring act while West contributed assists on
several scoring plays. Each of these individ
ual efforts gave Cardinal fans a reason for
optimism in future seasons.
"Our freshman are a bunch of extremely
athletic and enthusiastic girls." junior goalie
Meridith McColl said. "They bring a lot of
spirit to our team. Throughout the season,
they'll continue to develop their skills and
team play, but 'love of the game' is something
you can't teach, and they have it."
For the first three periods of the Cardinal's
season opener. McColl anchored a defensive
effort that limited Pacific's offense to just three

shots on goal and no scores. Junior Alison Gre
gorka filled in for McColl in the final period
and closed out an impressive defensive effort.
"It was an especially good way to start.be
cause it made everyone realize that we can
do a lot of good things." senior captain Scotti

Shafer said.
The Cardinal face much stiffer competi
tion this weekend as they host the 2006 Stan
ford Invitational. Set to come to Avery
Aquatics Center are undefeated 2005
NCAA champion UCLA. No. 2 Southern

California and several other top teams from
across the nation.
Despite finishing as runners-up in last
season's NCAA championship tournament.

Senior captain Laurel Champion expressed an appreciation for the Cardinal squad's freshman class. All five rookies saw time in the pool this past
weekend, and three of them scored goals in the rout over Pacific.
the Cardinal still feel a need to
prove themselves as legitimate title
contenders at this early point in the
season.
"We're going to be trying to estab
lish ourselves more than anything,"
Shafer said, in reference to the team's
goal for this weekend. "We need to
come out strong and put our foot
down to make sure we're the team
that people want to beat."
Having lost three key two-meter
players from last year's squad —
Hannah and Kelty Luber to gradua
tion and current senior Val Riss to a
shoulder injury —the upcoming
weekend affords the Cardinal the
opportunity to see how well their
game plan adjustments stack up
against the competition.
"So far there have been a lot of
players stepping it up in filling dif
ferent positions, so we may be post
ing up more now than we have in the
past," Champion said. "It's good to
see the really good teams early too,
so then our training revamps."
McColl emphasized that this first
step in the squad's hunt for the
NCAA title will be perhaps more
critical than any other.
"This weekend we want to set the
tone for the whole season," she said.
"Our team this year is characterized
by both a serious attitude of competi
tion and a passion for the sport, and
this weekend we want to apply this to
all aspects of the game."
