Hernandez, named Pac-10
Player of the Week
After his three game-saving free throws
against Washington a week ago Sunday, sen
ior point guard Chris Hernandez could have
been named Pac-10 Player of the Week, but
the honor instead went to senior center Matt
Haryasz.
However, following yet another two
clutch performances this past weekend,
there was no way Hernandez was going to be
denied again — and he wasn't.
With Haryasz injured for much of Satur
day's visit to Oregon State, Hernandez took
the scoring load on his shoulders, scoring 22

second-half points and 28 overall in a 71-64
win.The Fresno, Calif., native was a perfect 6-
for-6 at the foul line, extending his streak to
21 consecutive made free throws.
On Thursday night, Stanford won 57-56
thanks to Hernandez's NBA-length three
pointer with a defender in his face — and
just 11.3 seconds left. 1 le finished the night in

Eugene, Ore. with 20 points, including four
three-pointers.
Card crack Baseball America's top 25
Stanford is back in Baseball America's
national poll. After beginning the season un
ranked for the first time in the poll's history.
Cardinal baseball had quite a bit to prove
this weekend against CSU-Fullerton — and
they did.
A three-game sweep of the No. 5 Titans
did the job. Stanford's season-opening upset
over the Southern California powerhouse
puts the Cardinal at No. 19 this week. With 2-
1, 6-5 and 6-3 wins, Stanford showed it still

has a solid chance to reach the postseason,
despite losing five would-be-seniors this past
off-season, including two starting pitchers.
The freshman class played a key role in the
Titans' sweep.
Cross-country coach named Most
Outstanding of past 25 years
Stanford cross-country coach Peter Tegen
was named the outstanding NCAA Division
I women's coach of the past 25 years this
week by the U.S. Track and Field and Cross
Country Coaches Association. Tegen, who
just finished his first year as head
coach at Stanford, had previously
been at Wisconsin for 30 years.
The Stanford women won the
Pac-10, NCAA West Region and the
2005 NCAA Championship title
this past fall.
Women's Soccer signs
five for 2010
Five high school seniors have
signed letters of intent to play soccer
at Stanford next fall. The group of
three Californians, one Georgian
and a Virginian includes members of
the U.S. U-17 National Team, the U
-16 National Team and the 2005 Adi
das Cup U.S. Championship Team.
Stanford's most recent additions
— Alicia Jenkins, Kelly O'Hara, Ali
Riley, Katie Riley and Kristin Stan
nard — replace six departing sen
iors. They join a Stanford team that
went 10-7-3 last season and reached
the first round of the NCAA Tour
nament.
