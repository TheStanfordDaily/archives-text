Hernandez, named Pac-10
Player of the Week
After his three game-saving free throws
against Washington a week ago Sunday, sen
ior point guard Chris Hernandez could have
been named Pac-10 Player of the Week, but
the honor instead went to senior center Matt
Haryasz.
However, following yet another two
clutch performances this past weekend,
there was no way Hernandez was going to be
denied again — and he wasn't.
With Haryasz injured for much of Satur
day's visit to Oregon State, Hernandez took
the scoring load on his shoulders, scoring 22

second-half points and 28 overall in a 71-64
win.The Fresno, Calif., native was a perfect 6-
for-6 at the foul line, extending his streak to
21 consecutive made free throws.
On Thursday night, Stanford won 57-56
thanks to Hernandez's NBA-length three
pointer with a defender in his face — and
just 11.3 seconds left. 1 le finished the night in

Eugene, Ore. with 20 points, including four
three-pointers.
Card crack Baseball America's top 25
Stanford is back in Baseball America's
national poll. After beginning the season un
ranked for the first time in the poll's history.
Cardinal baseball had quite a bit to prove
this weekend against CSU-Fullerton — and
they did.
A three-game sweep of the No. 5 Titans
did the job. Stanford's season-opening upset
over the Southern California powerhouse
puts the Cardinal at No. 19 this week. With 2-
1, 6-5 and 6-3 wins, Stanford showed it still

has a solid chance to reach the postseason,
despite losing five would-be-seniors this past
off-season, including two starting pitchers.
The freshman class played a key role in the
Titans' sweep.
