The smell of freshly-cut grass.
The salty taste of sunflower
seeds or peanuts — whichev
er you prefer. The sound made as
wood makes contact with the
leather ball.
Nothing epitomizes the United
States like baseball. Americans are
brought up attending games with
their families and belting out lyrics
to "Take Me Out to the Ballgame."
And with the inaugural World
Baseball Classic just weeks away,
the U.S. will finally be afforded the
opportunity to send its profession
al athletes to compete on an inter
national stage.
March's WBC features 16 coun
tries competing in a World Cup-like
tournament at sites scattered
throughout the world. Four of the
sites are in the States (Orlando,
Phoenix, Anaheim and San Diego)

friends and I packed into our cars
and impatiently survived the
hoard of traffic all the way up to
the city.
As I draped myself in the Mexi
can flag and joined in the endless
chorus of "Mexico, ra-ra-ra!" I felt
something 1 had never felt before.
For the first time in my life. I consid
ered myself part of the greater cause
— part of a nation. None of my pre
vious trips to Dodger Stadium, the
Staples Center or even our beloved
Maples Pavilion have provided me
with a similar atmosphere of noise
and flare.
The countless flags waving
throughout the crowd, the sound of
horns being blown and the undying
