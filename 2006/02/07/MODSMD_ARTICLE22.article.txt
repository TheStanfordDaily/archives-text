# A 						Dose of 'Truf'
## The 						lessons of 'Viva Mexico' 
### ANDY LOMELI SPORTS COLUMNIST 
The smell of freshly-cut grass.
The salty taste of sunflower
seeds or peanuts — whichev
er you prefer. The sound made as
wood makes contact with the
leather ball.
Nothing epitomizes the United
States like baseball. Americans are
brought up attending games with
their families and belting out lyrics
to "Take Me Out to the Ballgame."
And with the inaugural World
Baseball Classic just weeks away,
the U.S. will finally be afforded the
opportunity to send its profession
al athletes to compete on an inter
national stage.
March's WBC features 16 coun
tries competing in a World Cup-like
tournament at sites scattered
throughout the world. Four of the
sites are in the States (Orlando,
Phoenix, Anaheim and San Diego)
host the tourney's final two rounds.
With the States' claim to base
ball as its "national pastime" on the
line, the country cannot allow a re
peat of the ill-fated 2004 basketball
Dream Team, a squad that was
lucky to grab a bronze at the
Olympics. While I'm certain super
stars such as Alex Rodriguez. Mark
Teixeira and Roger Clemens will
do their part to secure the U.S.'s
dominance on the diamond, most
of the nation's pride will rest in the
hands of those who carry the
sport's popularity today: the na
tion's fans.
Two weeks ago, I had the privi
lege of attending a Mexico-Nor
way soccer game at Monster Park
in San Francisco. What 1 experi
enced that evening would forever
change my perception of a fan's
dedication to a team.
Decked out in green jerseys and
carrying a giant Mexican flag, my
friends and I packed into our cars
and impatiently survived the
hoard of traffic all the way up to
the city.
As I draped myself in the Mexi
can flag and joined in the endless
chorus of "Mexico, ra-ra-ra!" I felt
something 1 had never felt before.
For the first time in my life. I consid
ered myself part of the greater cause
— part of a nation. None of my pre
vious trips to Dodger Stadium, the
Staples Center or even our beloved
Maples Pavilion have provided me
with a similar atmosphere of noise
and flare.
The countless flags waving
throughout the crowd, the sound of
horns being blown and the undying
loyalty of a nation to its sport —
soccer's equivalent of the sights and
sounds that bring spirit to baseball
— provided an experience words
cannot describe.
When a Mexican offensive line
man's kick came within inches of
scoring a goal, fans throughout the
stadium applauded the effort and
shouted encouraging words. In
contrast, when Indianapolis Colts
kicker Mike Vanderjagt missed a
game-tying field goal against the
Steelers in the AFC playoffs a few
weeks ago, Colts fans (such as my
self) weren't exactly offering
words of encouragement. From the
RCA Dome to Stern Dining, we
threw a collective temper tantrum.
I long considered myself a dedi
cated Mexican soccer fan, but now
1 know I was wrong. I was also
wrong about my so-called loyalty
to the Dodgers and the Cardinal.
Soccer is more than just a sport in
Mexico; it's a way of life.
And so I wonder whether
American fans will be able to hold
up their end of the bargain come
March. After being entertained by
these athletes for years, fans will
owe it to their idols to fill the seats
at Angel Stadium and Petco Park,
carrying American flags and wear
ing red, white and blue.
The U.S.'s boast to a unique con
nection to baseball will be tested,
especially by a powerful Domini
can Republic roster that features
Vlad Guerrero, Albert Pujols,
David Ortiz and American League
C'y Young winner Bartolo Colon.
Our duty as Americans will be
to take pride in what we are about
to witness. While Barry Bonds and
Gary Sheffield may not feel the re
sponsibility to represent the Unit
ed States, many national icons will
take the field with the sense of
being part of a greater cause.

I will be there when they hoist
up that WBC trophy, screaming at
the top of my lungs. I would suggest
that this nation's baseball fans take
a lesson from the rest of the world
and prove their true love for game
and country.
