# TRACK & FIELD
## Invite produces NCAA qualifiers Chauntae Bayne sets school record of 23.50 seconds in 200 meters 
### ISRAEL ROJAS 
With a solid weekend at the Frank Sevigne Husker Invita
tional, the Stanford track team continued to qualify athletes
for the NCAA championships. In particular, the Cardinal
sprint unit came out and showed glimpses of just how domi
nant it can be.
Sophomore Chauntae Bayne had a spectacular Saturday,
setting a school-record in the 2(X) meters and winning the 60
meters to boot.
Bayne's time of 23.50 seconds in the 200 meters broke the
old record of junior Janice Davis and was also an NCAA pro
visional qualifying effort. For her efforts, Bayne was named
the women's 2006 Most Outstanding Performer.
Junior Jakki Bailey also etched her name in the school
record book this weekend, placing third in the 200 meters
with a career-best time of 24.02 seconds, fourth-fastest ever in
Stanford history.
On Friday, Davis managed to tie her school record in the
60 meters, but she could not repeat her success on Saturday,
as she finished fourth behind Bayne, Bailey and Nebraska's
Priscilla Lopes.
The trio of Bailey, Bayne and Davis gives Stanford a unit
capable of sweeping sprint events. The trio owns the school's
top three times in the 60 meters and has three of the top four
times in the 200 meters.
Meanwhile, freshman Lauren Stewart took first in the
triple jump event with a jump of 41-3 3/4 feet, third-best in
school history. Sophomore Erica McLain — the school
record holder in the triple jump — did not
compete in the event.
Tlie Cardinal men, however, did not enjoy
as much success as the women. The men fin
ished the weekend with only one victory, as
sophomore Graeme Hoste finished first in the
pole vault competition.
Hoste's winning vault of 17-7 3/4 feet was
more than seven inches better than his previ-

ous best, which
he achieved last
weekend. Hoste
now owns the
second-best
height, in Stan
ford's record
books.
Sophomore
Wopanio Osaisai
tied his own
school record of
6.83 in the 60 me
ters, mirroring
Davis' feat. While
Osaisai was con
tent with hitting
his personal
record, he still
was not fully sat
isfied.
"I feel like I've
been under
achieving," Osai
sai said, citing a
lack of familiarity
with indoor
track. "A lot of
guys didn't get to

"I feel like
I've been
underachieving...

you can hit times but haven't, for whatever rea
son."
(Jsaisai says he is looking forward to the
outdoor season, where he will again have the
opportunity to run the 100 meters, a distance
better tailored to his running style.
This weekend's invitational fulfilled its pur
pose of qualifying athletes for NCA As. Twen
ty-six provisional-qualifying marks were post
ed, in addition to four automatic marks, five
meet records, three facility records and one
new collegiate standard in the 1,000 meters, set

by Kansas State's Christian Smith.
Up next for the Cardinal is the Arkansas
Tyson Team Invitational. It will he the first time
Stanford competes in a scored meet this year.
Tyson, the meat giant, is offering $25,000 to
any professional athlete who breaks a world

record this coming weekend. NCAA rules bar
collegiate athletes from accepting such an
award.
With the large financial incentive, profes
sional athletes from around the world will like
ly be making appearances. The professional

portion of the invitational will be held on Fri
day evening with the collegiate portion held
mainly on Saturday.
Students who wish to see the Cardinal in ac
tion will be able to do so on Sunday when the
meet is televised on ESPN2.
