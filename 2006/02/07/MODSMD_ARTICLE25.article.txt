# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Tigers dominate in Card's error-filled match 'We have a chance to make something happen, and we give it away.' 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
After three tough losses earlier in the season,
Stanford men's volleyball was looking for re
demption against Pacific on Friday.They will have
to keep looking.
The Cardinal dominated in the third game, hit
ting nearly .500 as a team, but were plagued by er
rors in the rest of the match, falling 3-1 (30-25,30-
22.23-30,30-23) on Friday.
UOP (3-7,2-5 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) out-hit, out-blocked, out-served and out-dug
the Cardinal (2-9,1-6) en route to an easy victory
in the first half of a home-and-away series, which
will wrap up on Wednesday. The Stanford front
line had only a single error in the third game but
made 14 unforced errors in the rest of the match,
hitting into the net or out of bounds.
"Fundamentally, we arc not getting the job
done,'' head coach Don Shaw said. "It comes down
to fundamentals and our skills are not good
enough right now. If we can serve and pass well, it
changes everything."
Senior opposite Ben Reddy led with 13 kills
and a team-high four service aces. Senior middle
blocker Chris Ahlfeldt chipped in 12 kills and five
blocks to lead the Cardinal on defense. Senior set
ter Jeremy Jacobs dished out 36 assists and junior
libero Brian Lindberg anchored the back row with
nine digs.
Pacific's right side hitter Brian Adamson tallied
21 kills on match-high .415 hitting.
"Adamson had way too big of a night," Shaw
said. "We did not do a good job defending him and
that really made the difference. Their outside hit
ters were not controlling the match — we did an
okay job on them."
In addition to unforced errors, Shaw pointed to
the Cardinal's passing and serving as an area
where they desperately need to improve.
" That's the magic formula," he said."lf you can
serve and pass well, you have a chance to win. It
changes everything."
Stanford recorded six service aces, and four of
them came in the third game. Pacific's Andreas
Baboulidis also had six, pacing the Tigers who tal
lied 15 in the match.The digging stats were closer,
with UOP holding a 42-37 edge.
The first game was a roller-coaster, with Stan
ford coming back from a 12-2 deficit to nearly tie.
But after a dig kept the ball alive, the Cardinal hit
the ball out. handing the Tigers the point and the
momentum. UOP closed out the 30-25 win with a
kill by Baboulidis.
"We were coming back and dominating in most
of that game," Shaw said. "But then we hit it out of
bounds. That's been our problem — we have a
chance to make something happen and we give it
away. We shoot ourselves in the foot."
In the second game, neither team could string
together more than four points, but Pacific's short
runs added up to a 30-22 win. In the middle of the
game, the Tigers pushed a four-point lead to seven
at the service line. The teams were trading points
in the last minutes of the game but the Cardinal
could not overcome a deficit which had slowly bal
looned to 10.
After the break, the Cardinal got tough. Trail
ing 10-5. Stanford reeled off eight points with
Reddy serving. He powered down three consecu
tive aces during the run while the Tigers' offense
faltered with three straight hitting errors.
Moments later, the Cardinal went on a seven
point run with senior outside hitter Will Clayton at
the line. Stanford rolled to the 30-23 victory, hit
ting .480 to Pacific's .184 in the game. It was the
only game in which Stanford hitters broke .KM).
"We needed to bounce back and we did that,"

The Cardinal squad dropped to 2-9 and 1 -6 in the MPSF conference on Friday. Though Stanford played
a solid third game, it's defense could not keep up with Pacific's Brian Adams.
Shaw said. "We proved that we can
hit over .400. We just have not been
able to do that for a whole match."
The Cardinal had the chance to
tie the match and force a fifth game
but could not hold onto their third
game momentum.They dropped the
game 30-23 on their worst hitting of
the night, barely managing a posi
tive percentage.
Stanford gets one more chance at
the Tigers on Wednesday night in
Burnham Pavilion before heading

The Cardinal squad dropped to 2-9 and 1 -6 in the MPSF conference on Friday. Though Stanford played
a solid third game, it's defense could not keep up with Pacific's Brian Adams.
Shaw said. "We proved that we can
hit over .400. We just have not been
able to do that for a whole match."
The Cardinal had the chance to
tie the match and force a fifth game
but could not hold onto their third
game momentum.They dropped the
game 30-23 on their worst hitting of
the night, barely managing a posi
tive percentage.
Stanford gets one more chance at
the Tigers on Wednesday night in
Burnham Pavilion before heading
east for a weekend tournament in
Massachusetts.
