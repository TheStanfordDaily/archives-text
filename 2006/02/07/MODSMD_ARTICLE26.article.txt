## Women move past Bears, ready for ASU 
### JUSTINA KAMIEL GRAYMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
How many unpointed toes, misses on bars, falls
on floor and slips on beam can allow a team to win
by over three points? The answer, as California
found out Friday night, is far too many.
Stanford trumped the No. 35 Golden Bears
195.925-192.150 in Bears' territory, as then-No. 13
Cardinal dominated the meet. Stanford earned the
top two places in every event and the top three in
vault and floor.
"The team showed signs of greatness," head
coach Kristen Smyth said. "It was the first great
team effort."
That Stanford won uneven bars was no big sur
prise. but the team struggled on its first rotation,
enduring three misses. Sophomore LizTricase, un
defeated in bars this season, confirmed her consis
tency in the event with a huge 9.925 in the event.
"I think one thing we can try to improve on is
building up our hit routines," said Tricase. "A lot
times we'll start out strong, then we have a miss or
break in the lineup."
Stanford sophomore Tabitha Yim and Cal
freshman Lydia Williams shared the bars runner
up position (9.8). Cal's Joanna Bennett was not far
behind with a career-high 9.775.
Vault was the turning-point of the meet.
Senior Natalie began the rotation with a stuck
layout yurchenko full. Four of the six competing
gymnasts stuck their vault landings but senior Glyn
Sweets and sophomore Alex Pintchouk earned
second (9.9) and third place (9.875), respectively,
for the Cardinal. Tricase's 9.95 was strong enough
to earn her the vault title, and vault turned out to be
the meet's turning point. After this event, the mood
was intense.
"You could just feel the energy building,"
Smyth said
Stanford's floor exercise lineup was highlighted
by freshman Nicole Ourada, who performed a full
in to clinch victory with a career-best of 9.9.
Stanford's Tricase — who was competing for
the first time this season on floor — and Yim both
scored 9.875 to tie for second. Pintchouk per
formed her routine with new first and last passes.
Foley, a usual in the Cardinal balance beam line
up. was absent due to soreness in her feet, but fresh
man Heather Purnell set a positive tone. Ultimate
ly, though. Yim came out on top with her first win
of the night (9.875).
Ourada earned second on beam with another
career-best of 9.825 and a challenging back hand
spring-layout-layout series.
The all-around was close within the Cardinal
squad. Yim scored only .025 points above Ourada
to win the all-around competition; 39.3-39.275.
Yim, however, had no praise for her all-around per
formance.
"I don't focus much on all-around performanc
es," she said."We got the best team score we've had
all year, and I was really happy about that."
Cal's Kelley scored 38.55 to place third in the
all-around while teammate Siobhan Luce had a
season-high score of 38.5.
Meanwhile, Stanford's new team-high had pos
itive implications for the squad.
"It confirmed to our team that we can reach our
performance goals." Smith said. "We're a formida
ble team against anybody."
Stanford will need a similarly high level of per

formance this weekend, as it clashes with the
league leaders. No. 10 Arizona State's young squad
has proven to be a fast-learning hunch, jumping
from a first meet total of 193.15 to a high of 196.1
last Friday against Utah. The team ranks first in the
Pac-10.
Stanford, on the other hand, is a veteran squad
that ranks third in the conference. Depth is also a
factor on Stanford's side. Sophomore Stephanie
Gentry and sophomore Lauren Elmore look to
come back within the next few weeks, and fresh
man Heather Purncll (recovering from knee in
jury) is also near-ready to add more events to her
performance.
"Everyone is going to be sore, but we're doing a

good job of trying to manage the girls' bodies,"
Symth said.
Stanford is ranked higher than ASU in vault
and bars and lower in beam and floor but the dif
ferences in averages are slim — with the exception
of beam, where Stanford will have to surprise this
top-ranked team to take the event.
The Sun Devils' all-around lineup has also been
more successful than the Cardinal's. Despite the
tall odds, Stanford believes the outcome is within
its control.
"Our biggest problem is not performing the
way we do in practice," Sweets said. "We've logged
the numbers and it's just a matter of doing that in
meets."

After performing well across all events in Berkeley, the Stanford women continue facing Pac-10 compe

prise. but the team struggled on its first rotation,
enduring three misses. Sophomore LizTricase, un
defeated in bars this season, confirmed her consis
tency in the event with a huge 9.925 in the event.
"I think one thing we can try to improve on is
building up our hit routines," said Tricase. "A lot
times we'll start out strong, then we have a miss or
break in the lineup."
Stanford sophomore Tabitha Yim and Cal
freshman Lydia Williams shared the bars runner
up position (9.8). Cal's Joanna Bennett was not far
behind with a career-high 9.775.
Vault was the turning-point of the meet.
Senior Natalie began the rotation with a stuck
layout yurchenko full. Four of the six competing
gymnasts stuck their vault landings but senior Glyn
Sweets and sophomore Alex Pintchouk earned
second (9.9) and third place (9.875), respectively,
for the Cardinal. Tricase's 9.95 was strong enough
to earn her the vault title, and vault turned out to be
the meet's turning point. After this event, the mood
was intense.
"You could just feel the energy building,"
Smyth said
Stanford's floor exercise lineup was highlighted
by freshman Nicole Ourada, who performed a full
in to clinch victory with a career-best of 9.9.
Stanford's Tricase — who was competing for
the first time this season on floor — and Yim both
scored 9.875 to tie for second. Pintchouk per
formed her routine with new first and last passes.
Foley, a usual in the Cardinal balance beam line
up. was absent due to soreness in her feet, but fresh
man Heather Purnell set a positive tone. Ultimate
ly, though. Yim came out on top with her first win
of the night (9.875).
Ourada earned second on beam with another
career-best of 9.825 and a challenging back hand
spring-layout-layout series.
The all-around was close within the Cardinal
squad. Yim scored only .025 points above Ourada
to win the all-around competition; 39.3-39.275.
Yim, however, had no praise for her all-around per
formance.
"I don't focus much on all-around performanc
es," she said."We got the best team score we've had
all year, and I was really happy about that."
Cal's Kelley scored 38.55 to place third in the
all-around while teammate Siobhan Luce had a
season-high score of 38.5.
Meanwhile, Stanford's new team-high had pos
itive implications for the squad.
"It confirmed to our team that we can reach our
performance goals." Smith said. "We're a formida
ble team against anybody."
Stanford will need a similarly high level of per

formance this weekend, as it clashes with the
league leaders. No. 10 Arizona State's young squad
has proven to be a fast-learning hunch, jumping
from a first meet total of 193.15 to a high of 196.1
last Friday against Utah. The team ranks first in the
Pac-10.
Stanford, on the other hand, is a veteran squad
that ranks third in the conference. Depth is also a
factor on Stanford's side. Sophomore Stephanie
Gentry and sophomore Lauren Elmore look to
come back within the next few weeks, and fresh
man Heather Purncll (recovering from knee in
jury) is also near-ready to add more events to her
performance.
"Everyone is going to be sore, but we're doing a

good job of trying to manage the girls' bodies,"
Symth said.
Stanford is ranked higher than ASU in vault
and bars and lower in beam and floor but the dif
ferences in averages are slim — with the exception
of beam, where Stanford will have to surprise this
top-ranked team to take the event.
The Sun Devils' all-around lineup has also been
more successful than the Cardinal's. Despite the
tall odds, Stanford believes the outcome is within
its control.
"Our biggest problem is not performing the
way we do in practice," Sweets said. "We've logged
the numbers and it's just a matter of doing that in
meets."
