# SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING
## Undefeated Stanford beats Florida teams Weekend tests in the Sunshine State prepare women for upcoming Stanford Invitational 
### JOHN CHOCK 
This past weekend saw Stanford
synchro swimming (4-0) add two
more wins to the team's unbeaten
record, as the Cardinal defeated
Florida State 88-28 on Friday and
Florida 100-87 on Saturday. The vic
tories tested the team's mettle in a
whirlwind tour of the Sunshine State.
"This past weekend was one of
our most challenging this season,"
sophomore captain Sara Lowe said.
"We had a competition on Friday
evening as soon as we flew in and an
other Saturday morning after wak
ing up and driving for three hours."
Compounding that challenge was
the absence of sophomore Poppy
Carlig, who missed the meets to train
with the national team in Colorado.
"Poppy is not only a key member
in our team routine but she also com
petes in a trio and a duet, which
meant we had to change some of our
routines," Lowe said. "1 think every
one gave an extra effort to make up
for Poppy's absence."
Whether due to extra effort, or
simply better talent, Stanford pulled
off a clean sweep of all four events on
both days.
Stanford's trio of sophomore
Courtenay Stewart and juniors Eliza
beth Anne Markman and Samantha
Bongiovanni-Duclos beat the Semi
noles in Tallahassee, and Stewart and
Lowe swam to gold in the duet. Lowe
and Bongiovanni-Duclos recorded
first- and second-place swims in the
solo competition, and the Cardinal
claimed victory in the team program
as well, with a score of 91.0.
The next day's meet at Florida's
O'Connell Natatorium in
Gainesville, Fla. saw Stanford per
form to almost identical results. Lowe
and Stewart earned a 92.5 in the duet.

and the Cardinal improved to 92.0 in
the team program.
"With each competition our team
gets stronger and puts better swims in
the water," Lowe said. "Florida was
definitely not an exception. Although
we still have things to work on, we
were all very happy with the way our
routines looked."
"I felt the team had a very solid
performance," assistant coach Shan
non Montague added. "They are on
the right track to secure the overall
collegiate title."
The path to a second consecutive
title has wound through Hawaii,
Texas and Florida thus far. and this
weekend the Cardinal bring it back to
the Avery Aquatics Center, where
they are scheduled to compete in the
Stanford Invitational on Saturday at
4 p.m.
A local rival squad, the Santa
Clara Aquamaids, will likely be in the
stands alongside the home crowd
scoping out the Cardinal routine.
"The top team in the country and
our main competition [for the na
tional club title] practices 20 minutes
away," Lowe said. "We know that
many of them will probably be com
ing to this meet. We need to be strong
and put good swims in the water."
Another team with its eyes on the
Cardinal is national powerhouse
Ohio State, which swims at Rich
mond, Va., this weekend. The Buck
eyes lost their five-year lock on the
national collegiate title to Stanford
last year.
This season. Ohio State boasts a
perfect record and a roster twice the
size of Stanford's, and with All-Amer
ican Becky Kim, two Canadian
Olympians and a freshman from the
Brazilian National Team, the Buck
eyes could easily challenge the Cardi
nal for the collegiate championship,
which is set for Mar. 23-25 at Stanford.
"I am very excited Stanford is
hosting the Collegiate Nationals this
year," Stanford head coach Heather
Olson said, acknowledging Stan
ford's investment in a sport that is still
considered "emerging" by the
NCAA.'it is really something for the
Stanford community to see."
