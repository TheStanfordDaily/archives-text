## Apple, Bookstore join forces Bookstore works with Apple to establish new Dorm Rep program 
### DAISY CHUNG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Bookstore and Apple are launch
ing a joint grassroots program to encourage aware
ness and spread the word about Apple products.
About 15 students attended the first informational
meeting about the Apple Dorm Reps program at
the Bookstore yesterday evening.
"This was an idea that was created and proposed
by the student Apple Reps already on campus, so
you could say that it was created by students, for stu
dents," said Ken Bowers, Director of Stores for Fol
lett, who owns the Stanford Bookstore.
"They thought that it would be much easier to
educate their fellow students about Apple products
in a more peer-to-peer context." Bowers added.
Supporters say the program utilizes the savvy of
current Apple product enthusiasts to educate new
users on campus.
"With our objective of getting more information
out to the student body, particularly the student dis
count on Apple computers, we came up with the
idea of having Dorm Reps at Stanford," said junior
Jeff Orlowski. one of four Apple campus reps.
The Apple campus reps have previously teamed
with student organizations such as FliCKs and
Dance Marathon, providing sponsorship and prizes.
"We tailored the program around Stanford's res
idential environment," Orlowski said. "We are re
cruiting undergraduate and graduate students to
represent Apple in their dorm, and to help inform
them of special discounts and deals on Apple prod
ucts available at the Stanford Bookstore."
According to Bowers, the program will help rem
edy the lack of Apple-savvy students on campus.

"The Bookstore computer department is fre
quently overwhelmed with students who want to
ask questions about Apple products," he said. "This
seems like a great way to educate students about
new features and the evolutionary changes in Apple
products."
The program has loosely defined the representa
tives' responsibilities and attributes, according to
organizers.
"Student participants at the Apple Student Rep
program will probably be Apple users and will cer
tainly be able to answer most questions about
Apple that they would likely get from fellow stu
dents," said Bowers.
"Reps, who will go through training and make a
visit to the Apple campus, will receive special dis
counts on Apple products and earn rewards based
on the number of students they refer to the Book
store," Orlowski told prospective Dorm Reps. "We
will supply Reps with business cards that also func
tion as vouchers for a free gift from the Bookstore
with the purchase of certain Apple products. When
students redeem these vouchers, the Bookstore will
know which Rep they talked to."
Students who attended the talk received applica
tions on the spot.The applications are also available
online.
Students and Apple enthusiasts in attendance
expressed excitement about the program
"I've been born and raised Apple,and I think this
is a really cool program," said junior Lisa Love. "I'm
not really a techie by any means. My usual method
of fixing things is to unplug them and then plug
them back in. But I think I would really enjoy talk
ing about Apple products."
"I feel like I'm an Apple Rep already," said Dan
McGarry, a graduate student in the history depart
ment, after handing in his completed application
"I've told a number of friends how much Macs help
my work. [Being a Dorm Rep] wouldn't be very dif
ferent."
