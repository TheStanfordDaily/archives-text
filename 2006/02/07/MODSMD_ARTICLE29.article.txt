## Palo Alto establishes tourism board City Council votes to create board to innovate attractions, encourage tourism from non-Stanford visitors 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
Last night, the Palo Alto City Council passed a measure
that effectively created a tourism board for the city. The
board, which consists of representatives from businesses
that stand to gain from an increase in tourism, like stake
holders, will investigate ways to entice tourism to Palo Alto.
The motion was labeled in the meeting's minutes as a
movement to "Authorize the City Manager to Appoint a
Committee of Stakeholders to Explore Opportunities to
Enhance Palo Alto's Economy by improving Visitor Out
reach and Benefit from Local Tourism, Including Develop
ing Recommendations and a Prioritized Action Plan" and
it passed unanimously.
"We don't have a problem with a lack of tourism, but
what we know is that we've had more in the past and that
our hotels and restaurants should be given a chance to do
as well as they can," said councilmember Bern Beecham,
one of the driving forces behind the motion. "We hope we
can find out [what will improve tourism] in the stakeholder
meeting, which includes representatives from certain ho
tels and people from the downtown area, in particular some
of the more notable restaurants, and we also hope that
there will be someone from Stanford there as well."
The City Council plans seek collaboration with the Uni
versity in encouraging tourism, Beecham said.
"Stanford has many attractions and is certainly one of
Palo Alto's strongest assets," he said. "We'd like to work
with [the University] as well to find out how we can im
prove coordination and communication."
Stanford plays a large role in the City's plan for drawing
not only tourists, but visiting families of students as well.
"For students, [this board] should make services we have
available here in town more visible to their visitors, like vis
iting families, for example," said Beecham. "They'll know
where they can stay, what activities are available, things of
that nature."
Other city councilmembers agreed.
"Tourism in Palo Alto has generally been a function of
Stanford parents, the Stanford Industrial Park and the
Stanford Hospital and the Medical Center," said coun
cilmember Jack Morton. "In the heyday of foreign tourism,
the [Stanford] Shopping Center was a tour stop for the City
but I'm not sure it is still the attraction that it was five or six
years ago.
"When a community loses a major revenue contributor
like Ricky's Hyatt, you have to try to think of something
that might get additional revenue," he added."lf Four Sea
sons thinks Bayshore is ideal for a four-star hotel. I guess
there might be more to University Avenue than some of us
thought."
In a memorandum released last October bv Vice Mayor
Judy Kleinberg and councilmembers Beecham and Dena
Mossar, the city laid down its plans to "Enhance Palo Alto's
Economy by Improving Visitor Outreach."
"Palo Alto is a destination community for many visitors
each year," stated the memorandum, from the Office of the
City Clerk. "Additionally, our community has many hotels,
restaurants, museums, arts and programs, recreational op
portunities, personal services, and great places to shop. To
date, no organized effort has been made to access the num
bers of annual visitors, their destination, and interests of the
possibility of enhancing Palo Alto's economy by marketing
services and products to these individuals. Therefore, we
ask our colleagues to direct staff to agendize a council dis
cussion of these issues and the possible formation of an ad
hoc committee to explore opportunities to benefit from
local tourism. This committee could include stakeholders
from the business, residential and non-profit communities."
The proposed committee would have three duties. The
first is to identify and prioritize different methods for mak
ing Palo Alto more visible for visitors, including the possi
ble creation of publications, information kiosks, maps or a
visitor's bureau. Second, the committee could explore pub
lic and private partnerships in order to organize and oper
ate visitor services. And lastly, the stakeholders will be able
to identify possible sources of funding to sustain identified
visitor services which might include extra fees, the city of
Palo Alto or other organizations.
"I suspect that my colleagues will support the idea [of a
new tourism program]," said Beecham. "It will help us im
prove our cities' budget bottom line and help us increase
our revenues."
Other councilmembers expressed caution, however ec
centric.
"I think the item will pass because so far it is not costing
anything," said Morton. "But I am not holding out a lot of
hope that [non-Stanford associated] tourists will suddenly
think that Palo Alto is the destination for their next spring
time vacation, although birding on the Bay is one of the
world class sights we do have to offer. But birders are gen
erally a thrifty lot."
