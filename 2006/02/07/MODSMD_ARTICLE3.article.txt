### ROBBIE YAN 
In the midst of global controversy surrounding Google's agree
ment with China to censor its google.cn resuls, one of the leaders
of Google's Chinese operations visited campus last weekend.
Kai-Fu Lee, co-president of Google's operations in China and
internationally recognized expert in speech recognition, paid a
visit to the student-run Association of Chinese Students and
Scholars at Stanford (ACSSS) Saturday, urging students to "pur
sue where [their] hearts lead [them]."
Lee, who has taught at Carnegie Mellon University,established
Microsoft Research China in 1998. Last July, his decision to join
Google as president of its China operations led to a lawsuit from
Microsoft accusing him of violating a non-competition agreement.
Microsoft and Google eventually settled on confidential terms in
December. Lee has also published numerous articles and deliv
ered speeches regarding the Chinese educational system.
Delivering his talk to an audience of about 250 people at the
Graduate Community Center (GCC), Lee divided his presenta
tion into two sections. In the first, titled "Wisdom of Choice," he
listed the identification of one's passion and careful reasoning as
key steps to making wise decisions. He also addressed various top
ics on management and technology, backing up his perspectives
and opinions with personal anecdotes. In the second section, Lee
reviewed the progress of Google's operations in China from last
August to the present.
