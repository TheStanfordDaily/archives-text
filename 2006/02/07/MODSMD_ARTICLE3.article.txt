## Head of China Google speaks on spotlight Lee has drawn fire from media for agreeing with Chinese government to censor content 
### ROBBIE YAN 
In the midst of global controversy surrounding Google's agree
ment with China to censor its google.cn resuls, one of the leaders
of Google's Chinese operations visited campus last weekend.
Kai-Fu Lee, co-president of Google's operations in China and
internationally recognized expert in speech recognition, paid a
visit to the student-run Association of Chinese Students and
Scholars at Stanford (ACSSS) Saturday, urging students to "pur
sue where [their] hearts lead [them]."
Lee, who has taught at Carnegie Mellon University,established
Microsoft Research China in 1998. Last July, his decision to join
Google as president of its China operations led to a lawsuit from
Microsoft accusing him of violating a non-competition agreement.
Microsoft and Google eventually settled on confidential terms in
December. Lee has also published numerous articles and deliv
ered speeches regarding the Chinese educational system.
Delivering his talk to an audience of about 250 people at the
Graduate Community Center (GCC), Lee divided his presenta
tion into two sections. In the first, titled "Wisdom of Choice," he
listed the identification of one's passion and careful reasoning as
key steps to making wise decisions. He also addressed various top
ics on management and technology, backing up his perspectives
and opinions with personal anecdotes. In the second section, Lee
reviewed the progress of Google's operations in China from last
August to the present.
Lee began his discussion on the
topics of aspiration and passion, in
particular the concept of "making a
difference," with a mental exercise.
"Imagine a world with you, and
another identical world without
you," he said. "The difference be
tween these two worlds is the differ
ence that you have made."
Lee listed four criteria warranti
ng consideration in career path se
lection: passion, talent, learning and
reward. A so-called "sweet spot" is
reached if a job fits all four criteria,
he said. He advised students to think
through situations thoroughly and
patiently.
Lee recalled that while at Mi
crosoft, he decided to relocate to
China in order to establish the soft
ware giant's first research center in
Asia. At the time, despite discourag
ing remarks from friends and col
leagues about his prospects, Lee re
membered saying, "'Maybe the
chance of making Microsoft Re
search-China the best research cen
ter in Asia is slim. But the worst case
scenario would be making Mi
crosoft Research-China the best re
search center in China. 1 can accept
that worst case.'"
Having served in senior manage
ment posts at Silicon Graphics,
Apple, Microsoft and Google, Lee
informed the audience of various
gimmicks about leadership and
management. On making choices in
a quagmire, for instance, he intro
duced a method that he termed the
"newspaper-testing method."
"Suppose that you have to make
a choice between two decisions, nei

ther of which yields a pleasant out
come," he said. "You can decide by
imagining your decision being pub
lished in the newspaper the next
day. If you are happier with one de
cision published than [you are with]
the other, go with the former."
Lee also suggested that making a
good choice sometimes means giv
ing up what one has already estab
lished. Such a move, although
painful in the short run, will prove
wise in the long term, he said.
Lee cited several examples in his
life where relinquishment resulted
in eventual success. As an under
graduate at Columbia University, he
dropped law studies, one of the most
popular concentrations at the time,
to pursue his passion in computer
science. During his doctoral pro
gram at Carnegie Mellon, Lee
steered away from expert systems,
then a dominant paradigm in artifi
cial intelligence, and designed the
world's first statistical-learning
based, speaker-independent and
continuous speech recognition sys
tem, eventually bringing a recogni
tion rate of 40 percent to % percent.
After achieving professorship at
Carnegie Mellon, Lee decided to
join the industry in order to "make a
larger impact." He advised an ap
preciative audience that "you will
need to get off your local maximum
to reach a global maximum."
In the last half-hour, he followed
with a report on the tremendous
â€¢growth of users and employees of
Google China in the past six
montns.
"We welcome all that are inter
ested in technology and leadership
opportunities in China to join us,"
he said, to applause.
A contingent of protesters con
demning Google's agreement with
the Chinese government picketed
outside the GCC during the talk.
