# A 						Question of Honor
## FACULTY DEFEND PEN-ONLY POLICY DESPITE STUDENT OBJECTIONS Students say having to take test in pen violates spirit of Honor Code 
### COURTNEY WEAVER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For students taking a two-hour biology or chem
istry midterm, it would seem that their choice of writ
ing utensil would be the least of their worries. For
some, however, this decision could impact their
chance of having their papers regraded for accuracy.

Like many science tests, the front page of each Bi
ology 42 exam states:"Exams submitted for regrading
must be entirely written in nonerasable pen." Yet
many students say they feel this policy impacts the
quality of their work — and goes against the spirit of
the honor code.
While not specifically addressed in the Honor
Code, the decision to institute a pen-only policy is left
to the discretion of each individual professor, and may
vary within a single department. Biology core coordi
nator and lecturer David Muir and chemistry profes
sor Wray Huestis are two faculty members who each

choose to uphold it; while Huestis declined to com
ment for the article, Muir defended the policy, which
has been instated in his department since before his
arrival five years ago.
"When examining students we may not subject
them to conditions where they are tempted to violate
the Honor Code," he said. "We institute reasonable
measures to limit [such temptation]."
Laurette Beeson. Judicial Advisor of the Office of
Judicial Affairs, agreed with Muir. and said. "I don't
believe a pen-only policy does compromise the Honor
Code."
Beeson cited Section C of the Code, which states," While
the faculty alone has the right and obligation to set academ
ic requirements, the students and faculty will work together
to establish optimal conditions for honorable academic
work."
Beeson noted that the Code also allows for faculty to
photocopy some or all ot the exams before returning them,
a policy which Muir himself, employs.
" The Honor Code does not require that faculty accept
student regulation of how exams are administered," he said.
" rhere is a misunderstanding among students that the
Honor ( ode is kind of a get-out-of-jail-free card."
112 or senior Jay Pandit, the policy's assurance of faculty
trust in students outweighs its drawbacks.
"Even though it causes a lot of frustration during the
exams, 1 think it is a good policy because it gets rid of the un
necessary doubts that could be cast on students regarding
cheating," he said.
However, many students feel the policy goes directly
against the very principle of the Honor Code.
According to Section B of the Code, "The faculty on its
part manifests its confidence in the honor of its students by
refraining from proctoring examinations and from taking
unusual and unreasonable precautions to prevent forms of
dishonesty."
Sophomore Lauren Harper said she believes the pen
only policy violates this section's confidence in the student.
"This policy assumes that we would cheat when we have
to sign the Honor Code on every exam," she said. "That de
values the strength of the Code."
Sophomore Sarah Rizk expressed similar feelings.
"The heart of the honor code is that Stanford trusts stu
dents not to cheat and this policy is really based on the sup
position that people will cheat," she said. "So, not only is it
in stark contrast to the ideals of the University,but it also ul
timately hurts stu
dents."

This contrast
was especially true
for Rizk, who. as a
dyslexic student, is
allotted extra time
for her exams
through the Dis
abilities Resource
Center.

a regrade was worth it to me," she said.
Rizk petitioned the policy after the test and may now re
ceive pencil-regrades under the condition she requests a
Xeroxed copy.
Muir said he makes this exception for "students who for
one reason or another have to write in pencil.
"I am not utterly inflexible on everything " he said. "Peo
ple always have the right to tell you their story."
He immediately added, "But I'm extremely reluctant to
accept papers [written in pencil] that have been somewhere
else and come back for a regrade."
Despite her own special circumstances. Rizk said she still
thinks the policy needs to be changed.
"I sort of think it's unfair that this same opportunity isn't
extended to all Bio core students because it really puts them
at a disadvantage," she said.
Some students, such as sophomore Cathy Sun, said they
see no injustice in the policy.
"Personally, I don't have any difficulty writing in pen so
the pen-only policy has never bothered me," she said. "I
think the policy is fair since they alert students of it before
each test. Also, students are always allowed to use the back
of previous pages for scratch paper before actually writing
in the final answer, though this does require extra time."
Time which could affect a student's grade, according to
Rizk.
"Not allowing people to write in pencil really decreases
their chances of doing well on the test because it increases
how sloppy you are and makes it so that you can't easily go
back and correct things," she said.
Harper said she felt similarly
"I write in pencil," she said."! think it's absurd to assume
that you're not going to make any mistakes on a Bio core
exam."
It is for reasons such as Rizk's and Harper's that chem
istry prof. Robert Waymouth chooses to not administer the
pen-only regrade policy in any of his classes.
"It seems that requiring pen-only makes it difficult for
students to self-correct," he said, and added that the preven
tative measures the policy takes against cheating "do not
outweigh the imposition it puts on students to write their
exams."
Waymouth furthermore said he doubted the strength of
the pen-only policy to begin with.
"I teach some of the largest lecture classes and it wasn't
really clear that a pen-only policy made any difference in
potential violations of the Honor Code," he said.
Echoed Rizk, "The risk of cheating is something that
universities must deal with everyday and taking one more
preventive measure may not be the answer when it puts
honest students at a disadvantage."

vary within a single department. Biology core coordi
nator and lecturer David Muir and chemistry profes
sor Wray Huestis are two faculty members who each

choose to uphold it; while Huestis declined to com
ment for the article, Muir defended the policy, which
has been instated in his department since before his
arrival five years ago.
"When examining students we may not subject
them to conditions where they are tempted to violate
the Honor Code," he said. "We institute reasonable
measures to limit [such temptation]."
Laurette Beeson. Judicial Advisor of the Office of
Judicial Affairs, agreed with Muir. and said. "I don't
believe a pen-only policy does compromise the Honor
Code."
Beeson cited Section C of the Code, which states," While
the faculty alone has the right and obligation to set academ
ic requirements, the students and faculty will work together
to establish optimal conditions for honorable academic
work."
Beeson noted that the Code also allows for faculty to
photocopy some or all ot the exams before returning them,
a policy which Muir himself, employs.
" The Honor Code does not require that faculty accept
student regulation of how exams are administered," he said.
" rhere is a misunderstanding among students that the
Honor ( ode is kind of a get-out-of-jail-free card."
112 or senior Jay Pandit, the policy's assurance of faculty
trust in students outweighs its drawbacks.
"Even though it causes a lot of frustration during the
exams, 1 think it is a good policy because it gets rid of the un
necessary doubts that could be cast on students regarding
cheating," he said.
However, many students feel the policy goes directly
against the very principle of the Honor Code.
According to Section B of the Code, "The faculty on its
part manifests its confidence in the honor of its students by
refraining from proctoring examinations and from taking
unusual and unreasonable precautions to prevent forms of
dishonesty."
Sophomore Lauren Harper said she believes the pen
only policy violates this section's confidence in the student.
"This policy assumes that we would cheat when we have
to sign the Honor Code on every exam," she said. "That de
values the strength of the Code."
Sophomore Sarah Rizk expressed similar feelings.
"The heart of the honor code is that Stanford trusts stu
dents not to cheat and this policy is really based on the sup
position that people will cheat," she said. "So, not only is it
in stark contrast to the ideals of the University,but it also ul
timately hurts stu
dents."

This contrast
was especially true
for Rizk, who. as a
dyslexic student, is
allotted extra time
for her exams
through the Dis
abilities Resource
Center.

a regrade was worth it to me," she said.
Rizk petitioned the policy after the test and may now re
ceive pencil-regrades under the condition she requests a
Xeroxed copy.
Muir said he makes this exception for "students who for
one reason or another have to write in pencil.
"I am not utterly inflexible on everything " he said. "Peo
ple always have the right to tell you their story."
He immediately added, "But I'm extremely reluctant to
accept papers [written in pencil] that have been somewhere
else and come back for a regrade."
Despite her own special circumstances. Rizk said she still
thinks the policy needs to be changed.
"I sort of think it's unfair that this same opportunity isn't
extended to all Bio core students because it really puts them
at a disadvantage," she said.
Some students, such as sophomore Cathy Sun, said they
see no injustice in the policy.
"Personally, I don't have any difficulty writing in pen so
the pen-only policy has never bothered me," she said. "I
think the policy is fair since they alert students of it before
each test. Also, students are always allowed to use the back
of previous pages for scratch paper before actually writing
in the final answer, though this does require extra time."
Time which could affect a student's grade, according to
Rizk.
"Not allowing people to write in pencil really decreases
their chances of doing well on the test because it increases
how sloppy you are and makes it so that you can't easily go
back and correct things," she said.
Harper said she felt similarly
"I write in pencil," she said."! think it's absurd to assume
that you're not going to make any mistakes on a Bio core
exam."
It is for reasons such as Rizk's and Harper's that chem
istry prof. Robert Waymouth chooses to not administer the
pen-only regrade policy in any of his classes.
"It seems that requiring pen-only makes it difficult for
students to self-correct," he said, and added that the preven
tative measures the policy takes against cheating "do not
outweigh the imposition it puts on students to write their
exams."
Waymouth furthermore said he doubted the strength of
the pen-only policy to begin with.
"I teach some of the largest lecture classes and it wasn't
really clear that a pen-only policy made any difference in
potential violations of the Honor Code," he said.
Echoed Rizk, "The risk of cheating is something that
universities must deal with everyday and taking one more
preventive measure may not be the answer when it puts
honest students at a disadvantage."
For students taking a two-hour biology or chem
istry midterm, it would seem that their choice of writ
ing utensil would be the least of their worries. For
some, however, this decision could impact their
chance of having their papers regraded for accuracy.

Like many science tests, the front page of each Bi
ology 42 exam states:"Exams submitted for regrading
must be entirely written in nonerasable pen." Yet
many students say they feel this policy impacts the
quality of their work — and goes against the spirit of
the honor code.
While not specifically addressed in the Honor
Code, the decision to institute a pen-only policy is left
to the discretion of each individual professor, and may
vary within a single department. Biology core coordi
nator and lecturer David Muir and chemistry profes
sor Wray Huestis are two faculty members who each
