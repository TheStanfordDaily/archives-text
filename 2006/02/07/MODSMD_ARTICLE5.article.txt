# WHY FLAT HOUSING RATES?
## LUCK OF THE DRAW Housing claims price policy is a matter of founding principle 
### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO DESK EDITOR 
Everyone's heard the story of the upper
classman who, through bad luck in the housing
Draw and his in-house draw, has consistently
lived in the least desirable residences and rooms
that Stanford's campus has to offer. Regardless
of his poor fortune, this hypothetical student
will have paid the same housing rate as a person
who has lived in 808 and 680 Lomita through
his undergraduate career.
While for some students the housing dilem
ma is a frequent topic of conversation, few ex

amine the reasons as to why Stanford uses its
constant room rate system. According to Exec
utive Director of Housing Rodger Whitney, set
ting a constant housing price is a principle that,
in many ways, dates back to the University's
founding.
"The Stanfords felt very strongly that Stan
ford should be residential at its core and that liv
ing on campus in housing was an important part
of the experience of going to Stanford," Whit
ney said. "Stanford's housing program is clearly
tied to its academic mission. Ever since the be
ginning when the Stanfords created what they
called a 'residential community of scholars,'
housing has had this function of offering pro
grams and living choices which enriched the ed
ucational and academic experience or expand-

Ed it further into the residential set
ting."
Whitney further explained how
universities across the nation typical
ly adopt one of two kinds of housing
philosophies.
"One is the more educational ap
proach to housing and the other is a
more market-consumer driven type
of housing," he said. "It relates to the
culture of the University in terms of
where does housing fit into the
scheme of the University."
While Stanford has taken the "ed
ucational" approach, other colleges,
such as Washington University in St.
Louis, charge their students different
housing rates depending on where
they choose to live.
"Freshman year when you apply

for housing, you're asked if you want
traditional or modern singles, dou
bles, or triples," said Carly Glazer, a
sophomore at WashU. "The prices of
the rooms are based upon whether
the dorm is new or old, and then on
how many people are in the room."
In contrast to WashU's housing
strategy, Whitney emphasized that
Stanford's system is based on a desire
to equalize housing for its students.
"[The Stanfords] wanted to equal
ize the experience for students once
here," said Whitney. "They wanted to
open up opportunities in areas of stu
dent and academic life that were not
based on one's ability to pay or force
students without means into less de
sirable living arrangements or sepa
rate communities at the University."
According to Whitney, having a
constant house rate allows students
to base their housing decisions on
what type of living options or aca
demic theme they want — not on
what they can afford.

ITiis viewpoint was not lost on stu
dents.
While senior Jennifer Lee under
stood why some might consider the
decision to charge the same room
rates to all students unfair, she ulti
mately agreed with Stanford's hous
ing philosophy.
"I see the point as to why housing
rates shouldn't he [flat], because
while it is not intended for it to he this
way, there are disparities in housing,"
Lee said. "Some dorms have bigger
rooms, better facilities and are newer.
But I tend to agree with the fact that
there is flat housing across the board
because where you decide to live
with your friends should not come
down to an issue of where you per
sonally can afford to live."
"[Housing] works just like tu
ition," Whitney said. "People may
take 13 units or 18 units, some may
have intensively-laden courses in
their curriculum, but others have big
lecture classes. And the cost is very

different for those, but people all pay
the same tuition."
While Glazer stated that the sys
tem in use at WashU is not "overly
complicated," Whitney said he be
lieves that Stanford's housing rate
setup is one of the simplest to use.
"Our complexity comes in from
the draw, which is all about choice
and options and lifestyle programs,"
Whitney said. "It doesn't come from
trying to figure out what the square
footage of your room will be."
Whitney further explained why
living in a Row house seems to be
more expensive than living in a dor
mitory, even though, in actuality, the
costs are nearly identical.
"The Row house housing rate is
exactly the same as a dorm rate ex
cept that you have private kitchens
and dining rooms in those Row hous
es," Whitney said. "So the overhead
costs for the equipment, the kitchen
infrastructure, which is pretty com
plicated in those small houses, [ap

pear] in the housing rate. That's why
some Row house rates are higher.
Students who live in Wilbur are pay
ing those same kitchen overhead
costs, but it appears in their board
costs."
For example, the housing rate for
living in La Casa Italiana. a Row
house, for the winter quarter was
$2,020 and the board bill was $1,275.
Meanwhile, students living in Kim
ball Hall, a dormitory, paid a housing
cost of $1,684, but a board cost of
$1,512.
Despite the University's reason
ing, some students said they still be
lieve that Stanford's housing system
is inequitable.
"I can see not wanting to charge
different rates between different
houses, but within a single dormitory,
some rooms are going to be better
than others and in a lot of cases not
only the place you live but the room
you end up in is out of your control,"
said sophomore Michael Booe,a res

ident of Kimball who lives in a one
room quad.
"I understand the administra
tion's argument that they don't want
people to choose based on how much
they have to pay, but on the other
hand we're not really choosing any
way — a lot of it is left up to chance,
so it does seem unfair," Booe said.
Whitney added that while there is
currently a housing crunch, this issue
has been addressed and a resolution
for it is in the works.
"We're working on the housing
master plan, which eventually will
uncrowd all of our crowded resi
dences," Whitney said. "Then this
equalization will be a non-issue. Most
upperclass students will live in very
desirable spaces as we get this project
done over the next few years, if you
imagine those beautiful rooms in
Toyon or Branner housing two peo
ple instead of three and Lagunita be
coming all singles again like the way
it was built."

costs are nearly identical.
"The Row house housing rate is
exactly the same as a dorm rate ex
cept that you have private kitchens
and dining rooms in those Row hous
es," Whitney said. "So the overhead
costs for the equipment, the kitchen
infrastructure, which is pretty com
plicated in those small houses, [ap

pear] in the housing rate. That's why
some Row house rates are higher.
Students who live in Wilbur are pay
ing those same kitchen overhead
costs, but it appears in their board
costs."
For example, the housing rate for
living in La Casa Italiana. a Row
house, for the winter quarter was
$2,020 and the board bill was $1,275.
Meanwhile, students living in Kim
ball Hall, a dormitory, paid a housing
cost of $1,684, but a board cost of
$1,512.
Despite the University's reason
ing, some students said they still be
lieve that Stanford's housing system
is inequitable.
"I can see not wanting to charge
different rates between different
houses, but within a single dormitory,
some rooms are going to be better
than others and in a lot of cases not
only the place you live but the room
you end up in is out of your control,"
said sophomore Michael Booe,a res

ident of Kimball who lives in a one
room quad.
"I understand the administra
tion's argument that they don't want
people to choose based on how much
they have to pay, but on the other
hand we're not really choosing any
way — a lot of it is left up to chance,
so it does seem unfair," Booe said.
Whitney added that while there is
currently a housing crunch, this issue
has been addressed and a resolution
for it is in the works.
"We're working on the housing
master plan, which eventually will
uncrowd all of our crowded resi
dences," Whitney said. "Then this
equalization will be a non-issue. Most
upperclass students will live in very
desirable spaces as we get this project
done over the next few years, if you
imagine those beautiful rooms in
Toyon or Branner housing two peo
ple instead of three and Lagunita be
coming all singles again like the way
it was built."
Everyone's heard the story of the upper
classman who, through bad luck in the housing
Draw and his in-house draw, has consistently
lived in the least desirable residences and rooms
that Stanford's campus has to offer. Regardless
of his poor fortune, this hypothetical student
will have paid the same housing rate as a person
who has lived in 808 and 680 Lomita through
his undergraduate career.
While for some students the housing dilem
ma is a frequent topic of conversation, few ex

amine the reasons as to why Stanford uses its
constant room rate system. According to Exec
utive Director of Housing Rodger Whitney, set
ting a constant housing price is a principle that,
in many ways, dates back to the University's
founding.
"The Stanfords felt very strongly that Stan
ford should be residential at its core and that liv
ing on campus in housing was an important part
of the experience of going to Stanford," Whit
ney said. "Stanford's housing program is clearly
tied to its academic mission. Ever since the be
ginning when the Stanfords created what they
called a 'residential community of scholars,'
housing has had this function of offering pro
grams and living choices which enriched the ed
ucational and academic experience or expand-

Ed it further into the residential set
ting."
Whitney further explained how
universities across the nation typical
ly adopt one of two kinds of housing
philosophies.
"One is the more educational ap
proach to housing and the other is a
more market-consumer driven type
of housing," he said. "It relates to the
culture of the University in terms of
where does housing fit into the
scheme of the University."
While Stanford has taken the "ed
ucational" approach, other colleges,
such as Washington University in St.
Louis, charge their students different
housing rates depending on where
they choose to live.
"Freshman year when you apply

for housing, you're asked if you want
traditional or modern singles, dou
bles, or triples," said Carly Glazer, a
sophomore at WashU. "The prices of
the rooms are based upon whether
the dorm is new or old, and then on
how many people are in the room."
In contrast to WashU's housing
strategy, Whitney emphasized that
Stanford's system is based on a desire
to equalize housing for its students.
"[The Stanfords] wanted to equal
ize the experience for students once
here," said Whitney. "They wanted to
open up opportunities in areas of stu
dent and academic life that were not
based on one's ability to pay or force
students without means into less de
sirable living arrangements or sepa
rate communities at the University."
According to Whitney, having a
constant house rate allows students
to base their housing decisions on
what type of living options or aca
demic theme they want — not on
what they can afford.

ITiis viewpoint was not lost on stu
dents.
While senior Jennifer Lee under
stood why some might consider the
decision to charge the same room
rates to all students unfair, she ulti
mately agreed with Stanford's hous
ing philosophy.
"I see the point as to why housing
rates shouldn't he [flat], because
while it is not intended for it to he this
way, there are disparities in housing,"
Lee said. "Some dorms have bigger
rooms, better facilities and are newer.
But I tend to agree with the fact that
there is flat housing across the board
because where you decide to live
with your friends should not come
down to an issue of where you per
sonally can afford to live."
"[Housing] works just like tu
ition," Whitney said. "People may
take 13 units or 18 units, some may
have intensively-laden courses in
their curriculum, but others have big
lecture classes. And the cost is very

different for those, but people all pay
the same tuition."
While Glazer stated that the sys
tem in use at WashU is not "overly
complicated," Whitney said he be
lieves that Stanford's housing rate
setup is one of the simplest to use.
"Our complexity comes in from
the draw, which is all about choice
and options and lifestyle programs,"
Whitney said. "It doesn't come from
trying to figure out what the square
footage of your room will be."
Whitney further explained why
living in a Row house seems to be
more expensive than living in a dor

costs are nearly identical.
