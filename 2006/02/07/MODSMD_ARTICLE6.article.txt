## Bush launches $136B initiative in math, sciences 
### CHRISTOPHER LIN STAFF WRITER 
Noting past technological innovations as balloon
catheters and the Internet that have been developed
through federal funding. President George W. Bush recent
ly announced a $136 billion initiative for research, innova
tion and education in math and the sciences.
The American Competitiveness Initiative (ACI), Bush
explained in his State of the Union Address, is designed to
encourage domestic innovation in order to strengthen the
United States' competitiveness in the global economy.The
initiative will commit $5.7 billion for investments in re
search and development, education and entrepreneurship
in fiscal year 2007, and will add more than $136 billion over
the next' 10 years, doubling the budgets of federal agencies
with research programs in engineering and the physical sci
ences.
Stanford's faculty responded favorably to the new initia
tive, with President John Hennessy issuing a statement of
praise for the policy.
"We are encouraged by the president's leadership in
recognizing the challenges the nation must address if we
are to maintain our leadership in science and technology,"
he said. "The proposals to increase the federal commit
ment to basic research in the physical sciences and en
hance the teaching of math and science in high school are
critical in this regard."
School of Engineering Dean Jim Plummer echoed 1 len
nessy's sentiments, adding,"l think the things the president
proposed to enhance our nation's competitiveness are both
important and necessary. The emphasis on science and
math education in K-12 schools is very important to pro
vide an educated workforce. The increase in research fund
ing, especially for the physical sciences, is also a critical need
and will better balance the federal research portfolio."
Besides funding public research, the ACI proposes to
stimulate research and development in the private sector
by granting companies a permanent tax credit estimated at
$86 billion over 10 years. The initiative would also create
Career Advancement Accounts for up to 800,(XX) workers
annually, allowing each worker to use up to $3.(XX) for train
ing and other employment services, and more than tripling
the number of workers trained in the current system.
Some students spoke out in support of the ACI for its at
tempt to drive American technological dominance.
"I think it's clear that as America continues along the
path to encouraging global trade,our workers can no longer
compete in labor-intensive industries," said sophomore
Christine Su. "America's competitive edge has always been
technological innovation, and now the long-term strategy
must be to bring our workforce up to par with the high-tech
sector where we have a comparative advantage.'lTie burden
of keeping ahead is a heavy one, because the transfer of
technology to other nations can be almost instantaneous,
but at least a well-educated and entrepreneurial population
will have the skills to continue adapting to this increasingly
fast-paced economy."
In addition to funding private and public sector re
search, the initiative also proposes $380 million in new fed
eral support for math, science and technological education
in K-12 schools. The money would expand low-income stu
dents' access to Advanced Placement and International
Baccalaureate courses by training 70.(XM) additional teach
ers over five years, and would encourage math and science
professionals to become adjunct high school teachers.
However, some students expressed dissatisfaction with
the educational aspects of the initiative.
"It would be great if it worked," said freshman Patrick
Ardinger. "But for Bush to claim success on his past educa
tional policies like the No Child Left Behind Act. he has to
actually produce the funding for them. Bush needs to focus
on actually devoting money toward improving the quality
of education in public schools and increasing incentives to
teach by offering teachers higher wages."
In the meantime, however, educators remain hopeful
that the initiative will succeed.
