## Wildfire singes So. Cal suburb Santa Ana winds fan flames in Orange County

ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) â€”A
wildfire fanned by Santa Ana winds
ate through 1,2(X) acres of wilderness
near the outskirts of Orange County
suburbs Monday, forcing evacuation
of 1,5(X) homes.
The homes, in Anaheim and the
city of Orange bordering Cleveland
National Forest, were protected by
fire crews and there were no reports
of damage by midafternoon, said
Orange County Fire Authority
spokesman Dennis Shell. The fire,
however, began a second major
phase of burning.
A towering plume rose over the
Santa Ana Mountains and pungent
smoke stained skies brown for miles
across the Los Angeles metropolitan
region.
"The ash was coming down like
snow. I had all the windows and door
shut because it was just overwhelm
ing," said Kathie Scott, who was or
dered by a firefighter to evacuate
her Mayberry Ranch home about 11
a.m. She got out with two dogs but
had to leave behind a cat and two pet
guinea pigs.
The blaze, dubbed the Sierra fire
for a local peak, erupted about 4:30
a.m. in the national forest as the gusty
Santa Anas brought withering, warm
conditions to Southern California.
Flames burned toward the south
west on rugged land east of the sub

urbs and the State Route 241 toll
way, which firefighters hoped would
act as a firebreak. Spot fires occurred
beyond the tollway, but were kept
small.
"We don't want it to get across
there. If it does it's within a half a
mile of homes," said Stephen Miller,
a fire spokesman.
Firefighters at one point took ad
vantage of favorable winds to light a
backfire along the east flank of the
closed tollway, tossing tlares and fir
ing flare guns into the brush. Gusts
swirled ash and debris through the
air.

There was a mix of mandatory
and voluntary evacuations in the
area, which has mostly newer subdi
visions nestled among rolling hills.
Gusts hit up to 60 mph early in
the day, with sustained winds of
about 30 mph. but moderated to
about half that speed in the after
noon. Miller said.
The cause of the fire remained
under investigation, said forest
spokeswoman Joan Wynn.
Red flag warnings for critical fire
danger were posted for much of the
region, from Santa Barbara County
south to the U.S.-Mexico border.

Cleveland National Forest
sprawls over 460,000 acres from Or
ange County south through River
side and San Diego counties.
The Santa Ana winds were gener
ated by high pressure over the high
desert and southern Nevada, the Na
tional Weather Service said. Blowing
from the interior, Santa Anas greatly
reduce humidity, drying out vegeta
tion.
The winds have often played a
role in disastrous wildfires. In 2003,
wind-driven wildfires destroyed
more than 3,600 homes and killed 22
people in Southern California.

Firefighters took precautions and measures yesterday to stem the advancing flames before they spread far enough
to claim homes in the nearby Orange County suburban neighborhoods.
