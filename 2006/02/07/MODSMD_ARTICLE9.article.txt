# Iran demands removal of surveillance cameras
## Iran announces decrease in IAEA inspections 
### GEORGE JAHN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
VIENNA, Austria (AP) — Iran
has told the International Atomic
Energy Agency to remove surveil
lance cameras and agency seals from
sites and nuclear equipment by the
end of next week in response to re
ferral to the U.N. Security Council,
the agency said Monday.
Iran's demands came two days
after the lAEA reported Tehran to
the council over its disputed atomic
program.
In a confidential report to the
lAEA's 35-member board on Mon
day, agency head Mohamed Elßa
radei said Iran also announced a
sharp reduction in the number and
kind of lAEA inspections, effective
immediately. The report was made
available to The Associated Press.
Iranian officials had repeatedly
warned they would stop honoring
the so-called "Additional Protocol"
to the Nuclear Nonproliferation
Treaty — an agreement giving
lAEA inspectors greater authority
— if the lAEA board referred their
country to the council.
A diplomat close to the Vienna
based lAEA told the AP that Iran
had also moved forward on another
threat — formally setting a date for
resuming full-scale work on its urani
um enrichment program. Iran says it
wants to make fuel through enrich
ment. but the activity can also gener
ate the nuclear core of warheads.
The diplomat, who spoke on con
dition of anonymity because the
matter was confidential, refused to
divulge the date.

Robert G. Joseph, the U.S. under
secretary of state for arms control,
said Monday that Iran used negotia
tions with the European Union to
play for time and develop its capabil
ities.
"I would say that Iran does have
the capability to develop nuclear
weapons and the means to deliver
them," he said in a response to a
question.
In Dubai, United Arab Emirates,
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
he was still hopeful that Iran will
take confidence-building measures
with the lAEA.
"It's not the end of the road,"
Annan said of the Security Council
referral."l hope that in between, Iran
will take steps that will help create an
environment and confidence-build
ing measures that will bring the part
ners back to the negotiating table."
In his brief report, Elßaradei
cited E. Khalilipour. vice president
of the Atomic Energy Organization
of Iran, as saying: "From the date of
this letter, all voluntarily suspended
non-legally binding measures in
cluding the provisions of the Addi
tional Protocol and even beyond
that will be suspended."
Calling on the agency to sharply
reduce the number of inspectors in
Iran, Khalilipour added: "All the
Agency's containment and surveil
lance measures which were in place
beyond the normal Agency safe
guards measures should be removed
by mid-February 2006."
Earlier. Russia's foreign minister
warned against threatening Iran
after Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld reportedly agreed with an
interviewer at the German daily
newspaper Handelsblatt that all op
tions. including military response, re
mained on the table.
