## Media and politics of science 
### 
Do you still use Teflon pans? I do. And junior
year, when my roommate showed me a poster
she made to warn women about mercury in
fish, I said,"lt looks good — but I don't buy it." 1 guess
I'm lucky I'm not expecting.
After years of headlines on the danger of global
warming, the lack of danger of global warming, humans
being cloned in Korea and proclamations that "a low
fat diet does not cut health risks, report says" — as The
New York Times reported yesterday — it is easy to dis
miss news about science, health or engineering as noise.
So, I keep cooking my breakfast in a carcinogenic fry
ing pan. Surely, there is a better way.
Most Stanford media consumers, not having person
al subscriptions to Nature, are left at the mercy of The
New York Times and the Discovery Channel for their
science news. While scientists operate in a world of
probability distributions and significant figures,journal
ists tend to focus more on differences in policies and sig
nificant viewpoints — which may be politically relevant
but, scientifically, are statistical outliers. What's key for
readers is to avoid losing in translation what is scientific
consensus and what are relevant new developments.
And, professionals in scientific fields will admit, that
isn't always easy.
Dr. Victor Henderson, professor of health research
and policy and of neurology and neurological sciences
at the School of Medicine, said that there is a tendency
for the media and its consumers to seize on new studies
— but, there are qualities in stories readers can look for
to distinguish important information from hype.
Henderson suggested paying attention to whether
conclusions are drawn from observation or experiment,
and that readers should put more faith in experimental
studies — like the low-fat diet study reported on in The
Times. He also suggested differentiating between ab
solute risk and relative risk, as well as paying attention
to the presentation of statistics. What does that mean?
Stanford men. if you hear that erectile dysfunction oc
curs in 40 percent of males, you probably don't have to
worry — at least for a while. A large percent of those
who experience ED may be over 60, or 70 or 80.
But even with a well-received experimental study,
just reading the headlines can lead you astray. For ex
ample, much to my dismay, I can't now go eat sharp
cheddar cheese in endless quantities with the scientific
and medical communities' blessing. Buried more than
halfway through The Times' article is the distinction
that while low-fat diets may not be the key to better
health, many are persuaded that a diet low in saturated
fat will keep you trucking — even though this hypoth
esis has yet to be tested in a clinical trial.
Finally, readers should look for consensus among
the scientific community as a good way to guard against
putting too much faith in unaccepted or untested ad
vice.
So, if it's this easy to differentiate good science from
bad science, why do many professionals feel that media
coverage of science causes public ideas to deviate so far
from scientific consensus?
Enter politics and paradigms.
According to Stephen Schneider, a professor of bio
logical sciences and senior fellow at the Institute for In
ternational Studies — and an oft-quoted voice on cli
mate change issues, the answer may have much to do
with professional differences. (The material for this col
umn. and more of Schneider's perspectives on science
and the media can be found in the "Mediarology" sec
tion of his Web site, http://stephenschneider.
stanford.edu.)
While Henderson says that in his experience science
writers take care to communicate nuances of scientific
findings, this is often obscured in shorter news pieces.
For Schneider, this risk is accentuated in coverage that
mixes science and politics, where the journalistic mantra
of covering both sides of a story often takes little care to
distinguish between mainstream and minority views.
Many scientists blame this journalistic paradigm for
the current state of the public debate over climate
change. While the vast majority of the scientific profes
sion accepts anthropogenic climate change as a reality,
much of the public believes the jury is still out, as journal
ists continue to report the divergent claims of politicians
and advocates. The media often fails to add that there is
no longer much debate on this issue among professionals.
How else would The Wall Street Journal, the news
paper with the second-highest daily circulation in the
United States, be able to editorialize, as it did on Janu
ary 19, that "no proof exists that lower emissions re
duce global warming" and "[t]he idea that human activ
ity influences climate change one way or another is far
from proven, given the overwhelming role nature itself
plays in atmospheric changes"?
When science coverage meshes with political cover
age, arguments can gain more sway in public opinion
than they may have in the scientific community. De
spite continued talk of nuclear power being the key to
America's dependency on foreign oil, the engineers of
the world haven't shifted their research agendas, be
cause oil is overwhelmingly used for transportation and
nuclear power for electricity. Ethanol probably would
n't be as big of an issue, either, if the central United
States weren't filled with government-subsidized corn.
Let the reader beware. Paying attention to where
science ends and politics begin, as well as using a criti
cal eye in evaluating breaking science stories, will leave
you with less noise and more news. And that's good, be
cause if I still set aside all science news as a temporary
fad. I'd be eating far too many tuna omelets.
