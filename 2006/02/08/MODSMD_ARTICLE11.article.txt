# Fighting Bio terror
## Profs seek unorthodox methods to combat threats 
### Pamela Sud 
Whether it's the dispersion of
aerosolized anthrax or terrorist
dissemination of smallpox, bioter
rorism strikes the heart of the United
States' biomedical research agenda.
Microbiology and Immunology Prof. David Relman
recently published an editorial in The New England
Journal of Medicine on the threat of bioterrorism. As a
member of the U.S. Health and Human Services Depart
ment's National Science Advisory' Board for Biosecurity.
Relman calls for a shift from research designed to count
er specific threats to more generic forms of defense.
"The key challenge will be to define the optimal bal
ance between fixed and flexible defenses," Relman ex
plains. Though Relman sees the practicality of fighting
against known agents of bioterrorism. he says that the
government should invest even more in flexible, dynam
ic security measures.
"A robust biodefense plan must be anticipatory, flex
ible and rapidly responsive," Relman says."lt should ex
ploit cross-cutting technologies and cross-disciplinary
scientific insights."
Relman uses a combination of new techniques and
genomics in his research to do just that. Armed with
these methods, he seeks to develop approaches for rec
ognizing infectious diseases from the start.
"When we cannot recognize specific microbial
agents of disease in their early point, we are limited in
the kinds of interventions we can offer patients —
sometimes limited to nonspecific antibiotics." Relman

says.
He is

currently

looking at strate-

gies to create profiles of

human gene expression or human

protein expression based upon a genome-wide survey of
host responses. He is using genomics to find patterns,
which he in turn uses for diagnoses.
Nearly $1.5 billion was allocated for biodefense re
search to the National Institute of Health in 2003, but
some say that too much of the money and attention is
being paid to pathogens that presently cause disease. We
need to be "prepared to fight the next war" on bioterror
ism rather than focusing attention on the past. Relman
argues.
Many experts like Relman also broaden their atten
tion to threats posed by nature in the near term such as
avian influenza, and — closer to home — highly resist
ant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. But they don't lose
sight of possible terrorist threats.
"What 1 worry about in the most distant term is that,
in addition to everything nature will spawn, we could
also face someone or somebody deliberately or inadver
tently misusing biology." Relman explains.

Other

members of

the Stanford
community like

Jonathan Farley, science

fellow at the Center for Inter

national Security and Coopera

tion.seek to find statistical methods to

predict imminent threats.

"Using 'lattice theory,' 1 am trying to determine the
structure of the 'perfect terrorist cell," Farley explains.
"In the future. I hope to model the growth of terrorist
groups, to model the evolutionary dynamics of the 'AI
Qaeda virus,' as it were."
Much research exists on ways to npply math to effec
tively predict real threats, including work in reflexive
theory - a branch of mathematical psychology created to
help law enforcement allocate its scarce resources.
Fred Roberts, director of the Center for Discrete
Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science, uses
"free distributive lattices" to lower the cost of inspecting
potentially dangerous cargo at ports. Farley admits, how
ever. that biodefense can often be a game of hit or miss.
"According to Gordon Woo. a mathematician who
spoke at CISAC last week, the greatest terrorist biolog
ical weapon is the brain," recalls Farley.
Farley's solution:
"The U.S. should increase funding for weapons of
math instruction by a factor of 3.1415," he says.
