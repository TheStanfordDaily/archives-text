# Prescription drug woes: How to stop 125,000 deaths
## 
### MELISSA FUSCO STAFF WRITER 
Failure to follow prescribed medica
tion regimens is an enormous problem in
the United States, costing society nearly
$100 billion and leading to an estimated
125,000 deaths every year.
Now, psychology graduate student
Sean Young and former psychology grad
uate student Daniel Oppenheimer. now a
professor at Princeton, are publishing a
paper suggesting that the problem might
be exacerbated by the wording of drug
side-effect warnings.
"We found that the way drug informa
tion is presented to people leads to a con
sistent overestimation the likelihood of
negative side effects, which in turn increas
es the likelihood that they will not take
their medication as prescribed," Young
says. Young and Oppenheimer's paper, ti
tled "Presenting Risk Information," was
published in January's issue of the drug
therapy journal 'Clinical Therapeutics.'
The paper presents the results of three
experiments designed to isolate factors
that might cause people to avoid their
medication. In the first experiment, sub
jects were asked to estimate their percent
chance of suffering 'commonly reported'
side effects associated with various com
mon prescription drugs. Young and Op
penheimer found that people typically
overestimated occurrences by a factor of
10, believing that as many as 20 percent
patients experienced side effects like nau
sea and headache, when the real reported

incidence was
closer to 2 percent.
When advertis
ing drugs, pharma
ceutical compa
nies are required
by law to disclose
side effects associ
ated with their
products. Since di
rect-to-consunier
advertising be
came legal in the
19905, companies
have consistently
preferred 'seman
tic' indicators,
which list side ef
fects without
being specific
about how often
they occur.

Young and Oppenheimer. however,
showed that subjects who were given per
centage risk statistics instead of actual
magazine advertisements or stock phrases
such as 'side effects may include 1 and
'some people may experience' were much
more likely to take their medications as
prescribed.
'Hie irony is that while drug company
marketing practices are designed to in
crease the purchase of prescription drugs,
they are actually making people afraid of
their medications.
"This research suggests that framing af
fects estimates of risk and that current
methods of disclosing information are

non-optimal," Young and Op
penheimer write. The result,
technically termed 'medical
non-compliance,' is estimated
to cause 125,000 deaths and
cost $100 billion.
"Healthcare providers as
sume that as long as you get
info out there to people, it's less
important how it's communi
cated," Young says. "We want
ed to show that it makes a huge
difference."
Another problem with the
practice of listing most com
mon' side effects is that it gives
a distorted picture of the rela
tive safety of different drug op
tions. In the absence of hard
numbers, people estimate the

dangers of drugs on the seri
ousness of their side effects rather than
the likelihood of these effects occurring.
But while an alarming condition such as
hemorrhaging or heart attack might be
the most commonly reported side effects
for a particular drug. Young pointed out, it
may still be extremely rare.
"A 'most common' side effect could be
fatal, yet be one in a million,"he notes.
Ilie results of the study lead Young and
Oppenhcimcr to make several sugges
tions that will hopefully lead to decreased
medical non-compliance in the future.
They recommend that pharmaceutical
companies should distribute drug infor
mation with statistics in percentages, not
ing specifically who is at risk. Certain

groups like the elderly and patients on
other medications typically report side ef
fects more often than other patients, and
while this information is available it is not
widely known to the public.
Another option is to standardize the
wording of side effect warnings, as is done
in the European Union. Side effects
would be rated anywhere from 'extremely
rare' to 'common,' labels which would be
indexed to percentage risks.
Another psychological method is a
'ladder scale,' which compares medication
risks with risks of other rare events.
"To give someone an idea of just how
uncommon something is. you might com
pare it to the chances of getting struck by
lightning." Young says.
In the future. Young notes, social psy
chology has much to offer to policymakers
aiming to create a better-informed public.
"One of the big questions in medical
decision-making is whether we want a pa
ternalistic system, which gives people less
choice," he says. "Our society has steered
away from that. We take the stance that
there should be communication between
patient and provider to reach a joint deci
sion."
Unfortunately, consumers often cannot
decipher pharmaceutical literature, and
drug company advertising practices are lit
tle help to informed decision-making.
"Right now we don't take into account
people's perceptions when they make
these decisions." Young says. "Informa
tion needs to be tailored to people's psy
chologies."

ceutical compa
nies are required
by law to disclose
side effects associ
ated with their
products. Since di
rect-to-consunier
advertising be
came legal in the
19905, companies
have consistently
preferred 'seman
tic' indicators,
which list side ef
fects without
being specific
about how often
they occur.

Young and Oppenheimer. however,
showed that subjects who were given per
centage risk statistics instead of actual
magazine advertisements or stock phrases
such as 'side effects may include 1 and
'some people may experience' were much
more likely to take their medications as
prescribed.
'Hie irony is that while drug company
marketing practices are designed to in
crease the purchase of prescription drugs,
they are actually making people afraid of
their medications.
"This research suggests that framing af
fects estimates of risk and that current
methods of disclosing information are

non-optimal," Young and Op
penheimer write. The result,
technically termed 'medical
non-compliance,' is estimated
to cause 125,000 deaths and
cost $100 billion.
"Healthcare providers as
sume that as long as you get
info out there to people, it's less
important how it's communi
cated," Young says. "We want
ed to show that it makes a huge
difference."
Another problem with the
practice of listing most com
mon' side effects is that it gives
a distorted picture of the rela
tive safety of different drug op
tions. In the absence of hard
numbers, people estimate the

dangers of drugs on the seri
ousness of their side effects rather than
the likelihood of these effects occurring.
But while an alarming condition such as
hemorrhaging or heart attack might be
the most commonly reported side effects
for a particular drug. Young pointed out, it
may still be extremely rare.
"A 'most common' side effect could be
fatal, yet be one in a million,"he notes.
Ilie results of the study lead Young and
Oppenhcimcr to make several sugges
tions that will hopefully lead to decreased
medical non-compliance in the future.
They recommend that pharmaceutical
companies should distribute drug infor
mation with statistics in percentages, not
ing specifically who is at risk. Certain

groups like the elderly and patients on
other medications typically report side ef
fects more often than other patients, and
while this information is available it is not
widely known to the public.
Another option is to standardize the
wording of side effect warnings, as is done
in the European Union. Side effects
would be rated anywhere from 'extremely
rare' to 'common,' labels which would be
indexed to percentage risks.
Another psychological method is a
'ladder scale,' which compares medication
risks with risks of other rare events.
"To give someone an idea of just how
uncommon something is. you might com
pare it to the chances of getting struck by
lightning." Young says.
In the future. Young notes, social psy
chology has much to offer to policymakers
aiming to create a better-informed public.
"One of the big questions in medical
decision-making is whether we want a pa
ternalistic system, which gives people less
choice," he says. "Our society has steered
away from that. We take the stance that
there should be communication between
patient and provider to reach a joint deci
sion."
Unfortunately, consumers often cannot
decipher pharmaceutical literature, and
drug company advertising practices are lit
tle help to informed decision-making.
"Right now we don't take into account
people's perceptions when they make
these decisions." Young says. "Informa
tion needs to be tailored to people's psy
chologies."
