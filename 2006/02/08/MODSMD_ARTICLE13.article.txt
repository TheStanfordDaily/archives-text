## Editorial Spread love, not HPV 
### 
It's Friday night, and you come home from
a frat party where you hooked up with a
guy. Next thing you know, you have HPV
and a possibility of developing cervical can
cer. While not as infamous as HIV or gonor
rhea, Human papilloma virus is a sexually
transmitted disease that kills S,(XX) women
each year, is more easily transmissible than
HIV, and was found in 32% of female college
students in a recent study conducted at
Washington State University. What's even
worse is that it's completely preventable.
While it infects both men and women,
HPV is the only proven cause of cervical
cancer, which only kills women. It cannot be
prevented by condom use, and is often
asymptomatic and dormant, thus facilitating
rapid transmission and slow detection. Vic
tims of HPV suffer from painful tumors that
grow as ulcerated masses that cause bleed
ing and tear apart the walls of internal or
gans, thus making the inaccessibility of pre
ventative measures even more unforgivable.
Thanks to self-described "family values"
proponents on Capitol Hill and within the
current administration, a recently approved
vaccine for HPV has been backlogged for
distribution and blocked from being added
to the list of approved vaccines routinely
given to young girls before they reach puber
ty. According to organizations such as the
Christian lobby group Family Research
Council, abstinence is the "best" way to pre
vent HPV, and making a vaccine more read
ily available to all girls would only encour
age promiscuous behavior. Even with the

hypothetical consideration that premarital
sex is immoral,sending the message that pre
marital sex is punishable by death is nothing
short of ludicrous. On top of this, our policy
makers have failed to consider the effects of
the disease on women who are raped or
those who have not been promiscuous, yet
still contract the virus from partners.
At first glance, the arguments of the evan
gelical right against the HPV vaccine are
reminiscent of similar arguments made
against the distribution of the morning-after
pill. But the similarities end when one con
siders the fact that withholding the HPV
vaccine is equivalent to condoning the
senseless, needless deaths of several thou
sand women in this country. There is not —
and never will be — anything moral about
refusing medical treatment to those who are
at risk of dying, in an effort to shape sexual
behavior. Denying a form of disease preven
tion for a disease that disproportionately af
fects women is not only an issue of ethics, but
of gender equality as well.
In the end, the HPV vaccine story is quite
simple: if you have any women in your life
who are important to you, this affects you.
There is no reason why the current govern
ment should be able to pass judgment on
women who may not have a choice in
whether or not they get the virus. There is no
legitimate ethical barrier to offering a form
of prevention that has already been devel
oped and tested. And there is no reason why
any woman should have to choose between
virginity and death.
