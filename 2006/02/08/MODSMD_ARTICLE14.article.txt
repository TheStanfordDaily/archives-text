1995 wasn't a particularly good year for
me. It was the year that the Atlanta
Braves played the Cleveland Indians in
the World Series — a veritable civil war of
my heritage, that is, if you took my ancestors,
reduced them to offensive cartoon charac
ters and then pitted them against each other
in a series of entertaining baseball games.
1 was only 15-years-old back then, but I
remember feeling very uncomfortable with
the use of American Indians as athletic mas
cots. Instead of confronting the images as
racist, I avoided them — and athletics —
completely. I put away my baseball glove,
picked up my French horn and joined the
rank-and-file likes of my high school march
ing band. It was, truthfully, my way of trying
to look like everyone else. It didn't really
work since I was six inches taller and 30
pounds heavier than most of the other kids
in the band, but that didn't stop me.
It was also, I thought, the height of the de
bate over the use of American Indian athlet
ic mascots. I avoided the issue whenever pos
sible. I didn't want to be responsible for con
demning the traditions of an athletic team,
nor did I want to be responsible for being the
face of American Indian genocide. I couldn't
wait until the issue settled down and people
got back to playing baseball, marching in the
band, or what have you.
It appears, however, that more than a
decade has passed since those days, and the
mascot issue has not disappeared. In fact, this
past week the NCAA ban on American Indi
an mascots that are "hostile or abusive" took
effect and brought the debate back into the
spotlight. Interestingly, the issue has risen
again at Stanford and prompted action from

the Stanford American Indian Organization
(SAIO) and the University administration.
Reaction from some students, like fresh
man Luukas lives, indicated that the mascot
issue is seen by some members of the com
munity as part of a larger issue of free
speech. In a recent Letter to the Editor, he
went as far as to compare the Stanford Uni
versity administration to Mao or Stalin in its
effort to squelch the image. Sophomore
Mark McClure also wrote a letter stating
that "not everyone finds the Stanford Indian
symbol offensive. Furthermore, as a symbol
of a Stanford tradition, it is not without re
deeming value." While I agree that the sym
bol does not offend everyone, it seems that
not offending people is not the issue. Also,
lives didn't clarify what that redeeming
value might be. but I'm sure he thought long
and hard about it.
I realize that citizenship in this country —
as codified by our patriarchal European col
onizers— gives us the freedom to express
ourselves, even at the risk of offending oth
ers. However, I also realize that I go to a Uni
versity where respect and honor are es
teemed virtues. Part of what makes me proud

to be an American Indian at Stan
ford is the fact that the Fundamental
Standard allows me to belong. I no
longer have to retreat to the march
ing band, though the Stanford band
is hardly the place I would go if 1
wanted to look like everyone else.
Look, I value freedom of expres
sion and tradition just as much as the
next gay American Indian Ph.D. stu
dent, but I think what distinguishes
our community is the fact that we
abide by the virtues of respect and
honor, regardless of the rest of the
world. In my opinion, the use of
American Indians as athletic mas
cots is not the real issue for the Stan
ford community. President
Henessey was right on track when
he turned to the Fundamental Stan
dard, which states:
"Students at Stanford are ex
pected to show both within and
without the University such respect
for order, morality, personal honor
and the rights of others as is de
manded of good citizens. Failure to
do this will he sufficient cause for re
moval from the University."
The real issue for our community
is not one of freedom of speech or
