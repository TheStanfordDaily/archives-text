# The
						weekend's fluffer
## 
### 
It's a Thursday evening. Thursday is an odd
day. Out in the real world, there was even
a brief moment when Thursday appeared
to be on the verge of a breakthrough when
people proclaimed it as "the new Friday."
Of course, it could never last, and I believe
that the fifth day of the week has been rele
gated to its usual anticipatory position as the
weekend's fluffer.
Having said all of that, there are still
places where Thursday rules — for example
in our world. For reasons I've never quite un
derstood, Thursday is when collegiate types
go out to play.
There's Senior Pub Night — where chil
dren go out searching for candy (or some
thing like that), the Nuthouse is packed full of
kids looking to capitalize on that "not-quite-
Friday" feeling and the 750 has student night.
The latter is responsible for this column.
As I write I'm propping up the bar in the
GCC, listening to a Beatles cover band and
try ing to figure out why I don't feel guilty in
sacking Thursday evenings.
Oddly, though, the guilt thing only really
works on Thursdays. During the rest of the
week, most of us still behave like we're part
of the nine-to-five set. And that, well, it's re
ally missing the point of academic life.
I have a constant refrain for my friends
back in England that goes something like:
"The problem with grad school is that the
work never stops; there's always something
to do."This is true, but misleading.
Sure, the work never stops. Yeah, there's al
ways something that needs to be done. But,you

know there's another way of looking at this.
You see, if you always have stuff to do,
then you always have time to do it. If your life
is a constant stream of work, then you should
feel free to take your breaks when you want,
and damn the consequences.
On some terribly depressing but funda
mental level, we're here to work. In fact, we
love to work (well, in theory at least) and, as
a consequence, we often take our freedom
for granted — by ignoring it.
How many times have you told yourself
that you would go out on some particular
evening only to be foiled by the dangerous al
lure of esoteric knowledge and the nagging
sense that this "going out" business should be
left to the weekend?
Now, I'm all for the acquisition of knowl
edge (we wouldn't, after all. want it left in the
hands of the masses), but you shouldn't let
get in the way of a cold beer too often.
During those occasional (once or twice an
hour) periods of remorse for the life I left be
hind, I have been know to seek out advice on
how best to deal with grad life.
The most frequent recommendation is to
treat school like a job: Wake up, go to work.

come home and pretend you're a grown up.
While this isn't necessarily a bad way to stay
sane, it is, however, kind of pathetic.
Routine is the worst thing about being an
adult. Embracing it may make you feel a lit
tle more in control of your existence, but such
control is both illusory and not nearly as
much fun as a lliesday morning margarita.
Like most things, though, there is a flip
side to pre-noon cocktails — the freedom to
drink at any hour only really exists alongside
the freedom to work at any hour. That is to
say, there are no lunchtime Long Islands
without an equal number of Saturday night
study sessions.
Grad school can kill you. It can drag you
down to the floor and beat you to a bloody
pulp, until there is nothing left of your human
spark.
Hmmm. On reflection, that previous
paragraph may have involved the very slight
est touch of exaggeration. You won't actually
be pummelled — it will just feel that way.
However, there's no need to conform. You
can choose to embrace your imprisonment
by using your autonomy to break free from
the strictures of convention. You can walk
the path of liberty and spurn the dull allure of
ordinariness. You can...
Well, you get the idea. And even if you
don't buy that sort of pseudo-highbrow chat
ter, remember that a stiff 9 a.m. drink takes
the edge off most things.

Go on. Take the day off. You know you want to.
