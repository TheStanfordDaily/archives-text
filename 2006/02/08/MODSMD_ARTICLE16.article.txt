Most beloved columnist?
David Blackman. in his most recent and
thankfully last column, thought this was an
acceptable way to open a door to his parting
thoughts: "How do I end my run of being the
most beloved Daily columnist since Joel
Stein?"
Erroneous? I think so.
I wrote some 85 odd columns over three
years for The Daily; an anonymous woman
took out ads in the Daily to profess her love
for my column; columnists, bloggers and a
Field Hockey team quoted me in numerous
rants and raves; and I drove a freaking red
GMC Suburban with a license plate reading
"MJESTC" — and. still. I don't think I was
the most beloved columnist since Joel Stein.
Blackman, on the other hand — after his
30-something odd column detailing the rea
son why no girl will date him or something, I
lost interest after gathering that he was wast
ing my time — claims to be "beloved."
Hmm.a Google search reveals that he is run
ning second in the "Hi. My name is David
Blackman" race to a producer of "Ice
Princess." Also, his blog with zero comments
is apparently as beloved as Detroit.
All I'm saying is that before Blackman
starts electing himself to the Stanford Daily

columnist Hall of Fame, maybe he should
read the likes of Dan McCarthy, Mac Levine
and countless others whose portfolios may
just be a bit more distinguished, though not
nearly as distinguished as mine.

Readers must choose for themselves
I was very disappointed by Robbie Yan's
article yesterday, "Head of China Google
Speaks on Spotlight."The article elaborates
in great detail on Kaifu Lee's presentation
but relegates mention of the protests taking
place outside of the event to the very last
sentence. Balanced journalism is not
achieved by simply avoiding to report on a
conflict of views and opinions. I do not ex
pect Mr. Yan to devote an inordinate
amount of space to coverage of the protests.
He would, however, be well advised to ex
plore both sides of an issue in the future to
give readers the opportunity to choose for
themselves where they stand, rather than
making that choice for them.
