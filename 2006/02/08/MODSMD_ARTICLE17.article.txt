## Feast of Darwin ad nauseum 
### TRISTAN ABBEY 
Millions of Catholics around the world
will observe the Feast of Our Lady of Lour
des this Saturday. The celebration commem
orates the appearance of the Blessed Virgin
Mary to a young French girl named
Bernadette nearly a century and half ago. Ri
valing the Church's intensity of devotion, ad
mirers of Charles Darwin will honor their
hero with a series of events on the following
day, with the festivities stretching from Aus
tralia to Bangladesh, from Chile to Ireland.
Stanford's very own Students for Rational
Thought will participate in the celebration
here on campus.
The utter absence of revelry on a global
scale in honor of any other scientist should give
us pause. National Mole Day, celebrated on
Oct. 23, recognizes Avogrado's Number and,
insofar as chemistry teachers across the coun
try annually raise the mole flag at 6:02 a.m.,
seems to be Darwin Day's only contender.

Where are the fervent Galileo fans, the
diehard Newton devotees, and the avid Edison
aficionados? What makes Darwin so special?
The answer lies not so much in his scientif
ic work (after all, in terms of sheer utility,
Edison's light bulb surely beats Darwin's
finch beak observations), but more in the
philosophical tendencies of those who pro
pound neo-Darwinism â€” the belief that
purely random variation and natural selec
tion account for the complexity of life.
Michael Ruse, a great philosopher of science
who has sparred on countless occasions with
intelligent design theorists and creationists,
writes in "The Evolution-Creation Struggle"
that by the time Darwin had published "On
the Origin of Species," "evolution had been
in the air for a long time, and many people
had been looking for a reason to believe it."
Darwin, who, according to Ruse, is "one of
the most ardent social progressionists of the
nineteenth century," provided that reason.
The fact that the Silicon Valley Humanist

Community, which is dedicated to progress, is
co-sponsoring Darwin Day at Stanford is
anything but random.
Darwin's most vocal defenders are the
first to acknowledge why Darwinian evolu
tion is so important. The late Stephen Jay
Gould asserted, "before Darwin, we thought
that a benevolent God had created us." Simi
larly, Richard Dawkins explained that "Dar
win made it possible to be an intellectually
fulfilled atheist." Daniel Dennett, whose
book,"Darwin's Dangerous Idea," will play a
prominent role in Darwin Day at Stanford,
claims that "God is, like Santa Claus, a myth
of childhood, not anything a sane, undeluded
adult could literally believe in." The latest
Humanist Manifesto, signed by Dawkins and
Dennett, declares: "Humans are an integral
part of nature, the result of unguided evolu
tionary change."
Darwin deserves a place of honor. That
