## Providing Hamas aid would be unethical 
### ROSS DAVID BAYER 
Apparently questioning whether it is eth
ical to give financial aid to a terrorist organi
zation is undemocratic, according to articles
by Olivia Sohns ("A historical take on the
Hamas election," Feb. 6) and Ahmed Ashraf
("Hear Hamas out." Feb. 6). This is a popular
attack based on the fact that the United
States obviously did not like the results of the
Palestinian election, but it is simply childish
to imply that its current withholding of aid is
merely retaliation for undesired results.
First, let us end any pretense that Hamas
is not a terrorist organization. It is not labeled
as terrorist as part of a Western ploy — as
Sohns suggests — it openly takes responsi
bility for suicide bombings that kill civilians.
If this is not terrorism, nothing is.
Someone who cannot unequivocally
admit that Hamas is a terrorist organization
can scarcely be interested in a genuinely
open debate based on facts. Sohns proceeded
to go to lengths to justify calling the Israeli
government as terrorist as Hamas — the
most radical and extremist of Palestinian
movements — based on the fact that it elect
ed leaders accused or convicted by outside
bodies of past crimes. If we view electing one
leader with past alleged crimes as equivalent
to electing an armed organization currently
and proudly taking claim for crimes still
being carried out and committed to ongoing
violence, then be aware that the South
African government under Nelson Mandela
would also have been a terrorist organiza
tion. I agree with Sohns that it is simplistic to
presume that the Palestinian vote for Hamas
was purely out of a desire to support terror
ism. However, admitting that Hamas is a ter
rorist organization is not a judgment of the
Palestinian people, but a straightforward

judgment of Hamas.
With that cleared up, let us analyze the
equivalence between questioning the ethics
of giving funds to a terrorist organization and
undermining democracy. Let us carefully con
sider a hypothetical time in which the United
States was giving aid to Germany in the 1930's
when the Nazi regime came to power. If the
United States decided to halt its aid. would
anyone in their right mind see this as Ameri
ca having a problem with democracy? (Just to
be clear, I am not comparing Hamas directly
to a Nazi regime, but merely making the point
that withholding aid is not necessarily a ques
tion of democracy).The problem indicated by
the United States — and even the European
Union, which is generally viewed as sympa
thetic to the Palestinian cause — is clearly
with terrorism, not with democracy. That is
why offers have been made to keep offering
aid if terrorism is renounced.
Sohns and Ashraf boldly state that a
Hamas victory' should be seen as beneficial
because it will likely cause Hamas to moder
ate its views. There is only one problem with
this assumption: it completely flies in the face
of the statements issued by Hamas itself. I,
too, shared this hope, initially, but Hamas's
leader, Mahmoud Al-Zahar. explicitly stated
that Hamas would only see a two-state settle
ment as a temporary stepping stone, that if a
decisive victory cannot be achieved in this
generation, the task of freeing all Palestinian
soil will be inherited by the coming genera
tions. "Palestine means Palestine in its entire
ty— from the [Mediterranean] sea to the
[Jordan] river We cannot give up a single
inch of it. Therefore, we will not recognize a
single inch of the Israeli enemy." Maybe peo
ple believe that more time is needed to
change Hamas's views, but unfortunately
Hamas asserts that would be against their re

ligion and a sign of corruption.
In fact, the consequences of failing to de
mand moderation in return for aid would he
disastrous. Sohns claims that Hamas "will
likely moderate its views so it can engage
with other groups through compromise," yet
criticizes the United States for actually re
quiring moderation or compromise before it
engages in providing aid. It is preposterous to
expect the recipient of aid, rather than the
benefactor, to dictate terms. The United
States cannot support a terrorist organiza
tion without any demands for moderation
and then expect them to moderate in order to
gain support. Nobody has failed to give
Hamas a chance, as Ashraf claims.The Unit
ed States, the European Union, and Israel
have all promised to continue subsidizing the
government, if only it ends its commitment to
violence and to completely wiping out its
enemy. Are these unreasonable demands? Is
this failing to give Hamas a chance?
Refusing to provide aid to Hamas is, in
fact, the only bargaining tool on the table to
try to get Hamas to moderate.
Unfortunately, Hamas has refused to lay
down arms or even acknowledge its enemy's
right to exist. Hamas is no peace partner. This
is not my opinion — it is, sadly, what its lead
ers themselves say. If Hamas continues to re
fuse to moderate, it is clearly unethical to
contribute money to a group whose stated
purpose is to use its funds to kill civilians.
Programs such as filtering aid for the
Palestinian people through United Nations
channels which will contribute directly to the
people could perhaps be a more promising
strategy.
