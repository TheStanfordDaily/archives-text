## THROUGH my eyes Juggling NEW FOUND LEADERSHIP "I'm impressed by the unique level of camaraderie our team has." ANNE YELSEY, junior 
### MIA LEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Welcome to the second edition of
" Ihrough My Eyes" — a Daily under
taking to give Stanford athletes a more
personal stake in the news. Following up
on last week's piece from tennis all-star
senior Amber Liu, junior Anne Yelsey
clues us in to more inner workings of the
top-ranked Stanford women's tennis
team. Here she is. fresh off a 4 -0 sweep of
Texas at the National Team Indoor
Championship this past weekend:
Rising in the ranks
lliis year, I play the role of an upper
classman. I feel like I'm a quieter leader,
[hut] that 1 still help to motivate the un
derclassmen. I'm always looking to help
them out, Meghan [Doheny] and Jessica

[Nguyen], and I'm amazed at how well
they've adapted to college life.
We're fortunate to have the "benevo
lent dictatorship" of our four seniors
when you have four seniors on a team of
11 people, that's a huge chunk. The four
seniors make decisions that we have to
joke about. It's the little things: getting
team dinners together; picking out our
uniforms; doing the talks in team hud
dles; and pumping everybody up for
workouts when we don't want to be at
practice.
Meanwhile, I play more of a role in
promoting team unity off the courts. I'm
always encouraging more team dinners
and planning downtime together. I or in
stance, Sunday was I .ejla's [I lodzic] birth
day, and we had all just flown in from the
tournament in Wisconsin. We didn't get in

until 10 p.m., so we all spent four
hours in Potter Lounge baking and
hanging out. We're also big on
"Gray's Anatomy," so luckily we got
to see a taping of Sunday's show.
Even though we spend nearly 30
hours per week training and compet
ing in matches, we make sure to spend
extra time every week having some
fun. Despite the time crunch, it's
something we all choose. All of us on
the team have played competitively
at the national and international
level, which can involve a lot of trav
eling and time spent alone. It's all in
dividual at the junior level as well, so
our togetherness at Stanford is a wel
come and much-needed break.
Rolling with the punches
Theresa [Logar], the other junior
on our squad, and I have bonded real
ly well in the past couple of years.
She's just a tad louder than 1 am.
Theresa is one of those people that
can turn anything into a punch line. 1
have a drier sense of humor and 1 feel
like we feed off one another; we could
fill up a whole book with our jokes.
Speaking of Theresa, I have to
share this: Last year when we went to
the White House after winning
NCAA's, we had just met the Presi
dent and were heading down a stair
case towards the South Room. As the
band was playing our fight song,
Theresa cautioned, "Okay, nobody
trip down the stairs."
A few seconds later, Theresa
tripped down the stairs. She's just a lit
tle bit clumsy, you know?

Making a name
Just like Amber [Liu] pointed out,
we're a very close-knit team and we
have to have nicknames for each
other.The team calls me "Klegger" or
"Kltggy," after my middle name.
Amber thought of it — she's the ge
nius when it comes to nicknames, and
she has thought of almost all of them
on the team. 1 find it hilarious because
it's not a part of my name that 1 adver
tise. We once played in southern Cali
fornia, where I'm from, and the whole
team was yelling "Klegger." My fami
ly was there too, full of confused
looks.
Leading a legacy
1 am still really good friends with
girls who have already graduated.
Lauren [Barnikow] and Emilia [An
derson], who were seniors when I was
a freshman, called everyday while we
were at last week's tournament. The
same goes for players who graduated
last year, Erin [Burdette] and Kara
[Guzman]. They were all looking at
live scoring online and stayed really
up-to-date on the matches.
For our NCAA tournament, past
team members are going to be an in
dispensable part of our cheering
squad. I'm completely impressed by
the unique level of camaraderie that
our team has.
The rate of transfers at other
schools has definitely increased, and
at tournaments like the Indoors you
get a sense that some teams are lack
ing that unity. Other big players out
there might view their college experi
ence as a mere transition to the pro
circuit.
Our squad is even closer now that
we have so many people from Cali
fornia, eight of 11 in fact.
I hope that having so many in

state players will help increase match
attendance. On that note, I think
we're pushing to get more Stanford
students out to the courts.They're the
ones who make the matches exciting
and a lot of people don't realize that.
College tennis is a much different
atmosphere than what people think it
is. People see tennis on TV and expect
that you can only clap and that you al
ways have to be quiet. But here you
can be as loud as you want to — there
are plenty of breaks between points
for that.
And if I had to make any recom
mendations out there for would-be
spectators, I would highly recom
mend coming at the start of the
matches to watch the doubles. It's
very quick, the crowd is most lively
then and it's always the tightest part
of the match. We go out there all the
time expecting a tough match, and
that's usually what we get.
1 think the Cardinal Court Club
has provided a great opportunity for
students to get involved that way; I
know Dick [Gould] and Amy
[Brown] have worked so hard to pro
mote the organization.
Not as easy as it looks
I think the common perception is
that we go out there and kill our op
ponents. They look at our 62-0 record
but don't realize that we have a lot of
close matches that can come down to
the last minute. When we played
Texas this weekend, the tallied score
was 4-0, but we had been losing on
three courts. The truth is, we've been
in some tight match situations, and I
think those instances will come up
again when we play California,
Southern California, and UCLA, all
of whom have very good teams this
vear.

Lauren [Barnikow] and Emilia [An
derson], who were seniors when I was
a freshman, called everyday while we
were at last week's tournament. The
same goes for players who graduated
last year, Erin [Burdette] and Kara
[Guzman]. They were all looking at
live scoring online and stayed really
up-to-date on the matches.
For our NCAA tournament, past
team members are going to be an in
dispensable part of our cheering
squad. I'm completely impressed by
the unique level of camaraderie that
our team has.
The rate of transfers at other
schools has definitely increased, and
at tournaments like the Indoors you
get a sense that some teams are lack
ing that unity. Other big players out
there might view their college experi
ence as a mere transition to the pro
circuit.
Our squad is even closer now that
we have so many people from Cali
fornia, eight of 11 in fact.
I hope that having so many in

state players will help increase match
attendance. On that note, I think
we're pushing to get more Stanford
students out to the courts.They're the
ones who make the matches exciting
and a lot of people don't realize that.
College tennis is a much different
atmosphere than what people think it
is. People see tennis on TV and expect
that you can only clap and that you al
ways have to be quiet. But here you
can be as loud as you want to — there
are plenty of breaks between points
for that.
And if I had to make any recom
mendations out there for would-be
spectators, I would highly recom
mend coming at the start of the
matches to watch the doubles. It's
very quick, the crowd is most lively
then and it's always the tightest part
of the match. We go out there all the
time expecting a tough match, and
that's usually what we get.
1 think the Cardinal Court Club
has provided a great opportunity for
students to get involved that way; I
know Dick [Gould] and Amy
[Brown] have worked so hard to pro
mote the organization.
Not as easy as it looks
I think the common perception is
that we go out there and kill our op
ponents. They look at our 62-0 record
but don't realize that we have a lot of
close matches that can come down to
the last minute. When we played
Texas this weekend, the tallied score
was 4-0, but we had been losing on
three courts. The truth is, we've been
in some tight match situations, and I
think those instances will come up
again when we play California,
Southern California, and UCLA, all
of whom have very good teams this
vear.
Welcome to the second edition of
" Ihrough My Eyes" — a Daily under
taking to give Stanford athletes a more
personal stake in the news. Following up
on last week's piece from tennis all-star
senior Amber Liu, junior Anne Yelsey
clues us in to more inner workings of the
top-ranked Stanford women's tennis
team. Here she is. fresh off a 4 -0 sweep of
Texas at the National Team Indoor
Championship this past weekend:
Rising in the ranks
lliis year, I play the role of an upper
classman. I feel like I'm a quieter leader,
[hut] that 1 still help to motivate the un
derclassmen. I'm always looking to help
them out, Meghan [Doheny] and Jessica

[Nguyen], and I'm amazed at how well
they've adapted to college life.
We're fortunate to have the "benevo
lent dictatorship" of our four seniors
when you have four seniors on a team of
11 people, that's a huge chunk. The four
seniors make decisions that we have to
joke about. It's the little things: getting
team dinners together; picking out our
uniforms; doing the talks in team hud
dles; and pumping everybody up for
workouts when we don't want to be at
practice.
Meanwhile, I play more of a role in
promoting team unity off the courts. I'm
always encouraging more team dinners
and planning downtime together. I or in
stance, Sunday was I .ejla's [I lodzic] birth
day, and we had all just flown in from the
tournament in Wisconsin. We didn't get in

year on the team and shares with The Stanford Daily her story.
until 10 p.m., so we all spent four
hours in Potter Lounge baking and
hanging out. We're also big on
"Gray's Anatomy," so luckily we got
to see a taping of Sunday's show.
Even though we spend nearly 30
hours per week training and compet
ing in matches, we make sure to spend
extra time every week having some
fun. Despite the time crunch, it's
something we all choose. All of us on
the team have played competitively
at the national and international
level, which can involve a lot of trav
eling and time spent alone. It's all in
dividual at the junior level as well, so
our togetherness at Stanford is a wel
come and much-needed break.
Rolling with the punches
Theresa [Logar], the other junior
on our squad, and I have bonded real
ly well in the past couple of years.
She's just a tad louder than 1 am.
Theresa is one of those people that
can turn anything into a punch line. 1
have a drier sense of humor and 1 feel
like we feed off one another; we could
fill up a whole book with our jokes.
Speaking of Theresa, I have to
share this: Last year when we went to
the White House after winning
NCAA's, we had just met the Presi
dent and were heading down a stair
case towards the South Room. As the
band was playing our fight song,
Theresa cautioned, "Okay, nobody
trip down the stairs."
A few seconds later, Theresa
tripped down the stairs. She's just a lit
tle bit clumsy, you know?

Making a name
Just like Amber [Liu] pointed out,
we're a very close-knit team and we
have to have nicknames for each
other.The team calls me "Klegger" or
"Kltggy," after my middle name.
Amber thought of it — she's the ge
nius when it comes to nicknames, and
she has thought of almost all of them
on the team. 1 find it hilarious because
it's not a part of my name that 1 adver
tise. We once played in southern Cali
fornia, where I'm from, and the whole
team was yelling "Klegger." My fami
ly was there too, full of confused
looks.
