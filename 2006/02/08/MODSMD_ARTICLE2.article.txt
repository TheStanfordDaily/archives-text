### SHIRIN SHARIF SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Tom Brokaw and Vartan Gregorian
were announced yesterday as Stanford's
2(X)6 Commencement speakers for the un
dergraduate and graduate student cere
monies, respectively. Brokaw was an NBC
news anchor for almost 40 years and also
authored the bestseller, "The Greatest
Generation." Gregorian is president of the
Carnegie Corporation and former presi
dent of both the New York Public Library
and Brown University.

"Tom Brokaw represents the very best
of the journalistic tradition and has a
unique perspective on some of the most
critical events of our recent history" said
University President John Hennessy in a
press release."And,as a Stanford parent, he
knows our university well. 1 look forward to
hearing his observations and insights, as
well as the advice he has to offer to both our
graduates and their families."
Brokaw was a reporter for NBC News'
"Today Show" and "NBC Nightly News
with Tom Brokaw," which became the most
watched news program during his time on
the air. He reported on major events such as
Watergate, the dismantling of the Berlin
Wall and the Oklahoma City bombings. He
also conducted the first American TV inter
views with Mikhail Gorbachev and

Vladimir Putin. Brokaw's books have led to
sequels and more than five million copies
have been sold.
Gregorian is an educator and author
who has undergraduate and graduate de
grees from Stanford. His awards include the
National Humanities Medal and the Presi
dential Medal of Freedom.
"Dr. Gregorian brings with him the wis
dom of a lifetime of intellectual and profes
sional accomplishments," Hennessy said.
"His academic career had an auspicious be
ginning with his Ph.D. work at Stanford,
and his reflections will be a perfect cap
stone for the achievements of our graduate
students at a time of great pride for them
and their families."
The graduate and undergraduate Com
mencement ceremonies will be held on

June 17 and 18 respectively. Hennessey also
announced yesterday that San Francisco
Archbishop George Niederauer will be this
year's Baccalaureate speaker on June 17.
While there was some concern that the
two separate ceremonies might impact the
selection and funding for two individual
speakers. Jeff Wachtel, senior assistant to
President 1 lennessy, said that this was not
the case. Stanford is holding two Com
mencement ceremonies on smaller Elliot
Held this year due to the renovation of
Stanford Stadium. The University decided
to host two ceremonies in order to accom
modate as many family members as possi
ble.

harder and our budget had no impact on the selection, al
though it is more expensive to get two speakers," Wachtel
said. "We thought it was too much to ask of one person to
do two ceremonies."
Brokaw was on the "short list" of speakers submitted
to Hennessey by the senior class presidents, who used on
line suggestions from seniors and their own research to
compile the list. Wachtel would not specify the number of
candidates on the list.
"We think the senior class will be excited about hav
ing an accomplished high-profile speaker who will be
able to draw on his extensive life experiences to deliver
a great commencement speech," said senior James
Mitchell, one of the senior class presidents.
The speakers who generally agree to speak at Com
mencements have some connection to the University.
The "token" honoraria given to them is small relative to
what they receive for other speaking engagements, ac
cording to Wachtel, and it is often donated back to the
University or to other causes. Brokaw's connection to
Stanford is his daughter, Jennifer, who graduated from
the University in 1988. Brokaw previously donated his
services to a School of Education event in May 2004 that
helped raise $ 1 million, along with comedian Bill Cosby.
Asked about the selection of Brokaw, senior Adam
Edris responded, "It's like...whatever. He's an anchor
man, right?"
"He's non-controversial, I guess, but he's not some
one I'm excited about," Edris added.
"I think it's great that we are bringing someone who
is so recognizable and so well-respected," said senior
Sean Bruich. "In a lot of ways, Tom Brokaw represents
what Stanford students should hope to become: well-in
formed about current events with a healthy skepticism
toward our government founded on a sincere sense of
patriotism."
Brokaw is similar to last year's speaker, Apple Chief
Executive Officer Steve Jobs, in that he is also a college
drop out. Brokaw left the University of lowa, where he
says he majored in "beer and coeds," and later trans
ferred to the University of South Dakota where he
earned a bachelor's degree in political science.
"I didn't submit any suggestions online, but based on
our past speakers, Brokaw should provide a change of
pace," said senior JD Ridgeway. "He is not politically
driven, so he might provide a more objective perspec
tive."
To select the graduate student Commencement
speaker. University staff spoke to a handful of graduate
students who were recommended to them by the Grad
uate Student Council to find out what kinds of speakers
they were considering. Wachtel said that Gregorian
seemed to match these students' requests.
"Graduate students are less involved, concerned with
who the speaker is [than undergraduates]," Wachtel
said.
Some graduate students said they were a little disap
pointed by the relatively lower name-recognition of
Gregorian in comparison to Brokaw.
"I had never heard of Gregarian before this an
nouncement-he is not as big a rock star as Tom Brokaw,
but his focus on philanthropy at the Carnegie may pro
vide some good insight," said Aamir Virani, a graduate
student in electrical engineering. "We all have grand vi
sions for our futures, and most of us want to better the
world in some way, but it will all depend on how he de
livers the message. I don't want to fall asleep."

"I think its great that we are bringing someone
who is so recognizable and so well-respected
