# WRESTLING
## Meets end with mixed results; top two teams are up next Senior Ray Blake victorious over No. 6 in the country 
### DENIS GRIFFIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Wrestling closed out its home dual-meet
schedule this weekend, facing three Pacific-10
Conference rivals in a 24-hour span. Once
again, it was the hot-and-cold Stanford team
that showed up.
But, nevertheless, the weekend concluded
with more ups than downs for the Cardinal,
with the team winning two of the three meets.

"I think we're right where we thought we
would be," redshirt freshman heavyweight
Jared Boyer said. " But. at the same time, we
still have so much improvement to make be
fore the Pac-10 Tournament."
No. 9 Stanford (7-5.4-2 Pac-10) started the
weekend with a 22-15 Friday afternoon victo
ry over the No. 4 Oregon Ducks (6-6, 4-5).
Without question, the highlight of the dual was
165-pound senior captain Ray Blake's win in
double overtime against 16-0 Joey Braca
monte. Blake entered the third period down 6-
2. but battled back to a tie in regulation's clos
ing seconds.
"Ihat guy's ranked sixth in the country,"
coach Kerry McCoy said."l le's the number-one

guy in the Pac-10, he was the Pac-10 Champ last
year and lie beat Ray earlier this year,so for a lot
of reasons that was a big match."
McCoy praised Blake's effort and tough
ness in fighting hack for the victory.
"Really, that match just came out ol hard
work," McCoy said. "(Bracamonte] thought
he could get ahead and just sit on his lead, hut
Ray didn't stop and just kept going. It was a
great way for Ray to finish out his home career
putting himself in a position to he an All-
American national champ."
Technically, though, Blake's home season
wasn't quite over yet. I le and 149-pound soph
omore Josh /upancic were the only two ("ardi
nal wrestlers to earn wins in the match against

No. 3 Oregon State (12-2-1, 7-1) later that
evening, as Stanford fell to the Beavers, 28-7.
Perhaps the defining moment of this match
came with 125-pound sophomore captain Tan
ner Gardner's loss to Eric Stevenson of the
Beavers to start the dual. Gardner went into
the match ranked No. 10 in the nation, and had
several shots — quick moves designed to gain
control of an opponent's leg — that were near
ly successful and would likely have changed
the entire tone of the match.
"If he finishes one of those shots, he wins
the match," McCoy said. "And the guy scored
off of two of Tanner's attacks. So it was difficult.

son was just a fluke and that they are ready for the spring season.
but it's just one of those things that
happens in wrestling."
The Cardinal then closed out the
weekend with a 40-7 rout of the No. 10
Portland State Vikings (2-15, 0-6).
Stanford's senior wrestlers were hon
ored in a ceremony prior to the last
dual meet of their careers at Burnham
Pavilion.
Also of note this weekend was the
continued improvement of redshirt
freshman Luke Feist (174 pounds)
and Boyer. Boyer won one of his two
matches over the weekend, while
Feist scored a pin and a major deci
sion in his two victories, out of three
total matches.
"[Luke and 1] have had tough
matches," Boyer said. "We've had
tough stretches where we were look
ing to get a win where we could. But
really 1 just think the overall experi
ence of getting out and competing is
going to be so valuable for us in the
years to come."
McCoy said that he has seen a lot
of progress from his younger
wrestlers this season.
"The funny thing that 1 had to do
over the first few weeks of the season
was to keep reminding myself that
Luke, Jared, Eric [Minnick] and Tyler
[Parker) —they're all freshmen,"
McCoy said. "And we expect a lot
from these guys. As freshmen they've
done a great job."
The Cardinal take to the road this
week, and will face No. 2 Cal Poly on
Friday and top-ranked Arizona State
on Sunday.
