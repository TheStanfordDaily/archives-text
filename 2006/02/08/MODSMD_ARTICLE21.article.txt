# Don't go M.I.A. on the NHL
## 
### 
You might have missed this,
but the NHL is back. Most
of you probably never even
realized that it went away. That
surprising lack of hockey high
lights on Sports Center that we all
enjoyed for a year — it's over.
Actually, believe it or not, hock
ey has been back for a few months
now. And until a few weeks ago, no
one could have cared less then me.
For me, the year-long absence
of hockey as really rich players and
really, really rich owners struggled
to reach a new collective bargain
ing agreement was a relief. I wasn't
forced to look at Barry Melrose's
horrible mullet as he ranted about
how some guy from the Czech Re
public was able to skate with cat
like agility. I was saved from hock
ey games running late and cutting
off sports programming I actually
cared about. No longer did I have
to watch highlights of a game that
ended in a 0-0 tie.
So I was understandably skepti
cal when my friend invited me to
go see a San Jose Sharks game. For
clarification purposes, yes, there is
a professional hockey team in San
Jose. In 1991 someone had the in
genius idea that what the Bay Area
was missing was an NHL franchise,
and thus the Sharks were born. 15
years later, the Sharks still get
about as much publicity as J.V.
girls' high school soccer. It's hard
to get people excited about a sport
played on ice when it's 65 degrees
and sunny in mid-February.
But, despite my biases, I took
my buddy up on the offer. At the
very least I would get to see some
big guys crash into each other at
dangerous speeds, and if I was
lucky, I might witness the most sa
cred of hockey traditions — the
dropping of the gloves, or two
brutish enforcers awkwardly try to
punch each other while pulling
each others' jerseys over their
heads.
So we made the trek to HP
Pavilion (one of the best names of
any sports arena, by the way) and
found our seats, which were sur
prisingly good. And for the next
two-and-a-half hours, I was thor
oughly entertained. After years of
hating, ignoring and bashing hock
ey, I found myself rabidly cheering
for a team that had exactly three
players I could name (Joe Thorn
ton, Jonathan Cheechoo and
Evgeni Nabokov). The Sharks
ended up losing in a shootout and I
didn't see any blood, but that expe
