# Don't go M.I.A. on the NHL
## 
### 
You might have missed this,
but the NHL is back. Most
of you probably never even
realized that it went away. That
surprising lack of hockey high
lights on Sports Center that we all
enjoyed for a year — it's over.
Actually, believe it or not, hock
ey has been back for a few months
now. And until a few weeks ago, no
one could have cared less then me.
For me, the year-long absence
of hockey as really rich players and
really, really rich owners struggled
to reach a new collective bargain
ing agreement was a relief. I wasn't
forced to look at Barry Melrose's
horrible mullet as he ranted about
how some guy from the Czech Re
public was able to skate with cat
like agility. I was saved from hock
ey games running late and cutting
off sports programming I actually
cared about. No longer did I have
to watch highlights of a game that
ended in a 0-0 tie.
So I was understandably skepti
cal when my friend invited me to
go see a San Jose Sharks game. For
clarification purposes, yes, there is
a professional hockey team in San
Jose. In 1991 someone had the in
genius idea that what the Bay Area
was missing was an NHL franchise,
and thus the Sharks were born. 15
years later, the Sharks still get
about as much publicity as J.V.
girls' high school soccer. It's hard
to get people excited about a sport
played on ice when it's 65 degrees
and sunny in mid-February.
But, despite my biases, I took
my buddy up on the offer. At the
very least I would get to see some
big guys crash into each other at
dangerous speeds, and if I was
lucky, I might witness the most sa
cred of hockey traditions — the
dropping of the gloves, or two
brutish enforcers awkwardly try to
punch each other while pulling
each others' jerseys over their
heads.
So we made the trek to HP
Pavilion (one of the best names of
any sports arena, by the way) and
found our seats, which were sur
prisingly good. And for the next
two-and-a-half hours, I was thor
oughly entertained. After years of
hating, ignoring and bashing hock
ey, I found myself rabidly cheering
for a team that had exactly three
players I could name (Joe Thorn
ton, Jonathan Cheechoo and
Evgeni Nabokov). The Sharks
ended up losing in a shootout and I
didn't see any blood, but that expe

What Bonanza!
rience has totally changed my out
look on the NHL.
I realized that hockey is a great
game. I can finally understand why
people missed it during the lock
out. It is intense, fast-paced and ex
citing, and you get to boo an oppos
ing player when he gets hurt. It
took me a little while to figure out
all the rules, 1 still can't pronounce
the names of 95 percent of the
players in the league and I hate the
actual Sharks mascot, Sharkie (he
tackled me when I refused to give
him a high-five, and as a result I got
his disgusting used car smell all
over my clothes). Nevertheless, 1
am hooked.
Since my first encounter with
the Sharks, I have even started tun
ing into some of the games on TV.
Of course I was just as mad as the
next guy when the Stanford-Ari
zona game was preempted by the
Sharks-Senators telecast, but other
than that, 1 have actually been
checking to see when games are
coming on. I can't help myself. The
notion that hockey loses some
thing in the transition to TV is ab
solutely true — it is hard to see the
puck, you can't see the plays devel
op, etc. — but it is still compelling
and entertaining. Any day of the
week, I would rather throw on the
Sharks-Kings game over watching
Michael Irvin talk about Jerome
Bettis playing his final game in De
troit for the second straight week.
The changes that the NHL

made after the lockout have
helped as well. I've been to two
games that were tied at the end of
regulation and overtime. In previ
ous years I would have been sent
home with an unfulfilling tie, but
this year, the NHL has instituted
shootouts after five minutes of
overtime.
If a tie is like getting kicked in
the nuts, watching a shootout is
like kicking someone else in the
nuts. Unlike soccer, the player
skates the length of the ice and
goes one-on-one with the goalie.
The five seconds as the player
skates down the ice with the crowd
going wild are just about as dra
matic as any in sports.
The bug has hit me so hard I ac
tually asked for a San Jose jersey
for the holidays. While I look about
as threatening as Taj Finger when
ever 1 walk around in the Sharks'
teal and black, I just feel like a big
man with a giant shark biting a
hockey stick on my chest. I've worn
it to the two games I've been to
since my first encounter with the
new NHL, and I feel like 1 now fit
in with the hockey crowd.
So check out the Sharks, or any
NHL game for that matter — un
less of course there is football, bas
ketball, baseball, "Survivor," "24,"
professional wrestling, college
women's lacrosse or "The View"

Alex Gyr is a junior who has never
watched "The View,"no matter what
anyone says. E-tnail him at
agyr@stanford.edu or find him in
his Sharks jersey cussing at
Avalanche fans at an upcoming
game.

actual Sharks mascot, Sharkie (he
tackled me when I refused to give
him a high-five, and as a result I got
his disgusting used car smell all
over my clothes). Nevertheless, 1
am hooked.
Since my first encounter with
the Sharks, I have even started tun
ing into some of the games on TV.
Of course I was just as mad as the
next guy when the Stanford-Ari
zona game was preempted by the
Sharks-Senators telecast, but other
than that, 1 have actually been
checking to see when games are
coming on. I can't help myself. The
notion that hockey loses some
thing in the transition to TV is ab
solutely true — it is hard to see the
puck, you can't see the plays devel
op, etc. — but it is still compelling
and entertaining. Any day of the
week, I would rather throw on the
Sharks-Kings game over watching
Michael Irvin talk about Jerome
Bettis playing his final game in De
troit for the second straight week.
The changes that the NHL

made after the lockout have
helped as well. I've been to two
games that were tied at the end of
regulation and overtime. In previ
ous years I would have been sent
home with an unfulfilling tie, but
this year, the NHL has instituted
shootouts after five minutes of
overtime.
If a tie is like getting kicked in
the nuts, watching a shootout is
like kicking someone else in the
nuts. Unlike soccer, the player
skates the length of the ice and
goes one-on-one with the goalie.
The five seconds as the player
skates down the ice with the crowd
going wild are just about as dra
matic as any in sports.
The bug has hit me so hard I ac
tually asked for a San Jose jersey
for the holidays. While I look about
as threatening as Taj Finger when
ever 1 walk around in the Sharks'
teal and black, I just feel like a big
man with a giant shark biting a
hockey stick on my chest. I've worn
it to the two games I've been to
since my first encounter with the
new NHL, and I feel like 1 now fit
in with the hockey crowd.
So check out the Sharks, or any
NHL game for that matter — un
less of course there is football, bas
ketball, baseball, "Survivor," "24,"
professional wrestling, college
women's lacrosse or "The View"

You might have missed this,
but the NHL is back. Most
of you probably never even
realized that it went away. That
surprising lack of hockey high
lights on Sports Center that we all
enjoyed for a year — it's over.
Actually, believe it or not, hock
ey has been back for a few months
now. And until a few weeks ago, no
one could have cared less then me.
For me, the year-long absence
of hockey as really rich players and
really, really rich owners struggled
to reach a new collective bargain
ing agreement was a relief. I wasn't
forced to look at Barry Melrose's
horrible mullet as he ranted about
how some guy from the Czech Re
public was able to skate with cat
like agility. I was saved from hock
ey games running late and cutting
off sports programming I actually
cared about. No longer did I have
to watch highlights of a game that
ended in a 0-0 tie.
So I was understandably skepti
cal when my friend invited me to
go see a San Jose Sharks game. For
clarification purposes, yes, there is
a professional hockey team in San
Jose. In 1991 someone had the in
genius idea that what the Bay Area
was missing was an NHL franchise,
and thus the Sharks were born. 15
years later, the Sharks still get
about as much publicity as J.V.
girls' high school soccer. It's hard
to get people excited about a sport
played on ice when it's 65 degrees
and sunny in mid-February.
But, despite my biases, I took
my buddy up on the offer. At the
very least I would get to see some
big guys crash into each other at
dangerous speeds, and if I was
lucky, I might witness the most sa
cred of hockey traditions — the
dropping of the gloves, or two
brutish enforcers awkwardly try to
punch each other while pulling
each others' jerseys over their
heads.
So we made the trek to HP
Pavilion (one of the best names of
any sports arena, by the way) and
found our seats, which were sur
prisingly good. And for the next
two-and-a-half hours, I was thor
oughly entertained. After years of
hating, ignoring and bashing hock
ey, I found myself rabidly cheering
for a team that had exactly three
players I could name (Joe Thorn
ton, Jonathan Cheechoo and
Evgeni Nabokov). The Sharks
ended up losing in a shootout and I
didn't see any blood, but that expe

rience has totally changed my out
look on the NHL.
I realized that hockey is a great
game. I can finally understand why
people missed it during the lock
out. It is intense, fast-paced and ex
citing, and you get to boo an oppos
ing player when he gets hurt. It
took me a little while to figure out
all the rules, 1 still can't pronounce
the names of 95 percent of the
players in the league and I hate the
actual Sharks mascot, Sharkie (he
tackled me when I refused to give
him a high-five, and as a result I got
his disgusting used car smell all
over my clothes). Nevertheless, 1
