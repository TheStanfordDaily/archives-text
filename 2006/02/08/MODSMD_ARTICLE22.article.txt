# After stormy fall, men shoot for bright spring
## Confidence is key in upcoming round in Hawaii 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES STAFF WRITER 
Returning for its spring season, Stan
ford men's golf is ready to prove itself
after a disappointing fall.
The squad had a difficult first five
events in 2(X)5, placing no higher than
sixth and as low as 17th. But today, the
Cardinal will be looking for a fresh start as
they begin the first of three days of com
petition at the Taylor Made Waikoloa in
Kona. Hawaii.
Consistency and confidence plagued
the Cardinal earlier this year, as the squad
often started strong but finished with a
weak third round. However, in their final
invitational in 2005 (the Collegiate Match
Play Championship in mid-November),
the men ended on a high note, defeating
No. 2 Oklahoma State en route to a third
place finish.
"I think the guys know now that those
(top) teams aren't much different from
what we've got," coach Conrad Ray said,
"lying into that idea of having confi
dence, believing you belong and that you
can compete, I think the guys got a taste of

that (in the Match Play Championship],
which is great."
Now, at the end of their off-season, the
Cardinal are hoping to jump back in with
the same high level of confidence and en
thusiasm.
"1 think confidence-wise [we've im
proved in the off-season]," junior Zack
Miller said. "(The Match Play Champi
onship] showed what we were able to do
and it upped the confidence of the team,
proving to other teams and to ourselves
that we're able to compete with the best
out there."
Stanford will get the chance to face off
against "the best out there" this week at
Kona's Waikoloa Village Golf Course.
Along with Oklahoma State, No. 3 Geor
gia Tech and Pac-10 rival Southern Cali
fornia contribute to a strong field.
Miller said that the presence of Okla
homa State will add to the team's confi
dence heading into the tournament.
But confidence is only part of what the
squad is looking to carry into its spring
season. The players have individually re
fined their swings, and Ray expects to see
better play, as well as a refreshed team.
"We worked hard on our fitness this
off-season, and I think our short games
