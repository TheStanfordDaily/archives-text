# After stormy fall, men shoot for bright spring
## Confidence is key in upcoming round in Hawaii 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES STAFF WRITER 
Returning for its spring season, Stan
ford men's golf is ready to prove itself
after a disappointing fall.
The squad had a difficult first five
events in 2(X)5, placing no higher than
sixth and as low as 17th. But today, the
Cardinal will be looking for a fresh start as
they begin the first of three days of com
petition at the Taylor Made Waikoloa in
Kona. Hawaii.
Consistency and confidence plagued
the Cardinal earlier this year, as the squad
often started strong but finished with a
weak third round. However, in their final
invitational in 2005 (the Collegiate Match
Play Championship in mid-November),
the men ended on a high note, defeating
No. 2 Oklahoma State en route to a third
place finish.
"I think the guys know now that those
(top) teams aren't much different from
what we've got," coach Conrad Ray said,
"lying into that idea of having confi
dence, believing you belong and that you
can compete, I think the guys got a taste of

that (in the Match Play Championship],
which is great."
Now, at the end of their off-season, the
Cardinal are hoping to jump back in with
the same high level of confidence and en
thusiasm.
"1 think confidence-wise [we've im
proved in the off-season]," junior Zack
Miller said. "(The Match Play Champi
onship] showed what we were able to do
and it upped the confidence of the team,
proving to other teams and to ourselves
that we're able to compete with the best
out there."
Stanford will get the chance to face off
against "the best out there" this week at
Kona's Waikoloa Village Golf Course.
Along with Oklahoma State, No. 3 Geor
gia Tech and Pac-10 rival Southern Cali
fornia contribute to a strong field.
Miller said that the presence of Okla
homa State will add to the team's confi
dence heading into the tournament.
But confidence is only part of what the
squad is looking to carry into its spring
season. The players have individually re
fined their swings, and Ray expects to see
better play, as well as a refreshed team.
"We worked hard on our fitness this
off-season, and I think our short games
have improved," he said. "We've con
centrated on that and done a good job,
but 1 think more than anything the
guys have gotten their batteries
charged and are looking forward to
some competition."
The Waikoloa course will provide a
challenge for the Cardinal.
"It's the kind of course where,
when the wind doesn't blow, you
have to make a lot of birdies, and the
scores are pretty low." Ray said. "But
the wind can come up; it actually has
been pretty breezy here the past few
days or so. We worked hard the past

couple weeks in preparation, trying
to control our hall play, control the
height, and we're pretty well pre
pared now."
Having faced similar inclement
conditions in the fall, the Cardinal
knew they needed practice dealing
with wind and other weather chal
lenges before the spring season. Ray
described how the team took advan
tage of windy weather on campus
during the past couple of months to
improve their ability to handle such
obstacles.
"We tried to recreate or pretend
that the wind was blowing so that we
could hit certain shots, keep the ball
down, and control our trajectory and
spin with our iron." Ray said. "Hope
fully that'll pay off."
Last year, the Cardinal enjoyed

moderate success at the Waikoloa, as
the team tied for eighth and sopho
more Rob Grube placing seventh.
This year, Grube returns â€” along
with Miller, junior Matt Savage and
freshmen Daniel Lim and Dodge
Kemmer.
"We've got a pretty young lineup
with both freshmen being here, but 1
think they're gaining experience, and
we'll just tee it up on Wednesday and
see what happens,"' Ray said. "I think
the guys feel pretty good about things.
We had some success here last year, so
we'll just go from there."
Miller also noted that despite the
youth of the team, Stanford is looking
forward to a strong showing in
Hawaii.
"The team that we've been com
peting or traveling with thus far has

been pretty young, so getting some
more tournaments under our belt
will just help us improve and give us
the experience that we need to step
up to the next level," he said. "The
more tournaments we play, the bet
ter 1 see us getting."
Having learned from their experi
ence and disappointments of the fall
tournaments,thc Cardinal are looking
for a season turnaround. Both Ray
and Miller expressed the hope that
the Collegiate Match Play Champi
onship was just the start to such a reju
venation.
"I'm looking forward to a lot of
great things this spring," Ray said.
"We're a lot like we were last year,
and we really started to peak when
the spring season unfolded. So hope
fully that'll be the case this year."
