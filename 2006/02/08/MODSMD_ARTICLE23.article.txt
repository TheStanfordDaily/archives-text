# FENCING
## Vegas results are disappointing for Card 
### ANDREW SHEN 
Resembling a playoff-bound NFL team heading
into Week 17, the Stanford fencing team were not at
their best at the competition this weekend in Las
Vegas.
Then again, they had their eyes set on greater goals.
"Overall, it was a good trip, in that it was practice for
San Diego," said junior Matt Burriesci, who finished
22nd in men's sabre.
Stanford's overall success was limited. Senior
Aileen Maloney placed 11th in women's sabre, losing
in her direct elimination round by a one touch. She was
up 14-12, only to lose the next three points.
Sophomore Rebecca lllowski finished 16th, also in
women's sabre.
"I know my fellow women sabre fencers also did not
fence as well as they had hoped," Maloney said. "Since
this was not a collegiate competition, the lesson 1 hope
to draw from this is to rest up well for the upcoming
tournament in San Diego. 1 know I can fence well; I just
need to get in the right mindset to think clearly."
Many of the team's top players did not attend the
competition. In addition, senior Martin Lee, who was
expected to be among the leaders in men's epee, in
jured himself during warm-ups.
"1 am a little disappointed," Lee said."However, the
tournament was just to 'get the rust off and get back
into the competitive mindset. I have high expectations
for this weekend, as I know that we have the ability to
beat all the teams there."
With last weekend's warm-up behind them, the Car
dinal now face their most important challenge to date.
UC San Diego will host a tournament featuring oppo
nents Army, Cal State Fullerton and Air Force.
However, Stanford will be specifically shooting for
a victorious rematch against defending NCAA cham
pion Notre Dame, after losing to them in January.
"1 am personally aiming to beat Notre Dame, par
tially because they are the strongest opponent we'll

face, and partially because 1 have a little score to settle
for one of my bouts in Chicago," Lee said.
Notre Dame's squad includes sophomore Mariel
Zagunis, a gold-medalist at the 2004 Olympics, and
freshman Adrienne Nott, the fourth-ranked foilist in
the nation under twenty.
"Going up against Notre Dame will definitely
makes things tougher for us," junior sabreist Curtis
Andrus said.
"Notre Dame is always a struggle because of their
ability to recruit and influence admissions," said fresh
man Eva Jellison, who went 26-1 during the team's last
collegiate tournament in Chicago.
Nevertheless, the Cardinal remain confident in the
improvements they have made as the season has pro
gressed, especially since the team boasts a core of su
perb underclassmen.
The men's squad lost to Notre Dame 15-12 the pre
vious meeting.
"We were really close last time, and all our hard
work since then should make us more than capable of
topping them this time," said freshman Teddy Levitt,
who is ranked third in the under-19 age group.
Dan Tlicker, another one of the team's five fresh
men, echoed Levitt's sentiments.
"We've got a terrific group of athletes in all three
weapons who are more than capable of bringing Stan
ford to victory at this meet,"Tucker said. "Notre Dame
is definitely a formidable team, but we did not lose to
them by much at Northwestern, and we've only gotten
better since then."
No matter the result, coach Lisa Milgram stresses
she wants to keep the tournament in perspective with
the entire season.
"The tournament at San Diego is a good competi
tion before NCAA Regionals postseason competition
at Air Force Academy. All the teams we compete
against at NCAA Regionals will be at San Diego, so we
get a chance to see our competitors before that week
end," Milgram said.
