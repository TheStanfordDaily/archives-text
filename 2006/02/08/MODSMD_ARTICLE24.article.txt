Baseball's Sorgi lost for season
Stanford third baseman Adam Sorgi will be

lost for the entire 2(X)6 season after undergoing
season-ending surgery on his right shoulder, the
junior confirmed to the Stanford Daily yesterday
afternoon.
The injury leaves the Cardinal without their
most consistent returning offensive player. Last
season, Sorgi lead the team with a .322 hatting
average, five homeruns and 41 RBI.
This past weekend. Stanford used two fresh
men — Austin Yount and Cord Phelps — in
place of Sorgi at third.
"Obviously, it's a hummer that I'm out for the
season, hut I 'm going to help the team as much as
I can from the sidelines," Sorgi said. "I'm looking
to come back 100 percent next season."
