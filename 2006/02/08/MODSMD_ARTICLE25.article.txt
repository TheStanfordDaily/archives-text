## Wonder Years alum proof of female success in math 
### MIKI SOFER AND HAO YAN 
More than a year has passed since Har
vard University President Lawrence Sum
mers shocked the nation with his controver
sial remarks regarding the ability of women
to compete among the top scientists and
mathematicians. His comments continue to
stir debate, especially at Stanford.
Yesterday, in co-sponsorship with the
Feminist Studies Program and the Depart
ments of Mathematics, History, English and
Drama, the Institute for Research on
Women and Gender hosted "Proof and Prej
udice: Women in Mathematics." The event
showcased a panel of four female scholars in
the math and the science fields. Each spoke
passionately about the representation of fe
male mathematicians and the contemporary
culture of mathematics in our society.
The first panel, focusing on the portrayal
of female mathematicians in drama and fic
tion, kicked off with a dramatic reading from
David Auburn's play "Proof', which was re
cently made into a film starring Gwyneth
Paltrow. Panelist Danica McKellar, best
known for her role as Winnie Cooper on the
hit TV series "The Wonder Years," is a
summa cum laude graduate of UCLA who
coauthored a mathematical proof.
"No one understood why I took a break
for mathematics after acting," McKellar said.
"They don't see that these two can work to
gether."
The reality, panelists showed, is that Hol
lywood perpetuates a harmful stereotype.
According to McKellar, studies have indicat-

Ed that nearly 75 percent of all scientists por
trayed on television are white males. When
women receive roles as mathematicians, they
are depicted as unattractive or eccentric.
Movie critic Mary Pols observed that the
lead actress in the film "Julie Johnson" "be
gins to dress weird and turns into a lesbian"
as soon as she discovers mathematics. Equal
ly pervasive is the stereotype that a woman
cannot understand math, but instead brings
tea for her husband so that he can do it. Panel
speakers said they fear that these depictions,
which perpetuate the belief that math is for
men, are what make it easy for individuals
like Summers to make sexist comments.
In light of the ever-growing influence of
the entertainment industry in American soci
ety.the depiction in film of women in relation
to science and math is especially disconcert
ing. "I don't know how any of this will
change, but we need to have a better repre
sentation of women in movies," Pols af
firmed.
The nature of the problem, however, goes
beyond stereotypes and extends into the
very fabric of our culture. When girls arrive at
college and are given the choice to study
math, McKellar noted, they often decide that
they cannot see themselves as a successful
student in the area.
"I got a five on my AP BC Calculus exam
in high school. Who would be a better candi
date for a B.A. in mathematics?" McKellar
inquired. "But it took me a whole year to
begin seeing myself as a math major. It all
comes down to role models."
It is also a matter of confidence
and expectations, added panelist
Helen Moore, associate director at
the American Institute of Mathe
matics Research Conference Center
in Palo Alto. While working toward
her Ph.D. at State University of New
York at Stony Brook, she spoke out
against a timed examination that
strongly favored male students.
Once the department relaxed the
time constraints, gender differences
disappeared.
Other studies have demonstrated
the effects of such expectations. One
such effect is called the "Pygmalion
effect." In a particular study, teach
ers were given the names of random
students and told that these students
received the best scores on a partic
ular assessment. By the end of the
year, these students were — not co
incidentally — the ones with the
best marks in the class. Because a
teacher's expectations can have such
a strong impact on a student's per
formance, it is important that educa
tors are made aware of this relation
ship. Otherwise, the stereotypical
belief that females perform worse in
math may become a self-fulfilling
prophecy.
Londa Schiebinger, the director
of the Institute for Research on
Women and Gender at Stanford,
spoke about the need for a cultural
transformation at universities. His
torically, society has been organized
around men's lives, she said. Now
that women are professionals, they
are expected to compete on the
same level — but they also must
play the dual role of mother, which is
not easy. Institutions will need to ac
commodate those who want to be
academics and have families at the
same time. Stanford's recent deci
sion to grant maternity leave to fe

male graduate students is an exam
ple of one such recent initiative.
Schiebinger admitted that al
though it was disappointing to have
someone like Summers make the re
marks that he did, the effect was not
entirely negative. "[The comments]
have succeeded in opening up a
wonderful conversation on these is
sues," she said.
A male audience member agreed
with Schiebinger, humorously com
menting that "Larry Summers could
not have done more good for the fe
male community." Whereas previ
ously little attention was given to
this issue, now serious money and
leadership commitments are being
poured into the relevant programs at
Harvard.
Stanford is making similar
strides. Schiebinger praised the Uni
versity for providing "a supportive
and friendly environment" for
women professors and faculty mem
bers in math and science.
The Institute for Research on
Women and Gender, under
Schiebinger's leadership, offers vari
ous fellowships for graduate stu
dents and educational initiatives for
undergraduates. The institute has
also recently launched a multi-year
study of dual career couples to bet
ter understand the gender barriers
that continue to exist inside the
academy. The fact that professional
women are more likely to marry
other professionals and be adversely
affected by these relationships is of
particular importance to universities
that want to retain their leading fe
male scholars.
In addition, the institution is
sponsoring an upcoming female
leadership forum scheduled in Feb
ruary.
"The overall response of univer
sities has been to look deeply at
these issues once again and assess
how we need to change universities
to make them places where women
can flourish," said Schiebinger. "The
important point is that women too
can also flourish."
