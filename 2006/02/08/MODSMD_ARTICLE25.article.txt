## Wonder Years alum proof of female success in math 
### MIKI SOFER AND HAO YAN 
More than a year has passed since Har
vard University President Lawrence Sum
mers shocked the nation with his controver
sial remarks regarding the ability of women
to compete among the top scientists and
mathematicians. His comments continue to
stir debate, especially at Stanford.
Yesterday, in co-sponsorship with the
Feminist Studies Program and the Depart
ments of Mathematics, History, English and
Drama, the Institute for Research on
Women and Gender hosted "Proof and Prej
udice: Women in Mathematics." The event
showcased a panel of four female scholars in
the math and the science fields. Each spoke
passionately about the representation of fe
male mathematicians and the contemporary
culture of mathematics in our society.
The first panel, focusing on the portrayal
of female mathematicians in drama and fic
tion, kicked off with a dramatic reading from
David Auburn's play "Proof', which was re
cently made into a film starring Gwyneth
Paltrow. Panelist Danica McKellar, best
known for her role as Winnie Cooper on the
hit TV series "The Wonder Years," is a
summa cum laude graduate of UCLA who
coauthored a mathematical proof.
"No one understood why I took a break
for mathematics after acting," McKellar said.
"They don't see that these two can work to
gether."
The reality, panelists showed, is that Hol
lywood perpetuates a harmful stereotype.
According to McKellar, studies have indicat-

Ed that nearly 75 percent of all scientists por
trayed on television are white males. When
women receive roles as mathematicians, they
are depicted as unattractive or eccentric.
Movie critic Mary Pols observed that the
lead actress in the film "Julie Johnson" "be
gins to dress weird and turns into a lesbian"
as soon as she discovers mathematics. Equal
ly pervasive is the stereotype that a woman
cannot understand math, but instead brings
tea for her husband so that he can do it. Panel
speakers said they fear that these depictions,
which perpetuate the belief that math is for
men, are what make it easy for individuals
like Summers to make sexist comments.
In light of the ever-growing influence of
the entertainment industry in American soci
ety.the depiction in film of women in relation
to science and math is especially disconcert
ing. "I don't know how any of this will
change, but we need to have a better repre
sentation of women in movies," Pols af
firmed.
The nature of the problem, however, goes
beyond stereotypes and extends into the
very fabric of our culture. When girls arrive at
college and are given the choice to study
math, McKellar noted, they often decide that
they cannot see themselves as a successful
student in the area.
"I got a five on my AP BC Calculus exam
in high school. Who would be a better candi
date for a B.A. in mathematics?" McKellar
inquired. "But it took me a whole year to
begin seeing myself as a math major. It all
