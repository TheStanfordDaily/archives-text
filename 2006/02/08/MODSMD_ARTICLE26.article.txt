# NEWS BRIEF
## Groups protest Google China 
### 
Though the company's motto reads "don't be evil,"
Google's expanding operations in China come close to
being just that. Such was the message of protesters
demonstrating outside of Google China President Kai
Fu Lee's speech on Saturday in the Graduate Commu
nity Center (GCC).
Lee's speech on leadership and the lessons from his
career, covered in a Daily story yesterday, "Head of
China Google speaks on spotlight," Feb. 7, avoided dis
closing details regarding Google's specific operations
in China. But demonstrators, including such groups as
Students for a Free Tibet, knew enough to feel com
pelled to protest.
Bearing signs that read "Google, don't be evil,"
picketers from around the area marched outside the
GCC and hounded Lee as he got into his car following
the talk.
"We hope to get the message to Kai-Fu Lee that we
won't stand for censorship," University of San Francis
co law school student and Students for a Free Tibet
member Alma David told the San Francisco Chroni
cle. "We see a company selling out its values for a prof
it. Its 'don't be evil' just seems like a bad joke."
Hie company's recent decision to launch a Google
China Web site has drawn the ire of critics, who argue
that agreeing to cooperate with the Chinese govern
ment's restrictions on Web access amounts to censor
ship. Lee told his audience that Google made the diffi
cult decision to obey China's laws in order to do busi
ness there.
Google's competitors in the search-engine market
— namely Yahoo and Microsoft — Lee's former em
ployer, have done the same.
