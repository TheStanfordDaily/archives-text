## University plans luxury hotel Collaboration with Rosewood Hotels set for Sand Hill road 
### ANDREW BURMON STAFF WRITER 
In a few years, businessmen
may be shelling out big money to
spend a night on the Stanford
campus. They will not, of course,
be staying in claustrophobic dorm
rooms — rather they will be stay
ing in the new hotel being built on
University land along Sand Hill
Road.
The hotel, which has yet to be
formally named, is a joint venture
between the University and
Rosewood Hotels, whose mission
statement says the company is
"devoted to creating hotels and
resorts unlike any other in the
world."
Rooms at The Carlyle. Rose
wood's New York outlet, cost as
much as $ 1,5(X) a night, though the
prices begin in $4(X) range.
The Stanford Rosewood Hotel
will serve the same perceived
niche market as the recently
opened Silicon Valley Four Sea
son's Hotel in East Palo Alto —
namely the business associates of
Silicon Valley's many Fortune 500
companies.
Bill Phillips, Stanford's manag
ing director of real estate, pointed
out that the project will not only
"address a lack of hotel space in
the Sand Hill Road Corridor" but
also "provide a mutually support
ive office."
The supportive office, a build
ing separate from the hotel, will
be located next to the Rosewood
facility. Hopefully this will attract
the sort of jet-setting clientele
that have traditionally stayed in
San Francisco hotels while con
ducting their business in Silicon
Valley, he said. The presence of a
hotel on the Stanford campus will
thus be, as Phillips puts it, "eco
nomically beneficial to both Stan

ford and the city of Menlo Park."
Against the wishes of residents
of Sharon Heights, who have ex
pressed concern over possible
traffic problems associated with
the hotel. Menlo Park's town offi
cers have supported the project
from the beginning.Town officers
have pointed out that it might
bring about an economic boost
from the added tax revenue.
In the meantime. Hill Glazier
Architects have designed a
265,000 square foot complex that
will reflect the area's physical
character. The complex will cover
only a small fraction of the area of
the site and has been conceived
with the image of the University
and the aesthetics of Sunset Mag
azine in mind. The building will
have many open courtyards and
will favor a ranch rather than high
rise concept. The luxurious hotel
will have only 120 rooms inside.
The proposed hotel has cer
tainly changed a lot since the idea
for an on-campus hotel first sur
faced in 1989. "At that time it was
going to be a 387-room Westin
Hotel," Phillips said.
However, Rosewood was
given the contract after Stanford
determined that the company had
what Phillips described as, "the
best performance among the top
tier hotel operators."
In their formal press release
Rosewood Hotels and the Uni
versity described Sand Hill Road
as "the proverbial home of the
US. venture capital industry."
As the hotel passes from hy
pothetical to real, the noises of
construction may be audible
from the Golf Course, where stu
dents already bump into many of
the nation's most successful ven
ture capitalists. Overall, howev
er, the project will not affect the
experience of most Stanford stu
dents.
As to what Stanford students
should expect when they sneak in
to steal towels. Rosewood Hotels
and Resorts attempt to combine
"the traditions of [their] host com
munity with exceptional service."
