## Speaker recounts 1906 earthquake recovery 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
The 1906 San Francisco Earth
quake remains the second deadliest
natural disaster in U.S. history. Not
only was an American city nearly
wiped off the map, the earthquake
caused three days of continuous fires
— destroying five square miles of the
city and killing at least 3.(XX) people.
It cost the United States $350 million
in damages, destroyed 28,000 struc
tures and displaced 250,000 resi
dents.
Yesterday, Dr. Andrea Davis
Henderson delivered a lecture on
gendered responses to the earth
quake. Henderson's lecture focused
on the role this earthquake played in
initiating an era of progressive relief
efforts. In its aftermath, issues involv
ing working-class refugees were
highly politicized and women were
forced to enter the public arena.
Henderson, a research associate
for the Institute of Women and Gen
der, delivered this speech as part of
the monthly colloquium series spon
sored by the Bill Lane Center for the
Study of the North American West.
She received her Ph.D.. from Stan
ford last year. Yesterday's lecture
was developed from her dissertation,
"Rebuilding Home."
Henderson explained to her audi
ence that the San Francisco earth
quake and fire spawned the first
large-scale federal relief effort in
U.S. history. Red Cross founder
Clara Barton had retired only two
years before the disaster. With the
departure of its notoriously disor
ganized creator, the Red Cross bu
reaucratized relief, collecting money
from the federal government and
private donations, leading to a cen
tralized organization.
According to Henderson, disaster
relief efforts placed more responsi
bility on the shoulders of middle
class female relief workers. It relied
on existing women networks, such as
social clubs, and transformed them
into charitable organizations. Hun
dreds of women entered the public
realm to distribute supplies and
nurse injured refugees.
Refugee women also came to the
forefront, agitating for proper relief.
Henderson told the story of how
many refugee women wrote letters
to camp administrators and female
relief workers to prevent being trans
ported to the Inglewood Camp.

where they'd be housed in former
stables miles from the city.
Activist Mary Kelly, after request
ing to move her family from a leaky
tent to one of the relief cottages, led a
group of refugee women to unoccu
pied cottages and moved in, putting
locks on the doors. The relief admin
istrators had the house moved to In
glewood Camp and then destroyed
— with her in it. After surviving this
incident. Mary Kelly later fought for

women's suffrage.
The question-and-answer session
following the lecture involved
broader topics. One member of the
audience asked how the relief agen
cies had handled Chinese refugees.
Henderson said the Chinese
refugee camp "was moved to the
edge of the presidium."
"But," she continued, "the Chi
nese refugees were always excised
from the original relief system, so not

what happened to
them for the better
or worse"

many really used it." Instead they re
lied more heavily on family networks
and the Chinese communities in
Oakland and Berkeley.
"I was looking at not just
women," Henderson said, "but
women and immigrant communities
after a disaster, and what happened
to them for the better or worse."
Her research was partially in
spired by her experiences as a San
Francisco firefighter between 19%
and 2(XX), a job she took after getting
a Masters degree, in religious studies
from Stanford.
"To do something," she said,
"means you ask different questions
than if you were to just read about
them. It made me realize that what
happens during disasters gives quite
a bit of clarity on what's happening in
the real world. It sort of stops time,
you're walking in on someone in the
middle of their lives. You really get to
see things how they really are."
Henderson described her transi
tion from Stanford graduate student
to firefighter.
"I went to career counseling at
Stanford and firefighting came up as
a career option for me," she said. "I
thought that I should check out
everything that I might be good at.
So I took a year off from Stanford
and just tried everything that came
up. Medical school came up, so I
shadowed a surgeon. Non-profit
came up. so I helped start one. And
firefighting came up, so I applied in
San Francisco and got in."
