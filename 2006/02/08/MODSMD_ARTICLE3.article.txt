## Recent grad dies in Berlin 
### COURTNEY WEAVER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On Monday evening, Berlin police
learned of the death of Patrick Wood,
a recent graduate of Stanford's Class
of 2(X)5. Wood, a double major in
mathematics and computer science,
had been interning at Siemens, a Ger
man engineering firm. He was plan
ning to return to Stanford this fall to
complete a co-term in computer sci
ence.
Ryan Wirtz, a 2(M)3 graduate and
friend of Wood in Berlin, fondly re
called Wood's love of the city and pas
sion for German culture.
"He was moved by German music
and literature, and had a profound
grasp of the German language," he
said. "He saw Germany as a society
that was very introspective and he
was very thoughtful himself, so he re
ally fit in here and liked it. He felt at
home here."
Wirtz also remembered Wood's
enjoyment of the Berlin scene.
"He loved to party in Berlin and
loved to go out to the hippest clubs,"
he said. "[He was] in the scene, but
not of the scene. He found it exciting
and funny, and liked to observe it
from a distance. He saw a lot of irony
in it."
Wirtz added that this was typical
of Wood's desire to explore "things
that were complex" and noted his "in
satiable appetite for learning and
challenges — and math jokes."
He also characterized Wood as a
"loyal friend and very generous to the
people he cared about. [He had a]
great ability to draw people into his
life."
An attendee of the Stanford in
Berlin program in spring 2(X)4, Wood
also interned at BMW in Munich
throughout the summer of 2004 as
part of Stanford's Krupp Internship
program.
James Ollunga, Class of 2005. at
tended Stanford in Berlin with Wood
and lived with him on campus during
their junior and senior years. Ollunga
similarly remembered Wood as "very
warm" and a "very nice person to get
along with."
"He was great at just being able to
fit into a group and make everyone
feel really warm around him," he said.
"In Berlin we'd all go out together
and he'd get us all laughing."
Junior Christine Boehm, who
lived with Wood in Haus Mitteleu
ropa during his senior year, called
Wood "a lot of fun to be around" and
noted his "quirky sense of humor."
"He brought a lot of life to the
house last year, especially with his
piano playing and the little things he
did for people," she said, adding
about his piano playing that "it was a
wonderful treat to hear him play."
Ollunga called Wood a "virtuoso"
and recalled hearing his music float
ing through the lounges of 680 Lomi
ta and Haus Mitt, while Ollunga was

on his way to breakfast or class.
As a fellow early riser. Boehm
often had the opportunity to eat
breakfast with Wood before the rest
of the house awoke.
"He would make me scrambled
eggs," she recalled.
Boehm also remembered Wood
as "a really smart guy," and Ollunga
noted Wood's strong interest in
"mathematical and computational
problems."
"He was very enthusiastic about
what he studied," Ollunga added.
"He'd wrap his mind around a prob
lem in math."

According to Ollunga, family was
"very important" to Wood, and he re
called meeting Woods grandparents
when they came to visit him in Berlin
in the spring of 2(M)4.
Ollunga also remembered the
poster-size photograph of Wood
"and his sister on a cable in San Fran
cisco" which hung on Wood's 680
bedroom wall.
A memorial service was held for
Wood in Berlin yesterday. Funeral
arrangements are still pending.
Said Boehm: "[Wood was just]
one of those people who's really
good to have around."
