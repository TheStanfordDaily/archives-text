Hits 3 free throws to send game into OT

VS. OREGON

Nails game-winning three with 11.3 sec left

Through 11 games of Pac-10 play, senior
guard Chris Hernandez is shooting over 50 per
cent — on three-pointers. He's also % percent

in the league from the free-throw line, where
he's made 21 straight. But more than mere sta
tistics can convey, the Pac-10 Player of the Week
has simply put Stanford on his shoulders as of
late.

The Stanford Daily's Daniel Novinson had
the opportunity to interview Chris yesterday,
and proudly presents this edited transcript as
the first of a new weekly series: "Talking

With the Stars."
The Stanford Daily: l irst, jlist want to talk
about your late-game heroics: game-sav
ing shots against Washington and Ore
gon, and then 11 straight points at Ore
gon State. You've been playing basket
ball your whole life. Have you ever
I seen or done anything like that?
Chris Hernandez: In high school, there
were a lot of close games w here 1 made
big plays, but I don't know whether it
was consecutively or in a range of
games. I've done it before and it's just a
situation where I had a lot of luck. I was

blessed, God was on my side, he had my
back and there was opportunity to make a
play and 1 was fortunate to make it.
SD: I know you're a deeply spiritual guy. Do
you feel spirituality — God — enters into it
when it's late in the game and you're going
up for a shot?
