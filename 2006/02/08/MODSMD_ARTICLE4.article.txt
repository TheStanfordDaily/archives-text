Hits 3 free throws to send game into OT

VS. OREGON

Nails game-winning three with 11.3 sec left

Through 11 games of Pac-10 play, senior
guard Chris Hernandez is shooting over 50 per
cent — on three-pointers. He's also % percent

in the league from the free-throw line, where
he's made 21 straight. But more than mere sta
tistics can convey, the Pac-10 Player of the Week
has simply put Stanford on his shoulders as of
late.

The Stanford Daily's Daniel Novinson had
the opportunity to interview Chris yesterday,
and proudly presents this edited transcript as
the first of a new weekly series: "Talking

With the Stars."
The Stanford Daily: l irst, jlist want to talk
about your late-game heroics: game-sav
ing shots against Washington and Ore
gon, and then 11 straight points at Ore
gon State. You've been playing basket
ball your whole life. Have you ever
I seen or done anything like that?
Chris Hernandez: In high school, there
were a lot of close games w here 1 made
big plays, but I don't know whether it
was consecutively or in a range of
games. I've done it before and it's just a
situation where I had a lot of luck. I was

blessed, God was on my side, he had my
back and there was opportunity to make a
play and 1 was fortunate to make it.
SD: I know you're a deeply spiritual guy. Do
you feel spirituality — God — enters into it
when it's late in the game and you're going
up for a shot?

Senior guard Chris Hernandez sinks one of his three game-tying free throws against Washington with .2 sec
onds left. He talks with The Stanford Daily about the team's present — and future.
CH: I' m not thinking that every sin
gle move is that situation, but defi
nitely I feel that, with my spirituality,
it's not all me. What I'm doing is
someone's work other than mine.
I'm just trying to do my best to rep
resent that on the court and give
credit when it's due, because a lot of
those situations don't happen all the
time, and that situation definitely
could have gone either way. I think
that it doesn't really hurt to give
credit when it's due.
SD: Does it feel different to you at
all when you're going up for a three
and there's five minutes left in the
first half versus two seconds left in a
tight game? Do you release differ
ently?
CH: Obviously the situation is a lit
tle different [at the end of a close
game], so it's a little more intense
than just coming down during the
middle of the game and shooting a
three. You feel that there's a little
more riding on it. 1 try not to think
about it when 1 shoot and just let it
go off [based] on how it feels.
SD: Do you feel like you do a good
job of blocking that out and just fo
cusing on the play?
CH: I try. Obviously there are times
when 1 don't, and there are times
when 1 do let stuff get in my head,
and it's happened this year, obvious
ly. You try to minimize those as much
as possible, and, as you said, block
everything out.
SD: You said you let stuff get in your
head; can you think of an example
this year?
CH: Maybe Virginia Tech. I was

"The test of character and leadership is not how you
begin,but how you end."

— CHRIS HERNANDEZ senior guard

thinking too much about the free
throws [he went 4-of-6 in a 59-52
loss] and what I was doing instead of
just blocking it out and shooting.
SD: Do you feel different this year as
a fifth-year senior versus any other
year?
CH: It's a lot different than the past
couple of years I've been here. Just
that I'm old and a lot of the other
guys are young. None of the guys I
came to class with are here and a lot
of my friends, my peers, are gone. It's
a lot different that way.
SD: Do you feel any more pressure
on the court?
CH: I don't feel any more pressure
on the court. I don't feel like I have
to do a certain amount of things each
game; I just try to feel it out and do
what needs to be done to win.
SD: Where do you want to be a year
from now?
CH: Playing professional basketball
somewhere. Whether it's here or
overseas, I'm not sure yet, but just
playing.
SD: Anything in particular you want
to work on in the off-season to im
prove your game?
CH: Oh man. everything. Ball-han
dling, shooting — you've got to
work on different shots for the pro
fessional level — dribbling, condi

tioning, explosiveness.
SI): It's your last season. I know you
normally say the individual honors
are not a big deal, but does it take on
an added importance, kind of vali
date you a little bit, because this is
your last time on the court?
CH:The only validation I'm going to
really look forward to is if we finish
out this season. This whole year the
main thing I've pointed to for valida
tion was being able to lead this team,
get us in a good spot, get us wins,lead
us to the postseason and do well. So
regardless of recognition or rewards,
1 think I'll be happy with myself if we
end this stretch here in good fashion,
get to the postseason and do better
than we've done in the past. That'll
be all the validation I need.
SD: Finally, how do you think you've
done leading the team this year?
CH: 1 think that I've done every
thing I can to the best of my ability.
Obviously in the preseason things
weren't going as well as we wanted
or as people expected. But I think a
test of character and leadership is
not how you begin, but how you end.
So, I'm trying to focus on the end of
this year and what's going on right
now, and not try to worry about what
happened in the past.
SD: Thank you so much.

main thing I've pointed to for valida
tion was being able to lead this team,
get us in a good spot, get us wins,lead
us to the postseason and do well. So
regardless of recognition or rewards,
1 think I'll be happy with myself if we
end this stretch here in good fashion,
get to the postseason and do better
than we've done in the past. That'll
be all the validation I need.
SD: Finally, how do you think you've
done leading the team this year?
CH: 1 think that I've done every
thing I can to the best of my ability.
Obviously in the preseason things
weren't going as well as we wanted
or as people expected. But I think a
test of character and leadership is
not how you begin, but how you end.
So, I'm trying to focus on the end of
this year and what's going on right
now, and not try to worry about what
happened in the past.
SD: Thank you so much.

Hits 3 free throws to send game into OT

VS. OREGON

Nails game-winning three with 11.3 sec left

Through 11 games of Pac-10 play, senior
guard Chris Hernandez is shooting over 50 per
cent — on three-pointers. He's also % percent

in the league from the free-throw line, where
he's made 21 straight. But more than mere sta
tistics can convey, the Pac-10 Player of the Week
has simply put Stanford on his shoulders as of
late.

The Stanford Daily's Daniel Novinson had
the opportunity to interview Chris yesterday,
and proudly presents this edited transcript as
the first of a new weekly series: "Talking

With the Stars."
The Stanford Daily: l irst, jlist want to talk
about your late-game heroics: game-sav
ing shots against Washington and Ore
gon, and then 11 straight points at Ore
gon State. You've been playing basket
ball your whole life. Have you ever
I seen or done anything like that?
Chris Hernandez: In high school, there
were a lot of close games w here 1 made
big plays, but I don't know whether it
was consecutively or in a range of
games. I've done it before and it's just a
situation where I had a lot of luck. I was

blessed, God was on my side, he had my
back and there was opportunity to make a
play and 1 was fortunate to make it.
SD: I know you're a deeply spiritual guy. Do
you feel spirituality — God — enters into it
when it's late in the game and you're going
up for a shot?

Sinks 22 second-half pts

Senior guard Chris Hernandez sinks one of his three game-tying free throws against Washington with .2 sec
onds left. He talks with The Stanford Daily about the team's present — and future.
CH: I' m not thinking that every sin
gle move is that situation, but defi
nitely I feel that, with my spirituality,
it's not all me. What I'm doing is
someone's work other than mine.
I'm just trying to do my best to rep
resent that on the court and give
credit when it's due, because a lot of
those situations don't happen all the
time, and that situation definitely
could have gone either way. I think
that it doesn't really hurt to give
credit when it's due.
SD: Does it feel different to you at
all when you're going up for a three
and there's five minutes left in the
first half versus two seconds left in a
tight game? Do you release differ
ently?
CH: Obviously the situation is a lit
tle different [at the end of a close
game], so it's a little more intense
than just coming down during the
middle of the game and shooting a
three. You feel that there's a little
more riding on it. 1 try not to think
about it when 1 shoot and just let it
go off [based] on how it feels.
SD: Do you feel like you do a good
job of blocking that out and just fo
cusing on the play?
CH: I try. Obviously there are times
when 1 don't, and there are times
when 1 do let stuff get in my head,
and it's happened this year, obvious
ly. You try to minimize those as much
as possible, and, as you said, block
everything out.
SD: You said you let stuff get in your
head; can you think of an example
this year?
CH: Maybe Virginia Tech. I was

begin,but how you end."

thinking too much about the free
throws [he went 4-of-6 in a 59-52
loss] and what I was doing instead of
just blocking it out and shooting.
SD: Do you feel different this year as
a fifth-year senior versus any other
year?
CH: It's a lot different than the past
couple of years I've been here. Just
that I'm old and a lot of the other
guys are young. None of the guys I
came to class with are here and a lot
of my friends, my peers, are gone. It's
a lot different that way.
SD: Do you feel any more pressure
on the court?
CH: I don't feel any more pressure
on the court. I don't feel like I have
to do a certain amount of things each
game; I just try to feel it out and do
what needs to be done to win.
SD: Where do you want to be a year
from now?
CH: Playing professional basketball
somewhere. Whether it's here or
overseas, I'm not sure yet, but just
playing.
SD: Anything in particular you want
to work on in the off-season to im
prove your game?
CH: Oh man. everything. Ball-han
dling, shooting — you've got to
work on different shots for the pro
fessional level — dribbling, condi

tioning, explosiveness.
SI): It's your last season. I know you
normally say the individual honors
are not a big deal, but does it take on
an added importance, kind of vali
date you a little bit, because this is
your last time on the court?
CH:The only validation I'm going to
really look forward to is if we finish
out this season. This whole year the
main thing I've pointed to for valida
tion was being able to lead this team,
