## Changes proposed for ASSU Constitution Alterations deal with Honor Code proceedings 
### ADAM WIDMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate
met last night to discuss proposed
changes to the ASSU Constitution,
hear issues regarding student group
storage space and give current initia
tive updates
Laurette Beeson, a judicial advisor
from the Office of Student Affairs,
began the meeting with a presentation
detailing proposed changes to Article
1, Section 4 of the ASSU constitution.
Hie section lists the proceedings for a
hearing concerning a student violation
of the Fundamental Standard or
Honor Code.
Beeson, who has staffed and served
on the 15-member committee that
proposed the changes, said the goal

was to make the language less severe,
thus making students charged with vi
olations more comfortable.
"Our goal was to make the lan
guage less adversarial." said Beeson.
"We want students to know what theii
rights are and what is accessible t<>
them."
The proposed changes included re
placing certain words with negative
connotations. Adjustments include
using "guilt" instead of "responsibili
ty," changing "complaint" to "con
cern," and "cross-examine" to
questions."
Beeson explained that the ()ftice of
Judicial Affairs made these changes in
an effort to remove the scorn often as
sociated with those charged with
Honor Code violations.
"One of the rights of the students is
to have no notation on their transcript
whatsoever." said Beeson. "A lot of
cases go away before they draw a
panel."
Beeson added that the changes
were intended to demonstrate that
Fundamental Standard hearings are
"an educational process, not a legal
one."
Senators debated the issue.
Aneto Okonkwo, vice president of
the ASSU, questioned the merits of
changing the bill.
"What's broken that needs to be
fixed?" he asked, adding that contin
ually modifying the document risks
significantly changing its meaning
and purpose significantly in the fu
ture.
Faris Mohiuddin, chair of the
Senate committee for appropria
tions, spoke positively about the
changes, saying that moderating the
adversarial tones of the document
would encourage students who have
been convicted of honor code viola
tions to communicate with the ad
ministration.
"People who are punished and
leave for one or two quarters have to
come back and interact with the ad
ministration," he said. "We don't
want to scar them from interacting
positively from the administration in
the future. I think this is the point be
hind the less-adversarial terminolo
gy, why the amendments are justi
fied."
The group will vote on whether
or not to approve the amendments
next week. Before changes can be
made, the Graduate Student Coun
cil. Faculty Senate and University
President John Hennessy must also

approve the amendments.
Following the presentation,
ASSU Financial Manager Justin
Fishner-Wolfson announced that re
quests for special-fees refunds are
slightly higher this quarter. He
added that refund results are now
posted online at the ASSU's Web
site.
Okonkwo followed with a pres
entation on storage space for stu
dent groups.
"Storage space is a student issue
that has not been focused on for a
while," he said. "Often, the ASSU al
locates money from student fees for
student group purchases, but the
groups have no place to put the
equipment. If the equipment is lost,
students' money is lost."
Okonkwo suggested that the
Senate enact a pilot program de
signed to give appropriate student
groups storage space near White
Plaza.
According to Okonkwo. 48 per
cent of student groups surveyed said
storage space is a "very important"
issue, and 55 percent of student
groups said they rely on individual
members for equipment storage.
Other notable events included
the ratification of Joint Legislative
Bill s.The bill, written by Adam Be
berg of the Graduate Student
Council, was approved with a mar
gin of 14 supporters to zero dis
senters. The abstract of the bill pro
posed "to codify by-laws involved in
general fees."
On a more humorous note, an
ASSU senator set off the building's
fire alarm after the ratification by
walking outside through an emer
gency exit. The other senators said
they were very impressed.
The ASSU will meet with the
Board of Trustees on Monday.
