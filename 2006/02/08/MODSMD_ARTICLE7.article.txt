## Eating Clubs a hit, say Toyon sophomores Dining program both mandatory and popular

Toyon, Stanford's only all-sopho
more dorm, is also unique for being
the only residence on campus that of
fers and requires students to use
Stanford Eating Clubs.
According to Eating Club General
Manager Zac Sargeant. more person
al service is the major benefit of Eat
ing Clubs.
"We cater to one dorm and one
dorm only," Sargeant said in an inter
view with 'ITie Daily. "The customer
service you can get is much more one
on-one versus working with a larger
numbers of students [in dining
halls]."
Another perk of Eating Clubs.
Sargeant said, is that club managers
act as liaisons between the staff and
students.
"They pass on requests to our pro
fessional chefs," he said. "They're also
learning hands-on business skills.The
benefits for everybody are fantastic."
Eating Club Manager. Junior
Thomas Chung, agreed that eating
clubs offer more individual service.

"The Eating Club managers arc on
a first name basis with almost every
single resident in the dorm," Chung
said. "When the lady in Stern swipes
your card, she doesn't remember you.
We ask you how your day was."
Toyon resident, sophomore Joshua
Doty said. "It's been great. I really
enjoy having the ability to access an
open kitchen whenever I want, and
I'm sure if I could make something
other than a sandwich I'd be able to
exponentially reap the benefits."
When it comes to the menu,
"We're more responsive," Chung
said. "The residents tell us if they like
something or if they don't or if it's too
greasy. We're much more responsive
than Stanford Dining, which we're a
separate entity from. We cooperate
with Stanford, but we're not part of
Stanford Dining, although the admin
istration has a say in what we do."
Doty concurred that Eating Club
managers are receptive to food-related.
" Iliey frequently ask for sugges
tions for improvement and imple
ment any ideas that the residences
have on a regular basis," he said.
For Doty, one of the main differ
ences — and potential drawbacks —
between meals at the Eating Club
and meals in a typical dining hall is
