## Eating Clubs a hit, say Toyon sophomores Dining program both mandatory and popular 
### STEPHANIE FAGLIANO STAFF WRITER 
Toyon, Stanford's only all-sopho
more dorm, is also unique for being
the only residence on campus that of
fers and requires students to use
Stanford Eating Clubs.
According to Eating Club General
Manager Zac Sargeant. more person
al service is the major benefit of Eat
ing Clubs.
"We cater to one dorm and one
dorm only," Sargeant said in an inter
view with 'ITie Daily. "The customer
service you can get is much more one
on-one versus working with a larger
numbers of students [in dining
halls]."
Another perk of Eating Clubs.
Sargeant said, is that club managers
act as liaisons between the staff and
students.
"They pass on requests to our pro
fessional chefs," he said. "They're also
learning hands-on business skills.The
benefits for everybody are fantastic."
Eating Club Manager. Junior
Thomas Chung, agreed that eating
clubs offer more individual service.

"The Eating Club managers arc on
a first name basis with almost every
single resident in the dorm," Chung
said. "When the lady in Stern swipes
your card, she doesn't remember you.
We ask you how your day was."
Toyon resident, sophomore Joshua
Doty said. "It's been great. I really
enjoy having the ability to access an
open kitchen whenever I want, and
I'm sure if I could make something
other than a sandwich I'd be able to
exponentially reap the benefits."
When it comes to the menu,
"We're more responsive," Chung
said. "The residents tell us if they like
something or if they don't or if it's too
greasy. We're much more responsive
than Stanford Dining, which we're a
separate entity from. We cooperate
with Stanford, but we're not part of
Stanford Dining, although the admin
istration has a say in what we do."
Doty concurred that Eating Club
managers are receptive to food-related.
" Iliey frequently ask for sugges
tions for improvement and imple
ment any ideas that the residences
have on a regular basis," he said.
For Doty, one of the main differ
ences — and potential drawbacks —
between meals at the Eating Club
and meals in a typical dining hall is
the somewhat limited amount of
food.
"You have to arrive to dinner
within the first five minutes or else
the popular selections will be gone,"
he said. "But otherwise it's very
similar, just with less people."
Chung said Toyon dining most
closely resembles dining in the Row
houses, only the system is a bit more
complicated.
"You feed 200-plus people and
have six managers that run the Eat
ing Clubs and the Terrace, which is
the open kitchen in Toyon, as well as
a head manager,"he said.
The multiple-manager system
does not increase the prices of
Toyon Dining. In face, there are fi
nancial benefits to patronizing the
Eating Clubs, students said.
"I pay less than I did last year for
Wilbur Dining," Doty said, "and I
have access to an open kitchen."
Stanford Eating Clubs pay the
University for utilities, like any
other organization on campus, but
they also cover their entire mainte
nance costs.
"We're one of the only business
es on campus that is nonprofit"
Sargeant said. "One hundred per
cent of what students pay goes to
the Eating Clubs."
Toyon's clubs work a little differ

ently this year than they have in
years past.
"This year we have two clubs,"
said Sargeant. "We serve each club
the same food from a central dining
room. We don't mind if you switch
where you eat. We just have to do
keep the clubs for financial purpos
es."
And more changes may lie
ahead.
"There have been some conver
sations about whether the current
location of the Eating Clubs will
exist after a few years" he said.
"Stanford is always creating new and
better buildings for their services."
While eating at a specific club is
not mandatory, there are often
weekend activities based on club
participation.
The Eating Club managers also
try and work actively with the
Toyon staff Chung said — incorpo
rating hall events such as Ilig-O-
War after dinner.
Encouraging student feedback,
Stanford Eating Clubs conduct
quarterly surveys.
"The majority would say they
prefer Stanford eating clubs over
Stanford dining," Sargeant said.
"We have special dinners and things
like that that you wouldn't' find in
the actual dining services."
So are the residents of Toyon re
ally satisfied with the Eating Clubs?
"It's not as good as my mother's
cooking," Doty admitted, "but
those expectations aside, I can't
complain."
