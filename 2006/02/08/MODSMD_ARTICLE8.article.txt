### ERRIN HAINES ASSOCIATED PRESS 
LITHONIA,Ga. (AP) — Ten thousand mourners —
including four U.S. presidents, numerous members of
Congress and many gray-haired veterans of the civil
rights movement — said goodbye to Coretta Scott King
on TUesday, with President Bush saluting her as "a
woman who worked to make our nation whole."
The immense crowd filled the New Birth Missionary
Baptist Church — a modern, arena-style megachurch in
a suburban Atlanta county that was once a stronghold of
the Ku Klux Klan but today has one of the most affluent
black populations in the country.
More than three dozen speakers at the funeral took turns
remembering the widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr., who worked to realize her husband's dream of equal
ity for nearly 40 years after his assassination. She died
Jan. 30 at age 78 after battling ovarian cancer and the ef
fects of a stroke.
The president ordered flags flown at half-staff across
the country.
"Coretta Scott King not only secured her husband's
legacy, she built her own." Bush told the crowd. "Having
loved a leader, she became a leader, and when she spoke,
Americans listened closely."
Former President Clinton urged mourners to follow
in her footsteps, honor her husband's sacrifice and help
the couple's children fulfill their parents' legacy. Former
President Bush said the "world is a kinder and gentler
place because of Coretta Scott King." President Carter
praised the Kings for their ability to "wage a fierce strug
gle for freedom and justice and to do it peacefully."
The funeral at times turned political, with some
speakers decrying the war in Iraq, the Bush administra
tion's eavesdropping program, and the sluggish response
to Hurricane Katrina in mostly black New Orleans.
The Rev. Joseph Lowery. who co-founded the South
ern Christian Leadership Conference with Martin
Luther King Jr.. drew a roaring standing ovation when he
said: "For war, billions more, but no more for the poor"
— a takeoff on a line from a Stevie Wonder song. The
comment drew head shakes from Bush and his father as
they sat behind the pulpit.
ITie lavish service stood in sharp contrast to the 1%8
funeral for King's husband. President Lyndon B. Johnson
did not attend those services, which were held in the
much smaller and older Ebenezer Church in Atlanta,

where King had preached.
Johnson did not attend because he was meeting with
advisers and Cabinet officers at Camp David to discuss
Vietnam War peace talks. There were also security con
cerns because of rioting that followed King's death, ac
cording to Betty Sue Flowers, director of Johnson's pres
idential library in Austin, Texas.
Instead, Johnson declared a national day of mourning
and sent Vice President Hubert Humphrey to the cere
mony in Atlanta.
Two hours after Tuesday's funeral, Coretta Scott
King's coffin was placed in a tomb near her husband's at
the King Center, which she built to promote his memory.
Her tomb is inscribed with a passage from First Corinthi
ans: "And now abide Faith. Hope, Love.These Three; but
the greatest of these is Love."

Over the past several days, more than 160,000 mourn
ers waited in long lines to pay their respects and file past
King's open casket during viewings at churches and the
Georgia Capitol, where King became the first woman
and the first black person to lie in honor.
"She made many great sacrifices," said Sean Washing
ton, 38, who drove from Tampa, Fla., with his wife and
children from a disability center to attend the funeral.
"To be in her presence once more is something that I
would definitely cherish, no matter what."
Stevie Wonder and Michael Bolton sang, giving soar
ing, gospel-infused performances. At least 14 U.S. sena
tors attended, along with members of the House.
The youngest of the Kings' four children. Bernice, de
livered remarks that were part fiery sermon and part eu
logy. She was five when her father was assassinated.
