# OVERSEAS STUDIES
## Students look for alternatives abroad Non-Stanford options offer wide array of locations, programs 
### LAURA CARWILE STAFF WRITER 
As many students scrambled
to finish their Stanford Overseas
Studies applications on Jan. 29,
others were exploring alternative,
non-Stanford programs that
would allow them to study in
other countries.
Stanford currently offers pro
grams in such locales as Australia,
Berlin, Florence, Moscow, Ox
ford, Paris and Santiago. Each
year, however, many students find
that these options are not what
they are looking for in an over
seas studies program.
For these students, an in
creasing number of alternatives
exist, as most American univer
sities offer some form of over
seas program to which any stu

dent may apply.
While issues regarding credit
transfers, differing tuitions and fi
nancial aid deter some from ap
plying to or attending non-Stan
ford programs, most students who
do choose to go abroad with an
other university said they believe
the experience was worth the
extra effort.
One of the more popular alter
natives is the Semester at Sea pro
gram, which is currently hosted by
the University of Pittsburgh. It
will technically become the do
main of the University of Virginia
beginning this fall.
Students who attend Semester
at Sea spend a little over three
months on a cruise ship, traveling
all over the world while simulta
neously taking classes.
Junior Ashley Matheus, who
experienced this option during
fall quarter, said that she decid
ed to go abroad through a non-
Stanford program mainly be
cause she wanted the variety
that Semester at Sea offered rather
than be isolated in one country for
so long.
"[Semester at Sea] was amazing,"
she said. "1 went to so many beauti
ful places and had the greatest expe
riences. I made great friends who
were from all over the place, which
was nice because the people you
meet aren't from Stanford, so you
learn from them."
Matheus added that she thinks
she would not have been as satisfied
with a Stanford overseas program.
"Nothing Stanford offers can
compare to Semester at Sea," she
said. "The programs here are great,
and 1 recommend them for people
who know where they want to study.
But for me, being in so many differ
ent places and having so many great
memories was unbelievable. I just
wouldn't have found that in Chile or
Florence."
Sophomore Lee Trope chose to
go abroad through a non-Stanford
program for a different reason. An
international relations major with a
focus in Africa, Trope decided to
look elsewhere because Stanford
currently only offers one very selec
tive program on the continent —, in
Cape Town — during winter quar
ter.
Eventually, Trope found the
School for International Training,
and recently applied for their pro
gram in South Africa. Pending ac
ceptance, she may find herself study

ing there next fall.
"The application was different, of
course," she said. "But I enjoyed fill
ing it out. I got to write a letter to my
host family, which was the best part,
because 1 realized that I would actu
ally be living there."
Trope added that she wanted her
experience abroad to be truly mem
orable, and that she had to explore
non-Stanford options in order to
find something that genuinely fit her
interests.
"I didn't want to go abroad just to
say I did," she said. "1 wanted to love
the place where I'd be living for so
long, and really care about what I
was doing there. The places that
Stanford sends their students to are
amazing. They just weren't the right
places for me."
Sophomore Cameron Grace
echoed Trope's sentiment. Explain
ing that he very much wanted to
study abroad in Spain, Grace ex
plained that had Stanford sponsored
a program there, he would have ap
plied.
"It would be a lot easier to go
abroad to a Stanford campus in
terms of credits and application
process," he said. "But since Stan
ford doesn't offer a Spain program
and since that's where I want to go, I
had to go through another school."
While Stanford does offer a cam
pus in Santiago, Chile, many Span
ish-speaking students would rather
go to Spain than South America.
While some speculate that Stanford
may reopen its campus in Salaman
ca, nothing has been confirmed, and
the Bing Overseas Studies Office
could not be reached for comment
by press time.
