## Bill could alter law that denies aid to student drug offenders I don't anticipate that this new legislation will have a significant impact. KAREN COOPER, Financial Aid Office 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
Thousands of student drug offenders could be
eligible for federal education aid previously denied
to them under a new federal budget bill passed by
the House of Representatives last week.The corre
sponding bill passed the Senate in December, and
President George W. Bush is expected to sign the
act into law shortly.
Karen Cooper, a staff member at Stanford's Fi
nancial Aid Office, said that the legislation is very
complex and that it impacts federal aid in several
different ways.
"One provision narrows the circumstances
under which students can be denied federal aid el
igibility based on drug conviction status," she said.
"The current regulation denies eligibility to any
one with a drug conviction as an adult. The new
regulation limits ineligibility only to those who are
convicted of sale or possession of illegal drugs
while enrolled in school and receiving Title IV aid."
Students convicted while receiving federal aid
will remain ineligible for one year for a first of
fense, two years for a second offense and indefi
nitely for a third offense. A conviction for selling
drugs will carry more severe consequences.
According to the advocacy group Students for
Sensible Drug Policy, at least 175.000 people since
20(H) have been denied federal financial aid due to

their drug records.
Because the change will mostly benefit older
students seeking to return to school after a drug
conviction, this legislation is unlikely to affect
many Stanford students directly.
"To my knowledge, the current regulation has
not had a negative impact on any Stanford stu
dents," Cooper said.
Judicial Adviser Laurette Beeson agreed.
"This law would not change any of our policies
and/or practices," she wrote in an email to Hie
Daily. "Judicial Affairs only releases information
about Honor Code and Fundamental Standard vi
olations when a student has signed a written con
sent for us to release their disciplinary records, or if
we are served with a court order."
According to Cooper, every student applying

lor federal aid answers a drug conviction question
on the application.
"[While] some students have had difficulty an
swering that question correctly...it has never result
ed in ineligibility for any of our students," she said.
"I don't anticipate that this new legislation will
have a significant impact on our operation or our
students."
Cooper went on to speak positively about the
new legislation.
"I believe this new provision gives individuals
who have had difficulty with drugs an opportunity
for a second chance," she said. "Denying educa
tional opportunities only prevents people from im
proving their circumstances. Any time we're allow-
