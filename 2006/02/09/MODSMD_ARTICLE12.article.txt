## Human rights abuses high, speaker says Talk focuses on U.S.treatment of prisoners in post-Sept. 11 world 
### MIMA MOHAMMED CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
'i tremble for my nation, but trembling is not enough,
1 have to speak and be active. Someone has to point out
the contradictions," said Imam Mahdi Bray during his
talk last night in Pigott Hall as part of Islam Awareness
Month.
Bray, a civil and human rights activist, is the executive
director of the Muslim American Society (MAS) Free
dom Foundation and the president of the Coordinating
Council of Muslim Organizations (CCMO).
Bray addressed the post-Sept. 11 practices that the
U.S. government has enacted to detain individuals —
even American citizens — and deny them their basic
rights. He also spoke on the spread of executive power
under the Bush administration while critiquing the Patri
ot Act and the powers it gives the government.
"John Ashcroft and the Bush administration have
used fear to scare the American public," he said. "Now
the executive branch has unprecedented power, even in
a system of checks and balances."
Bray spoke specifically about the Abu Ali case and
the "secret evidence" that is employed in cases in connec
tion with the detention of U.S. citizens and residents —
many of whom have been detained and held indefinitely
by the authorities since Sept. 11. — even though no
charges were filed in the majority of cases, he said.
Bray told the story of Ahmed Abu Ali, a 23-year-old
American from Texas and resident of Falls Church, Va. In
summer 2003, Ali was taking final exams at a Saudi Ara
bian university where he was studying when Saudi law

enforcement officials forcibly removed him from his
classroom and subsequently imprisoned him for 24
months.
According to Bray, Ali was found guilty by associa
tion, but returned to the United States after his friends
and family waged a legal battle with the federal govern
ment. Once back in Virginia, however, Ali faced federal
charges of conspiracy to aid and abet terrorism. Bray said
that Ali alleges he was whipped in Saudi Arabian prison
and coerced into giving a confession, which was then
used by the U.S. government to prosecute him.
Bray believes that Ali's shocking treatment should
open the eyes of Americans to the illegal actions current
ly sanctioned by the current administration. Ali is appeal
ing his conviction, but if his appeals are turned down, lie
could face up to 80 years in prison.

"Justice is not something that you can just espouse,
but you have to do it." Bray said, referring to the many
cases similar to Ali's in places such as Guantanamo Bay.
Bray was invited to Stanford on behalf of the Muslim
Student Awareness Network (MSAN) and Amnesty In
ternational.
"Although I am sick, I still came tonight," Bray said."l
came because I knew I was speaking to young people.
Young, dynamic voices for justice."
Organizers said they hoped Bray's message did not
fall on deaf ears.
"Ibe Abu Ali case did not get highlighted in the
U. 5.," said MSAN Vice President Mohammad Subeh.a
graduate student."[Tonight's talk] highlights the trans
gressions that the U.S. is making against its own civil lib
erties."
