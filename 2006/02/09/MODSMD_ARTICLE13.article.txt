## GSC addresses housing crunch Ultimate goal to provide housing for all graduate students, Munger should help 
### NICK PARKER DESK EDITOR 
The Graduate Student Council (GSC) convened last night
to discuss four potential changes in graduate student housing
with Executive Director of Student Housing Rodger Whit
ney. Also present were I lousing Services Coordinator Jessica
Engelson and Kevin Mumford,a graduate student who sits on
the Graduate Housing Advisory Committee (GHA(').
Mumford began by explaining that (iIIAC wanted to
speak with the GSC in order to gather student feedback be
fore any of the proposed changes passed through the six
member committee.
I le went on to explain that rent increases in student hous
ing are the source of many of the problems with the housing
system. According to Mumford. Stanford has experienced
revenue problems due to increased vacancy over the sum-

mers because many students do not
remain on campus. He went on to ex
plain that the four proposed policy
changes are meant to combat that
problem.
Under the current system, the
only people who can renew their cur
rent living space are couples with
children, but one of the new propos
als would extend that privilege to
couples without children, provided
they remain in their apartments over
the summer.
Currently, there are more gradu
ate students who want to live on cam
pus than there are spaces available.
Ultimately, Student Housing wants
to be able to provide housing to all
graduate students and to allow as
many as possible to simply renew
their spaces without having to enter
the housing lottery.
"Our goal is moving toward pro
viding housing for all grad. students,"
Whitney said. "When Munger is
completed, provided you are in good
academic standing and making
progress toward your degree, you'll
be in housing."
Another proposed change would
free up additional nine-month living
spaces in the Rains Houses.
Engelson told the GSC that Stu
dent Housing plans to identify about
90 spaces in Rains and offer them ex

clusively as nine-month residences
beginning next year. That way, stu
dents who know they will not be at
Stanford over the summer can
choose to live there, rather than be
forced to try to sublet their 12-month
residences.
The third proposed change was a
result of complaints by students that
they were not given enough time to
move out after graduation and some
times forced to pay rent for the sum
mer because they could not move out
in time.
"Some of our move-outs have
been a little Draconian," Engelson
said. "There might be some families
that are moving out after maybe six
years [on campus housing] of living
and they don't want to do it on the
day after graduation."
As a solution. Student Housing
is looking into the possibility of of
fering students the opportunity to
move out two, four or even six
weeks after their graduation date
without having to pay for a full sum
mer's rent.
ITie final policy change would cre
ate a new subleasing website that
would be launched in March and
would allow students to post the
dates they want to sublease their
apartments so that other students or
Stanford affiliates could review their
options.
"The new subleasing Web site will
facilitate subleasing between stu
dents and other students," Mumford
said. "It's a way to make this process
easier for everyone."
