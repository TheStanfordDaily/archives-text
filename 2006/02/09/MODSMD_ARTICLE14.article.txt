## Hindi Film Dance team places first Squad heads to New York for national championships in April 
### SHIRIN SHARIF SENIORS STAFF WRITER 
ll has taken just three years for Stanford's Hindi Film
Dance team to establish itself as the best in California, eon
firmed by its first-place finish in last weekend's Bollywood
Berkeley competition.The squad beat out traditional pow
ers UC-Berkeley, UCLA and UC-San Diego to take home
the $ 1.5(H) grand prize.
Stanford's team, named "Dil Se" — translation: "from
the heart" — also earned an automatic berth to the "Best
cjf the Best" competition, to be held in New York City in
April.
I lindi film dance is based on songs from India's prolific
Bollywood movie industry; these dances are analogous to
choreographed numbers in American musicals.
Teams take various songs from these movies and mix
them into medleys that tell stories in an eight-minute
dance routine. Iliey are judged on energy, story, choreog
raphy and synchronization.
"I definitely think that this team has improved from last
year," said team co-captain Nick Oza, a graduate student
in electrical engineering. "We have amazing chemistry,
where everyone on stage is dancing for the team, for each
other. Everyone has gone out of their way at some point to
help with the many different aspects involved in running a
production."
Dil Se was established at Stanford three years ago and
achieved some early success, but this was the squad's first
top showing.This year, the team of IS students performed
for a sold-out audience in San Francisco that included 130
Stanford friends and family members. Oza called the sup
porters the team's "19th man."
Auditions for the team are held at the beginning of
every year, with both South Asians and non-South Asians
welcome to try out.
Dil Se will face tough competition in New York. Last
year's UC-Berkeley team won first place at every compe
tition that it attended, but chose to pass up the opportuni
ty to perform at nationals. While Berkeley was considered
the unofficial victor, the actual national champion was the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
"I am definitely very excited about New York City and
our chances of success," Oza said. "We will work harder to
see if we can clean out some of the errors that we current
ly have in our routine. We will also add more awe-inspiring
moves into the dance. As a team, we will do everything we
can to make sure we don't get complacent,as the top teams
in the nation always practice like they arc number two."
The "Best of the Best" competition will feature three
film dance teams, three Garba/Raas teams and three
Bhangra teams — other styles of Indian dance.There will
be a winner for each category and an overall winner from
among the three top teams. Stanford's Raas team has been
a force to be reckoned with over the past two years,as they
took second-place at a national competition in 2004 and
won first-place last year.
Dil Se team members said they were passionate about
what they do and feel like they have gained life experience
being a part of the team.
"From practices until 11 p.m. to sewing embellishments
on costumes. I have learned so much from being on this
team," said Salima Mavani, a freshman. "Although our
practices are rigorous and time-consuming, ranging from
two to four times a week, the passion and teamwork that I
have acquired is invaluable. Being on the team has taught
me that no matter what you do, do it from the heart. Dil
Se."
Students can watch the team perform next at the
Rhythms cultural show on Feb. 24.
