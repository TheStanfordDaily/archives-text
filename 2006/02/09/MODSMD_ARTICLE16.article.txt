# V-WEEK
## BATTLING VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN "Vagina Monologues" and related events aim to raise awareness 
### CLAY BAVINGER STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford V-Day group has
been one of the most visible
student groups on campus
this week. In addition to
smaller events, the or
ganization is putting the finishing
touches on their production of

"The Vagina Monologues,
which "was pretty fun to
watch last year," says junior
Jessica Whitten. "1 can't
wait to see it again."

Monday the group of
fered a self-defense
workshop; yesterday
they organized a panel;
and all week long they
are tabling in White
Plaza selling tickets to
the show and informing
students about the re
sources available to
women on campus.

This week is V-Week,
the week that 1,115 pro
ductions of "'Die Vagina
Monologues" will be per
formed around the world,
mostly on college campuses.

The broad goal of V-Day is
to stop violence against
women. All money raised from
donations and ticket sales will be
given to charities which focus on
helping women who have been sexual
ly offended. Ninety percent of the money
the Stanford chapter of V-Day collects will
go to the charity it has chosen â€” Community
Overcoming Relationship Abuse (CORA)
which serves victims and survivors of domestic abuse
in San Mateo Countv.

The other 10 percent will benefit the Comfort Women Cam
paign (CWC). which the V-Dav national organization selected as

this year's second charity. The CWC helps
women from all parts of Asia who were forced
to become sexual slaves of Japanese military
officers during World War 11.
Last year, the Stanford V-Day group donat
ed approximately $11,000 to charity groups.

and they hope to donate at least as much this year, accord
ing to "The Vagina Monologues" director Allison
McKenzie.

The Stanford V-Day group has about 35
student members, who are either inv'olved
with "The Vagina Monologues" or work
as Vagina Warriors, who help coordi
nate all the other events of V-Week.
Lacking from the group, however,
are men.

"For some reason, a lot of
people think "Hie Vagina Mono
logues' is a man-bashing show,"
says McKenzie. "But it's not.
It's really a man-loving show."
McKenzie thinks the
blunt name of the produc
tion may intimidate men
and make them think they
aren't welcome. In fact,
one male freshman, who
wished to remain anony
mous, agrees.
"I feel like the women
are angry at men in gener
al," he says.
However, this is not the
case.

"I open the play with a
monologue about a pleasura
ble sexual experience,"
McKenzie says.
This year V-Day really

wants to emphasize the commu
nity aspect of the show. Violence
against women "is everybody's prob
lem," McKenzie says. Though men are
less frequently directly affected,"it could
be your mom or your sister being raped."
To interest men, V-Day made chocolate vagi
nas. which McKenzie calls "pretty realistic look
ing" to sell at the play. They also have started a Men

Against Violence pledge, through which men can voluntar
ily sign a pledge not to commit violence against women and to
speak out against it.The pledge list is available in Kresge Audito
rium and with many Peer Health Educators.

In addition to "The Vagina Monologues,"
after Thursday night's performance, V-Day
will host a question-and-answer session after
tonight's performance. Afterward, the
PHE's will lead a discussion in their dormi
tories about sexual violence.
