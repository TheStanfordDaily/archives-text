# Asia's Aesthetics, Hollywood's Style: Korean festival opens
## 
### JANET KIM 
The culturally adventurous and the cinemat
ically inclined are in luck: from Feb. 9 to Feb. 11,
three major motion pictures from the 2006 San
Francisco Korean American Film Festival will
be screened at Stanford, thanks to a joint effort
between KoreanStudiesinMediaArts(KlM A)
and the Walter H. Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Re
search Center.The screenings of "Murder.Take
One,"'The Duelist"and"Taegukgi"will be held
at Cubberley Auditorium and are open to the
general public free of cost.
"Murder. Take One" is a psychological
thriller with a twist: a team of prosecutors, led
by Young-gi Choe (Seung-won Cha) must
solve the murder of a successful, attractive ad
vertising executive who was discovered
stabbed to death in her hotel room-and they
must do it on live television. Though police ar
rest the probable culprit at the scene of the
crime-Young-hoon Kim (Ha-gyun Shin),a vio
lently jaded man who is found at hotel-Choe
must reckon with conflicting testimonies from
a motley bunch of witnesses, the stony rage of
the suspect and the sway that the media holds
over the entire process.Through fast-paced, hi
larious dialogue, two charismatic leads in Cha
and Shin, and a solid ensemble of character ac
tors, director Jin Jang creates a trendy black

comedy that is incisive in its social criticism. It
will be screened tonight at 7:00 p.m.
" Hie Duelist," which will play tomorrow at
7:00 p.m.. is made in the more traditional mold
of Asian martial arts epics. Set in a romanticized
version of Korea in the Chosun dynasty era,
"The Duelist"follows Namsoon (Ji-won Ha),a
sword-wielding detective and duelist, as she
and her superior Ahn (Sung-ki An) probe a
counterfeit scandal. The essence of the movie,
however, lies in the tension between Namsoon
and Sad Eyes (Dong-won Gang), the assassin
who has been hired to kill her by the man behind
the conspiracy. Director Myung-se Lee uses
dazzling choreography and a vividly imagined
Chosun society as a backdrop against which the
two characters' fierce struggle to kill each other
turns into an impossible love. Lee, who is criti
cally lauded for a cinematographic style that
blurs the line between the fantastic and the re
alistic, will be available for a question-and-an
swer session following the screening.
As the most commercially successful of the
three films. "Taegukgi" defies conventional
movie genres. The story of two brothers in the
Korean War. "Taegukgi" combines the rough
masculinity of a war epic with complex psycho
logical nuances. When Jin-suk (Bin Won), the
frail, scholarly younger brother of Jin-tae
(Dong-gun Jang),is drafted into the South Ko

rean army, Jin-tae also enlists, determined to
keep his younger brother out of combat. The
film chronicles the changes that overcome the
two brothers as they are exposed to war, fol
lowing them through a long and violent war in
which they lose not only each other, but also
their innocence and ideals. In a signature style
that he has been perfecting over the course of
his directorial career, director Je-gvu Kang
raises numerous ethical and political questions
about warfare and the divided Koreas in this
seminal work. Kang, a household name in
Korea, will be available foi a question-and-an
swer session after the 5:00 p.m. screening on
Saturday, Feb. 11.
This year's event marks the fourth year that
KIM A has showcased landmark films from the
Korean and Korean-American film industries.
Centered around the theme of "Beyond Bor
ders: Demystifying the Korean Image Through
the Media Arts." the program seeks to increase
the public exposure of Korean and Korean-
American work in the media arts, as well as to
facilitate discourse about these works. The
films that will be shown at Stanford are three of
29 films that are being screened in venues
around the Bay Area. The festival features
films by Korean-American filmmakers, docu
mentaries about the Koreas, and shorter narra
tive films, in addition to major blockbusters

from South Korea.
The program also includes a series of public
forums, in which directors, producers, actors
and academics will engage in panel discussions
about contemporary issues in Korean and Ko
rean-American filmmaking. Tomorrow, Stan
ford will host an academic symposium titled
"Globalization and Contemporary Korean
Cinema," which centers on the unique ability
of Korean films to combine elements of Holly
wood blockbusters with traditional Asian aes
thetics, and the implications that this has on the
future of Korean films in international cultural
sectors. Held in the Okimoto Room of Encina
Hall from 3:(X) to 5:(M) p.m.. the seminar is open
to the general public.
Although most students admitted to know
ing very little about Korean cinema, many
were enthusiastic about these film screenings.
"I watch Korean dramas sometimes, and
they're a fun and interesting distraction from
the real world." says sophomore Gloria
Hoang. "1 guess I'm looking forward to Kore
an movies being the same."
Senior Allison McKenzie agrees. "I think it's
great that the Korean community is doing
this," she says. "Films seem more accessible
than other outreach efforts, because they show
the culture, and they tell stories that we're in
terested in hearing."

the real world." says sophomore Gloria
Hoang. "1 guess I'm looking forward to Kore
an movies being the same."
Senior Allison McKenzie agrees. "I think it's
great that the Korean community is doing
this," she says. "Films seem more accessible
than other outreach efforts, because they show

The culturally adventurous and the cinemat
ically inclined are in luck: from Feb. 9 to Feb. 11,
three major motion pictures from the 2006 San
Francisco Korean American Film Festival will
be screened at Stanford, thanks to a joint effort
between KoreanStudiesinMediaArts(KlM A)
and the Walter H. Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Re
search Center.The screenings of "Murder.Take
One,"'The Duelist"and"Taegukgi"will be held
at Cubberley Auditorium and are open to the
general public free of cost.
"Murder. Take One" is a psychological
thriller with a twist: a team of prosecutors, led
by Young-gi Choe (Seung-won Cha) must
solve the murder of a successful, attractive ad
vertising executive who was discovered
stabbed to death in her hotel room-and they
must do it on live television. Though police ar
rest the probable culprit at the scene of the
crime-Young-hoon Kim (Ha-gyun Shin),a vio
lently jaded man who is found at hotel-Choe
must reckon with conflicting testimonies from
a motley bunch of witnesses, the stony rage of
the suspect and the sway that the media holds
over the entire process.Through fast-paced, hi
larious dialogue, two charismatic leads in Cha
and Shin, and a solid ensemble of character ac
tors, director Jin Jang creates a trendy black

comedy that is incisive in its social criticism. It
will be screened tonight at 7:00 p.m.
" Hie Duelist," which will play tomorrow at
7:00 p.m.. is made in the more traditional mold
of Asian martial arts epics. Set in a romanticized
version of Korea in the Chosun dynasty era,
"The Duelist"follows Namsoon (Ji-won Ha),a
sword-wielding detective and duelist, as she
and her superior Ahn (Sung-ki An) probe a
counterfeit scandal. The essence of the movie,
however, lies in the tension between Namsoon
and Sad Eyes (Dong-won Gang), the assassin
who has been hired to kill her by the man behind
the conspiracy. Director Myung-se Lee uses
dazzling choreography and a vividly imagined
Chosun society as a backdrop against which the
two characters' fierce struggle to kill each other
turns into an impossible love. Lee, who is criti
cally lauded for a cinematographic style that
blurs the line between the fantastic and the re
alistic, will be available for a question-and-an
swer session following the screening.
As the most commercially successful of the
three films. "Taegukgi" defies conventional
movie genres. The story of two brothers in the
Korean War. "Taegukgi" combines the rough
masculinity of a war epic with complex psycho
logical nuances. When Jin-suk (Bin Won), the
frail, scholarly younger brother of Jin-tae
(Dong-gun Jang),is drafted into the South Ko

rean army, Jin-tae also enlists, determined to
keep his younger brother out of combat. The
film chronicles the changes that overcome the
two brothers as they are exposed to war, fol
lowing them through a long and violent war in
which they lose not only each other, but also
their innocence and ideals. In a signature style
that he has been perfecting over the course of
his directorial career, director Je-gvu Kang
raises numerous ethical and political questions
about warfare and the divided Koreas in this
seminal work. Kang, a household name in
Korea, will be available foi a question-and-an
swer session after the 5:00 p.m. screening on
Saturday, Feb. 11.
This year's event marks the fourth year that
KIM A has showcased landmark films from the
Korean and Korean-American film industries.
Centered around the theme of "Beyond Bor
ders: Demystifying the Korean Image Through
the Media Arts." the program seeks to increase
the public exposure of Korean and Korean-
American work in the media arts, as well as to
facilitate discourse about these works. The
films that will be shown at Stanford are three of
29 films that are being screened in venues
around the Bay Area. The festival features
films by Korean-American filmmakers, docu
mentaries about the Koreas, and shorter narra
tive films, in addition to major blockbusters

from South Korea.
The program also includes a series of public
forums, in which directors, producers, actors
and academics will engage in panel discussions
about contemporary issues in Korean and Ko
rean-American filmmaking. Tomorrow, Stan
ford will host an academic symposium titled
"Globalization and Contemporary Korean
Cinema," which centers on the unique ability
of Korean films to combine elements of Holly
wood blockbusters with traditional Asian aes
thetics, and the implications that this has on the
future of Korean films in international cultural
sectors. Held in the Okimoto Room of Encina
Hall from 3:(X) to 5:(M) p.m.. the seminar is open
to the general public.
Although most students admitted to know
ing very little about Korean cinema, many
were enthusiastic about these film screenings.
"I watch Korean dramas sometimes, and
