## Editorial True dialogue must be reasoned and respectful 
### 
Four months ago, the Danish newspaper
Jyllands-Posten published 12 cartoons
reflecting various views. Several were
especially offensive to Muslims, including
one depicting the Prophet Muhammad as a
suicide bomber and a lit fuse in his turban.
The controversy has slowly built up until it
exploded last week when angry mobs
torched the Danish embassies in Lebanon
and Syria. While this controversy might
seem far removed from the Stanford Bub
ble, we believe that this example holds les
sons for on-campus dialogues.
To be sure, the cartoons published in Jyl
lands-Posten were unfair and inaccurate in
their portrayal of Islam. They did not repre
sent the views of a majority of Muslims in the
world. We fail to see how the cartoons could
have led to any form of constructive debate
and believe that the decision to publish these
cartoons was both imprudent and injudicious.
A great deal of public outrage, however,
was directed toward the Danish govern
ment, who refused to prosecute those in
volved in the publication of the cartoons, cit
ing the need to preserve freedom of speech.
We believe that the Danish government was
justified in its decision. If Jyllands-Posten's
readers were offended, they could simply
cancel their subscription. But being offend
ed by someone's words is hardly justification
for initiating legal proceedings against them.
After all, freedom of speech is necessary for
constructive debate and dialogue. Were the
cartoons excessive? Yes. Does that mean
that they should have been censored? No.
We must remember that while one has
the right to be offended, one is equally free
to ignore offensive remarks. If this or any
other editorial upsets you, you are welcome
to put your paper down, quit reading The
Daily, or write a Letter to the Editor and
complain. No broader right exists — this
would curtail the right of others to their free
speech. Though some may be offended by
particular statements, the solution is not to
punish those making the statements.
The very existence of official punish
ments, whatever their severity, serves to si

lence discourse on those subjects. The chief
editor of Jyllands-Posten commented that
another caricature of Muhammad would
likely not be published for another genera
tion, and that he would not have published
the cartoons had he known the conse
quences of his decision. As his statement
showed, the overreaction to these cartoons
helped to silence dialogue, an act that only
strengthens the hand of those unwilling to
engage in debate. Unfortunately, the Jyl
land-Posten affair has handed evidence to
European xenophobes who argue that the
integration of Muslim immigrants is impos
sible and who have helped persuade the
Arab world that the West hates Islam.
The Jyllands-Posten controversy also re
minds us to keep in mind a broader perspec
tive when dealing with controversial issues.
Jyllands-Posten might be the widest-circu
lating newspaper in Denmark, but it still
reaches only around half as many people as,
for example. The San Jose Mercury News.
One insult to the Prophet should not have
generated anger spanning the Muslim
world. It should not have resulted in angry
mobs torching embassies or forced the 12
cartoonists who drew the caricatures into
hiding due to death threats.
While Stanford students are hopefully
unlikely to burn down the Haas Center for
Public Service or the Bechtel International
Center if intra-campus animosities rise, we
should remember to try to turn our disagree
ments into reasoned debates rather than
verbal firelights. After all, the effect of emo
tional escalation is often the silencing of ra
tional discussion. We should remember this
lesson when encountering views with which
we violently disagree.
On Jan. 24, Stanford's pro-choice and
pro-life groups marked the 33rd anniversary
of Roe vs. Wade with peaceful demonstra
tion. No doubt, ideas were exchanged and
views were challenged. But such reasoned
discussions bring out our best in the quest
for knowledge and search for morality —
not our base instincts to quiet those whose
opinions make us uncomfortable.
