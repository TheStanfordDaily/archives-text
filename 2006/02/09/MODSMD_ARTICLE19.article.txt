# The
						knell of parting day: Let all goodbyes be said
## 
### 
The curfew tolls the knell of parting
day./The lowing herd winds slowly
o'er the lea." wrote the poet Thomas
Gray in "Elegy Written in a Churchyard."
And as I embrace my column for the last
time, as 1 light my words up with the fire of
my soul once again, I too feel "the knell of
parting day." An inscrutable nostalgia grips
the sinews of my heart and leaves me in par
alyzing wonder. "The ploughman home
ward plods his weary way,/And leaves the
world to darkness and to me."
Yet there are words swelling up in my
chest. There are thoughts and emotions
that must touch these tender pages before
I return to that silence that gave voice to
me. 1 sigh as I gaze into the depth of this
blind night.
First. I must speak of my readers â€” my
true readers. Austrian philosopher Ludwig
Wittgenstein wrote boldly in the preface to
his monumental work Tractatus Logico-
Philosophicus,"lts object would be attained
if it afforded pleasure to only one person
who read it with understanding." With same
boldness, I declare that the purpose of
Noumena has been attained if there is one
single free soul who read it with both under
standing and pleasure. 1 declare victory if
only a single pair of eyes read Noumena with
silent but subtle appreciation. I ascribe my
self glory if a single mind laughed while all
others read me in seriousness.
To this reader par excellence, 1 owe an ex
planation of my leaving. First of all. my
words lack the sharpness, the wit and the
mastery of my masters, and I am continually
disappointed by the mediocrity of my writ
ing. Who are my masters of writing. I hear
you ask. No. no. they are not your PWR in
structors who made me hate writing and al
most give up on it. Let it be known! They are
your Friedrich Nietzsches and Carl Jungs
and Chuck Palahniuks and Fyodor Dosto
evskys and Amy Hempels and others! (And
of course, thanks to my editors Whitney
Sado and Michael Miller who have taught
me more than any PWR instructor can.)
Coup de grace was Amy Hempel's story
"Harvest," that feminine narrative whose el
egance and strength lies in its terseness and
bleakness.
I could live with mediocrity, though.since
I had my flashes of brilliance that like a me
teor, evanescently blazed the heavens and
disappeared. ITie Ilirkish poet Atilla Ilhan
wrote,"An invisible cemetery is time." I. too,
felt that, as time passed. I began to lose all
strength and will to write. Each word I wrote
became more and more burdensome. I*he

passing of time, that invisible cemetery, was
slowly strengthening its grip on me. That in
stinct to write was slowly disappearing. I was
heading for an artistic death. Before all will
to write was drained, I wanted to give myself
some breathing room.
How these last words pour out! How
easily they find expression! How joyfully
my feelings and thoughts unite with my
words! For a long time, writing hadn't felt
this good. This gives me hope that one day,
you, the anxious reader, and I may meet
somewhere else.
What time does and what things it takes
away... I feel that each moment is some sort
of nothingness that stretches itself to eterni
ty. Life progresses, but I feel stuck at one
point,forever."What does it matter if I write
or not?" I ask myself. "What difference does
it make whether people read me or not?
What is so significant if these words reach
someone? Is there not an eternal silence that
encompasses us all? Are we not all human?"
As paradoxical as it might seem, at moments
that make feel like this. 1 feel a violent urge
to accomplish some moral good. I feel a
pressing need to sacrifice myself so that at
least I reduce some human suffering.
Perhaps. I am mistaken. Perhaps, life is
what people tell me it is. Perhaps, we can
make meaning if it's not there on its own.
Perhaps, life isn't a collection of disjoint mo
ments but a linear progression and develop
ment of a being. Perhaps, there is hope.
But I shrug. The child in me is not quite
convinced yet.
One day. you. too, perhaps will reach the
depths I have reached. One day. you too will
bathe in cynicism and irony. And that day,
you may remember these words, my true
reader,and tell it to others around you:"I am
a well of meaning. Cast down your bucket
n0w..."
As the darkness of night etherizes my
soul. 1 can hear you. the reader, chiding me
the way Karl Marx on his death bed chided
his butler:"Go on,get out. Last words are for
fools who haven't said enough."
