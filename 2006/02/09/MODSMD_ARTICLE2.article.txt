## Card face crucial road weekend 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
This weekend's set of road contests for the Stanford
men's basketball team looks like the most important
weekend of the entire season. Not only are they taking
on No. 5 Gonzaga this Saturday in Spokane, but they
must first head to Berkeley tonight to duke it out with
a Cal team that is on a roll and hungry to avenge its 14-
point loss in Palo Alto earlier this season.
The good news for Stanford (12-7, 8-3 Pac-10) is
that it is playing its best basketball of the season, win
ning five straight and eight of its last nine — but there
is no doubt that this weekend's opponents provide an
enormous challenge as well as a monumental opportu
nity.
The Cardinal are in desperate need of road wins
against quality teams in order to strengthen their tour
nament push, and Gonzaga (18-3,9-0 West Coast Con
ference) and Cal (14-6,8-3 Pac-10) are prime targets.
Cal is in the tournament hunt itself after winning
four straight, including a victory over then-No. 10
Washington. A victory over Stanford would signifi-
cantly boost the Bears' position as
the season starts to wind down.
The first time Stanford and Cal
met this season, the Cardinal came
out on top at Maples Pavilion, 75-
61. Senior guard Chris Hernandez
and senior forward Matt Haryasz
carried the offensive load. Hernan
dez hit all six of his field goal at
tempts (including five three-point
ers) on his way to 20, while Haryasz
dumped in 24 points and collected
10 rebounds.
"We played pretty well when we
were here — it's not that Cal played
badly," Hernandez said. "Every
thing was going on for us. If we're
not playing really well again, it's
going to be a tough game."
In addition, the Card could be
without leading scorer Haryasz,
who is still recovering from a
swollen eye suffered late in the first
half against Oregon State last Satur
day. He was able to practice in non
contact drills on Wednesday for the
first time since the injury,and will be
a game-time decision.
His absence would be a huge
loss, especially in defending Cal's
two excellent post players, sopho
mores Leon Powe (18.6 points, 10.7
rebounds) and DeVon Hardin (8.5
points, 7.0 rebounds). If Haryasz is
unable to play, much of the defen
sive responsibility would be left up
to sophomore center Peter Prowitt,
who feels confident with the indi
vidual match-up.
"Sometimes I feel like when we
play against teams that run a power
or small forward at the center spot,
that's a tougher match-up for me to
run around and try to contest jump
shots," Prowitt said.

"But Powe and
Hardin are big guys
who like to score in
side, so that's a little
bit better for what
I'm good at."
Cal presents
match-up problems
on the outside, where
guards Richard
Midgley and Ayinde
Übaka are some of
the best outside
shooters in the con
ference, Übaka suf
fered a sprained
ankle in Cal's game
at Oregon last week
end, but after a light
week of practice he is
expected to play
tonight.
"[Ubaka has] be
come a lot more ag
gressive this year,
and improved out
side shooting makes
it more difficult to
guard him," Hernan
dez said. "He makes

plays for other people besides him
self. He can do it all."
Saturday against Gonzaga, Stan
ford will face another player who
can make a defender's night miser
able— junior forward Adam Mor
rison, the nation's leading scorer at
28.4 points per game. Many experts
expect Morrison, who fills it up both
from the outside and the inside, to
be the number-one pick in the NBA
Draft this spring if he decides to
leave school.
The bad news for Stanford is that
Morrison is just one of the Bulldogs'
offensive threats. Forward / center
J. P. Batista isaveragingjustshyof2o
points per game, and guard Derek
Raivio also averages in double fig
ures.
Raivio is also one of the few
players in the country more success
ful from the free-throw line than
Chris Hernandez. The Gonzaga
guard leads the nation, shooting
%.4 percent from the charity stripe.
Adding to the magnitude of the
game will be the national television
audience watching on ESPN. Also
broadcasting from Spokane, Wash,
will be "College GameDay," a lead
ing college basketball preview show,
and one that will have never traveled
west of Kansas prior to Saturday.
Add it all up and the Cardinal
have a huge opportunity to make a
national impression against two
very good opponents.
"Every game is pretty much
must-win for us," senior guard Dan
Grunfeld said. "You can't win them
all, but you really do have to ap
proach it with that mindset because
they're that important."

Senior center Matt Haryasz is still recovering from a bruised left eye muscle suffered when Oregon State forward Sasa Cuic
accidentally jabbed him in the eye with his finger. Haryasz has been seeing double and will be a game-time decision.
