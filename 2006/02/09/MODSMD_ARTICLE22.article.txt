# The
						power and the glory
## 
### 
I was sitting in the computer cluster in
Berlin, preparing to serve up another mis
sive about the debauchery of studying
abroad, when an onlooker chimed in.
"Do you realize how much power you
have?" she asked. 1 laughed, but she contin
ued. pointing to a few lines 1 had written in
my last column about our trip to Latvia.
"Most of the people who read this have never
even heard of Latvia, and when they think
about it from now on, they will remember
what you wrote."
From my perspective, this column was
supposed to be a glib little piece that people
chuckled at over their Cocoa Crisp and
promptly forgot. The chance that people
might actually be forming opinions of the
people or places in my columns, or. God for
bid, impressions of me, is frankly frighten
ing.
If you sat down and read my past 13
columns, I, for one, come off looking pretty
badly. The person that comes to life is a
swashbuckling, alcoholic smartass who, if e
mails and letters to the editor are to be be
lieved, is also a bad writer, spoiled, vapid and
racist. Oh, and I can't play rugby.
Am I all those things? Three months ago,
I would have said no. And 1 still maintain
that I'm not racist â€” one of my best friends
is black (that's a cliche joke, for those keep
ing score). But as I look back at my work, I
think the portrait most people drew from it

is probably true. Every Tuesday night I
stared at the blinking cursor on my comput
er. and instead of seeing a window onto new
worlds and ideas, I saw a mirror, and I wrote
what I saw.
Sure, we had some laughs, but that's all we
had. Look to your left on this page and you'll
see a very long and very boring column about
some philosophical bullshit. But at least that
guy is trying to expand his readers' horizons.
All I managed to do was piss off a lot of people
(parents, advisors, Ujamaa and Murray resi
dents, an indie band and OSP). Yeah, a lot of
people (mostly my friends) liked reading it,
and the good people at Old Spice even sent
me a care package filled with deodorant and
soap after my column on hygiene.
I can't help thinking that maybe I missed
a chance to actually influence people. At the
time, I didn't think that's what people want
ed. Studies continue to show that in the age
of FOX News and partisan politics, people
like to read, see and hear things that confirm

what they believe. I thought that you liked
to open up the paper every Thursday, know
ing you could have a good laugh at joker
Dave Herbert, confident that his column
would confirm everything you "knew" about
me.
I sought to maintain this Hemingway
esque persona, and it often kept me from
writing more thoughtful pieces. I never
wrote about what it's like to study the faces
of strangers on a Berlin subway, to guess
what they are like, to wonder if any of them
are your distant cousins or if one of them
took a potshot at your great-uncle during
World War 11. I didn't describe how exhila
rating it is to carry on even a brief conversa
tion in German, to never once speak Eng
lish. and to leave knowing that you fit in. I
never told you how it feels when you walk
home drunk one night, strange shop win
dows lighting your path, and you realize how
utterly far away you are from everyone who
loves you, and how the loneliness hits you
like a brick in your stomach.
I hope the person that takes over these
few square inches next week will do a better
job than I did. As for me, I'll go back to writ
ing news and serving up controversy the old
fashioned way.

E-mail Dave Herbert at dherhert@stan

had person.
