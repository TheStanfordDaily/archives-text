HPV vaccine slated for FDA review
Hie new editorial board's editorial on the
HPV vaccine is undermined by a simple fac
tual error. As reported by Reuters and others
on Feb.7,the FDA has put Merck's HPV vac
cine on a "priority" review, meaning its appli
cation will be processed faster than most
drugs. This is contrary to the Board's claim
that the vaccine is being "backlogged" and
"blocked." While I understand that this edi
torial may have been written before the
Reuters article, I wonder what kind of
sources led the Editorial Board to believe
what they did.
Although I share the editorial board's
concern over the Bush Administration's sub
stitution of ideology for science regarding

medical issues, making such strong and spe
cific claims without offering supporting evi
dence undermines its credibility. I hope that
future editorials will be held to a higher stan
dard of fact-checking.

Editor's note: The Editorial Board was not aware of
this dei elopment at the time of publication. We apolo
gize for the error.
Israel must be held to the same
ethical standards
In his op-cd ("Providing Hamas aid
would be unethical", Feb.B), Ross David
Bayer is incorrect in saying that I claimed

Hamas is not a terrorist organization. In fact,
I said the reverse in my article. What I said
was that the term "terrorist" is used in a po
litical and biased fashion to discredit the
Palestinians, while Israelis are not held to the
same ethical standards.
The term "terrorist" is apt for Hamas, but
we also ought to direct our moral opprobri
um toward Israeli violence against civilians.
We must not forget that Israel has roots in
terrorist actions too.
When the media fails to hold Israel to the
same standard of moral conduct in dealing
with the Palestinians, it reveals the double
standard in our attitude toward the Israelis
and Palestinians.
