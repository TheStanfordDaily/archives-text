In yesterday's article "Changes pro
posed for Constitution," there were several
notable inaccuracies. First, the changes dis
cussed at the meeting were proposed
amendments to the Student Judicial Char
ter. the University document governing Ju
dicial Affairs, not the ASSU Constitution.
Second. Laurette Beeson, identified as a
staff member in the Office of Student Af
fairs, is actually an assistant dean and judi

cial adviser in the Office of Judicial Affairs.
Third. the 15-member committee that Bee
son referred to during the meeting is not the
committee that proposed the changes;
rather, they were proposed by the Board on
Judicial Affairs. Also,The Daily inaccurate
ly reported that one of the charter amend
ments was to change the word "guilty" to
"responsible." when it is actually the other
way around.

Importantly, ASSU Financial Manager
Justin Fishner-Wolfson did not state that spe
cial-fees refund results would be posted on
the ASSU Web site. They are not, nor will
they be, posted online.
Lastly, the Joint Legislative Bill 5 was not
ratified at the meeting, as it was only ap
proved by the Senate. The ASSU Graduate
Student Council must still vote on the bill in
order for it to be ratified.
