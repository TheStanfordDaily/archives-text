## The 						women hope to retain their place atop the Pac-10 heap UCSB, Cal await Card 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES STAFF WRITER 
After a pair of 2()-plus-point wins over Oregon
and Oregon State, the women's basketball team
eases into the weekend with today's visit from
non-conferenee opponent UC-Santa Barbara.
Then though, comes a greater challenge. On
Saturday, the Cardinal will travel across the Bay to
face a revitalized California team.
Cal has shown newfound strength. The Bears
trail Stanford 45-15 in the all-time series, but
played with uncharacteristic intensity during their
January visit. ITie Cardinal trailed until 7:33 re
mained in the first half, and, despite a 87-75 win.
saw that the cross-Bay rivalry had forcefully re
turned.
Cal's home-court advantage this time will fur
ther add to the competitive atmosphere.
"1 feel that they've really improved a lot,"
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "We always have a
tough game at Cal. but this year will be an especial
ly tough game with the success they're having and
the great young team they have."
Sure enough, the Bears have relied upon strong
freshman players, including center Devanei
Hampton, guard Alexis Gray-Lawson and for
ward Ashley Walker — each of whom averages
over 13 points per game.
"They're going to be fired up to play us," senior
guard Krista Rappahahn said."We definitely gave
them hope when they were here, so we're just
going to have to be prepared from the start."
In the teams' last meeting, Cal was missing
Hampton, its best player, to an undisclosed sus
pension. allegedly due to a fight. Averaging 15.8
points and with seven double-doubles this season,
the freshman awaits the Cardinal on her home
court.
"She's definitely a big part of their team, and
does really well for them,so 1 think they'll be even
more fired up and ready to go on the court with
her." Smith said, "They'll have more weapons, so
we definitely just have to be prepared and come to
play."
The Cardinal realize that the Bears will come
out strong in the first half, as they did in January.
"I think one of the strengths of this team is their
aggressiveness," VanDerveer said."l like how hard
they play and how aggressive they are. [The fresh
men) don't care that they're freshmen — they just
come out and battle."
Stanford will look to match the intensity.
"[Aggression is] something we've been work
ing on all year," Smith said. "We haven't played
that well in the first half, so I think it's important
for us to come out and just be aggressive from the
very start, set the tone early and not let them get
what they want."
Despite the threat to its record, the team is
happy to see a revamped rivalry.
"We're excited that they're doing so well and
that we have a Bay Area battle again," Van-
Derveer said.
Meanwhile, Stanford hasn't played against
UCSB since 2(X)I, when it dominated 87-64, but

the Gauchos still present a test as the second
place team in the Big West conference.
"They have a great program," VanDerveer
said. "We've played them before in the NCAA
Tournament, but we've never really established a
home or away series. I think it'll be an excellent
experience for us, and we're excited."
TTie Gauchos are strong on the road this sea
son. posting four straight wins. Although Stanford
leads a 7-1 series, playing a team dominant in its
own conference will prove valuable.
"It'll be good for us to play someone outside
the league," junior center Brooke Smith said."lt's
just a good opportunity for us to play a different
team."
