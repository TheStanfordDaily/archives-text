# Fans face February funk
## Bring on the Winter Olympics; we're that desperate for sports drama 
### 
So the Super Bowl is over, we've still
got n few weeks left until pitchers
and catchers report, the NBA is
trapped in that torturous midseason
spot where most of the drama is on hold
until the playoffs ... and of course, no
body watches hockey. But not to worry
the Olympics are here. And if you're
like me, your first reaction to that was.
"Really?"
We've officially entered the most
dreaded month of the year for the na
tional sports scene — February. In some
ways, it's usually pretty funny to watch
the F.SPN talking heads scramble for
something to gab about before the onset
of March Madness. But even that dies
amid the ramblings on tournament
seeding by Dick "Dukie V" Vitale and
Billy "P-ACC-e-r" Packer.
Yes Dick, I do know how good Duke
is. Save it for March.
It's a natural lull, and one that every
one has come to expect. After the huge
ratings the Super Bowl raked in on Sun
day, you might expect the drop-off to be
slightly more pronounced this year —
but otherwise, nothing unusual, right?
This year, however, they've got an
out. The Torino 2006 Winter Olympics
open tomorrow and they'll almost cer
tainly be a big deal in the sports media.
Because there's nothing else.
Okay viewers, it's either speed skat
ing personality Apollo Anton Ohno or
another Sean Salisbury take on Terrell
Owens. Michelle Kwan or Michael"Pin
stripe" Irvin's views on the Super Bowl
refs. Seriously — your choice, America.
I guess my point is that I don't really
have a point. But neither does anyone
else when it comes to these Olympics.
Because somehow, even in this deadest
of times for sports, Torino '06 still seems
like small news and February seems as
dead as ever.
But one man can save us from all of
that.
It's clear that what we need now is
some kind of a jolt to the system. A club
to the kneecap, if you will.
Wait — too soon for Tonya Harding
jokes?
Seriously, somebody had better test
positive for drugs or something, and
soon, or this NHL gambling debacle is
going to be the lead story for weeks.
And I'm just not sure America can take
that much hockey.
C"mon, Bode Miller. You owe it to
your country.
Let's be real for a minute. Miller's the
only one who can save us sports fans
from a month of boredom.The guy's al
ready accomplished so much with only
two quotes that essentially boil down to
his occasional drunk skiing and an at
tack on the alleged ... ahem, pharma
ceutical habits of Barry Bonds and
Lance Armstrong.
Maybe the problem is that the most
watchable sport in the Winter Games is
probably hockey. And that translates
about as well to television as George W.
Bush into Farsi.
I'll even come clean and admit that I
really do enjoy watching Olympic hock
ey. I lie rule changes from the NHL to
international play make for a more ex
citing. more wide-open game that lay
men. like myself, can more easily under
stand and enjoy. But it's not enough.
Not enough to save us all from Feb
ruary. anyway. Only Bode can do that.
Imagine. All we need from him now
is a quote that he's Kobe without the
selfishness, Peyton Manning without
the choking or Wayne Gretzky without
the gambling ring right under his nose.
Unit's why Torino '06 has a chance at
being a must-watch event. Because one
epic quote from Bode could be bigger
than Allen Ivcrson's rant on practice or
T.O.'s famous workout video.
Which, of course, leads to a moralis
tic, principled and probably boring rant
on where this country is headed if it
takes controversy to get us all interested
in anything.
Gotcha. It may be February, but not
even I have sunk that low ... yet.
