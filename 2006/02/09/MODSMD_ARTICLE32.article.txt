## Jim Plunkett's son arrested for assault 
### 
James Plunkett, Jr., the son of 1970 Heisman Tro
phy winner and former Stanlord quarterback Jim
Plunkett, was arrested on Saturday on charges of sex
ual assault with intent to commit rape. The alleged in
cident took place last Thursday at the Plunketts' home
in Atherton. Calif.
Plunkett. 22, is a former Arizona State student who was
visiting his parents when he reportedly choked and sexual
ly assaulted a woman. Plunkett's lawyer Chuck Smith says
that the woman — who has not been identified by police
— was Plunkett's girlfriend and that while no sexual con
tact occurred, the contact that did take place was consensu
al. Smith's statement appears puzzling given that the only
reported non-sexual contact was the suspected choking.
Plunkett was released later on Saturday night in lieu of
$50,(KM) bail. His arraignment has been scheduled for
March 13.
Ilie elder Plunkett won the Heisman as a senior. He
also led the Oakland Raiders to Super Bowl victories in
1981 and 1984.
