Almost every child has heard that it's
not whether you win or lose, it's about hav
ing fun. While most collegiate athletes
have since learned otherwise, the Cardinal
men's squash team swears that fun was the
name of the game at this weekend's West
ern Collegiate Squash Round Robin.
Of course, it's much easier to have a
good time when you win the entire tourna
ment.
Stanford defeated all six opponents en
route to the title, beating both Air Force
and Cal, 9-0, while polishing off UC-Davis,
Notre Dame, Washington and Southern
California by scores of 8-1.
"We were happy to win and very excit
ed. but mostly it's fun to have squash on
the West Coast," coach MarkTalbott said.
The round-robin was a landmark

event, as no other tournament has been
devoted exclusively to western teams.
Squash, although big in the eastern U.S.,
has yet to find popularity this side of the
Mississippi. Senior Jon Irvine expressed
optimism that having a western tourna
ment will "hopefully go a long way in pro
moting squash out here."
"Stanford is taking a lead to promote
West Coast squash," Talbott said. "It's im
portant especially for the starting club
teams who are exactly where we were five
years ago."
In addition to giving recently formed

teams an opportunity to play, the tourna
ment also gave "a sense of legitimacy to
teams that weren't even around when 1
was a freshman," said Levine.
"We're getting the foundations of a
community," sophomore Andrew Bur
mon said. "We're not to the point where
competition has become a driving force.so
the best we can do is form a community."
Stanford's squash program, barely
seven years old. has grown rapidly. It was
announced this past fall that the women's
team would be promoted to varsity
status starting in the fall of 2006, and
a state of the art court facility
opened in the fall of 2005 in the Ar
rillaga Center for Sports and Recre
ation.
"The new courts were the only
way we'd be able to host a tourna
ment like this," said Levine. "A lot of
the teams we hosted had never
played on international-sized courts,
so that was a huge incentive to get
them out here."
In addition to being a driving force
behind getting the courts built, Tal
bott has also played a key role in ad
vancing squash both at Stanford and
on the West Coast.
As a professional squash player,
Talbott was ranked first in the world
for 12 straight years, was the World
Professional Squash Association
Player of the Year eight times and was
three times named Olympic Athlete
of the Year.
"Mark is a huge name in squash
and has tremendous drawing power."
Burmon said."He's using his name to
create an entirely new squash legacy
in California."
Talbott, who previously led Yale's
women's squash team to their first
National Championship, believes in
the importance of developing squash
on the West Coast.
"We need to expand West Coast
squash in the universities because
that is where we're seeing the most

growth — in intercollegiate squash,"
Talbott said.
With the fun of the weekend over,
the Cardinal are preparing for Na»
tionals in two weeks at Princeton.
"We're right in the middle of the C
division, and we're hoping to do
well,"Talbott said.
Nationals present a challenge for
the men's team.
"We'll be in the underdog role,"
Levine said.
"We're not the favorite," added
junior David Herbert, a Stanford
Daily columnist. "But I think we'll
surprise some people with how we'll
we do."
One of the reasons for Stanford's
underdog status is the large number
of injuries they have dealt with this
year.
"We haven't had a full team for
any match throughout the year, due
to people being abroad or injured,"
Levine said. "And with everybody
coming back and still two weeks to
go, 1 think we have the best shot pos
sible of winning C's that we've had in
my four years here."
In addition to playing challenging
teams. Nationals gives the Cardinal a
chance to play squash in an environ
ment that they hope will someday
prevail out west.
"It's exciting," Burmon said. "You
go and it's squash mania. It's hard to
imagine out here, but I'll be playing a
match out there and there will be
over 100 people watching. It's a very
big deal."
