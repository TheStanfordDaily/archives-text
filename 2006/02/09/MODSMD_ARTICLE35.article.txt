Coming off of the Winter Cup in Las Vegas, No.
4 Stanford men's gymnastics looks to top California
for the third time this season.
In Las Vegas, five Stanford gymnasts participat
ed. Sophomores David Sender and Jason Shen were
all-around competitors while sophomore Sho
Nakamori and juniors Alex Schorsch and Dylan
Carney competed in specific events.
Sender finished fourth in the all-around compe
tition, retaining his position on the U.S. National
team. He also finished first on vault, fifth on rings,
eighth on parallel bars and 10th on floor exercise.
In individual events, Schorsch finished fourth on
rings and fourth overall after the second day of
competition. Carney finished second on the floor
exercise.
The Winter Cup offered some insight for the
Cardinal as they prepare for the season ahead of
them.
"Many of the other gymnasts at Winter Cup
were NCAA athletes, so competing there let us see
the best guys that the other teams have to offer."
Sender said. "'Honestly, I was not all that impressed,
and I think we held our own."
The Cardinal will host the No. 7 Bears Saturday
at 7 p.m for the second time this season.
Stanford's first encounter with Cal, at Berkeley's
Haas Pavilion, was too close for comfort — Stan
ford won by one-tenth of a point. At home, the Car
dinal hosted the Stanford Open, and once again
knocked off Cal, 208.625-206.425.
"Our team knows we can win," senior Nate
Downs said. "'We're focused not so much on beating
Cal, but performing our best. We need to use this
meet as a stepping stone on the road to NCAAs."
Stanford has yet to put its best team on the floor,
as injuries benched key performers at the beginning
of the season.
Schorsch and Nakamori are slowly coming back
from injuries that have kept them out of competi
tion. Schorsch suffered a chronic elbow injury and
Nakamori is returning from a broken hand. This
weekend against Cal, Nakamori is scheduled to
compete in three events with the possibility of a
fourth, and is working his way back to competing as
an all-around.
The injuries have taken a toll on the team's con
sistency.
"A team that is always consistent — one that
everyone knows is going to hit every routine — is
the most feared team out there," Sender said. "We
need to be that team."
Stanford's primary goal for Saturday's meet
against Cal is to have four hit routines on every
event. While the rings team — which has five ath
letes starting with 10.0 routines — gives the Cardi
nal a good chance for high point totals, Stanford is
hoping to stay comfortable and confident on other
events, particularly on the pommel horse — which
has been a problem of late.
"[The pommel horse team] has yet to put up
those scores and those routines that are going to
score well," head coach Thorn Glielmi said. "In
practice they look great, they just have to keep their
nerves under control and do what they're capable
of doing."
