## Teams of two compete in Florida regatta 
### NATALIE CHLADEK 
The Stanford sailing team braved
tough conditions this past weekend
in the 2x2 World Qualifier in Tampa,
Fla., with the top Cardinal team plac
ing seventh.
Team Yalebos was the winning
team and earned a berth in the 2x2
World Sailing Games in Austria this
May.
"['lTie regatta wasj a great oppor
tunity to try out the new team racing
format against some of the country's
top 3x3ers." junior Brian Haines said.
The teams of Haines and fresh
man Kelly McKenna, and sopho
more Edward Conrad and senior
Anna Vu were the top finishers for
the Cardinal. The teams of freshman
Emery Wager and freshman Taylor
Grimes, and assistant coach John
Fearce and junior Becca Levin were
the other participants for Stanford.

Stanford finished 5-5 on the
weekend — good enough to place in
the middle of the 24-team pack. The
event was not exclusively for colle
giate competitors; the fleet was com
prised of teams from across the coun
try, including former Olympians and
Team Race World Champions.
Saturday's races were marked by
extreme winds, creating what are
called "survival conditions." Teams
were not able to participate in as
many races as planned, which may
have hurt the Cardinal's chances.
Each team competed in 10 races over
the two days.
Conrad called the event "an im
portant opener" for the spring sea
son, despite the bad weather and stiff
competition.
Next up for Stanford are the
Charleston Women's Regatta in
Charleston.S.C.and the North 1&2 Re
gatta in Vallejo, Calif, next weekend.
