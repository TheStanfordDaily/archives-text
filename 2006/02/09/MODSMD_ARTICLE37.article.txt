## Card expect close meet with Bears 
### ALEXIS ANN PETERSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With only two weeks left until
Pac-lOs, the No. 4 Stanford women's
swimming and diving teams need to
be sure they make the most out of
their remaining meets.This Saturday,
as the team takes on California, there
should be no shortage of competitive
fire.
"It's going to be a war," head
swimming coach Lea Maurersaid.
The No. 3 Golden Bears (10-0,6-
0 Pac-10) have fallen to Stanford
(13-1, 4-1) in 29 of their last 32
meets. In 2004, the Bears eked out a
two-point victory, 151-149. Last sea
son, the Cardinal responded by win
ning with a commanding 44-point
margin and sent Cal home disap
pointed, 172-128.
"This is our most exciting dual
meet," sophomore swimmer Brooke
Bishop said. "We have more fans, the
band is coming — this is the dual
meet that everyone mentally pre
pares for the most."
As the Stanford team looks for
ward to the upcoming championship
season, close meets like this are per
haps the best kind of preparation.
"Cal is obviously a formidable op
ponent," Maurer said. "They are real
ly fast and really deep, and on paper,
they probably win."
Bishop stresses the importance of
every race.
"Everyone will probably swim
their best races and every point will
matter," Bishop said. "We race be
cause it's not going to turn out exact
ly how it looks on paper — our goal
is to win, but we want everyone to
step up. and beat whoever is (racing)
next to them."
Head coach Lea Maurer agrees
with Bishop.
"A lot of it is going to come down
to tenths and hundredths of a sec

ond," Maurer said. "We need to split
up some of their depth."
Although the two teams have not
yet raced each other this season, last
weekend both squads raced UCLA.
Stanford lost to the No. 7 Bruins (7-2,
3-2), 120-180. while Cal edged UCLA
one day later, 154.5-145.5.
"We kind of have an idea where
[Cal] will be, and what we need to
do," Bishop said.
The divers will benefit from an ad
ditional competition against
Brigham Young on Friday to warm
them up for the challenge presented
by the Bears.
"Competition like this is good be
cause it gives us more experience
competing, so that if something goes
wrong — which it usually does — we
will be able to bounce back and not
have it affect us," junior diver Cassidy
Krug said.
It is a challenge the Cardinal feels
ready for. As Pac-lOs near, the ath
letes are easing slightly off their
training in order to be in peak racing
condition when it matters most.
"This meet is also a way for us to
evaluate where we are physically.and
then we have a week-and-a-half to
adjust our training to really prepare
for Pac-lOs," Maurer said.
And since it is the conclusion to
the Cardinal's dual-meet season, the
Cal-Stanford match will be especial
ly heated.
"College is all about these kinds
of rivalries," said Maurer, who points
out that rival teams meet throughout
the Pac-10 this weekend. "It's all
about feeling an emotional response
— it's the challenge of a little more
pressure."
The fire the rivalry creates is espe
cially appreciated by the athletes.
"It feels really good when so many
fans come, and you feel like people
are watching you and appreciating
what you are doing," Krug said.
