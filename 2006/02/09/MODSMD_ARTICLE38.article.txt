# SPECIAL EVENT
## Alum eyes future of museums Uses National Museum of the American Indian as model 
### PATRICK LEAHY 
Richard West, director of the National Mu
seum of the American Indian (NMAI) at the
Smithsonian Institution,delivered the sixth an
nual Wilsey Distinguished Lecture last night at
Annenberg Auditorium. In his speech, "Na
tional Museum of the American Indian: Jour
neys in a Post-Colonial Worldhe presented
the NMAI as a paradigm for a more dynamic,
culturally inclusive type of museum than those
previously existing.
West is a member of the Cheyenne tribe, an
alumnus of the Law School Class of 1971, and
served as a legal practitioner in Washington,
D.C. before being appointed as the founding
director of NMAI in 1990.
He said, however, that his move from the
law to museology was not as abrupt as it would
seem.
"My father was a painter and a sculptor," he
said. "Museums were his venue, so as a child I
was there lots."
West's current efforts to sustain the cultural
vitality of Indian peoples are, in some ways, an
outgrowth of his earlier legal career, during
which he often represented Native American
tribes.
It is not surprising that West — as someone
who worked extensively in Washington and is
intimately familiar with tribal life — was cho
sen to steward the development of the first na
tional museum devoted exclusively to Native
Americans.
He described the institution's 15-year de
velopment as "a journey of love and blessed
ness," adding with a chuckle that, "it really
beats practicing law."
The annual lecture was sponsored by Mike
and Bobbi Wilsey, a Stanford alumna who es
tablished the Wilsey Fund for Education to
support the educational objectives of the Can
tor Center for Visual Arts.
Patience Young, the curator for education at
Cantor, said that West was chosen to deliver
this year's lecture because of his unique ability

to offer a "fresh perspective on the role of mu
seums in our society and their responsible ad
ministration."
According to West, NMAI serves multiple
purposes. He believes that the museum's func
tion as a collection of artifacts is secondary to
its function as a cultural center. He added that
institutions of this kind have a responsibility to
promote dialogue, not simply to present
knowledge of the past.
"It comes down to one word: voice," he said.
"We have an ethical and intellectual commit
ment to the fundamental and simple proposi
tion that Native people possess important
knowledge about themselves and their culture
and deserve to be present at the museological
table."
The museum works closely with Native
American communities; a current exhibition of
Pacific Northwestern art proceeded only after
lengthy consultation with 11 different tribes
from Washington state and British Columbia.

NMAI also takes care to see that the
800,000 artifacts in its collections are easily
accessible to Indian tribes and is committed
to repatriating those that were illegally ac
quired.
West believes that NMAI's existence is
rewriting the definition of museum to include
new possibilities for civic discourse. He sees
NMAI as a significant step on the path toward
decolonization, in that it provides a cultural
and spiritual venue for the indigenous peoples
of the Americas.
Sizing up its contribution to the American
cultural landscape. West said, "It is this poten
tial for far greater social engagement that is its
real offering to museum models of the 21 st cen
tury."
Members of an art history seminar entitled
"Art Museums: History and Practices," taught
by Art History Prof. Wanda Corn, were among
those attending the talk.
Corn described West's visit as a perfect op

portunity for her class, which spent five days
prior to this quarter traveling to museums in
New York and Washington, including NMAI.
"We got a very fine articulation of things we
had experienced at the museum," she said. "It
was very helpful to hear him explain the way
Native Americans participated in the process,
since this was not evident at the museum itself."
West met with members of the class before
his speech to answer their questions and ex
plain some of the logistical aspects of NMAl's
administration.
Following the lecture, students said that
they enjoyed the speech.
"(It was nice] to hear him explain a museum
that we studied and visited previously," said
sophomore Emma Sachs. "This museum deals
with such innovative theory that it really fits
nicely with what we are doing."
The lecture also comes as Cantor prepares
for the reinstallation of its Art of the Americas
galleries next year.
