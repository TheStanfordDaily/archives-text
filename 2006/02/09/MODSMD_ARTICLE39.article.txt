## Proposed changes to GRE delayed 
### 
Potentially throwing a wrench
in the plans of seniors and aspiring
graduate students, the Education
al Testing Service (ETS) an
nounced yesterday that it will
delay the launch of the overhauled
Graduate Record Exam (GRE)
until fall 2007.
As reported in a Feb. 3 article
in The Daily, "New GRE set for
October," ETS had planned to
debut the revised GRE — the
standardized assessment for most
prospective graduate students —
in October. ETS has not disclosed
any explanation for the delay.
Students had expressed skep
ticism about the proposed
changes, which include increased
length, an emphasis on cognitive
skills rather than vocabulary and
quantitative questions with more
real-life scenarios.

The Princeton Review, a popu
lar source of standardized test
aid, particularly criticized both
the current exam and the pro
posed changes.
"We suspect that the new test,
with all its esoteric question for
mats and longer testing time, will
continue to create massive discon
nects between many students'
performance on the test and their
ability to succeed in graduate
school," the Princeton Review
stated in a press release. "The new
test will contain questions types
that have never been tested on
any standardized exam, will be 90
minutes longer, have a new grad
ing scale and be less convenient
and more expensive for students
to take."
