# SPORTS ANALYSIS
## Free throws, a season defined 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
It's already been 11 days, but Stanford basketball fans
remember "The Foul" as if it were five minutes ago.
Down three with 0.2 seconds to go against Washington,
Chris Hernandez drew the unlikeliest — and timeliest —
of fouls, and stepped to the free-throw line to shoot for
the tie.
But the three shots that followed didn't just save the
game. No, they served as a microcosm of Hernandez'
shaky season — and a sign of good things to come.
Hernandez toed the line and confidently drained his
first two free throws, much like the fifth-year senior dom
inated the past two years of his collegiate career.
After redshirting his true freshman year and coming
off the bench his redshirt freshman year, Hernandez sim
ply caught fire his sophomore season, earning First Team
All-Conference recognition and averaging 10 points per
game — all while competing for playing time with the
likes of future NBA first-rounder Josh Childress on a
team that started 26-0.
Even early on, Hernandez's poise made him stand out.
Sure, he scored 20 points (on just six field goal
attempts,no less) in the magical last-second win
against Arizona. But what people remember is
the image of the cool, collected sophomore
wisely trying to get the refs attention and call
timeout while Nick Robinson ran down the
court for his miracle, off-balance three.
Junior year was more of the same, as Hernan
dez led the team in minutes played (34.8) and
points (15.2) per game,and rallied the squad out
of an early-season hole and into an improbable
NCAA Tournament berth — all en route to
honors as Stanford's MVP and, yet again. First
Team All-Pac-10.
After the two swishes last Sunday though.
Washington coach Lorenzo Romar quickly
called timeout.
Hernandez would have to wait for his final
shot.
When it finally came, his release was ever so
slightly off. It hit the back and front rims, and just
sat there.

For Hernandez, senior year started in a
slump. He shot under 37% in the 2(M)5 portion of
the season, and slid down to just 11 points per
game. Perhaps it was his injured lower back, per
haps it was the team losing to UC-lrvine, UC-
Davis and Montana, perhaps it was loneliness
after the Fifth-year senior watched all his class
mates graduate last June. Whatever the reason,
the problem was simple.That Fire no longer visi
bly burned in his eyes — Chris just wasn't Chris.
"I think a lot of it is when you're a shooter,
you're going to go through some slumps," said
Hernandez, adding that the worst came around
the time of the Dec. 17,2(X)5 Virginia Tech game.
"All that losing in there, it was pretty bad."
But, just like that fateful free throw finally
split twine after rattling 'round the rim, so too
did Hernandez's season start to turn for the bet
ter.
"Hitting that low, it was like,'l can't get any
worse than what I'm shooting right now,'" Her
nandez said.'T think that peace of mind has led

me to not even worry about it."
And sure enough. 2(XXS has seen Hernandez
become unstoppable, once again. His 57%
three-point shooting and 53% overall shooting
is astronomical.
All told, Hernandez has increased his aver
age to 16 points per game — and often the most
clutch 16 points of the game — without looking
to take any more shots.
"I don't take that many shots." said Hernan
dez when asked if he's become more assertive.
"Generally. 1 try to feel out the game and try to
adjust that way. I don't go in thinking this my
time of year to be more aggressive."
For coach Trent Johnson, the explanation is
far simpler than aggression or mindset.
" The ball's going down for him now," John
son said. "As good as Chris has been, is he not
entitled to have a few bad games? Yeah. Mitch's
helped, Matt's play has helped, [as has] Taj's
overall development, [but] for him personally,
he is getting the same shots. J.J. Redick's a great

player, a great shooter, and he ain't making
them all."
Now, off three game-saving performances,
Hernandez has never been hotter.
Even Johnson, not a man overflowing with
hyperbole, is visibly moved. He compared Her
nandez's late-game heroics to those of former
Stanford greats Chris Williams and Arthur Lee.
He mentioned how grateful he was to be dia
gramming plays for a player like Hernandez,
who could make nearly any play call work, and
then paid his senior captain perhaps the ulti
mate compliment.
"What were talking about here is a guy who's
one of the best players," Johnson said. "Every
one knows he's going to get the ball in a late
game situation, and he's still making plays.
Tliat's what the good players do.
"It's just nice to be able to sit over there and
watch."
And on this campus, it would be hard to find
anyone who disagreed.

inated the past two years of his collegiate career.
After redshirting his true freshman year and coming
off the bench his redshirt freshman year, Hernandez sim
ply caught fire his sophomore season, earning First Team
All-Conference recognition and averaging 10 points per
game — all while competing for playing time with the
likes of future NBA first-rounder Josh Childress on a
team that started 26-0.
Even early on, Hernandez's poise made him stand out.
Sure, he scored 20 points (on just six field goal
attempts,no less) in the magical last-second win
against Arizona. But what people remember is
the image of the cool, collected sophomore
wisely trying to get the refs attention and call
timeout while Nick Robinson ran down the
court for his miracle, off-balance three.
Junior year was more of the same, as Hernan
dez led the team in minutes played (34.8) and
points (15.2) per game,and rallied the squad out
of an early-season hole and into an improbable
NCAA Tournament berth — all en route to
honors as Stanford's MVP and, yet again. First
Team All-Pac-10.
After the two swishes last Sunday though.
Washington coach Lorenzo Romar quickly
called timeout.
Hernandez would have to wait for his final
shot.
When it finally came, his release was ever so
slightly off. It hit the back and front rims, and just
sat there.

For Hernandez, senior year started in a
slump. He shot under 37% in the 2(M)5 portion of
the season, and slid down to just 11 points per
game. Perhaps it was his injured lower back, per
haps it was the team losing to UC-lrvine, UC-
Davis and Montana, perhaps it was loneliness
after the Fifth-year senior watched all his class
mates graduate last June. Whatever the reason,
the problem was simple.That Fire no longer visi
bly burned in his eyes — Chris just wasn't Chris.
"I think a lot of it is when you're a shooter,
you're going to go through some slumps," said
Hernandez, adding that the worst came around
the time of the Dec. 17,2(X)5 Virginia Tech game.
"All that losing in there, it was pretty bad."
But, just like that fateful free throw finally
split twine after rattling 'round the rim, so too
did Hernandez's season start to turn for the bet
ter.
"Hitting that low, it was like,'l can't get any
worse than what I'm shooting right now,'" Her
nandez said.'T think that peace of mind has led

me to not even worry about it."
And sure enough. 2(XXS has seen Hernandez
become unstoppable, once again. His 57%
three-point shooting and 53% overall shooting
is astronomical.
All told, Hernandez has increased his aver
age to 16 points per game — and often the most
clutch 16 points of the game — without looking
to take any more shots.
"I don't take that many shots." said Hernan
dez when asked if he's become more assertive.
"Generally. 1 try to feel out the game and try to
adjust that way. I don't go in thinking this my
time of year to be more aggressive."
For coach Trent Johnson, the explanation is
far simpler than aggression or mindset.
" The ball's going down for him now," John
son said. "As good as Chris has been, is he not
entitled to have a few bad games? Yeah. Mitch's
helped, Matt's play has helped, [as has] Taj's
overall development, [but] for him personally,
he is getting the same shots. J.J. Redick's a great

player, a great shooter, and he ain't making
them all."
Now, off three game-saving performances,
Hernandez has never been hotter.
Even Johnson, not a man overflowing with
hyperbole, is visibly moved. He compared Her
nandez's late-game heroics to those of former
Stanford greats Chris Williams and Arthur Lee.
He mentioned how grateful he was to be dia
gramming plays for a player like Hernandez,
who could make nearly any play call work, and
then paid his senior captain perhaps the ulti
mate compliment.
"What were talking about here is a guy who's
one of the best players," Johnson said. "Every
one knows he's going to get the ball in a late
game situation, and he's still making plays.
Tliat's what the good players do.
"It's just nice to be able to sit over there and
watch."
And on this campus, it would be hard to find
anyone who disagreed.
