## Free throws, a season defined 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
It's already been 11 days, but Stanford basketball fans
remember "The Foul" as if it were five minutes ago.
Down three with 0.2 seconds to go against Washington,
Chris Hernandez drew the unlikeliest — and timeliest —
of fouls, and stepped to the free-throw line to shoot for
the tie.
But the three shots that followed didn't just save the
game. No, they served as a microcosm of Hernandez'
shaky season — and a sign of good things to come.
Hernandez toed the line and confidently drained his
first two free throws, much like the fifth-year senior dom
inated the past two years of his collegiate career.
After redshirting his true freshman year and coming
off the bench his redshirt freshman year, Hernandez sim
ply caught fire his sophomore season, earning First Team
All-Conference recognition and averaging 10 points per
game — all while competing for playing time with the
likes of future NBA first-rounder Josh Childress on a
team that started 26-0.
Even early on, Hernandez's poise made him stand out.
