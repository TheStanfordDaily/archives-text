# NATIONAL SPOTLIGHT
## Faculty and students weigh in on Alito Changes are in store Jot Supreme Court after heated hearings 
### DENISE SOHN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last week, Samuel Anthony
Alito, Jr. was confirmed to serve as
the 110 th Supreme Court Justice of
the United States — the culmination
of a lengthy process that began with
Alito's nomination by President
George W. Bush in October.
For some students and faculty, the
nomination and confirmation had
implications beyond an interest in
national politics. A year ago, the
Court exhibited a distinctly Stanford
flair, with four out of the nine justices
holding degrees from one of Stan
ford's undergraduate or law pro
grams.
With the passing of Chief Justice
William Rehnquist and the retire
ment of Justice Sandra Day O'Con
nor — and the subsequent confirma
tion of Alito and new Chief Justice
John Roberts — that number has
shrunk to two. Justices Stephen
Breyer and Anthony Kennedy re
main the Stanford graduates cur
rently serving on the bench.
Though students may joke that

Stanford graduates are superior,
there was "nothing distinctive
about Stanford compared to other
excellent universities," according to
Pamela Karlan, professor of public
interest law and associate dean for
research and academics at the Law
School — shooting down the brag
ging rights of Stanford students
hoping to claim superiority from
the presence of alumni on the
Court.
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg
agreed. When asked how Stanford
had prepared justices for success in
their future careers, he responded
that while Stanford "gave them a
good legal education," it was difficult
to differentiate Stanford from other
top law schools, such as Yale or Har
vard.
All jokes aside, Karlan pointed
out that Alito's appointment would
certainly have important conse
quences for the nation.
"He's replacing a pivotal role on
the former court. I don't know how
many cases will be overturned, but
obviously the way that future deci
sions will be made will change drasti
cally," Karlan said.
Weisberg said he agreed that
Alito would play an important role
on the Court in the future.
"No one justice is more important
than any other, but [Alito] is replac
ing the swing voter on many contro

versial issues — so it's a very impor
tant appointment in regard to the
status quo," he said.
O'Connor cast swing votes on
several significant cases, including
rulings involving abortion and the
use of race in university admissions
policies.
Nevertheless, Weisberg said he
did not think Alito's appointment
would greatly alter U.S. politics one
way or another.
"The Democrats pretty much
conceded this appointment to
Bush," he said. "A more controver
sial candidate could have sparked a
filibuster or some other strong polit
ical opposition that could affect
[elections in] 2006 or 2008," he said.
Freshman Juliet Rothenberg said
she was not at all surprised by Alito's
confirmation to the court. His confir

mation, despite the lengthy Senate
hearings, was rather predictable, she
said.
Although she forecasted that the
new Supreme Court will overturn
previous decisions on such contro
versial issues as abortion and emi
nent domain. Rothenberg also com
pared Alito's role with O'Connor's.
"I think he will be as important,
but I don't think he will be as influen
tial or as innovative," she said.
According to Weisberg. Alito's
confirmation could also indirectly af
fect American politics "if his vote
helps the government win big execu
tive power concerning national secu
rity."
"[Alito] could help Bush do cer
tain things, but he could also thereby
expose Bush to more political oppo
sition for those things," he said.
