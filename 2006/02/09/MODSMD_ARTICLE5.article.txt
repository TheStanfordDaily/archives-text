## Frosh point fills big shoes 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Despite being injured her entire
senior year of high school, Rosalyn
Gold-Onwude had lofty expectations
for her first season at Stanford. First
on her list: Get on the court, early and
often.
"I just wanted to have the chance
to play, but I'm not easily satisfied."
Gold-Onwude said. "I knew I wanted
to be a big part of the success. I wanted
to play with the starters and play with
Candice rather than sub in for her, and
I knew I had an opportunity since
some talented seniors had graduated."
In fact, the Cardinal were in des
perate need of a point guard. Mead
coach Tara VanDerveer first hinted at
developing "Rozafter a home loss to
Tennessee. The head coach told re
porters that they needed fewer
turnovers and that the team would not
be successful with "high school [quali
ty] point guard play."
Enter Gold-Onwude. The 5-foot

10 freshman from Rego Park. N. Y.,has
shown flashes of the skills that saw her
named New York's best female ath
leteâ€” as a junior.
"1 think she's really improved,"
VanDerveer said. "She's playing with
a lot more confidence and she defi
nitely has some really good players to
pass to."
"I've had a role change." Gold-On
wude added. "My job is really to run
the offense and make sure people are
getting the ball where they're most
productive. I'm not the first option,
I'm not the second or even the third
option for scoring."
The pressure of handling the ball
may daunt some underclassmen, but
Gold-Onwude has responded well so
far. She is currently sixth in the Pac-10
with 3.67 assists per game, and leads
the conference in assist-to-turnover
ratio at 1.93.
And if she needs advice, no matter
how brutal, VanDerveer is never far
