## Frosh point fills big shoes 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Despite being injured her entire
senior year of high school, Rosalyn
Gold-Onwude had lofty expectations
for her first season at Stanford. First
on her list: Get on the court, early and
often.
"I just wanted to have the chance
to play, but I'm not easily satisfied."
Gold-Onwude said. "I knew I wanted
to be a big part of the success. I wanted
to play with the starters and play with
Candice rather than sub in for her, and
I knew I had an opportunity since
some talented seniors had graduated."
In fact, the Cardinal were in des
perate need of a point guard. Mead
coach Tara VanDerveer first hinted at
developing "Rozafter a home loss to
Tennessee. The head coach told re
porters that they needed fewer
turnovers and that the team would not
be successful with "high school [quali
ty] point guard play."
Enter Gold-Onwude. The 5-foot

10 freshman from Rego Park. N. Y.,has
shown flashes of the skills that saw her
named New York's best female ath
leteâ€” as a junior.
"1 think she's really improved,"
VanDerveer said. "She's playing with
a lot more confidence and she defi
nitely has some really good players to
pass to."
"I've had a role change." Gold-On
wude added. "My job is really to run
the offense and make sure people are
getting the ball where they're most
productive. I'm not the first option,
I'm not the second or even the third
option for scoring."
The pressure of handling the ball
may daunt some underclassmen, but
Gold-Onwude has responded well so
far. She is currently sixth in the Pac-10
with 3.67 assists per game, and leads
the conference in assist-to-turnover
ratio at 1.93.
And if she needs advice, no matter
how brutal, VanDerveer is never far
away.
"She's very bluntGold-Onwude said, giggling.
"Tara's a point-guard coach. I had to learn to listen to
her. because in college, things are going to go your
coach's way. I feel like I've made a lot of adjustments
and changes and she's helped me a lot."
Gold-Onwude got her first crash-course in Van-
Derveer honesty two weekends ago in Los Angeles.
The Cardinal had just dropped a game to UCLA and
were down by six against USC It seemed that noth
ing could get going offensively as the opposing de
fenses began playing a triangle and two, in effect nul
lifying junior center Brooke Smith and sophomore
Wiggins offensively.
"She basically said. 'If you can't score, you can't
play.'" Gold-Onwude said. '"The game is about put
ting the ball in the basket.' And that just really hit
home. I sat there a little upset and it hit me. Since
then. I've come out a little more aggressive."
The advice sunk in quickly. In the following game
against Oregon. Gold-Onwude took the guidance to
heart and scored nine points on perfect 3-of-3 shoot
ing from 3-point range.

Now that the Cardinal arc on the season's back
stretch, just weeks away from postseason play, Gol
d will not allow her inexperience to factor in
as an excuse for poor play because she knows that so
much rides on her performance.
"Once you're playing, you've got to know what
you're doing especially as a point guard," Gold On
wude said."lf you're a point guard who doesn't know
what you're doing, then nobody really will. Guards
dictate the game,point guards dictate the guards and
it's a lot of pressure but you've got to be able to han
dle it."
But this type of pressure was why Gold-Onwude
came to the 112 arm in the first place. And she knows
her team will always be there to pick her up with the
bumps along the way.
"I've never been in a program where I'm sur
rounded by so much talent." Gold-Onwude said. "I
feel like the whole team is very supportive and we'll
surprise a lot of people [in the postseason]. We're
growing, and we're growing every day."
And the Cardinal hope that Gold-Onwude con
tinues to do the same.
