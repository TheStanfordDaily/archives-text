HEBRON. West Bank (AP) —In the
most violent Palestinian protest yet against
cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad,
crowds smashed windows and threw stones
Wednesday at the headquarters of interna
tional observers, prompting them to quit this
volatile West Bank city.
The unrest came as the violent Islamic
Jihad declared it would forge ahead with its
attacks against Israel and stay out of any fu
ture government headed by Hamas, winner
of the Jan. 25 Palestinian election. In Cairo,
the Hamas political chief warned Palestinian
leader Mahmoud Abbas not to institute
changes in government without getting its
approval.
The hundreds of rioters in Hebron, most
of them youths, overpowered a Palestinian
police detail at the compound of the Tempo
rary International Presence in Hebron, or
TIPH.The police were stationed at the build
ing after the Danish cartoons began sparking
protests across the Muslim world more than
a week ago.
Protesters threw bottles and stones at
TIPH's office building and tried to set it on
fire. A few forced themselves inside, where
observers waved clubs in an attempt to drive
them off.The protesters had smashed nearly
all of the windows in the mission's three
story office building, and damaged three
TIP! I cars.
11 Danish members ofTIPH left Hebron
more than a week ago. but after the attack
Wednesday, all 60 members of the mission's

foreign staff who were inside the building de
cided to leave for their own safety, mission
spokeswoman Gunhild Forselv said.
Departing mission staff hugged and
kissed Palestinian staffers as they took leave.
"It is a very sad day,and we hope to return
as soon as possible," Forselv said.
TIPH was deployed in 1994 after Baruch
Goldstein, a U.S.-born Israeli settler, massa
cred 29 Palestinians at the city's hotly con
tested holy site, the traditional burial cave
of the biblical Abraham. Isaac and Jacob
and three of their wives. TIPH's mandate
was to observe and report on tensions be
tween Palestinians and a small group of
Jewish settlers in the city, protected by the
Israeli military.

On Wednesday, a leader of the Islamic
Jihad. Khaled Batch, rejected the idea of a
long-term truce with Israel and said attacks
would continue. ITie group has been re
sponsible for all six suicide bombings since
Palestinian factions agreed to a cease-fire a
year ago.
Since the weekend. 12 Palestinians have
been killed by Israeli fire — most in re
sponse to stepped up Palestinian rocket at
tacks from Gaza. On Wednesday soldiers
shot and killed an armed Palestinian as he
approached a Gaza-Israel border crossing. A
second Palestinian died of his wounds
Wednesday evening, hospital officials said.
Both were members of the violent Al Aqsa
Martyrs' Brigades.
