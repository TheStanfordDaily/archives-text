## Kelly Clarkson, U2 also take home Grammies

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Mariah Carey
ended her 16-year Grammy drought, but
rock gods U2 smashed her comeback queen
dreams by snatching five trophies Wednes
day, including song and album of the year.
Carey, one of the best-selling artists of all
time, hadn't won a Grammy since her first
two as a fresh-faced ingenue in 1990. This
year, she was nominated for a leading eight
and won three in the pre-telecast ceremony.
No woman had ever won more than five in
one night.
But Carey was shut out through the en
tire televised portion, losing twice to U2,
once to Green Day for record of the year
and once to former American Idol Kelly
Clarkson for best female pop vocal perform
ance.
"If you think this is going to go to our
head, it's too late " U2 frontman Bono said
after the group won song of the year.
After winning the night's big award,
album of the year. Bono told Carey, "You
sing like an angel."
John Legend won three awards: best new
artist, best R&B album for his debut, "Get
Lifted." and best male R&B vocal for the
piano ballad "Ordinary People." His men
tor. Kanye West, also won three.
Clarkson won two, including best pop
album.
"I'm sorry I'm crying again on national
television," said Clarkson, tearful and shak
ing as she held her first Grammy. "Thank
you so much, you have no idea what this
means to me."
The highlight of the show was the appear
ance of Sly Stone, the mercurial, psychedelic
pioneer who disappeared from the music
scene decades ago and hadn't performed in
public since 1993.
Toward the end of a sizzling all-star trib
ute, Stone emerged sporting a pale Mohawk
against his 61-year-old brown scalp and
made his way through one of his biggest

smashes, "I Want To Take You Higher."
Though the tribute was planned, many did
n't expect Stone — who hasn't performed in
public in years — to show up.
Keith Urban was answering questions
backstage when Stone's performance began
playing on a nearby monitor, and he had to
stop talking.
"I think we just got upstaged," Urban said
in amazement."Everything pales in compar
ison."
Aside from winning the most awards, U2
provided one of the more rousing perform
ances in the jam-packed show as they sung
their hit Vertigo, then collaborated with
R&B queen Mary J. Blige's gospel-inflected
fervor for their classic "One."
West's three Grammys matched his total
for last year. The brash rapper/producer
played up (or lived up to) his egotistical rep
utation as he won best rap album for "Late
Registration.
"I had no idea, 1 had no idea," West said
in mock shock as he pulled a huge sheet of
paper that read "Thank You List."
Alison Krauss & Union Station also had
three awards, including for best country
album, while Stevie Wonder, who released
his first album in ten years last year, had two.
The show started off on a two-dimension
al note as the cartoon-fronted rock group
Gorillaz performed their record of the year
contender,"Feel Good Inc." with the help of
animation, a blue screen and guest rappers
De La Soul. The performance then segued
into a Madonna moment, as the pop queen
— who was not nominated for any awards —
shimmied through the Gorillaz' virtual space
while singing her latest hit,"Hung Up."
A brief, impromptu performance by Keys
and Wonder was the first to energize the
crowd. Wonder pulled out his harmonica
and the two soulfully sang his classic "High
er Ground" as a tribute to the late Coretta
Scott King, who was buried TUesday.
"Let's keep trying to reach that higher
ground," Keys said. "I forever want to reach
that higher ground."
