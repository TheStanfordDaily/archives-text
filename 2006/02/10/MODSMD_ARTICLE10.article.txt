# Wondering how to spend spring break? Students tell all
## 
### NATALIE RIOS 
Every year, more than 1(K),(KM) students flock to the beach
es of Cancun for spring break where beautiful locales and trop
ical weather lure them to the resort where MTV broadcasts the
non-stop party and debauchery' that is Spring Break Live.
Movies and television seem to show all college students party
ing in a similar manner. At Stanford, however, students have
more diverse plans.
Junior Mike Brown will be going home to New Jersey and
doesn't plan on going out much because his "town's not really
a 'party town'," he says. Brown chose to go home this year be
cause he wants to visit friends he didn't have the chance to see
during summer vacation.
He believes going home for break will serve him well be
cause it "is a good time to relax because after that we have
school for three months straight...not many holidays or any
thing."
For both freshman Teresa Molina and junior Zach Brand,
staying with family will be like a vacation, as they will visit their
relatives in Hawaii and China, respectively.
Alternative Spring Break is another popular option for

Stanford students.Those who were accepted into the ASB pro
gram will have the opportunity to travel and perform commu
nity service work with various organizations. Valerie Villarreal,
a junior, will he going on her third trip this year.
"These ASB trips offer a unique opportunity to explore is
sues affecting local underserved communities," she says."I can
party anytime of the year but seldom would I have the chance
to gain an on-the-ground perspective on one of the greatest
challenges facing our nation today."
This year. Villarreal will he working with Common Ground
Collective in St. Bernard's Parish, Louisiana to help with Hur
ricane Katrina relief efforts.
"I thought about doing a traditional spring break, but I
could not pass up the opportunity to do my part to help rebuild
the communities and neighborhoods destroyed there," she
says.
For more traditional vacations, the class of 2(XXS is pulling
out all the stops. Some seniors will be flying to Puerto Vallarta
and staying there for a week while others will be cruising to the
Bahamas. Mexico or South America.
"It's my last chance to have a really fun spring break," says
senior Rachel IJrbina. For the past few years, she has either

gone home or worked for ASB. She will be going on a cruise
that will take her from Long Beach to Encenada. Mexico.
"I'm going with 20 other seniors." she says."It as actually a
relatively inexpensive trip."
Despite the seemingly endless options, not everyone has de
cided what they will do during break. Students who don't have
much money to spend won't be able to take cruises or trips to
South America. Instead, road trips appear to be a much more
viable option.
Road trips to Las Vegas, San Diego and Santa Barbara are
all good ways to escape the Bubble without spending too much
money. Southern California has both great weather and beach
es, but, for the students who will have to remain on campus, the
Bay Area is also a good alternative.
Some of the most popular beaches for windsurfing, swim
ming and hanging out are right in our back yard. Trips to
Capitola, Santa Cruz, Monterey, Sausalito and Carmel are all
great destinations. For the out-of-doors type, camp sites in
Half Moon Bay and Santa Cruz are also plentiful. Up north,
Napa and Sonoma offer wine tasting opportunities, and San
Francisco has shopping, clubbing and beaches- all within
driving distance.
