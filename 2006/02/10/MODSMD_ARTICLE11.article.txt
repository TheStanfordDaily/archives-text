## Editorial Alito for life? That's beside the point 
### 
Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito has
been confirmed. Backed by President
George W. Bush, approved by the Sen
ate, Alito's confirmation is a foregone con
clusion. and the decision has a very long
lifespan.
TTie reaction period is over: whether you
have been celebrating, crying yourself to
sleep, reviewing Canadian immigration or
ignoring the whole spectacle, the time has
come to own up to our civic responsibility
and take stock of what this historic moment
means. After all, the U.S. Supreme Court
takes itself quite seriously: it has influenced
everything from Constitutional Amend
ments 11 through 27 to the outcome of the
2000 presidential election.
Here's how it stands: Bush's conservative
legacy on the Supreme Court has been ce
mented by the Alito confirmation. Every
body's favorite hot-button issues will most
likely take the stand in the next several
years—abortion, affirmative action, the
death penalty, gay marriage and medicinal
marijuana. With a sitting court consisting of
strapping young conservatives and wither
ing liberals, the swing looks like it will fall in
favor of the right for a long time to come.
Whether that means clouds or rainbows
on the horizon for you is simply not the
point. The confirmation may be set in stone
(or headstones, God rest Chief Justice
William Reinquist), but we must still hold
the court accountable for doing what it was
made for —using the Constitution to keep
our lawmakers honest. In a vacuum, the po
sition of Supreme Court justice is apolitical
and agenda-free. In reality, however, the sit
uation is ambiguous and messy.
This is where you come in. We do not di
rectly participate in the appointment of
Supreme Court justices, but we are able to

shape the political climate to a large extent.
Voters still decide on the nature of this cli
mate and can influence the role the Court
plays within it. There is currently a lot of
open, critical discussion on the definition of
this role, and that makes our awareness and
participation all the more important.
For example, during the last presidential
election and through the last two Supreme
Court nominations, there has been a lot of
talk about the mainstream sensitivity of any
given nominee. But to what degree should
the court balance the interests of the main
stream and those of minorities?
Another raging debate concerns the role
of judicial activism. When Supreme Court
justices use their position to take action on
pressing contemporary issues, are they over
stepping their powers or seeking a more
meaningful interaction with the Constitu
tion? How open is the Constitution to inter
pretation anyway? Did its signatories know
a lot of gay guys trying to get married or
teens in need of abortion? They knew a lot of
slaves, and we seem to be agreed that they
bungled that issue.
As citizens in a democracy, we can decide
how much power to accord to the Supreme
Court, at least to some extent. We can give
the Supreme Court some power, but not too
much power, and only the right kind of
power. We need to pay attention to the issues
at stake and participate in active dialogue.
Whether or not you signed up to be an
American citizen, you are responsible, you
are implicated.
The Alito confirmation is final, and he'll
still be around when our generation is ruling
the world. So we have to pay attention and
keep the crucial debates open to keep the
Supreme Court honest. With this in mind,
embark, citizen.
