So we're sure that you all have been
awaiting this, our final column. We
know you've been marking Feb. 10 on
your planners, pre-ordering copies of the
Daily, camping out in front of the presses all
dolled up in Stanford diving apparel, practic
ing your spacey faces. Wow, this must be
what it feels like to be J.K. Rowling!
As we've skimmed through this week's
Dailys, we've noticed that our fellow colum
nists have taken it upon themselves to get in
their last hurrahs and say a farewell to their
faithful readers as this edition comes to an
end. We've decided once again to go against
the grain, break the trend, shatter the mold
— and that's not just because we don't have
any faithful readers.
At this point, I need to be honest here.
Kevin had thumb surgery yesterday morning
and, due to a potent mix ofVicodin and func
tional difficulties, he's pretty much being a
waste of space on my couch right now. As the
sole productive contributing member to the
following shenanigans, I'd like you to keep in
mind that "we" is written purely for posterity.

Anyway, we wanted to think of this as a
new beginning, share our words of wisdom,
inspire future columnists and use all of those
ground-breaking ideas that we have been
saving so we could go out with a bang. But as
it turns out, we're not all that wise, don't care
much for whoever comes after us, and we ran
out of ideas about three weeks ago. So basi
cally this bang is really going to be more of a
tinkle.
Kevin laughs a long, long, long time at the

word "tinkle." I'm finally able to silence his
giggles by affectionately whipping a brick at
the back of his head.
After sitting around for hours on end
without even the flicker of a light bulb in our
heads, it finally dawned on us — we needed
to call in reinforcements. A guest writer, a
pinch columnist of sorts. But where could
we find such a person to fill in for Kevin in
his time of need? On such short notice is it
even possible to track down someone with
his unknowable talents, refreshingly bold
intellect, not to mention his dashing good
looks?
I look over to see that Kevin has dozed off
with his tongue hanging out and a small river
of drool cascading down the front of his
shirt...maybe "dashing" was a little mislead
ing.
As it turns out. our reinforcements didn't
quite live up to our expectations, offering
minimal laxative to our untimely case of
mental constipation.
"What about how football players take
ballet?" said one roommate. "Like... what if
they did pirouettes as their end-zone


Cassidy Krug &
Kevin Mclean
Sports
dance?"
Ummni...
"Birds," said another roommate.
"Birds?"
"Birds. I really think that birds
are becoming like squirrels — slow
er and dumber. I almost rode over
one on my bike today."
Now we recognize that in our
glory days, we could have written a
pretty hot little number about either
of these topics. Not saying anything
useful, mind you, we could have
whipped up a stimulating pate of en
tertaining Squirrelbird nonsense.
Kevin starts rocking hack and
forth singing "Rowling, Rowling,
Rowling. J.K. Rowling Rowling" to
the tune of "Rawhide." I reach for an
other brick. He quickly stops rock
ing.
But those days are behind us now.
Now we write at a more sophisticat
ed level of depth and meaning, mak
ing insightful comments on breaking
news, revealing corruption through
hard-hitting investigative journalism
and editorializing on trends of fun
damental importance to Stanford's

students and student-athletes alike.
For example, did you know that,
according to the NCAA, the Stan
ford Athletic Department is not al
lowed to give its athletes "any pow
der, drink, bar, or formula that con
tains more than 30% protein?" That
means that a...
Wait, what? We've reached 700
words? Sweet! You guys find your
own punchline! Toodles!
