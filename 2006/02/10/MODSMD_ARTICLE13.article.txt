## HPV editorial needs clarification 
### SELENA SIMMONS-DUFFIN MARGOT ISMAN 
Wednesday's editorial on Human papilloma virus
("Spread love, not HPV," Feb. 8) was misguided and in
accurate. While we applaud the Stanford Daily's willing
ness to educate our community about this little known
virus, we were very concerned about the potential rami
fications of publishing misleading information on an
issue as volatile and sensitive as a Sexually Transmitted
Infection (STI). We believe that the Daily intended only
to raise awareness, and we hope they will continue to
consider other similarly important issues in the future.
However, it is also important that the community have
access to accurate and well-researched information. This
article attempts to set the record straight.
HPV, by itself, does not kill anyone. HPV, by itself,
does not kill anyone. According to the Daily, S,(KX) peo
ple die of HPV each year. However, according to the Na
tional Institute of Health (NIH), this is the number of
women who die from cervical cancer in the United
States. Also, there are over 1(X) strains of HPV, 30 of

which are transmitted sexually, and only two of which are
pre-cancerous. It is only those two strains that are re
sponsible for most cases of cervical cancer.
It is estimated that 20 million people are infected with
HPV in the United States today (and an astounding 80%
of women are infected by the time they are 50), but the
rate of cervical cancer is actually very low. This is because
in the United States, many women have regular pap
smears, which can detect HPV and allow for monitoring
and early detection and treatment of cervical cancer if it
develops. Unfortunately, pap smears are much less com
mon in other parts of the world, and cervical cancer is the
third most common cancer and the second leading cause
of cancer-related death for women worldwide. Since the
best predictor of cervical cancer is HPV. the develop
ment of an H PV vaccine is very exciting and its global im
plementation will save lives an estimated 200,000 lives
each year.
The HPV vaccine, developed by Merck Incorporat
ed, has received priority consideration for approval by
