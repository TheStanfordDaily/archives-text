## HPV editorial needs clarification 
### SELENA SIMMONS-DUFFIN MARGOT ISMAN 
Wednesday's editorial on Human papilloma virus
("Spread love, not HPV," Feb. 8) was misguided and in
accurate. While we applaud the Stanford Daily's willing
ness to educate our community about this little known
virus, we were very concerned about the potential rami
fications of publishing misleading information on an
issue as volatile and sensitive as a Sexually Transmitted
Infection (STI). We believe that the Daily intended only
to raise awareness, and we hope they will continue to
consider other similarly important issues in the future.
However, it is also important that the community have
access to accurate and well-researched information. This
article attempts to set the record straight.
HPV, by itself, does not kill anyone. HPV, by itself,
does not kill anyone. According to the Daily, S,(KX) peo
ple die of HPV each year. However, according to the Na
tional Institute of Health (NIH), this is the number of
women who die from cervical cancer in the United
States. Also, there are over 1(X) strains of HPV, 30 of

which are transmitted sexually, and only two of which are
pre-cancerous. It is only those two strains that are re
sponsible for most cases of cervical cancer.
It is estimated that 20 million people are infected with
HPV in the United States today (and an astounding 80%
of women are infected by the time they are 50), but the
rate of cervical cancer is actually very low. This is because
in the United States, many women have regular pap
smears, which can detect HPV and allow for monitoring
and early detection and treatment of cervical cancer if it
develops. Unfortunately, pap smears are much less com
mon in other parts of the world, and cervical cancer is the
third most common cancer and the second leading cause
of cancer-related death for women worldwide. Since the
best predictor of cervical cancer is HPV. the develop
ment of an H PV vaccine is very exciting and its global im
plementation will save lives an estimated 200,000 lives
each year.
The HPV vaccine, developed by Merck Incorporat
ed, has received priority consideration for approval by
the FDA. Adding the HPV vaccine
to the list of those required for atten
dance at public schools would en
sure that a high percentage of the
population receives it, maximizing
its effectiveness. The next step in en
suring this outcome is for the Advi
sory Committee on Immunization
Practices —a subset of the Centers
for Disease Control—to adopt the
vaccine to the list of vaccines that are
mandatory for entrance into high
school.
The most distressing aspect of the
Daily's article on HPV was the state
ment that its victims also suffer from
"ulcerated masses that cause bleed
ing and tear apart the walls of internal
organs." We're honestly not sure
where this idea comes from, but it was
irresponsible to suggest this without
citing a reputable source. Cervical
cancer does cause tumors, but to the
best of our knowledge they rarely
rupture. It is also frightening for the
young women who have been diag
nosed with HPV to read this misin
formation. The vast majority of peo
ple who are diagnosed with HPV will
never develop any symptoms of the
virus, and the American Social
Health Association reports that 3 out

of 4 people from the ages of 15 to 44
have the virus. The Editorial Board
owes them an apology for potentially
frightening and stigmatizing these
members of our community.
Although the Daily's intentions
were honorable in attempting to in
form our community about a lesser
known and very prevalent STI, the
Board failed to accurately represent
the virus itself, its effects, and its po
litical status. HPV certainly requires
more attention by the medical, ac
tivist, and especially media commu
nities. We hope that HPV continues
to be talked about in a constructive,
informative context, but we also
hope that in the future the Daily
takes more care to accurately repre
sent the facts.

Editor's note: Our editorial was in
tended to address possible opposition
to the HPV vaccine being put on the
list of approved vaccines, and not in
tended as a judgment of the FDA re
view process. The editorial also states
that HPV is a cause of cervical can
cel, which in turn causes death, al
though we could have been clearer on
that point.
