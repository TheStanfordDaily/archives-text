# Save the World with MichMill and Math
## 
### 
It's our last column. So we've decided to
forego our usual cynical take on the world
in order to genuinely sing the praises of
someone who has been crucial to our artistic
purpose. We sat down to write a column
about Michael, our editor here at The Daily.
Words escaped us, but in the spirit of experi
mentation, we tried this week to write togeth
er. in the most creatively conjoined process
possible. A word-at-a-time column.The con
cept comes from theatrical improvisation.
The column is composed of words at random,
alternating one at a time between the two
participants. Here is what we got:
Curious to think about the consequences
of our writing styles and happenings. Is this
really happening? Yes. It can be described by
the only person who we both respect. That
person is Michael Miller.
Who can know the extent of any articula
tion in our genre? Theory would lead us to
suggest that perhaps Michael knows some
thing he won't ever tell us. Secrets are divi
sive. Thankfully we are friends. Even though
we try to entertain only ourselves, we end up
amusing anyone with any sense of humor.
We stopped there, before we could do any
more damage to our characters.
In case that's a little too obscure, here's
something a little more concrete.
Michael Miller is the only thing that
stands between you and urban panic after
terrorist attack. That's right, Michael
Miller —physics major, CISAC scholar extra
ordinaire, Daily opinions editor emeritus —is
writing policies that the CIA may one day
use to protect you from terrorists. If Tony
Blair can rip off a grad student's thesis, what's

to stop George Bush from doing the same to
Michael? This physics major is writing his
thesis on contingency plans for mass chaos in
the case that United States foreign policy
should prompt someone to attack our cities
with nuclear weapons. Don't we feel safe.
Most of the people we know are laboring
over theses of dubious immediate import,
such as the relationship between art and
Dante, or isolating proteins in earthworms
whose names we won't even attempt to spell,
much less pronounce. While they fritter
about in meaningless pursuits, Michael
Miller has situated himself firmly in the most
dangerous intellectual territory there is. In
ternational security and cooperation.
Hut come to think of it, aren't we all ventur
ing into subjects rife with imminent doom? It's
why we stopped taking science courses. The last
three weeks of every class offered in the Earth
Systems major is a recounting of the various
ways in which humans have devastated the
earth, devastations that will eventually cause
the end of humanity. Sadly, in avoiding the
earth sciences, we have cheated ourselves out of
viewing all those oh-so-aesthetically pleasing
satellite images of melting ice caps. What we

have gained instead is complete license to revel
around in word play. Words which inevitably
paint a rosy portrait of the ultimate fallibility of
mankind. At least these words are pretty.
On this gorgeous February day, we don't
want anyone to tell us about mankind's end
or global warming. We've taken a kindlier
view toward our fellow man, which is why
we'd like to argue for a radical change in un
dergraduate education here at Stanford. Un
dergraduates are already so susceptible to
mood disorders, seasonal change and stress.
In light of this, it's actually irresponsible to
continually force them to dwell on hopeless
subjects which encourage them to change the
world while simultaneously presenting them
with evidence of the futility of their efforts.
Which is why we're drafting legislation to
abolish all departments that dwell on such
subject matter. There goes social science, and
don't you even begin to think economics isn't
included in that category. It's all these conniv
ing human forces of consumption they base
their arguments on that are driving our de
struction. Goodbye engineering. That half of
Stanford focused entirely on identifying prob
lems and creating temporary mechanical,
electrical, civil and aeroastronautic solutions.
Which leaves us with the only truly posi
tive field of study. Math. Math, the bastion of
academic purity that embodies the joie de
vivre we so admire. Mathematics, we applaud
you, even though at the theoretical level
practiced in the halls of Building 380, you are
mostly irrelevant. Sadly, math is too hard for
girls. So long, Stanford's female population.

Which brings us back to the two
of us: female, seemingly cynical hu
manists. On a beautiful spring day in
the middle of winter, we think to
ourselves, if this is what global
warming is all about, well, sign us up.
But for God's sake, don't try to
teach us about it.

We won't bother asking you to e-mail
us. But you should rescue Michael
from his dark thoughts, e-mail him at
michmill@stanford.edu.
