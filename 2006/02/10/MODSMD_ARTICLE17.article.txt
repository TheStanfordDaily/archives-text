Jyllands-Posten affair holds
lessons for campus dialogue
I agreed with the Daily's editorial
yesterday ("True dialogue must he
reasoned and respectful," Feb. 9), hut
was disappointed that the editorial
hoard didn't mention the close con
nection between the Danish cartoon
controversy and the Stanford Indian
mascot controversy
There are some parallels be
tween the two disputes. In the Dan
ish case, the offended are calling for
legal punishments against those who
published and drew the cartoons,cit
ing their offensive nature. This ac
tion seems rather similar to that of
the American Indian groups offend
ed hy the Stanford Indian T-shirts.
At Stanford, however, the authori
ties have acquiesced and those who
print the Stanford Indian in the fu
ture will be punished for violations
of the Fundamental Standard. This

strikes me as a restriction of free
speech that the Daily editorial
board argues against in the Danish
case.
1 am not arguing that the use of
the Stanford Indian mascot is com
pletely justified, although I do think
it is protected by free speech. Rather,
invoking the Fundamental Standard
to legislate morality and free expres
sion is the wrong approach. Jailing
the Danish cartoonists will not ad
dress the issues concerning the por
trayal of ethnic or religious groups
and free speech, just as punishing
fraternity brothers or sailing team
members will not solve the underly
ing problems.
If the administration can deter
mine expression to be a punishable
violation, perhaps we should refer to
the tool as the Fundamental
Weapon.

Going out before Friday
To answer Navin Sivanandam's
question ("'lTie weekend's fluffer,"
Feb. 8) of how often I abort going out
on weeknights to pursue esoteric
knowledge and accept that partying
is for the weekend: Never. Not once
in three years here. Maybe it's be
cause I'm a sociology major, maybe
it's because I didn't come here to
study, and maybe it's because these
are the same thing, but Stanford's
lively midweek evenings are what
makes those long afternoons in
Green reasonable.
From what I've been told, we
should be taking advantage of the
resources we have available during
our equally fleeting youth and time
left at Stanford. Sivanandam is right:
Routine is the worst thing about
being an adult.Then, when being vis
ibly hungover on Thursday morning
can get you fired, cramming your so
cial life into two days a week is as in
evitable as being screwed by hous
ing. But now, when showing up di

sheveled at lecture can be its own
joy, we deserve to go out on Thurs
days. In fact, it's those who have no
pre-Friday outlet that make parties
at Bob so sweaty, and subsequently
inspire Daily Opinions writers to
gripe about Stanford's claustropho
bic social scene.
If your life seems stressed, per
haps what you need is balance. Work
hard, play hard right? That's what
sold me on this school. So I invite
you. Mr. Sivanandam and all of his
ilk, to come out to EBF Happy
Hour, have a toast with me, we'll for
get about our 9-5 lives, and you'll be
home by 1:30 knowing you made the
best of your night.
