Jyllands-Posten affair holds
lessons for campus dialogue
I agreed with the Daily's editorial
yesterday ("True dialogue must he
reasoned and respectful," Feb. 9), hut
was disappointed that the editorial
hoard didn't mention the close con
nection between the Danish cartoon
controversy and the Stanford Indian
mascot controversy
There are some parallels be
tween the two disputes. In the Dan
ish case, the offended are calling for
legal punishments against those who
published and drew the cartoons,cit
ing their offensive nature. This ac
tion seems rather similar to that of
the American Indian groups offend
ed hy the Stanford Indian T-shirts.
At Stanford, however, the authori
ties have acquiesced and those who
print the Stanford Indian in the fu
ture will be punished for violations
of the Fundamental Standard. This

strikes me as a restriction of free
speech that the Daily editorial
board argues against in the Danish
case.
1 am not arguing that the use of
the Stanford Indian mascot is com
pletely justified, although I do think
it is protected by free speech. Rather,
invoking the Fundamental Standard
to legislate morality and free expres
sion is the wrong approach. Jailing
the Danish cartoonists will not ad
dress the issues concerning the por
trayal of ethnic or religious groups
and free speech, just as punishing
fraternity brothers or sailing team
members will not solve the underly
ing problems.
If the administration can deter
mine expression to be a punishable
violation, perhaps we should refer to
the tool as the Fundamental
Weapon.

Going out before Friday
To answer Navin Sivanandam's
question ("'lTie weekend's fluffer,"
Feb. 8) of how often I abort going out
on weeknights to pursue esoteric
knowledge and accept that partying
is for the weekend: Never. Not once
in three years here. Maybe it's be
cause I'm a sociology major, maybe
it's because I didn't come here to
study, and maybe it's because these
are the same thing, but Stanford's
lively midweek evenings are what
