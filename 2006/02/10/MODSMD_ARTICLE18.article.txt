## BENCH BALLS BIG Ezzie is knocking right at the door. I just loved her energy and how she finished. TARA VANDERVEER, head coach on junior guard Eziamaka Okafor 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES STAFF WRITER 
Despite a slow start, the No. 14
women's basketball team was able to
glide over UCSB tonight,Bl-47. In what
has been a goal for Stanford (17-5,11-2
Pac-10) for weeks now, contributions
came from all around, especially fresh
man forward Jillian Harmon and junior
forward Eziamaka Okafor, who led the
Cardinal with 17 and 14 points respec
tively.
"It just seems like we were missing a
lot of easy shots in the first half and
maybe not getting our focus," coach
Tara VanDerveer said. "But I was really
excited about how Ezzie played. I think
she gave us a great start, came in,
scored, worked hard on defense, re
bounded and really gave us great ener
gy"
VanDerveer also noted Harmon's
strong off-the-bench performance in
the first half. Harmon led the Cardinal
with 11 points and six rebounds in the
period, on her way to her second career

double-double.
Overall, though, the Cardinal and
the Gauchos lacked intensity, with nei
ther squad scoring in the first two min
utes. UCSB (11-9,6-2 Big West) finally
got the scoreboard clicking with a layup
from senior guard Karena Bonds. Stan
ford countered with a hook by Smith,
but trailed until 15:18 was left in the
half.
"It just seemed like some people
kind of ho-hummed it a little bit." Van-
Derveer said.
VanDerveer could point to no spe
cific reason for the lack of Cardinal ag
gression early on, which has become a
team trademark for the season. She said
she may need to look closer at her start
ing line-up.
The Cardinal pulled away after tak
ing the lead, however, with a 30-15 run,
and UCSB quickly headed into foul
trouble. By halftime, Stanford led 38-21.
From there, Stanford brought many
of its players off the bench, retiring

Junior guard Eziamaka Okafortied her career-highs in points and rebounds with 14 and eight, respectively, in
the Card's victory over UCSB. Plagued by injury for her first three seasons, Okafor is shooting .346 this year.
sophomore guard Candice Wiggins
and junior center Brooke Smith, who
already had 14 and 10 points respec
tively. The Cardinal surged forward
without them, going on a 25-11 run.
"With the change in the second
half, I really felt like we went with
people who give us great energy,"
VanDerveer said. "I'm just glad we
have that kind of people coming off
the bench."
Among the reserves were sopho
more guard Cissy Pierce (six points)
and junior guard Clare Bodensteiner.
Along with Harmon and Okafor, the
contributions of those substitutes
have led VanDerveer to consider the
expansion of her central six-person
rotation.
"I feel like we play a tight rotation
of six with the starters and Jill, but
Ezzie is knocking right at the door,"
she said. "I just loved her energy and
how she finished."
For the evening, UCSB relied on

sophomore center Kat Suderman,
who had 15 points and nine rebounds.
Suderman said she was trying to
make up for the loss of sophomore
forward Jenna Green, the team's
leading scorer, who fouled out early.
Fouls in general were a problem
for the Gauchos. who saw coach
Mark French receive two technical
fouls for aggressive behavior toward
the referees. After missing the second
half, French apologized to Van-
Derveer and the press for his con
duct.
After the easy home win, the Car
dinal will most likely face a more in
tense battle this Saturday, as they
travel across the bay to rival Califor
nia. Stanford already defeated the
Golden Bears once this season, 87-75
qt Maples. Stanford trailed for much
df the first half of that game against a
rejuvenated Cal team under the lead
ership of four star freshmen.
Tonight's slow play early does not
bode well for the road game.
"[Tonight's slow start] just shows
we need to come out harder," Okafor
said. "We know Cal's going to come
out really hard, so we can't start the
game this way."
