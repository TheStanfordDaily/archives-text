## BENCH BALLS BIG Ezzie is knocking right at the door. I just loved her energy and how she finished. TARA VANDERVEER, head coach on junior guard Eziamaka Okafor 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES STAFF WRITER 
Despite a slow start, the No. 14
women's basketball team was able to
glide over UCSB tonight,Bl-47. In what
has been a goal for Stanford (17-5,11-2
Pac-10) for weeks now, contributions
came from all around, especially fresh
man forward Jillian Harmon and junior
forward Eziamaka Okafor, who led the
Cardinal with 17 and 14 points respec
tively.
"It just seems like we were missing a
lot of easy shots in the first half and
maybe not getting our focus," coach
Tara VanDerveer said. "But I was really
excited about how Ezzie played. I think
she gave us a great start, came in,
scored, worked hard on defense, re
bounded and really gave us great ener
gy"
VanDerveer also noted Harmon's
strong off-the-bench performance in
the first half. Harmon led the Cardinal
with 11 points and six rebounds in the
period, on her way to her second career

double-double.
Overall, though, the Cardinal and
the Gauchos lacked intensity, with nei
ther squad scoring in the first two min
utes. UCSB (11-9,6-2 Big West) finally
got the scoreboard clicking with a layup
from senior guard Karena Bonds. Stan
ford countered with a hook by Smith,
but trailed until 15:18 was left in the
half.
"It just seemed like some people
kind of ho-hummed it a little bit." Van-
Derveer said.
VanDerveer could point to no spe
cific reason for the lack of Cardinal ag
gression early on, which has become a
team trademark for the season. She said
she may need to look closer at her start
ing line-up.
The Cardinal pulled away after tak
ing the lead, however, with a 30-15 run,
and UCSB quickly headed into foul
trouble. By halftime, Stanford led 38-21.
From there, Stanford brought many
of its players off the bench, retiring
