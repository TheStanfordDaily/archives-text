priced talent.
• Someone complaining about the
referees in a big game.
• If you've got enough money, Paris
Hilton.
• Stanford beating Cal.
• Hitting water when you fall out of
a boat.
• Hunting.
What do all of these have in com
mon? They're all sure things. l(X)%
guaranteed. Like betting on a
TiVoed football game.
Wait a minute, though. What is
hunting doing on the list? Isn't there
a probability of failure when one
goes out to kill game?
Yeah, there might have been at
one point. Back when it was about
survival of the fittest, there was a
chance that the animal might get
away. Win, lose, and draw were all
still possibilities.
Now, Darwin's been defeated.
Shot down at the barrel of a high
powered rifle with a super scope.
Hunting has become nothing more
than inevitable killing.
For the life of me, I can't under
stand how a "hunter" would derive
any sort of positive emotion from a
typical hunting trip. You go out to
the woods, dressed in camouflage
(complete with deer piss scent, or
whatever you're hunting), sit in a
blind (which, by the way, makes the
camo completely redundant), and
wait until a deer comes your way,
searching for the food you've so
cleverly placed 15 feet away, square
ly in front of your gun.
Your gun, now that I mention it, is
a severe' overcompensation. You've
a ghs-powered, twin-turbine,
long-barrel automatic killing ma
chine. If you have myopia which pre
vents you from legally driving that
slick ATV (camouflaged of course)
out to the blind, you can attach a su
perscope. Now, you can paint-by
number on the back of a flea if need
be. The only way you miss is if you
fall asleep, which actually might hap
pen, given that you're just sitting on
your ass waiting for the deer to come
to you. It's hard and rewarding
work, for sure.
Once the deer finally shows up,
just click and win. It's like one of
those damn pop-up ads on the inter
net. Congratulations, you're the jack
ass who happened to be sitting in
front of the computer when this
came up. Boy, are you skillful and
good! We want to reward you.
As if the kill weren't easy
enough, you've gone out and gotten
