## The 						thrill of the hunt... or not

• George Steinhrenner buying over
priced talent.
• Someone complaining about the
referees in a big game.
• If you've got enough money, Paris
Hilton.
• Stanford beating Cal.
• Hitting water when you fall out of
a boat.
• Hunting.
What do all of these have in com
mon? They're all sure things. l(X)%
guaranteed. Like betting on a
TiVoed football game.
Wait a minute, though. What is
hunting doing on the list? Isn't there
a probability of failure when one
goes out to kill game?
Yeah, there might have been at
one point. Back when it was about
survival of the fittest, there was a
chance that the animal might get
away. Win, lose, and draw were all
still possibilities.
Now, Darwin's been defeated.
Shot down at the barrel of a high
powered rifle with a super scope.
Hunting has become nothing more
than inevitable killing.
For the life of me, I can't under
stand how a "hunter" would derive
any sort of positive emotion from a
typical hunting trip. You go out to
the woods, dressed in camouflage
(complete with deer piss scent, or
whatever you're hunting), sit in a
blind (which, by the way, makes the
camo completely redundant), and
wait until a deer comes your way,
searching for the food you've so
cleverly placed 15 feet away, square
ly in front of your gun.
Your gun, now that I mention it, is
a severe' overcompensation. You've
a ghs-powered, twin-turbine,
long-barrel automatic killing ma
chine. If you have myopia which pre
vents you from legally driving that
slick ATV (camouflaged of course)
out to the blind, you can attach a su
perscope. Now, you can paint-by
number on the back of a flea if need
be. The only way you miss is if you
fall asleep, which actually might hap
pen, given that you're just sitting on
your ass waiting for the deer to come
to you. It's hard and rewarding
work, for sure.
Once the deer finally shows up,
just click and win. It's like one of
those damn pop-up ads on the inter
net. Congratulations, you're the jack
ass who happened to be sitting in
front of the computer when this
came up. Boy, are you skillful and
good! We want to reward you.
As if the kill weren't easy
enough, you've gone out and gotten
yourself armor-piercing bullets
(geez, do the nuts at the NRA love
this one). What the hell do you
need armor piercing bullets for? Is
there a deer population out there
secretly manufacturing and stock
piling four-legged body armor?
No, you're right though. As
hunters, you'll have a better chance
of killing the animal if you blow a
hole in it big enough to pass a baby
through.
Once it's dead, of course, you
utilize every part of your complete
ly necessary kill. Except for every
thing below the neck (those parts
were useless to begin with, right?).
You take that head, stuff it, and
mount it on your wall. For years,
anyone who visits your killing wall
is regaled with the story of the time
you had to sit in the blind for 45
minutes with only a rotary fan to
keep you cool. What a man you
were that day.
Someone please explain the
sporting aspect of this endeavor
to me. Once upon a time, I would
have believed that the thrill of the
hunt actually existed. Now, the
most exciting thing about hunting

is the question of how to pose
over your kill.
Hunting involves thousands of
dollars in technology, all of which is
used to outsmart an animal that, at
best, has a brain capacity equal to
about one-tenth of our own. 1 can
beat a four-year-old on most tasks
too.
Don't get me wrong. There's a
huge power trip that can be
drawn from holding a gun. Firing
a weapon seems to tap into our
primeval souls and announce our
presence with authority to the
rest of the animal kingdom. 1 just
think that statement would be a
little louder if you were actually
visible when the animal heard
you make it.
Take-home message here:
There's no joy in organized killing.
If it's true that the getting is always
better than the having, then this
"sport" has nothing going for it. If
you want a real thrill, put down the
gun and run down your prey and
kill it by hand. Sure, you may end
up gouged or even killed. But hey,
let's look at the final score. Hu
mans: 1 million. Deer: 1. Score one
for Darwin.
