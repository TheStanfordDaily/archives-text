# SCBN TUNED OUT?
## Station tries to regain viewers in the face of financial strife 
### ANDREA FULLER STAFF WRITER 
Funding issues and equipment deficiencies
have critically hindered the success of the Stan
ford Cardinal Broadcasting Network (SCBN).
With students tuning out and programming
lacking. Junior Ly Chheng, station manager,
lamented the current state of the station com
pared to its "golden age" of the 1980s and
19905.
Chheng explained that the current financial
strife experienced by the station ranges from
deficient funding for popular programs to a
nearly obsolete equipment budget.
"The majority of our money has gone to the
movies we show due to copyright issues," he said.
"This is all the ASSU would approve. Our equip
ment budget is next to nothing. We would need
at least $10,000 for equipment alone to bring the
station up to the caliber of other college stations.
This would be used to buy more in-studio equip
ment so that students would be able to produce
shows, like a more professional news program to

help inform students on campus about what's
going on."
Chheng singled out the budget crisis as the
main reason for the station's declining viewer
ship.
"The ASSU has pointed out the lack of stu
dent interest in producing new shows as its rea
son for not giving the station a large equipment
budget,"he said. "This, of course, has led to a vi
cious cycle in which the station does not re
ceive money for the new equipment, prevent
ing students from producing shows and thus
leading us to once again not receive enough
money from the ASSU."
Junior Reena Magsarili, general manager of
the station, agreed that the lack of sufficient
production equipment is the root of the prob
lem.
"It's kind of a catch-22 situation," she said.
"If you have a lot of good equipment, you have
a lot of good shows and the publicity pretty
much follows from that. But in order to get
good equipment, you have to demonstrate that
there is interest in the station. You're kind of
trapped. So for publicity right now, we're trying
to improve the broadcast quality and program
