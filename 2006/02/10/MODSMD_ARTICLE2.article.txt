# SCBN TUNED OUT?
## Station tries to regain viewers in the face of financial strife 
### ANDREA FULLER STAFF WRITER 
Funding issues and equipment deficiencies
have critically hindered the success of the Stan
ford Cardinal Broadcasting Network (SCBN).
With students tuning out and programming
lacking. Junior Ly Chheng, station manager,
lamented the current state of the station com
pared to its "golden age" of the 1980s and
19905.
Chheng explained that the current financial
strife experienced by the station ranges from
deficient funding for popular programs to a
nearly obsolete equipment budget.
"The majority of our money has gone to the
movies we show due to copyright issues," he said.
"This is all the ASSU would approve. Our equip
ment budget is next to nothing. We would need
at least $10,000 for equipment alone to bring the
station up to the caliber of other college stations.
This would be used to buy more in-studio equip
ment so that students would be able to produce
shows, like a more professional news program to

help inform students on campus about what's
going on."
Chheng singled out the budget crisis as the
main reason for the station's declining viewer
ship.
"The ASSU has pointed out the lack of stu
dent interest in producing new shows as its rea
son for not giving the station a large equipment
budget,"he said. "This, of course, has led to a vi
cious cycle in which the station does not re
ceive money for the new equipment, prevent
ing students from producing shows and thus
leading us to once again not receive enough
money from the ASSU."
Junior Reena Magsarili, general manager of
the station, agreed that the lack of sufficient
production equipment is the root of the prob
lem.
"It's kind of a catch-22 situation," she said.
"If you have a lot of good equipment, you have
a lot of good shows and the publicity pretty
much follows from that. But in order to get
good equipment, you have to demonstrate that
there is interest in the station. You're kind of
trapped. So for publicity right now, we're trying
to improve the broadcast quality and program

ming quality. The knowledge about the
station will develop from there."
Students, however, gave a slightly
different reason for the lack of popu
larity — insufficient publicity.
"It's not very popular, in part be
cause there's so little advertising for
it," said junior Gabe Recchia. "The
only reason 1 know they exist is be
cause they gave a presentation once at
Freshman Orientation. I don't have a
clue what their lineup is. If I knew, I
might tune in."
Junior Aaron Johnson also noted
that students often choose popular
programs instead, if they watch televi
sion at all.
"I think people are just really busy
in general, so if they're going to watch
TV, they're going to watch their fa
vorite shows," he said. "A program by
students at Stanford isn't going to be as
entertaining as, say, 24."
Despite financial setbacks, howev
er, SCBN staff remained optimistic
about its recent developments.
"One of the best things SCBN has

been able to do this year is to introduce
an actual programming schedule," said
James Lin, programming manager. "In
the past, you never knew what was
playing when. Now, every piece of pro
gramming is scheduled to a particular
time. And since all of our programming
airs multiple times, there will always be
a convenient time for viewers to catch
what they want to watch."
Lin said that student feedback indi
cated high approval of the program
ming.
"I think people have been really re
ceptive to the changes they've seen with
SCBN over the past month," he said.
"They really like the programming
schedule, and they've been happy with
the variety of programming that has
been airing. We are continuing to work
on different ideas to make the station
better, and we're definitely listening to
the feedback we've been getting from
viewers."
Located on Channel 5 on Stanford
TV, a free channel, the completely stu
dent-run station focuses mostly on
showing popular films, television
shows and music videos. Viewers can
vote on the station's web site for movie
choices and see the programming
schedule.
"This year the station has seen

amazing growth," Chheng said, 'it is
clear to us that the station is growing in
popularity with students, and more stu
dents are getting excited about it.
Everyone at the station has worked
hard to help improve our conditions
and make due with our resources, but
we are all very well aware that there is
still a lot of work left to do if we want to
bring the station up to the caliber of
other colleges."
The station also airs a roster of stu
dent interest shows. It broadcasts ma
terial about student activities including
Taiko, DVB and Stanford athletics. It
also shows student produced films, like
short films by the Stanford Film Soci
ety and documentaries made by cur
rent students and alumni.
One of SCBN's major aims this year
is to increase the amount of student
programming.
"In terms of student-produced
shows, we are very receptive to stu
dents who want to produce their own
shows," Chheng said. "For the most
part, if a show is produced in conjunc
tion with our station, using our equip
ment, we will broadcast the show."
SCBN Executive Producer Alana
Dong, a sophomore, noted that interest
in student-produced programming has
recently peaked.

"This year is very exciting for SCBN
because there is a good slate of new stu
dent shows," she said. "There is a new
show by Shamika Goddard called 'Skin
Deep,' which is a makeover reality
show. Another show that's in post-pro
duction is 'Lagunita Beach,' a mock
teen-reality-drama. There's also been
talk about a sketch comedy show in the
works."
Other projects in development in
clude Stanford Cribs, modeled on the
MTV show and The New Love Links, a
Stanford dating game.
The current student-run programs
include Cardinal Sports Talk, a show
that regularly features athletes on cam
pus. Other student programming in
cludes Stanford Spotlight, which re
lates news about students, events, and
trends on campus. Last spring, the pro
gram won the Alumni Association's
Pierce Memorial Award for a creative
student-initiated project that serves
the campus community. It is Stanford's
first news show in eight years and first
ever entertainment news variety show.
Describing why she started produc
ing, Dong also paid homage to the sta
tion's overarching reason for exis
tence:"! thought there were too many
cool things and amazing people around
campus not to know about them."
