# SOFTBALL SEASON PREVIEW
## Short on players, big on talent 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
Blue skies. Fresh-cut grass. Perfectly raked dirt.
The thwack of a metal hat. And ponytails. Lots of
them. It's February, and that means softball season
on the Farm.
"This is why I came out here," freshman Maddy
Coon said. "The weather, the facilities, the coaches,
the girls. It's so exciting. To come out here in a Stan
ford jersey — it's going to be a thrill."
After four months of fall practice, No. 7/9 Stan
ford is ready to defend its first-ever Pac-1() Cham
pionship, no small feat in the nation's best confer
ence. The Cardinal kick off the 2006 season this
weekend with five games in three days at the Ka
jikawa Classic in Phoenix, Ariz.
The team going to Arizona has a different look
from the squad that made it to last year's NCAA
Super Regional. For one thing, it's smaller.
The Cardinal graduated six seniors last year
while bringing in a freshman class of only two — in
fielder Coon and pitcher Missy Pena.The 20-player
squad last year was larger than normal, but this sea
son's is unusually small.
While the short bench could become a concern
if the injury bug strikes, the team is confident in its
15 players.
"We're not as deep as last year as far as the ros
ter is concerned," head coach John Rittman said.
"But because of our players and their versatility, we

still have quite a few options. We can move people
around and be an effective team defensively. And
we have a lot of strength and speed from top to bot
tom in our hitting lineup."
Senior pitcher Laura Severson is optimistic that
Stanford's size may prove to be an asset.
"We are a little bit smaller than we have been in
the past," she said. "But that can play to our advan
tage. We will be tighter and have everybody on the
same page. And everybody is going to be able to
contribute."
Despite the loss of a strong senior class, many of
the Cardinal's defensive and offensive leaders are
back for another year. Senior shortstop Lauren
Lappin won the inaugural Pac-10 Defensive Player
of the Year award last year and was a finalist for the
National Player of the Year award. I ler 52 runs and
seven stolen bases in 2(X)5 led the team.
The Cardinal also return two of last season's
power hitters in senior centerfielder Catalina Mor
ris and sophomore third baseman Michelle Smith.
Morris led the team in hits, doubles and triples last
year, while Smith set a team record with 19 homers
as a freshman.
Lappin and Morris were named to the presea
son Player of the Year watch list last week, along
with junior leftfielder Jackie Rinehart . While proud
of the honor, Lappin says it is not just about the
three of them.
"We would not be getting this recognition if our
team were not so successful, if we didn't have our

teammates and coaches always pushing us to im
prove." Lappin said. "ITiis is really a testament to
the entire team, because really any of us could come
out and be Player of the Year. The three of us were
just lucky that we were the ones who got picked."
Ilie Cardinal's strength in the field and in the
batter's box is matched in the pitcher's circle. Stan
ford's pitching corps returns all three starters from

last season, and newcomer Pena adds depth and
versatility.
"We have four really solid pitchcrs who can
pitch in any situation," Severson said. "All of us are
very different, so we complement each other well."
Severson and Pena will be joined in the circle by

Kajikawa Classic
The Cardinal will start the
2006 season this week
end against No. 21/22
Nebraska, Utah State,
New Mexico, Nevada
and No. 4/4 Texas. Stan
ford looks to repeat its first
ever Pac-10 Championship,
which it shared with Califor
nia, Arizona and Oregon
State in 2005.

sophomores Lauren Nydam and
Becky McCullough. Nydam had a
team-best 1.62 ERA in 2005, while
McCullough racked up 21 wins on
the season.
The contributions of the pitchers
outside the circle will also be key on
this small roster.Two of them — Mc-
Cullough and Pena — can bat for
themselves or step in as designated
hitters, Rittman said,giving him a va
riety of options on offense.
With the freshmen settled and
practices going well, the Cardinal are
finally ready to put it all together on
the field.
"Coming out here [to practice],
there is a plan every day," Rittman
said. "Executing it in practice is one
thing, but to do it in a game is some
thing else. We're ready to play, ready
to see where we need improvement
and to see what we can accomplish
this weekend."
And this afternoon against No.
21/22 Nebraska, the Cardinal will get
that chance.
"When you haven't played in a
long time, playing five games in a
weekend can be difficult," said
Rittman. "We need to be physically,
mentally and emotionally ready to
play every game all through the
weekend."
Stanford will start against Ne
braska, and then face Utah State,
New Mexico and Nevada before
closing out the tournament against
No. 4/4 Texas. The Longhorns are led
by senior pitcher Cat Osterman, the
two-time Player of the Year.
The Cardinal expect Texas to be
the biggest challenge of the week

end, but they are careful not to dis
miss their first four games.
"You have to look out for every
one," Lappin said."You can't let any
one blindside you."
"If you look too hard at the big
picture, you start to overlook oppo
nents," Severson said. "We want to
just play our kind of ball, play Stan
ford softball and do the best we can."
Although the team would love to
come out of the weekend with five
wins, the focus is on assessment and
improvement.
"We just want to get better in
each game," Lappin said. "That will
be our goal all year — every day,
ever>' practice, we want to get a little
better. We're not always going to be
perfect, but we will just need to learn
from our mistakes and move on and
get better."
This weekend will be the first, but
certainly not the last, challenge for
the Cardinal, who finished in a four
way tie for the Pac-10 title last year
with California, Arizona and Ore
gon State. The Pac-10 is perennially
the most competitive in the nation.
In this season's polls, the Pac-10 has
four teams in the Top 10 nationally,
and six in theTop 15. Arizona State is
currently the only unranked school
in the conference.
"Playing in a conference like
ours, you need to always bring your
A game." Rittman said. "If you don't
bring your A game against UCLA,
Arizona, Arizona State, Oregon, re
ally anybody, you'll get beat."
Pac-10 play starts in late March.
Until then, the mantra is "Take it
game-by-game," starting with Ne
braska.
"I'm just really excited to get out
on the field and start playing," Coon
said. "Playing in my first game at the
college level — it's what I've
dreamed of ever since I was a kid."

jikawa Classic in Phoenix, Ariz.
The team going to Arizona has a different look
from the squad that made it to last year's NCAA
Super Regional. For one thing, it's smaller.
The Cardinal graduated six seniors last year
while bringing in a freshman class of only two — in
fielder Coon and pitcher Missy Pena.The 20-player
squad last year was larger than normal, but this sea
son's is unusually small.
While the short bench could become a concern
if the injury bug strikes, the team is confident in its
15 players.
"We're not as deep as last year as far as the ros
ter is concerned," head coach John Rittman said.
"But because of our players and their versatility, we

still have quite a few options. We can move people
around and be an effective team defensively. And
we have a lot of strength and speed from top to bot
tom in our hitting lineup."
Senior pitcher Laura Severson is optimistic that
Stanford's size may prove to be an asset.
"We are a little bit smaller than we have been in
the past," she said. "But that can play to our advan
tage. We will be tighter and have everybody on the
same page. And everybody is going to be able to
contribute."
Despite the loss of a strong senior class, many of
the Cardinal's defensive and offensive leaders are
back for another year. Senior shortstop Lauren
Lappin won the inaugural Pac-10 Defensive Player
of the Year award last year and was a finalist for the
National Player of the Year award. I ler 52 runs and
seven stolen bases in 2(X)5 led the team.
The Cardinal also return two of last season's
power hitters in senior centerfielder Catalina Mor
ris and sophomore third baseman Michelle Smith.
Morris led the team in hits, doubles and triples last
year, while Smith set a team record with 19 homers
as a freshman.
Lappin and Morris were named to the presea
son Player of the Year watch list last week, along
with junior leftfielder Jackie Rinehart . While proud
of the honor, Lappin says it is not just about the
three of them.
"We would not be getting this recognition if our
team were not so successful, if we didn't have our

teammates and coaches always pushing us to im
prove." Lappin said. "ITiis is really a testament to
the entire team, because really any of us could come
out and be Player of the Year. The three of us were
just lucky that we were the ones who got picked."
Ilie Cardinal's strength in the field and in the
batter's box is matched in the pitcher's circle. Stan
ford's pitching corps returns all three starters from

last season, and newcomer Pena adds depth and
versatility.
"We have four really solid pitchcrs who can
pitch in any situation," Severson said. "All of us are
very different, so we complement each other well."
Severson and Pena will be joined in the circle by

The Cardinal will start the
2006 season this week

Nebraska, Utah State,

and No. 4/4 Texas. Stan
ford looks to repeat its first
ever Pac-10 Championship,
which it shared with Califor
nia, Arizona and Oregon
State in 2005.

sophomores Lauren Nydam and
Becky McCullough. Nydam had a
team-best 1.62 ERA in 2005, while
McCullough racked up 21 wins on
the season.
The contributions of the pitchers
outside the circle will also be key on
this small roster.Two of them — Mc-
Cullough and Pena — can bat for
themselves or step in as designated
hitters, Rittman said,giving him a va
riety of options on offense.
With the freshmen settled and
practices going well, the Cardinal are
finally ready to put it all together on
the field.
"Coming out here [to practice],
there is a plan every day," Rittman
said. "Executing it in practice is one
thing, but to do it in a game is some
thing else. We're ready to play, ready
to see where we need improvement
and to see what we can accomplish
this weekend."
And this afternoon against No.
21/22 Nebraska, the Cardinal will get
that chance.
"When you haven't played in a
long time, playing five games in a
weekend can be difficult," said
Rittman. "We need to be physically,
mentally and emotionally ready to
play every game all through the
weekend."
Stanford will start against Ne
braska, and then face Utah State,
New Mexico and Nevada before
closing out the tournament against
No. 4/4 Texas. The Longhorns are led
by senior pitcher Cat Osterman, the
two-time Player of the Year.
The Cardinal expect Texas to be
the biggest challenge of the week

end, but they are careful not to dis
miss their first four games.
"You have to look out for every
one," Lappin said."You can't let any
one blindside you."
"If you look too hard at the big
picture, you start to overlook oppo
nents," Severson said. "We want to
just play our kind of ball, play Stan
ford softball and do the best we can."
Although the team would love to
come out of the weekend with five
wins, the focus is on assessment and
improvement.
"We just want to get better in
each game," Lappin said. "That will
be our goal all year — every day,
ever>' practice, we want to get a little
better. We're not always going to be
perfect, but we will just need to learn
from our mistakes and move on and
get better."
This weekend will be the first, but
certainly not the last, challenge for
the Cardinal, who finished in a four
way tie for the Pac-10 title last year
with California, Arizona and Ore
gon State. The Pac-10 is perennially
the most competitive in the nation.
In this season's polls, the Pac-10 has
four teams in the Top 10 nationally,
and six in theTop 15. Arizona State is
currently the only unranked school
in the conference.
"Playing in a conference like
ours, you need to always bring your
A game." Rittman said. "If you don't
bring your A game against UCLA,
Arizona, Arizona State, Oregon, re
ally anybody, you'll get beat."
Pac-10 play starts in late March.
Until then, the mantra is "Take it
game-by-game," starting with Ne
braska.
"I'm just really excited to get out
on the field and start playing," Coon
said. "Playing in my first game at the
college level — it's what I've
dreamed of ever since I was a kid."
Blue skies. Fresh-cut grass. Perfectly raked dirt.
The thwack of a metal hat. And ponytails. Lots of
them. It's February, and that means softball season
on the Farm.
"This is why I came out here," freshman Maddy
Coon said. "The weather, the facilities, the coaches,
the girls. It's so exciting. To come out here in a Stan
ford jersey — it's going to be a thrill."
After four months of fall practice, No. 7/9 Stan
ford is ready to defend its first-ever Pac-1() Cham
pionship, no small feat in the nation's best confer
ence. The Cardinal kick off the 2006 season this
