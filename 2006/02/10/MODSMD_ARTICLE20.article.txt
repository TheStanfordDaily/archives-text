# SOFTBALL SEASON PREVIEW
## Short on players, big on talent 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
Blue skies. Fresh-cut grass. Perfectly raked dirt.
The thwack of a metal hat. And ponytails. Lots of
them. It's February, and that means softball season
on the Farm.
"This is why I came out here," freshman Maddy
Coon said. "The weather, the facilities, the coaches,
the girls. It's so exciting. To come out here in a Stan
ford jersey — it's going to be a thrill."
After four months of fall practice, No. 7/9 Stan
ford is ready to defend its first-ever Pac-1() Cham
pionship, no small feat in the nation's best confer
ence. The Cardinal kick off the 2006 season this
weekend with five games in three days at the Ka
jikawa Classic in Phoenix, Ariz.
The team going to Arizona has a different look
from the squad that made it to last year's NCAA
Super Regional. For one thing, it's smaller.
The Cardinal graduated six seniors last year
while bringing in a freshman class of only two — in
fielder Coon and pitcher Missy Pena.The 20-player
squad last year was larger than normal, but this sea
son's is unusually small.
While the short bench could become a concern
if the injury bug strikes, the team is confident in its
15 players.
"We're not as deep as last year as far as the ros
ter is concerned," head coach John Rittman said.
"But because of our players and their versatility, we

still have quite a few options. We can move people
around and be an effective team defensively. And
we have a lot of strength and speed from top to bot
tom in our hitting lineup."
Senior pitcher Laura Severson is optimistic that
Stanford's size may prove to be an asset.
"We are a little bit smaller than we have been in
the past," she said. "But that can play to our advan
tage. We will be tighter and have everybody on the
same page. And everybody is going to be able to
contribute."
Despite the loss of a strong senior class, many of
the Cardinal's defensive and offensive leaders are
back for another year. Senior shortstop Lauren
Lappin won the inaugural Pac-10 Defensive Player
of the Year award last year and was a finalist for the
National Player of the Year award. I ler 52 runs and
seven stolen bases in 2(X)5 led the team.
The Cardinal also return two of last season's
power hitters in senior centerfielder Catalina Mor
ris and sophomore third baseman Michelle Smith.
Morris led the team in hits, doubles and triples last
year, while Smith set a team record with 19 homers
as a freshman.
Lappin and Morris were named to the presea
son Player of the Year watch list last week, along
with junior leftfielder Jackie Rinehart . While proud
of the honor, Lappin says it is not just about the
three of them.
"We would not be getting this recognition if our
team were not so successful, if we didn't have our

teammates and coaches always pushing us to im
prove." Lappin said. "ITiis is really a testament to
the entire team, because really any of us could come
out and be Player of the Year. The three of us were
just lucky that we were the ones who got picked."
Ilie Cardinal's strength in the field and in the
batter's box is matched in the pitcher's circle. Stan
ford's pitching corps returns all three starters from

last season, and newcomer Pena adds depth and
versatility.
"We have four really solid pitchcrs who can
pitch in any situation," Severson said. "All of us are
very different, so we complement each other well."
Severson and Pena will be joined in the circle by

Kajikawa Classic
The Cardinal will start the
2006 season this week
end against No. 21/22
Nebraska, Utah State,
New Mexico, Nevada
and No. 4/4 Texas. Stan
ford looks to repeat its first
ever Pac-10 Championship,
which it shared with Califor
nia, Arizona and Oregon
State in 2005.

Freshman right
hander Missy Pena,
one of two frosh on
the softball team,
might play the first
game of her
collegiate career
this weekend in
Arizona.
