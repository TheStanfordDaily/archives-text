## Happy Birthday, now here's a win Volleyball avenges last week's loss with home win 
### JOE KAY 
Wednesday night's win against
Pacific was a welcome birthday
present for both men's volleyball
coaches. Head coach Don Shaw's
birthday is February 9, and associ
ate head coach John Kosty's is Feb
ruary 8. The best gift, though, is the
hope that there will be more wins
ahead for the Cardinal.
After losing to the Tigers in four
games only five nights before, the
Cardinal posted a solid win (30-23,
30-22, 30-27) to boost their record
to 3-9 overall, 2-6 in the Mountain

started [outside hitter] William
[Clayton]. I had a little talk with the
seniors this week and we just felt
like, 'you guys need to pick up the
pace.'
"I thought all of them did very,
very well tonight. And then you
throw [sophomore middle blocker
Matt] Ceran into the mix, and he
did a good job as well."
The coaches and players agreed
that the game-changing factor was
Stanford's improved passing accu
racy.
Pacific head coach Joe Wortman
said that Stanford played like an
entirely different team, far superior
to the squad that fell to his Tigers
last week.
"It's almost a complete rever
sal," he said. "[Stanford] won the
serve-and-pass battle of this match
hands down. Last Friday we won
the serve-and-pass battle."
"I think that one of the big dif
ferences in this game was that we
