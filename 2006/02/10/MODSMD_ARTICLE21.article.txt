# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Happy Birthday, now here's a win Volleyball avenges last week's loss with home win 
### JOE KAY 
Wednesday night's win against
Pacific was a welcome birthday
present for both men's volleyball
coaches. Head coach Don Shaw's
birthday is February 9, and associ
ate head coach John Kosty's is Feb
ruary 8. The best gift, though, is the
hope that there will be more wins
ahead for the Cardinal.
After losing to the Tigers in four
games only five nights before, the
Cardinal posted a solid win (30-23,
30-22, 30-27) to boost their record
to 3-9 overall, 2-6 in the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation. The
Tigers dropped to 3-8,2-6.
All five of the team's seniors
played nearly the entire game. Ex
cept for one play when freshman
defensive specialist Jarod Keller
subbed in for senior middle blocker
Chris Ahlfeldt in the third game,
Stanford kept the same lineup
through the entire match.
"In this game, it was up to the

seniors to make something hap
pen," Shaw said. "We started [out
side hitter] Nick [Manov] and we
started [outside hitter] William
[Clayton]. I had a little talk with the
seniors this week and we just felt
like, 'you guys need to pick up the
pace.'
"I thought all of them did very,
very well tonight. And then you
throw [sophomore middle blocker
Matt] Ceran into the mix, and he
did a good job as well."
The coaches and players agreed
that the game-changing factor was
Stanford's improved passing accu
racy.
Pacific head coach Joe Wortman
said that Stanford played like an
entirely different team, far superior
to the squad that fell to his Tigers
last week.
"It's almost a complete rever
sal," he said. "[Stanford] won the
serve-and-pass battle of this match
hands down. Last Friday we won
the serve-and-pass battle."
"I think that one of the big dif
ferences in this game was that we
passed really well for the entire match,"
Clayton said. "And when you pass the
ball to net, [senior setter] Jeremy [Ja
cobs] can set anybody and give them a
set right on the money."
Ceran agreed with Clayton, but
thought that the team did a great job all
around. not just in passing.
"We served better, we passed better
and our middles were more effective,"
Ceran said. "That enabled our outsides
to be more effective too."
Sophomore outside hitter Pekka
Seppanen led the Tigers with 11 kills,
but it was not enough to stop the Car
dinal momentum. As a team. Pacific hit
a dismal.l 69. In a team-high 26 at
tempts, senior opposite hitter Brian
Adamson managed only six kills for
the Tigers.
Senior opposite hitter Ben Reddy
once again led the Cardinal 13 kills, de
spite having an off-night and hitting just
.100.
But every hitter on the court con
tributed his fair share to the Cardinal of
fensive effort. Clayton had 10 kills,
Ceran nine, Ahlfeldt eight and Manov
seven.
Jacobs dished out a total of 43 assists
in the match while junior libero Brian
Lindberg led the team with nine digs.
The Card had to be back at Burnham
Pavilion only a few hours after finishing
the match, meeting yesterday at 4:30
a.m. to catch a plane for Springfield,
Mass., where they will take part in the
Hall of Fame Classic.
Today, the Cardinal visit Springfield
College (5-2,3-0 EIVA-Hay).The Divi
sion 111 Pride had a tough season last
year, winning only six decisions in a total
of 21 games.
On Saturday the Cardinal play
against the East Coast's most domi
nant team in No. 11 Penn State (4-4).
Mark Pavlik, in his 12th season at the
helm of the Nittany Lion program, has
a career record of 115-43. Senior out
side hitter Matt Proper leads Penn
State with 4.25 kills per game, while
senior setter Dan O'Dell, closing out
an illustrious career, is dishing out 10.9
assists per game in conference matches
this season.
Nevertheless, the Cardinal are confi
dent in their ability to play with any
team on any given day.
"The more you win, the more your
confidence grows," Jacobs said.
"I just noticed that we were having a
lot more fun tonight," Manov said. "I
felt that the energy on the court was a
lot better."
Maybe it was the coaches' birth
day's that finally set a fire under the
Cardinal, to the delight of Stanford
fans. The Cardinal faithful are hoping
that the victories will keep coming and
the team will be able to make a run at
the MPSF playoffs.
