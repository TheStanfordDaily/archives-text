# SOFTBALL PROFILE
## Serene Slugger She seems laid-back, but there's a fire burning inside of her. JOHN RITTMAN, head coach 
### ANDREW LOMELI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When the sun sets over her
home in Sonoita, Arizona, sen
ior Catalina Morris is in a differ
ent world.
She's not thinking about her
two All-American honors, her
team-leading hatting average, or
even that pretty little NCAA
championship trophy that she
and her teammates could be
carrying home come June.
Instead, the part-time out
fielder, part-time "country girl"
is taking pleasure in the tran
quility that comes with riding
horses, something she has en
joyed since an early age.
"Riding is just more of a re
laxing activity," Morris said.
"There's so much stress with
softball, with all the intensity
and the adrenaline. Riding is a
nice break from the intensities
of my life."
While Morris may know how
to relax away from the game, she
also knows what it takes to suc
ceed on the field. Last season,
she was named second-team
All-America and first-team All
Pacific-10 Conference after
starting all 59 games in center
field for the Cardinal. Morris led
Stanford with a .351 average, 15
doubles, and four triples.
Head coach John Rittman
views Morris' consistency and
versatility as tremendous assets
for the team.
"She is outstanding both on
and off the field." he said. "Her
strong presence requires teams
to make plans to try to stop her.
And she has grown into one of
the best outfielders in the coun
try."

Before Softball, Morris spent much of her childhood
playing baseball. Her father Doug, a former player at UC-
Santa Barbara, first encouraged his young daughter to
play. Morris said that their practice time enabled her to de
velop a stronger relationship with her father, bonding over
their love of the game.
"My dad was dedicated to working with me all the
time," she said. "He was willing to go out and take batting
practice with me and work on my skills.That extra time we
had together was always nice. He wound up with two
daughters, and he was a huge baseball fan. so my playing
filled the gap."
Morris eventually switched to softball at age 12. Since

SIMPLE PLEASURES
Catalina Morris
When she's not leading the
Cardinal on the diamond, the
senior centerfielder loves
horseback riding and bonding
with her father over their
shared love of baseball.

then, she has depended on her
routines for success on a daily
basis.
"It's all about sticking to what
works to have a good game,"
she said. "1 usually repeat the
same routine the next day. Re
ally. you just need to get into
the right mindset, feel confi
dent and trust that your abili
ties will take over."
The first thing one notices
about Morris is her reserved
nature. Despite her passion for
the game. Morris does not wear
her emotion on her sleeve.
While her calm playing per
sona may be mistaken for de
tachment from the game, she
said she is merely living up to
the adage of taking the game
one pitch at a time without let
ting emotion get the best of her.
Rittman agreed with Morris'
assessment of her attitude.
"She seems laid-back, but
there's a fire burning inside of
her," Rittman said. "Though
she doesn't show her emotion
outside, she serves as a quiet
leader. Her play helps others
defensively and offensively.
She's been through all the bat
tles, so the younger players
look to her as a role model."
As for this season. Morris said
she is looking forward to work
ing with her best team yet. The
team's unique chemistry ex
tends beyond the diamond into
the players' personal lives.
"I've had a lot of great team
mates through my four years,
and I think this team is ex
tremely close," Morris said. "I
think we're all working to back
each other up. and we're like a

support group for each other,
both on and off the field. We're all really close friends
and even hang out on the weekends."
Morris said team will need to focus on build
ing on last season's success. With a solid base of return
ing players and two talented freshmen entering the
scene, the team will count on Morris' leadership-by-ex
ample to achieve the squad's goal of returning to the
Women's College World Series.
For Morris, a trip to the championship would be a
return to her greatest Stanford memory thus far —
playing in the Series in 2004.
And Morris would love nothing more than to be
able to ride her horse off into the Arizona sunset with
that final piece of hardware.

shared love of baseball.

then, she has depended on her
routines for success on a daily
basis.
"It's all about sticking to what
works to have a good game,"
she said. "1 usually repeat the
same routine the next day. Re
ally. you just need to get into
the right mindset, feel confi
dent and trust that your abili
ties will take over."
The first thing one notices
about Morris is her reserved
nature. Despite her passion for
the game. Morris does not wear
her emotion on her sleeve.
While her calm playing per
sona may be mistaken for de
tachment from the game, she
said she is merely living up to
the adage of taking the game
one pitch at a time without let
ting emotion get the best of her.
Rittman agreed with Morris'
assessment of her attitude.
"She seems laid-back, but
there's a fire burning inside of
her," Rittman said. "Though
she doesn't show her emotion
outside, she serves as a quiet
leader. Her play helps others
defensively and offensively.
She's been through all the bat
tles, so the younger players
look to her as a role model."
As for this season. Morris said
she is looking forward to work
ing with her best team yet. The
team's unique chemistry ex
tends beyond the diamond into
the players' personal lives.
"I've had a lot of great team
mates through my four years,
and I think this team is ex
tremely close," Morris said. "I
think we're all working to back
each other up. and we're like a

support group for each other,
both on and off the field. We're all really close friends
and even hang out on the weekends."
Morris said team will need to focus on build
ing on last season's success. With a solid base of return
ing players and two talented freshmen entering the
scene, the team will count on Morris' leadership-by-ex
ample to achieve the squad's goal of returning to the
Women's College World Series.
For Morris, a trip to the championship would be a
return to her greatest Stanford memory thus far —
playing in the Series in 2004.
And Morris would love nothing more than to be
able to ride her horse off into the Arizona sunset with
that final piece of hardware.
