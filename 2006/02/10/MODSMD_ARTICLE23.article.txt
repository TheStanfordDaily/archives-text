# BASEBALL PREVIEW
## Play together, stay together Close-knit Cardinal ready to take on Kansas, though without leader Sorgi 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
The Kansas squad that comes to Sunken Diamond
this weekend includes three sets of brothers and a father
and two sons. The Cardinal know, though, that blood ties
aren't necessary for team bonding.
Whether it's been on the field, at a movie, at a party, at
dinner or at laser tag. No. 19 Stanford baseball (3-0) has
made an effort to bond better this year than ever before.
While team chemistry had been something of a problem
in the past two seasons, junior pitcher Greg Reynolds said
that this year's team has progressed well ahead of those
squads, gelling to the point that the players consider
themselves one big family.
"The temperament is completely different when you
walk in the locker room," sophomore rightfielder
Michael Taylor said. "You look forward to seeing guys.
You look forward to getting out there with the guys on
the field. After the game, you look forward to seeing the
guys too."
The Cardinal will need that brotherly support and ca
maraderie now that junior third baseman Adam Sorgi,
Stanford's leading hitter last season, is gone for the sea
son. Sorgi underwent surgery on his right shoulder this
week.
"We're going to miss him,"Taylor said. "It's sad to not
see him out there with us. Anytime a junior who is such a
big part of the offense, with his batting average and lead
ership skills, [goes down, he] is going to be missed. But
we'll pick it up for him and we'll be here when he gets
back eventually."
Taylor played a central role last weekend in replacing
Sorgi's bat in the lineup, recording four hits and two RBI
against CSU-Fullerton (0-3). While Taylor said he feels
no pressure to make up for Sorgi's absence, he is hoping
to contribute at a higher level now.
"Whether Sorgi is here or not, it's not really a factor,"
Taylor said, adding that he would like to be a role model
for a talented freshman class. "But I am trying to lead on
the field with my performance. I'd like to be one of the
guys they look to for my performance on the field and
leadership on and oft"
The freshman class certainly made an impact in the
Cardinal's season opening series. Head coach Mark Mar
quess had enough confidence to give seven of them play

ing time during the weekend — and it paid off. Rookies
Jeremy Bleich.Sean Ratliff and Austin Yount all pitched
for wins, while Yount, also a third baseman, hit .429 in his
debut weekend.
"You can't say enough about the older guys on the
field, helping us fit in," Yount said. "You talk to any fresh
man. We feel like a part of the team and that's all because
the older players are making us feel comfortable."

Comfort wasn't

last year's squad, but,

competition within
the team wasn't ex

about losing their
spots; those new to

to do; and there was
not the respect
among the players
that there should
have been.

factors) together, and you don't really get to know people
as well as you'd like because you're focused on what you
have to do to play,"Taylor said.
This year, however, there were plenty of open spots
and the ensuing competition actually brought the team
together — not to mention the common goal to bounce
back from a disappointing 2005 season.
Initially unranked, Stanford took a step in the right di
rection by sweeping No. 5 CSU-Fullerton in their season
opening series. The sweep landed the Cardinal back in
Baseball America's national poll at No. 19. While rank
ings don't play on the field, Stanford agrees that the new
ranking better represents where the team stands.
"Rankings really don't make a difference to how hard
you play or how confident you are." Reynolds said.
"We've been confident from the start of the season. We
knew were good, and we didn't take it personally that we
weren't ranked."
Reynolds takes the mound tonight at 5 p.m. against
southpaw Sean Land (1-0,1.80), who will be starting for
the 4-1 Jayhawks.
After establishing his fastball last summer, Reynolds
(0-0,1.35) is aiming for strikeouts rather than contact this
season. That could explain his effective effort last Friday,

when he gave up just one run while scattering eight hits
over 6.2 innings.
"I definitely want to keep hits to a minimum this week
and put away hitters, especially when I'm ahead in the
count 0-2 or 1-2," Reynolds said. "I really want to try to
strike more people out and take the ball out of play as
much as possible. On the flip side, not walking anybody
(last week J was a big key to holding it to one run."
Kansas' Rick Fairchild (1-0,1.80) goes up against Matt
Manship (0-0,10.80) on Saturday at 1 p.m. On Sunday at
11 a.m., the Cardinal will get a look at former teammate
Kodiak Ouick (I -0,1.29). who spent two seasons on The
Farm before transferring to the Jayhawks last season.
Ouick finished last year with a 3.41 ERA and won his
squad's season opener against Hawaii last week, giving
up one run on six hits in seven innings of work.

Kansas' offense is led by Jared Schweitzer, who has
racked up 13 hits and eight runs in five games. Gus Mil
ner and Matt Baty follow with .550 and .417 batting aver
ages, respectively, and brothers Ryne and Ritchie Price
— the sons of Kansas coach Ritch Price — are hitting
.316 and .304, respectively.
Stanford leads the all-time series with Kansas. 6-0, but
the Cardinal know they will face a challenge from a team
projected to qualify for the NCAA tournament.
Wins this weekend will be vital to give the Cardinal
momentum into next week, when they will host No. 7
Texas (0-3) —ranked No. 1 preseason.
'We just have to take this series for what it is,come out
and get the first win Friday night against a pretty good
Kansas team and see how we do this weekend," Taylor
said. "When Monday comes, we'll shift our eyes toTexas."

"We've been confident from the start of the season. We
knew were good, and we didn't take it personally that we
weren't ranked."
Reynolds takes the mound tonight at 5 p.m. against
southpaw Sean Land (1-0,1.80), who will be starting for
the 4-1 Jayhawks.
After establishing his fastball last summer, Reynolds
(0-0,1.35) is aiming for strikeouts rather than contact this
season. That could explain his effective effort last Friday,

when he gave up just one run while scattering eight hits
over 6.2 innings.
"I definitely want to keep hits to a minimum this week
and put away hitters, especially when I'm ahead in the
count 0-2 or 1-2," Reynolds said. "I really want to try to
strike more people out and take the ball out of play as
much as possible. On the flip side, not walking anybody
(last week J was a big key to holding it to one run."
Kansas' Rick Fairchild (1-0,1.80) goes up against Matt
Manship (0-0,10.80) on Saturday at 1 p.m. On Sunday at
11 a.m., the Cardinal will get a look at former teammate
Kodiak Ouick (I -0,1.29). who spent two seasons on The
Farm before transferring to the Jayhawks last season.
Ouick finished last year with a 3.41 ERA and won his
squad's season opener against Hawaii last week, giving
up one run on six hits in seven innings of work.

Kansas' offense is led by Jared Schweitzer, who has
racked up 13 hits and eight runs in five games. Gus Mil
ner and Matt Baty follow with .550 and .417 batting aver
ages, respectively, and brothers Ryne and Ritchie Price
— the sons of Kansas coach Ritch Price — are hitting
.316 and .304, respectively.
Stanford leads the all-time series with Kansas. 6-0, but
the Cardinal know they will face a challenge from a team
projected to qualify for the NCAA tournament.
Wins this weekend will be vital to give the Cardinal
momentum into next week, when they will host No. 7
Texas (0-3) —ranked No. 1 preseason.
'We just have to take this series for what it is,come out
and get the first win Friday night against a pretty good
Kansas team and see how we do this weekend," Taylor
said. "When Monday comes, we'll shift our eyes toTexas."

Junior right-hander Matt Leva is the veteran leader of a young Stanford pitching corps. He is the active leader in wins
on the squad with a record of 1 1 -4 in his last two seasons.
The Kansas squad that comes to Sunken Diamond
this weekend includes three sets of brothers and a father
and two sons. The Cardinal know, though, that blood ties
aren't necessary for team bonding.
Whether it's been on the field, at a movie, at a party, at
dinner or at laser tag. No. 19 Stanford baseball (3-0) has
made an effort to bond better this year than ever before.
While team chemistry had been something of a problem
in the past two seasons, junior pitcher Greg Reynolds said
that this year's team has progressed well ahead of those
squads, gelling to the point that the players consider
themselves one big family.
"The temperament is completely different when you
walk in the locker room," sophomore rightfielder
Michael Taylor said. "You look forward to seeing guys.
You look forward to getting out there with the guys on
the field. After the game, you look forward to seeing the
guys too."
The Cardinal will need that brotherly support and ca
maraderie now that junior third baseman Adam Sorgi,
Stanford's leading hitter last season, is gone for the sea
son. Sorgi underwent surgery on his right shoulder this
week.
"We're going to miss him,"Taylor said. "It's sad to not
see him out there with us. Anytime a junior who is such a
big part of the offense, with his batting average and lead
ership skills, [goes down, he] is going to be missed. But
we'll pick it up for him and we'll be here when he gets
back eventually."
Taylor played a central role last weekend in replacing
Sorgi's bat in the lineup, recording four hits and two RBI
against CSU-Fullerton (0-3). While Taylor said he feels
no pressure to make up for Sorgi's absence, he is hoping
to contribute at a higher level now.
"Whether Sorgi is here or not, it's not really a factor,"
Taylor said, adding that he would like to be a role model
for a talented freshman class. "But I am trying to lead on
the field with my performance. I'd like to be one of the
guys they look to for my performance on the field and
leadership on and oft"
The freshman class certainly made an impact in the
Cardinal's season opening series. Head coach Mark Mar
quess had enough confidence to give seven of them play

ing time during the weekend — and it paid off. Rookies
Jeremy Bleich.Sean Ratliff and Austin Yount all pitched
for wins, while Yount, also a third baseman, hit .429 in his
debut weekend.
"You can't say enough about the older guys on the
field, helping us fit in," Yount said. "You talk to any fresh
man. We feel like a part of the team and that's all because
the older players are making us feel comfortable."

Comfort wasn't

to do; and there was

that there should

factors) together, and you don't really get to know people
as well as you'd like because you're focused on what you
have to do to play,"Taylor said.
This year, however, there were plenty of open spots
and the ensuing competition actually brought the team
together — not to mention the common goal to bounce
back from a disappointing 2005 season.
Initially unranked, Stanford took a step in the right di
rection by sweeping No. 5 CSU-Fullerton in their season
opening series. The sweep landed the Cardinal back in
Baseball America's national poll at No. 19. While rank
ings don't play on the field, Stanford agrees that the new
ranking better represents where the team stands.
"Rankings really don't make a difference to how hard
you play or how confident you are." Reynolds said.
"We've been confident from the start of the season. We
knew were good, and we didn't take it personally that we
