## Riding the streak 
### ROHAN PURANIK 
After five years of domination
in conference play, the only thing
missing for Stanford lacrosse has
been a postseason berth.
The Cardinal kicks off its pur
suit of a sixth straight MPSF title
this Saturday with a home game
against the Oregon Ducks.
This year's Cardinal squad
has a solid core of 20 returning
players. The veteran group in
cludes two key attacks in seniors
Megan Burker and Sarah Bach.
Burker scored 30 goals and 19
assists during the 2005 season
and was invited to the U.S.
Lacrosse Developmental Team.
Additionally, Burker currently
ranks sixth on the Stanford ca
reer goals list with 98.
Bach contributed 40 goals and
nine assists over the course of the
2005 season â€” her 40 tallies
placed her fifth on Stanford's all
time single-season scoring list.
Returning sophomore goal
keeper Laura Shane, who had a
.560 saving percentage last season
(fifth-best in Division I lacrosse) is
back in the net for the Cardinal.
Shane's 204 saves last year gave
her the second highest single-sea
son save total in the Cardinal
record books. Senior goalkeeper
Kate Horowitz and junior goal
keeper Carly Posner will also be
returning to this year's squad.
Head coach Michele
Uhlfeldcr, who has a .667 winning
record as head coach at Stanford,
will be coming back for her sixth
season at the helm of the Cardinal
women.
It was due largely to
Uhlfelder's superior coaching
abilities that the squad earned a
berth at NCAAs last season. Dur
ing her tenure on the Farm,
Uhlfelder has coached the team to
four Mountain Pacific Sports Fed

eration championships and a 31-
game winning streak in confer
ence play that has spanned five
years.
But the Cardinal will also ben
efit from several additions to the
team. New this season are fresh
men midfielders Bess Siegfried,
Jamie Nesbitt. midfield/attack
Maris Perlman, defenders Vicky
Fanslow and Polly Brown, attack
Aly English, midfield/attack Eliz
abeth Fries and defender/mid
fielder Melissa Vogelsong.
Nesbitt, Siegfried and Perlman
were all first-team Ail-Americans
in high school.
The squad has been focusing
on top-quality defending through
out their offseason practices.
"We've really broken down
our defense," Nesbitt said. "We've
focused on individual position
ing."
With offseason training finally
over, the squad is eagerly looking
forward to the opener against
Oregon.
"All the freshmen are really ex
cited for this upcoming game,"
Nesbitt said. "It'll be our first time
representing Stanford. We've had
scrimmages, but this first game will
give us an opportunity to test the
skills we've been working so hard
on all off-season."
Last year was the Ducks' inau
gural season as a varsity program,
and fell to the Cardinal 19-6 in
their only meeting. The Cardinal
hope to again capitalize on Ore
gon's relative inexperience this
year. They will particularly be
looking to shut down Oregon's of
fense by focusing on key defensive
techniques
"One of the things we've been
working on for this game is de
fending cutters," Nesbitt said.
The Cardinal will take on the
Ducks in their season opener at
1:00 p.m. on Saturday at Maloney
Field.
