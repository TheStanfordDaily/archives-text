# NEW SSE CEO NAMED
## AN INTERVIEW WITH MATT MCDONALD 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Recently appointed to be the new ASSU Fi
nancial Manager and Stanford Student Enterpris
es (SSE) Chief Executive Officer. Matt McDonald
will officially take over the positions from Justin
Fishner-Wolfson beginning July 1.
; McDonald graduated from Stanford in De
cember with a bachelor's degree in economics and
has been working in the office for the past two
vyeeks, getting acclimated and learning the ropes.
• "I'm in the training phase right now," McDon
ald said. "I'm still getting a feel for how the whole
process works."
McDonald brings past leadership experience to
the job, though not with the ASSU. He was the cap
tain of the men's swimming and diving team and
also served as leader of the Bollards Dining Soci
ety at Governors' Corner during his undergradu
ate years.
"I saw the offering for the position on the CDC
website for the fall recruiting fair and looked into
it and got really excited," he said, of his new role.
"Matt was hired by a very knowledgeable
search committee and we expect him to excel as
CEO/FM," said Fishner-Wolfson, who said he is
currently mentoring McDonald on a set of proj
ects while the two work to pass a bill that will allow
his replacement to serve as associate financial
manager until the start of his term in July.
The SSE manages six groups on campus — re
tail, advertising, capital, Internet solutions, service
and development — that provide services and
products for students, including the Stanford
Store, the Unofficial Guide to Stanford, flier distri
bution services. Flicks and the business leadership
program for seniors. While the majority of profit
from these businesses goes into the ASSU operat
ing budget, surplus funds are also funneled to the
ASSU endowment.
" The profit goes back to the student body," Mc-
Donald said.
The two positions have been held jointly by one
person since 19%. McDonald explained that be
cause the money SSE produces partially funds the
ASSU, the two organizations are two sides of one
coin. The SSE is essentially the business branch of
the ASSU.
"It's really one and the same, just two divi
sions," he said.
Fishner-Wolfson explained the reason why the

jobs were linked.
"The positions were consolidated to provide
more financial oversight to the various business
projects that the ASSU operated," he said. "The
CEO/FM position allows an individual to set clear
visions and business objectives, ensuring the long
term financial security of the ASSU."
McDonald said that right now he is concentrat
ing on hiring employees, due to a generally high
turnover year-to-year. He is currently conducting
interviews for general managers and will move on
to hiring managers in the next couple of weeks.
"One goal is to get a really good team prepared
for next year," McDonald said.
Asked about his plans for the upcoming year,
McDonald spoke about continuing the work Fish
ner-Wolfson has done to expand operations and

improve efficiency.
"Right now we're in the brainstorming process
and getting a feel for how much room we have to
expand on our current enterprises," he said. "The
enterprises are healthy right now, the challenges
are involved in bringing them to the next level."
Fishner-Wolfson said he agreed that there is
potential for further development.
" By focusing on our core advertising, retail and
design businesses we have built a strong founda
tion for continued growth " he said. "1 expect that
in the coming year we will begin to branch out into
new businesses and services on campus."
Asked if he had any advice for McDonald, Fish
ner-Wolfson said. "As with any organization, we
must always look for new opportunities, new solu
tions and new businesses."
