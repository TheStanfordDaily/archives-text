## Cisco CEO urges innovation 
### JENNIFER CHIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"By the time something is obvious, it's too late,"
Cisco Systems President and CEO John Chambers re
minded students and faculty seated in Hewlett Teach
ing Center last night. In his speech,"Education and the
Internet: the Two Global Equalizers," sponsored by the
Stanford Computer Forum Industry Lecture Series,
Chambers repeatedly attributed his company's success
to accurate market foresight.
"Catching market trends early determines winners
and losers," Chambers said. Cisco has been consistent
ly ahead of its competitors in this area for the last ten
years, and it has paid off. Of its dozen competitors from
1995, Chambers reported, only three still exist.
Cisco began as a router company just over twenty
years ago. Now. however, the company has pushed it
self out of its comfort zone and has a foot in many
other markets. These include network security, data
storage networking and, thanks to the recent acquisi
tion of leading manufacturer Scientific-Atlanta, video
broadcasting. All of these venues count as catching
early market trends.
Chambers compared this multi-faceted approach to
a chess game. He visualized the chess game in four di
mensions with eight variable equations, with competi
tors only working in one dimension. These extra as
pects give Cisco an advantage over its rivals.
Cisco's goal. Chambers said, is ultimately the same
as it was ten years ago: to network different applica
tions together so the entire network works as a plat
form. The company is working towards this goal by be
coming the top in several product areas.
"And if we can't be in the first five in a certain mar
ket, we'll acquire one," Chambers added. He further re
marked that as a rule of thumb, Cisco does not acquire
competitors; they acquire only to enter new markets.
This helps the company experience ten percent pro
ductivity growth every year in a market where most
only expect 2-to-3 percent annual growth.
Most of Cisco's current work revolves around the
Internet, specifically focusing on how it can be better
tailored to work for the public.This approach reflects
Chambers' fundamental belief in the importance of
the Web.
"Education was the great equalizer for my parent's
generation, "he said.'But for our generation,it's the In
ternet."
Despite this belief, however. Chambers has made
sure that education does not fall to the wayside. Ac
cording to his biography. Secretary of State Con
doleeza Rice recently awarded Cisco with the Award
for Corporate Excellence for co-sponsoring the Jordan
Education Initiative, which Chambers touched on last
night.
Cisco's next project is the education system in Hur

ricane Katrina-stricken areas, to which the company re
cently donated $40 million. Chambers plans to use
teachers as engineers to redo the curriculum and even
tually hopes to change the American education system.
"Is that a dream?" Chambers asked. "Maybe. Will it
work? There's a 50-50 chance. But we're not usually
wrong as a company" he added with a chuckle.
Chambers also took time to praise the educational
environment at Stanford, claiming that, "Stanford does
innovation better than anywhere else."
In a way, Chambers' praise brings his company full
circle. According to company history, Len Bosack and
Sandy Lerner,then two married members of Stanford's
computer support staff, founded Cisco in offices be
neath the Quad in December 1984. Chambers report
ed that Cisco now employs 460 Stanford alumni.
This Cardinal connection actually spurred Cham
bers to suggest a lecture on campus, said Andrew Lee.
Cisco's university relations development manager.
"He felt that there was a spirit and relationship we
need to rekindle," Lee said, adding that Chambers es
pecially wanted to witness firsthand Stanford's atmos
phere of innovation and technology and be challenged
by bright students.
Members of the Stanford Computer Forum, which
sponsored the event, said they thought the lecture and
the following reception to be a success.
"The audience seemed to appreciate [Chamber's]
thoughts," said Jill Anderson, one of the Forum's mem
ber services associates. "They felt engaged when he
asked what they wanted to hear at the beginning of the
speech" and during the question section at the end, she
added.
"We're impressed with the turnout," added Connie
Chan, a member of the recruiting department. Most
who attended the event were computer science and
electrical engineering students, to whom the forum pri
marily serves.
Though Chambers will not be with them, Cisco rep
resentatives will return to campus next week to inter
view potential recruits.
