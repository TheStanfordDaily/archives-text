## Proposal system slated for upgrade Faculty Senate aims to adopt new research management software 
### LESLIE GEORGATOS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
During its bi-weekly meeting
Thursday night, the Faculty Senate
evaluated the progress of an ongo
ing project aimed to revitalize
Stanford's system for research pro
posals.
Chairman of the Faculty Senate
and Computer Science Prof. Eric
Roberts introduced the report by
distinguishing between long-term
and short-term problems facing the
Office of Research Administration.
Immediately at hand is the risk
Stanford faces by using soon-to-be
obsolete software for preparing and
submitting research proposals for
government awards.
Director of Research Adminis
tration Anne Hannigan spoke
about the urgent need for Stanford
to change its inefficient current sys
tem. which, among other problems,
entails the major risk of non-com
pliance with federal requirements.
A steering committee of Stan
ford Research Administration lead
ers reviewed existing systems and
settled on InfoEd as the best new
option. The system allows for
streamlined workflow linking re
searchers, faculty and the adminis
tration; it also keeps track of federal
requirements to ensure compliance.
According to Hannigan, InfoEd
distinguishes itself from larger com
petitors like Peoplesoft and Oracle
in its in-depth understanding of the
business of research administration.
In an early test, InfoEd got many
positive reviews from selected Stan
ford faculty and research adminis
trators.
Recently, there has been move
ment toward electronic systems for
research proposal submission and
preparation.The Stanford group an
alyzed decisions at comparable re
search institutions such as Johns
Hopkins, Cornell. University of
Pennsylvania and Harvard. Most of
them are adopting single electronic
systems to facilitate the research ad
ministration process. Several gov
ernment agencies that fund re
search have announced that they
will require electronic submission of

proposals by 2(X)6, Hannigan said.
Ultimately, the goals of the im
plementation of the new system are
to effectively manage research pro
posals, facilitate cross-disciplinary
research and lower the burden on
administrative staff.
Because Stanford spends nearly
$1 billion annually on research, the
implementation of a new program
like InfoEd is a very important un
dertaking. According to a Stanford
Electronic Research Administra
tion report, research income ac
counts for 37 percent of the Univer
sity's revenues.
Still, the group emphasized that
this is just a preliminary report de
signed to ensure that faculty and
staff are being kept up-to-date on
software proposals that may affect
their work.
"Over half of the faculty is in a
position to be affected [by any new
system]," said Roberts. "'lTiere was
some unhappiness about the imple
mentation of Oracle's software, and
we want to people to be better in
formed all along this time around."
Among other issues addressed at
the meeting, the Senate unanimous
ly passed the Committee on Review
of Undergraduate Majors' recom
mended re-authorization of degree
granting authority for the American
Studies program for the next five
years.
Brad Osgood, chairman of the
Committee, presided over a glow
ing report on the improvements
made to Stanford's Interdiscipli
nary Program in American Studies
since a 2001 review. He joined
other senators in voicing gratitude
for the leadership of Director of
American Studies Shelley Fishkin
for revamping the program and es
tablishing the major as a campus
wide presence.
"This is an excellent example of
good results from a thorough senate
review of a program," said Osgood.
"This program is in great shape, and
its future looks bright."
The meeting concluded with a
brief report on the effect of Presi
dent George W. Bush's proposed
budget on research at universities
liktt Stanford. Increases in funding
for the Department of Energy and
the Office of Science were hopeful
signs, but cuts at NASA and the De
partment of Defense â€”.4 percent
