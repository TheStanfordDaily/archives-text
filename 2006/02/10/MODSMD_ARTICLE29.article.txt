# ADMISSIONS BRIEF
## Record number apply, Shaw says 
### 
After topping 20.000 for the first time last year, applica
tions for undergraduate admission to Stanford have set an
other historic high. This year, the University received a
record total of 22,223 applications, a 10 percent increase
over last year.
According to a statement released by Dean of Admis
sion and Financial Aid Richard Shaw, 4,503 prospective
students applied during the Single-Choice Early Action
period, while Stanford received the remaining 17,720 ap
plications during the Regular Review period.
"We are honored by the strong interest in Stanford this
year, and look forward to reading each application we re
ceived," said Shaw, former Dean of Admissions and Finan
cial Aid at Yale University before arriving on the Farm in
Sept. 2005.
Stanford admission officers now face the daunting talk
of reviewing the applications and beginning the evaluation
process. Notification of admission decisions is expected by
April 1.
