## $1.05 million to fund Stanford research 
### ANNE RITCHIE STAFF WRITER 
The Presidential Fund for Innovation
in International Studies, in conjunction
with the Freeman Spogli Institute for In
ternational Studies, has awarded grants to
taling $1.05 million to Stanford faculty
members. Eight new interdisciplinary re
search projects will benefit from the grant.
"Most of the projects will align with
the three priorities of the Stanford Inter
national Initiative: enhancing the
prospects for peace and security; improv
ing governance at levels of society; and
advancing human well-being," explained
Political Science Prof. Coit D. Blacker, di
rector of the Freeman Spogli Institute for
International Studies. "Exceptionally
strong and innovative proposals that fall
outside these priorities may also be fund
ed," he added.
Each project must have two or more
faculty leaders and must represent differ
ent departments and academic disciplines.
"Awards may be in any amount, up to
$300,000 over a three-year period," he
said. "The funds are provided jointly and
equally by the Office of the President and
the Freeman Spogli Institute for Interna
tional Studies."
A Faculty Executive Committee, com
prised of representatives from all seven
Stanford schools and the Hoover Institu
tion, selected the winning projects. Among
those selected was Infectious Diseases Prof.
David Katzenstein and Political Science

"They help faculty and
students come together to
study international issues in
ways that would not
otherwise be possible.

Prof. Jeremy Weinstein's proposal, "Com
bating HIV/AIDS in Southern Africa: ITie
Treatment Revolution and its Impact on
Health, Well-Being and Governance."
The project, according to Weinstein, is a
collaboration between biomedical re
searchers and social scientists to examine the
impact of anti-retroviral treatment in Sub-
Saharan Africa. From the biomedical side,
the focus is on the evolution of drug resist
ance. From the perspective of social science,
researchers will investigate the economic,so
cial, and political impacts of access to treat
ment on households and communities.
"We were thrilled to get the grant," he
added."The Presidential Fund for Innova
tion in International Studies represents an
excellent opportunity for faculty with
common interests to bridge disciplinary
and institutional divides in an effort to in
crease Stanford's impact in addressing
today's global challenges."

The $1.05 million grant will fund an array of research programs, and in the future may
benefit organizations that aid communities like this one in Maweni, Tanzania.
