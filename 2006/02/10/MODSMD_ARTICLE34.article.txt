# Editor's Note

### 
Dearest Readers:
As I am sure it was for many of you, this week was a long
one for me. Intermission has had some amazing opportu
nities (*cough* Harrison Ford *cough*) but mostly we do
feel that this week is a little sparse. Maybe it is because it is
between the Oscars and the Globes; maybe it is because
Betsy was off doing....! mean...with...a certain someone (its
sad because its not true); but it is not because our writers are
not dedicated.
Victor and I would like to take a moment to thank De
vmin for going above and beyond in trying to get to a
screening on Wednesday. He didn't make it to his final des
tination (pun...the movie Final Destination 3) but consider
ing the plot of the movie that is probably a good thing. For
those of you who were really wishing for review of said
movie, we did get the press kit. The press kit was very artsy
and better than the movie, which is not a good sign.
Therefore, this week is about quality not quantity of ar
ticles. For a study break, Intermission brings you Richard
Cheese in the same way we brought you Jeezie (Jeezie is
still a good bet). So don't do drugs, stay in school, eat your
vegetables and only you can prevent forest fires.
Good luck on those midterms. Victor and I hope that In
termission brightens your day!
