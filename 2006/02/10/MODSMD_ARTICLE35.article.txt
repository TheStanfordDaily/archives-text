## 'Firewall' falls flat 
### VICTOR FUSTE INTERMISSION FORD CONNOSEIUR 
Hollywood is a creature .of habit. Over the
course of NO years, il has established a set pat
tern of operation that maximizes profits while
minimizing production costs. One of the staples
of this system is the practice ol unloading
mediocre films during the months of January. I eb
ruary and March (i.e. months where kids are in
school and people work). That's where "I irewall"
comes in.
In his first feature film since the apth titled "Hoil\
wood Homicide." Harrison l ord stars as bank-securitv
specialist Jack Stanfjeld. All is peach > in Jackis world:
he has a, loving family, a monstrous house on some sup
posedly undeveloped lake near Seattle, and a .lucrative',
job with an office overlooking the city. A cliche plot in
voking Jack's family getting kidnapped by high-tech
bank robbers is the main source ol conflict of.a film that
drives toward a wholly predictable ending.
The main draw back of this film is the numerous plot
holes. For example. Jack falls victim to identity theft
early on in the film, leading us to believe tliiit "Firewall"
w ill be pertinent to the future of personal Security. I Un
fortunately. any potential social commentary is throw n
by the w avside in favor of an inane story line. Someone
rides up $ I )S.(XH) in online gambling debt using Jackis
identity but we never find out who does it. if it's related
at all to .the. kidnappers, or even if it gets resolved. A
good 10 minutes of screen time is devoted to a -.com
pletely irrelevant subplot. Afterward, the audience is
left wondering why the hell it was even in the mOvie.
"Firewall" continues the trend of overused Holly
wood plot con ventions. One of the most irksome things
about bad guys in any Hollywood-produced action
movie is how inhumanly stupid they are. When relo
cating the family to an undisclosed location, the kid
nappers Unbelievably decide to bring along the family
dog. which just so happens to look like Benji. In one of
the greatest "what the («#&!?"'-moments. Jack man
ages to track down his family because the dog random
ly has a freaking Ci PS installed in his collar. On top of
that, he gets up-to-the-minute updates 011 Ins laptop
through the miracles of wireless internet that works in
the middle of the desert. I don't know about you-, but I
can barely get wireless in my dorm room, much less in
the wilderness.
Plot drawbacks aside, the..movie also relies heavily
upon predictable cinematography: nothing exciting in
terms of camera angles, movement or filters here.
Everything sticks to the tried and true formulas audi
ences have seen in countless other thriller/heist movies,
down to the violent freeze frames of the kidnapping
scene to the "War of the Worlds"-esque ending where
everything ends up happy as the family walks off to
gether in slow motion.
Fven Seattle is predictably type-cast as a perpetual
ly rainy city (.it's not. 1 live there). Strangely enough, it
only rains when Jack is in the throes of inner turmoil
over the fate of his family. The one shot of the city
where it's not raining comes very early on. before any of
the plot gets in the way: but. once the film falls into the
typical action film formula. Seattle regains its conven
tionally rainy demeanor. Got to hand it to I lollywood
for keeping things fresh, right?

Th e
one re
deeming fac
tor of the
film is. of
course. Har
rison Ford.
Sixty-threv
years young,
and Ford just

keeps getting
more badass as

he ages. Very ]
few actors in Hol
lywood today can
command the re
spect in the same
way that lord's

gravely voice does.
He can even hold
his own against
younger action stars
-as any of the kid
nappers who found
themselves at the
business end of a
pickaxe can attest
to. It's a shame that

such an iconic actor gets stuck !
in such mediocre fare.
For a film that has no fire
walls of any kind — technolog
ical or literal— "Firewall" is a

completely forgettable film that
wastes the talents of a great actor
and sticks to predictable plot for
mulas. If you really want classic
Harrison Ford goodness, hold out
until "Indiana Jones IV".
