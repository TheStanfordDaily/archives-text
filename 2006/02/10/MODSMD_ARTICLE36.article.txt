# Intermission sits down with the legendary
## HARRISONFORD 
### VICTOR FUSTE INTERMISSION INDIANA JONES 
* Life is good to Intermission.
Some people go their entire life
never crossing paths with a Holly
wood celebrity, much less one
renowned for films that make up
our popular culture. Fortunately
for you, Intermission takes you
across hyperspace, onto Air Force
One, and into the Temple of Doom
to meet one of Hollywood's
biggest legends.
Q: One thing I've noticed about
your career is that you play char
acters who are the average guy
who is forced into dealing with ex
traordinary circumstances. That's
what this character is in this film. Is
that a role that just really appeals
to you?
HARRISON FORD: Well, no
more so than a Russian submarine
captian or brain-damaged lawyer
or Allie Fox [Editor's Note: from
"Mosquito Coast"] or whatever
else happens to come along. As
per many of the roles that I have
done in which I play the ordinary
man in extraordinary circum
stances, if you look at the films
overall I think you'll see a greater
breadth than that. The characters
that are presumed innocent is an
ordinary man, but the circum

stances are extraordinary, but he's
not a heroic character. So it's not
something that I require, but it
does seem to be um, the common
stuff out of which the leading
man's role is made. That's the na
ture of American film and the util
ity of the American leading man.
Q: How did you prepare for this
role, especially for the fight
scenes? How did you get into
shape or stay in shape and then the
character itself?
HF: Well, the preparation for this
role was...well, we had a lot of
script work to do. And 1 was in
volved in that work from the very
beginning. So the research that I
did was with banking profession
als and software designers so that I
could be very specific with the
character that I am playing. As far
as the physical aspect of the role,
there's not really much to do. As
you can imagine, it is an illusion.
The fight scene is very closely
choreographed. I feel fit enough to
do things like that. It's a pleasure
for me. I've been sitting around in
a wet suit for four months [Edi
tor's Note: "Firewall" takes place
in Seattle]. It feels good to do a lit
tle physical work. Work up a sweat
for a while. You know, I spent a lot

of time not doing action ftlms be
cause I insist t
t ion" movies.!

andidenti his?
HI A little bit. Not much. You
know. I think it's always
to be aware of what's going o>: in
your environment. We're all
mi sept able to various forms of in
trusion, invasion. In today's world,
you gotta keep your eyes open.
Check your six. i*
INT: What part of the filmmaking
process do you find most reward
ing?
HF: i like the problem-solving as
pect of n as much as anything. 1
like figuring out what to do with
some degree of definition. I've al
ways said thait that is the hard part
of acting, tha| doing it is the easy
part. You just-dress up and play
like kids. Sol I'm from the "Lei's
pretend" school iof acting.
INT: What do you least like about
the whole process?
HF: I don't think there's & part of
filmmaking that I don't enjoy.
Q: Even this?
HF: No, this is not my favorite
part. I was confining myself to the
shooting aspect of it. No, I don't
enjoy this very much. It's just hard
to talk about yourself over and
over again and to remain truthful
and appropriate and focused on
what I've come here for. I've come
here to try to do the film some ad
vantage. I've come here to try to
take advantage of people's inter
est and perhaps stimulate them to
go and see the movie.
INT: Our school just started a new
film studies program. As someone
who has been in film for so long,
could you give them any pointers ji
or advice for a way to get into and
succeed in the film industry. Jig
HF: Those people that are serious
about i in esting themselves in a ca
reer, as an actor in films, or any
kind of person involved in films.

the one thing that I came to under
stand is that there is actually no
more competition for the genuine
ly good stuff than there is for the
shit tnere's not. There's more
people actually chasing the crap
than there are people who are
aware of what is good. So if you
«imply keep you eye on what the
good stuff is and be ambitious for
that. 1 think that may be the best
thing you can do for yourself.
Q: You've been recognized as the
sexiest man alive by "People" in
1997...
HF: And they're real experts.
Q: ...you were also in their list of 50
roost beautiful people in 1996,
number one in "Empire" maga
zine's 'Top 300 movie stars"...
HF: Nothing last year. That was a
long time ago.
Q: You've had all sorts of awards
recognitions. How does this affect
you career in general and your
outlook on your career?
HF:It has nothing to do with my
career. It has to do with the busi
ness of celebrity journalism, which
is a self-serving industry. I don't
consider being the sexiest man
alive praise and I don't consider it
part of my work, so its rubbish.
INT: Would you find that if there
wasn't this celebrity "machine"
that your career as an actor would
be more focused?
HF: No, I don't think my career as
an actor would be easier. I think
my life would be easier. I think this
all comes out of the feeling that
people have that they don't have
much effect in their lives. So they
look at people who are in one way
or another successful and they
think there must be some lesson to
be learned from their lives that
they can apply to their own. And I
don't think that's very true. I think
we have a general obsession with
success and that's where the whole
celebrity thing comes from.
Q; Reading back to your early days
when people told you to get out of
acting, would you say that if there

was one thing to come out of you r
career it is to just keep going at it?
HF: Yeah, so when you asked for
advice, the second thing I would
said is "Don't give up."
Tenacity is often the key to things.
You come in with a bunch of peo
ple approximately the same age
and most of them give up after a pe
riod of time and those that don't
find themselves in iliinning ranks. 1
think while you're learning, differ
ing the outrageous twists and turns
that come your w&y in this business,
you just have to maintain your am
bition, your focus on what you want
out of it. All I really wanted out of
it was not to have make a living
doing something else.
Q: What is the status of the "Indi
ana Jones" movie?
HF: Well, we're closer than we've
ever been. We have a script that
we all think is a good armature.
There is some work being done on
the script right now, but I think it
should be pretty easily accom
plished and I'm looking forward to
playing the character again and
working with Steven [Spielberg].
Q: Was there anything over the
years as an actor that prepared
you for having action figures of
yourself or theme park rides in
you image.
HF: No. I just find it all mildly
amusing. But only mildly.
INT: So does that mean you've
never ridden the "Indiana Jones"
ride?
HF: No, I haven't.
INT: Finally, on the subject of
"Star Wars," what did you think of
the prequels?
HF: Well, I think they are very dif
ferent films made for a very differ
ent audience. A lot of time has
passed and I think film has
changed. Film craft has changed.
The potential of technology has
advanced enormously. And the
audience has changed. The audi
ence is more used to the newer
kind of movie making.

people have that they don't have
much effect in their lives. So they
look at people who are in one way
or another successful and they
think there must be some lesson to
be learned from their lives that
they can apply to their own. And I
don't think that's very true. I think
we have a general obsession with
success and that's where the whole
celebrity thing comes from.
Q; Reading back to your early days
when people told you to get out of
acting, would you say that if there

was one thing to come out of you r
career it is to just keep going at it?
HF: Yeah, so when you asked for
advice, the second thing I would
said is "Don't give up."
Tenacity is often the key to things.
You come in with a bunch of peo
ple approximately the same age
and most of them give up after a pe
riod of time and those that don't
find themselves in iliinning ranks. 1
think while you're learning, differ
ing the outrageous twists and turns
that come your w&y in this business,
you just have to maintain your am
bition, your focus on what you want
out of it. All I really wanted out of
it was not to have make a living
doing something else.
Q: What is the status of the "Indi
ana Jones" movie?
HF: Well, we're closer than we've
ever been. We have a script that
we all think is a good armature.
There is some work being done on
the script right now, but I think it
should be pretty easily accom
plished and I'm looking forward to
playing the character again and
working with Steven [Spielberg].
Q: Was there anything over the
years as an actor that prepared
you for having action figures of
yourself or theme park rides in
you image.
HF: No. I just find it all mildly
amusing. But only mildly.
INT: So does that mean you've
never ridden the "Indiana Jones"
ride?
HF: No, I haven't.
INT: Finally, on the subject of
"Star Wars," what did you think of
the prequels?
HF: Well, I think they are very dif
ferent films made for a very differ
ent audience. A lot of time has
passed and I think film has
changed. Film craft has changed.
The potential of technology has
advanced enormously. And the
audience has changed. The audi
ence is more used to the newer
kind of movie making.

* Life is good to Intermission.
Some people go their entire life
never crossing paths with a Holly
wood celebrity, much less one
renowned for films that make up
our popular culture. Fortunately
for you, Intermission takes you
across hyperspace, onto Air Force
One, and into the Temple of Doom
to meet one of Hollywood's
biggest legends.
Q: One thing I've noticed about
your career is that you play char
acters who are the average guy
who is forced into dealing with ex
traordinary circumstances. That's
what this character is in this film. Is
that a role that just really appeals
to you?
HARRISON FORD: Well, no
more so than a Russian submarine
captian or brain-damaged lawyer
or Allie Fox [Editor's Note: from
"Mosquito Coast"] or whatever
else happens to come along. As
per many of the roles that I have
done in which I play the ordinary
man in extraordinary circum
stances, if you look at the films
overall I think you'll see a greater
breadth than that. The characters
that are presumed innocent is an
ordinary man, but the circum

stances are extraordinary, but he's
not a heroic character. So it's not
something that I require, but it
does seem to be um, the common
stuff out of which the leading
man's role is made. That's the na
ture of American film and the util
ity of the American leading man.
Q: How did you prepare for this
role, especially for the fight
scenes? How did you get into
shape or stay in shape and then the
character itself?
HF: Well, the preparation for this
role was...well, we had a lot of
script work to do. And 1 was in
volved in that work from the very
beginning. So the research that I
did was with banking profession
als and software designers so that I
could be very specific with the
character that I am playing. As far
as the physical aspect of the role,
there's not really much to do. As
you can imagine, it is an illusion.
The fight scene is very closely
choreographed. I feel fit enough to
do things like that. It's a pleasure
for me. I've been sitting around in
a wet suit for four months [Edi
tor's Note: "Firewall" takes place
in Seattle]. It feels good to do a lit
tle physical work. Work up a sweat
for a while. You know, I spent a lot

of time not doing action ftlms be
cause I insist t
t ion" movies.!
(
andidenti his?
HI A little bit. Not much. You
know. I think it's always
to be aware of what's going o>: in
your environment. We're all
mi sept able to various forms of in
trusion, invasion. In today's world,
you gotta keep your eyes open.
Check your six. i*
INT: What part of the filmmaking
process do you find most reward
ing?
HF: i like the problem-solving as
pect of n as much as anything. 1
like figuring out what to do with
some degree of definition. I've al
ways said thait that is the hard part
of acting, tha| doing it is the easy
part. You just-dress up and play
like kids. Sol I'm from the "Lei's
pretend" school iof acting.
INT: What do you least like about
the whole process?
HF: I don't think there's & part of
filmmaking that I don't enjoy.
Q: Even this?
HF: No, this is not my favorite
part. I was confining myself to the
shooting aspect of it. No, I don't
enjoy this very much. It's just hard
to talk about yourself over and
over again and to remain truthful
and appropriate and focused on
what I've come here for. I've come
here to try to do the film some ad
vantage. I've come here to try to
take advantage of people's inter
est and perhaps stimulate them to
go and see the movie.
INT: Our school just started a new
film studies program. As someone
who has been in film for so long,
could you give them any pointers ji
or advice for a way to get into and
succeed in the film industry. Jig
HF: Those people that are serious
about i in esting themselves in a ca
reer, as an actor in films, or any
kind of person involved in films.

the one thing that I came to under
stand is that there is actually no
more competition for the genuine
ly good stuff than there is for the
shit tnere's not. There's more
people actually chasing the crap
than there are people who are
aware of what is good. So if you
«imply keep you eye on what the
good stuff is and be ambitious for
that. 1 think that may be the best
thing you can do for yourself.
Q: You've been recognized as the
sexiest man alive by "People" in
1997...
HF: And they're real experts.
Q: ...you were also in their list of 50
roost beautiful people in 1996,
number one in "Empire" maga
zine's 'Top 300 movie stars"...
HF: Nothing last year. That was a
long time ago.
Q: You've had all sorts of awards
recognitions. How does this affect
you career in general and your
outlook on your career?
HF:It has nothing to do with my
career. It has to do with the busi
ness of celebrity journalism, which
is a self-serving industry. I don't
consider being the sexiest man
alive praise and I don't consider it
part of my work, so its rubbish.
INT: Would you find that if there
wasn't this celebrity "machine"
that your career as an actor would
be more focused?
