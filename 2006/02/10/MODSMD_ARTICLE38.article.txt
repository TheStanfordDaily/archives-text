record opens with Cheese's rendition of Nirvana's
"Rape Me," complete with cheeky, upbeat swing
vocals. Kurt Cobain may be rolling in his grave,

but the Cheese's booming enthusiasm makes it
hilarious. His lounge versions of "Nookie" and

"Freak on a Leash" make 1999 nu-metal bear
able again, and his "Fight for Your Right" is just
as goofy as the Beastie Boys original. Still, after
18 songs, the lounge approach gets somewhat
tiresome. The gimmick works much
more effectively with the better-known songs.

makes you want to invite this guy to your wedding or something—
which of course, you can. His Web site implores Visitors to "Hire

and military gigs. Which of course, leads one to wonder what would
happen to a lounge singer crooning, "Rape Me" to a couple thou
sand troops on an aircraft carrier. Two words: not pretty.
For avid Cheese aficionados (Cheeseheads?), the collection
comes off as somewhat incomplete. Two of his best songs off
"Lounge Against the Machine," covers of System of a Down's

"Chop Suey" and Weezer's didn't

Nonetheless, the album is a great collection of
