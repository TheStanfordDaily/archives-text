### SEAN HOWELL INTERMISSION CLOUSEAU 
Inspector Jacques Clouseau, the

I bumbling detective that Steve Martin

I plays in the newest "Pink Panther" film,

I was first brought to life by Peter Sellers in the

I early 1960s. The "Panther" brand would not
have survived for over 40 years without Clouse

au. a send-up of the
suave Sherlock
Holmes types that
had previously
dominated Ameri
can detective cine
ma. While Holmes
pays close attention
to his surroundings,
taking in every de
tail to build a case
that lie will unravel
at the climax, the
super-sen o u s
Clouseau observes
the details of his
surroundings so
closely that he be
comes oblivious to
everything else

around him, stumbling over chairs, ignoring key
clues and generally causing more trouble than
the villains he chases. Sellers also perfected an
absurd French accent that provided the bulk of
the "Pink Panther" films' humor. For example,
one vintage Clouseau line is "Have you a li
cense for your minkey?"
Martin, with more gray hair than Sellers ever
had hut with the same ridiculous accent, has
adeptlv updated the character, adding a bit of
his own flair to the 10th "Panther" film (Sellers
appeared in six of them). Sellers' version was
more subtle —much of the humor in his films
sprung from the character's tendency to injure
himself, whereas Martin's Clouseau inadver
tently harms others (particularly bikers, for
some inexplicable reason). Martin's version
comes off as stupid, rather than sweetly igno
rant. He also plays the character with a conde
scending cockiness, taking the trait a step fur-

ther N
t ha n

Sellers'

unceasing

self-assurance.

But it is to Martin's

-credit that he sticks

with his Own brand of

humor. Along with eo- \
writer Len Blum. Martin made

some superficial tweaks to bring
the character into the 21st centu
ry—Clouseau takes Cialis and gets
hisjollies over the Internet—but the
silly jokes and ludicrous plot are
comfortingly similar.

Clouseau is summoned to Paris when the most
valuable diamond in the world, dubbed the
" Pink Panther." is stolen from the head coach of
the French National soccer team, who was
killed in the process. Parisian Chief Inspector
Dreyfus (Kevin Kline) hires Clouseau—the
"village idiot" from a nearby town —to solve the
case in order to set him up so that Dreyfus can
assemble a crack team of private investigators
and steal the glory when Clouseau fails (it
doesn't make any sense. 1 know, but for me
that's part of the movie's charm). Clouseau gets
a sidekick in this film. Gendarme Gilbert Pon
ton (Jean Reno), who winces at every one of
Clouseau's malapropisms and shoddy pieces of
detective work.
The case takes Clouseau to New York,
where he hunts down, and almost has a fling
with, the French coach's former girlfriend, pop
star Xania (played by a predictably flat Bey-

once

Knowles).

Clouseau also

develops an ob

session with ham

burgers. and his inabili- \
ty to pronounce this word

plays a central role in the plot.

Just as the previous "Pan

ther" films served as mere vehicles

for Sellers' comic genius, this version

gets pretty thin and fomnilaic outside of

Martin's masterful touch. The plot doesn't

matter, but it never has. The brand of humor
that Sellers mastered with Clouseau has come
down to us in the overly serious, totally oblivi
ous characters perfected by Will Ferrell. Owen
Wilson. Ben Stiller and co. This film is as much
a capitalization on that trend as a re-packaging
of Sellers' original brilliance. As a result, the
character feels more familiar to us than it might
have to its original audience. Fortunately. Ban
