# CALIFORNIA 65, STANFORD 62
## Powe-rful: 32 points lead Bears, Hernandez human after all Powe's last-second strip of Hernandez dooms Cardinal 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
BERKELEY, Calif. â€”Trailing by three
in the final seconds of last night's game
against Cal. Stanford knew who it wanted
to take the final shot. The only problem
was the Bears knew it too. and senior
guard Chris Hernandez couldn't find any
space in the Cal defense to get that final
shot oft
Fittingly, it was the Bears' forward Leon
Powe who knocked the ball away from
Hernandez. Powe dominated the game,
notching a career-high 32 points and nine
rebounds on the way to a 65-62 win over
the Cardinal (12-8,8-4 Pac 10) that moves
the Bears (15-6,9-3) into sole possession of
second place in the Pac-10.
Powe was hot out of the gate, scoring 11
of the Bears' first fourteen points. Stanford
could find no answer to the 6-foot-8 sopho
more. who continually found himself open
down low for easy baskets.
"He's a good player," Stanford head
coach Trent Johnson said. "We knew that.
He's a handful, like he's been all year.
Tonight he had an exceptional night. 1 have
to believe that this was his best game all
year offensively and they needed that."
Hernandez, who was the hero in Stan
ford's wins against Washington and Ore
gon, took the ball with ten seconds left and
the Cardinal down by three. He sprinted
the length of the court before running into
a trio of Cal defenders. Powe poked the ball
away, the Bears' Eric Vierneisel picked it
up and the game was over.
"I was trying to get a three up, I got
doubled or tripled and I saw Matt open
for a three," Hernandez said. "1 tried to
get it to him and I just couldn't make the
play. I'm not going to blame it on whatev
er happened, I just couldn't make the
play."
The failed final play was a tough end to
a game that saw the Cardinal cut an 11-
point second half deficit to just one in the
final minute. After leading 27-25 at half
time, Cal opened the second period with a
12-4 run, fueled by a five-point series when
sophomore forward Taj Finger was whis
tled for a technical foul for hanging on the
rim following a dunk.
