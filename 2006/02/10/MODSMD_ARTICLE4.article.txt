# CALIFORNIA 65, STANFORD 62
## Powe-rful: 32 points lead Bears, Hernandez human after all Powe's last-second strip of Hernandez dooms Cardinal 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
BERKELEY, Calif. —Trailing by three
in the final seconds of last night's game
against Cal. Stanford knew who it wanted
to take the final shot. The only problem
was the Bears knew it too. and senior
guard Chris Hernandez couldn't find any
space in the Cal defense to get that final
shot oft
Fittingly, it was the Bears' forward Leon
Powe who knocked the ball away from
Hernandez. Powe dominated the game,
notching a career-high 32 points and nine
rebounds on the way to a 65-62 win over
the Cardinal (12-8,8-4 Pac 10) that moves
the Bears (15-6,9-3) into sole possession of
second place in the Pac-10.
Powe was hot out of the gate, scoring 11
of the Bears' first fourteen points. Stanford
could find no answer to the 6-foot-8 sopho
more. who continually found himself open
down low for easy baskets.
"He's a good player," Stanford head
coach Trent Johnson said. "We knew that.
He's a handful, like he's been all year.
Tonight he had an exceptional night. 1 have
to believe that this was his best game all
year offensively and they needed that."
Hernandez, who was the hero in Stan
ford's wins against Washington and Ore
gon, took the ball with ten seconds left and
the Cardinal down by three. He sprinted
the length of the court before running into
a trio of Cal defenders. Powe poked the ball
away, the Bears' Eric Vierneisel picked it
up and the game was over.
"I was trying to get a three up, I got
doubled or tripled and I saw Matt open
for a three," Hernandez said. "1 tried to
get it to him and I just couldn't make the
play. I'm not going to blame it on whatev
er happened, I just couldn't make the
play."
The failed final play was a tough end to
a game that saw the Cardinal cut an 11-
point second half deficit to just one in the
final minute. After leading 27-25 at half
time, Cal opened the second period with a
12-4 run, fueled by a five-point series when
sophomore forward Taj Finger was whis
tled for a technical foul for hanging on the
rim following a dunk.

Cal forward Leon Powe dunks over senior forward Matt Haryasz. Despite vision problems, and
playing only seven first-half minutes after picking up two fouls, Haryasz led the Card with 18.
The call proved to swing the momentum Cal's
way after guard Ayinde Übaka made both free
throws and hit a deep three pointer on the ensuing
possession — all on his 21st birthday.
When asked about the technical against Finger,
an emotional Johnson bit his tongue, remaining
silent for ten seconds before changing the topic.
Übaka shot just 4-of-14, but made a series of
critical free throws to finish the game with 18
points. With the Cardinal surging, Übaka hit four
free throws on one-and-one opportunities in the
final 24 seconds.
Good free throw shooting carried the Bears
down the stretch, who shot just 1 l-of-24 from the
charity stripe in their Jan. 13 75-61 loss at Stanford.
Last night, Cal shot 23-of-28, but most notably
Powe, a 69.5 percent free-throw shooter on the
season, made 12-of-l5 freebies.
Senior forward Matt Haryasz did his part to
help the Cardinal cause in the final minutes,drain
ing a three-pointer with 16 seconds left to bring
Stanford within one point, 63-62. Haryasz made
the decision to play just hours before tip-off. after
being hit in the eye in last weekend's win over
Oregon State.
"I thought Matt was very courageous today,"
Johnson said. "He didn't practice all week and he
didn't participate in shoot-around for more than
15 minutes, but he came in and gave us a lift."
Haryasz didn't make the start and played limit
ed minutes in the first half due to two early fouls,
but did start the second. He played the entirety of
the game wearing goggles, and had difficulty judg
ing the depth off longer-range shots.
"There were a couple times when 1 thought my
shot was off and it went in, so the basket wasn't ex
actly where 1 thought it was," said Haryasz, who
finished with 18 points and seven rebounds in 27
minutes."! got some lucky bounces I guess."
Both teams opened the game slowly, with nei
ther team building more than a four point lead in
the first half. Despite struggling to establish trac
tion early on, Cal played mistake-free from the
start, finishing with a season-low four turnovers.
Meanwhile, senior guard Dan Grunfeld fin
ished just 2-of-6 from the field and watched the
game's final minutes from the bench after visibly

slowing — and limping — from a torn ACL in his
right knee suffered against Cal last season.
Grunfeld's poor shooting reflected a wider
trend for the Card.
"Early on we had a lot of open shots and they
just weren't falling," Johnson said. "Again, we're
not taking anything away from Cal. Their athleti
cism allows them to stretch you defensively, but
we had a lot of things going for us offensively early
on and shots just weren't going down."
The win marked the first time that the Bears
hud beaten the Cardinal in seven tries, a streak

dating back to 20()3. Following the Bears' first sell
out since an undefeated Josh Childress-led Cardi
nal squad visited Haas Pavilion in 2004, Cal stu
dents stormed the court.
That will be a memory that the Cardinal will
have to erase from their minds as they head to
Spokane to take on No. 5 Gonzaga on Saturday, in

game.
"We go over this every week," Hernandez said.
"Every game is a must win — there are no gim

BERKELEY, Calif. —Trailing by three
in the final seconds of last night's game
against Cal. Stanford knew who it wanted
to take the final shot. The only problem
was the Bears knew it too. and senior
guard Chris Hernandez couldn't find any
space in the Cal defense to get that final
shot oft
Fittingly, it was the Bears' forward Leon
Powe who knocked the ball away from
Hernandez. Powe dominated the game,
notching a career-high 32 points and nine
rebounds on the way to a 65-62 win over
the Cardinal (12-8,8-4 Pac 10) that moves
the Bears (15-6,9-3) into sole possession of
second place in the Pac-10.
Powe was hot out of the gate, scoring 11
of the Bears' first fourteen points. Stanford
could find no answer to the 6-foot-8 sopho
more. who continually found himself open
down low for easy baskets.
"He's a good player," Stanford head
coach Trent Johnson said. "We knew that.
He's a handful, like he's been all year.
Tonight he had an exceptional night. 1 have
to believe that this was his best game all
year offensively and they needed that."
Hernandez, who was the hero in Stan
ford's wins against Washington and Ore
gon, took the ball with ten seconds left and
the Cardinal down by three. He sprinted
the length of the court before running into
a trio of Cal defenders. Powe poked the ball
away, the Bears' Eric Vierneisel picked it
up and the game was over.
"I was trying to get a three up, I got
doubled or tripled and I saw Matt open
for a three," Hernandez said. "1 tried to
get it to him and I just couldn't make the
play. I'm not going to blame it on whatev
er happened, I just couldn't make the
play."
The failed final play was a tough end to
a game that saw the Cardinal cut an 11-
point second half deficit to just one in the
final minute. After leading 27-25 at half
time, Cal opened the second period with a
12-4 run, fueled by a five-point series when
sophomore forward Taj Finger was whis
tled for a technical foul for hanging on the
rim following a dunk.

Cal forward Leon Powe dunks over senior forward Matt Haryasz. Despite vision problems, and
playing only seven first-half minutes after picking up two fouls, Haryasz led the Card with 18.
The call proved to swing the momentum Cal's
way after guard Ayinde Übaka made both free
throws and hit a deep three pointer on the ensuing
possession — all on his 21st birthday.
When asked about the technical against Finger,
an emotional Johnson bit his tongue, remaining
silent for ten seconds before changing the topic.
Übaka shot just 4-of-14, but made a series of
critical free throws to finish the game with 18
points. With the Cardinal surging, Übaka hit four
free throws on one-and-one opportunities in the
final 24 seconds.
Good free throw shooting carried the Bears
down the stretch, who shot just 1 l-of-24 from the
charity stripe in their Jan. 13 75-61 loss at Stanford.
Last night, Cal shot 23-of-28, but most notably
Powe, a 69.5 percent free-throw shooter on the
season, made 12-of-l5 freebies.
Senior forward Matt Haryasz did his part to
help the Cardinal cause in the final minutes,drain
ing a three-pointer with 16 seconds left to bring
Stanford within one point, 63-62. Haryasz made
the decision to play just hours before tip-off. after
being hit in the eye in last weekend's win over
Oregon State.
"I thought Matt was very courageous today,"
Johnson said. "He didn't practice all week and he
didn't participate in shoot-around for more than
15 minutes, but he came in and gave us a lift."
Haryasz didn't make the start and played limit
ed minutes in the first half due to two early fouls,
but did start the second. He played the entirety of
the game wearing goggles, and had difficulty judg
ing the depth off longer-range shots.
"There were a couple times when 1 thought my
shot was off and it went in, so the basket wasn't ex
actly where 1 thought it was," said Haryasz, who
finished with 18 points and seven rebounds in 27
minutes."! got some lucky bounces I guess."
Both teams opened the game slowly, with nei
ther team building more than a four point lead in
the first half. Despite struggling to establish trac
tion early on, Cal played mistake-free from the
start, finishing with a season-low four turnovers.
Meanwhile, senior guard Dan Grunfeld fin
ished just 2-of-6 from the field and watched the
game's final minutes from the bench after visibly

slowing — and limping — from a torn ACL in his
right knee suffered against Cal last season.
Grunfeld's poor shooting reflected a wider
trend for the Card.
"Early on we had a lot of open shots and they
just weren't falling," Johnson said. "Again, we're
not taking anything away from Cal. Their athleti
cism allows them to stretch you defensively, but
we had a lot of things going for us offensively early
on and shots just weren't going down."
The win marked the first time that the Bears
