### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION SEX GODDESS 
So just how does Darwin's theory on the sur
vival of the fittest relate to sex at Stanford? I
think the answer should be obvious, but in i

case those Irish Car Bombs from the week
end got to your head, then I'll just let you in

— c ✓ * "
on the secret. The fittest—*ahem* sexiest —
get laid the most, which means that their
genes are the ones that will survive, and
not the genes of the creepy I HUM guy that
just won't leave you alone.

'But Roxy" you say, "I see plenty of ugly
people getting it on." In which case, Roxy has to

i 1 *-> *
say, "It's true my dear, even ugly people need lovin',
but hopefully you won't be drunk (or desperate)
enough to lower your standards. Does this sound
shallow to you? Well so be it, but it's been my expe-

rience that the prettier people are just better in bed.
They're the ones that'll have rough and tumble, up
against a wall, throw-me-down sex... sorry Roxy's
reminiscing about the weekend again. The point is,
you can't always settle, I mean the survival of hot
ness depends on it.
So how do you avoid these people? Well lucky
for you, Roxy has composed a list of undesirables.
These are the people you want to avoid at all costs
in order to keep the gene pool clean and pretty:
1) That Fugly girl/ guy- This one should be obvious.
They're the ones that look unappealing even with

your beer goggles on. No amount

of makeup can save this one.
t 2) The creepy stalker-sure.

they may seem nice when
they first talk to you, in

fact, they're not that bad
i looking, so you give them
a dance. However, when
' you try to move on, you
realize this person is

madly in love with you al
ready and wants to have

your babies. Roxy's ad
vice: run as fast as you
k can!
» 3) The awkward loner- j

this one should not, I repeat SHOULD NOT be J
confused with the tall, dark, mysterious type (thatf
one's a keeper). So how do you recognize this one?
Well, a tell-tale sign is if

you ask them to dance,
and they get positively
giddy, the mysterious
person would never act
giddy. The awkward
loner will probably also
ask you to his room to
discuss "world peace."
Unfortunately, he will
actually mean world
peace.

4) The belligerent drunk
is another big no. For one
thing, if he's drunk
enough to be belligerent,
then he'll probably be
drunk enough to force
you to do things you
wouldn't do. Violent
people are never ok. For
another thing, drunken
sex is clumsy and awk
ward, which is never fun.

5) The player/ the slut is next on my list. But Roxy
you ask, he's jusl so hot! NO! Promiscuous people
are a big for a one-time thing, just to
say you've conquered the mountain and didn't like
it, but don't be a fool, wrap your tool. Seriously
though, yoifdlpo't want the town bicycle, it's never
nice to(»y that's my girlfriend and she's
slfcrtuflittl my best friend, both my brothers and my
.>)Thehc jillerer- "Who exactly is the hollerer?" you
Well, this ii the gift that leans against a wall
group of |is friVds, and calls you baby and
jjlfafrjnarna and then sends his friend to tell you that
he tfiiijjks VOUdj& hot because he doesn't have the
«td do this himself. What is this, middle school?
No. sorry people but Roxy doesn't do anybody with
maturity level of a twelve year old.
7) The dance floor molester-this guy/ girl is to be
avoided completely. You pan spot them because
even never met them, they'll try to
feel you up (and more!) during your first dance to
gether. Now Roxy's as much a fan of PDA as the
next person, but going (bsecond in public is not ok.
I don't care how drunk or horny you are.
So there ypu have it. th> top seven people to avoid
at all costs* Now go out theit, grab that net, and
catch that beautiful butterfly! Your kids will thank
you for the fact that they're not horribly disfigured!
Go make Darwin proud and make evolution hap
pen!
