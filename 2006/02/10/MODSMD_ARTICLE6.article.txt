## Captive journalist appeals for help 
### QASSIM ABDUL-ZAHRA ASSOCIATED PRESS 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) â€” Kidnapped American
journalist Jill Carroll appeared in a video aired Thursday
on a private Kuwaiti lV station, appealing in a calm,
composed voice for her supporters to do whatever it
takes to win her release "as quickly as possible."
Carroll, wearing traditional Arab attire, said the date
was Feb. 2, nearly a month after she was seized in Bagh
dad by armed men who killed her Iraqi translator. She
was shown sitting on a chair in front of a wall with a large
floral design.
The 28-year-old freelance reporter for The Christ
ian Science Monitor said she had sent one letter and
was sending another to "prove I am with the muja
hedeen."
"I sent you a letter written by my hand, but you want
ed more evidence," she said. "I am here. I am fine. Please
just do whatever they want, give them whatever they
want as quickly as possible. There is very short time.
Please do it fast. That's all."
The 22-second video was carried by A 1 Rai TV, a pri
vate Kuwaiti channel, and included audio, unlike two
previous videos of Carroll that were broadcast by Al-
Jazeera television.
The tape was delivered earlier Thursday to A 1 Rai's
Baghdad office and was aired in its entirety, Hani al-
Srougi, an editor at the station's headquarters in Kuwait,
told The Associated Press. It was accompanied by a letter
written by Carroll.
The newscaster said on the air that the station would
hand the letter over to authorities, but would not disclose
the letter's content.
Tania Anderson, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Em
bassy in Kuwait, said: "I assume that A 1 Rai has given the
material they received to the Kuwaiti authorities, who 1
am confident will take the appropriate action at the ear
liest possible time. The embassy customarily works close
ly with our contacts with the Kuwaiti government and
will seek their cooperation on this matter as well."
The Christian Science Monitor said it was seeking
more information about the letter.
"It is always difficult to see someone speaking under
coercion and under these circumstances," the Monitor's
editor, Richard Bergenheim,said in a statement. "We re
main in constant contact with Jill's family and are still
doing everything possible to obtain Jill's release."

A producer at Al-Jazeera said the station had not re
ceived any letters with the videos it aired.
On Jan. 30, Al-Jazeera showed Carroll veiled and
weeping, and the station said she appealed for the release
of female Iraqi prisoners. The first videotape of Carroll
was aired Jan. 17 by Al-Jazeera, which said her abductors
gave the United States 72 hours to free female prisoners
in Iraq or she would be killed.
Earlier Thursday, an Iraqi deputy justice minister said
U.S. forces are expected to release about 450 male Iraqi
detainees on Feb. 16. None of the four or five women be
lieved to be in custody is expected to be freed, Busho
Ibrahim Ali told the AP.
Reporters Without Borders urged Arab media and
Muslim dignitaries to intervene on Carroll's behalf.
"We remind Carroll's kidnappers that she is a journal
ist who has just done her job, which is to describe the con
ditions in which Iraqis are living," the media organization
said. "She is not responsible for the U.S. government's
decisions."
After Thursday's broadcast. Carroll's family issued a
brief statement through the Monitor, saying only that

"the family is hopeful and grateful to all those working
on Jill's behalf."
Armed men abducted Carroll on Jan. 7 in western
Baghdad. Responsibility was claimed by the previously
unknown "Revenge Brigades." Five foreigners were kid
napped in Iraq last month, including Carroll, two Ger
mans and two Kenyan engineers.
U.S. officials have refused to discuss Carroll's kidnap
ping for fear of endangering her life.
However,some Iraqi and foreign security officials not
directly involved in the case believe that in virtually all
kidnappings, ransom money is the main goal and kidnap
pers present political or other demands to justify the act
to their supporters.
It was not known why Carroll's captors sent the lat
est video to Kuwait's A 1 Rai or whether Al-Jazeera's de
cision not to air the previous videos' audio was a factor.
Observers believe Al-Jazeera has been a favorite of mil
itants for their messages because of its scope. Both A 1
Rai and Al-Jazeera are satellite stations available
across the region, but Al-Jazeera is far more widely
watched.
