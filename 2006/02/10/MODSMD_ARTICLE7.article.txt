WASHINGTON (AP) — A band of Senate Repub
lican holdouts reached agreement Thursday with the
White House on changes in the Patriot Act designed to
clear the way for passage of anti-terror legislation
stalled in a dispute over civil liberties.
Sen. John Sununu, R-N.H. said the changes, quickly
endorsed by at least two Democrats, would better "pro
tect civil liberties even as we give law enforcement im
portant tools to conduct terrorism investigations."
The White House embraced the deal even before Su
nunu and a few other senators outlined it.
Presidential spokesman Scott McClellan said the
agreement would "continue to build upon the civil liber
ties protections that are in place but do so in a way that
doesn't compromise our national security priorities."
"We're pleased that this important legislation is
moving forward," he said.
The compromise focused on three areas:
— Giving recipients of court-approved subpoenas for
information in terrorist investigations the right to chal
lenge a requirement that they refrain from telling anyone.
— Eliminating a requirement that an individual
provide the FBI with the name of a lawyer consulted
about a National Security Letter, which is a demand for
records issued by investigators.
— Clarifying that most libraries are not subject to
demands in those letters for information about suspect
ed terrorists.
While there was no immediate reaction from House
Republicans, Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, one of the Sen
ate negotiators, said House Judiciary Committee Chair
man James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis. had been kept ap
prised of the negotiations. Craig said that with the Sen
ate and the White House now in concert, "there will be
no additional negotiations" with the House.
Reaction from Democrats was divided.
Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, second-ranking in the
Democratic leadership, appeared at the GOP news con
ference. He said the compromise included "significant
progress" toward protecting basic liberties and that he
planned to support it.
The party's leader. Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, said
in a statement that the agreement among Republicans
"appears to be a step in the right direction."
Sen. Russell Feingold.D-Wis., threatened a filibuster.
