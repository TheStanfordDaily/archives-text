There are three things you need
to know about Pluto's. First
and foremost, you can eat well
there for $5. Second, Pluto's is locat
ed within easy hiking and moderate
ly ambitious walking distance from
campus. So. if you're hungry and
broke, tired of dorm food and with
out a car — which probably means a
lot of you — you're in luck!
The third thing you need to know
about Pluto's is how to order, which
due to their unique setup- can be
very confusing. After walking
through the restaurant door, you're
bound to encounter a busy, loud
scene of chatting diners — many of
them Stanford students — and a
counter area staffed by Pluto's em
ployees at the back of the room. You
may be confused by the restaurant's
random intergalactic theme, embod
ied by curvy tables — perhaps curvy
is synonymous with space — and a
list of astronauts printed across one
wall. I have no information that can
banish this confusion. However, I
can provide information to abet
your second worry, namely,"How do
I order?"
Sophomore Mishan Araujo has
been to Pluto's several times before
and still describes the ordering
process as "scary." Although 1
wouldn't go so far as to call it fright
ening, Pluto's ordering procedures
do require some explanation. But
you'll have nothing to fear if you
simply follow these guidelines:
1. If you don't want a salad and in
stead want a sandwich, soup or side,
go to the cash register to order. This
rule is a moot point because you
should want salad — see rule two.
2. If you want a salad — which
you do, because it is by far the best
reason to go to Pluto's — grab one
of the little menus they have on the
counter and bring it up to one of the
employees by the salad bar. Tell
them whether you want a small or a
large and whether you want Caesar
(romaine lettuce) or Farmer's
Greens (field greens). Small salads
are big enough for a meal if you
aren't a big eater, while the large sal
ads are ample. The employee will
punch your menu to mark your se
lection and hand it back to you.
3. Now comes the fun part. Select
up to seven "fixins" for the staff to
add to your salad. Your choices in
clude tomatoes, carrots, apples, jici
ma, mushrooms, red peppers, egg
plant, broccoli, raisins, beets, sun
flower seeds and more. You can dou
ble up on a single item if you, say,
can't get enough carrots. If you're
me, you double up on the candied
walnuts.They're delicious. Stay away
from the green beans, though,
they're a little too tough and have a
strong taste.
I also recommend sticking with a
vegetarian salad. You can add grilled
chicken or steak to your salad for a
dollar extra, but one of my friends
observed that the Pluto's chicken
tastes a bit too much like tuna. An
other friend ordered the steak and it
was undercooked. The fresh and de
licious veggies are a safe, sure bet
4. Pick a dressing. The balsamic
vinaigrette is a great choice.
5. Now go up to the register and
present your punched menu to the
cashier. Order a drink, side or
dessert if you so desire.
6. Pay for your very reasonably
priced meal.
7. Grab one of the glasses of ice
from the counter and get water from
the faucet behind the register. Also
pick up napkins and forks.
8. Pick a table and enjoy your
meal. But don't worry, you don't
have to bus your dishes.
So, there you have it. A guide to
enjoying a fresh, healthy meal close
to campus for a great price. Pluto's is
a great option to have for a quick no
frills meal. If you stick to what you
know is good, Pluto's delivers every
time. Did I mention the great price?
