# Smoky Desires
## Get The Hookah UP AT Several Local Lounges

112 "IF \he ancient art of smoking sweet tobacco
through a hookah — or water pipe — traces its
roots to India by way of the Middle East.Today
hookah smoking enjoys worldwide popularity,
-JL- and cities like Rome and Los Angeles boast
lavish hookah dens that glitter with beads and braziers and
command waiting lists for low tables ensconced as marital
bowers.
In the greater Stanford neighborhood, you have a choice
between hookah in a silk tent and hookah without the Ori
entalism. A small handful of lounges between San Jose and
San Francisco cater to a local population of hookah aficiona
dos growing in number and connoisseurship.
Your closest options are also your least opulent. Small
venues distill the experience to its essence — the opportuni
ty to savor fruit-scented tobacco in the company of friends.
"It has its own aura," explains Emad Ibrahim, manager
and owner of Off the Hookah in Sunnyvale. "It's part of the
culture, and it's part of social gathering."
Off the Hookah opened two years ago as an annex to
Ibrahim's Dishdash restaurant on Murphy Avenue. Six
nights a week, the lounge offers diners a chance to unwind in
a muted space with one of 30 flavors of tobacco, ranging
from the traditional honey, mint or apple to Napa Grape and
Wacky Watermelon. Some are served with pieces of fruit
roasting atop the pipe, and a short menu of shawarmas and
baklava tempts patrons.
Ibrahim recommends the lemon-mint tobacco and sug
gests pairing the hookah with Turkish coffee, mint tea or one
of several Armenian, Lebanese and Turkish ales. At his es-

tablishment, a hookah
costs between $13 and $20,
can be shared by two peo
ple and must be smoked
through a disposable
mouthpiece. The water
pipes are sterilized after
each use.
On Fridays and Satur
days, the lounge becomes a
club with a DJ. $10 cover
and required reservations.
But on weeknights a much
more subdued atmosphere
invites quiet gatherings.
"Hookah bars can be
laid back," said sophomore
Anne Marie Barrette, who
enjoys the weeknight calm
at Off the Hookah. "It's
usually a pretty casual ex
perience."

Kan Zaman, the San Francisco hotspot, is by all measures a
more elaborate affair.
"Kan Zaman is an extremely stylish venue," senior Sudeep Roy
attests. "They have great drinks and fantastic Arabic music."
The Haight Street lounge also features belly dancers on certain
nights of the week, but Roy — who is from Italy — says that
American hookah bars are generally less heavy-handed about ex
oticizing the Middle East.
"1 think this might be because in Europe. Arab people feel the
need to sell their exotic identity to attract the locals to their bars."
he explains. "Here, because of the diversity that already exists,
there might not be that same need."
Roy and his friends also enjoy Tarboosh, a hookah lounge in
Redwood City with a live Arabic singer, as well as the Hookah
Nites Cafe in San Jose.

aura. It's part of the
culture, and it's part of the

Despite wide
spread and growing pop
ularity, hookah bars are

beginning to meet with
considerable opposition from

the anti-smoking lobby. Though
water pipes may filter out some oi
the tar in tobacco smoke, hookah
smoke in particular has been shown
to contain nicotine and carcinogens,
and a 45-minute session may be the
equivalent of smoking between two
and 15 cigarettes. The American
Cancer Society links hookah smok
ing to several types of cancer and pe
riodontal disease.
For many, moderate con
sumption tempers the risk.
"It's not very bad for your

health," says sophomore Nada
Boutros, who hails from Dubai. "You don't usually smoke the en
tire hookah, and you usually share it as well."
In California, hookah lounges are similar to cigar bars and to
bacconists in the eyes of the law, and are restricted to patrons older
than 18.
Hookah, at least for the time being, has a social mystique unlike
that of marijuana or cigarettes, as it's neither psychoactive nor
proven to be habit-forming. As such, it's a moralized kind of smok
ing, a fact which may account for much of its popularity.
"If you smoke hookah, you're not a smoker," Ibrahim says."It
has a social ambiance."
"I think it can serve as a good alternative to drinking excessive
ly," Roy says, noting that although he feels a "temporary buzz"
after smoking a hookah, driving home is never a problem. "More
than going to smoke the hookah, I go to enjoy the company of
friends, the music and the general atmosphere."
