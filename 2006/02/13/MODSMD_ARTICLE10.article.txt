### MARISSA KLEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
No actor or audience member will be
able to hide from the power of the
enormous castle that will be built
nightly on the stage of Memorial Auditori
um, while scenes of violence, sex and disas
ter play themselves out in its wake. This is
all part of "The Castle," a provocative and
disturbing drama by British playwright
Howard Barker. Students from the Stan
ford Drama Department will be perform
ing Barker's work from Wednesday, Feb.
15 to Saturday, Feb. 18.
" The Castle" centers on the story of an
English knight who returns after seven
years of fighting in the Crusades to find
that in his absence, his town's women have
established a godless, Utopian community.
To reinstate his authority, he begins to
build a massive castle that takes on a life of
its own as it grows and leads to great chaos.
"It's about passions taken to the ex
treme in this world where logic breaks
down," says Director Daniel Sack, a
third-year graduate student in Drama.
"It's like a new type of tragedy, where po
litical and social rules fall apart so we
can't quite tell who is the protagonist and
who is the enemy."
Written in 1985 at the height of Rea

gan-Thatcher strategic defense, the play is
pertinent today since it reflects power
struggles and tensions between the East
and West in terms of gender roles, Chris
tianity and moral law.
"ITiis play is very important right now
because we're in a situation where we are
maybe living within a society out of our
control," Sack says. "We hear this talk of
security as a vital issue in our everyday life,
and it's curtailing our everyday freedoms
in the name of freedom. The play refer
ences the Crusades and other wars fought
on the ideals of this great civilization, and
it's a warning to us all of what the ramifica
tions could be if taken to an extreme."
"The Castle" is the only Drama De
partment production that will take place
in Memorial Auditorium this year, as the
space effectively accommodates the large
set. But audience seating will be on the
stage itself. This will create an intimate,
125-seat space in which the actors' and au
dience's interactions with the castle will
be even more imposing. This is the first
time that "The Castle" will be performed
in such a large space, according to Sack. It
is also the first time the Stanford Drama
Department has attempted such a techni
cal feat.
"The central core of the play is this
castle that's built on stage that asserts

this force or will on the characters as it
grows and affects everybody in the play,"
Sack explains. "So we really wanted to
create a set in the world of the play that
exemplified that or affected the audience
as well as the characters. The juxtaposi
tion of big things in small places over
whelms the audience."
Performing disturbing material in close
proximity to the audience on a set that is
constantly changing has proved challeng
ing for the actors, who have been rehears
ing five or six times a week since January.
"It's a very physical play,and it's a lot of
work to get into a place with my body that
I don't go to often," says Laurel Scotland-
Stewart, a sixth-year philosophy graduate
student who is on the cast."The characters
are all larger than life. Coming up with
new things to do and ways to play around
with it and push it to the limit of what can
be portrayed onstage is a challenge."
Since the audience is seated on the
stage, they will witness theatrical elements
that normally remain hidden and will be
thrust into the world of the play.
"Because we're on the stage, we don't
try to hide anything from the audience —
we make the apparatus visible," Sack says.
"And that I think actually heightens the
sense of awe — when something happens
you see what happens but it still is over

whelming."
Sack stresses that this is not a play for
children, and that the audience can expect
their beliefs and perceptions to be contest
ed.
"It's definitely an anti-war play," he
says."lt's iconoclastic and interrogates ab
stract moral words like truth, faith and
marriage that are keystones to our current
political thought and discussion."
ITie actors and production team know
that offended audience members may
walk out of performances, but they hope
that whatever viewers may think about
the play, they will be affected by the mate
rial.
"The play is about how different char
acters react to the struggle for material
and social power, so these issues are in
creasingly relevant in international poli
tics and social interactions," says Jillian
Keenan. a sophomore who is in the play.
"So I hope the script's political and social
messages give the audience something to
think about."
All performances of "The Castle"
begin at S p.m., with an additional late
night show on Thursday, Feb. 17 at 11:30
p.m. Tickets can be purchased at the door
or may be reserved in advance by calling
