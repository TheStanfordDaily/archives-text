### PAMELA SUD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's Haas Center for Public Service sponsors a
number of summer and postgraduate fellowships for Stan
ford students who plan to work in public service. Some of
the application deadlines for this year have passed, but the
application process for others is still open. Check out the
Haas Center Web site if you're interested in applying:
http://haas.stanford.edu. Here are profiles of two students
who currently hold the Haas Summer Fellowship and the
Philanthropy Fellowship.

This fellowship gives students
a chance to develop service projects for
communities, both in the United States
and abroad. Recipients receive a
$4.(XX) stipend to fund their project for
nine weeks, and between 15 and 20 stu
dents get the fellowship each year.
There are two rounds of applications, and one is still open
— the deadline is Apr. 12,2006. Both undergraduates and
graduate students can apply for this round.
McCartney, a junior and a native of Desert Hot
Springs. Calif., implemented her self-designed project of

creating a Web-based program to provide students at her
high school with information to help increase their
chances of going to college.
"I wanted to help students struggling with the same chal
lenges I had once faced as a first generation college bound
high school student pursuing a higher education myself,"
McCartney says. Her program, Scholar Script.com, pro
vides information on advanced placement and honors class
es, extracurricular activities, community service hours, fi
nancial aid information and more to high school students
preparing for the college application process.
"Thoughout the summer I worked with administrators,
guidance counselors and teachers at my alma mater —
Desert Hot Springs High School — toset up classroom visits,
host a parent information night, make presentations at facul
ty meetings and develop a plan for implementing the site into
the classroom curricula," McCartney explains. This summer
she hopes to expand the Web site to other high schools in the
desert area and Palm Springs Unified School District.
In her free time, McCartney enjoys tutoring for the East
Palo Alto Stanford Academy and Upward Bound. She is
also a sister in Sigma Theta Psi Multicultural Sorority, Inc.
Allison Woo
Philanthropy Fellowship
This is a 10-week, full-time summer program for stu
dents to work at a Bay Area public service organization.
While undergraduates are given preference for the fellow

ship, graduating seniors, co-term students and graduate
students are also allowed to apply. Six to 10 students re
ceive the award each year and get a $4,500 stipend for their

work.'lTie deadline for this year's fel
lowship was Feb. 8.
Woo is a senior human biology
major, and she is also co-terminal stu
dent in sociology. Through the Philan
thropy Fellowship program, she was
placed at the Kaiser Family Foundation
in Menlo Park.
"I wanted to learn about how
philanthropy intersects with public
policy," Woo explains. She spent the

summer editing publications, writing policy briefs and co
authoring fact sheets on health policy.
"I feel that my projects were really meaningful to my
self and the Foundation's audience of policymakers, aca
demics and the public," she adds.
Haas philanthropy fellows meet throughout the sum
mer to share experiences and even tour other's workplaces.
"It was exciting to learn about how many different
models and types of foundations exist, and to hear about
the projects that their foundations support." Woo says.
She says she found Kaiser Family Foundation's insights
on health policy and philanthropy particularly valuable as
a graduating senior who is eager to start her own career in
public service.
