## Editorial Iran's nuclear program poses real threat to peace 
### 
On October 7 2004, amid the bashings
and lashings that define any presiden
tial debate. President George Bush
and President-hopeful John Kerry were at the
very least able to agree on one thing: The
biggest threat to the world and to America
was nuclear proliferation.
Today, another State of the Union into the
President's second administration, it appears
that this nuclear threat is graver than it was a
year ago. North Korea's nuclear brinksman
ship notwithstanding, the world now faces a
unique and serious challenge to the nuclear
nonproliferation regime in Iran. It is ab
solutely crucial that the global community re
main resolutely vigilant and take serious
steps toward persuading Tehran to reverse its
nuclear path.
The authoritarian theocracy in Iran, of
course, denies that the nation is considering
building nuclear weapons at all.They declare
that it is their sovereign right guaranteed
under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
(NPT) to pursue all avenues of peaceful nu
clear research. And they're right. But Iran
has admitted to misleading the rest of the
world in the past when nuclear facilities were
discovered in Natanz and Arak. With good
reason, then, many people are skeptical when
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
claims that Iran is removing UN seals at its
uranium-enriching facility in Natanz or de
nies inspectors from the International Atom
ic Energy Agency (lAEA) unobstructed ac
cess to these same facilities in order to pursue
a peaceful nuclear programme. There is little
doubt that Iran wants the bomb, and will get
it if left undeterred.
However, the challenge in sidestepping
nuclear Armageddon does not lie with Re
alpolitik considerations but rather with the
double standards of international justice.
There is no doubt that U.S. hegemony in the
nuclear arena offends many less influential
nations, and there is a definite schism be
tween NPT haves and have-nots. The Unit
ed States is often mired in accusations of
hypocrisy because we have enough
weapons to destroy the world several times
over. Several countries—most notably Is
rael—have also divested themselves of their
NPT obligations, essentially damaging the
vitality of the document. In a sense, Tehran
has a case: If Israel, its avowed enemy, is al
lowed to have an arsenal of nukes in viola
tion of the nonproliferation regime, isn't
Iran being unfairly targeted and subjected
to international hypocrisy?
Still, when it comes to nuclear Armaged
don, the stakes are high. The costs of a nu

clear Iran will be in terms of aggression be
tween Israel and Iran or nuclear prolifera
tion in an already unstable Middle East.
These are not costs that the world can afford.
The clear solution to this situation is for
Tehran to accept the Russian proposal, in
which Russia would ferry enriched uranium
to Iran. This would eliminate the need for a
full fuel cycle in Iranian nuclear facilities,
while allowing Iran to fulfill any peaceful nu
clear ambitions. And even if Iran does accept
this scenario, the lAEA must be allowed un
restricted access to Iranian nuclear facilities
in order to ensure that Iran does not develop
nuclear weapons through some alternative
covert program.
So far, Iran does not seem willing to accept
the Russian offer, and it is possible that the
diplomatic window has passed for this option
to be exercised. Though perhaps not ideal
from an American geopolitical perspective, it
is somewhat encouraging to see Russia taking
an activist (if not altogether altruistic) stance
on this issue, and the United States must be
mindful that only a concerted multilateral ap
proach will effectively force Tehran to reverse
their nuclear path.The good news is that none
of the major players—Russia, China or the
EU —want to see Iran go nuclear.
Reporting Iran to the UN Security Coun
cil is a good first step, and the cooperation of
key players is a good sign, but thus far we
have hardly played hardball with Tehran.
There was considerable opposition to refer
ring Iran to the Security Council, which
would allow states to discuss the possibility of
levying sanctions on the regime. When the
full lAEA report comes out in early March,
it is imperative that the United States con
vince Russia, China and others that sanctions
against an uncooperative Iran should at the
very least be on the table. Although Presi
dent Ahmadinejad has regularly demon
strated nonchalance toward the possibility of
sanctions, widespread trade sanctions would
cripple an already hobbling economy and
destabilize the regime.
In an escalating situation, the world can
not afford to have its response crippled by dif
ferences in ideologies or accusations of
hypocrisy. In particular, the way in which the
United States addresses this accusation of
hypocrisy will have important ramifications
on the nuclear disarmament of Iran. The
United States needs to work harder to seek
international consensus and legitimacy, with
out grossly upsetting the global power struc
ture. It is incumbent upon America and the
rest of the world to ensure that Tehran is kept
a nuclear have-not.
