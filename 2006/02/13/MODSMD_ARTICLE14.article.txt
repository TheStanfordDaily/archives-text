# Two Rockstars and a Twinkie
## 
### 
So here I am, writing this at 9 a.m. You
might think I got up early. Well, as
chance would have it, 1 did get up early
— early yesterday morning. Honestly, I
never thought this would be me. Back in
high school, I went to bed before 11 p.m., did
my homework on time, and never drank en
ergy drinks. Yet here I am. zillions of grams
of caffeine still buzzing through my system
(my foot has been shaking uncontrollably
for the last three hours), and, of course, still
working on my IHUM paper. (By the way, I
apologize in advance to the poor soul who
has to read it.) Anyway, in the spirit of self
commemoration, 1 have created a timeline
of my first all night experience:
11:00 p.m. Some solid work done, got all of
the important stuff out of the way: Got a dou
ble shot from Late Nite, copied-and-pasted
random stuff into Word from Spark Notes, as
sembled the ideal mix of songs to listen to
while writing an IHUM paper, and got a
Twinkie to save for late night hunger.
11:05 I decide not to eat the Twinkie until I
write half of the paper.
11:071 eat the T\vinkie. I sink into depression
over my lack of willpower.
11:58 Some people from my dorm are in the
computer cluster with me. I make an outline
(dragging aforementioned random stuff
from Spark Notes into impressive looking
blobs of text). 1 make bullet points for the
outline. I discover that the font for my outline
looks better in Arial than in Times New
Roman.
12:34 a.m. I start feeling tired. Back to Late
Nite.This time 1 get two Rockstars so I know
I won't have to go back again. 1 take two free
smoothie samples. The lady behind the
counter gives me a dirty look.
12:41 Down both of the Rockstars in 20 sec
onds on a dare.
12:58 Feeling strange, teeth chattering, every
one else is bouncing around.
1:01 Decide to run Campus Loop.
1:01.32 Break the sound barrier.
1:401 've finally got some work done — well,
kind of. I started writing an introduction —
which, so far, is just "In this paper I will
argue."
1:47 One of my friends looks at my screen
and expresses shock that I still have nothing.

I am hurt on a fundamental level and shamed
into working.
2:49 I'm up to two out of six pages. Just one
other person and me in the cluster now — a
girl 1 never talk to. I need to use the bath
room, but don't want to because I don't think
these walls are soundproof enough.
2:52 1 decide to use the bathroom.
2:59 I discover that I was right, the walls are
not soundproof enough. Also, they are not
smell-proof enough.
3:00 I now have the cluster to myself.
3:47 I'm up to four pages now, almost there.
4:00 I get the 4 a.m. munchies. Bad.
4:02 I dig my Twinkie wrapper out of the
trash and lick off the spongy residue. It feels
so wrong, but so right.
4:43 One of the computers makes a really
loud noise and scares the hell out of me.
5:25 I realize that I could totally get naked in
the computer cluster right now and no one
would know.
5:30-6:48 CENSORED
7:001 like to call this the "Why the hell not?"
point. As in, I've come this far,so why the hell
not stay up.
7:231 make two sock puppets and act out the
scene from Shakespeare's "King Henry IV
Part I" that my paper is about.
8:04 My sock puppets tell me their life stories.
8:591 give up writing. I kick the margins up to
2.9 inches and change the font to 14 Courier
New. Bam, six pages.
9:011 decide to continue my timeline.
10:00 IHUM Lecture, horrible paper turned
in, I fall asleep in class.
10:021 find out I talk in my sleep.
Kho2 My IHUM Teaching Fellow finds out
that my subconscious thinks he is a preten
tious asshole.
