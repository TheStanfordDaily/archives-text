# To Chuck and Hunter With Love
## 
### 
Normal day at Stanford: Men avert
their eyes and run scared. Women
push aside the sniveling dorks on
their meetings for Future Business Leaders
of the World.
February day at Stanford: Men dart be
tween Sweet Hall and Stern avoiding the
light. Holed up in their cubicles, clinging to
their CS classes like life rafts, they hope they
can avoid "the hunt." The hunters are out
there clad in low-cut shirts, lip gloss and retro
sunglasses that were stolen from the emaciat
ed hand of an Olsen twin on her way back
from rehab. It's carnal chapstick chaos.
This hunt is called "dating at Stanford."
The first rule of dating at Stanford is you do
not talk about dating at Stanford.The second
rule of dating at Stanford is you DO NOT
talk about dating at Stanford. Other rules in
clude: Two people to a date. If this is your
first time dating at Stanford, you must bring
up major and freshman dorm. If someone
says "good night," goes limp or mentions
IHUM, the date is over. You cannot go to a
dining hall or toTresidder.
Other colleges may have the skulls, the
bones or are full of hambones (look it up),
but Stanford has its own secret society. They
will not acknowledge their membership in
this club; in fact, they will not acknowledge
that there is a society that dates. And yet, like
a bloated half-drunk Santa cheerily greeting
children while on uppers, it does exist.
Stanford's administration itself has no
problem with dating. It was years ago, during
the dark Nixon era, that the government re
alized that combining a linear accelerator
with co-ed chemistry would be a one-way
ticket to explosion-ville. It seemed the pow
ers that be thought Stanford students were a
loose tiger just waiting to go for the jugular
of world finance and industry. Well they tried

to put this cat down. Jack, but they can't keep
this cat down. So they tried with their little
lies about laying, their denying students of
good area singles locales, their creation of
the CS department to KEEP THE CATS
DOWN.
But the society endured, the chemistry
began mixing like all the bad dreams of a
gonzo journalist in a paint factory. Now.
armed with the brightest minds — the world
their blue oyster cult — the secret band of
Stanford sex-seeking individuals, the last
bastions of thought in this Newtonian bas
tard of Pluto-fascism and Renaissance mer
cantilism. has declared their big "fuck you"
and begun to date. Sweezevnogs.
So. this secret society exists. Around this
time of year, the proverbial curtain is
thrown back and we get to see the ugly face
of the wizard and realize that there is dating
at Stanford and the wizard has large ears
and a drawl.
The Allegra is beginning to take effect
now. I can smell the hair gel that soothes
while it burns away personality to reveal the
chocolate nougaty center, the blow dryers
that house the flames of misplaced affec
tion, a Viagra of vanity. I see little bunny
rabbits scurrying from the women's bath
rooms on the third floor, tripping me as I try
to make it back to my room to drop another
aspirin regimen.

I look out at the February daze and see the
men like little pixilated pong players bounc
ing their Frisbees to and fro. I watch as they
are dragged to that wasteland of yuppieness
that is Palo Alto for something other than rug
shopping.
Some are dragged from their keyboards,
complaining about their problem sets. The
lucky ones only have to go out to dinner.
Some are not so fortunate, promising such
things as a "relationship" or "a date to the Vi
ennese Ball." We've lost a lot of good men
that way.
Women, high on feminist power generat
ed from"The Vagina Monologues," anticipa
tion for Women's History Month and the suc
cess of TV's "Grey's Anatomy," patrol this
campus like Pi Phis looking for their fix.
While the meek men cower in the corners,
holding their game controllers like Gollums.
I watch as the season enables the women to
drag the geeks from their Flalo games and
make the dudes go out to dinner; but with a
heel to the gut — they won't let them pay.
But in all of this — in the chaotic hunts
and the tat-tat of the PC police at your door,
the chapstick and the awkwardness of shun
ning Beirut and Facebook for tepid hand
holding and hugs miles apart — there comes
an angelic light, a divine Virgin-Mary-in
your-oatmeal type of epiphany: Stanford stu
dents are dating. Frustrated? Yes. Awkward?
Yes. Still wearing sweatpants? Probably. But
trying? Yes.
Now go buy some soap, cats. I have a date
with some troubling bunnies and a tank of
gasoline.

C"hris is going to write all of his columns on a
combination of sleep deprivation, Sour Patch
Kids and old At the Drive-in albums. Send
complaints to cholt@stanford.edu.

alized that combining a linear accelerator
with co-ed chemistry would be a one-way
ticket to explosion-ville. It seemed the pow
ers that be thought Stanford students were a
loose tiger just waiting to go for the jugular
of world finance and industry. Well they tried

to put this cat down. Jack, but they can't keep
this cat down. So they tried with their little
lies about laying, their denying students of
good area singles locales, their creation of
the CS department to KEEP THE CATS
DOWN.
But the society endured, the chemistry
began mixing like all the bad dreams of a
gonzo journalist in a paint factory. Now.
armed with the brightest minds — the world
their blue oyster cult — the secret band of
Stanford sex-seeking individuals, the last
bastions of thought in this Newtonian bas
tard of Pluto-fascism and Renaissance mer
cantilism. has declared their big "fuck you"
and begun to date. Sweezevnogs.
So. this secret society exists. Around this
time of year, the proverbial curtain is
thrown back and we get to see the ugly face
of the wizard and realize that there is dating
at Stanford and the wizard has large ears
and a drawl.
The Allegra is beginning to take effect
now. I can smell the hair gel that soothes
while it burns away personality to reveal the
chocolate nougaty center, the blow dryers
that house the flames of misplaced affec
tion, a Viagra of vanity. I see little bunny
rabbits scurrying from the women's bath
rooms on the third floor, tripping me as I try
to make it back to my room to drop another
aspirin regimen.

I look out at the February daze and see the
men like little pixilated pong players bounc
ing their Frisbees to and fro. I watch as they
are dragged to that wasteland of yuppieness
that is Palo Alto for something other than rug
shopping.
Some are dragged from their keyboards,
complaining about their problem sets. The
lucky ones only have to go out to dinner.
Some are not so fortunate, promising such
things as a "relationship" or "a date to the Vi
ennese Ball." We've lost a lot of good men
that way.
Women, high on feminist power generat
ed from"The Vagina Monologues," anticipa
tion for Women's History Month and the suc
cess of TV's "Grey's Anatomy," patrol this
campus like Pi Phis looking for their fix.
While the meek men cower in the corners,
holding their game controllers like Gollums.
I watch as the season enables the women to
drag the geeks from their Flalo games and
make the dudes go out to dinner; but with a
heel to the gut — they won't let them pay.
But in all of this — in the chaotic hunts
and the tat-tat of the PC police at your door,
the chapstick and the awkwardness of shun
ning Beirut and Facebook for tepid hand
holding and hugs miles apart — there comes
an angelic light, a divine Virgin-Mary-in
your-oatmeal type of epiphany: Stanford stu
dents are dating. Frustrated? Yes. Awkward?
Yes. Still wearing sweatpants? Probably. But
trying? Yes.
Now go buy some soap, cats. I have a date
with some troubling bunnies and a tank of
gasoline.
