What's the only thing better than a concert fea

A concert featuring two, of course. This is the logic
behind the ASSU's recently-launched Voluntary

According to ASSU President Melanie Kan

fund, at least two student groups must cooperate
to throw an event. The fund is available for use by

ASSU senators said they feel the fund will help
student groups gain larger audiences at events.
"Stanford prides itself on the fact that it has

efforts they could expose each other's member
ships to other opportunities, and all parties could
greatly benefit."
In addition, the fund could reduce financial
hardship on smaller student groups.The ASSU ex
