## Student groups encouraged to cooperate Funding available for events that include more than one group 
### KAT LEWIN STAFF WRITER 
What's the only thing better than a concert fea
turing one of Stanford's many a cappella groups?
A concert featuring two, of course. This is the logic
behind the ASSU's recently-launched Voluntary
Student Organizations (VSO) Collaboration Ini
tiative (VCI).
According to ASSU President Melanie Kan

nokada, a senior, the VCI is a fund established by
ASSU executives and then-Dean of Students
Greg Boardman to provide incentive for VSOs to
plan events together. In order to qualify for the
fund, at least two student groups must cooperate
to throw an event. The fund is available for use by
both undergraduate and graduate groups. Group
financial managers can access and submit the ap
plication online.
ASSU senators said they feel the fund will help
student groups gain larger audiences at events.
"Stanford prides itself on the fact that it has
somewhere around 600 student groups, which
means that a lot of groups are highly, highly fo

cused," said ASSU Senator Danny Arbeiter, a
sophomore. "For instance, there are several pre
professional societies for each professional career
path, each with a slightly different focus, making a
lot of redundant efforts. If those groups combined
efforts they could expose each other's member
ships to other opportunities, and all parties could
greatly benefit."
In addition, the fund could reduce financial
hardship on smaller student groups.The ASSU ex
ecutives and the Dean of Student Office have each
pledged up to $5,000 to create the fund. According
to Arbeiter, that amount may in
crease in the future if the VCI proves
successful.
"Collaboration was one of the
ASSU Executives' three broad
goals for the year, and creating a
Collaboration Fund was one way of
achieving this goal." Kannokada
said. "To secure funds, we set aside
a large percentage of our own
budget in the beginning of the year,
but realized it was still a modest
amount for this endeavor. There
fore, we approached Boardman to
see if he would be willing to match
the funds that we contribute, thus
increasing the overall sum of
money which we can give to sup
port student groups.
The VCI was officially launched
just weeks after the undergraduate
senate announced a "soft cap" on
student organizations supported by
general fees. These groups now re
ceive $40 in funding per undergrad
uate participant. Because the cap
on funding is proportional to num
ber of undergraduate participants
in student groups, the smallest or
ganizations may have suffered the
hardest blow.
"The VCI helps small groups, and
groups that have very focused ef
forts and consequently, because
they're focused, have smaller mem
berships," Arbeiter emphasized.
"This allows them to join efforts with
other clubs and produce better pro
gramming through combining their
human resources and monetary re
sources."
However, Kannokada stressed
that the VCI was introduced in order
to encourage innovative group col
laboration and not as a Band-Aid for
reduced VSO budgets.
"The primary purpose of the VCI

is to encourage collaboration on
new, original events, and not for the
purpose of recuperating funds or
supplementing a reduced budget,"
agreed VCI Chair Lauren Graham,
a junior. "Student groups should
keep their annual, staple events
within their own groups, and consid
er applying to the VCI as an oppor
tunity to jointly expand their pro
gramming where a limited budget
would have otherwise prohibited
them from doing so."
Some members of small groups
said this would pose a challenge.
Senior Olivia Sohns, co-president
of Coalition for Justice in the Middle
East, said she is opposed to the VCI.
"The new ASSU policy does in
deed promote group collaboration
because the policy forces small
groups out of necessity to desper
ately seek out co-sponsorships in
order to fund their events!" she
wrote in an email to The Daily. "We
surely wish that the ASSU would
not frame its unfair soft-cap policy
in a way that seeks lamely to excuse
the unfairness of causing small
groups like ours to be financially
stricken, despite all we do to con
tribute to student life and aware
ness on campus."
Other group members are more
sanguine about the VCI, according
to Graham.
"I have already received several
emails with questions from interest
ed students since the VCI was first
announced at the VSO Leadership
Dinner in November, so 1 am pretty
confident that we will have many
strong applications," she said. "The
ASSU and the executive have high
expectations for the success of this
fund. Student group funding is, and
has always been a high priority for
the ASSU."
The application for the VCI went
up on the ASSU Web site on Friday, ac
cording to Kannokada. For more infor
