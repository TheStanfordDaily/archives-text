## WOMEN'S GOLF Card take on strong foes in opener Stanford tees it off against Pac-10 competition to start spring season 
### CARSON COOPER 
After a long winter of fine-tuning their
strokes on the driving range and tweaking
their short game on the practice green, the
Stanford women's golf team is ready to leave
the Farm and begin the second half of their
season today.
I"he Cardinal tee off this morning in the
first round of the Northrup Grumman Re
gional Challenge at the Palos Verdes Golf
Club in Palos Verdes Estates, Calif., as part of
a 14-team field that includes Pac-10 rivals
Washington. UCLA and California.
Leading the way for the Card will be senior
Kelly Husted.the team's leader and most dec
orated player. Also expected to contribute in
the tourney are freshmen Mari Chun and Ki-
Shui Liao, as well as junior Jennifer
Tangtiphaiboontana and senior Stephanie
Lue.
Head coach Caroline O'Connor will guide
the team in the second half of her eighth sea
son. O'Connor has led Stanford to unparal
leled success, highlighted by a No. 5 final rank
ing in the 1998-1999 season.
The tournament favorite is second-ranked
UCLA, led by stellar freshman Tiffany Joh
and junior Hannah Jun. Other strong teams
include No. 5 Pepperdine with Colombian
phenom Eileen Vargas, and No. 8 Arkansas,
fueled by senior Amanda McCurdey. Also
competing are Florida, Wake Forest, New
Mexico. Oklahoma State and Ohio State, who
will host the NCAA Championships starting
on May 15.
Also in the field is Paige McKenzie of
Washington, named the second-best amateur
in the nation by Golfweek magazine at the be
ginning of the fall season. McKenzie finished
13th in the US Women's Open, an impressive
performance for an amateur in her first major.
She was ranked the top collegiate golfer in the
nation after the fall season by Golf World
magazine.
Given the tough competition, perhaps it's
no surprise the Cardinal face an uphill battle
on the par-71.5,912-yard course in their first
action since an up-and-down fall season.
The women began the season with a sixth
place finish in the Edean Ihlanfeldt Invita
tional, in Sammamish, Wash., led by
Tangtiphaiboontana's sixth-place individual
finish. Pepperdine picked up their first win of
the year in that tourney.
