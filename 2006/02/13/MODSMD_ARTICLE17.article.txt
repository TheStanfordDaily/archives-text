## WOMEN'S GOLF Card take on strong foes in opener Stanford tees it off against Pac-10 competition to start spring season 
### CARSON COOPER 
After a long winter of fine-tuning their
strokes on the driving range and tweaking
their short game on the practice green, the
Stanford women's golf team is ready to leave
the Farm and begin the second half of their
season today.
I"he Cardinal tee off this morning in the
first round of the Northrup Grumman Re
gional Challenge at the Palos Verdes Golf
Club in Palos Verdes Estates, Calif., as part of
a 14-team field that includes Pac-10 rivals
Washington. UCLA and California.
Leading the way for the Card will be senior
Kelly Husted.the team's leader and most dec
orated player. Also expected to contribute in
the tourney are freshmen Mari Chun and Ki-
Shui Liao, as well as junior Jennifer
Tangtiphaiboontana and senior Stephanie
Lue.
Head coach Caroline O'Connor will guide
the team in the second half of her eighth sea
son. O'Connor has led Stanford to unparal
leled success, highlighted by a No. 5 final rank
ing in the 1998-1999 season.
The tournament favorite is second-ranked
UCLA, led by stellar freshman Tiffany Joh
and junior Hannah Jun. Other strong teams
include No. 5 Pepperdine with Colombian
phenom Eileen Vargas, and No. 8 Arkansas,
fueled by senior Amanda McCurdey. Also
competing are Florida, Wake Forest, New
Mexico. Oklahoma State and Ohio State, who
will host the NCAA Championships starting
on May 15.
Also in the field is Paige McKenzie of
Washington, named the second-best amateur
in the nation by Golfweek magazine at the be
ginning of the fall season. McKenzie finished
13th in the US Women's Open, an impressive
performance for an amateur in her first major.
She was ranked the top collegiate golfer in the
nation after the fall season by Golf World
magazine.
Given the tough competition, perhaps it's
no surprise the Cardinal face an uphill battle
on the par-71.5,912-yard course in their first
action since an up-and-down fall season.
The women began the season with a sixth
place finish in the Edean Ihlanfeldt Invita
tional, in Sammamish, Wash., led by
Tangtiphaiboontana's sixth-place individual
finish. Pepperdine picked up their first win of
the year in that tourney.
I"he Card followed by hosting the Pepsi In
tercollegiate, finishing tied for ninth with Cal-
ifornia, while Duke picked up the
win. Chun led Stanford with a six
under 221.
Husted came out strong in the
next match, taking the individual
crown as Stanford finished second
in the Kent Youel Invitational in
Kapolei, Hawaii.
The women capped the fall sea
son at the Hooters Collegiate
Match Play Championship in
Howey-in-the-Hills, Fla. Highlights
included a 3-0 weekend for Husted.
as well as two victories for Chun.
Tangtiphaiboontana also posted an
impressive win over Tennessee's Vi
oleta Retamoza, 1-up.
In the spring, the women look to
make a strong push towards the
NCAA Championships after finish
ing a respectable 19th in last year's
title event.
Gone from the team is Wendra
Liang, a four-year contributor for
the Card, and the 78th place finisher
in the NCAA finals. However, there
are high hopes for freshman Chun,
an EA Sports High School All-
American from the Kamehameha
School in Pearl City, Hawaii. Also
expected to compete is Liao, who
will adjust to the women's game
after competing on the boy's team
at Alameda High School (Alameda,
Calif.) last year.
For Husted, the spring season
will cap an excellent career on the
Farm, highlighted by numerous
recognitions as one of the top stu
dent-athletes in the conference.The
political science major is looking to
make a strong showing this spring in
preparation for her last attempt at
an NCAA Championship.
The team will also look to juniors
Lauren Todd, Jenna Seki and Saana

Rapakko to contribute in the
spring. Those three, as well as
Tangtiphaiboontana, will form a
formidable and experienced senior

class next year.
College golf is unique in its two
season format. After taking nearly
three months off, the women will

dust off their clubs, forget about the
midterm hanging over their heads,
and look to put together a good
showing in Palos Verdes.
