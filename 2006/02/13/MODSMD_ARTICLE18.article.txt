# Another milestone for Tara
## Cardinal score a season low 55, still win fifth straight game 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
BERKELEY, California â€” Exactly one
week after winning the 650 th game of her
career, Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer
recorded her 500 th victory as head coach
for the Cardinal in a 55-46 defeat of rival
California.
But instead of dwelling on the past.
VanDerveer is looking ahead.
"[l'm] moving on to another 500," Van-
Derveer said. "To be honest. I'm kind of
glad that it's over with. [But] when I look
back on it, I 11 probably remember this one
because it was at Cal."
Unlike number 650, this victory was a
hard-fought defensive struggle. Cal (15-9,
7-7 Pac-10) held the Cardinal to their low
est point total of the season, as Stanford
shot just 38.8 percent from the field.
"Our team struggled getting any offen
sive flow," VanDerveer said. "But we re
bounded well and played good defense.
People showed some real poise. I'm really
proud of how our team stayed with
things."
After the Bears took a three-point lead
with 13:11 remaining, No. 14 Stanford (18-
5, 12-2) regained momentum and pulled
away in the waning minutes on the back of
sophomore guard Candice Wiggins.
The reigning Pac-10 Player of the Year
led all scorers with 25 points on 5-of-6
shooting from behind the arc. She nailed
one three to pull even with the Bears mid
way through the second half and then an
other to push the lead to 10 in the final two
minutes.
"We didn't shoot extremely well and I
think that's a credit to their defense," Van-
Derveer said. "But when we needed a big
shot.CW was right there."
Junior forward Kristin Newlin provid
ed the sparkplug to ignite Wiggins' late
game burst. Defensively, she swatted an
emphatic block that enlivened the bench
and quieted a record crowd of 4.859. as the
ball landed 15 feet out of bounds. Offen
sively, her open outside jumper pushed the
Cardinal lead to 10 with just under four
minutes left, all but ending Cal's hopes.
"I was settling for outside shots and
turnarounds in the first half," Newlin said.
"I think the basket got bigger for me when
Brooke started getting doubled, and that
gave me some easy shots."
Stanford's use of sagging man-to-man
and zone defense kept the ball away from
Cal's freshmen forwards Ashley Walker
and Devanei Hampton. Instead, freshman
point guard Alexis Gray-Lawson was
forced to handle the ball with an injured
thumb and run an offense that only made
six field goals in the first half.
"She won't say [it's affecting her game],
