Hey, what's going on here?"
"We're in line lor Stanford
basketball."
"Since when do they have games on
Tuesdays?"
"Er, well, the game's not until Sun
day."
"[pause]"
Crazy? Yes, these are the Maples
Crazies of TJ-Town. That's right K
ville, we might not have a population
to rival yours, but at least we don't
camp because it's trendy or because
we'll get to be in The Duke Chronicle
or The Durham "Can't We Be Like
Any Other City in North Carolina
and Hate Duke" Reporter.
We camp for the love of the
game. Honestly. It's not even for the
good seats. In fact, the difference be
tween getting to be ten feet to the
right of center-court and ten feet to
the left could equate to three nights
of camping.
Hold up. Rewind. Is this the sea
son that we're undefeated and that
guy — most students don't even re
member his name— made that
shot from half court to beat Ari
zona? No. Does it matter? Of course
not. Stanford basketball is not per
forming as it once did, and that is
precisely why they need the support
of their faithful more than ever.
At the beginning of the season,
fans were pumped. Without even
doing anything, Stanford was ranked
13th in the country. Even for exhibi
tion. fans set up tent, then tore up
Maples when the Card played Sono
ma State, prompting Trent Johnson to
send an email to Sixth Man stating
that he."firmly believes that the Stan
ford Sixth Man is the best student sec
tion in the country... second to none."
Was Teej sincere? Probably.
Wrong? Yes.
Let us compare. The night before
a visit from Pac-10-leading Washing
ton, there are just two tents outside
Maples. For a comparable game at
Duke, we would be looking at a
three-digit number. And it's not like
they have an unfair, ridiculously
large, public school advantage.
