Hey, what's going on here?"
"We're in line lor Stanford
basketball."
"Since when do they have games on
Tuesdays?"
"Er, well, the game's not until Sun
day."
"[pause]"
Crazy? Yes, these are the Maples
Crazies of TJ-Town. That's right K
ville, we might not have a population
to rival yours, but at least we don't
camp because it's trendy or because
we'll get to be in The Duke Chronicle
or The Durham "Can't We Be Like
Any Other City in North Carolina
and Hate Duke" Reporter.
We camp for the love of the
game. Honestly. It's not even for the
good seats. In fact, the difference be
tween getting to be ten feet to the
right of center-court and ten feet to
the left could equate to three nights
of camping.
Hold up. Rewind. Is this the sea
son that we're undefeated and that
guy — most students don't even re
member his name— made that
shot from half court to beat Ari
zona? No. Does it matter? Of course
not. Stanford basketball is not per
forming as it once did, and that is
precisely why they need the support
of their faithful more than ever.
At the beginning of the season,
fans were pumped. Without even
doing anything, Stanford was ranked
13th in the country. Even for exhibi
tion. fans set up tent, then tore up
Maples when the Card played Sono
ma State, prompting Trent Johnson to
send an email to Sixth Man stating
that he."firmly believes that the Stan
ford Sixth Man is the best student sec
tion in the country... second to none."
Was Teej sincere? Probably.
Wrong? Yes.
Let us compare. The night before
a visit from Pac-10-leading Washing
ton, there are just two tents outside
Maples. For a comparable game at
Duke, we would be looking at a
three-digit number. And it's not like
they have an unfair, ridiculously
large, public school advantage.

The Turnaround
Although the energy in Maples is
something to be proud of — after
all, the Card are on a nine-game
home winning streak — we still have
a lot to work on. Sixth Man is hard
core, but we've got to step it up. We
have got to set the same expecta
tions for ourselves that we do for the
players. If we have a bad game,
they'll have a bad game.
And let us not forget the number
one rule of being the best: Never give
up. Don't think I didn't notice how
lazy people to started to get once we
found a way to lose those ever-mem
orable UC games.
Come on Stanford, we can make
a name for ourselves in college bas
ketball. Because Marketing is in
competent, I even created a phrase
for us: "Maples Madness." Don't be
afraid and come on out here: all you
need is a student ID and a t-shirt. I'll
even personally lend you a tent for
your first game. (Especially if you're

cute. And blonde. And a freshman,
but I digress.)
After losing really tough games
this past week at Cal and Gonzaga,
now is the time to show we are not
fair-weather fans. This coming week
is Arizona week, which means you
need to start camping out NOW. 1
can guarantee you that there is al
ready a line to get in at this instant,
and you don't want to fall back.
You might not think it's worth
while, but realize that camping out is
so much other than escaping those
painfully dreary dorm rooms. (We
even have electricity and, most im
portantly, wireless internet.)
It's not just a better spot in line.
It's being a part of the team. It's
being part of a community of fans.
It's enjoying the pleasant northern
California winter from somewhere
with no showers, but let's be honest,
who are you going to shower for out
here anyway?

No need to shower, hut holler at soph
omore Jamie Marincola at
jpcola@stanford.edu. Or just find him
this weekend. That's right — front,
