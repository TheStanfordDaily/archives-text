### LI TAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
About 400 Stanford students and community members gath
ered at a bonfire next to Lake Lagunita last Saturday evening to
celebrate Lohri.the Punjabi harvest festival.
Senior Sandeep Wasan, a member of Satrang, the Stanford
Sikh Students Association, has helped organize the festival for
four years. "Lohri is celebrated to mark the end of winter and the
arrival of good weather," he explained. "The festival involves
feasting, dancing, singing and gathering around a fire."
Lohri celebrations have been a tradition at Stanford for 19
years, Wasan added.
Special Languages Prof. Ravi Dhillon. who teaches Punjabi at
Stanford, explained that the bonfire "keeps people warm on the
coldest day of winter."
Students congregated around the fire and enjoyed tradition
al Punjabi food while waiting for performances to begin.
The Stanford Bhangra team danced on the stage, around the
audience and in circles around the fire accompanied by a singer
and drummers playing the dhol, a traditional Indi
an drum.
Team member Ravi Garg explained that they
performed pieces they had been practicing
throughout the year for competitions, one of which
they won recently.
After the performances, the professional drum

mer, Lai Singh Bhatti, congratulated and thanked
the audience.
"This is the first time we have been able to get
five or six dhols at the same time," he explained.
Bhatti then called on audience members to cele
brate their accomplishments.
"If you're newly wed, have a newly born, have a

new job, anything new, come let us know,"he told
those gathered.
Junior Mona Mohindra and aerospace engi
neering graduate student Mitul Jambusaria, both
students in Dhillon's Punjabi class, described the
festival. "Lohri is the celebration when all the
crops are harvested," Jambusaria explained. "The
community nature is especially important. Families
celebrate the achievements and hopes for the last
and the upcoming year."
"Every year the number of participants gets
bigger," Mohindra added.
The Bhangra team and community members
then sang traditional Punjabi songs, such as "Sun
der Mundariye," during which audience members
joined to chant and sing about Dulha Bhatti, a
Robin Hood-like figure who helped the poor. Var
ious members of the audience were also picked out
to speak and perform.
Electrical engineering graduate student Harsh
Mehta explained that although Lohri was not cele
brated in his region of central India, many regions
have their own harvest festivals, which vary by date
because of differences in weather.
Mathematician and Science Fellow Jonathan
Farley from the Stanford University Center for In
ternational Security and Cooperation learned
about the event on the Sanskriti email list. Farley
explained that he had developed an interest in
India, including its festivals, after teaching at the In
dian Institute of Technology in Mumbai last sum
mer. During his time in India, he had observed the
Ganesh festival, during which an idol is immersed
in the local Lake Powai.
The festival was organized by Satrang, as well as
the Punjabi community at Stanford.
