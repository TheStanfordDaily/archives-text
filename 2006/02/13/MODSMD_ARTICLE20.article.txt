# Stanford offense absent in two losses to Kansas
## Cardinal win Sunday to salvage the series after dropping two to Jayhawks 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Alter two consecutive games in
which Stanford's offensive struggles
led to losses, head coach Mark Mar
quess made substantial changes to
Sunday's batting order. The result?
Ten hits, a solo homer, production up
and down the lineup — and an 8-3
win over Kansas.
"We really have not swung well in
six games." said coach Mark Mar
quess of No. 19 Stanford's 4-2 record.
"Offensively, we need to pick it up be
cause you can't always pitch [wellJ
and play spotless defense."
Amid the lineup changes was
freshman leftfielder Joey August's
move to the leadoff spot. The change
paid off, as August went 3-for-4 and
scored two runs yesterday at Sunken
Diamond.
Kansas defeated Stanford 8-2 on
Friday and 5-4 on Saturday, holding
Stanford to only eight hits over both
contests.
l"he Jayhawks' Cius Milner — who
holds a .364 career average against
Stanford — created trouble for the
Cardinal in the first two games of the
series, tallying four hits and two RBI.
On Sunday, it seemed Milner
would continue to plague the Cardi
nal. The rightfielder helped break a 2-
2 tie in the third when he hit junior
Matt Leva's (1 -0) pitch into right for a
triple. Ritchie Price came in to score,
sliding just ahead of the throw.
Stanford's offense finally came to
life in the fourth, scoring three runs
on three hits, two stolen bases and a
walk against Kansas hurler — and
former Cardinal pitcher — Kodiak


ADRIAN GAITAN/The Stanford Daily
Sophore relief pitcher Erik Davis threw 3 1 /3 innings in Saturday's 5-4 loss to the Jayhawks. After an opening
sweep of No. 5 CS-Fullerton last weekend, the Card dropped two to Kansas this weekend.
Quick (1-1).
"(The fourth inning] was a big
confidence booster," freshman first
baseman Jason Castro said. "We
needed a little spark."
Taylor reached first with a walk
and moved to second on a balk.Two
batters later, Castro singled in Tay
lor for the tying run. He then stole
second in what turned out to be a
pivotal move for Stanford's offense.
Senior catcher John Hester, who
had been struggling in the series and
was moved from the fourth spot to
the seventh, hit an RBI single up the
middle to centerfielder Matt Baty.
Baty fell as he gave chase, and Hester
moved to second on the error. Hester
— who was 2-for-4 with an RBI and a
run on Sunday — then stole third.
"It was very key," August said of
the stolen bases. "We wanted to do it
earlier but were probably not get
ting enough people on base."
"It helps bring momentum back
on our side of the game, and it helps
create some opportunities when our
bats are struggling," Castro added.
Milner hurt the Cardinal once
more with a homerun to in the sixth,
but Stanford second baseman Chris
Lewis answered back with a shot
over the leftfield fence in the sev
enth. Stanford scored two more in
surance runs in the eighth.
Freshman lefthander Jeremy
Bleich recorded his second save of
the season, and Leva — who only
allowed two earned runs and four
hits in 5 2/3 innings — took the win.
"Wc expect days more like this,"
August said. "Our pitchers are
throwing well and not getting much
run support."
Junior righthander Greg
Reynolds was dominant and effi
cient Friday night, pitching six quick
innings and striking out nine.
"My fastball had a lot of move
ment," Reynolds said. "The velocity
was up for the fastball and my
changeup and curveball helped to
keep them off-balance. It was the
way I was interchanging them and
the velocity that made a good recipe
for success."

the mound, however, the momen
tum seemed to shift to Kansas'
pitchers.
Kansas shut down the Cardinal
offense for most of the night and
rode a five-run ninth inning to an 8-
2 victory on a perfect night for base

ball at Sunken Diamond. Stanford
endured its first loss of the season,
though it looked primed for a win
most of the game.
Saturday's tilt sealed the series
win for the Jayhawks, who handed
Matt Manship his first season loss.

The contest was a near-repeat of
Friday's, punctuated by solid Stan
ford pitching and anemic offense.
The Jayhawks, on the other hand,
crossed the plate four times in the
fourth inning, as Ricky Fairchild (2-
0) picked up the win.
