# Stanford offense absent in two losses to Kansas
## Cardinal win Sunday to salvage the series after dropping two to Jayhawks 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Alter two consecutive games in
which Stanford's offensive struggles
led to losses, head coach Mark Mar
quess made substantial changes to
Sunday's batting order. The result?
Ten hits, a solo homer, production up
and down the lineup — and an 8-3
win over Kansas.
"We really have not swung well in
six games." said coach Mark Mar
quess of No. 19 Stanford's 4-2 record.
"Offensively, we need to pick it up be
cause you can't always pitch [wellJ
and play spotless defense."
Amid the lineup changes was
freshman leftfielder Joey August's
move to the leadoff spot. The change
paid off, as August went 3-for-4 and
scored two runs yesterday at Sunken
Diamond.
Kansas defeated Stanford 8-2 on
Friday and 5-4 on Saturday, holding
Stanford to only eight hits over both
contests.
l"he Jayhawks' Cius Milner — who
holds a .364 career average against
Stanford — created trouble for the
Cardinal in the first two games of the
series, tallying four hits and two RBI.
On Sunday, it seemed Milner
would continue to plague the Cardi
nal. The rightfielder helped break a 2-
2 tie in the third when he hit junior
Matt Leva's (1 -0) pitch into right for a
triple. Ritchie Price came in to score,
sliding just ahead of the throw.
Stanford's offense finally came to
life in the fourth, scoring three runs
on three hits, two stolen bases and a
walk against Kansas hurler — and
former Cardinal pitcher — Kodiak

Sophore relief pitcher Erik Davis threw 3 1 /3 innings in Saturday's 5-4 loss to the Jayhawks. After an opening
sweep of No. 5 CS-Fullerton last weekend, the Card dropped two to Kansas this weekend.
