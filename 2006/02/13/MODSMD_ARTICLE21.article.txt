## UNLV no match for undefeated Stanford 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
The top-ranked women's tennis
team continues to dominate this sea
son. nabbing a 7-0 sweep of previous
ly undefeated No. 38 UNLV at home
on Friday.
While a few of the singles matches
were close at times, Stanford's (7-0)
control of the match was never in

question. 'Ilie Rebels, now 4-2 after
falling to No. 6 Cal on Saturday, only
managed to foree one match to a third
set.

SIMON PYLE/The Stanford Daily
Junior Theresa Logor won both her doubles ond singles matches this weekend,
as No. 1 Stanford kept its 63 match winning streak alive against UNLV
No. 3 doubles position, 8-0.
This feat was particularly impres
sive given that Liu and Nguyen had
never played together before. Liu
has been practicing and competing
at doubles with sophomore Celia
Durkin, who could not compete on
Friday due to an ankle injury. Liu
was then supposed to play with
sophomore Lejla Hodzic, who also
backed out of doubles because of
ankle pain. Fortunately, Nguyen was
able to step in at the last minute.
"The match was short and sweet,"
Nguyen said. "It was the first time
Amber and I played doubles togeth
er but we're good friends — I'm her
'mini-me' — so that helped our
game and made things a lot of fun on
the court."
The Cardinal took the other dou
bles matches at well. The team of
senior Alice Barnes and sophomore
Anne Yelsey beat Elena Gantcheva
and Nikol Dimitrova 8-1 at the No. 1
doubles spot to secure the doubles
point.The strong Rebels duo has ties
from beyond UNLV — Gantcheva,
a sophomore, and Dimitrova. a
freshman, are both from Stoychev
Sports School in Sofia, Bulgaria.
Stanford sophomore Whitney
Deason and junior Theresa Logar
then beat Sharon Marin and Claire
Smith at the No. 2 doubles spot, 8-3,
to complete the sweep.
Stanford swept singles, as well.
Nguyen finished first, with a quick 6-
1,6-1 win against Smith at the No. 5
spot. Hodzic then beat Tempelfelde
to finish second at the No. 6 spot, also
6-1,6-1.
"Our lineup is so deep, and we
have been proving that in our re
sults," Nguyen said of the Cardinal's
consistent command of the lower
seeds. "The girls who play at the bot
tom of our singles lineup would eas
ily play top at any other school, so of
tentimes those matches are quick
and the scores are a bit lop-sided."
Hodzic's win was especially im
portant as she eases back into com
petitive play after having surgery at

the end of last quarter. She said she is
being "patient and optimistic," but it
is still a struggle. She did not travel
with the team to Madison. Wise, two
weeks ago for the Team Indoors
Championship.
"My ankle has been feeling much
better the last two weeks, and it is
gradually progressing and getting
stronger every day that I play," she
said. "Now it's just a matter of build
ing up the endurance that I lost by
playing a lot and getting the muscle
memory back in my movement."
No. 2 Yelsey cruised to an easy
win over Marin, 6-0,6-1 at the No. 3
singles spot, but the other three sin
gles players struggled somewhat.
"They were definitely a pretty
good team," coach Lele Forood said.
"They were better singles players
than doubles. So while we were over
whelming at doubles, they came
back with some well-played singles
matches, particularly at the top of
the lineup."
Both Liu at the No. 1 spot against
No. 8-ranked Gantcheva and No. 4-
ranked Barnes at the No. 2 spot
against Dimitrova had to battle for
their wins, 6-3, 6-3 and 6-4, 6-2 re
spectively.
Deason lost her second set at the
No. 4 position, and had to faceTreber
in a decisive super-tiebreaker. Dea
son ultimately won the match, 6-1,3-
6,1-0(10-3).
"UNLV has some good players,
but 1 think we have a team that is just
stronger and better," Nguyen said of
the international Rebels squad.
In addition to the two players
from Bulgaria, UNLV team mem
bers hail from Latvia, Spain, France,
England and Israel. None of the
seven Rebels are American.
Hodzic said she considered the
match a valuable barometer of the
kind of play the Cardinal need to
bring down to Los Angeles this
weekend when the team faces
Southern California and UCLA.
"I thought it was an important
match to get through early in the sea
son, in preparation for the following
couple weeks on the road," she said.
"UNLV was a solid team and we per
formed well, but we need to be pre
pared to play just a notch higher in
next weekend's matches in LA."

"I thought it was an important
match to get through early in the sea

couple weeks on the road," she said.
"UNLV was a solid team and we per

The top-ranked women's tennis
team continues to dominate this sea
son. nabbing a 7-0 sweep of previous
ly undefeated No. 38 UNLV at home
on Friday.
While a few of the singles matches
were close at times, Stanford's (7-0)
control of the match was never in

question. 'Ilie Rebels, now 4-2 after
falling to No. 6 Cal on Saturday, only
managed to foree one match to a third
set.

SIMON PYLE/The Stanford Daily
Junior Theresa Logor won both her doubles ond singles matches this weekend,
as No. 1 Stanford kept its 63 match winning streak alive against UNLV
No. 3 doubles position, 8-0.
This feat was particularly impres
sive given that Liu and Nguyen had
never played together before. Liu
has been practicing and competing
at doubles with sophomore Celia
Durkin, who could not compete on
Friday due to an ankle injury. Liu
was then supposed to play with
sophomore Lejla Hodzic, who also
backed out of doubles because of
ankle pain. Fortunately, Nguyen was
able to step in at the last minute.
"The match was short and sweet,"
Nguyen said. "It was the first time
Amber and I played doubles togeth
er but we're good friends — I'm her
'mini-me' — so that helped our
game and made things a lot of fun on
the court."
The Cardinal took the other dou
bles matches at well. The team of
senior Alice Barnes and sophomore
Anne Yelsey beat Elena Gantcheva
and Nikol Dimitrova 8-1 at the No. 1
doubles spot to secure the doubles
point.The strong Rebels duo has ties
from beyond UNLV — Gantcheva,
a sophomore, and Dimitrova. a
freshman, are both from Stoychev
Sports School in Sofia, Bulgaria.
Stanford sophomore Whitney
Deason and junior Theresa Logar
then beat Sharon Marin and Claire
Smith at the No. 2 doubles spot, 8-3,
to complete the sweep.
Stanford swept singles, as well.
Nguyen finished first, with a quick 6-
1,6-1 win against Smith at the No. 5
spot. Hodzic then beat Tempelfelde
to finish second at the No. 6 spot, also
6-1,6-1.
"Our lineup is so deep, and we
have been proving that in our re
sults," Nguyen said of the Cardinal's
consistent command of the lower
seeds. "The girls who play at the bot
tom of our singles lineup would eas
ily play top at any other school, so of
tentimes those matches are quick
and the scores are a bit lop-sided."
Hodzic's win was especially im
portant as she eases back into com
petitive play after having surgery at

the end of last quarter. She said she is
being "patient and optimistic," but it
is still a struggle. She did not travel
with the team to Madison. Wise, two
weeks ago for the Team Indoors
Championship.
"My ankle has been feeling much
better the last two weeks, and it is
gradually progressing and getting
stronger every day that I play," she
said. "Now it's just a matter of build
ing up the endurance that I lost by
playing a lot and getting the muscle
memory back in my movement."
No. 2 Yelsey cruised to an easy
win over Marin, 6-0,6-1 at the No. 3
singles spot, but the other three sin
gles players struggled somewhat.
"They were definitely a pretty
good team," coach Lele Forood said.
"They were better singles players
than doubles. So while we were over
whelming at doubles, they came
back with some well-played singles
matches, particularly at the top of
the lineup."
Both Liu at the No. 1 spot against
No. 8-ranked Gantcheva and No. 4-
ranked Barnes at the No. 2 spot
against Dimitrova had to battle for
their wins, 6-3, 6-3 and 6-4, 6-2 re
spectively.
Deason lost her second set at the
No. 4 position, and had to faceTreber
in a decisive super-tiebreaker. Dea
son ultimately won the match, 6-1,3-
6,1-0(10-3).
"UNLV has some good players,
but 1 think we have a team that is just
stronger and better," Nguyen said of
the international Rebels squad.
In addition to the two players
from Bulgaria, UNLV team mem
bers hail from Latvia, Spain, France,
England and Israel. None of the
seven Rebels are American.
Hodzic said she considered the
match a valuable barometer of the
kind of play the Cardinal need to
bring down to Los Angeles this
weekend when the team faces
Southern California and UCLA.
"I thought it was an important
match to get through early in the sea
son, in preparation for the following
couple weeks on the road," she said.
"UNLV was a solid team and we per
formed well, but we need to be pre
pared to play just a notch higher in
next weekend's matches in LA."
