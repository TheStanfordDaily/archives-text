## Freshmen play a role in four wins 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
This weekend, the Cardinal's
youngest players wasted no time making
their presence felt on the field.
In the first game of their collegiate ca
reers, freshmen pitcher Missy Penna and
shortstop Maddv Coon both hit home
runs to propel No. 7 Stanford (4-1) to vic
tory in its season opener Friday.
The inexperienced duo led the way as
the Cardinal notched a 7-3 win over No.
20 Nebraska (4-1) in the first of five
games last weekend at the Kajikawa
Classic in Phoenix. Ariz. Later that after
noon, the Cardinal mercied Utah State
(1-4) 11-0 in five innings. They made it
four in a row on Saturday, beating New
Mexico (0-5) and Nevada (1 -4), by scores
of 3-2 and 5-1, respectively. Stanford
could not complete the weekend sweep,
however, falling to No. 4 Texas (4-1) in a
2-0 battle.
"1 was very pleased for us to come out
and play this well to start the season,"
coach John Rittman said. "And 1 liked
the way the kids battled all the way
through."
Coon finished her first day in a Stan
ford jersey with two homers and five
RBI to lead the Cardinal offense. She
closed out the weekend with a team-high
six RBI and a .353 batting average.
Not to be outdone, Penna tallied 24
strikeouts on the weekend to go along
with a 2-1 record in the circle and two
complete games. In the batter's box, she
notched four RBI, including a homerun,
and hit .438.
"Our two freshmen. Missy Penna and
Maddy Coon, played an integral role this
weekend," coach John Rittman said.
"We have a lot of veteran leadership on
the team, so I am excited about where
this team can go."
Senior centerfielder Catalina Morris
finished the weekend with five RBI,
eight hits, and a team-high .444 batting
average.
In her first start, Penna did double
duty against Nebraska, knocking it out of
the park and pitching five innings, giving
up only three runs while striking out six.
The Huskers scored first, but Coon's
three-run blast and an RBI single from
Morris gave the Cardinal a lead that they
would not relinquish.
"It was fun. We all played well togeth
er," Penna said. "For the first time not in
practice.it was good."

Stanford tallied two runs in the first
inning against Utah State and rolled to a
mercy-rule-shortened win. Morris
homered and Coon added her second
shot of the day, finishing the game 4-for
-4 at the plate. Morris led the team with
three RBI; sophomore third-baseman

Michelle Smith, Coon and Penna had

one.
Junior right-hander Laura Severson
(1-0) shut out the Aggies, scattering
three hits over four innings of work.
Sophomore closer Lauren Nydam struck
out two and gave up only a single hit in
the final inning.
It was more of the same Saturday,
with the Cardinal winning a battle with a
feisty New Mexico squad. Sophomore
hurler Becky McCullough (1-0) threw a
complete game in her first start of the
season, striking out nine while yielding
only five hits. Coon gave the Cardinal an
early lead with an RBI single in the first
inning and Penna and Morris added
RBIs in the fifth to make the score 3-0. A
two-run homer in the seventh inning
kept the Lobos close, but McCullough
tallied a pair of strikeouts to secure the
win.
Penna got her second win of the
weekend against Nevada, pitching a
complete game and falling only three
strikeouts short of a school-record 16.
Penna gave up a homer in the first in
ning, but shut out the Wolfpack for the
rest of the game.
Sophomore TVicia Aggabao blasted a
two-RBI triple in the second to start the

Stanford scoring. Ihe Cardinal tallied
three runs in the seventh — the first by
Morris on a fielding error and the others
off KBI singles by Penna and McCul
lough — for their fourth straight win.
In its last game of the tournament,
Stanford held the Longhorns in a score
less tie through the first four innings Sun
day. But Texas broke the scoring drought
in the fifth and added an insurance run in
the sixth to hand the Cardinal their first
defeat of the 2006 season.
Penna pitched her second straight
complete game, striking out five in the
loss. Texas hurler Cat Osterman, a two
time defending Player of the Year, re
tired 13 Cardinal batters and allowed
only two hits — to Morris and Penna —
in seven innings.
"For us to be facing one of the best
pitchers in the world, an Olympic pitch
er, someone as good as Cat Osterman, at
the beginning of our season, it was good
for us." Rittman said. "We had two good
opportunities to score on her. Even
though we would have liked to win that
game. I think we showed a lot of poten
tial."
The Cardinal will return home next
weekend for the Stanford Invitational,
where they will play host to Santa Clara,
Drake, Birmingham Southern and
Sacramento State.

out two and gave up only a single hit in
the final inning.
It was more of the same Saturday,
with the Cardinal winning a battle with a
feisty New Mexico squad. Sophomore
hurler Becky McCullough (1-0) threw a
complete game in her first start of the
season, striking out nine while yielding
only five hits. Coon gave the Cardinal an
early lead with an RBI single in the first
inning and Penna and Morris added
RBIs in the fifth to make the score 3-0. A
two-run homer in the seventh inning
kept the Lobos close, but McCullough
tallied a pair of strikeouts to secure the
win.
Penna got her second win of the
weekend against Nevada, pitching a
complete game and falling only three
strikeouts short of a school-record 16.
Penna gave up a homer in the first in
ning, but shut out the Wolfpack for the
rest of the game.
Sophomore TVicia Aggabao blasted a
two-RBI triple in the second to start the

Stanford scoring. Ihe Cardinal tallied
three runs in the seventh — the first by
Morris on a fielding error and the others
off KBI singles by Penna and McCul
lough — for their fourth straight win.
In its last game of the tournament,
Stanford held the Longhorns in a score
less tie through the first four innings Sun
day. But Texas broke the scoring drought
in the fifth and added an insurance run in
the sixth to hand the Cardinal their first
defeat of the 2006 season.
Penna pitched her second straight
complete game, striking out five in the
loss. Texas hurler Cat Osterman, a two
time defending Player of the Year, re
tired 13 Cardinal batters and allowed
only two hits — to Morris and Penna —
in seven innings.
"For us to be facing one of the best
pitchers in the world, an Olympic pitch
er, someone as good as Cat Osterman, at
the beginning of our season, it was good
for us." Rittman said. "We had two good
opportunities to score on her. Even
though we would have liked to win that
game. I think we showed a lot of poten
tial."
The Cardinal will return home next
weekend for the Stanford Invitational,
where they will play host to Santa Clara,
Drake, Birmingham Southern and
Sacramento State.

Freshman pitcher Missy Penna got the job done in the circle, as well as at the plate, throwing 18 innings, getting two wins and bat
ting 7-for-16 as the Cardinal went 4-1 to open the 2006 season.
This weekend, the Cardinal's
youngest players wasted no time making
their presence felt on the field.
In the first game of their collegiate ca
reers, freshmen pitcher Missy Penna and
shortstop Maddv Coon both hit home
runs to propel No. 7 Stanford (4-1) to vic
tory in its season opener Friday.
The inexperienced duo led the way as
the Cardinal notched a 7-3 win over No.
20 Nebraska (4-1) in the first of five
games last weekend at the Kajikawa
Classic in Phoenix. Ariz. Later that after
noon, the Cardinal mercied Utah State
(1-4) 11-0 in five innings. They made it
four in a row on Saturday, beating New
Mexico (0-5) and Nevada (1 -4), by scores
of 3-2 and 5-1, respectively. Stanford
could not complete the weekend sweep,
however, falling to No. 4 Texas (4-1) in a
2-0 battle.
"1 was very pleased for us to come out
and play this well to start the season,"
coach John Rittman said. "And 1 liked
the way the kids battled all the way
through."
Coon finished her first day in a Stan
ford jersey with two homers and five
RBI to lead the Cardinal offense. She
closed out the weekend with a team-high
six RBI and a .353 batting average.
Not to be outdone, Penna tallied 24
strikeouts on the weekend to go along
with a 2-1 record in the circle and two
complete games. In the batter's box, she
notched four RBI, including a homerun,
and hit .438.
"Our two freshmen. Missy Penna and
Maddy Coon, played an integral role this
weekend," coach John Rittman said.
"We have a lot of veteran leadership on
the team, so I am excited about where
this team can go."
Senior centerfielder Catalina Morris
finished the weekend with five RBI,
eight hits, and a team-high .444 batting
average.
In her first start, Penna did double
duty against Nebraska, knocking it out of
the park and pitching five innings, giving
up only three runs while striking out six.
The Huskers scored first, but Coon's
three-run blast and an RBI single from
Morris gave the Cardinal a lead that they
would not relinquish.
"It was fun. We all played well togeth
er," Penna said. "For the first time not in
practice.it was good."
