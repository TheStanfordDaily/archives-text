# WOMEN'S WATER POLO
## Card third in Stanford Invite with W over Cal No. 3 Stanford bounces back after loss to No. 2 USC to defeat No, 6 Cal 6-4 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
'Ihis weekend's Stanford Invitational proved to be just
what the women's water polo team had expected it to be —
an indicator of the team's strengths and progress thus far,
but also a reflection of the hard work that still remains for
the Cardinal.
After falling 9-7 to No. 2 USC in their Saturday evening
showdown, the No. 3 Cardinal (4-1, 1-0 MPSF) bounced
back to claim third in the tournament with a solid 6-4 win
over rival California yesterday afternoon.
The Cardinal started their weekend with an authorita
tive 12-4 victory over No. 7 Michigan. Nine unanswered
Cardinal goals after an early Wolverine score meant the
game was effectively decided by halftime. Nine different
Stanford players recorded goals in the game, with senior
two-meter Nancy El-Sakkary and junior Katie Hansen
leading the way with three apiece.
Riding the momentum of their victory, the underdog
Cardinal entered their match against Southern California
eager to prove the rankings wrong.
The two teams traded goals for the first three periods of
play, but the USC defense stilled the Card's numerous bids
to build a lead.
El-Sakkary continued her scoring spree by netting two
early goals while freshman driver Lolo Silver stepped up to
nail two spectacular shots from the perimeter. Senior cap
tain Laurel Champion and freshman Koree Blyleven both
contributed clutch goals. Blyleven's came on a perfectly
spotted shot from the low right wing on a key Stanford
power play midway through the second period.
But it was the Women ofTroy who finally broke the see
saw scoring battle in the fourth quarter. Triggered by junior
utility Brittany Hayes' goal off a rebound at 6:27, the USC
offense exploded to take a 9-6 lead. The Cardinal proved
unable to recover from the deficit, ultimately falling 9-7.
Junior goalie Meridith McColl highlighted the Stanford
defensive effort with eight saves. But while her play unques
tionably kept the Cardinal in the game, it wasn't enough to
keep the squad from dropping their first decision of the sea
son.
USC went on to win theTournament with a 10-8 win over
then top-ranked UCLA.
Nevertheless, the Stanford women returned to Avery
Aquatic Center yesterday prepared to conclude their week
end on a high note. And in convincing fashion, they did just
that.
After easily disposing of No. 11 San Jose State in their
morning matchup. 13-5, the Stanford women proceeded to
take on No. 6 California in the tournament's third-place
game.This time, unlike in their showdown against USC, the
Cardinal were able to combine strong performances in both
ends of the pool and took a decisive 6-4 victory.
In typical fashion, the Cardinal got offensive contribu-
tions from multiple members of
their roster. Silver and junior two
meter defender Alison Gregorka
both tallied two goals on the day,
while Hansen and sophomore
Jacquelyn Gauthier added one
apiece. McColl again anchored a
Stanford defense that held Califor
nia to a single goal in the second half
of the game.
"Unlike yesterday against USC,
we took control of the game and its
pace today," said Silver after the
matchup.
Freshman two-meter Jessica Stef
fens expressed optimism despite the
third-place finish.
"It was fun to see everything
come together and work this week
end," she said.
But the overriding perspective

that the Cardinal will take with them
from this weekend is the knowledge
that over the course of their four In
vitational games, they played a total
of 112 minutes — and that they
played just the way they wanted to
for all but seven of them. Every
member of the squad knows that a
stronger closing effort against USC
might have resulted in an entirely
different outcome.
"I was disappointed that we did
n't make plays in the fourth quarter
[against USC], when I thought we
had them where we wanted them,"
coach John Tanner said.
But the quality of the Cardinal's
performance in the first three peri
ods of play against Southern Califor
nia left little doubt as to the team's
ability to stack up with the best in the
nation.
"This weekend showed that there
are a lot of good teams out there,"
Tanner said. "And it's very exciting
to know that we can go toe-to-toe
with any one of them."
