## Stanford dish demolition may continue Measures have been taken to prevent tear down of small dishes 
### MIKI SOFER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Promising steps have been made since Octo
ber to prevent the demolition of five 60-foot dish
antennas located in the foothills behind the
Stanford campus.
Rescue efforts began over a year ago follow
ing the Stanford Fire Marshall's call to clean up
dry brush — a potential fire hazard — at the ob
servatory site. Although the dishes themselves
posed no threat. Dean of the School of Engi
neering Jim Plummer ordered the removal of
the dishes along with the brush and the transfer
of the property back to the University from the
school.
According to Charles Carter, director of the
Stanford University Land Use and Environ
mental Planning Office, the equipment fell into
disrepair after the Engineering School stopped
using the dishes for research in the 19705.
"The SoE took more than a year to deter
mine if there were any viable academic uses of
the site. Finding none, the school obtained a
demolition permit to complete the clean-up,"
Carter said.
This decision has not gone over well with
some groups on campus.
Friends of the Bracewell Observatory Asso
ciation (FBOA), a non-profit organization ded
icated to the preservation of the dishes, has filed

an appeal against the demolition permit, arguing
that the site has historic significance and de
serves appropriate review in accordance with
the California State California Environment
Quality Act.
The observatory site was founded 50 years
ago by Electrical Engineering Prof. Emeritus
Ronald N. Bracewell with an initial array of 32
10-foot dishes. These dishes, used by NASA to
protect its astronauts from lethal solar exposure
during the Apollo moon landings, became criti
cal contributors to the space exploration effort.
The five larger dishes, also constructed by
Bracewell, permitted scientists to track the
speed and direction of the solar system's move
ment with respect to the cosmos. Since then,
image reconstruction algorithms derived from
these two dish arrays have been applied to med
ical CAT scan and MRI imagery techniques.
"[Bracewell's contribution] represents one
of the most important developments in the his
tory of medicine in the 20th century, and many
lives have been saved by these dishes at 3185
Alpine Road." said Bob Lash, president of
FBOA.
In conjunction with the director of Stanford's
Space, Telecommunications and Radio Science
Laboratory and the director of Stanford's Space
Systems Development Laboratory, FBOA has
submitted a proposal to save and restore the site.
The document details that recent inspections
have found the dishes to be structurally sound,
intact and capable of total refurbishment.
FBOA is prepared to provide the long-term
funding and expert maintenance that would be

necessary for the restoration efforts.
"Our goal is to bring this observatory back
into operation to open up the world of radio as
tronomy to Stanford's faculty.students and com
munity outreach efforts," Lash said.
Several professors and students have also
stepped forward, proposing the use of the obser
vatory as a teaching site for the undergraduate
astronomy program and a variety of research
projects.
Despite these efforts, the future of the dishes
remains uncertain. An open letter submitted by
FBOA to University President John Hennessy
in August 2005 received no response, and in Sep
tember the organization's request to meet and
discuss the most current proposal was denied in
a letter from Jeffrey Wachtel, special assistant to
Hennessy.
Wachtel's letter explained that "President
Hennessy believes he has the necessary infor
mation at hand...we are reviewing all the factors
involved in this decision and I assure you we are
giving your opinions and all others serious con
sideration."
Wachtel also indicated that before taking fur
ther steps. Hennessy is waiting for the results of
the appeal to the Santa Clara Country Board of
Supervisors, which will determine the historical
status of the site. The appeal is scheduled for
Feb. 28.
In the meantime, demolition plans have been
postponed due to the University's consideration
of a new proposal. Upon learning about the im-
minent demolition of the dishes,
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
(JPL) approached Stanford's Office
of Science Outreach with its own
proposal that could be carried out at
"minimal or no cost" to Stanford.
According to the framework, the
dishes would be equally shared
among several JPL and FBOA

funded outreach programs, Stanford
research initiatives, and the JPL
Deep Space Network Array project
that will provide constant tracking of
NASA's deep space missions.
Although an FBOA petition to
save the dishes has collected 901 sig
natures to date, the majority of the
Stanford student body seems to re
main indifferent to and unaware of
the ongoing controversy regarding
the dishes.
"I have no opinion (on the dishes
being saved]," commented junior
Tammy Phan. "For the longest time

the dish has been such a big part of
Stanford's research, but I don't even
know what is going on at the site
right now."
"I never heard about this issue
before," said freshman Orr Keshet.
"It should be brought to awareness
and more facts should be examined
before making any decisions."
