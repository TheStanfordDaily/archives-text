## Prepaid tuition plans no longer decrease aid 
### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
Until recently, students with prepaid tuition plans have had
their eligibility for need-based aid reduced dollar-by-dollar.
Both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives have re
cently approved a measure, to take effect on July 1, that elimi
nates this penalty.
A prepaid tuition plan allows families to prepay all or part of
a student's tuition today that can be used in the future at a spe
cific collage or group of member colleges. When the student en
rolls at that college or one of the member colleges, the prepaid
tuition is redeemed with the percent of tuition previously pur
chased despite any price increases.
Stanford has been a participant in the Independent 529 Plan,
named after the Internal Revenue Code section that authoriz-
es such programs, since 2003. Ac
cording to the Office of Financial
Aid, the number of families taking
advantage of this Independent 529
Plan at Stanford is small because the
program has been in existence for a
relatively short time.
"The University sees the Inde
pendent 529 Plan as another option
for making Stanford tuition more af
fordable," said Director of Financial
Aid Karen Cooper. "Stanford also
accepts funds from other state-spon
sored prepaid tuition plans. For fam
ilies who know they probably won't
qualify for need-based financial aid,
prepaid tuition plans give them a
way to pay for educational costs in
advance at a lower rate."
The new regulations concerning
prepaid tuition plans is designed to
better allow families that use them
to obtain need-based financial aid.
"Under the old regulations, fami
lies who invested in a prepaid tuition
plan and applied for need-based fi
nancial aid were at a disadvantage
because we were required to consid
er the value of the plan as a direct re
source which reduced eligibility for
aid dollar for dollar," Cooper said.
"Under the new regulations, we are
able to treat this asset just like any
other parent asset. It goes into the
formula we use to calculate the ex
pected family contribution. Now
even lower income families have an
incentive to save because it won't
have a negative impact on their eligi
bility for aid."
According to Stanford Develop
ment Officer and Stanford Law
School Lecturer Howard Pearson,
prepaid tuition plans and college
saving plans are tax-efficient ways

for parents to provide a college edu
cation for their children because
earnings on money set aside in those
arrangements are not subject to tax.
"College savings plans provide a
savings account that should grow
over time from investing the con
tributed money and that increased
amount will be available for college
tuition when the time comes," Pear
son said. "The family bears the risk in
how the investments do and how fast
tuition rises. Prepaid tuition plans
refer to payments matched to a par
ticular school or, in the case of a new
consortium, a few hundred colleges
who have joined together in a pro
gram, where the contributor buys a
percentage of tuition for the future."
For example, if tuition at a state
college is now $B,(XM) and a student's
family contributes $2.0(30 to the pre
paid tuition plan, they have bought
one quarter of the tuition whenever
the student enrolls in that college.
According to Pearson, the financial
risk of increased tuition falls on the
program rather than the family.
Pearson further explained that
prepaid tuition plans are geared to
help pay for a limited number of col
leges, whereas college savings plans
can be used to help pay tuition at any
college.
