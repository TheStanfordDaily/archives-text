# ALL ABOUT ADAM
## Morrison's 34 point output foils the fiesty Cardinal 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
SPOKANE, Wash. — Stanford men's
basketball team knew No. 5 Gonzaga, led
by the outside-inside punch of forward
Adam Morrison and center J.P. Batista,
would be the toughest opponent they
would face all season.
Stanford knew its NCAA Tournament
chances all but depended upon snapping
the Bulldogs' 35-game home winning
streak — the longest in the country.
And Stanford responded with its most
explosive first half of the season.
The Card hit their first three shots to
jump to an 8-0 lead just a minute in, and
never trailed for the rest of the period,
shooting an otherworldly 59 percent to
build a 43-38 lead.
Unfortunately for the Card, the game
was 40 minutes long.
And in the second half, Morrison
scored 19 of his 34 — including all but one
of Gonzaga's 14 points in the final four
minutes — and J.P Batista added 12 of his
24 as Gonzaga pulled away for an 80-76
victory, its 11th straight win.
"Stanford did a good job of limiting my
touches; I started getting frustrated," said
Morrison, whom many experts project as
the first pick in next year's NBA draft.
"That zone they played me really high and
didn't give me a good look. But when it's
clutch time at the end of the game, 1 know
the ball's going to be in my hands."
Morrison's 34-point effort came just
two days after Stanford (12-9,8-4 Pac-10)
allowed Cal's Leon Powe to tally 32 en
route to a 65-62 Bear victory.
"He made some big shots," senior
guard Dan Grunfeld (16 points, six re
bounds) said. "There's a couple of threes
that were well-contested and went down
for him.That's why he's such an excellent
player."
And perhaps that was the theme of the
night. Stanford played very well, easily the
best it had all season, but Gonzaga (20-3),
led by its two stars, was simply excellent.
