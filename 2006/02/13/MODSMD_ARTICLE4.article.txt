# ALL ABOUT ADAM
## Morrison's 34 point output foils the fiesty Cardinal 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
SPOKANE, Wash. — Stanford men's
basketball team knew No. 5 Gonzaga, led
by the outside-inside punch of forward
Adam Morrison and center J.P. Batista,
would be the toughest opponent they
would face all season.
Stanford knew its NCAA Tournament
chances all but depended upon snapping
the Bulldogs' 35-game home winning
streak — the longest in the country.
And Stanford responded with its most
explosive first half of the season.
The Card hit their first three shots to
jump to an 8-0 lead just a minute in, and
never trailed for the rest of the period,
shooting an otherworldly 59 percent to
build a 43-38 lead.
Unfortunately for the Card, the game
was 40 minutes long.
And in the second half, Morrison
scored 19 of his 34 — including all but one
of Gonzaga's 14 points in the final four
minutes — and J.P Batista added 12 of his
24 as Gonzaga pulled away for an 80-76
victory, its 11th straight win.
"Stanford did a good job of limiting my
touches; I started getting frustrated," said
Morrison, whom many experts project as
the first pick in next year's NBA draft.
"That zone they played me really high and
didn't give me a good look. But when it's
clutch time at the end of the game, 1 know
the ball's going to be in my hands."
Morrison's 34-point effort came just
two days after Stanford (12-9,8-4 Pac-10)
allowed Cal's Leon Powe to tally 32 en
route to a 65-62 Bear victory.
"He made some big shots," senior
guard Dan Grunfeld (16 points, six re
bounds) said. "There's a couple of threes
that were well-contested and went down
for him.That's why he's such an excellent
player."
And perhaps that was the theme of the
night. Stanford played very well, easily the
best it had all season, but Gonzaga (20-3),
led by its two stars, was simply excellent.

Senior foward Dan Grunfeld and the Cardinal showed some heart against Gonzaga in Spokane on Saturday, but
the No. 5 Bulldogs and Adam Morrison fought off a late charge to hold on to a 80-76 victory.
"We played good team basketball,"
Grunfeld said. "We played hard, we
defended and we shared the ball. We
fought hard, but sometimes you just
don't win."
And in the game's final stretch, no
Stanford star shined brighter than sen
ior guard Chris Hernandez, who
notched 14 of his team-high 17 points
in the second period. Just as important
ly, Hernandez finished 5-of-8 deep, in
cluding a clutch three-pointer with 19
seconds to go that cut the deficit to 78-
76, only for Morrison to then ice the
game with a pair of free throws.
But on a night when everything
went well, just not well enough, Her
nandez managed to stop himself just
when it looked like Gonzaga's defense
could not. Hernandez picked up his
second foul less than 10 minutes into
the first half, and fourth foul just six
minutes into the second half, and head
coach Trent Johnson benched his star
on both occasions.
"1 wish the [officials] would have
let our best player play the game,"
Johnson said. "It's frustrating, very
frustrating."
Because of the foul trouble. Her

nandez finished the contest having
played just 22 minutes — and knowing
that his team needed more from him.
"If you are going to come in to a
No. 5 team's gym, you are going to
have to play pretty flawless," Hernan
dez said. "We didn't have a flawless
game, and that's why we didn't win."
Stanford's other major flaws were
free-throw shooting and defense.
The Card finished just 15-of-24 (63
percent) from the line, including just
11 -of-19 (58 percent) in the second
half. Stanford entered the game shoot
ing nearly 80 percent in Pac-10 play,
matching the 81 percent clip Gonzaga
put up (21-of-26).
But on Saturday night, Stanford's
misses appeared contagious. Of the
seven Cardinal to step to the free
throw line, four missed at least two
free hies.
Meanwhile, the defensive prob
lems started immediately, as Gonzaga
torched the Cardinal for 38 first-half
points.
"That was probably one of our
worst defensive halves of the season,"
Hernandez said.
And though the Cardinal played

Batista, started making the shots they
had been missing in the first. All while
fighting off double and triple teams,
the duo combined for a second-half

Haryasz, Stanford's leading scorer

Gonzaga's collapsing defense for the
relatively quiet night (11 points, four
rebounds, four turnovers) — as did
Johnson.
"They did a good job of doubling

good job of being physical with him."
Post-game, Haryasz added that his
vision was nearly perfect, and the eye
injury he sustained against Oregon
State's Sasa Cuic a week ago Saturday
had negligible effect on his play.
"My vision is definitely not the rea
son we lost," said Haryasz, who now
has 999 points on his Stanford career.

ior guard Chris Hernandez, who
notched 14 of his team-high 17 points
in the second period. Just as important
ly, Hernandez finished 5-of-8 deep, in
cluding a clutch three-pointer with 19
seconds to go that cut the deficit to 78-
76, only for Morrison to then ice the
game with a pair of free throws.
But on a night when everything
went well, just not well enough, Her
nandez managed to stop himself just
when it looked like Gonzaga's defense
could not. Hernandez picked up his
second foul less than 10 minutes into
the first half, and fourth foul just six
minutes into the second half, and head
coach Trent Johnson benched his star
on both occasions.
"1 wish the [officials] would have
let our best player play the game,"
Johnson said. "It's frustrating, very
frustrating."
Because of the foul trouble. Her

nandez finished the contest having
played just 22 minutes — and knowing
that his team needed more from him.
"If you are going to come in to a
No. 5 team's gym, you are going to
have to play pretty flawless," Hernan
dez said. "We didn't have a flawless
game, and that's why we didn't win."
Stanford's other major flaws were
free-throw shooting and defense.
The Card finished just 15-of-24 (63
percent) from the line, including just
11 -of-19 (58 percent) in the second
half. Stanford entered the game shoot
ing nearly 80 percent in Pac-10 play,
matching the 81 percent clip Gonzaga
put up (21-of-26).
But on Saturday night, Stanford's
misses appeared contagious. Of the
seven Cardinal to step to the free
throw line, four missed at least two
free hies.
Meanwhile, the defensive prob
lems started immediately, as Gonzaga
torched the Cardinal for 38 first-half
points.
"That was probably one of our
worst defensive halves of the season,"
Hernandez said.
And though the Cardinal played

Gonzaga's collapsing defense for the
relatively quiet night (11 points, four

Junior forward Adam Morrison dashed the any chance that the Cardinal had of making a late comeback, scoring
12 of his 34 points in the final 3 minutes, as the No. 5 Zags hung on to win, 80-76..
SPOKANE, Wash. — Stanford men's
basketball team knew No. 5 Gonzaga, led
by the outside-inside punch of forward
Adam Morrison and center J.P. Batista,
would be the toughest opponent they
would face all season.
Stanford knew its NCAA Tournament
chances all but depended upon snapping
the Bulldogs' 35-game home winning
streak — the longest in the country.
And Stanford responded with its most
explosive first half of the season.
The Card hit their first three shots to
jump to an 8-0 lead just a minute in, and
never trailed for the rest of the period,
shooting an otherworldly 59 percent to
build a 43-38 lead.
Unfortunately for the Card, the game
was 40 minutes long.
And in the second half, Morrison
scored 19 of his 34 — including all but one
of Gonzaga's 14 points in the final four
minutes — and J.P Batista added 12 of his
24 as Gonzaga pulled away for an 80-76
victory, its 11th straight win.
"Stanford did a good job of limiting my
touches; I started getting frustrated," said
Morrison, whom many experts project as
the first pick in next year's NBA draft.
"That zone they played me really high and
didn't give me a good look. But when it's
clutch time at the end of the game, 1 know
the ball's going to be in my hands."
Morrison's 34-point effort came just
two days after Stanford (12-9,8-4 Pac-10)
allowed Cal's Leon Powe to tally 32 en
route to a 65-62 Bear victory.
"He made some big shots," senior
guard Dan Grunfeld (16 points, six re
bounds) said. "There's a couple of threes
that were well-contested and went down
for him.That's why he's such an excellent
player."
And perhaps that was the theme of the
night. Stanford played very well, easily the
best it had all season, but Gonzaga (20-3),
led by its two stars, was simply excellent.

tougher defense in the second, Gonza
ga, and especially Morrison and
Batista, started making the shots they
had been missing in the first. All while
fighting off double and triple teams,
the duo combined for a second-half
performance (10-of-14, 3-of-5 on
threes, 8-of-10 on free throws, 31
points) that most players would be
lucky to put up in shoot-around.
When the final horn sounded, the
Bulldogs had scored 42 points on 57
percent shooting in the second. Noth
ing Stanford did defensively seemed
to matter — Morrison and Batista
could not miss, and the Cardinal were
left with their second-straight heart
breaker.
"We're going to have to try to for
get about this," senior forward Matt
Haryasz said. "We had two tough loss
es, so it's rough."
Haryasz, Stanford's leading scorer
and rebounder this season, credited
Gonzaga's collapsing defense for the
relatively quiet night (11 points, four
rebounds, four turnovers) — as did
Johnson.
"They did a good job of doubling
the post," Johnson said. "They did a
good job of being physical with him."
Post-game, Haryasz added that his
vision was nearly perfect, and the eye
injury he sustained against Oregon
State's Sasa Cuic a week ago Saturday
had negligible effect on his play.
"My vision is definitely not the rea
son we lost," said Haryasz, who now
has 999 points on his Stanford career.
Stanford next hosts Arizona State
(9-13,3-10) on Thursday and Arizona
(15-9,8-5) on Saturday.
Notebook: Post-game, Trent John
son complained that Stanford's
biggest national platform of the sea
son came against such a strong oppo
nent in such a hostile arena.
"When they come to Maples [next
season, on a to-be-determined date], I
hope ESPN and College Game Night
come and return the favor." Johnson
said. "It's been interesting, the politi
cal side of it."
As Johnson walked away, ESPN's
Andy Katz pointed out that Fox
Sports Net has the television rights to
Pac-10 home games. Katz, Dick Vitale,
Digger Phelps, Erin Andrews, Rece
Davis and Doug Gottleib were among
the bigger ESPN personalities at the
contest.

Junior forward Adam Morrison dashed the any chance that the Cardinal had of making a late comeback, scoring
12 of his 34 points in the final 3 minutes, as the No. 5 Zags hung on to win, 80-76..
