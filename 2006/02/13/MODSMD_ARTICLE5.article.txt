Chanting, "Stop the torture, stop the pain,
Stanford labs are inhumane!" protestors picket
ed outside the Animal Research Facility at Stan
ford Medical School Friday afternoon as well
dressed security guards looked on. The animal
rights demonstration, the third this year by the
student group Animal Rights on the Farm
(ARF), aimed to promote awareness of animal
experimentation on campus.
The small but vocal group of demonstrators
lined up on the sidewalk, flanked on either side by
two security guards with four more standing
across the parking lot.
"It's definitely having an el feet," said ARF
President Claire Wagenseil, a senior, as nine pro
testors stood in a line behind her chanting such

slogans as "Hey Stanford, what do you say? How
many animals died today?"
Most people hurried past, averting their eyes
from the signs and the faces of the protestors.
Doctors and graduate students walked by the
picket line briskly and declined to comment.
"A lot of people don't want to touch the issue,"
Wagenseil said. "I think it's good for them to hear
that there are people opposed to [animal re
search]."
A few onlookers took the group's pamphlet,
entitled "Animal Experimentation at Stanford
University," and encouraged the protestors.
According to the Medical School — and most
other medical institutions including the Founda
tion for Biological Research — animal research
has been the cornerstone of medical advance
ment in the last century. "We wouldn't have a
polio vaccine if it weren't for animal research,"
said Ruthann Richter, director of media relations
for the Medical School."Heart transplants in dogs
