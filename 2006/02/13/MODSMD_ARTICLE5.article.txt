## Students protest for animals Experimentation on animals at Stanford questioned "Polls show public approval. It's a key component of our research enterprise at every medical research facility in this country." 
### BEN EPPLER STAFF WRITER 
Chanting, "Stop the torture, stop the pain,
Stanford labs are inhumane!" protestors picket
ed outside the Animal Research Facility at Stan
ford Medical School Friday afternoon as well
dressed security guards looked on. The animal
rights demonstration, the third this year by the
student group Animal Rights on the Farm
(ARF), aimed to promote awareness of animal
experimentation on campus.
The small but vocal group of demonstrators
lined up on the sidewalk, flanked on either side by
two security guards with four more standing
across the parking lot.
"It's definitely having an el feet," said ARF
President Claire Wagenseil, a senior, as nine pro
testors stood in a line behind her chanting such

slogans as "Hey Stanford, what do you say? How
many animals died today?"
Most people hurried past, averting their eyes
from the signs and the faces of the protestors.
Doctors and graduate students walked by the
picket line briskly and declined to comment.
"A lot of people don't want to touch the issue,"
Wagenseil said. "I think it's good for them to hear
that there are people opposed to [animal re
search]."
A few onlookers took the group's pamphlet,
entitled "Animal Experimentation at Stanford
University," and encouraged the protestors.
According to the Medical School — and most
other medical institutions including the Founda
tion for Biological Research — animal research
has been the cornerstone of medical advance
ment in the last century. "We wouldn't have a
polio vaccine if it weren't for animal research,"
said Ruthann Richter, director of media relations
for the Medical School."Heart transplants in dogs

led to human heart transplants. Sixty
thousand people are alive today
thanks to that research."
Richter also stated that animal re
search is accepted by the general
public. "Polls show public approval,"
she said. "Animal research is a wide
ly recognized way of advancing clini
cal knowledge. It's a key component
of our research enterprise at every
medical research facility in this coun
try."
Richter was also careful to main
tain that research subjects receive
excellent care.
"Animal research is more heavily
regulated than human research," she
said, adding that both the physiolog
ical and psychological well-being of
the animals must be maintained. For
example, primate subjects are played
with, given treats and toys, shown
movies and cared for according to
federal and University regulations.
The protestors criticized the Uni
versity's justification for animal re
search. Wagenseil cited
http://www.cure disease.com, a Web
site arguing that animal research
leads to erroneous results. She
claimed that infecting monkeys with
the Polio virus in the 1910s actually
delayed development of a vaccine
for the disease because monkeys
contract it nasally while humans are
infected through the digestive tract.
Whatever discoveries animal re
search may have contributed to, its
days of usefulness are over, members
of ARF said.
"While animal research might

have seemed useful in early 20th
century science, a lot has changed
since then. There are modern alter
natives such as computer modeling
and in vitro research that make the
use of animals unnecessary," Wagen
seil wrote in an email to the Daily.
Medical School officials' hopes
that new techniques will reduce ani
mal testing are tempered by doubts
about the effectiveness of alternative
options. "Of course our goal is to re
duce [the number of animals] wher
ever possible, but there will be re
search involving animals when there
are no alternatives," said Richter.
Several uninvolved students said
they recognize animal suffering as an
issue, but still are in favor of research
that produces positive effects.
"As a bioengineer, I think these
tests are necessary," said Dean Hu,a
first-year graduate student. "The
human benefits outweigh the animal
costs."
Freshman Becca Stanger agreed.
"On a basic level, yes it's inhu-

mane what we're doing to them." she
said. "But you also have to weigh the
outcomes in comparison to the sacri
fice. Of course it's hard to apply a
universal 'no it's wrong' or 'yes it's
good' to anything like that."
With public response lukewarm,
the ARF members said they are
aware that it will not be possible to
shut down the Research Animal Fa
cility. Instead, they aim to open the
minds of both those in power and ca
sual observers to the ethical prob
lems they see with such research.
"Transparency and accountability
for the research being done are our
main goals right now," Wagenseil
wrote to The Daily. "We've been pur
suing constructive dialogues with
those involved in animal research, but
we don't feel that our stance is being
given adequate consideration yet.
We're protesting so that we can fur
ther spur this dialogue and try to move
Stanford in the direction of reducing
the number of animals in research and
seriously pursuing alternatives."

tion for Biological Research — animal research
has been the cornerstone of medical advance
ment in the last century. "We wouldn't have a
polio vaccine if it weren't for animal research,"
said Ruthann Richter, director of media relations
for the Medical School."Heart transplants in dogs

School on Friday afternoon.
led to human heart transplants. Sixty
thousand people are alive today
thanks to that research."
Richter also stated that animal re
search is accepted by the general
public. "Polls show public approval,"
she said. "Animal research is a wide
ly recognized way of advancing clini
cal knowledge. It's a key component
of our research enterprise at every
medical research facility in this coun
try."
Richter was also careful to main
tain that research subjects receive
excellent care.
"Animal research is more heavily
regulated than human research," she
said, adding that both the physiolog
ical and psychological well-being of
the animals must be maintained. For
example, primate subjects are played
with, given treats and toys, shown
movies and cared for according to
federal and University regulations.
The protestors criticized the Uni
versity's justification for animal re
search. Wagenseil cited
http://www.cure disease.com, a Web
site arguing that animal research
leads to erroneous results. She
claimed that infecting monkeys with
the Polio virus in the 1910s actually
delayed development of a vaccine
for the disease because monkeys
contract it nasally while humans are
infected through the digestive tract.
Whatever discoveries animal re
search may have contributed to, its
days of usefulness are over, members
of ARF said.
"While animal research might

have seemed useful in early 20th
century science, a lot has changed
since then. There are modern alter
natives such as computer modeling
and in vitro research that make the
use of animals unnecessary," Wagen
seil wrote in an email to the Daily.
Medical School officials' hopes
that new techniques will reduce ani
mal testing are tempered by doubts
about the effectiveness of alternative
options. "Of course our goal is to re
duce [the number of animals] wher
ever possible, but there will be re
search involving animals when there
are no alternatives," said Richter.
Several uninvolved students said
they recognize animal suffering as an
issue, but still are in favor of research
that produces positive effects.
"As a bioengineer, I think these
tests are necessary," said Dean Hu,a
first-year graduate student. "The
human benefits outweigh the animal
costs."
Freshman Becca Stanger agreed.
"On a basic level, yes it's inhu-

mane what we're doing to them." she
said. "But you also have to weigh the
outcomes in comparison to the sacri
fice. Of course it's hard to apply a
universal 'no it's wrong' or 'yes it's
good' to anything like that."
With public response lukewarm,
the ARF members said they are
aware that it will not be possible to
shut down the Research Animal Fa
cility. Instead, they aim to open the
minds of both those in power and ca
sual observers to the ethical prob
lems they see with such research.
"Transparency and accountability
for the research being done are our
main goals right now," Wagenseil
wrote to The Daily. "We've been pur
suing constructive dialogues with
those involved in animal research, but
we don't feel that our stance is being
given adequate consideration yet.
We're protesting so that we can fur
ther spur this dialogue and try to move
Stanford in the direction of reducing
the number of animals in research and
seriously pursuing alternatives."
