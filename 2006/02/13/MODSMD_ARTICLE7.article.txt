## Cheney shoots his fellow hunter 
### LYNN BREZOSKY ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Vice President Dick Cheney accidentally shot and
wounded a companion during a weekend quail hunting
trip in Texas, spraying the fellow hunter in the face and
chest with shotgun pellets.
Harry Whittington, a millionaire attorney from
Austin, was in stable condition in the intensive care unit
of a Corpus Christi hospital Sunday.
"He is stable and doing well. It was almost like he was
spending time with me in my living room," said hospital
administrator Peter Banko, who visited Whittington.
Banko said Whittington was in the intensive care unit
because his condition warranted it, but he didn't elabo
rate. Whittington sent word through a hospital official
that he would have no comment on the incident out of re
spect for Cheney.
The accident occurred Saturday at a ranch in south
Texas where the vice president and several companions
were hunting quail. It was not reported publicly by the
vice president's office for nearly 24 hours, and then only
alter it was reported locally by the Corpus Christi Caller-
Times on its Web site Sunday.
Katharine Armstrong, the ranch's owner,said Sunday
that Cheney was using a 28-gauge shotgun and that Whit
tington was about 30 yards away when he was hit in the
cheek, neck and chest.
Each of the hunters was wearing a bright orange vest
at the time, Armstrong told reporters at the ranch about
60 miles southwest of Corpus Christi. She said Whitting
ton was "alert and doing fine."
"He is very, very lucky that nothing seriously was in
jured," Sally Whittington said in a story in Sunday's on
line edition ofThe Dallas Morning News. She said her fa
ther was being observed because of swelling from some
of the welts on his neck.
"It looks like chicken pox. kind of," she said of her fa
ther's face.
Armstrong told The Associated Press emergency per
sonnel traveling with Cheney tended to Whittington be
fore an ambulance — routinely on call because of the
vice president's presence — took him to a hospital in
Kingsville. From there, Whittington was flown by heli
copter to Corpus Christi about 40 miles away.
Cheney's spokeswoman. Lea Anne Mcßride, said the
vice president met with Whittington at the hospital on
Sunday. Cheney "was pleased to see that he's doing fine

and in good spirits," she said.
Armstrong said she was watching from a car while
Cheney, Whittington and another hunter got out of the
vehicle to shoot at a covey of quail.
Whittington shot a bird and went to retrieve it in the
tall grass, while Cheney and the third hunter walked to
another spot and discovered a second covey.
Whittington "came up from behind the vice president
and the other hunter and didn't signal them or indicate to
them or announce himself," Armstrong said.
"The vice president didn't see him," she continued.
"The covey flushed and the vice president picked out a
bird and was following it and shot. And by god. Harry was
in the line of fire and got peppered pretty good."
Whittington has been a private practice attorney in
Austin since and has long been active in Texas Re
publican politics. He's been appointed to several state
boards, including when then-Gov. George W. Bush
named him to the Texas Funeral Service Commission.
Mcßride said the vice president's office did not tell re
porters about the accident Saturday because they were
deferring to Armstrong to handle the announcement of

what happened on her property. Armstrong called the
local paper about the incident on Sunday.
Armstrong, owner of the Armstrong Ranch where the
accident occurred, said Whittington was bleeding after
he was shot and Cheney was very apologetic.
"It broke the skin." she said of the shotgun pellets. "It
knocked him silly. But he was fine. He was talking. His
eyes were open. It didn't get in his eyes or anything like
that.
"Fortunately, the vice president has got a lot of med
ical people around him and so they were right there and
probably more cautious than we would have been," she
said. "The vice president has got an ambulance on call, so
the ambulance came."
Cheney is an avid hunter who makes annual trips to
South Dakota to hunt pheasants. He also travels fre
quently to Arkansas to hunt ducks, among other places.
Armstrong said Cheney is a longtime friend who
comes to the ranch to hunt about once a year and is "a
very safe sportsman." She said Whittington is a regular,
too, but she thought it was the first time the two men
hunted together.
