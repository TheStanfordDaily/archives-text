### RAVI NESSMAN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who has been
comatose since suffering a massive stroke more than
five weeks ago, was in critical but stable condition Sun
day following emergency abdominal surgery, the hospi
tal treating him said.
Though the surgery was successful. Sharon's doctors
said hope was fading for the premier to wake from his
coma. Since the stroke, Sharon has been hooked up to a
breathing tube. A feeding tube was inserted in his stom
ach on Feb. 1.
Sharon. 77, was rushed into surgery Saturday morn
ing after an abdominal scan revealed dead tissue in his
digestive system.
Doctors removed 20 inches, or one-third, of his large
intestine during the four-hour surgery, the seventh
Sharon has undergone since suffering the debilitating
stroke Jan. 4. The tissue death, or necrosis, was either
caused by infection or a drop in the blood supply to the
intestines, something common in comatose patients,
Sharon's doctors said.
"Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's condition stabilized
after surgery, but it is still described this morning as crit
ical and stable," Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital said in
a statement. "The prime minister is in the general inten
sive care unit."
Sharon's political heir, acting Prime Minister Ehud
Olmert, said Sunday he was relieved by the success of
the surgery and expressed his support for Sharon's sons,
Omri and Gilad.
"We are encouraged by the reports from Hadassah
Hospital regarding the health situation of the prime
minister following the operation yesterday," Olmert
said before the government's weekly Cabinet meeting.
"The whole government is sending a warm hug to Omri
and Gilad. who are standing by their father day and
night."
Sharon's sons have acquired guardianship over their
father since his stroke. Under Israeli law, any decision to
perform emergency surgery or to discontinue medical
treatment would require their consent, said Jonathan
Davies, a leading Israeli medical law expert.
