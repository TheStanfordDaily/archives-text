# Campus Life
## Commercial, Customized Love 
### 
Dear Saint Valentine,
My name is Uniquely Grad. You wouldn't believe
it, but despite being a grad student, I may have fallen
in love — I hope my adviser doesn't hold that against
me. Ever since the day that dinky, dainty damsel
walked into my life, I've felt a slightly higher secre
tion of pheromones from the various glands of my
body. No girl, before or since, has laughed at my poor
jokes. She did smile — well, maybe it was a sneer —
but nevertheless, it widened her beautiful, large eyes
(eye-lined, eye-shadowed and mascara-ed), parted
her lips (lined, glossed and lip-sticked) and displayed
her beautifully chiseled teeth (brushed, I guess).
My heart did skip a beat or two. But after a mo
mentary suspension of activities, the earth started
spinning back in its orbit, and I got back to my labo
ratory, continuing to push the frontier of technology
a little farther, as always. After that we became
friends, then close friends, closer friends, then just
friends, then closer than close friends and finally
closest friends.
It isn't easy, as you might know, for grad students
at Stanford to have non-academic discussions, let
alone have non-academic relations. The coalition of
Stanford professors against students' free time by
means of weekly homework, required reading, not
required-but-very-important-for-exain-reading,
practice problems, office hours, midterms, final
exams, candidacy examinations, research group
meetings, paper submissions, presentations, funding
reviews and everything else that make grad students
work at 110 percent efficiency.
But I still snuck in small, late night conversations
after a long day's work and watched late night movies
on weekends before important conference presenta
tions. And on one of those nights, it occurred to me
that these activities were highly unusual for grads.
Maybe — despite grads' immunization against it — I
might have been affected by the common, real world
infection of love. So, like I do for every other type of
information I need, I Googled love.
"Love is a divine feeling," a Web site said. "You
will hear violins playing." "Love is very much like
friendship, just feels a little sexier. You feel butter
flies in your stomach. You get sleepless nights. The
world changes, everything looks rosier."
Well, for now, I haven't experienced the divinity,
the noise I hear is not violin but my old mechanical
vacuum pump, I don't feel any sexier than I used to
and there are no butterflies in or around the vicinity
of my stomach. I am sleepless because of the ap
proaching midterms, and the world as 1 last saw it
was in its various shades of spectrum without any
special preference to red. Now, as the world cele
brates your day, I feel very awkward as I cannot write
poems or sing love songs. I have never played violin
and never touched a paintbrush. How can I ever de
scribe my soul's inspiration, heart's desire, ordinary
circumstances, but consequences so dire, heeding no
barriers, nudging the fire, and still be the ideal grad
student that I always aspire to be? Any explanation
or suggestions in the matter will be eternally appre
ciated.

Sincerely,
Uniquely Grad

Dear Uniquely Grad,
Saint Valentine has been laid off from his job. He
was not photogenic enough.
My name is Cupid. I used to be the God of love in
the Nonprofit Organization of Roman mythology,
but now 1 prefer my title of Vice President — Brand
Image — in the erotic love department of Commer
cialized-Customized-Love, a limited liability com
pany. I am sure that even you would have noticed
my images either in nude — for classic nude paint
ings and vintage nude photographs, call (800) ART
NUDE — or the silken loin cloth with bow and
quiver full of arrows. Warning: Children playing
with sharp objects like arrows may be harmful to
your cat's health.
Here is my advice to make your Valentine's Day
extraordinary, just like everyone else's. Don't even
attempt originality. The greeting cards, by the organ
izers and founders of the event, are more creative
than you could ever be.The seriousness, the naughti
ness, the passion in the poems by the poets on their
payroll are more "you" than you ever knew. The
heavenly chocolates by our sponsors, with some un
pronounceable name, are better than any food you
could ever concoct and the fragrance of red roses —
especially imported from Colombia — will do good
to counter your repulsive smell. Considering your
limited means, I would rather skip the diamond jew
elry and precision cut crystal glass option. Feel free
to visit our Web site or talk to one of our representa
tives to get more Valentine's Day ideas and please
keep your credit card number ready.
Luv, etc.

But I still snuck in small, late night conversations
after a long day's work and watched late night movies
on weekends before important conference presenta
tions. And on one of those nights, it occurred to me
that these activities were highly unusual for grads.
Maybe — despite grads' immunization against it — I
might have been affected by the common, real world
infection of love. So, like I do for every other type of
information I need, I Googled love.
"Love is a divine feeling," a Web site said. "You
will hear violins playing." "Love is very much like
friendship, just feels a little sexier. You feel butter
flies in your stomach. You get sleepless nights. The
world changes, everything looks rosier."
Well, for now, I haven't experienced the divinity,
the noise I hear is not violin but my old mechanical
vacuum pump, I don't feel any sexier than I used to
and there are no butterflies in or around the vicinity
of my stomach. I am sleepless because of the ap
proaching midterms, and the world as 1 last saw it
was in its various shades of spectrum without any
special preference to red. Now, as the world cele
brates your day, I feel very awkward as I cannot write
poems or sing love songs. I have never played violin
and never touched a paintbrush. How can I ever de
scribe my soul's inspiration, heart's desire, ordinary
circumstances, but consequences so dire, heeding no
barriers, nudging the fire, and still be the ideal grad
student that I always aspire to be? Any explanation
or suggestions in the matter will be eternally appre
ciated.

Sincerely,
Uniquely Grad

Dear Uniquely Grad,
Saint Valentine has been laid off from his job. He
was not photogenic enough.
My name is Cupid. I used to be the God of love in
the Nonprofit Organization of Roman mythology,
but now 1 prefer my title of Vice President — Brand
Image — in the erotic love department of Commer
cialized-Customized-Love, a limited liability com
pany. I am sure that even you would have noticed
my images either in nude — for classic nude paint
ings and vintage nude photographs, call (800) ART
NUDE — or the silken loin cloth with bow and
quiver full of arrows. Warning: Children playing
with sharp objects like arrows may be harmful to
your cat's health.
Here is my advice to make your Valentine's Day
extraordinary, just like everyone else's. Don't even
attempt originality. The greeting cards, by the organ
izers and founders of the event, are more creative
than you could ever be.The seriousness, the naughti
ness, the passion in the poems by the poets on their
payroll are more "you" than you ever knew. The
heavenly chocolates by our sponsors, with some un
pronounceable name, are better than any food you
could ever concoct and the fragrance of red roses —
especially imported from Colombia — will do good
to counter your repulsive smell. Considering your
limited means, I would rather skip the diamond jew
elry and precision cut crystal glass option. Feel free
to visit our Web site or talk to one of our representa
tives to get more Valentine's Day ideas and please
keep your credit card number ready.
Luv, etc.
Cupid
