PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) â€”
Gunfire erupted Monday during protests
over election results in Haiti and at least
one supporter of leading presidential can
didate Rene Preval was killed. Witnesses
said U.N. peacekeepers opened fire on the
crowd, but a U.N. spokesman denied that.
The protests erupted amid increasing
anger at vote counts from Tuesday's elec
tions showing that Preval, a former presi
dent and one-time protege of ousted
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, may
have fallen short of the 50 percent need
ed to win outright and avoid a runoff.
Witnesses said Jordanian U.N. peace
keepers opened fire on them, killing two
and wounding four.
David Wimhurst, a UN. spokesman in
Haiti, denied in a phone interview that
blue-helmeted peacekeepers who de
ployed across the capital opened fire.
Associated Press journalists saw the
body of a man in the street in the Tabarre
neighborhood. He was wearing a blood
soaked T-shirt bearing an image of
Preval. The body of the second victim was
not at the scene.
Hundreds of screaming demonstra
tors elsewhere stormed past U.N. peace
keepers into an upscale hotel in the hills
above Port-au-Prince and helicopters
landed on the roof to evacuate guests, in
cluding Nobel Peace Prize laureate
Desmond Tutu.
At church services Sunday, South
Africa had appealed for calm as election
results trickled in. No violence was re

ported at the Montana hotel, where elec
tion officials have announced results of
Tuesday's presidential and parliamentary
elections.
The electoral council had abruptly
canceled a press conference in the hotel
Sunday evening.
With some 90 percent of the vote
counted. Preval was leading with 48.7 per

cent of the vote, Haiti's electoral council
said on its Web site. His nearest opponent
was Leslie Manigat, another former pres
ident, who had 11.8 percent.
But of the 2.2 million ballots cast,
about 125,000 ballots have been declared
invalid because of irregularities, raising
suspicion among Preval supporters that
polling officials are trying to steal the

election.
Another 4 percent of the ballots were
blank but were still added into the total,
making it harder for Preval to obtain the
50 percent plus one vote needed.
The elections will replace an interim
government installed after Aristide was
ousted in a bloody rebellion two years
ago.
