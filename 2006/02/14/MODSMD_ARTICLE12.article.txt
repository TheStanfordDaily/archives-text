WASHINGTON (AP) —The Bush administration
on Monday pushed back hard against Katrina-response
criticism leveled by ex-disaster agency chief Michael
Brown and congressional investigators.
"I reject outright the suggestion that President Bush
was anything less than fully involved," said White
House homeland security adviser Frances Fragos
Townsend.
Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff "un
equivocally and strongly" rejected suggestions that his
agency was preoccupied with terror threats at the ex
pense of preparing for natural disasters.
Both spoke at a conference of state emergency man
agement directors in suburban Alexandria, Va.
Their rebuttal came as a Republican-written House
report blamed government-wide ineptitude for mishan
dling Hurricane Katrina relief. A report by Congress'
investigative arm, the Government Accountability Of
fice, reached similar conclusions and singled out
Chertoff for delays.
Both Townsend and Chertoff took swipes at Brown,
who resigned under pressure in September as head of
the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
There is no place for a lone ranger in emergency
management," said Chertoff, whose Department of
Homeland Security is FEMA's parent agency.
Brown testified before a Senate committee last week
that he issued repeated warnings to the White House
and DHS the day the hurricane struck, Aug. 29, that lev
ees had failed and New Orleans was seriously flooding.
He suggested that the White House and DHS had
dragged their feet. Bush and other federal officials have
said they did not know until the next day, Aug. 30, that
levees had been breached.
On Monday, Brown defended his performance.
"For Secretary Chertoff to claim that I failed to keep
him informed belies the numerous telephone calls and
e-mails between me and him prior to, during and after
landfall" of the storm. Brown said in an e-mail to The
Associated Press.
Brown also applauded congressional investigations
into the government's response.
Townsend, without naming names, criticized those at
FEMA she said had "become bitter" and lashed out
"trying to find someone else, anyone else, to blame."
