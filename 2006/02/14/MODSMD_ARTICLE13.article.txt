# V-Day Special
## I'M WITH CUPID 
### 
As a single, independent woman.
I am extremely embarrassed to
admit that Valentine's Day is
my favorite holiday. It feels sort of like
saying that although I am a strict vege
tarian. I enjoy strangling squirrels with
my bare hands and then laughing as 1
watch them bleed.There are numerous
people who — perhaps rightfully so —
subscribe to the belief that Valentine's
Day embodies everything trite, saccha
rin and contrived about romance in
America. And yet there is a large part
of me that still adores the festivities in
spite of all that — this may or may not
be the part of me that is strung out on
codeine because I am sick. Thus, I ded
icate this column to all the readers out
there who, like myself, will be without a
significant other on the most romantic
day of the year, but refuse to fall prey
to the pervasive cynicism that plagues
our campus. My Valentine's Day pres
ent to you: Stanford Single's 10 Best
Things About Valentine's Day.
10. Jesus Christ, there is candy
EVERYWHERE.
9. Even if you don't have a special
someone, you can still express your
love to the people you care about. For
example: your family, your friends,
your roommate, your RA, the people
who clean your house, the TA who re
fuses to return your drunk/high mid
night phone calls, strangers at the post
office, your therapist and varsity ath
letes. Just remember: a restraining
order means "I'm too shy to say I love
you, too."
8. Money can't buy you love, but it
can buy you an a cappella group sere
nade. Take the dough you would have
spent on a gift for someone else and
buy yourself some quality time with
the Mendicants. Look confused when
they tell you they don't perform lap
dances. Look appreciative when they
change their minds for $50.
7. You can skip lecture "on account
of a broken heart."
6. You can turn in your problem set
late "on account of a broken heart."
5. You can set fire to a squirrel "on
account of a broken heart."
4. Think of Feb. 14 as an opportuni
ty to take some alone time. In other
words, date yourself! Take yourself out
to a nice dinner at your favorite restau
rant. Be sure to order dessert — this is
the time to go all out. When you get
home, turn down the lights and put on
some quiet music. Open up a good bot
tle of Riesling, the one you save for
special occasions. Try to really get to
know yourself by asking questions
about your past, your fears and your
dreams. Drink more Riesling. Tell
yourself that you're really sexy, and
you've noticed the way you've been
looking at yourself in the mirror. Drink
more Riesling. Mention that you're a
virgin, and you want your first time to
be special, with someone you really
care about. Drink more Riesling. Say
that you think you're in love. Drink
more Riesling. Get really pissed off
when you refuse to put out.
3. Although we've all seen Chris
Hernandez's "balls" in the Bird Cage,
this is the only time of the year when
you will see large groups of women in
White Plaza saying things like "Come
see the Vagina Monologues!" and
"Buy a vagina pin!" Hehe. Vagina.
2. The legend of St. Valentine is in
spiration to us all! According to histo
rians, Bob Valentine was a priest who
was jailed for not worshipping Roman
gods. He made friends with the prison
guard's daughter, who was blind. Be
fore he was martyred, Valentine wrote
the girl a note, and when she opened it
her sight was restored. The note was
signed "from your Valentine." Thus we
celebrate St. Valentine's Day by taunt
ing the visually impaired and jailing
people who do not share our religious
convictions.
1. So much of our time these days is
consumed by the fear of the unknown,
with the world apparently on the brink
of destroying itself one way or another.
It is pretty nice to have one day devot
ed entirely to a silly thing like love.
Even us singletons can appreciate
something like that. Especially if we're
drinking Riesling and watching Cupid
use the squirrels as target practice.

Marie wants to make love, not war.
