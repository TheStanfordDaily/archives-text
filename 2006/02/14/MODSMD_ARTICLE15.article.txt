# Branner seeks Valentine's Day love at speed dating
## 
### MIMA MOHAMMED STAFF WRITER 
Branner Hall will be hosting their first annu
al speed dating event 8:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. today
— Valentine's Day — in Branner lounge. The
speed-dating event will have a $2.00 cover
charge, and all donations will be given to Casa
Hogar Orphanage in Oaxaca, Mexico. At the
event, males and females will have two minutes
each to speak to one another.
"So far about 40 people have responded to
say that they are coming," says Branner Hall
president Victoria Harman,a freshman.
"There was certainly much diversity in
personality, and four minutes is not enough

time to get to know someone, although it was
fun to meet new people," says senior Maria
Murcia who attended the Lyman speed dating
event last Friday "It's overwhelming to get to
know 20 people in such a short span of time."
Many Stanford students might have first
been introduced to the idea of speed dating
through the Hollywood film "Hitch," starring
Will Smith. However,the practice has its roots
in religion.
Los Angeles Rabbi Yaacov Deyo invented
speed dating in 1998 as a way for marriage-fo
cused young Jewish singles to meet, according
to many dating service Web sites. It was con
ceived as a way to ensure that Jewish singles
could meet each other in large cities where

they were outnumbered by non-Jews. It has
been made more popular by its use on televi
sion dating game shows.
Speed Dating has since lost its religious
connections and spread throughout the world
as a novel way for busy single people to meet
each other without any of the stigma associat
ed with traditional dating agencies — perfect
for the busy American lifestyle. In the United
States it is now an enormously popular phe
nomenon with speed dating agencies spread
ing throughout the country.
The basic idea is that an equal number of
men and women attend a venue; each person
spends between five and 10 minutes chatting
to each member of the opposite sex, and then

decides which people they would like to see
again, ITie organizers facilitate an exchange
of details if there is a match.
The original format involved men sitting
along one side of a long table with the women
lined up along the other, every few minutes
the men would shift down one space. Most
speed doting services still operate according
to this production-line approach.
"People should come because speed dat
ing is really sketchy under any other context
but fun on Valentine's Day,"says freshman
Jordan Gilchrist. "And it will just be some
thing really fun to do if you're not with some
one. Get rid of all the Stanford rumors that
you can't find love at Stanford."
