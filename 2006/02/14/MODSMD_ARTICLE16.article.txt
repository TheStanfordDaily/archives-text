## Editorial Rethinking love this Valentine's Day 
### 
It's that time of year again: Valentine's
Day, the holiday of love. Maybe you're a
freshman girl who got woken up at the
unearthly hour of 7:30 a.m. by one of your
male dormmates handing you a rose. Maybe
your sweetheart arranged for an a cappella
group to serenade you out of dreamland. Or
maybe you're depressed by the thought of
spending Valentine's Day a'ione—again.
While some people love Valentine's Day,
others hate it with a vengeance.This makes
Valentine's Day, surprisingly, one of the
more controversial holidays we celebrate.
On some level, Valentine's Day is nothing
more than an innocent holiday that roman
ticizes the ideals of courtly love. Surely no
one takes the imagery associated with
Valentine's Day—images of Cupid shooting
his arrows at star-struck lovers, or strawber
ry hearts dipped into melted chocolate—
too seriously?
Yet over the years, Valentine's Day has
turned into politically contested ground,
with various activist groups trying to reclaim
the holiday. With time, Valentine's Day has
become associated with the im perfections of
romantic love in the real world. Many real
life relationships, as it turns out, are not as
dreamy and wonderful as w.e would like
them to be. Relationships unfortunately are
often deeply flawed, and some even turn
hurtful and abusive.
At the same time, Valentine's Day is a
reminder to the singles of the world that
they are alone and unloved and should feel
bad about it. Movies, commercials, books
and magazines tell you over and over that
you can't be a truly happy and fulfilled in
dividual if you're single. They make it a
point to let you know that your single sta
tus is not one that is normal or desirable in
the long run.

There have been several responses to
the social norms perpetuated by Valen
tine's Day. For example, February 15 has
been designated Singles Awareness Day
(SAD) and, according to the SAD website,
is "the day that all of the single people can
proudly stand up and show that it is OKAY
to be single."
Another example of the Valentine's Day
counterculture is V Day, born in 1998 as an
outgrowth of Eve Ensler's award-winning
play "The Vagina Monologues." The goal of
V-Day is to raise awareness on sexual vio
lence against women and girls, in the hope of
eventually eradicating it. The Stanford com
munity has extended the concept of V-Day
into V-Week. While the main event of the
week is a student production of Ensler's
"Vagina Monologues", other events include
dialogue sessions and self defense work
shops for women.
The type of awareness that V-Week rais
es is crucial, especially given its proximity to
Valentine's Day. Holding V-Week right be
fore Valentine's Day significantly increases
its impact, because people are thinking
about relationships at this time of the year.
Given how serious some of the issues V-
Week raises are, anything that can increase
its visibility should be put into place.
However, some people may find all this
political wrangling over Valentine's Day to
be distasteful. Isn't the holiday supposed to
be a day to celebrate love and be happy?
Why ruin it with thoughts of singlehood and
loneliness, rape and domestic violence?
While such cynicism over Valentine's Day
can be easily taken to an extreme, we believe
that modern conceptions of romantic love
must be tempered with a dose of reality. Be-
sides, events like SAD and V-Week
are not incompatible with a happy,
celebratory Valentine's Day. When
you think about it, Valentine's Day is
a celebration of love, but one cannot
fully understand the meaning of love
without considering the whole spec
trum of human relationships.
By raising awareness on some of
the negative aspects of relationships,
events like SAD and V-Week give us
a chance to reflect on what makes a
good relationship, and make us that
much more conscious of what we are
celebrating. Hopefully, these events
will also generate debates on gender
stereotypes perpetuated by Valen

tine's Day. People should be able to
celebrate their love whatever form it
takes.
We believe that the livefy debates
surrounding Valentine's Day will
serve to reclaim the holiday for
everyone—couples, singles, and
everyone who might have been side
lined by traditional conceptions of
the holiday. Valentine's Day ought to
sharpen our ideas about what we
mean by love, and challenge us to
make the holiday broader and more
inclusive.
So whether you love or hate
Valentine's Day, remember that you
have the power to make it what you
want it to be. Valentine's Day should
be an affirmation of what it means to
love and to be loved. Reflect on the
relationships in your lives, decide
how you're going to celebrate the
holiday and enjoy.

The type of awareness that V-Week rais
es is crucial, especially given its proximity to
Valentine's Day. Holding V-Week right be
fore Valentine's Day significantly increases
its impact, because people are thinking
about relationships at this time of the year.
Given how serious some of the issues V-
Week raises are, anything that can increase
its visibility should be put into place.
However, some people may find all this
political wrangling over Valentine's Day to
be distasteful. Isn't the holiday supposed to
be a day to celebrate love and be happy?
Why ruin it with thoughts of singlehood and
loneliness, rape and domestic violence?
While such cynicism over Valentine's Day
can be easily taken to an extreme, we believe
that modern conceptions of romantic love
must be tempered with a dose of reality. Be-
sides, events like SAD and V-Week
are not incompatible with a happy,
celebratory Valentine's Day. When
you think about it, Valentine's Day is
a celebration of love, but one cannot
fully understand the meaning of love
without considering the whole spec
trum of human relationships.
By raising awareness on some of
the negative aspects of relationships,
events like SAD and V-Week give us
a chance to reflect on what makes a
good relationship, and make us that
much more conscious of what we are
celebrating. Hopefully, these events
will also generate debates on gender
stereotypes perpetuated by Valen

tine's Day. People should be able to
celebrate their love whatever form it
takes.
We believe that the livefy debates
surrounding Valentine's Day will
serve to reclaim the holiday for
everyone—couples, singles, and
everyone who might have been side
lined by traditional conceptions of
the holiday. Valentine's Day ought to
sharpen our ideas about what we
mean by love, and challenge us to
make the holiday broader and more
inclusive.
So whether you love or hate
Valentine's Day, remember that you
have the power to make it what you
want it to be. Valentine's Day should
be an affirmation of what it means to
love and to be loved. Reflect on the
relationships in your lives, decide
how you're going to celebrate the
holiday and enjoy.
