# Lament of the Valentine-less
## 
### 
Cynics often say that Valentine's Day
only occurs so that companies like
Hallmark and Ghirardelli can make
an easy buck. Romantics (a.k.a. people who
are in committed relationships), on the other
hand, say that it is a day to eel ebrate love and
that it doesn't matter if you receive choco
lates and roses as long as you get to spend
precious time with that specia I someone. (In
sert either "gag" or "aww" here, depending
on your relationship status.) I say that Valen
tine's Day exists only to rub singles' faces in
the fact that they are. in fact, si ill single.
Being single is not necessarily a bad thing
most of the year. You're free to go out danc
ing with the girls whenever you feel like it
and you don't have to worry about making
your significant other jealous when you
meet up with a coworker for lunch. Valen
tine's Day. however, is an exception to the
rule. If eating chocolate and watching chick
flicks with your girlfriends were really the
ideal way to spend Feb. 14, Blockbuster and
Coldstone would be the ones taking reserva
tions months in advance instead of expen
sive French restaurants and cheap motels.
No, everybody wants somebody on
Valentine's Day. You can go on and say
whatever you want about being independ
ent, not wanting to be tied down, blah blah
blah...but those excuses just don't cut it
today, because today isn't a typical day. Just
the thought of your best friend getting a
dozen roses from her new boyfriend curls
your fingers into fists and witnessing that
ugly guy you pass on the street every day
sharing a romantic dinner with his girl makes
you cringe. It's not that you dislike them —
nor is it the fact that PDA. is an especially un

pleasant sight when the perpetrators appear
to have just surfaced from the depths of the
ugly pool — but seeing people who are so
obviously and sickeningly in love only re
minds you of the fact that you aren't.
This is not a vendetta against love
(though, if you catch me on the right day, I'm
sure I couid make that happen). Actually,
any criticism on this subject is futile, because
chances are good that even the biggest cynic
will sooner or later fall in love and hence re
nege on all that was said during those four
o'clock-in-the-morning conversations about
how much relationships suck. When hor
mones attack, everybody melts into a lovey
dovey mushball.so no one — with the possi
ble exception of my emotionless I-Hum lec
turer from fall quarter — has the right to dis
parage the lucky people who just happen to
have what everybody else secretly wishes to
have. For all you know, tomorrow you could
be the one cuddling with your better half
during the dull moments in econ lecture
(that's a lot of cuddling) and driving your
classmates to leave as many empty seats as
they possibly can between them and your lit
tle lovefest.

But tomorrow is irrelevant — it's
today that's the issue. Today is
Valentine's Day. Today is the day
when every girl wants to get roses
and every guy wants to get some. So
why do so many people spend the
day wallowing in their singleness in
stead of getting (or at least trying to
get) what they really want?
The problem is that Valentine's
Day acts as a magnifying glass. It is
built up so much that even the tiniest
flaw is exaggerated to the point that
it can ruin the entire day — whether
you are spending it on your own or
with a special someone. If your
Valentine's Day depends on some
body else, you can't help but notice
every trivial mistake he makes, like
getting you pink instead of red roses.
By the end of the night, you may

even wish that you were single so
that you wouldn't have to deal with
the stress of having such high, unmet
expectations. Meanwhile, all the sin
gles are sitting on their couches feel
ing sorry for themselves and taking a
bite out of every piece of chocolate
in the box, dreaming about the per
fect Valentine's Day as Marvin Gaye
plays in the background.
So basically, Valentine's Day is a
lose-lose situation. If you're single, it
makes you hate your life. If you're
not, it makes you wish you were. But
still, every February you imagine
that this will be the year that you will
meet the perfect person with whom
you will share the perfect day — the
year when everything will go exactly
as planned.
Here's to hoping this is that year.

If you can figure out a way to send
flowers and/or candy through e-mail,
send them to Stephanie at

tine's Day!
