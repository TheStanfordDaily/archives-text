# FDA PROTEST
## 
### 
Protestors demonstrating against
the FDA policy that bars gay men
from donating blood held signs and
rallied in front of the blood drive van
at noon in White Plaza yesterday.
The policy in question dates back
to the HIV/AIDS epidemic of the
1980s. According to the American
Red Cross, a male who has had sexu
al contact with another male since
1977, or anyone who has had sexual
contact with anyone meeting the
prior description, is prohibited from
donating blood.
Demonstrators said their aim was
not to protest blood donation itself,
but rather to spread word of a rule
that makes "second-class citizens"
out of people who "want to go help
someone else."
"Our main goal was not to disrupt
the blood drive," said Bharat Venkat,
a junior.
While gay men were the largest de
mographic of HI V/AIDS victims when
the regulation was enacted in 1983, that
is no longer the case, Venkat said.
"The problem with that rule is that
the largest population with
HIV/AIDS is people of color," he
added. "It's hypocritical and doesn't
make sense with the current context."
The demonstration was peaceful,
and workers at the blood drive were
generally sympathetic. According to
Venkat,"a lot of people were shocked
and didn't know this was going on."
