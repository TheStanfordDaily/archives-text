# Thoughts on hurricane nomenclature
## 
### 
It's really too had that the Gulf Coast hur
ricane was named Katrina, because Katri
na is actually a very nice name.The name
has both a spunky element and a lilting qual
ity to its sound and girls who have the name
tend to be accomplished and confident. It
should, therefore, be no surprise that there
are many parents out there smacking their
foreheads for thinking that such a pleasant
sounding name would be free from horrible
associations with a natural disaster. Now
their children will have to live the rest of
their lives under the specter of gloominess
and persecution. I might even have named
my future daughter Katrina, but now I'm
pretty sure that the name won't be in vogue
for at least another generation.
It wouldn't matter so much with storms
like Ivan or Claudette or Otto or Wilma,
since those were never nice-sounding
names in the first place. If your name is
Otto, you probably already had self-es
teem issues before the hurricane came
along. I mean...Otto. It sounds like some
thing I'd name a small sausage-shaped
dog. And if your name is Wilma — well,
you're named after a character from"The
Flintstones," so you're practically bound
to be confused regardless.
Naming hurricanes is a pretty unneces
sary practice when you consider its extrane
ous effects on the self-esteem of countless
children. For the last several months, all the
little Katrinas of the world have been sub

ject to constant bombardments of procla
mations such as: "Katrina has killed over a
thousand people" and"the city was left dev
astated after Katrina passed through."
Every one of these little girls will think that
whenever she visits a coastal city, she will
leave thousands of dead people and col
lapsed buildings in her wake.
Eventually, some five-year-old named
Katrina will get asked "Destroyed any cities
lately?" as a joke, driving her under her
blankets to sob at what is but the beginning
of a series of anxiety-filled nights. Hearing
that "the Bush administration has failed to
deal with the problem of Katrina" will make
her think that she is above the law and al
lowed to do anything she pleases. This will
lead to a series of increasingly egregious
criminal acts, culminating in an addiction to
cocaine and induction into a drug rehabili
tation clinic at the age of 19.
There have been psychological studies
on how names and acronyms formed by ini
tials affect self-esteem, but it'd be interest

ing to see just how much psychological
damage derives from having your name as
sociated with a natural disaster or catastro
phe. Either way, we should probably stop
christening hurricanes, tsunamis, and other
tropical storms with actual names and
begin making up completely new words to
designate such events. Hurricane Ooga
booga is probably a little far-fetched, but I
think if we gathered together a bunch of
fantasy and science-fiction authors, we
could come up with hundreds of oddball
names in no time at all.
After all, these people make up weird
names for a living.They probably have longs
lists hidden in the closet with strange, other
worldly names for their next books. Half of
these names probably have some sort of his
torical connotation with or symbolism for
evil or hell, since it's cool to have metaphor
ical connections with evil for villains — that
would be even more helpful for irrevocably
labeling tropical storms as evil forces, rather
than associating them with imperfect but
generally nice human beings.
Besides, you have to admit that Hurri
cane Sauron or Hurricane Vader sounds
way more badass than Hurricane Katrina.
