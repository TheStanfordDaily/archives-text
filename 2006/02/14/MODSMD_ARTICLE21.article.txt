## Animal rights are not protected 
### MATTHEW LIEBMAN 
In an article in yesterday's paper,"Students Protest for
Animals," Ruthann Richter claimed that animals in
laboratories are covered by extensive legal protec
tions, ensuring a happy and comfortable life for animal
subjects. These regulations, however, fail to prevent basic
suffering.
First, these regulations do not restrict the actual ex
periments that a researcher may conduct. If a researcher
found scientific merit in torturing infant monkeys, testing
pain thresholds in cats or kicking dogs to test their reac
tions to abuse, no law would prohibit such actions. The
Animal Welfare Act does not permit the government to
regulate "the performance of actuali research or experi
mentation by a research facility as determined by such a
research facility." Even the regulations that require the
provision of anesthesia or the search for alternatives can
be subverted by a mere assertion of "scientific necessity,"
according to this same Act.
Second, the Act excludes birds, rats and mice from its
definition of "animal," thereby exempting them from

even the minimal protections that the act provides. Be
cause these animals make up 95 percent of the animals
used in experimentation, the vast majority of tests con
ducted on laboratory animals are unregulated. Stanford,
for example, uses tens of thousands of rats and mice, as
well as owls. The University also refuses to disclose the
number of animals it uses at the Research Animal Facili
ty-
Third, the regulations that do exist are drastically
under-enforced. Federal funding granted to the U.S. De
partment of Agriculture for the enforcement of the Ani
mal Welfare Act is minimal. Even when regulatory and
accreditation agencies, such as the Association for the
Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
Care (AAALAC), visit laboratories to inspect animal
welfare, the labs are notified in advance of the impending
visit â€” essentially giving them a chance to hide any vio
lations.
Fourth, Stanford has a history of noncompliance with
animal welfare standards. When the campus laboratories
