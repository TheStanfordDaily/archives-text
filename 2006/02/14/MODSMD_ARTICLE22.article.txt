The cartoon controversy gripping the Muslim world
and Europe has produced appalling behavior on
both sides. The rhetoric that has emerged from
freedom of speech advocates and incensed Muslims has
been instinctive, but ultimately disingenuous. Both of
them have failed to recognize the real problem that these
cartoons signify and address it on its proper terms.This is
not solely about one society's right to satirize nor is it
about the faithfuls' right to preserve their tradition.
There are already has precedents for that. This is about
the new guise of intolerance that is looking to sneak past
mainstream society's "acceptable" self-censorship.
Let's start with the protesters. The overwrought
drama that has unfolded in the Muslim world reflects po
litical posturing just as much as spontaneous indignation.
Governments in the Muslim world, as always, have found
the cartoons a convenient diversion for releasing domes
tic frustrations, but have proved unable to stop organized
mobs from turning legitimate protest into rioting. For ex
ample, no protests in Syria happen without the govern

ment allowing it. Moreover, most of the peaceable
marchers in front of the Danish embassy in Beirut had no
intention of causing mayhem until a gang suddenly start
ed pushing and flinging petrol bombs. Muslim religious
leaders across the spectrum have widely condemned the
violence — sometimes even throwing themselves in
front of crowds — but that has evaded the global public
eye.
Sadly, the media has become a vehicle for observing
and perpetuating the extremists' successes, even if the
numbers participating — a few hundred in most cases —
represent a negligible fraction of their society's popula
tions. Moreover, the cameras spotlight the most violent
and daring placards to lend sensationalism to the pro
ceedings.
Ibis has lead to scenarios both alarming and bemus
ing. ITie Palestinian gunmen who stormed the European
Commission offices in Gaza were hardly seizing the
compound so much as candidly posing before it. It was a
classic act of dramatic defiance staged for Western
