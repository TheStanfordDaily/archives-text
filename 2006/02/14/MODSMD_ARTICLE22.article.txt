### AHMED ASHRAF 
The cartoon controversy gripping the Muslim world
and Europe has produced appalling behavior on
both sides. The rhetoric that has emerged from
freedom of speech advocates and incensed Muslims has
been instinctive, but ultimately disingenuous. Both of
them have failed to recognize the real problem that these
cartoons signify and address it on its proper terms.This is
not solely about one society's right to satirize nor is it
about the faithfuls' right to preserve their tradition.
There are already has precedents for that. This is about
the new guise of intolerance that is looking to sneak past
mainstream society's "acceptable" self-censorship.
Let's start with the protesters. The overwrought
drama that has unfolded in the Muslim world reflects po
litical posturing just as much as spontaneous indignation.
Governments in the Muslim world, as always, have found
the cartoons a convenient diversion for releasing domes
tic frustrations, but have proved unable to stop organized
mobs from turning legitimate protest into rioting. For ex
ample, no protests in Syria happen without the govern

ment allowing it. Moreover, most of the peaceable
marchers in front of the Danish embassy in Beirut had no
intention of causing mayhem until a gang suddenly start
ed pushing and flinging petrol bombs. Muslim religious
leaders across the spectrum have widely condemned the
violence — sometimes even throwing themselves in
front of crowds — but that has evaded the global public
eye.
Sadly, the media has become a vehicle for observing
and perpetuating the extremists' successes, even if the
numbers participating — a few hundred in most cases —
represent a negligible fraction of their society's popula
tions. Moreover, the cameras spotlight the most violent
and daring placards to lend sensationalism to the pro
ceedings.
Ibis has lead to scenarios both alarming and bemus
ing. ITie Palestinian gunmen who stormed the European
Commission offices in Gaza were hardly seizing the
compound so much as candidly posing before it. It was a
classic act of dramatic defiance staged for Western
media consumption, but all it re
quired was a few teenagers with
nothing better to do than dabble in
vandalism and play martyr for the
audience. There was deep indigna
tion across the Muslim world, to be
sure, but it is the extremists and the
irresponsible who have, once again,
upstaged everyone else.
The role-playing extends to the
Europeans, too. Jyllands-Posten, the
newspaper that first printed the car
toons, cited Denmark's long tradi
tion of unrestrained satire. That ar
gument fell flat when it emerged that
the paper had earlier rejected car
toons of Jesus Christ because they
were "offensive." No one should ad
vocate press censorship — but let's
not condone double standards and
selective instance either. Press free
dom already has limits in place.
When a few newspapers in the Mus
lim world make the very wrong deci
sion to publish anti-Semitic content,
it should be (and is) loudly con
demned. Anti-Semitic claims, such as
denial of the Holocaust, are illegal in
much of Europe, but somehow all of
a sudden, being anti-Muslim repre
sents a long fought for freedom of
expression. With the discrediting of
racism within public discourse, pick
ing on Islam has become the new
cover for respectable discrimination
in increasingly intolerant Europe.
Ignore the halo of blasphemy and
look at the cartoons for what they
are — ugly racial stereotypes that
should alarm everyone The context
cannot be forgotten either — the

Jyllands-Posten supports far-right
candidates who idealize a "Denmark
for the Danes" and belittle Muslim
immigrants whom they largely dis
trust and dislike. Unlike the United
States, which has had much experi
ence in dealing with a multiplicity of
ethnicities, Europe is a newcomer
and it shows.
The lessons are clear. Europe
needs to confront its self destructive
hypocrisy —it continues to ghet
toize, subdue and distress its Mus
lims, even as it demands that they
fully assimilate. How can they inte
grate, European Muslims ask, when
many of them can't get a job because
of their skin color and foreign
sounding name or if they are con
stantly made to feel like they do not
belong (and not just in poor newspa
pers with poorer taste)? Obviously,
the process will take much time and
effort — historically victimized im
migrant groups in the United States,
whether Irish, Italian or Jewish, took
many decades to be fully accepted.
Despite their indignation, Mus
lims need to stop their violent re
sponses to such aggravation and do
what the Quran asked of Prophet
Mohammed: "show forgiveness,
speak for justice and avoid the igno
rant," as well as discredit the extrem
ists who damaged their reputation
far more than any cartoon ever
could achieve. Journalist Robert
Fisk sums up the whole episode
quite well when he terms this
episode the "childishness of civiliza
tions" — clearly, some of the world's
oldest societies still have much
growing up to do.
