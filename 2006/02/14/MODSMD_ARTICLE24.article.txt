## Speed Demons Cal is going down in two weeks, no question. LAUREN COSTELLA, junior 
### ALEXIS ANN PETERSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Clad in fast suits, No. 3 California overpowered No. 6 Stan
ford 169-131 on Saturday in the final dual meet of the
women's swimming and diving season.
The Golden Bears (11-0, 7-0 Pac-10) won nine of the 16
events against the Cardinal (13-2,4-2), sweeping the relay events
and swimming to the conclusion of a perfect regular season.
Although racing etiquette usually dictates that either both
teams wear fast suits, or neither wears them at all, the agree
ment was not in effect this weekend. The Cardinal — while
unprepared for Cal's racing attire — did not let the surprise
interfere with their racing mindset.
"We weren't going to change for them," said Stanford jun
ior Lauren Costella, who placed second in the 1 .(KM) free with
a time of 9:56.47. "We were going to do what we had decided
and trained to do."
Head coach Lea Maurer agreed that the suits played to
Cal's advantage.
"[Men's head coach] Skip Kenney has said he estimates
the advantage of fast suits to be about one second per 100 me
ters," she said.
In addition to the respective differences in suiting, the Car
dinal also had to contend with Cal's impressive record.
"I think we showed a lot of class today." Costella said.
"One of the hardest things to do is to swim against a team that
is doing well. It would have been so easy to get discouraged,
hut we just kept coming."
Sophomore swimmer Brooke Bishop won Ihe 50 free in a
pool-record 22.58 seconds, breaking Jenny Thompson's 14-
year-old record of 22.87. Bishop narrowly missed making his
tory a second time with her victory in the 100 back, which was
0.08 seconds slower than Catherine Fox's standing pool
record, set in 1997.

Senior swimmer Dana Kirk led the Cardinal effort with
victories in three events (100 and 200 fly, 2(H) IM), while jun
ior diver Cassidy Krug secured two more wins (one and
three-meter) for Stanford.
Although Stanford made a run at Cal with three consecu
tive victories — Kirk in the 200 fly. Bishop in the 50 free and
Krug in one-meter diving — the Bears answered back in
stronger form with a four-event hot streak.
Ultimately, Stanford's loss to Cal this weekend seems to
have fueled the Cardinal's desire to win in championship rac
ing.
"Cal is going down in two weeks, no question," Costella
said in reference to the upcoming Pac- 10s. "We'll be bringing
our 'A' game, so they better have more than they had today
because we are definitely bringing more than that."
The Stanford divers, who claimed the top four spots in the
one-meter event, are looking to make their dives in competi

tion as flawless as their dives in practice.
"We still didn't do everything perfectly, but that is what we
are going to have to do," said sophomore diver Katie Lampe,
who finished second in both one- and three-meter diving.
"We competed better than we have previously, and that's
kind of the main thing we've been working on."
Maurer is optimistic about how her team will fare in Pac
10s. which are scheduled to run Feb. 22-25 in Long Beach,
Calif, for the swimmers, and Feb. 23-25 in Federal Way, Wash.,
for the divers.
What it will take to secure victories at the championship
meets is actually quite simple, say the athletes.
"Our coach keeps telling us to play the game," Lampe said.
"Whoever wants it more is going to win. We have to want it."
Even simpler is what the team needs to do from a training
standpoint between now and Pac-10s.
"Rest," Maurer said.
