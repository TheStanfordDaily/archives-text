## String of wins puts men at 4-0 Card get to work early, defeat Anteaters handily for a final score of 6-1 
### BEN BACKES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After its two biggest wins in recent
memory, Stanford men's tennis could
have easily overlooked UC-Irvine.The
Anteaters (2-5) came to the Farm with
a losing record, hut the Cardinal (4-0)
never let up the pressure, posting a 6-1
victory to extend their season-opening
win streak to four matches.
Friday, in their first night match of
the year — and in front of a large stu
dent-dominated home crowd — the
Cardinal showed that they remained
focused after moving up in the rank
ings.
Stanford — who recently moved up
five places to No. 7 after defeating
Southern California and UCLA last
weekend — got off to a good start
against Irvine, winning the doubles
point for the first time in three matches.
Senior KC Corkery teamed with
junior James Pade to quickly defeat
Mustafa Ulukan and Trevor Dobson at
the No. 1 doubles position, 8-I.The No.
5 Cardinal doubles tandem rolled to
victory as it bounced back from last
week's loss to the Bruins.
Sophomore Phil Kao and freshman
Blake Muller then clinched the dou
bles point for Stanford with an 8-4 vic
tory over Aaron Fllis and Andrei Rad
ulescu at the No. 2 doubles spot. Kao
picked up a victory in his first doubles
appearance of the season as the Cardi
nal coaching staff continued to tinker
with the doubles lineup.
Kao also ended a two match losing
streak in singles when he defeated
Alex Sundling,6-1,6-7,1-o.The sopho
more is now 2-2 in dual match play this
year.
The first man to finish his singles
match was Pade, Stanford's No. 2
player, who added another dominat
ing performance to an already im

pressive season.
Pade, whose dual match singles
record now stands at 4-0, overwhelmed
his opponent while losing only one
game. After a powerful display of aces
and winners, the final result was a deci
sive 6-0,6-1 victory.
Another Cardinal who has yet to
lose a singles match this year is junior
James Wan. who defeated Andrei Rad
ulescu in the No. 3 singles position, 6-1,
6-1. Wans career singles record at the
Farm improves to 47-9.
Despite playing against a team
whose reputation does not come close
to Stanford's, Wan did not have a prob
lem getting ready for the match.
" Ihe person I played had been
playing No. I singles for the last four
matches,so I knew I had to go out there
and stay focused to win," he said.
After the match, the junior empha
sized the importance of being prepared
for every opponent.
"Irvine is just as dangerous as the
next team," Wan said. "One of [our]
goals this year was to go undefeated at
home, which of course includes the
NCAA Championship."

Stanford hosts this year's NCAA
tournament in May.
Corkery, who dropped both of his
matches against UCLA last week, re
bounded to win matches at the No. 1
singles and doubles positions against
the Anteaters. He defeated Ulukan in
singles by a score of 6-4,6-1.
Muller, who was victorious in sin
gles against USC and UCLA.extended
his winning streak to three with a 6-1,6-
3 victory over Ellis at the No. 3 singles
spot.
Sophomore Chris Rasmussen, who
clinched Stanford's victory against
UCLA, dropped his singles match to
Shimpei Suzuki, losing 4-6,7-5,1-0.
Stanford cruised to victory despite
the continued absence of injured
freshman Matt Bruch, the fourth
ranked singles player in the country.
The Cardinal, whose lineup has been
constantly adjusted, will likely contin
ue to see changes as players return
from injury and as the coaching staff
continues to experiment with doubles
combinations.
