# MEN'S GOLF
## Men open spring season in Hawaii Stanford moves from 11fh-to fifth-place at Invite, providing glimpse of solid future 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES STAFF WRITER 
With an uncharacteristic third-round upswing, the Stanford men's
golf team finished fifth last week at the Hawaii-hosted Hilo Intercol
legiate Invitational in Kona, Hawaii. In the fall, the squad often suf
fered from inconsistent play, but the Cardinal shirked that trend in a
strong spring start.
"The patience we showed is especially exciting to me because of
our history this season," head coach Conrad Ray said. "We've been
starting off pretty well and then having a mediocre final round, but
we didn't have that this weekend."
The Cardinal were in 11 th place entering Friday's final round, but
they received strong performances all around, including junior Matt
Savage (68, three under par), sophomore Rob Grube (70, one under
par) and freshman Daniel Lim (an even-par 71). In total, the team
had a three-under-par 281 to claim fifth.
"We're slowly learning how to put together three good rounds,"
Savage said. "We still have a ways to go, as evidenced by our slow
start, but this was a good start to putting the rounds together."
The Cardinal had been in 16th
after Wednesday's first round, with
an even-par 284. Grube, along with
three others, posted an even-par 71.
The squad then shot a poor nine
over-par 293 in Thursday's second
round but still moved up five spots.
Ray was pleased by the strength
of.the entire team, but the perform
ances of Savage and freshman
Dodge Kemmer especially caught
his eye. Both had an even-par first
round, while Kemmer pulled ahead
on another even-par in the second.
Savage's three-under-par final
round, however, left him leading
the Cardinal individually and fin
ishing 17th overall while Kemmer
placed 29th.
"Both of them took a good ap
proach to the off-season, figuring out
what went poorly in the fall and what
went well and then working on the
weaknesses," Ray said. "I think that
they're both hitting the ball much
better."
The team's usual leader, Grube,
had a difficult three days. He posted a
five-over-par 76 in the second round
and finished with a 218 total for 39th
place.
"I think it was [an off-day for
him,]" Ray said."But I think in Rob's
case it's just going to motivate him
that much more to prepare for the
rest of the season."
Preparation over the recent off
season contributed greatly to the
squad's overall solid finish. The Car
dinal not only improved on tech
nique but also built upon the confi
dence they gained from a third-place
finish at the Collegiate Match Play
Championship in November.
"By playing as strongly as we did
in the final round, it shows how we've
really moved in the right direction
with our fitness and the maturity of
our team," junior Zack Miller said.
The men also have improved
upon course management. A chal
lenge was turned into an opportunity
last week when winds made the
Waikoloa Village Golf Course much
more difficult than usual.
"The guys were able to cope with
[the wind,]" Ray said. "They under
stood that they needed to control the
shots in front of them, and they took
advantage of the opportunities when
they got them."
Eluding the Cardinal in Hawaii
were No. 3 Georgia Tech, No. 2 Okla
homa State and Pac-1() rival No. 35
Southern California. The schools fin
ished first, second and third, respec
tively.
"I think we feel like we can be
competitive any day out there." Ray
said. "It's just a matter of having all
five guys contribute, and I think we
were able to see that this week."
The squad will have more chances
to challenge their competition this
spring at the upcoming Ashworth
Collegiate Invitational, Feb. 27-28 in
West Lake Village, Calif. For now,
though, the Cardinal will continue
practicing.
"I think we just need to keep
going strong with the plan we have
going now," Miller said. "We're tak
ing the right steps to be successful â€”
it's just a matter of if we can perform
when it really counts."
