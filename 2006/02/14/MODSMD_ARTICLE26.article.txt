# MEN'S GOLF
## Men open spring season in Hawaii Stanford moves from 11fh-to fifth-place at Invite, providing glimpse of solid future 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES STAFF WRITER 
With an uncharacteristic third-round upswing, the Stanford men's
golf team finished fifth last week at the Hawaii-hosted Hilo Intercol
legiate Invitational in Kona, Hawaii. In the fall, the squad often suf
fered from inconsistent play, but the Cardinal shirked that trend in a
strong spring start.
"The patience we showed is especially exciting to me because of
our history this season," head coach Conrad Ray said. "We've been
starting off pretty well and then having a mediocre final round, but
we didn't have that this weekend."
The Cardinal were in 11 th place entering Friday's final round, but
they received strong performances all around, including junior Matt
Savage (68, three under par), sophomore Rob Grube (70, one under
par) and freshman Daniel Lim (an even-par 71). In total, the team
had a three-under-par 281 to claim fifth.
"We're slowly learning how to put together three good rounds,"
Savage said. "We still have a ways to go, as evidenced by our slow
start, but this was a good start to putting the rounds together."
