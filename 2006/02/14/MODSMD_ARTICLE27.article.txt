# Fantasy leagues kill true love
## 
### 
As a bona fide optimist, I
have only a few regrets in
life: betting on Southern
California to win the
Rose Bowl, trusting my friends with
"Screw Your Roommate," and sign
ing up to be a columnist with the
Daily.
Few of my regrets, however,
come close to one still lingering
from my junior year of high school.
1 was a happy sports fan then, un
concerned with too many statistics
and never having heard of O.P.S. I
watched sports for the shear enjoy
ment of it. Sure, I had a vested inter
est in seeing my home teams win,
but the only statistic that mattered
was the win-loss record.
But my friend ended all of that
with five infamous words, "Wanna
join my fantasy league?"
I didn't put much thought into it
and quickly jumped at the opportu
nity. I figured it would be a fun and
easy way to prove to all of my friends
just how intelligent a sports fan 1 re
ally was. So I did my research and
eventually drafted my own "Dream
Team" of the NBAs best, with the
expectation of easily bringing home
the league championship, and thus
my friends' respect as well.
Just two weeks into the season,
I was shocked to find myself in last
place. 1 tried shopping Kobe
Bryant on the trading block to find
myself a stronger center, but no
one would take Rasheed Wallace
in the package. So by season's end.
my hopes had been dashed as my
friends made me the victim of their
scorn.
With baseball season rapidly ap
proaching, I knew exactly what to
do. After dedicating an entire week
to researching stats and listening to
ESPN Radio, I assembled a solid
lineup to go with the greatest pitch
ing rotation ever collected. Each
night throughout the summer 1 vis
ited Yahoo's website to check the
progress of players 1 otherwise
cared absolutely nothing about. 1
stayed up late to ensure that Mar
lins pitcher Josh Beckett would pick
up that win, that Braves outfielder
Andruw Jones would draw that
extra walk and that Yankees catcher
Jorge Posada would help boost my
team's aggregate batting average.
Come playoff time, I had se
cured first place. And I thought I
was happy â€” but at what cost?
I had betrayed my Dodger-blue
blood by drafting Giants players
and in turn rooting for the San
Francisco team, or "The Hated
Ones," as 1 had grown up calling
them. 1 found myself rooting
against my favorite teams on cer
tain nights, so long as my rotisserie
fantasy team would benefit in ef
fect.
Even when I was sitting in the
stands in Anaheim or downtown
Los Angeles, I would be willing to
deal with an opponent's success. 1
just wasn't willing to deal with the
body shots resulting from my loud
