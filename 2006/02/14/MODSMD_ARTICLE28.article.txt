# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Weekend sees highs and lows East Coast tournament ends with mixed results for struggling squad 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
It was an up-and-down weekend for the Stanford
men's volleyball team, who split a non-conference
tournament in Springfield, Mass.
The Cardinal won on Friday against Springfield
College to put together their first winning streak of
the season, but they dropped their second match to
No. 11 Penn State.The weekend added one more low:
a blizzard.
The Cardinal (4-10, 2-6 MPSF) survived sloppy
play and a comeback by host Springfield to open the
tournament, winning the five-gamer 30-24,30-22,28-
30,24-30,19-17. Stanford could not repeat its success
against East Coast powerhouse Penn State on Satur
day and fell in three games, 22-30,26-30,25-30.
The team then spent Sunday in its hotel, waiting
for the airports to reopen after a storm dropped two
feet of snow on New England.

Still riding the momentum of a 3-0 win over con
ference foe Pacific last Wednesday, Stanford started
quickly against the Division 111 Pride and went up
two games to none behind the arm of senior opposite
Ben Reddy. The Cardinal hit .284 as a team through
game two while holding Springfield under .100.
We played okay at the start and easily won, but I
would not say we played really well," head coach Don
Shaw said. "We were playing just well enough. I think
we got lulled into a confidence that- we should not
have [had] and they battled back and played well.
And with that momentum change, we were in a dog
fight at the end."
Facing defeat, the Pride's offense came alive, hit
ting .324 and .355 in the third and fourth games, re
spectively. Meanwhile, the Cardinal hitting game fal
tered.The Stanford men managed only a .057 average
in game four.
In the decisive fifth game, both teams had oppor
tunities to claim victory. But Stanford finally sealed
the win with a block by senior setter Jeremy Jacobs
and freshman middle blocker Brandon Williams.
"1 was happy that we were able to hang on
during the fifth game," Shaw said. "We fought
off some match points and I was just happy with
the fact that we won. Although maybe I feel like
it should have been easier [against a D-111 op
ponent]."
Reddy tallied match-highs with 30 kills and
12 digs to lead the way for Stanford. Senior out
side hitter Will Clayton finished with 14 kills
and only a single hitting error, hitting .520 on
the night. The Card outblocked the. Pride (11.5
to 9.5), who were led by senior middle blocker
Nick Manov. Jacobs dished out 63 assists to go
with three blocks.
The Cardinal expected a challenge the next
night from the Nittany Lions, and that was what
they got. Although Stanford stayed close, Penn
State proved too strong, rolling to victory with
an overall hitting percentage of .400.
"Penn State brought out as tall a lineup as we
may see outside of Pepperdine," Shaw said. "We
played fairly well at the beginning and each
game was close into the early 20s. But we made
some mistakes that hurt us. And their block was
very tough."
The Nittany Lions recorded 13 team blocks
while the Cardinal could manage only five in
the loss. The Penn State middle blocking tan
dem of freshman Max Holt and senior Nate
Meerstein, both 6-foot-9, overpowered the
Stanford front line, whose tallest player (senior
middle Chris Ahlfeldt) stands 6-foot-7. Meer
stein tallied six solo blocks to Ahlfeldt's team
leading two.
The Cardinal struggled against the consis
tency and balance of the Penn State hitters. The
Nittany Lions had five players with at least
seven kills, led by outside hitter Matt Proper's
13.
Reddy had a solid hitting night, notching 18
kills on .257 hitting, but he was the only Stan
ford player with more than six kills. The Car
dinal outdug the Nittany Lions 23-21, with
Clayton and junior libero Brian Lindberg
both tallying four apiece. In every other statis
tical category, however, Penn State held the
advantage.
"We played tough volleyball," Clayton said.
"We were siding out well in game one but then
let up a little bit. Coming in, we wanted to play
our best volleyball and I don't think we did that.
We played really well at times, but we could not
keep it together through the whole match."
Shaw was encouraged by the tenacity his
team showed against Springfield, but stressed
the need to establish consistency against oppo
nents as strong as Penn State.
"This weekend, we had our moments," he
said."But we need to work on the same old stuff
â€” we need to pass well and serve well. We are
still not passing well enough to do what we want

to on offense, to take the pressure off of our out
sides to make big plays. We want to be able to
just run an offense. When you can pass well, that
changes everything."
"I definitely feel that we are heading in the
right direction,"Clayton added. "We are getting
more confident in the way we play, and now we
have the sense that we have a real chance of
winning every game."
With flights lined up from Connecticut to

Washington. D.C., and then home, the Cardinal
will have only a day or two to catch their breath
on campus. ITiey are back in the gym before
heading to Los Angeles to take on No. 7 UCLA
and No. 3 UC-Irvine this weekend. For some,
the hectic weekend doesn't just involve volley
ball.
"I just hope we'll be back in time for me to
take my midterm in Earth Science," Clayton
joked.
