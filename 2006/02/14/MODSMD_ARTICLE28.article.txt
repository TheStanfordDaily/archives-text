# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Weekend sees highs and lows East Coast tournament ends with mixed results for struggling squad 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
It was an up-and-down weekend for the Stanford
men's volleyball team, who split a non-conference
tournament in Springfield, Mass.
The Cardinal won on Friday against Springfield
College to put together their first winning streak of
the season, but they dropped their second match to
No. 11 Penn State.The weekend added one more low:
a blizzard.
The Cardinal (4-10, 2-6 MPSF) survived sloppy
play and a comeback by host Springfield to open the
tournament, winning the five-gamer 30-24,30-22,28-
30,24-30,19-17. Stanford could not repeat its success
against East Coast powerhouse Penn State on Satur
day and fell in three games, 22-30,26-30,25-30.
The team then spent Sunday in its hotel, waiting
for the airports to reopen after a storm dropped two
feet of snow on New England.

Still riding the momentum of a 3-0 win over con
ference foe Pacific last Wednesday, Stanford started
quickly against the Division 111 Pride and went up
two games to none behind the arm of senior opposite
Ben Reddy. The Cardinal hit .284 as a team through
game two while holding Springfield under .100.
We played okay at the start and easily won, but I
would not say we played really well," head coach Don
Shaw said. "We were playing just well enough. I think
we got lulled into a confidence that- we should not
have [had] and they battled back and played well.
And with that momentum change, we were in a dog
fight at the end."
Facing defeat, the Pride's offense came alive, hit
ting .324 and .355 in the third and fourth games, re
spectively. Meanwhile, the Cardinal hitting game fal
tered.The Stanford men managed only a .057 average
in game four.
In the decisive fifth game, both teams had oppor
tunities to claim victory. But Stanford finally sealed
the win with a block by senior setter Jeremy Jacobs
and freshman middle blocker Brandon Williams.
