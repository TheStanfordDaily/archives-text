# WOMEN TAKE TOP THREE IN UNEVEN BARS
## In Pursuit of Perfection No. 10 Cardinal score just above 196 against No. 12 Wildcats 
### JUSTINA KAMIEL GRAYMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford didn't quite reach perfection this past weekend, but
the women's team did get a win.
No. 10 Stanford neared championship-level competition in
its defeat of a talented No. 12 Arizona State squad; 196.325 to
195.725, its first team score of more than 196.
"We are doing all we talked about at the beginning of the
year," coach Kristen Smith said. "I think we're right on track to
peak at the end of the year."
Smith wasn't just speaking about the scores; consistency,
depth and unity are also on her mind. The team is melding to
gether, aided by a "contagious energy", according to Smith.
Uneven bars — Stanford's first rotation — was the team's
stand-out event on Friday. Freshman Nicole Ourada started the
team off with a solid routine and senior Glyn Sweets had a
clutch performance by sticking her landing on her double front
dismount.
Stanford claimed the top three places in bars. Sophomore Liz
Tricase, who scored 9.9, was followed by sophomore Tabitha
Yim and Sweets, who tied with Arizona State's Ashley Kelly for
second (9.875).
Vault was the only event won by ASU. 49.475 to 49.125. Kelly
performed well again, winning the vault title by scoring 9.975.
Tricase tied on vault with the Sun Devils' Cassandra Jusino for
second (9.95). However, the Cardinal are looking for strong per
formances in all of their vaults, especially since they are ranked
sixth nationally in the event.
"As a team, we have something to prove because we have a
lot of potential," freshman Kelly Fee said. "We're up-and-com
ing."
The Sun Devils held the top-two spots in balance beam, as
Kelly and Jusino's high-caliber routines earned them scores of
9.925 and 9.875, respectively.
Smyth said that Stanford freshman Heather Purnell began
the beam rotation "aggressive, confident and beautiful," and
that the team recovered quickly with four hit routines after
Fee had an early fall in the lineup. Yim came in third place
(9.85) and Purnell, who tied with senior Natalie Foley, fol
lowed with a 9.825.
On floor exercise, Boone, Jusino and Kelly demonstrated
their team leadership, with first- and third-place finishes while
the Cardinal fell behind.
In the all-around competition, Kelly claimed the win with a
39.675, and teammate Jusino earned second. Stanford's Yim gar
nered third, scoring 39.375, and Foley came in fifth (39.175).
"It was nice to see them put it together, especially on the
road," Smyth said.
The Cardinal will need to adjust their act when they perform
at home, and they plan to do so with more difficult skills and new
lineups and routines.
"It's going to be so positive and our energy will increase be
cause we just came off of two road wins," she said.
Stanford should be riding a wave of confidence when it hosts
No. 14 Arizona Friday. Arizona only tops Stanford in one team
event — and only by the slimmest of margins. The Wildcats'
team high in bars is 49.3, while the Cardinal's is 49.275.
Wildcat sophomore Danielle Hicks is a contender in bars and
beam, where she has scored 9.875 and 9.8. The strongest beam
performer seems to be freshman Briana Bergeson, who boasts a
9.9 high in the event.
Stanford sophomore Stephanie Gentry may be making her
debut this weekend, and Purnell may compete on floor, where
Cardinal senior Jessica Louie is also scheduled to compete.
Foley plans to perform a full-in on floor, and Tricase is working
on a reverse hecht, reverse hecht sequence on bars, where she is
still undefeated and top-ranked in the Pac-10.
This weekend, one wobble or two flexed feet will have dras
tic consequences in a sport where perfection is possible.
"I guess it just comes down to the very little details," sopho
more Alex Pintchouk said. "We just have to do it perfectly and
stick the landings. It makes the strongest impact."
Fee echoed the thoughts on perfection.
"In the gym we've really been focusing on the little details,"
she said. "Right now. we definitely have all our routines down.
Our plan right now is just to perfect them."
