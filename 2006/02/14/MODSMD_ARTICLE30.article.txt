### ROHAN PURANIK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford women's lacrosse routed
conference foe Oregon 18-9 this past
Saturday. The win runs Stanford's con
ference win streak to 32 straight games
under head coach Michele Uhlfelder.
"We came out really excited for our
first game," freshman defensive mid
fielder Vikki Fanslow said, later adding,
"We felt that we were prepared and
took charge early in the game."
The squad began strong offensive
play at the start of the game. Junior mid
fielder Liz Piselii was first to score for
the Cardinal in an offensive strike that
brought four additional straight goals in
the first eight minutes
Piselii was the top offensive per
former for Stanford in the first game of
the season, scoring three more goals and
two assists.
After a goal from Oregon's Ilsa van
den Berg in the 11th minute of the
match, Stanford rebounded with four
more consecutive goals.
The Cardinal's top form dwindled as
the first half came to a close. Four Ore
gon players scored in the final three
minutes of the first half to cut the Stan
ford lead to 10-5.
Stanford outshot Oregon 39-28 over
the course of the game and more than
doubled Oregon's shots in the first half,
23-11.
The second half brought senior at
tacker Megan Burker a special treat as
she scored her l(K)th goal at Stanford.
Burker now stands just one goal short of
fifth in the record books.
The Ducks went on to score a total of
four times in the second half, while the
Cardinal scored eight goals. Eleven
Stanford players scored during the

Though there are things we
have to work on still, we're
very confident coming out of
this first game for a
successful season. It's a great
way to start off our season.

"Though there are things we have to

ing out of this first game for a successful

The squad's next game is scheduled
at California. Stanford last played Cal in
the conference championship last year,
defeating Berkeley 12-9. Burker, then a
junior, scored four times in the champi
onship game while current senior Sarah
Bach, a fellow attacker, notched a hat
trick.
The game is slated for a noon start on
California's Memorial Stadium.
