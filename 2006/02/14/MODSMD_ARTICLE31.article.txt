## Shumway, first U.S. heart transplant surgeon, dies 
### JENNIFER LIU DESK EDITOR 
Norman E. Shumway, the sur
geon who performed the first suc
cessful human heart transplant in
the United States in 1968, died Fri
day, Feb. 10, at his home in Palo
Alto from complications related to
cancer. He had turned 83 the day
before.
The professor emeritus of car
diothoracic surgery, widely regard
ed as the father of heart transplan
tation. established Stanford as the
national leader in the pioneering
surgery for nearly a decade.
Shumway arrived at Stanford in
1958 as an instructor in surgery and
took advantage of expanded cam
pus facilities to begin the research
that helped popularize what had
been considered one of the most
dangerous operations in the field.
By 1959, Shumway and his first
resident, Richard Lower, trans
planted the heart of one dog into
another. Though the recipient dog
lived only eight days, the experi
ment proved that donated organs
could be kept alive — and that
heart transplants were feasible. In
1967, Christiaan Barnard per
formed the world's first heart
transplant in South Africa, using
techniques Shumway had helped
develop. The patient lived for 18
days.
What brought the publicity-shy
surgeon the most attention, howev
er, was the first successful adult
human heart transplant performed
in the United States — only the

fourth attempted in the world. On
Jan. 9,1968, Shumway operated on
54-year-old steel worker Mike
Kasperak, who lived for 14 days. It
also propelled Stanford, the site of
the surgery, into the spotlight.
Shumway, who grew up in
Michigan, attended the University
of Michigan before he was drafted
into the army. He earned his medi
al degree from Vanderbilt Univer
sity, and completed his internship,
residency and surgical training at
the University of Minnesota, with a
two-year stint in the Air Force. He
obtained his doctorate in cardio
vascular surgery in 1956.
In addition to his groundbreak
ing surgical work, Shumway
chaired Stanford's Department of
Cardiothoracic Surgery, which he
helped create, until his retirement
in 1993.
"He developed one of the
world's most distinguished depart
ments of cardiothoracic surgery at
Stanford, trained leaders who now
guide this field throughout the
world and created a record of ac
complishment that few will ever
rival," said Philip Pizzo, dean of the
Stanford School of Medicine, in a
press release. "His impact will be
long-lived and his name long-re
membered. We will miss Norm
Shumway and the dignity and ex
cellence that he brought to medi
cine and surgery — and to Stan
ford."
Shumway is survived by his for
mer wife, Mary Lou, of Palo Alto;
four children, Sara, Lisa, Amy and
Michael; and two grandchildren.
