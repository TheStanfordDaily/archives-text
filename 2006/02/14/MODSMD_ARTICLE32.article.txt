## Developers propose building on old car lots 
### CHRISTOPHER LIN STAFF WRITER 
The Menlo Park City Council
held a meeting on Tuesday, Feb. 7, to
review plans for developments in va
cant lots along El Camino Real, in
cluding a site owned by Stanford
University. Developers proposed
three different projects to build mul
tilevel structures that would contain
up to 2(30 condominiums and apart
ments, as well as retail and office
space and a hotel conference center.
The first plan came from Jeff War
moth of Benchmark Homes, who
proposed converting the former
Cadillac dealership at 1300 El
Camino Real — near the Stanford
Shopping Center — into a structure
with 145 residential units, 40,000
square-feet of retail space and 30.0(H)
square-feet of office space. The four
story complex would be 45 feet tall
and include surface and under
ground parking.
The second plan came from the
Menlo Park-based Matteson Com
panies, which proposed a complex
with 56 condominiums and 3,600
square-feet of retail space at 389 El
Camino Real, the former Anderson
Chevrolet truck lot. The complex
would be about 50 feet tall and
would have an underground parking
garage.
The third proposal advocated
adding a conference center to the
Stanford Park Hotel in order to ex
pand its capacity for indoor func
tions such as business conferences,
city meetings, weddings and anniver
sary parties. Because the conference
center would take up space in the
hotel's current parking lot, the devel

opment plan calls for expansion of
parking into part of a vacant auto
mobile lot owned by Stanford. The
lot, located at 300 El Camino Real, is
currently leased to the Anderson
Chevrolet automobile dealership,
owned by Auto Nation, a Fort Laud
erdale-based automotive retailing
company.
Bill Phillips, managing director of
real estate at the Stanford Manage
ment Company, described the pro
posed change as "fairly modest."
"The Stanford Park Hotel made a
good case for their need for addition

al parking space," he said. "They need
two aisles of parking to make up for
the space lost on present parking lots
in order to construct the conference
center. The net amount conies out to
about 3,(KK) or 4,000 square-feet."
The final approval for the Stan
ford Park Hotel expansion will be
tabled for seven years, the time re
maining on the Anderson lot's lease.
"This development plan has just
surfaced in public," Phillips said.
"The ground is still in control of the
lessees, and there have been no nego
tiations yet. The plan is just a long

term idea for what will happen when
the lease is up."
According to Phillips, the Univer
sity will review its four lots at the end
of their current leases to determine
how the land ought to be used.
"Once the lease is up, we'll look at
a plan and program for the entire
site, rather than a piecemeal pro
gram for the separate lots," Phillips
said. "We will take into account what
Stanford needs — academic needs
as well as commercial needs — and
we would check in with Menlo Park
to see what the city would allow."
