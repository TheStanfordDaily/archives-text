## Bush grants $1.17 M to energy President follows up on Slate of the Union promise with budget 
### DENISE SOHN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Though President George W. Bush addressed the
entire nation in his annual State of the Union speech
011 Jan. 31, his words — especially his announced plan
to reduce foreign dependency on oil — impacted the
Stanford community in several specific ways.
To follow up on his promise, the president recently
allocated $1.17 billion of the federal budget for the de
velopment of renewable energy sources in 2007.
Nevertheless, this investment is not enough, espe
cially when put in the context of the entire federal
budget, said Michael McGehee. assistant professor of
material science and engineering.
"Bush has allocated $1.17 billion for renewable en
ergy in 2007.T0 put that in perspective, his total budg
et is $2.77 trillion and his defense budget is $439 bil
lion." he said. "I'm extremely glad that he is increasing
the budget for energy research. Let's not forget, how
ever, that he is only committing 0.05 percent of his
budget to it."
The implications of this increased investment
merit a greater allocation of funds for research,
McGehee continued.
"Considering that keeping a stable source of ener
gy, avoiding dependence on oil from the Middle East
and preventing global warming are three of the most
important challenges our country faces, I don't think
the budget for energy research is as much as it should
be," he said.
Biological Sciences Prof. Chris Somerville said he

was more optimistic about the situation. Explaining
that "funding is always what limits research," he said
that the new federal allotment for renewable energy
research would have significant impacts.
"Scientists will start turning toward the problem,
and progress will be made," he said.
Somerville also said that the lack of progress dur
ing the past 20 years is due to the fact that "renewable
energy has not been a priority of government funding
since the days of Jimmy Carter."
Whether or not the budget allotment is as high as it
should be, Stanford will certainly stand to benefit. Of
the $1.17 billion allotment, McGehee estimated that
three to 10 Stanford professors would get additional
funding from the Department of Energy and that the
total amount of money received would range from
$500,000 to $3 million per year. Somerville calculated
that Stanford is currently granted approximately 3
percent of federal research dollars.
With this new funding, McGehee said he was con
fident about producing future successes. He described
the progress scientists have been making, both nation
wide and on campus.
McGehee described current research projects at
Stanford. At work on Stanford's Global Climate and
Energy Project (GCEP), he is currently studying how
to develop solar cells from organic materials.
A representative from GCEP who declined to give
her name reported that there were currently about 30
energy-related projects underway.
Bush's goal to reduce America's dependency on
foreign oil will not happen tomorrow, next month
or even next year. Though Stanford scientists doubt
that the budgetary increase is enough, they are con
fident that their projects will help speed up the
process.
