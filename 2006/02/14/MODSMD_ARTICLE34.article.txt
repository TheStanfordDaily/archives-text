## Schools use Facebook for admissions, disciplinary action Profiles can alert administration to criminal actions 
### JULIE KLEIN 
How much do you think about what you post on
Facebook.com? If the answer is not very much,
maybe you should. According to recent studies, it
may be time to seriously consider how much per
sonal information to reveal on the popular online
network, which is now used by 85 percent of stu
dents at participating colleges. Not only do some
college admissions officers use Facebook as anoth
er means to evaluate high school applicants, but
many companies also use the network to review fu
ture employees. Moreover, college campus officials
have started using Facebook as a means to catch il
legal behavior on campus.
According to The Washington Post, exclusive
private high schools in the District are banning the
use of the Web site, now that it has been expanded
to include high school students These schools, which
focus on college preparation, are aware that some

college admissions offices do utilize Facebook, and
they do not want their college admissions statistics
to be adversely affected.
However, the Admissions Office at Stanford
said it does not use this tactic.
"We do not use Facebooks of any kind in consid
ering candidates, nor do we request or require pic
tures of candidates," Dean of Admissions Richard
Shaw wrote in an email to The Daily. "I do not think
it would be appropriate to do so."
While prospective Stanford students do not
need to worry about their Facebook profiles for the
moment, current students should be wary of how
much they share online. Any illegal behavior shown
on Facebook could be used to incriminate students.
"It's out in the public domain," said Barbara
Nalazek, assistant director of the Legal Affairs Of
fice at Ohio University, in an interview with The Post
Online. "You can't really complain about getting
caught." Seventy-eight staff and faculty members at
the school are registered Facebook users, allowing
them to monitor all student activities.
James Devine, associate dean of the School of
Law at Missouri University, discussed a student's

legal Facebook rights with the Missourian News.
"An individual's right to privacy belongs to the
individual," Devine said. "If the individual waives a
portion for some reason (such as joining Facebook),
then they've waived it."
Even though students can control access to their
profiles, Facebook's privacy policy specifies that
these limits do not apply to lawful requests, which in
clude subpoenas and court orders
Last October, police at Penn State University
used a Facebook group called "I Rushed the Field
After the OSU Game (And Lived!)" to charge two
students with criminal trespassing. At Emory Uni
versity, members of groups called " Dobbs 2nd Alco
holics" and "Woodruff=Wasted" were given con
duct code violations The University of Pennsylva
nia even delayed its freshman student government
elections after discovering that students had used
the Facebook for illegal campaigning.
Many future employers also use the Facebook to
analyze applicants and check if they participate in il
legal activities. In addition, the site can legally sell in
formation about its users to marketers.
"Employers might be able to confirm back

ground information," said Career Development
Center Director Lance Choy in a previous inter
view with The Daily. "Some students write about
their interests, and employers might want to check
on whether this supports their job application. Some
employers might try and learn something about the
student's personality and whether it would be ap
propriate for the job. However, there is information
on Facebook that is not relevant to the job but may
be used inappropriately by employers to assess a
candidate."
Since this is such a new phenomenon, many
schools are just starting to adapt their policies. The
University of New Mexico recently blocked access
to the Facebook from all campus computers, and
next year, Ohio University is going to include the
dangers of Facebooking as part of its resident assis
tant training program.
"Its such a new entity," said Barbara Harrison,
associate director of Residence Life at Ohio Uni
versity. in an interview with The Post Online. "We
know RAs have lives, but if they find themselves in
a situation compromising their employment, we
have to address it."
