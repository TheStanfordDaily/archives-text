look for appropriate opportunities for
undertaking research," Brubaker-Cole
wrote in an email to The Daily.
She emphasized the advantage of the
reorganization for "students who might
not have considered research otherwise
because they weren't aware of the re
sources available to them," but who would
nonetheless "benefit greatly from a re
search experience with a faculty mentor."
The merge will delegate the responsi
bility of nominating Stanford students to
prestigious national research awards to
the new body, allowing there to be an in
tegrated way to "help us to identify stu
dents early who are well-suited for these
awards," Brubaker-Cole explained.
Sterritt emphasized that in the for
mation of the new department, there
will be no program cuts and"the joint
program will offer all the services cur
rently being offered," she wrote in an
email to The Daily.
"Call it one-stop-shopping for research
and advising," Brubaker-Cole added.
Sterritt and Bravman said many stu
dents find that their academic programs
involve curricular and research compo
nents. The merge of these two programs
aims to aid students in coordinating

their efforts in these disciplines.
"Many of our students now find that
their academic program involves both
curricular and research components,"
Bravman said. "This new organizational
structure will enable us to integrate re
search and advising considerations into
the same conversation with a student, so
that his or her program can be contem
plated in a unified way."
The administration is still working on
the logistics of the merge, including de
tails Sterritt labeled,"academics, finance
[and] administration." In addition, staff
from the two offices will coordinate
"strategies for inter-unit cross-training
and other related issues," according to
Brubaker-Cole. A new name for the
joint program is also being negotiated by
staff from both offices.
Currently, both UAP and URP are
located in Sweet Hall, but on different
floors. All the details of the merge will be
finalized in time for the restructured de
partment to conduct business in the fall
quarter of next year.
"When advising, research and cur
riculum work in tandem, we get to the
heart of what an undergraduate educa
tion is all about," Sterritt said.
