# STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS
## Groups fundraise on Valentine's 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
For the past several days. White Plaza has turned red and pink,
crammed full of various organizations trying to cash in on Valen
tines Day This year, fraternities, sororities, freshman dorms, spe
cial events committees and a capella groups made bids for con
sumers' dollars, each offering a unique product or service.
Orange, too, made an appearance, as Theta and Sigma Chi
joined forces to sell Crush Grams.
"Every week we cook and serve breakfast at the Urban Min
istry Homeless Shelter in Palo Alto," said senior Megan Shackel
ton, founder of the Crush Gram program. "The money raised
through Crush Grams goes toward improving the quality of the
food we serve, adding more variety and increasing the quantity so
that everybody at the shelter can receive a full meal. It means a
lot to all of the girls and I think the fact that we are directly in
volved with where the money is going and that many of us have
formed personal connections with those at the shelter really helps

to motivate the chapter to raise money through Crush Grams."
Ihe fundraiser involved selling bottles of Orange Crush with
an attached note, and delivering to the crush's door. The Thetas
asked that the note not include the sender's name, as it cost $ 1 to
send the bottle,and $ 1 for the recipient to find out who the sender
was. Or, the buyer could pay the full $2 and remain anonymous.
According to the sorority, a member of the Thetas transferred
to Stanford from a school where Crush Grams were an estab
lished tradition. Last year, the sorority decided to try it on an ex
perimental basis, and ended up selling 4(X) bottles of Crush. This
year, business was even better, they said.
"This year we completely sold out in two and a half days," said
junior Mark Sherwood, a member of Sigma Chi fraternity.
"That's 6(X) Crush Grams, or 10 percent of all undergrads. Since it
was such a success this year, we'll definitely expand the fundrais
er. It's a great thing."
"Based on [the fundraiser's] tremendous popularity among
