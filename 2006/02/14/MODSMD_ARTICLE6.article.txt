# STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS
## Groups fundraise on Valentine's 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
For the past several days. White Plaza has turned red and pink,
crammed full of various organizations trying to cash in on Valen
tines Day This year, fraternities, sororities, freshman dorms, spe
cial events committees and a capella groups made bids for con
sumers' dollars, each offering a unique product or service.
Orange, too, made an appearance, as Theta and Sigma Chi
joined forces to sell Crush Grams.
"Every week we cook and serve breakfast at the Urban Min
istry Homeless Shelter in Palo Alto," said senior Megan Shackel
ton, founder of the Crush Gram program. "The money raised
through Crush Grams goes toward improving the quality of the
food we serve, adding more variety and increasing the quantity so
that everybody at the shelter can receive a full meal. It means a
lot to all of the girls and I think the fact that we are directly in
volved with where the money is going and that many of us have
formed personal connections with those at the shelter really helps

to motivate the chapter to raise money through Crush Grams."
Ihe fundraiser involved selling bottles of Orange Crush with
an attached note, and delivering to the crush's door. The Thetas
asked that the note not include the sender's name, as it cost $ 1 to
send the bottle,and $ 1 for the recipient to find out who the sender
was. Or, the buyer could pay the full $2 and remain anonymous.
According to the sorority, a member of the Thetas transferred
to Stanford from a school where Crush Grams were an estab
lished tradition. Last year, the sorority decided to try it on an ex
perimental basis, and ended up selling 4(X) bottles of Crush. This
year, business was even better, they said.
"This year we completely sold out in two and a half days," said
junior Mark Sherwood, a member of Sigma Chi fraternity.
"That's 6(X) Crush Grams, or 10 percent of all undergrads. Since it
was such a success this year, we'll definitely expand the fundrais
er. It's a great thing."
"Based on [the fundraiser's] tremendous popularity among
students and faculty, we have decided
to make it an annual tradition," said
Sigma Chi president Kunal Gullapal
li. "It's all about cooperation within
the Greek community and serving the
Stanford campus with a small but fun
and delicious Valentine's treat."
The Stanford Undergraduate Psy
chology Association (SUPA) joined
in the festivities by holding a silent
auction from Feb. 5 through Feb. 12.
The association asked local business
es to donate products and services to
auction online. This year SUPA auc
tioned gift certificates for diamonds,
massages, opera and theatre tickets
— even a complimentary skydive. All
were items that would potentially
make a good Valentine's Day gift.
"This is something we've been
doing for a couple of years and it has
been successful on campus," said sen
ior John Wang, SUPA silent auction
coordinator. "It is a great way for local
businesses to advertise to Stanford stu
dents and a great way for Stanford stu
dents to get great deals on local prod
ucts. Plus, all the proceeds go to the
local Huckleberry Youth Programs.
This event is annual, so we would love
support in upcoming years."
This is the fifth time SUPA has held
a Valentine's Day silent auction, which
has been online since its inception.
Last year the event raised $1,775 for
another local charity and SUPA hopes
to provide that kind of support this
year.
The Stanford Mendicants contin
ued their annual tradition of "selling

themselves" for money on Valentines
Day. The a capella group hires out its
services to various dorms and individ
uals throughout the holiday, from 6
a.m. to midnight. All members of the
group are required to attend the gigs,
even at the peril of class attendance.
The dorm shows were sold for $150
and the individual serenades went for
$30.
"The group decided that it would
be a great idea to have a fundraiser in
which we exploited our'boyish charm'
to spread the love of Valentine's Day,"
said Mendicants member Paul Mark
Elizondo 111, a junior. "It all began
when a guy randomly asked a member
of the Mendicants to have the group
serenade his girlfriend on V-day, even
when this tradition wasn't formalized.
So the group thought that it could be a
huge tradition if they could get many
to buy into it."
The singing marathon yields about
$1,000 dollars a year, which goes to
ward the group's two main events dur
ing the remainder of the year — pro
ducing an album and subsidizing a
spring tour which will include China,
the East coast. New York and south
ern California.
"People tell me they love the idea
that the Mendicants take such a huge
part in V-day on this campus," said Eli
zondo. "Many girls have come to me
and told me that it would be their
dream to be serenaded by the Mendi
cants. Many guys don't realize how
special it is to the girl being sung to. We
receive positive responses from all the

girls we serenade on the big day, and
it's an amazing feeling overall. Singing
Brown Eyed Girl' 40 times in a row,
not so fun, but overall, a great time."
The Black Graduation Committee
sold Valentine' Day candy grams and
rose grams. From White Plaza, the
committee offered to deliver candv or

silk roses for $2 and real roses for $3.
Not to be left out, Paloma sold
roses, flower leis, and candy that were
delivered door to door under the
banner: "Get Leid on Valentine's
Day."
"The proceeds go directly to dorm
funds.... and starving children in

Ethiopia; they're all invited to our par
ties," said freshman Paloma resident
Erik Goldman. "The demand for our
services has been pretty good. Espe
cially [Monday] it picked up a lot. It's
hard to say how much money we
made, but we're already past $2(X). It's
too early to tell if this will continue next

year, seeing as we won't be living in
Paloma. [Next year's residents] might
steal the idea though."
All in all, the commercialization of
Valentines Day isn't so had, students
said.
"Everyone wins." said Wang. "Stu
dents, local businesses, and charity."

spring tour which will include China,
the East coast. New York and south
ern California.
"People tell me they love the idea
that the Mendicants take such a huge
part in V-day on this campus," said Eli
zondo. "Many girls have come to me
and told me that it would be their
dream to be serenaded by the Mendi
cants. Many guys don't realize how
special it is to the girl being sung to. We
receive positive responses from all the

girls we serenade on the big day, and
it's an amazing feeling overall. Singing
Brown Eyed Girl' 40 times in a row,
not so fun, but overall, a great time."
The Black Graduation Committee
sold Valentine' Day candy grams and
rose grams. From White Plaza, the
committee offered to deliver candv or

silk roses for $2 and real roses for $3.
Not to be left out, Paloma sold
roses, flower leis, and candy that were
delivered door to door under the
banner: "Get Leid on Valentine's
Day."
"The proceeds go directly to dorm
funds.... and starving children in

Ethiopia; they're all invited to our par
ties," said freshman Paloma resident
Erik Goldman. "The demand for our
services has been pretty good. Espe
cially [Monday] it picked up a lot. It's
hard to say how much money we
made, but we're already past $2(X). It's
too early to tell if this will continue next

year, seeing as we won't be living in
Paloma. [Next year's residents] might
steal the idea though."
All in all, the commercialization of
Valentines Day isn't so had, students
said.
"Everyone wins." said Wang. "Stu
dents, local businesses, and charity."

Members of
Sigma Chi frater
nity and Kappa
Alpha Theta
sorority in White
Plaza let a student
know who sent
her that Valen
tine's Crush
Gram — for a
price. Several
groups took ad
vantage of Valen
tine's Day to
fundraise for
charity or their
own funds.
For the past several days. White Plaza has turned red and pink,
crammed full of various organizations trying to cash in on Valen
tines Day This year, fraternities, sororities, freshman dorms, spe
cial events committees and a capella groups made bids for con
sumers' dollars, each offering a unique product or service.
Orange, too, made an appearance, as Theta and Sigma Chi
joined forces to sell Crush Grams.
"Every week we cook and serve breakfast at the Urban Min
istry Homeless Shelter in Palo Alto," said senior Megan Shackel
ton, founder of the Crush Gram program. "The money raised
through Crush Grams goes toward improving the quality of the
food we serve, adding more variety and increasing the quantity so
that everybody at the shelter can receive a full meal. It means a
lot to all of the girls and I think the fact that we are directly in
volved with where the money is going and that many of us have
formed personal connections with those at the shelter really helps

to motivate the chapter to raise money through Crush Grams."
Ihe fundraiser involved selling bottles of Orange Crush with
an attached note, and delivering to the crush's door. The Thetas
asked that the note not include the sender's name, as it cost $ 1 to
send the bottle,and $ 1 for the recipient to find out who the sender
was. Or, the buyer could pay the full $2 and remain anonymous.
According to the sorority, a member of the Thetas transferred
to Stanford from a school where Crush Grams were an estab
lished tradition. Last year, the sorority decided to try it on an ex
perimental basis, and ended up selling 4(X) bottles of Crush. This
year, business was even better, they said.
"This year we completely sold out in two and a half days," said
junior Mark Sherwood, a member of Sigma Chi fraternity.
"That's 6(X) Crush Grams, or 10 percent of all undergrads. Since it
was such a success this year, we'll definitely expand the fundrais
er. It's a great thing."
"Based on [the fundraiser's] tremendous popularity among
students and faculty, we have decided
to make it an annual tradition," said
Sigma Chi president Kunal Gullapal
li. "It's all about cooperation within
the Greek community and serving the
Stanford campus with a small but fun
and delicious Valentine's treat."
The Stanford Undergraduate Psy
chology Association (SUPA) joined
in the festivities by holding a silent
auction from Feb. 5 through Feb. 12.
The association asked local business
es to donate products and services to
auction online. This year SUPA auc
tioned gift certificates for diamonds,
massages, opera and theatre tickets
— even a complimentary skydive. All
were items that would potentially
make a good Valentine's Day gift.
"This is something we've been
doing for a couple of years and it has
been successful on campus," said sen
ior John Wang, SUPA silent auction
coordinator. "It is a great way for local
businesses to advertise to Stanford stu
dents and a great way for Stanford stu
dents to get great deals on local prod
ucts. Plus, all the proceeds go to the
local Huckleberry Youth Programs.
This event is annual, so we would love
support in upcoming years."
This is the fifth time SUPA has held
a Valentine's Day silent auction, which
has been online since its inception.
Last year the event raised $1,775 for
another local charity and SUPA hopes
to provide that kind of support this
year.
The Stanford Mendicants contin
ued their annual tradition of "selling

themselves" for money on Valentines
Day. The a capella group hires out its
services to various dorms and individ
uals throughout the holiday, from 6
a.m. to midnight. All members of the
group are required to attend the gigs,
even at the peril of class attendance.
The dorm shows were sold for $150
and the individual serenades went for
$30.
"The group decided that it would
be a great idea to have a fundraiser in
which we exploited our'boyish charm'
to spread the love of Valentine's Day,"
said Mendicants member Paul Mark
Elizondo 111, a junior. "It all began
when a guy randomly asked a member
of the Mendicants to have the group
serenade his girlfriend on V-day, even
when this tradition wasn't formalized.
So the group thought that it could be a
huge tradition if they could get many
to buy into it."
The singing marathon yields about
$1,000 dollars a year, which goes to
ward the group's two main events dur
ing the remainder of the year — pro
ducing an album and subsidizing a
spring tour which will include China,
the East coast. New York and south
ern California.
