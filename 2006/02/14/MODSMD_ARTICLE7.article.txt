# Reinventing management
## President and CEO of Nissan and Renault talks about career 
### CLAY BAVINGER KELLEN SCHEFTER 
Carlos Ghosn, the president and chief execu
tive officer of Nissan Motor Corporation and Re
nault, spoke yesterday at the Graduate School of
Business on how he managed what many in the
automotive industry consider a minor miracle
and turned the fortunes of the two companies
around. The event was sponsored by Phi Kappa
Psi fraternity.

One of the most popular figures in Japan today — in a recent poll. Japan
ese women named him one of the four men they'd most like to father their
children — Ghosn's career has taken him around the world. Born in Brazil,
he studied engineering at French universities. After graduation, he took a job
at Michelin. the beginning of an 18-year career that included positions in
Brazil and France. As the chairman and CEO of Michelin North America,
Ghosn oversaw the restructuring of the company after its acquisition of the
Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company in 1990.
Six years later, Ghosn started working for Renault, a French automobile
manufacturer. The company bought 37 percent of Nissan in 1999.
When Ghosn took the reins at Nissan, the company was in poor condition.
It had lost money during most of the previous seven years and had accumu-


Ghosn
That year, in a move that Ghosn
said was completely "unpre
dictable," Renault sent him to Nis
san as the Japanese company's chief
operating officer. In fact, Ghosn
was so intent on quickly turning a
profit that he promised to quit if
Nissan did not make a profit by the
second year of his tenure. The com
pany hardly needed so much time;
after less than 18 months, Nissan
was solidly in the black. Ghosn was
named president of the company in
2000 and CEO in 2001.
In fact, his success was so noted
that he was named CEO of Renault
as well in 2005, an unprecedented
move in the car industry. Now, in a
twist of fate, Ghosn's task is to revi
talize Renault, an undertaking that
he outlined to industry leaders last
Thursday.
Ghosn's speech touched on two
major hurdles he knew he would
have to overcome to get Nissan
back on track. First, he said, the
company's employees lacked confi
dence. Nissan was being overshad
owed by its two main Japanese com
petitors— Toyota and Honda —
which were performing extremely
well at the time.
"My biggest concern," said
Ghosn, "was bringing back confi
dence to everybody who worked for
Nissan — and profit is the demon
stration of success."
His second concern was the inter
national divide between Renault and
the Japanese company. "Cross-cul
tural interaction is difficult," he said,
"but you can really learn from it."
In his speech, Ghosn outlined
the ins and outs of operating cultur
ally diverse companies. He said he
focused on convincing everyone to
see the positive aspects of the cul
tural differences. He stressed the
importance of "seeing people on
the inside."
"I had to figure out what drove
the employees," he said.
To manage what he called the
"synergy" between Renault and
Nissan, Ghosn said that he stuck to
three main principles: respect for
identity, respect for autonomy and a

consideration of the reasons for co
operation.
Ghosn said that he immediately
understood that the two companies
were very disparate, not only in
product but in cultural and brand
identity.
"Keeping them distinct is essen
tial to the success of the compa
nies," he said. Ghosn also focused
on respecting the companies' tradi
tional autonomy.
"Decisions about Renault should
not come from Tokyo, and decisions
about Nissan should not come from
Paris," he said. "Synergy" between
the two companies only occurs
when leadership has a positive ef
fect on the bottom line of both.
When Renault purchased its
share of Nissan in 1999, industry an
alysts couldn't understand the com
pany's motivation. Ghosn coun
tered criticism that "two mules
don't make a racehorse," with the
suggestion that in a market as com
petitive as the automobile industry,
it might be better to be a mule. He
said that the companies had to de
velop the ability to compete and
succeed in rough conditions.
"A mule can make it through
these conditions, but a racehorse
might slip and fall," he said.
Toward the end of the hour-long
lecture on campus, Ghosn de
scribed Nissan's role in the growing
hybrid industry. Currently existing
hybrid technology is estimated to
add $6,000 to the cost of each hy
brid vehicle — analysts say that
consumers, on the other hand, are
only willing to pay about $2,500.
Ghosn said that despite the opti
mism of competing companies, hy
brids will remain a niche market
until this problem is solved. Though
Nissan's participation in the nas
cent hybrid market is limited, it's
just another example of the long
time executive's approach to lead
ership.
"Management in the 21st centu
ry is taking responsibility for your
actions and facing the conse
quences your actions create," he
said.

ese women named him one of the four men they'd most like to father their
children — Ghosn's career has taken him around the world. Born in Brazil,
he studied engineering at French universities. After graduation, he took a job
at Michelin. the beginning of an 18-year career that included positions in
Brazil and France. As the chairman and CEO of Michelin North America,
Ghosn oversaw the restructuring of the company after its acquisition of the
Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company in 1990.
Six years later, Ghosn started working for Renault, a French automobile
manufacturer. The company bought 37 percent of Nissan in 1999.
When Ghosn took the reins at Nissan, the company was in poor condition.
It had lost money during most of the previous seven years and had accumu-


Ghosn
That year, in a move that Ghosn
said was completely "unpre
dictable," Renault sent him to Nis
san as the Japanese company's chief
operating officer. In fact, Ghosn
was so intent on quickly turning a
profit that he promised to quit if
Nissan did not make a profit by the
second year of his tenure. The com
pany hardly needed so much time;
after less than 18 months, Nissan
was solidly in the black. Ghosn was
named president of the company in
2000 and CEO in 2001.
In fact, his success was so noted
that he was named CEO of Renault
as well in 2005, an unprecedented
move in the car industry. Now, in a
twist of fate, Ghosn's task is to revi
talize Renault, an undertaking that
he outlined to industry leaders last
Thursday.
Ghosn's speech touched on two
major hurdles he knew he would
have to overcome to get Nissan
back on track. First, he said, the
company's employees lacked confi
dence. Nissan was being overshad
owed by its two main Japanese com
petitors— Toyota and Honda —
which were performing extremely
well at the time.
"My biggest concern," said
Ghosn, "was bringing back confi
dence to everybody who worked for
Nissan — and profit is the demon
stration of success."
His second concern was the inter
national divide between Renault and
the Japanese company. "Cross-cul
tural interaction is difficult," he said,
"but you can really learn from it."
In his speech, Ghosn outlined
the ins and outs of operating cultur
ally diverse companies. He said he
focused on convincing everyone to
see the positive aspects of the cul
tural differences. He stressed the
importance of "seeing people on
the inside."
"I had to figure out what drove
the employees," he said.
To manage what he called the
"synergy" between Renault and
Nissan, Ghosn said that he stuck to
three main principles: respect for
identity, respect for autonomy and a

consideration of the reasons for co
operation.
Ghosn said that he immediately
understood that the two companies
were very disparate, not only in
product but in cultural and brand
identity.
"Keeping them distinct is essen
tial to the success of the compa
nies," he said. Ghosn also focused
on respecting the companies' tradi
tional autonomy.
"Decisions about Renault should
not come from Tokyo, and decisions
about Nissan should not come from
Paris," he said. "Synergy" between
the two companies only occurs
when leadership has a positive ef
fect on the bottom line of both.
When Renault purchased its
share of Nissan in 1999, industry an
alysts couldn't understand the com
pany's motivation. Ghosn coun
tered criticism that "two mules
don't make a racehorse," with the
suggestion that in a market as com
petitive as the automobile industry,
it might be better to be a mule. He
said that the companies had to de
velop the ability to compete and
succeed in rough conditions.
"A mule can make it through
these conditions, but a racehorse
might slip and fall," he said.
Toward the end of the hour-long
lecture on campus, Ghosn de
scribed Nissan's role in the growing
hybrid industry. Currently existing
hybrid technology is estimated to
add $6,000 to the cost of each hy
brid vehicle — analysts say that
consumers, on the other hand, are
only willing to pay about $2,500.
Ghosn said that despite the opti
mism of competing companies, hy
brids will remain a niche market
until this problem is solved. Though
Nissan's participation in the nas
cent hybrid market is limited, it's
just another example of the long
time executive's approach to lead
ership.
"Management in the 21st centu
ry is taking responsibility for your
actions and facing the conse
quences your actions create," he
said.
