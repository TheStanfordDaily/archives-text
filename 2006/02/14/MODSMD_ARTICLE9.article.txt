The Daily continues its "Through My Eyes" se

Meeting the president
Last week, Anne [Yelsey] talked about me
falling at the White House. I will tell you the full
story. First off. never ever tell your mother that
you're going to meet the president. She bought me

20 awful outfits to wear for the event, and she forced
me to try on all this hideous June Cleaver stuff. I was
like,"No,all these dresses arc ugly," but 1 picked one
out. I had to make it my own. though, right? So I got
really high shoes to match my dress, these spikes.
When I was actually meeting the president, he
asked my name. I couldn't remember! All I could
think was, "You look a lot older in real life." But I
obviously couldn't say that. Inside I was thinking,
"What is my name? What is my name? Omigod
omigod; the president of the United States is shak
ing my hand right now."
He asked us who we beat in the
NCAA Championship finals and we told
him Texas. He said something like "Aw
man, " so I said, [in a sad voicej "I'm sorry."
Anyway, so then we're leaving and I
was concentrating so hard on not tripping
because I saw that the stairs looked pretty
difficult. Well, sure enough, I misjudged
the very first one and BOOM — I'm
down and they're playing our fight song
and everyone's cracking up. It was proba
bly one of my worst moments of klutzi
ness. Though there was also the time I
broke a table freshman year.
Being "the loud one"
I used to think the reason I'm loud was
because I had a hearing problem. So this
summer, I went to the doctor to get my
hearing checked.... Now I realize that I'm
loud just for the sake of being loud.
It's good,though, because I'm in situa
tions a lot where I'm trying to get people's
attention and it helps to have a projectile
voice — like if I'm trying to call that
there's a fire or something.
Being loud both helps and hurts. I'll be
sitting in a car with the team, talking and
telling a story, and I'll notice that everyone
is looking in a different direction — no
one is looking at me. One day, Frankie
[Brennan, the assistant coach] interrupt
ed and said, "Theresa, you're sitting two
feet from us. You don't have to yell."
The team has invented a game now be
cause I have these stories that really don't
make sense and are only interesting to
me. But I'll keep going with the story even
if everyone has stopped listening. So now,
when they don't seem to be paying atten
tion, I try to make the story sound as un
believable as possible — to see if anyone
can call me on it. And Alice started this
thing where my teammates will cut in and
say, "Yeah, that's bullshit, and that part is
definitely bullshit," etc.
The problem with being loud, though,
is that everyone kind of gets annoyed with
you. Sometimes 1 annoy myself. But deep
down in their hearts, they like it. It certain
ly helps when I'm screaming from court
six to court three, knowing they hear me.
Losing a nickname
Freshman year, the team called me T-
Money because I wasn't losing any
matches. That got dropped, though, be
cause I was going around saying, "Yeah,
I'm T-Money," and they were like,"Okay,
don't be arrogant about it." So my nick
name went back to being T-Lo, the name

I originally got when 1 was 16.1 don't have
the butt of J-Lo, nor do 1 have that Latina
Boricua thing going on, hut you know —
the name fits, it works. If only 1 could salsa.
Being there for each other
Whenever anything goes wrong, you
know you can ask your teammates for ad
vice. If it's a serious problem, you always
go to the seniors — to the "benevolent
dictatorship." Since there are four of
them, it really works because they can all
give you different things. Al[ice Barnes]
always comes up with something crazy
and will tell you just what to do. Jess[ica
Leek] is very good with guys —if you
have a problem with boys, you ask Jess.
And Jo teaches me Chinese. She taught
me how to say marijuana the other day —
it was in her textbook!
Anne is my saving grace. We're the
same year but so different. I'll tell her
something I did and she'll just be like
"WHAT?!" Half the time, I tell her my
stories just for shock value. But I also
know that I can really tell her or ask her
anything and trust her to give me really
pragmatic advice.
The sophomores are really good for
support, tot). Let me tell you, Whitney
[Deason] is so mature. I love playing dou
bles with her because she reminds me to
breathe. I'll be flipping out but insisting
"1 'm calm, I'm calm." She tells me. though,
"Just breathe — deep breaths now," and
I'll realize, "Oh yeah, I don't remember
the last time I've breathed."
Bonding on and off the courts
Practice is so social. I'll be hitting on
the second court and I'll call out to the
fourth court, "So Amber, you going out
tonight?" and we'll talk about our plans.
We're always calling our teammates out
on stuff during practice — "So, I saw you
out with some new boy last night."
It's good because it keeps everyone in
the know about everyone else's life.
Everything comes out really quickly on
the team and everyone knows pretty
much everything about everyone else.
There are no secrets, which helps keep the
team even more bonded. We're all really
open with each other.
We're really just a bunch of sisters. It's
great at the end of the day to hang out
with your best friends on the courts and ai
dinner, or at Potter watching "Grey's
Anatomy." We're actually turning into
that obsessive team that does everything
together.
