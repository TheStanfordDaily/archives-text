Meeting the president
Last week, Anne [Yelsey] talked about me
falling at the White House. I will tell you the full
story. First off. never ever tell your mother that
you're going to meet the president. She bought me

20 awful outfits to wear for the event, and she forced
me to try on all this hideous June Cleaver stuff. I was
like,"No,all these dresses arc ugly," but 1 picked one
out. I had to make it my own. though, right? So I got
really high shoes to match my dress, these spikes.
When I was actually meeting the president, he
asked my name. I couldn't remember! All I could
think was, "You look a lot older in real life." But I
obviously couldn't say that. Inside I was thinking,
"What is my name? What is my name? Omigod
omigod; the president of the United States is shak
ing my hand right now."
