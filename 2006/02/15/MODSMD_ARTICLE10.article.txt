## Do you know your switch grass? 
### 
Switch grass is more than fodder for a bong joke on
The Daily Show. Who knew? Theoretically, if the
number of campus residents who viewed this
year's State of the Union mirrors national averages,
around 15 percent of Stanford students should have
tuned in on January 31. They learned that the United
States is staking much of its energy future on switch
grass. But what the heck is switch grass?
Students that tuned in to hear President Bush's pro
posals, whether live on major networks or belatedly in
satirical snippets on Comedy Central, were left with
one term that Bush identified as key to American sci
ence in the coming years: hybrid. That is, hybrid vehi
cles, human-animal hybrids and hybrid funding from
the public and private sectors for science technology
and education.
So if the lame-duck president has his way, how much
will the face of science policy change in the near fu
ture? Not as much as you may think — despite the re
cent entourage of flex-fuel commercials rolled out by
major American automakers to trumpet the green
virtues of yellow fuels, such as ethanol from corn.
In regards to energy, the big news preceding the
State of the Union was that Bush would admit the
United States' addiction to oil.The big news afterwards
was the large role that Bush envisioned for bio-based
fuels to power cars in the near-future. Since the current
epicenter of ethanol penetration is Minnesota and Illi
nois. it's no wonder a common campus response to
"What's switch grass?" is "Something you whip some
body with?" While switch grass may indeed be good for
harassing your younger siblings, a more descriptive re
sponse would be that it is a grass found in marshes and
meadows whose fast growth and five-foot or longer
blades make it a good candidate for use as a fuel.
Switch grass and its friends, like wood chips and
stalks, are not all hype. Many opponents of traditional
corn-based ethanol claim that it corn a net energy
loser (i.e., more energy goes into producing ethanol
than is available from it as a fuel) and may put too
much pressure on global food supplies. But switch
grass is more energy-efficient than corn, can grow in
most climates, has a higher yield per acre, requires
fewer inputs and is entirely consumed in the process of
making fuel.Thus, ethanol inputs like switch grass and
wood chips could be less controversial than corn for
producing fuels like EB5. which is a blend of 85 percent
ethanol and 15 percent gasoline that can be used in
flex-fuel vehicles.
Whether it's the key to reducing the United States'
oil needs is another question. It should also perk your
ears to a potential pork-warning: congressmen and sen
ators in states standing to be the major suppliers of
ethanol inputs are likely to seek incentives for produc
tion which may obscure the true economic and envi
ronmental pluses and minuses.
But evaluating the administration's specific goals
regarding oil — to replace more than 75 percent of
American imports from specifically the Middle East by
2025 — also make its envisioned future for ethanol
seem slightly more likely. In contrast to much of West
ern Europe, and what could be inferred from our gov
ernment's foreign policy, the United States is not pri
marily dependent on the Middle East for its imported
oil. According to data from the U.S. Energy Informa
tion Administration, about 50 percent of U.S. crude oil
imports in 2004 came from OPEC countries, and less
than 25 percent came from countries in the Persian
Gulf. In 2004 the United States also imported more
crude oil from each of Canada and Mexico than it did
from Saudi Arabia, the United States' largest Middle
Eastern supplier, while Venezuela and Nigeria nipped
at Saudi Arabia's heels.
For purposes of comparison, if we were to assume
that U.S. oil imports in 2025 will be equal to those in
2(X)4, then a reduction of 75 percent in Middle Eastern
crude oil imports, broadly defined, is equal to about a
20 percent reduction in total U.S. oil imports. Consider
ing that the United States domestically produces slight
ly more than 40 percent of the oil it consumes, this
means replacing around 12 percent of total 2004 U.S.
oil use, either by using non-oil fuels or by finding more
oil sources outside of the Middle East. Considering the
apparent automaker and Midwestern zeal for ethanol,
the combination of the infusion of hybrid cars into the
market and growth of ethanol fuels makes this goal ap
pear to be not such a stretch.
What about our other hybrids, human-animal and
funding? Most American medical researchers, like
the president, have rejected the notion that human
cloning, and human-animal cloning, is acceptable,
though the language of the State of the Union can re
assure you that stem-cell research will remain a de
bated topic.
As for the American Competitiveness Initiative, crit
ics will argue that basic science research funding (though
growing in recent years) is still a near-negligible part of
the federal budget and that companies like IBM and
Intel have beat the U.S. government to the punch in turn
ing science professionals into science teachers.
So what's the conclusion for Stanford entrepre
neurs? If you believe in the power of heartland poli
tics and exhausted non-Middle Eastern oil reserves,
log on soon to steal the catchy "switchtoswitch
grass.com." If you don't seize the moment, Jon Stew
art may convince everyone that switch grass really is
contraband and you'll end up with an NSA wiretap
instead of a DOE grant.

crude oil from each of Canada and Mexico than it did
from Saudi Arabia, the United States' largest Middle
Eastern supplier, while Venezuela and Nigeria nipped
at Saudi Arabia's heels.
For purposes of comparison, if we were to assume
that U.S. oil imports in 2025 will be equal to those in
2(X)4, then a reduction of 75 percent in Middle Eastern
crude oil imports, broadly defined, is equal to about a
20 percent reduction in total U.S. oil imports. Consider
ing that the United States domestically produces slight
ly more than 40 percent of the oil it consumes, this
means replacing around 12 percent of total 2004 U.S.
oil use, either by using non-oil fuels or by finding more
oil sources outside of the Middle East. Considering the
apparent automaker and Midwestern zeal for ethanol,
the combination of the infusion of hybrid cars into the
market and growth of ethanol fuels makes this goal ap
pear to be not such a stretch.
What about our other hybrids, human-animal and
funding? Most American medical researchers, like
the president, have rejected the notion that human
cloning, and human-animal cloning, is acceptable,
though the language of the State of the Union can re
assure you that stem-cell research will remain a de
bated topic.
As for the American Competitiveness Initiative, crit
ics will argue that basic science research funding (though
growing in recent years) is still a near-negligible part of
the federal budget and that companies like IBM and
Intel have beat the U.S. government to the punch in turn
ing science professionals into science teachers.
So what's the conclusion for Stanford entrepre
neurs? If you believe in the power of heartland poli
tics and exhausted non-Middle Eastern oil reserves,
log on soon to steal the catchy "switchtoswitch
grass.com." If you don't seize the moment, Jon Stew
art may convince everyone that switch grass really is
contraband and you'll end up with an NSA wiretap
instead of a DOE grant.

Switch grass is more than fodder for a bong joke on
The Daily Show. Who knew? Theoretically, if the
number of campus residents who viewed this
year's State of the Union mirrors national averages,
around 15 percent of Stanford students should have
tuned in on January 31. They learned that the United
States is staking much of its energy future on switch
grass. But what the heck is switch grass?
Students that tuned in to hear President Bush's pro
posals, whether live on major networks or belatedly in
satirical snippets on Comedy Central, were left with
one term that Bush identified as key to American sci
ence in the coming years: hybrid. That is, hybrid vehi
cles, human-animal hybrids and hybrid funding from
the public and private sectors for science technology
and education.
So if the lame-duck president has his way, how much
will the face of science policy change in the near fu
ture? Not as much as you may think — despite the re
cent entourage of flex-fuel commercials rolled out by
major American automakers to trumpet the green
virtues of yellow fuels, such as ethanol from corn.
In regards to energy, the big news preceding the
State of the Union was that Bush would admit the
United States' addiction to oil.The big news afterwards
was the large role that Bush envisioned for bio-based
fuels to power cars in the near-future. Since the current
epicenter of ethanol penetration is Minnesota and Illi
nois. it's no wonder a common campus response to
"What's switch grass?" is "Something you whip some
body with?" While switch grass may indeed be good for
harassing your younger siblings, a more descriptive re
sponse would be that it is a grass found in marshes and
meadows whose fast growth and five-foot or longer
blades make it a good candidate for use as a fuel.
Switch grass and its friends, like wood chips and
stalks, are not all hype. Many opponents of traditional
corn-based ethanol claim that it corn a net energy
loser (i.e., more energy goes into producing ethanol
than is available from it as a fuel) and may put too
much pressure on global food supplies. But switch
grass is more energy-efficient than corn, can grow in
most climates, has a higher yield per acre, requires
fewer inputs and is entirely consumed in the process of
making fuel.Thus, ethanol inputs like switch grass and
wood chips could be less controversial than corn for
producing fuels like EB5. which is a blend of 85 percent
ethanol and 15 percent gasoline that can be used in
flex-fuel vehicles.
Whether it's the key to reducing the United States'
oil needs is another question. It should also perk your
ears to a potential pork-warning: congressmen and sen
ators in states standing to be the major suppliers of
ethanol inputs are likely to seek incentives for produc
tion which may obscure the true economic and envi
ronmental pluses and minuses.
But evaluating the administration's specific goals
regarding oil — to replace more than 75 percent of
American imports from specifically the Middle East by
2025 — also make its envisioned future for ethanol
seem slightly more likely. In contrast to much of West
ern Europe, and what could be inferred from our gov
ernment's foreign policy, the United States is not pri
marily dependent on the Middle East for its imported
oil. According to data from the U.S. Energy Informa
tion Administration, about 50 percent of U.S. crude oil
imports in 2004 came from OPEC countries, and less
than 25 percent came from countries in the Persian
Gulf. In 2004 the United States also imported more
crude oil from each of Canada and Mexico than it did
from Saudi Arabia, the United States' largest Middle
Eastern supplier, while Venezuela and Nigeria nipped
at Saudi Arabia's heels.
For purposes of comparison, if we were to assume
that U.S. oil imports in 2025 will be equal to those in
2(X)4, then a reduction of 75 percent in Middle Eastern
crude oil imports, broadly defined, is equal to about a
20 percent reduction in total U.S. oil imports. Consider

ly more than 40 percent of the oil it consumes, this
