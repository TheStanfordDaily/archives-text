# Science program builds BONDS across
## Technology and Education Connecting Cultures utilizes Stanford's resources to promote science education in China 
### JANET KIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In an era characterized by fierce interna
tional competition, students from the United
States and China are looking to combine their
talents for the greater social good. Technology
and Education: Connecting Cultures (TECC) is
a non-profit organization dedicated to bridging
the cultural and technological gaps between China
and the United States. Founded in December of
2(K)3 by Tony Lung, a Chinese-American entrepre
neur, and Stanford alumnus Joshua Reeves (U.S.
2(M)S),TECC has grown into an extensive organiza
tion with teams at universities located in Beijing,
Shanghai and Hong Kong.
By undertaking joint US-Chinese ventures in
the fields of technology and education, TECC
seeks to affect positive social change and to pio
neer US-Sino cooperation in entrepreneurship.
"TECC creates an international network to incor
porate the concept of business management for the
purpose of social good," said freshman Hao Yan, a
member of Stanford's TECC team. "It encourages
students in the ivory tower to go out to the real
world and make a difference that affects people in
underprivileged regions."
"TECC differs from other China-related organ
izations because we focus on promoting awareness
through action — providing students with the op
portunity to have a real and meaningful impact,"
agreed Tony Huie, a coterminal Electrical Engi
neering major who serves as TECC's Vice Presi
dent of Projects.
One way in which the organization seeks to
achieve its objectives is through improving tech
nology-based curriculums in Chinese schools. Ihe
Summer Institutes on Technology and Education
were started in 2004 as an isolated project in the
western Chinese province of Gansu, which brought
together middle-school educators in the area for a
two-week seminar on using computers in the class-

room.

education, and providing a
training series for teachers in

the area, the program sought to in
crease the role of technology in the classroom set
ting. In 2005, the program expanded to three insti
tutes, respectively located in the Sichuan, Gansu
and Qinghai Provinces of China. TECC also in
creased the length of the institute to three weeks
and placed more emphasis on the role of technolo
gy in teaching English to Chinese students. By edu
cating teachers on effectively utilizing basic com
puter tasks like Google Search. Microsoft Office,
PowerPoint and e-mail, the institutes aimed to inte
grate technology into curricula and also to help
teachers access online teaching materials. TECC
team members were also available to offer long
distance consultation.
Huie said that the success of the institutes ex
tended beyond simply increasing rural students' ac
cess to technology. "TECC officers are actively in
volved in creating the content and curriculum for
these institutes by interfacing with education ex
perts at Stanford," he said. "We are helping to share
the phenomenal resources we have with these areas
of China."

Showcase, in which Stanford students exchange pa
pers. presentations, and posters with students from
Beijing's Tsinghua University, in an effort to foster
a mutual understanding between the student bod
ies of the two schools.
Members of the Stanford TECC team cited the
tangible effects of the programs as a major reason
for participating in the organization.
"It's a great way to bridge the gap between the
East and the West," said freshman Jianwei Low. "It's
awe-inspiring to believe that we are actually playing
a role in equalizing technology access in China."
"TECC is a first-hand experience of social entre
preneurship in action," agreed Huie.
I le also pointed to a broader sense of obligation,
"We hope to instill in our members that social re
sponsibility is not something to be left for conven
ience," said I luie. "It is a concept that should be in
grained in our evervdav lives."
