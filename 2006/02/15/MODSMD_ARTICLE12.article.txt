# Alumnus-turned-adventurer sets aviation records

### SAM BHAGWAT DESK EDITOR 
What would you do if you made a mil
lion dollars? This is a question that, hope
fully, many Stanford graduates will have
to answer. After Steve Fossett, Class of
1966, made a fortune in the mid-80's, op
tions trading in Chicago, he decided to do
something rather unorthodox: become an
adventurer.
At first, he failed — in his attempts to
complete the 100-mile Canadian Ski
Marathon (four times) and to cross the
English Channel (three times). But Fos
sett finally prevailed in his quest to tra
verse the Straits of Dover, finishing in
slightly over 22 hours. The strange part?
"I'm not a good swimmer." Fossett said
in a 1997 interview. "I couldn't even have

made my high-school swimming team."
TUrning to speed sailing, in October
2001 Fossett set the record for crossing
the Atlantic by sail, doing so in an impres
sive four days and 17 hours.'lliis beat the
previous time by over 40 hours. In the
same month, he traveled 687 miles in one
day, setting the 24 hour record for multi
hulled boats (though his record has since
been broken).
Being a professional adventurer can
be less than safe, however. In 19%, while
flying over the Atlantic in a hot air bal
loon, southward winds threatened to push
Fossett into Libyan airspace. Iliere was
talk of the Libyan dictator Col. Muammar
el-Qaddafi shooting him down. Disaster
was averted, however, when Fossett
steered south, eventually crash-landing in
northern India.

Aside from hot-air ballooning and
speed sailing, Fossett's other hobbies in
clude mountain climbing. Indy-car racing,
high-altitude gliding and managing his
business, which he continues to do when
he isn't flying around the world.
Fossett completed his first solo non
stop circumnavigation of the globe in Feb
ruary 2005 in a specially-designed plane,
the Virgin Atlantic Cilobal Flyer. This Sat
urday. an emergency landing in
Bournemouth, England completed his
world-record longest non-stop flight with
out refueling on Saturday.Taking off from
Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Fossett
had circled the globe once before flying
across the Atlantic again.
How can Fossett fly so far without re
fueling? The answer lies in the Global
Flyer's minimalist design, consisting of a

cockpit, with two external booms con
nected by the wings. Constructed out of
graphite and epoxy. the Global Flyer can
hold 18,000 pounds of fuel — over five
times its empty weight of 3,350 pounds. In
comparison, passenger aircraft can rarely
hold many more pounds of fuel than their
empty weight.
Fossett's enthusiasm and dedication
have helped him set 88 world records in
aviation — accomplishing the difficult
task of making his 21 records in sailing
seem pithy by comparison. All of them, of
course, were backed by the fortune Fos
sett made trading on the Chicago ex
change.
So hearken, ye overworked under
graduate: there are things to do with that
first million dollars other than get a build
ing named after you.
