## Editorial Scandals hurt those who can least afford it 
### 
Two weeks ago, in his State of the
Union address. President George W.
Bush announced the creation of a
new Cabinet-level secretary position to
coordinate administration scandals—at
least, if you believe The Onion.
But one can't help wondering: Why has
this administration been plagued with so
many scandals? From Nigerian uranium to
Katrina to Halliburton, a new scandal
seems to crop up ever month. Where are
they all coming from?
While some might say: "the Bush ad
ministration is among the most corrupt in
history." there is something more going on
here. The more important question to ask
is: Why is the system such that one scandal
seems to follow another as surely as sum
mer follows spring?
Lord Acton's oft-quoted saying, that
"power tends to corrupt, and absolute
power tends to corrupt absolutely,"
comes to mind. When the government
says "trust us" and the public quietly ac
quiesces, the lack of oversight and ac
countability gives the government more
power since it doesn't have to defend in
public what they do in private.
When Bush blasted The New York
Times for revealing the use of the NSA to
wiretap terrorists, what he was essentially
saying was —trust us. we won't ever abuse
our power to wiretap anyone, not even if
the public doesn't know about it.
When, shortly before the invasion of
Iraq. Bush declared that that "intelli
gence gathered by this and other govern
ments leaves no doubt that the Iraq
regime continues to possess and conceal
some of the most lethal weapons ever de
vised" without offering any proof, what
he was saying was—trust us, we know
what we're talking about.
And. most recently, when the Louisiana
state Department of Homeland Security
refused to allow the Red Cross into New
Orleans, and police of neighboring cities
blocked bridges to refuse to allow
refugees out. what they said was —trust us,
we've got the situation under control, so
we won't allow outside help or let people

help themselves.
We could go on, for example about
Bush's photo op stopping three tons of
food from being delivered to New Or
leans, or former FEMA Head Michael
Brown's allegation that the administration
knew about the levee breach a day before
they claimed to. And the problems are not
limited to this administration. Ten years
ago, Madeleine Albright was asked on 60
Minutes whether the estimated deaths of
500,000 children caused by sanctions on
Iraq were worth it. Her response? "I think
this is a very hard choice, but the price—
we think the price is worth it."
This remark showcases the Machiavel
lian worldview shaped by power politics.
Regarding individuals as mere pawns in a
grander game, politicians often disregard
the essence of humanity. And the victims
of this attitude are most often the most
helpless members of society. It was the
poor and the homeless who suffered the
brunt of Katrina; it was children who died
from the Iraqi sanctions.These people de
serve our sympathy, not only because of
their helplessness, but also because offi
cial authorities often actively work
against them.
Worse, hope for future improvement is
dimmed by authorities refusing to apolo
gize for their actions. After Katrina, Bush
said, "I take responsibility." While this is a
good first step, admitting responsibility is
inadequate — those responsible must be
held responsible. While those responsible
for deaths caused by forcibly keeping the
Red Cross out of New Orleans or those re
sponsible for the deaths of Iraqi children
are unlikely to be indicted on manslaugh
ter counts, efforts to ensure that officials
do not abuse their privileges is paramount.
If we leave the government alone in the
room with the cookie jar, they will put
their hand in, and all we can hope for is
that someone will catch them afterwards.
But this is no mere stolen cookie: when we
turn our back on the government and give
it a blank check in the name of security or
emergency, many lives—both military and
civilian—are critically at stake.
