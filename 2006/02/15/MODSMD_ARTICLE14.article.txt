# Ode to Marguerite and public transportation
## 
### 
There are few students as devoted to
the Marguerite shuttle — or Marge,
as she prefers I call her — as I am.
Many people ride the Midnight Express
downtown, the Shopping Express to Wal
mart or the B-line to the train station once
in a while. But how many are there who
have been known to ride the SLAC Line
to class or to memorize the schedule for
all of the most traveled routes for any
given time? Yes. Marge and I have shared
a special bond since I began to under
stand the adventures that are to be had
and the joy that is public transportation.
They say that it's not the destination
but the journey that matters. "Getting
There," a dubious direct-to-video offering
by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, whacks
audiences with this theme mallet every
few minutes throughout the film. But it
was the no-car policy for freshmen that
first brought this message home for me, as
everyone quickly learned that our options
are either to limit ourselves to whatever is
within biking radius or to deal.
Some of the most memorable moments
of my freshman year took place within the
confines of some form of public trans
portation. We all know that participating
in several moments of "Sketch" is an inte
gral part of the Freshman Experience —
one they, oddly, neglect to mention at
NSO week. Riding the Midnight Express
back from a Row party at 1 a.m. has al
lowed us to meet innumerable fabulously
sketchy drunken friends. Though I don't
want to know why that middle-aged man
in a wife-beater and cowboy hat was rid
ing the Marge down Mayfield on a Satur
day night.
There have been old standbys like the
drunk, muttering homeless man or the
guy with the awful comb-over who
winked at me on the Muni in San Francis
co. The Bike Car of the Caltrain has also
proved to be an exceptional venue for at
tracting sketchiness.
During one trek, we were discussing
various potential plans for trips to take
over Spring Break. Our new friend across
the aisle decided it was his prerogative to
advise us on the best places to travel
throughout the southwestern United
States — a dude ranch near Palm Springs
was his personal favorite — and then to

invite himself along on our proposed
journey ("Oh, the third week in March?
No, that doesn't work for me. How about
April?"). On another trip, a companion in
the Bike Car shared a delightful rant in
which he enlightened us on the evils of
Stanford and how Gray Davis caused
9/11. We were certainly glad to be leaving
the train when it reached the Palo Alto
station, and we mourned (just a little) for
the kid in the red Stanford sweatshirt
who was hauling his bike into the car as
we exited.
And believe me, no one has lived until
they have leapt onto a moving Caltrain as
it begins to pull out of the station, with
friends propping open the door.
I used to curse the prohibition on
freshman cars as an unnecessary and un
justified attempt by The Man to keep us
down. But I guess that at least some of
that rationale about freshmen bonding
does have some merit, as there is great ad
venture and an even greater sense of sat
isfaction to be had navigating the perils of
public transportation.
Now, as a sophomore, my Toyota is my
constant companion, so the necessity of
using public transportation has de
creased. Don't get me wrong: my heart
still goes pitter-patter when I hear the
tell-tale sound of Marge clamoring down
Santa Teresa Street. But a lot of wackiness
can happen on road trips, too, and there's
now a far greater area around the region
that can be explored. And after all, it's
Ashley (or is it Mary-Kate?) who reminds
us: "Our misadventure was our adven
ture! Sometimes it's the journey — not
the destination."
