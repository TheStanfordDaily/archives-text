# On the same team

You can imagine the huge grin on my
face as I turned on my television to
see two fully-grown athletic young
men atop one another on their backs in styl
ishly aerodynamic, form-fitting singlets,
clutched together for dear life. I'm talking,
of course, about the luge doubles event in
the 2006 Olympic Winter Games!
I've been a fan of the Winter Olympics
for as long as I can remember. In fact,
when things get really bad in graduate
school. I often raise my hands into the air
mockingly and ask "why, why?" Nancy
Kerrigan-style, as if I've just been clubbed
in the knee and my Olympic dreams are
dashed. And let's be honest, nobody can
resist a good Michelle Kwan joke. Am I
right?
It's safe to say that my appreciation for
the Winter Games goes far beyond making
fun of it for its homoerotic events, witness
ing its dramatic figure skating stories, or
even seeing people on skis shooting things
with rifles (might I suggest a pair of skis for
Vice President Cheney?). In fact. I'm such a
fan of the Winter Olympics that I often add
the words "on ice" after I finish reading for
tune cookies. Beat that.
But this year I can't help but feel like
something is missing (and I'm not just talk

ing about Michelle Kwan — OOH!). It
doesn't seem like many people are taking
the Winter Games seriously this year, which
I find unfortunate because of the many fas
cinating aspects to the Games.
On the most basic level, the Olympics
are entertaining for the brute my-country
against-yours competition of it all (espe
cially when my country wins!). There's
something to be said for the training in
volved, intensity of competition and athlet
ic demands of winter sports. It's hard
enough for me to watch a triple-lutz-sow
cow. much less perform one in front of an
audience of millions.
It's also interesting to watch the diplo
matic relations between the Olympians.
With an overwhelming emphasis on indi
vidual sports, it's easy to see the Olympians
as real people with dreams, no matter from

which corner of the globe they hail. There's
definitely something about our shared hu
manity that make the Games momentous.
And finally, there's the patriotism of it
all. 1 think what I love most about Olympic
patriotism is that it's different from the
usual types of patriotism that we see here at
home. It's not about Democrat or Republi
can, liberal or conservative. It's about com
ing together and representing our country
in the global community.
We live in a chaotic time of natural disas
ters, political scandals and freak quail hunt
ing accidents. With a war abroad, culture
clashes at home and religious fundamental
ism taking the world hostage, part of what I
find most fascinating about the Olympics is
the way that it symbolizes a level of sophis
tication and respect among and within
countries. It is, essentially, an opportunity
for us to come together as Americans —
somewhat of a rare sentiment in light of the
polarized feelings that many Americans
have toward one another, much less the rest
of the world.
If anything, it's a great spectator sport.
Just ask Michelle Kwan.
