Column encourages negative
stereotypes
While reading The Daily on Monday, I
encountered a sentence that alarmed me,
both as a woman on the Stanford campus
and the President of the Inter-Sorority
Council.
The sentence, part of Chris Holt's col
umn, "To Chuck and Hunter with love,"
read: "Women, high on feminist power gen
erated from"The Vagina Monologues," an

ticipation for Women's History Month and
the success of TV's "Grey's Anatomy," pa
trol this campus like Pi Phis looking for
their fix."
The above sentence is problematic prima
rily — although not exclusively — in its
rhetorical parallel of women "high on femi
nist power" to women in a Greek organiza
tion looking for a "fix." This offensive at
tempt at humor both derogates all women by
trivializing women's empowerment and di
rectly targets Greek women through the ref

erence to Pi Phi.
I would urge Chris and The Daily's editors
to anticipate the consequences of their
words. While I understand your desire to
write in an entertaining manner, please keep
in mind that your words reach a wide audi
ence and thus have the potential to perpetu
ate stereotypes that deteriorate the Univer
sity's sense of community.
