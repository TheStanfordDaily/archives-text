## WRESTLING Wrestlers pinned by Pac-10's best Two Stanford wrestlers nationally ranked, prepare for Pac-10 tournament 
### DENIS GRIFFIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the crucial Pac-1() tournament only weeks away,
the Cardinal wrestlers closed out their conference dual
meet schedule this past weekend with a pair of losses to
the top ranked teams in the Pac-10. Nonetheless, head
coach Kerry McCoy says he's seen enough progress from
his team over the course of the season to warrant a degree
of optimism.
"We definitely weren't satisfied with the results, but we
were happy with the effort the guys put forth as a team
overall," McCoy said. "I think in terms of getting to a posi
tion to win the Pac-10, we're definitely right where we
need to be."
The Cardinal (7-7,4-4 Pac-10) faced a tough slate of
competition, as they first lost 29-13 at No. 21 Cal Poly (9-7,
5-3) on Friday before traveling to No. 12 Arizona State
(14-7, 8-0) on Sunday, where they lost 30-15 to the Sun
Devils. Arizona State and Cal Poly are ranked first and
second in the Pac-10, respectively, compared to Stanford's
No. 5 conference ranking.
Despite the team losses, there were several individual
matches that were definite positives. Sophomore captain
Tanner Gardner at 125 pounds, senior captain Ray Blake
at 165, and sophomore Josh Zupancic at 149 all went un
defeated for the weekend. In addition, heavyweight fresh
man Jared Boyer and 174-pound freshman Luke Feist
each took home one win apiece from the matches.
The dual against the Sun Devils was particularly hard
fought, as the Cardinal hung with Arizona State through
the first seven matches out of ten.
"Three of their four best guys are at 184, 197, and
heavyweight," McCoy said. "They're all nationally
ranked, they're all Pac-10 champs or finalists, and they've
all done real well in the conference, so that's the meat of
their lineup."
Even still, McCoy was pleased with his team's effort in
those particular matches.
"Our guys fought hard, but they were just a little bit
outmanned," McCoy said. "At heavyweight Jared Boyer is
wrestling a fifth year senior ranked fourth in the country,
and Jared's a freshman. So in experience overall, that guy
has an edge there, and [Boyer] went out there and gave it
all he had."
The weekend's events also saw Blake's debut in the na
tional rankings at No. 16. Blake is the second Stanford
wrestler to be nationally ranked this season, as Gardner
took a No. 10 ranking into the weekend as well.
"It's always nice to see a guy who's put forth the effort
and had the success that he's having get recognized,"
McCoy said. "We always knew what he could do, and now
it's nice to see other people recognizing that."
Blake's newfound recognition no doubt springs in large
part from his upset two weekends ago of Oregon's then
sixth-ranked Joey Braccamonte. But Blake solidified his
position by defeating No. 11 Pat Pitsch of Arizona State on
Sunday.
At the end of the second period, Blake was down 1-0.
But he came roaring out in the third to score four quick
points en route to a 4-3 decision. Blake was not the only
Cardinal wrestler to score a victory over a ranked oppo
nent, as Zupancic had defeated No. 20 Jeff Owens of Cal
Poly in an 8-7 decision two days before.
McCoy had high praise for Zupancic, Gardner, and
Blake.
"Those guys have been performing solidly all through
out the year," McCoy said. "But they also set the standard
for the rest of the guys on the team. We're all starting to
come together as a group, and those three guys have had
success. But they're not doing it on their own, because
they're getting support from the rest of the team."
Next up for Stanford is a road match tonight against
the Fresno State Bulldogs (4-10). The match will be the
Cardinal's final dual of the season, as they begin preparing
for the Pac-10 tournament, which will be held at Stanford
beginning on Feb. 26.
