# Talking with the Stars
## "I've had male players say,'I wish I played on your team.'" TARA VANDERVEER, head coch 
### JAKE KELMAN 
For this week's "Talking with the Stars," The Daily proudly
presents two-time national champion women's basketball
head coach lara VanDerveer.
The Stanford Daily: So you recently won your 650 th game
overall and your s(X)th with Stanford over 20 seasons. How
have you built up the program and how have you kept it so
strong?
Tara VanDerveer: Recruiting. You have to have quality play
ers. Once you recruit quality players, you have to develop
players and then put them in a system that maximizes their
strengths and minimizes their weaknesses. And then every
once in a while you get a player like Candice [Wiggins], who
is special, or you get a post player like Brooke [Smith] who
can score, and then you build around those great players.
SD: Is it ever frustrating as a coach to deal with academic re

quirements that Stanford places on its student-athletes?
TV: It's not mission impossible, but it is very challenging. It
can be really depressing to see a great player you want to re
cruit, but they have no chance of making it academically at
Stanford. And then you're going to play against them for four
years. But that's what you understand when you work here.
You want to play at this level, you have got to study at this
level, and that's intimidating to a lot of people.
SD: In the 20 years since you have been at Stanford, have you
noticed that women's sports have turned toward the male
model where the athletics are more important than the aca
demics?
TV: Well, on our team, our women still do fit the student-ath
lete model. You look at Krista Rappahahn with a 3.9 GPA in
Human Biology. Morgan Clyburn and Ezi Okafor are pre
med. Shelly Nweke is in engineering.


NOAH HAWTORNE/The Stanford Daily
Tara VanDerveer's face, scream and energy have become a staple at Maples, after being the head coach of the Stanford
women's basketball team for 20 years.
But, what I have noticed is the
game's becoming more of an inner
city game for women. The school sys
tems that some of the kids come
from don't really prepare them for
Stanford.
SD: With this year's team, what have
you been pleased with so far and
what have you been disappointed
with?
TV: We have been more consistent
than 1 thought we would be with so
many young players. I think the num
ber one thing is the great leadership
Candice provides with how hard she
plays every day in practice. That is
just something that I think is really
special — when you have an All-
American who practices like an All-
American. That just shows the way
for other young players.
As far as things I've been disap
pointed with, it's our lack of intensi
ty. Just coming out and not respect
ing each game like, "This is a great
game, let's put the hammer down."
Every game is as important as Ten
nessee. Each game, you're challeng
ing yourself to be the best.
SD: Is it difficult for you, having
coached for 27 years, 20 at Stanford,
to get motivated for each individual
opponent?
TV: I don't feel like it is hard. I like
the games, I really enjoy practice. 1
like the preparation of it, and putting
the puzzle together. It's almost ad
dictive. I'm competitive. I want
things for this team, to challenge our
selves to see if we can be the best we
can be.
SD: Looking at your career person
ally, would you say there is a single
highlight that stands out?
TV: I can think of the first game at
Maples. It really felt like we had en
thusiasm. We had 35(H) people and
great excitement and I thought,
'We've turned the corner.'
But what is most exciting is Jen
nifer [Azzi] being back here 15 years
later — seeing these players when
they're out in their life. To see them

as lawyers, or doctors or whatever
they're doing, that's what's really ex
citing. I knew them when they were
18, 19, 20 years old, and now I see
them when they're 35-year-old adult
women. To see them with great con
fidence. I think that's the most excit
ing thing.
SD: Do you ever wish you could
have a player from say, eight years
ago, play with this team, play with
Candice?
TV: You know it's funny, there are
certain players who have said to me,
"I wish you knew me now. I wish you
coached me now because I've ma
tured." And I say to them, "I wish
you knew me now," because I think
I've matured as a coach, I've
changed, I've evolved, just like play
ers do.
SD: How do you think the presence
of the WNBA affects a player like
Candice, who is an elite player, but
she doesn't have something to look
forward to the way a J.J. Redick does
looking at his NBA career. How does
that change her experience in col
lege?
TV: Well I think J.J. Redick is maxi
mizing his college experience and 1
think Candice is maximizing her col
lege experience as well. The fact that
he'll be a millionaire when he gradu
ates and, she might be, but chances
are she won't be, it does make for dif
ferent things after graduation. But,
she's going to have a Stanford de
gree, and she's enjoying the journey.
SD: Obviously you can't win a na
tional championship every year, but
when you coach in such a successful
program like Stanford, the expecta
tions are high. Can a season be a suc
cess even if you don't win the whole
thing?
TV: Well, definitely. How many
teams have won it since I've been at
Stanford, six? I'm one of three cur
rent coaches that have won multiple
National Championships. How
many people have been to three or
more Final Fours?

What makes you do it is the emo
tion of that team. When you know
the team has spent itself. Whatever is
in them, you've gotten it out of that
team. Teams only have so much, and
if it's enough to win a National
Championship, great. There are
teams that when you lose you think,
'Wow, we got further than we
thought we could get.'
SD: There are a number of men's
coaches in women's college basket
ball. How do you feel about men
coaching women when there are no
women's coaches in the men's game?
TV: I'm very much in favor of devel
oping women coaches. We're one of
the few staffs in the country that
have an all-female staff.
I think it's unfortunate a lot of
women are not given second oppor
tunities. Men do get a second chance.
I think that's a problem in women's
basketball.There's not the recycling.
I think it would be exciting to see
women having opportunities in
men's basketball, and I think women
could make valuable contributions
to the men's game, in the same way
that men have made valuable contri
butions in women's basketball.
SI): Would you ever want to coach
men's basketball? Do you think
there is a big difference between the
games?
TV: I think there is a difference in
that they play a more vertical game. 1
enjoy men's basketball. I feel that 1
would do a good job. I think that
there would be contributions that
women could make to a men's pro
gram, and I think Rick Pitino under
stood that, having a female assistant
coach.
What you're up against more
than coaching men is the issues that
men have not seeing women as
equals, the sexism that's involved.
But, I look at the guys at Stanford,
and I think they'd be great to work
with. And, I've had male players
come up to me and say, i wish 1
played on your team."

I think it's unfortunate a lot of
women are not given second oppor
tunities. Men do get a second chance.
I think that's a problem in women's
basketball.There's not the recycling.
I think it would be exciting to see
women having opportunities in
men's basketball, and I think women
could make valuable contributions
to the men's game, in the same way
that men have made valuable contri
butions in women's basketball.
SI): Would you ever want to coach
men's basketball? Do you think
there is a big difference between the
games?
TV: I think there is a difference in
that they play a more vertical game. 1
enjoy men's basketball. I feel that 1
would do a good job. I think that
there would be contributions that
women could make to a men's pro
gram, and I think Rick Pitino under
stood that, having a female assistant
coach.
What you're up against more
than coaching men is the issues that
men have not seeing women as
equals, the sexism that's involved.
But, I look at the guys at Stanford,
and I think they'd be great to work
with. And, I've had male players
come up to me and say, i wish 1
played on your team."
For this week's "Talking with the Stars," The Daily proudly
presents two-time national champion women's basketball
head coach lara VanDerveer.
The Stanford Daily: So you recently won your 650 th game
overall and your s(X)th with Stanford over 20 seasons. How
have you built up the program and how have you kept it so
strong?
Tara VanDerveer: Recruiting. You have to have quality play
ers. Once you recruit quality players, you have to develop
players and then put them in a system that maximizes their
strengths and minimizes their weaknesses. And then every
once in a while you get a player like Candice [Wiggins], who
is special, or you get a post player like Brooke [Smith] who
can score, and then you build around those great players.
SD: Is it ever frustrating as a coach to deal with academic re

quirements that Stanford places on its student-athletes?
TV: It's not mission impossible, but it is very challenging. It
can be really depressing to see a great player you want to re
cruit, but they have no chance of making it academically at
Stanford. And then you're going to play against them for four
years. But that's what you understand when you work here.
You want to play at this level, you have got to study at this
level, and that's intimidating to a lot of people.
SD: In the 20 years since you have been at Stanford, have you
noticed that women's sports have turned toward the male
model where the athletics are more important than the aca
demics?
TV: Well, on our team, our women still do fit the student-ath
lete model. You look at Krista Rappahahn with a 3.9 GPA in
Human Biology. Morgan Clyburn and Ezi Okafor are pre
med. Shelly Nweke is in engineering.


NOAH HAWTORNE/The Stanford Daily
Tara VanDerveer's face, scream and energy have become a staple at Maples, after being the head coach of the Stanford
women's basketball team for 20 years.
But, what I have noticed is the
game's becoming more of an inner
city game for women. The school sys
tems that some of the kids come
from don't really prepare them for
Stanford.
SD: With this year's team, what have
you been pleased with so far and
what have you been disappointed
with?
TV: We have been more consistent
than 1 thought we would be with so
many young players. I think the num
ber one thing is the great leadership
Candice provides with how hard she
plays every day in practice. That is
just something that I think is really
special — when you have an All-
American who practices like an All-
American. That just shows the way
for other young players.
As far as things I've been disap
pointed with, it's our lack of intensi
ty. Just coming out and not respect
ing each game like, "This is a great
game, let's put the hammer down."
Every game is as important as Ten
nessee. Each game, you're challeng
ing yourself to be the best.
SD: Is it difficult for you, having
coached for 27 years, 20 at Stanford,
to get motivated for each individual
opponent?
TV: I don't feel like it is hard. I like
the games, I really enjoy practice. 1
like the preparation of it, and putting
the puzzle together. It's almost ad
dictive. I'm competitive. I want
things for this team, to challenge our
selves to see if we can be the best we
can be.
SD: Looking at your career person
ally, would you say there is a single
highlight that stands out?
TV: I can think of the first game at
Maples. It really felt like we had en
thusiasm. We had 35(H) people and
great excitement and I thought,
'We've turned the corner.'
But what is most exciting is Jen
nifer [Azzi] being back here 15 years
later — seeing these players when
they're out in their life. To see them

as lawyers, or doctors or whatever
they're doing, that's what's really ex
citing. I knew them when they were
18, 19, 20 years old, and now I see
them when they're 35-year-old adult
women. To see them with great con
fidence. I think that's the most excit
ing thing.
SD: Do you ever wish you could
have a player from say, eight years
ago, play with this team, play with
Candice?
TV: You know it's funny, there are
certain players who have said to me,
"I wish you knew me now. I wish you
coached me now because I've ma
tured." And I say to them, "I wish
you knew me now," because I think
I've matured as a coach, I've
changed, I've evolved, just like play
ers do.
SD: How do you think the presence
of the WNBA affects a player like
Candice, who is an elite player, but
she doesn't have something to look
forward to the way a J.J. Redick does
looking at his NBA career. How does
that change her experience in col
lege?
TV: Well I think J.J. Redick is maxi
mizing his college experience and 1
think Candice is maximizing her col
lege experience as well. The fact that
he'll be a millionaire when he gradu
ates and, she might be, but chances
are she won't be, it does make for dif
ferent things after graduation. But,
she's going to have a Stanford de
gree, and she's enjoying the journey.
SD: Obviously you can't win a na
tional championship every year, but
when you coach in such a successful
program like Stanford, the expecta
tions are high. Can a season be a suc
cess even if you don't win the whole
thing?
TV: Well, definitely. How many
teams have won it since I've been at
Stanford, six? I'm one of three cur
rent coaches that have won multiple
National Championships. How
many people have been to three or
more Final Fours?

What makes you do it is the emo
tion of that team. When you know
the team has spent itself. Whatever is
in them, you've gotten it out of that
team. Teams only have so much, and
if it's enough to win a National
Championship, great. There are
teams that when you lose you think,
'Wow, we got further than we
thought we could get.'
SD: There are a number of men's
coaches in women's college basket
ball. How do you feel about men
coaching women when there are no
women's coaches in the men's game?
TV: I'm very much in favor of devel
oping women coaches. We're one of
the few staffs in the country that
have an all-female staff.
I think it's unfortunate a lot of
women are not given second oppor
tunities. Men do get a second chance.
I think that's a problem in women's
basketball.There's not the recycling.
