For this week's "Talking with the Stars," The Daily proudly
presents two-time national champion women's basketball
head coach lara VanDerveer.
The Stanford Daily: So you recently won your 650 th game
overall and your s(X)th with Stanford over 20 seasons. How
have you built up the program and how have you kept it so
strong?
Tara VanDerveer: Recruiting. You have to have quality play
ers. Once you recruit quality players, you have to develop
players and then put them in a system that maximizes their
strengths and minimizes their weaknesses. And then every
once in a while you get a player like Candice [Wiggins], who
is special, or you get a post player like Brooke [Smith] who
can score, and then you build around those great players.
SD: Is it ever frustrating as a coach to deal with academic re

quirements that Stanford places on its student-athletes?
TV: It's not mission impossible, but it is very challenging. It
can be really depressing to see a great player you want to re
cruit, but they have no chance of making it academically at
Stanford. And then you're going to play against them for four
years. But that's what you understand when you work here.
You want to play at this level, you have got to study at this
level, and that's intimidating to a lot of people.
SD: In the 20 years since you have been at Stanford, have you
noticed that women's sports have turned toward the male
model where the athletics are more important than the aca
demics?
TV: Well, on our team, our women still do fit the student-ath
lete model. You look at Krista Rappahahn with a 3.9 GPA in
Human Biology. Morgan Clyburn and Ezi Okafor are pre
med. Shelly Nweke is in engineering.
