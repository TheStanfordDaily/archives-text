# Olympic-sized addiction

The opening ceremonies for the
Torino Olympic games did not
bode well for the upcoming two
weeks. As has been my ritual for every
Olympic Games I can remember, I sat
down, excited for the start of the two
week TV viewing binge that will in
evitably add come curvy letters to my
transcript.
But this year, I switched over to the
series finale of "Arrested Develop
ment" before the flame had even been
lit. You were probably smart enough
not to watch the ceremonies, but trust
me — roller bladers with actual torch
es mounted on their backs are not near
ly as exciting as they sound. 1 was con
cerned. If this Olympics was going to be
introduced by one of the worst opening
ceremonies ever, what would that
mean for the rest of the Games?
Fortunately, the appeal of the rest of
the Olympics has turned out to be
much greater than that of the tacky
opening ceremonies. 1 can still turn on
the TV and be captivated no matter
what is on. The Olympics have the
amazing ability to make even the most
mundane or obscure events interesting.
So far, 1 have watched cross-country
skiing, luge, snowboarding, women's
hockey, speed skating, curling and pairs
figure skating. With the exception of
snowboarding, under regular circum
stances I would rather watch TLC's "A
Wedding Story" than sit down and
watch any of these sports. But some
how when it's the Olympics, I can't rip
my eyes from the screen.
Take my experience with pairs fig
ure skating Monday night. First off, it is
a really big step for me to admit it, but I
did watch figure skating — and en
joyed it. Don't get me wrong. I like fig
ure skating about as much as Adam
Morrison likes a razor. I don't care
about the routines, the costumes are
ridiculous, and the songs put me to
sleep. But I still watched.
Somehow I got caught up in the
drama of the Chinese team, made up of
three of the best pairs in the world, try
ing to catch up to the Russian reigning
world champs. The Russians/Soviets
had won gold in 12 straight Olympics
entering this year's competition, and
the Chinese were tired of coming in
second. I couldn't help but watch, as the
final Chinese pair came out on the ice,
needing a perfect run in their free skate
to win.
It turns out that on the first jump, the
woman fell — hard. She slammed her
knee into the ice on a failed quadruple
salchow, and it looked like the team was
out of the medals. They stopped the
music, and she skated over to the
bench. But her coach poked at her knee
and sent her back out to finish the rou
tine. Surprisingly, the Chinese pair
ended up getting silver. It was awesome
— I was totally captivated by a little,2o
- Chinese girl doing something
that makes my eyes water out of bore
dom at the very thought of it.
How does this happen? How do I
end up watching two hours of pairs fig
ure skating when I have a midterm in
two days?
NBC's coverage of the Olympics
certainly doesn't help my study habits.
They go to commercial right before the
conclusion of any event. They relay to
you every human interest story that
they could possibly find. They do a bet
ter job building up an emotional attach
ment to the athletes than any other
sport's coverage possibly could.
Obviously I want the Americans to
succeed. Nothing ticks me off more
than looking at the medal table and
seeing the US in fourth place and be
