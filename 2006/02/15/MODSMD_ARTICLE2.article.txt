## Speed dating raises funds Branner Students Organize Valentine's Day Alternative 
### DEBORAH SOHN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Branner Hall's lounge was overrun
with students from all over campus last
night — students eager to celebrate
Valentine's Day in an unorthodox manner
at the dorm's second annual "speed dat
ing" event.
Branner's dorm government organized
and sponsored the event, which carried a
$2 cover charge. Organizers said they
planned to donate the proceeds to the

Casa Hogar Orphanage in Oaxaca, Mexi
co.
While the traditional meaning of
Valentine's Day is one of love and rela
tionships, many students at Branner con
sidered it a unique opportunity to raise
money for charity.
Though residents initially wanted to
adopt a child with the proceeds from the
event, the inability to maintain these re
sponsibilities during vacations led the
dorm to support the orphanage instead.
Freshman Nicole Kim, Branner's treas
urer, explained that the members of dorm
government planned the speed dating
event as a fun way to celebrate the holiday
while simultaneously raising money.
Senior Rob Liu, a Branner resident as

sistant, explained that the success of last
year's Valentine's Day festivities encour
aged the dorm to repeat the event again
this year. He added that he expected the
speed dating tradition to continue in years
to come.
"It probably will become an annual
event,"he said.
Liu added that he hoped the event
would be appealing to students and would
help to mitigate some complaints about
Stanford's social scene.
According to Kim, preparations for the
event began weeks ago, but much of the
planning took place yesterday. To adver
tise the event, she explained that Bran-

ner's dorm government posted an
announcement on Facebook.com,
put up fliers around campus and an
nounced the event at house meet
ings.
As participants arrived last night,
they signed in and were assigned a
number. They were also given
nametags to write down their names
and numbers of potentially compati
ble partners. In addition, partici
pants were supplied with a handout
filled with questions to ask each
other. Some questions were serious,
such as "What are your religious be
liefs?" while others were intended to
be more fun, like, "Do you laugh
when people fall in the Olympics?"
In the lounge, males and females
lined up in two rows facing each
other, and every two minutes, the
guys moved down a seat to meet the
next girl in line. While there were ini
tially more girls than guys, the crowd
became more balanced as the night
went on.
Participants were instructed to
write down the numbers of people
who interested them. Kim explained
that if two people indicated each
other, their contact information
would be exchanged.

According to some of the stu
dents at the event, however, it
seemed that most participants did
not come with hopes of finding a
special Valentine.
Two participants, who wished to
remain anonymous, told The Daily
that they came "just for fun" and "to
see what it was like." Neither student
actually wrote down the numbers of
people they met.
Liu also said that he participated
simply for the fun of it. As an RA
who had helped plan and organize
the event, he said he thought every
thing had run smoothly.
While some students participated
for amusement, others came be
cause of the charitable aspect. Kim
explained that the Branner residents
are, for the most part, supportive of
fundraising events. She noted that
the dorm's government has been ac
tive in fundraising throughout the
year and that the next big event will
be a fashion show.
According to Kim. all funds
raised through these events will be
donated to the Casa Hogar Orphan
age.
Though the speed dating was sup
posed to last from 8:30 to 10 p.m., it
continued well past its allotted time
and concluded at 10:30 p.m. Many,
however, lingered and continued to
talk with one another. At the end of
the night, the total tally for funds
raised reached almost $200.
