## Speed dating raises funds Branner Students Organize Valentine's Day Alternative 
### DEBORAH SOHN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Branner Hall's lounge was overrun
with students from all over campus last
night â€” students eager to celebrate
Valentine's Day in an unorthodox manner
at the dorm's second annual "speed dat

Branner's dorm government organized
and sponsored the event, which carried a

Casa Hogar Orphanage in Oaxaca, Mexi

government planned the speed dating
event as a fun way to celebrate the holiday
while simultaneously raising money.
Senior Rob Liu, a Branner resident as

year's Valentine's Day festivities encour

this year. He added that he expected the
speed dating tradition to continue in years
to come.
"It probably will become an annual
event,"he said.
Liu added that he hoped the event
would be appealing to students and would
help to mitigate some complaints about
Stanford's social scene.
According to Kim, preparations for the
event began weeks ago, but much of the
planning took place yesterday. To adver
tise the event, she explained that Bran-
