# TRACK AND FIELD
## Runners breeze past school records, again 
### ISRAEL ROJAS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Wake up. Brush teeth. Break record.
Rewriting the Stanford track record hooks seems
to be becoming almost second-nature for sophomore
Chauntae Bayne.
For the second week in a row, Bayne broke the
school record in the 2(H) meters,dropping her old time
of 23.5 seconds down to 23.41 seconds, and making the
extraordinary seem almost routine.
The Cardinal visited Razorback country this week
end, traveling to Fayettcville. Ark. for the Tyson Invi

tational and a chance to qualify more athletes for
NCAAs. Not even three weekends of competition
away from home was enough to discourage the Stan
ford athletes, as several proceeded to set new person
al bests.
Bayne was not the only runner breaking her own
records this weekend, as junior Janice Davis also
made her presence known. Just last weekend at the
Husker Invitational, Davis tied her school record in
the 60 meter sprint. However, this time Davis went all
the way — breaking the record with a registered time
of 7.30 seconds, just one-hundredth of a second better
than her previous best.

Two world records were broken this weekend, by
non-Stanford athletes. University of Arkansas junior
Wallace Spearmon set the 300 meter record with a
time of 31.88 seconds, before running the second leg in
the record breaking 4X400 meter relay. Running the
other three legs were University of Florida junior
Kerron Clement, Baylor graduate-turned-pro Darold
Williamson, and Olympic 400 meter champion, Jere
my Wariner. The 2,500 fans on hand cheered as
Wariner rounded the final turn with the record in
sight.
Cardinal sophomore Wopamo
Osaisai was one of those in atten
dance, although his sentiments
were a mixture of admiration and
envy.
"1 should be running with those
guys and not just watching," Osaisai
said. "You've got to respect the ac
complishments but also acknowl
edge them as competition."
Osaisai had a tumultuous week
end. as he ran his slowest time of
the year in the 60 meters. He stum
bled a couple times during the race
and finally injured himself when he
crashed head first into a railing at
the finish line. While most might
have called it a weekend, Osaisai
decided he'd still run the 200 me
ters. And somehow, he managed to
run a career best time of 21.6 sec
onds.
The invitational gave Stanford
its first taste of championship-cal
iber competition. Several SEC
powerhouses, including Louisiana
State and Arkansas, along with
other schools, such as Texas, gave
the Cardinal fierce competition not
normally seen until the NCAA
championships.
"It is always good to get out and
see what these guys are made of,"
said senior Michael Robertson,
who had a mildly successful week
end in the throwing events.
The distance teams also had a
successful outing. Sophomore Rus
sell Brown became the sixth Stan
ford runner ever to break the four
minute mile barrier, finishing in
3:59.65. Red-shirt freshman Gar
rett Heath won another heat of the
mile in 4:03.32. Both times were
provisional qualifiers, along with
sophomore Neftalem Araia's
13:52.81 in the 5000 meters. Red
shirt freshman Hari Mix won the
3000 meters with a time of 8:11.34.
On the women's side, junior Ar
ianna Lambie won the 3000 meters
in an automatic qualifying time of
9:07.65. Sophomore Katy Trotter
also hit the auto mark, finishing in
9:15.16, while her twin sister Aman
da achieved the provisional mark
with a time of 9:27.58. Also reach
ing a provisional mark was junior
Ashley Freeman, who ran a 2:07.51
in the 800 meters.
The large crowd presented a fun
challenge for the Cardinal. An ex
pected cheering bias towards the
Arkansas athletes was evident, as
the stadium would erupt whenever
the Razorbacks relay team would
pass up another school's runners. In
a sport where crowds are generally
sparse, the energy fans bring can
have an electrifying effect on track
and field athletes.
"I am sure that it sparked us as
much as them," Robertson said.
