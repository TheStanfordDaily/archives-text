# TRACK AND FIELD
## Runners breeze past school records, again 
### ISRAEL ROJAS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Wake up. Brush teeth. Break record.
Rewriting the Stanford track record hooks seems
to be becoming almost second-nature for sophomore
Chauntae Bayne.
For the second week in a row, Bayne broke the
school record in the 2(H) meters,dropping her old time
of 23.5 seconds down to 23.41 seconds, and making the
extraordinary seem almost routine.
The Cardinal visited Razorback country this week
end, traveling to Fayettcville. Ark. for the Tyson Invi

tational and a chance to qualify more athletes for
NCAAs. Not even three weekends of competition
away from home was enough to discourage the Stan
ford athletes, as several proceeded to set new person
al bests.
Bayne was not the only runner breaking her own
records this weekend, as junior Janice Davis also
made her presence known. Just last weekend at the
Husker Invitational, Davis tied her school record in
the 60 meter sprint. However, this time Davis went all
the way â€” breaking the record with a registered time
of 7.30 seconds, just one-hundredth of a second better
than her previous best.

Two world records were broken this weekend, by
non-Stanford athletes. University of Arkansas junior
Wallace Spearmon set the 300 meter record with a
time of 31.88 seconds, before running the second leg in
the record breaking 4X400 meter relay. Running the
other three legs were University of Florida junior
Kerron Clement, Baylor graduate-turned-pro Darold
Williamson, and Olympic 400 meter champion, Jere
my Wariner. The 2,500 fans on hand cheered as
Wariner rounded the final turn with the record in
sight.
