One year ago, head coach Walt
Harris' hire highlighted a complete
overhaul of the Stanford football
coaching staff. This year, the coach
ing ranks are again in upheaval as
four of the team's top assistant
coaches have departed for the NFL.
The departures are defensive co
ordinator and secondary coach Tom
Hayes, running backs coach Wayne
Moses, special teams coach and out
side linebackers coach Tom Quinn
and recruiting coordinator
Nathaniel Hackett, all who have left
for the NFL.
Hayes will take over as the defen
sive backs coach for the New Or
leans Saints, Moses as the running
back coach for the St. Louis Rams,
Quinn as the special teams coach for
the New York Giants and Hackett as
the quality control coach for the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where his
father Paul also coaches.
Only one of the four vacancies
has been filled. Yesterday, A.J.
Christoff was announced as defen
sive coordinator/defensive backs
coach. Christoff, who spent the last
year as the secondary coach for the
49ers, was also Stanford's defensive
coordinator in 1983 under head
coach Paul Wiggins, and 2(X)3-2(X)4
under head coach Buddy Teevens.
"A.J. brings with him tremendous
experience and knowledge of defen
sive football both at the collegiate
and NFL levels," Harris said. "He is
also familiar with Stanford Universi
ty, is a veteran of the Pac-10 and is a
great fit for our program. We're very
fortunate to have A.J. join our staff."
