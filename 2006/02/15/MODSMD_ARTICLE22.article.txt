# Unfortunate weather conditions make for a difficult weekend on the water
## Come wind or shine... Women and coeds each place sixth in separate regattas 
### BETH THOMPSON 
The Stanford women's sailing team over
came severe wind gusts this past weekend in
North Carolina to place sixth overall in the
Charleston Women's Regatta.
The College of Charleston hosted the
Charleston Women's Regatta, in which Yale
came in first of 15 teams.
In Charleston on Saturday the wind was 25-

to-30 mph. Sunday wasn't much better, with 20
mph gusts. In winds that intense, physical size
becomes an important factor.
"We had some trouble in the breeze be
cause we weren't quite big enough," said junior
Caroline Young. Despite the size disadvan
tage. Young and her crew, junior Becca Levin,
took seventh in the A-division.
Sophomore Evan Brown and her crew
sophomore Carrie Denning took third in the
B-division.
"We thought we did really well," said
Young. "We only placed behind teams that
were alreadv ranked above us."

For the Cardinal, the meet was a learning
experience and a practice round for Nationals,
which will also be held at the College of
Charleston.
"We went in looking to see what we're
going to work on," Young.said
While the women were battling the wind, a
coed team represented the Cardinal at the
North/South 1&2 Regatta hosted by San Jose
State. On Lake Champagne, the weather was
much gentler— too gentle even.
On Saturday the wind was light, puffy and
shifty. Such calm weather made it hard to start
a race, but there still managed to be six races in

each division.
Freshmen TJ Tullo and Marisa Choy, the
skipper and crew respectively, finished third in
A-Division. Sophomores Craig Paige, skipper,
and Beth Hoover, crew, finished fourth, one
point behind TUllo and Choy.
Junior Graham Brant-Zawadski and
crew sophomore Sarah Schoknecht led the
B-division with a fourth place finish. Sopho
mores Jonah Greenberger. skipper, and
Merrit Kennedy, crew, followed in fifth
place.
Due to a complete lack of wind on Sunday,
the races were called off at 2 p.m

Weather proved to be the biggest obstacle, as the calm conditions on Lake Champagne caused an early end to the regatta, while strong winds in North Carolina showed Stanford's weaknesses.
