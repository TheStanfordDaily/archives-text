## Championship in sight for No. 9 Stanford fencing 
### ANDREW SHEN 
The ninth-ranked Stanford fencing team
emerged from their most important tourna
ment to date with exceptional results. On the
women's side, the Cardinal lost only to na
tional champion Notre Dame and UC San
Diego, by scores of 20-7 and 17-10, respec
tively. By defeating archrival Air Force in a
thrilling 15-12 match and taking care of Cal
State Fullerton, CIT and Army, the women
finished with a 4-2 record.
Freshman Eva Jellison did her best to sal
vage the loss against Notre Dame. She hand
ed sophomore Mariel Zagunis, the reigning
Olympic gold-medalist, just her third loss in

two seasons by a decisive 5-1 score. Jellison
described her emotions following the bout as
"mostly disbelief."
"My coaches always tell me I have the
ability to beat anyone, and in this case 1 just
bared down and trusted myself. Beating her
was definitely a highlight and it has given me
that little extra boost of confidence for future
meets," Jellison said.
She also credited fellow freshman Teddy
Levitt for giving her the advice to stay close
while moving backwards, a technique which
resulted in three scores.
Brittany Leader, another freshman, de
feated former NCAA finalist Amy Orlando,
of Notre Dame, en route to an 11-4 record for

the tournament.
Jellison led the team with a 14-1 record,
while senior Aileen Maloney and sophomore
Rebecca Illowsky earned records of 12-3 and
11-4, respectively.
Freshman Ellie Wen had a personal career
day.
"Ellie had probably her best day of fenc
ing ever and beat many top ranked oppo
nents. It was like everything just clicked for
her; she was on fire. It was really exciting to
watch." said Leader.
As impressive as the women were, the
men were even more outstanding.
Defeating five of the six opponents by a
combined score of 99-36, the Cardinal men

were dominant. While losing to Notre Dame
17-10 was a blemish on their record, senior
Martin Lee assessed the tournament as a suc
cess on the whole.
"I'm a little disappointed that we didn't
beat Notre Dame, but we did beat Air Force,
our strongest opponent in our region. The
team had some pretty strong results overall."
said Lee, who won his bout against Notre
Dame and finished 11-1.
Senior captain Steve Gerberman did not
lose a single bout, gaining 15 victories.
Among Gerberman's highlights was a 5-4
victory over All-American Notre Dame
sophomore Jakub Jedrkowiak
after being down 4-1.
Junior Curtis Andrus and soph
omore Richard Fulton also con
tributed, with records 13-2 and 12-
3, respectively.
But the Cardinal could not
weather the storm against the
Fighting Irish, who reeled off five
straight wins after a 3-3 deadlock
to start the match. Freshman Dan
Tucker lost a nail biter against Je
drkowiak 5-4 during the stretch
when Andrus, Fulton, Levitt and
freshman Clayton Kenney all lost
bouts in succession.
Despite the loss to Notre Dame,
the Cardinal have positioned
themselves nicely as the team to
beat in the Western Regionals by
defeating Air Force. The team will
now prepare for the first round of
the NCAA championships on
March 4 at the U.S. Air Force Acad
emy.
"The NCAA championship
seems more attainable now, but I
won't promise anything," Jellison
said.
