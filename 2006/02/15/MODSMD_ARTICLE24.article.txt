# SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING
## Unbeaten synchro dominate in homecoming Card earn highest team score of the year, sweep solo, duet and trio 
### JOHN CHOCK 
A spirited home crowd got its first glimpse of
Stanford's top-ranked synchronized swimming
team, as the Cardinal (6-0) brought their unbeaten
record home to face No. 9 Arizona and No. 4 Alaba
ma-Birmingham in the Stanford Invitational. The
Cardinal won all four events, recorded season-high
scores in three and finished with 90 points to UAB's
59 and Arizona's 32.
But in a meet that saw Stanford push its perfect
season to new heights, the defining moment was
one that happened out of sight and underwater.
With the setting sun in their eyes, Stanford's
team of eight began the final lap of the team pro
gram. They pulled into a pinwheel formation
against the East wall of Belardi Pool, then slid be
neath the surface.
T\vo of the Cardinal swam to the deepest part of
the pool where, without touching bottom, they
began to tread water and steadied the feet of junior
Liz Markman. Sophomore Missy Knight climbed
atop Markman's shoulders, and sat in a crouch at
the top of the stack, still completely submerged.
In a flurry of bubbles, the bottom two lifted
Markman, who upon standing and breaking the
surface launched Knight into the air. Knight leapt
V

forward, vaulted over the outstretched arms of
sophomore Courtenay Stewart, and sailed well
above the surface of the pool before diving back
into the water. The crowd erupted in cheers as the
rest of the team rushed for the surface and fell into
place.
That team performance earned the Cardinal a
score of 95.50, easily their highest mark this year.
"It takes a 1(X) percent effort from each person
just to get [ Knight j out of the water," Markman ex
plained. "The mechanics are complicated, and the
most difficult part is timing."
But a relentless dedication to timing, mechanics
and teamwork defines this year's synchro squad.
"In a team event, you're surrounded by seven
other people," sophomore captain Sara Lowe said
of her team's synergy. "It's an amazing feeling to
feed off that energy and excitement."
For the Stanford Invitational. Lowe asked her
teammates to swim as they would at the Collegiate
Nationals.
"We give ourselves a scenario," Lowe said.
"Today I told them,' This is the last day of Nationals,
and we're a tenth behind Ohio State, our big rival,
so put yourself in that scene and compete like you
would.' I think everyone went out and put in as
much effort as they had."
Lowe, a 2004 Olympian, also recorded a season
best 93.75 in the solo competition. Her crisp, clean
performance to a medley from "Tbe Phantom of
the Opera" featured hauntingly smooth spins and
brought a hush to the crowd.

"Sara is technically stronger than anyone in the
solo event," head coach Heather Olson said. "She is
stable and has a very difficult routine. Because of
her strength she is able to execute the routine well."
Stanford also claimed the top two spots in both
the trio and duet competitions. Sophomore Poppy
Carlig, Knight and freshman Erin Bell won their
event for the first time with a score of 89.50. In the
duet. Lowe and Stewart recorded a season-best
93.25.
Alabama-Birmingham had two strong soloists
in Sara Petrov and Maria Garcia, who took second
and third places with scores of 88.50 and 87.50, re
spectively.
Next week the Cardinal travel to Massachusetts,
where they will face No. 7 Wheaton College.
"I am expecting Wheaton to be a very positive
meet with strong swims," Olson said. "Wheaton is
the location for Collegiate Nationals in 2007, so it is
also a great opportunity for the team to get com
fortable in next year's pool."
But for now, the upcoming championship com
mands Olson's attention.
"We had some great feedback from the judges to
help us in our training for Collegiate Nationals,"
Olson said. "We are still looking to improve our lift
height and will make minor changes over the next
few weeks to improve the routine. I am not sure if
the team even realized how high their scores were,
but [assistant coach] Shannon [Montague] and I
definitely took note. It is a great sign to us that we
are on the right track."
