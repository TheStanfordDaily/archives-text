## Alum recounts NASA experience Speaker encourages students to pursue jobs and internships in space exploration 
### DENISE SOHN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Far and away the best prize that life has to offer is the
chance to work hard at work worth doing." These words from
President Theodore Roosevelt, according to Stanford alumna
and astronaut Ellen Ochoa, inspired her to pursue work at
NASA. Speaking yesterday in Cubberly Auditorium as part of
the University's "Call to Serve Campaign," Ochoa said that she
hoped these words would inspire her audience as well.
The campaign is designed to encourage students to consid
er government work and internships, said Megan Swezey Fog
arty. the program's coordinator. The campaign serves both to
inspire students and provide practical information, she said.
"Over half of the government workforce is eligible to retire
in the next five years," Fogarty said. As a result, there has been
recently great efforts made to encourage students to enter ca
reers in the federal government.
Ochoa, who received her Master's and Ph.D in electrical en
gineering from Stanford, is a veteran of four space flights and
was a natural choice to speak at the event.
"She has reached the pinnacle of government service in en
gineering, which is work in NASA." Fogarty said.
Ochoa said that her Stanford education was vital to her ca
reer choice, explaining that one of the most important criteria
that NASA considers is educational background. She credited
Stanford for providing her the first-rate education necessary
for her work.
Ochoa went on to describe the breadth of the connection
between NASA and Stanford. NASA is the largest federal em
ployer of Stanford engineers, and there are 18 current and for
mer astronauts that are Stanford graduates â€” the most from
any university. Ochoa also said that she first considered apply
ing to work at NASA while as a graduate student at Stanford.
' Ochoa detailed her experiences, sprinkled with interesting
anecdotes. She revealed that NASA has the largest swimming
pool in the world and that there are over 2,000 switches in the
cockpit of the space shuttle. Ochoa also provided insight into
the training process, which includes learning how to make tents
and sleeping bags out of parachutes, and undergoing simulation
exercises in the "Vomit Comet."
She also showed a video of her April 2002 space mission
aboard the STS-110. Among her crew members were Steve
Smith, another Stanford graduate, and UC-Berkeley alumnus
Rex Walhcim. Ochoa joked that a Stanford-Cal rivalry existed,
even in space.
After her speech. Ochoa conducted a question-and-answer
session during which she elaborated on her own path toward a
career at NASA. She described the difficulties she faced as a
woman pursuing engineering and explained that female engi-
neers were very rare in 1976, when she
was an undergraduate.
Finally. Ochoa took a stance on the
significance of space exploration, sup
porting the "fundamental notion that,
as humans, we need to understand our
world." She said that exploration also
provides us with a better "understand
ing of ourselves and our capabilities."
She also said she believed a time
would come when life on Earth may
not be possible, and that space explo
ration represents a step toward find
ing solutions. Also, the current space
program has great practical benefits as
well, as it "fuels a very productive in
dustry, both economically and techno
logically," she said.
Ochoa remains involved with
NASA and the astronaut program as
the deputy chief of the Astronaut Of
fice. even though she will never again
go into space. She said that she hopes
young people will think about careers
in NASA, reminding the audience
that they do not have to wait to get in
volved. She said that myriad opportu
nities to work at NASA are available
for both undergraduates and gradu
ates, and encouraged students to con
sider those options.
Staci King, a junior, said her inter
est in space motivated her to attended.
Though she said she was not consider
ing becoming an astronaut,she was in
terested in internships at NASA.
Information about these opportu
nities was provided for students out
side the auditorium.
