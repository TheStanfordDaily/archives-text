## Hospital awaits OK for Redwood City expansion 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
After purchasing four buildings from
now defunct company Excite@Home, Stan
ford Hospital is planning a major expansion
in Redwood City. However, chapter 715 of
the Service Employees International Union
(SEIU) has organized opposition to the de
velopment unless Stanford agrees to addi

tional workforce restrictions.
In November, SEIU â€”,\p>which repre
sents 1,400 of the 8,40() workers at the Hos
pital and the Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital, released a poll showing that 79
percent of Redwood City residents would
not support the expansion unless Stanford
adopted a set of community standards.
SEIU spokesman Greg Pullman said
that the union was not necessarily op

posed to the expansion: rather, it wanted
the Hospital to take other factors into con
sideration.
"We've never been opposed to the proj
ect," he said, "but we believe that the Red
wood City Council should ensure that Stan
ford adopts good standards that ensure
Stanford is a good neighbor and employer,
and we continue to advocate for that."
The proposed standards include indus

try standardized wages, limited environ
mental impact, community access to health
care, adequate parking for employees and
an effort to mitigate traffic.
Larry Carr. director of government rela
tions for the Hospital, rejected the SEIU
poll's findings.
"Actually, the poll said that more than 80
percent of Redwood City residents
were in favor of the clinic being
built," he said. "What [the poll] also
asked of residents was whether
there should be a certain communi
ty standard that Stanford is held up
to, and that's how they based their
assumptions about whether people
wanted the hospital or not."
Carr added that the communities
closest to the proposed expansion
site are in favor of the new growth.
"We've been meeting with the
neighborhood association we're ad
jacent to," he said. "They're really in
support of our project. The Cham
ber of commerce has endorsed our
project."
The new facility would provide
outpatient care, which means that no
patients would stay overnight. No
new clinics would be created; rather,
existing ones would move out of the
current Hospital into the new build
ings. The expanded site would total
360,000 square-feet and would allow
the Hospital to move several of its
clinics to Redwood City to free up
more space at its main location.
Helen Wilmont, vice president of
clinics for the Hospital, described
the services that will be transferred

to the Redwood City location.
"Right now, we're planning on
moving orthopedics, our sleep clin
ics, dermatology, and the ambulato
ry surgery center, among others,"
she said. "The fact that it's a new
campus enables us to do some new
exciting and different patient cen
tered care. It allows us to customize
the building towards the patient."
Carr explained that the Hospital
needed to expand due to the chang
ing nature of healthcare.
"The direction we see healthcare
going is to bring more services out
into the communities, rather than in
a central location," he said. "So by
moving clinics out into the commu
nities people have better access to
their health care needs."

Hospital officials also hope to al
leviate its space shortage, because its
size is constrained by its location on
campus. By moving some clinics out
of the Hospital, they plan to free up
space for state-mandated seismic
retrofitting, which would make the
facility safer in the event of an earth
quake.
According to Carr, the Redwood
City site also offers unique advan
tages. Not only is it close to campus,
it is also located right off of Highway
101, making it more easily accessible
to patients than the main Hospital
campus. The buildings are part of
Redwood City's Midpoint Technol
ogy Park, and the proximity to the
park may prove to be a boon for the
Hospital's research activities.

"The fact that it's a new campus enables us to do some
new exciting and different patient centered care. It allows
us to custom ize the building towards the patient.

Although escrow has completed
and the Hospital owns the buildings,
it still needs approval from the plan
ning commission before renovations
can begin. Though the land is zoned
for the Hospital's use, the building
permits indicate that they are to be
used for recreation and develop
ment. Accordingly, the Hospital
must get an amendment to the
planned development permit before
it can use the buildings.
Salisli Merrin, an employee on
the planning commission, said the
approval process has barely begun.
"If they have submitted anything
it's only conceptual plans," he said.
"So there is nothing at a very hard
and fast level. It's all very conceptu
al right now."
