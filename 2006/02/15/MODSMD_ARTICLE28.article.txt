## Alumni plan new Google alternative 
### STEPHANIE FAGLIANO STAFF WRITER 
Stanford alumni Anand Raj ar am an and
Venky Harinarayan are working to develop
and launch "Kosmix "a new search engine they
hope will compete with Google. The co
founders claim that their product, which ap
plies a new kind of technology that allows users
to define categories for their search to narrow
down results, is an improvement upon Google,
which presents results based on the popularity
of Web sites.
Computer Science Prof. Gio Wiederhold
said that the creation of a categorically-based
search engine is no easy task.
"Categorization narrows the search indeed."
he said. "But since the Web is not pre-catego
rized, much processing is needed to determine
the context of a Web page and then categorize it
as well as possible."
Wiederhold added that the logistics of select
ing a search category may lead to variations in
search results.
"People use very different categorizations"
he said. "And one person's category — say or
ganizing cars by their maximum speed — does
little for another person, who goes by style. And
within style there'd be many different views. The
search engine must avoid imposing its catego
rization on the users-if it does it will look like a
bureaucracy."
Computer Science Prof. Bill Dally said that
the new search engine would be easy to get on
line, but its popularity is, in some respects, out of
the co-founders' hands.
"Launching a new search engine can be done
very quickly" he said. "If they have access to a
server and very high-bandwidth Internet access,
they should be able to offer the service in a few
weeks — assuming that their development is al
ready done. Whether it catches on and how long
it takes if it does is anyone's guess. It's hard to
predict how users will react to a new offering."
Students interested in working on their own
search engines can find plenty of classes at Stan
ford to prepare them for the task.
" There are many CS classes that deal with as
pects of search, databases and Internet tech
nologies" Dally said. "Our algorithms classes
cover the fundamentals on which all search en
gines are based, and our database classes cover
more detailed techniques for indexing and
searching data."
Wiederhold reminded ambitious students
that attending these classes does not guarantee
the creation of a successful search engine.
"The classes can only give the background."
he said. "It is up to inventors to try to apply the
theory to the messy real world."
Wiederhold also warned that it is impractical
to imagine courses specifically designed to im
prove Internet searches.
"Before you'd have the curriculum organ
ized it would be obsolete." he said. "None of the
references I collected in earlier years for my
CS73 seminar are relevant anymore. There
might be a place for a book, if it doesn't exist yet:
'Web Searching for Dummies,' but that should
not be a Stanford product."
Even if Kosmix makes it on to In
ternet, whether or not it catches on is
a wholly different story.
"If Kosmix can find a niche, like
finding the best Valentine's Day
present, for which there is both a
consumer and an advertiser market,
they should be able to make it,"
Wiederhold said. *"lTiey will have to
find many niches, though, to become
visible every day of the year."
Students were mixed about
whether a categorical search engine
like Kosmix could compete with
Google's dominance.

"[A categorical search engine]
would probably be helpful," said Dak
Steiert,a junior. "It would be nice if it
returned fewer random results be
cause of the categories. Google's
thing is that they have really good
processes to search the information
by, and quickly, but it still returns a lot
of stuff you don't want. So if you have
a two-part search where you put in a
category as well, if they designed it
right I think it would give you a lot
more usable results."
While some students agreed with
Steiert that a categorical search en
gine would be worth the shot, the ma
jority of those interviewed said they
would remain true to Google.
"There's no need to type in the
category because if you're a good
enough searcher you type in the key
words you need and get the results

you want," said Michael Bateman, a
sophomore. "I wouldn't switch from
Google."
Similarly, Internet users who are
comfortable with Google may not see
a need to switch.
"[Kosmix] won't be big because
everyone just uses Google," said
Daniel Zavala, a sophomore.
"Google has it covered. We don't
need a new search engine."
Not only does Google have it cov
ered, some students said that it goes
above and beyond their expectations
for a basic search engine.
Sophomore Arie Salih pointed to
the site's other features such as
Google maps and Google news.
While Kosmix could theoretically
enhance the depth of a given search, it
may never have the chance to prove it
self if it can't escape Google's shadow.

Students interested in working on their own
search engines can find plenty of classes at Stan
ford to prepare them for the task.
" There are many CS classes that deal with as
pects of search, databases and Internet tech
nologies" Dally said. "Our algorithms classes
cover the fundamentals on which all search en
gines are based, and our database classes cover
more detailed techniques for indexing and
searching data."
Wiederhold reminded ambitious students
that attending these classes does not guarantee
the creation of a successful search engine.
"The classes can only give the background."
he said. "It is up to inventors to try to apply the
theory to the messy real world."
Wiederhold also warned that it is impractical
to imagine courses specifically designed to im
prove Internet searches.
"Before you'd have the curriculum organ
ized it would be obsolete." he said. "None of the
references I collected in earlier years for my
CS73 seminar are relevant anymore. There
might be a place for a book, if it doesn't exist yet:
'Web Searching for Dummies,' but that should
not be a Stanford product."
Even if Kosmix makes it on to In
ternet, whether or not it catches on is
a wholly different story.
"If Kosmix can find a niche, like
finding the best Valentine's Day
present, for which there is both a
consumer and an advertiser market,
they should be able to make it,"
Wiederhold said. *"lTiey will have to
find many niches, though, to become
visible every day of the year."
Students were mixed about
whether a categorical search engine
like Kosmix could compete with
Google's dominance.

"[A categorical search engine]
would probably be helpful," said Dak
Steiert,a junior. "It would be nice if it
returned fewer random results be
cause of the categories. Google's
thing is that they have really good
processes to search the information
by, and quickly, but it still returns a lot
of stuff you don't want. So if you have
a two-part search where you put in a
category as well, if they designed it
right I think it would give you a lot
more usable results."
While some students agreed with
Steiert that a categorical search en
gine would be worth the shot, the ma
jority of those interviewed said they
would remain true to Google.
"There's no need to type in the
category because if you're a good
enough searcher you type in the key
words you need and get the results

you want," said Michael Bateman, a
sophomore. "I wouldn't switch from
Google."
Similarly, Internet users who are
comfortable with Google may not see
a need to switch.
"[Kosmix] won't be big because
everyone just uses Google," said
Daniel Zavala, a sophomore.
"Google has it covered. We don't
need a new search engine."
Not only does Google have it cov
ered, some students said that it goes
above and beyond their expectations
for a basic search engine.
Sophomore Arie Salih pointed to
the site's other features such as
Google maps and Google news.
While Kosmix could theoretically
enhance the depth of a given search, it
may never have the chance to prove it
self if it can't escape Google's shadow.
