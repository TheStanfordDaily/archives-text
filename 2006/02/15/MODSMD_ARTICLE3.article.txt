# WHEN A TREE FALLS...
## MASCOT MAYHEM Tree Supsended, Alcohol Cited Attitude, punctuality, attendance also given as rationale 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR OF SPORTS 
Erin Lashnits, a coterminal student in biological
sciences, has been suspended for the remainder of her
tenure as the Stanford Tree.
Band Manager Mike Priest and Assistant Manager
Adam Cohen announced their decision to Lashnits on
Thursday night, just hours after UC-Berkeley Athlet
ic Department officials Breathalyzed her at a .157
blood-alcohol content at halftime of the men's basket
ball team's 65-62 loss at Berkeley, according to
sources, including several in the band.
"I'm sad to be done," said Lashnits, who at 23-
years-old, is accused of violating not the law, but the
Band's alcohol probation. "It's been the best year of
my life, pretty much on a daily basis."
Lashnits claimed the trouble started not over alco
hol, but over miscommunication about where on Cal's
court she would be permitted to dance.

Security surrounds coterminal student, former varsity diver and Stanford Tree Erin Lashnits following halftime of the men's
basketball team's Thursday night 65-62 loss to UC-Berkeley. Lashnits said her tenure was the "best year of her life."
"I spoke with the various Cal reps,
and usually there's places that you can
and can't go on the court — where I
am, where Oski is, where the Cal stu
dent section is — they want to keep
these things very separate," Lashnits
said. "(A Cal Athletic Department
employee] told me I couldn't cross the
free-throw line — I thought he meant
the other side's free-throw line, not
that I was only allowed to be standing
under the basket. So 1 was out at cen
ter-court, where 1 wasn't allowed to
be, having no idea,"
Whatever the cause, Berkeley of
ficials escorted the former Stanford
varsity diver off the Haas Pavilion
court and barred her from returning.
From there, the decision to suspend
her for the rest of her tenure was all
but inevitable, according to Cohen.
"The decision was unanimous be
tween myself and the Manager Mike
Priest," said Cohen, a junior. "She
knew that she had been removed
from a game. It's not like she argued.
She understood."
Cohen and Band Public Relations
Director Sam Urmy, a sophomore,
stressed that Lashnits' troubles at Cal
were merely the last of a laundry list
of problems, many of them involving
alcohol. Urmy said Lashnits was sus
pended for several weeks following
an alcohol-related incident during
Band Run at the start of the year, and
was unable to perform at home foot
ball games as a result.
"The alcohol-related stuff is the
main issue," Urmy said. "The fact is
she hasn't taken warnings about alco
hol to heart as seriously as the rest of
the Band, and that's taken very seri
ously by the Athletic Department
and the administration."
Along with other Band members,
Urmy added that punctuality and at
tendance were also issues, noting that
Lashnits regularly showed up to

This really isn't indicative of
the band's current situation
or the the Tree's current situation.

ERIN LASHNITS, former Tree

games after tip-off —if at all. All
told, Urmy said she chafed many with
her "attitude to her position."
"It was the last in a line of small
stupid things she's done," Urmy said.
"We decided to take care of it before
worse happened or the Athletic De
partment had to step in and do some
thing. We don't want to risk ending
Band over something stupid."
The risk that the University would
act against the Band was real, mem
bers said. They pointed out that, this
year in particular, the Band has been
subject to the most scrutiny in recent
memory', all while steering clear of
major alcohol policy violations.
Accordingly, Band management and
Lashnits alike were quick to distance
her behavior from that of the Band in
general.
"This really isn't indicative of the
Band's current situation or the Tree's
current situation," Lashnits said.
Given the University's increasing
ly watchful eye, Lashnits said she un
derstands the decision to effectively
terminate her run as Tree.
"Because the Band is a student
run organization and wants to remain
such, they want to make sure they're
the ones taking things into their own
hands and making sure they're being
the responsible party, instead of hav
ing to force administration to take on

that role," Lashnits said. "They do
that in all cases whether it's some ran
dom trumpet player, a Dollie or the
Tree."
Lashnits' term was due to end
when a new Tree is crowned on
March 4, but now the Band will be
mascotless for the next three weeks.
In years past, the new and old
Trees usually split up to cover both
the men's and women's basketball
postseasons.This year, while Lashnits
believes the new Tree will have to de
cide which tournament to attend, she
stresses that the "institution of the
Tree" has not been diminished.
"The Tree's going to be just as
awesome as it ever was," Lashnits
said. "Nothing fundamental's going
to change. The Tree will be the Tree
forever and ever."
And though Lashnits said she'll
miss what she called "the closest
she'll ever become to being a rock
star," she added that her time had
come.
"I'm so fucking burnt out," Lash
nits said. "I have shin splints that are
killing me and my costume got torn
up and destroyed against Washington
when Sixth Man stormed the court.
The only things I'm missing are two
home basketball games which really
aren't that big of a deal to me. I'm not
that big of a sports fan."
