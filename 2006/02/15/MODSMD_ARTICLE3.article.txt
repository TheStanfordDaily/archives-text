Erin Lashnits, a coterminal student in biological
sciences, has been suspended for the remainder of her
tenure as the Stanford Tree.
Band Manager Mike Priest and Assistant Manager
Adam Cohen announced their decision to Lashnits on
Thursday night, just hours after UC-Berkeley Athlet
ic Department officials Breathalyzed her at a .157
blood-alcohol content at halftime of the men's basket
ball team's 65-62 loss at Berkeley, according to
sources, including several in the band.
"I'm sad to be done," said Lashnits, who at 23-
years-old, is accused of violating not the law, but the
Band's alcohol probation. "It's been the best year of
my life, pretty much on a daily basis."
Lashnits claimed the trouble started not over alco
hol, but over miscommunication about where on Cal's
court she would be permitted to dance.
