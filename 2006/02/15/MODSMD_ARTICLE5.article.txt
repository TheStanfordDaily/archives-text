# Students say 'I DO' in Plaza
## "Mainly, [the event] brings a visual recognition of gay marriage to people's consciousness." KATY YAN, president Queer/Straight Alliance 
### SHIRIN SHARIF SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Six same-sex couples took their vows in
White Plaza yesterday as part of Stanford's
Freedom to Marry Day, which aimed to raise
awareness "about the current state of marriage
inequality and to encourage action to change
the status quo," according to senior Michael
Nunez, liaison for the Queer/Straight Alliance
(QSA), which sponsored the event.
The symbolic "I Dos" were administered by
Rabbi Mychal Copeland and Rev. David Jack
son from the Office of Religious Life, who also
made short speeches as part of the event. QSA
wanted to bring a multi-faith perspective to the
issue to demonstrate that religion and gay mar
riage are not mutually exclusive, said junior
Katy Yan. the group's president.
The ceremonies were very informal and
often impromptu, with group leaders asking
students standing nearby if they wanted to get
married. Rings were optional, but QSA mem
bers provided wedding cake, along with non
hetero-normative valentines, ribbons, stickers,
door signs and informative flyers and

brochures.
"Mainly, [the event] brings a visual recogni
tion of gay marriage to people's consciousness,"
Yan said. "Hopefully, it will raise awareness that
gay marriage is an issue of human rights and
that a ban on gay marriage means the continual
discrimination of mainstream society against
the queer community. If people could learn to
empathize with their fellow human beings, it
might promote a more embracing and support
ive community at large."
National Freedom to Marry Day was ob
served on Feb. 12. but QSA decided to observe
the event on Valentine's Day at Stanford be
cause members said that the holiday — as tra
ditionally celebrated — ignores the needs and
existence of the queer community.This is QS A's
second year sponsoring the event at Stanford.
While there was no organized opposition to
the White Plaza ceremonies, the fliers that QSA
members had taped on the ground in a heart
shape on Sunday night had disappeared by
Monday. Yan said she suspected that someone
tore them up.
