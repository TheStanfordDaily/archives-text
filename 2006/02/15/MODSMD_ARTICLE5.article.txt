# Students say 'I DO' in Plaza
## "Mainly, [the event] brings a visual recognition of gay marriage to people's consciousness." KATY YAN, president Queer/Straight Alliance 
### SHIRIN SHARIF SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Six same-sex couples took their vows in
White Plaza yesterday as part of Stanford's
Freedom to Marry Day, which aimed to raise
awareness "about the current state of marriage
inequality and to encourage action to change
the status quo," according to senior Michael
Nunez, liaison for the Queer/Straight Alliance
(QSA), which sponsored the event.
The symbolic "I Dos" were administered by
Rabbi Mychal Copeland and Rev. David Jack
son from the Office of Religious Life, who also
made short speeches as part of the event. QSA
wanted to bring a multi-faith perspective to the
issue to demonstrate that religion and gay mar
riage are not mutually exclusive, said junior
Katy Yan. the group's president.
The ceremonies were very informal and
often impromptu, with group leaders asking
students standing nearby if they wanted to get
married. Rings were optional, but QSA mem
bers provided wedding cake, along with non
hetero-normative valentines, ribbons, stickers,
door signs and informative flyers and

brochures.
"Mainly, [the event] brings a visual recogni
tion of gay marriage to people's consciousness,"
Yan said. "Hopefully, it will raise awareness that
gay marriage is an issue of human rights and
that a ban on gay marriage means the continual
discrimination of mainstream society against
the queer community. If people could learn to
empathize with their fellow human beings, it
might promote a more embracing and support
ive community at large."
National Freedom to Marry Day was ob
served on Feb. 12. but QSA decided to observe
the event on Valentine's Day at Stanford be
cause members said that the holiday — as tra
ditionally celebrated — ignores the needs and
existence of the queer community.This is QS A's
second year sponsoring the event at Stanford.
While there was no organized opposition to
the White Plaza ceremonies, the fliers that QSA
members had taped on the ground in a heart
shape on Sunday night had disappeared by
Monday. Yan said she suspected that someone
tore them up.
The event was supported by
many student bystanders, including
David Ball, a third-year law student.
"As a married person, my mar
riage isn't threatened by anyone
else's marriage — gay or straight,"
Ball said. "If people want to commit,
more power to them."
Though crowds at the event were
mostly sparse, QSA members also
conducted outreach in freshman
dorms and worked with peer health
educators to spread special valen
tines.
"For many LGBT students, the
event serves as a basic but positive
affirmation of their fundamental
identity on a day when LGBT peo
ple and same-sex relationships are
often marginalized," Nunez said. "It
also provides QSA with an impor
tant opportunity to expand our
membership so that our future
events are even bigger and more
useful."
Jackson, who participated in the
event for the first time, said that he
has faced some opposition to his
views on gay marriage.
"I've been involved in equality is
sues for many years and I view this
issue as a civil rights one, in addition
to an equality one," Jackson said.
"Some conservative Christian
groups bring up the Bible, but the
Bible is about God's inclusive love
for everybody. Today, we're cele
brating committed love between
two people — whether the couple is
homosexual or heterosexual doesn't
matter."
Last year. California's state legis
lature became the first to pass a bill
legalizing same-sex marriage, and a
similar bill could pass through the
state assembly and senate during the
2007 legislative term.
QSA's next event in support of
gay marriage will be a letter-writing
campaign to key state-elected offi
cials. Visit http://qsa.stanford.edu
