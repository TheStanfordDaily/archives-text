# SPECIAL EVENT
## Speaker talks foreign policy Harvard Prof stresses the importance of "soft power" 
### JAMES HOHMANN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"We are in a world where you have to think
three-dimensionally, and we have been think
ing very much one-dimensionally," said Har
vard International Relations Prof. Joseph Nye
at a lecture sponsored by the Freeman Spogli
Institute for International Studies at the Bech-

Tel Conference Center last night.
Using metaphor to describe the nature of
power in international relations today, Nye
said that if international politics was a game it
would be a three-dimensional chess board. On
the first board would be traditional military
force. The middle board would represent eco
nomic power and the bottom level would be
where matches of transnational relations are
decided.
With a military that is second-to-none, the
United States would be the undis
puted leader on the first hoard,
Nye said. On the second board,
several other players such as the
European Union and China would
vie for control over the world
economy. On the lower level,
power would be chaotically dis
tributed among terrorists and
other underworld syndicates due
to the lack of control.
"The United States has been fo
cusing on a strategy to play one,
not all three.boards," Nye said."lf
you play in one dimension on a
three-dimension game, in the long
run. you are going to lose. The
United States has not developed a
strategy to deal with the new kind
of threat."
ITie professor, who has taught
at Harvard since 1%4. is credited
with coining the term "soft power"
to describe the non-violent use of
state power. His lecture addressed
the importance of using this soft
power to win hearts and minds in
tandem with hard power — the
use of military force — to defeat
terrorism.
"We suddenly realized on Sept.
11 that there was a new set of
threats and problems that were
more complex than we had
thought before," he said.
"1 think soft power will be in
creasingly important," Nye told
The Daily in a brief interview after
his speech. "You won't win the
struggle against terrorism without
winning the hearts and minds. You
need both soft and hard power. We
have not had enough soft power in
our mixture. Hard power is neces
sary but not sufficient."
Nye said that globalization and
the increasing availability of de
veloped technology helped the
terrorists succeed on Sept. 11.
"When al-Oaeda attacked the
U.S. on Sept. 11. it killed more
Americans than the government

of Japan did when it attacked us on
Dec. 7,1941." he said. "If you look
at the last four and a half years
since Sept. 11, it is clear that we
have changed the focus of our for
eign policy."
Nye said that the use of hard
power is important to defeat ter
rorist groups like al-Oaeda and the
Taliban militarily. He added that
the government spends more than
$400 billion on defense but only $1
billion on public diplomacy.
Soft power involves the use of
"carrots and sticks," a popular
term used by political scientists to
describe incentives and the use of
force. Nye, an administration offi
cial for Presidents Jimmy Carter
and Bill Clinton, attributed for
eigners' negative perceptions of
the United States to the federal
government's failure to connect
with civilians in the Middle East,
and he stressed the importance of
reaching out to moderate Islamic
factions. He pointed to the mili
tary's successful tsunami recovery
efforts last year as the kind of soft
power that builds good will.
He took questions from an au
dience of approximately 50 people
after remarks that lasted just
under an hour.
Only a few students attended
the event. Those who came said
they were impressed by Nye's ex
planation of soft power.
"1 think he presented a very
well-articulated argument about
what many Americans are think
ing about but don't know how to
say," said Jessica Schaffer. a sopho
more majoring in international re
lations. "I'm wondering why peo
ple like him are not a more vocal
part of the government."
Jumichi Saito, a visiting Japan
ese student interning at the Haas
Center for Public Service, said he
thought there should be more of a
focus on soft power in academic
discussions.
"The soft power issues were
very interesting to hear," he said.
"Other scholars focus so much on
military bases and hard power."
