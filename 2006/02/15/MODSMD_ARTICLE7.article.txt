## ASSU tackles Flicks change, Founder's Day Senators will take on Judicial Charter alterations next week 
### SILVIA SANCHEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate met last
night to vote on proposed changes to the ASSU
Judicial Charter as well as to discuss the future of
FLiCKS and the creation of a new athletics com
mittee.
ASSU Financial Manager Justin Fishner-
Wolfson, also the chief executive officer of Stan
ford Student Enterprises (SSE), told the Senate
that FLiCKS will no longer he a division of SSE;
instead, it will become part of an ASSU Service
Project.
Senator Danny Arbeiter, a sophomore, said
that the change will not affect students, at least
not for the remainder of this year.
"The newest service project really doesn't
change anything about the operations of
FLiCKS from the consumer point of view." he
said. "At least not until next year."
Sophomore Senator Kat Kershner, the stu
dent life, housing and education chair, an
nounced the formation of a new committee that
will be working in conjunction with the Athletics
Department. Similar to the Big Game com
mittee, this new body will focus on increasing
the fan base for Stanford athletics. In addition,
the new committee will examine the develop
ment of the new stadium.
Kershner also told the Senate that the
ASSU will not be putting on a Multicultural
Food Day this year due to a lack of manpow
er. She explained that the event would have
fallen on the heels of other events such as an
Art Affair and the Spring Block Party, which
will require a considerable amount of effort
from the student life, housing and education
committee.
Later in the meeting. Director of Student
Activities Nanci Howe spoke to the senators
about the annual Founder's Day celebration.
Howe said that Stanford usually puts on a
Community Day in conjunction with
Founder's Day, but that this year the ceremo
ny will be solely for the student body.
Howe said that there will be a competition
among students to write a short speech on
what Stanford means to them that will be read
on Founder's Day. The deadline for speeches
is March 3, and the winning student will re
ceive $ 1 .(KM).
The amendments to the ASSU Judicial
Charter proposed last night predominantly
consisted of typographical corrections, and
were passed unanimously. Larger, more com
plicated changes to the Charter have been
proposed as well but will not be voted on until
next week.
ASSU Senate Chair Chris Nguyen, a jun
ior, said that the changes passed last night
were minor in comparison with the proposed
changes on the table for next week.
"The Judicial Charter amendments we
passed today were relatively minor ones," he
said. "The ones next week will be the real fire
works. These include word replacement issues
and an actual major wording change."
