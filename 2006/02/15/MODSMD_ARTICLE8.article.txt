## Defiant Iran begins uranium enrichment 
### ALI AKBAR DAREINI ASSOCIATED PRESS 
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran has resumed small
scale enrichment of uranium, a senior Iranian nuclear
negotiator said TUesday — a defiant declaration in the
face of global opposition to Iran's atomic program.
The resumption still leaves Iran a long way from
reaching the stage the world fears most: large-scale en
richment of uranium — a process that can produce fuel
for an atomic bomb.
Javad Vaeidi, deputy secretary of Iran's Supreme Na
tional Security Council, in announcing the small-scale
enrichment, also told reporters that Iran would resume
negotiations with Moscow on Feb. 20 over its plan to en
rich Iranian uranium on Russian soil — a proposal de
signed to allay fears that Iran will build nuclear weapons.
"The talks with Russia remain valid," Vaeidi said,
adding that an Iranian delegation would go to Moscow.
The negotiations with Russia had been due to resume
Thursday, but Iran said Monday they were postponed in
definitely.
Vaeidi gave no indication whether Iran was looking
more favorably at the plan now that international pres
sure over its nuclear program was increasing. He said en
richment of uranium resumed last week at Natanz, the
country's main enrichment plant, but that Iran had not
resumed large-scale enrichment, as required for produc
ing fuel for nuclear reactors.
In Israel, Yuval Steinitz, chairman of the Knesset's de
fense and foreign affairs committee, said Tuesday's an
nouncement made it clear that "time is running out."
"If the Iranians will not be blocked, in due course they
will obtain a nuclear weapon." he told The Associated
Press. "This will be a devastating threat not only to Israel
and the Middle East but also to Europe and the United
States."
Later Tuesday, Vice President Gholamreza Aghaz
adeh said resumption of uranium enrichment work was
very limited.
"It can't be used even at semi-industrial level. It's only
at the laboratory stage for analyzing research activities.
This sort of enrichment cannot be used (for producing
nuclear fuel)," he said.

The world has long sought to stop Iran from enriching
uranium, fearing that the process would bring it to the
threshold of possessing nuclear bombs. On Feb. 4, the In
ternational Atomic Energy Agency reported Iran to the
U.N. Security Council and called on its government to
suspend all enrichment-related activities.
Instead, Iran suspended certain aspects of its co-oper
ation with the lAEA.
"They're continuing to choose defiance and confronta
tion over cooperation and diplomacy," White House
press secretary Scott McClellan said Monday of Iran's
decision to resume enrichment.
Iran insists that as a signatory to the Nuclear Nonpro
liferation Treaty, which provides for peaceful nuclear de
velopment, it is entitled to enrich uranium for nuclear re
actors. It has threatened to withdraw from the treaty if it
was not allowed to exercise that right.
Vaeidi nonetheless indicated Iran was still open to nego
tiation.
"We are still prepared to find a formula to clarify the
ambiguity in talks with our partners. At the same time, we

will pursue our rights," he said.
Mohammad Saeedi, deputy head of the Atomic Ener
gy Organization of Iran, said TUesday that Iran has
stopped allowing short notice inspections of its facilities
by lAEA inspectors.
He said on state television that some lAEA cameras
need to be removed from Iranian nuclear facilities and that
Iran was "taking the preparatory measures to do that."
I ran maintains its nuclear program is designed solely to
generate electricity, but the United States and Israel claim
the program is a cover for producing an atomic bomb.
Abdullah Gul, the foreign minister of Turkey, which
borders Iran, urged its neighbor to be transparent about
its nuclear program.
"Nuclear energy is the right of everyone, including
Iran. But it requires the responsibility of being transpar
ent," Gul said.
And the European Union, whose presidency is now
held by Austria, reiterated that Tehran's nuclear ambi
tions and shaky human rights record were making nor
mal relations with the EU impossible.
