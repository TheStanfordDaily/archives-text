# Katrina inquiry blames passivity
## Widespread government indifference did the most damage, report says 
### LARA JAKES JORDAN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Government at all levels
took an indifferent stance toward disaster preparations
after the 2001 terror attacks, leaving the Gulf Coast vul
nerable to Hurricane Katrina and contributing to the
death and suffering the storm inflicted, a House inquiry
concludes.
Finding fault with the White House down to local of
ficials, the 520-page report, titled "A Failure of Initia
tive," determined that authorities failed to move quick
ly to protect people — even when faced with warnings
days before the catastrophic storm struck last Aug. 29.
"Passivity did the most damage," concluded the re
port, which was written by a Republican-dominated
special House committee and obtained TUesday night
by The Associated Press. "The failure of initiative cost
lives, prolonged suffering, and left all Americans justi
fiably concerned our government is no better pre
pared to protect its people than it was before 9/11,
even if we are."
The hard-hitting report concludes that President
Bush could have speeded the response by becoming in
volved in the crisis earlier. It says he was not receiving
guidance from a disaster specialist, who would have un
derstood the scope of the storm's destruction.
"Earlier presidential involvement might have result
ed in a more effective response," the inquiry concluded.
White House spokesman Allen Abney declined to
comment. On Monday. White House Homeland Securi
ty adviser Frances Fragos Townsend said Bush was
"fully involved" in Washington's preparations and re
sponse to Katrina.
The inquiry into one of the nation's worst natural dis
asters looked at everything from the evacuation to the
military's role to planning for emergency supplies and
in each category found much to criticize.
"The single biggest failure of the federal response was
that it failed to recognize the likely consequences of the
approaching storm and mobilize federal assets for a
post-storm evacuation of the flooded city," the report
said. "If it had, then federal assistance would have ar
rived several davs earlier."
