## Econ, Psych revise major requirements Changes will only impact students who have not yet declared 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
Undergraduates planning to major in either econom
ics or psychology may soon have to rework their four
year plans, as the Stanford Department of Economics
and the Stanford Department of Psychology are making
changes to their major requirements, potentially affecting
current undeclared students and future undergraduates.
Economics Professor Study Mordecai Kurz outlined
the changes to the economics major, which are to take ef
fect this coming September.
Introduction to Economics, currently a one-quarter
class, will become a two-quarter sequence, he said. The
two classes will be called Econ 1A and Econ 1B — micro
economics and macroeconomics — respectively. The se
quence will be a prerequisite for Econ 50.
Accordingly, the major will require 80 units instead of
75, and the minor will require 40 units instead of 35.
The second change to the economics course offerings
will be the elimination of Econ 50M, the mathematics
based course offered by the department. Instead, Math 51
will be required.
Additionally, the five-unit credit for high scores on the
Economics Advanced Placement test will no longer be
granted: students will need to petition to go straight to
Econ 50.
"A good AP test score will not be sufficient," Kurz
said. "Students will have to demonstrate their practical
skills, knowledge and ability to reason."
All students who have already declared their major by
the end of this academic year will be permitted to gradu
ate under the old rules. Kurz encouraged students to visit
the Economics Department Web Site to learn more
about the modifications.
Concerning the transition period, Kurz said the de
partment "will try to create as little hardship as we can.
We will be very flexible in terms of transition."
The Psychology Department is well into a period of
transition regarding the requirement changes that were
implemented during fall quarter of this year.
Psychology majors must now com
plete 70 units of coursework instead of
55.
Sixty of the 70 units must be taken
in the Psychology Department, in
cluding five core courses.The remain
ing 10 units must be taken outside the
department and follow a coherent
theme to supplement the major.
Kristy Forster. student services
specialist in the department, said that
with these changes, "students will be
provided with a more thematic pro
gram and interdisciplinary approach
to the field of psychology, better
preparing them for graduate school
and careers in psychology and related
fields."
"These changes bring the require
ments for the psychology major into

line with comparable majors such as
human biology, biological sciences
and symbolic systems," she said,
adding that the changes "are de
signed to ensure that our students
are well trained in psychology and
also have an appreciation of materi
al covered in other departments that
is relevant to the student's particular
interests."
According to Forster, this new
model for the psychology major was
created by the faculty with input from
the Undergraduate Education Com
mittee, which includes undergraduate
student representatives.
"Students have been pleasantly
surprised to find out how easy it is to
incorporate courses they've taken
outside of psychology into a coherent
and supportive set of courses for the
major," she said.
However, students, when inter
viewed, expressed mixed views.
Freshman Carlos Fernandez, who
hopes to double major in human biol

ogy and psychology while completing
pre-medical requirements, expressed
concern.
"It would have been easier for me
to do a psychology major and fulfill
my pre-med requirements with the
lower unit requirement because I
could take both tracks simultaneous
ly." Fernandez said. "The changes sort
of discourage me from psychology as
a major because there are more units
that I have to find a way to fit in there."
Sophomore Gavin Jenkins, a
prospective psychology major, said
that the changes make his schedule "a
little more crammed."
"It's okay," he said."lt's just kind of
annoying."
Psychology major Alanna Hay, a
sophomore, said that the changes to
the major requirements influenced
her decision to declare her major at
the end of freshman year.
"It's not that I won't take those
[additional] classes," Hay said. "But at
three units apiece... it's too difficult,

because [the department] offers a lot
of classes once a year or once every
other year."
Similarly, freshman Julia Green
berg, also a prospective economics
major, said next year's switch to the
two-quarter Econ 1 sequence was one
of the factors motivating her to take
Econ 1 next quarter in its current
form.
Sophomore Yianu Burduja, who
plans to minor in economics, spoke
positively about the change to the in
troductory class.
"Taking Econ 1 in just one quarter
— it is a pretty intense class," he said.
"It's a lot of material."
As for the elimination of Econ
50M, however, Burduja said, "I'm ac
tually not favoring that, because I was
planning to take that class. You don't
really need for econ everything
they're talking about in Math 51." He
added that a three-unit class combin
ing economics and mathematics
"would be ideal."
