## Econ, Psych revise major requirements Changes will only impact students who have not yet declared 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
Undergraduates planning to major in either econom
ics or psychology may soon have to rework their four
year plans, as the Stanford Department of Economics
and the Stanford Department of Psychology are making
changes to their major requirements, potentially affecting
current undeclared students and future undergraduates.
Economics Professor Study Mordecai Kurz outlined
the changes to the economics major, which are to take ef
fect this coming September.
Introduction to Economics, currently a one-quarter
class, will become a two-quarter sequence, he said. The
two classes will be called Econ 1A and Econ 1B — micro
economics and macroeconomics — respectively. The se
quence will be a prerequisite for Econ 50.
Accordingly, the major will require 80 units instead of
75, and the minor will require 40 units instead of 35.
The second change to the economics course offerings
will be the elimination of Econ 50M, the mathematics
based course offered by the department. Instead, Math 51
will be required.
Additionally, the five-unit credit for high scores on the
Economics Advanced Placement test will no longer be
granted: students will need to petition to go straight to
Econ 50.
"A good AP test score will not be sufficient," Kurz
said. "Students will have to demonstrate their practical
skills, knowledge and ability to reason."
All students who have already declared their major by
the end of this academic year will be permitted to gradu
ate under the old rules. Kurz encouraged students to visit
the Economics Department Web Site to learn more
about the modifications.
Concerning the transition period, Kurz said the de
partment "will try to create as little hardship as we can.
We will be very flexible in terms of transition."
The Psychology Department is well into a period of
transition regarding the requirement changes that were
implemented during fall quarter of this year.
