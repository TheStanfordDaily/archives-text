## Grad Files National Suit Doctoral student Rahinah Ibrahim detained at SFO, mistakenly put on federal terrorist "no-fly" list 
### MIMA MOHAMMED JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITERS 
Rahinah Ibrahim, a Stanford doctoral can
didate, was at San Francisco International Air
port last year ready to fly home to Malaysia
for a conference. Amid the hustle of baggage
check and security, officials informed her that
she was on the government's terrorist no-fly
list. Handcuffed, she was escorted through the
airport to a waiting police car.
Officials later informed Ibrahim that she
had been removed from the no-fly list, and
that her name had been mistakenly added.
But when she attempted to fly again the fol
lowing day, officials approached her a second
time, claiming that her name was still on the
list. Ibrahim was prevented from flying until
an FBI agent cleared her name, and subjected
her to "enhanced searches."
When Ibrahim finally arrived in Malaysia,
she encountered more difficulties. Told that
the U.S. Embassy had pulled her visa, she has
not been allowed back into the United States
since. Last week her story was outlined in a
lawsuit against several government agencies
and individuals, including the Department of
Homeland Security, challenging the constitu
tionality of the no-fly list.
A handful of other plaintiffs have also op
posed the controversial list, which they claim
is capricious and ineffective. According to The
San Jose Mercury News, a federal judge in
Seattle threw out the bulk of a lawsuit in early
January after challenging the constitutionality
of the flight ban and dismissing it for proce
dural failures.
According to the American Civil Liberties
Union and The Mercury, on Jan. 25, the ACLU
settled a different suit filed on behalf of two
Bay Area peace activists. The government
paid $200,(XX) for the plaintiffs' legal fees, but
gave up little of the information about the no
fly list that they sought.
Lawyers maintain Ibrahim's innocence.
"Essentially, Ms. Ibrahim is an extremely
accomplished Malaysian Muslim woman; a

wife; a mother of four children; a Ph.D. from
Stanford, specializing in architecture; and cur
rently teaching at University Putra Malaysia
(UPM) in Malaysia," said Marwa Elzankaly.a
lawyer at the firm McManis, Faulkner & Mor
gan, and president of The Bay Area Associa
tion of Muslim Lawyers. "Ms. Ibrahim has no
criminal record and no links to terrorism
whatsoever. Nevertheless, she was stopped at
SFO and arrested, handcuffed and taken to
the San Francisco Police Department in front
of her 14-year-old daughter and every other
onlooker at the airport, for no reason except
that she was told she was on the no-fly list."
Elzankaly continued Ibrahim's account, al
leging mistreatment and misunderstanding on
the part of authorities.
"At the police station, she was searched
under her'hijab' — her head scarf — and ini
tially deprived of her pain medication, which
she was taking following a complicated hys
terectomy," she said. "After several hours, she
was finally released. When she tried to fly once
more the following day, she was again denied
entry on the flight until an FBI agent finally
cleared her to tly, subject, of course, to 'en
hanced searches' at every stop she made.
When she reached Malaysia. Ms. Ibrahim's
Visa was revoked by the U.S. Embassy with
out explanation."
Ibrahim has not been back to the United
States. She filed claims against San Mateo
County and San Francisco last year for viola
tions of her rights; both were rejected, leading
Ibrahim to file suit.
The no-fly list ostensibly includes people
who pose a threat or are suspected of posing a
threat to civil aviation. Individuals on the no
fly list are divided into two categories — no
fly, which means one is not allowed on a plane,
and'selectee,' which means one is subjected to
more intense searches, such as a physical pat
down, close metal-detection and a detailed in
spection of carry-on luggage.
