## Grad Files National Suit Doctoral student Rahinah Ibrahim detained at SFO, mistakenly put on federal terrorist "no-fly" list 
### MIMA MOHAMMED JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITERS 
Rahinah Ibrahim, a Stanford doctoral can
didate, was at San Francisco International Air
port last year ready to fly home to Malaysia
for a conference. Amid the hustle of baggage
check and security, officials informed her that
she was on the government's terrorist no-fly
list. Handcuffed, she was escorted through the
airport to a waiting police car.
Officials later informed Ibrahim that she
had been removed from the no-fly list, and
that her name had been mistakenly added.
But when she attempted to fly again the fol
lowing day, officials approached her a second
time, claiming that her name was still on the
list. Ibrahim was prevented from flying until
an FBI agent cleared her name, and subjected
her to "enhanced searches."
When Ibrahim finally arrived in Malaysia,
she encountered more difficulties. Told that
the U.S. Embassy had pulled her visa, she has
not been allowed back into the United States
since. Last week her story was outlined in a
lawsuit against several government agencies
and individuals, including the Department of
Homeland Security, challenging the constitu
tionality of the no-fly list.
A handful of other plaintiffs have also op
posed the controversial list, which they claim
is capricious and ineffective. According to The
San Jose Mercury News, a federal judge in
Seattle threw out the bulk of a lawsuit in early
January after challenging the constitutionality
of the flight ban and dismissing it for proce
dural failures.
According to the American Civil Liberties
Union and The Mercury, on Jan. 25, the ACLU
settled a different suit filed on behalf of two
Bay Area peace activists. The government
paid $200,(XX) for the plaintiffs' legal fees, but
gave up little of the information about the no
fly list that they sought.
Lawyers maintain Ibrahim's innocence.
"Essentially, Ms. Ibrahim is an extremely
accomplished Malaysian Muslim woman; a

wife; a mother of four children; a Ph.D. from
Stanford, specializing in architecture; and cur
rently teaching at University Putra Malaysia
(UPM) in Malaysia," said Marwa Elzankaly.a
lawyer at the firm McManis, Faulkner & Mor
gan, and president of The Bay Area Associa
tion of Muslim Lawyers. "Ms. Ibrahim has no
criminal record and no links to terrorism
whatsoever. Nevertheless, she was stopped at
SFO and arrested, handcuffed and taken to
the San Francisco Police Department in front
of her 14-year-old daughter and every other
onlooker at the airport, for no reason except
that she was told she was on the no-fly list."
Elzankaly continued Ibrahim's account, al
leging mistreatment and misunderstanding on
the part of authorities.
"At the police station, she was searched
under her'hijab' — her head scarf — and ini
tially deprived of her pain medication, which
she was taking following a complicated hys
terectomy," she said. "After several hours, she
was finally released. When she tried to fly once
more the following day, she was again denied
entry on the flight until an FBI agent finally
cleared her to tly, subject, of course, to 'en
hanced searches' at every stop she made.
When she reached Malaysia. Ms. Ibrahim's
Visa was revoked by the U.S. Embassy with
out explanation."
Ibrahim has not been back to the United
States. She filed claims against San Mateo
County and San Francisco last year for viola
tions of her rights; both were rejected, leading
Ibrahim to file suit.
The no-fly list ostensibly includes people
who pose a threat or are suspected of posing a
threat to civil aviation. Individuals on the no
fly list are divided into two categories — no
fly, which means one is not allowed on a plane,
and'selectee,' which means one is subjected to
more intense searches, such as a physical pat
down, close metal-detection and a detailed in
spection of carry-on luggage.
Ibrahim who had been in the United States
on a student visa preparing her dis
sertation on affordable housing, al
leges further abuse by authorities.
According to her lawsuit, she, her
daughter and a friend were at the
United Airlines counter where she
requested a wheelchair, complaining
she was still in pain due to complica
tions from a hysterectomy, but was
denied. The San Francisco police
were called while she stood in pain
for an hour and a half before she was
finally arrested as others in the termi
nal looked on. Ibrahim was then
transported to a police holding cell.
"My client's goal is to prevent
anyone else from having to suffer the
same degrading treatment she re
ceived at the hands of our govern
ment," Elzankaly said.
Some Stanford faculty members
said the no-fly list was an unfortunate
by necessary aspect of security meas
ures against terrorism, and that the
University's international students
can be adversely affected.
"I would say that terrorism has
had many harmful effects, and the ef
fect on our education programs for
foreign students is one of them," said
Hoover Senior Fellow Abraham So
faer. "The no-fly list is very necessary
and has proved to be one of the most
difficult things imaginable to pull to
gether so that it is both effective and
accurate. It is getting better, but still
has a long way to go."
No simple remedy exists to per

more accurate it gets, the more likely
it will be that it is built on informa

San Jose Mercury News, a federal judge in
Seattle threw out the bulk of a lawsuit in early
January after challenging the constitutionality
of the flight ban and dismissing it for proce
dural failures.
According to the American Civil Liberties
Union and The Mercury, on Jan. 25, the ACLU
settled a different suit filed on behalf of two
Bay Area peace activists. The government
paid $200,(XX) for the plaintiffs' legal fees, but
gave up little of the information about the no
fly list that they sought.
Lawyers maintain Ibrahim's innocence.
"Essentially, Ms. Ibrahim is an extremely
accomplished Malaysian Muslim woman; a

wife; a mother of four children; a Ph.D. from
Stanford, specializing in architecture; and cur
rently teaching at University Putra Malaysia
(UPM) in Malaysia," said Marwa Elzankaly.a
lawyer at the firm McManis, Faulkner & Mor
gan, and president of The Bay Area Associa
tion of Muslim Lawyers. "Ms. Ibrahim has no
criminal record and no links to terrorism
whatsoever. Nevertheless, she was stopped at
SFO and arrested, handcuffed and taken to
the San Francisco Police Department in front
of her 14-year-old daughter and every other
onlooker at the airport, for no reason except
that she was told she was on the no-fly list."
Elzankaly continued Ibrahim's account, al
leging mistreatment and misunderstanding on
the part of authorities.
"At the police station, she was searched
under her'hijab' — her head scarf — and ini
tially deprived of her pain medication, which
she was taking following a complicated hys
terectomy," she said. "After several hours, she
was finally released. When she tried to fly once
more the following day, she was again denied
entry on the flight until an FBI agent finally
cleared her to tly, subject, of course, to 'en
hanced searches' at every stop she made.
When she reached Malaysia. Ms. Ibrahim's
Visa was revoked by the U.S. Embassy with
out explanation."
Ibrahim has not been back to the United
States. She filed claims against San Mateo
County and San Francisco last year for viola
tions of her rights; both were rejected, leading
Ibrahim to file suit.
The no-fly list ostensibly includes people
who pose a threat or are suspected of posing a
threat to civil aviation. Individuals on the no
fly list are divided into two categories — no
fly, which means one is not allowed on a plane,
and'selectee,' which means one is subjected to
more intense searches, such as a physical pat
down, close metal-detection and a detailed in
spection of carry-on luggage.
Ibrahim who had been in the United States
on a student visa preparing her dis
sertation on affordable housing, al
leges further abuse by authorities.
According to her lawsuit, she, her
daughter and a friend were at the
United Airlines counter where she
requested a wheelchair, complaining
she was still in pain due to complica
tions from a hysterectomy, but was
denied. The San Francisco police
were called while she stood in pain
for an hour and a half before she was
finally arrested as others in the termi
nal looked on. Ibrahim was then
transported to a police holding cell.
"My client's goal is to prevent
anyone else from having to suffer the
same degrading treatment she re
ceived at the hands of our govern
ment," Elzankaly said.
Some Stanford faculty members
said the no-fly list was an unfortunate
by necessary aspect of security meas
ures against terrorism, and that the
University's international students
can be adversely affected.
"I would say that terrorism has
had many harmful effects, and the ef
fect on our education programs for
foreign students is one of them," said
Hoover Senior Fellow Abraham So
faer. "The no-fly list is very necessary
and has proved to be one of the most
difficult things imaginable to pull to
gether so that it is both effective and
accurate. It is getting better, but still
has a long way to go."

feet the no-fly list, Sofaer continued.
"Keep in mind, though, that the
more accurate it gets, the more likely
it will be that it is built on informa
tion that has had to be collected
about those on the list, as well as in
formation about those not on the
list." he said. "I have struggled to
come up with ideas to improve the
situation, and I would make one sug
gestion: when someone innocent has
been adversely affected by our secu
rity requirements, we should all go
out of our way to explain why and to
rectify to the extent possible the
harm done, including monetary assis
tance and special opportunities to
make up lost classes, etc."
Rahinah Ibrahim, a Stanford doctoral can
didate, was at San Francisco International Air
port last year ready to fly home to Malaysia
for a conference. Amid the hustle of baggage
check and security, officials informed her that
she was on the government's terrorist no-fly
list. Handcuffed, she was escorted through the
airport to a waiting police car.
Officials later informed Ibrahim that she
had been removed from the no-fly list, and
that her name had been mistakenly added.
But when she attempted to fly again the fol
lowing day, officials approached her a second
time, claiming that her name was still on the
list. Ibrahim was prevented from flying until
an FBI agent cleared her name, and subjected
her to "enhanced searches."
When Ibrahim finally arrived in Malaysia,
she encountered more difficulties. Told that
the U.S. Embassy had pulled her visa, she has
not been allowed back into the United States
since. Last week her story was outlined in a
lawsuit against several government agencies
and individuals, including the Department of
Homeland Security, challenging the constitu
tionality of the no-fly list.
A handful of other plaintiffs have also op
posed the controversial list, which they claim
is capricious and ineffective. According to The
San Jose Mercury News, a federal judge in
Seattle threw out the bulk of a lawsuit in early
January after challenging the constitutionality
of the flight ban and dismissing it for proce
dural failures.

Union and The Mercury, on Jan. 25, the ACLU
