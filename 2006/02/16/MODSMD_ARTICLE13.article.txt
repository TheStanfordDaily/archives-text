## Israeli-Arab reporter looks at Hamas election Award-winning journalist says media, international community should not be surprised by win 
### AMNA AZIZ 
Award-winning Israeli-Arab journalist
Khaled Abu Toameh joined Stanford students
and faculty last night to discuss the state of Pales
tinian politics. Toameh, senior editor of Palestin
ian affairs for the Jerusalem Post, NBC News and
US News and World Report is a regular speaker
before audiences, often government officials and
universities. His talk was sponsored by Hasbara
Fellowships, StandWithUs and Stanford Israel
Alliance.
"The majority of Palestinians voted for Hamas
because they desire peace, not because they want
to destroy Israel," Toameh said. "Hamas won the
election mostly because it was a vote of protest
against corruption."
Addressing a predominantly pro-Israel audi
ence, Toameh's lecture focused on the recent
Palestinian elections and the conditions in the re
gion. He also addressed the issue of journalistic
integrity in the Arab world, referring to his per
sonal experiences and dissatisfaction with the
Palestine Liberation Organization's (PLO) cen
sorship and closure of media organizations in
1994.
"As a journalist I have no problem writing for
any news media that provides me with a free plat
form," he said. "But I think that it's sad that peo
ple like me have no role in our own [Arab]
media."
Toameh said he was surprised by the disbelief
expressed by the foreign media and the interna
tional community after Hamas' victory.
"The writing was on the wall," he said. "You
did not have to be an expert to know that Hamas
would win the election. The writing has been on
the wall for many years."
Toameh affirmed that the Palestinian vote for
Hamas was based primarily on ethical rather than
political issues, explaining that the ordinary
Palestinian simply wants to move around safely
