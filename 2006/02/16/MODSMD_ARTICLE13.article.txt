## Israeli-Arab reporter looks at Hamas election Award-winning journalist says media, international community should not be surprised by win 
### AMNA AZIZ 
Award-winning Israeli-Arab journalist
Khaled Abu Toameh joined Stanford students
and faculty last night to discuss the state of Pales
tinian politics. Toameh, senior editor of Palestin
ian affairs for the Jerusalem Post, NBC News and
US News and World Report is a regular speaker
before audiences, often government officials and
universities. His talk was sponsored by Hasbara
Fellowships, StandWithUs and Stanford Israel
Alliance.
"The majority of Palestinians voted for Hamas
because they desire peace, not because they want
to destroy Israel," Toameh said. "Hamas won the
election mostly because it was a vote of protest
against corruption."
Addressing a predominantly pro-Israel audi
ence, Toameh's lecture focused on the recent
Palestinian elections and the conditions in the re
gion. He also addressed the issue of journalistic
integrity in the Arab world, referring to his per
sonal experiences and dissatisfaction with the
Palestine Liberation Organization's (PLO) cen
sorship and closure of media organizations in
1994.
"As a journalist I have no problem writing for
any news media that provides me with a free plat
form," he said. "But I think that it's sad that peo
ple like me have no role in our own [Arab]
media."
Toameh said he was surprised by the disbelief
expressed by the foreign media and the interna
tional community after Hamas' victory.
"The writing was on the wall," he said. "You
did not have to be an expert to know that Hamas
would win the election. The writing has been on
the wall for many years."
Toameh affirmed that the Palestinian vote for
Hamas was based primarily on ethical rather than
political issues, explaining that the ordinary
Palestinian simply wants to move around safely
and freely. He also acknowledged
that while it is known as a terrorist
organization, Hamas runs a vast
network of necessary socio-eco
nomic organizations that the
Palestinian Authority should have
been operating.
Despite Palestinian optimism in
the wake of the January election,
Toameh said he does not believe
that Hamas will be able to rule
since they have nothing to offer the
peace process. Although he feels
that the group will develop more
moderate tactics, he does not be
lieve that they can change their ide
ology. Even so, he does acknowl
edge that the election is a step in
the right democratic direction.
"TTie most prominent positive

aspect of the election is that Pales
tinians finally said no to corrup
tion," he said. "Hamas won on a
platform of change and reform."
Students expressed mixed reac
tions to Toameh's talk, reflecting
the controversy in the Israeli-
Palestine conflict.
"I think that he offered some in
teresting perspectives," said junior
Ahmed Ashraf. "He certainly chal
lenged some of the audience's no
tions. However, he avoided contro
versial issues like the nature of the
Gaza disengagement".
"His unique perspective is one
of the reasons why we brought him
in," said junior Lyuba Wolf, Stan
ford Israel Alliance president, who
helped organize the event."I do
wish that more students had come
though. I think that it was an op
portunity lost, when else do you
have the chance to hear the per
spective of an Israeli-Arab jour
nalist?"
