# The 						Connection
## Some say 'I do' others say 'I can't' 
### 
Valentine's Day, despite my being per
petually single, lias never sent me into
a reflective spiral of doubt and de
pression. Particularly this year, I was too dis
tracted by reminders that someday my "True
Valentine" and I won't be able to fulfill the
ultimate act of coupledom — marriage.
As I approached White Plaza on V-Day
at lunchtinie, 1 was greeted by a circus of stu
dents gathered around a makeshift marriage
altar: the Queer/Straight Alliance's Free
dom to Marry Day observation. The annual
protest's aim is to call attention to the cur
rent state of marriage inequality between
straight and gay people. To accomplish this,
"couples" came forward to be married in
front of White I'laza and many passersby by
members of the Office of Religious Life.
I hough I know the participants and organ
izers meant well, I believe their efforts were
misguided and possibly counterproductive.
If the purpose of Freedom to Marry Day
was to build awareness and emphasize the
significance of this inequality, it would seem
that allowing anyone to come up on stage to
"be married" works against this cause.
Straight roommates, a gay guy and his fe
male friend or two gay guys who, while
friends, are not in a any sort of relationship,
are not people who are seriously seeking
marriage; in some instances, they aren't
even currently denied it.
As a gay man, watching the participants
giggle through the ceremonial procedures
while the crowd whooped on the sidelines
seemed to mock the importance of mar
riage, rather than emphasize it. Particularly
infuriating was watching two straight girls
giggle up to the dais to be "married." Nei
ther of these girls is currently denied the
right to marry,sohow does their symbolical
ly marrying each other do anything to high
light the discrimination suffered by gays
and lesbians actually denied the privilege to
tie the knot? II anything, this act seemed to
mock that inequality.
As I stood witnessing the event unfold,
several passersby inquired as to what was
going on. After I had explained the basic
premise, more than one beat me to my con
clusion— that it appeared ineffective to
convey the gravity of gays being denied ac
cess to marriage.
I appreciate the QS As ef forts to draw at
tention to the current inequality in marriage
laws. But I strongly believe that this protest,
in its current manifestation, actually under
mines the movement.
If the goal is to bring light to the plight of
gays and lesbians in committed relationships
who are denied the right to marry, why not
have committed gays and lesbians in such re
lationships exchange marriage vows or some
equivalent? Iliis would clearly demonstrate
the cruelty of denying people in healthy rela
tionships the ability to sanctify their union.
I lie gay marriage debate is complicated,
controversial and charged. Next to abor
tion. it's probably the most contentious po
litical issue our society faces. Particularly
given the severity of the issue at hand, I
hope future Freedom to Marry events con
sider the message this particular form of
protest conveys.
Someday I do hope to be married. If I am
ever lucky enough to have that privilege (and
112 ind the one I want to marry), I certainly hope
it will not take place with bicyclists whizzing
by and people hawking tickets to Viennese
Mall on the periphery of my wedding party.
