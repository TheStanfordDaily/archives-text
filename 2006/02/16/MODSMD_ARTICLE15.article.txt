# UNCOVERING THE ARCHIVES

### JAMES HOHMANN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Anew exhibit showcases the highlights of the Hoover
Institution Library and Archives' immense, eclectic
mix of millions of artifacts from the 20th century.
Visitors can check out an X-ray of Hitler's head
taken in 1944 after a failed assassination attempt,
entries from the private diary of a top general during World
War 11 and a first edition copy of Mao's "Little Red Book."
The Hoover Memorial Exhibit Pavilion, located next to the
Tower, does not contain many artifacts, and a thorough exami
nation of the material on display should only take a few minutes.
The exhibit is based on a coffee table book compiled by
Hoover research fellow Bertrand Patenaude. The author
poured through the archives of the Institution's library looking
to choose the best pieces to include in a book divided into eight
chapters ranging from "War and Peace" to the "Hoover Tower"
to "Philosophers of Freedom."
In many ways, the museum seems to be an afterthought to the
book, which includes more than 3(X) illustrations. It feels as if the
designers grabbed some of the most compelling items featured
in the book and set them behind the glass.
The exhibit shows only the tip of a large iceberg of impressive
material amassed over the more than 80 years since former U.S.
President and Stanford alumnus Herbert Hoover helped form
the Institution as a library and depository following World War I.
"The exhibit testifies to the truly wonderful richness of the
Hoover Institution collections," says History Prof. David
Kennedy. "Many undergraduates do not realize that the Hoover
Institute was designed as a library. The library and archives still
remain very important."
Kennedy, who won the Pulitzer Prize for history in 2(KK),
pointed to the World War II documents shown as great exam

pics of the kind of original primary sources the Hoover
Archives holds.
One highlight is an original diary of Major General Joseph
Stillvvell, the Army liaison to China during the war. The general
privately detailed his tenuous relationship with his Chinese
counterpart. In one featured entry, Stillwell reflects on being re
lieved of command.The family donated the Stillwell diaries and
all his papers to the Hoover Archives.
Stiliwell's grandson, John Easterbrook, visited the museum
last week.
"It's a fantastic display of a great cross-section of world his
tory," he says.
In one of the displays, there is a flyer announcing a peace rally
scheduled for April 2,1917 — just days before the entrance of
the United States into World War I — where University Presi
dent David Starr Jordan spoke out passionately against Ameri
can intervention abroad.
There are extremely rare relics dating from the Russian and
Chinese Revolutions, a handwritten draft of Milton Friedman's
Nobel Prize acceptance speech and propaganda posters from
the wars of the last century.
Ambassador Bill Lane, retired publisher of Sunset Magazine,
and his wife donated much of the money that made the book and
exhibit possible.
Lane calls the book a "mother load" of historical detail. The
1942 Stanford graduate says that the displays remind him of his
service in the U.S. Navy during the Second World War.
"There has been a fantastic accumulation of raw material
from all over the world that they have brought in under the um
brella of the Hoover Institution," Lane says."This book captures
the spirit of peace that President Hoover had in mind when he
started the foundation in 1919."
The exhibit will run through May 6. The Memorial Exhibit
Pavilion is open 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.Tuesday through Saturday.
