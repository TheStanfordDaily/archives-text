## Editorial Keeping the dream alive when the Bubble pops 
### 
We grow out of our ideals. They are
the stuff of youth—a time of
naivete and leisure, a time to fanta
size about peace and equality, a time to en
tertain simplistic visions of a better world.
But once life hits us, once we've been
dumped out of the Bubble, we will grow up
fast. We will find ourselves caught up in the
currents of the messy, conflicted world in
which staying afloat is the main priority.
Isn't that the plan? In the Bubble, our
ideals are protected by our innocence and
are never tested by reality. With our un
spoiled ideals, we can go on being Good
Human Beings: volunteering at the Haas
Center, engaging in various acts of philan
thropy and acknowledging our privilege
without jeopardizing it. In no time, these
Good Deeds will find their way into bullet
points on a C.V. Before we know it, we will
be completely ready for a future of corpo
rate responsibility, PTA meetings and
checks made out to the Red Cross.
But those on campus who are truly pas
sionate about social activism have invested a
lot more than token effort and good faith to
their respective causes. These causes are
spectacularly diverse: student groups tutor
janitors, inmates and high school students;
advocate against genocide in Darfur; feed
the homeless and raise awareness on global
AIDS. Find your cause and exhaust your en
ergy on it while you still can,because one day
you will be expected to give it up. Eventual
ly, you will grow up and grow out of your ide
alism.
Community service and political ac
tivism are extracurricular activities. Iliey
are extraneous, supplementary and unnec
essary. If you choose to participate, you will
be congratulated. Perhaps you will not
choose to participate out of your own voli
tion. Perhaps you will be forced to perform
community service perfunctorily, selling lol
lipops in White Plaza to benefit some fund
you've never heard of and know nothing
about.
The Stanford Bubble boxes off service to
humanity as an assertion of youthful ideals.
You will graduate from all of it anil face your
first compromise. You will put off making
that Difference you were always planning to

make for a little while later, once you've es
tablished yourself. And once established,
you will quickly realize what it truly means
to be established. Establishment, as it turns
out, is not a very mobile condition. Just ask
your parents
Maybe some of you have already dis
missed this as little more than inflammatory
rhetoric. "It doesn't apply to me," you say.
But part of being human is reaching outside
of ourselves—to our family, our friends, and
others around us. How can we live up to our
full potential if others are not able to live up
to theirs?
For those of us who care truly about so
cial causes, maybe it's worth thinking a bit
more about these issues. I low can we come
together as a community to encourage more
people to participate in meaningful causes?
How do we snap the general student body
out of a catatonic state of apathy? Before we
face the corruption and complication of the
real world, how do we strengthen the noble
passions we are developing in the ethereal
Bubble?
We could start by treating these passions
with a little more dignity. Stanford could
consider implementing a service-in-the
major program, designed to reify our noble
sentiments and give them life beyond gradu
ation. English majors, for instance, could
study the ethics of representation and the
political power of art, and engineers could
focus on the responsibility of the technolo
gies of power and development they are
wielding.
We are not asking for a prescription for
ideals; the term "values" is too corrupted and
morally ambiguous to still hold any mean
ing. But why not open up a forum to discuss
what accountability actually means? We
need a platform where we can engage in dis
cussions, raise awareness about various
causes and question our own thinking and
paths.
In the meantime, don't just venerate
those who work for social causes. Get in
volved in programs that give life and realis
tic application to your abstract ideals. Who
ever you are and whatever you believe, hold
tight to your beliefs: It's all you'll have once
the Bubble pops.
