# A 						Modern Fairytale
## A 						column dedicated to truth 
### 
With a little help from The Facebook,
a friend from high school organized
a mini-reunion that took place dur
ing winter break. Ten or so of us — some
who hadn't seen each other since graduation
three years ago — gathered in a restaurant
off Union Square to catch up and ask about
one another's plans for the future.To be hon
est, all anyone was interested in was deter
mining how we each measured up, success
wise, to our former classmates. While my
friends were researching AIDS in Africa, or
starting a company that made clothing out of
hemp and fielding offers from Google, Mer
cer and the like. I took a leave of absence and
worked at an asbestos-testing company for
much of the fall.
In light of all this, my New Year's Resolu
tion was to do something unique to set my
self apart — something relatively creative,
since I have no actual skills. Although I'd
rather walk barefoot over a bed of rusty nails
than hear the classic Stanford question,"Are
you a techie or a fuzzy?" I toe the line be
tween those hated labels. As an English
major who plans to eventually attend med
ical school, I'm drawn to artistic endeavors
that I don't really have the talent to pull off.
When I was younger, my dream was to
become a painter, mostly because I really
liked the idea of wearing berets. Sadly, that
dream died hard early on when my elemen
tary school art teachers checked the "needs
improvement" box in the ability section of
my report card year after year.
In high school, I wanted to become a
short story writer and would clip New York
Times articles I found quirky or interesting
and save them in a drawer next to my bed,
claiming I was going to use them as inspira
tion — kind of like a literary hope chest. In
my nearly 22 years of life, I've completed
maybe six stories, most of these in grade
school, and usually involving talking animals
— another ambition down the crapper. I
never got rid of the clippings, though.
The solution seemed simple: Why not
write a column for The Daily? As I've writ
ten time and time again in my (thus far un
successful) job-seeking cover letters, work
ing for The Daily has been my main ex
tracurricular activity throughout college.
That's in spite of the fact that I've sworn off

working here more times than Jude Law and
Sienna Miller have broken up.
Writing for this paper is a lot like hooking
up with an ex: You know you probably
shouldn't get into that whole mess again, but
it's just so familiar and certainly doesn't feel
bad in the heat of the moment.
I remember reading Julie Ruvolo and
Jennie Kim's columns back in the day and
wishing I could pull-off the effortless cool
those ladies exuded in their writing. I've
never written for Opinions before, but it
seems like writing about yourself should be
much easier than writing fiction where you
need to make stuff up and have it be both be
lievable and not corny. 1 mean, if Dave
Blackmail can write a great column, how
hard can it be?
And, like Oprah, I am deeply committed
to truth over "truthiness."To illustrate, when
1 want to impress people with how bohemian
I am, this is what I say I've been doing since
attending Stanford in Oxford last spring:
"Well, during the summer I lived in a car
with my best friend from high school, then
dropped out of school and temped at an as
bestos-testing agency. 1 have no idea what
I'm doing with my life."
And here is something closer to the truth:
I could have graduated last June, but chose
not to for a variety of reasons, not least of
which is to be able to walk this coming June
with the rest of my class. But until then, I'll be
studying abroad again, this time in South
Africa. Living in a car is another column en
tirely.
The bit about working at an asbestos
testing company, however, is 100% true. Al
though I personally didn't handle any poten
tial asbestos myself, there were usually mys
terious packages lying around that were sus
pected to contain a variety of nefarious sub
stances. Working there also caused me to de
velop a strange and persistent twitch in my
right eyelid that only stopped when I left.
In the end, if this becomes a modern fairy
tale, where this little column results in world
wide recognition, or at least employment,
I'm not complaining.
