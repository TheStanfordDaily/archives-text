## Wins against the Arizona schools would start to dig the men out of serious BUBBLE TROUBLE MAPLES MAGIC: Card 10-1 at home 
### SEAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"I don't know how many wins we
need to get into the [NCAA Tourna
ment]; we
just need to take it game-by-game," sen
ior guard Chris Hernandez said as he sat
down to the men's basketball press con
ference on Tuesday.
The short answer is that Stanford
needs to win virtually all of them. After
falling to California and No. 5 Gonzaga
over the weekend, the Cardinal (12-9,8-
4 Pac-10) float somewhere on the fringes
of the NCAA Tournament bubble.
Stanford holds the third-best record
in the conference, but the team has not
defeated any significant non-conference
opponents. And two of the teams below
them in conference standings, Washing
ton and Arizona, might get into the tour
nament on the strength of their overall
records, leaving the Cardinal out.
Last weekend's losses were particu
larly disheartening because Stanford fi
nally seems to be coming into its own.
The team had a chance to win on the
final play at Berkeley. It then fell by only
four to Gonzaga in a hostile road envi
ronment, hanging close despite the fact
that Hernandez sat out most of the sec -
ond half with foul trouble.
"We're real close to being a good
team, we're just not there yet," senior
forward Matt Haryasz said.
To Hernandez — as well as the
NCAA selection committee — a loss is.

The shades were no fashion statement for senior forward Matt Haryasz in a 65-62 loss at Cal last Thursday night. On
Tuesday, Coach Trent Johnson said Haryasz's vision was not perfect last weekend, but is at 100% for tonight's contest.
