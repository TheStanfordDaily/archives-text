## Wins against the Arizona schools would start to dig the men out of serious BUBBLE TROUBLE MAPLES MAGIC: Card 10-1 at home 
### SEAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"I don't know how many wins we
need to get into the [NCAA Tourna
ment]; we
just need to take it game-by-game," sen
ior guard Chris Hernandez said as he sat
down to the men's basketball press con
ference on Tuesday.
The short answer is that Stanford
needs to win virtually all of them. After
falling to California and No. 5 Gonzaga
over the weekend, the Cardinal (12-9,8-
4 Pac-10) float somewhere on the fringes
of the NCAA Tournament bubble.
Stanford holds the third-best record
in the conference, but the team has not
defeated any significant non-conference
opponents. And two of the teams below
them in conference standings, Washing
ton and Arizona, might get into the tour
nament on the strength of their overall
records, leaving the Cardinal out.
Last weekend's losses were particu
larly disheartening because Stanford fi
nally seems to be coming into its own.
The team had a chance to win on the
final play at Berkeley. It then fell by only
four to Gonzaga in a hostile road envi
ronment, hanging close despite the fact
that Hernandez sat out most of the sec -
ond half with foul trouble.
"We're real close to being a good
team, we're just not there yet," senior
forward Matt Haryasz said.
To Hernandez — as well as the
NCAA selection committee — a loss is.

The shades were no fashion statement for senior forward Matt Haryasz in a 65-62 loss at Cal last Thursday night. On
Tuesday, Coach Trent Johnson said Haryasz's vision was not perfect last weekend, but is at 100% for tonight's contest.
well, a loss.
"Moral victories are more for your mom
to tell you,'good job,"' Hernandez joked.
The Cardinal's best hope might rest in the
Pac-10 Tournament — whoever wins the
end-of-season playoff gets an automatic
March Madness bid. That doesn't mean,
however, that the team is looking ahead to it.
Stanford head coach Trent Johnson in
sists that he hasn't even started to think
about Arizona (15-9, 8-5), who comes to
Maples on Sunday. He refused to answer a
question about the Wildcats on Tuesday, tak
ing a dramatic pause before pointedly
changing the subject to Arizona State (9-13,
3-10), the team that the Cardinal host at 7
p.m. tonight.
Stanford beat the Sun Devils, 70-64, in the
teams' first meeting of the year in Tempe.
Haryasz carried the Cardinal in that contest,
scoring 27 points, including 17 in the second
half.
Haryasz is coming off a sub-par weekend,
in which he scored only 29 points in two
games, below his season average of 18.1 per
contest. He was affected by a bruised eye
socket, but on Tuesday he said that he was
100 percent for the first time since sustaining
the injury in a game against Oregon nearly
two weeks ago.
"Matt had a problem with his vision
[over the weekend]," Johnson said. "He did
n't say anything — he doesn't make excuses
— but it was pretty evident. He shot fine
when he was stationary, but he had trouble
when he was on the move. I actually think it
was more that he lost conditioning and
rhythm, because he hadn't practiced for a
week."
Johnson said that he thought Haryasz
looked visibly fatigued in the second half
against Gonzaga, when he missed several
shots that he might have sunk under normal
circumstances.
Haryasz was also bothered by a double
(and sometimes triple-) team by Gonzaga —
a tactic that Arizona State will likely employ
as well, according to Johnson, especially be

cause Haryasz burned them in the teams'
last meeting.
"1 want to try to get into better position
early," said Haryasz, presumably hoping to be
in a better position to shoot before attracting
the double team. He also mentioned that he
hopes to break down the double by passing to
open teammates or dribbling out of it.
Haryasz will have his hands full on de
fense with the Sun Devils' Jeff Pendergraph.
The freshman forward scored 14 points in
only 10 first-half minutes in the teams' first
meeting before leaving the game with a
sprained ankle, but he figures to be a major
player this time around.
Pendergraph, whom Johnson said might
be the conference's best freshman, averages
10.3 points per game. His scoring total has
been topped only by sharp-shooting guards
Kevin Kruger and Bryson Krueger, who av
erage 14.6 and 12.0 points, respectively. They
can fill it up in a hurry: both shoot 40 percent
from beyond the arc.
Though Johnson claims he is not looking
ahead to Sunday's contest against Arizona,
Stanford fans certainly are. They will not
soon forget Nick Robinson's 40-foot last
second heave that beat the Wildcats and pre
served the Cardinal's unbeaten season two
years ago. Stanford has won the last two
meetings at Maples Pavilion, but Arizona
claimed the four before that.
With 18.3 points per game, guard Has
san Adams leads the Wildcats. Guards
Marcus Williams and Mustafa Shakur and
center Ivan Radenovic also average in
double-digits.
Arizona has disappointed this year and,
like the Cardinal, finds itself on the NCAA
Tournament bubble. But it might receive a
lift from guard Chris Rodgers, who was aver
aging 10.8 points per game when head coach
Lute Olson kicked him off the team a day
before the Wildcats played Stanford in
Tempe on Jan. 19.
Olson announced on Monday that he had
reinstated Rodgers, though it is not clear
whether or not he will play this weekend.
