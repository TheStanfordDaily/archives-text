# Dems: Please don't nominate Hillary
## 
### 
If the Democrats want to win in 2(X)8, they
shouldn't nominate Hillary for the Presi
dential election.
Don't get me wrong, I love Hillary. I think
she is a brilliant campaigner. She has already
raised more money than any of the other
would-be Democratic nominees. I agree with
all of her policy positions and think her re
sentment of the Bush White House is right
on. I'd vote for her.
But, as a card-carrying Democrat, I des
perately want to win in 2(XhS and if the De
mocrats keep up their lackluster perform
ance of this year and nominate Hillary, we'll
have no chance.
In a CBS interview two weeks ago. Presi
dent Bush called Hillary "formidable" and
discussed the odd friendship that has devel
oped between Bush Sr. and Bill. Bob Schief
fer, who conducted the interview, added that
Hillary was angling for the nomination.
Eventually, Bush Jr. noted that if Hillary gets
elected we'd have "Bush, Clinton, Bush, Cli
nton."
Republicans, wondering what the hell
their fearless leader was doing, dispatched
Republican National Committee Chairman
Ken Mehlman to "Meet the Press" for dam
age control. Melhman wasted no time attack
ing Hillary to reassure Republicans that no
President of theirs could endorse a woman,
let alone Hillary. Mehlman called Hillary
"angry" and said that historically the United
States doesn't elect candidates with such
contempt.
Mehlman is certainly right: Hillary is
angry. No one missed her head-shaking scowl
during the State of the Union. Her attacks on
the Bush's "plantation" White House were
both articulate and well timed. As Maureen
Dowd said in one of her recent columns, the

problem is not that Hillary is angry, it's that
she's not angry enough.
1 agree with Dowd, but the country isn't
ready for Hillary and I don't think the De
mocrats really want Hillary; they just think
they do.
The Democrats want Bill back. We miss
Bill. Sex scandal or no sex scandal. Bill was
the oasis in the desert of Republican presi
dencies. He was articulate, brilliant and was
able to take controversial stances on Repub
lican-owned issues because he was so popu
lar. Does anyone remember that Bill's ap
proval rating actually went up during the
Lewinsky scandal?
Just last week the difference between
Hillary and Bill was highlighted at Corretta
Scott King's funeral. Without using any
notes, Bill passionately addressed and ignit
ed the predominately Black audience who
remembered why they loved Bill and the De
mocratic Party just six years ago. Hillary fol
lowed with a formulaic and, well, boring lec
ture on King's historical significance.
And maybe that's what Mehlman meant
in his remarks. It isn't that Hillary is "angry,"
it's that she is a no-nonsense, driven, man
eating woman and the men of our country
aren't ready for her.
Even here at Stanford, where the intellec
tual and cultural elite gather to further their

personal and academic education, the guys
aren't ready to be challenged by a fearless
woman.
Just last week, I was hanging out with
some of the guys 1 live with who were perus
ing their group on The Facebook, "The Utter
Dominators of Females."The group, which is
all male, was evidently started in jest —
though I don't think all of its members know
that.The group posts stories of female humil
iation and male macho posturing evidently
for no reason other than pure entertainment.
The group's picture is an overweight woman
passed out drunk and naked on a park picnic
table. And while 1 admit some of the stuff on
the site is funny, it's only in the way that the
dad getting hit in the nuts by his son with a
baseball bat on "America's Funniest Home
Videos" is funny. (The group has already
been thrown off Ilie Facebook, so don't
bother searching for it.)
But what lies beneath the stories and pic
tures is disturbing. Have the guys of Stanford
really reached the point where it is necessary
to stroke our own egos by highlighting and
discussing the humiliating stories of women?
Especially considering that the guys I know
in the group have their own humiliating sto
ries which put those on the Web site to
shame.
If the Democrats think Hillary can cap
ture the vote of U.S. men, and especially
young U.S. men that are supposedly more lib
eral than their elders, then they are drastical
ly mistaken. When it comes down to it, my
fellow countrymen arc too scared of Hillary
to vote for her.

in his remarks. It isn't that Hillary is "angry,"
it's that she is a no-nonsense, driven, man
eating woman and the men of our country
aren't ready for her.
Even here at Stanford, where the intellec
tual and cultural elite gather to further their

personal and academic education, the guys
aren't ready to be challenged by a fearless
woman.
Just last week, I was hanging out with
some of the guys 1 live with who were perus
ing their group on The Facebook, "The Utter
Dominators of Females."The group, which is
all male, was evidently started in jest —
though I don't think all of its members know
that.The group posts stories of female humil
iation and male macho posturing evidently
for no reason other than pure entertainment.
The group's picture is an overweight woman
passed out drunk and naked on a park picnic
table. And while 1 admit some of the stuff on
the site is funny, it's only in the way that the
dad getting hit in the nuts by his son with a
baseball bat on "America's Funniest Home
Videos" is funny. (The group has already
been thrown off Ilie Facebook, so don't
bother searching for it.)
But what lies beneath the stories and pic
tures is disturbing. Have the guys of Stanford
really reached the point where it is necessary
to stroke our own egos by highlighting and
discussing the humiliating stories of women?
Especially considering that the guys I know
in the group have their own humiliating sto
ries which put those on the Web site to
shame.
If the Democrats think Hillary can cap
ture the vote of U.S. men, and especially
young U.S. men that are supposedly more lib
eral than their elders, then they are drastical
ly mistaken. When it comes down to it, my
fellow countrymen arc too scared of Hillary
to vote for her.
