Holt's column suffers from
poor simile use
I owe a debt of gratitude to Allison
Dencker for her letter ("Column encourages
negative stereotypes," Feb. 15). I, too, read
Chris I lolt's column on Monday ("To Chuck
and Hunter With Love," Feb. 13). And Ltoo,
felt my heart sink. But I would never have
had the guts to write this letter if she had not
bravely come out first to criticize an unfortu
nate column and sentence in an otherwise
promising writer's portfolio.
I am neither a woman, nor the president
of any recognized sorority, let alone a whole
council of them. But I did feel the pain as a
reader and (full disclosure here) a former co
writer of Chris's. Though I may be biased, I
think it makes my pain even more deeply
felt. These words come not only with the au
thority of the masthead of the Daily behind
them, but also with the familiarity of a man I
once thought a friend.

To remind readers who merely peruse
through instead of poring over the Daily,
Chris's sentence was, "Women, high on fem
inist power generated from 'The Vagina
Monologues," anticipation for Women's His
tory Month and the success of TV's 'Grey's
Anatomy,' patrol this campus like Pi Phis
looking for their fix."
Ms. Dencker glossed over a major prob
lem of the sentence by highlighting only one
or two flaws of this prose. But how could
anyone not notice the fact that Chris's simi
le draws a comparison from one group to
another group that is a strict subset of the
first?
It is as if he wrote, "The large cats, hungry
for meat, stalked their prey like tigers burn
ing bright." Well of course they didâ€”many
large cats arc tigers, just like how many
women patrolling campus are Pi Phis.
It is conceivable that this restriction is not
in the letter of the law handed down in fourth
grade when one learns about figurative lan

guage, but this is nonetheless the poorest of
usages. The raison d'etre of the simile is
imagination, and the imagination can only
come when the two things being likened are.
well, not alike.
I admit that there can certainly be overlap
between the two classes being likened. For
instance, had he compared the women to
"Hoover Institution Fellows in discussion
with a resident of F.BF." we would have just
as easily understood the feeding frenzy at
mosphere he was attempting to relate.
It is possible that the Hoover Institution
Fellows are themselves women, but because
it is in such a different arena (professional vs.
personal), I would gladly have read past a
sentence thusly constructed with barely a
harrumph of disdain. Of course, for full
points, Mr. Holt would have written "like Phi
Psis late for their engineering lecture."
