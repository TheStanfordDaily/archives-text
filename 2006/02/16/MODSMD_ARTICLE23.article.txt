Running the Cardinal boards last Thursday
against UC-Santa Barbara, junior forward Ezia
maka Okafor made her presence felt. With 14
points and eight rebounds, Okafor's energy kept
her moving up and down the court.
The scene looked very different on the Wash
ington floor in January 2005, as Okafor sat on
the court trying to get the coaches' attention.
Okafor said she was thinking, "Wow. This is
not possible." She had torn her right Achilles
tendon, and, within seven minutes of play, suf
fered her third injury in three years.
Following an ACL injury sustained the sum
mer before her freshman year and a torn left
Achilles tendon during her sophomore season,
Okafor's injury list grew once more.
"I thought I was done with injuries, but like
my mom says, everything happens for a reason,"
Okafor said.
Having averaged 22.0 points and 9.0 rebounds
per game as a high school senior. Okafor was
named 2002 Gatorade Missouri Player of the
Year. Competing in a Missouri all-star game the
summer before she came to Stanford, she experi
enced her knee injury that ended up keeping her
from playing her entire first year on the Farm.
Cleared to play at a tournament in Italy the
following year, Okafor was ready to finally con
tribute. She came to the first pre-tournament
practice and performed well, to the satisfaction
of Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer. But in
the second practice, something happened.
"I was running down the court and all of a
sudden I heard a pop," Okafor said. "I thought
somebody had kicked me or something."
The pop was her left Achilles tendon. Rather
than head to Italy, Okafor stayed for surgery.
"That was very sad news,"she said."lt was es
pecially hard because I had just come back and 1
was playing well after one practice. But now I
was down with another injury."
Again. Okafor had to wait on the Cardinal
bench, having not yet played in a single colle
giate match. She was finally able to contribute in
February of her second year, in a 2004 game
against Southern California.
"It was exciting to actually be in a game after
being on the sidelines for so long." Okafor said.
Okafor followed up with her first career
points in a match against California. To this day,
she says she remembers the move and her shot
from the baseline.
"The team was excited for me, and I was ex
cited." Okafor said.
The season ended, however, with only one
more appearance, and after 14 games the follow
ing year, Okafor had her fall at Washington,
from which she is still recuperating.
The experience has been frustrating for
Okafor, but she's worked hard to stay focused
and come out strong when she does play. This

THE FORECAST

season, she's averaging over 13 minutes, and
nearly four points and four rebounds per game.
She acknowledges her skills are rusty, and
said she'll improve with time.
But Okafor still attempts to make up for her
technical shortcomings with the intensity she
brings to the game.
"Since my skills aren't up to par, or where I
would like them to be, I mainly focus on playing
hard," she said. "You can overcome a lot of
things through just playing hard and having a lot
of energy."
l"he rest of the Cardinal agree, including Van-
Derveer.
"With her injuries, she's not a real experi
enced player," she said. "But she brings so many
other intangibles, like her hustle and her aggres-

siveness, and those are things we really need."
Okafor brought such intangibles, along with
her scoring and rebounding, to the court last
Thursday against the Gauchos. VanDerveer and
her teammates noted her energy.
"[My energy] has definitely been bundled up
over these years," Okafor said.
And by unleashing her intensity, Okafor has
made herself a force on the team — "knocking
on the door," as VanDerveer said, of the Cardi
nal's current six-player rotation. Okafor knows
what she has to do to get inside of the rotation.
"I'm going to keep on bringing energy to the
court, and intensity and aggressiveness," she
said. "For me, now that February's here, I'm less
apprehensive just because I've lasted past my in
jury date of last year."

Junior forward Eziamaka Okafor was injured during each of her first three seasons at Stanford. This year,
however, she has been healthy and able to contribute, averaging 3.7 points and 3.5 rebounds per game.

hard," she said. "You can overcome a lot of
things through just playing hard and having a lot

siveness, and those are things we really need."
Okafor brought such intangibles, along with
her scoring and rebounding, to the court last
Thursday against the Gauchos. VanDerveer and
her teammates noted her energy.
"[My energy] has definitely been bundled up
over these years," Okafor said.
And by unleashing her intensity, Okafor has
made herself a force on the team — "knocking
on the door," as VanDerveer said, of the Cardi
nal's current six-player rotation. Okafor knows
what she has to do to get inside of the rotation.
"I'm going to keep on bringing energy to the
court, and intensity and aggressiveness," she
said. "For me, now that February's here, I'm less
apprehensive just because I've lasted past my in
jury date of last year."

Junior forward Eziamaka Okafor was injured during each of her first three seasons at Stanford. This year,
however, she has been healthy and able to contribute, averaging 3.7 points and 3.5 rebounds per game.

Running the Cardinal boards last Thursday
against UC-Santa Barbara, junior forward Ezia
maka Okafor made her presence felt. With 14
points and eight rebounds, Okafor's energy kept
her moving up and down the court.
The scene looked very different on the Wash
ington floor in January 2005, as Okafor sat on
the court trying to get the coaches' attention.
Okafor said she was thinking, "Wow. This is
not possible." She had torn her right Achilles
tendon, and, within seven minutes of play, suf
fered her third injury in three years.
Following an ACL injury sustained the sum
mer before her freshman year and a torn left
Achilles tendon during her sophomore season,
Okafor's injury list grew once more.
"I thought I was done with injuries, but like
my mom says, everything happens for a reason,"
Okafor said.
Having averaged 22.0 points and 9.0 rebounds
per game as a high school senior. Okafor was
named 2002 Gatorade Missouri Player of the
Year. Competing in a Missouri all-star game the
summer before she came to Stanford, she experi
enced her knee injury that ended up keeping her
from playing her entire first year on the Farm.
Cleared to play at a tournament in Italy the
following year, Okafor was ready to finally con
tribute. She came to the first pre-tournament
practice and performed well, to the satisfaction
of Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer. But in
the second practice, something happened.
"I was running down the court and all of a
sudden I heard a pop," Okafor said. "I thought
somebody had kicked me or something."
The pop was her left Achilles tendon. Rather
than head to Italy, Okafor stayed for surgery.
"That was very sad news,"she said."lt was es
pecially hard because I had just come back and 1
was playing well after one practice. But now I
was down with another injury."
Again. Okafor had to wait on the Cardinal
bench, having not yet played in a single colle
giate match. She was finally able to contribute in
February of her second year, in a 2004 game
against Southern California.
"It was exciting to actually be in a game after
being on the sidelines for so long." Okafor said.
Okafor followed up with her first career
points in a match against California. To this day,
she says she remembers the move and her shot
from the baseline.
"The team was excited for me, and I was ex
cited." Okafor said.
The season ended, however, with only one
more appearance, and after 14 games the follow
ing year, Okafor had her fall at Washington,
from which she is still recuperating.
The experience has been frustrating for
Okafor, but she's worked hard to stay focused
and come out strong when she does play. This

THE FORECAST

season, she's averaging over 13 minutes, and
nearly four points and four rebounds per game.
She acknowledges her skills are rusty, and
said she'll improve with time.
But Okafor still attempts to make up for her
technical shortcomings with the intensity she
brings to the game.
"Since my skills aren't up to par, or where I
would like them to be, I mainly focus on playing
hard," she said. "You can overcome a lot of
things through just playing hard and having a lot
