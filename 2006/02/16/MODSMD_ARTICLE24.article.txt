## Cardinal eclipse Cal in close competition Several team members earn season-best scores for individual routines 
### ANDREA AYALA 
After claiming top honors in three events, the Stan
ford men's gymnastics team topped California on Sat
urday for the third time this season, 210.7-209.95.
"We were really just trying to outdo ourselves,"
senior Sean Doolan said. "We already knew we could
beat Cal, and this really wasn't the main goal of the
competition. We wanted to show ourselves that we
could put up a huge team score and show other teams
that we're in the hunt this year for a national champi
onship."
The No. 4 Cardinal swept the top three spots in
floor exercise with high scoring routines by sopho
mores David Sender and Sho Nakamori, and Doolan.
Sender tallied a 9.7, his season best for the event, fol
lowed by Nakamori's 9.45 and Doolan's 9.25 — also
season-high scores on the floor exercise.
Stanford also posted high scores on the still rings.
Sender tallied a 9.4, taking the first spot, followed by
junior Peter Derman with a 9.2. Cal'sTyler Block took
third place with a 9.1. Junior Dylan Carney took top
honors on the high bar with a 9.35, his season best for
the event.
The pommel horse remained a trouble spot for the

Cardinal. The Bears' Tim McNeil finished first on the
pommel horse with a 9.05, followed by Stanford sen
ior Nate Downs (8.85) and Sender (8.7).
"They did a much better job [on pommel horse],
but there were still some problems," head coach Thom
Glielmi said. "Of the six routines we had. three of the
guys hit their routines. But there were some major
problems (with the other three routines], They kind of
let their routine get away from them."
Glielmi is confident that Stanford is getting closer
to putting up a team score of over 216. While the Car
dinal have done well on different events at each meet,
the goal is now for them to put together all six events
in one meet.
In the past week, the team has come together in its
training by putting more pressure on each other dur
ing practices.Trying to mimic the high pressure atmos
phere of a meet, Stanford is hoping to combat the lack
of consistency that has been the team's main weak
ness in competition this season.
Stanford travels to Philadelphia next to compete in
the Temple Invitational on Saturday. The Cardinal
faces No. 8 Penn State on Sunday.
"We're not concerned about the other teams —
it's more of a competition within ourselves," Glielmi
said. "We're trying to do our best and do what we're
capable of doing. That's the goal. We don't care about
the other guys. What they do has no impact on what
we do."
