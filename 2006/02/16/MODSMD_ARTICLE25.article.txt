# Baseball Classic sans Bonds?
## 
### 
1 mentioned in my last column
that February is a pretty boring
month for sports fans. And guess
what? I was right.
Not even Bode could save us
from boredom, as Miller has yet to
win any medals in the 2006 Torino
Winter Olympics.
Although some of his comments
— which essentially boil down to "I
don't care" — have been amusing,
to say the least. If you get the
chance, visit Nike's Web site,
www.joinbode.com, to see some of
what he's been saying. 1 know one
thing — that "winning isn't every
thing" mantra sure will sell a lot of
shoes.
But I'm going to steer away from
all of that. It's the middle of Febru
ary, basketball season and the Win
ter Olympics, so I'm going to talk
about America's pastime.
The first-ever World Baseball
Classic, which opens March 3, an
nounced the team rosters of the 16
participating nations on Tliesday,
answering several intriguing mys
teries of the universe. Shockingly,
Ichiro will play for Japan, Albert
Pujols for the Dominican Republic
and Derek Jeter will take the field
for the United States. 1 know — un
believable, isn't it?
But the biggest name associated
with the Classic, with the possible
exception of Roger Clemens, is con
spicuous for his absence. Giants
leftfielder Barry Bonds, who by
anyone's estimation is among the
greatest hitters of all time, changed

his mind on Jan. 23 and declined to
play for Team USA. Of course, this
lowers the overall appeal and star
power of the tournament, but it
strikes a particularly hard blow for
me, a Giants fan.
You see, I wanted the rest of
America to feel my pain.
Every time Bonds steps up to the
plate, the average Giants fans soul
is in turmoil. And when 1 say the av
erage Giants fan, 1 mean me, the
super-fan. Do I pray for that one
homer to lift my beloved G-men
over the hated Boys in Blue to the
south, or wish for baseball's reputa
tion and history to remain untar
nished? Is Bonds more important
to me as an individual or as part of
the team that I love?
And then 1 realize that sports
aren't supposed to be about deep
moral dilemmas and philosophical
internal monologue. No, they're
about screaming at the top of your
lungs while swinging a rubber
chicken over your head.
Bonds is probably the most na
tionally vilified sports figure of all
time. He's definitely been more sig
nificantly hated than any Terrell-
Owens-come-lately. And the reason
is obvious. He's a great player as
saulting baseball's most hallowed
of records under suspicion of hav
ing knowingly used performance
enhancing drugs to aid him on his
way to immortality. (And he's an
asshole.)
In my experience, fans often
overlook the shortcomings of a
player for their favorite team by
making excuses. For years, Owens
was just a player who wanted to
have fun on the field, at least to
49ers fans. Bob Knight was merely a
fiery and inspirational leader who
sometimes let his emotions get the
best of him, at least if you lived in
