# WOMEN'S TENNIS
## Toughest weekend comes early for Card 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
In its first Pac-10 dual meet,
the women's tennis team faces
what could be its toughest week
end of the regular season. Today,
the team travels to Los Angeles,
where it will take on No. 4
Southern California and No. 17
UCLA this weekend.
The top-ranked Cardinal (7-
0) will have their 63-win streak
put to the test by the Women of
Troy (4-0) on Friday at 1:30 p.m.
Then, the Card will cross into
Westwood to battle the Bruins
(4-1) Saturday at noon.
"It's good to get some tough
matches in early in the season,"
senior Alice Barnes said. "The
LA road trip has traditionally
been the toughest Pac-10 week
end for us, but it's also one that
we've always done well on.
We're very much looking for
ward to it."
Head coach Lele Forood
pointed out that the Card had al
ways visited the LA schools
much later in the season in years
past. But now, with a restruc
tured Pac-10 schedule, the most
important road trip of the sea
son will occur in February, three
full months before the NCAA
Tournament.
"The new Pac-10 schedule no
longer honors traditional week
ends," Forood said. "We have,
though, played some very good
competition lately — both at
the Team Indoors and then with
UNLV last week, so we feel we
are ready for these two very
tough matches."
This weekend will provide
the first glimpse of top-notch
competition for both USC and
UCLA. The Women of TYoy's
highest-ranked opponent so far
was No. 54 San Diego State. The
Bruin's highest-ranked oppo
nent was No. 25 Pepperdine.
But Stanford knows USC
and UCLA will be strong, even

though the southern schools
haven't yet proven themselves
against top teams this season.
"Both of the LA teams are
very good," Forood said. "Right
now we arc only preparing for
USC since they are first."
The Cardinal hold an all-time
match record of 51-17 against
Southern California, with their
last loss coming in 1986. The
Bruins have beaten the Cardinal
more recently, notching a 5-4
upset in IWB in LA.
Though both LA teams will
enjoy a home-court advantage
this weekend. Stanford is more
than familiar with the region. All
told, seven of the 11 team mem
bers grew up in the LA area, and
often played against the players
they will face this weekend.
"USC and UCLA are always
two of our toughest competitors,
especially on their home turf."
senior Jessica Leek said. "The
great thing, though, is that so
many of us are from southern
California that we're looking
forward to having a lot of fan
support from our families.
Though all three teams com
pete in the Pac-10 in tennis, nei
ther of the matches will count to
ward the league standings. But
in spite of the early-season date
and the absence of Pac-10 impli
cations, the team insists pride
alone makes these contests
huge.
"This weekend is very big for
us," Forood said. "Nothing at
this stage of the season is crucial
from a wins standpoint, though,
as we will host these teams here
in April. But we don't like to
lose, ever."
And that hunger for victory
runs deep enough in Barnes that
the senior has a bold prediction
for the weekend.
"We are really keen to get
down there, beat them on their
home courts and assert our au
thority over the Pac-10." she
said.
