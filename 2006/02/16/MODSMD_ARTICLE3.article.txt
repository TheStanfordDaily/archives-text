# Learning the Law from a legend
## Senior Haryasz inspires freshman forward Hill 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
Despite the attention garnered by the
Cardinal's three senior stars, the Stan
ford men's basketball team is actually a
young one. Look beyond Matt Haryasz,
Chris Hernandez and Dan Grunfeld,and
one finds a collection of young players
forced into prominent roles.
The Cardinal have just five active
players who are juniors or seniors (senior
guard Jason Haas and redshirt junior
walk-on Carlton Weatherby are the oth
ers), and this season only three have been
averaging over 11 minutes per game.
The lack of experienced talent has
opened the door for a corps of younger
players, allowing an unexpected oppor
tunity for development. The fans, coach
ing staff and players themselves have all
been granted the chance to look into the
future of Stanford basketball and gauge
the team's potential.
Maybe the most surprising and talent-

Ed player among the up-and-coming
stars has been freshman Lawrence Hill.
Hill — a soft-spoken, 6-foot-8, 205-
pound forward — has become an impor
tant man in the rotation, averaging 4.9
points and 3.5 rebounds in 16 minutes
per game, despite concerns early in the
season regarding his transition to the col
lege game.
Much of the difficulty comes from his
size and the position that he has been
forced to play. Hill was recruited to play
the small forward position, but as a result
of the team's lack of depth at the power
forward and center positions, he has been
forced to step into a role that requires
more size and physicality.
"There are always going to be guys
that are stronger than me," Hill said. "If I
got a lot a bigger there are still going to be
certain guys out there that are bigger
than me, and then there are guys bigger
than that. For me, it is about mixing
strength with the game.
"There were times in the Gonzaga
game when I had a chance to finish
strong and didn't.That didn't have to do
with my relative weakness or other guys
being too physical. It had to do with me
being mentally strong."

Clearly, the transition is not complete
for Hill, who played just two minutes
against Cal after getting heat by Leon
Powe on one of his first plays of the game.
His non-confrontational style of play, as
well as his relatively narrow frame, has
hurt him in situations where he is forced
to be physical.
"For Lawrence, it all has to do with
the physicality of the game," head coach
Ttent Johnson said. "Cal was a physical
game. Gonzaga was a physical game.
Lawrence is an extremely confident
young man, but to be fair you can't ex
pect him to guard a guy 35 pounds heav
ier than he is."
Physicality may not be his game yet.
but Hill has shown his ability to shoot the
ball from the outside. He has taken the
fourth-most three pointers on the team,
and against Washington displayed his
ability to bring the ball up the court
against the press.
Ilie Washington game was special in
many ways for Hill. Not only did the Car
dinal win in dramatic fashion, but Hill
wrote his name in the Stanford record
books, tying a team record held by Curtis

I have to be at
their level —
especially
Matt s. He is
who I want to
play like.
