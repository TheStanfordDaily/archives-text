# Learning the Law from a legend
## Senior Haryasz inspires freshman forward Hill 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
Despite the attention garnered by the
Cardinal's three senior stars, the Stan
ford men's basketball team is actually a
young one. Look beyond Matt Haryasz,
Chris Hernandez and Dan Grunfeld,and
one finds a collection of young players
forced into prominent roles.
The Cardinal have just five active
players who are juniors or seniors (senior
guard Jason Haas and redshirt junior
walk-on Carlton Weatherby are the oth
ers), and this season only three have been
averaging over 11 minutes per game.
The lack of experienced talent has
opened the door for a corps of younger
players, allowing an unexpected oppor
tunity for development. The fans, coach
ing staff and players themselves have all
been granted the chance to look into the
future of Stanford basketball and gauge
the team's potential.
Maybe the most surprising and talent-

Ed player among the up-and-coming
stars has been freshman Lawrence Hill.
Hill — a soft-spoken, 6-foot-8, 205-
pound forward — has become an impor
tant man in the rotation, averaging 4.9
points and 3.5 rebounds in 16 minutes
per game, despite concerns early in the
season regarding his transition to the col
lege game.
Much of the difficulty comes from his
size and the position that he has been
forced to play. Hill was recruited to play
the small forward position, but as a result
of the team's lack of depth at the power
forward and center positions, he has been
forced to step into a role that requires
more size and physicality.
"There are always going to be guys
that are stronger than me," Hill said. "If I
got a lot a bigger there are still going to be
certain guys out there that are bigger
than me, and then there are guys bigger
than that. For me, it is about mixing
strength with the game.
"There were times in the Gonzaga
game when I had a chance to finish
strong and didn't.That didn't have to do
with my relative weakness or other guys
being too physical. It had to do with me
being mentally strong."

Clearly, the transition is not complete
for Hill, who played just two minutes
against Cal after getting heat by Leon
Powe on one of his first plays of the game.
His non-confrontational style of play, as
well as his relatively narrow frame, has
hurt him in situations where he is forced
to be physical.
"For Lawrence, it all has to do with
the physicality of the game," head coach
Ttent Johnson said. "Cal was a physical
game. Gonzaga was a physical game.
Lawrence is an extremely confident
young man, but to be fair you can't ex
pect him to guard a guy 35 pounds heav
ier than he is."
Physicality may not be his game yet.
but Hill has shown his ability to shoot the
ball from the outside. He has taken the
fourth-most three pointers on the team,
and against Washington displayed his
ability to bring the ball up the court
against the press.
Ilie Washington game was special in
many ways for Hill. Not only did the Car
dinal win in dramatic fashion, but Hill
wrote his name in the Stanford record
books, tying a team record held by Curtis

I have to be at
their level —
especially
Matt s. He is
who I want to
play like.

freshman forward
Borchardt and I iaryasz with six blocks in 35 min
utes on the court.
"I think it is cool, but it is something that I
hope to break someday," Hill said."lt's just about
effort. If I come over weakside and block some
one, it helps out the team. I hope to get to seven
or eight someday."
The contrast between that performance by
I lill and the one against Cal last Thursday is easy
to see. Consistency has not been Hills strongest
characteristic in his short Stanford career, but
drastic fluctuations in playing time have certain
ly made it more difficult to play at a constant
level.
For now. Hill's inspiration on the team is the
man whose record he matched — Haryasz. But
while looking up to the senior forward, he also

recognizes that the responsibility to get better
rests on his own shoulders.
"It kind of helps, but it also kind of hurts [to
rely on the older players]," Hill said. "I relax
sometimes watching them, and that hurts me.
But I also pay attention to them and that helps
me to see what works at this level. I have to learn,
pay attention and do my part and try to be at
their level — especially Matt's. He is who 1 want
to play like."
His drive not to rely too heavily on the expe
rienced players will pay off in the near future,
when Stanford loses its top three scorers to grad
uation this coming off-season. With the addition
of a solid recruiting class to a young core group
of players. Hill could be a central part of a strong
frontcourt in the years to come.

against Cal after getting heat by Leon
Powe on one of his first plays of the game.
His non-confrontational style of play, as
well as his relatively narrow frame, has
hurt him in situations where he is forced
to be physical.
"For Lawrence, it all has to do with
the physicality of the game," head coach
Ttent Johnson said. "Cal was a physical
game. Gonzaga was a physical game.
Lawrence is an extremely confident
young man, but to be fair you can't ex
pect him to guard a guy 35 pounds heav
ier than he is."
Physicality may not be his game yet.
but Hill has shown his ability to shoot the
ball from the outside. He has taken the
fourth-most three pointers on the team,
and against Washington displayed his
ability to bring the ball up the court
against the press.
Ilie Washington game was special in
many ways for Hill. Not only did the Car
dinal win in dramatic fashion, but Hill
wrote his name in the Stanford record
books, tying a team record held by Curtis

I have to be at
their level —
especially
Matt s. He is
who I want to
play like.

— LAWRENCE HILL,
freshman forward
Borchardt and I iaryasz with six blocks in 35 min
utes on the court.
"I think it is cool, but it is something that I
hope to break someday," Hill said."lt's just about
effort. If I come over weakside and block some
one, it helps out the team. I hope to get to seven
or eight someday."
The contrast between that performance by
I lill and the one against Cal last Thursday is easy
to see. Consistency has not been Hills strongest
characteristic in his short Stanford career, but
drastic fluctuations in playing time have certain
ly made it more difficult to play at a constant
level.
For now. Hill's inspiration on the team is the
man whose record he matched — Haryasz. But
while looking up to the senior forward, he also

recognizes that the responsibility to get better
rests on his own shoulders.
"It kind of helps, but it also kind of hurts [to
rely on the older players]," Hill said. "I relax
sometimes watching them, and that hurts me.
But I also pay attention to them and that helps
me to see what works at this level. I have to learn,
pay attention and do my part and try to be at
their level — especially Matt's. He is who 1 want
to play like."
His drive not to rely too heavily on the expe
rienced players will pay off in the near future,
when Stanford loses its top three scorers to grad
uation this coming off-season. With the addition
of a solid recruiting class to a young core group
of players. Hill could be a central part of a strong
frontcourt in the years to come.
