## GSC passes small changes to charter 
### SILVIA SANCHEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) met last night to confirm
the new ASSU Elections Commis
sion, vote on proposed changes to
the ASSU Judicial Charter and
discuss the future of Flicks.
Second-year law student and
newly-elected Elections Com
missioner Tim Sanders an
nounced that there will be an in
formation session for those inter
ested in running for a spot on the
GSC from Feb. 21 through 22.
Sanders said the commission's
main goal is to publicize the com
mittee is looking for candidates in
order to get more graduate stu
dents involved in the ASSU.
The upcoming information
session is for undergraduate stu
dents as well, and will describe all
the positions in the ASSU, includ
ing both the undergraduate sen
ate and the GSC. The first infor
mation session will be held in the
ASSU office in Tressider Union,
and the second will be held at the
Graduate Community Center.
GSC leaders said they were
pleased with the newly-con
firmed Elections Commission.
"We're excited about the Elec
tions Commission that has just
been approved," second-year law
student and GSC Co-chair Jenny
Allen said. "I'm looking forward
to working with them to increase
the graduate student turnout at
the upcoming election in the
spring."
Allen also said she hoped to
raise awareness about the spring
elections at popular graduate stu
dent events. Calling last Sunday's
Grad Night at Hicks a huge suc
cess. she suggested the possibility
of sponsoring another Grad Night
this quarter in order to "tag team
with elections and to recruit peo
ple to run for various GSC posi
tions."
Maria Spletter,the GSC Flicks
coordinator, said she expects the
Grad Night program to continue.
"Every quarter during the
school year, the GSC sponsors a

Grad Night at Flicks, where grad
uate students get in free and we
provide donuts and juice," she
said. "This quarter had the best
turnout ever, with 290 grad stu
dents who came to watch "Rent.'
We will be sponsoring another
Flicks night this quarter because
of the popular response."
Spletter also commented on
the changes being made to Flicks.
"Basically, Flicks will now be a
joint-service project," she said.
"This means that instead of Flicks
being part of SSE — the part of
the ASSU that generates money
— Flicks will now be a service
project, which will most likely go
on the special fees ballot. If this
occurs, then students will vote
whether to support Flicks or not.
This would be a big benefit be
cause it would mean that tickets
for students would be either very
cheap or free."
Also addressed were the revi
sions to the ASSU Judicial Char
ter. The Undergraduate Senate
approved changes to correct
minor typographical errors and a
minor word change on TUesday
night. The GSC voted to approve
those modifications last night as
well.
According to GSC Co-chair
Tom Lee. a fourth-year electrical
engineering doctoral student, the
GSC will discuss more major
changes to the charter next week.
The GSC also approved a
number of funding requests sub
mitted by student groups. The
Stanford German association re
ceived funding for a Fasching cel
ebration on Feb. 26. The Stanford
Chemistry Women's Committee
on Graduate Life requested
funding for a March 13 seminar
titled "Uncle Sam Wants You,"
featuring a panel of scientists who
have chosen careers in govern
ment service. Argentinos en Stan
ford received funding for a tradi
tional Argentine barbeque to be
held on Feb. 26. Finally, the GSC
funded the group Bio-AIMS, who
will hold a series of events de
signed to encourage diversity in
biological sciences.
