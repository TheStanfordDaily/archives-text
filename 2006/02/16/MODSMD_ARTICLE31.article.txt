## Scientist isolates single skin color gene 
### DIANNA BAI 
Skin color has long been a perennial basis for
discrimination and point of contention in U.S. so
ciety. In the field of science, however, a team of re
searchers led by Geneticist Keith Cheng of the
Penn State College of Medicine recently discov
ered that variations in skin color may arise from a
single gene among the billions that determine
human appearance.
Invited by the Stanford Scientific Review and
the Human Biology Department as part of a pub
lic lecture series, Cheng spoke last night to audi
ence members eager to learn about the genetic
foundation of race.
"We thought Dr. Cheng would be a good

speaker for the series," said sophomore Anjali
Vaidya, an editor of The Stanford Scientific Re
view. "His work contributes to many disciplines,
including biology, sociology and anthropology."
During the first part of the lecture, "Uncover
ing the Mysteries of Human Skin Color," Cheng
explained the history of the project. Ten years ago
his team set out to understand cancer-cell muta
tion in zebrafish.an aquarium pet commonly used
in genetic studies. However, the course of their
study led them down a different path and Cheng's
team was able to successfully identify the SLc24as
gene, the one responsible for determining about
one-third of human skin color.
"The same gene associated with the 'golden'
type zebrafish is also responsible for different pig
ments in humans," Cheng said.

The team found that a spectrum of skin colors
correlated with the frequency of a mutant
SLc24as allele.
Cheng's groundbreaking research, featured on
the cover of Science magazine last December, has
ground-breaking implications for both future sci
entific studies and long-standing social percep
tions.
The discovery may also be a jumping-off point
to find a way to prevent or even cure skin cancer.
"We may also be able to use this knowledge to
get a darker skin without going to the tanning
salon," Cheng said lightheartedly.
Furthermore, knowing the agent behind skin
color could potentially provide insight into un
solved mysteries, why certain races have higher
susceptibility to particular diseases, for example.
These racial-based predispositions include posi
tive correlations between Europeans and Parkin
son's disease, and African-American soldiers and
frostbite.
Beyond the scientific front. Cheng's discovery
could also impact the way racial issues are dis
cussed in America today.
Many of Cheng's colleagues advised precau
tion when discussing race.
"When people bring up race, you should just
say it doesn't exist," Cheng said. "Of course you're
uncomfortable [in studying race]. Talking about
race has had lots of historic trouble."
While he addressed the determinants of race
aside from genetics — namely language, religion
and nationality — he stressed that this idea that
one gene is responsible for skin color should illu
minate the futility of racial discrimination and
hostility.
"One base pair of genes makes the difference
between European and African skin color, and
that skin color has caused people to be not be able
to sit in the front of the bus, to be enslaved, to have
unequal opportunities," Cheng said. "People have
died because of this. What for? We should think
about this."
Students who attended the lecture expressed
similar sentiments.
"It seems that people are stuck on skin color as
a reason to prejudice people," said junior biology
major Theo Huzyk. "But I think if people under
stood how simple of a change it was that made the
zebrafish different, it could change their out
looks."
To end the lecture, Cheng emphasized the spir
it of scientific collaboration between the many
people and institutes that led to the discovery.
"We can choose to use scientific reason, rather
than politics, to make important societal deci
sions," Cheng said.
"I think it's time to celebrate what science has
to offer and use collaboration like scientists do to
make policies. Can you imagine how many lives
we would have saved if we used the same kind of
collaboration and organization in New Orleans?"
he asked the audience.
Cheng illustrated his point artistically by per
forming a cello-piano duet with a colleague, again
highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of scien
tific discovery.
"The music was cool because it brought out
that science is one of the humanities," co-terminal
student Manu Lakkur said after the event.
"What we can do together is so much better
than we could possibly do individually," Cheng
concluded.
