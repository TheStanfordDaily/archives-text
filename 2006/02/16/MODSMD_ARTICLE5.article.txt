## ASU final step to 6th straight league title Card all but clinch with win tonight, then visit an emotional Arizona Saturday 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Tonight inTempe.No. 11 Stanford will try to do something
no team has done this year — beat No. 17 Arizona State on
its home court.The Sun Devils are 12-0 in Wells Fargo Arena
this season and have won six straight since losing at Stanford
on Jan. 21.
"There's a certain amount of comfort for them in their
own home," sophomore guard Candice Wiggins said." Iliey
were winning for pretty much the whole [last] game, and I
think they're probably just feeding off of that, it's going to a
battle, and we won't be surprised if they come out over-ag
gressive."
Arizona State (20-5, 11-4 Pac-iO) currently sits alone in
second place in the conference, 1.5 games behind the front
running Cardinal (18-5,12-2).The Sun Devils would be even
closer to the top if they had managed to keep a 12-point lead
in the first game at Stanford.The Cardinal,paced by 33 points
from Wiggins, came back to win, 84-78.
Stanford is currently trying to make sense of a 55-46 de
fensive slugfest at California this past Saturday. Though the
Cardinal got the victory and stifled any Cal attack, they strug
gled to a season-low in points and only shot 38.8 percent from
the field, down from their conference-leading 47 percent.
"Honestly, I thought our offense was horrific," coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "You know, I think sometimes you need to
hit rock bottom to come back up — and I think we hit rock
bottom."
But opponents are unconvinced by VanDerveer's hyper
bole.
"I don't think Stanford lost their ability to score," said Ari
zona State coach Charli Thrner Thorne, who ranked the game
a "9 or 10" on a l-to-10 scale of importance. "1 think they're
still a tremendous team that's very explosive and as their
record [shows], they're successful."
On the plus side for the Cardinal, a much-improved
Kristin Newlin will play tonight. The junior forward seems to
be fully recovered from a stress fracture suffered in Decem
ber. She was one board away from a double-double last Sat
urday (10 points,9 rebounds).
"[My play and my health are] getting better all the time."

Junior forward Brooke Smith skies toward the hoop in a 81 -47
blowout win over UCSB last Thursday. Smith's 57% shooting
leads the Card, and her 16.9 points per game ranks second.
