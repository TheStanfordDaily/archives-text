## ASU final step to 6th straight league title Card all but clinch with win tonight, then visit an emotional Arizona Saturday 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Tonight inTempe.No. 11 Stanford will try to do something
no team has done this year — beat No. 17 Arizona State on
its home court.The Sun Devils are 12-0 in Wells Fargo Arena
this season and have won six straight since losing at Stanford
on Jan. 21.
"There's a certain amount of comfort for them in their
own home," sophomore guard Candice Wiggins said." Iliey
were winning for pretty much the whole [last] game, and I
think they're probably just feeding off of that, it's going to a
battle, and we won't be surprised if they come out over-ag
gressive."
Arizona State (20-5, 11-4 Pac-iO) currently sits alone in
second place in the conference, 1.5 games behind the front
running Cardinal (18-5,12-2).The Sun Devils would be even
closer to the top if they had managed to keep a 12-point lead
in the first game at Stanford.The Cardinal,paced by 33 points
from Wiggins, came back to win, 84-78.
Stanford is currently trying to make sense of a 55-46 de
fensive slugfest at California this past Saturday. Though the
Cardinal got the victory and stifled any Cal attack, they strug
gled to a season-low in points and only shot 38.8 percent from
the field, down from their conference-leading 47 percent.
"Honestly, I thought our offense was horrific," coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "You know, I think sometimes you need to
hit rock bottom to come back up — and I think we hit rock
bottom."
But opponents are unconvinced by VanDerveer's hyper
bole.
"I don't think Stanford lost their ability to score," said Ari
zona State coach Charli Thrner Thorne, who ranked the game
a "9 or 10" on a l-to-10 scale of importance. "1 think they're
still a tremendous team that's very explosive and as their
record [shows], they're successful."
On the plus side for the Cardinal, a much-improved
Kristin Newlin will play tonight. The junior forward seems to
be fully recovered from a stress fracture suffered in Decem
ber. She was one board away from a double-double last Sat
urday (10 points,9 rebounds).
"[My play and my health are] getting better all the time."

Junior forward Brooke Smith skies toward the hoop in a 81 -47
blowout win over UCSB last Thursday. Smith's 57% shooting
leads the Card, and her 16.9 points per game ranks second.
Newlin said. "I feel like the same
things are expected of me now that
were before the injury, so 1 need to
play up to that level."
The Cardinal will count on Newl
in to help junior center Brooke
Smith close the rebounding gap.
Arizona State leads the league in re
bounding margin (+5.9), and the
team showed that last month
against the Cardinal, hauling in 41
boards to Stanford's 20.
"Rebounding has been our num
ber-one focus the entire year," Newl
in said. "We always look at the re
bounding stats after the game and try
to make adjustments every week in
practice."
Though the Sun Devils are known
mainly for their defense, the ASU at
tack has been efficient all year. Senior
forward Kristin Kovesdy currently
leads the conference in field goal per
centage (57.1 percent) and the team
has four players who average more
than eight points per game.
"You can't focus on one player,"
VanDerveer said. "Kovesdy is proba
bly their number-one option from the
low block, and then Westerberg.
[But] they've got a lot of offensive
weapons. You can't let anyone go
off."
The Cardinal will travel Saturday
to Arizona (7-18, 3-12), where they
will participate in an emotionally-in
tense Senior Day.
The Wildcats will not only honor
their graduating seniors, but also re
tire the number of Shawntinice Polk,
their former star center. After a
practice last September, Polk, 22,
died from complications following a
shoulder surgery. Polk's father, her
high school coach, the president of
the University of Arizona and Ari
zona Gov. Janet Napolitano all plan
on attending Saturday's game, ac
cording to Wildcats' head coach
Joan Bonvicini.
"1 think our team needs to be
aware of the significance of the game
for the Arizona team, and be sensi
tive to it, but also we need to be ready
to play," VanDerveer said.

than eight points per game.
"You can't focus on one player,"
VanDerveer said. "Kovesdy is proba
bly their number-one option from the
low block, and then Westerberg.
[But] they've got a lot of offensive
weapons. You can't let anyone go
off."
The Cardinal will travel Saturday
to Arizona (7-18, 3-12), where they
will participate in an emotionally-in
tense Senior Day.
The Wildcats will not only honor
their graduating seniors, but also re
tire the number of Shawntinice Polk,
their former star center. After a
practice last September, Polk, 22,
died from complications following a
shoulder surgery. Polk's father, her
high school coach, the president of
the University of Arizona and Ari
zona Gov. Janet Napolitano all plan
on attending Saturday's game, ac
cording to Wildcats' head coach
Joan Bonvicini.
"1 think our team needs to be
aware of the significance of the game
for the Arizona team, and be sensi
tive to it, but also we need to be ready
to play," VanDerveer said.
