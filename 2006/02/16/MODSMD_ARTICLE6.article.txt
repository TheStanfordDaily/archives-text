BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) —
New images showing Iraqis
abused by U.S. guards at Abu
Ghraib prison three years ago
threatened yesterday to enflame
public anger already running high
over footage of British soldiers
beating youths in southern Iraq.
Images of naked prisoners,
some bloodied and lying on the
floor, were taken about the same
time as earlier photos that trig
gered a worldwide scandal and
led to military trials and prison
sentences for several lower-rank
ing American soldiers.
Many of the pictures broad
cast Wednesday by Australia's
Special Broadcasting Service, in
cluding some that appear to show
corpses, were more graphic than
those previously published. One
of the video clips depicted a
group of naked men with bags
over their heads standing togeth
er and masturbating.The network
said they were forced to partici
pate.
Some key Iraqi officials urged
their countrymen to react calmly
since the pictures were old and
the offenders had been punished.
In the Middle East, where
there have been widespread anti-
Western protests recently over
caricatures of the Prophet
Muhammad, Al-Jazeera and Al-
Arabiya TV aired some of the
Australian station's footage but
refrained from using the most
shocking and sexually explicit im
ages. CNN also broadcast ex
cerpts.
Iraq's acting human rights
minister, Nermine Othman, said
she was "horrified" by the pic
tures and would study whether
any action could be taken
against those responsible, even
though some offenders have

been imprisoned.
"There will be two kinds of re
actions from Iraqis," she told The
Associated Press. "One will be
anger and others will feel sorry
that they (SBS) didn't give them
to the Iraqi government to inves
tigate. Why use them? Why show
them? We have had enough suf
fering and we don't want any
more."
Pentagon spokesman Bryan
Whitman said the Defense De
partment believed the release of
additional images of prisoner
abuse was harmful and "could
only further inflame and possibly
incite unnecessary violence in the
world."
Whitman said he did not know
whether the photos and video
clips were among images the Pen
tagon has been withholding from
public release since 2004.
But another defense official
said Army officials had reviewed
the photographs posted on the
Sydney Morning Herald's Web
site and matched them to images
that were among those turned
over to military authorities in
2004 by a U.S. soldier.
The official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity because
he was not authorized to address
the matter publicly, said the pho
tos contained no new information
about abuse.
Although the Abu Ghraib
case was exhaustively reported
here years ago, the new images
could revive the issue of treat
ment of Iraqis by U.S.-led occupa
tion forces, who face the ever
present threat of death or serious
injury at the hands of insurgents.
This week's release of video
showing British troops beating
Iraqi youths during a violent 2004
protest in the southern city of
Amarah prompted the Basra
provincial administration to se
vere ties with British authorities.
