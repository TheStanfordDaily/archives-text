WASHINGTON (AP) —Four U.S. high-tech
companies yesterday found themselves branded
collaborators with the Chinese government in
suppressing dissent in return for access to a boom
ing Internet market.
House members contended that Microsoft

Corp., Yahoo Inc., Cisco Systems Inc. and Google
Inc. sought to explain their business practices in
China only after a recent crush of negative media
and government attention.
"Your abhorrent actions in China are a dis
grace," said Rep.Tom Lantos, the top Democrat on
the House International Relations Committee. "I
simply don't understand how your corporate lead
ership sleeps at night."

Yahoo's senior vice president and general coun
sel, Michael Callahan, said his company was "very
distressed" at having to comply with Chinese law.
Elliot Schrage, vice president of global commu
nications and public affairs for Google, said
Google's decision to censor its Chinese Internet
search engine was "not something we did enthusi
astically or something we're proud of at a 11... We
have begun a path that we believe will ultimately
benefit our users in China."
Rep. Jim Leach, R-lowa,said Google seeming
ly had acted "as a functionary of the Chinese gov
ernment ...This is astonishing."
Analysts say U.S. high-tech companies trying to
tap a market of more than 110 million Internet
users also must worry about the perception they
are helping China harass dissidents.
To do business, U.S. companies must satisfy a
government in Beijing that fiercely polices Inter
net content. Policies include:
• Filters that block objectionable foreign Web
sites.
• Regulations banning what the Chinese con
sider subversive and pornographic content.
• Requiring Internet service providers to en
force government censorship.
Microsoft's associate general counsel. Jack
Krumholtz, said his company was committed to
staying in China because of the Internet's poten
tial for eventually allowing free access to informa
tion. "We think the benefits far outweigh the
downside, in terms of promoting freedom of ex
pression," he said.
Lantos, (D-Calif.), repeatedly asked whether
Yahoo had contacted the family of Chinese jour
nalist Shi Tao, who critics say Yahoo helped police
identify and convict after he criticized human
rights abuses in China.
Callahan said Yahoo condemned what happened
to Shi and had not contacted his family The business
executives appealed for guidance from Washington,
saying they faced the difficult decision of complying
with Chinese law or leaving the country.
