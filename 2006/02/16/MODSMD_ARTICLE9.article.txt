## Panel agrees 'No Child' inefficient Student groups host panel, attract large audience 
### JANET KIM 
Tackling different perspectives on edu
cation policy, panelists Linda Darling-
Hammond, Eric Ilanushek and Michael
Kirst managed a difficult feat — attracting
a large crowd to an unequivocally academ
ic talk.
"Educational Visions: Policies for Equi
ty and Effectiveness" a panel discussion
sponsored by Stanford in Government, the
Roosevelt Institution, Stanford Democrats
and College Republicans, drew an audi

ence of 90 to Tresidder Memorial Union's
Cypress Room last night.
According to freshman Matt Platkin, a
member of the Public Policy Forum for
Stanford in Government, event coordina
tors were surprised by the number of atten
dees.
"This pretty much blew away our expec
tations," Platkin said. "We organized a
panel in the fall on the Supreme Court, and
we didn't get nearly as big of a draw."
Moderated by Jon Dolly, a doctoral stu
dent in the philosophy of education pro
gram, the discussion ranged from distribut
ing monetary incentives for educational
improvement to improving English lan
guage education for non-native English

speakers. Dolly posed questions that the
organizers had prepared in advance.
Senior J.J. Ross, a SIG member, said the
questions were intended to prompt the ex
perts to speak on topics that are not highly
visible in print media.
"We wanted to ask questions that peo
ple really care about," he said. "Asking ex
perts about what policy they would like to
see implemented — this isn't something
that you can read about in The New York
Times."
While the panelists hailed from diverse
backgrounds and expressed equally diver
gent philosophies, they agreed on one thing
— that the "No Child Left Behind
Act" of 2(H) 1 is flawed and needs to
be changed. The stressed need to
modify standardized testing and the
teacher evaluation aspects of the act.
All three panelists felt that current
statues provided for an inefficient
evaluation of teachers.
"It's too lenient and too difficult
at once," said Darling-Hammond,
the Charles E. Ducommun Professor
of Education. "It makes a good case
for the federal government not being
the appropriate agency for [defining
teacher-evaluation standards]. If
you're in Montana, teaching in a one
room rural school house, you can't
possibly have a major in every single
field that you teach or pass subject
tests in everything you teach."
Hie panelists differed, however, in
their diagnoses of necessary change
— ranging from minimal shifting of
the current policy to radically re
forming the evaluative process. A sig
nificant portion of the discussion cen
tered on the latter issue.
Characterizing himself as an "un
abashed supporter" of'No Child Left
Behind,' Kirst, a professor of educa

tion and business administration, em
phasized the correlation between
performance on standardized tests
and income. "The skills that are
measured by such exams are critical
to improving the quality of the labor
market. Studies show that students
who score in the 85th percentiles of
tests make 12 times more money in
each year of their careers than stu
dents who score in the s()th per
centile."
While Kirst conceded that stan
dardized testing was not perfect, he
emphasized the need for fine-tuning
current tests rather than implement
ing a new method of assessing skills.
"We need to keep going and im
prove standards based reform," he
said. "We've made a fair amount of
progress in the past 10 years, but
more needs to be done."
Darling-Hammond said she was
less optimistic about the ability of
standardized tests to accurately
measure students' academic apti
tudes. She argued for performance
based assessments rather than annu
al multiple-choice tests, highlighting
the skills that the former mode of
testing encourages.
"Teaching to tests that are
thoughtful actually improves educa
tional quality," she said. "Reading
scores go up if reading is evaluated
through extended writing, as op

posed to multiple choice reading
tests. 'No Child Left Behind' pushes
states away from this kind of assess
ment. The policy places value on an
nual testing, and encourages states to
adopt multiple-choice testing be
cause it's cheaper and faster."
While Hanushek, a senior fellow
at the Hoover Institution, agreed
with Darling-Hammond that there
was a critical need to "measure out
comes better," he also believes that it
is necessary to make changes within
the framework of the current system.
"In the schools of Europe, Aus
tralia and most of the British com
monwealth, there are no multiple
choice tests. The tests ask for short
answers and long answers. I don't
know how we can test every kid
every year, and we have to come up
with some way to do this without let
ting accountability slip through the
nets, but performance testing has
proven successful in other coun
tries."
Hanushek's assessment that the
"No Child Left Behind Act" is "a sort
of good first draft" drew chuckles
from the audience, but also estab
lished his stance that the reliance on
national testing is here to say.
"The tests we have now are far
from perfect, but these low-grade
tests are the place to start,"
Hanushek said." We can diagnose the

most obviously failing students —
the people who do not have the very
basic skills — and the idea that we
start measuring there doesn't bother
me because we're going to increase
our standards up to the range of skills
we want in a competitive citizenry."
Audience members said the dis
cussion was enlivened by the civility
of the three panelists, who were each
responsive to the points made by the
other participants.
"I was surprised by how similar
the views of the panelists were on so
many of the issues, and how they
were all very reasonable," said Tama
rah Shuer, a senior majoring in polit
ical science."l found myself agreeing
with them a lot. It was great how they
were so educated, and had so many
interesting things to say."
Myosha MacAfee, a fourth-grade
teacher at San Jose East Side Ele
mentary, said she thought that the
discussion could have benefited from
an additional perspective, that of
teachers.
"It would be interesting to have
this kind of dialogue with actual
teachers from the classroom partici
pating," she said. "The space be
tween policymakers and practition
ers is huge, and I feel like a discus
sion between academics, policymak
ers and practitioners would be more
productive."

teacher at San Jose East Side Ele
mentary, said she thought that the
discussion could have benefited from
an additional perspective, that of
teachers.
"It would be interesting to have
this kind of dialogue with actual
teachers from the classroom partici
pating," she said. "The space be
tween policymakers and practition
ers is huge, and I feel like a discus
sion between academics, policymak
ers and practitioners would be more
productive."
Tackling different perspectives on edu
cation policy, panelists Linda Darling-
Hammond, Eric Ilanushek and Michael
Kirst managed a difficult feat — attracting
a large crowd to an unequivocally academ
ic talk.
"Educational Visions: Policies for Equi
ty and Effectiveness" a panel discussion
sponsored by Stanford in Government, the
Roosevelt Institution, Stanford Democrats
and College Republicans, drew an audi

ence of 90 to Tresidder Memorial Union's
Cypress Room last night.
According to freshman Matt Platkin, a
member of the Public Policy Forum for
Stanford in Government, event coordina
tors were surprised by the number of atten
dees.
"This pretty much blew away our expec
tations," Platkin said. "We organized a
panel in the fall on the Supreme Court, and
we didn't get nearly as big of a draw."
Moderated by Jon Dolly, a doctoral stu
dent in the philosophy of education pro
gram, the discussion ranged from distribut
ing monetary incentives for educational
improvement to improving English lan
guage education for non-native English

speakers. Dolly posed questions that the
organizers had prepared in advance.
Senior J.J. Ross, a SIG member, said the
questions were intended to prompt the ex
perts to speak on topics that are not highly
visible in print media.
"We wanted to ask questions that peo
ple really care about," he said. "Asking ex
perts about what policy they would like to
see implemented — this isn't something
that you can read about in The New York
Times."
While the panelists hailed from diverse
backgrounds and expressed equally diver
gent philosophies, they agreed on one thing
— that the "No Child Left Behind
Act" of 2(H) 1 is flawed and needs to
be changed. The stressed need to
modify standardized testing and the
teacher evaluation aspects of the act.
All three panelists felt that current
statues provided for an inefficient
evaluation of teachers.
"It's too lenient and too difficult
at once," said Darling-Hammond,
the Charles E. Ducommun Professor
of Education. "It makes a good case
for the federal government not being
the appropriate agency for [defining
teacher-evaluation standards]. If
you're in Montana, teaching in a one
room rural school house, you can't
possibly have a major in every single
field that you teach or pass subject
tests in everything you teach."
Hie panelists differed, however, in
their diagnoses of necessary change
— ranging from minimal shifting of
the current policy to radically re
forming the evaluative process. A sig
nificant portion of the discussion cen
tered on the latter issue.
Characterizing himself as an "un
abashed supporter" of'No Child Left
Behind,' Kirst, a professor of educa

tion and business administration, em
phasized the correlation between
performance on standardized tests
and income. "The skills that are
measured by such exams are critical
to improving the quality of the labor
market. Studies show that students
who score in the 85th percentiles of
tests make 12 times more money in
each year of their careers than stu
dents who score in the s()th per
centile."
While Kirst conceded that stan
dardized testing was not perfect, he
emphasized the need for fine-tuning
current tests rather than implement
ing a new method of assessing skills.
"We need to keep going and im
prove standards based reform," he
said. "We've made a fair amount of
progress in the past 10 years, but
more needs to be done."
Darling-Hammond said she was
less optimistic about the ability of
standardized tests to accurately
measure students' academic apti
tudes. She argued for performance
based assessments rather than annu
al multiple-choice tests, highlighting
the skills that the former mode of
testing encourages.
"Teaching to tests that are
thoughtful actually improves educa
tional quality," she said. "Reading
scores go up if reading is evaluated
through extended writing, as op

posed to multiple choice reading
tests. 'No Child Left Behind' pushes
states away from this kind of assess
ment. The policy places value on an
nual testing, and encourages states to
adopt multiple-choice testing be
cause it's cheaper and faster."
While Hanushek, a senior fellow
at the Hoover Institution, agreed
with Darling-Hammond that there
was a critical need to "measure out
comes better," he also believes that it
is necessary to make changes within
the framework of the current system.
"In the schools of Europe, Aus
tralia and most of the British com
monwealth, there are no multiple
choice tests. The tests ask for short
answers and long answers. I don't
know how we can test every kid
every year, and we have to come up
with some way to do this without let
ting accountability slip through the
nets, but performance testing has
proven successful in other coun
tries."
Hanushek's assessment that the
"No Child Left Behind Act" is "a sort
of good first draft" drew chuckles
from the audience, but also estab
lished his stance that the reliance on
national testing is here to say.
"The tests we have now are far
from perfect, but these low-grade
tests are the place to start,"
Hanushek said." We can diagnose the

most obviously failing students —
the people who do not have the very
basic skills — and the idea that we
start measuring there doesn't bother
me because we're going to increase
our standards up to the range of skills
we want in a competitive citizenry."
Audience members said the dis
cussion was enlivened by the civility
of the three panelists, who were each
responsive to the points made by the
other participants.
"I was surprised by how similar
the views of the panelists were on so
many of the issues, and how they
were all very reasonable," said Tama
rah Shuer, a senior majoring in polit
ical science."l found myself agreeing
with them a lot. It was great how they
were so educated, and had so many
interesting things to say."
Myosha MacAfee, a fourth-grade
teacher at San Jose East Side Ele
mentary, said she thought that the
