The unassuming appearance of
this small Korean restaurant
might cause you to pass it by
without much thought.That would be
a mistake! Walk inside Totoro, and
you'll discover that despite its func
tional, bare bones decor, the restau
rant is imbued with a wonderfully
friendly and surprisingly cozy feel.
Totoro's atmosphere lives up to
the restaurant's namesake, a good
natured Japanese animated charac
ter that looks like a giant
wombat/rabbit and takes children
on magical adventures — yes, the
restaurant feels that happy inside!
Totoro's comfortable atmosphere
was enhanced by its very helpful and
welcoming server, who readily of
fered suggestions for my meal.
After looking over the menu, which
displays pictures of all of the dinner
items next to their descriptions, 1 de
cided on "bi bim bob" ($7.95), a
healthy dish that consists of separat
ed sections of bean sprouts, egg, shi
itake mushrooms, iceberg lettuce,
and spinach served over rice. The
waitress let me know that I could
choose marinated chicken or beef to
top the plate off, and I gladly chose
to add chicken to mine.
From the looks of the food being
enjoyed at neighboring tables, you
can probably go right with a lot of the
menu items at Totoro. Other dishes,
most of which cost $8.95, include tofu
hot pots, noodle soups, and meat and
seafood dishes served over rice.
Many customers ate a soup that
comes with a raw egg that you crack
into the steaming broth to cook.
As I sat with my complementary
green tea waiting for my meal to
come and observing my contented
fellow customers eat their tasty
looking food, I felt completely at
home in my prefab red plastic chair.
The food arrived very quickly. A
plate of kimchi, bean sprouts mari
nated with sesame oil, and ab
solutely delicious daichon accom
panied the meal. A bottle of To
toro's spicy and sweet chili sesame
sauce also showed up at the table.
The simple, wholesome bi bim bob
hit the spot! It's the kind of dish
that you feel good after eating. The
cheery mood that pervaded my en
tire meal carried through to the end
when a piece of melon gum sat atop
my check.
Totoro's good food and happy
mood made for a great meal. If
you're ever craving Korean food, or
if you're yet to give Korean food a
try and decide it's time you did, head
over to this modest, amiable spot!
