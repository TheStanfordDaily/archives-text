# Get your fresh air fix: five local day hikes
## 
### JENNY BAER DESK EDITOR 
Feel like cold weather and long
pre-midterm library sessions haven't
given you enough chance to get some
fresh air? Why not take some time
off and convene with nature. Al
though the closest many students
come to a day hike is a stroll around
Lake Lag, Stanford is surrounded
with scenic California parks that wel
come the public.
Rancho San Antonio Preserve
This preserve is about a 20 minute
drive from campus and offers hiking
trails for a wide variety of skill (or ef
fort) levels. This preserve is also fa
vored by both joggers, as it's pretty
easy to stay on flat terrain. There are
two climaxes to a hike at Rancho: the

animal farm on your way into the
park and the vista point at the top.
The farm is a fun place for animal (or
people) watching and is about half a
mile from the parking lot so it's not
incredibly crowded. There is an array
of vista points during and at the end
of the hike that are perfect for a pic
nic lunch.
Shoreline Park
Located near Moffet Field mili
tary base in Mountain View, Shore
line is a great place for hiking, biking
and other outdoor activities. A set of
dirt trails surround the marshy San
Francisco Bay run-off so that you are
constantly next to the water. Despite
the Bay's earthy aroma, it's a nice
cool place and usually pretty windy
so that you don't get overheated on
your walk or jog. The park is also

home to a lake with paddleboat and
sailboat rentals available as well as
paved trails ideal for rollerblading.
The grassy knolls and willow trees
surrounding the lake also serve as
wonderful picnic spots before or
after your walk.
Windv Hill
Off of Portola Road in Portola
Valley, the 7.2-mile loop makes a
great afternoon trek. There are two
main trails to chose from, one fairly
flat one with an elevation of just 6(H)
feet and the Skyline Boulevard Trail
head with an elevation of about 1 S(K)
feet. Winter is a great time to hike
Windy Hill because it's seasonally
closed to equestrians and cyclists.
"The view at the top of the hill was
beautiful," according to sophomore
Emily Aliegrotti."! liked Windy Hill,

but I didn't really like how close it
was and how I didn't feel like I had re
ally gone anywhere new or exciting."'
Across Alpine Road from Windy
Hill there lies lesser known trails,one
of which is Toyon Trail. These paths
are "not as steep as Windy Hill, but a
lot more green and foresty." said to
sophomore Michael McCourt.
Arastradero Preserve
For those who don't mind staying
close to campus, Arastradero is locat
ed just across interstate 280 from
campus and offers an array of trails
for biking, hiking and horseback rid
ing. TYails along Arastradero feature
a quaint stream and pond. While the
views may not be as dramatic as
those on other hikes in the area, it's
easy to get to for a quick break.
This preserve is located just about

15 minutes west along Page
Mill Road and is known for

its exceptional spring wildflow
ers. A popular hike is the 3.6-
mile loop through grassy hills
and oak trees.
Russian Ridge has beauti
ful views and several loop
trails that overlook the bay
area," said sophomore Bill
Anderegg. "At some times of
years, the wildflowers are re

ally in bloom, especially

the California state

flower â€” the Cal

ifornia poppy "
