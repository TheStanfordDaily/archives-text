## Editorial Intelligent debate of intelligent design 
### 
F. Scott Fitzgerald once said, "The test of
a first-rate intelligence is the ability to
hold two opposing ideas in the mind at
the same time and still retain the ability to
function." As the debate over teaching intel
ligent design rages across America in schools
and churches, each and every one of us as
Stanford students must rise to this challenge.
The idea of bringing God into classrooms
and curricula has been around long enough
to elicit strong support on both sides. In
1987. the historical Edwards vs. Aguillard
Louisiana case decided that the teaching of
creationism — or the belief that life was cre
ated by a supreme being's supernatural in
tervention — in public schools had the pri
mary purpose of a particular religious belief
and was therefore unconstitutional.
Recently, the argument for teaching intel
ligent design—frequently compared to cre
ationism—has surfaced, begging the ques
tion whether or not it should be taught
alongside or in place of evolution. Last year.
President George W. Bush received both
criticism and acclaim for stating his belief
that intelligent design should be taught in
tandem with evolution as "competing theo
ries."
According to The New York Times, the
widely accepted definition of intelligent de
sign is the belief that life is too complex to be
explained by evolution alone. This leaves
room for educators to introduce the idea
that human beings were created by an "intel
ligent designer," usually interpreted to be a
deity.
At the same time, proponents of intelli
gent design are finding it more difficult than
expected to sell their version of science. An
attempt to mandate the teaching of intelli
gent design in Indiana rapidly scaled down
to a bill requiring "accuracy in textbooks,"

while policymakers in Wisconsin proposed a
novel ban on teaching intelligent design as a
science just last week.
The discussions on intelligent design tak
ing place all over the country is a discussion
that we need to have amongst ourselves on
campus right now. While some may think
that this debate is and should remain in the
realm of theory, it has many real implications
for us Stanford students, who walk the fine
line between scientific skepticism and faith.
We attend a research institution that un
derstands the importance of scientific ques
tioning and taking nothing for granted. We
value the teaching of science and scientific
methods, which are at odds with intelligent
design. At the same time, we are members of
a community that strongly encourages us to
believe in whatever it is that brings us peace
of mind, a community that has made its
church a symbolic centerpiece of its campus
and stands strongly behind the right to em
brace freedom of religion.
Is there a middle ground? How do we
reconcile the differences between science
and faith? Do we compromise the standards
of science by teaching intelligent design
along with evolution or even in place of it?
Are we rejecting or accepting the notion of
intelligent design based on our own person
al religious beliefs, and is that legitimate?
The bottom line is that even in our insular
Bubble, we are not far removed from this
issue. We cannot even escape from it. as it
ties together the key symbols of church and
school that characterize Stanford as much as
any other community.
It is time to have a thoughtful debate in
class, out on the Quad, over coffee and while
biking. Let us question each other,challenge
each other and learn to disagree openly, vo
cally and honestly.
