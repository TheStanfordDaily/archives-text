# Ash in the Snow

I figured it would be a hit of an adjust
ment coming to Berlin. I'm a Califor
nia boy. I'm used to winter being the
partially-cloudy-with-light-change-of
semi-rain period awkwardly lodged be
tween the falling leaves and hopeful ener
gy of Fall (this year — THIS YEAR — 111
make it happen) and the lazy sunburnt
broken dreams of Spring (whatever, man.
puff puff pass). I've lived in the big city be
fore— a six week stint at NYU here, a
glamorous slave-labor Hollywood intern
ship there — but Manhattan was expen
sive, claustrophobic and dank, and LA is
less a city than a sprawling conglomera
tion of freeways and racial tension, not so
much "metropolitan"' as "soul-devour
ing." And I've spent seven Stanford quar
ters rolling (sometimes falling) out of bed
five minutes after class starts and showing
up in pajamas and flip-flops; what the hell
do I know about public transportation, I
can't even figure out the Marguerite.
I've been here just over a month now,
hopping for the U-bahn to the S-bahn.
spending long nights and early mornings
at trashy bars and East Berlin clubs (the
first week my friends took me to a club
called " Rosis" — picture the bastard child
of "Requiem for a Dream" and "Sin City"
listening to German death-metal and
building a home for heroin addicts who
like loud 80s music), eating Doner kebabs
and cheap German pizza four times a day,
showing up to German 1Z every morning
with my ears ringing and my head pound
ing, half-asleep, hung over, happy as a
clam. Berlin is a hell of a town, and I don't
want it to sound like the only good thing
about studying abroad here is trendy,
latenight Euro debauchery. But it's pretty
damn fun.
I love Stanford, but I needed a change.
Our glorious campus can get a little bor
ing after the freshmen dorm Summer
Camp ends. San Francisco is a long way
away. Palo Alto is fit only for high school
ers with fake IDs. Silicon Valley yuppies
who think Cheesecake Factory is chic
and seniors going to Pub Night — the
weekly University-sponsored I HUM
section reunion.
