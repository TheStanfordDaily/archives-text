I figured it would be a hit of an adjust
ment coming to Berlin. I'm a Califor
nia boy. I'm used to winter being the
partially-cloudy-with-light-change-of
semi-rain period awkwardly lodged be
tween the falling leaves and hopeful ener
gy of Fall (this year — THIS YEAR — 111
make it happen) and the lazy sunburnt
broken dreams of Spring (whatever, man.
puff puff pass). I've lived in the big city be
fore— a six week stint at NYU here, a
glamorous slave-labor Hollywood intern
ship there — but Manhattan was expen
sive, claustrophobic and dank, and LA is
less a city than a sprawling conglomera
tion of freeways and racial tension, not so
much "metropolitan"' as "soul-devour
ing." And I've spent seven Stanford quar
ters rolling (sometimes falling) out of bed
five minutes after class starts and showing
up in pajamas and flip-flops; what the hell
do I know about public transportation, I
can't even figure out the Marguerite.
I've been here just over a month now,
hopping for the U-bahn to the S-bahn.
spending long nights and early mornings
at trashy bars and East Berlin clubs (the
first week my friends took me to a club
called " Rosis" — picture the bastard child
of "Requiem for a Dream" and "Sin City"
listening to German death-metal and
building a home for heroin addicts who
like loud 80s music), eating Doner kebabs
and cheap German pizza four times a day,
showing up to German 1Z every morning
with my ears ringing and my head pound
ing, half-asleep, hung over, happy as a
clam. Berlin is a hell of a town, and I don't
want it to sound like the only good thing
about studying abroad here is trendy,
latenight Euro debauchery. But it's pretty
damn fun.
I love Stanford, but I needed a change.
Our glorious campus can get a little bor
ing after the freshmen dorm Summer
Camp ends. San Francisco is a long way
away. Palo Alto is fit only for high school
ers with fake IDs. Silicon Valley yuppies
who think Cheesecake Factory is chic
and seniors going to Pub Night — the
weekly University-sponsored I HUM

Eins! Swei! Drei!
The Row House scene has de
graded exponentially over the last
few years. Did they actually shut
down Happy Hour last quarter just
because EBF left some flammable
materials lying around? That's like
convicting A 1 Capone for tax eva
sion. (Of course, then the fuzz came
up with a "Scarface"-style ski-trip
cocaine bust — why is it that all the
interesting stuff only happens when
I'm gone?)
1 was living in Jerry last year,
when it was Lambda Nu — there
was a reunion in late Fall of the peo
ple who lived there in the 19705.
They told us stories about when they
were known as the "Lambda Nud
ies" because they'd suntan next to
beautiful, blue Lake Lag; they were
growing illegal, wonderful sub
stances on the roof and lived the sort
of lifestyle Synergy yearns desper
ately to barely parody. 1 love Stan
ford. but those days are long gone.
Berlin is different. Hell, any study
abroad program has its party-hearty
positives — Oxford's got the pub

crawl. Beijing's got the sex trade,
Paris has race riots and Berlin is just
weird in the best Hunter S. Thomp
son sense. Want to mosh violently to
Russian folktronica? Spend a day at
the biggest Food Festival in the
world, acting like you might buy
some bottles of the really expensive
South African red wine you've "tast
ed" half empty? Suddenly discover
an absinthe bar (named, appropri
ately, "Absinthe Bar"), with 60-some
flavors and a cute high-school clien
tele? And then there are the Ger
mans themselves, their musical taste
trapped somewhere between the
mid-1980s and modern Hip-Hop
(which they call "Blackmusik"), the
guys stubbornly certain that their eu
rohawk and plucked eyebrows are
totally badass.
I could go on, but 1 need to get
ready for a lavish suit-and-tie dinner
paid for by Elizabeth Hurley's
baby's grandparents (Google "Steve
Bing" immediately), get packed for
the weekend field trip to Istanbul,
figure out how many movies I'm see
ing at the Berlin Film Festival tomor
row (averaging four per day) and
then maybe even study a little bit for
the German quiz this Friday. (I've
taken lots of languages, always
Pass/Fail, and there's nothing better

than coarse, guttural German — it
rolls of the tongue with the ballet
like grace of a Panzer tank). This col
umn will be about a lot of things —
the kids in my program, a motley
crew of hardcore Engineers and soft
core Film fuzzies, not-so-Innocents
Abroad; my oft-fault and hopefully
controversial impressions of the city,
its people and the ridiculous multi
tude of things to do here; epic mini
narratives of nights on the town that
would make a lesser columnist worry
that his mom reads the Daily (I con
sidered using the pen name "David
Herbert," but it was taken); but
above all, it's about the simple pleas
ures, like two-euro coins, rigorously
on-time buses, "The Simpsons" with
baaad dubbing and the German
sense of humor (flatulence and more
flatulence).
When it comes to pure bad be
havior. youth-in-revolt, Old-World
kicks, nothing beats smoking a ciga
rette on the second-floor porch of
the palatial Stanford-in-Berlin cen
ter. What's more beautiful and
trashily decadent, Lost-Generation
style than freshly puffed ash on new
fallen snow?

Eins! Swei! Drei!
The Row House scene has de
graded exponentially over the last
few years. Did they actually shut
down Happy Hour last quarter just
because EBF left some flammable
materials lying around? That's like
convicting A 1 Capone for tax eva
sion. (Of course, then the fuzz came
up with a "Scarface"-style ski-trip
cocaine bust — why is it that all the
interesting stuff only happens when
I'm gone?)
1 was living in Jerry last year,
when it was Lambda Nu — there
was a reunion in late Fall of the peo
ple who lived there in the 19705.
They told us stories about when they
were known as the "Lambda Nud
ies" because they'd suntan next to
beautiful, blue Lake Lag; they were
growing illegal, wonderful sub
stances on the roof and lived the sort
of lifestyle Synergy yearns desper
ately to barely parody. 1 love Stan
ford. but those days are long gone.
Berlin is different. Hell, any study
abroad program has its party-hearty
positives — Oxford's got the pub

crawl. Beijing's got the sex trade,
Paris has race riots and Berlin is just
weird in the best Hunter S. Thomp
son sense. Want to mosh violently to
Russian folktronica? Spend a day at
the biggest Food Festival in the
world, acting like you might buy
some bottles of the really expensive
South African red wine you've "tast
ed" half empty? Suddenly discover
an absinthe bar (named, appropri
ately, "Absinthe Bar"), with 60-some
flavors and a cute high-school clien
tele? And then there are the Ger
mans themselves, their musical taste
trapped somewhere between the
mid-1980s and modern Hip-Hop
(which they call "Blackmusik"), the
guys stubbornly certain that their eu
rohawk and plucked eyebrows are
totally badass.
I could go on, but 1 need to get
ready for a lavish suit-and-tie dinner
paid for by Elizabeth Hurley's
baby's grandparents (Google "Steve
Bing" immediately), get packed for
the weekend field trip to Istanbul,
figure out how many movies I'm see
ing at the Berlin Film Festival tomor
row (averaging four per day) and
then maybe even study a little bit for
the German quiz this Friday. (I've
taken lots of languages, always
Pass/Fail, and there's nothing better

than coarse, guttural German — it
rolls of the tongue with the ballet
like grace of a Panzer tank). This col
umn will be about a lot of things —
the kids in my program, a motley
crew of hardcore Engineers and soft
core Film fuzzies, not-so-Innocents
Abroad; my oft-fault and hopefully
controversial impressions of the city,
its people and the ridiculous multi
tude of things to do here; epic mini
narratives of nights on the town that
would make a lesser columnist worry
that his mom reads the Daily (I con
sidered using the pen name "David
Herbert," but it was taken); but
above all, it's about the simple pleas
ures, like two-euro coins, rigorously
on-time buses, "The Simpsons" with
baaad dubbing and the German
sense of humor (flatulence and more
flatulence).
When it comes to pure bad be
havior. youth-in-revolt, Old-World
kicks, nothing beats smoking a ciga
rette on the second-floor porch of
the palatial Stanford-in-Berlin cen
ter. What's more beautiful and
trashily decadent, Lost-Generation
style than freshly puffed ash on new
fallen snow?

I figured it would be a hit of an adjust
ment coming to Berlin. I'm a Califor
nia boy. I'm used to winter being the
partially-cloudy-with-light-change-of
semi-rain period awkwardly lodged be
tween the falling leaves and hopeful ener
gy of Fall (this year — THIS YEAR — 111
make it happen) and the lazy sunburnt
broken dreams of Spring (whatever, man.
puff puff pass). I've lived in the big city be
fore— a six week stint at NYU here, a
glamorous slave-labor Hollywood intern
ship there — but Manhattan was expen
sive, claustrophobic and dank, and LA is
less a city than a sprawling conglomera
tion of freeways and racial tension, not so
much "metropolitan"' as "soul-devour
ing." And I've spent seven Stanford quar
ters rolling (sometimes falling) out of bed
five minutes after class starts and showing
up in pajamas and flip-flops; what the hell
do I know about public transportation, I
can't even figure out the Marguerite.
I've been here just over a month now,
hopping for the U-bahn to the S-bahn.
spending long nights and early mornings
at trashy bars and East Berlin clubs (the
first week my friends took me to a club
called " Rosis" — picture the bastard child
of "Requiem for a Dream" and "Sin City"
listening to German death-metal and
building a home for heroin addicts who
like loud 80s music), eating Doner kebabs
and cheap German pizza four times a day,
showing up to German 1Z every morning
with my ears ringing and my head pound
ing, half-asleep, hung over, happy as a
clam. Berlin is a hell of a town, and I don't
want it to sound like the only good thing
about studying abroad here is trendy,
latenight Euro debauchery. But it's pretty
damn fun.
