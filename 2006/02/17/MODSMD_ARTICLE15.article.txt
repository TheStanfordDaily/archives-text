# There are no fish in the sea
## 
### 
The problem with the mundane repeti
tiveness of a cliche is often not that it is
obvious, but rather that it is rarely true.
One in the hand is seldom worth two in
the bush. Life is. in fact, perfectly fair. And,
there are not plenty more fish in the sea.
Needless to say, my casual disapproval of
cliche is in no way an apology for any previous
transgressions, and is also not going to prevent
me from using them again. Now, having got
the disclaimer out of the way, on to business.
Although we're drifting towards the end
of the most romantic week of the year, 1 feel
I'd be going against the spirit of absurdly
repetitive student column writing if 1 didn't
jump on the "complain about Valentine's
Day" bandwagon.
On the other hand, complaining about
Valentine's Day is easy. It's a cheap thrill
with so many open targets that even the vice
president would have trouble missing.
No, I think we should aim a little higher
than Hallmark or roses or hand-holding or
even a la carte a cappella. Why bother with
details when we can take a swipe at the rot
ting carcass of young(ish) love itself?
As you may have gathered from your
weekly perusals of my work (I live in hope),
it's hard to date in graduate school.
The over-powering (and constant) need
to work is the most obvious stumbling block
for any would be Casanova. However, let us
not forgot the damping of ardor by the drea
ry misery of Escondido Village and its envi
rons. Or for that matter, the quenching ef
fects of groups of stray electrical engineers.
On top of all of this, one also has to over

come the lack of esteem (both self and oth
erwise) that seems to be an essential part of
the Stanford graduate school experience.
Even if you manage to get past all of the
above, you're still left with a troublesome
number problem. The on-campus male/fe
male ratio is something like 65% to 35%, a
number that gets even worse when you re
move the somewhat more balanced profes
sional schools from the mix (which we do
since they don't really speak to the rest of us).
All of this brings us neatly (well, sort of
anyway) back to the noble art of cliche.
When lamenting the fact that (another)
Valentine's Day was spent in the company of
a fascinating paper on the "Features of de
Sitter Vacua in M-Theory" it's easy to fall
into the trap of cautious optimism.
After all. you're smart, witty and you
have all your teeth, of course there's some
one out there for you. There are, after all,
plenty of fish in the proverbial sea.
The problem is, though, that all the fish
have either been dynamited out of the water
or killed off by mercury poisoning. And thus

the sea itself is a sad and lonely place
bereft of even a Sharky or a George.
The fish/sea meme is also brought
out whenever someone suffers the
fizzle-out of an abortive romance,
supposedly as reassurance that all is
not lost. Don't kid yourself; all is lost.
Well, that is. I suppose, not exact
ly true. It's not so much that all is lost.

but rather that "all" are mostly either
very far away or not that interested.
Actually the most striking evi
dence for the empty sea phenome
non is the infrequency of dating. If
your lab mate's first attempt at ro
mance in six months has gone south,
it's not that likely that another will
present itself anytime soon.
Personally I don't see any of this
as a great problem. While this is part
ly because my devastating good
looks and indescribable charm make
me irresistible, I also have to confess
that I quite enjoy hanging out in a

barren, soulless desert.
You see, although graduate
school may be less than bubbling
with passion, the overpowering cer
tainty of failure is far less depressing
when you have the perfect excuse at
hand.

Two competitions for you this week,
dear reader. Email
navins@stanford.edu if you a) figured
out the Sharky and George reference
or h) have counted the number of
cliches used above. Prizes galore are
on offer.
