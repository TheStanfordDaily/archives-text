# Write a freshman column
## 
### 
As a debut columnist, it seemed natural
to start my tenure by mocking others.
A fleeting moment of nostalgia re
minded me that one of my favorite things to
do as a freshman was mock the freshman
columnists. This was largely because 1 was not
selected to be a freshman columnist. Still,
freshman writers are perversely intriguing,
just like freeway pileups and genital piercings.
If you are like me and were denied the oppor
tunity to have your freshman naivete publicly
mocked and enshrined forever in newsprint,
never fret — below is a guide to how to write
your very own freshman column.
And yes. all quotations are from real fresh
man columns printed in The Stanford Daily.
Step No. 1: Choose an engaging first sen
tence. Zero in on something that's quirky
and quintessentially "college," like beer or
furtive masturbation in the shower. One ex
ample: "It is not uncommon to see Stanford
students walk around campus with shirts or
caps that proclaim 'Cal Sucks' or' Beat Cal."'
We can immediately relate: I, too, have
seen someone wearing a "Cal Sucks" shirt or
cap! The reader is instantly engaged.
Step No. 2: Hone in on your Big Idea. Let
your incisive eye rove across the Stanford
campus. Dining hall food? "It gets old after
awhile." The Facebook? "I won't lie; I'm just
as guilty of Facebook-procrastination as the
next person." The more obvious the better.
Who needs nuance? We're too tired to deci
pher complex arguments over a bowl of
Raisin Bran at nine o'clock in the morning.

Step No. 3: Tie your Big Idea into something
you're studying in an introductory humani
ties class. Simply knowing that you go to
Stanford isn't enough for us to realize that
you're Smart, capital S. Rehash your 1-Hum
prof's rhetorical verbosity in support of your
argument. If it doesn't really fit your argu
ment. no matter: just use big words. The lofti
er the language, the better. "They put such
topics as the correspondence theory of truth,
Zeno's paradox and epistemological chance
in language that even Jumpers could under
stand." I'll bet they did!
Step No. 4: Mention alcohol and (rat parties.
Even if you don't participate. In fact, espe
cially if you don't participate — flout your
moral superiority! "1 went to my first frat
party this weekend. I feel like I've just dis
covered an alien culture." If you're a teeto
taler, there's no reason to hide it — write a
column about it! "If you've never been part
of the sober minority in a room full of intoxi
cated freshmen, you are missing out on an in
teresting time." Get me to Wilbur!
