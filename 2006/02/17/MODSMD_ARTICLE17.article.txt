## Stanford protects animal rights 
### LINDA CORK 
Matthew Liebman's opinion
piece on animal research is
misleading and distorts the
facts. On Jan. 21,2005, he and Claire
Wagenseil spent more than two
hours with me and the Attending
Veterinarian for Stanford, toured
Stanford's animal facility and
learned in detail the way Stanford
and its Animal Care and Use Com
mittee and veterinarians work to
protect animals in research, includ
ing rats, mice and birds. It now ap
pears that Liebman's goal during the
meeting and tour was to promote his
own slant rather than present a fair
and objective view of animal re
search at Stanford.
Contrary to Liebman's claims that
regulations do not restrict actual ex
periments, the Animal Care and Use

Committee at an institution reviews
all uses of animals whether it is for
teaching or research. This review oc
curs before animals can be purchased
and is designed to insure animal wel
fare. Scientists who want to use re
search animals must describe in de
tail the purpose of the research; the
value of the research; why animals
must be used; and how the number of
animals to be used was determined.
In addition, they must describe in
detail all their procedures involving
animals. If these procedures might
cause the animals to experience more
than momentary pain or distress, they
are required to provide anesthetic or
analgesic drugs to alleviate the dis
comfort, or explain why these drugs
or other treatments cannot be used to
fully relieve it. In case of the latter, the
investigator will perform a literature
search to document why pain and dis

tress could not be avoided.
More importantly, a scientist can
not simply claim "scientific necessi
ty" to avoid the use of anesthetics or
analgesics as Liebman claims, but this
must be proven to a skeptical group
of scientists, veterinarians and non
scientists. The examples of "re
search" he gives are not credible.
Although the Animal Welfare Act
excludes rats, mice and birds, the
other federal agencies do not exclude
these animals. Institutions that re
ceive funds from federal agencies
must file an assurance with the feder
al government that they will abide by
the Guide for the Care and Use of
Animals and other federal regula
tions. The guide has the force of law
and spells out in detail the animal
housing, sanitation, caging, veteri
