## Stanford protects animal rights 
### LINDA CORK 
Matthew Liebman's opinion
piece on animal research is
misleading and distorts the
facts. On Jan. 21,2005, he and Claire
Wagenseil spent more than two
hours with me and the Attending
Veterinarian for Stanford, toured
Stanford's animal facility and
learned in detail the way Stanford
and its Animal Care and Use Com
mittee and veterinarians work to
protect animals in research, includ
ing rats, mice and birds. It now ap
pears that Liebman's goal during the
meeting and tour was to promote his
own slant rather than present a fair
and objective view of animal re
search at Stanford.
Contrary to Liebman's claims that
regulations do not restrict actual ex
periments, the Animal Care and Use

Committee at an institution reviews
all uses of animals whether it is for
teaching or research. This review oc
curs before animals can be purchased
and is designed to insure animal wel
fare. Scientists who want to use re
search animals must describe in de
tail the purpose of the research; the
value of the research; why animals
must be used; and how the number of
animals to be used was determined.
In addition, they must describe in
detail all their procedures involving
animals. If these procedures might
cause the animals to experience more
than momentary pain or distress, they
are required to provide anesthetic or
analgesic drugs to alleviate the dis
comfort, or explain why these drugs
or other treatments cannot be used to
fully relieve it. In case of the latter, the
investigator will perform a literature
search to document why pain and dis

tress could not be avoided.
More importantly, a scientist can
not simply claim "scientific necessi
ty" to avoid the use of anesthetics or
analgesics as Liebman claims, but this
must be proven to a skeptical group
of scientists, veterinarians and non
scientists. The examples of "re
search" he gives are not credible.
Although the Animal Welfare Act
excludes rats, mice and birds, the
other federal agencies do not exclude
these animals. Institutions that re
ceive funds from federal agencies
must file an assurance with the feder
al government that they will abide by
the Guide for the Care and Use of
Animals and other federal regula
tions. The guide has the force of law
and spells out in detail the animal
housing, sanitation, caging, veteri
nary care, etc. that laboratory ani
mals must receive. Contrary to what
Liebman says, the Guide includes all
vertebrate species, including mice,
rats, birds, frogs, etc.
The United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA) is responsible
for administering the regulations in
the Animal Welfare Act and its revi
sions. USDA inspectors make unan
nounced inspections. During these
visits, they review the animal care
committee's work and visit all facili
ties where USDA-regulated species
are held to actually see these animals
and how they are being housed and
treated.They also conduct a detailed
audit of records to insure that what
the scientist tells the animal care
committee will be done is actually
taking place. USDA inspectors are
thorough, and the department can
fine institutions that fail to comply.
Unfortunately, the USDA has a
limited number of categories for
defining non-compliance, and these
can be misleading—as was explained
to Liebman during his visit.They also
have no mechanisms for reporting or
documenting the good work that is
done to protect and insure the well
being of the animals. The USDA in
spection reports and the records of
the numbers of animals "used" at
Stanford are available on the USDA
Web site. It is not a secret.
The Association for the Assess
ment and Accreditation of Labora
tory Animal Care (AAALAC) is a
voluntary organization that uses the
guide as its yardstick for evaluating
the processes an institution uses to
ensure quality laboratory animal
care. Stanford is proud to have been
AAALAC-accredited since 1988.
AAALAC's site visitors receive a
description of the animal care pro
gram before they arrive; Stanford's
AAALAC document is more than
2(X) pages in length. While at Stan
ford, site visitors — including expe
rienced scientists and veterinarians
— inspect how the animal care com
mittee reviews animal protocols.
They observe how facilities are
maintained, visit all the animal facil
ities and check all records ranging
from the way clinical cases are man
aged to whether the temperature at
which cages are washed is appropri
ate. Although the AAALAC site vis

its are planned ahead of time, these
visitors know how things are sup
posed to be managed and where to
look for problems. Accordingly, hid
ing problems would not be as easy as
Liebman implies. Stanford Universi
ty is proud to be A AALAC accredit
ed because it is considered the
"Good Housekeeping Seal" of qual
ity animal care.
Stanford has an excellent history
of compliance. Federal animal wel
fare laws and regulations require an
institution to self-report problems it
discovers. Failure to "self-report" is a
violation. Stanford takes the initia
tive to self-report issues that arise; it
does not try to hide problems from
regulatory agencies. Yet, Liebman
points to Stanford's compliance with
this reporting requirement as evi
dence that it is noncompliant. On the
contrary, it proves that Stanford takes
its responsibility seriously, notifies
federal officials promptly and investi
gates concerns about animal welfare.
Liebman opposes the use of ani
mals in research —that is his privi
lege. But animal research enables
millions of human beings to live
healthier, more comfortable lives.
Animal research led to treatments
for diabetes, for vaccines for polio,
measles, hepatitis, meningitis, pneu
monia and other infectious diseases.
At Stanford, the late Dr. Norman
Shumway used dogs to develop the
techniques to transplant hearts and
prevent immunologic rejection of
transplanted organs. The list of ac
complishments of animal research is
extensive and has resulted in many
Nobel prizes, both for understanding
basic biologic processes and also for
developing treatments for diseases.
Rejecting animal research means
that we also reject learning how bod
ies function in health and disease,
and it rejects developing treatments
for AIDS, Alzheimer's disease,
Parkinson's disease, SARS, influen
za and a host of other yet-to-be dis
covered diseases. 1 don't believe that
is what most human beings want for
themselves or their families. Lieb
man knowingly misrepresented the
animal care program at Stanford and
nationally. Animal research at Stan
ford is carried out humanely with
concern for the animals' welfare and
for science of the highest quality.

points to Stanford's compliance with
this reporting requirement as evi
dence that it is noncompliant. On the
contrary, it proves that Stanford takes
its responsibility seriously, notifies
federal officials promptly and investi
gates concerns about animal welfare.
Liebman opposes the use of ani
mals in research —that is his privi
lege. But animal research enables
millions of human beings to live
healthier, more comfortable lives.
Animal research led to treatments
for diabetes, for vaccines for polio,
measles, hepatitis, meningitis, pneu
monia and other infectious diseases.
At Stanford, the late Dr. Norman
Shumway used dogs to develop the
techniques to transplant hearts and
prevent immunologic rejection of
transplanted organs. The list of ac
complishments of animal research is
extensive and has resulted in many
Nobel prizes, both for understanding
basic biologic processes and also for
developing treatments for diseases.
Rejecting animal research means
that we also reject learning how bod
ies function in health and disease,
and it rejects developing treatments
for AIDS, Alzheimer's disease,
Parkinson's disease, SARS, influen
za and a host of other yet-to-be dis
covered diseases. 1 don't believe that
is what most human beings want for
themselves or their families. Lieb
man knowingly misrepresented the
animal care program at Stanford and
nationally. Animal research at Stan
ford is carried out humanely with
concern for the animals' welfare and
for science of the highest quality.

Matthew Liebman's opinion
piece on animal research is
misleading and distorts the
facts. On Jan. 21,2005, he and Claire
Wagenseil spent more than two
hours with me and the Attending
Veterinarian for Stanford, toured
Stanford's animal facility and
learned in detail the way Stanford
and its Animal Care and Use Com
mittee and veterinarians work to
protect animals in research, includ
ing rats, mice and birds. It now ap
pears that Liebman's goal during the
meeting and tour was to promote his
own slant rather than present a fair
and objective view of animal re
search at Stanford.
Contrary to Liebman's claims that
regulations do not restrict actual ex
periments, the Animal Care and Use

Committee at an institution reviews
all uses of animals whether it is for
teaching or research. This review oc
curs before animals can be purchased
and is designed to insure animal wel
fare. Scientists who want to use re
search animals must describe in de
tail the purpose of the research; the
value of the research; why animals
must be used; and how the number of
animals to be used was determined.
In addition, they must describe in
detail all their procedures involving
animals. If these procedures might
cause the animals to experience more
than momentary pain or distress, they
are required to provide anesthetic or
analgesic drugs to alleviate the dis
comfort, or explain why these drugs
or other treatments cannot be used to
fully relieve it. In case of the latter, the
investigator will perform a literature
search to document why pain and dis

tress could not be avoided.
More importantly, a scientist can
not simply claim "scientific necessi
ty" to avoid the use of anesthetics or
analgesics as Liebman claims, but this
must be proven to a skeptical group
of scientists, veterinarians and non
scientists. The examples of "re
search" he gives are not credible.
Although the Animal Welfare Act
excludes rats, mice and birds, the
other federal agencies do not exclude
these animals. Institutions that re
ceive funds from federal agencies
must file an assurance with the feder
al government that they will abide by
the Guide for the Care and Use of
Animals and other federal regula
tions. The guide has the force of law
and spells out in detail the animal
housing, sanitation, caging, veteri
nary care, etc. that laboratory ani
mals must receive. Contrary to what
Liebman says, the Guide includes all
vertebrate species, including mice,
rats, birds, frogs, etc.
The United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA) is responsible
for administering the regulations in
the Animal Welfare Act and its revi
sions. USDA inspectors make unan
nounced inspections. During these
visits, they review the animal care
committee's work and visit all facili
ties where USDA-regulated species
are held to actually see these animals
and how they are being housed and
treated.They also conduct a detailed
audit of records to insure that what
the scientist tells the animal care
committee will be done is actually
taking place. USDA inspectors are
thorough, and the department can
fine institutions that fail to comply.
Unfortunately, the USDA has a
limited number of categories for
defining non-compliance, and these
can be misleading—as was explained
to Liebman during his visit.They also
have no mechanisms for reporting or
documenting the good work that is
done to protect and insure the well
being of the animals. The USDA in
spection reports and the records of
the numbers of animals "used" at
Stanford are available on the USDA
Web site. It is not a secret.
The Association for the Assess
ment and Accreditation of Labora
tory Animal Care (AAALAC) is a
voluntary organization that uses the
guide as its yardstick for evaluating
the processes an institution uses to
ensure quality laboratory animal
care. Stanford is proud to have been
AAALAC-accredited since 1988.
AAALAC's site visitors receive a
description of the animal care pro
gram before they arrive; Stanford's
AAALAC document is more than
2(X) pages in length. While at Stan
ford, site visitors — including expe
rienced scientists and veterinarians
— inspect how the animal care com
mittee reviews animal protocols.
They observe how facilities are
maintained, visit all the animal facil
ities and check all records ranging
from the way clinical cases are man
aged to whether the temperature at
which cages are washed is appropri
ate. Although the AAALAC site vis

its are planned ahead of time, these
visitors know how things are sup
posed to be managed and where to
look for problems. Accordingly, hid
ing problems would not be as easy as
Liebman implies. Stanford Universi
ty is proud to be A AALAC accredit
ed because it is considered the
"Good Housekeeping Seal" of qual
ity animal care.
Stanford has an excellent history
of compliance. Federal animal wel
fare laws and regulations require an
institution to self-report problems it
discovers. Failure to "self-report" is a
violation. Stanford takes the initia
tive to self-report issues that arise; it
does not try to hide problems from
regulatory agencies. Yet, Liebman
points to Stanford's compliance with
this reporting requirement as evi
dence that it is noncompliant. On the
contrary, it proves that Stanford takes
its responsibility seriously, notifies
