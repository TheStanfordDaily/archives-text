# Oppose creationism
## 
### J. SREEDHAR 
An issue has been quietly
brewing in California re
garding the contents of
school textbooks. In the past few
months, there have been repeat
ed clashes between scientists and
creationists in Sacramento's cor
ridors of power, which are likely
to spill over into the mainstream.
In particular, creationists have
managed to influence decisions
made by California's State Board
of Education.
It is well known that propo
nents of biblical creationism ob
ject to scientific ideas like evolu
tion and regularly clamor for
equal treatment of their beliefs in
school textbooks.
In the scientific method, one
makes observations and comes

up with a hypothesis that makes
accurate predictions. The results
obtained by the scientific method
are repeatable and the hypothe
ses themselves are potentially fal
si fiable by new evidence. On the
other hand, pseudo-scientific the
ories make assumptions that can
neither be proved nor disproved,
but are taken as truth. ITiey do
not follow the rules of logic, dis
card scientific evidence and are
based on faith.
A field that qualifies as a pseu
do-science and is based on cre
ationism is philology, which was
developed in the 19th century. By
cloaking its arguments in academ
ic language and claiming to recon
struct human history by analyzing
the roots of words in various lan
guages, it passes off biblical descrip
tions as historical events. One of the
pioneers of philology. Max Muller,
was a self-admitted believer in the
historical foundation of the descrip
tion given in Genesis and asserted
that "we still speak the language of
the first ancestors of our race." He
went so far as to write to Charles
Darwin that evolution is false be
cause the languages of animals do
not resemble those of humans.
Although today's scientists do
not consider philology to be a legiti
mate science, believers in the literal
interpretation of the Bible insist on
using philology to promote their
views. One such view, which has been
repeatedly discredited by science,
but is still being pushed for inclusion
in California's textbooks without
mentioning its biblical aspects, is a
theory known as the Aryan Migra
tion Theory. According to this theo
ry, descendants of the biblical char
acter Japheth invaded India after the
deluge and populated it. Inclusion of
this theory in school textbooks
would indirectly give sanction to cre
ationism and open the doors for fu
ture frontal assaults on science.
A recent paper co-authored by
Peter Underhill in our Genetics De
partment analyzed genetic evidence
and concluded that there is no such
thing as Aryan migration into India.
This is consistent with evidence
from other fields such as carbon dat
ing, fossil studies, archaeology, geo
physics, linguistics, metallurgy and
satellite imaging. However, in a let
ter to the California State Board of
Education, Vinay Lai — a humani
ties professor at UCLA and believ
er in philology — dismisses such sci
entific conclusions as "palpable
falsehoods" and "alleged evidence
of some unknown geneticist." He
avers that science has no role to play
in overturning "the long established
view on this matter."
It is incumbent upon us at Stan
ford to stand up for science and op
pose creationism. We should do our
part to help California public schools
improve their ranking, which is al
most the lowest in the country.
