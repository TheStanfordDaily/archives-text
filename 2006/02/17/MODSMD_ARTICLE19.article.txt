## '05 CHAMP TEXAS VISITS Longhorns loom but Card confident Card still feel sting of last year's sweep by Longhorns 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Ihe last time Stanford faced Texas, the
Cardinal suffered a three-game sweep in
Austin. Two one-run games — including
one bottom-of-the-ninth comeback for
Texas — and a 6-4 loss made the sweep
even more frustrating.
The Longhorns managed to beat the
Card, despite giving up 15 runs on 34 hits
in the series, in what was their eventual
road to victory in Omaha.
"Everyone remembers the disappoint
ment. playing down there, where we had a
chance to win a lot of games and ended up
getting swept," said sophomore rightfield
er Michael Taylor, who was 2-for-5 in each
contest against Texas last year. "We'd like
to return the favor."
No. 24 Stanford (4-2) gets a chance to
do just that when the No. 7 Longhorns (4-
4) come to Sunken Diamond this week
end. But for a real chance to challenge the
defending national champions, Stanford
must first contend with its own quiet bats
and strong Texas pitching.
Despite being swept in their season
opening series at San Diego two weeks
ago, Texas bounced back in the Houston
College Classic and against UT-San Anto
nio on Tuesday. I he Longhorns are batting
.291 as a team in their last five games and
have posted a 1.43 ERA in that period.
"It conies with playing a perennial top
-10 program — they have pitching,"Taylor
said. "They have great pitching just as we
do, and they have a lot of guys that are
going to come in very confident because
they have a lot of hype behind them.
'I hey Ye going to have two or three pitches
and they're going to throw them for
strikes."
Texas sends righthander Adrian Alaniz
(1-0, 1.69 ERA), whom Stanford coach
Mark Marquess calls one of the better
pitchers in college baseball, to the mound
tomorrow night while Stanford hopes to
give junior righthander lireg Reynolds (0-

Saturday's starters are righty Kyle McCul

Matt Manship (0-1,1.74 ERA). Marquess
noted the strength of Texas' freshman
arms.
" They probably have a better pitching
staff in total this year than they did last
year," he said.
"They're going to be coming after us so
we have to get aggressive and swing the
bat really well and improve upon what we

haven't had many walks, struck out a
lot of batters — I think our ratio was
5:1 strikeouts to walks. For the first
six games, I'm pleased. To have four
wins and not be hitting very well,
we're very fortunate."
On Sunday, Marquess shifted the
batting order around and found im
pressive results. With a new leadoff
man. freshman Joey August — who
holds a .667 average in six at-bats —
the Cardinal found a spark that in
fused most of the lineup, as eight of
the nine starters reached base.
Stanford's pitching has also been
solid (3.44 ERA) and a few surprises

have helped. Freshman lefthander
Jeremy Bleich has already notched
one win and two saves this season,
and he'll likely see more time this
weekend against the slow-starting
Longhorns.
"I don't think we'll change our
game plan based on the fact that
they're national champions." Bleich
said. But at the same time I don't
think we'll let up at all just because
they haven't been playing well. They
definitely have the potential for play
ing well and if they're down we have
to keep them down, at least for this
weekend."
The Longhorn bats, after a slight
slump the first weekend, are finding
their groove and are led by Chais
Fuller, Chance Wheeless and leadoff
man Nick Peoples who have respec
tive .308, .3(X) and .281 averages. The

Cardinal will also keep an eye out for
speedy number-three hitter Drew
Stubbs (.241), who hit two inside-the
park homeruns against Stanford last
year.
"1 think a lot of the guys on the
team are very veteran guys and as a
result they know it's an important se
ries," Bleich said."But you've still got
to have fun in the game,you still have
got to play the way you would against
any other team, no matter who they

Austin. Two one-run games — including
one bottom-of-the-ninth comeback for
Texas — and a 6-4 loss made the sweep
even more frustrating.
The Longhorns managed to beat the
Card, despite giving up 15 runs on 34 hits
in the series, in what was their eventual
road to victory in Omaha.
"Everyone remembers the disappoint
ment. playing down there, where we had a
chance to win a lot of games and ended up
getting swept," said sophomore rightfield
er Michael Taylor, who was 2-for-5 in each
contest against Texas last year. "We'd like
to return the favor."
No. 24 Stanford (4-2) gets a chance to
do just that when the No. 7 Longhorns (4-
4) come to Sunken Diamond this week
end. But for a real chance to challenge the
defending national champions, Stanford
must first contend with its own quiet bats
and strong Texas pitching.
Despite being swept in their season
opening series at San Diego two weeks
ago, Texas bounced back in the Houston
College Classic and against UT-San Anto
nio on Tuesday. I he Longhorns are batting
.291 as a team in their last five games and
have posted a 1.43 ERA in that period.
"It conies with playing a perennial top
-10 program — they have pitching,"Taylor
said. "They have great pitching just as we
do, and they have a lot of guys that are
going to come in very confident because
they have a lot of hype behind them.
'I hey Ye going to have two or three pitches
and they're going to throw them for
strikes."

Saturday's starters are righty Kyle McCul

Matt Manship (0-1,1.74 ERA). Marquess
noted the strength of Texas' freshman
arms.
" They probably have a better pitching
staff in total this year than they did last
year," he said.
"They're going to be coming after us so
we have to get aggressive and swing the
bat really well and improve upon what we

lot of batters — I think our ratio was
5:1 strikeouts to walks. For the first
six games, I'm pleased. To have four
wins and not be hitting very well,
we're very fortunate."
On Sunday, Marquess shifted the
batting order around and found im
pressive results. With a new leadoff
man. freshman Joey August — who
holds a .667 average in six at-bats —
the Cardinal found a spark that in
fused most of the lineup, as eight of
the nine starters reached base.
Stanford's pitching has also been
solid (3.44 ERA) and a few surprises

have helped. Freshman lefthander
Jeremy Bleich has already notched
one win and two saves this season,
and he'll likely see more time this
weekend against the slow-starting
Longhorns.
"I don't think we'll change our
game plan based on the fact that
they're national champions." Bleich
said. But at the same time I don't
think we'll let up at all just because
they haven't been playing well. They
definitely have the potential for play
ing well and if they're down we have
to keep them down, at least for this
weekend."
The Longhorn bats, after a slight
slump the first weekend, are finding
their groove and are led by Chais
Fuller, Chance Wheeless and leadoff
man Nick Peoples who have respec
tive .308, .3(X) and .281 averages. The

Cardinal will also keep an eye out for
speedy number-three hitter Drew
Stubbs (.241), who hit two inside-the
park homeruns against Stanford last
year.
"1 think a lot of the guys on the
team are very veteran guys and as a
result they know it's an important se
ries," Bleich said."But you've still got
to have fun in the game,you still have
got to play the way you would against
any other team, no matter who they
are or what their ranking is or how
many national championships
they've won."
