## '05 CHAMP TEXAS VISITS Longhorns loom but Card confident Card still feel sting of last year's sweep by Longhorns 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Ihe last time Stanford faced Texas, the
Cardinal suffered a three-game sweep in
Austin. Two one-run games — including
one bottom-of-the-ninth comeback for
Texas — and a 6-4 loss made the sweep
even more frustrating.
The Longhorns managed to beat the
Card, despite giving up 15 runs on 34 hits
in the series, in what was their eventual
road to victory in Omaha.
"Everyone remembers the disappoint
ment. playing down there, where we had a
chance to win a lot of games and ended up
getting swept," said sophomore rightfield
er Michael Taylor, who was 2-for-5 in each
contest against Texas last year. "We'd like
to return the favor."
No. 24 Stanford (4-2) gets a chance to
do just that when the No. 7 Longhorns (4-
4) come to Sunken Diamond this week
end. But for a real chance to challenge the
defending national champions, Stanford
must first contend with its own quiet bats
and strong Texas pitching.
Despite being swept in their season
opening series at San Diego two weeks
ago, Texas bounced back in the Houston
College Classic and against UT-San Anto
nio on Tuesday. I he Longhorns are batting
.291 as a team in their last five games and
have posted a 1.43 ERA in that period.
"It conies with playing a perennial top
-10 program — they have pitching,"Taylor
said. "They have great pitching just as we
do, and they have a lot of guys that are
going to come in very confident because
they have a lot of hype behind them.
'I hey Ye going to have two or three pitches
and they're going to throw them for
strikes."
Texas sends righthander Adrian Alaniz
(1-0, 1.69 ERA), whom Stanford coach
Mark Marquess calls one of the better
pitchers in college baseball, to the mound
tomorrow night while Stanford hopes to
give junior righthander lireg Reynolds (0-

Saturday's starters are righty Kyle McCul
loch (0-1, 1.74 ERA) and Stanford senior
Matt Manship (0-1,1.74 ERA). Marquess
noted the strength of Texas' freshman
arms.
" They probably have a better pitching
staff in total this year than they did last
year," he said.
"They're going to be coming after us so
we have to get aggressive and swing the
bat really well and improve upon what we
ditl this weekend." Taylor added. "And
hopefully we'll get the same good pitching
and defense."

and improve on that this week," Marquess
said. "I think we pitched very well. We
