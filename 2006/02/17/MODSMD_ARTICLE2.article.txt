# STANFORD 82, ARIZONA STATE 69
## Grunfeld bags 31 in ugly win Eighth straight home win, Hernandez has now made 34 free throws in a row 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR OF SPORTS 
Dan Grunfeld scored a career-high
31 on just 11 field goal attempts, and
Matt Haryasz added 22 as Stanford
knocked off Arizona State 82-69 at
home last night.
With a fantastically accurate shoot
ing performance — 9-of-ll from the
field and a perfect 11-of-11 from the
free-throw line — Grunfeld trumpeted
a return to his pre-injury form. He suf
fered a season-ending right ACL tear
against California on Feb. 12,2005, and
last season's First Team All-Pac-10 star
had never quite regained his form this
season — until now.
"Points are points and I've scored
points in the past, but for me it's a special
thing because I am able to do things now
that maybe I couldn't do earlier this sea
son," said Grunfeld about cracking 30
for the first time in his collegiate career.
"I have a lighter brace on. It makes you
a different person."
Fellow senior guard Chris Hernan
dez added 12 in a game that saw Stan
ford (13-9, 9-4 Pac-10) jump to a 14-5
edge just 3:39 in, and never lead by fewer
than six for the remainder of the contest.

Senior guard Dan Grunfeld returned to his pre-injury form with a career-high 31 points
in the win. Grunfeld suffered a season-ending right ACL tear in last year's home victory
over Cal — exactly one week ago yesterday.
Arizona State (9-14, 3-11) used a 7-0
run to help cut a 41-25 halftime deficit to
just 49-43 with 13:40 to go. But then the of
ficials whistled an Arizona State assistant
coach — they didn't specify whom — for a
technical foul.
T"he refs kept themselves busy last
night, as the foul was one of the 49 called in
the game, often for minimal contact.
"The key stat of the game was free
throws, and we can't do anything about
that," said Arizona State head coach Rob
Evans about his squad being whistled for
27 of the fouls.
Chris Hernandez drained the free
throws from the technical — he's now
made 34 in a row, just 15 shy of the school
record — and Stanford rode a 31-of-35
charity stripe performance to an easy, al
beit ugly, victory.
Given such a lackluster contest —
Maples Pavilion was easily as quiet as it
had been in years, exhibition games includ
ed — the post-game spotlight shone all the
more brightly on Grunfeld.
The Wisconsin native and son of former
NBA great Ernie Grunfeld said he felt
healthy enough to switch to a lighter knee
brace in Stanford's last contest, an 80-76
loss at Gonzaga on Saturday. Coach Trent
Johnson said Grunfeld's improvement in
play since — and effort in rehab through
out — has been immense.
"He's had a lot of bounce the last
week," Johnson said. "I thought at Gon
zaga he looked really good. I don't think
any of us have any idea of what he
worked through to put himself in this
shape. Danny's by no means a great ath
lete when he's completely healthy, so 1
think it speaks volumes to what a great
kid he is."
During the game, Haryasz, a senior for
ward, added 22 points on 6-of-12 field-goal
shooting and 10-of-12 free-throw shooting.
After the game, Haryasz added kind words
about his teammate — and friend.

"It's good to know your friend's feeling
better out there and able to do more,"
Haryasz said. "I love the guy, and it just
means so much to me that he's out there.
Next for the Cardinal is a visit from the
Pac-10's other traditional heavyweight,
Arizona (15-10,8-6). Last night, the Wild
cats dropped a 75-66 decision at Cal (10-6,
10-3), moving the Bears into a tie with

UCLA (20-5, 10-3) for the Pac-10 lead.
Both teams are one game ahead of the
Card, and Stanford's NCAA Tournament
chances might just depend on catching up.
"We just need to get wins," said
Haryasz, who scored 25 in Stanford's 90-81
overtime loss at Arizona on Jan. 19. "I think
we kind of got robbed of one at U of A. so
we'll be pumped up to play."
