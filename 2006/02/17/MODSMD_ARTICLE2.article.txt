# STANFORD 82, ARIZONA STATE 69
## Grunfeld bags 31 in ugly win Eighth straight home win, Hernandez has now made 34 free throws in a row 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR OF SPORTS 
Dan Grunfeld scored a career-high
31 on just 11 field goal attempts, and
Matt Haryasz added 22 as Stanford
knocked off Arizona State 82-69 at
home last night.
With a fantastically accurate shoot
ing performance — 9-of-ll from the
field and a perfect 11-of-11 from the
free-throw line — Grunfeld trumpeted
a return to his pre-injury form. He suf
fered a season-ending right ACL tear
against California on Feb. 12,2005, and
last season's First Team All-Pac-10 star
had never quite regained his form this
season — until now.
"Points are points and I've scored
points in the past, but for me it's a special
thing because I am able to do things now
that maybe I couldn't do earlier this sea
son," said Grunfeld about cracking 30
for the first time in his collegiate career.
"I have a lighter brace on. It makes you
a different person."
Fellow senior guard Chris Hernan
dez added 12 in a game that saw Stan
ford (13-9, 9-4 Pac-10) jump to a 14-5
edge just 3:39 in, and never lead by fewer
than six for the remainder of the contest.

Senior guard Dan Grunfeld returned to his pre-injury form with a career-high 31 points
in the win. Grunfeld suffered a season-ending right ACL tear in last year's home victory
over Cal — exactly one week ago yesterday.
