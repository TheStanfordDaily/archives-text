# SOFTBALL HOSTS INVITE
## SOFTBALL Sluggers seek six-game sweep Cardinal set to start home tourney Friday with Santa Clara Broncos 
### ANDREW LOMELI STAFF WRITER 
Newcomers Missy Penna and Maddy Coon made names for
themselves last week, and the No. 7 Cardinal softball team hopes
the dynamic freshman duo can live up to the hype heading into
this weekend's Stanford Invitational.
And even with the Cardinal (4-1) rolling, and all four of this
weekend's opponents appearing seriously overmatched, coach
John Rittman says it will take a group effort for the Cardinal (4-

I) to capitalize on last
weekend's success in
Tempe, Ariz.
"We need to come out
ready to play each day,
and I expect everybody on
our roster to be ready,"
Rittman said. "It's one
thing to practice at full
speed; it's another thing
playing at full speed."
As for Penna and
Coon, Rittman said he
looks forward to provid
ing the freshmen with
more at-bats and in-game
situations to develop their
experience. Penna collect
ed 24 strikeouts and hit
.438, while Coon notched
a team-high six RBI in
their debut weekend.
Despite the Cardinal's
performance in Arizona,
Rittman identified several
key issues for the squad to
focus on heading into the
Stanford Invite.
"Defensively, we need
to work on not rushing

came from us trying to make plays too quickly. On the offensive
side, we made some base-running mistakes, and we need to do a
better job of making adjustments from game to game and pitch

Rittman said the Cardinal will
focus on their own play against
Birmingham Southern and Drake,
two schools with which Stanford has
limited familiarity.
"It's more important that we
worry about ourselves and the im

"Our team is creating its identity
right now. I like our team chemistry,
our leadership, and the direction in
which we're going."
