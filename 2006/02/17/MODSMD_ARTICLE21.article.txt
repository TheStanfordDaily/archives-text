## Closing Clemente's chapter 
### 
In 1997, on the fiftieth anniversary
of his debut in the major leagues,
Jackie Robinson's #42 was re
tired by every baseball team in
Major League Baseball. The first
African-American major league
baseball player of the modern era,
Robinson's life and career were ded
icated to the eradication of segrega
tion and racist ideals, both on the field
and in society.
Recently, the Hispanics Across
America (HAA) has made a push to
have the #21 of former major league
All-Star and world humanitarian
Roberto Clemente retired by all
teams as well. Surprisingly, this move
ment has met opposition from an un
likely source.
Sharon Robinson, daughter of the
late Jackie Robinson, has come out in
opposition of the unilateral retire
ment.
"To my understanding, the pur
pose of retiring my father's number is
that what he did changed all of base
ball, not only for African-Americans
but also for Latinos, so I think that
purpose has been met," says Robin
son. "When you start retiring num
bers across the board, for all different
groups, you're kind of diluting the
original purpose."
What Jackie Robinson did for
baseball is truly worthy of the honor
bestowed. However, if ever there
were another player worthy of this
honor, Roberto Clemente would be
that man.
A few facts: Jackie Robinson was
indeed the first African American
major league baseball player in the
modern era. He endured more big
otry and adversity in the face of a seg
regated America and smiled all the
way through it. Because of him, the
game of baseball was two decades
ahead of the rest of society and paved
the way for a racially integrated
America.
Not only was he a pioneer, but he
was a damn good ballplayer. He was a
six-time All-Star, an NL MVP, and a
World Series champion. He still holds
the record for most steals of home in
the modern era (19). He hit .311 for
his career.
Clemente was even more of a
stud. I\velve All-Star appearances,
3,(XX) hits,NL MVP, two World Series
Titles, World Series MVP, and twelve
Gold Gloves, just to touch on a few of
his highlights. This guy was the pre
miere Latin American baseball play
er, paving the way for the 37% of
major league players who now boast
Latino heritages.
Sure, there were others who had
his numbers and his ethnicity, but it
was his work off the field as a good
will ambassador of baseball and hu
manity that stood out. His example
and character have led to the building
of countless safe baseball facilities in
his name throughout Central and
South America, lhe man died in a
plane crash on his way to Nicaragua
to bring relief supplies to the victims
of an earthquake there. In the Latino
community, he's on par with... well,
there's really no one who transcends
national borders quite the way that
Clemente did.
So does this mean he deserves to
have his number retired by all of
baseball? Maybe not, but his efforts
certainly warrant some sort of
league wide recognition. Think how
different the game today would be
without the likes of Alex Rodriguez,
Carlos Beltran, Pedro Martinez,
Manny Ramirez, and the cadre of su
perstars with Latino roots. Clemente
paved the way for their ascension
and put baseball on the map south of
the border.
Hey, it was different for Robin
son. He was well aware of the barri
ers he was breaking, and took way
more heat for his role in the desegre
gation of baseball than Clemente
ever could have imagined. Sharon
Robinson is absolutely justified in
her stand. We can't cheapen the
honor bestowed to Jackie by just re
tiring numbers left and right across
the board.
What we're talking about here,
though, isn't a whim. Ihis isn't like
calling for a John Rocker Day be
cause he served his community serv
ice sentence. Clemente is a hero to the
game of baseball on par with the likes
of Robinson.
Maybe retiring his number is just
simply not the right honorarium.
For one thing, the Yankees are run
ning out of active numbers to give
