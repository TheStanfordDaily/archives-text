# January leaves Card cold
## Our free throws were horrendous. I hope it gets people's attention.

TEMPE, Ariz. — No. 15 Arizona
State's Briann January admitted that she
was a bit awestruck guarding Candice
Wiggins in her first game against No. 11
Stanford. But this time around the fresh
man guard was ready for the challenge.
Her team-high 13 points, including four
free throws down the stretch, led the Sun
Devils to their 13th straight home victo
ry, 62-59, over the Cardinal.
"She's been doing it all year," Arizona
State coach Charlie TUrner Thorne said.
"She's just an amazing talent, and we knew
that when we signed her. We're excited
about Briann's future, that's for sure."
Wiggins, who had a game-high 25
points, hit a three-pointer to cut the
deficit to one in the last minute, but Jan
uary sunk two free throws to put the Sun
Devils back up by three — this time for
good.
"In the first half I shot a free throw
long," January said. "So after the half, 1
just shot free throws in warm-ups be
cause I knew it might come down to
that."
The Cardinal (18-6, 12-3 Pac-10) had
two chances to send the game into over
time in the last 13.7 seconds. But the
team could not convert when Wiggins'
three-pointer smacked off the rim and
Rosalyn Gold-Onwude's desperation
attempt fell short.
"We played hard, but we just didn't do
the little things like free-throw shooting,"
Wiggins said. "It's definitely disappoint
ing, but it's not the end of anything."
Though the Cardinal lead by as many
as five in the second half, the momentum
turned in the Sun Devils' (21-5, 12-4)
favor on a January desperation jumper
with 1:49 left in the game. With the shot
clock expiring, January fell to her left
and heaved the ball in from around the
free-throw line to put Arizona State up
56-54.
The Cardinal then tied the game and
looked to be in control when junior for
ward Kristin Newlin came down with a
rebound with less than a minute to go.
But Newlin was whistled for her fifth
foul on senior forward Kristin Kovesdy.
"We just worked harder and we
wanted it more," Kovesdy said. "When it
came down to the end, we were diving
on the floor and getting the rebounds."

Free-throw shooting proved to be the
difference as the Cardinal and Sun Dev
ils split most of the other stats fairly
evenly. But from the line, Arizona State
shot 94.1 percent for the game, while
Stanford hit only 52.6 percent.
"Our free throws were horrendous,"
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "I hope it
gets people's attention that they need to
be in the gym and work on them. Maybe

it will get some people mad."
Another problem for the Cardinal
was production down low. Junior center
Brooke Smith scored eight of Stan
ford's first 13. But, she picked up her
critical fourth foul with 9:16 left in the
game, and only had one basket in the
second half.

THE REPORT
Last: L 62-59 vs. ASU ■ Next: @Arizona Sat. 2:00 PM
Despite 28 points from sophomore Candice Wiggins, the Cardinal fell to ASU in
the final stretch. Poor free throw shooting and foul trouble doomed the Cardinal.

Sophomore guard Candice Wiggins drives on Arizona State's Briann January. Wiggins scored a game
high 28, but Jauary's 13 was enough to lead the Sun Devils to their 13th straight win at home.
