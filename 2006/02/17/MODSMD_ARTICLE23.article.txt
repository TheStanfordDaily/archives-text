## Wrestlers blow by Fresno Bulldogs Stanford finishes regular season with winning record, Gardner gets 31st win of season 
### DENIS GRIFFIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Wrestling took to the road Wednesday evening to face Fresno
State in a final tune-up before the Pac-10 tournament. Coming off of
two straight losses to conference opponents Cal Poly (San Luis Obis
po) and Arizona State, the Cardinal bounced back well with a domi
nating performance against the Bulldogs.
"I think overall there was something good in every match," coach
Kerry McCoy said. "Everyone wrestled real well, and we can see that
every time — especially these last three matches — they wrestle bet
ter. And we're right on pace to perform well at the Pac-10 Tourna
ment."
Stanford (8-7,4-4 Pac-10) topped Fresno State (4-11) by a score of
26-12, winning six of 10 matches.The Cardinal's sizable victory sprung
from major decisions by senior captain Ray Blake at 165 pounds, 125-
pound sophomore captain Tanner Gardner and 149-pound sopho
more Josh Zupancic. Stanford also earned a technical fall victory from
sophomore Scott Loescher at 157-pounds and Fresno State's forfeit
to Miguel Matta at 174 pounds.
With the win. Stanford nudged their overall record above .500 in
McCoy's first season as coach.
"It's huge for the team, building the momentum that we started at
the beginning of the year, especially because the last few weeks we've
had some ups and downs," McCoy said.

Sophomore team captain Tanner Gardner, ranked No. 11 in the nation, won at 125 pounds to lead Stanford to victoiy in their regular season finale.
McCoy added his hope that this year's suc
cess could play a role in building a strong pro
gram for the future.
"One of our goals is to be the best wrestling
program in the West, and we can't do that if we
don't beat the other programs," McCoy said.
"So, on a lot of fronts, it's definitely good to fin
ish above .500. Like I tell our guys, we're not sat
isfied with that because we could be better, but
we're moving in the right direction."
Fresno scored the first team points of the
night when Garrett Spooner defeated Stanford
senior Juston Johnson at 141 pounds. But Zu
pancic answered back with a 13-3 victory over
Duston Rocha.
Three consecutive Cardinal victories later,
Stanford was up 19-3, and Fresno was unable to
recover from the deficit.
The Cardinal will have a break until Febru
ary 26, when the Pac-10 Tournament opens in
Maples Pavilion. But McCoy stressed that, for
the most part, his team's preparation and train

ing will stay the same.
"We've set our training to peak at the Pac-10,
so the training that we've done the last few
weeks has been focused on that, with some stops
along the way," McCoy said. "We'll be doing the
same thing overall, but now it's just a little bit
more focused on specific opponents."
The outcome of the Pac-10 Tournament will
be the key result of the season for the Cardinal,
as those who succeed move on to the NCAA
Tournament. McCoy believes his team is ready
for the challenge of hosting the season-ending
event, pointing to a difficult 39-0 loss to Illinois
as the turning point in the season.
"Right after the Illinois match we started
telling our guys that they had to believe in them
selves out there, and now we see that they are,"
McCoy said. "Win, lose or draw, they believe
that they're going out there to dominate and
wrestle their best, and that's one of the biggest
things that shows me that we can do well in the
tournament."
