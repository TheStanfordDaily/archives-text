Wrestling took to the road Wednesday evening to face Fresno
State in a final tune-up before the Pac-10 tournament. Coming off of
two straight losses to conference opponents Cal Poly (San Luis Obis
po) and Arizona State, the Cardinal bounced back well with a domi
nating performance against the Bulldogs.
"I think overall there was something good in every match," coach
Kerry McCoy said. "Everyone wrestled real well, and we can see that
every time — especially these last three matches — they wrestle bet
ter. And we're right on pace to perform well at the Pac-10 Tourna
ment."
Stanford (8-7,4-4 Pac-10) topped Fresno State (4-11) by a score of
26-12, winning six of 10 matches.The Cardinal's sizable victory sprung
from major decisions by senior captain Ray Blake at 165 pounds, 125-
pound sophomore captain Tanner Gardner and 149-pound sopho
more Josh Zupancic. Stanford also earned a technical fall victory from
sophomore Scott Loescher at 157-pounds and Fresno State's forfeit
to Miguel Matta at 174 pounds.
With the win. Stanford nudged their overall record above .500 in
McCoy's first season as coach.
"It's huge for the team, building the momentum that we started at
the beginning of the year, especially because the last few weeks we've
had some ups and downs," McCoy said.
