# MEN'S SWIMMING AND DIVING
## Card, Cal swimmers ready for dual duel No. 3 Stanford and No. 2 Bears end season with cross-Bay battle 
### KATHERINE BELL 
In what collegeswimming.com calls it the "dual
meet of the year," the No. 3 men's swimming and
diving team is sure to cause quite a splash this Sat
urday in the Avery Aquatics Center, facing off
against No. 2 California.The meet marks the culmi
nation of the dual meet season for both teams and
the final chance to fine-tune races before the Pac
-10 championships in Federal Way, Wash., in two
weeks.
In last year's competition, the Golden Bears (6-
0,3-0 Pac-10) edged out Stanford (3-1,2-1) with a
score of 144-129, only to be outscored by the Card
two weeks later at Pac-lOs, as well as at the NCAA
Championships. Cal's victory last year was their
first against Stanford since 1991, and will serve as
great motivation for the Cardinal men to recapture
bragging rights.
Junior Matt Crowe promises that if it's anything
like past years, the crowd will not be disappointed.
"In each of the last two years, the meet has been
labeled as the fastest dual meet in the history of col
legiate swimming," he said.
The meet will also be the seniors' last chance to

shine in their home pool. Michael McLean, Tobias
Oriwol, and captain Mark Stephens, the team's
three graduating seniors, will be recognized before
the meet.
Though these three seniors have each been
largely instrumental in the team's success, the 12
freshmen listed on the 30-man roster bodes well for
the future of Stanford men's swimming.
With both teams fairly equally matched, the win
will come to the team that best showcases its depth.
For instance, both teams have independently
recorded times in the 4(X) freestyle relay only .02
seconds apart from each other.
According to Crowe, the meet should have its
share of fast times recorded and down-to-the-wire
finishes.
"It's always a fun meet because every event fea
tures at least one athlete from each school who will
contend for the national title in March," he said.
The sprint freestyles, which are often the closest,
most gripping races, will match up Stanford's Ben
Wildman-Tobriner, Kyle Ransom, Jason Dunford,
Dan Priestley and Crowe against an equally deep
Cal sprint team. In the longer freestyles, look for
Shaun Phillips, Andy Grant and McLean to use the
months of endurance training under their belts to
their benefit.
In the 200 backstroke, the nation's fourth
ranked Hongzhe Sun will try to hold off Cal fresh

man David Russell, who just posted the second
best time of the year last week against Southern
California. Meanwhile, the all-frosh breaststroke
squad of Paul Kornfeld, Chris Ash, Keenan New
man and Paul Zaich will join forces to conquer
Cal senior Henrique Barbosa in the 200 breast
stroke. Danny Beal, Pete Carothers and Stephens
will attempt to run away with victory in 200 but
terfly.
According to Crowe,one race not to miss will be
Oriwol battle against Cal's Miguel Molina in the
200 individual medley.
"Last year, Oriwol out-touched Molina by .04
seconds. Personally. I'm looking forward to the re
match," he said.
If the meet is as close as it has been in past years,
the diving events will play a major role in who
emerges victorious. Freshman Dwight Dumais,
who placed third at the 2(K)5 senior nationals in the
1-meter springboard competition, will try to rack
up points for the Cardinal, but not without the sup
port of his teammate Nathan Kim.
In his final meet in Avery, Stephens will push
every member of the team to step up in every sin
gle one of these races.
"The team goal is to win, but the only way we
are going to do that is if the entire team, every sin
gle person, comes in with confidence and leaves
everything in the pool," Stephens said.
