# WOMEN'S GOLF
## Back in action: Card eighth in spring opener Kelly Husted's 221 good for eighth-place tie 
### CARSON COOPER 
Heading into their first competi
tion in three months, the Stanford
women's golf squad was looking for
ward to shaking off the cobwebs and
putting together a strong showing in
the SoCal tournament. Following a
solid performance ending Wednes
day, the team is ready to proceed into
the spring season.
The Cardinal women took eighth
overall in the Northrop Grumman
Regional Challenge, shooting a 921
overall in the three-day tournament.
The tournament pitted 14 of the top
25 teams in the nation against each
other on a challenging Palos Verdes
Course marked by substantial eleva
tion changes. Arizona State took the
team trophy, winning by a stroke at
892 (+ 40) over Southern California.
The tourney was a good barome
ter for the Card, who finished behind
Pac-1() rivals California (908) and
UCLA (914). The team edged out
No. 7 Arkansas while finishing just
behind powerhouse No. 5 Pepper
dine.
"Overall, it was a decent show
ing," coach Caroline O'Connor said.
"I'm pleased with our start to the
winter schedule."
Junior Kelly Husted finished tied
for eighth in the individual standings,
shooting a three-day total of 221
after a final-round 74. Husted is com
ing off a win in the final fall tourna
ment, and O'Connor labels her as a
strong decision-maker with a solid
short game.
Teammate Jennifer Tangtiphai
boontana tied for 26th with a 230,
while freshman Mari Chen tied for
34th with a 233. Also competing for

Stanford were Stephanie Lue, who
tied for 53rd with a 237, and 60th
place finisher Ki-Shui Liao, with a
240.
"Overall, I'm pleased with our
ball control off the tee, but we have
some work to do with our iron play
to give us more birdie opportunities.
We only made 20 birdies this week,"
O'Connor said.
USC's Iren Cho took top individ
ual honors, shooting a 71 in the final
round for a one-over 214. One stroke
behind her was Jennifer Osburn of
Arizona State, with Sofie Anderson
of California taking third with a 217.
The Cardinal women travel to
TUcson, Ariz, next week for the Wild
cat Invitational, where they will look
to improve on their shot and club se
lection, as well as their short game.
