# WATER POLO
## Women prep for UCSB, CSU-N 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
After playing the first five games of their season in the com
fort of their home pool, the members of the No. 3 women's water
polo team (4-1, 1-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) finally
hit the road this weekend to take on No. 10 UC-Santa Barbara
and No. 19 Cal State Northridge. Despite the rankings of their
weekend opponents, the Cardinal recognize that these next two
games will test their team's ability to maintain a high level of play
without the advantage of a familiar pool or the hometown crowd.
The Stanford women are coming off a grueling weekend at the
Stanford Invitational, in which they played four games within a
span of just 36 hours. All things considered, it was a successful
weekend for the Cardinal. They defeated California 6-4 on Sun
day in a closely contested match to take third place in the invita
tional.
In fact, the only blemish on the Cardinal's otherwise consis
tent tournament performance came in the fourth period of the
team's Saturday evening showdown against No. 2 Southern Cali
fornia. With the score tied at 6-6. the Stanford defense faltered
and allowed the Women of Troy to jump out to an insurmount
able three-goal lead. The Stanford women managed to cut the
deficit to 9-7. but time expired before they were able to make any
more of a comeback.
The defeat was tough to swallow for the Cardinal, especially
given the confidence they had carried into their matchup against
USC. Still, the team made it a point to take a lesson from their ex
perience against the talented Women of Troy.
"That loss on Saturday was frustrating," senior captain Lau
rel Champion said. "We were very well prepared for the game.
But it was a great example to our new players of how well other
teams will capitalize on our mistakes. It makes everyone gain a
greater amount of accountability when you can pinpoint certain
plays in the game where things broke down. We can all see how
some small mistakes we made spiraled into giving up a goal.
Senior two-meter Nancy El-Sakkary noted that her team's
performance in the Invitational was marked by both positives
and negatives. While the tournament did showcase the strength
and potential of this year's Cardinal squad, the USC game in par
ticular also exposed key elements of the Stanford women s game
that still need to be fine-tuned.
"The Invitational showed that we are strong as a team in all
aspects of the game," El-Sakkary said. "We were scoring in many

We now know what we're up against, and
the challenge is thrilling,"
—LAUREL CHAMPION, senior
different ways. But we still need to work on communication, es
pecially on defense when we are transitioning from a six-on-six to
being down a player, and then coming hack even again."
That the Cardinal were able to bounce back from a demoral
izing defeat to take third place in the tournament was an encour
aging sign itself.
"Coming back from our loss to USC and then playing well on
Sunday showed that we have great resiliency," Champion said.
"Everyone on the team has a common goal,and each time we can
analyze and learn from a game or play, we are one step closer to
that goal. We now know what we are up against, and the challenge
is thrilling."
The Cardinal know that the ability to handle the pressure of
playing on the road will be crucial to their pursuit of that common
goal. And with five freshman on this year's roster, the develop
ment of this ability will need to occur very quickly — which is
why the team's trip to sunny southern California this weekend
holds a little bit of extra significance.
"It will be our first travel weekend.so everyone is pretty excit
ed to accept the challenge that comes with playing as the visiting
team," Champion said. "Santa Barbara has some great players on
their team and we are looking forward to a good game against
them."
Santa Barbara will also be hosting the annual Gaucho Invita
tional two weekends from now, so the Cardinal will try to use this
weekend's matchup to become acquainted with the UCSB facil
ities. In preparation for the tournament's high level of competi
tion, the Stanford women are eager to make new improvements
while also adjusting to life on the road.
"We've watched a lot of video and focused on what we have to
do both individually and as a team in order to learn from the mis
takes we've made," El-Sakkary said.
