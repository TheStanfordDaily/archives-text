## Cal comes calling Card 
### BEN BACKES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis squad will try to
remain undefeated when they host California at
1 p.m. Saturday.
The two teams split last year, with eaeh win
ning on the road. Stanford's first match of last
season was at Berkeley, and the Cardinal pre
vailed 5-2. In their final match against a ranked
opponent last year, Stanford struggled against
the visiting Bears and dropped a 5-2 match.
Stanford's matches against Cal summed up
last year's disappointing season. Coming into
the first match, the team was ranked No. 7 and
had high hopes for the year, especially after
solidly heating Cal. However, by the end of a
season characterized by a series of close losses,
Stanford had fallen to No. 16 in the rankings and
was soundly stomped by Cal at home.
Senior captain KC Corkery was successful
against Cal last year, winning both of his match
es in singles and doubles. Corkery, who is cur
rently No. 21 in singles and has been playing at
the No. 1 position for the Cardinal in singles and
doubles, thinks that the Cardinal will have no
problems focusing against the Bears.
"We always get up for Cal," he said."They've
been a tough opponent the last three years and
it's a school rival, so we're not going to need any
extra motivation."
Other than Corker)', the only returning play
er to win a singles match against Cal last year
was junior Eric McKean, who has not been
placed in a dual match lineup this season. Junior
James Wan and sophomore Phil kao, who will
likely both play against Cal this weekend, were
a combined 0-4 against the Bears last year.
Stanford, which began the season ranked No.
14. has moved up to No. 6 during the course of its
winning streak. Two of its wins have been

against ranked opponents — UCLA, which was
No. 4 at the time, and then-No. 18 Southern Cal
ifornia.
Although Stanford is ranked ahead of Cal
and is playing at home, coach John Whitlinger
thinks it will be a close competition.
"Cal is very good and it's going to be a very
tight match," he said. "They match up with us
well. I'm looking forward to a great battle like
we've had in the past and it will probably go
right down to the wire."
Going back to last season, the Cardinal had
spent nine consecutive ranking periods outside
the top-10 before beating USC and UCLA —
unfamiliar territory for the team which holds the
record for most NCAA Championships (17).
Corkery, for one, is not surprised to see Stan
ford back near the top of the rankings.
"I think this is where we expected to be from
the beginning of the year." he said."lt's still early
in the season and we're going to try to keep
doing well."
Stanford needs a tough match-up in order to
truly test its doubles game, and the Bears pro
vide just that. Though the Cardinal are unde
feated this year, their doubles play has been un
reliable at times. Against USC and UCLA,Stan
ford lost the doubles point before digging itself
out of the hole with strong singles play.
Other than the No. 1 doubles team of Cork
ery and junior James Pade, which is ranked fifth
in the country, the pairings have been constant
ly changing. Further adding to the changes will
be the eventual return of freshman Matt Bruch.
who has been injured for the first four matches
of the season.
"We're getting [healthier] every day,"
Whitlinger said. "[They] are working hard to get
back on the court. I'm hoping that we may be
able to see Matt [Bruch] at least in doubles, but
the next couple of days will tell that."
