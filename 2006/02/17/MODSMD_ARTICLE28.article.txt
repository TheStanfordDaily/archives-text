# Stopping Out & Saving Lives
## FACE AIDS trio aims to raise $1 million 
### JAMES HOHMANN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Three Stanford students who took
the year off to form a group called
FACE AIDS report tremendous
progress fundraising, increasing
awareness and building a grassroots
network of student activists.
Before going to Africa last sum
mer, the three were only passing ac
quaintances who shared a mutual in
terest in global health. A Stanford
sponsored summer visit to a Zam
bian refugee camp where they met
and talked with HIV/AIDS pandem
ic victims, however, brought them
close. Their relationship soon
evolved into a partnership as Katie
Bollbach, Jonny Dorsey and Lauren
Young decided to stop out of school
to build their non-profit group last
August.
The trio, who will be juniors when
they return to campus, said their goal
is to raise $1 million and get 200
schools involved in their program
selling pins to raise money and
awareness.
And they are more than well on
their way. By January, they had raised
their operating budget for the rest of
the year. Also, they have built a team
of 30 Stanford students to research
foundations from which to request
money, recruit student leaders at
other campuses and prepare aware
ness materials for a big public push to
launch in April. FACE AIDS chap
ters have been chartered at 15 other
schools, mostly in California. Cur
rently volunteers are talking with
representatives from dozens of other
schools about setting up their own
chapters.
"Right now we are focusing on
California, specifically the Bay Area
and the greater LA area, but eventu
ally the team will be working with
schools from coast to coast," said
sophomore Clay Sader, the campus
contact coordinator for FACE AIDS.
Dorsey and Young said they are
"confident" they will meet their goal
to raise $1 million this year. They
have arranged enough matching
grants to offer a three-to-one match
at every school. Sterling Stamos, an
area investment firm run by Stanford
alumni, pledged to match the first
$10,000 raised. California State Con
troller and gubernatorial candidate
Steve Westly also said he will match
up to $2,500 in gifts. MTV gave the
group a $1,000 grant. The three
founders hope the snowballing effect
will take hold as they continue to
earn more pledges.
While Dorsey and Young have
concentrated on organizing national

support, Bollbach has established
two cooperatives in and near the vil
lage of Mwange in Zambia. They are
making pins that will be sold to stu
dents when the campaign officially
begins in April.
"Katie has been on the ground in
Africa for almost two years," Dorsey
said. "She is extremely focused, sensi
tive and caring."
Bollbach plans to return to the
U.S. in April, after inspecting a clinic
managed by Partners in Health, the
philanthropic group that will dis
perse the money FACE AIDS raises.
Professors and students who have
worked with the trio said that this is
not something they are doing to pad
their resumes. They saw first-hand a
catastrophe unfolding on the other
side of the planet and could not let
themselves go back to the daily mo
notony of class on the Farm, those
who know them said. They had to do
something about what they saw, and
they have.
Microbiology and Immunology
Prof. Robert Siegel, who has been
counseling the group and advising
Dorsey and Young since they re
turned from Africa, called the state
side duo "inexhaustible" and said in
an interview that they remain "com
pletely devoted to the project."
"They have continued to impress
me in their ability to raise awareness,
interest, money and to get other stu
dents actively involved," he said.
"Not only are these two individu
als so passionate about what they are
doing, but they also have such great
presence, and great personalities
too," said junior Wilson Irungu, the
corporate fundraiser for the group.
"They are both so modest and fo
cused on achieving their mission that
I sometimes wonder if they ever re
flect on the grandness of their mis
sion — they are saving lives."
"FACE AIDS is not your typical
student group." Sader said. "Going
from three people with a dream to 200
schools raising a total of $1 million is
many orders of magnitude more com
plicated than what the ordinary stu
dent imagines when they think of
starting a charity organization."
Other students said they were in
spired and motivated to get involved
because of the passion and energy
they saw in Dorsey and Young.
"It was their vision, their countless
hours of deliberating, discussing and
planning that has made FACE AIDS
a reality," junior Jordan Lodato, the
director of external relations of the
group, wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily. "It was their charisma, devo
tion, and confidence that made each
member of our team jump on board."

who know them said. They had to do
something about what they saw, and

Prof. Robert Siegel, who has been
counseling the group and advising
Dorsey and Young since they re
turned from Africa, called the state
side duo "inexhaustible" and said in
an interview that they remain "com
pletely devoted to the project."
"They have continued to impress
me in their ability to raise awareness,
interest, money and to get other stu
dents actively involved," he said.
"Not only are these two individu
als so passionate about what they are
doing, but they also have such great
presence, and great personalities
too," said junior Wilson Irungu, the
corporate fundraiser for the group.
"They are both so modest and fo
cused on achieving their mission that
I sometimes wonder if they ever re
flect on the grandness of their mis
sion — they are saving lives."
"FACE AIDS is not your typical
student group." Sader said. "Going
from three people with a dream to 200
schools raising a total of $1 million is
many orders of magnitude more com
plicated than what the ordinary stu
dent imagines when they think of
starting a charity organization."
Other students said they were in
spired and motivated to get involved
because of the passion and energy
they saw in Dorsey and Young.
"It was their vision, their countless
hours of deliberating, discussing and
planning that has made FACE AIDS
a reality," junior Jordan Lodato, the
director of external relations of the
group, wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily. "It was their charisma, devo
tion, and confidence that made each
member of our team jump on board."
