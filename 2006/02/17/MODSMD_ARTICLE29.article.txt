# FACE AIDS is not your typical student group.

### 
Junior Mayuree Rao is helping
write grant proposals to raise match
ing grants for pin sales from founda
tions and corporations.
"1 was motivated to join because I
was excited about being involved in
such an innovative organization that
has clear-cut objectives in contribut
ing to a solution to HIV/AIDS in
Africa," Rao said. "1 love knowing
that my work with FACE AIDS has a
clear impact and target in fulfilling
the mission of the organization."
"Even if I had never heard about
the AIDS epidemic in Sub-Saharan
Africa, I am confident that a single
conversation with Lauren and Jonny
would have transformed me into an
activist almost immediately," Lodato
added. "They are that inspirational."
Originally, the group had planned
to make small grants to community
organizations in Africa, but Dorsey

said FACE AIDS recognized it was
not feasible to personally distribute
the money. So they teamed up with
Partners in Health, a renowned global
heath non-profit organization associ
ated with Harvard Medical School.
"Partners in Health is the best or
ganization fighting AIDS in Africa,"
Dorsey said, pointing to the perks of
low overhead administrative costs
and a focus on making clinics more
self-sustainable.
The students contend that the best
way to prevent the spread of the dis
ease is to treat it. This has multiple
benefits: it decreases the social stig
ma, encourages those at risk to get
tested and helps deal with other med
ical maladies.
"The best prevention in our opin
ion is treatment," Young said. "Peo
ple won't get tested until they know
there is a treatment. Drugs becoming

available to only a few people in a
camp changes the way everyone
thinks about AIDS."
The Zambian government pro
vides the drugs and Partners in
Health manages the clinics where
they are distributed.The students be
lieve that any donation can help save
lives.
"We are humble about the fact
that $1 million is not a huge amount
in the grand scheme of things,"
Dorsey said. "When Steve Westly
made that $2,5(X) grant, you have to
realize that it is eight people's lives
saved with anti-retroviral drugs."
"There is terrible pessimism in the
U.S. in talking about Africa," he
added. "If you believe you can actual
ly make a difference, then you really
can by implementing good programs
and by doing things that have been
shown to work."

As a native African, Irungu said
he "got tired of watching HIV/AIDS
undermine achievements in human
development in Africa."
"I felt that, in FACE AIDS, I
would get a voice to reach out to peo
ple at Stanford and beyond, and let
them know how the pandemic is im
pacting negatively on demography,
households, social sector, productivi
ty and the macro economy," he said.
For the three founders, it is a full
time job to meet their ambitious
goals. Dorsey and Young said they
have given up much of their social
lives to channel so much energy into
the project. Neither regrets taking
the year off. They hope to return to
school next year but plan to remain
very active in the group.
"1 know in my heart it will work,
but it's a big project," Young said."lt's
hard not being on campus some
times. We love our friends, and we
love our classes. I like doing some
thing that is ambitious. We are both in
our element doing this, and for me it
is incredibly fulfilling."
"I have never worked on some
thing that I have felt is so important
before," she said. "We are going to
save lives and get other students in
volved in something that saves lives."
"Jonny and Lauren are 'taking the

year off because they refuse to give
their work — whether academic or
philanthropic — anything less than
their best efforts," Lodato said.
"Having observed the time, energy
and work they put into FACE AIDS,
it would be no surprise to me if their
next academic year was more of a
'year off than this one will be."
As the group gains momentum, it
is starting to get noticed. Last week.
The San Francisco Chronicle report
ed on their efforts. In two weeks,
Dorsey will travel to Boston and
New York to make his pitch for
FACE AIDS. On his agenda: a meet
ing with world-renowned develop
ment expert and Columbia Econom
ics Prof. Jeffrey Sachs, among others.
