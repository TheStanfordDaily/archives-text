## Dance Marathon aims for highest sum yet Participants in the 24-hour event must raise $200 each 
### JENNIFER CHIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Over 200 Stanford students plan to pull an
all-nighter this upcoming Saturday, Feb. 18. to
take part in Stanford's second-annual Dance
Marathon, to be held from 12 p.m. Saturday to
12 p.m. Sunday in Roble Gym.
"It's going to be the party of the year," pre
dicted senior co-chair Amanda Brophy in an
email to The Daily. "This event really brings to
gether the Stanford community."
Students signed up to participate in Dance
Marathon last November after an active re
cruitment effort in White Plaza. As dancers,
their commitment is to stay on their feet for the
entirety of the day-long festivities and raise
money for Dance Marathon's charity of choice,
the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Founda
tion.
The foundation was created in 1988 after
Elizabeth Glaser and her children were diag
nosed with AIDS. According to the founda
tion's Web site, they are now world leaders in
funding research, instigating global health ini
tiatives and advocating for children. Brophy
also said that Glaser's son Jake will speak at the
event.
Dance Marathon's official fundraising goal
as stated on their Web site is $70,(KK), a marked
increase from last year. Sophomore co-chair
Cailean Cooke said that a portion of this sum
will be met by organization-wide letter writing
campaigns, canning events in Palo Alto and a
Baja Fresh fundraiser.

Dancers themselves are charged with raising
S2()0 each in pledges before the actual night.
"I went door-to-door in my dorm," said
freshman EB Meade. "I took my laptop, played
a song and previewed all my dance moves be
fore asking people to sponsor me for a dollar or
two." Meade also hosted her own canning event
outside a local Safeway, and appealed to friends
outside of Stanford.
To celebrate the fundraising efforts of
dancers like Meade, Dance Marathon chairs
have planned a night full of prizes and activities.
"The top dancer and committee fundraiser
will each win a video iPod, courtesy of Apple,"
Brophy said. Other prizes include $1,000 from
STA Travel to be used on a Europe trip and gift
certificates from stores in Palo Alto and the
Stanford Bookstore.
"We've got awesome prizes for our raffles â€”
if I wasn't co-chair, I'd almost just want to dance
for a chance to win one!" joked Cooke.
In addition to prizes, one of the main fea
tures of the Dance Marathon event will be its
iPod photo contest. Dancers or visitors can get
their photo taken in the silhouette-style of re
cent i Pod commercials, and the top poses will be
used in a campus-wide marketing campaign.
Brophy and Cooke also reported that Dance
Marathon will feature many performances by
student groups, including Talisman, Swing
Time, Stanford Soul Line Dance, K-Flay and
Jack Conte.
These shows will supplement the learning
aspect of the event. The Dance Marathon team
has made HIV and AIDS education a priority,
inviting speakers from the foundation to the
event to educate dancers and spread awareness
through flier campaigns across campus.
