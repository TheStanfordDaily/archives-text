## Univ. eyes Palo Alto resevoir site Palo Alto negotiates to build new reservoir on University land 
### ANDREA FULLER STAFF WRITER 
Denying the Feb. 12 report by The San Jose Mercury
News, University officials maintain that there is no hostility
between the city of Palo Alto and Stanford over the con
struction of an emergency water reservoir on University
property.The two are currently deliberating over the specif
ic location, officials said.

The city hopes to build the underground reservoir as a
backup in the event that the Hetch Hetchy pipes shut down
in a natural disaster. City officials cited El Camino Ball Park
as their top choice due to its closeness to the water main.
The Mercury, which likened it to the previous controver
sy over trail construction through the University hills.
While it reported that Stanford had gotten its way over pub
lic demand for the trails, that is not at all what is at stake in
the reservoir debate.
Emily Harrison, assistant city manager, noted that using
this Stanford land seemed the most plausible option for the
site and that the University has been supportive.
"We really don't want to take down any buildings," she
said. "First you have to look at open land and look at where
there are connections to the water.
You have to narrow down what
makes sense. For the emergency
water supply project, we're looking at
a series of wells and a two million gal
lon reservoir for fire protection."
According to Palo Alto officials,
the purpose of the reservoir is to beef
up safety precautions for the north
ern region, which is currently under
equipped for disaster.
"The proposal is to build a large
underground tank to provide an
emergency source of water for a situ
ation like a major earthquake," said
University Director of Community
Relations Jean McCown. "The areas
to be served by it are residential
neighborhoods in the north part of
Palo Alto, the commercial area
around University Avenue and some
Stanford land in the city like the
Shopping Center and the Medical
Center area."
While the use of the ball park as
the final location remains uncertain,
the University has agreed with the
city that using Stanford land is a def
inite possibility.
"Stanford agreed with the city
that [the Ball Park] would be a suit
able location," McCown said. "Pre
cisely where in El Camino Ball Park
it might be built has not been deter
mined, although the city and Stan
ford have made different prelimi
nary suggestions. These will be stud
ied in detail in the environmental im
pact report that the City is preparing.
Once all the technical issues are un
derstood and the pros and cons of the
different options are laid out, we are
confident that Stanford and the city
can reach agreement on a good loca
tion."
Both parties are currently debat
ing where to locate the reservoir if
the park is selected, McCown ex
plained.

"The city's initial suggestion was
to put it in the middle of the park."
she said."Stanford suggested that the
city look at pushing it more towards
one end in order for both Stanford
and the city to have flexibility over
the long term for other potential
uses. For example, in the past the city
has thought about improvements to
the transit center, or possibly transit
oriented housing near the station.
According to McCown, an envi
ronmental impact report (EIR) will
analyze the environmental effects of
all the location options and help so
lidify the best choice.
Although the city clearly prefers
the El Camino Ball Park site, it is still
exploring alternative options with
the University, such as parking lots at
the Stanford Shopping Center, land
at Palo Alto High School and the
Town & Country Shopping Center.
"There are several possibilities
and all have pros and cons," Harrison
said. "The attractive part about the
Ball Park is because it's next to the
connection to the Hetch Hetchy
water line. From a cost perspective
that's a minimum amount of piping.
The disadvantage from Stanford's
perspective is that it will limit devel
opment potential for that site, but
they've been incredibly supportive
of discussions."
Officials said that the project will
remain on hold until the EIR is com
pleted.
"The EIR is going to take any
where from 8 to 12 months," Harri
son said. "We don't really know at
this point. The ball park is our most
attractive site right now, but we don't
even know where the water table is
beneath the park."
McCown said that the University
and the city expect an agreeable so
lution for the reservoir location.
"The City has been keeping Stan
ford informed as they move along
and I expect that will continue," Mc-
Cown said. "We are optimistic that a
good location can be identified and
an agreement worked out between
Stanford and the City."

where from 8 to 12 months," Harri
son said. "We don't really know at
this point. The ball park is our most
attractive site right now, but we don't
even know where the water table is
beneath the park."
McCown said that the University
and the city expect an agreeable so
lution for the reservoir location.
"The City has been keeping Stan
ford informed as they move along

good location can be identified and
an agreement worked out between
Stanford and the City."
