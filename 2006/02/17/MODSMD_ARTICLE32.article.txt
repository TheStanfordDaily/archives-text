# Stanford in the lead in race to fight poverty
## Participants can click twice a day on site every day until March 31 
### LESLIE GEORGATOS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Two clicks a day keeps world hunger at bay. At
least that is the mantra of Oxfam America's Colle
giate Click Drive, a nationwide program for college
students to raise money to fight global hunger and
poverty, running from Feb. 13 through Mar. 31.
As of Feb. 15, two days into the drive, Stanford
led the 130 participating schools in 32 states, tot
laing $208 in donations. Runner-up Brandeis Uni
versity trails with $165.25.
"The response has been even better than we ex
pected," said Eve Rips, co-hunger awareness coor
dinator for the Stanford Project on Hunger
(SPOON), the organization that runs the drive on
campus. "We raised $135 on the first day, which is
just fantastic."
Rips explained that the Collegiate Click Drive's
aims made SPOON a natural campus partner in the
effort.
"One of SPOON's goals is to raise student
awareness about global hunger, and this drive is a
very effective way of doing that," she said. "Oxfam
is a fantastic organization that pinpoints the most
pressing problems in the world."
Each visitor's click on the main page donates 25
cents from Oxfam's corporate sponsors to a loan
pool given to selected micro-credit banks. Through
these banks, the loans are distributed to impover
ished individuals around the world who want to
start their own businesses. According to the Web
site, would-be entrepreneurs with little or no collat
eral can go to these micro-lenders and get $25 to
$5,000 to start their own small enterprises.
"Even though it costs nothing to go to Poverty-
Fighters.com and click twice, it really does help — a
little money goes a long way in poverty-stricken na
tions," said co-Hunger Awareness Coordinator and
junior Gabe Recchia.

The drive's stated goal is to provide practical
help to the worlds poorest families — particularly
their female members — by raising funds for mi
crolenders. Currently, about 20 million very poor
micro-entrepreneurs around the world have access
to $4 billion in credit, according to the drive's Web
site.
One distinct feature of the program is access to
online accounts of how these micro-loans have
been used. One page tells the tale of Anwara
Khatun. whose loans allowed her to pay for her chil
dren's education, develop her land and purchase a
phone for her rural town in Bangladesh. Similar sto
ries have poured in from Albania, Indonesia and
Zimbabwe. Surprisingly, the United States is also
on the list.
"It is more personal than an ordinary anony
mous donation, because you can read about the
people whose lives you affect," Rips said.
The loan system also differs from typical dona
tions by promoting financial independence.
"Most of the people who get these loans don't
want handouts," Rips said. "Micro-loans get them
into a system that keeps them going on their own.
They keep their dignity and pride by being able to
pay them back." According to the Web site, 95 per
cent of micro-loans are repaid.
The success of this drive lies in its accessibility to
all students.
"It only takes ten seconds to go to the site, click
twice, and have the good feeling of having helped
out a charity, so I think a lot of students figure why
not'?" said Recchia. "Also, Oxfam has a good track
record of creating permanent solutions to poverty,
so the cause is among the best we could support."
Students wishing to aid the fight against global
hunger and help Stanford win the national contest
