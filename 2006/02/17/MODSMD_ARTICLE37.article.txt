# Go-Go Gadget Cheney!
## Hey, America: Don't fuck with Dick. 
### VICTOR FUSTE BETSY "THE" CONGDON INTERMISSION DICKS 
This week has been one for the history books. In a
move not seen since Aaron Burr dueled Alexander
Hamilton in 1804 in the illustrious town of Weehawken,
NJ, our very own Vice-President Dick Cheney "acci
dentally" shot and killed - wait, not yet, but the guy did
have a minor heart attack from a BB going into his heart
— Harry M. Whittington, an attorney, aged 78. In the
face.
Most people find this shooting amusing. We here at
Intermission, however, do not. We applaud the VP for
his dedication to his country in performing a vital func
tion to keeping the population of quails — and attor
neys — in Texas to a manageable level. Without him,
these flightless birds would destroy the local ecology
and inundate an already overburdened criminal justice
system. His actions should not be ridiculed, rather they
should be praised. What's more, they should be encour
aged.
We propose that Cheney be granted emergency pow
ers by Congress to search out and dispose of — single
handedly — the threats to America. However, a shot-

gun with hirdshot will not be enough
firepower for this one-man-nation-pro
tector for dealing out retribution. The
military will finally be able to put into use
their new bio-mechanical weapons, some

of which have already been in
corporated into Cheney's body.
(His pace-maker actually grants
him immortality and the ability
to shoot laser beams from his fin

gertips).
We ask, nay demand, that
Robo-Dick take charge of his 4

new mandate and eliminate
all the evil-doers, hooli
gans and corrupt

politicians
in Wash-
ingt on . i
Every man,

woman, and poultry in Con
gress needs to shape up be
fore the VP asks them on a j

special "hunting trip"
from which there is no .
return. Fear not my fel- I
low Americans, fail J

safes have been in
stalled in Robo-Dick
to prevent self-termi- 1
nation.

So look out, Dan \
Quayle, Cheney may
mistake you for a flightless
bird and shoot you.
With a shotgun.
In the face.
