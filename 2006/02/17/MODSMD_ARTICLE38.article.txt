## "Night Watch" Review. 
### JOSHUA SMITH INTERMISSION 
At Wonder Con on Saturday, the all-smiles publicity man ircgi Fox Search
light announced that we in the audience had the gteat (mis?)fort|ne of seeing
Night Watch then and there. And not a trailer or an out-of-context clip, but the
whole honkin' movie. "Are you serious," 1 thought aloud, "the highest gross
ing film in the history of Russian movie-going? Da, I'm down." Then the t.itch
they did show the movie in its entirety, but in iiber fast-forward so that the en
tirety of this derivative drivel was compete in <1 scant 90 seconds.
As it turned out, I got scarcely more out of Night Watch projected at its not -

| must haVfcjnade Night Watch during
mMflfffrt week, does an expert
job of cramming. Every kind of pop-

Goth reference conceivable makes its way into this film. There are vampires,
virgins, witches and charms. Mirrors, owls, pentagrams, crows, sunglasses,
overcoats and things inexplicably called "The Gloom" and"The Calling" play
major roles. (Just an aside: thinking about that last one, if "Wherever You Will
Go" replaced the soundtrack full of nti-metal, we might have had something
here.) As it is, however, this is all set to some apocalyptic nonsense about good
vs. evil, or as this movie labels it, Night Watch vs. the Day Watch.
The action begins with,Auton (Iftinstaptin Khabensky) visiting his friendly
neighborhood witch tQ#nake his wife miscarry, as she's carrying
someone la i ki&a.tltfnptTo frUyher once he changes his mind (this
is, apparently, a big anti s aWSr,!on movffll regardless of other moral values it ex
tols). Anton discovers he's not human, but an "Other." There are two varieties
of Others JAs tht? fitftf elaborates fully. the-Light Others "feed on the light,"
while the Datk on the darkness. jlJh... natch.
From there, Anton becomes some kind of cop for the Night Watch, and he
runs around Moscow, trying to save a boy who's being chased by unlicensed
vampires, and a virgin who's cursed bylhe Dark to bring about The Last Bat
tle. There's also something in there about a airplane full of Muscovites in a des
perate holding pattern above the city and a depressed worker at a power plant,
but who's realty counting. Logical? Not on your life. Amusing? Hell yes.
"Night makes no qualms about being merely the sum of what "The
Matrix," "Lord of the Rings" and "Ghostbusters" left on the

cutting room floor. The ltiosi; original idea was perhaps to
reverse common lore and make thevampires invisible (while
they're traveUng through the enigmatic "Gloom") but show
up in mirrors. And yet, "Night Watch" is just plain oP pop
corn Fun. It's kind of like going to Hot Topic, setting up a
lawn-chair, and amusing yourself for hours at the products i

and patrons.
"Night Watch" is also a hoot cinematographically.
Epileptics should be warned to stay away. The camera is
constantly circling around moving objects and flowing
through veins. The whole shebang is filmed in dark blues
and reds to heighten the contrived gothic feel. It's a visu
ali*triven movie, and the visuals are indeed unique, J
presenting an accomplishment for a film with a modest A

budget compared to its American counterparts. That

said, even remotely subtle here.
Maybe the best part about "Night Watch" is
that it's the first part in a trilogy. Next up: "Day >
Watch." Following that: "Dusk Watch." And
no, just like the filmmakers of Night Watch,
I'm not kidding.
