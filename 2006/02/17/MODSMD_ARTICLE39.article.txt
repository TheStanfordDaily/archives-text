# WonderCon: Better Than Getting Shot in The Face

I love comic books.
That simple declarative statement begins the retelling of the single great
est day of my life. A day filled with capes. spandex and character defining
moments for a young boy of twenty who daydreamed his childhood nway
under the fantasiesBUarger thanWeadventure stories. The chance to rub
shoulders with hfeioes, both fictional and literal — as the dedicated and cu
rious reader will soon discover — turned an ordinary Saturday into an ex
traordinary one. l \'WC; fi| I •■fj

ends and thousandsjpflans (%!f-titled "fanbqtfT like myself) willing

That's where comes in. Every year, every giek.

My story begins when my companion, l opened
the doors to WonderCon and entered a sUarige and amazing
place. As we bypassed the hundreds of eager ja line.

many of them in elaborate costumes, we were led by a legion of
Stormtroopers to our proper destination. Incidentally, the job nf
this elite squadron of soldiers (the 501st) is to shuffle peopltyj
through lines and perform community service (generally ouljp
coming out of their mother's basement for large gatherings of
nerds).
While trying to clear up some ;<?oublesonW*paperwork issues

5 (Remember that fact becaase it wffl be impor taut for the life chang
ing encounter later on), I looked to the dyfii*. and spotted a large
! mass of hair lumbering its way through the ere>wd. Could it be? Yes,
it was Peter Mayhew, the Jnan behind Chewbacca. 1 let out an ap
proving "GGGRRAAAW'WH!" and continued onto the main
show. --*m . 1 S3S
In the main show. Kevin Smith's observations of the homosex
ual undertones in "X-men" v'H should be called 'Brokeback Mu
tant'. '1 wish I could quit you, bub.'") was the prefect segue into Di
rector Bryan Singer. Ho began his discussion on his new film "Super
man Returns" nervously, bu,t quickly regained his composure when
newcomer Brandon Routh stepped out onstage, surprising every one
with an unannounced appearance. It's rare for me to lose my stoic
composure over just any ruggedly handsome man, but 1 feel I wasjas
tified in my adoration since he's FLIPPIN' SUPERMAN! 1 mean

c'mon, people! Superman! The Man of Steel! The Last Son of Kryp
ton! Standing onstagein a T-shirt! Awesome! (Aside: When Routh

mentioned that he gets a little nervous speaking in front of ginor
mous audiences, the portly guy seated behind us cooed, "Just take

your shin oftand you'll lie alright.)

So, you're probably wondering who I could have met that topped seeing Kevin
Smith. Bryan Singer AND Superman all on the same day. Normally, I would say
nobody. But today the Comic Gods and the
Literature Gods joined forces in the WF,
grealest inter-universe crossover
since "Crisis on Infinite Earths"
— by the way, if that reference
made sense, you need to start
getting out more.

liOnJHmy excitement subsided to only near-heart attack levels, 1 looked down
4'Tnv hands at the freshly signed piece of paper that rested between them. I don't
quit€7ecal3isking for an autograph or telling him how he inspired me to pursue

writing, but I walked away from that encounter with an
even greater love for comics than I had had walking into
WonderCon. My only regret, and I take this opportunity to

apologize to Mr. Chabon for my selfishness, is

. asking for it when he was clearly in family
I time. If you're reading this, sir, thank you lor
f fueling my imagination and the imaginations
f of millions of readers and if you ever feel like

shooting the breeze about The Fantas-

tic Four, Spiderm<in or the Es
|| capist, remember that 1 will al-

ways love comics, no matter
the shape, color or dimen-

sion. Just send up the ln-
I termission symbol and I'll

;ome running.

1 don't know a damn thing about comic books.
In fact, my knowledge on the subject is similar to my dear "Friend" Phoebe when she, in her won
derfully understated intelligence, wonders aloud why the last syllable of Superman and Batman isn't
pronounced the same way as that of Daily columnist David Blackman's. I'm still hazy on the answer,
but that's neither here nor there. The heart of the matter is that Intermissionary Victor Fuste took me
along to Won-' ™on, which could have been subtitled "Victor's Personal Wet Dream."
And let mc tell you, WonderCon lived up to every layperson's expectations and then some. The

whole of San Francisco's
Moscone Center was filled

with the type of people who

watch a lot of porn, and lo
and behold! There was an

entire aisle of the conven-

tion hall devoted porn

stars and their, um, films.
(It was tucked way back

there in a corner.)

...and you thought we couldn't relgle it

I was clearly

out of my element.
But two things

quickly put me
out of my un-

easiness — and
no, neither hap-

' pened to be the
Stormtroopers
working crowd con-

trol. First. was Victor's patience with my lack of expertise, walking me though comics' Gold
en, Silver and Bronze Ages, without ever sounding too patronizing, The second was meeting

Michael Chabon, the man who taught me the definition of "idolatrous" (quite literally — it's
right there in "The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay"). Anywajlat this chance meeting,

q 1 searched inside myself, discovering that perhaps that if these comic book junkies (most of whom
' did, in fact, resemble the Comic Book Store Guy of "Simpsons" tame) could appreciate legitimate
literature, then they weren't all that dweeby after all.
And then I met the guy who built an exact replica of a Ghost buster's proton pack using microscopic
pieces of fiberglass. ' .-7W I 13
But really. WonderCon was surprisingly film-oriented, and even normies like me can appreciate a
good flick. And I can do TV too, as the first major speaker of the day was television wunderkind J J.
Abrams, who, for all of his accomplishments, was asked, with the very first question, to detend Felic
ity's dubious haircut. After handling that "Trojan horse question." Abrams moved onto "Mission:
Impossible: III," a franchise he basically acknowledged has nowhere to go but up: "All you know
about the character from the first two is his parents are dead and he likes to rock climb." The clips we
got to see of the third installment delighted the legions of people too busy to tear their attention from
the "Lost" episodes playing on their iPods.

Kevin Smith took the stage next, presiding over the convention hall as some kind
of foul-mouthed tyrant. Silent Bob (aka Smith) essentially turned a publicized

Q&A session into a grandiose monologue that somehow served to
be simultaneously self-aggrandizing and self-deprecating. Smith

' commenced his routine with his rare combination of insight and
perversion, mentioning how the X-Men movies have been one long
allegory of what it's like to be gay in America. And the more 1 think
about it. the more I feel that Taciturn Robert is on to something. 1

' mean how else can you interpret Iceman's mom saying to her son,
"Have you ever tried not being a mutant?" Smith then went on to tell
of his appreciation for homosexuals, announcing that he is just "one
cock in the mouth short of being gay myself," before adding, "My gay

jokes are very unsubtle." As an ironic corollary, Smith executive pro
duced the Sundance documentary "Small Town Gay Bar." Go figure.
Taking the ruic next was the next Superman, Brandon Routh. (basider-

' ing his audience. I totally bought it when he said, "It's cool to mec t little kids
who are excited. And sometimes big kids." Well stated, Mr. Man ol Steel,
sir.

Ihe Returning Superman summed up WonderCon betted than anyone
else could have - it's aneixcuse for big kids (some of them dressed like Cap
tain America) to be excited. My eyes have been opened to an entirely new sub
culture, and, as an outsider looking in, I was truly impressed with the devotion

and passion I witnessed on the 1 ioor of the corn ention hall s< > am I going to build
on ray comic collection that now includes a signed copy ot The Escapist" No. 8

and nothing else? Shall 1 swan dive into Jay kid Silent Bob's Secret Stash? Nah,
I think I'll stick to movie reviews. WonderCon represented a level of geekdom
even I could never hope to attain.
