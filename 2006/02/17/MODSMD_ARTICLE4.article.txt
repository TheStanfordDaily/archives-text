## BROKAW SELECTION RAISES EYEBROWS Students want more input in speaker nomination process 
### SARAH BROUDY STAFF WRITER 
Last weeks announcement of Tom Brokaw
as the undergraduate ceremony Commence
ment speaker has sparked criticsm from current
seniors about the choice, as well as the speaker
nomination process as a whole.
Drawing fire from their classmates. Senior
Class Presidents Shyam Ravidran, Pamela
Rum. Kevin Gao and James Mitchell, defended

the decision and expressed their enthusiasm
about the selection.
"He has reported from around the world on
some of the past century's most
important events and will no doubt have plenty
of advice to share with our class," the presidents
wrote in a joint e-mail to the Daily.
Some seniors, including Josh Mendoza,
shared the presidents' excitement.
"Brokaw has a lot of perspective on the
world, so 1 am excited to hear what he has to say
about the world today and what he hopes col
lege graduates will do," he said.
Yet many have been less optimistic, protest
ing against a choice they deem less than moti
vational. Senior Grant Patterson even created a
group on Facebook.com called "Tom Brokaw is
the Lamest Commencement Speaker Ever," to
express his dissatisfaction.
"He was a good journalist, but it's not quite
enough," Patterson said.
Senior Dara Hazeghi agreed.
"Compared to other people we've had, he
doesn't have that much to offer," he said,
adding that he was "not impressed" with past
speeches Brokaw has made.
Patterson explained further that the ideal
Commencement speaker would have made a
more significant contribution to his or her field
of expertise.
"The personality selected should inspire
emotion, an innovator who has shown through
example," he said.
Opposition to the choice has begged a deep
er question â€” whether or not the nomination
and selection process engages adequate stu
dent input. The senior class presidents ex
plained the process.
"We opened up nominations to the entire
class, and used those results, as well as our own
research, to assemble a short, unranked list for
President Hennessy," the presidents wrote to
the Daily. Hennessy then makes the final
choice from the list.
For their part, the senior class presidents felt
that the current process allows for sufficient
student participation.
"We feel that students have a significant role
in the current selection process," the class rep
resentatives affirmed collectively.
Patterson suggested reforming the system
by creating an online voting system to make the
final selection process more democratic.
Hazeghi agreed that the process should be
more open.
"We want to know what kind of people are
being nominated and considered. The presi
dents should send us a list of the names so that
we can vote," he said.
It is doubtful, however, whether a more ac
cessible process will necessarily yield greater
participation. Some students have expressed
apathy, arguing that the speaker is only a fine
detail relative to the scale of the event.
Senior Adam Isen said he was indifferent.
"I'm sure he will be a fine commencement
speaker, but I don't care that much about the
whole thing," he said.
Isen continued by noting that the speaker
does not define the event, as some seem to be
lieve.
"It is already a significant enough event,"he
said.
