### KELLY PETERSON INTERMISSION CHERUB 
The newest exhibit at the Cantor Arts Center, "Amer
ican ABC: Childhood in 19th-century America," offers
visitors a glimpse into the depictions of young life from the
country to the classroom to the city slums. I know what
you may be thinking: "Portrayals of 19th-century chil
dren? Not my thing." Believe it or not, I didn't think it
would be my cup of tea either, and I'm flirting with an art
history major.
But if you're interested in literature, psychology, histo
ry, sociology, or are simply curious, I encourage you to
check it out (for free!). Though the exhibit is kitschy at
times and may not appeal to those looking for a more
avant-garde approach to art presentation, it offers a fasci
nating insight into the minds of people of all ages during
this era. Here, children are seen as more than just inno
cent beings — they serve as representations for the hope
of America's future.
The exhibit is set up like a classic schoolhouse, com
plete with AaßbCc-lettered borders and whitewashed
walls. A long corridor connects a series of galleries, each
focusing on a theme, such as "Daughters of Liberty."
which concentrates oil (he depiction of young girls, or
"Giildren of Bondage,* which focuses on slave children.
A multitude of poetry and anecdotes accompany the
paintings to give the visitor more than just a visual experi
ence, arid the children's books set up around the rooms
nearly steal the show. I was impressed with the first edition
copies of "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" and"The
Child's Anti-Slavery Book," one of several examples of
abolitionist propaganda focused on America's youth.
The art itself may appear laughable at first, if not com
pletely ridiculous. Most of the children appear either
rosy-cheeked and unnaturally cherubic or as shrunken

versions of adults (who end up looking like aliens — a
terrifying concept). The girls are only posed in domestic
situations, such as flower picking, sewing or taking care of
siblings.
But through these portraits, viewers begin to see life
behind the paint. We can especially imagine the hand and
the standards of the artist, attempting to recreate the
"ideal child" by fitting him into the roles that he is sup
posed to assume in later life. Exceptions to these por
trayals prove to be the most fascinating. "Snap the
Whip," one of many prints on display by Winslow Homer,
shows children participating in a countryside sport. These
boys look completely imposed, lively and full of momen
tum. "Attention, Company!" by William Harnett lacks
the haziness that is common in the collection, and shows
an African-American boy in play-soldier garb, wide-eyed
and engaging in a sort of staring contest with the audience.
My favorite additions to the collection were the pho
tographs and daguerreotypes that scatter the galleries.
Daguerreotypes are so rare that it is worth going to the
museum to get a glimpse of one, because the effects pro
duced.are somehow quite different than that of a normal
photograph. The photographs by Jacob Riis in the
"Ragamuffins" section are nearly paralyzing in their raw
portrayal of children who are barely surviving in industri
alized cities. While the other artists romanticize these
street urchins, ignoring the harshness of their situation.
Riis' photography demands attention and action.
The collection ends in a schoolroom, where visitors can
play with chalkboards, toy blocks and figurines, which my
friends flocked to like kids in a candy store. Perhaps this
was the idea. "American ABC," available until May 7, re
minds us of our own childhood experiences and recreates
this pivotal period of American history through the eyes
of its children. If anything, go to learn something or go to
play with the chalkboards.
