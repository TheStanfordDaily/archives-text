"Imagine everything you did between the r
years of 1976 and 1992." says Sunny Jacobs j
(Adelc Robbins) before giving the audience a ;
full ten seconds of silence to consider their i
life histories: graduating college, getting mar- I
ried, having children, raising children, etc. (
Or. in the case of Stanford students, being'
born and going to Stanfsitfl But then again.
Lively Arts performances tore most typically
attended by a middle-aged and over crowd
anyway.
"The Exonerated," written by Jessica
Blank and Erik Jensen and performed the
Actors' Gang, is an off-Brqadway plaf tour
ing the nation that explores the lives of six
wrongfully convicted death row inmatks and
their victimization at the Hands of a flawed
criminal justice system. It Sf politics
and reality, resulting in a production
that succeeds in moving creating
political and justice,to the
Courageous lives it depicts.

Exonerated" opens with Delbert
Tfibbs (Harold Surratt) swaggering across the
stage, spouting esoteric platitudes with a po
etic bravado, "If you dream in this world, it is
[dangerous." Blank and Jensen structure the
talay so that it concentrates on each of the six
characters individually, cutting between their
Morifcaseveral times. A> bridge these scenes.

There are many beautiful, inspiring scenes
throughout "The Exonerated." It celebrates
the perseverance of the indomitable human
spirit, speaking to the power of hope. As Del

reminds its audience that these criminals are
not merely characters, but people whojjiave

easily vilify the representatives of the crimi
nal justice system, cheapening them to two
dimensional stereotypes, such as the unfairly
obstinate judge, the ignorant hick cops or the
acareless ineffectual lawyers. Even the exon-

too removed from realtfy. conveniently dra

Instead of being trusted to come to my

Bank and Jensen mercilessly pounded it into
