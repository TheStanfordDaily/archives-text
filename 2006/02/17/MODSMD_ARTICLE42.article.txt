### MATTY SMITH INTERMISSION STONER 
Beginning in the late 60s and all
throughout the seventies. Sly & the
Family Stone cemented themselves
into one of the most important places
in rock history. Musically notable for
their revolutionary blend of styles, the
Family's most significant role has
been that of the first fully racially inte
grated (as well as gender-mixed) rock
group. Their cross-cultural impact in
cluded mixing psychedelic rock with
funk and soul, thus developing a new
sound that would influence musicians
to this day.
"Different Strokes by Different
Folks" is a tribute album to the Fami
ly Stone. But, unlike most tribute al
bums, instead of a collection of covers
by various artists, the album features
a wide range of performers playing
alongside the Family Stone's origi
nals. In some cases, as with the Roots'
version of "Star," the artist will per
form new material using the original
as a sample. In others, as with Maroon
5's "Everyday People," the artist will
simply sing along with the tracks in
their own unique style.
Unfortunately, the album does lit
tle to enhance or explain the artists'
appreciation for the Family's work,

and very little of what made Sly & a

the Family Stone's music great in

the first place survives.
The main problem is cvi-

dent from the start. The

first track of the album,
will.i.am's cover of a

"Dance to the
Music" is a sim- A

pie replay of
the original^

song
framed A

with
in- J

irusive and very obvious computer
ized beats. The effect is that the song
— already great in its own right — is
reduced to something you'd expect to
hear in a car commercial. The sense of
community and immediate urge to
move to the music that defined the
original are lost entirely —leaving
the question: Wouldn't you rather just
listen to the original? That commer
cialized effect, referring as much to its
belonging in a Hond.i ad as to the
sales-conscious motivations behind
the album, is pervasive throughout.
The Album's second track, the
aforementioned Maroon 5 cover of
"Everyday People," is a strong exam
ple of what else is wrong with the
album. Everybody recognizes the
great energy of the voices behind the
original track. So, why spoil it with the
high-pitched whininess of Maroon 5
lead singer Adam Levine? Listening
to the original tracks, it's easy to un
derstand why some sort of tribute
would be warranted, but to just sing
along does little to indicate what sort
of impact the Family had on Maroon
5 or any other group. Many of the
tracks simply add more sounds, in
struments, and voices to the classic
originals. The results are no less than
excessive and are often very distract
. ing — even comedic.

The bright spots are few and
far between, with a highlight

being Aerosmith's sing-along
k with the Family's "I Want

to Take You Higher."
Steven Tyler's distinc-

tive wailing is
k enough to war-

rant attention,
k even if very

little is
k added

to the

tunes

song's original power. Also, the silly
car ad tracks are good for a quick lis
ten if you don't pay too much atten
tion — just know that there are a lot
better tracks out there as far as getting
that computerized dance beat sound
goes.
All else that is good about the
album is in the original tracks them
selves. What makes the album as a
whole tolerable is the fact that the
original songs hold up so well today,
in terms of catchiness, soulfulness,
and intensity. Sly & the Family

Stone's music is as good today as ever,
and there's really no need to redo any
of their original songs. What that basi
cally means is that rather than buying
this album, you're better off checking
out any of the Family's greatest hits
albums that have been released
throughout the years- or, better yet,
pick up one of their original albums
from their peak years in the seventies.
Thumbs way up to all that is Sly & the
Family Stone on this album- thumbs
down to the lackluster treatment pro
vided by everyone else involved.
