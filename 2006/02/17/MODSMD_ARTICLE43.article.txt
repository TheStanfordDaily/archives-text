## Fratman meets hotchick 
### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION WONDERWOMAN 
that uhen he walked you could see his man arches pointing U>
the Promised Land. When he looked at her wtni those mteqse
eyes, she knew she wanted to show him one of her own specJaf '
abilities. She had been staring at his rippling pectorals and that
tan skin so intently that her super-hearing almost failed her
when he asked her to the party. She said yes, and now he was
standing in front of the Claw, waiting for her.
Fratman was a player. He once had his heart broken by a girl,
and pledged revenge on the female species. It wasn't that hard
in Stanfordopolis, where he could go to the Evil Epsicon Broth
ers' Super Parties every weekend, find his catch for the night
and take her back to his house. He was renowned for his ability
to cloud women's minds with mysterious liquids to the point
where they would find themselves without clothes. (Instruc
tional side note: For you mere mortals, these liquids are avail
able in less potent forms. If you tried to use Fratman's blend,
you might kill the girl/commit rape).
They loved it, especially after he told them just how beauti
ful they were. The Tongue Twister never failed. He could move
his tongue with the speed and force of a tornado. Then, after the
women were nuts over him [and his nuts], he would leave them.
When he met Hotchick, he knew she would be his greatest
conquest. She was so beautiful that she was bound to have bro
ken many hearts and headboards before. And so, enlisting the
help of the Evil Epsicon Brothers, heplanncd her destruction.
The next day, Fratman and Hotchick walked through the
Quad to the party. He realized that they had many things in
common, including their love for spandex and fighting dirty.
When they arrived at the party, they started to dance. Hotchick
had some super-moves. Fratman used his super-imagination
powers to picture her in bed.
Suddenly, Jockman swooped in from the shadows and
grabbed Hotchick. He laughed maniacally and grabbed her
badonkadonk. Fratman's jealousy sparked into the flames of a
thousand suns, but before he could come to the rescue,
Hotchick swung her hair around and whipped Jockman in the
face. Jockman fell to the floor with a BAM!
However, before she could return to Fratman, Gradman
and Mathgirl separated them once again. Gradman put his arm
around Hotchick and said "Hey baby, aren't you tired? Cause
you've been running through my mind all night long." Mean
while, "NT tihgirl went over to Fratman and spun his head with
her infinite knowledge of numbers. Hotchick punched Grad
man with a BOOM! and hack Hipped her way over to Frat
man, where she then kicked Mathgirl in the kidney.
