### PATRICK FITZGERALD MANAGING EDITOR 
Students can expect an even larger than usual
hit to their wallets soon, as the University an
nounced this week that it will raise tuition 5.75
percent for undergraduates for the 2(X)6-2(X)7
school year.
In a meeting Tliesday, the Stanford Board of
Trustees set the undergraduate tuition rate at
$32,994, up from $31,2(X) this year.The Board also
increased the standard undergraduate room rate
from $5,276 to $5,571, and standard board from
$4,656 to $4,796 â€” increases of 5.6 percent and 3
percent, respectively.
This year's tuition shift of 5.75 percent repre
sents a marked increase from years past. The
Board of Trustees increased tuition 4.5 percent in
2(X)3 and 2(XH, with a 5 percent increase in 2(X)2.
Room and board increases have shown more vari
ation over the years.
According to The Stanford Report, only 60

percent of the costs
of undergraduate
education are cov
ered by tuition. As
one of the few pri
vate universities with
a need-blind admis
sions policy, the Uni
versity prides itself
on its ability to en
sure that students
are accepted regard
less of their ability to
pay.
"We are committed

to continuing Stanford's tradition of excellence in
education and research." said Board of TYustees
Chair Burton McMurtry. it was Jane and Leland
Stanford's intent that the university admit stu
dents based on their abilities, promise and willing
ness to work hard and not on whether or not they
could pay the cost of tuition. Stanford remains a
place where a worthy student can rise through his
or her own efforts."
