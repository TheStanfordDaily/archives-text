### PATRICK FITZGERALD MANAGING EDITOR 
Students can expect an even larger than usual
hit to their wallets soon, as the University an
nounced this week that it will raise tuition 5.75
percent for undergraduates for the 2(X)6-2(X)7
school year.
In a meeting Tliesday, the Stanford Board of
Trustees set the undergraduate tuition rate at
$32,994, up from $31,2(X) this year.The Board also
increased the standard undergraduate room rate
from $5,276 to $5,571, and standard board from
$4,656 to $4,796 â€” increases of 5.6 percent and 3
percent, respectively.
This year's tuition shift of 5.75 percent repre
sents a marked increase from years past. The
Board of Trustees increased tuition 4.5 percent in
2(X)3 and 2(XH, with a 5 percent increase in 2(X)2.
Room and board increases have shown more vari
ation over the years.
According to The Stanford Report, only 60

percent of the costs
of undergraduate
education are cov
ered by tuition. As
one of the few pri
vate universities with
a need-blind admis
sions policy, the Uni
versity prides itself
on its ability to en
sure that students
are accepted regard
less of their ability to
pay.
"We are committed

to continuing Stanford's tradition of excellence in
education and research." said Board of TYustees
Chair Burton McMurtry. it was Jane and Leland
Stanford's intent that the university admit stu
dents based on their abilities, promise and willing
ness to work hard and not on whether or not they
could pay the cost of tuition. Stanford remains a
place where a worthy student can rise through his
or her own efforts."

According to the University, 76 percent of under
graduates receive some form of financial aid from
internal and external sources, with 46 percent receiv
ing need-based assistance directly from Stanford.
General graduate student tuition also increased
5.75 percent to $32.W4. Specialized graduate tuition
varies according to each school, with engineering
and law students experiencing increases of 5.75 per
cent. while School of Medicine tuitions rates rose
just 4 percent.The Graduate School of Business uses
a new set-tuition structure in which MBA students
pay the same rate each of their two years at the GSB.
Incoming MBA students will pay $43,380, while cur

rent students pay $41,340.
Three new trustees, James Canales Jr., Lauren
Dachs and Bruce Dunlevie, were elected to the
Board earlier this week, the University announced.
Canales, who recently served as chair of the Stanford
Alumni Association,earned both his undergraduate
and master's degrees at Stanford. Dachs, also a Stan

board of visitors for the Freeman Spogli Institute for
International Studies. Dunlevie co-founded Bench

and was a member of the Parents Program Adviso

"I'm extremely pleased that Jim, Laurie and
Bruce have agreed to serve as trustees," McMurtry
said."Each has long and close relationships with var
ious parts of Stanford, and I know they will make sig
nificant contributions to Stanford governance."
