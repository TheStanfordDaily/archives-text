## Tree admits intoxication, apologizes Denies drinking at game, as national media reports 
### DANIEL NOVINSON REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITORS 
Wednesday. The Daily broke the news
that the Stanford Band terminated Erin
Lashnits' run as Tree after she violated the
Band's no-alcohol policy during last Thurs
day's 65-62 loss at UC-Berkeley. Yesterday,
Lashnits apologized for being intoxicated
at the game, but denied a claim in the San
Francisco Chronicle that she had been
drinking at the game.
"She was taking drinks inside the tree,"
Cal assistant athletic director Kevin Klint
worth told the Chronicle. "The officers
could see the flask through the costume."
"I did not have a flask." Lashnits said. "I
was not drinking at the stadium. 1 did not
drink from a flask. I don't know how many
other ways to put it. 1 would never bring in
a flask to Cal's stadium. I'm not that stu
pid."
The Chronicle also reported that police
cited Lashnits, a claim that she denies.
"I was not cited, said Lashnits, 22. a
coterminal student in biological sciences
and former varsity diver. "1 was not arrest
ed. Nothing legal [in nature] happened.

Behind security, Erin Lashnits peeks out of her costume shortly after blowing a . 157
at halftime of men's basketball's 65-62 loss to UC-Berkeley last Thursday.
They simply asked me to take my
costume off and then escorted me
into the stands."
Lashnits registered a BAC of. 157
at halftime, nearly twice the legal
limit of .08. Although Lashnits is of
legal drinking age, she was in viola
tion of the zero-tolerance alcohol
policy the University imposed on the
Band in 2003.
"I made a bad decision and I wish
I could take it back,"said Lashnits, as

quoted by the Chronicle. "I'd like to
put this whole thing behind me. The
last thing 1 want to do is hurt the
Stanford Band."
While the incident at Berkeley is
the event that ultimately led to Lash
nits' dismissal — and the one that
has garnered the lion's share of na
tional headlines in a story that has
made ESPN, and newspapers, radio
and television outlets in every cor
ner of the country — Lashnits and
band members alike insist that it
was not the sole cause. Band Public
Relations Director Sam Urmy
added attendance, punctuality and
"attitude to her position" as chronic
problems.
