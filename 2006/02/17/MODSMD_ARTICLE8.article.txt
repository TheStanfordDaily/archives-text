## Judge demands wiretapping info

WASHINGTON (AP) —A federal judge ordered
the Bush administration on Thursday to release docu
ments about its warrantless surveillance program or spell
out what it is withholding, a setback to efforts to keep the
program under wraps.
At the same time, the Republican chairman of the
Senate Intelligence Committee said he had worked out
an agreement with the White House to consider legisla
tion and provide more information to Congress on the
eavesdropping program. The panel's top Democrat, who
has requested a full-scale investigation, immediately ob
jected to what he called an abdication of the committee's
responsibilities.
U.S. District Judge Henry Kennedy ruled that a pri
vate group — the Electronic Privacy Information Cen
ter — will suffer irreparable harm if the documents it
has been seeking since December are not processed
promptly under the Freedom of Information Act. He
gave the Justice Department 20 days to respond to the
group's request.
"President Bush has invited meaningful debate about
the wireless surveillance program," Kennedy said. "That
can only occur if DOJ processes its FOIA requests in a
timely fashion and releases the information sought."
Justice Department spokesman Charles Miller said
no decision had been made about the government's next
steps.
On Capitol Hill, lawmakers also have been seeking
more information about Bush's program that allowed
the National Security Agency to eavesdrop — without
court warrants —on Americans whose international
calls and e-mails it believed might be linked to al-Qaida.
After a two-hour closed-door session. Senate Intelli
gence Chairman Pat Roberts, R-Kan., said the commit
tee adjourned without voting on whether to open an in
vestigation. Instead, he and the White House confirmed
that they had an agreement to give lawmakers more in
formation on the nature of the program. The White
House also has committed to make changes to the cur
rent U.S. law. according to Roberts and White House
deputy press secretary Dana Perino.
"I believe that such an investigation at this point ...
would be detrimental to this highly classified program
and efforts to reach some accommodation with the ad
ministration," Roberts said.

Still, he promised to consider the Democratic request
for a vote in a March 7 meeting.
Earlier. Bush spokesman Scott McClellan left the im
pression that any deal with Congress would not allow for
significant changes. He said the White House continued
to maintain that Bush does not need Congress' approval
to authorize the warrantless eavesdropping and that the
president would resist any legislation that might compro
mise the program. "There's kind of a high bar to over
come," McClellan said.
West Virginia Sen. Jay Rockefeller, the Intelligence
Committee's top Democrat, said the White House had
applied heavy pressure to committee Republicans to
prevent them from conducting thorough oversight. He
complained that Roberts didn't even allow a vote on a
proposal for a 13-point investigation that would include
the program's origin and operation, technical aspects
and questions raised by federal judges.
Rockefeller said the Senate cannot consider legisla
tion because lawmakers don't have enough information.
"No member of the Senate can cast an informed vote on
legislation authorizing or conversely restricting the

NSA's warrantless surveillance program, when they fun
damentally do not know what they are authorizing or re
stricting," he said.
It remains unclear what changes in law may look like.
Roberts indicated it may be possible "to fix" the 1978
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to authorize the
president's program. Perino said the White House con
siders suggestions put forward by Sen. Mike DeWine, R-
Ohio, the starting point, particularly his proposal to cre
ate a special subcommittee on Capitol Hill that would
regularly review the program.
DeWine's proposal would authorize Bush's program
and exempt it from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act. That law set up a special court to approve warrants
for monitoring inside the United States for national se
curity investigations.
Yet Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman
John Warner, R-Va., left the closed hearing saying he has
been working on a different legislative change to FISA.
"It seems that's a logical place to start, to upgrade FISA
given the extraordinary expanse of technology in the 30
years that have lapsed," he said.
