# U.S. prison must close, Annan says
## White House spokesman rejects U.N. call for Guantanamo Bay shutdown

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Thursday said the United States should
close the prison at Guantanamo Bay for terror suspects
as soon as possible, backing a key conclusion of a U.N.-
appointed independent panel.
White House spokesman Scott McClellan rejected
the call to shut the camp, saying the military treats all de
tainees humanely and "these are dangerous terrorists
that we're talking about."
The panel's report, released Thursday in Geneva,
said the United States must close the detention facility
"without further delay" because it is effectively a tor
ture camp where prisoners have no access to justice.
Annan told reporters he didn't necessarily agree with
everything in the report, but he did support its opposi
tion to people being held "in perpetuity" without being
charged and prosecuted in a public court. This is "some
thing that is common under every legal system," he said.
"I think sooner or later there will be a need to close
the Guantanamo (camp), and I think it will be up to the
government to decide, and hopefully to do it as soon as
is possible," the secretary-general told reporters.
The 54-page report summarizing an investigation by
five U.N. experts, accused the United States of practices
that "amount to torture" and demanded detainees be
allowed a fair trial or be freed. The panel, which had
sought access to Guantanamo Bay since 2002, refused a
U.S. offer for three experts to visit the camp in Novem
ber after being told they could not interview detainees.
Annan said the report by a U.N.-appointed inde
pendent panel was not a U.N. report but one by individ
ual experts. "So we should see it in that light," he said.
U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the report will
be presented to the U.N. Commission of Human Rights,
which appointed the panel, when it convenes on March
13 in Geneva.
Manfred Nowak, the UN. investigator for torture
who was one of the panel's experts, told The Associat
ed Press in Geneva that the detainees at Guantanamo
"should be released or brought before an independ
ent court."
