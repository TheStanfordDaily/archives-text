### STEVE QUINN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
DALLAS (AP) — Radio Shack Corp.'s embattled
president and CEO, David Edmondson, resigned Mon
day following questions about his resume's accuracy.
The Fort Worth electronics retailer said that its
board accepted his resignation and has promoted
Claire Babrowski — executive vice president and chief
operating officer — to acting CEO.
Leonard Roberts, Radio Shack's chairman and Ed
mondson's predecessor as CEO, said the move was nec
essary to restore the company's credibility.
"One of the most important things we have as a cor
poration is integrity and trust and we know we have to
restore that back to the public," he said.
Edmondson issued a brief statement Monday but
did not discuss his resume.
"For the last 11 years, it has been my privilege to be
associated with Radio Shack," he said. "At this time the
board and I have agreed that it is in the best interest of
the company for new leadership to step forward so that
our turnaround plan has the best possible chance to suc
ceed. as I know it will."
Edmondson's troubles began last TUesday when er
rors in his resume were reported by the Fort Worth Star-
Telegram. The company's board said it stood behind its
CEO. a decision Roberts said he now regrets.
On Wednesday, Edmondson said he took responsibil
ity for the errors. Separately, Radio Shack said it would
hire outside lawyers to investigate errors in Edmondson's
resume, including claims that he earned two college de
grees for which the school he attended has no records.
That investigation won't continue since Edmondson
quit, the company said. Edmondson, 46, joined Ra
dio Shack in 1994 and had been CEO since May.
Edmondson had claimed that he received degrees in
theology and psychology from Pacific Coast Baptist Col
lege in California, which moved in 1998 to Oklahoma
and renamed itself Heartland Baptist Bible College.
The school's registrar told the Star-Telegram that
records showed Edmondson completed only two se
mesters and that the school never offered degrees in
psychology.
