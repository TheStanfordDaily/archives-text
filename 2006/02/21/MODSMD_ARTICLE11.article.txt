## Best jobs guaranteed 
### 
See, it's all very simple. To get a job you
should do some sort of internship. To
get an internship, you should have
some sort of prior experience. To gain ex
perience, you should have had some sort
of job.
Of course, as soon as you take that final
exam for that final course or write that one
last long paper known as the dissertation,
companies will come begging for you to
work for them. Of course, don't deign to
apply for those mediocre paying jobs, as a
six digit salary minimum is what you de
serve and should demand. Of course, one
look at that Stanford studded resume and
all companies you apply to will invite you
for interviews. Of course, interviews will
be a mere formality — essentially an occa
sion for the interviewer to express his awe
at your stellar academic career and how
honored he would be if you consent to
work for him. Of course, moon is made of
green cheese and fishes go biking on
Mount Everest.
Your first step is to complete a resume.
All you have to do is explain in detail your
objective for applying (don't make it too
specific or too general), your entire educa
tional background, all of your academic
awards and honors (if being the honor stu
dent of the month in your middle school is
good enough for your dad's car bumper,
it's good enough for your resume), job ex
periences emphasizing what the main
challenges were, whom you worked with
(provide small bios), what your specific
contributions were and all the other ex
tracurricular activities that demonstrate
all your leadership, team work and inde
pendent thinking capabilities.
Having founded some successful start
ups helps to get you noticed, but a few
world saving inventions may also work.
Olympic gold medals are particularly
good for demonstrating a well rounded
personality. All of this should be on one
side of the page and no, you can not use
electron beam lithography You may have
noticed that whenever you do something
worthwhile, you are making the resume
writing process difficult for yourself, so
please be advised against gaining too
many good experiences.
You can write the resume in either
chronological or functional format. The
chronological format will list your most ir
relevant childhood experiences at the top,
while the functional format is too confus
ing for most employers. You should ex
plain what job you were previously doing,
and if it was really as nice as you describe
it, why would you rather not continue
doing that. You can post your resume on
the company Web sites where your resume
will easily pop out from the hundreds of
resumes posted everyday.
Interview calls are sure to come. If you
get too many refusals just send them back
to hiring managers thanking them for their
interest in rejecting your resume but as
you have limited number of positions
available for resume rejects, you will not
be able to accommodate them this year.
Next, you should go shopping for your
interview dress. The dress code on inter
view day for the males of the species is fol
lowed more rigorously than in Tibetan
monasteries — dark blue suits, white
shirts, red tie and black shoes. While fe
males may enjoy some freedom of choice
in sartorial dimensions, they still have to
look in shape, and if you can do without
breathing for a day, stuffing yourself into
half-size clothes is the fastest way to
achieve the goal. During the interview be
relaxed but alert; make eye contact but
don't look menacingly into the interview
er's eyes all the time; rehearse your an
swers but sound spontaneous; know
everything about the company and still
ask intelligent questions, bring up your
own personality but tailor it to the inter
viewers taste; show a sense of humor but
don't sound too glib.
Make sure you sprinkle words and
phrases like dynamic, entrepreneurial, en
joying challenges and goal driven etc in
your conversations. You just have to convey
that you are honestly passionate about the
particular job, and this is a skill you will ac
quire once you honestly practice conveying
your honest passion for different jobs.
To paraphrase George Burns,"Honesty
is the key to success in interviews. Once
you can fake it, you have got it done."
