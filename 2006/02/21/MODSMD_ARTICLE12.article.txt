# Dating 101: graduate students and their love lives

### MIMA MOHAMMED DESK EDITOR 
Last winter quarter, Sex and Lovein Modern So
ciety. taught by Sociology !*ntlla England,
sought to explore the love lifes (or lack there
of) of Stanford undergraduates. Students en
rolled in Sociology 123 were required to inter
view a fellow undergraduate about their love life. The
data collected was from a rather small, nonrandom sam
ple of undergraduates students and showed that there is
dating between undergraduates, although it can be few
and far between. Also, data demonstrated that many
Stanford students had engaged in the phenomenon of
the "hookup", which was more common than dating on
campus.
However, the relationships of undergraduate students
at Stanford can often be radically different from those of
graduate students, who are a bit older, have been in the
workplace and who are looking to settle down with their
future spouse.
Here are the thoughts of some graduate students on
dating and relationships at Stanford concerning graduate
students.
"So, I would say that people in grad school who are
here short-term, definitely want to have more fun and
can't really afford to commit for the most part," says grad
uate student Alexandru Ene. are here
long-term, really don't want to go through the whole
thing alone, so they try to find someoneun their first one
to two years here at Stanford. After that, they either stick
with that person or sometimes just give up dating alto
gether because there is a lot of pressure to spend time
doing research as opposed to going to social events and
finding someone to date. This happens generally starting
3rd year and up — you stop seeing these people at parties
around campus."
Some graduate students, though, say they feel under
graduate and graduate dating is more similar than differ
ent.
"Dating is very individualistic, and 1 think graduate
and undergraduate students are often looking for the
same things, namely to spend time with a person you
enjoy being around "says graduate student Maria Spelet
ter. "There are people looking only for a physical rela
tionship on both graduate and undergraduate levels, and
there are people looking for longer-term relationships. As
an undergraduate, you are aware your time with the other
person is short, but that doesn't really change with gradu
ate school as many graduate students are master's stu
dents and are only on campus for one or two years, and
although doctoral students are around a bit longer, both
people are usually interested in pursuing a career which
can make staying together difficult. I guess grad students
stereotypically party less than undergrads (although I'm
not so sure that claim is true), so grad students may have
fewer one-nighters." v
Other students comment on the livelihood of dating
within a respective department.
"As an undergraduate, everyone seemed like a class
mate whether they were in your degree program or not,"
says graduate student Rachel Weinstein. "As a graduate,
there's a distinction between friends outside of the de
partment and those in the department who seem more
like coworkers than classmates. Since the people in the
department are those with which you spend the most
time, it can make dating difficult if you don't want to go
out with them in the same way you wouldn't want to date
in the workplace, or if you do go out with them and then
have a messy breakup. So. finding people to date takes a
lot more effort since you then have to look outside your
usual social circle."
"I'd say that you have less opportunity to meet people

outside your
department in grad school than in undergrad,"
says graduate student Paul Gurney. "Also, people
seem more focused on their work in grad school. 1 don't
know too many grad students who are dating with 'mar
riage on the mind/ they're far more focused on getting
through their program requirements."
Additionally, the predominance of males to females in
graduate school may skew the dating scene.
"I think, like anybody, grads are looking to find the
right person at the right time," says graduate student
Heather Farkas. "One major difference arises from the
demographics of the grad student population; across the
university, the grad population is two-thirds male, so
that makes things more lopsided than most undergrad
situations."
Though some graduate students are not looking for
commitment when they start dating, the thought of mar

riage looming in the future does play a role in graduate
student lives.
"From what I've witnessed,graduate students tend to
invest more in long-term relationships than undergrad
uates," says graduate student Andy Sadhwani. "I've ac
tually met several married couples who met each other
as graduate students at Stanford. However, many grad
uate students are just looking for dating/activity part
ners for fun in the city or around campus. My sisters
have warned me that my parents are looking for a po
tential wife for me by the time I graduate. Knowing my
parents. I had better get on the ball before that hap
pens!"

department in grad school than in undergrad,"
says graduate student Paul Gurney. "Also, people
seem more focused on their work in grad school. 1 don't
know too many grad students who are dating with 'mar
riage on the mind/ they're far more focused on getting
through their program requirements."
Additionally, the predominance of males to females in
graduate school may skew the dating scene.
"I think, like anybody, grads are looking to find the
right person at the right time," says graduate student
Heather Farkas. "One major difference arises from the
demographics of the grad student population; across the
university, the grad population is two-thirds male, so
that makes things more lopsided than most undergrad
situations."
Though some graduate students are not looking for
commitment when they start dating, the thought of mar

riage looming in the future does play a role in graduate
student lives.
"From what I've witnessed,graduate students tend to
invest more in long-term relationships than undergrad
uates," says graduate student Andy Sadhwani. "I've ac
tually met several married couples who met each other
as graduate students at Stanford. However, many grad
uate students are just looking for dating/activity part
ners for fun in the city or around campus. My sisters
have warned me that my parents are looking for a po
tential wife for me by the time I graduate. Knowing my
parents. I had better get on the ball before that hap
pens!"
