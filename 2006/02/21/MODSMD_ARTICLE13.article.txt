# Students tackle Ironman triathlon competition
## 
### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
"Swim. Bike. Run. Repeat.'This bumper
sticker phrase on the car of Tom Lee, a
fourth-year electrical engineering doctoral
student, sums up his daily routine since he
began training for this June's Ironman com
petition in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Lee will
be joined by five eight fellow members of
the triathlon team in completing a 2.4-mile
swim, 112-mile bike ride, and 26.2-mile run;
all eight student athletes are members of
the Stanford Triathlon Team.
According to Triathlon Team Head
Coach Sherry Smith, who will also be partic
ipating in the Ironman. the athletes have
eight THathlon Team workouts as well as a
long slow distance run each week. In addi
tion, the eight graduate students are doing
long-weekend workouts with Team Sheep
er, a group training specifically for Ironman
Coeur d'Alene (IMCDA).
"The experience is described as 'once in
a lifetime,' but really such an experience
cannot be described," Smith says."The mix
ture of emotions before, during and imme
diately after the Ironman can be so over
whelming that athletes are known to get
post-Ironman blues after the race. More
over. the opportunity to train with a larger
group helps define the journey for most of
the athletes."
Smith hopes that the Triathlon Team
IMCDA participants gain respect for them
selves and others from the experience.

"It takes a tremendous amount of jug
gling to prioritize the training for an Iron
man," notes Smith, a certified USA
Triathlon Coach."While it can be a compro
mise, often the associated focus and disci
pline and good feeling from a good workout
allow one to excel in other areas of their life
at the same time."
Most of the graduate student athletes
will he racing in their very first Ironman
competition.Third-year electrical engineer
ing doctoral student Filip Crnogorac is one.
He decided to compete in IMCDA because
he wanted another challenge.
"I know working to get a Ph.D. is a chal
lenge enough, but I guess I needed to dis
solve the academic pursuit with something
completely different." Crnogorac says.
"More crucially, I found a rather strong and
supportive group of people on the Stanford
Triathlon Team that are all committed to the
goal. And I also got the Ironman 'bug' - just
the sheer enormity of the task made me
agree to take on such a crazy idea."
One of the Stanford IMCDA competi
tors, Kendall Wu, a postdoctoral fellow in
the department of developmental biology
and Triathlon Team treasurer, began com
peting in triathlons back in 1998.
"By far the accomplishment I am most
proud of is the first Ironman I ever did in
Florida in 2(HX)." Wu says."I learned a great
deal about myself both mentally and physi
cally in the process of preparing for the race.
And when you cross the finish line in your
first Ironman, there is no greater feeling of

achievement, exhilaration, and relief - all at
the same time. In fact. I was so excited about
the race that I went back the next year and
did the same race again."
Wu's has not competed since that 2(H) 1
race, but partially due to his teammates sup
port. he has decided to race again in 2(M)6.
Since last fall. Wu has been developing a
base level of fitness by doing longer work
outs at a lower intensity, which is intended
to prepare his body for more specific and in
tense workouts starting in March.
"Having members of the Triathlon Club
around to train with and support me is a fan
tastic opportunity." Wu says. "It's hard to go
for 4-to-5-hour bike rides and then run for
one to three afterwards all by your
self. I do not think I would have stayed in
the sport for as long as I have if it wasn't for
the people. Also, I have learned a lot about
myself since my last Ironman five years ago,
so this June I hope to improve on my past
performance."
Wu says he firmly believes that anyone
can do an Ironman.
"While there is obviously a physical
component to an Ironman, i think most
people would be surprised at how much of it
is mental," Wu says. "Part of the journey to
becoming an Ironman is learning about our
selves and overcoming both the physical
and mental obstacles. Another great thing
about triathlons in general is that you can ei
ther come from a background of one of the
sports or come from a background of ab
solutely nothing. Because triathlon involves

three different sports, someone who is great
at one of the sports may not be as good at
the other two. And even if you don't have
experience in any of the three, you will still
be fine."
Stanford is part of the West Coast Colle
giate Triathlon Conference, which hosts a
series of races, of which the Treeathlon is
one. The Conference Championships is on
March 11 in San Luis Obispo, CA. and the
Collegiate National Championship is on
April 22 in Reno. NV. Recently. 39 mem
bers of the Triathlon Team completed a
half-marathon in San Francisco on Feb. 5.
On Sunday, Feb. 26. the Triathlon Team will
host the second-annual Stanford
Treeathlon with a 500-meter swim, 20-kilo
meter bike ride and 5-kilometer run.To vol

"Most of my friends think I'm crazy,"
says Thomas Lee. "To be honest, if you
asked me a year ago if I'd ever do an Iron
man, I'd say 'No way.' But as I became
more involved with the sport and my
strength and endurance improved, it
seemed like the natural next step. I get to
train with other Stanford students during
the week, and on the weekends I get to
meet other, more experienced tri-athletes
and learn from them. I'm really looking for
ward to the rest of the training - it's going to
be a lot of fun."
