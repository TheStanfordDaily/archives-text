## Editorial National Engineers Week should prompt reflection 
### 
Feb. 19-25 is National Engineers Week,
and what better time is there for Stan
ford engineers to reexamine their
field?
It's an exciting time to be an engineer.
Engineers are discovering broader applica
tions of their work, especially as the lines
that separate engineering from the pure sci
ences begin to blur. In particular,given their
access to high-quality technical training and
close links with industry leaders, engineer
ing majors at Stanford benefit from the in
creasingly interdisciplinary approach to en
gineering.
But amid all this excitement, engineers
face more challenges in their jobs. Not all of
these challenges have to do with the techni
cal aspects of the discipline. As the engineer
ing field grows larger, engineers need to con
cern themselves not only with mass balances
and partial differential equations, but also
with the broader national and global impli
cations of their actions.
As a group, engineers have higher start
ing salaries than most other majors and may
face greater pressures to secure high-paying
jobs at the end of their undergraduate or
graduate careers. Also, engineering students
are not being exposed to a diversity of serv
ice opportunities, due to their heavy course
load.
There is nothing intrinsically wrong with
being technically adept and commanding a
high pay; after all, a laborer is worthy of his
hire. However, we are concerned that there
is a lack of support for engineers who wish to
explore social work or other pursuits that lie
beyond traditional engineering careers.
More needs to be done to integrate Stan
ford's prospective engineers into a larger
student community and into the global com
munity as well.
Fewer requirements, greater flexibility
By nature, engineering is a highly special
ized discipline that has a tendency to be
come cloistered and parochial. Engineering
departments routinely demand more than
100 units of coursework to satisfy curricular
requirements. Many of these requirements
are in math and science classes; other than
one Technology in Society requirement,
most engineers are not required by their ma
jors to take classes outside their discipline.
Engineers need to be encouraged to en
roll in courses outside of their major, but the

solution is not to make those classes part of
the already onerous major requirements. In
stead. Stanford's engineering curricula need
to be made more flexible. Students need to
be encouraged to cross-register in non-tech
nical classes. They need to be supported in
their ventures into a liberal arts education.
More support lor overseas programs
Engineers also need to be encouraged to
participate in overseas programs, if they are
to become connected to a larger world. In
general, there are some "engineer-friendly"
programs in the Bing Overseas Studies Pro
gram. but most programs are impossible to
fit into an engineers' schedule. Wherever
possible.classes should be offered more than
once a year, to accommodate a variety of
four-year plans.
Increased opportunities for
service-in-the-major
ITie School of Engineering should work
to devote more resources to encourage engi
neers to participate in a variety of socially re
sponsible activities.This could be introduced
as part of a service-in-the-major initiative
that the Board first proposed in a previous
editorial ("Keeping the dream alive once the
Bubble pops." Feb. 16).
Admittedly, there are more service op
portunities for students in the Civil and En
vironmental Engineering department than
in other engineering departments. Never
theless, we feel a need for engineers to get
more involved. There are many opportuni
ties—such as teaching math and science to
underprivileged children—that prospective
engineers can participate in.
Service opportunities can be hard to
come by for engineers who also need to con
tend with weekly problem sets that can take
up to 20 hours a week to complete. That is
why the individual engineering departments
must not impose community service as an
additional curricular requirement on top of
an already heavy course load. Instead, de
partments must provide a great deal of sup
port for engineering majors in encouraging
them to explore service-learning opportuni
ties.
Engineers do great work that can some
times go unnoticed. This week, engineers
should take some time to reflect on their en
deavors and to think about how they can
contribute in meaningful ways to society.
