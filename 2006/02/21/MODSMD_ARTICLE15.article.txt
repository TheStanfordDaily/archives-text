# Decisions, decisions...
## 
### 
As a college student, you are faced
with difficult choices on a daily basis.
Should you declare Econ or PoliSci
as your major? Should you call the guy you
met last week or wait for him to call you?
Should you order chicken fingers or a
smoothie at Late Night?
But one particularly tricky dilemma with
which every college student struggles on a
daily basis is the decision of whether to actu
ally get out of bed when the alarm goes off or
to hit the snooze button one more time (or
several more times) and spend an extra hour
with your pillow instead of with your profes
sor. On one hand, you're paying thousands
of dollars for the opportunity to take classes
at Stanford. On the other hand, you're in the
middle of a dream about the guy who sits in
front of you in lecture and are interacting
with him more in your dream than you
would be if you actually went to class.
Everyone has those mornings when —
only vaguely aware of the fact that your
roommate has already showered, dressed,
had breakfast, finished a problem set and re
turned a call to her mom — you are about as
likely to move as your Great-Uncle Ned
after a Thanksgiving Day of nothing but food
and football. You lie there thinking, well, if I
get up now I could be ready and at class on
time for once, but chances are that the pro
fessor won't start lecturing right away any
way, so I can give myself another five min
utes. Ten minutes later when you wake up
from the halfway-slumber you slipped into,
you tell yourself that you can still make it if
you put off showering until after class. Ten
minutes later when you wake up again, you
decide that you're in the mood for breakfast,
so you head down to the dining hall and
make yourself a waffle. And while you're
there you might as well grab the New York
Times so you can catch up on what's going on
outside of the Stanford bubble.
By the time you've finished the cross
word puzzle and several hundred calories of
deliciousness, you realize that, oops, your
class is halfway over. Since you don't want to
be the kid who strolls in for the last five min
utes of class, you just shrug, cook up another
waffle and decide that you'll try again to
morrow.
Really, though, you know that tomorrow
you will do exactly the same thing you did
today, except you might go for a bagel with
cream cheese instead of a waffle. Think back

to the last time you had a really great day. Did
it start with a 9 a.m. lecture? If so, I hope you
have some better days coming down the road.
Missing class to do more important things
(i.e. sleeping.eating or lying out in the sun) is
a perfectly legitimate choice, one that some
students — especially freshmen who are
used to being the model students in their
high schools — are often hesitant to make.
(Perhaps they are afraid that their profes
sors will take their absence personally, but
consider the following: A student who
makes the decision to skip class is simply dis
interested in the subject. However, a student
who goes to class and then proceeds to fall
asleep, check his e-mail or doodle in his
notebook — I spend boring lectures itemiz
ing my to-do list — must have wanted to
come to class in the first place, so his apathy
can only be blamed on the professor who is
teaching on that particular day.)
It seems that people too easily forget that
happiness is arguably the most useful part of
a college education. What will make you
happier: sitting through yet another class
where you don't learn anything (regardless
of whether the reason is a bad lecture or the
fact that you stayed up watching Family Ciuy
until 5 in the morning and now can't keep
your eyes open) or getting an extra hour of
sleep so that you'll be well rested for
tonight's Seinfeld marathon? As a general
rule, happiness should only come second
during finals week.
So, when you're asking yourself whether
to stay wrapped up in your warm, soft blan
ket or to drag yourself out of bed only to
later fall asleep cramped in a seat in Kresge,
choose wisely.This could be the most impor
tant decision you make today.
Unless, of course, you order something
from Late Night.
