						guide to effective terrorism?

### 
It's tough being a terrorist these days. Not
only do citizens regularly leave their
homes without gas masks, but they even
continue to enter skyscrapers and fly in com
mercial aircrafts with reckless abandon. And
while none of your carefully planned, anti-in
fidel violence has sparked a whit of fear
among the U.S. public, some badly drawn
Danish cartoons have your own people up in
arms. Sadly, it seems that the terrorist cause is
lost on the masses in this age of poor citizen
ship and apathetic ignorance. Do not fret
though — there is still hope for those who
wish to strike fear and loathing in the hearts
of freedom-lovers everywhere (except in Las
Vegas, they already have enough of that
there).
If A 1 Qaeda really wanted to piss people
off, the first step would be to bomb Disney
land. If I were a kid and I found out that the
terrorists had just bombed the living shit out
of Mickey Mouse, I would be screaming at
my parents to hand me an AK-47 and ship me
to Iraq (which is, I hear, where all the terror
ists live). If you are honest with yourself, you
too will admit that you care much more
about Disneyland than you ever did about
the World Trade Center. If you are an eco
nomics major and think otherwise, consider
the fact that there are many financial centers
all around the globe, but there is only one
"Happiest Place on Earth."
Even when people visited New York City,
going to the World Trade Center was never
really that high on the list of things to do —
more quintessential NYC activities like
watching a Broadway musical or buying co
caine always took precedence. Going to Dis

neyland, on the other hand, is some sort of
American rite of passage. As a child, you
were a huge loser if you hadn't taken your
picture with an illegal immigrant hiding from
the deportation authorities in a cartoon
mouse suit. Bombing Disneyland would
show the American people that the terrorists
mean business.
But even the most shocking of news sto
ries lose their impact over time and, after all.
Universal Studios and Six Flags hold a spe
cial place in the hearts of the United States as
well. The terrorists will have to follow up the
bombing with a media stunt guaranteed to
spark outrage.
The obvious next step, then, would be to
hold a gay marriage between two prominent
terrorists. Ideally, Al Qaeda would break
Saddam Hussein out of prison to get him
hitched with Osama Bin Laden, but anyone
who is vaguely Middle Eastern and has a
beard should do. The wedding guest list
should include Elton John, Boy George, and
those five guys from "Queer Eye for the
Straight Guy." Phallic objects should feature
prominently in the wedding decorations and
clips from "Brokeback Mountain" should
play continuously in the background. No les

bians, though — people actually like les
bians.
With Republicans now in control of all
three branches of government (not that sep
aration of powers would ever stop the GOF),
such a stunt should instantly result in a decla
ration of the War Against the Gay Terror. The
"don't ask, don't tell" policy will be abol
ished, since queers everywhere are now
enemy combatants spying for the other side,
and soldiers will be carefully monitored for
limp wrists and pink clothing. San Francisco
will secede from the Union in protest and the
U.S. embassy in Australia will place pressure
on the Australian government to investigate
the Electric Six for their disturbing threats to
"put something in you at the gay bar."
Just when international tension is running
at fever pitch, the terrorists should move in
with their piece de resistance — kidnap J.K.
Rowling and hold her hostage. It's the per
fect climax for this unfortunate series of
events. The world has gradually nursed a
cancerous addiction to Harry Potter over
the last decade, and tension is running high
as the entire world awaits the seventh
chronicle with bated breath. When the ter
rorists release footage of Rowling gagged
and tied to a chair, surrounded by vaguely
Middle Eastern-looking men carrying large
firearms, blood will run in the streets as Pot
ter fans accidentally stab each other while
waving plastic wands in an attempt to curse
the terrorists to death. Meanwhile, soldiers
at the front, terrified that they'll die before
Ron gets a chance to pork Hermione, will
