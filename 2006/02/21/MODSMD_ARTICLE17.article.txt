Public service should continue even
after graduation
The first several paragraphs of last Thurs
day's editorial ("Keeping the dream alive
once the Bubble pops," Feb. 16) demonstrat
ed unwarranted pessimism. However, the ed
itorial ended on a note of optimism by rally
ing students to "(g]et involved in programs
that give life and realistic application to
[their] abstract ideals."
The editorial presumes that the only time
to embrace and act upon one's "cause" (im
plicitly, a cause related to ideals like social
justice, opposition to morally unjustified
wars, environmental degradation, and so
forth) is while one is safely within the "Stan
ford Bubble." The editorial presupposes that
young Stanford graduates will have to leave
behind such causes because of the time re
quired to make a living and get "established."
In the words of the editorial,"Eventually, you
will grow up and grow out of your idealism."
The perception of the editors seems to be
that idealism will need to be abandoned soon
after receipt of a Stanford diploma, lest the

values linked to that idealism interfere with
the work of life beyond Stanford.
My colleagues and I at the Haas Center
for Public Service hold a different view, one
based on our personal experiences and the
experiences of innumerable others who have
had satisfying and fulfilling careers based
around the pursuit of causes embraced dur
ing the years before graduation. We refer, of
course, to the countless number of alumni of
Stanford and other colleges and universities
who have spent all or part of their profession
al lives in public service, primarily with gov
ernments and nongovernmental organiza
tions in the United States and abroad. Op
portunities abound for engaging in fulfilling
work at all levels of government, and there
are uncountable numbers of community
service organizations at which Stanford grad
uates have played central roles. And as for
the enormous numbers of Stanford gradu
ates whose careers have been exclusively in
the private sector, a great many have pursued
their ideals by making a difference via volun
tary service in a variety of contexts, including
service on boards of nonprofits.

To help current Stanford students learn
more about these possibilities, we encourage
visits to the Haas Center, a part of Stanford
dedicated to helping students connect aca
demic study with community and public serv
ice to strengthen communities and develop
effective public leaders. By visiting the Cen
ter (or http://haas.stanford.edu/). students
can learn about a host of public service op
portunities organized around five topical
areas: service-learning courses; community
based research; community programs (in
cluding those involving tutoring and mentor
ing children and youth in nearby schools);
fellowships, which include grants to support
work at government agencies and nonprofits
during the summer and soon after gradua
tion); and leadership development. Current
ly, we are working with several interdiscipli
nary programs to explore ways of integrating
service-learning opportunities into gradua
tion requirements for majors.
Activities of the Haas Center are closely
aligned with Stanford's overall goals.
Indeed, the Center works to imple
ment a sentiment expressed by Jane
Lathrop Stanford in her November
1,1901 amendments to the universi
ty's founding grant:
"While the instruction offered
must be such as will qualify the stu
dents for personal success and direct
usefulness in life, they should under
stand that it is offered in the hope
and trust that they will become
thereby of greater service to the
public."

The myths surrounding
intelligent design
The Editorial Board rightly
called for an "Intelligent debate of
intelligent design" last week (Feb.
17). Framing the discussion as a face

off between reason and religion,
however, propagates a misguided
mythology that obscures, rather
than clarifies, the controversy.
First, criticizing neo-Darwinism
is not the same as promoting intelli
gent design. While microevolution
ary mechanisms, such as the cou
pling of random mutations and nat
ural selection, have clearly been
demonstrated, they fail to explain
macroevolutionary changes (e.g.,
morphological novelty). Neo-Dar
winists argue there is no difference
between the two kinds of evolution,
but that claim is vigorously contest
ed by many developmental biolo
gists and paleontologists.
Second, creationism is not the
same as intelligent design. Reasons
to Believe, a creationist group
which accepts that the earth is bil
lions of years old, dismisses intelli
gent design as "not science."The In
stitute for Creation Research,
which argues for a literal six-day in
terpretation of Genesis, similarly
criticizes intelligent design for not
being biblical.
Third, intelligent design theorists,
by and large,do not support the man
dating of intelligent design in public

schools. The real story out of Wiscon
sin is not the hypothetical "ban on
teaching intelligent design," but the
critical approach to science adopted
in 2004 by the town of Grantsburg
and to which this "ban" is a reaction.
Grantsburg's policy states: "Students
shall be able to explain the scientific
strengths and weaknesses of evolu
tionary theory. This policy does not
call for the teaching of Creationism
or Intelligent Design." Who could
argue with that?
Sadly, neo-Darwinists do argue
with that by stereotyping critics of
evolutionary theory as religious
zealots, by reducing the debate to
the simplistic but familiar terms of
science vs. faith, and by persecuting
researchers like the Smithsonian's
Rick Sternberg for keeping an open
mind. Pernicious caricatures
notwithstanding, the signatories to
the Scientific Dissent from Darwin
ism now stand at over 500 scientists,
including several who earned their
doctorates from Stanford. As sci
ence advances, why has this number
continued to grow?
