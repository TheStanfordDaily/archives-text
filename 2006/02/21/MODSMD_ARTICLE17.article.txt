Public service should continue even
after graduation
The first several paragraphs of last Thurs
day's editorial ("Keeping the dream alive
once the Bubble pops," Feb. 16) demonstrat
ed unwarranted pessimism. However, the ed
itorial ended on a note of optimism by rally
ing students to "(g]et involved in programs
that give life and realistic application to
[their] abstract ideals."
The editorial presumes that the only time
to embrace and act upon one's "cause" (im
plicitly, a cause related to ideals like social
justice, opposition to morally unjustified
wars, environmental degradation, and so
forth) is while one is safely within the "Stan
ford Bubble." The editorial presupposes that
young Stanford graduates will have to leave
behind such causes because of the time re
quired to make a living and get "established."
In the words of the editorial,"Eventually, you
will grow up and grow out of your idealism."
The perception of the editors seems to be
that idealism will need to be abandoned soon
after receipt of a Stanford diploma, lest the

values linked to that idealism interfere with
the work of life beyond Stanford.
My colleagues and I at the Haas Center
for Public Service hold a different view, one
based on our personal experiences and the
experiences of innumerable others who have
had satisfying and fulfilling careers based
around the pursuit of causes embraced dur
ing the years before graduation. We refer, of
course, to the countless number of alumni of
Stanford and other colleges and universities
who have spent all or part of their profession
al lives in public service, primarily with gov
ernments and nongovernmental organiza
tions in the United States and abroad. Op
portunities abound for engaging in fulfilling
work at all levels of government, and there
are uncountable numbers of community
service organizations at which Stanford grad
uates have played central roles. And as for
the enormous numbers of Stanford gradu
ates whose careers have been exclusively in
the private sector, a great many have pursued
their ideals by making a difference via volun
tary service in a variety of contexts, including
service on boards of nonprofits.

To help current Stanford students learn
more about these possibilities, we encourage
visits to the Haas Center, a part of Stanford
dedicated to helping students connect aca
demic study with community and public serv
ice to strengthen communities and develop
effective public leaders. By visiting the Cen
ter (or http://haas.stanford.edu/). students
can learn about a host of public service op
portunities organized around five topical
areas: service-learning courses; community
based research; community programs (in
cluding those involving tutoring and mentor
ing children and youth in nearby schools);
fellowships, which include grants to support
work at government agencies and nonprofits
during the summer and soon after gradua
tion); and leadership development. Current
ly, we are working with several interdiscipli
nary programs to explore ways of integrating
service-learning opportunities into gradua
tion requirements for majors.
Activities of the Haas Center are closely
