## A 						Cardinal sin in Torino 
### 
We've all made the same
mistake. Just 10 seconds
left in the fourth quarter.
Ten seconds left to proudly stare at
the lower right-hand corner of the
screen and read "Eagles 21, Patriots
15." Ten seconds to savor the fact
that you have the ball and that your
opponent has no prayer of winning
tonight's game of Madden. Ten sec
onds to run one final play, to avoid
taking a knee, to toss the Hail Mary,
just to stick it to your opponent.
And just 10 seconds to see Tedy
Bruschi pick off your toss and return
it for a game-winning touchdown.
Seconds separated you from vic
tory. But now, instead of 10 seconds
of glory you're left with 10 months
for your buddy to constantly remind
you of the night you threw away that
X-Box victory.
And last week, at the first
Olympic women's snowboard cross,
10 seconds separated America's
Lindsey Jacobellis from the gold
medal.
As the Visa commercial celebrity
approached one of the course's final
jumps, her closest competitor —
Switzerland's Tanja Frieden — was
nowhere in sight. It appeared only a
catastrophe would keep the 20-year
old from making history.
But as Jacobellis' board slid over
that second-to-last jump, emotion
overcame her. Suddenly, it wasn't
about her country, it was about Jaco
bellis. She decided to go for a back
side method grab — a trick involv
ing a 60-degree twist — in front of
the grandstands, conveniently
enough.
And what did Jacobellis have to
show for her showboating? A mis
calculated landing, a fall on her
backside and a front-row view of
Frieden whizzing by to claim the
gold.
Immediately after the finish, Ja
cobellis claimed the jump was stan
dard and that she was merely trying
to ensure a stable landing — which
explains why she did the trick in
front of crowd-packed stands, and
why she would look to land a trick
she rarely attempted.
That kicked off the debate as to
whether or not Jacobellis should
have attempted the trick, and as to
whether or not she was hotdogging
in the first place. To me, it was an
easy decision. I've never seen snow
boarding, a Winter Olympic sport, or
even actual snow in my life, but even
I could tell from a mile away that Ja
cobellis was guilty of sports' most
commonly committed sin — count
ing your chickens before they hatch.
A similar mistake could have cost
the Broncos their divisional playoff
victory over New England a few
weeks ago when Champ Bailey
slowed near the end zone, allowing
Pats' tight end Ben Watson to clock
the Denver cornerback at one-yard
line and come dangerously close to
forcing a game-altering safety.
For weeks heading into the 2006
Rose Bowl, ESPN ran a nightly spe
cial hypothetically pitting this year's
Southern California squad against
some of history's greatest college
teams. Each night, analysts would
proclaim the Trojans' majesty, ignor
ing the fact that the team was still
one win away from the national
championship.
And sure enough, Texas made
the "Worldwide Leader" eat its
words. Even I paid the price for my
overconfidence, as is clearly demon
strated by the giant Texas banner
now hanging in my room, compli
ments of an ill-fated bet that contin
ues to ravage my soul.
And no one should know about
this athletic sin better than Cardinal
fans, who witnessed our beloved
band pull a Jacobellis of their own in
1982.
With her antics this past week
end, Jacobellis cemented her legend
in sports lore. In a world filled with
athletes who spend more time
choreographing their celebration
dances than talking with their team
mates, it's hard to imagine modern
players putting their teams —or
their nation — over themselves and
their egos.
But for the sake of the Olympics,
the grandest stage of all, it sure

A Dose of "Truf"
would be nice to see an American
athlete living up to the Games' orig
inal intentions of competing for
sport and country.
Yet we can still thank Jacobellis
for one thing: she gave us something
to actually care about in Torino.
