# Card take two of three from Texas
## Pitching dominates in two rain-delayed games 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
In Saturday's series opener between
Stanford and No. 7 Texas, it was the Long
horns' pitching that dominated — sopho
more Adrian Alaniz and freshman Joey Pa
rigi stepped up to limit the Cardinal to two
runs on just four hits as Texas won 4-2. A
day later, the Stanford trio of senior Matt
Manship, sophomore Nolan Gallagher and
freshman Jeremy Bleich returned the favor
by silencing the Texas bats in a 5-1 Cardinal
victory.
Fittingly, Monday's series finale at
Sunken Diamond was also decided by a
noteworthy pitching performance. But this
time, it was a pitching performance of an
entirely different quality.
The Longhorns pitching staff fell apart
in the bottom of third. Three Texas pitchers
who appeared in the inning combined to
surrender nine runs while walking five and
allowing three hits.
After walking Stanford centerfielder
Jim Rapoport with the bases loaded.Texas
hurler Kenn Kasparek finally found the
plate.

But when he did, senior shortstop Chris
Minaker was ready. With one quick, crush
ing blow, Minaker launched a bases-loaded
moonshot over the left field wall, pulling
the Cardinal ahead by an 11-4 margin. The
Longhorns (5-6) fought back to within four
runs of a tie, but Stanford junior Blake
Holler and freshman Sean Ratliff slammed
the door on the Texas comeback as the Car
dinal (6-3) took the game, and the series,
with the 13-9 victory.
While Minaker was the offensive hero
yesterday — going 4-5 with a double, a
grand slam, and five RBls — sophomore
rightfielder Michael Taylor provided the
pop at the plate for the Cardinal on Sunday.
Taylor pushed Stanford to an early three
run lead with a base-clearing double to the
right field gap in the third inning. Two in
nings later, he drove in his fourth run of the
day on a sacrifice fly.
The pitching of Manship, Gallagher and
Bleich was just as key in the victory. Man
ship worked into the fifth inning while al
lowing the Longhorns' lone run of the af
ternoon. Gallagher and Bleich wrapped
the contest up by holding the Texas lineup
hitless.
"We hit the ball better today and got
some good pitching," said coach Mark Mar-

Junior leftfielder Ryan Seawell was held hitless by Texas pitching this weekend. Stanford's hurlers were
up to par with the defending champs, however, and kept the Longhorns at bay on Sunday.
quess, contrasting Sunday's perform
ance with the team's discouraging of
fensive performance in the series
opener.
From the very beginning, the rub
ber game of the series seemed des
tined to be a high-scoring affair.
Texas first baseman Kyle Russell put
the Longhorns on the board first
with a two-run triple in the first in
ning, but Minaker and Taylor both
notched RBI hits in the bottom half
of the inning. Texas reclaimed the
lead with two more runs in the third,
but their lead would be short-lived.
Taylor and freshman first base
man Jason Castro started a one-out
rally with back-to-back singles. After
a wild pitch, Texas starter Kyle Mc-
Culloch hit catcher John Hester with
a pitch to load the bases. At that
point, Longhorns manager Augie
Garrido made a call to the bullpen,
bringing in freshman lefthander Kyle
Walker.
The move didn't pay off, as Walk
er walked all four batters he faced,
putting the Cardinal on top 6-4. Kas
parek came on in relief and walked
Rapoport, setting the stage for Mi
naker's blast.
"Coach gave me the green light,"
Minaker said. "[Kasparek] threw a
fastball right where I was looking,
but the key there was to try not to do
too much."
Regardless of Minaker's intent,
his swing sent the pitch rocketing
well into the trees behind the left
field wall. The Cardinal picked up
two more runs before the end of the
game, one off a Rapoport solo home
run and the other on a sacrifice fly
from senior Chris Lewis.
Holler went 4.2 innings before
yielding to Ratliff in the eighth with
runners on second and third. Ratliff
allowed just one run before retiring
the side, and fanned four of the 10
batters he faced in his two innings of
work. Marquess spoke highly of the
efforts put forth by both pitchers in
yesterday's contest.
"For Blake, it was the first time
he's been out in awhile," he said."lt's
the longest he's worked this season,
and it was something he needed. And
Sean did a pretty good job. coming in
and throwing strikes in a tough situ
ation there in the eighth."
By taking two of three from the
Longhorns. the Cardinal improved

their record to 6-3. Perhaps of greater
significance, though, was the momen
tum boost gained from knocking off
the defending national champions.
"You definitely do think about
it," said Minaker when asked

whether Texas' title was of any signif
icance to the Cardinal. "This series
has huge ramifications for NCAA
seetlings. And as much as you may
say that you look at it like any other
series, there's always a little some-

thing extra in the air against a big
team like Texas."
Because of the weekend's rain
delay, the Cardinal take on Nevada
this afternoon at 2 p.m. before head
ing to Fresno State this weekend.
In Saturday's series opener between
Stanford and No. 7 Texas, it was the Long
horns' pitching that dominated — sopho
more Adrian Alaniz and freshman Joey Pa
rigi stepped up to limit the Cardinal to two
runs on just four hits as Texas won 4-2. A
day later, the Stanford trio of senior Matt
Manship, sophomore Nolan Gallagher and
freshman Jeremy Bleich returned the favor
by silencing the Texas bats in a 5-1 Cardinal
victory.
Fittingly, Monday's series finale at
Sunken Diamond was also decided by a
noteworthy pitching performance. But this
time, it was a pitching performance of an
entirely different quality.
The Longhorns pitching staff fell apart
in the bottom of third. Three Texas pitchers
who appeared in the inning combined to
surrender nine runs while walking five and
allowing three hits.
After walking Stanford centerfielder
Jim Rapoport with the bases loaded.Texas
hurler Kenn Kasparek finally found the
plate.

But when he did, senior shortstop Chris
Minaker was ready. With one quick, crush
ing blow, Minaker launched a bases-loaded
moonshot over the left field wall, pulling
the Cardinal ahead by an 11-4 margin. The
Longhorns (5-6) fought back to within four
runs of a tie, but Stanford junior Blake
Holler and freshman Sean Ratliff slammed
the door on the Texas comeback as the Car
dinal (6-3) took the game, and the series,
with the 13-9 victory.
While Minaker was the offensive hero
yesterday — going 4-5 with a double, a
grand slam, and five RBls — sophomore
rightfielder Michael Taylor provided the
pop at the plate for the Cardinal on Sunday.
Taylor pushed Stanford to an early three
run lead with a base-clearing double to the
right field gap in the third inning. Two in
nings later, he drove in his fourth run of the
day on a sacrifice fly.
The pitching of Manship, Gallagher and
Bleich was just as key in the victory. Man
ship worked into the fifth inning while al
lowing the Longhorns' lone run of the af
ternoon. Gallagher and Bleich wrapped
the contest up by holding the Texas lineup
hitless.
"We hit the ball better today and got
some good pitching," said coach Mark Mar-


ADRIAN GAITAN/The Stanford Daily
Junior leftfielder Ryan Seawell was held hitless by Texas pitching this weekend. Stanford's hurlers were
up to par with the defending champs, however, and kept the Longhorns at bay on Sunday.
quess, contrasting Sunday's perform
ance with the team's discouraging of
fensive performance in the series
opener.
From the very beginning, the rub
ber game of the series seemed des
tined to be a high-scoring affair.
Texas first baseman Kyle Russell put
the Longhorns on the board first
with a two-run triple in the first in
ning, but Minaker and Taylor both
notched RBI hits in the bottom half
of the inning. Texas reclaimed the
lead with two more runs in the third,
but their lead would be short-lived.
Taylor and freshman first base
man Jason Castro started a one-out
rally with back-to-back singles. After
a wild pitch, Texas starter Kyle Mc-
Culloch hit catcher John Hester with
a pitch to load the bases. At that
point, Longhorns manager Augie
Garrido made a call to the bullpen,
bringing in freshman lefthander Kyle
Walker.
The move didn't pay off, as Walk
er walked all four batters he faced,
putting the Cardinal on top 6-4. Kas
parek came on in relief and walked
Rapoport, setting the stage for Mi
naker's blast.
"Coach gave me the green light,"
Minaker said. "[Kasparek] threw a
fastball right where I was looking,
but the key there was to try not to do
too much."
Regardless of Minaker's intent,
his swing sent the pitch rocketing
well into the trees behind the left
field wall. The Cardinal picked up
two more runs before the end of the
game, one off a Rapoport solo home
run and the other on a sacrifice fly
from senior Chris Lewis.
Holler went 4.2 innings before
yielding to Ratliff in the eighth with
runners on second and third. Ratliff
allowed just one run before retiring
the side, and fanned four of the 10
batters he faced in his two innings of
work. Marquess spoke highly of the
efforts put forth by both pitchers in
yesterday's contest.
"For Blake, it was the first time
he's been out in awhile," he said."lt's
the longest he's worked this season,
and it was something he needed. And
Sean did a pretty good job. coming in
and throwing strikes in a tough situ
ation there in the eighth."
By taking two of three from the
Longhorns. the Cardinal improved

their record to 6-3. Perhaps of greater
significance, though, was the momen
tum boost gained from knocking off
the defending national champions.
"You definitely do think about
it," said Minaker when asked

whether Texas' title was of any signif
icance to the Cardinal. "This series
has huge ramifications for NCAA
seetlings. And as much as you may
say that you look at it like any other
series, there's always a little some-

thing extra in the air against a big
team like Texas."
Because of the weekend's rain
delay, the Cardinal take on Nevada
this afternoon at 2 p.m. before head
ing to Fresno State this weekend.
In Saturday's series opener between
Stanford and No. 7 Texas, it was the Long
horns' pitching that dominated — sopho
more Adrian Alaniz and freshman Joey Pa
rigi stepped up to limit the Cardinal to two
runs on just four hits as Texas won 4-2. A
day later, the Stanford trio of senior Matt
Manship, sophomore Nolan Gallagher and
freshman Jeremy Bleich returned the favor
by silencing the Texas bats in a 5-1 Cardinal
victory.
Fittingly, Monday's series finale at
Sunken Diamond was also decided by a
noteworthy pitching performance. But this
time, it was a pitching performance of an
entirely different quality.
The Longhorns pitching staff fell apart
in the bottom of third. Three Texas pitchers
who appeared in the inning combined to
surrender nine runs while walking five and
allowing three hits.
After walking Stanford centerfielder
Jim Rapoport with the bases loaded.Texas
hurler Kenn Kasparek finally found the
plate.

But when he did, senior shortstop Chris
Minaker was ready. With one quick, crush
ing blow, Minaker launched a bases-loaded
moonshot over the left field wall, pulling
the Cardinal ahead by an 11-4 margin. The
Longhorns (5-6) fought back to within four
runs of a tie, but Stanford junior Blake
Holler and freshman Sean Ratliff slammed
the door on the Texas comeback as the Car
dinal (6-3) took the game, and the series,
with the 13-9 victory.
While Minaker was the offensive hero
yesterday — going 4-5 with a double, a
grand slam, and five RBls — sophomore
rightfielder Michael Taylor provided the
pop at the plate for the Cardinal on Sunday.
Taylor pushed Stanford to an early three
run lead with a base-clearing double to the
right field gap in the third inning. Two in
nings later, he drove in his fourth run of the
day on a sacrifice fly.
The pitching of Manship, Gallagher and
Bleich was just as key in the victory. Man
ship worked into the fifth inning while al
lowing the Longhorns' lone run of the af
ternoon. Gallagher and Bleich wrapped
the contest up by holding the Texas lineup
hitless.
"We hit the ball better today and got
some good pitching," said coach Mark Mar-


ADRIAN GAITAN/The Stanford Daily
Junior leftfielder Ryan Seawell was held hitless by Texas pitching this weekend. Stanford's hurlers were
up to par with the defending champs, however, and kept the Longhorns at bay on Sunday.
quess, contrasting Sunday's perform
ance with the team's discouraging of
fensive performance in the series
opener.
From the very beginning, the rub
ber game of the series seemed des
tined to be a high-scoring affair.
Texas first baseman Kyle Russell put
the Longhorns on the board first
with a two-run triple in the first in
ning, but Minaker and Taylor both
notched RBI hits in the bottom half
of the inning. Texas reclaimed the
lead with two more runs in the third,
but their lead would be short-lived.
Taylor and freshman first base
man Jason Castro started a one-out
rally with back-to-back singles. After
a wild pitch, Texas starter Kyle Mc-
Culloch hit catcher John Hester with
a pitch to load the bases. At that
point, Longhorns manager Augie
Garrido made a call to the bullpen,
bringing in freshman lefthander Kyle
Walker.
The move didn't pay off, as Walk
er walked all four batters he faced,
putting the Cardinal on top 6-4. Kas
parek came on in relief and walked
Rapoport, setting the stage for Mi
naker's blast.
"Coach gave me the green light,"
Minaker said. "[Kasparek] threw a
fastball right where I was looking,
but the key there was to try not to do
too much."
Regardless of Minaker's intent,
his swing sent the pitch rocketing
well into the trees behind the left
field wall. The Cardinal picked up
two more runs before the end of the
game, one off a Rapoport solo home
run and the other on a sacrifice fly
from senior Chris Lewis.
Holler went 4.2 innings before
yielding to Ratliff in the eighth with
runners on second and third. Ratliff
allowed just one run before retiring
the side, and fanned four of the 10
batters he faced in his two innings of
work. Marquess spoke highly of the
efforts put forth by both pitchers in
yesterday's contest.
"For Blake, it was the first time
he's been out in awhile," he said."lt's
the longest he's worked this season,
and it was something he needed. And
Sean did a pretty good job. coming in
and throwing strikes in a tough situ
ation there in the eighth."
By taking two of three from the
Longhorns. the Cardinal improved

their record to 6-3. Perhaps of greater
significance, though, was the momen
tum boost gained from knocking off
the defending national champions.
"You definitely do think about
it," said Minaker when asked

whether Texas' title was of any signif
icance to the Cardinal. "This series
has huge ramifications for NCAA
seetlings. And as much as you may
say that you look at it like any other
series, there's always a little some-
