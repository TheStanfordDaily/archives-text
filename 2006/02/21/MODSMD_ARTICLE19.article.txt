# Card take two of three from Texas
## Pitching dominates in two rain-delayed games 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
In Saturday's series opener between
Stanford and No. 7 Texas, it was the Long
horns' pitching that dominated — sopho
more Adrian Alaniz and freshman Joey Pa
rigi stepped up to limit the Cardinal to two
runs on just four hits as Texas won 4-2. A
day later, the Stanford trio of senior Matt
Manship, sophomore Nolan Gallagher and
freshman Jeremy Bleich returned the favor
by silencing the Texas bats in a 5-1 Cardinal
victory.
Fittingly, Monday's series finale at
Sunken Diamond was also decided by a
noteworthy pitching performance. But this
time, it was a pitching performance of an
entirely different quality.
The Longhorns pitching staff fell apart
in the bottom of third. Three Texas pitchers
who appeared in the inning combined to
surrender nine runs while walking five and
allowing three hits.
After walking Stanford centerfielder
Jim Rapoport with the bases loaded.Texas
hurler Kenn Kasparek finally found the
plate.

But when he did, senior shortstop Chris
Minaker was ready. With one quick, crush
ing blow, Minaker launched a bases-loaded
moonshot over the left field wall, pulling
the Cardinal ahead by an 11-4 margin. The
Longhorns (5-6) fought back to within four
runs of a tie, but Stanford junior Blake
Holler and freshman Sean Ratliff slammed
the door on the Texas comeback as the Car
dinal (6-3) took the game, and the series,
with the 13-9 victory.
While Minaker was the offensive hero
yesterday — going 4-5 with a double, a
grand slam, and five RBls — sophomore
rightfielder Michael Taylor provided the
pop at the plate for the Cardinal on Sunday.
Taylor pushed Stanford to an early three
run lead with a base-clearing double to the
right field gap in the third inning. Two in
nings later, he drove in his fourth run of the
day on a sacrifice fly.
The pitching of Manship, Gallagher and
Bleich was just as key in the victory. Man
ship worked into the fifth inning while al
lowing the Longhorns' lone run of the af
ternoon. Gallagher and Bleich wrapped
the contest up by holding the Texas lineup
hitless.
"We hit the ball better today and got
some good pitching," said coach Mark Mar-

Junior leftfielder Ryan Seawell was held hitless by Texas pitching this weekend. Stanford's hurlers were
up to par with the defending champs, however, and kept the Longhorns at bay on Sunday.
