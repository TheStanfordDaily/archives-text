# ARIZONA 76, STANFORD 72
## OVERPOWERED Men fall to Wildcats on Sunday as window for postseason narrows 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
Senior guard Chris Hernandez hit
three consecutive three-pointers to
open the men's basketball game versus
Arizona on Sunday afternoon. But for
Stanford, it was all downhill from there.
Al5-3 Wildcat run to start the second
half, poor defense and a paucity of scor
ing threats did the Cardinal in, 76-72.
Arizona guard Hassan Adams (10-
of-21 shooting) and forward Ivan
Radenovic (8-of-10, eight rebounds)
led the Wildcats with 23 apiece. While
Hernandez led all scorers with 28, sen
ior center Matt Haryasz could muster
only 15 — four shy of his season aver
age. The only other Card (13-10, 9-5
Pac-10) to crack double figures was
sophomore forward Taj Finger with 11.
"I think we might have gotten a bit
too unselfish and started passing too
much to start the second half," Haryasz
said. "They went on their run and the
wheels started falling off."
Arizona's run — and Stanford's col
lapse— came at the most inopportune
of times. Stanford had clawed to a narrow
38-36 halftime lead but emerged from
the locker room to watch the contest turn
into a near-rout in mere minutes.
In the first 6:34 of the second half,
Stanford committed five turnovers, hit
none of its first six*field goal attempts
and missed two free throws, including a
Hernandez misfire that snapped his
streak of 34 straight.
"They did a good job of being ag
gressive, making us pick our dribble up
and making us make turnovers," Her
nandez said.
All told, Stanford scored just three
points during that meltdown — a pace
that would have produced just nine sec
ond-half points — while the Wildcats
(16-10,9-6) scored 16 to pull ahead 52-41.

Senior forward Matt Haryasz, an Arizona native, didn't play up to his standards against
the Wildcats. Haryasz scored 15 points, four below his season average.
