# ARIZONA 76, STANFORD 72
## OVERPOWERED Men fall to Wildcats on Sunday as window for postseason narrows 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
Senior guard Chris Hernandez hit
three consecutive three-pointers to
open the men's basketball game versus
Arizona on Sunday afternoon. But for
Stanford, it was all downhill from there.
Al5-3 Wildcat run to start the second
half, poor defense and a paucity of scor
ing threats did the Cardinal in, 76-72.
Arizona guard Hassan Adams (10-
of-21 shooting) and forward Ivan
Radenovic (8-of-10, eight rebounds)
led the Wildcats with 23 apiece. While
Hernandez led all scorers with 28, sen
ior center Matt Haryasz could muster
only 15 — four shy of his season aver
age. The only other Card (13-10, 9-5
Pac-10) to crack double figures was
sophomore forward Taj Finger with 11.
"I think we might have gotten a bit
too unselfish and started passing too
much to start the second half," Haryasz
said. "They went on their run and the
wheels started falling off."
Arizona's run — and Stanford's col
lapse— came at the most inopportune
of times. Stanford had clawed to a narrow
38-36 halftime lead but emerged from
the locker room to watch the contest turn
into a near-rout in mere minutes.
In the first 6:34 of the second half,
Stanford committed five turnovers, hit
none of its first six*field goal attempts
and missed two free throws, including a
Hernandez misfire that snapped his
streak of 34 straight.
"They did a good job of being ag
gressive, making us pick our dribble up
and making us make turnovers," Her
nandez said.
All told, Stanford scored just three
points during that meltdown — a pace
that would have produced just nine sec
ond-half points — while the Wildcats
(16-10,9-6) scored 16 to pull ahead 52-41.

Senior forward Matt Haryasz, an Arizona native, didn't play up to his standards against
the Wildcats. Haryasz scored 15 points, four below his season average.
"I thought that at the start of the second half we lost our
poise," head coach Tent Johnson said. "We kind of got into a
hurry and we panicked. I thought the defensive pressure re
ally got us off-rhythm offensively, and that was the game
there."
Two Hernandez threes did key a 16-5 Card run which cut
the lead to 71-68 with 49 seconds to play. But the officials
then whistled Finger for hacking Radenovic 30 feet from the
hoop, and Stanford never closed to within one possession
again.
Wildcat coach Lute Olson called the win "one of [Ari
zona's] best games of the season." His team finished the
game with 52.6 percent overall shooting, and the Wildcats
made more than they missed in each half.
"They just hit shots when we had good defense — con
testing a shot, making a guy not shoot his favorite shot."
Haryasz said. "But our transition defense was horrible
tonight. Horrible. That cost us a lot of buckets."
Johnson saw fewer positives in his squad's defensive per
formance.
"Every time we made a run or a semi-run, they managed
to come down, get a good look or get to the free-throw line."
he said. "Anytime you're at home and the opposing team
shoots 21 free throws, that says something about your de
fense or lack thereof."
While Stanford's last three losses have been hard-fought
(losing to probable NCAA Tournament teams by a total of
just 11 points) the Card's NCAA chances are nonetheless in
need of resuscitation. To qualify. Hernandez said the team
will likely need to sweep its remaining regular-season con
tests or claim the Pac-10's automatic berth by winning the
conference tournament in Los Angeles.

Senior guard Chris Hernandez hit
three consecutive three-pointers to
open the men's basketball game versus
Arizona on Sunday afternoon. But for
Stanford, it was all downhill from there.
Al5-3 Wildcat run to start the second
half, poor defense and a paucity of scor
ing threats did the Cardinal in, 76-72.
Arizona guard Hassan Adams (10-
of-21 shooting) and forward Ivan
Radenovic (8-of-10, eight rebounds)
led the Wildcats with 23 apiece. While
Hernandez led all scorers with 28, sen
ior center Matt Haryasz could muster
only 15 — four shy of his season aver
age. The only other Card (13-10, 9-5
Pac-10) to crack double figures was
sophomore forward Taj Finger with 11.
"I think we might have gotten a bit
too unselfish and started passing too
much to start the second half," Haryasz
said. "They went on their run and the
wheels started falling off."
Arizona's run — and Stanford's col
lapse— came at the most inopportune
of times. Stanford had clawed to a narrow
38-36 halftime lead but emerged from
the locker room to watch the contest turn
into a near-rout in mere minutes.
In the first 6:34 of the second half,
Stanford committed five turnovers, hit
none of its first six*field goal attempts
and missed two free throws, including a
Hernandez misfire that snapped his
streak of 34 straight.
"They did a good job of being ag
gressive, making us pick our dribble up
and making us make turnovers," Her
nandez said.
All told, Stanford scored just three
points during that meltdown — a pace
that would have produced just nine sec
ond-half points — while the Wildcats
(16-10,9-6) scored 16 to pull ahead 52-41.

Senior forward Matt Haryasz, an Arizona native, didn't play up to his standards against
the Wildcats. Haryasz scored 15 points, four below his season average.
"I thought that at the start of the second half we lost our
poise," head coach Tent Johnson said. "We kind of got into a
hurry and we panicked. I thought the defensive pressure re
ally got us off-rhythm offensively, and that was the game
there."
Two Hernandez threes did key a 16-5 Card run which cut
the lead to 71-68 with 49 seconds to play. But the officials
then whistled Finger for hacking Radenovic 30 feet from the
hoop, and Stanford never closed to within one possession
again.
Wildcat coach Lute Olson called the win "one of [Ari
zona's] best games of the season." His team finished the
game with 52.6 percent overall shooting, and the Wildcats
made more than they missed in each half.
"They just hit shots when we had good defense — con
testing a shot, making a guy not shoot his favorite shot."
Haryasz said. "But our transition defense was horrible
tonight. Horrible. That cost us a lot of buckets."
Johnson saw fewer positives in his squad's defensive per
formance.
"Every time we made a run or a semi-run, they managed
to come down, get a good look or get to the free-throw line."
he said. "Anytime you're at home and the opposing team
shoots 21 free throws, that says something about your de
fense or lack thereof."
While Stanford's last three losses have been hard-fought
(losing to probable NCAA Tournament teams by a total of
just 11 points) the Card's NCAA chances are nonetheless in
need of resuscitation. To qualify. Hernandez said the team
will likely need to sweep its remaining regular-season con
tests or claim the Pac-10's automatic berth by winning the
conference tournament in Los Angeles.
