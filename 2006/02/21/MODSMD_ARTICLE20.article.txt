# SIZE MATTERS
## WOMEN USE ADVANTAGE IN 87-76 VICTORY 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
TUCSON, Ariz. — On the day Arizona re
tired the jersey of deceased star center
Shawntinice Polk, the Wildcats were re
minded just how important she was to the
team, both on and off the court. The Cardi
nal were thus able to expose the Wildcats'
size down low, outscoring Arizona in the
paint 34-14 en route to an 87-76 victory.
"We knew we had a size advantage com
ing in," freshman guard/forward Jillian Har
mon said. "We wanted to give the ball to
Brooke [Smith] and Kristin Newlin, and
once we did. we started to build a lead."
With four starting guards, the Wildcats
relied almost entirely on the outside shot.
Arizona (7-20, 3-14 Pac-10) shot 57.1 per
cent (8-14) from behind the arc in the first
17 minutes and was able to keep pace with
Stanford (19-6, 13-3), trailing only 43-40 at
the half.
"I think you have to assume that they're
going to cool off eventually," Smith, a junior
center, said. "You can't get too worried
about it. You have to weather the storm and
tighten up your defense outside."
But once the three-pointers stopped
falling — the Wildcats shot 23.1 percent in
the second half — the Cardinal went to
work in the low post. Stanford would open
up a 10-point lead with 10:46 to go thanks to
Smith, who scored 15 of her 22 in the second
half.
Sharing the scoring load for the Cardinal
were sophomore guard Candice Wiggins,
who scored a team-high 24, and Harmon,
who added 15 points of her own.
"It was a tournament-type atmosphere,"
Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"This helped our team a lot more [then the
31-point win over Arizona at Maples]."
Arizona's senior forward Natalie Jones
saved one of her best games for last, with a
game-high 27 points. 14 rebounds and four
assists. The Anchorage, Alaska native
walked off Lute and Bobbi Olson court for
the last time to a standing ovation.
But the biggest cheer of the night was re
served for Polk, known as "Polkey" to the
Arizona fans. In her honor, the Arizona
team ran onto the court wearing t-shirts
with Polk's picture on the front and a slogan
on the back that read,"lt's not what you did

squad. Harmon knew Stanford had a sizeable advantage over the Wildcats this past weekend.
