## Host takes Invite with six wins 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
Despite rain delays and near-freez
ing temperatures, the Cardinal softhall
squad swept through the Stanford Invi
tational this weekend, outscoring their
opponents a combined 44-5.
Stanford (10-1) benefited from big
hitting — four homers and seven triples
— from the entire lineup. Nine Stanford
batters tallied at least two RBI in the
six-game tournament. Sophomore Erin
Howe led the way with eight, including
a three-RBI homer, her first of the sea
son.
"We have some great hitters, really
big hitters," sophomore Anna Beard
man said. "Every one of us knows what
we have to do to get it done. If we don't
have the big hits, we're going to find
other ways, either with the short game
or line drives through. We find a way."
While the Cardinal offense steam
rolled its opponents, the pitchers held
up their end with six over-powering per
formances in the circle. Freshman Missy
Penna (5-1) pitched 19 innings, includ
ing two complete game shutouts, and
gave up only four hits while striking out
21 on the weekend. Sophomore Becky
McCullough (3-0) allowed six hits and
two runs in 12 innings of work.
"Our pitchers are getting in rhythm
and getting more comfortable in game
situations," Rittman said. "On offense,
we're putting together hits and giving
ourselves lots of opportunities. We elim
inated pretty much all of our base-run
ning mistakes from week one to week
two."
The only blight on the stat sheet for
the Cardinal were the four fielding er
rors committed against Drake.
"The biggest thing that we need to
work on right now is our defense."
Rittman said. "We can't afford to give
away outs against good teams."
In Stanford's tournament opener,
the Cardinal waited nearly two hours
for the heavy rain to let up. When they
finally took the field, the Card
scored an easy 13-1 victory over
Santa Clara. Die game was called
after five innings by the mercy rule.
The Cardinal scored two in the
top of the first to go up for good. The
Broncos scored on a wild pitch in the
bottom of the first but would not
cross the plate again.
Stanford scored one in the second
and four in the third inning, includ
ing a two-RBI triple by senior cen
terfielder Catalina Morris.
Becky McCullough got her first
win of the weekend, scattering two
hits in four innings of work. Closer
Laura Severson, a senior, pitched
one inning and struck out two in the
fifth.
In Friday's second game, the Car
dinal offense took some time to get
going, but a four-run third inning
helped Stanford to a 5-0 win over
Drake. After two scoreless innings,
Morris sent a two-run blast over the
centerfield wall. Three RBI singles
sealed the deal for the Cardinal.
Penna pitched a complete game two
hitter and struck out 11, reaching
double-digits for the second time
this season.
Stanford again topped Drake on
Saturday, 7-4. Beardman hit a two-
RBI triple to start the Cardinal scor
ing in the second inning. The Bull
dogs scored one each in the second
and third innings to tie the game, but
Stanford regained the lead with an
other Beardman triple in the fourth.
Severson got the win in the circle for
Stanford, allowing five hits in five in
nings.
In Saturday's second game, Stan
ford rolled to an 8-0 victory over
Birmingham Southern. The game
was called with one out and runners
on first and second in the sixth inning
when the Cardinal's eight-run lead
invoked the mercy rule.
Stanford scored one run in the
first inning and added three more in
the third. After going up 5-0 in the
fifth.the Cardinal scored three in the
sixth to end the game. Penna one-hit
the Panthers with five strikeouts in

six innings.
Against Sacramento State on
Sunday, Stanford scored seven runs
in the first two innings, going
through its entire batting lineup in
each inning. Though Stanford would
not score after that, the squad won 7-
0 in a full seven innings. Hornets'
starting pitcher Cassie Cervantes
opened the game with a strikeout
but walked five of the next six bat
ters she faced. Penna pitched anoth
er one-hitter, striking out five in six
innings.
The Cardinal closed the tourna
ment Sunday afternoon with a re
match against the Broncos. After
three scoreless innings, freshman
second baseman Maddy Coon hit a
two-run blast to left field which sent
the ball sailing over the building be
hind the scoreboard. Morris also tal
lied a two-run homer, sending it just
over the centerfield wall in the fifth
inning. McCullough got the win over
the Broncos with six strikeouts and
only two hits in six innings.
"We have a lot of offensive
weapons," Rittman said. "Even a
game like that, where Santa Clara's
pitcher was keeping us a little off
balance, you have to be careful with
all the hitters in our lineup and even
the kids coming off the bench. We
are a very good offensive team and if
we take a good approach at the plate,
we're going to be tough to beat."
