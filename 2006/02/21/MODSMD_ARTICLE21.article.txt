### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
Despite rain delays and near-freez
ing temperatures, the Cardinal softhall
squad swept through the Stanford Invi
tational this weekend, outscoring their
opponents a combined 44-5.
Stanford (10-1) benefited from big
hitting — four homers and seven triples
— from the entire lineup. Nine Stanford
batters tallied at least two RBI in the
six-game tournament. Sophomore Erin
Howe led the way with eight, including
a three-RBI homer, her first of the sea
son.
"We have some great hitters, really

man said. "Every one of us knows what
we have to do to get it done. If we don't
have the big hits, we're going to find
other ways, either with the short game
or line drives through. We find a way."
While the Cardinal offense steam
rolled its opponents, the pitchers held
up their end with six over-powering per
formances in the circle. Freshman Missy
Penna (5-1) pitched 19 innings, includ
ing two complete game shutouts, and
gave up only four hits while striking out
21 on the weekend. Sophomore Becky
McCullough (3-0) allowed six hits and
two runs in 12 innings of work.
"Our pitchers are getting in rhythm
and getting more comfortable in game
situations," Rittman said. "On offense,
we're putting together hits and giving
ourselves lots of opportunities. We elim
inated pretty much all of our base-run
ning mistakes from week one to week
two."
The only blight on the stat sheet for
the Cardinal were the four fielding er
rors committed against Drake.
"The biggest thing that we need to
work on right now is our defense."
Rittman said. "We can't afford to give
away outs against good teams."
In Stanford's tournament opener,
the Cardinal waited nearly two hours
for the heavy rain to let up. When they
