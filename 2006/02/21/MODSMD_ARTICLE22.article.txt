# Tumultuous weekend ends in satisfactory results for women
## Wins over UCLA, USC are two of season's "most important" 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
LOS ANGELES. Calif. — It was an epic
weekend for the top-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team, as it defeated No. 17
UCLA,6-0, and the No. 4 Southern California.
5-2. The matches were marked by bad weath
er, penalties for unsportsmanlike conduct and
fiercely-fought singles matches with thrilling
comebacks.
Stanford (9-0) got off to a rocky start Fri
day against USC (5-1), losing the doubles
point for the first time this season.
Senior Amber Liu and sophomore Celia
Durkin lost, 8-6. at the No. 2 doubles spot and
junior Theresa Logar and sophomore Whit
ney Deason lost, 8-3, at the No. 3 doubles spot.
Stanford's No. 2-ranked duo of senior Alice

Barnes and junior Anne Yelsey beat USC's
Luana Magnani and Lindsey Nelson at the
No. 1 doubles' spot, 8-6, but it wasn't enough
for the Card.
And the Cardinal's predicament only grew
worse in singles. An ailing Barnes withdrew
from the match following doubles, so every
one but Liu (at the No. 1 position) had to play
one spot higher than they had anticipated.
Stanford players lost the first sets in four of
the six matches. The winners were Durkin at
the No. 5 spot and freshman Jessica Nguyen,
who stepped in at the last minute to win at the
No. 6 spot.
It began to drizzle while four of the courts
began their second sets, and soon the match
was postponed until Sunday due to the wet
ness of the courts.
All in all, Stanford's chances for victory
looked slim, as coach Lele Forood acknowl
edged.
"We haven't had to do something like this
for a long time," said Forood. "There's not

much wiggle room. We will have to be gutsy
right from the first ball."
On Sunday — with a lot of determination
and a match won by default — the Cardinal
did not disappoint Forood.
On the second court, ITA-ranked No. 3
Amanda Fink of USC led Logar 5-3 in the sec
ond set when Fink forfeited a game for com
mitting her fourth line call violation of the day.
In the next game, the umpire judged that Fink
again finked — incorrectly calling Logar's
ball out — and handed the match to Logar on
grounds of unsportsmanlike conduct.
"That was lucky," Deason said. "Not in
terms of whether or not it was deserved — it
was — but because we got a point up on the
scoreboard at a key time."
Because Logar had only won four games to
Fink's five, her court was cleared and several
Stanford players assumed that Logar had lost.
This,combined with Magnani's defeat of Dea
son on the fourth court (7-5,6-3), inspired the
squad to fight harder.

"I couldn't see what had happened on
ITieresa's court and just assumed that Fink
had won," Yelsey said. "I was under the im
pression that we had to win all the remaining
matches to win the match. I thought we could
pull it off, though, especially because Amber
and I had the momentum in the third sets after
coming back in the second sets."
Durkin finished next, beating Carine Ver
meulen, 7-5,7-5. Liu and Yelsey won their sec
ond sets while Nguyen dropped hers,so all three
moved on to third sets with the dual-match
score tied between the two schools at 2-2.
Yelsey never let USC's Dianne Matias pull
ahead of her in the third set and finished next
with a 2-6,6-4,6-3 victory. Liu played a tense
and tough third set, ultimately prevailing 4-6,
6-3,6-3 over USCs Nelson to clinch the match
for Stanford.
Determination seemed to define Stan
ford's play this weekend, as the Cardinal also
