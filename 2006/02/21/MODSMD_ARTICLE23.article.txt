## Band picks five dollies for 06-07 Sideline dancers kick off 'season' in May 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
The Band announced Sunday morning
the selection of five new Dollies. The five
Dollies, all freshmen, prepare to train for
the next 10 weeks before kicking off their
year-long run with Dollie Splash in early
May.
Listed in order from shortest to tallest,
per Band tradition, the new Dollies are
Brittiany Broadwater, Amy Kurzweil. An
nemarie Estes, Lauren Smith and Abby
Williams.
The outgoing Dollies, again listed by
height, are Maili Alvarado, Lauri Ander
son, Liz Schackmann, Katie Ambrose and
Stacie Vilendrer. All five are sophomores.
The Band and the old Dollies rolled out
next year's group at 5 a.m. Sunday to an
nounce they had been chosen, before
treating the quintet to Denny's.
"1 had just gotten into bed at 2:30 and 1
heard this really loud pounding on my
door," Kurzweil said. "I was like, 'oh shit!';
1 wasn't even thinking."
The Dollies perform alongside the
Band at sporting events and on- and off
campus rallies.
"I just really like to dance," Kurzweil
said. "1 thought it would be a really amaz
ing and cool experience to travel around,
perform for lots of people and represent
Stanford."
Soon, a new Tree will join these new
Dollies. Tree tryouts start Thursday, and
the Band hopes to announce a winner
about a week thereafter.
