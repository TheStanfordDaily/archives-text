As Saturday's "Big Smash" approached, dreary, rainy
weather on the Farm nearly caused the event to be postponed.
And now, after a Stanford rout, California's tennis team prob
ably wishes it would have poured just a little harder.

The sixth-ranked Cardinal (5-0) continued their perfect
season by nearly blanking the No. 16 Golden Bears (4-2) at
the Taube Family Tennis Center, 6-1. Stanford is off to its best
start since the 2002 team opened the year 7-0.
Stanford displayed a complete lineup for the first time this
year, as freshman Matt Bruch returned from injury to play his
first dual match at No. 3 singles. With Bruch in the lineup.

Stanford's top four singles players each won their singles and
doubles matches, carrying Stanford to the victory.
Bruch teamed with junior James Wan at the No. 3 doubles
spot to clinch the doubles point for Stanford. The duo beat
Tyler Browne and John Pettit 8-6. With the pressure on —
the cross-bay rivals had already split the other two doubles
matches, and this match was tied 5-5 — Bruch and Wan won
three of the final four games to clinch Stanford's doubles
point against a ranked opponent this year.
The thrilling victory marked Bruch's first-ever dual match
appearance. He credited his partner for helping him make the
transition.
"That was a new experience for me," Bruch said. "Wan's
returns were amazing. He carried me, and that took a little
pressure off our service games. He stepped up big time, and
that's what you're looking for in an upperclassman."
Senior KC Corkery and junior James Pade, the fifth
ranked doubles team in the nation, earned Stanford's other
doubles victory. The duo defeated Eoin Heavey and Daniel
Sebescen, 8-6, at the No. 1 doubles position.
"We know that every match we play could be close, so the
doubles point [is important]," Pade said. "It is harder to win
four singles matches than three, and it is important for momen
tum. You don't want to [have to] dig yourself out of a hole."
Meanwhile. Stanford's top four single players each won
their matches in straight sets. Corkery led the way at No. 1
with a 6-1.6-0 victory over Lennart Maack, who was substitut
ing for Cal's top player, Pac-1() Player of the Week Conor Ni
land.With the victory, Corkery improves to 15-3 overall in sin
gles and 4-1 in dual match play this year.
Pade remained undefeated in dual match play by beating No.
55 Brown, 6-4,6-3. He is now 13-3 overall. Pade has not dropped
a set while playing at the No. 2 singles position in dual matches.
At No. 3, Bruch cruised to victory against No. 79 Sebescen, 6-
0,6-2. The freshman enjoyed his introduction to college tennis.
"It was fantastic," Bruch said. "1 had never been a part of
the college dual match and that was the first one, against Cal.
We almost swept them, and we were happy about that be
cause we're playing really well."
Pade and the rest of the Cardinal were just as pleased to
see Bruch finally take the court.
"It was great to see Matt back in the lineup," Pade said."lt
helps quite a bit because that's the way the team should be. It
also helps our doubles game a lot."
Wan is also undefeated in dual match play this year. After
playing at No. 3 for the first four matches of the year, he
moved down to the fourth position against Cal. There, he
dominated Cal's Ken Nakahar,6-2,6-l.
Sophomore Phil Kao earned a victory at the No. 6 singles
position on Saturday. I le defeated Pettit (6-2.6-4) for his first
victory in a dual match against a ranked team this year.
The Cardinal's lone loss came at the No. 5 singles position,
where freshman Blake Muller lost to Eoin Heavey,7-5,2-6,6-3.
