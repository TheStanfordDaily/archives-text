### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
The No. 3 women's water polo team (6-
1,3-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
traveled this weekend to southern Califor
nia for the first road contests of their 2(X)6
campaign. After racking up back-to-hack 8-
5 and 11-4 wins in convincing fashion over
No. 11 UC-Santa Barbara and No. l l ) CSU-
Northtidge, the Cardinal returned home
with their perfect conference record intact.
On Saturday afternoon, the Stanford
women opened their weekend against a
tough UCSB Gaucho squad. Fresh off a
third-place finish in the Stanford Invita
tional. the Cardinal looked to carry build
their momentum in what they knew would
be a difficult contest. Earlier this season, the
Gauchos demonstrated their impressive
potential by challenging defending national
champion UCLA in a closely contested
match. But the Santa Barbara women have
struggled at times to maintain that high
level of play. Nevertheless, well aware of
their opponent's abilities, the Stanford
women recognized the importance of tak
ing control of the game early against the
Gauchos.
"Santa Barbara's been inconsistent, but
they're a tough team," junior driver Katie
Hansen said."We went into [the match] ex
pecting a tough game."
The Cardinal accomplished their game
plan by jumping out to a 4-0 first quarter
lead. Hansen played a key role in the Cardi
nal surge by netting two goals in the period.
Freshman Lolo Silver and senior captain
Scotti Shafer also scored to give the Cardi
nal the early advantage.
Despite ultimately falling in an 8-5 de
feat, the Gauchos played the Cardinal even
ly over the remaining three periods of the
game. Stanford was forced to defend against
a relentless Santa Barbara attack, and junior
goalie Meridith McColl's 15 saves were cru
cial in ensuring that the Gaucho comeback
went uncompleted. Silver and Hansen went
on to finish with three goals apiece, and sen
ior captain Laurel Champion provided the
eighth Cardinal tally.

After concluding their match against the
Gauchos.the Cardinal headed to Los Ange
les to take on the Matadors on Sunday. Just
as they had the day before, Stanford took a
4-0 lead after one period of play, extending
the margin to 6-1 at the end of the first half.
Once again, it was Hansen leading the way
with a hat-trick performance, while Silver
and senior two-meter Nancy El-Sakkary
also recorded multiple goals on the day
with two apiece.
In addition to improving their confer
ence record, the weekend also afforded the
Cardinal the opportunity to become reac
quainted with the standard ins-and-outs of
life away from the Farm.
"We got to sort out the routines of the
road trip, and how it all works out." Hansen
said. "So it was nice to get that all figured
out."
This past weekend's visit to UCSB will
prove particularly valuable, as the Cardinal
return to Santa Barbara this coming week
end for the annual Gaucho Invitational.
"It's going to a big weekend for games,
especially with consequences for MPSFs
and NCAAs," Hansen said."lt'll be good to
not need to figure out where we want to
stay and eat, and everything else we need to
do."
Hansen said that it would be "business
as usual" this weekend for her squad as it
prepares for the invitational, which brings
together the top teams in the nation. Al
though the tournament format prevents
Stanford from focusing specifically on any
one team, there are several aspects of their
game that the Cardinal are devoted to im
proving.
"Our defense has been a little scat
tered," Hansen said. "We've been working
on finishing off plays and our team defense
because that's something that needs to be a
strength. In general, we've just been trying
to play with more aggression and be more
explosive, quick and alert."
After taking top-ranked Southern Cali
fornia to the brink in their Stanford Invita
tional showdown, the Cardinal know that if
they play their game, there will be tough to
beat.
"(The Stanford Invitational] showed
that there are a lot of good teams out
there," head coach John Tanner said. "And
it's very exciting to know that we can go
toe-to-toe with any one of them."
