## Mock Trial advances to nationals 'Team takes top honors in regional tournament 
### CHRISTOPHER LIN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Mock Trial took top honors at this
year's regional championship tournament in
Portland, with two of its four teams advancing
to national tournaments that will he held at
the beginning of the spring quarter.
Coached by Frances Lewis, Class of '05,
and first-year law student Meredith Arfa,
Stanford's Team 820 won the regional compe
tition for the second consecutive year. Team
members advance to the National Champi
onship in Des Moines, lowa, during the first
weekend of April. Stanford's Team 822 was a
runner-up at the regional tournament and
earned a bid to a "silver flight" national tour
nament in St. Petersburg. Fla. in March."Silver
flight" tournaments offer runner-up teams
from regional tournaments a second chance to
qualify for the National Championship, and
Team 822 may also attend the Des Moines
tournament if it does well in St. Petersburg.
The regional and national tournaments are
sanctioned by the American Mock Trial Asso
ciation, an organization that provides cases for
teams to study each year. Teams of six to eight
members receive case materials at the begin
ning of the year and prepare both the prosecu
tion and defense for the case, with students
playing the roles of prosecution attorneys, de
fense attorneys and witnesses.
In January, members of the Stanford team at
tended invitationals hosted by UCLA and the
University of Arizona in order to hone their
skills and prepare for regionals. About 20 teams
convened at each tournament to compete in
four rounds spread out over three days, with
each team spending two trials as the prosecution
and two as the defense.The national tournament
is larger, with about 40 schools present.
"Both teams are now beginning prepara
tion for the national tournaments." said John
Heckenlively, a senior and president of Stan
ford Mock Trial. "The AMTA will release
some changes to the case in the next week or
two, at which point our preparation will accel
erate. We meet two to four times per week to
discuss case theory, prepare witnesses and re
fine our presentation."
According to Lewis, Stanford's perform
ance is especially notable because of the diffi
culties it faces as a student-run team.
"Some teams are coached by professors
and some have funding to go to six different
invitational tournaments each year," she ex
plained. "We struggle with funding every year
to pay to send four teams to regionals and at
least one invitational. Even as a coach, I help
with their performance and do not make any
team decisions."
Lewis also noted that the unpredictable na
ture of the activity places high pressure on
team members to perform in unfamiliar condi
tions.
"Because you don't know what witnesses
you get to call during trial until captain's meet
ings 30 minutes before each round, a lot of
preparation goes into knowing multiple sce
narios we might face," she said. "That also
means that each trial is pretty crazy. You've re
hearsed your game plan dozens of times, but
no matter what you still don't know what wit
nesses they are going to call or what objections
they are going to make during trial."
Lewis said that mock trial required the
ability to "think on your feet" and "maintain
composure under extreme levels of stress."
"You also don't know what side you are tak
ing until right before the round starts, so people
who play a crying 14-year-old on one side and
an attorney on the other have to run to the
bathroom to change outfits right before they
compete "she said."You may have no
clue what you are doing, but you have
to smile at the judges and act like
everything is going as planned."
Despite the difficulty of the event.
Stanford's teams expect to do well at
the national tournament.
"I've gone to the championship
each of my past two years on the
team, and 1 can honestly say that our
team going to lowa is the best I've
ever been on," said vice president
John Fowler, a junior. "I fully antici
pate placing in the top 10 there, and
with any luck we'll pick up the cham
pionship trophy, too."
