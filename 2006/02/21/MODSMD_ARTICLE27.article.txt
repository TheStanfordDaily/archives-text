### ADA YEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sunday night in Dinkelspiel Audito
rium. pianist Yea-Ji Kim delivered a
cascading rendition of Chopin's Fan
taisie-Impromptu to match her flowing
sunset-colored dress. Min-Soo Park
followed up in his rich baritone voice,
accompanying himself on the piano.
A woman took Kim's hand to lead
her off stage, and Park gave himself
cheerful applause, but these were the
only signs that Kim is blind and that
Park is visually-impaired and autistic.
The two musicians were part of a
benefit concert organized by students
from the undergraduate community
service group Music4All and mem
bers of the graduate student group
Korean Student Association at Stan
ford (KSAS). Entitled "Beautiful
Mind Concert," the event showcased
award-winning soloist Kim and 12
members of the Onnuri Saßang
Chamber Orchestra, all of whom
were visiting from Korea.
Members of Onnuri, ranging in
age from junior-high school students

to 27 years old, are "differently
abled" — autistic, mentally retarded
or physically challenged.
Other performers included the
Soma Trio (also from Korea), stu
dents from Music4All and the cam
pus a cappella group Testimony.
All proceeds will go the Beautiful
Mind Fund, which was specifically
formed for these performances, and
will be run by the U.S. branch of the
Beautiful Foundation, a non-profit or
ganization based in Korea. The foun
dation supports general philanthropy,
but money in the Beautiful Mind Fund
will only go towards helping the dis
abled. Some proceeds from the Stan
ford performance will also go directly
to the Independent Way and the Cere
bral Palsy Center for the Bay Area.
Members of Music4All said that
the idea for a concert featuring dis
abled artists started modestly.
"We were just going to invite a few
people [from the Onnuri Chamber Or
chestra], but then other people would
get hurt," said Music Prof. William II-
Hwan Bai, a visiting scholar from
Ewha Women's University in Korea
and a member of the Soma IVio. "And
we had to invite their parents, because
they couldn't come by themselves."
Bai is the advisor of the Stanford

Festival Ensemble, an unofficial stu
dent organization founded by mem
bers of KSAS. Bai says that he first
became involved with the Onnuri
Chamber Orchestra a year ago in
Korea, when he performed with them
as part of a concert filmed in a docu
mentary by the Korean educational
broadcasting company. Bai's col
league, Soma Trio violinist Angela In-
Kyung Sohn. established the Onnuri
Chamber Orchestra in 1999.
"I just fell for their beautiful
minds, and I just thought to myself,
we should do this concert," Bai said.
Meanwhile. Music4All president
Misun Hwang, a senior, was devel
oping similar interests. Founded by
Hwang in 2(M)4, Music4All performs
original student compositions and
other classical and jazz repertoire
for the disabled community. They
perform twice a month, both on- and
off-campus, at locations such as the
Coffee House, the San Mateo Dis
ability School and the Palo Alto
Center for the Blind and Visually
Impaired.
Eventually. Music4All grew into a
group of about 50 members, including
alumni who continue to be involved.
They aim to raise awareness about dis
abilities by using their musical talents.

Like Bai. Hwang's inspiration for
Sunday's event came from a docu
mentary film. Hwang saw a docu
mentary about two-fingered Korean
pianist Hee Ah, and with other
Music4All members, began seeking
local disabled musicians with whom
they might put on a concert.Then, by
another twist of fate, Hwang was in
troduced to Bai.
"Meeting him was very much a co
incidence," Hwang said." It was funny
because he was doing the same kind
of activities with Soma that I was
doing here at Stanford,and he was to
tally happy to hear that a student was
doing similar activities. Just synergis
tically, things came together."
Sunday's program opened with
three numbers performed by Testi
mony. Music4All students performed
two original compositions by Hwang,
followed by Yea-Ji Kim's solo, the
Soma TVio and the Onnuri ensemble.
Kim, Onnuri clarinetist Wan Lee and
Onnuri cellist A-Lyung Kim also per
formed a Beethoven trio. The pro
gram closed with a joint performance
of "Amazing Grace."
Music department chair and
Music4All faculty advisor Prof.
Jonathan Berger taught Sohn when
she was a student at Stanford and

wrote the letters requesting visas for
the performers. He said regarding the
event,""I've been to so many con
certs in Dink — many performed by
the world's greatest musicians. Last
night's performance brought tears to
my eyes. 1 found the concert particu
larly moving.
"As we learn more about the
brain, increasing evidence of correla
tions between musical skills and
autism are arising," he continued.
"Music as an expressive means of

communication is not restricted to
any single standard of ability or facil
ity." he said.
Fifth-year electrical engineering
graduate student Hyjun Ra said she
heard about the concert through her
church, where Music4All students
had promoted the performance.
"[The musicians] were very pro
fessional and I was touched —it
made me appreciate how hard it
might be and what music can do to
help us communicate," she said.
