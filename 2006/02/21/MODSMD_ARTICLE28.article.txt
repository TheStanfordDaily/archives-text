### JULIE KLEIN 
How was the "Biggest Party of the Year"?
According to senior Amanda Brophy, co
chair of Stanford's second annual Dance
Marathon, it was great.
As she stated on the event's Web site, "It
is the most unbelievable awesome experi
ence that you will ever have in college
words cannot describe the fun, intensity, and
bonds you will make at the event."
From noon on Saturday until noon on
Sunday, 250 students danced for 24 hours
straight in an effort to raise money for the
Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Founda
tion. Hie foundation, a non-profit organiza
tion founded in 1988, does research to com
bat the pediatric AIDS epidemic.The money
raised is distributed to five hospitals, includ
ing the Stanford Hospital, in hopes of finding
a cure for the disease.
This year's Dance Marathon was a boon
for cause, organizers said.
"As of right now, we have raised
$52,315.42, and we are expecting more dona
tions that will come later," said financial
manager Anthony Chavez, a sophomore.
"It's more than we raised last year, and we

wanted to improve; that was the plan."
Each dancer was required to raise at least
$2(H) by Feb. 1 in order to participate. Dona
tions were also taken at the door.
Several visitors spoke throughout the
event to help motivate the dancers. Jake
Glaser. Elizabeth Glaser's son, spoke at 6
a.m., when fatigue was at its highest. Other
speakers included School of Medicine
Dean Philip Pizzo and Julie Nublick, a
foundation representative who works with
Dance Marathons at universities nation
wide.
The dancers, per rules of the event, stayed
on their feet for the entire affair. They were
accompanied by a group of moralers who
worked three-hour shifts during which they
motivated and supported the dancers.
Morale executive liana Segall, a sopho
more, was in charge of recruiting moralers,
organizing games and keeping the spirits
high.
"I am extraordinarily pleased." Segall
said. "We have so many people who are loyal
to us. It was the dancers who made this, and
they made it amazing."
Freshman Lauren Peat was one dancer
who appreciated the moralers.

"The moraler dance every three hours
was a great idea and really fun," she said.
"Every time 1 hear ['The Way You Make Me
Feel'] now I get pumped up."
Marketing executive Katie Hagey. a
sophomore, said she was also pleased with
the success of the event.
"There are so many highs to dancing that
it's completely worth it," she said.
This year marked the first time Dance
Marathon incorporated community out
reach into the event, according to Education
Executive Tracy Cheung, a junior. With the
Education Committee, Cheung organized
the education speakers, a photo exhibition
and an AIDS quilt that contains more than
3(X) squares.
"1 envisioned [the quilt] last summer
when I learned about AIDS quilts that fami
lies and friends of deceased AIDS individu
als make to commemorate their lives." Che
ung wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. "I
thought it would be a great idea to commem
orate [Dance Marathon participants] in our
own Stanford Dance Marathon 2006 AIDS
quilt."
Dancing wasn't just limited to Stanford
participants. Students from Hillview Middle

School, which serves Menlo Park and Ather
ton, were also involved in the Stanford
Dance Marathon Dance-a-thon.
"Part of the outreach needed to involve
education, so Amanda Brophy and I video
taped a clip at the school that was broadcast
ed on their school television stations during
homeroom," Cheung said. "Ten students
represented Hillview on Saturday from 3 to
6 p.m. Parents were invited and seemed to he
having a blast too."
Participating students, though tired from
a night of incessant boogieing, shared the or
ganizers' enthusiasm.
"I've had a great experience," said fresh
man Chad Bowling, who stayed standing for
the entire 24 hours."No sitting down. I'm ex
hausted, but it's been fun."
Junior Max Hawkins agreed.
" It's a lot of fun. but by the end. you can't
think about anything but lying down." he
said.
Overall, organizers said that the second
annual Dance Marathon was a great success.
Catering executive Nidhi Bhat. a sopho
more, summed up the event on the Web site:
"Awesome people, a great cause, so much
fun â€” what more could you ask for?"
