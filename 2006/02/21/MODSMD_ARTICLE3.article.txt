# STUDENT GROUPS
## Viennese Ball falls short of ticket goal Annual Stanford tradition is losing money, future of the event is uncertain 
### PATRICK LEAHY 
Since 1978, the annual Stanford Viennese Ball
has provided students a chance to trade track jack
ets for tuxes, don gowns and gloves and plunge into
a milieu of waltzes, live orchestras and rose bou
tonnieres for one magical night.
With less than a week until this year's big event,
however, more than 100 tickets remain to be sold,
'leaving organizers hoping for a fairy tale finish to
their months of planning and preparation.
According to senior Louise Nutt, co-chair of the
Viennese Ball Committee, the group needs to sell
between 350 and 400 tickets to cover expenses for
the 2006 ball and to provide a financial cushion for
next year's event. As of this past weekend, fewer
than 250 tickets have been sold.
Roughly two-thirds of the ball's lavish $55,000
budget is funded by ticket sales, with the majority
of tickets being purchased by undergraduates from
all four classes. Seven hundred to 750 students typ
ically attend, as well as about 100 alumni.
"The rest is a combination," Nutt
said. "We get a few faculty, a few staff.
We also have a number of honored
guests, people like the Austrian con
sul general or University officials like
John Bravman."
Organizers offered several possi
ble explanations as to why student in
terest does not appear to be as strong
this year.
"A lot of it is that people just don't
know about it," said senior Alison
Brooks, the committee's other co
chair. She confessed that the commit
tee had gotten off to a late start with
publicity, due in part to difficulties
they had with securing space for the
Austria Week events preceding the
ball.
Organizers also noted that atten
dance spiked a few years ago when
the future of the ball looked uncer
tain. More people chose to go, think
ing it might be their last chance to ex
perience this elaborate Stanford tra
dition.
"We got a bit of a boost at the 27th
ball." Nutt said. "We were very wor
ried that that would be the last ball
because we were worried our special
fees from the ASSU would get cut."
Sophomore Jessica Humphreys,
who helps oversee the logistics of the
ball itself, acknowledged that cost

may be the prohibiting factor for a
number of students.
"The prices are really expensive
in general," she said. "I don't think
the popularity of dance is the prob
lem — we have a huge social dance
community."
Tickets run at $80 per couple for
students, $110 per couple for Stan
ford faculty, staff and alumni, and
$125 per couple for members of the
general public.
Senior Lisa Hira, who said she
does not plan to attend this year,
agreed that these prices were a seri
ous consideration — especially for
those with little background in this
type of affair.
"It's not the kind of thing you
would just do on a whim." she said.
However, Elizabeth Doyle, a
freshman enrolled in social dance
this quarter, said she believes the ex
perience would be well worth the
price.
"It makes sense, since [the ticket
price] tells you how nice the dance
is," she said. "It clues me to the fact
that if I'm going to go, I 'd better be re
ally into it."
While she expressed enthusiasm
for the ball. Doyle said that she ulti
mately decided not to attend this
year. She cited schoolwork and the
fact that many of her friends do not
dance and consequently did not con
sider going as reasons for her deci
sion.
"People don't really seem in
formed about the fact that there are

dance classes the week prior to the
ball," she said. "1 just don't think it's
been very well publicized."
Over the next few days the com
mittee's volunteers will be working
to remedy the apparent lack of pub
licity by visiting dorm house meet
ings and putting up ads on the Face
book Web site to drum up interest.
"We'll be trying to get out a lot
more posters and send out a lot more
e-mails," Humphreys said. "We've
got to hit the people who are already
interested in this sort of thing."
Asked whether they would have
the financial resources to put on an
other ball next year, Humphreys
could not say for sure.
"It's very, very possible that we
won't," she said. "We're lower this
year than we've ever been before.
Usually we have money for next
year."
Still, organizers remain optimistic
about the future.
Nutt mentioned the possibility of
moving the event back to campus,
where it used to be held, or at least
"changing venues to a less expensive
one, maybe even a smaller one. If the
demand is really decreasing, we don't
want to keep holding it in a space
where l(XK) people need to go."
Hie 2(K)6 Viennese Ball will take
place at the Hyatt Regency in
Burlingame from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. on
Friday. Feb. 24. Tickets are currently
on sale in White Plaza and online at

Since 1978, the annual Stanford Viennese Ball
has provided students a chance to trade track jack
ets for tuxes, don gowns and gloves and plunge into
a milieu of waltzes, live orchestras and rose bou
tonnieres for one magical night.
With less than a week until this year's big event,
however, more than 100 tickets remain to be sold,
'leaving organizers hoping for a fairy tale finish to
their months of planning and preparation.
According to senior Louise Nutt, co-chair of the
Viennese Ball Committee, the group needs to sell
between 350 and 400 tickets to cover expenses for
the 2006 ball and to provide a financial cushion for
next year's event. As of this past weekend, fewer
than 250 tickets have been sold.
Roughly two-thirds of the ball's lavish $55,000
budget is funded by ticket sales, with the majority
of tickets being purchased by undergraduates from
all four classes. Seven hundred to 750 students typ
ically attend, as well as about 100 alumni.
"The rest is a combination," Nutt
said. "We get a few faculty, a few staff.
We also have a number of honored
guests, people like the Austrian con
sul general or University officials like
John Bravman."
Organizers offered several possi
ble explanations as to why student in
terest does not appear to be as strong
this year.
"A lot of it is that people just don't
know about it," said senior Alison
Brooks, the committee's other co
chair. She confessed that the commit
tee had gotten off to a late start with
publicity, due in part to difficulties
they had with securing space for the
Austria Week events preceding the
ball.
Organizers also noted that atten
dance spiked a few years ago when
the future of the ball looked uncer
tain. More people chose to go, think
ing it might be their last chance to ex
perience this elaborate Stanford tra
dition.
"We got a bit of a boost at the 27th
ball." Nutt said. "We were very wor
ried that that would be the last ball
because we were worried our special
fees from the ASSU would get cut."
Sophomore Jessica Humphreys,
who helps oversee the logistics of the
ball itself, acknowledged that cost

may be the prohibiting factor for a
number of students.
"The prices are really expensive
in general," she said. "I don't think
the popularity of dance is the prob
lem — we have a huge social dance
community."
Tickets run at $80 per couple for
students, $110 per couple for Stan
ford faculty, staff and alumni, and
$125 per couple for members of the
general public.
Senior Lisa Hira, who said she
does not plan to attend this year,
agreed that these prices were a seri
ous consideration — especially for
those with little background in this
type of affair.
"It's not the kind of thing you
would just do on a whim." she said.
However, Elizabeth Doyle, a
freshman enrolled in social dance
this quarter, said she believes the ex
perience would be well worth the
price.
"It makes sense, since [the ticket
price] tells you how nice the dance
is," she said. "It clues me to the fact
that if I'm going to go, I 'd better be re
ally into it."
While she expressed enthusiasm
for the ball. Doyle said that she ulti
mately decided not to attend this
year. She cited schoolwork and the
fact that many of her friends do not
dance and consequently did not con
sider going as reasons for her deci
sion.
"People don't really seem in
formed about the fact that there are

dance classes the week prior to the
ball," she said. "1 just don't think it's
been very well publicized."
Over the next few days the com
mittee's volunteers will be working
to remedy the apparent lack of pub
licity by visiting dorm house meet
ings and putting up ads on the Face
book Web site to drum up interest.
"We'll be trying to get out a lot
more posters and send out a lot more
e-mails," Humphreys said. "We've
got to hit the people who are already
interested in this sort of thing."
Asked whether they would have
the financial resources to put on an
other ball next year, Humphreys
could not say for sure.
"It's very, very possible that we
won't," she said. "We're lower this
year than we've ever been before.
Usually we have money for next
year."
Still, organizers remain optimistic
about the future.
Nutt mentioned the possibility of
moving the event back to campus,
where it used to be held, or at least
"changing venues to a less expensive
one, maybe even a smaller one. If the
demand is really decreasing, we don't
want to keep holding it in a space
where l(XK) people need to go."
Hie 2(K)6 Viennese Ball will take
place at the Hyatt Regency in
Burlingame from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. on
Friday. Feb. 24. Tickets are currently
on sale in White Plaza and online at
