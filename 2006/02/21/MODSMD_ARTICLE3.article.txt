## Viennese Ball falls short of ticket goal Annual Stanford tradition is losing money, future of the event is uncertain 
### PATRICK LEAHY 
Since 1978, the annual Stanford Viennese Ball
has provided students a chance to trade track jack
ets for tuxes, don gowns and gloves and plunge into
a milieu of waltzes, live orchestras and rose bou
tonnieres for one magical night.
With less than a week until this year's big event,
however, more than 100 tickets remain to be sold,
'leaving organizers hoping for a fairy tale finish to
their months of planning and preparation.
According to senior Louise Nutt, co-chair of the
Viennese Ball Committee, the group needs to sell
between 350 and 400 tickets to cover expenses for
the 2006 ball and to provide a financial cushion for
next year's event. As of this past weekend, fewer
than 250 tickets have been sold.
Roughly two-thirds of the ball's lavish $55,000
budget is funded by ticket sales, with the majority
of tickets being purchased by undergraduates from
all four classes. Seven hundred to 750 students typ
ically attend, as well as about 100 alumni.
