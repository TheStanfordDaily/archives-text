## Alum donates $30 million to institute Ward W. Woods commits to Institute for the Environment 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
Last Thursday, University officials an
nounced that Ward W. Woods, Class of '64 and
a Stanford trustee, plans to commit $30 million
to the Stanford Institute for the Environment.
The gift will be used to launch programs and
fund research in the field of environmental sci
ence and policy. In recognition of the gift, the
institute will be renamed the Ward W. and
Priscilla B. Woods Institute for the Environ
ment at Stanford.
"Stanford University has long been recog
nized for its broad strengths in environmental
scholarship. The Woods' generous gift builds
on that foundation and enables us to expand
our efforts," President John Hennessy said in a
statement. "Through his leadership and serv
ice to the University, Ward has done much to
contribute to its excellence. He has a great ap
preciation for what it takes to nurture innova
tion. The Ward W. and Priscilla B. Woods Insti
tute for the Environment at Stanford will
serve as an incubator â€” pioneering multidis
ciplinary solutions to environmental chal

lenges and educating the next generation of
leaders on these issues."
The Woods Institute will play an integral
role in Stanford's Initiative for Environmental
Sustainability, which seeks to balance human
needs with the delicate supply of the Earth's
natural resources in order to provide a sustain
able existence for future generations.
"Solving the world's urgent environmental
problems takes bold ideas from leaders and
experts in many fields and involves collabora
tion of researchers from diverse disciplines,"
Woods said in the statement. "Most of all, it
takes a conviction that these problems are
largely solvable and a tough-minded commit
ment to seeking the solutions that gain trac
tion in the real world. Stanford's preeminence
as a research university and its history of mul
tidisciplinary cooperation provide the best ac
ademic combination for addressing these
problems."
According to Hennessy, only about $1 mil
lion of Woods' donation has been slated for
use, and even that much is tentative. It is cer
tain, however, that none of the money will go
towards the new Environment & Energy
Building, which is expected to open in late
2007. The building will be a part of the new En
gineering Quad, set for completion in 2012.
