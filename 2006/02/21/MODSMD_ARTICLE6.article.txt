## Alum donates $30 million to institute Ward W. Woods commits to Institute for the Environment 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
Last Thursday, University officials an
nounced that Ward W. Woods, Class of '64 and
a Stanford trustee, plans to commit $30 million
to the Stanford Institute for the Environment.
The gift will be used to launch programs and
fund research in the field of environmental sci
ence and policy. In recognition of the gift, the
institute will be renamed the Ward W. and
Priscilla B. Woods Institute for the Environ
ment at Stanford.
"Stanford University has long been recog
nized for its broad strengths in environmental
scholarship. The Woods' generous gift builds
on that foundation and enables us to expand
our efforts," President John Hennessy said in a
statement. "Through his leadership and serv
ice to the University, Ward has done much to
contribute to its excellence. He has a great ap
preciation for what it takes to nurture innova
tion. The Ward W. and Priscilla B. Woods Insti
tute for the Environment at Stanford will
serve as an incubator â€” pioneering multidis
ciplinary solutions to environmental chal

lenges and educating the next generation of
leaders on these issues."
The Woods Institute will play an integral
role in Stanford's Initiative for Environmental
Sustainability, which seeks to balance human
needs with the delicate supply of the Earth's
natural resources in order to provide a sustain
able existence for future generations.
"Solving the world's urgent environmental
problems takes bold ideas from leaders and
experts in many fields and involves collabora
tion of researchers from diverse disciplines,"
Woods said in the statement. "Most of all, it
takes a conviction that these problems are
largely solvable and a tough-minded commit
ment to seeking the solutions that gain trac
tion in the real world. Stanford's preeminence
as a research university and its history of mul
tidisciplinary cooperation provide the best ac
ademic combination for addressing these
problems."
According to Hennessy, only about $1 mil
lion of Woods' donation has been slated for
use, and even that much is tentative. It is cer
tain, however, that none of the money will go
towards the new Environment & Energy
Building, which is expected to open in late
2007. The building will be a part of the new En
gineering Quad, set for completion in 2012.
"Ward Woods is very active in
supporting the work of various or
ganizations involved in conservation
and has been very involved in help
ing formulate the goals and vision of
the environmental initiative at Stan
ford," said Jeffrey Koseff, co-director
of the Woods Institute and the
Michael Forman University Fellow
in Undergraduate Education."ln the
near term the money [he donated]
will be used for our Environmental
Ventures Program, for supporting
some of the strategic collaborations
we are building in the area of food
security and the environment, in en
ergy efficiency and in developing a
new environmental leadership and
management program with some of
the professional schools at Stan
ford."

The Institute acts as a synthesizer
for the many different areas of envi
ronmental study and research, ex
plained the Woods Institute commu
nications manager, Kathy Neal.
"One of the most challenging as
pects about environmental prob
lems is that they're not simple," she
said. "They involve science, policy,
laws and regulations, human behav
ior, economics and many other fac
tors. So to solve them, we need to en
gage scientists, engineers, social sci
entists, business people, healthcare
professionals, policymakers, non
governmental organizations and
many others. The Woods gift will
help move our efforts forward sig
nificantly."
The gift has already begun fund
ing two important research projects.
The Program on Global Food Secu
rity and the Environment, a joint
project with the Freeman Spogli In
stitute for International Studies, is
the first study to receive support.The
project aims to find new solutions to

the "closely related problems of
hunger and destructive farming
practices around the globe." The
other project is a new center for en
ergy efficiency, which will investigate
"innovative, economically sound
technologies, policies and systems
for reducing energy consumption
and for using energy more efficient
ly."
"The initiative on Environmental
Sustainability has been funded to
date by a mix of University funds and
from private donations," said Koseff.
"Stanford is extremely fortunate to
have many very committed alums
and friends who have supported its
various initiatives in very generous
ways. As generous as our donors are,
the Woods gift is very distinctive be
cause of its size. The magnitude of
this gift is very reflective of not only
the commitment of Ward and Priscil
la Woods to the environment and to
sustainable development, but also to
Stanford University and its success
in the future."

Other investors are also intrigued
by the Initiative for Environmental
Sustainability and have made dona
tions. Melvin B. and Joan F. Lane
made a donation, which was
matched by the William and Flora
Hewlett Foundation. Other donors
have contributed as well. All in all,
donations to the initiative amount to
more than $40 million.
"The Woods' gift will help the
Institute, and the environmental
initiative more broadly, to both de
velop working solutions to the
world's environmental problems
and train environmental leaders."
Buzz Thompson. Koseff's counter
part at the Woods Institute, said.
"Stanford's goal is to work actively
with private and public decision
makers around the world to find,
develop and implement working
solutions.The Woods' gift will allow
Stanford to significantly expand
this collaborative work and thereby
improve global environmental sus
tainability."
