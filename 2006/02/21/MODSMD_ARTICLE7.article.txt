# SPECIAL EVENT
## Wyden calls for inquiry Congressman calls for greater oversight in NSA wiretapping 
### JAMES HOHMANN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Or.) joined a chorus of
prominent Republicans and Democrats on Fri
day when he called for more congressional
oversight and a bipartisan inquiry into the Na
tional Security Agency (NSA) domestic wire
tapping program. Calling for a "new accounta
bility," the Senate Select Intelligence Commit
tee member told Stanford Law students, at a

panel sponsored by the Stanford Law and Poli
cy Review (SLPR), that the executive must be
more responsive to the legal directives of the
legislature.
"I've got an election certificate to be some
thing other than a potted plant," said Wyden. "I
have a constitutional responsibility for over
sight.
"Even by Beltway standards, it is a very
bizarre debate," he continued. "Congress is
talking about reforming a program that it
knows nothing about."
Wvden, Class of '71, took a more moderate
approach in his 20 minute speech
than some of his Democratic con
gressional colleagues have in recent
weeks. Avoiding acerbic rhetoric, he
said that national security and civil
liberties are not mutually exclusive.
"It's possible to fight terrorism fe
rociously without sacrificing our civil
liberties," he said, drawing the analo
gy of a teeter-totter that adjusts de
pending on the threat level. "The
President of the United States and
Commander-in-Chief needs flexibili
ty to deal with serious threats at a
time we are at war."
The Democrat chastised some in
his party, including 2(X)4 presidential
candidate Senator John Kerry (D-
Mass.), for saying that the struggle
against terror in the aftermath of
Sept. 11 is not a war.
"Sen. Kerry made a big mistake
substantively and politically when he
said this was a kind of police action,"
he said. "This is a war."
Wyden said that the flexibility the
president needs in wartime should be
accompanied by what he termed a
"new accountability."
"If Congress acts, since it is a mat
ter of law, it needs to be honored," he
said. "We ought to respect the rule of
law. After we have had a debate, we
all ought to say that we are going to
respect and comply with that law. We
cannot have a situation where the
Congress passes a law and the presi
dent does not follow it."
Alluding to former President
Ronald Reagan, Wyden said that
Congress should "trust but verify"
the claims of the administration. In
order to do that, he said more mem
bers of Congress need to know the
"nuts and bolts of operational de
tails."
Wyden said he could not disclose
classified information he learned dur
ing a two-hour closed-door Intelli
gence Committee session last Thurs
day. The Democrats had hoped to
vote for the opening of an investiga
tion into the program, the Washing
ton Post reported yesterday, but the
committee adjourned without taking
a vote.
Wyden's comments come amid in
creasing tension between Congress
and the White House over the pro
gram that came to light in December.
Even staunch conservative allies
have called for the administration to
provide more information to more
members of Congress. The New York
Times reported yesterday that the
Republican chairmen of the Judicia
ry, Homeland Security and Intelli
gence Committees have said they
want more judicial review and
greater congressional oversight of the
NSA program.
The White House, in negotiations
with congressional leadership, is try
ing to secure enough votes to retroac
tively authorize the program, the
same article said.
A federal judge ordered the gov
ernment last Thursday to release de
tails about the NSA program as part
of a suit followed by the Electronic
Privacy Information Center, accord
ing to the Associated Press.
The Wyden comments were made
in a speech that followed a panel dis
cussion about the program. On a
panel moderated by Stanford Law
Prof. Pam Karlan. University of Mis
souri Law Prof. Kris Kobach — a for
mer Justice Department attorney —
defended the program when it was
assailed by law student Laura Dono
hue and Law Prof. Alan Morrison.
Kobach. who led government ef
forts to tighten border security in the
aftermath of Sept. 11, said that it was
"prudent" to rely on broad, inherent
executive war fighting powers under
Article Two of the Constitution, in
stead of "broadcasting what we are
going to do on a billboard to al
Qaeda."
"The case law is very strong," he
said."The administration's position is

very unlikely to he knocked down in
the court."
Kobach complained that the bur
dens to get court approval for surveil
lance could prevent the government
from using important discoveries
made on the battlefield. One example
he gave to justify the program was the
capture of senior al Qaeda leader
Khalid Shaikh Mohammed's laptop.
Hundreds of non-labeled phone
numbers were found in files. To re
ceive permission for surveillance
from the court under the Foreign In
telligence Surveillance Act (FISA),
he said that the government must
provide the name or a description of
who is being monitored. In this case,
the government only knew that the
numbers were connected to a master
mind of the Sept. 11 attacks but noth
ing else.
"FISA was written in 1978 before
anyone conceived of laptops or e
mails," he said. "The constitutional in
firmity of FISA was suspected even
as members of Congress were writing
it."
Morrison dismissed the example
as unrealistic and complained that in
nocent people almost certainly have
had their private conversations
recorded by the government.
"We don't know how wide this
electronic vacuum cleaner is in
sweeping." he said. "You can't narrow
down unless you start by intercepting
a lot more. If you don't know what
they are doing, it is hard to stop it or
try to control it."
Donohue, also a fellow at the Cen
ter for International Security and Co
operation (ClSAC).said the adminis
tration has acted illegally and listed
nearly a dozen examples of executive
overreach.
"There is no precedent is U.S. his
tory for violating an act of Congress
intended to limit executive power"
she said. "The state of federal data
mining is mind-boggling."
Friday's discussion was the first
of a series of panels on the law of in
telligence. Three panels are sched
uled for Wednesday, featuring rep
resentatives from the intelligence
community, judiciary and academia.
SLPR is hosting the events to coin
cide with the publication of a special
edition of their journal about intelli
gence.
SLPR Managing editor Joe Edel
lieit Ross, a second-year law student,
is one of the coordinators of these
events. Ross, who served in the Navy
as an intelligence officer for eight
years and worked in the intelligence
community, called intelligence a
timely issue that is a "magnet for de
bate right now."
"Reports of domestic 'spying' by
the NSA have obviously brought re
cent attention to the topic, but the
legal issues raised by intelligence ex
tend beyond the current debate over
how to balance security and civil lib
erties." Ross wrote in an e-mail toThe
Daily."lntelligence policy also impli
cates issues related to criminal law,
administrative law, torts and the sep
aration of powers.
"We provided a platform for op
posing sides on a lightning-rod issue
to articulate their positions," he said,
characterizing the event as a success.
