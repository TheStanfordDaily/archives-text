## IHUM TFs face research leave cuts Budget restraints sharply reduce paid research leaves 
### CHRISTIAN TOM STAFF WRITER 
Due to financial constraints. University ad
ministrators have reconsidered the practice of
granting paid research leaves for Teaching Fel
lows (TFs) in the Introduction to the Humani
ties (IHUM) Program. Effective immediately,
paid research leaves will he sharply cut, and
eliminated entirely in the case of new TFs.
In what IHUM TFs consider a matter of
misplaced budgetary priorities, the Office of
the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion (VPUE) has decided not to devote Uni
versity funds to afford the TFs additional time
to conduct research. This research had been
previously paid for by an outside grant.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education
John Bravman, whose office controls funding
for programs in VPUE, explained that all
IHUM TFs are "appointed for three years of
service."
Until now, TFs received two quarters off
during their three years of teaching.
This time allowed them to focus on
their research and what is known as
"professional development."
Now, TFs face what they call sti
fling cutbacks on that research time.
The TFs "are given what is called
research leave quarter." Bravman ex
plained in an interview with The
Daily. "For several years, that was
augmented by a second quarter, paid
for out of the Mellon Foundation.
That grant ended and was not re
newed."
What appears as a cut-and-dry
issue to Bravman's office is consid
ered by the TFs as a matter of their
livelihood.
"All Fellows are concerned," said
one TF, who wished to remain anony
mous due to the possible repercus
sions of his comments. "This is a
group movement; we are all affected,
the first-years most of all."
The TFs consider the research
time crucial to their careers, as they
seek to gain tenure-track positions in
an increasingly competitive job mar
ket.
In addition, the research leaves
have served as powerful incentives
for Stanford's IHUM Program to at
tract the best post-doctoral appli
cants in the nation.There were 6(X) to
7(X) applicants for 12 Teaching Fellow
spots last year, according toTF Lynn
Patyk.
"The quarter leave encourages
TFs to stay," Patyk said. "So there is
not much job search among first-year
TFs."
Other TFs echoed the sentiment
of gratitude.
"We were grateful [for the re
search leaves] because it makes the
position not dead-end," said TF Stu
art Finkel, who is currently taking his
second research leave quarter this
winter.
"TFs don't have to worry about
research or writing when teaching
because they know that they have
that time for professional develop
ment," he added.

Under the revised system, all
newly-hiredTFs will be subject to the
new rubric and will not receive
leaves. Fellows hired with a two
quarter research provision in their
contracts will receive only one quar
ter of research time.
Because a source of replacement
funds could not be identified, "the
current first-year Fellows [will] be
getting one quarter leave rather than
two," said Bravman. "Current sec
ond-year Fellows will be getting their
second quarter's leave next year in
their then-third year."
Ellen Woods, associate director of
IHUM, defended the decision: "The
appointment letters did not promise
two quarters of research leave; the
letters noted that research leaves
would be subject to availability of
funding."
IHUM TFs were informed of the
decision last Friday via an e-mail
from Bravman.
On Feb. 13, what Bravman called
a "delegation of Fellows" met with
the Vice Provost.
The purpose of the visit was to
"express concerns and ask questions
about status change," according to
Patyk.
Patyk added that the TFs wanted
to "present the case that the research
leaves improve the quality of teach
ing and the [IHUM] program in gen
eral."
Some wondered why current TFs
were not "grandfathered" and grant
ed the research leaves they feel they
had been promised.That funding was
never fully guaranteed. Bravman ex
plained.
"The second leave quarter is de
scribed as pending availability of
funding,"he said."And that availabil
ity is now not eventuated."
Other grievances cited by TFs in
cluded being informed so late in the
process.
"Had we been brought in the
process earlier, it would have been
helpful," said Patyk. "We were pre
sented with a fait accompli."
Bravman conceded that "some
time in the fall" he knew the Mellon
Grant would be expiring, but attrib
uted the time lapse in informing the
TFs to spending "time trying to see if
we could budget a make-up."

However, after going through the
budget cycle, it became clear that
such a make-up "wasn't going to hap
pen," according to Bravman.
The concerned TFs were not
alone in their meeting with Bravman,
as they were joined by Phaedra Bell,
academic research and program offi
cer in the IHUM office, and Associ
ate French and Italian Prof. Joshua
Landy.
Some at the meeting expressed
sentiments that the administration is
neglecting the TFs' interests in favor
of other programs, complaining of
cuts across the humanities, among
other things.
"The market allows the Universi
ty to underpay non-permanent
teaching staff," lamented Patyk.
Finkel added that such actions are
possible "because [University offi
cials] know there will be hundreds of
others who desperately need jobs
like these."
The administration, however, said
it sees things differently.
"Decisions have to be made about
the priorities," Bravman said. "And
ultimately that's my job to make."
"There are always tough choices
to make among competing priorities
when balancing budgets," added
Woods.
While Bravman commended the
"hard work and dedication" of TFs,
he said that their hope for University
money is unlikely to come to fruition.
Parties on both sides wondered if
the change in research time might af
fect the quality of teaching among
TFs.
"TFs may devote less time to
teaching," Patyk predicted, "because
they must squeeze in time for writing
and job search. Ultimately, the two
groups affected most are the TFs and
their students."
Bravman replied that the admin
istration was aware of the conse
quences of the decision.
"Obviously, I'm concerned about
[possible changes to TFs' interaction
with students]," he said. "All 1 can say
is I hope they choose not to let it do
so."
As for now, there are no plans to
look outside the University for funds.
"I don't think that's likely to even
tuate," said Bravman.
