BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) — Iran backed calls from
other Muslim and world leaders Monday for an end to vi
olent protests over the Prophet Muhammad cartoons,
urging calm after weeks of demonstrations that have left
at least 45 people dead in the Muslim world.
Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki.on a visit
to European Union headquarters, said he and EU foreign
policy chief Javier Solana urged better dialogue between the
Muslim world and the West over respect and tolerance.
"We accepted to cooperate with each other to calm
down the situation, not to offend the values, religious val
ues in particular from one side, and freedom of expres
sion from the other side — some kind of balance," Mot
taki told reporters. "We should try to cool down the situ
ation. We do not support any violence."
Pope Benedict XVI also tried to soothe the tensions
Monday, saying religious symbols must be respected but
violence can never be justified.
Malaysia's prime minister warned that mistrust and
fear of Islam is growing every day in the West.
In Afghanistan, where 11 people were killed in three
days of protests earlier this month, about 2,(XM) students
protested Monday,shouting"Long live Osama!" burning
Danish and American flags and photos of President
Bush.
In Indonesia, about 100 protesters shouting "God is
Great!" burned a Danish flag in Java province, a day after
protesters attacked the American Embassy in the capi
tal, Jakarta.
The caricatures first printed in a Danish newspaper in
September and republished recently in other European
papers, offended many Muslims. One depicted the
prophet with a turban shaped like a bomb with a lit fuse.
Mottaki added that freedom of expression must be
exercised with sensitivity and with respect for others' val
ues and beliefs.

"We are facing... angry Muslims all around the world.
We have to try our best to avoid any violence," he said.
"This is what we are trying to do in Iran.... So many of our
policemen were attacked by angry people on the streets."
UN. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is making an un
expected trip to Qatar this weekend to try to calm the vi
olent reaction to the cartoons, at a meeting to promote
religious and cultural understanding.
"He hopes ... to meet with a number of leaders from
Europe and from the Islamic world and to discuss with
them ways of calming the situation and allowing a con

structive dialogue between people of different faiths and
traditions based on mutual understanding and respect,"
U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Monday.
In Copenhagen. Danish Foreign Minister Per Stig
Moeller warned that al-Qaida terrorists were exploiting
the outrage over the drawings and condemned a Pak
istani cleric who last Friday offered a $1 million bounty
for killing one of the cartoonists.
"When money is put on the cartoonists' heads, then
terror is also being used," Moeller said. "It's incitement
to murder. Murder is also banned by the Quran."
