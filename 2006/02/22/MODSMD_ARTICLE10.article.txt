## The 						DARK side of the Force Google's compliance with censorship in China sparks larger debate 
### JANET KIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In 1996, when Stanford computer science gradu
ate students Larry Page and Sergey Brin toyed
with a search engine that would one day revolu
tionize the internet world with its powerful
search and retrieval capabilities, they might have
dreamed that Google would one day become a house
hold name. To Google an obscure geographical loca
tion, a homework assignment, or even a potential
mate is hardly an unfamiliar concept in today's world,
where the name of the search engine has become syn
onymous with the very concept of internet searches.
But it is doubtful that the founders of Google ever en
visioned that one day they would be the center of a
free-speech controversy of grand proportions.
The censorship inherent in Google China is proving
to be a hot topic of debate. While Google serviced its
Chinese audience with a Chinese language version of
the search engine until the recent launch of Google
China. Yet the earlier web site was often unreliable,
due to heavy external censorship.
"Many queries, especially politically sensitive
queries, were not making it through to Google's
servers," said Elliot Schrage, Google's Vice President
of Global Communications and Public Affairs, in a tes
timony to the U.S. House of Representatives Commit
tee on International Relations. "And access became
often slow and unreliable, meaning that our service in
China was not something we felt proud of. Even
though we weren't doing any self-censorship, our re
sults were being filtered anyway, and our service was
being actively degraded on top of that."
When Google sought to roll out a service physically
based in China, a booming market with more than 105
million Internet users, the Chinese government
tioned this on Google's compliance with content re
strictions. These restrictions, generally defined in na
tional laws and regulation, justify censorship in the
name of unity and security. Broad guidelines for cen
sorship range from materials "harming the honor or
the interests of the nation" to "disrupting national poli
cies on religion, propagating evil cults and feudal su
perstitions" to "spreading rumors, disturbing social

order, or disrupting social stability."
Under this agreement, all searches conduct
ed through Google China would be filtered
for content that violated content restrictions;
netizens searching for images of the Tianan
men Square protests of 1989, for example,

would find that their

search results did not

include pictures of the

famous 'Tiananmen Tank

Man,' a lone protester who faced off a row of on-

coming tanks after the massacre. Tests conducted by
CNETNews.com found that the censors also blocked
sites promoting political dissent, homosexuality, alco
hol, and other "subversive" practices.
"We are concerned about the apparent contribu
tions U.S. technology companies are making to China's
capability to control and repress information, and to
identify and penalize those who express views contrary
to the government's," Carolyn Bartholemew, acting
chairman of the U.S.-China Economic and Security
Review Commission said, in testimony before the
Congressional Human Rights Caucus. "Google's cur
rent cooperation with the Chinese government on this
matter also has prevented the Chinese government
from having to respond to complaints from Chinese In
ternet users that they are being denied access to infor
mation they wish to obtain."
While other search engines operating in China are
held to the same standards of censorship, Google's vol
untary censorship has caused public uproar largely be
cause of its image as a savvy, young and anti-establish
ment institution. Operating under the unofficial motto
of "Don't Be Evil," Google has built its reputation on a
minimalist, no-frills search interface and a quirky, cre
ative work environment considered the embodiment of
the dot-com ideal. In an action that broke ranks with
competitors like Yahoo! and Microsoft, Google also re
fused to comply with a subpoena from the U. S. Depart
ment of Justice that was aimed at enforcing anti
pornography laws. Citing privacy concerns, Google de
fied the order to turn over "a multi-stage random sam

pie of one million URLs," and a computer file with "the
text of each search string entered onto Google's search
engine over a one-week period."
It is not unusual, then, that Google's stance on cen
sorship in China is earning criticism from supporters
and skeptics alike. Google China is seen as both a be
trayal of dearly held ideals and an example of corpo
rate selfishness.
"Google's willingness to be long on democratic pro
nouncements but short on meaningful actions — or, at
the very least, words — that encourage change in the
world's largest non-democratic nation smacks of cor
porate doublespeak," blasted Michael Boyer of the
Weekly Standard. "If popular demand for Google in
China is so massive, why sit idly by as the Chinese ob
struct access to information?"
Google's response is that internet access, even in a
limited form, radically improves the political climate.
"The backdrop to Google's decision to launch
Google.cn is the explosive growth of the Internet in
China," Schrage said. "To put it simply, the Internet is
transforming China for the better. And the weight of
the evidence suggests that the Internet is accelerating
and deepening these positive trends, even in an imper
fect environment."
He also noted that access to the Chinese language
version of Google.com remains intact.
"Our new Google.cn Web site is an additional serv
ice, not a replacement for Google.com in China. The
Chinese-language Google.com will remain open, unfil
tered and available to all Internet users worldwide."

This incident has incited vigorous

discourse about the role of technology

companies and government in interna-

tional censorship. On one hand, compa-
a. la. • i • i r ii.'

nies argue that it is logical for multina-

tional corporations to abide by restric-

tions imposed by the countries

in which thev operate.

| But risks are unique-

ly high in China be-

cause of the combination of
a large market and authoritarian government.
"Companies don't like to argue with the Chinese
government because that's the largest consumer mar
ket in the world," Rohit Deshpande, professor of glob
al marketing at Harvard Business School, said in an in
terview with The Washington Post. "If this was Lithua
nia, this would be a different issue. China, India, those
are countries where you walk on egg shells."
Critics, however, cite a broader responsibility to
freedom that both the government and members of the
private sector hold.
"The U.S. government is supposed to be at the
cutting-edge of the fight for online freedom, espe
cially since passage of the Global Internet Freedom
Act," the Reporters Without Borders press freedom
group said in recent letters to government officials.
"Yet it places no restrictions on private-sector activ
ity even when firms work with some of the world's
most repressive regimes. We condemn this
hypocrisy."
Google agreed with this perspective, but cautiously
deferred to the federal government the responsibility
of reforming Chinese censorship through diplomatic
action.
"The U.S. government should seek to bolster the
global reach and impact of our Internet information in
dustry by placing obstacles to its growth at the top of
our trade agenda." Schrage explained. "At the risk of
oversimplification, the United States should treat cen
sorship as a barrier to trade, and raise that issue in ap
propriate fora."
