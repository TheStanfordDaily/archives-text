# Engineering for the "Big One"? (part I)
## 
### 
If you're thirsty when the next big earth
quake hits, it's probably not advisable to
be in San Francisco — unless you'd like to
live without water for two months.
To whom may we owe this potential dehy
dration? Perhaps the politicians, of both the
early 1900 sand the early 2000s. But let us not
forget the engineers.
Potable water for more than 2.4 million
people — including those on Stanford's cam
pus— flows into the Bay Area each day,
thanks to the 160-mile long Hetch Hetchy sys
tem that brings in clean water from the Sierra
Nevada. It is this system of aqueducts, dams,
powerhouses, pumps and tunnels that has en
abled the otherwise freshwater-deprived city
of San Francisco to grow to its current size.
Engineers almost uniformly describe this sys
tem, approved in 1910 and operational in
1934, as a technological "marvel."
For years, however, the San Francisco
Chronicle has reported on this system's dete
riorating infrastructure, due largely to a lack
of funding and maintenance. In the event of a
major earthquake — which experts in 1995
said was likely within the next 30 years — the
system is vulnerable.
How vulnerable? Well, the Hetch Hetchy
system crosses both the Hayward and San
Andreas faults. An earthquake could cut off
85 percent of the water supply to San Francis

co for up to 60 days.
Oops.
In the abstract, constructing a system of
aqueducts, pipelines and tunnels through
mountains and over fault lines to move water
160 miles may perhaps seem incautious and
ill-fated. So may have been building a series of
levees and floodwalls to enable a city off the
Gulf of Mexico to sit nine feet below sea level.
At its base, the existence of these systems
and the cities they support is dependent on
engineers and engineering, whether to hold
back the waters of Lake Pontchartrain or to
move potable water through our foothills.
Without engineers. New Orleans would be
flooded and San Francisco would be much
smaller and at risk of decimation by fire for
dearth of water.
The devastation Hurricane Katrina
wrought on New Orleans has prompted fo

cused debate over whether sustaining a city
predisposed to flooding is worth the risk or
cost and caused homeowners nationwide to
wonder whether they unknowingly inhabit
floodplains. However, it has failed to prompt
a real societal reevaluation of how far we are
willing to go to solve important problems,
when we in the process expose people to in
frequent but acute risks.
How can the Hetch Hetchy system be de
scribed as "incautious" or "ill-fated" if it has
reliably provided water for more than 70
years? Good question. Certainly the havoc
New Orleans' levee collapse shouldn't
prompt a loss of faith in all engineered sys
tems. But still, taking stock of the status quo
requires considering at least two questions:
how do we end up with these systems, and
when does the power of nature begin to
trump the ingenuity of engineers?
As any history buff could tell you, what en
gineered systems we end up with is in impor
tant ways not decided by engineers. Consider
Hetch Hetchy. Undertaking the development
of an "engineering marvel" requires a public
belief in the ability of technology to create
systems that, in a less optimistic time, could
seem incautious and ill-fated. In founding the
Farm, Leland Stanford envisioned a universi
ty that promoted advances in engineering and
science as a means to near-limitless human

progress. II he's representative of his era, it's
not such a big surprise that San Franciscans in
1910 supported the $45 million bond measure
to pay for the construction of their water im
portation system.
(That sentiment may not have faded. In a
2005 document, the San Francisco Public
Utilities Commission fondly reflected on the
how Hetch Hetchy's engineers were able to
"meet the challenges of hydraulic engineer
ing across more than 160 miles of wilderness"
by "mastering impassable terrain.") (look at
cutting if necessary)
But importantly, we don't live today with
Hetch Hetchy water simply because it was the
clear and reasoned choice of engineers. With
out the backing of influential politicians and
the urgent desire to increase firefighting abil
ity after the 1906 earthquake. Hetch Hetchy
may have never been built. If so, we'd live
today with water imported from somewhere
else with a differently-engineered system.
That we use Hetch Hetchy now doesn't mean
it couldn't, and maybe shouldn't, have been
another way.
The question of when reasonably cost-ef
fective engineering cannot mitigate rare dan
ger is more complex. It's dependent upon
funding levels, emotional attachments, and
the public's perception and willingness to ac
cept risk.

Does the public still trust in the power of
engineering, or have Katrina and other fail
ures made the United States more risk
averse? Are we — and should we be — less
willing to develop cities in floodplains, or re
quiring dams on fault lines? Would you buy a
house in San Francisco if you knew that, in the
event of a major earthquake, there was a 90%
chance you wouldn't have drinking water for
a month? What about a 10% chance?
Our answers to these questions should un
derlie views of how much risk society should
bear by providing funding to mitigate these
risks. Answers to these questions should also
be predicated upon an understanding of the
abilities and limits of engineering — and how
engineers consider risk in building systems
like the Hetch Hetchy, which, while normally
adequate, may at some point stick you with a
hefty two-month Aquafina bill.
The question and complexity of risk will be
addressed next week — and comparing Stan
ford's water system to San Francisco's
demonstrates that susceptibility to a given
risk may not be uniform.
And, if you can't wait a week, don't worry
— Stanford has a back-up water system in the
case of a Hetch-Hetchy failure.

thanks to the 160-mile long Hetch Hetchy sys
tem that brings in clean water from the Sierra
Nevada. It is this system of aqueducts, dams,
powerhouses, pumps and tunnels that has en
abled the otherwise freshwater-deprived city
of San Francisco to grow to its current size.
Engineers almost uniformly describe this sys
tem, approved in 1910 and operational in
1934, as a technological "marvel."
For years, however, the San Francisco
Chronicle has reported on this system's dete
riorating infrastructure, due largely to a lack
of funding and maintenance. In the event of a
major earthquake — which experts in 1995
said was likely within the next 30 years — the
system is vulnerable.
How vulnerable? Well, the Hetch Hetchy
system crosses both the Hayward and San
Andreas faults. An earthquake could cut off
85 percent of the water supply to San Francis

co for up to 60 days.
Oops.
In the abstract, constructing a system of
aqueducts, pipelines and tunnels through
mountains and over fault lines to move water
160 miles may perhaps seem incautious and
ill-fated. So may have been building a series of
levees and floodwalls to enable a city off the
Gulf of Mexico to sit nine feet below sea level.
At its base, the existence of these systems
and the cities they support is dependent on
engineers and engineering, whether to hold
back the waters of Lake Pontchartrain or to
move potable water through our foothills.
Without engineers. New Orleans would be
flooded and San Francisco would be much
smaller and at risk of decimation by fire for
dearth of water.
The devastation Hurricane Katrina
wrought on New Orleans has prompted fo

cused debate over whether sustaining a city
predisposed to flooding is worth the risk or
cost and caused homeowners nationwide to
wonder whether they unknowingly inhabit
floodplains. However, it has failed to prompt
a real societal reevaluation of how far we are
willing to go to solve important problems,
when we in the process expose people to in
frequent but acute risks.
How can the Hetch Hetchy system be de
scribed as "incautious" or "ill-fated" if it has
reliably provided water for more than 70
years? Good question. Certainly the havoc
New Orleans' levee collapse shouldn't
prompt a loss of faith in all engineered sys
tems. But still, taking stock of the status quo
requires considering at least two questions:
how do we end up with these systems, and
when does the power of nature begin to
trump the ingenuity of engineers?
As any history buff could tell you, what en
gineered systems we end up with is in impor
tant ways not decided by engineers. Consider
Hetch Hetchy. Undertaking the development
of an "engineering marvel" requires a public
belief in the ability of technology to create
systems that, in a less optimistic time, could
seem incautious and ill-fated. In founding the
Farm, Leland Stanford envisioned a universi
ty that promoted advances in engineering and
science as a means to near-limitless human

progress. II he's representative of his era, it's
not such a big surprise that San Franciscans in
1910 supported the $45 million bond measure
to pay for the construction of their water im
portation system.
(That sentiment may not have faded. In a
2005 document, the San Francisco Public
Utilities Commission fondly reflected on the
how Hetch Hetchy's engineers were able to
"meet the challenges of hydraulic engineer
ing across more than 160 miles of wilderness"
by "mastering impassable terrain.") (look at
cutting if necessary)
But importantly, we don't live today with
Hetch Hetchy water simply because it was the
clear and reasoned choice of engineers. With
out the backing of influential politicians and
the urgent desire to increase firefighting abil
ity after the 1906 earthquake. Hetch Hetchy
may have never been built. If so, we'd live
today with water imported from somewhere
else with a differently-engineered system.
That we use Hetch Hetchy now doesn't mean
it couldn't, and maybe shouldn't, have been
another way.
The question of when reasonably cost-ef
fective engineering cannot mitigate rare dan
ger is more complex. It's dependent upon
funding levels, emotional attachments, and
the public's perception and willingness to ac
cept risk.

Does the public still trust in the power of
engineering, or have Katrina and other fail
ures made the United States more risk
averse? Are we — and should we be — less
willing to develop cities in floodplains, or re
quiring dams on fault lines? Would you buy a
house in San Francisco if you knew that, in the
event of a major earthquake, there was a 90%
chance you wouldn't have drinking water for
a month? What about a 10% chance?
Our answers to these questions should un
derlie views of how much risk society should
bear by providing funding to mitigate these
risks. Answers to these questions should also
be predicated upon an understanding of the
abilities and limits of engineering — and how
engineers consider risk in building systems
like the Hetch Hetchy, which, while normally
adequate, may at some point stick you with a
hefty two-month Aquafina bill.
The question and complexity of risk will be
addressed next week — and comparing Stan
ford's water system to San Francisco's
demonstrates that susceptibility to a given
risk may not be uniform.
And, if you can't wait a week, don't worry
— Stanford has a back-up water system in the
case of a Hetch-Hetchy failure.

If you're thirsty when the next big earth
quake hits, it's probably not advisable to
be in San Francisco — unless you'd like to
live without water for two months.
To whom may we owe this potential dehy
dration? Perhaps the politicians, of both the
early 1900 sand the early 2000s. But let us not
forget the engineers.
Potable water for more than 2.4 million
people — including those on Stanford's cam
pus— flows into the Bay Area each day,
thanks to the 160-mile long Hetch Hetchy sys
tem that brings in clean water from the Sierra
Nevada. It is this system of aqueducts, dams,
powerhouses, pumps and tunnels that has en
abled the otherwise freshwater-deprived city
