## Editorial Undergrads and grads: Go forth and mingle 
### 
Thanks to a misplaced notion of
"sketchiness," undergraduate and
graduate students rarely interact with
one another. If a graduate student happens
to mention his status at an undergraduate
party, chances are very high that he or she
will find no one to talk to or dance with for
the rest of the evening. If an undergraduate
dates a graduate student, the pair will auto
matically be deemed "sketchy."
It doesn't matter that there is less of an
age difference between a senior and a first
year master's student than between a fresh
man and a senior. Daring to leap across the
chasm separating the undergraduate and
graduate worlds is not something most Stan
ford students would do.
Yet this attitude deprives us of many in
teresting opportunities for social and intel
lectual exchange. Undergraduates could gain
tremendously from increased exposure to
graduate student research, and could also re
ceive career and education advice. In turn,
graduate students might benefit from the in
fectious enthusiasm of undergraduates and
might enjoy sharing knowledge with under
graduates.
We believe that the Stanford student com
munity could benefit from more measures to
facilitate and encourage interaction between
graduate students and undergraduates.
Tutoring and mentoring
At present, undergraduates form an
overwhelming majority of peer tutors on
campus. However, we believe that expand
ing the program to include graduate student
tutors or creating a separate graduate tutor
ing program would be beneficial to graduate
students and undergraduates alike. Tutees
would benefit from the experience of gradu
ate students, while graduate tutors can gain
valuable teaching experience.
Implementing a graduate-undergraduate
mentoring program would also prove very
useful, especially if it included students from
the Graduate School of Business, Law
School and School of Medicine. Undergrad
uates wishing to participate in the program
— preferably in their junior or senior year,
when they have a better idea of which field
they would like to enter — could select a
professional school or graduate department
and be paired with a graduate student in
their chosen field.
The purpose of this mentorship program
would be for the graduate student to provide
advice on careers, classes, summer intern
ships, professional schools and Ph.D. or mas
ter's programs. The program could also or
ganize events such as a quarterly or annual
dinner for undergraduates and their men
tors so that undergraduates could be ex
posed to a broader range of professional and
educational experiences by meeting other
graduate mentors.
Classes and research
There is already a great deal of cross-reg

istration between graduate and undergradu
ate classes, but it should be encouraged
whenever possible — especially for semi
nars, where having a diversity of perspec
tives makes classroom learning much richer.
The University already makes great efforts
to promote undergraduate research and
should continue to do so, since research in
creases interaction between graduate stu
dents and undergraduates.
Clubs, activities and events
Graduate student participation in stu
dent clubs and activities such as the ASSU,
The Daily and the Stanford Symphony Or
chestra should be encouraged. Graduate
students should feel welcome in these pur
suits, rather than have the impression that
they are intruding in undergraduate activi
ties. There are many student associations,
such as the French Stanford Student Associ
ation (FSS A) and the Coalition for Justice in
the Middle East (CJME), which have both
graduate and undergraduate members; such
groups should do more to publicize this fact.
Also, intramural sports can be used as an op
portunity for graduates and undergraduates
to meet and mix — for example, organizers
could schedule tournaments between gradu
ate students and undergraduates.
Campus events should also be organized
to encourage graduate and undergraduate
interaction. In particular, there should be
more space for fliers in locations like the
Graduate Community Center so that gradu
ate students can find out more about events
organized by undergraduates. Additionally,
all advertising should emphasize that events
are open to both undergraduate and gradu
ate students.
Housing
On-campus housing policies should be
designed to create more integration be
tween graduate students and undergradu
ates. While it might be bizarre to have grad
uate students living in freshman housing,
perhaps the University should consider hav
ing a small number of graduate students in
upperclass dorms. Also, if Row houses
weren't in such high demand and so hard to
get into, the University should also consider
encouraging graduate students to live there.
Unfortunately, this does not seem like a fea
sible option at present.
Nevertheless, the University can encour
age graduate students to be eating associates
in Row houses. There are already a number
of graduate eating associates in some co-ops,
and even a few graduate student residents.
While the proposed measures would en
courage interaction between graduate stu
dents and undergraduates, the situation will
not truly change until the notion that it is
"sketchy" for graduate students and under
graduates to mingle disappears. It is up to
each and every one of us to debunk the
myths surrounding interactions between
graduate students and undergraduates.
