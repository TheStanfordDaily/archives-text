No room for intelligent design
By all means, let us honestly discuss the
roles that science and faith should play in so
ciety, as suggested by the Editorial Board
("Intelligent debate of intelligent design",
Feb. 17). However, intelligent design has no
place in this discussion because the concept
itself is a deliberate corruption of the scien
tific process.
Intelligent design proponents would have
you think that there is a raging debate with
in the scientific community between evolu
tion and intelligent design. Don't believe
the hype. The validity of evolution comes as
close to consensus as any concept in science
ever gets, which is why the National Acade
my of Sciences, the American Association
for the Advancement of Science and every
other major scientific society in the United
States has officially endorsed the centrality
of evolution to the field of biology.
The scientific-seeming arguments for in
telligent design have been totally refuted
time and time again by the scientific com
munity. Why then, do proponents of intelli
gent design keep trotting out the same old
tired warhorses and insisting on the need to
"teach the debate"? The reason is that the
point of intelligent design is not, and has
never been, scientific debate. A memo
leaked in 2000 from a right-wing think tank
known as the Discovery Institute, one of the
leaders for intelligent design, indicated that
this concept is actually a Trojan horse exist
ing solely as a vehicle to inject a greater de
gree of extremist religious beliefs into
American society as a whole. According to
the memo, the purpose of intelligent design
is "nothing less than the overthrow of mate
rialism and its cultural legacies."
Here is an example of the misleading ar
guments made by intelligent design propo
nents. Intelligent design states that biologi

cal systems are so complicated that they
could only have been created by a supernat
ural intelligent designer. The standard ex
ample of this argument is the bacterial fla
gellum, which is a whip-like structure that
acts like an outboard motor to propel bacte
ria through their environment. The flagel
lum is composed of many intricate parts, all
of which have to work together for move
ment to occur. Just as a flagellum with half of
its parts would not function, this structure
could not have evolved from an earlier, sim
pler structure, or so the argument goes.
However, what is left out of the argument
is that biological systems very commonly de
velop for one purpose and are later adapted
for very different uses. For example, in cer
tain kinds of bacteria, components of the fla
gellum are involved in protein transfer.
Though there is debate about the details, the
scientific consensus is that the parts of the fla
gellum evolved separately to serve a variety
of purposes within bacteria, with a final evo
lutionary step assembling them together
into a single flagellum structure.
Should there be a greater role for reli
gious influences within the public square?
There is certainly plenty of room for discus
sion on this issue,and reasonable people can
disagree. But let's have an honest debate
and not attempt to muddy the water with
unscientific ideas like intelligent design.
