# "Long Live Lightfoot?" Are you serious?
## 
### 
Two weeks ago ("My name is Bad
Wound: Listen to me on this one"
Feb. 8), I wrote a column about the
use of American Indian mascots in colle
giate athletics, specifically addressing the
situation at Stanford. In the column, I ar
gued that the reaction of some students —
as seen through letters written to the editor
of The Daily — were a bit off mark. I ar
gued that placing the debate in the realm of
freedom of speech and tradition neglects to
identify the ways that it intersects with the
lived experiences of American Indian stu
dents at Stanford and elsewhere. Further
more, I praised President Hennessey and
the University Administration for evoking
the Fundamental Standard and centering
the issue as one of tolerance, respect and
dignity.
This past week, the conservative student
newspaper, The Stanford Review, pub
lished an op-ed piece by Executive Editor
Milton Solorzano, a junior, titled, "Long
Live Lightfoot!" (Feb. 17), in which he
places the debate, again, back into the
realm of tradition and legacy. In doing so, he
evokes the story of Timm "Prince Light
foot" Williams — the former mascot who
was banned from performances by the Uni
versity Administration in 1972 following a

protest by the Stanford American Indian
Organization (SAIO).
In my opinion, by mentioning Timm
Williams and the "Prince Lightfoot" story,
Solorzano pulls a fast one over our heads:
he suggests that "Prince Lightfoot" and the
current images of the "Stanford Indian" are
one in the same, when in fact they are not.
The cartoon character with feathers, braid
ed hair and a "bulbous nose" as seen recent
ly on t-shirts and through alumni efforts,
makes no mention of "Lightfoot" next to
the derogatory image. It is understood that
the mascot was the "Stanford Indian."
William's portrayal of "Lightfoot" was
merely one interpretation of the mascot; it
alone was not the mascot. Thankfully, the
administration got rid of both.
In a weak effort to push the mascot de
bate into the realm of tradition and history.

Solorzano argues that "like much of history,
the reality of our past can't fit neatly within
modern labels rubber-stamped by PC-ob
sessed university administration." First off,
by focusing on the traditions of collegiate
athletics, this line of argument neglects
American Indian traditions entirely, much
less the appropriateness of these traditions
for mascot use. Secondly, 1 don't feel that
the University Administration is being
"PC-obsessed" in its confronting the image
or evoking the Fundamental Standard. As
stated in my previous column, I believe that
the University Administration is centering
the debate into the realm of tolerance and,
very appropriately, reminding our commu
nity of the Fundamental Standard to which
we are held.
In addition, Solorzano cites a Sport Illus
trated poll in which the majority of Ameri
can Indian respondents were not offended
by the use of American Indians as mascots.
Interestingly, Solorzano neglects to men
tion that Sports Illustrated is a division of
AOL Time Warner, of which Atlanta
Braves owner Ted Turner is the founder. In
addition, the Sports Illustrated article
about the issue makes minimal reference to

Bad Wound

Homosaywhal?
the poll and does not include its
sampling size or margin or error.
Somehow, Solorzano infers,
"Thus SAlO's virulent, knee-jerk
reaction, arguably, isn't even repre
sentative of most Native Ameri
cans." To clarify, the Sports Illus
trated poll did not ask respondents
about the Stanford case specifical
ly, nor should it be interpreted to
represent the American Indian
community at Stanford.
I am hardly convinced by this

evidence that the majority of
American Indians do not object to
the use of American Indian mas
cots, much less support it. And even
if I don't have a majority to back
me, I still think the use of American
Indian mascots is disgusting, isolat
ing and racist — and I think it
should be no part of my graduate
education at Stanford.
Solorzano concludes his op-ed
article by suggesting that we "do
nothing" to resolve the debate. I le
rightfully suggests that the mascot is
not coming back, for better or for
worse, but incorrectly argues that
we should "let the memories live"
and encourages us to "remember
the positive aspect of our dated tra

ditions." For the life of me, I can't
understand what positive outcome
the mascot issue has,a problem that
is made no clearer by his op-ed arti
cle.
At this point. I have two recom
mendations. The first is that intelli
gent Stanford students stop reading
Hie Stanford Review (if they ever
did in the first place), and secondly,
that The Stanford Review stops
printing everything double-spaced.
I'm no math major, but if the publi
cation was single spaced, wouldn't
that create half as much trash?

The cartoon character with feathers, braid
ed hair and a "bulbous nose" as seen recent
ly on t-shirts and through alumni efforts,
makes no mention of "Lightfoot" next to
the derogatory image. It is understood that
the mascot was the "Stanford Indian."
William's portrayal of "Lightfoot" was
merely one interpretation of the mascot; it
alone was not the mascot. Thankfully, the
administration got rid of both.
In a weak effort to push the mascot de
bate into the realm of tradition and history.

Solorzano argues that "like much of history,
the reality of our past can't fit neatly within
modern labels rubber-stamped by PC-ob
sessed university administration." First off,
by focusing on the traditions of collegiate
athletics, this line of argument neglects
American Indian traditions entirely, much
less the appropriateness of these traditions
for mascot use. Secondly, 1 don't feel that
the University Administration is being
"PC-obsessed" in its confronting the image
or evoking the Fundamental Standard. As
stated in my previous column, I believe that
the University Administration is centering
the debate into the realm of tolerance and,
very appropriately, reminding our commu
nity of the Fundamental Standard to which
we are held.
In addition, Solorzano cites a Sport Illus
trated poll in which the majority of Ameri
can Indian respondents were not offended
by the use of American Indians as mascots.
Interestingly, Solorzano neglects to men
tion that Sports Illustrated is a division of
AOL Time Warner, of which Atlanta
Braves owner Ted Turner is the founder. In
addition, the Sports Illustrated article
about the issue makes minimal reference to

the poll and does not include its
sampling size or margin or error.
Somehow, Solorzano infers,
"Thus SAlO's virulent, knee-jerk
reaction, arguably, isn't even repre
sentative of most Native Ameri
cans." To clarify, the Sports Illus
trated poll did not ask respondents
about the Stanford case specifical
ly, nor should it be interpreted to
represent the American Indian
community at Stanford.
I am hardly convinced by this

evidence that the majority of
American Indians do not object to
the use of American Indian mas
cots, much less support it. And even
if I don't have a majority to back
me, I still think the use of American
Indian mascots is disgusting, isolat
ing and racist — and I think it
should be no part of my graduate
education at Stanford.
Solorzano concludes his op-ed
article by suggesting that we "do
nothing" to resolve the debate. I le
rightfully suggests that the mascot is
not coming back, for better or for
worse, but incorrectly argues that
we should "let the memories live"
and encourages us to "remember
the positive aspect of our dated tra

ditions." For the life of me, I can't
understand what positive outcome
the mascot issue has,a problem that
is made no clearer by his op-ed arti
cle.
At this point. I have two recom
mendations. The first is that intelli
gent Stanford students stop reading
Hie Stanford Review (if they ever
did in the first place), and secondly,
that The Stanford Review stops
printing everything double-spaced.
I'm no math major, but if the publi
cation was single spaced, wouldn't
that create half as much trash?
