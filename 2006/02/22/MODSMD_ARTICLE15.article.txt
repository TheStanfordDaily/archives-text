# Fun with photography
## 
### 
I went digital just before the beginning of
my freshman year after receiving a digi
tal camera as a birthday gift. It was shiny
and silver with a 300-page instruction book
let, but 1 was unconvinced of the merits of
this new-fangled invention over my tried
and-true film camera. However, 1 brought
the new toy with me to Stanford anyway to
document the Fabulous Freshman F.xperi
ence.
Debate has been raging in my family for
years over the true purpose of photography.
My father is one of the obsessive types who
believes he hasn't really seen a place unless
he has captured it from every angle, which
makes it seem like the picture is the ultimate
good instead of the actual experience. Our
den is filled with innumerable, neatly alpha
betized Oldeiyme slide carousels that serve
as testament to his "hobby," if we can call it
that. But as we entered the new millennium,
my father reflected the changing of the
times by making the transition to digital,
opening whole new avenues. Now he creates
slideshows on his computer. This provides
endless opportunity to edit and fiddle with
the photos ad nauseum and then to show off
his creations to adoring friends and family
wherever there's a computer available. So
you can imagine my uncertainty about own
ing a digital camera of my own.
I never really read the instruction manu
al all the way through (pfff, I'm a Stanford
student!), and I never figured out how to

work all the high-tech focus and lighting
functions. But regardless of my initial hesita
tion, it wasn't long before I discovered the
obvious value of a digital camera over it's
old-school predecessor: you can take a virtu
ally unlimited number of photos of whatev
er you want with instant gratification, and
you never have to feel guilty about wasting
film.
The criticism with which I bombarded my
father has become hypocritical with these
discoveries since my camera has also be
come an end in itself. My guiding philosophy,
however, is that the best purpose of the digi
tal camera is not to capture infinite photos of
panoramic vistas and dusty old monuments
— rather, it is the ultimate means to capture
the everyday ridiculosities of life and to
make any conventional activity all the more
absurd.
Copying 100 pages from a library book
for class? Copying various body parts is to
tally cliched; instead, make it absurd by
bringing a camera to document the entire

thrilling experience — the book, the ma
chine, the copies, etc. Funny how the librar
ians never seemed to notice or care when
we did so at the machines in front of the
loan desk in Green.
Saturday afternoon with nothing to do?
I lead to a department store at the Shopping
Center and stake out as large a dressing
room as possible. Appoint one willing
friend to be the photographer for the group,
and do your best model pout. What the staff
at the Nordstrom formalwear department
don't know won't hurt them.
Want to find something out of the ordi
nary to do on a day in San Francisco? Check
tourist-oriented Web sites for the most
ridiculous event you can find that's accessi
ble by Caltrain or other public transporta
tion. Dress up appropriately and see how
many ways you can take pictures of the
same subject or how many ways you can
pose around it. Tlilipmania at Pier 39 — a
supposedly massive tulip show that is actu
ally just a few additional planters filled with
flowers — was a blast last year and is cur
rently underway once more.
Stores like Ikea, with their inviting room
sets and low staffing, are good to try. Nostal
gic sites like playgrounds or amusement
parks (posing inappropriately on a carousel?
Check) can be fun, and Stanford has a lot of
local flora to frolic through as well.

Ridiculosity
Sometimes no one will care
what you're doing, other times
you have to be stealthy — which
can add a whole other dimen
sion of cool covert-ops feel. Of
course, if your stealth fails you
and someone like a Nordstrom
staff member confronts you, you
can always explain that it's a

Stanford class project...or some
thing.
With some creative thinking
and a willingness to embrace the
ridiculous, the possibilities for
cheap, fun, local activities are lim
itless, and a digital camera to cap
ture these lighter moments is
priceless. And although it still
drives me crazy when we have to
stop so that my father can capture
that covered bridge from just the
right angle for the umpteenth
time. I guess I can better under
stand what it means to him. The

monumental scrapbook that doc
uments my freshman year is testi
mony to the esteem in which I now
hold my camera.
So whenever you're bored and
pressed for ideas,just bring a cam
era somewhere that's typically
banal and start snapping photos.
Inspiration will come.
