## No time is no excuse 
### MICHAEL CHAITKIN 
I commend the Daily's coverage of
Stanford Dance Marathon, but
people need to hear another side of
the story. Don't get me wrong; 1 could
n't be more elated that Dance
Marathon raised over $50,(XX) for pedi
atric AIDS research. 1 struggle to ex
press my admiration for the people
who worked tirelessly since last year's
event to make this year's even more
special. Thank you to everyone who
contributed. Were everyone like you,
Dance Marathon would have reached
its fundraising goal this year.
But somebody dropped the ball. Of
the 307 registered dancers, only 122
made it to the event. Of the 185 no
shows, nearly one third hadn't turned
in their promised donations. The 50
dancers who failed to raise their
money cost Dance Marathon at least
$ K).(XX). 1 was under the impression
that the Fundamental Standard held
members of this community to their
word. Maybe 1 need a lesson in the
meaning of "personal honor." Then
again, I fulfilled my commitment to
raise $40 and spend 3 hours at Dance
Marathon as a Moraler. Actually, I
raised nearly $2(X) and helped out at
Roble Gym from 8 a.m. until midnight
on Saturday. I have midterms. 1 have a
job. I spend half of my weekends on
the road with my club team. If I could
find the time for Dance Marathon,

surely the rest of you could too.

1 can't tell you how many people
told me before or after the event that
they didn't have time to raise the
money or come dance for a few hours.
You know what? That's unadulterated
bull, and you all know it. With three
emails, I raised $150. If you have
enough time to tell me that you don't
have enough time to raise money, you
have enough time to raise money. Send
the same email to all of your relatives
and some of them will respond. Spend
20 minutes talking to the people in
your hall, and you'll have another $20
in hand.
Most importantly, don't disregard
the commitments you make. If you
raised $500 but didn't step foot in
Roble Gym, you let Dance Marathon
down. If you danced continuously for
24 hours but didn't bring in a dime,you
let Dance Marathon down. The Stan
ford community has an incredible inca
pacity to rally for a cause other than
basketball. If I had demanded $20 from
each of the 1,000 plus students entering
Maples for the Arizona game. Dance
Marathon would have met its goal.
That's right, I went to the game, but
only after giving 12 hours and $50 of
my own money to Dance Marathon.
How many of you got drunk at Terra
that night or Sigma Nu the next night,
instead? But, of course, you were too
busy to come, right?
Today, I throw down the gauntlet. I

challenge everyone here, from the
shyest freshmen to the most powerful
administrators, to embrace a new spirit
of collaborative philanthropy. I am
calling you all out â€” I call out the
dorms; 1 call out the teams; I call out the
clubs; I call out the frats; I call out the
sororities; I call out the ASSU;I call out
the faculty; I call out the administra
tion; and 1 call out the surrounding
community. A pledge from every
Greek chapter, row house, club team,
performance group and student leader
to work together can make Dance
Marathon Stanford's premier humani
tarian event.
We have exactly one year to make
up for our mistakes; one year to reeval
uate our priorities and to keep our
promises; one year to come together
and make a significant contribution to
a wonderful cause. A year from today,
we will all still be too busy. To let that
stand in the way of doing something
great is a mistake we'll have to live with
for the rest of our lives. The money
Dance Marathon raises helps provide
treatment for kids with AIDS, kids who
rarely live long enough to make mis
takes, kids who die before they find out
what it?s like to be too busy.
The "Biggest Party of the Year"
should have been a whole lot bigger.
