# Discrimination in Activities office
## 
### NNEKA CHIKE-OBI 
On Saturday, the sisters of
Sigma Theta Psi Sorority,
Inc., Stanford, hosted Un
leashed, a step show and competi
tion that featured a diverse range of
Greek organizations, followed by an
after party.The first event of its kind.
Unleashed brought ethnic commu
nities together in a show of solidari
ty and organizational pride.
Unfortunately, the success and
community building fostered by this
event was tainted by discriminatory
practices of the Office of Student
Activities and members of the Stan
ford administration. Barely a week
before the show, we organizers of
the event were approached by a
member of the administration who
expressed concern that we were ad
vertising a party that was not regis
tered. After some confusion, we con
firmed that the party had been regis
tered for some time. The next day, I
received an e-mail from a Student
Activities administrator admonish
ing the sorority for not registering
the party. Once again, we confirmed
that the party was registered.
We were asked what security
measures we had in place for a
level four (off-campus invites al
lowed) party. Our party was in fact
a level three party, and was regis
tered as such; further, we were not
serving alcohol. Based on our party
plan, the general recommendation
was that we have one sober moni
tor for every 50 guests and that we
make sure that guests do not enter
with alcohol. We were surprised
then, when we were told one week
before the party that we would be
required to purchase professional
security guards. According to Stu
dent Activities guidelines, level
three parties are not required to
have professional security.
In a meeting with an administra
tor, we were told that the office was
concerned about the party because
of its connection to the step show.
When asked why the connection was
a problem, the administrator said
that, despite the fact that the step
show was advertised only to Stan

ford students, a Greek step show is
"attractive" to certain off-campus
individuals. The administrator was
worried because a party hosted by
an ethnic sorority several weeks ear
lier had ended in a fight.That partic
ular event was a level four party and
was advertised to students at local
colleges; and the fight was initiated
by off-campus students.
TTie lack of alcohol at our party
was not considered significant
enough to ensure the safety of all
students in attendance.The adminis
trator said that certain communities
have a "problem" with fighting, and
that alcohol is not a factor in deter
mining the likelihood of a fight. We
were also told that a number of high
profile events would be taking place
on campus that same evening, leav
ing Stanford's police force stretched
thin. The administrator deter
mined that, in spite of our compli
ance with University policy, we
would still need security. Due to the
timing of the notification, however,
security would be paid for by his of
fice. Although the administrator had
highlighted the existing strain on the
police force for that evening, we
were provided with three special
events patrols (SEPs) — the stan
dard number for a level three party
with alcohol is two.
On Saturday night, a number of
administrators attended Unleashed.
While some came solely to support
the event, others were clearly there
in a supervisory nature. After all of
the guests had left the building, one
administrator stood by and watched
us clean Cubberley Auditorium. Not
only did he not approach us to offer
his assistance, he also did not explain
his presence lingering, long after the
event had ended. When we arrived
at Elliott Program Center for the
party, the same administrator and
two others were there; all three
stayed for the first hour of the party.

Special Events patrols and the DJ.
who was a former Stanford adminis
trator.
ITiis episode clearly highlights
the discriminatory nature of Student
Activities with regards to party plan

ning policies. l"he undertone is obvi
ous— step shows are attractive to
ethnic minorities and events with
large concentrations of ethnic mi
norities are high-risk.The organiza
tions that performed in the step
show included an Asian fraternity, a
Latina sorority and two African-
American fraternities. By saying
that our event was "attractive" to the
wrong crowd, the University is say
ing that members of those ethnic
groups are troublesome or prone to
violence.
The behavior of the administra
tion was also discriminatory against
women. An administrator suggested
that security would not be as much
of a problem if we had "a brother
fraternity or male friends." There is
currently no policy requiring female
student groups to hire professional
security, and this recommendation
was both sexist and in violation of
Stanford policy. The lack of trans
parency is also a major concern.
Rather than being approached by
the administrators directly in charge
of party planning regulations, a
number of middlemen served to
communicate these demands to us,
leaving us little recourse to properly
respond or discuss the matter.
The party was a complete success
— no fights, no alcohol incidents and
no unaccompanied off-campus
guests. The high level of attention
that was paid to our party was unrea
sonable and a poor use of resources
in the currently understaffed Stu
dent Activities office. We were made
to feel like criminals, despite the fact
that our organization has no history
of problems. We are concerned
about the treatment that other eth
nic student organizations may re
ceive when holding events. As stu
dents, we deserve better from the
University,especially from the office
that is directly responsible for super
vising our organizations.

the discriminatory nature of Student

American fraternities. By saying
that our event was "attractive" to the

violence.
The behavior of the administra

women. An administrator suggested
that security would not be as much
of a problem if we had "a brother
fraternity or male friends." There is
currently no policy requiring female
student groups to hire professional
security, and this recommendation
was both sexist and in violation of
Stanford policy. The lack of trans
parency is also a major concern.
Rather than being approached by
the administrators directly in charge
of party planning regulations, a
number of middlemen served to
communicate these demands to us,
leaving us little recourse to properly
respond or discuss the matter.
The party was a complete success
— no fights, no alcohol incidents and
no unaccompanied off-campus
guests. The high level of attention
that was paid to our party was unrea
sonable and a poor use of resources
in the currently understaffed Stu
dent Activities office. We were made
to feel like criminals, despite the fact
that our organization has no history
of problems. We are concerned
about the treatment that other eth
nic student organizations may re
ceive when holding events. As stu
dents, we deserve better from the
University,especially from the office
that is directly responsible for super
vising our organizations.

On Saturday, the sisters of
Sigma Theta Psi Sorority,
Inc., Stanford, hosted Un
leashed, a step show and competi
tion that featured a diverse range of
Greek organizations, followed by an
after party.The first event of its kind.
Unleashed brought ethnic commu
nities together in a show of solidari
ty and organizational pride.
Unfortunately, the success and
community building fostered by this
event was tainted by discriminatory
practices of the Office of Student
Activities and members of the Stan
ford administration. Barely a week
before the show, we organizers of
the event were approached by a
member of the administration who
expressed concern that we were ad
vertising a party that was not regis
tered. After some confusion, we con
firmed that the party had been regis
tered for some time. The next day, I
received an e-mail from a Student
Activities administrator admonish
ing the sorority for not registering
the party. Once again, we confirmed
that the party was registered.
We were asked what security
measures we had in place for a
level four (off-campus invites al
lowed) party. Our party was in fact
a level three party, and was regis
tered as such; further, we were not
serving alcohol. Based on our party
plan, the general recommendation
was that we have one sober moni
tor for every 50 guests and that we
make sure that guests do not enter
with alcohol. We were surprised
then, when we were told one week
before the party that we would be
required to purchase professional
security guards. According to Stu
dent Activities guidelines, level
three parties are not required to
have professional security.
In a meeting with an administra
tor, we were told that the office was
concerned about the party because
of its connection to the step show.
When asked why the connection was
a problem, the administrator said
that, despite the fact that the step
show was advertised only to Stan

ford students, a Greek step show is
"attractive" to certain off-campus
individuals. The administrator was
worried because a party hosted by
an ethnic sorority several weeks ear
lier had ended in a fight.That partic
ular event was a level four party and
was advertised to students at local
colleges; and the fight was initiated
by off-campus students.
TTie lack of alcohol at our party
was not considered significant
enough to ensure the safety of all
students in attendance.The adminis
trator said that certain communities
have a "problem" with fighting, and
that alcohol is not a factor in deter
mining the likelihood of a fight. We
were also told that a number of high
profile events would be taking place
on campus that same evening, leav
ing Stanford's police force stretched
thin. The administrator deter
mined that, in spite of our compli
ance with University policy, we
would still need security. Due to the
timing of the notification, however,
security would be paid for by his of
fice. Although the administrator had
