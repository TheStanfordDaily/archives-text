## A 						DREAM REALIZED PALO ALTO NATIVE PITCHES CARD TO THIRD CONSECUTIVE WIN Winning streak is the longest for Stanford this season 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
After taking a one-hitter into the sixth inning yes
terday against the Nevada Wolf Pack, it's safe to say
that sophomore hurler David Stringer has arrived.
But then again, "arrived" might not be the right
word to describe someone who attended high school
no more than a homerun away from Stanford's
Sunken Diamond.
Regardless of how you put it, the rookie right-han
der had an indisputably effective outing yesterday in
the first start of his Stanford collegiate career. Riding
the arms of Stringer and two other freshman reliev
ers, the Cardinal (7-3) rolled to their third consecutive
win as they defeated the Wolf Pack (3-6) by a 5-2 final.
After allowing a leadoff single to Nevada center
fielder Durell Williams, Stringer retired 15 straight
while holding the Wolf Pack scoreless for the first five
innings of the game. Nevada finally touched him for a
pair of runs in the sixth, but Stringer still left the game
with an impressive line — 5.1 innings pitched, one
earned run, seven strike outs and no walks.
With his solid starting effort. Stringer rewarded
the faith coach Mark Marquess placed in him.
"David has pitched well for us," Marquess said.
"He earned this start with the way he has been pitch
ing and he did a phenomenal job."
By the time Stringer gave way to fellow freshman
Austin Yount in the top of the sixth, the Cardinal had
already plated four runs.

inning when junior centerfielder Jim Rapoport

Junior Blake Holler earned the win on Monday against Texas in a 13-9 Card victory. Holler's 4.2 innings of relief are the longest of the
year for Stanford.
Taylor then plated Rapoport with another single, and
Minaker ultimately came around to score on a sacri
fice fly from freshman first baseman Brent Milleville.
The Cardinal built their lead to 4-0 with two more
runs in the second inning. Sophomore Brian Juhl
walked, and Rapoport followed with a single to cen
ter to put runners on first and second with one out.
Juhl came home following a throwing error by Neva
da second baseman David Ciarlo.and Rapoport beat
out the throw home on Taylor's second RBI single of
the afternoon to push the Cardinal lead to four.
But the highlight of the day was clearly the per
formance of Stringer, who came to the Farm after a
distinguished career right across the street at Palo
Alto High School.
"This was a dream come true for me," Stringer
said. "I was a little nervous, but it was more fun and
exciting than anything else."
Strong pitching and timely hitting have made
things very exciting for the Stanford baseball team
the last three days. After being limited to four hits by
the defending national champion Texas Longhorns
on Saturday, the Cardinal have bounced back with
three encouraging wins in a row. taking the Texas se
ries and disposing of the visiting Wolf Pack.
The Cardinal picked up one more insurance run
in the sixth inning, but it didn't matter as Yount and
freshman Jeremy Bleich shut down the Nevada bats
for the remainder of the game. Yount threw 2.2 in
nings, allowing no hits and just one walk before being
replaced by Bleich for the top of the ninth. Bleich
worked a 1-2-3 final frame to pick up his team-lead
ing fourth save.
Next weekend, the Cardinal hit the road for Fres
no State, where they will play the first of ten straight
away from home. After posting a 7-3 record in their
first ten games of the season against some of the top
teams in the nation, the road trip will be yet another
critical early season test for the Cardinal.
"This will be a good test for a young team," Mar
quess said."ln the next three weeks, we will really see
where we need to be."

After taking a one-hitter into the sixth inning yes
terday against the Nevada Wolf Pack, it's safe to say
that sophomore hurler David Stringer has arrived.
But then again, "arrived" might not be the right
word to describe someone who attended high school
no more than a homerun away from Stanford's
Sunken Diamond.
Regardless of how you put it, the rookie right-han
der had an indisputably effective outing yesterday in
the first start of his Stanford collegiate career. Riding
the arms of Stringer and two other freshman reliev
ers, the Cardinal (7-3) rolled to their third consecutive
win as they defeated the Wolf Pack (3-6) by a 5-2 final.
After allowing a leadoff single to Nevada center
fielder Durell Williams, Stringer retired 15 straight
while holding the Wolf Pack scoreless for the first five
innings of the game. Nevada finally touched him for a
pair of runs in the sixth, but Stringer still left the game
with an impressive line — 5.1 innings pitched, one
earned run, seven strike outs and no walks.
With his solid starting effort. Stringer rewarded
the faith coach Mark Marquess placed in him.
"David has pitched well for us," Marquess said.
"He earned this start with the way he has been pitch
ing and he did a phenomenal job."
By the time Stringer gave way to fellow freshman
Austin Yount in the top of the sixth, the Cardinal had
already plated four runs.
Stanford got a rally rolling in their half of the first
inning when junior centerfielder Jim Rapoport
walked and went to second on senior shortstop Chris
Minaker's single. Sophomore rightfielder Michael


ADRIAN GAITAN/The Stanford Daily
Junior Blake Holler earned the win on Monday against Texas in a 13-9 Card victory. Holler's 4.2 innings of relief are the longest of the
year for Stanford.
Taylor then plated Rapoport with another single, and
Minaker ultimately came around to score on a sacri
fice fly from freshman first baseman Brent Milleville.
The Cardinal built their lead to 4-0 with two more
runs in the second inning. Sophomore Brian Juhl
walked, and Rapoport followed with a single to cen
ter to put runners on first and second with one out.
Juhl came home following a throwing error by Neva
da second baseman David Ciarlo.and Rapoport beat
out the throw home on Taylor's second RBI single of
the afternoon to push the Cardinal lead to four.
But the highlight of the day was clearly the per
formance of Stringer, who came to the Farm after a
distinguished career right across the street at Palo
Alto High School.
"This was a dream come true for me," Stringer
said. "I was a little nervous, but it was more fun and
exciting than anything else."
Strong pitching and timely hitting have made
things very exciting for the Stanford baseball team
the last three days. After being limited to four hits by
the defending national champion Texas Longhorns
on Saturday, the Cardinal have bounced back with
three encouraging wins in a row. taking the Texas se
ries and disposing of the visiting Wolf Pack.
The Cardinal picked up one more insurance run
in the sixth inning, but it didn't matter as Yount and
freshman Jeremy Bleich shut down the Nevada bats
for the remainder of the game. Yount threw 2.2 in
nings, allowing no hits and just one walk before being
replaced by Bleich for the top of the ninth. Bleich
worked a 1-2-3 final frame to pick up his team-lead
ing fourth save.
Next weekend, the Cardinal hit the road for Fres
no State, where they will play the first of ten straight
away from home. After posting a 7-3 record in their
first ten games of the season against some of the top
teams in the nation, the road trip will be yet another
critical early season test for the Cardinal.
"This will be a good test for a young team," Mar
quess said."ln the next three weeks, we will really see
where we need to be."
