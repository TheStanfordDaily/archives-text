# WOMEN'S SWIM AND DIVE
## All eyes on Pac-10 tourney 
### ALEXIS PETERSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Fierce competition awaits No. 6 Stanford
women's swimming and diving at this week's
Pac-1() Championships. Tomorrow, the Cardi
nal swimmers hit the pool in Long Beach,
Calif., while the divers compete in Federal
Way, Wash, on Thursday.
Stanford (13-2,4-2 Pac-10) is looking to de
fend its crown after a comfortable victory in
2005, when the Cardinal finished 262 points
ahead of second-place Arizona. And with five
Pac-10 teams currently ranked in the top 10,
the event will mark a meeting of some of the
strongest teams in the nation.
"The team that will win Pac-10 is always up
in the air," senior Dana Kirk said. "This a com
petition about team depth, and not just who
has the most superstars."
Stanford has suffered losses this season at
the hands of No. 3 California (11-0, 7-0) and
No. 4 UCLA (7-3,3-3) while the Golden Bears
head into the four-day-long contest undefeat
ed. Although this is the second time in three
years that Cal has posted such a record, the
Bears have yet to win a conference champi

onship.

"We took some tough losses earlier in the
year to UCLA and Cal, but we are stronger
because of it," Kirk said. "We have the poten
tial, we have the talent and now it is just going
to be about executing."
No. 7 Arizona (9-2,5-2) and No. 10 South
ern California (4-4, 2-3) also look to be top
contenders. The Sun Devils returned 2005 Na
tional Champion Marshi Smith in the 100
back. Smith is one of seven returning Pac-10
individual champions who will look to defend
titles in nine different events.

Despite the strength of the opposition, the
Cardinal remain calm and focused on their
goals.
"Our goals are the same as they were last
year," Kirk said. "We want our swimmers to
get as many spots at NCAAs as possible."
The Cardinal have already qualified five
swimmers for NCAAs, including Kirk. Senior
Kristen Caverly, junior Lauren Costella and
sophomores Brooke Bishop and Elizabeth
Durot all swam to qualifying times during
dual-meet season.
NCAAs are not, however, the team's focus

"The team that will win
Pac-10 is always up in
the air. This is a
competition about team
depth, and not just who
has the most superstars."

at this point.
"We haven't really talked about it as a
team yet," Kirk said."We take it one thing at a
time in championship season, and Pac-lOs are
the first step."
The divers, meanwhile, will face a slightly
smaller field as six teams compete for the con
ference title.
Last year. USC's Blythe Hartley won the 1-
and 3-meter events. Trisha Tlimlinson of Ari
zona claimed victory on the platform.
Both teams are nearing top-performance
condition, aiming to peak precisely at
NCAAs.
"It's going to be interesting to see what
happens," Kirk said. "We are going to surprise
a lot of people, and that's really going to be
fun."
At the 2005 NCAA Championships, Ari
zona finished in third place, Stanford took
fifth, Cal eighth and USC 10th.
