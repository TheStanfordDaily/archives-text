## Stem cell policy changes University hosts conference to discuss Prop. 71 funds 
### KATHERINE COX STAFF WRITER 
A small cross section of California aca
demics, bio-tech executives and patient ad
vocates met on campus Feb. l()th to finalize
guidelines that will dictate the way state
funded embryonic stem cell research is con
ducted in California.
The 29 representatives sit on the Inde
pendent Citizens Oversight Committee
(ICOC), which was formed in response to
Prop. 71 â€” a ballot measure that allotted
California researchers $3 billion to investi
gate embryonic stem-cells and develop po
tential therapies.
Philip Pizzo, dean of the School of Medi
cine and professor of pediatrics, microbiolo
gy and immunology, is one of several Califor
nia medical school officials serving on the
ICOC. The ICOC governs the California In
stitute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM),
a state agency founded with the passage of
Prop. 71 to oversee the distribution of funds
to competing research organizations.

Stanford scientests research stem cell pathways, the subject of a recent conference
at the University.
ICOC officials deliberated at Stanford
over a very extensive set of policy propos
als that were presented by the committee's
Standards Working Group and the Intel
lectual Property Task Force. The primary
policies the ICOC ratified dealt with the
participating organizations' responsibili
ties toward egg donors and with the shar
ing of intellectual property among grant
recipients. The committee adopted ver
sions of the proposals that exceed national
standards for similar federal stem cell re
search grant programs.
Christopher Scott, the Executive Direc
tor of the Stanford Program on Stem Cells
in Society commented on the policy proce
dures.
"The CIRM's intellectual property
policies are very close to the federal stan
dards," he said. "But by some measure
ments they're even stronger. The strongest
dimension of the policy is in the patent
sharing concept."
According to CIRM's media contact,
Nicole Pagano, the IP task force held two
of four public meetings at Stanford in No
vember 2005, and again in January 2006.
The policy reflects, in part, public input
gathered in these forums and recommen
dations from the state legislature.
Scott enumerated several provisions in
CIRM's final IP policy which "take it one
step further than similar policies." He
pointed out that the Bayh-Dole Act of
1980 is at the heart of the policy, but that
CIRM builds off of it.
Law School Prof Henry "Hank" Greely,
chair of the Stanford Center for Biomed
ical Ethics Steering Committee, explained
that this well-established statute "allows
non-profit recipients of federal grants to
claim as their own intellectual property
created using that grant money."
Though the CIRM policy honors this
practice, the ICOC also elected to make
certain intellectual property communal
among the constituent research entities.
Scott characterized the shared property as

"tools discovered by one university that
would allow others to get a leg up. Because
these tools or materials will be shared
freely, it means everyone will be on the
same playing field."
Greely said he saw "new lines of stem
cells, new techniques for manipulating
stem cells, etc.," as "examples of things that
would have to be shared under the CIRM
policy."
According to Scott, another provision
embedded in CIRM's new IP policy, en
sures that "taxpayer's money will not just
go to waste." A grant recipient must nego
tiate an agreement that is satisfactory to
CIRM with the potential licensee or com
pany that seeks to commercialize the
patented invention.The IP policy, which is
available to the public on the CIRM Web
site, states that grant recipients and li
censees must submit an agreement that in
cludes, "plans to bring the invention to
practical application." The policy also re
quires that plans must specify "commercial
development milestones and benchmarks
so that development can be assessed and
monitored."
In addition, the "march-in" rights that
CIRM retains by way of is new policy allow
it to redirect licenses of CIRM-iunded
patented inventions to "responsible appli
cants."
"If the government thinks they have
funded an inefficient research institution,
or maybe a biotech company that holds a
license and isn't aggressive enough in com
mercializing a therapy, then the govern
ment can take back ownership of that in
vention," Scott said.
Scott praised further protections of
Califomian taxpayers, the ultimate con
sumers of grant-funded therapies in the IP
policy.
"CIRM will require companies that de
velop therapies to set the lowest possible
rate for Californians.' This rate will corre
spond to the baseline federal Medicaid dis
count which is 40 percent.

The hoard also solidified donor rela
tions guidelines.The rules proposed by the
Standards Working Group, and revised
and ratified by the ICOC, exhibit an un
precedented measure of sensitivity and
ethical precaution toward the egg donor.
First, CI RM plans to compensate individu
als who experience complications result
ing from the egg-harvesting procedure
with the consequent medical costs.
"This is an invasive procedure," Scott
explained. "It requires a mild anesthetic,
there is risk of infection and risk of organ
damage. In light of these things, I think it is
reasonable to expect CIRM to cover the
expenses incurred or caused by these rare
side effects and to require that the women
who are among this small minority will be
taken care of."
Those who met Friday also outlined the
circumstances under which participating
clinics can accept egg donations.The ICOC
fleshed out existing state and federal vol
untary-informed consent guidelines by
prohibiting research institutions to pro
vide donors with any sort of payment in re
turn for their eggs and by requiring re
searchers to inform women of several
health risks. The researchers were also re
quired to make sure donors are aware both
of the policy against patients receiving roy
alties from discoveries made as a result of
their donation and the possibility that the
donor's egg(s) may be used for purposes
other than the preferred uses she may have
specified.
At the end of this checklist, grant recip
ients must also provide potential donors
time to seriously consider their decision.
Scott found this clause extremely ap
propriate given the ethical quandary one
might face on the brink of such an action.
"There have been many articles written
about the anxious moments waiting to do
something like this," Scott said. "Some
people ponder this kind of decision with
great gravity."
He also expressed concern about a defi

ciency in the CIRM policy and in the pro
tocol for most clinics accepting and per
forming donation procedures.
"Are we going to guarantee parents
that they will have access to experts," Scott
asked. "Whether they be psychological
counselors, physicians, etc. to bounce ideas
off at this critical time?" He lamented the
state's lack of resources for this kind of
service.
Yet, for Scott, the most regrettable as
pect of the State's new stem cell research
program is the delay in the distribution of
funds.
"The greatest tragedy is that Prop. 71 is
a year behind schedule because of lawsuits.
Until these suits have been resolved no
funding is imminent."
The lawsuits that have caused the state
to withhold Prop. 71 funds from re
searchers will all be tried together Feb. 27
at the California Superior Court in Alame
da County. The suits challenge the legality
of an autonomous organization like
CIRM, which is responsible for spending
state money. Further challenges include
more technical claims about the constitu
tionality of the terms under which Prop. 71
was passed, and its relation to state and
federal tax laws.
"Only the first claim seems very mean
ingful and I believe that it will be rejected
handily," Greely said. "The lawsuits have
delayed funding for CIRM by 15 months
so far, so I suppose that's a victory for their
supporters."
He also argued that the format of the
ICOC, which has drawn criticism in Sacra
mento, is suited to the kind of policy it was
charged with making.
"The point was to have something that
had some independence from politics, like
the UC Board of Regents," Greely said.
"Making academics, mainly medical
school deans, one part of the oversight
committee for academic research seems
reasonable to me. They understand med
ical research."
