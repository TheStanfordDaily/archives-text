## Stem cell policy changes University hosts conference to discuss Prop. 71 funds 
### KATHERINE COX STAFF WRITER 
A small cross section of California aca
demics, bio-tech executives and patient ad
vocates met on campus Feb. l()th to finalize
guidelines that will dictate the way state
funded embryonic stem cell research is con
ducted in California.
The 29 representatives sit on the Inde
pendent Citizens Oversight Committee
(ICOC), which was formed in response to
Prop. 71 â€” a ballot measure that allotted
California researchers $3 billion to investi
gate embryonic stem-cells and develop po
tential therapies.
Philip Pizzo, dean of the School of Medi
cine and professor of pediatrics, microbiolo
gy and immunology, is one of several Califor
nia medical school officials serving on the
ICOC. The ICOC governs the California In
stitute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM),
a state agency founded with the passage of
Prop. 71 to oversee the distribution of funds
to competing research organizations.
