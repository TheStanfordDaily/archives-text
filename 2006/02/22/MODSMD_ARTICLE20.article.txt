# We live in an ESPN world

I love sports . 1 love every aspect
of every game. I love playing
sports. 1 love watching sports. I
love talking about, arguing about
and shouting about sports. I love
the competition and the rivalries.
Sad as it may be, my life revolves
around sports.
Naturally, living this lifestyle
has led me to ESPN more times
that 1 can begin to quantify. I
watch Sports Center at least once
a day. ESPN.com is my homepage.
I listen to ESPN Radio. I get
sports scores sent to me on my cell
phone from the Worldwide
Leader. This nonstop barrage of
ESPN content in all forms of
media has led to two conclusions.
Firstly, that ESPN is the greatest
thing ever to happen to sports.
And secondly, ESPN is destroying
sports culture in America.
There is no doubt that the con
stant access to sports information
is a fan's dream. I am never more
than a channel flip or mouse click
away from any recap, box score or
trivial sports tidbit that I could
ever want.
But at the same time, ESPN is
taking all of the original and cre
ative discourse out of sports. The
stories sports fans talk about are
the stories that ESPN talks about.
Sports debate in America has be
come a regurgitation of what the
pundits at ESPN believe.
Part of what makes sports great
is the debate and rivalries between
fans and players. Magic-Bird, Nin
ers-Cowboys, Ali-Frazier — those
were real rivalries that sparked na
tional debates. Today we have to
listen to ESPN's talking heads de
bate the rivalry between Adam
Morrison and J.J. Redick — two
players who are in different con
ferences, on different coasts and
who in all likelihood will never
face each other.
Sadly and predictably, this dis
cussion has entered the national
conversation. I have found myself
making the case for Morrison on
countless occasions, only to realize
that this is a controversy created
by ESPN in an effort to generate
ratings for its coverage of the ACC
and WCC.
Even this might be acceptable if
it were not for the fact that in these
discussions of contrived rivalries
and debates, the arguers simply
spit up what they heard Stephen A.
Smith, Jay Bilas or whoever else is
talking on ESPN. Simply tune in to
KNBR, the local sports radio sta
tion, and you will hear hours of
ESPN's leftovers from hosts and
callers. If 1 wanted Michael Irvin's
opinion, I could just turn on the TV
— no need to repeat it ten times an
hour on local radio.
Last year, ESPN put Pedro
Gomez on the Barry Bonds Beat.
Twenty-four hours a day.the whole
world knew the exact activities of a
man who played 14 games last sea
son and had 45 at bats for a non
