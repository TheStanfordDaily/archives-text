# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Road trip all misses Men fall to No. 2 and No. 7 teams in games in southern California 
### JOE KAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford wrapped up a two
game road trip Friday with a 3-0
loss to UC-Irvine, but their Thurs
day game against UCLA at leg
endary Pauley Pavilion was a much
harder loss to accept.
The Cardinal dropped to 4-12
overall and 2-8 in the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation. With
their wins against Stanford, No. 2
UC-Irvine improved to 11-3, 6-2,
and No. 7 UCLA jumped to 8-6,3-
4.
On Thursday night, the Cardi
nal lost to UCLA, last year's na
tional runner-up, with game scores
of 28-30, 30-21, 21-30 and 28-30.

However, unlike in years past, the
Bruins are not having an exempla
ry season, losing to teams they
would have beaten handily in prior
eras.
UCLA leads the country in na
tional championships with 18, the
first coming in the inaugural sea
son of collegiate men's volleyball
in 1970. Nonetheless, A 1 Scates, the
UCLA coach since the team's in
ception in 1970, and his team
looked on Thursday as if they were
on their heels for the first three
games against Stanford.
"We played really well the
whole night," said senior Nick
Manov. the Cardinal's starting out
side hitter. "We did exactly what
we were supposed to do — we got
touches on their hits, we were tran
sitioning pretty well, we were serv
ing tough enough to make it so

they had to set a bunch of high halls."
Stanford head coach Don Shaw
concurred with Manov.
"I thought we could have and
should have won." Shaw said. "In the
first game, we were playing well and,
by chance, had a critical call go
against us. Game two we won pretty
easily. Game four was even, but we
gave UCLA five out of their last
eight points on serving errors."
Opposite hitter senior Ben Reddy
turned red hot in the second game
and finished with a match-high 27 at
tacks while hitting with a .500 aver
age.
Middle blocker senior Chris
Ahlfeldt also had a strong match
with 11 kills and 7 total blocks. Out
side hitter senior William Clayton
and middle blocker sophomore Matt
Ceran had 12 kills apiece, and setter
senior Jeremy Jacobs had 59 assists
on the night.
The Bruins had a more balanced
attack. Red-shirt senior Damien
Scott and red-shirt junior Paul
George, both outside hitters, had 17
kills. Freshmen Matt Wade and red
shirt senior Dennis Gonzalez com
bined for a total of 58 set assists.
Following their match against the
Bruins, the Cardinal traveled down
the coast to face Irvine on Friday
night. The Anteaters took control of
the game from the very beginning,
winning by a final score of 30-17,30-
17,30-24.
The first game was tied at 13 all,
until the Anteaters blew the game
wide open with their serving control.
They had nine aces on 88 serve at
tempts, compared to Stanford's three
aces on 60 attempts.
Shaw decided to sub in some of
his more inexperienced players in
the second and third games, hoping
that their fresh hands would at least
hold the Cardinal close. Some of the
team's most experienced players —
Ahlfeldt, Jacobs and libero junior
Brian Lindberg — were having off

nights.
In the end, Reddy was the only
player to hit in double figures with 14
kills, but a total of 13 Cardinal saw ac
tion in the match. Jacobs and fresh
man Miki Groppi shared setting
duty, with a combined 25 set assists.
On the other side of the net, out
side hitter junior Jayson Jablonsky
finished with a match high 17 kills for
Irvine, while junior Brian Thornton
had 42 assists to lead the Anteaters.
"I was thinking this before [Shaw]
actually said it, but he read my mind in
the post-game speech," Manov said.
"He said that [Irvine] is playing like
we should be playing, and that they
don't have a bunch of tall guys or a
bunch of guys that were huge recruits.

[He also said that] they're just a bunch
of guys that have been playing togeth
er for several years, and that they play
hard, and they play together."
"They cover their hitters and they
take smart swings," Manov contin
ued. "They take care of the ball. That
is the type of team we could be.That's
the type of thing we're striving for."
This weekend the Cardinal stay at
home to face No. 13 Southern Cali
fornia on Friday at Maples Pavilion
and No. 3 Pepperdine the following
night at Burnham.
USC is led by outside sophomore
Juan Figueroa, who hails from Puer
to Rico, and setter sophomore
Jimmy Killian. Figueroa averages
4.53 kills per game, while Killian has

a 12.93 assists per game average on
the season.
Four of Pepperdine's players have
over 110 kills this season already.
Their leaders are Paul Carroll, a
freshmen outside hitter from Aus
tralia, and John Parfitt, a junior out
side hitter. Their setter is 6-foot-8
sophomore Jon Winder.
Despite the size of the Pepper
dine lineup, the Cardinal are confi
dent that they will be able to pull out
a win on Saturday night. Although
the Wave won the national champi
onship last year, they graduated Sean
Rooney, their leader in many differ
ent areas.
"They lost the guy that can just
bail them out," Manov said.
