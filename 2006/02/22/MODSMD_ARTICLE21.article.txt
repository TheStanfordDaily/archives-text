# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Road trip all misses Men fall to No. 2 and No. 7 teams in games in southern California 
### JOE KAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford wrapped up a two
game road trip Friday with a 3-0
loss to UC-Irvine, but their Thurs
day game against UCLA at leg
endary Pauley Pavilion was a much
harder loss to accept.
The Cardinal dropped to 4-12
overall and 2-8 in the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation. With
their wins against Stanford, No. 2
UC-Irvine improved to 11-3, 6-2,
and No. 7 UCLA jumped to 8-6,3-
4.
On Thursday night, the Cardi
nal lost to UCLA, last year's na
tional runner-up, with game scores
of 28-30, 30-21, 21-30 and 28-30.

However, unlike in years past, the
Bruins are not having an exempla
ry season, losing to teams they
would have beaten handily in prior
eras.
UCLA leads the country in na
tional championships with 18, the
first coming in the inaugural sea
son of collegiate men's volleyball
in 1970. Nonetheless, A 1 Scates, the
UCLA coach since the team's in
ception in 1970, and his team
looked on Thursday as if they were
on their heels for the first three
games against Stanford.
"We played really well the
whole night," said senior Nick
Manov. the Cardinal's starting out
side hitter. "We did exactly what
we were supposed to do â€” we got
touches on their hits, we were tran
sitioning pretty well, we were serv
ing tough enough to make it so
