# A 						PERFECT TEN

No. 12 women's gymnastics will remem
ber their Friday night home meet against No.
14 Arizona for awhile.
The Cardinal were simply amazing, bet
tering every one of their season highs, scoring
over 49 in every event and displaying no
weakness in any area of competition. They
convincingly defeated the Wildcats by a
score of 196.85 to 194.625.
"The energy in the gym was phenome
nal," coach Kristen Smyth said. "It just lifted
the athletes up to a new level."
On bars, an eruption of cheers accompa
nied sophomore Liz Tricase\s mere salute to
the judges prior to her routine. A sky-high
tkatchev-tkatchev sequence highlighted Tri
case's act of gymnastic perfection.
And after a split-second hush as Tricase
stuck her landing, ovation and rallies came
down for a perfect 10.0 score.
With her flawless routine,Tricase won the
event and now holds a No. 2 ranking in the
nation.
"We all strive to be as perfect as we can
because that's the nature of the sport," Iric
ase said. "My team set it up for me. I was so
happy I was able to pull through."
Sophomore Tabitha Yim came in second

with a career-best 9.95, and the Wildcats'
Aubrey Taylor was third. Senior Natalie Foley
performed a beautiful shushunova, and senior
Glyn Sweets stuck a smooth double front dis
mount, as Stanford hit all six of its bars rou
tines.
The meet started off, literally, with control
and strong momentum — down the vault run
way. But unlike Arizona, Stanford managed to

"We all strive to be as perfect as we can because
that's the nature of the sport."

stick its landings. Tricase (with a 9.90 career
best) and Sweets finished first and second.
Yim, combating sickness, won both the
all-around and beam with career-bests. The
Stanford team avoided the many wobbles
that spoiled Arizona's beam score.
The Cardinal ended its spectacular night
on floor, where Arizona's gymnasts had pre
viously been inattentive to technique. With
a heavy two-point lead, Stanford performed
head-turning routines, featuring a full-in by
Foley, a stuck front layout by Yim and the

powerful grace of IVicase. Freshman Nicole
Ourada (with a 9.925 career-best) and Yini
were the events top two.
On a night when only near-perfection
would rival the Cardinal, the Wildcats were
simply unable to compete.
"We were not very good tonight," Ari
zona coach Bill Ryden said. "Stanford was
outstanding."

When asked to outline the highlights of
his team's showing, Ryden shook his head.
"I'm not sure there was one," he said.
"We expect a little bit of home scoring
everywhere we go," said Arizona's Taylor,
who seemed to shrug off the impact of the loss.
But Stanford's Foley had different opin
ions.
"It was definitely amazing — just more
energy that we could feed off." said Foley
about the Burnham atmosphere. "It's just
more fun being at home."

The Cardinal will now aim for a fourth
straight win this Friday when they host Wash
ington.
Washington's Ashley Hough ting is a
prime vault performer and Kelly McDonald
is strong in bars and beam. But neither
Houghting, McDonald, nor solid all-around
performers Kristen Omori and Chelsea
Bakken have been able to rescue the
Huskies.
While Stanford was competing at Burn
ham on Friday, the Huskies were competing
at Oregon State University. And as one meet
announcer declared Stanford's 196.85 — a
season high — another announced Washing
ton's 189.875 — their season low. So as Stan
ford soars in smoothly from a high this Fri
day, Washington will cruise coolly in from a
low.
Smyth expressed confidence in her team's
ability to maintain and improve the quality
of their performance.
"I expect that they're that good," she said
in reference to the Cardinal's showing last
Friday. "They did what they do everyday in
practice."
And who stands to discredit her? Certain
ly not Arizona.
"We've seen some of the best teams in the
country, and Stanford certainly matches up
with all of them," Arizona's Ryden said.
