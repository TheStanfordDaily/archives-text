## Seven is the magic number Eight-women team program won by seven Card swimmers

Wheaton College came within two points
of handing a depleted Cardinal squad its first
loss of the season, but the top-ranked Stan
ford synchronized swimming team squeaked
past a field of five at the Wheaton Invitation
al in Norton. Mass on Saturday. The close win
was Stanford's seventh victory this year.
"It was a tough weekend at Wheaton,"
said coach Heather Olson, whose team had
enjoyed wide margins of victory all season.
"We were very excited to win the meet."
Junior Samantha Bongiovanni-Duclos
fell ill shortly after winning the trio event

with junior Eliz
abeth-Anne
Markman and
sophomore
Courtenay Stew
art. Her absence
forced the Cardi
nal to withdraw a
duet from com
petition, and put
Stanford's eight
woman team
program in seri
ous jeopardy.
The fast pace
of the meet did
not allow time
for Stanford al
ternate Katie
Norris to warm
up.
"We were
forced to swim
our routine with
seven athletes
and forego doing
many of our
lifts," Olson said.

"My team
can
handle
anything
that is
thrown at
them"

"Being short one
event and swimming a routine without lifts
could have devastated us if a team like Ohio
State or Alabama-Birmingham was compet
ing."
The seven-woman team, effectively swim
ming with one arm tied, still managed a spir
ited performance and won the event with
88.4 points to Wheaton's 76.4.The Cardinal's
previous performance in the team event, a
season-best at the Stanford Invitational on
Feb. 11, earned a 95.5.
Wins from Sara Lowe (88.8) in the solo
competition and Lowe and Stewart (86.5) in
the duet completed the Stanford sweep.
Stewart led a Cardinal sweep of the top eight
places in the elements competition, but
Wheaton's depth kept the final tally close.
The scare of the thin margin of victory
proved to be a valuable trial for the
Stanford swimmers, who have yet to
face close competition this season.
"By not being able to swim, I put
my whole team and my duet part
ner in a tough position," Bongio
vanni-Duclos said. "However, in
the face of this obstacle, my team
stayed confident and composed.
Even though I felt really awful that
I was not swimming, 1 was really
proud of how everyone else han

died the situation. My team can
handle pretty much anything that is
thrown at them."
"This meet was an incredible
learning experience for our team,"
Olson said. "It was exciting to see our
team pull together, focus and swim
with enthusiasm. Our alternate will
be ready for anything after this expe
rience and our team will be ready to
perform and compete no matter what
happens."
Iliis weekend the Cardinal finish
their regular season with a dual meet
at Arizona on Saturday and the
Western Regionals, also in TUcson,
on Sunday.
"Arizona is our last competition

before Collegiate Nationals," Olson
said. "It is a great place for us since
it is closer to home and outdoors
like Collegiate Nationals. We have
the opportunity to compete two
days in a row there, preparing the
team for long sequential days of
competition like Collegiate Nation
als will be."
"In this sport, you need to be pre
pared for anything," Stewart said.
"We will keep this in mind as we pre
pare for Arizona. Arizona is our last
opportunity to show our stuff before
Collegiates, so we need to make a
great last impression. We want every
one to be talking about Stanford as
we approach Nationals."
