## Seven is the magic number Eight-women team program won by seven Card swimmers

Wheaton College came within two points
of handing a depleted Cardinal squad its first
loss of the season, but the top-ranked Stan
ford synchronized swimming team squeaked
past a field of five at the Wheaton Invitation
al in Norton. Mass on Saturday. The close win
was Stanford's seventh victory this year.
"It was a tough weekend at Wheaton,"
said coach Heather Olson, whose team had
enjoyed wide margins of victory all season.
"We were very excited to win the meet."

art. Her absence
forced the Cardi
nal to withdraw a
duet from com
petition, and put
Stanford's eight
woman team
program in seri
ous jeopardy.
The fast pace
of the meet did
not allow time
for Stanford al
ternate Katie
Norris to warm
up.
"We were
forced to swim
our routine with
seven athletes
and forego doing
many of our
lifts," Olson said.

"My team
can
handle
anything
that is
thrown at
them"

"Being short one
event and swimming a routine without lifts
could have devastated us if a team like Ohio
State or Alabama-Birmingham was compet
ing."
The seven-woman team, effectively swim
ming with one arm tied, still managed a spir
ited performance and won the event with
88.4 points to Wheaton's 76.4.The Cardinal's
previous performance in the team event, a
season-best at the Stanford Invitational on
Feb. 11, earned a 95.5.
Wins from Sara Lowe (88.8) in the solo
competition and Lowe and Stewart (86.5) in
the duet completed the Stanford sweep.
Stewart led a Cardinal sweep of the top eight
places in the elements competition, but
Wheaton's depth kept the final tally close.
