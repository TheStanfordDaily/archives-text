# MEN'S SWIM AND DIVE
## 'Big Meet' a splashing success 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
The showdown between the Stanford and California
men's swimming and diving teams Saturday was hyped
and labeled as the "Big Meet" — and for good reason.
The No. 5 Cardinal were facing off against not only a bit
ter rival, but also the top-ranked team in the nation.
It was the rematch the Stanford men had been looking
forward to ever since they were stunned in defeat by the
Bears just over a year ago. Heading into Saturday's meet,
the Stanford men knew they were in for a challenge —

and with their authoritative 136-107 victory, they showed
that they were up to the challenge as well.
In a way, the Cardinal's upset of Cal on Saturday bore
a striking resemblance to the last meeting between the
two teams at the end of last year's season. In that meet, it
had been the Cardinal who entered as the top team in the
nation but left enduring the sting of a devastating defeat.
With that memory in mind, every member of the Stanford
squad resolved to push just a little bit harder to bring the
"Big Meet" title back to the Farm.

"It would be a lie to say that we didn't approach this
meet differently than all the others," sophomore Danny
Beal said. "I don't know if there was a guy on the team

that didn't feel a
little extra mo-

tivation when
he walked

out on the
deck and

saw the
C a 1

logo on the opposite side of the pool. We lost to Cal for the
first time in 14 years last year, and no one wanted a repeat
of that. 1 still remember walking out of the Cal pool in the
i pouring rain last year after we lost, and 1 think that mem
-1 ory inspired me to go a little faster."
Beal's victory in the 200 meter free gave the Cardinal
their third consecutive event win to open the meet. With
the outcome of the competition still far from decided, his
; victory combined with junior Andy Grant's second place
finish provided the Stanford squad with another strong
burst of momentum.
But it was the first event of the afternoon — the 400
I medley relay — that set the tone for the Cardinal's amaz
ing upset.
Head coach Skip Kenney elected to keep junior Ben
Wildman-Tobriner off the relay team in hopes of keeping
the sprinter fresh for his short distance swims later in the
day.'llie move effectively amounted to a concession of the
event to Cal's powerful medley lineup. But Stanford's
four swimmers — junior Hongzhe Sun, freshman Paul
Kornfeld, freshman Jason Dunford and junior Matt
Crowe — produced one of the Cardinal's most surprising
and inspiring efforts of the season.
"We knew that in all likelihood Cal would win the first
relay and that we would save Ben for his better events,"
Beal said. "But the four guys on our stepped up and beat
Cat's "A" relay, which sent our sideline into near-pande
monium."
Junior Shaun Phillips proceeded to outpace Daniel
Lysaught. Cal's star distance swimmer, in the l(XX) free to
claim Stanford's second event win. Phillips set a school
and pool record by finishing with a time of 8:50:93 —
nearly five seconds ahead of Lysaught.
The Cardinal never let up the pressure, allowing the
Bears to win only four of the meet's 13 events. Wildman-
Tobriner edged out his competition in the 50 and 100
free events, while Phillips went on to post another
school record in the 500 free with a 4:19:26.
Other Stanford highlights in-

eluded Sun taking first in the 200
back, senior Tobi Oriwol winning
the 200 IM and sophomore Nathan
Kim claiming the top finish in the
three-meter diving event.

But as happy as the Cardi
nal were with the results of
their final regular season
meet, they know that much
work still remains with Pac
10s in Federal Way, Wash., and
and NCAAs in Atlanta, Geor
gia soon to come.

"Timing is critical in swim
ming," Phillips said. "The clos
er a team gets to the high point
of their season the faster they
swim. The Cal meet was the
final prep opportunity for [our
postseason] meets, and our
performances show a preview
of even stronger things to
come. Our goals are the same
every year — to win Pac-10
and to win NCAA. Cal was the
No. 1 ranked team in the coun
try, so handling them the way
we did shows we are ready to
make good on both goals."
Wilder-Tobriner echoed a
similar sentiment, emphasizing
that he and his teammates are
looking forward to bigger and
better accomplishments.
"This was only the begin
ning," he said. "We'll have to
use Saturday's meet [versus
Cal] as a stepping stone to
wards Pac-lOs. As usual, Cal
will be very fast next week,
but so will we. I'm eager to get
to Washington to see what
happens."

Beal said. "I don't know if there was a guy on the team

that didn't feel a
little extra mo-

tivation when
he walked

out on the
deck and

saw the
C a 1

logo on the opposite side of the pool. We lost to Cal for the
first time in 14 years last year, and no one wanted a repeat
of that. 1 still remember walking out of the Cal pool in the
i pouring rain last year after we lost, and 1 think that mem
-1 ory inspired me to go a little faster."
Beal's victory in the 200 meter free gave the Cardinal
their third consecutive event win to open the meet. With
the outcome of the competition still far from decided, his
; victory combined with junior Andy Grant's second place
finish provided the Stanford squad with another strong
burst of momentum.
But it was the first event of the afternoon — the 400
I medley relay — that set the tone for the Cardinal's amaz
ing upset.
Head coach Skip Kenney elected to keep junior Ben
Wildman-Tobriner off the relay team in hopes of keeping
the sprinter fresh for his short distance swims later in the
day.'llie move effectively amounted to a concession of the
event to Cal's powerful medley lineup. But Stanford's
four swimmers — junior Hongzhe Sun, freshman Paul
Kornfeld, freshman Jason Dunford and junior Matt
Crowe — produced one of the Cardinal's most surprising
and inspiring efforts of the season.
"We knew that in all likelihood Cal would win the first
relay and that we would save Ben for his better events,"
Beal said. "But the four guys on our stepped up and beat
Cat's "A" relay, which sent our sideline into near-pande
monium."
Junior Shaun Phillips proceeded to outpace Daniel
Lysaught. Cal's star distance swimmer, in the l(XX) free to
claim Stanford's second event win. Phillips set a school
and pool record by finishing with a time of 8:50:93 —
nearly five seconds ahead of Lysaught.
The Cardinal never let up the pressure, allowing the
Bears to win only four of the meet's 13 events. Wildman-
Tobriner edged out his competition in the 50 and 100
free events, while Phillips went on to post another
school record in the 500 free with a 4:19:26.
Other Stanford highlights in-

eluded Sun taking first in the 200
back, senior Tobi Oriwol winning
the 200 IM and sophomore Nathan
Kim claiming the top finish in the
three-meter diving event.

But as happy as the Cardi
nal were with the results of
their final regular season
meet, they know that much
work still remains with Pac
10s in Federal Way, Wash., and
and NCAAs in Atlanta, Geor
gia soon to come.

"Timing is critical in swim
ming," Phillips said. "The clos
er a team gets to the high point
of their season the faster they
swim. The Cal meet was the
final prep opportunity for [our
postseason] meets, and our
performances show a preview
of even stronger things to
come. Our goals are the same
every year — to win Pac-10
and to win NCAA. Cal was the
No. 1 ranked team in the coun
try, so handling them the way
we did shows we are ready to
make good on both goals."
Wilder-Tobriner echoed a
similar sentiment, emphasizing
that he and his teammates are
looking forward to bigger and
better accomplishments.
"This was only the begin
ning," he said. "We'll have to
use Saturday's meet [versus
Cal] as a stepping stone to
wards Pac-lOs. As usual, Cal
will be very fast next week,
but so will we. I'm eager to get
to Washington to see what
happens."
