# CAMPUS EVENTS
## Students may see Snoop Dogg this spring 
### CLAY BAVINGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Concert Network
(SCN) is planning a big spring concert for
late May. Although the group host a con
cert every spring, this year SCN members
promise to deliver a great show held at a
huge venue and featuring a big-name
artist.
"It will probably be a hip-hop show,"
said Megan Green, an event manager for
SCN. She added that the concert may
even feature such a high-profile artist as
Snoop Dogg.
According to Green, the spring con
certs put on over the last few years have
tended to be small.
"This year's show is going to be huge,"

Green said." Students should be really
excited."
Niran Babalola, a junior, said he re
niemberes the last two spring concerts as
"decent afternoons on Wilbur field with
o.k. music, but nothing really fantastic."
A number of people said that they had
heard relatively little about the concert in
previous years.
"I've already heard a lot more about
this year's concert than I did about the
previous ones," said Introduction to the
Humanities Teaching Fellow Kara
Cooney.
Several students said they were
thrilled to hear that such big names are
coming this year.
"I can't wait to find out which artist is
chosen," said freshman Alex Laube.

In an effort to reflect a more demo
cratic choice, SCN polled a number of
students a few weeks ago regarding
which artist they would prefer to see on
campus.
Students chose among such acts as OAR,
Snoop Dogg, Mos Def and Dashboard
Confessional. The vote revealed that
OAR, whom SCN had originally liked for
the gig, was actually very unpopular with
students.
However, Green said that students'
vote will not necessarily decide which
artist is chosen.
"There is a lot of groundwork still to
do, especially in terms of money and
availability," she said.
According to Green, SCN has a fairly
substantial budget. However, the group

wants to choose an artist that is popular
with students but also affordable.
"The popular artists are pretty expen
sive," she said. "Many of them ask for
more than we can afford."
In previous years, the spring concert
was held on Wilbur field. In an effort to
make this year's concert more exciting,
SCN is trying to rent a larger location like
Maples Pavilion.
While few details have been finalized
for the spring concert, SCN is also busy
organizing several small concerts to be
held throughout the year. It is also pro
moting student productions. Beginning
next quarter, SCN will organize a per
formance by a student singer or group
every Thursday night at the Coffee
House.
