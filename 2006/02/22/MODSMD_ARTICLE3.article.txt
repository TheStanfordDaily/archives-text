## Stanford conserves water, keeps clean 
### ANDREW BURMON STAFF WRITER 
If you've ever wondered where the
water you bathe in comes from you
might be surprised to discover that your
warm shower comes all the way from the
Hetch Hetchy reservoir in Yosemite. The
reservoir was created by the construc
tion of the O'Shaugnessy dam in 1923,
despite John Muir's protests that

damming the Hetch Hetchy Valley
would be akin to damming "the people's
cathedrals and churches, for no holier
temple has ever been consecrated by the
heart of man."
Stanford's water used to make the mi
gration north from Yosemite to the Uni
versity's campus â€” where it was fluori
dated before flowing through the maze
of pipes connecting all the dorms, halls
and laboratories. The practice stopped

recently, as the San Francisco Public-
Utilities Commission began fluoridating
water for all of its 2.4 million Bay Area
consumers.
"The water is receiving system-wide
fluoridation now at optimal levels, so
there is no need for each water agency to
add fluoride," said Marty Laporte. La
