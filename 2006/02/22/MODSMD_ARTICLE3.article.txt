## Stanford conserves water, keeps clean 
### ANDREW BURMON STAFF WRITER 
If you've ever wondered where the
water you bathe in comes from you
might be surprised to discover that your
warm shower comes all the way from the
Hetch Hetchy reservoir in Yosemite. The
reservoir was created by the construc
tion of the O'Shaugnessy dam in 1923,
despite John Muir's protests that

damming the Hetch Hetchy Valley
would be akin to damming "the people's
cathedrals and churches, for no holier
temple has ever been consecrated by the
heart of man."
Stanford's water used to make the mi
gration north from Yosemite to the Uni
versity's campus — where it was fluori
dated before flowing through the maze
of pipes connecting all the dorms, halls
and laboratories. The practice stopped

recently, as the San Francisco Public-
Utilities Commission began fluoridating
water for all of its 2.4 million Bay Area
consumers.
"The water is receiving system-wide
fluoridation now at optimal levels, so
there is no need for each water agency to
add fluoride," said Marty Laporte. La
porte co-authored Stanford's 2003
potable uses, such as decorative
fountains," Laporte said.
In the meantime, the University's
expansion is making the importance
of water conservation more appar
ent. While the University constructs
new graduate student housing, stu
dents are actively cultivating con
sciousness for this increasingly
pressing issue.
Students for a Sustainable Stan
ford (SSS), formed in the spring of
20(H) by a group of environmentally
conscious students, are currently co
sponsoring— along with Student
Housing — their second "Great An
nual Stanford Energy Bowl and
Water Derby," an idea inspired by
similar competitions at other schools
such as Oberlin College in Ohio.
The competition, in which houses
and dorms compete to curb their
water consumption, has been a real
success.
"Last year [dorms] definitely im
proved during the water derby com
petition," said SSS Coordinator
Emma Yuen, a junior.
But the problem remains grave.
While Yuen said she was confident
that "most students appreciate the
environment and recognize that we
face serious environmental prob
lems," she is still concerned that stu

dents "don't realize that they are
constantly affecting the environ
ment by their actions."
"Saving water is one of the easiest
and most direct ways to help the en
vironment — and can be done by
taking shorter showers or by making
sure they only do full laundry loads,"
Yuen said.
Meanwhile, the University's
water consumption will be high this
week as the facilities department
"flushes" the water pipes by allow
ing fire hydrants and other outlets to
run in order to loosen accumulated
sentiment.
As this water runs down the
streets and into gutters, Yuen and the
SSS will be announcing the prelimi
nary statistics for how each house is
doing in the Water Derby.
With students continuing their ef
forts to conserve water, Laporte
pointed out that there are always
ways to help.
"We can still do more to prevent
water waste in daily activities, to im
prove inefficient irrigation systems
and to prevent water wasting
pranks," she said.

Until the University comes up
with means of recycling its waste
water or appoints a sustainability co
ordinator as SSS has recommended,
the burden of conservation will con
tinue to fall on students — and the
jury is still out as to whether or not
they will prove to be up to the task.
