"Water Conservation, Reuse and
Recycling Master Plan," which was
devised to keep Stanford's daily con
sumption of water under three mil
lion gallons a day.
As of now, the University's daily
water consumption is approximately
2.7 million gallons. Twenty-seven
percent of the water is used in hous
ing and dining settings, while 22 per
cent is used in staff housing. The rest
goes to academic departments, the
School of Medicine, campus projects
and the Central Energy Facilities
Cooling towers that generate about
63,000 gallons of waste water per day
— enough to alarm those who wish
to curb the University's water con
sumption.
With respect to the problem of
growing consumption, Laporte said
her office is exploring possible reme
dies.
"With appropriate treatment and
if regulatory agencies would permit
such non-potable water re-use. the
water could be used for irrigation,
toilet flushing or possibly other non

potable uses, such as decorative
fountains," Laporte said.
In the meantime, the University's
expansion is making the importance
of water conservation more appar
ent. While the University constructs
new graduate student housing, stu
dents are actively cultivating con
sciousness for this increasingly
pressing issue.
Students for a Sustainable Stan
ford (SSS), formed in the spring of
2CKK) by a group of environmentally
conscious students, are currently co
sponsoring— along with Student
Housing — their second "Great An
nual Stanford Energy Bowl and
Water Derby," an idea inspired by
similar competitions at other schools
such as Oberlin College in Ohio.
The competition, in which houses
and dorms compete to curb their
water consumption, has been a real
success.
"Last year [dorms] definitely im
proved during the water derby com
petition," said SSS Coordinator
Emma Yuen, a junior.
But the problem remains grave.
While Yuen said she was confident
that "most students appreciate the
environment and recognize that we
face serious environmental prob
lems," she is still concerned that stu

dents "don't realize that they are
constantly affecting the environ
ment by their actions."
"Saving water is one of the easiest
and most direct ways to help the en
vironment — and can be done by
taking shorter showers or by making
sure they only do full laundry loads,"
Yuen said.
Meanwhile, the University's
water consumption will be high this
week as the facilities department
"flushes" the water pipes by allow
ing fire hydrants and other outlets to
run in order to loosen accumulated
sentiment.
As this water runs down the
streets and into gutters, Yuen and the
SSS will be announcing the prelimi
nary statistics for how each house is
doing in the Water Derby.
With students continuing their ef
forts to conserve water, Laporte
pointed out that there are always
ways to help.
"We can still do more to prevent
water waste in daily activities, to im
prove inefficient irrigation systems
and to prevent water wasting
pranks," she said.

Until the University conies up
with means of recycling its waste
water or appoints a sustainability co
ordinator as SSS has recommended,
the burden of conservation will con
tinue to fall on students — and the
jury is still out as to whether or not
they will prove to be up to the task.
