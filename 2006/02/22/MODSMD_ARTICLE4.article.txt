# OVERSEAS PROGRAMS
## Record number of students apply for fall study abroad Oxford, Santiago programs most popular among students 
### STEPHANIE FAGLIANO STAFF WRITER 
Students should take a good look at their
friends on campus because many of them
won't be here in September. A record
breaking 384 students applied to study
abroad next fall through Stanford's Bing
Overseas Studies Program (BOSP), repre
senting a substantial increase in applications
from tow years ago, when 339 students ap
plied to study abroad in the fall.
Fall 2004 represents a more accurate
comparison than fall 2005, as the Australia
program was not offered last quarter.
Although there has been increased stu
dent interest in studying abroad during win
ter and spring quarters as well, fall is gener
ally the most popular quarter for Stanford
students to go abroad. The majority of stu
dents who apply are sophomores hoping to
go abroad during the fall quarter of their
junior year.
Many students anticipate studying
abroad to be a highlight of their undergrad
uate careers.
"For me, studying overseas is an impor
tant part of my college experience" said
sophomore Nana Wilberforce. "I want to
study specifically in Santiago because I
think it's a unique opportunity to study in
South America as opposed to Europe, and I

have always been interested in learning
Spanish."
The BOSP found Oxford and Santiago to
be the two most popular programs. Accord
ing to Shannon Marimon, BOSP outreach
and student relations manager, many stu
dents are attracted both to Oxford's reputa
tion and unique teaching system, while stu
dents seek out Santiago because it is the only
Spanish language program offered for Stan
ford students.
"In Oxford, there's no language require
ment," Marimon said. "Although Moscow
and Berlin don't have one either, students
aren't as aware of that. Oxford is an attrac
tive institution to be affiliated with. It has a
reputable name, and Stanford students are
drawn to the challenge that Oxford will offer
them. There's also the unique aspect of the
tutorial system where they get to study in the
traditional British system working with a
tutor one-on-one in a specialized area."
The tutorial system at Oxford was the
major factor in sophomore Sagari Bette's
decision to apply to go to Oxford next fall.
"I think it would be really cool to study at
Oxford because of the strength of its aca
demic programs and the tutorial system."
she said. "With a tutorial 1 can basically de
sign my own class, which is a great opportu
nity to focus on a subject in-depth."
However, classes alone don't comprise
the entire overseas experience. Students
often consider programs based on the cul
tural experience they will provide.

"I also think Oxford has a great university life and
community," Bette said. "It's a university town, which is
pretty different from Stanford's relatively insular cam
pus, and no one can call Palo Alto a university town. 1
want to have fun, and Oxford has a large student popu
lation with lots of student organizations and clubs, so I
know that I'll never get bored. What more could 1 want?
1 love the country, am excited about the program and
want to make friends with English students."
With Spanish being the second-most widely spoken
language on the Stanford campus, it is no surprise that
Santiago is the other most popular program.
"Santiago is our only Spanish speaking program at
the moment, and Latin America is also an exciting and
developing place to go," Marimon said
Unfortunately, not every student who applies to
study abroad is accepted. What makes a good applicant
varies, according to BOSP.
"Our office has a new director and is discussing that
right now" Marimon said."These increases in applicants
have brought up a lot of reflection on our part because
we want to make sure that we're being really fair with
students and upfront and open about the application
process.
"Currently, it's based on the qualitative aspect of the
personal statement â€” how well they articulate their de
sire to go, their goals and academic plan and any ex
tracurricular or internship opportunities they're looking
to take advantage of," she continued. "This shows that
they've done their homework and know what the pro
gram is all about."
The BOSP is looking to modify its selection criteria,
currently debating whether or not a student's academic
record and class year will be a factor in admitting stu
dents to the program.
"We'll be revisiting our guidelines for the next review
process to make sure that they're in line with our overall
mission statement," Marimon said. "As of right now we
don't use as much qualitative criteria. Besides the per
sonal statement, the only other information we have is
the transcript, and we try not to measure that as a form of
criteria. It's not our place to weigh grade point averages
against each other, especially when dealing with students
of different academic backgrounds. However, it is up for
discussion whether the transcript will become a factor
and whether seniority will play a role in the future."
Although the programs are competitive, the Univer
sity will most likely not take on an expansion in its more
popular programs to accommodate more students.
"We have a fixed staff at each location," Marimon
said. "To ensure the quality, we want a high faculty-to
student ratio. That could be sacrificed a bit if we had too
large a group of students going over. We also have to find
quality housing for that number of students, and coordi
nate student field trips. So it's important to keep the
number of students at a reasonable size."
With high student interest, competition is inevitable.
"Stanford makes the process so convenient and avail
able that many people want to make BOSP part of their
Stanford experience," said Wilberforce. "At the same
time, I think we have an advantage in studying abroad
because it is a program created for students at Stanford."
Stanford students seem to be aware of the BOSP's
advantage more than ever before.
"We've beefed up our outreach program and have
gone to great efforts to get the word out there via our stu
dent advisor program." Marimon said. "Our training pro
gram and selection process for those advisors has also
been improved over the past two years. We're also trying
to improve the appeals of our publications to students."
While increased BOSP publicity plays a large factor
in the recent rise in popularity for studying abroad, more
students are also seeking to increase their international
awareness.
"There's a general sense across campus that there's a
growing need to get abroad and see what's happening on
an international level," Marimon said. "It's so important
in this day and age for the most educated students in the
country to be as educated on international relations as
possible, and the best way to understand those issues is
to be in that foreign setting. Stanford is making interna
tional initiatives more of a focus and a priority."
For those students who are considering going abroad
next fall, late applications will be accepted for all pro
grams except Oxford and Santiago until March 5.
