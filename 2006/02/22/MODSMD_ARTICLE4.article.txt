# OVERSEAS PROGRAMS
## Record number of students apply for fall study abroad Oxford, Santiago programs most popular among students 
### STEPHANIE FAGLIANO STAFF WRITER 
Students should take a good look at their
friends on campus because many of them
won't be here in September. A record
breaking 384 students applied to study
abroad next fall through Stanford's Bing
Overseas Studies Program (BOSP), repre
senting a substantial increase in applications
from tow years ago, when 339 students ap
plied to study abroad in the fall.
Fall 2004 represents a more accurate
comparison than fall 2005, as the Australia
program was not offered last quarter.
Although there has been increased stu
dent interest in studying abroad during win
ter and spring quarters as well, fall is gener
ally the most popular quarter for Stanford
students to go abroad. The majority of stu
dents who apply are sophomores hoping to
go abroad during the fall quarter of their
junior year.
Many students anticipate studying
abroad to be a highlight of their undergrad
uate careers.
"For me, studying overseas is an impor
tant part of my college experience" said
sophomore Nana Wilberforce. "I want to
study specifically in Santiago because I
think it's a unique opportunity to study in
South America as opposed to Europe, and I

have always been interested in learning
Spanish."
The BOSP found Oxford and Santiago to
be the two most popular programs. Accord
ing to Shannon Marimon, BOSP outreach
and student relations manager, many stu
dents are attracted both to Oxford's reputa
tion and unique teaching system, while stu
dents seek out Santiago because it is the only
Spanish language program offered for Stan
ford students.
"In Oxford, there's no language require
ment," Marimon said. "Although Moscow
and Berlin don't have one either, students
aren't as aware of that. Oxford is an attrac
tive institution to be affiliated with. It has a
reputable name, and Stanford students are
drawn to the challenge that Oxford will offer
them. There's also the unique aspect of the
tutorial system where they get to study in the
traditional British system working with a
tutor one-on-one in a specialized area."
The tutorial system at Oxford was the
major factor in sophomore Sagari Bette's
decision to apply to go to Oxford next fall.
"I think it would be really cool to study at
Oxford because of the strength of its aca
demic programs and the tutorial system."
she said. "With a tutorial 1 can basically de
sign my own class, which is a great opportu
nity to focus on a subject in-depth."
However, classes alone don't comprise
the entire overseas experience. Students
often consider programs based on the cul
tural experience they will provide.
