## Pombo under fire Stanford pays for House staffer trip, congressman faces controversy 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
Rep. Richard Pombo (R-Calif.), chairman of
the House Resources Committee, has recently
come under fire for excessive spending on travel
that included a trip to Stanford, according to a re
cent article in'lTie Sacramento Bee. With Washing
ton currently embroiled in the Jack Abramoff lob
bying scandal. Pombo's critics have been quick to
point out that the cost of these trips was funded by
both taxpayers and sympathetic businesses.
"If elected. I can promise the taxpayers I will
pay for any trips I take to the national parks," Pete
McC'loskey. a former GOP congressman and
Pombo's Republican primary challenger, told The
Bee.
Such travel contributed to the more than
$213,000 spent since 2(X)3 by private groups host
ing Resource Committee staff trips, according to
The Bee. Many of the groups contributing money
have business interests before the committee,
which deals with environmental affairs. Groups
mentioned include the American Gas Associa
tion. BP the Florida Sugar Cane League and Stan
ford.
The University reimbursed Rob Gordon, a Re
sources Committee staffer, approximately $1,000
in lodging, food and travel expenses for a confer
ence he attended at Stanford from Feb. 25-27,
2005.
Buzz Thompson,the faculty sponsor of the con
ference, head of the Law School's environmental
program Director of the Stanford Institute for the
Environment, said the conference focused on the
Endangered Species Act.
"[The conference] was a workshop on ways in
which we could improve the ESA." Thompson
said. "Can we get state and local government offi
cials better involved? There were about 35 people
there, including academics,state and local govern
ment officials, representatives of the federal gov

eminent and environmental organizations.
"The purpose of the workshop," he continued,
"was to sit down and see if you come up with some
new approaches that work more effectively than
old approaches and are politically feasible."
According to Thompson, the event sponsors
reimbursed some of the attendees.
"In this case, we picked up expenses of those
people who needed reimbursement," Thompson
said. "And if there were people who could reim
burse their own travel expenses, that would be
great because it would save us money on the con
ference."
Two other staffers from the Resources Com
mittee went to conferences held by universities.
One staffer went to the University of Virginia
School of Law for a public service conference and
was reimbursed $200. Another received $170 for
attending an event at Duke's School of Environ
ment and Earth Sciences.
Brian Kennedy, who works for the Resources
Committee's press office, said the trip to Stanford
was hardly unique to House staffers.
"It was a university conference on the Endan
gered Species Act and its implementation,"
Kennedy said. "There were a wide variety of pub
lic policy figures present."
ITie Resources Committee spent more than
$13().(MH) in federal funds on travel. This sum in
cluded $S,(KH) for a 10-day Recreational Vehicle
tour of the national parks for Pombo and his fam
ily. According to The Bee, only one of 21 House
committees has spent more on travel last year
than Pombo's Resources Committee.
Several Democratic congressmen have asked
the House Administration Committee to investi
gate Pombo's expenditures. The Democratic Con
gressional Campaign Committee released a two
minute ad attacking the committee chairman, in
cluding a reference to the RV trip.
Pombo, however,continues to support his com
mittee's travel.
"When I became chairman, one of the things I
committed to doing was we would take the com
mittee outside of Washington,"he told the Bee. "I
pioneered the use of field hearings."
