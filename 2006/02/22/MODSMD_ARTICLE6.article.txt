## ASSU finalizes special-fees program Undergraduate Senate confirms 2006 Elections Commission 
### MICHAEL TAMKIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Undergraduate Senate convened last night to
confirm an election commission for the upcoming spring
quarter elections, to debate changes to the Student Judi
cial Charter and to approve special-fees bills for student
groups wishing to appear on the upcoming special fees
ballot. The Senate also confirmed changes to the struc
ture of Flicks and passed funding bills for various stu
dent groups.
The Senate opened with a comment from Publica
tions Director Brendan Marten concerning his commit
tee's progress on the publication distribution policy.
"We had a broad meeting with all publications to dis
cuss the door-to-door policy." Marten, who is also Chief
Operating Officer of The Daily, said. "The Review out
lined their concerns for distribution policy and together
with other publications we wrote up a letter to discuss
the need to meet with Dean Boardman. We're also still
working on dining hall and golf cart initiatives."
The Senate then confirmed the members of the 2(M)6
Elections Commission, who. following last week's ap
proval by the Graduate Student Council, will assume
their positions immediately. The Senate approved Chris
Hartfield as assistant commissioner in charge of op
erations, Stanford Student Enterprises (SSE) Capi
tal Group Funding Manager Chris Elmore as assis
tant commissioner in charge of special fees and
Jackelyn Hwang as assistant commissioner in
charge of media.
Next, ASSU Vice President Aneto Okonkwo
provided the Senate with an update from the ASSU
Executive Branch.
"We're looking forward to Wednesday night's
State of the Association address, which will be a
good opportunity to recap our progress on our
goals stated earlier in the quarter and our goals for
the rest of the quarter," Okonkwo said. "We've
also made good progress recently on finding hous
ing for international students over winter break,
and we'll be having meetings about this program
very soon."
In a joint legislative action previously approved
by the Graduate Student Council, the Senate passed
a bill re-establishing Flicks as an ASSU Joint Ser
vice Project rather than a division of SSE.
According to sophomore Danny Arbeiter,
deputy chair of the Senate, this move will help the
internal financial operations of Flicks, but will have
no detrimental effect on students.
"This is basically an administrative move that
will not impact the consumer," Arbeiter said. "The
SSE board of directors decided Flicks could func
tion better on its own. Now that Flicks will not be
run by the ASSU business division, it will become
slightly more autonomous from the ASSU"
The Senate then engaged in a vigorous debate
concerning amendments to the student Judicial
Charter of 1997 proposed by the Board on Judicial
Affairs.
One such amendment was to insert a clause into
the Judicial Charter banning the practice of charg
ing students in "separate proceedings" with both a
Fundamental Standard violation and violation of a
specific Student Conduct Policy for the same action
Although the proposed wording would
protect students from being charged for the same
offense in two separate hearings, some senators ex
pressed reservations about the actual wording of
the clause. The bill was tabled pending an addition
al amendment disallowing the compounding of
sanctions.
Chair of the Communications Committee Rong
Xu stated that "separate proceedings would de
crease the rights of the accused. Right now, as writ
ten, students can't be charged with violations of the
Fundamental Standard and other policies in the
same trial.
"Although it was not the intent, this wording
would open up the technicality of charging a stu
dent with both in the same proceeding, so we'll be
conferring with the Judicial Board to change the
wording appropriately," he said.
The Senate also split on various word changes to
the student Judicial Charter, rejecting a bill that
would replace "guilt" with the word "responsibility"
but accepting other changes by a series of close mar
gins.
Some senators expressed concerns that certain
wordings would reduce the rights of the accused,
and Xu explained his stance against certain changes.
" If a student has committed a serious crime then
changing the wording to 'responsible' from 'guilty'
doesn't reflect the gravity of the situation," he said.
In preparation for the upcoming elections, the
Senate approved various special-fees bills for stu
dent groups, and listened as group treasurers ap
pealed for modifications to their proposed budgets.
According to the elections commissioner in
charge of special fees, Chris Elmore, the special-fees
process applies to groups with budgets of over
$8,000. This year approximately 50 groups will seek
funding through this process.
Although approval by the Senate can facilitate
receiving special fee funding, Elmore explained that
groups may go through a petition process for vari
ous reasons.
"Groups will petition if they are new, if their
budget is increasing by more than 10 percent, if they
are not approved by the Undergraduate Senate or if
they want more money than the Senate recom
mends," Elmore said. "The number of students they
need to petition, though, varies with the circum
stances."
At this meeting, Stanford Jazz Orchestra, Stan
ford Axe Committee, Six Degrees, Stanford Mock
Trial, Black Student Union (BSU), Stanford in Gov
ernment (SIG), Stanford Chapparal, Jewish Stu
dents Association, Stanford African Student Asso
ciation, Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan,
Stanford American Indian Organization and Asian
American Student Association (A AS A) were all
approved for the special fee ballot.
Finally, the Senate approved general funding
bills for SAM-Islamic Society at Stanford, Viennese
Ball Committee, Lambda Theta Nu sorority, Teen
Technology Hitoring, Cante Gitano-Flamenco Car
denal. Army ROTC of Stanford University, Stan
ford Israel Alliance and Stanford Undergraduate
Psychology Association.
The Senate also approved reserve transfers for
SIG, Stanford Chaparral, BSU, Stanford Axe Com
mittee and AASA.
