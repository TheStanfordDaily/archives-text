## Bush brushes off port pact critics President threatens to veto any bill blocking agreement with U.A.E. 
### TED BRIDIS ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Brushing aside objections
from Republicans and Democrats alike, President Bush
endorsed the takeover of shipping operations at six
major U.S. seaports by a state-owned business in the
United Arab Emirates. He pledged to veto any bill Con
gress might approve to block the agreement.
The president on TUesday defended his administra
tion's earlier approval of the sale of London-based
Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co. to Dubai
Ports World, despite concerns in Congress it could in
crease the possibility of terrorism at American ports.
The sale — expected to be finalized in early March —
would put Dubai Ports in charge of major shipping oper
ations in New York, New Jersey, Baltimore, New Orleans,
Miami and Philadelphia. "If there was any chance that
this transaction would jeopardize the security of the
United States, it would not go forward," Bush said.
"It sends a terrible signal to friends around the world
that it's OK for a company from one country to manage
the port, but not a country that plays by the rules and has
got a good track record from another part of the world,"
Bush said.
To assuage concerns, the administration disclosed
some assurances it had negotiated with Dubai Ports. It
required mandatory participation in U.S. security pro
grams to stop smuggling and detect illegal shipments of
nuclear materials; roughly 33 other port companies par
ticipate in these voluntarily. The Coast Guard also said
TUesday it was nearly finished inspecting Dubai Ports' fa
cilities in the United States.
A senior Homeland Security official, Stewart Baker,
said this was the first-ever sale involving U.S. port opera
tions to a state-owned company. "In that sense this is a
new layer of controls," he said. Baker added that U.S. in
telligence agencies were consulted "very early on to ac
tually look at vulnerabilities and threats."
Bush sought to quiet a political storm that has united
Republican governors and Senate Majority Leader Bill
Frist of Tennessee with liberal Democrats, including New
York's two senators, Hillary Rodham Clinton and

Charles Schumer.
Frist said TUesday, before Bush's comments, that he
would introduce legislation to put the sale on hold if the
White House did not delay the takeover. He said the deal
raised "serious questions regarding the safety and secu
rity of our homeland.
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-111., asked the
president for a moratorium on the sale until it could be
studied further. "We must not allow the possibility of
compromising our national security due to lack of re
view or oversight by the federal government," Hastert
said.
Maryland's Republican Gov. Robert Ehrlich, during a
tour of Baltimore's port on Tuesday, called the deal an
"overly secretive process at the federal level."
Bush took the rare step of calling reporters to his con
ference room on Air Force One after returning from a
speech in Colorado. He also stopped to talk before tele
vision cameras after he returned to the White House.
"I can understand why some in Congress have raised
questions about whether or not our country will be less
secure as a result of this transaction," the president said.

"But they need to know that our government has looked
at this issue and looked at it carefully."
A senior executive from Dubai Ports World pledged
the company would agree to whatever security precau
tions the US. government demanded to salvage the deal.
Chief operating officer Edward "Ted" H. Bilkey prom
ised Dubai Ports "will fully cooperate in putting into
place whatever is necessary to protect the terminals."
Bilkey traveled to Washington in an effort to defuse
the growing controversy.
Bush said that protesting lawmakers should under
stand his approval of the deal was final.
"They ought to listen to what I have to say about this,"
the president said. "They'll look at the facts and under
stand the consequences of what they're going to do. But
if they pass a law, I'll deal with it with a veto."
Bush, who has never vetoed a bill as president, said on
the White House South Lawn, "This is a company that
has played by the rules, has been cooperative with the
United States, from a country that's an ally on the war on
terror, and it would send a terrible signal to friends and
allies not to let this transaction go through."
