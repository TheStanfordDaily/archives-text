MOSCOW (AP) - Talks aimed at resolving an inter
national standoff over Iran's nuclear program ended
TUesday with no sign of progress, but Tehran's top ne
gotiator labeled the two-day meeting "positive and
constructive."
Some Russians voiced concern that Iran was using a
proposed Kremlin compromise to stall for time and
avert international sanctions.
The proposal, backed by the United States and the
European Union, calls for uranium for Iran's nuclear
energy program to be enriched in Russia, to stifle con
cern that enrichment conducted in Iran could produce
material for atomic weapons.
Enriched uranium can be used as fuel for a nuclear
reactor or fissile material for a bomb. Iran says it is pur
suing peaceful nuclear energy but Western nations fear
it is seeking an atomic weapon.
The negotiations ended without any visible progress,
but Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov declined
to label them a failure.
"I would be cautious about using the term 'failure' or
'setback' as long as the negotiations have not finished,"
he said in televised remarks. The talks are to resume
later in the week in Iran.
"In our belief, the trend of negotiations was positive
and constructive," Iran's chief negotiator, Ali Hosseini
tash told state-run Iranian television as he left Moscow
after two days of meetings.
"There are elements in these negotiations that give
us grounds for hope that we will reach an agreement,"
Russia's Interfax news agency quoted Hosseinitash,the
deputy secretary of the Supreme National Security
Council, as saying.
U.S. Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns said
TUesday on a visit to Moscow that "from what we know
... no new ground was broken," but added that he
thought broad cooperation among countries in pressur
ing Iran was working well.
"I think the momentum is with this coalition," Burns
told reporters.
Russia's atomic chief, Sergei Kiriyenko, who is set to
visit Iran Thursday for further talks, said that, "Russia
will do everything possible to offer Iran an opportunity
to get out of this difficult situation in a peaceful, con
structive way."
