for the remainder of her term. She also provided
advice for future student leaders on how best to
run the organization.

students and student groups," Kannokada said. "Be

culture on campus but allow students to try new
things, we came into the office to decide how to help
groups reach their goals and deal with issues such as
funding, space, visibility and access to research."

Sports obtain funding, to establish the Stanford
Saver program and the new Cardinal-To-Go pro

best through collaboration," she said. "And after 150
groups met, we launched the Volunteer Student Or
