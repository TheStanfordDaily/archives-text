# STUDENT GOVERNMENT
## ASSU looks to successes, future goals Annual address highlights cooperation between student groups, new initiatives 
### MICHAEL TAMKIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
ASSU President Melanie Kannokada, a senior,
expressed her goal for the ASSU to be an organiza
tion that embodies "efficacy, strong communication
and advocacy" during her State of the ASSU Ad
dress last night. She addressed a joint session of the
Undergraduate Senate and the Graduate Student
Council (GSC).
During her speech, attended by students, facul
ty and staff. Kannokada outlined the ASSU's re
cent accomplishments and presented its objectives
for the remainder of her term. She also provided
advice for future student leaders on how best to
run the organization.
"In addition to funding, advocating and repre
senting, we wanted to expand this year to represent
students and student groups," Kannokada said. "Be
cause student groups not only provide much of the
culture on campus but allow students to try new
things, we came into the office to decide how to help
groups reach their goals and deal with issues such as
funding, space, visibility and access to research."
She described the ASSU's efforts to help Club
Sports obtain funding, to establish the Stanford
Saver program and the new Cardinal-To-Go pro
gram that provides catering for student groups, as
well as initiatives to resolve space issues as major ac
complishments.
"We also decided that many groups could work
best through collaboration," she said. "And after 150
groups met, we launched the Volunteer Student Or
ganization Initiative to encourage groups to work
together for common goals and solve common prob
lems such as funding."
In addition to the progress made for student
groups, Kannokada listed achievements in a variety
of other areas, including divestment from companies
that operate in Darfur. a publicity campaign for ad
vising programs and an evaluation of the use of tech
nology on campus. She also pointed out that a record
number of students had applied for student-initiated
courses.
Kannokada then turned her attention to the cam
pus social scene, highlighting events during Big
Game week, an upcoming Spring Break party to be

coordinated with Greek Life and the
return of the Halloween Mausoleum
party next year.
Improvements made in graduate
student life also factored highly in the
speech.
"The Graduate Community Center
(GCC) opened in 2004 and it now fea
tures a pub, ftxxl service and space that
students can reserve,"she said."We now
want an operating fund for the GCC
building to ensure proper maintenance
cind regukir programming."
Kannokada also touched on grad
uate student night at Flicks, the
Thanksgiving dinner and the first
ever graduate student winter formal
as major efforts to improve the social
aspects of graduate student life.
Emphasizing the importance of
diversity at the graduate level. Kan
nokada said the University "has done
a great job on diversity at the under
graduate level; now it's time to work
on it at the graduate level."
She continued, "We need to in
crease the levels of women and mi
norities at the graduate level, and mi
nority recruitment and retention
should be tracked and used to hold
departments accountable."
At the end of her speech, she men
tioned some internal improvements
being made to help the ASSU run
more smoothly, addressed the major
issue of funding and turned her focus
toward the future of student govern
ment at Stanford.
"We updated our Web site, which
now includes an executive blog and

also an online tracking of projects so
students can see what we're working
on," she said. "We're also launching a
more user-friendly site in the spring
for student groups."
After explaining that the ASSU
will try to help student groups more
readily find sources of funding, Kan
nokada expressed her desire for the
ASSU to be a proactive organization.
"Until students can answer the
question, 'What does the ASSU do
for you?' we shouldn't be satisfied,"
she said.
In her closing remarks, Kannoka
da stressed that many of the projects
taken up by the ASSU have come
from student suggestions.
"An active student populace is the
only thing that lies between an effec
tive student government and ineffec
tual representation." she said.
Senator Andrew Hendel,a senior,
said he thought Kannokada's speech
was an accurate reflection of the
ASSU's current status.
"I think the speech encapsulates
the body of work we've been doing,"
he said. "This is arguably one of the
most successful Senates ever as we
kept Late Nite open over the week
end, pushed to keep Green Library
open later, balanced the budget and
laid the foundation for progress on
many other initiatives in the years to
come."
Before Kannokada's speech, the
Senate and the GSC voted to elimi
nate the lists of endorsements on the
ballot in the spring elections, which
primarily impacted candidates run
ning for the Undergraduate Senate
and the ASSU presidency.
ITie Senate and GSC also passed a
bill slating this year's elections for
April 12 and 13.

complishments.
"We also decided that many groups could work
best through collaboration," she said. "And after 150
groups met, we launched the Volunteer Student Or
ganization Initiative to encourage groups to work
together for common goals and solve common prob
lems such as funding."
In addition to the progress made for student
groups, Kannokada listed achievements in a variety
of other areas, including divestment from companies
that operate in Darfur. a publicity campaign for ad
vising programs and an evaluation of the use of tech
nology on campus. She also pointed out that a record
number of students had applied for student-initiated
courses.

coordinated with Greek Life and the
return of the Halloween Mausoleum
party next year.
Improvements made in graduate
student life also factored highly in the
speech.
"The Graduate Community Center
(GCC) opened in 2004 and it now fea
tures a pub, ftxxl service and space that
students can reserve,"she said."We now
want an operating fund for the GCC
building to ensure proper maintenance
cind regukir programming."
Kannokada also touched on grad
uate student night at Flicks, the
Thanksgiving dinner and the first
ever graduate student winter formal
as major efforts to improve the social
aspects of graduate student life.
Emphasizing the importance of
diversity at the graduate level. Kan
nokada said the University "has done
a great job on diversity at the under
graduate level; now it's time to work
on it at the graduate level."
She continued, "We need to in
crease the levels of women and mi
norities at the graduate level, and mi
nority recruitment and retention
should be tracked and used to hold
departments accountable."
At the end of her speech, she men
tioned some internal improvements
being made to help the ASSU run
more smoothly, addressed the major
issue of funding and turned her focus
toward the future of student govern
ment at Stanford.
"We updated our Web site, which
now includes an executive blog and

also an online tracking of projects so
students can see what we're working
on," she said. "We're also launching a
more user-friendly site in the spring
for student groups."
After explaining that the ASSU
will try to help student groups more
readily find sources of funding, Kan
nokada expressed her desire for the
ASSU to be a proactive organization.
"Until students can answer the
question, 'What does the ASSU do
for you?' we shouldn't be satisfied,"
she said.
In her closing remarks, Kannoka
da stressed that many of the projects
taken up by the ASSU have come
from student suggestions.
"An active student populace is the
only thing that lies between an effec
tive student government and ineffec
tual representation." she said.
Senator Andrew Hendel,a senior,
said he thought Kannokada's speech
was an accurate reflection of the
ASSU's current status.
"I think the speech encapsulates
the body of work we've been doing,"
he said. "This is arguably one of the
most successful Senates ever as we
kept Late Nite open over the week
end, pushed to keep Green Library
open later, balanced the budget and
laid the foundation for progress on
many other initiatives in the years to
come."
Before Kannokada's speech, the
Senate and the GSC voted to elimi
nate the lists of endorsements on the
ballot in the spring elections, which
primarily impacted candidates run
ning for the Undergraduate Senate
and the ASSU presidency.
ITie Senate and GSC also passed a
bill slating this year's elections for
April 12 and 13.
