## Number of Teach For America applicants on the rise at Stanford Program seeks to eliminate educational inequality 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
Thanks to strong campus recruiting ef
forts, Teach For America has witnessed a
boost in applications from Stanford seniors
this year.
With the goal to eliminate educational
inequity across the country. Teach For
America consists of a national corps of col
lege graduates who commit to teaching in
underprivileged public schools for two
years.

According to the organization's Web
site, over 14,(XX) individuals from all back
grounds and career interests have joined
Teach For America in the last 15 years.
As the Bay Area recruitment director
for the organization, Jennifer Hoang said
she spends much of her time encouraging
students to consider the program as an al
ternative post-graduation opportunity.
At Stanford, Hoang is assisted by three
student campaign managers, including sen
ior Leticia Rodriguez, who has also been ac
cepted to the 2006 corps of teachers.
"We're pretty much responsible for all
marketing on-campus and getting the
word out about Teach For America," Ro
driguez said.

Both Hoang and Rodriguez attributed
the increase in applications this year to
heightened recruiting efforts.
"We've come up with new ideas about
ways to recruit people and we're having
more focused information sessions," Ro
driguez said. "We've really made a con
scious effort this year to come up with as
much as we can for flyers and to get peo
ple informed about what Teach For
America is."
Last year, according to Hoang, 82 Stan
ford students applied, 27 were accepted,
and 17 decided to participate in the pro
gram.
This year's final application deadline
was last Friday, and though the numbers are

not yet final, Hoang estimates that 40 per
cent more Stanford students applied this
year than last.
"We haven't seen a lot of growth at
Stanford in the past few years," Hoang
said. "So this is all very exciting to Teach
For America."
But the organization's recruiting efforts
at Stanford still face obstacles.
Hoang said that Teach For America's
support at Stanford is not as strong as it is at
many of the Ivy League schools. While its
peer institutions provide space for inter
views, Stanford's applicants were inter
viewed off-campus.
In addition, 12 percent of graduating
seniors at Harvard, Yale and Dartmouth

apply to Teach For America. Last year, only
5 percent of Stanford seniors applied.
Hoang said.
According to Rodriguez, faculty opposi
tion to the program at Stanford also makes
recruiting difficult.
Linda Darling-Hammond, a professor in
the School of Education, is one of the most
outspoken critics of Teach For America. In
an Apr. 2(X)5 study, she explained that the
program's participants are under qualified.
"A lot of questions have been raised as to
whether bright college students can be ef
fective when thrown into a classroom set
ting and asked to teach," she said in the
