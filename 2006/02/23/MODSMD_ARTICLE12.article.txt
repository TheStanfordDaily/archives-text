## Number of Teach For America applicants on the rise at Stanford Program seeks to eliminate educational inequality 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
Thanks to strong campus recruiting ef
forts, Teach For America has witnessed a
boost in applications from Stanford seniors
this year.
With the goal to eliminate educational
inequity across the country. Teach For
America consists of a national corps of col
lege graduates who commit to teaching in
underprivileged public schools for two
years.

According to the organization's Web
site, over 14,(XX) individuals from all back
grounds and career interests have joined
Teach For America in the last 15 years.
As the Bay Area recruitment director
for the organization, Jennifer Hoang said
she spends much of her time encouraging
students to consider the program as an al
ternative post-graduation opportunity.
At Stanford, Hoang is assisted by three
student campaign managers, including sen
ior Leticia Rodriguez, who has also been ac
cepted to the 2006 corps of teachers.
"We're pretty much responsible for all
marketing on-campus and getting the
word out about Teach For America," Ro
driguez said.

Both Hoang and Rodriguez attributed
the increase in applications this year to
heightened recruiting efforts.
"We've come up with new ideas about
ways to recruit people and we're having
more focused information sessions," Ro
driguez said. "We've really made a con
scious effort this year to come up with as
much as we can for flyers and to get peo
ple informed about what Teach For
America is."
Last year, according to Hoang, 82 Stan
ford students applied, 27 were accepted,
and 17 decided to participate in the pro
gram.
This year's final application deadline
was last Friday, and though the numbers are

not yet final, Hoang estimates that 40 per
cent more Stanford students applied this
year than last.
"We haven't seen a lot of growth at
Stanford in the past few years," Hoang
said. "So this is all very exciting to Teach
For America."
But the organization's recruiting efforts
at Stanford still face obstacles.
Hoang said that Teach For America's
support at Stanford is not as strong as it is at
many of the Ivy League schools. While its
peer institutions provide space for inter
views, Stanford's applicants were inter
viewed off-campus.
In addition, 12 percent of graduating
seniors at Harvard, Yale and Dartmouth

apply to Teach For America. Last year, only
5 percent of Stanford seniors applied.
Hoang said.
According to Rodriguez, faculty opposi
tion to the program at Stanford also makes
recruiting difficult.
Linda Darling-Hammond, a professor in
the School of Education, is one of the most
outspoken critics of Teach For America. In
an Apr. 2(X)5 study, she explained that the
program's participants are under qualified.
"A lot of questions have been raised as to
whether bright college students can be ef
fective when thrown into a classroom set
ting and asked to teach," she said in the
study. "Certified teachers always out performed
uncertified teachers."
Rodriguez recognized this criticism as a hin
drance to recruiting at Stanford.
"One of the other problems with recruiting at
Stanford is that we have one of the harshest critics
[of Teach For America], Linda Darling-Ham
mond, in the School of Education," she said. "With
her and the [Stanford Teacher Education Project
(STEP)] program, it's definitely difficult to recruit
people at Stanford."
Hoang added that the array of post-graduate
options available to Stanford students made re
cruiting an uphill battle.
"The consulting and i-banking firms do really
heavy recruiting at Stanford," she said. "As a non
profit we can't afford to do things like that."
Rodriguez concurred, comparing the recruiting
differences between public and private schools.
"[Recruiting at Stanford is] very tough, because
people have so many options here," she said. "It'd
be totally different if we had been recruiting at a
state school, I'm sure, where people's options
might be more limited."
"Everyone here is career-oriented and so they
want what's going to be best for them in the end,"
Rodriguez added. "But the message we want to get
out there is that Teach For America is just as great
of an opportunity as working at an i-banking firm
or working in Washington after graduation."
She also addressed some of the more common
misconceptions about the organization, emphasiz
ing that students should not think of the program
as a cushy two-year vacation.
"Teach For America is a very intense program,"
she said. "Our mission is to reduce the achieve
ment gap, so we're sending people into the most
troubled schools, the schools that need it the
most."
She also said that the program's objective is not
solely to encourage participants to pursue careers
in education.
"That's not really what it's about," Rodriguez
said. "The mission is to address the achievement
gap between students in low-income communities
and those in higher-income communities, so really.
Teach For America is for anyone who's passionate
about social change and social justice issues."
Hoang added that the spike in interest at Stan
ford this year was very heartening.
"I see this growth [at Stanford] and that's very
exciting. It feels like there's a call to action here,"
she said.
Despite the increase in applications this year,
some Stanford seniors said they felt Teach For
America did not fit their needs and goals.
Jennifer Lee, a senior who aspires to be a
teacher, explained that the program did not appeal
to her because she feels too inexperienced to jump
into a troubled school right away.
"I think Teach for America is a great program,"
Lee said."[But] I think I would be even more con
fident and prepared if I had more training, which is
why I am also looking into other teaching creden
tial programs such as STEP."
She added that she felt more training — rather
than immediate experience — would help her be
come a better teacher.
"I feel that going through more philosophical
training as well as hands-on experience will help
me to be an even better teacher when I am given
my own classroom," she said.

Stanford in the past few years," Hoang
said. "So this is all very exciting to Teach
For America."
But the organization's recruiting efforts
at Stanford still face obstacles.
Hoang said that Teach For America's
support at Stanford is not as strong as it is at
many of the Ivy League schools. While its
peer institutions provide space for inter
views, Stanford's applicants were inter
viewed off-campus.
In addition, 12 percent of graduating
seniors at Harvard, Yale and Dartmouth

apply to Teach For America. Last year, only
5 percent of Stanford seniors applied.
Hoang said.
According to Rodriguez, faculty opposi
tion to the program at Stanford also makes
recruiting difficult.
Linda Darling-Hammond, a professor in
the School of Education, is one of the most
outspoken critics of Teach For America. In
an Apr. 2(X)5 study, she explained that the
program's participants are under qualified.
"A lot of questions have been raised as to
whether bright college students can be ef
fective when thrown into a classroom set
ting and asked to teach," she said in the
study. "Certified teachers always out performed
uncertified teachers."
Rodriguez recognized this criticism as a hin
drance to recruiting at Stanford.
"One of the other problems with recruiting at
Stanford is that we have one of the harshest critics
[of Teach For America], Linda Darling-Ham
mond, in the School of Education," she said. "With
her and the [Stanford Teacher Education Project
(STEP)] program, it's definitely difficult to recruit
people at Stanford."
Hoang added that the array of post-graduate
options available to Stanford students made re
cruiting an uphill battle.
"The consulting and i-banking firms do really
heavy recruiting at Stanford," she said. "As a non
profit we can't afford to do things like that."
Rodriguez concurred, comparing the recruiting
differences between public and private schools.
"[Recruiting at Stanford is] very tough, because
people have so many options here," she said. "It'd
be totally different if we had been recruiting at a
state school, I'm sure, where people's options
might be more limited."
"Everyone here is career-oriented and so they
want what's going to be best for them in the end,"
Rodriguez added. "But the message we want to get
out there is that Teach For America is just as great
of an opportunity as working at an i-banking firm
or working in Washington after graduation."
She also addressed some of the more common
misconceptions about the organization, emphasiz
ing that students should not think of the program
as a cushy two-year vacation.
"Teach For America is a very intense program,"
she said. "Our mission is to reduce the achieve
ment gap, so we're sending people into the most
troubled schools, the schools that need it the
most."
She also said that the program's objective is not
solely to encourage participants to pursue careers
in education.
"That's not really what it's about," Rodriguez
said. "The mission is to address the achievement
gap between students in low-income communities
and those in higher-income communities, so really.
Teach For America is for anyone who's passionate
about social change and social justice issues."
Hoang added that the spike in interest at Stan
ford this year was very heartening.
"I see this growth [at Stanford] and that's very
exciting. It feels like there's a call to action here,"
she said.
Despite the increase in applications this year,
some Stanford seniors said they felt Teach For
America did not fit their needs and goals.
Jennifer Lee, a senior who aspires to be a
teacher, explained that the program did not appeal
to her because she feels too inexperienced to jump
into a troubled school right away.
"I think Teach for America is a great program,"
Lee said."[But] I think I would be even more con
fident and prepared if I had more training, which is
why I am also looking into other teaching creden
tial programs such as STEP."
She added that she felt more training — rather
than immediate experience — would help her be
come a better teacher.
"I feel that going through more philosophical
training as well as hands-on experience will help
me to be an even better teacher when I am given
my own classroom," she said.
Thanks to strong campus recruiting ef
forts, Teach For America has witnessed a
boost in applications from Stanford seniors
this year.
With the goal to eliminate educational
inequity across the country. Teach For
America consists of a national corps of col
lege graduates who commit to teaching in
underprivileged public schools for two
years.

According to the organization's Web
site, over 14,(XX) individuals from all back
grounds and career interests have joined
Teach For America in the last 15 years.
As the Bay Area recruitment director
for the organization, Jennifer Hoang said
she spends much of her time encouraging
students to consider the program as an al
ternative post-graduation opportunity.
At Stanford, Hoang is assisted by three
student campaign managers, including sen
ior Leticia Rodriguez, who has also been ac
cepted to the 2006 corps of teachers.
"We're pretty much responsible for all
marketing on-campus and getting the
word out about Teach For America," Ro
driguez said.

Both Hoang and Rodriguez attributed
the increase in applications this year to
heightened recruiting efforts.
"We've come up with new ideas about
ways to recruit people and we're having
more focused information sessions," Ro
driguez said. "We've really made a con
scious effort this year to come up with as
much as we can for flyers and to get peo
ple informed about what Teach For
America is."
Last year, according to Hoang, 82 Stan
ford students applied, 27 were accepted,
and 17 decided to participate in the pro
gram.
This year's final application deadline
was last Friday, and though the numbers are

not yet final, Hoang estimates that 40 per
cent more Stanford students applied this
year than last.
"We haven't seen a lot of growth at
Stanford in the past few years," Hoang
said. "So this is all very exciting to Teach
For America."
But the organization's recruiting efforts
at Stanford still face obstacles.
