## VEGGIE FLAVORS FOR FLOMO DINERS 
### 
While Stanford Dining isn't necessarily anything to
write home about, for the most part, it's pretty
good. But what if you're hankering for a thick, juicy
slab of grilled eggplant? Or succulent seitan — a high-pro
tein. low-fat meat substitute made from wheat gluten? Or
even a melt-in-your-mouth garbanzo curry?
What's cookin' if you're an herbivore? Ibis is the ques
tion seniors Christina Liebner and David Louk, residential
assistants (RA) in Wilbur, seek to answer. For Liebner, who
in the past has chomped down on the gourmet eats in veggie
havens Synergy and Columbae, and Louk. who was practi
cally breastfed in Hippieville, Ore. and swears by his honey
roasted soynuts, the deep-fried tofu at the Wilbur Market
place just doesn't always satisfy.
Winter quarter was barely a week old and the night wind
blew cold across the bare toes of Louk and Liebner's flip
flopped feet as they trudged across campus. The muses of ad
venture (a.k.a. Wilbur-induced indigestion) had called us
forth at last for another Destination Dining escapade, this
time to Florence Moore Hall, well-known in campus folklore
for its hand-dipped ice cream.
As the doors slammed shut behind us. a beautifully deco
rated FloMo servery (we love this word "servery") opened
up ahead. Taking on the veil of a Middle Eastern-themed
dining experience, bright, colorful fabrics embellished coun
tertops and fluffy couscous filled rustic terra cotta bowls. Our
favorite touch: six small ceramic dishes with complementary
tiny spoons served lavender, mint, coriander, cumin, cinna
mon and sumac to allow the discerning diner to customize his
or her meal.
Strolling casually around the "servery" (no lines here, in
fact, the place was startlingly empty), Louk and Liebner re
joiced as they counted not one, but two fantastic tofu dishes
and just as many different vegetable medleys. Ibe salad bar
brimmed with fresh veggies of all kinds, but Louk noted the
unfortunate mixing of spinach with greens, and Liebner
lamented the lack of pasta salad-y dishes.
And then they beheld a wondrous sight: a dolmas bar re
plete with olives, feta, hummus, pita, mint yogurt sauce and
more. The hummus was fantastic as expected, but the pita
was just a bit too crunchy to be called fresh. Liebner found
gems of crumb-stuffed baked tomatoes, and Louk warmed
his soul with a bowl of the sweet-and-sour tofu soup (which
looked like miso soup without the scallions, but tasted like
chicken broth with tofu — a schizo soup, if you will). An in
tensely cheesy baked ziti made Liebner melt, and Louk de
voured his couscous and Veggie Medley Number Two. Satis
fyingly full of the savory dinner dishes, Louk and Liebner re
entered the "servery" and strode confidently in the direction
of dessert.
As many times as we had heard the legends of FloMo
dessert repeated to awed diners on our eastern end of cam
pus, neither of us was quite prepared for the confectionary
cacophony we confronted. Six tubs of exotic flavors, from
Wild Berry Safari to Green Tea to the nearly-extinct Cookie
Dough destroyed our preconceptions of ice cream; smooth
and creamy low-fat frozen yogurt that swirled dreamily from
the machine; chopped nuts, coconut, chocolate and rainbow
sprinkles, Oreo crumbs, white chocolate chips and Butterfin
ger pieces stood ready to accessorize whichever dessert we
chose. Butterscotch, fudge and Kiwi Lime Designer Dessert
sauces brought our collective sweet tooth to the edge.
Kiwi Lime Designer Dessert sauce — We had to have it.
Louk smothered a piece of shortcake with strawberry top
ping, whipped cream. Oreo pieces, white chocolate pieces,
and with only the slightest misgiving, the neon-green Kiwi
Lime Designer Dessert sauce.
Liebner twisted together vanilla and chocolate fro-yo and
complemented it with butterscotch and Oreo crumbs. We
couldn't say we had dined at FloMo without trying the hand
dipped, so we went for the fantastically named Wild Berry
Safari. In cherry-ish ice cream nestled little dark chocolate
pieces, which upon very close inspection were leaping rabbit
shapes filled with raspberry liqueur. Oh god, it was good. We
swore that such an orgasmic dessert should only be served on
a campus where the students aren't getting any (oh, wait...).
Liebner's fro-yo fantasia was phenomenal, but Louk's
creation inspired a theorem of FloMo dining: the First Law
of Pluto's. (For those of you familiar with the restaurant on
University Avenue, you know you can't make a great dinner
by simply piling all your favorite foods together: mandarin
oranges and artichoke hearts do not good bedfellows make.)
Thus:
Given: too many designer dessert options.
Assume: one empty plate.
Find: one meal with balanced flavors.
Proof: Using the axiom that The Sum of the Parts is Much
Greater Than the Whole.you'll find the series diverges unless
n is less than or equal to, er, pie. Oof.
QED.
Happy and full, we braved the cold once again to return
to Wilbur, where food fatigue made us pass out and dark
chocolate bunnies leapt through our dreams.

(Food quality is rated in howls of cereal: the number of bowls
of cereal that we, combined, consumed at the meal. The more
bowls of cereal, the less good the food is. Vegetarian options
are measured in blocks of tofu, with one being very little and
five being a full tofu bar complete with tofu dipping sauces
and tofu-flavored fro-yo.)
