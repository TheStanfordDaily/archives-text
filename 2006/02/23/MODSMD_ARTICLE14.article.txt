# The 						making of a tree
## WILD PURSUIT OF NEW MASCOT BEGINS TODAY 
### LOREN NEWTHAN 
CIPVPft cross campus, a select group of students is opening industrial-size cans
of maple syrup, loading pistols, trying on fireproof suits and sharpen
ing their bone saws. At 4 p.m. today, all hell will break loose — name-
M ly, the legendary Tree Week audition process for the Stanford Band's
infamous mascot. The process kicks

dHfcoff today with an informational meet
ing at the Band Shak.
Many witnessed an early Tree Week stunt at

Sunday's basketball game when senior Tommy
Leep danced onto the court with the Dollies during a timeout and then dropped
trou in front of the entire arena. The words "p'dt me for Tree" were written across
Leep's back and chest. The San Francisco Chronicle ran the story this week under

the headline, "Stanford falls flat in big game, leaves streaking to spectator."
Sources close to Leep have claimed that he was later arrested for indecent ex
posure. However, the Stanford Department of Public Safety had no knowledge of
the arrest, which is suspected to be part of a Leep's publicity

strategy.
Prospective Trees have typically used the information
meeting to announce their candidacy with dramatic, if
not shocking flair. Funeral processions, police heli
j _ . j . t-.i. ia. i_ ii

copter drops and even a traveling bat mitzvah have
set the tone for historic campaigns.
The meeting will mark the beginning of a three
step application process for prospective mascots.
According to Bryan Schell. former drum major
and this year's Tree Week coordinator, all candi
dates must complete a written application, give an
interview with undisclosed Band officials and par
ticipate in voluntary stunts to prove their worth.

"After the advent of the Tree in the mid-1980s, the
selection process grew out of old Trees wanting to select
the new Tree to personify the image of what the tree is
— the anti-mascot," Schell tells The Daily. "[The selec-

tion process itself] is something I can't say too
much about because it would bias the people
who are trying out. It's a variety of people
[who make the final decision]. It's not just
one person, it's not just the old Tree."
Stunts vary in intensity every year de
pending on the individuals trying out.

"The key thing about stunts is that they're not required, hut the candidates need
to do something to show they should he Tree," Schell says. "For example, a few years
ago one of the candidates dressed up like the Hamburgler and ran around Stern
Dining stealing people's hamburgers. One of the mascots got in a cardboard box
and had a golf cart run over him. There have been lots of naked episodes in the
past."
Other rumored stunts in the past have included a candidate dressing up like a
deer and diving in front of the University president's car, 24-hour marriages, sky
diving onto Hoover Tower, catapulting into Lake Lagunita, a fake drowning, rap
pellingdown Hoover Tower on fire, being shot with a rifle, walking through walls of
fire, being duct taped to a tree and wrestling a pig while covered in Crisco.
The Band lays out only very general guidelines for the stunts, according to
Schell, because Tree Week is supposed to focus on the candidates. The Band does
suggest that prospective Trees avoid hospitalization and arrest. The only real rule is
"don't get the Band in trouble."
"It's like us asking the candidates,' You are the Tree for a week, what would you
do?' And then they show us," Schell says.
In the past, the sitting Tree has overseen the selection process of the next mas
cot, however, due to the dismissal of cotermi-

nal student Erin Lashnits,

last year's Tree, Schell
agreed to perform the
duties. Due to the re
cent alcohol-related in
cidents leading to
Lashnits' suspension,
the administration will
review the Tree selec
tion process this year.
"After this last
Tree, the administra
tion reviewed the se
lection process to
see if there was
something keeping

the Trees doing bad
things," Schell
says. "So we're
adding some re
visions to the

free selection process; not too many, but we are involving the Band as a whole in
the process a little more."
These reforms are meant to encourage the future Tree to be less dependent on
alcohol, he added.
"If you're the Tree you don't have to be a

drunk, you don't have to be an alcoholic,"
Schell continues. "We're looking for somebody
who can do all that fun crazy stuff without hav
ing to be drunk."

The Band stresses fact that candidates do not necessarily need to possess a com
plete disregard for self-preservation.
"The one thing I want to emphasize to anyone who is thinking about

trying out to be Tree is that even though one year a guy cut off part of
his pinky toe, that shouldn't intimidate people," Schell says. "That's not
all that people do. There are lots of ways to show you should be tree
without hurting yourself. There was a [prospective] Tree one year who

got all the Nobel Laureates on campus to write him letters of recom
mendation."
The former Tree has a different prediction for this year's week of
festivities.

" [The] police will not have hut a moment's rest.TheTreehouse will
inevitably be out of beer by the end of every night," Lashnits toldThe
Daily in January. "A handful of courageous Stanford students will
have the best, most intense week of their college careers, and one
lucky bastard will emerge as The One — the most badass, insane,
hardcore partier, with the least regard for personal safety, perma
nent police record or proper liver function — the Tree."
| "Tree stunts have to happen during Tree Week to be considered

for the selection process," Schell says. "There was some stuff at
the basketball game on Sunday. Even though it was cool, it does
n't count for Tree Week."
Another Tree candidate, who ran against Lashnits last year, has
also made her candidacy known. Junior Christina Zempel, a resident

assistant in Alondra, is theming her stunts according to
the Guttermouth song "Bruce Lee vs. The Kiss Army."
"[TheTree is] the most badass person at Stanford." says
Zempel. "The one kid you know can do whatever it
takes, is not afraid of permanent injury, and won't take
shit from anybody. Probably secretly a ninja."

Sophomore Daniel N, also the managing editor of sports at The Daily,
has also announced his candidacy.
Many of the Tree stunts will take place in White Plaza around noon; however,
stunts are allowed anytime during the week. Generally,individual candidates are re
sponsible for their own publicity. According to Schell, this generally takes the form
of e-mailing specifics for various stunts to dorm and club lists. Usually details find
their way around campus through a combination of
organized advertisements and word of

mouth.
"Tree Week is an even
where stuff happens that is
very uniquely Stanford. If
you want to experience
what goes on that week
you definitely should be
able to," Schell says.
In the past, anywhere from

six to 30 individuals have made the
bid for mascot-hood each year. The
Band has no idea how many there will
he this year.
"It's kind of a self-selecting process.
A lot of people believe that they're
not crazy enough," says Schell. "I feel
like a lot of people are intimidated by

what past Trees have done. But I think
that there are a lot of people at Stanford
with the capacity to be that celebrity, that per
son who everybody knows and everybody
wants to be."

Excitement around campus seems to be growing, as students are anticipating the
fabled event with increasing enthusiasm.
"I'm definitely excited," says freshman Alex Levin. "Tree Week sounds so crazy,
it'll be hilarious."
"I'm really psyched to see people light themselves on fire and roll around in
grease," adds freshman Gwen Luca.
Does the old Tree have any advice for the wannabe Trees?
"You do not do drugs, you are drugs," Lashnits says."The Tree is not love. The
Tree is a hammer with which we crush our enemies. Every candidate must under
stand the truth: power grows from the barrel of a gun."
The week will culminate on March 4 with the crowning of a new Tree.

"You do not do drugs, you are drugs," Lashnits says."The Tree is not love. The
Tree is a hammer with which we crush our enemies. Every candidate must under
stand the truth: power grows from the barrel of a gun."
The week will culminate on March 4 with the crowning of a new Tree.

infamous mascot. The process kicks

dHfcoff today with an informational meet
ing at the Band Shak.
Many witnessed an early Tree Week stunt at

Sunday's basketball game when senior Tommy
Leep danced onto the court with the Dollies during a timeout and then dropped
trou in front of the entire arena. The words "p'dt me for Tree" were written across
Leep's back and chest. The San Francisco Chronicle ran the story this week under

the headline, "Stanford falls flat in big game, leaves streaking to spectator."
Sources close to Leep have claimed that he was later arrested for indecent ex
posure. However, the Stanford Department of Public Safety had no knowledge of
the arrest, which is suspected to be part of a Leep's publicity

strategy.
Prospective Trees have typically used the information
meeting to announce their candidacy with dramatic, if
not shocking flair. Funeral processions, police heli
j _ . j . t-.i. ia. i_ ii

copter drops and even a traveling bat mitzvah have
set the tone for historic campaigns.
The meeting will mark the beginning of a three
step application process for prospective mascots.
According to Bryan Schell. former drum major
and this year's Tree Week coordinator, all candi
dates must complete a written application, give an
interview with undisclosed Band officials and par
ticipate in voluntary stunts to prove their worth.

"After the advent of the Tree in the mid-1980s, the
selection process grew out of old Trees wanting to select
the new Tree to personify the image of what the tree is
— the anti-mascot," Schell tells The Daily. "[The selec-

tion process itself] is something I can't say too
much about because it would bias the people
who are trying out. It's a variety of people
[who make the final decision]. It's not just
one person, it's not just the old Tree."
Stunts vary in intensity every year de
pending on the individuals trying out.

"The key thing about stunts is that they're not required, hut the candidates need
to do something to show they should he Tree," Schell says. "For example, a few years
ago one of the candidates dressed up like the Hamburgler and ran around Stern
Dining stealing people's hamburgers. One of the mascots got in a cardboard box
and had a golf cart run over him. There have been lots of naked episodes in the
past."
Other rumored stunts in the past have included a candidate dressing up like a
deer and diving in front of the University president's car, 24-hour marriages, sky
diving onto Hoover Tower, catapulting into Lake Lagunita, a fake drowning, rap
pellingdown Hoover Tower on fire, being shot with a rifle, walking through walls of
fire, being duct taped to a tree and wrestling a pig while covered in Crisco.
The Band lays out only very general guidelines for the stunts, according to
Schell, because Tree Week is supposed to focus on the candidates. The Band does
suggest that prospective Trees avoid hospitalization and arrest. The only real rule is
"don't get the Band in trouble."
"It's like us asking the candidates,' You are the Tree for a week, what would you
do?' And then they show us," Schell says.
In the past, the sitting Tree has overseen the selection process of the next mas
cot, however, due to the dismissal of cotermi-

nal student Erin Lashnits,

last year's Tree, Schell
agreed to perform the
duties. Due to the re
cent alcohol-related in
cidents leading to
Lashnits' suspension,
the administration will
review the Tree selec
tion process this year.
"After this last
Tree, the administra
tion reviewed the se
lection process to
see if there was
something keeping

the Trees doing bad
things," Schell
says. "So we're
adding some re
visions to the

free selection process; not too many, but we are involving the Band as a whole in
the process a little more."
These reforms are meant to encourage the future Tree to be less dependent on
alcohol, he added.
"If you're the Tree you don't have to be a

drunk, you don't have to be an alcoholic,"
Schell continues. "We're looking for somebody
who can do all that fun crazy stuff without hav
ing to be drunk."

The Band stresses fact that candidates do not necessarily need to possess a com
plete disregard for self-preservation.
"The one thing I want to emphasize to anyone who is thinking about

trying out to be Tree is that even though one year a guy cut off part of
his pinky toe, that shouldn't intimidate people," Schell says. "That's not
all that people do. There are lots of ways to show you should be tree
without hurting yourself. There was a [prospective] Tree one year who

got all the Nobel Laureates on campus to write him letters of recom
mendation."
The former Tree has a different prediction for this year's week of
festivities.

" [The] police will not have hut a moment's rest.TheTreehouse will
inevitably be out of beer by the end of every night," Lashnits toldThe
Daily in January. "A handful of courageous Stanford students will
have the best, most intense week of their college careers, and one
lucky bastard will emerge as The One — the most badass, insane,
hardcore partier, with the least regard for personal safety, perma
nent police record or proper liver function — the Tree."
| "Tree stunts have to happen during Tree Week to be considered

for the selection process," Schell says. "There was some stuff at
the basketball game on Sunday. Even though it was cool, it does
n't count for Tree Week."
Another Tree candidate, who ran against Lashnits last year, has
also made her candidacy known. Junior Christina Zempel, a resident

assistant in Alondra, is theming her stunts according to
the Guttermouth song "Bruce Lee vs. The Kiss Army."
"[TheTree is] the most badass person at Stanford." says
Zempel. "The one kid you know can do whatever it
takes, is not afraid of permanent injury, and won't take
shit from anybody. Probably secretly a ninja."

Sophomore Daniel N, also the managing editor of sports at The Daily,
has also announced his candidacy.
Many of the Tree stunts will take place in White Plaza around noon; however,
stunts are allowed anytime during the week. Generally,individual candidates are re
sponsible for their own publicity. According to Schell, this generally takes the form
of e-mailing specifics for various stunts to dorm and club lists. Usually details find
their way around campus through a combination of
organized advertisements and word of

mouth.
"Tree Week is an even
where stuff happens that is
very uniquely Stanford. If
you want to experience
what goes on that week
you definitely should be
able to," Schell says.
In the past, anywhere from

six to 30 individuals have made the
bid for mascot-hood each year. The
Band has no idea how many there will
he this year.
"It's kind of a self-selecting process.
A lot of people believe that they're
not crazy enough," says Schell. "I feel
like a lot of people are intimidated by

what past Trees have done. But I think
that there are a lot of people at Stanford
with the capacity to be that celebrity, that per
son who everybody knows and everybody
wants to be."

Excitement around campus seems to be growing, as students are anticipating the
fabled event with increasing enthusiasm.
"I'm definitely excited," says freshman Alex Levin. "Tree Week sounds so crazy,
it'll be hilarious."
"I'm really psyched to see people light themselves on fire and roll around in
grease," adds freshman Gwen Luca.
