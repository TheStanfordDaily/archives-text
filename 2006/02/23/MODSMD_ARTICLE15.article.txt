Parents and students will be
serenaded this weekend by Tal
isman and the Mendicants at
6:30 p.m. on Friday, Feb. 24 in
Toyon Lounge. The two a cap
pella groups' traditional Par
ents' Weekend show combines
diverse talents in a musical ex
travaganza that will be free and
open to the public.
"Our styles of music are non
overlapping, so if you come to
our show, you'll get a good vari
ety," said Mendicants President
Stephen Hensley. The all-male
Mendicants perform fun, feel
good material from artists rang
ing from Van Morrison to the
Beatles, featuring trademark
crowd-pleaser "Brown-Eyed
Girl." Talisman specializes in
more ethnic music from around
the world — especially African
and African American songs.
Both groups will perform a
combination of old favorites and

new arrangements. Among Tal
isman's newer arrangements is
"Prison Holler," a spiritual song
about the toils of prisoners in the
South. Members of both groups
find that the Parents' Weekend
show offers a unique chance to
showcase their year-round ef
forts.
"We in the a cappella groups
have accomplished quite a bit
over the year, and having our par
ents there to witness what we've
done is fulfilling for the mem
bers," said Talisman Business
Manager Teresa Dicolen, a soph
omore.
The ensembles have been
practicing up to three hours a
day in the weeks leading up to
the show, temporarily suspend
ing album recording sessions to
concentrate on preparing for
their performance programs.
"People sometimes leave be
cause it's such a time commit
ment — being in a cappella
sucks up a huge part of your life.
Committing yourself to that for
multiple years says you're will

ing to do this instead of every
thing else you could he doing in
college," said Mixed Company
member Natasha Chen, a senior.
Members of Stanford a cap
pella groups typically partici
pate for two to four years, with
several groups experiencing
large turnover from year to year
because of the serious time
spent rehearsing. Some rehearse
between six to nine hours per
week, and up to several hours a
day in the weeks preceding im
portant events. The performanc
es themselves take up time, not
to mention sporadic recording
sessions.
When asked what keeps
them devoted to their respective
a cappella groups, leaders of all
of Stanford's nine responded in
part that they have found anoth
er family in their fellow singers.
Members often become very
close outside of rehearsals.
"Everyday People is genuine
ly a family," said Business Direc
tor Sarah Kleinman, a sopho
more. of the hip-hop, R&B, Mo

town and soul group. "We spend
more time together outside of re
hearsal than we do in the six to
nine hours of rehearsal that we
have each week. We are a sup
portive social network, and we
go to each other first in times of
need."
Each group has carved out a
particular niche in the Stanford
a cappella community, still hop
ing to appeal to a diverse audi
ence
"In blending music from
South Asia with Western music,
we're hoping to bring fans of
South Asian music a source of a
cappella entertainment while
also making South Asian music
accessible to everyone," said
Raagapella Business Manager
Antardeb Guharay, a sopho
more. The Harmonics' award
winning repertoire of rock songs,
the Mendicants' highly mar
ketable mix and Talisman's
worldly fare are just a few of the
many styles floating on the Stan
ford breeze.
"At my call-back freshman

year, I listened to Talisman
singing 'One by One.' I felt real
ly moved by music for the first
time. It was a wonderful sound.
That's how I knew this was what
I wanted to do at Stanford," Di
colen says.
Each group has one standout
traditional performance every
year in addition to quarterly
shows. Everyday People per
forms on Halloween, Harmonics
sings on St. Patrick's Day, and
Mixed Company serenades sin
gles at their Valentine's show
"Love Sucks." Business man
agers continually seek out pri
vate events to raise money to
record albums, and all groups
prepare spring concerts to show
case their year of hard work.
Due to the demanding sched
ule and creative effort involved,
performances can be as reward
ing to the singers as to their lis
teners, Dicolen says.
"When you see how all the
hard work pays off, you can let go
of the chaos and stress that hap
pens beforehand," she added.
