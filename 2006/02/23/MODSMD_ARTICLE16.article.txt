## Editorial Tuition hike should spark dialogue, not complaints 
### 
Maybe the decision of the Board of
Trustees to raise tuition by 5.75 per
cent came as a surprise to you. But
really, we all saw it coming.
While some students may have respond
ed with expletive-laden diatribes, others
may have silently cemented their plans to
graduate early. Meanwhile, the Editorial
Board could easily continue its longstanding
tradition of chiding the Board for its deci
sion, while resigning itself to the fact that
nothing we say on The Daily's opinions page
could possibly reverse it.
To put things in proper perspective, the
recent "spike" in tuition is not all that high
er than tuition hikes of previous years. Un
dergraduate tuition crossed the $30,000
mark after two successive increases of 4.5
percent over the past two years. Likewise,
part-time graduate tuition has also seen
steady increases. While this year's increase
is larger than usual, we would be far more
shocked if the Board of Trustees had decid
ed to cut tuition.
The Editorial Board feels that too much
ink has already been spilled lamenting the
inevitable increases in tuition. However, we
cannot help but wonder if there is a better
way to improve dialogue between the Board
of Trustees and the student population re
garding tuition hikes.
On some level, every Stanford student
knows that the University has to raise tuition
by some amount every year. Stanford needs
more revenue to retain its competitive edge
over its peers. Besides, it has had to institute
budgets cuts and wage freezes in the past to
control costs. Most students would concede
that the University is justified in raising tu
ition to meet rising costs.
What we find hard to accept, however, is
the lack of dialogue and discourse surround
ing the process that leads to such hikes. We
believe that the University went through a
thorough and elaborate process to arrive at
the figure of 5.75 percent. But much of that
elaborate process remains completely
opaque to the average Stanford student,
who might believe the number to be less ar
bitrary if they could view it within the larger
framework of income and expenses.
After all, students would be less averse to

forking over more money for their Stanford
educations if we knew where it was going. To
that end, the Board of Trustees could do
more to provide students with a better sense
of where tuition money ends up. Are our dol
lars going toward funding more programs
for freshman and sophomore programs or
building newer facilities on campus? We'd
like to know.
Also, the trustees could let students know
how tuition income compares to the Univer
sity's other sources of funding such as alum
ni donations or federal grants. What percent
age of academic programs is actually funded
by tuition? Would it be feasible, for instance,
for the University to raise more money
through alumni donations instead?
To make matters worse, many of the
Board's justifications for tuition increases
are unpersuasive. For instance, it often
points out that Stanford's undergraduate
program is already highly subsidized â€” but
this does little to take the sting out of that
extra 5 percent.
In addition, the Board of Trustees always
takes pains to emphasize that Stanford's
need-blind admissions policy and extensive
financial aid programs will somehow ame
liorate the effects of any tuition hike. How
ever, we feel that this argument does not res
onate with students, many of whom will have
to bear the full brunt of the recent jump. Ad
missions policies and financial aid go a long
way in helping the most underprivileged
Stanford students, but many have to foot the
higher bill themselves, either out of pocket
or through future loans. The Board should at
least acknowledge the fact that many stu
dents will have to deal with the tuition hikes
individually, and perhaps even develop pro
grams that will help students better address
those costs.
Every year, a lot of unwarranted vitriol is
directed at the Board of Trustees for its deci
sion to raise tuition. This year, the Editorial
Board has decided not to contribute to the
firestorm. We understand that the trustees
often have to make difficult and unpopular
decisions. Even so, we urge the Board to con
sider our reasoned plea for more dialogue
and to work toward greater mutual under
standing regarding this issue.
