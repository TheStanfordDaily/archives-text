						Modern Fairy Tale
## You can't go home again 
### 
According to Bill Bryson, "You can't
beat the phone company, you can't
make a waiter see you until he's
ready to see you and you can't go home
again."
I learned the last one the hard way when
1 returned to New York. Last year. 1 swore I
would leave the nest for good after getting
back from Oxford; even so, in September I
found myself moving back into my parents'
apartment rather than selling my organs to
pay rent in Manhattan.
Though I was eligible to graduate last
June, having entered Stanford with enough
advanced placement credit to make it easy
to finish in three years. 1 couldn't go through
with it; 1 just wasn't ready. But I couldn't
come back to Stanford either,especially with
several outstanding warrants for breaking
laws with James Frey.
Despite my obsession with Stanford
throughout high school, going there made
me realize how much I heart New York. Such
the opposite of the Big Apple, Stanford car
ried the appeal of the unknown. It was the
suburban childhood I never had, complete
with a preponderance of bicycle riding,
stores that don't stay open all night and an
inability to get anywhere without a car. My
fling with Stanford had its moments, but the
city's my first love.
Last year I had a plan: Find an impres
sive-sounding job, graduate, move out of my
parents' place and apply to medical school.
Instead I took a leave of absence, moved
back home and started temping. While I had
hoped to find work in publishing, I ended up
in a slightly less competitive field: filing and
data entry at an asbestos-testing agency.
Barring the summer after sophomore
year — when I worked in a lab at NYU and
lived with just my dad while the rest of my
family skipped town — this was my first
long-term return home. As much as I missed
my city, ultimately "home" means donning
the old clown suit and re-entering the three
ring circus that is family life.
Coming back was like walking through
the wardrobe into a strange new world.
In this world, there are no carbs. Before
leaving for college, my younger brother de
cided the family should get rid of any good
tasting, normal food and replace it with ei
ther cardboard or lard. They eat Splenda by
the truckload.Traditionally, I come home on
holidays to a fridge containing exactly half
an onion, a bag of radishes, a tin of instant
coffee and week-old leftover Chinese food.

Now low-carb milk (which surprisingly
tastes delicious), bacon and sugar-free jam
(which unsurprisingly tastes just as disgust
ing as it sounds) line our shelves.
Fitting back into the family routine was
tricky My parents didn't quite know what to
do with me. Years too late, my mother start
ed channeling those Partnership for a Drug-
Free America ads that suggest you barrage
your kids with questions to keep them out of
trouble. Whenever 1 stepped out the door,
my mother asked: "Where are you going?
Who will you be with? When will you be
back? Will there be boys there? When are
you going to clean your room?" Apparently
the apartment is caught in a time warp where
the past three years haven't happened and
I'm still in high school.
Disappointing her scores of male suitors,
my once well-adjusted younger sister took a
page from Miranda of "Sex and the City'"s
book and decided she was in an exclusive re
lationship with our TiVo, claiming to be
"emotionally stunted" and unable to com
mit to relationships with humans in general.
My sister's commitment to remaining un
committed stretched so far that she no
longer committed to speaking entire words:
Suddenly "obvious" is "obvi" and "totally" is
"tots." Hanging with her made me feel about
a million years old, especially as she's taken
to responding to everything I say with the
complaint: "You sound just like mom."
My cousin has replaced my brother. Al
though he lives on Long Island and goes to
college upstate, he often shows up at odd
hours in the middle of the week and sleeps in
my brother's empty room. I suspect my
cousin's skill with cars, ability to lift heavy
objects and general willingness to do what
ever my mother asks of him has endeared
him to her in a way that her actual children
have not.
Only one member of my family reliably
remains the same —my grandmother, who
has lived in this country* for upwards of 50
years but still claims not to speak any Eng
lish and calls us every day. As has always
been the case, there is no way to get her off
the phone without her invoking the protec
tion of various holy figures on my behalf —
an elaborate Greek litany amounting to,
"Whatever you're doing with your life, I'm
praying for you." Some things never change.
