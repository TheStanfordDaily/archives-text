# Drunk old white men with guns
## 
### 
Much like a crotchety old man, the Ch
eney/Bush administration is unable
to multi-task; it is provincial in its
outlook toward the world. And as recent
events have shown, these two characteristics
can be a dangerous mix.
This week, the l()th Mountain Division
was deployed in Afghanistan to secure
volatile areas and raise support for recently
elected president Hamid Karzai.
And in one of the most dangerous areas of
the world, how are the soldiers going to ac
complish this? By making nice, of course.
Before landing in Afghanistan, the sol
diers attended "cultural awareness pro
grams" to brush up on their knowledge of
the Afghani lifestyle. At these tutorials the
soldiers leai ucd intricate details of the cul
ture; for example, that the American ok
thumbs up is the equivalent to giving
someone the finger in Afghanistan.
The soldiers are also learning that the
Afghani tribes, most notably the Pashtun, are
really pissed and have revenge on their
minds. Soldiers are taught to be very careful
not to "anger" the Pashtuns, who live by a
strict code of honor called the Pashtunwali.
Right, because in a land that has been
ruled by war for decades and abhors the
United States, it is the soldiers who run the
risk of riling them up. Has anyone in the gov
ernment stopped to think that maybe they're
pissed for other reasons? But no, if the war
lords of the "Land of the Unruly" get angry,
it's because our soldiers aren't charming
enough.
Most importantly, a New York Times ar
ticle on this unique training noted that the
soldiers must be prepared for the
Afghani's slower perception of time.

"Everything takes so much longer than
you expect it," instructor Scott Moyer said.
"You just have to deal with it."
Oh. but that should be nothing new to the
soldiers â€” or the U.S. citizens for that mat
ter. We're accustomed to things taking
longer than they should. After all. it took the
White House a whole day to announce that
Cheney shot a man even though we all al
ready knew.
And while the country waited for the
White House to comment. Press Secretary
Scott McQellen joked that the National
Champion Texas Longhorns should be glad
they're wearing orange on their visit to the
White House. What he didn't mention, how
ever, is that while he was poking fun at the
vice president shooting someone, the victim
had just suffered a heart attack because one
of the pellets was lodged in his heart.
Jon Stewart's "Know Comment" seg
ment touched upon Scotty's press confer
ence demeanor in one of last week's
episodes.The clip started with Scotty saying
he "won't comment on that ongoing inves
tigation," then it offered multiple investiga
tions on which Scotty could be declining to
comment.The Valery Plame Investigation?
The Jack Abramoff Scandal? The recent
pictures of prisoner humiliation in Abu

Ghraib? The list went on and on until it
reached option ?Delta.? The point is that
the administration can't keep up with the
mounting scandals it now faces.
But does that really surprise anyone? Of
course this is too much for Cheney/Bush.
They hoped to keep the country focused
on one issue: the war. But the administra
tion can't seem to cope with the numerous
scandals and domestic issues that the
media can expose with help from sources
other than government officials. You could
tell Scotty was shaken as he squirmed at
the podium. You mean you knew about the
shooting before I told you? he thought,////.j
wasn Y part of the job description...
Scotty's press conferences and the now
"culturally aware" 10th Division reflect
the same characteristic of the Bush White
House: they don't look beyond themselves.
Of course Democracy will work in
Afghanistan, they thought, it works here
(even though that too is debatable). Of
course the public will side with us, they
think, because we'll tell them what we want
them to know.
And now, as I think about how the idea of
drunk old white men playing with their guns
may be the perfect metaphor for
Cheney/Bush and all their cronies, I can't
help but remember the words of Vince
Vaughn. No, Cheney, it's not entirely that I
have a problem with your hunting "as much
as I do with your general point of view...But
hey, let's go kill some birds, I'm psyched."
Thumbs up. Cheney.Thumbs way up.

If anyone wants to go quail hunting, or just
