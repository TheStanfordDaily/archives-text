Intelligent design must meet
evidentiary standards

Intelligent Design is the idea the whole
universe, including life, is so complicated
that it could not have originated by natural
means. There is certainly much that science
does not understand — we have no idea
what makes up 95 percent of the universe.
So a religious statement of faith that the ori
gin of life is beyond the understanding of
mortals is tempting.
But serious science requires years of ef
fort. I have no quarrel with believers of In
telligent Design as long as they don't try to
shove it down my throat as science with
the aid of my taxes. Otherwise, I subject
Intelligent Design to the same rude evi
dentiary standards of all scientific theo
ries. To use a theological word, we see no
signs that defy any rational explanation.
Galileo's statement nearly 400 years ago is
on point for all counts: "Surely, God could
have caused birds to fly with their bones
made of solid gold, with their veins full of
quicksilver, with their flesh heavier than
lead and with their wings exceedingly
small. He did not, and that ought to show
something." It is only in order to shield
your ignorance that you put the Lord at

every turn to the refuge of a miracle."

Respect the memory of Lightfoot
In yesterday's paper, columnist Adam
Badwound chose to lambaste my recent arti
cle in The Stanford Review on the history of
the Stanford Indian with a potpourri of at
tacks ('"Long Live Lightfoot?' Are you seri
ous?"). Rather than bombard readers of The
Daily with another poorly strung together
tit-for-tat, I instead wish to remark on the
issue at heart here: memory.
The Stanford American Indian Organiza
tion's knee-jerk reaction is a claim to owner
ship of history and a denial of certain tradi
tions that they deem "intolerant." They
should be congratulated on their efforts thus
far — I'm willing to bet that less than one
percent of Stanford's current population
even knows who Timm "Prince Lightfoot"
Williams is. (And if the SAIO had their way,
they never would.) As far as the S AIO is con
cerned, the Stanford Indian is something to
be scorned and forgotten.
The truth is, Williams was a good man who
did good work, and he was a Stanford Indian.
Williams hoped to bring Native American

culture into the forefront and represent his
tribe and people in a dignified, respectful
manner. Although Williams passed away be
fore many of the current Stanford students
were born, I've been told by those who knew
him that he was an inspiring, hard-working,
sincere and honest person who did good
things for his tribe.
In these recent debates, we've seen an ar
rogant air displayed by the SAIO —as
though they believe their group regulates
which part of Stanford's history is acceptable
for remembrance. Despite their tone. 1 take
heart, knowing that, however hard they cam
paign, Stanford will always have its history
and no organization can delete the memory
ofTimm Williams.
In a telling e-mail recently received from
a member of SAIO, I was asked to refrain
from commenting further on this issue. The
gentleman stated such debates were "unnec
essary," presumably because "it will not
change our position on the issue and does not
serve to make campus a better place." Some
how. I'm not surprised that members of the
SAIO would consider their close-minded
ness a compelling argument for restraint.
