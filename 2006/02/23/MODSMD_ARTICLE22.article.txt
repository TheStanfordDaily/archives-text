No. 11 women's bas
ketball still remembers
its disappointing 77-72
loss at Washington al
most two months ago.
And as the season
winds down with Se
nior Weekend, the Car
dinal are ready to re
turn the favor to the
Huskies the second
time around.
"There's definitely
added motivation,"
junior forward Kristin
Newlin said. "Just look
at UCLA and Arizona
State. We beat them the

first time, and then there was an added incentive
for them when we played them at their place. It's
the same thing for us here. We know what they're
capable of and we're excited about the opportuni
ty to play them again."
In the loss on Dec. 22, the Card (19-6, 13-3
Pac-10) found themselves up 51-38 in the second
half, only to blow the double-digit lead. Washing
ton (18-7,11-5) went on a 14-0 run to take their
second lead of the game, 55-53. midway through
the second half. The Cardinal, still struggling to
find a point guard and without Newlin down low,
committed 24 turnovers — including one with
just over a minute to go — to seal the win for the
Huskies.
Since the loss, Stanford has established fresh
man Rosalyn Gold-Onwude at the one, Candice
Wiggins has reemerged as the conference's pre
mier scorer at the two and Newlin has teamed with
junior center Brooke Smith to form a one-two
punch down low.
"The game will be a good measure to see how
much we've improved," head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "I think there's a natural human ten
dency, if you lose to someone, to [focus entirely on j
not letting that happen again. But for us, this a
great opportunity to come off a split and win the
Pac-10 regular season outright, and that should be
motivation enough."
Sure enough, Stanford enters the weekend up
a half-game on the second-place Sun Devils, so a
weekend sweep would seal the Card's sixth
straight regular season title. One Cardinal loss on
the weekend would allow Arizona State to play its
way into a first-place tie with a win over in-state
rival Arizona.
If, improbably, Stanford and Arizona State
each lose the remainder of their games. Washing
ton could play its way into a first-place tie with a
sweep of the Bay Area schools.
""We know we're in control of what happens,"
Newlin said. "We need to take care of business
here at home first and clinch the regular-season
title. Then we can focus our attention on the Pac
lOTournament. which will be competitive."
The Huskies, who play at Maples tonight at 7
p.m., will look to replicate what they did to Stan
ford in the first game — make the Cardinal cough
up the ball. Washington currently leads the confer
ence in steals (10.8 per game) and turnover margin
(+4.84).
But perhaps the best move the Huskies can
make is to once again force Wiggins into foul trou
ble. The sophomore guard sat for most of the
stretch run in Seattle with four fouls.
"She continues to be the go-to girl," Washing
ton head coach June Daugherty said. "I think she's
one of the special ones who don't come along real
often. For us, we try to put a lot of different people
on her, whether it's size or speed. Maybe hope for
the best, and try to give her different looks both in
personnel and style."
Stanford will close the season against Washing
ton State (8-17, 2-14) on Saturday at 2 p.m. The
Cougars have never beaten the Cardinal in 40 at
tempts, but one reason for optimism is junior for
ward Katie Benz. After back-to-back double-dou
bles in a weekend split with the Oregon schools,
the Pac-10 named Benz its Player of the Week.
The Cougars matchup brings not only title im
plications, but also the chance to send seniors
Krista Rappahahn and Shelley Nweke off from
Maples for the last time with a win.
"It's very emotional," Newlin said."We want to
win for them. I know Krista will play with a sense
of urgency, since she knows these are her last few
weekends of college basketball."
After spending her first years in the program as
a reserve, Rappahahn has made the most of her
chance to shine this season. She has been an out
side presence for the Cardinal all year, leading the
Pac-10 in three-point attempts (70), while shoot
ing 44.3 percent from downtown, good for third in
the conference.

The Card nud have the best field goal percentage in the conference, while Washington and
Washington State have the two worst. But tonight, the (lard should not underestimate
Washington, which heat Stanford in December and leads the conference in steals and
turnover margin. On Saturday, howcvei; Stanford should steam roll right past bottom
ranked Washington State.

the same thing for us here. We know what they're
capable of and we're excited about the opportuni
ty to play them again."
In the loss on Dec. 22, the Card (19-6, 13-3
Pac-10) found themselves up 51-38 in the second
half, only to blow the double-digit lead. Washing
ton (18-7,11-5) went on a 14-0 run to take their
second lead of the game, 55-53. midway through
the second half. The Cardinal, still struggling to
find a point guard and without Newlin down low,
committed 24 turnovers — including one with
just over a minute to go — to seal the win for the
Huskies.
Since the loss, Stanford has established fresh
man Rosalyn Gold-Onwude at the one, Candice
Wiggins has reemerged as the conference's pre
mier scorer at the two and Newlin has teamed with
junior center Brooke Smith to form a one-two
punch down low.
"The game will be a good measure to see how
much we've improved," head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "I think there's a natural human ten
dency, if you lose to someone, to [focus entirely on j
not letting that happen again. But for us, this a
great opportunity to come off a split and win the
Pac-10 regular season outright, and that should be
motivation enough."
Sure enough, Stanford enters the weekend up
a half-game on the second-place Sun Devils, so a
weekend sweep would seal the Card's sixth
straight regular season title. One Cardinal loss on
the weekend would allow Arizona State to play its
way into a first-place tie with a win over in-state
rival Arizona.
If, improbably, Stanford and Arizona State
each lose the remainder of their games. Washing
ton could play its way into a first-place tie with a
sweep of the Bay Area schools.
""We know we're in control of what happens,"
Newlin said. "We need to take care of business
here at home first and clinch the regular-season
title. Then we can focus our attention on the Pac
lOTournament. which will be competitive."
The Huskies, who play at Maples tonight at 7
p.m., will look to replicate what they did to Stan
ford in the first game — make the Cardinal cough
up the ball. Washington currently leads the confer
ence in steals (10.8 per game) and turnover margin
(+4.84).
But perhaps the best move the Huskies can
make is to once again force Wiggins into foul trou
ble. The sophomore guard sat for most of the
stretch run in Seattle with four fouls.
"She continues to be the go-to girl," Washing
ton head coach June Daugherty said. "I think she's
one of the special ones who don't come along real
often. For us, we try to put a lot of different people
on her, whether it's size or speed. Maybe hope for
the best, and try to give her different looks both in
personnel and style."
Stanford will close the season against Washing
ton State (8-17, 2-14) on Saturday at 2 p.m. The
Cougars have never beaten the Cardinal in 40 at
tempts, but one reason for optimism is junior for
ward Katie Benz. After back-to-back double-dou
bles in a weekend split with the Oregon schools,
the Pac-10 named Benz its Player of the Week.
The Cougars matchup brings not only title im
plications, but also the chance to send seniors
Krista Rappahahn and Shelley Nweke off from
Maples for the last time with a win.
"It's very emotional," Newlin said."We want to
win for them. I know Krista will play with a sense
of urgency, since she knows these are her last few
weekends of college basketball."
After spending her first years in the program as
a reserve, Rappahahn has made the most of her
chance to shine this season. She has been an out
side presence for the Cardinal all year, leading the
Pac-10 in three-point attempts (70), while shoot
ing 44.3 percent from downtown, good for third in
the conference.

The Card nud have the best field goal percentage in the conference, while Washington and
Washington State have the two worst. But tonight, the (lard should not underestimate
Washington, which heat Stanford in December and leads the conference in steals and
turnover margin. On Saturday, howcvei; Stanford should steam roll right past bottom
ranked Washington State.
