## Card face three ranked teams this weekend 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
After playing in the relative cold of Palo Alto
last weekend. No. 6 Stanford softball will get the
chance to soak up some sun at the Palm Springs
Classic, which kicks off tomorrow evening in
southern California.
Stanford (10-1) will try to extend its six-game
winning streak, but faces stiff competition this
weekend. Headlining Stanford's three ranked
opponents is No. 4 Texas (12-1), the only team to

have beaten Stanford this season — 2-0 two
weeks ago in Phoenix.
"The biggest thing for us with this level of
competition is, like always, that we need to worry
about ourselves and being prepared to play
every game," coach John Rittman said. "If we
play our game and we can put together all the
components — offense, defense, pitching, hit
ting, base running — we'll be okay"
The Cardinal were successful in last week
end's Stanford Invitational in all of these areas.
The offense scored 44 runs, with nine players tal

lying multiple RBI. Meanwhile, the pitching staff
threw four shutouts and allowed only five runs
on the weekend.
Sophomore rightfielder Anna Beardman,
who smashed two RBI triples against Drake on
Saturday, has a team-high .438 batting average.
Her three triples tie her for the team lead with
senior centerfielder Catalina Morris.
Morris leads the squad in hits (16), RBI (12)
and slugging percentage (.816). She shares the
homerun lead with freshman Maddy Coon, whose blast over the score
board Sunday is one of the longest in recent memory at Smith Family
Stadium.
The Cardinal have been equally smothering in the circle, where the
team sports a 1.08 ERA. Freshman Missy Penna (5-1,0.95 ERA) is av
eraging 1.22 strikeouts per inning and has thrown four complete games.
She is also hitting .333 for the season, with a homerun and eight RBI on
the season.
The team said it will need to continue its consistent play to have suc
cess against this weekends tougher opponents.
"We definitely have to bring our TV game every day," Rittman said.
"When you are playing the caliber of teams that we are playing this
weekend,our pitching has to keep us in the game and our offense needs
to continue to find the ways to score runs."
Stanford will start the tournament tonight with Texas Tech (3-B).The
Red Raiders, riding a two-game losing streak, are led by both Jennifer
Bowers, who has two homeruns in only 11 plate appearances, and Jen
nifer Corkin, who is hitting a team-high .333.
The Cardinal will then face Maryland tomorrow before the rematch
with Texas. The Terrapins are 3-2 after starting their season last week
end in Georgia. Pitcher Crystal Crews (3-0) gave up only three runs in
her 23.1 innings of work, good for a 0.77 ERA. Nikki Smith is the leader
in the batter's box with a hitting percentage of .455 and a whopping .818
slugging percentage.
Awaiting Stanford tomorrow night will be Texas and ace pitcher Cat
Osterman (7-0,0.16 ERA). Osterman two-hit the Cardinal in their last
meeting, and the Longhorns managed two late runs to take the victory.
"Obviously, whenever you face [Osterman] for the first time like we
did in Arizona, you try to gather as much information as you can and
then make adjustments from there," Rittman said. "But they have an
other pitcher, Meagan Denny, who is very good and throws very hard.
We need to be prepared to face either one. I doubt they would throw
Cat against us again, but you never know."
After Texas, the Cardinal will face University of Illinois-Chicago
and then take on two more ranked teams to close out the tournament.
UIC (1-4) got their first win of the season on Sunday over Southern
Utah. Pitcher Sarah Clynes allowed only one run in the win, and Nicole
Robinson was 2-for-3 at the plate with an RBI.
No. 18 Baylor (6-3) has scored two blowout wins this season, includ
ing a 14-0 five-inning drubbing of Texas A&M-Corpus Christi on Sat
urday. Brette Reagan leads the Bears with 13 RBI and a slugging per
centage of 1.179. She also leads the offense in batting average, doubles,
triples and homeruns. In the circle for the Bears, Sarah Hausner (2-0)
has pitched 10 scoreless innings, yielding only four hits. Lisa Ferguson
has struck out 19 batters in only 18.1 innings of work.
Stanford's last opponent of the weekend. No. 19 LSU (12-0) has
given up only two runs all season — one to Northwestern State two
weeks ago and the other to Western Kentucky last weekend. The Tigers
have scored in double digits seven times, including a 20-0 mercy-rule
win over Grambling. Lauren Castle leads the team with 16 RBI and
three homers. The Tigers' pitching staff has a combined 93 strikeouts in
73 innings and an ERA of 0.19.

Though this will he Stanford's toughest weekend yet, Rittman is
confident that his team has the potential to bring home six victories
with a complete team effort and a little bit of luck.
"Last weekend, we scored runs with the long ball and manufactured
runs with the short game and timely base hits." he said. "That's really
what it is when you get into games against top-ranked teams — whoev
er executes, whoever pitches the best and plays the best defense and
gets the timely hits is usually the team that wins."
