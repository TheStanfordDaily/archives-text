# Olympic 'teams' are joke
## 
### 
Finland. The U.S. men's hockey
team's quest for the gold — or
any Olympic medal, for that
matter — came to a crashing halt with
a loss to Finland. Let that sink in for a
minute.
Never mind that the Finns were 5-
0 before facing off against the United
States in these Olympics — far supe
rior to the 1-3-1 Americans. In hockey,
the simple fact is that the only teams
the United States can lose to in non
upset fashion are Russia and Canada.
Anything else will always seem the
equivalent of losing a basketball
match to Argentina.
Oh wait; that already happened.
If the 4-3 U.S. loss to the Finns
were an isolated event on the
Olympic landscape, it would be easi
er to let it slide. A one-time debacle.
Maybe Scandinavians believe in mir
acles, too.
But the disappointing finish seems
eerily similar to that of the 2004 Sum
mer Olympics basketball squad that
lost 89-81 in the semifinals to the
eventual world champion Argentines.
A team of NBA superstars led by the
legendary* Larry Brown couldn't get
the job done and earn the gold in the
one sport that can be said to be truly
American.
Then too, the problem was that we
brought a bunch of All-Stars to com
pete in a team sport. There was no
team chemistry, no magic — only in
dividual skills matched up against the
superior fundamentals of the compe
tition.
The answer is simple. The United
States needs to bring teams back to
team competition.
By now it should be no surprise
that many Olympic squads are
"teams" in name only. If anyone
doubted that, the Shani Davis and
Chad Hedrick mess should have put
their reservations to rest. But the mis
perception continues that, in the real
team events, there is some kind of
unity among the stars.
But if that were the case, then how
come the no-name Finns are 6-0?
To be fair, the Olympic teams from
many other nations are also made up
of a hodge-podge of talent from vari
ous franchises and leagues. But the
United States has the chance to be a
trendsetter once again, and in so
doing, it can regain a competitive ad
vantage over its competition.
If actual teams were competing in
stead of random groupings of media
darlings and guys with eye-popping
stats, it seems pretty obvious that
there would be fewer mistakes. Ath
letes wouldn't have to learn an entire
ly new system overnight in order to
compete; instead, they could stick
with the strategies that made them
champions to begin with.
Even the most casual of sports fans
know that mistake-free games are less
likely to end in upsets. And fewer up
sets would generally be a good thing
for the United States.
So why not let actual teams com
pete? Let champions compete for
gold medals.
If we had sent the Detroit Pistons
to Athens in 2004. I guarantee the
United States would have come away
with at least one more gold medal
than Bode Miller has snagged this
winter. Billups, Hamilton and the two
Wallaces are basically an All-Star
team anyway, so what have you got to
lose? If the Tampa Bay Lightning had
won the chance to take on the world,
they couldn't have come away with
any less than the All-Star approach
garnered Team USA this year.
There's no reason it shouldn't be
that simple. Have the Olympic Com
mittee sign agreements with the
major pro-leagues or the NCAA to
send the best team every four years in
a given sport to compete for their
country in the Games. Imagine that
instead of the famed exclamation,
"I'm going to Disney World!", shouts
of "I'm going to the Olympics!" would
ring across victorious locker rooms. It
would only add that much more
drama to the finals of the participat
ing sports leagues.
Of course, coaches would have to
replace foreign players with other
