### ANDREA AYALA 
Claiming wins in three events, sophomore
David Sender led the No. 4 Cardinal to a win
over No. 15 Temple on Saturday, 211.750-
198.600.
But on Sunday the Cardinal went up against
No. 6 Penn State, and despite their highest score
of the season and four team wins on individual
events, the team fell inches short, 216.800-
216.750.
"The guys did a great job and earned every
tenth of that 216.75 "said coachThom Glielmi of
the performance against Penn State."They came
together — they did not like how the first two
events went and became more determined.They
did not like the idea of Penn State winning — a
team they are clearly better than."
Stanford posted a 1 -2 finish on the floor exer
cise. Sophomore Sho Nakamori tallied a 9.4(H)
for first place in the event, followed by junior
Dylan Carney with a 9.350.
Junior Alex Schorsch led the Cardinal on the
still rings with a season-best 9.7(H) and an individ
ual win on the event.
Sophomore David Sender tallied a 9.500 on

Penn State's Santiago Lopez with a 9.3(H) and
sophomore Jason Shen with a 9.250.
Sender tallied an all-around score of 52.050
for the evening, finishing in second place behind
Penn State's Derek Hellsby who posted a 53.500.
"This was our best meet of the season so far in
terms of hitting our routines." Schorsch said.
"The team showed determination and focus by
not letting a couple of missed routines cause a
downward spiral. Whenever somebody had a
rough routine the next guy up only
performed that much better. Every
body had their teammates' backs
and that's what it means to be a
team."
Against Temple on Saturday,
Stanford posted team wins on the
floor exercise, rings, vault, parallel
bars and high bar. Sender took first

season-best 9.600 en route to a 1-2-
3-4 finish on the high bar.
"I don't think that this win came

as a surprise to me or any of my
teammates," Schorsch said. "We all
knew that we had put in the effort
during practice, and that we were
capable of getting a huge score. Our
focus was not on winning the meet
so much as hitting our routines and
performing our best. If we did that,
then there was no doubt that we
would win."
Freshman Bryant Madden was
injured during warm-ups, causing
Stanford to rearrange the usual
lineup. Junior Josh Goldman com
peted on still rings and Shen com
peted in all six events on Saturday.
Shen came in second place behind
Sender with an all-around score of

"We have yet to have the 'perfect
meet' but besides that, the goal

"Some routines have more difficul
ty and require more time to make
consistent."
