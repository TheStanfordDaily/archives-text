# WOMEN'S GOLF
## Card perform well in Tucson 
### CARSON COOPER 
For the second straight week, the
Stanford women's golf team looked
to impress in a Pac-10-heavy field.
And for the second straight week, the
No. 14 Card turned in what they felt
was solid performance.

The Cardinal finished 13th overall
in the 18-team Arizona Wildcat Invi
tational in llicson, Ariz. The tourna
ment included 15 of the top 25 teams
in the nation, as well as several of the
top-ranked individuals.
The No. 1 Blue Devils, led by star
Amanda Blumenherst. highlighted

the field. Also competing against
Stanford for the second-straight week
were UCLA, Washington and Cali
fornia.
Arizona State took the team tro
phy, a week after winning the
Northrup Grumman Regional Chal
lenge. The Sun Devils finished an im
pressive 12-under 840 for the tourna
ment. The win is expected to vault the
team to the No. 1 ranking.
The Card finished with 885
strokes, for a 33-over par finish. The
team was without standout freshman
Mari Chun, who was participating in a
tournament in Hawaii.
Taking the individual title in the
tournament was Jacqui Concolino of
Vanderbilt. The freshman finished
with a 9-under 204, including a school
record 66 in the final round on Tues
day.
"I knew 1 was ready to play well,"
Concolino said, "but I didn't know it
would be quite this good."
California's Sophia Sheridan
placed second, just one stroke behind
Concolino.
The tournament was somewhat of
a homecoming for junior Lauren
Todd, who hails from nearby Phoenix.
"Lauren is an Arizona native so
she is very comfortable and confident
playing desert courses and putting on
Bermuda greens," coach Caroline
O'Connor said. "Her ball striking was
exceptional, and her short-putt con
versions almost perfect."
Todd capitalized on her familiarity
with the course, finishing in a tie for
17th place after carding a l-over 214.
Stanford's Jennifer Tangtiphai
boontana, a junior, finished five
strokes behind Todd, tying for 34th.
Senior Kelly Husted took 37th with
a 220, while senior Stephanie Lue
finished 70th with a 232. Freshman
Ki-Shui Liao finished 94th with a
253.
In last year's Wildcat Invitation
al, Todd, Tangtiphaiboontana and
Husted tied for 20th at 10-over par.
The Cardinal return to action
March 6-8 in Guadalajara, Mexico for
the Cal-Guadalajara Invitational.
"We're close," O'Connor said.
"We will have some heavily intensive
short game practices prior to depart
ing because, again, we just weren't as
sharp as we need to be."
