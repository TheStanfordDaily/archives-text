## Ambassador sees change in Middle East The 						process of change will, I believe, have an effect throughout the region. But give it time. You can't do it for them. And you can't do it on your own time frame. NABIL FAHMY, Egyptian Ambassador to U.S.

Egyptian Ambassador Nabil Fahmy addressed
Stanford students and faculty Tuesday at the Bech
tel Conference Center. In his lecture, titled "Op
portunities and Predicaments in the Middle East,"
the internationally-recognized career diplomat
discussed his experiences serving as ambassador
to the United States since 1999, and commented
on the role of the United States within a set of in
ternational efforts to see a peaceful Middle East in
the near future.
According to Fahmy, Egypt is entering a time of
change. Demographics alone indicate develop
ment on the horizon; over 50 percent of the coun
try's population is under the age of 25.
With a rising population that Fahmy charac
terizes as a more "impatient population," and an
Egyptian history established on a social —
rather than political — agenda,the ambassador
discussed Egypt's international role with respect
to the current cultural transformation taking
place.
Fahmy said he saw many effects of Egyptian
society's new mindset, specifically, in the area of
political change. Recent elections indicated that
only 23 percent of the population went out to
vote. While turnout for Parliamentary Elections
ultimately remained low compared to most es
tablished democratic countries, participation in
elections was done so in the face of violence in 20-
25 voting stations, and in spite of large religious
opposition.
"This showed a very strong commitment to
change, Fahmy said. "It's time that Egyptians chal
lenge authority, [however] this is a process that is
ongoing, it will take time."
While Fahmy is positive towards a changing

Egyptian culture, he specified the need for Middle
Eastern countries to move down their own path —
and not necessarily a path of Western change. Fur
thermore, the Egyptian model can not be used to
foresee developments in other areas of the Middle
East such as Iraq, he said.
"What I will not accept is that you can do it for
us. We need to make our own mistakes and learn
from the experiences ourselves," Fahmy said.
Despite this unique time in Egyptian society,
Fahmy said he believed events that take place in
side its borders would have international implica
tions.
"The process of change will, I believe, have an
effect throughout the region," he told the audi
ence. "But give it time. You can't do it for them.
And you can't do it on your time frame."
In his lecture, Fahmy also addressed the role of
the United States in efforts to promote peace in
the Middle East. While he recognized U.S. concern
for Egypt's future as an Arab country amongst a
historically violent region, he did not support the

current Administration's belief that democracy is
the solution to terrorism
"I understand America's concern," he said. "I
don't accept that you need democracy in the mid
dle to defend against terrorism."
Fahmy noted that in certain circumstances,
democracy does not provide the outcome hoped
for — as occurred most recently in the Hamas
elections.
"Nobody has questioned that it was a free and
fair election," Fahmy said. "So you didn't like the
results? I didn't like it either, but it's a democratic
election and reflects a desire for change among
many Palestinians."
Fahmy concluded with his belief in the need
for the pursuit of peace through non-violent
means, a commitment to the peace process and a
respect for a multi-ethnic people during a post
elections era.
"It should be about closing the book on this
issue," he said in regards to the continuing Arab-
Israeli conflict.
