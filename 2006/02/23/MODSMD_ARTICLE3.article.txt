For junior center Brooke Smith
and the rest of the Cardinal, this has
been a difficult season in a revitalized
Pac-10 conference. Smith has person
ally performed very well, averaging
16.8 points per game and leading the
team in rebounds with an average of
7.3 per game. She also had a career
high 26 points and 17 rebounds on the
road against UCLA. But the Cardinal
still wound up with a disappointing 90-
80 loss to the Bruins. The team
bounced back with a win over South
ern California, but the weekend-split
trend continued this past weekend on
the road against the Arizona schools.
This pattern has challenged the team's
motivation, especially nearing the end
of the season.
In a phone interview yesterday,The
Stanford Daily's Christian Torres
spoke with Smith about the team's
progression, challenges and prospects
as it nears the end of its regular season.
The Stanford Daily: At the beginning
of the season, you said the team was
just scratching the surface. Now that

you're nearing the end of this season
and looking back, how have you seen
the team dig deep and improve to
where it is now?
Brooke Smith: I think the team's real
ly come together over the course of
the season. Lots of people stepped up
and really improved their game. Jillian
has done a great job for us. 1 think Roz
has improved a lot at point guard for
us. Krista's obviously a really great
shooter and 1 think Clare's playing a
lot better. I think I've seen us gel a lot
more as a team, and a lot of people
have stepped up more and have been
making bigger contributions for us,
which is great.
SD: How have you seen yourself im
prove?
BS: I'm actually still working on my
defense, my rebounding, stuff like that,
and I'm really working on my tough
ness — those are areas that I'm really
trying to improve.
SD: You mentioned toughness. Ag
gression has been a problem for the
team in general this season, both with
individual games starting slowly and
having to bounce back on the road
after losses like UCLA and ASU.
How important right now is fixing that as you
near the post-season?
BS:I think right now it's really important for us
to gain momentum going into the [Pac-10]
Tournament.The Washington and Washington
State games are really important for us to start
playing our best basketball and get on a roll for
the Pac-lOTournament and on into the NCAA
Tournament. That's our biggest focus right
now, and I think that'll help us be the most suc
cessful in the tournament.
SI): Going back to those difficult games that
you bounced back from, like UCLA and ASU,
what have you and the team focused on in
those ups and downs?
BS: I think we learned a lot from both of those
games. Both teams play really hard and know
what it takes to win. I think you have to learn
from losses — you can't let them beat you, so
we really tried to take as much as we could

from those games. Hopefully, it'll help down
the road.
SI): Is there anything in particular you took
from those games?
BS: Mostly just needing to be tougher and re
ally staying with things — that's probably
what I learned the most.
SD: So what are you thinking now, heading
into the last two games of the season with
the Pac-10 Tournament just around the cor
ner?
BS: I'm excited about these next two games.
Senior week is coming up, so it'll be good for
Krista and Shelley in their last games at home.
We're really just trying to build momentum
and gain confidence going into the tourna
ment, so that we'll be playing well.
SI): At the beginning of the season, you were
hoping to get the Pac-10 title again. How do
you feel about the possibility of that now?
BS: Right now it's in our hands. We just have to
take care of business and win the next two
games. We're excited to play Washington
again, since they beat us and will be a chal
lenge. But we know that the Pac-10 title is ours
to win.
