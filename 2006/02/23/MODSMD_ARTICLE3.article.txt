For junior center Brooke Smith
and the rest of the Cardinal, this has
been a difficult season in a revitalized
Pac-10 conference. Smith has person
ally performed very well, averaging
16.8 points per game and leading the
team in rebounds with an average of
7.3 per game. She also had a career
high 26 points and 17 rebounds on the
road against UCLA. But the Cardinal
still wound up with a disappointing 90-
80 loss to the Bruins. The team
bounced back with a win over South
ern California, but the weekend-split
trend continued this past weekend on
the road against the Arizona schools.
This pattern has challenged the team's
motivation, especially nearing the end
of the season.
In a phone interview yesterday,The
Stanford Daily's Christian Torres
spoke with Smith about the team's
progression, challenges and prospects
as it nears the end of its regular season.
The Stanford Daily: At the beginning
of the season, you said the team was
just scratching the surface. Now that

you're nearing the end of this season
and looking back, how have you seen
the team dig deep and improve to
where it is now?
Brooke Smith: I think the team's real
ly come together over the course of
the season. Lots of people stepped up
and really improved their game. Jillian
has done a great job for us. 1 think Roz
has improved a lot at point guard for
us. Krista's obviously a really great
shooter and 1 think Clare's playing a
lot better. I think I've seen us gel a lot
more as a team, and a lot of people
have stepped up more and have been
making bigger contributions for us,
which is great.
SD: How have you seen yourself im
prove?
BS: I'm actually still working on my
defense, my rebounding, stuff like that,
and I'm really working on my tough
ness — those are areas that I'm really
trying to improve.
SD: You mentioned toughness. Ag
gression has been a problem for the
team in general this season, both with
individual games starting slowly and
having to bounce back on the road
after losses like UCLA and ASU.
