Pac-10 Tournament in Los Angeles or miss the
NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1994.
One bright note for the Card is that No. 19
UCLA (20-6,10-4) and Cal (16-7,10-4), the top
two teams in the league, lost on Sunday to un
heralded USC (16-9,7-7) and Arizona State (10-

Stanford needs just one Cal loss to control its

Senior guard Chris Hernandez, who is one of three team members averaging double-digit scores this
season, hopes the team will repeat last month's win over Washington tonight.
our capabilities."
One reason for the tough sledding is lack of offen
sive depth. Haryasz and senior guards Chris Hernan
dez and Dan Grunfeld each average in double fig
ures, but after those three, no player on the roster av
erages more than 5.2 points per game.
As a result. Coach Johnson said opponents have
started to play "five feet off' Stanford's other top
players — freshman guard Mitch Johnson, sopho
more forward Taj Finger and sophomore guard Tim
Morris — allowing them to double-team Hernandez
and Haryasz especially. Coach Johnson added that
the trio of Mitch Johnson, Finger and Morris, cur
rently combining to average just 14 points per game,
needs to start hitting the open looks that opponents
are providing.
"1 expect to see the same type of game plan
against Washington," Coach Johnson said. "Mitch,
knock down those shots. Tim, knock down those
shots."
Mitch Johnson, returning to his hometown of
Seattle tonight, realized the scoring burden that rests
on his shoulders.
"Especially in my case, because 1 am the point
guard and have the ball a lot, [1] have to hit the open
shot," said Johnson, who missed all five of his shots in
Sunday's 76-72 loss to Arizona (16-10,9-6). "Every
one has watched teams sag off me, so I need to do a
better job of being aggressive and getting into the
lane. 1 don't think it's always shooting, but at least
being aggressive, going to the hole, shot-faking,
things like that."
On the whole though, Coach Johnson said he was
generally pleased with his team's offensive efforts.
"If we can get the same shots we got against Ari
zona— on the road — God, I'll take my chances,"

Johnson said. "The last three times out, we probably
played as good offensively as we have all year. The
only thing we've got to do is take care of the ball bet
ter. We're not explosive, deep or talented enough to
play from behind against that kind of quickness [of
Arizona or Washington]."
Senior guard Brandon Roy paces No. 17 Wash
ington (20-5,9-5) with nearly 20 points per game, and
senior forwards Jamaal Williams and Bobby Jones
also average in double figures.
Freshman forward Jon Brockman (nine points,
seven rebounds per game) has been a pleasant sur
prise for the Huskies, who are known for playing an
up-tempo pace and trying to wear down opponents
with their quickness. They lead the conference with
83.6 points per game.
However, Haryasz (6'11"), Finger (6'8") and re
serve posts Lawrence Hill (6'B",freshman) and Peter
Prowitt (6'10", sophomore) will all enjoy a size ad
vantage over the Huskies, whose tallest starter is just
6'7". Perhaps size is one reason they allow a league
worst 69.9 points per game.
In contrast with the Huskies, Washington State
(11-12,4-10) tries to slow down games and win with
coach Dick Bennett's defense. The team leads the
conference with just 58 points allowed per game.
But the Cougars' offense is just as abysmal as their
defense is sound. They average a league-worst 60
points per game, and have failed to top that mark in
all but one of their last nine contests — most notably
in a 50-30 loss to UCLA on Feb. 9. Sophomore guard
John Akognon (11 points per game) is the only
Cougar to average in double figures.
At Maples in January, Stanford downed Wash
ington 76-67 in overtime and Washington State
69-59.

one has watched teams sag off me, so I need to do a
better job of being aggressive and getting into the
lane. 1 don't think it's always shooting, but at least
being aggressive, going to the hole, shot-faking,
things like that."
On the whole though, Coach Johnson said he was
generally pleased with his team's offensive efforts.
"If we can get the same shots we got against Ari
zona— on the road — God, I'll take my chances,"

Johnson said. "The last three times out, we probably
played as good offensively as we have all year. The
only thing we've got to do is take care of the ball bet
ter. We're not explosive, deep or talented enough to
play from behind against that kind of quickness [of
Arizona or Washington]."
Senior guard Brandon Roy paces No. 17 Wash
ington (20-5,9-5) with nearly 20 points per game, and
senior forwards Jamaal Williams and Bobby Jones
also average in double figures.
Freshman forward Jon Brockman (nine points,
seven rebounds per game) has been a pleasant sur
prise for the Huskies, who are known for playing an
up-tempo pace and trying to wear down opponents
with their quickness. They lead the conference with
83.6 points per game.
However, Haryasz (6'11"), Finger (6'8") and re
serve posts Lawrence Hill (6'B",freshman) and Peter
Prowitt (6'10", sophomore) will all enjoy a size ad
vantage over the Huskies, whose tallest starter is just
6'7". Perhaps size is one reason they allow a league
worst 69.9 points per game.
In contrast with the Huskies, Washington State
(11-12,4-10) tries to slow down games and win with
coach Dick Bennett's defense. The team leads the
conference with just 58 points allowed per game.
But the Cougars' offense is just as abysmal as their
defense is sound. They average a league-worst 60
points per game, and have failed to top that mark in
all but one of their last nine contests — most notably
in a 50-30 loss to UCLA on Feb. 9. Sophomore guard
John Akognon (11 points per game) is the only
Cougar to average in double figures.
At Maples in January, Stanford downed Wash
