# Adjusting to college life, basketball
## Starting point guard Mitch Johnson looks to his father, Hernandez for advice and support 
### SEAN HOWELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Men's basketball head coach TYent Johnson
often asserts that the transition from high school
to college is more difficult academically and so
cially than it is on the basketball court. He has a
point â€” being a freshman at Stanford is not easy.
You have to figure out how to navigate your way
through esoteric I HUM papers, how to feel com
fortable walking around the dorm in a towel and
how to detect (or avoid) that certain someone at
a frat party.
On top of all those challenges, freshman Mitch

Johnson, the starting point guard on the men's
basketball team, has been forced to follow a steep
basketball learning curve. He has figured out how
to run the offense and distribute the ball, stay
calm in big game situations (as he did last week
end against Arizona) and chase players like Bran
don Roy, the Pac-10's second-leading scorer,
around the court.
Tonight, that last task will face Johnson for the
second time this season when the Cardinal visit
Washington, the team that he grew up following.
Like most aspects of his game. Johnson is ap
proaching the task with a reasoned outlook.
"Roy is so skilled, he can do so many things,"

Johnson said." You try to play as tough on defense
as you can, hut he is still going to hit shots and
make plays. He's going to get his to a certain ex
tent. and you have to know that coming in."
Johnson's game rests on moderation and me
diation, a fact that has allowed him to provide an
unexpected calming influence in a turbulent sea
son in which the Cardinal are struggling for their
NCAA Tournament lives.
The newcomer from O'Dea High School in
Seattle has seen increased playing time as the sea
son has progressed. He took the point guard reins
from veteran guard Chris Hernandez eight
games into the season, allowing Hernandez to
swing over to the shooting guard position where
he can rest his legs so that he'll he fresh late in
games. The strategy seems to have paid off, con
sidering Hernandez's late-game performances
of late.
Because the team has not relied on Johnson
to provide as much of a scoring punch as he did
in high school (he scored 22 points per game in
his senior season), he has focused instead on dis
tributing the ball to teammates and setting the
rhythm of the offense.
"I try to bring the ball up under control,"
Johnson said. "If you bring it up and you're
going 100 miles per hour into that possession,
your team might not be as poised and ready to
execute the plays."
At times, Johnson's concentration on han

dling the ball against the likes of Roy and some
of the Pac-10's other tenacious defenders has
been a detriment to his shooting. The lefty has
hit only 34 percent of his field goals on the sea
son, and missed all five of his shots against Ari
zona last Sunday. He averages almost as many
assists (3.7 per game) as points (3.9). but John
son realizes that eventually, he will have to start
looking for his shot more often.
"I think sometimes 1 have caught myself see
ing Matt [Haryasz] down low, Chris and Danny
[Grunfeld] on the wing, and I'm trying to get him
a shot, him a shot and him a shot every single
time down. But the defense is five feet off me.
wanting me to shoot. When you have the men
tality of looking to pass, and then, it's my turn to
shoot," the shot's not as fluid. So I think 1 need to
get back to that mentality of just playing basket
ball, not thinking so much."

There is, of course, a lot to think about. The
transition to the college game can be over
whelming at times, but Johnson has had plenty
of help from Hernandez. Johnson describes
him as a security blanket, saying that he tries to
pick the fifth-year senior's brain as often as he
can.
Hernandez is effusive when it comes to John
son, calling him "very mature for his age." The
freshman gets a different kind of support from
his father John, who played small forward for
four teams, including the Seattle Sonics, over a
12-year NBA career.
"He never pressured me into playing basket
ball, but when I ask for advice he's very candid,"
Johnson said. "He doesn't sugar-coat anything,
which is not always what I want to hear, though
it's probably for the best."
Perhaps Johnson gets his level-headed ap

proach to the game from his father. But even
with his seasoned outlook, he doesn't think that
Trent Johnson's assertion applies to him.
"1 would say that the transition to college
basketball is harder than the transition to col
lege life, because in school, everybody is trying
to help you. In basketball, there are five guys on
the other team trying to embarrass you."
Johnson's steady approach has allowed him
to avoid this fate. Though he was held scoreless
last weekend, he still managed to dish out 10 as
sists while turning the ball over only three times.
He will be playing in front of friends and fam
ily today, in the gym where he was first intro
duced to college basketball. But the chance that
Johnson will get flustered tonight is about the
same as the chance that he will hold Roy score
less.
Very unlikely.
