## Shrine destroyed by phony police 
### ZIAD KHALAF ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SAMARRA, Iraq (AP) — Insur
gents posing as police destroyed the
golden dome of one of Iraq's holiest
Shiite shrines yesterday, setting off an
unprecendented spasm of sectarian
violence. Angry crowds thronged the
streets, militiamen attacked Sunni
mosques, and at least 19 people were
killed.
With the gleaming dome of the
1.200-year-old Askariya shrine re
duced to rubble, some Shiites lashed
out at the United States as partly to
blame.
The violence — many of the 90 at
tacks on Sunni mosques were carried
out by Shiite militias — seemed to
push Iraq closer to all-out civil war
than at any point in the three years
since the US.-led overthrow of Sad
dam Hussein.
Many leaders called for calm. "We
are facing a major conspiracy that is
targeting Iraq's unity," said President
Jalal Talabani. a Kurd. "We should all
stand hand in hand to prevent the
danger of a civil war."
President Bush pledged American
help to restore the mosque after the
bombing north of Baghdad, which
dealt a severe blow to U.S. efforts to
keep Iraq from falling deeper into
sectarian violence.
"The terrorists in Iraq have again
proven that they are enemies of all
faiths and of all humanity," Bush said.
"The world must stand united against
them, and steadfast behind the people
of Iraq."
British Prime Minister Tony Blair
also condemned the bombing and
pledged funds toward the shrine's re

construction.
U.S. Ambassador Zalmay
Khalilzad and the top American com
mander in Iraq. Gen. George Casey,
called the attack a deliberate attempt
to foment sectarian strife and warned
it was a "critical moment for Iraq."
No one was reported injured in the
bombing of the shrine in Samarra.
But at least 19 people, including
three Sunni clerics, were killed in the
reprisal attacks that followed, mainly
in Baghdad and predominantly Shiite
provinces to the south, according to
the Iraqi Islamic Party, the country's
largest Sunni political group.
Many of the attacks appeared to have
been carried out by Shiite militias that
the United States wants to see dis
banded.
In predominantly Shiite Basra, po
lice said militiamen broke into a
prison, hauled out 12 inmates, includ
ing two Egyptians, two Tunisians, a
Libyan, a Saudi and a Turk, and shot
them dead in reprisal for the shrine
attack.
Major Sunni groups joined in con
demning the attack, and a leading
Sunni politician. Tariq al-Hashimi.
urged clerics and politicians to calm
the situation "before it spins out of
control."
The country's top Shiite cleric.
Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, sent
instructions to his followers forbid
ding attacks on Sunni mosques, and
called for seven days of mourning.
But he hinted, as did Vice Presi
dent Adil Abdul-Mahdi, that reli
gious militias could be given a bigger
security role if the government can
not protecting holy shrines — an
ominous sign of the Shiite reaction
ahead.

Both Sunnis and the United States
fear the rise of such militias, which the
disaffected minority views as little
more than death squads. American
commanders believe they undercut
efforts to create a professional Iraqi
army and police force — a key step
toward the eventual drawdown of
U.S. forces.
Some Shiite political leaders al
ready were angry with the United
States because it has urged them to
form a government in which nonsec
tarian figures control the army and
police. Khalilzad warned this week —
in a statement clearly aimed at Shiite
hard-liners — that America would
not continue to support institutions
run by sectarian groups with links to
armed militias.
One top Shiite political leader ac
cused Khalilzad of sharing blame for

the attack on the shrine in Samarra.
"These statements ... gave green
lights to terrorist groups. And, there
fore, he shares in part of the responsi
bility," said Abdul-Aziz al-Hakim,
head of the Supreme Council for the
Islamic Revolution in Iraq and the
former commander of its militia.
The interior minister, who controls
the security forces that Sunnis accuse
of widepsread abuses, is a member of
al-Hakim's party.
The new tensions came as Iraq's
various factions have been struggling
to assemble a government after the
Dec. 15 parliamentary elections.
The Shiite fury sparked by
Wednesday's bombings — the third
major attack against Shiite targets in
as many days — raised the likelihood
that Shiite religious parties will reject
U.S. demands to curb militias.

ding attacks on Sunni mosques, and
called for seven days of mourning.
But he hinted, as did Vice Presi
dent Adil Abdul-Mahdi, that reli
gious militias could be given a bigger
security role if the government can
not protecting holy shrines — an
ominous sign of the Shiite reaction
ahead.

Both Sunnis and the United States
fear the rise of such militias, which the
disaffected minority views as little
more than death squads. American
commanders believe they undercut
efforts to create a professional Iraqi
army and police force — a key step
toward the eventual drawdown of
U.S. forces.
Some Shiite political leaders al
ready were angry with the United
States because it has urged them to
form a government in which nonsec
tarian figures control the army and
police. Khalilzad warned this week —
in a statement clearly aimed at Shiite
hard-liners — that America would
not continue to support institutions
run by sectarian groups with links to
armed militias.
One top Shiite political leader ac
cused Khalilzad of sharing blame for

the attack on the shrine in Samarra.
"These statements ... gave green
lights to terrorist groups. And, there
fore, he shares in part of the responsi
bility," said Abdul-Aziz al-Hakim,
head of the Supreme Council for the
Islamic Revolution in Iraq and the
former commander of its militia.
The interior minister, who controls
the security forces that Sunnis accuse
of widepsread abuses, is a member of
al-Hakim's party.
The new tensions came as Iraq's
various factions have been struggling
to assemble a government after the
Dec. 15 parliamentary elections.
The Shiite fury sparked by
Wednesday's bombings — the third
major attack against Shiite targets in
as many days — raised the likelihood
that Shiite religious parties will reject
U.S. demands to curb militias.
