# U.S. requires Arab company to agree to investigations
## 
### TED BRIDIS ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON (AP) —The
Bush administration secretly re
quired a company in the United
Arab Emirates to cooperate with
future US. investigations before
approving its takeover of opera
tions at six American ports, ac
cording to documents obtained by
The Associated Press. It chose not
to impose other, routine restric
tions.
As part of the $6.8 billion pur
chase, state-owned Dubai Ports
World agreed to reveal records on
demand about "foreign operational
direction" of its business at U.S.
ports, the documents said. Those
records broadly include details
about the design, maintenance or
operation of ports and equipment.
The administration did not re
quire Dubai Ports to keep copies
of business records on U.S. soil,
where they would be subject to
court orders. It also did not require
the company to designate an
American citizen to accommodate
U.S. government requests. Outside
legal experts said such obligations

are routinely attached to U.S. ap
provals of foreign sales in other in
dustries.
"They're not lax but they're not
draconian," said James Lewis, a for
mer U.S. official who worked on
such agreements. If officials had
predicted the firestorm of criticism
over the deal, Lewis said, "they
might have made them sound hard
er."
The conditions involving the sale
of London-based Peninsular and
Oriental Steam Navigation Co.
were detailed in U.S. documents
marked "confidential." Such
records are regularly guarded as
trade secrets, and it is highly unusu
al for them to be made public.
The concessions — described
previously by the Homeland Secu
rity Department as unprecedented
among maritime companies — re
flect the close relationship between
the United States and the United
Arab Emirates.
The revelations about the nego
tiated conditions came as the White
House acknowledged President
Bush was unaware of the pending
sale until the deal had already been
approved by his administration.
