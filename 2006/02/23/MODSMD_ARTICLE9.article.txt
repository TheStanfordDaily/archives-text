### ADAM WIDMAN STAFF WRITER 
Five Stanford students and three
recent Stanford graduates received $
Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowships
for New Americans this year.
The fellowship, funded by a $50
million grant from the Hungarian
immigrants for which it was named,
was established in 1997 and is award
ed annually to naturalized citizens,
resident aliens or the children of nat
uralized citizens studying in the
United States. Thirty students across
the country are selected for fellow
ships each year.
This year's honorees at Stanford
include senior Albert Chang — the
only Stanford undergraduate recipi
ent — as well as medical students
Achal Achrol, Gabriel Brat, Dora
Castaneda and Yashar Kalani. Stan
ford graduates Elizabeth Kwo,
Theodore Marentis and Vipin
Narang were also named winners.
"These candidates truly exempli
fy the kind of creative, multitalented
and extraordinarily accomplished
New American that Paul and Daisy
Soros want to honor and support
through this program," said Warren
F. Ilchman, director of the fellowship
program, in a press release.
This year, the 30 students were se
lected out of a pool of nearly 800. Ac
cording to a press release from the
organization, Soros fellows receive
the $20,000 stipend and half of their
graduate school tuitions for up to
two years.
Achrol, who is from the state of
Rajasthan in Northern India, ex
pressed his appreciation for the fel
lowship program.
"It is a huge honor and privilege,"
he said. "There is definitely this sense
of relief, because a lot of us in medi-

cine just stare at this giant mountain
of debt that we create for ourselves
in this pursuit, and it can be rather
daunting. So in that sense [the fel
lowship] definitely opens doors for
you."
He added that the fellowship in
cludes benefits beyond financial
compensation, including the oppor
tunity to meet influential people in a
variety of academic fields.
"By virtue of the other fellows,
[the fellowship] also carries with it a
certain amount of prestige," Achrol
added. "The conferences and local
meetings facilitate networking with
other influential key opinion leaders
in various fields."
Marentis, now a student at Har
vard Medical School, agreed, adding
that communication with the other
fellows could lead to valuable learn
ing experiences.
"It is an honor to join an amazing
group of talented people," he said.
"The fellowship presents a number
of opportunities to interact with the
other fellows, learn from them and
develop. Many of the fellows are ex
celling in fields vastly different than
your own, which provides a refresh
ing opportunity to realize how little
you know.(The fellowship helps you]
learn and maintain a sense of bal
ance."
Marentis, who hails from Greece,
received his bachelor's in biome
chanical engineering and master's in
electrical engineering while at Stan
ford.
Kwo, a Taiwanese student at Har
vard Medical School, received her
bachelor's in human biology from
Stanford in 2004. She said the fellow
ship will provide her the opportunity
to meet extraordinary new people.
"The fellows all have such amaz
ing backgrounds and interesting sto
ries to tell," she said.

later moved to Canada, earned his doctorate in
chemistry from the California Institute ofTechnol
ogy before coming to Stanford Medical School. He
plans to pursue a career as an academic physician.
"['llie Soros fellowship] is a great honor and I am
very happy," he said. "My parents and family are
very proud, and I feel especially happy to have been
able to recognize their sacrifice by getting this
award."
Chang, whose parents are of Taiwanese and Chi
nese descent, said he will use his award help pay for
law school.
"I know how lucky I was to receive the fellow
ship [as an undergraduate]," he said."l could never
have predicted this outcome, but because I know
how fortunate I am to be in this position, this is
something that 1 will always treasure and remem
ber."
Castaneda is the daughter of Mexican immi
grants, while Brat is the son of Argentineans.
Narang. whose parents are of Indian descent, re
ceived his bachelor's and master's in Chemical En
gineering from Stanford in 2002. He is currently a
doctoral student at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government.
Applications for the 2007 Soros fellowships will
be available this spring, and will be due on Nov. 1.
