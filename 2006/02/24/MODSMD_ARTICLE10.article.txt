## 
### MARK SHERMAN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON (AP) — FBI agents repeatedly
warned military interrogators at the U.S. prison camp at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, that their aggressive methods
were legally risky and also likely to be ineffective, ac
cording to FBI memos made public yesterday.
A senior officer at the prison for terror suspects also
"blatantly misled" his superiors at the Pentagon into
thinking the FBI had endorsed the "aggressive and con
troversial interrogation plan" for one detainee, accord
ing to one of the 54 memos released by the American
Civil Liberties Union.
The memos had been previously released, but in
more heavily censored form, as part of an ACLU law
suit under the federal Freedom of Information Act.
FBI officials, whose names were blacked out, indicat
ed that senior military officials, including former
Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, were aware
of and in some cases had approved of putting hoods on
prisoners, threatening them with violence and subject
ing them to humiliating treatment.
Wolfowitz is now president of the World Bank. Kevin
Kellems, a spokesman for the World Bank, said Thurs
day,"This old story is fictional and is authored by anony
mous people who have no real knowledge of what his
role was."
Agents on temporary assignment at the U.S. Navy fa
cility in Cuba brought their concerns to the prison's
commander, Maj. Gen. Geoffrey Miller, and laid them
out in detailed messages to top bureau officials at FBI
headquarters in Washington.
One memo from May 2003 describes tension be
tween the FBI agents and their military counterparts
over "aggressive interrogation tactics in GTMO which
are of questionable effectiveness and subject to uncer
tain interpretation based on law and regulation."
In other e-mails, some FBI officials said that while
the techniques they observed were too aggressive by the
FBl's standards, the interrogations were not abusive.
A military investigation into FBI reports of prisoner
abuse at Guantanamo recommended that Miller be
reprimanded for failing to oversee the interrogation of
a high-value detainee, which was found to have been
abusive.
