Compadres Mexican Bar and Grill re
minds me of Disneyland — but with
much better food. Its pleasant, detailed
decor creates an enchanting ambiance sug
gesting the Mexico of the American imagina
tion, only less authentic because you sense it's
all for a show. Compadres is not the dirt-cheap
yet surprisingly clean hole-in-the-wall restau
rant that 1 prefer when it comes to Mexican
food, so I may be biased.
Don't get me wrong, Compadres is very
good for what it is — a more upscale, chain-like
Mexican restaurant that dishes out generous
portions of food that — like the decor — is of
high quality but un-inspiringly generic. It's es
sentially the Mexican restaurant version of The
Cheesecake Factory.
From the mural-painted walls and attractive
outdoor patio complete with wood-burning
stove, Compadres offers an environment that's
conducive to a festive mood. For that reason,
Compadres is a popular place for families. If
you've been on campus too long, you may have
forgotten that there are people in this world
under than 17 years old. It may have just been
the night I visited, but every group seated di
rectly around my table included at least one
youngster under the age of five.
As for the food, the guacamole ($5.95) I or
dered for an appetizer prefaced the quality of
the rest of the meal. It was good but not great.
The vegetarian taco salad ($9.95), which is basi
cally a large mound of lettuce, guacamole and
red cabbage on top of a tostada covered with
black beans, had a tasty but unexciting dressing.
The salad could have been more of a meal if it
had included tomatoes, carrots and jicima.
At $8.95, the enchiladas offer the best bang
for your buck. Served with rice, beans and salad,
they tasted good but were a little too mild and
bland for my taste. None of the flavors seemed
very complex.
The absolutely gigantic chimichanga
($10.95) also comes with rice, beans and a
salad. It's generally satisfying but lacks that lit
tle extra something that will make you crave it
a week later.
As you may have noticed, Compadres'
prices are a little steeper than you might ex
pect. However, bringing your Stanford ID
will get you a generous 25 percent discount!
And the reasonably priced Banana Chin
galinga ($3.50), a desert made of fried ba
nanas with vanilla ice cream and strawberry
sauce, is delicious.
Slow and inattentive service dampened my
dining experience, so don't come if you're in a
hurry, and be prepared to have patience while
waiting for your meal and check.
Overall. I wouldn't rush back to Compadres.
But, if you do wind up eating there, you're like
ly to have an enjoyable meal, even if it doesn't
wow vou.
