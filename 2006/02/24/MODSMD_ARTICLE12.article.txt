relaying student's mu
sical preferences to the
world, there exists no
truer way of demon
strating diehard musi
cal love than seeing a
band live. In a world
where artists abound
and access to different
genres is more open
than ever before, mu
sical taste has become
an important indicator
of personality; the
concert experience
combines this expres
sion with a sense of
adventure.
Ranging from large
outdoor performance
areas to smaller, more
intimate clubs, the con
cert venues located
near campus reflect the
diverse range of musi
cians that frequent the
area. In this article,
The Daily explores four
such venues, each of
which boasts traits
unique to its musical
and cultural offerings.

Located in Mountain View, Shoreline is a massive outdoor venue, laud
ed as "the cadillac of amphitheatres" by The Wall Street Journal. Fre
quented by more than 450,(MX) concertgoers every year, it hosts large
scale performances from artists like the Dave Matthews Band, Ra
diohead. Coldplay, James Taylor, Alan Jackson and Neil Young. Its
state-of-the-art sound and video systems allow it to accommodate as many as
25,(MX); both the size of the crowd and the artists that Shoreline attracts cast it
as a very traditional, more mainstream, concert experience. Located only 15
minutes away from Stanford, the Amphitheatre is an attractive option for stu
dents who don't want to trek into San Francisco, and who don't mind a strict
ly impersonal concert experience.

Home to the annual Grand National Rodeo, Horse and Stock Show.
San Francisco's Cow Palace is not exclusively a concert venue,
though in years past it has hosted performances by musical legends
like the Grateful Dead, the Rolling Stones and the Beatles. The
2(X)6 schedule includes performances by Disney on Ice, the Barnum
and Bailey Circus and the Golden Gate Kennel Dog Show, as well as concerts
by country music stars LeAnn Rimes and Travis Tritt. The Cow Palace offers
shows that are of approximately the same scope as Shoreline, but it boasts a
history and a diversity of events that cannot be found elsewhere, in addition
to the quirky charm of its name.

The Hewlett Packard Pavilion in San Jose is another major venue that
is not exclusively a concert location. As the home stadium of three
major San Jose sports teams, the Pavilion offers spectators a variety
of large-scale commercial events. It is fairly large, with the capacity to
accommodate roughly 18,(X)0 people per event. Past performers in
clude Barbra Streisand, Luciano Pavarotti, Reba McEntire and Garth
Brooks. Because it is used year-round, the Pavilion offers fairly smooth logis
tical support, as well as over-priced but reliable concessions stands; the trade
off is that the acoustics are slightly lacking due to the unspecialized nature of
the venue. The major appeal to the Stanford community may be that the
Pavilion is accessible by Caltrain.
The San Francisco Weekly Warfield Theatre, one of the last surviving
Vaudeville palaces in the city, is smaller than all of the aforemen
tioned venues, accommodating an audience of just 2,(HK) when filled
to capacity. It packs a major punch, however, when it comes to its per
formers. Attracting intellectual, classy rockers like Arcade Fire and
the Pretenders, it is the place for fans who expect intimate performances from
lesser-known musical gems. While it is still not as intimate as much smaller
clubs in San Francisco, and occasionally showcases mainstream entertainers
like Bill Maher. the Warfield's still a welcome,smart diversion from the rela
tively uniform culture of Bay Area concert venues.
