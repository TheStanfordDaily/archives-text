# Take a solo tour, no need to walk backwards
## 
### JENNA BOLLER 
At 8,180 acres, Stanford is the second largest campus in the world.
Although we live at a university the size of 27 Disneylands, it we
continue to whiz by on our bicycles and shut ourselves up in the
libraries. Furthermore, the cold and darkness of winter quarter has kept
many indoors.

For the Stanford student with a little time on his or
her hands, there are several relaxing places to take a
break or a short stroll to enjoy the scenery.

For starters, you might be interested in the general
"tourist walk" around campus. If you've encountered
a Stanford student walking backwards in front of an

eager tour group, then you've seen part of this
route. Students traverse much of campus every
day, but rarely take a moment to visit some of

Stanford's most popular attractions like Hoover
Tower or Memorial Church.
Additionally, while "fuzzies" might be inter
ested in wandering over to the Science and En
gineering Quad to take a look at Maya Lin's
Timetable clock fountain,"techies" may bene
fit from a walk through the Main Quad to the
Centennial Fountain outside Green Library.
Other places of interest include the Rodin
Sculpture Garden at Cantor. With the largest
collection of Rodin sculptures outside of France.

students can walk through the garden before continuing
on to "Stone River," an addition to Stanford's outdoor sculpture collec
tion by famous contemporary artist, Andy Goldsworthy.
The garden also provides a convenient entry into Stanford's arbore
tum, a haven for over 350 species, representing 150 genera and 60 fam
ilies of plants. As you gaze at the various oaks, you may come across the
Cactus Garden, the Mausoleum — where the remains of Jane. Leland

Stanford Sr. and Lcland Stanford Jr. are buried — and the Angel of
Grief, a monument to Jane's brother Henry Clay Lathrop.
For a walk on the west side of campus, go past Tresidder to the cor
ner of Santa Teresa and Lomita Drive and you'll reach the Papua New
Guinea Sculpture Garden. Created in 1994 by 10 master carvers from
the Middle Sepik River Region of Papua New Guinea, the mini forest
serves as a place for meditation on the way to Lake Lagunita.
Just up the hill from Roble Hall, one of several entrances to Lake
Lag connects Lomita to the trail that surrounds the manmade lake. Al
though it isn't filled with water year-round, students on west campus
often get their exercise by walking or jogging around the lake.
East campus also offers some beautiful scenery. As you walk to
ward the foothills along Stanford Avenue, you'll not only notice a
small stream to the right but will also feel enveloped by the trees.
Once you reach Junipero Serra Road, the entrance to the foothills is
not far. Sitting at the top, a 150-foot diameter radio telescope com
monly known as The Dish serves as a destination for both hikers and
joggers. On any given day, you might see a Stanford athletic team in
training on your way up, as well as a middle-aged couple walking their
dog on the way down.
For students eager to venture a little further, Jasper Ridge Biologi
cal Preserve covers 1,189 acres of grasslands, evergreen forests, oak
woodlands and wetlands. The various ecosystems at the preserve com
plement any morning or afternoon hike, a foray into bird watching or
the two-hour docent-led tour.
But if you're looking to step outside the Bubble as you know it,
consider visiting the Hakone Japanese Tea Garden in Saratoga. A 20
to 30 minute drive from campus, the ceremonial Japanese Tea House
overlooks a hillside of bamboo and a koi-filled pond. Sunset Gardens
in Menlo Park is also open to public Monday through Friday 9a.m. to
4:30 p.m. While the garden is in bloom all year, springtime flowers
bring exceptional color to the grounds. As spring quarter approach
es, take a picnic, take a friend and take the time to enjoy some of
these great walks.
