## Editorial Parents and students must engage in dialogue 
### 
For one weekend each year, parents get
a glimpse into their children's exciting
and haphazard college lives. But Par
ents' Weekend should be more than a guid
ed tour of Stanford's scenic campus and
well-manicured lawns.
This year, we hope that students will use
Parents' Weekend as an opportunity to rec
oncile their personal goals with their parents'
expectations. In order to make the most of
the Stanford experience, parents and stu
dents alike must participate fully in the col
lege process. We believe that both can bene
fit from increased dialogue about campus life
and beyond, starting with these three issues:
Living in the Bubble: choosing between
residential options
As a largely residential college, Stanford
University offers a wealth of housing op
tions on campus. But under the current sys
tem, the best housing is arbitrarily awarded
to the lucky winners of the annual housing
Draw, while the rest are left confused,
sprawled in front of Wilbur Dining in an orgy
of disappointment.
When the Draw approaches this spring
quarter, the trials and travails of Stanford
Housing are the topic du jour. Get a good
Draw number, and you and your band of
merry men can enjoy Zagat-rated cooking
and Four-Seasons-like suites in Jerry or 680.
If you're not as lucky, brace yourselves for
cramped one-room doubles and the dorm
spirit of a Soviet gulag.
Admittedly, Residential Education is
right to point out that all of the dorms at least
achieve a baseline of quality, and the dorm
experience is ultimately what you make of it.
Still, by virtue of the enormous discrepancies,
the Draw is infamous for producing ridicu

lous amounts of stress and confusion, tears
and jeers and general ludicrous behavior.
The solution could lie in a process that is
simpler and more transparent. The current
system tries to do too much, in too slapdash
a manner, creating a bewildering array of
residential choices. A more user-friendly sys
tem, we suspect, will be one that does less,
better.
Exploring the Rubble: choosing between
academic programs
In spite of the variety of academic pro
grams available at Stanford, many students
choose to stick with the tried and tested, opt
ing to be pre-med or pre-law. or to major in
economics or engineering. Straying from the
straight and narrow could be perilous: doing
so might incur the wrath of parents â€” the
major financers of their college education.
We wonder how many students have chosen
to forgo the dream of becoming a fiction
writer in order to concentrate on their pre
med course work.
College presents students with the best
opportunity to discover themselves and
their interests. But parents also have a huge
stake in the decisions their children make,
especially since college represents a huge fi
nancial commitment. We believe that par
ents and students need to participate in on
going dialogue about their shared goals and
aspirations for the future.
Parents must be sensitive to the changing
ambitions and career goals of their children.
Students, on the other hand, should be recep
tive to the advice and counsel of their par
ents. Whatever the case, both parties would
do well to communicate their motivations
and expectations to one another.
Life beyond the Bubble: choosing
a job after graduation
As graduation rapidly approach
es for some Stanford students, there
is a great deal of pressure for them to
be incredibly successful incredibly
fast. In the summer after sophomore
year, students often feel the pressure
to win a coveted summer internship
at an investment bank or consulting
firm. Or maybe the pressure is to fol
low in their parents' footsteps by be
coming a doctor, lawyer or entrepre
neur. Even if students want to work
for a nonprofit, the pressure is on to
do it better than anyone else and nab
the most prestigious position.
Parents and students need to rec

agnize that there is something inher
ently unhealthy about this kind of
pressure. While the "hot" jobs are
right for some, they aren't right for
everyone. We believe that it is far
more important for students to fig
ure out what they actually want to
da
In college,the next step isn't near
ly as predictable as it was in high
school. Some of us will go on to grad
uate studies, while others will enter
the work force. What further educa
tion do we want to pursue? What ca
reers do we want to break into?
What are our professional goals?
These are all questions that require a
lot of self-exploration and trial-and
error.
ITiroughout the college experi
ence and beyond, parents and stu
dents need to keep the channels of
communication open. Even though
it is only one weekend out of a whole
year. Parents' Weekend ought to be
the start of a sustained and meaning
ful dialogue.
