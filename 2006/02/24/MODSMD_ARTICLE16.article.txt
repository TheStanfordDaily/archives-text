# Du Vin: a taste of France
## 
### 
So, I have Doogie Howser as a prof. Well,
not actually as a prof, but as a teacher.
He's in charge of my current favorite
class: French Viticulture.
I love America. No, that's not true. Any ca
pability I had for love has been burned out of
me by several dedicated (well,sort of) years as
a physicist. However, 1 do quite like the place.
Other than the general amusement value
that the denizens of this little backwater afford
me, I'm also somewhat enamored with your ed
ucational system, especially here at the Farm.
Most institutions contend themselves with
mere greatness. You know, Nobel prizes, in
ternational glory, that sort of thing. Stanford
(though I believe this sort of thing occurs else
where as well) does things differently. We pro
vide a more holistic approach to learning.
Rather than just infuse its charges with his
tory, science, economics and film studies, the
University offers more. We have Hip 1 lop and
Social Dance, we have Fencing and Horse
manship and we have French Viticulture.
Ah,getting drunk for credit. Genius. Well,
genius may be going too far. But still pretty
darn clever.
Now. I'm not one to turn down an oppor
tunity to drink heavily and fraternize with
like-minded individuals, so as soon as I
found out about this little gem in the Course
Schedule, I signed up.
Actually, that's not exactly how it hap
pened. A first I was put off by the title —
"French Viticulture" sounds like a terribly
formal introduction to some obscure corner
of Gallic history.
In fact, even if you know what the words
mean, it's still a little misleading, for one doesn't

actually study French viticulture so much as
learn how to drink with the appropriate amount
of pretension befitting a Stanford graduate.
I guess the misnomer is a deliberate attempt
to mislead potential employers about your uni
versity days — you're not an alcoholic.you're a
student of the French wine industry.
I"he veneer of respectability given by the
name is further complemented by fact that
the class is under the protection of the
French Department (class number FREN
LANG 60D). Yes, lit.it s right. Getting
sloshed on a Thursday night really is the best
way to learn the French language.
So, inappropriateness aside, how is the
class? Well, the inebriation takes place in La
Maison Francaise. which, as I'm sure you
know, is one of those ridiculous "theme
houses" that claim to be the throbbing heart
of [fill in the blank) culture on campus.
Five times this quarter there will be 50 of
us huddled together in the cafeteria of "La
Maison," wineglasses at the ready and lips
puckered as we listen with rapt attention to
our esteemed teacher.
Doogie (whose real name is Loren Tre
fethen — which sounds a little like a mysti-

cal knight from some fantasy trilo
gy) is a recently-minted Stanford
grad; and, armed with the irresistible
charm of a child prodigy, he's our
guide through the wonderful world
of wine.
So far, we've learned how to
look, smell, swirl, smell again, sip
and (my personal favorite) slurp
noisily. Despite this professional in
struction, though, it's hard to escape
the feeling that one's playing at
being a grown up.Taking oneself se
riously whilst packed into a dining
hall with a bunch of giggling ex
teens is not easy.
If, however, you do manage to get
past the self-respect barrier, then the
wine-tasting routine (along with simi
larly irreverent classes) can set off day
dreams of finishing schools and other
such refined refining institutions.
While dancing the waltz, con
trasting Bordeaux with Burgundy or
learning the noble art of fencing, it's
easy to imagine oneself not as striv
ing for knowledge, but rather as tak
ing advantage of the best education
that money can buy, in order to ac
quire the skills to succeed in the
upper echelons of society.
On the other hand, those
"Princess Diary"moments are fleet
ing in the heady world of French
Viticulture, where the more pressing
concern is getting a refill...

Heiresses should email navins@stan
ford.edu for instruction on how to get
drunk with the commoners. The rest
of you are unimportant.
