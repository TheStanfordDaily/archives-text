# Munger owes you money
## 
### 
Dear Parents.
Welcome to Parents' Weekend 2(X)6! Pre
pare yourselves for three days of fun, sun and
insight into your child's collegiate lifestyle.
Unfortunately, if your son or daughter
lives in Stern, Mars, Columbae, Sigma Nu or
any lower Row House, we have a problem
that we need to discuss. (Actually, if your
daughter is living in Sigma Nu, you have a
much larger problem than the one dealt with
in this column.)
The problem: Chuck owes you money. Or
at least a backrub. Or a signed copy of his
collected musings, "Poor Charlie's Al
manack" (sic).
Chuck is keeping your daughter from her
much-needed sleep. He's ripped your son's
parking permit — for which he paid almost
$200 — in half. Chuck tore down decades
old palm trees and metaphorically defecated
in our front yards. Yes, Chuck is a menace.
The least he can do is throw some of his bil
lions at us.
The Chuck that I speak of is Charles T.
Munger. right-hand man of Midwestern bil

lionaire Warren Buffett. He's a roily poly of
a man and looks like an even sadder version
of the sad Bert Fischer father figure from
"Rushmore." He hefted some of his girth
and tossed $43.5 million of it Stanford's way
to build a 600-bed dorm for law students —
right on top of five historic houses on Sal
vatierra Walk.
Which means those houses need to be
moved, intact, from their current location to
the Tresidder parking lot. (1 lead towards the
Haas Center and you can see one of them
propped on stilts six feet off the ground.)
Which is why you're having trouble parking

A whole lotta B.S.
this weekend, and why part of Cam
pus Drive has become a two-lane
snarl of traffic.
Sigma Nu, Mars, Columbae, and
Muwekma residents will lose almost
all of their parking spaces and will
have to park a quarter mile away
from their homes everyday, starting
today. Construction crews have put a
temporary road between Mars and
Sigma Nu, effectively destroying
their front yards and resulting in the
removal of two palm trees, one of
which was home to an endangered
family of woodpeckers.
(When a group of concerned res
idents tried to protest the wood
pecker termination, their protest
materials — including a sign that
said "Peck You!" — were callously
destroyed by construction workers.
Apparently free speech stops at Sal
vatierra Walk.)
And construction commences at
8 a.m. everyday—jackhammers,
back-up bells, backhoes, yelling fore
men and all the rest.
The University recognizes that
this is an inconvenience, and for our
troubles they've offered affected
residents a box of earplugs. Which
we still haven't received. And a
handy website where we can send
our concerns into cyber oblivion.
I understand that the project has
a lot of benefits. It will ease the hous
ing crunch and create a social hub
for law students. But the benefits
won't help me. So basically I'm sub
sidizing the happiness of future law
students.The problem is. 1 don't care

about law students. And I especially
don't care about future law students.
They're already guaranteed a big
corporate paycheck in a couple
years. Do they need my sleep, too?
This leads me to ask: Chuck, have
you ever heard of rounding? Why
not $44 million instead of $43.5?
What's an extra $S(X) thousand to the
149 th richest man in America? To
the affected residents, it could mean
a lot. Like a new pool table. 1 know
Mars needs one. We could use anoth
er picnic table, too. And I'd like a big
ger bed and Ti Vo.
But, more realistically, current
residents need a financial concession
on their room and parking bills. It's
ridiculous that they're asked to
make sacrifices in their sleep and
study schedules, park a quarter mile
from their homes and forego a front
yard — yet still pay the same room
and parking bills as Narnia residents,
with their luscious two-room dou
bles and half-empty parking lot.
Smug bastards.
Chuck is a Captain of Industry, a
Titan of Capitalism. He'd understand
that if Stanford housing were a free
market, our housing values — and
thus room rates — would drop as a
result of our reduced living standards.
So dear parents, if you. like me,
want a chunk of your forty grand
back, e-mail mungerhousing@circle
point.com and the head of the relo
cation efforts, Susan Rozakis, roza
kis@stanford.edu. Do it for the
money. Do it for the pool table. Do it
for the woodpeckers.

Barrett apologizes for discussing a
semi-serious issue this week, and
promises a return to frivolous hilarity
next week. E-mail him at
barretts@stanford. edu.

of the sad Bert Fischer father figure from
"Rushmore." He hefted some of his girth
and tossed $43.5 million of it Stanford's way
to build a 600-bed dorm for law students —
right on top of five historic houses on Sal
vatierra Walk.
Which means those houses need to be
moved, intact, from their current location to
the Tresidder parking lot. (1 lead towards the
Haas Center and you can see one of them
propped on stilts six feet off the ground.)
Which is why you're having trouble parking

A whole lotta B.S.
this weekend, and why part of Cam
pus Drive has become a two-lane
snarl of traffic.
Sigma Nu, Mars, Columbae, and
Muwekma residents will lose almost
all of their parking spaces and will
have to park a quarter mile away
from their homes everyday, starting
today. Construction crews have put a
temporary road between Mars and
Sigma Nu, effectively destroying
their front yards and resulting in the
removal of two palm trees, one of
which was home to an endangered
family of woodpeckers.
(When a group of concerned res
idents tried to protest the wood
pecker termination, their protest
materials — including a sign that
said "Peck You!" — were callously
destroyed by construction workers.
Apparently free speech stops at Sal
vatierra Walk.)
And construction commences at
8 a.m. everyday—jackhammers,
back-up bells, backhoes, yelling fore
men and all the rest.
The University recognizes that
this is an inconvenience, and for our
troubles they've offered affected
residents a box of earplugs. Which
we still haven't received. And a
handy website where we can send
our concerns into cyber oblivion.
I understand that the project has
a lot of benefits. It will ease the hous
ing crunch and create a social hub
for law students. But the benefits
won't help me. So basically I'm sub
sidizing the happiness of future law
students.The problem is. 1 don't care

about law students. And I especially
don't care about future law students.
They're already guaranteed a big
corporate paycheck in a couple
years. Do they need my sleep, too?
This leads me to ask: Chuck, have
you ever heard of rounding? Why
not $44 million instead of $43.5?
What's an extra $S(X) thousand to the
149 th richest man in America? To
the affected residents, it could mean
a lot. Like a new pool table. 1 know
Mars needs one. We could use anoth
er picnic table, too. And I'd like a big
ger bed and Ti Vo.
But, more realistically, current
residents need a financial concession
on their room and parking bills. It's
ridiculous that they're asked to
make sacrifices in their sleep and
study schedules, park a quarter mile
from their homes and forego a front
yard — yet still pay the same room
and parking bills as Narnia residents,
with their luscious two-room dou
bles and half-empty parking lot.
Smug bastards.
Chuck is a Captain of Industry, a
Titan of Capitalism. He'd understand
that if Stanford housing were a free
market, our housing values — and
thus room rates — would drop as a
result of our reduced living standards.
So dear parents, if you. like me,
want a chunk of your forty grand
back, e-mail mungerhousing@circle
point.com and the head of the relo
cation efforts, Susan Rozakis, roza
kis@stanford.edu. Do it for the
money. Do it for the pool table. Do it
for the woodpeckers.

Barrett apologizes for discussing a
semi-serious issue this week, and
promises a return to frivolous hilarity
next week. E-mail him at
barretts@stanford. edu.
