# Munger owes you money
## 
### 
Dear Parents.
Welcome to Parents' Weekend 2(X)6! Pre
pare yourselves for three days of fun, sun and
insight into your child's collegiate lifestyle.
Unfortunately, if your son or daughter
lives in Stern, Mars, Columbae, Sigma Nu or
any lower Row House, we have a problem
that we need to discuss. (Actually, if your
daughter is living in Sigma Nu, you have a
much larger problem than the one dealt with
in this column.)
The problem: Chuck owes you money. Or
at least a backrub. Or a signed copy of his
collected musings, "Poor Charlie's Al
manack" (sic).
Chuck is keeping your daughter from her
much-needed sleep. He's ripped your son's
parking permit — for which he paid almost
$200 — in half. Chuck tore down decades
old palm trees and metaphorically defecated
in our front yards. Yes, Chuck is a menace.
The least he can do is throw some of his bil
lions at us.
The Chuck that I speak of is Charles T.
Munger. right-hand man of Midwestern bil

lionaire Warren Buffett. He's a roily poly of
a man and looks like an even sadder version
of the sad Bert Fischer father figure from
"Rushmore." He hefted some of his girth
and tossed $43.5 million of it Stanford's way
to build a 600-bed dorm for law students —
right on top of five historic houses on Sal
vatierra Walk.
Which means those houses need to be
moved, intact, from their current location to
the Tresidder parking lot. (1 lead towards the
Haas Center and you can see one of them
propped on stilts six feet off the ground.)
Which is why you're having trouble parking
