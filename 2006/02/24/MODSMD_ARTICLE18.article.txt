# Real Football: not just for metrosexuals
## 
### 
There was an excursion a couple weeks
ago for Dr. Wolf Junghann's "Sports
Culture" class. I'm not actually in the
class, but I've been on almost all their field
trips, partially because I believed athletics
could be a window into German culture and
partially because I was wooing one of the
girls in the class (success!). So far, I've man
aged to see one German basketball game —
where we saw one of the best teams in the
league play worse than my eighth-grade var
sity-B team (which had the rare distinction of
being smaller, to a man, than the sixth
graders). I've seen a hockey game — the
league has implemented new rules to cut
down on fights and focus on fundamentals, in
an apparent bid to make the game faster and
more boring (success!). I saw a bicycle race,
and the bratwurst was delicious.
I"his was the big show, though. Football.
No, not that only-in-America pigskin sheize,
with the overpaid, hyperdrugged man-tanks,
the brutally slow start-stop rhythm and the
Buddy Teevens.This is football, the kind that
takes stamina, mental fortitude and vicious
hair. Call it soccer if you're an uncultured oaf,
man; here are five reasons why it's the Real
Football.
The action is nonstop.
Some people think nothing ever happens
in football. These people are idiot, hippie
scumrags who think they're sportscasters
because they can read the scoreboard. Once
the ball is in motion, it stays in motion. Little
breaks for penalties and out-of-bounds are
barely noticeable — look away for a sec
ond, you'd never know play stopped. Com
pare that to the NFL — look away at the

wrong moment, you'd never know the play
started. The reason is simple, but mind
bending: the timer never stops. Every half is
45 minutes; a long slog, yeah, but that's 45
real minutes. How long are 15-minute
NCAA quarters, or 20 minute BBall halves,
in real time? How long is a fucking baseball
game? Every timed sport ultimately be
comes a clockwatching contest,and the clos
ing minutes are always less about athleti
cism and more about time-beating strategy
— a few well-placed fouls, the quarterback
takes a knee,everybody calls timeout. That's
not a sport, that's just playing the rules, like
Captain Kirk and the Kobayashi Maru. But
you know what...
Screw Instant Replay, there are no rules in
real football.
You know that annoying douche who sits
behind you at every sporting event insisting
that the referee totally missed the facemask
or the foul or (in baseball) everything? Put
that guy in a room with Vinnie Jones, the
lanky piece of British Bull psychosis (he was
Bullet Tooth Tony), who makes badass NFL
dudes like Terrell look like timorous choirboy
castratos. Example — back in 1988. in full

view of dozens of TV cameras and zero refer
ees, Vinnie turns toward one of his opponents
in midplay, grabs the money spot and twists.
As our friend Vinnie demonstrates, these
guys are TOUGH.
Their bones are cut from wood. Fight-
Club-style. They're running for 90 minutes
straight, with no relief. What other sport is as
fully physically grueling? Maybe cross-coun
try, but anybody can run (except me, I have a
doctor's note). And dribbling a football is
tough, man — it's not just stamina, it's dex
terity, it's strategy, it's keeping track of an
area twice as wide as an American football
field without any timeouts or fancy-dan
Madden 06 plays or a coach yelling prefab
strategy in the microphone in your ear. It's
like the D-Day sequence from "Saving Pri
vate Ryan" for 90 minutes. These guys are
warriors, and they are hard core.
So are their fans.
Football crowds don't care if their team
sucks — they're there to get loud, get angry
and get madman drunk. They've got elabo
rate chants that make the Sixth Man Club
look like shy, dispossessed Dickensian or
phans. Not to mention the hooliganism,
which (along with being the most amazing
word in any language) is a major social prob
lem currently sweeping the United King
dom. Gangs for one team fight other gangs in
massive street brawls for shits and giggles.
There was even an Elijah Wood movie about
it, but I'll be kind and not give the title.

No commercial breaks.
We all used to joke about how
Super Bowl commercials were better
than the game itself. As the Sea
Hawks limped painfully into the
second half, the joke was no longer
funny, and all that kept us going was
the hope that maybe, just maybe,
there'd be a preview for the new
"Superman" movie (Nope). Real
football doesn't have commercials.
Real football doesn't need com

mercials. Real football knows that
its nonstop clock means it'll never
make it in the states, where adverts
take up a third of every hour (watch
a full season of "24" on DVD; it
should be called "18." I'm the funni
est guy at the office, everyone says
so.) Real Football is pure,except for
the advertising logos on their uni
forms (which are actually kind of
classy in a trashy Michael Bay way).
You like purity, don't you?

hall players. Make him feel guilty for

straight, with no relief. What other sport is as
fully physically grueling? Maybe cross-coun
try, but anybody can run (except me, I have a
doctor's note). And dribbling a football is
tough, man — it's not just stamina, it's dex
terity, it's strategy, it's keeping track of an
area twice as wide as an American football
field without any timeouts or fancy-dan
Madden 06 plays or a coach yelling prefab
strategy in the microphone in your ear. It's
like the D-Day sequence from "Saving Pri
vate Ryan" for 90 minutes. These guys are
warriors, and they are hard core.
So are their fans.
Football crowds don't care if their team
sucks — they're there to get loud, get angry
and get madman drunk. They've got elabo
rate chants that make the Sixth Man Club
look like shy, dispossessed Dickensian or
phans. Not to mention the hooliganism,
which (along with being the most amazing
word in any language) is a major social prob
lem currently sweeping the United King
dom. Gangs for one team fight other gangs in
massive street brawls for shits and giggles.
There was even an Elijah Wood movie about
it, but I'll be kind and not give the title.

No commercial breaks.
We all used to joke about how
Super Bowl commercials were better
than the game itself. As the Sea
Hawks limped painfully into the
second half, the joke was no longer
funny, and all that kept us going was
the hope that maybe, just maybe,
there'd be a preview for the new
"Superman" movie (Nope). Real
football doesn't have commercials.
Real football doesn't need com

mercials. Real football knows that
its nonstop clock means it'll never
make it in the states, where adverts
take up a third of every hour (watch
a full season of "24" on DVD; it
should be called "18." I'm the funni
est guy at the office, everyone says
so.) Real Football is pure,except for
the advertising logos on their uni
forms (which are actually kind of
classy in a trashy Michael Bay way).
You like purity, don't you?

There was an excursion a couple weeks
ago for Dr. Wolf Junghann's "Sports
Culture" class. I'm not actually in the
class, but I've been on almost all their field
trips, partially because I believed athletics
could be a window into German culture and
partially because I was wooing one of the
girls in the class (success!). So far, I've man
aged to see one German basketball game —
where we saw one of the best teams in the
league play worse than my eighth-grade var
sity-B team (which had the rare distinction of
being smaller, to a man, than the sixth
graders). I've seen a hockey game — the
league has implemented new rules to cut
down on fights and focus on fundamentals, in
an apparent bid to make the game faster and
more boring (success!). I saw a bicycle race,
and the bratwurst was delicious.
I"his was the big show, though. Football.
No, not that only-in-America pigskin sheize,
with the overpaid, hyperdrugged man-tanks,
the brutally slow start-stop rhythm and the
Buddy Teevens.This is football, the kind that
takes stamina, mental fortitude and vicious
hair. Call it soccer if you're an uncultured oaf,
man; here are five reasons why it's the Real
Football.
The action is nonstop.
Some people think nothing ever happens
in football. These people are idiot, hippie
scumrags who think they're sportscasters
because they can read the scoreboard. Once
the ball is in motion, it stays in motion. Little
breaks for penalties and out-of-bounds are
barely noticeable — look away for a sec
ond, you'd never know play stopped. Com
pare that to the NFL — look away at the

wrong moment, you'd never know the play
started. The reason is simple, but mind
bending: the timer never stops. Every half is
45 minutes; a long slog, yeah, but that's 45
real minutes. How long are 15-minute
NCAA quarters, or 20 minute BBall halves,
in real time? How long is a fucking baseball
game? Every timed sport ultimately be
comes a clockwatching contest,and the clos
ing minutes are always less about athleti
cism and more about time-beating strategy
— a few well-placed fouls, the quarterback
takes a knee,everybody calls timeout. That's
not a sport, that's just playing the rules, like
Captain Kirk and the Kobayashi Maru. But
you know what...
Screw Instant Replay, there are no rules in
real football.
You know that annoying douche who sits
behind you at every sporting event insisting
that the referee totally missed the facemask
or the foul or (in baseball) everything? Put
that guy in a room with Vinnie Jones, the
lanky piece of British Bull psychosis (he was
Bullet Tooth Tony), who makes badass NFL
dudes like Terrell look like timorous choirboy
castratos. Example — back in 1988. in full

view of dozens of TV cameras and zero refer
ees, Vinnie turns toward one of his opponents
in midplay, grabs the money spot and twists.
As our friend Vinnie demonstrates, these
guys are TOUGH.
Their bones are cut from wood. Fight-
Club-style. They're running for 90 minutes
