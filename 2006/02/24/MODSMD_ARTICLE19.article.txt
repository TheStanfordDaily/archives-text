With freedom comes responsibility
Dear Mr Lin,
I'm not a member of the Bush Adminis
tration. but here's my two cents anyway:
Grow up.
I'm serious. I am appalled at your column
("A guide to effective terrorism?", Feb. 21).
First, I am appalled at your suggestion that
the terrorists bomb Disneyland. If something
happens to the Disney parks in the near fu
ture. I hope they blame you. If someone does
bomb Disneyland or Disney World. I think
you're going to find some of your own pre
cious freedoms restricted. And saying that we
care more about Disneyland than the World
Trade Center isn't going to endear you to
anyone whose parent, spouse, sibling or child
died on Sep. 1 l,2(X)l.
And then saying they should kidnap J. K.
Rowling, the mother of three children who
has never done anything to hurt anyone?
ITiat's real mature. I realize it was a kind of a
joke, but think about what a sick joke that is.
You do realize that there are people in the

world who are or have been taken hostage by
these madmen? Lhat some have lost their
lives? I'm sure their families don't find your
words remotely humorous or appropriate,
and I'm sure Ms. Rowling's husband and chil
dren are not amused either. Neither are her
legions of fans — and yes, I'm one of them.
I am 30 years old and a writer myself. I
know how intoxicating free speech can be.
But I'm sure I'm neither the first nor the last
person to write and tell you that you need to
exercise some responsibility. ITiink about
how your words are going to affect people.
Do you really want to hurt the innocent fam
ilies of terror victims? Haven't they suffered
enough, without you pouring salt and lemon
juice into their wounds?
I fully believe that you and the newspaper
which so irresponsibly printed your article
owe a huge apology to a lot of people. You
have hurt and insulted a great many individ
uals not only in the United States, but around
the world.
I will conclude by saying that I hope you
and your loved ones, Mr. Lin. never find
yourselves in the situation that you have sug

gested should be brought upon Ms. Rowling
and her loved ones. But if you are, I hope that
the rest of the country treats you and yours
with more respect than you have shown in
your article.

Stanford engineers contribute to
society in meaningful ways
Tuesday's editorial ("National Engineers
Week should prompt reflection," Feb. 21)
rightly calls for engineers to be more
involved in service and less tied
down by coursework. As an engi
neer, I want to respond to a few
points and mention people and
groups that are already contributing
in meaningful ways to society.
The demands of engineering are
well known, and I half-jokingly call
my major Chemical "I-hate-my-life"
Engineering. However, the techie re

quirements helped me develop an
incredibly useful toolbox to solve
problems, technical and non-techni
cal. Stanford engineers' organiza
tional and communication skills are
often overlooked. Engineering
courses here present projects that
challenge the students' knowledge
of the fundamentals. But they also
demand that students consider the
human side, like how to present a sci
entific solution that is economically
feasible and socially useful.
Engineers participate in socially
responsible activities by choosing
where we apply our time and talent.
Should I engineer a drug that pre

vents male pattern baldness? Or
should I develop a treatment that al
lows Celiac Sprue patients, who form
about 1 percent of the U.S. popula
tion, to digest their food? My advi
sor, Chaitan Khosla, chose the latter.
He is making progress through his
research at Stanford and his public
charity, the Celiac Sprue Research
Foundation.
Similarly, the Office of Engineer
ing and Public Service was created
this fall for the exact purpose of
bringing engineering students, facul
ty and public service groups togeth
er. Likewise, BASES Social-E Chal
lenge encourages ventures that ad

dress social and environmental
problems.
With some finesse and planning,
engineers can take advantage of any
Stanford opportunity. The School of
Engineering should provide mentors
and advice for underclassmen engi
neers to navigate their four years on
the Farm. 1 was lucky enough to be a
varsity athlete, study in Berlin, serve
as Chaplain of my fraternity, volun
teer with the Catholic Community
and still be an engineer. It took nu
merous special arrangements, but it
was well worth the effort.
For anyone interested in exactly
how engineers use their skills for

public service, I invite you to take
Engineering 20: Introduction to
Chemical Engineering this spring.
The course has no prerequisites
other than high school math. I will
be a teaching assistant, and the pro
fessor is Channing Robertson. He
will mention the huge salaries that
engineers make, especially chemical
engineers. He will also talk about
how engineers improved kidney
dialysis and how an engineer's ex
pert testimony helped win the bil
lion-dollar settlement against Big
Tobacco.

bomb Disneyland or Disney World. I think
you're going to find some of your own pre
cious freedoms restricted. And saying that we
care more about Disneyland than the World
Trade Center isn't going to endear you to
anyone whose parent, spouse, sibling or child
died on Sep. 1 l,2(X)l.
And then saying they should kidnap J. K.
Rowling, the mother of three children who
has never done anything to hurt anyone?
ITiat's real mature. I realize it was a kind of a
joke, but think about what a sick joke that is.
You do realize that there are people in the

world who are or have been taken hostage by
these madmen? Lhat some have lost their
lives? I'm sure their families don't find your
words remotely humorous or appropriate,
and I'm sure Ms. Rowling's husband and chil
dren are not amused either. Neither are her
legions of fans — and yes, I'm one of them.
I am 30 years old and a writer myself. I
know how intoxicating free speech can be.
But I'm sure I'm neither the first nor the last
person to write and tell you that you need to
exercise some responsibility. ITiink about
how your words are going to affect people.
Do you really want to hurt the innocent fam
ilies of terror victims? Haven't they suffered
enough, without you pouring salt and lemon
juice into their wounds?
I fully believe that you and the newspaper
which so irresponsibly printed your article
owe a huge apology to a lot of people. You
have hurt and insulted a great many individ
uals not only in the United States, but around
the world.
I will conclude by saying that I hope you
and your loved ones, Mr. Lin. never find
yourselves in the situation that you have sug

gested should be brought upon Ms. Rowling
and her loved ones. But if you are, I hope that
the rest of the country treats you and yours
with more respect than you have shown in
your article.

Stanford engineers contribute to
society in meaningful ways
Tuesday's editorial ("National Engineers
Week should prompt reflection," Feb. 21)
rightly calls for engineers to be more
involved in service and less tied
down by coursework. As an engi
neer, I want to respond to a few
points and mention people and
groups that are already contributing
in meaningful ways to society.
The demands of engineering are
well known, and I half-jokingly call
my major Chemical "I-hate-my-life"
Engineering. However, the techie re

quirements helped me develop an
incredibly useful toolbox to solve
problems, technical and non-techni
cal. Stanford engineers' organiza
tional and communication skills are
often overlooked. Engineering
courses here present projects that
challenge the students' knowledge
of the fundamentals. But they also
demand that students consider the
human side, like how to present a sci
entific solution that is economically
feasible and socially useful.
Engineers participate in socially
responsible activities by choosing
where we apply our time and talent.
Should I engineer a drug that pre

vents male pattern baldness? Or
should I develop a treatment that al
lows Celiac Sprue patients, who form
about 1 percent of the U.S. popula
tion, to digest their food? My advi
sor, Chaitan Khosla, chose the latter.
He is making progress through his
research at Stanford and his public
charity, the Celiac Sprue Research
Foundation.
Similarly, the Office of Engineer
ing and Public Service was created
this fall for the exact purpose of
bringing engineering students, facul
ty and public service groups togeth
er. Likewise, BASES Social-E Chal
lenge encourages ventures that ad

dress social and environmental
problems.
With some finesse and planning,
engineers can take advantage of any
Stanford opportunity. The School of
Engineering should provide mentors
and advice for underclassmen engi
neers to navigate their four years on
the Farm. 1 was lucky enough to be a
varsity athlete, study in Berlin, serve
as Chaplain of my fraternity, volun
teer with the Catholic Community
and still be an engineer. It took nu
merous special arrangements, but it
was well worth the effort.
For anyone interested in exactly
how engineers use their skills for

public service, I invite you to take
Engineering 20: Introduction to
Chemical Engineering this spring.
The course has no prerequisites
other than high school math. I will
be a teaching assistant, and the pro
fessor is Channing Robertson. He
will mention the huge salaries that
engineers make, especially chemical
engineers. He will also talk about
how engineers improved kidney
dialysis and how an engineer's ex
pert testimony helped win the bil
lion-dollar settlement against Big
Tobacco.
