With freedom comes responsibility
Dear Mr Lin,
I'm not a member of the Bush Adminis
tration. but here's my two cents anyway:
Grow up.
I'm serious. I am appalled at your column
("A guide to effective terrorism?", Feb. 21).
First, I am appalled at your suggestion that
the terrorists bomb Disneyland. If something
happens to the Disney parks in the near fu
ture. I hope they blame you. If someone does
bomb Disneyland or Disney World. I think
you're going to find some of your own pre
cious freedoms restricted. And saying that we
care more about Disneyland than the World
Trade Center isn't going to endear you to
anyone whose parent, spouse, sibling or child
died on Sep. 1 l,2(X)l.
And then saying they should kidnap J. K.
Rowling, the mother of three children who
has never done anything to hurt anyone?
ITiat's real mature. I realize it was a kind of a
joke, but think about what a sick joke that is.
You do realize that there are people in the

world who are or have been taken hostage by
these madmen? Lhat some have lost their
lives? I'm sure their families don't find your
words remotely humorous or appropriate,
and I'm sure Ms. Rowling's husband and chil
dren are not amused either. Neither are her
legions of fans â€” and yes, I'm one of them.
I am 30 years old and a writer myself. I
know how intoxicating free speech can be.
But I'm sure I'm neither the first nor the last
person to write and tell you that you need to
exercise some responsibility. ITiink about
how your words are going to affect people.
Do you really want to hurt the innocent fam
ilies of terror victims? Haven't they suffered
enough, without you pouring salt and lemon
juice into their wounds?
I fully believe that you and the newspaper
which so irresponsibly printed your article
owe a huge apology to a lot of people. You
have hurt and insulted a great many individ
uals not only in the United States, but around
the world.
I will conclude by saying that I hope you
and your loved ones, Mr. Lin. never find
yourselves in the situation that you have sug

gested should be brought upon Ms. Rowling
and her loved ones. But if you are, I hope that
the rest of the country treats you and yours
with more respect than you have shown in
your article.
