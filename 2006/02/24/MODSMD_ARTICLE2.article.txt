"At the dedication of Stanford Law School's Crown
Quadrangle on Sept. 21,1975, what man spoke of Stan
ford's foundation as a 'solid triad of law, learning and
liberty?"'
Second-year law students Craig Segall, Tara
Heumann, Dana Johnson and Ognen Stojanovski cor
rectly pegged Gerald Ford as the correct answer to seal
their win at Stanford Law Students' Association's Bat
tle of the Brains event last night. "Team Deuce" top
pled three other student teams and two faculty teams
on their way to championship.
Held in Kresge Auditorium, Battle of the Brains is
an annual fundraising event that joins law students and
faculty with a celebrity host for an evening of Quiz
Bowl-style trivia fun.This year, the 16 participating stu
dents and eight faculty and staff members joined attor
ney-turned-reality-star Jennifer Massey of "The Ap
prentice" for two hours of knowledge, laughter and
jokes about "You're fired!"
Behind the lighthearted appearance of the event
was a serious fundraising effort. According to Law As
sociation co-president Bret Logue and event organiz
er Jenny Allen, Battle of the Brains is the largest firm
directed fundraiser of the year.
"Law firms sponsor Battle of the Brains at either
the Einstein ($5000), Genius ($2500), Brilliant ($1000)
or Enlightened ($500) level," Allen wrote in an email
to The Daily. Contributing firm names are featured on
promotional materials and are offered VIP seating at
the actual event.
"This year we raised $24,000," Logue said, adding
that this totaled a $ 1 ,(XK) increase over last year, includ
ing an unprecedented $5,000 donation by Skadden.

"The Apprentice" Season Two's finalist Jennifer
Massey hosted last night's 11th annual Battle of the
Brains at Kresge Auditorium. The event is the largest
fund directed fundraiser of the year.
Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP
Funds benefited two public inter
est organizations — the Stanford
Community Law Clinic (SCLC) in
East Palo Alto and the Stanford Pub
lic Interest Law Foundation (SPILF).
Allen reported that SCLC provides
free legal representation, advice and
education to impoverished commu
nities while also training law students
who volunteer with the organization.
SPILF provides funding for students
to work in public sector jobs that ordi
narily would not provide stipends.
"Both are wonderful organiza
tions to work with." said Sarah
Gilbert, Law Association co-presi
dent and current member of the
SPILF board.
Jennifer Massey, runner-up on the
second season of Donald Trump's
"The Apprentice," was on hand to cel
ebrate these successful fundraising ef
forts as Battle of the Brains' guest host.
Massey was a quick choice when
Allen and last year's event chair Lisa

Schwartz considered possible celebri
ty emcees.
"We knew we wanted a vibrant
host that was either connected to law
or trivia games," said Allen. Last
year's host. Ken Jennings, the record
breaking Jeopardy champion, also
strongly reflected these criteria, she
added.
"I thought Jennifer Massey would
be great because during The Appren
tice, she became a role model for driv
en young attorneys," Schwartz said.
Massey, now working with a
prominent California entertainment
law firm after her television stint, was
happy to oblige and thought the
event to be a success.
"After living in the Bay Area for
six years. I think a ton of Stanford
Law." Massey. a graduate of Harvard
Law School, said. "I think it's a great
institution and I love meeting with
students."
"I'm also unbelievably impressed
with the caliber of the participants
and the speed that they are able to an
swer the questions," she said, refer
ring to the lightening-quick reflexes
of teams responding before she fin
ished reading a sentence.
The event took place in the style of

a true Quiz Bowl tournament. Ac
cording to Quiz Bowl President Eric
Smith, who selected the trivia ques
tions, the types of challenges are
called "toss-ups," meaning that any
one can buzz in and answer as soon as
they know the answer.
"There are a mix of things: history,
literature, science, pop culture and
current events," Smith said before the
event. Participants were quizzed on
everything from Oprah's 2(X)4 new
car giveaway to President Milliard
Fillmore's Secretary of State Daniel
Webster.
"1 think that this event is good ex
posure for Stanford Quiz Bowl," said
Smith, who added that he hoped the
laughter-filled night of trivia would
inspire more students to investigate
the club.
By the end of the night, all of the
event organizers and participants said
they considered Battle of the Brains
to be a huge success.
"We're very excited about the
$24,000 [of fundraising] and we
couldn't have asked for a more fun
and riveting Quiz Bowl atmosphere,"
said Logue, referring with a laugh to
the intense comeback during the first
round of student play.

jokes about "You're fired!"
Behind the lighthearted appearance of the event
was a serious fundraising effort. According to Law As
sociation co-president Bret Logue and event organiz
er Jenny Allen, Battle of the Brains is the largest firm
directed fundraiser of the year.
"Law firms sponsor Battle of the Brains at either
the Einstein ($5000), Genius ($2500), Brilliant ($1000)
or Enlightened ($500) level," Allen wrote in an email
to The Daily. Contributing firm names are featured on
promotional materials and are offered VIP seating at
the actual event.
"This year we raised $24,000," Logue said, adding
that this totaled a $ 1 ,(XK) increase over last year, includ
ing an unprecedented $5,000 donation by Skadden.

Funds benefited two public inter
est organizations — the Stanford
Community Law Clinic (SCLC) in
East Palo Alto and the Stanford Pub
lic Interest Law Foundation (SPILF).
Allen reported that SCLC provides
free legal representation, advice and
education to impoverished commu
nities while also training law students
who volunteer with the organization.
SPILF provides funding for students
to work in public sector jobs that ordi
narily would not provide stipends.
"Both are wonderful organiza
tions to work with." said Sarah
Gilbert, Law Association co-presi
dent and current member of the
SPILF board.
Jennifer Massey, runner-up on the
second season of Donald Trump's
"The Apprentice," was on hand to cel
ebrate these successful fundraising ef
forts as Battle of the Brains' guest host.
Massey was a quick choice when
Allen and last year's event chair Lisa

Schwartz considered possible celebri
ty emcees.
"We knew we wanted a vibrant
host that was either connected to law
or trivia games," said Allen. Last
year's host. Ken Jennings, the record
breaking Jeopardy champion, also
strongly reflected these criteria, she
added.
"I thought Jennifer Massey would
be great because during The Appren
tice, she became a role model for driv
en young attorneys," Schwartz said.
Massey, now working with a
prominent California entertainment
law firm after her television stint, was
happy to oblige and thought the
event to be a success.
"After living in the Bay Area for
six years. I think a ton of Stanford
Law." Massey. a graduate of Harvard
Law School, said. "I think it's a great
institution and I love meeting with
students."
"I'm also unbelievably impressed
with the caliber of the participants
and the speed that they are able to an
swer the questions," she said, refer
ring to the lightening-quick reflexes
of teams responding before she fin
ished reading a sentence.
The event took place in the style of

a true Quiz Bowl tournament. Ac
cording to Quiz Bowl President Eric
Smith, who selected the trivia ques
tions, the types of challenges are
called "toss-ups," meaning that any
one can buzz in and answer as soon as
they know the answer.
"There are a mix of things: history,
literature, science, pop culture and
current events," Smith said before the
event. Participants were quizzed on
everything from Oprah's 2(X)4 new
car giveaway to President Milliard
Fillmore's Secretary of State Daniel
Webster.
"1 think that this event is good ex
posure for Stanford Quiz Bowl," said
Smith, who added that he hoped the
laughter-filled night of trivia would
inspire more students to investigate
the club.
By the end of the night, all of the
event organizers and participants said
they considered Battle of the Brains
to be a huge success.
"We're very excited about the
$24,000 [of fundraising] and we
couldn't have asked for a more fun
and riveting Quiz Bowl atmosphere,"
said Logue, referring with a laugh to
the intense comeback during the first
round of student play.
