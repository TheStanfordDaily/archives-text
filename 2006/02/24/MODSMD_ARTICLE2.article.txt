"At the dedication of Stanford Law School's Crown
Quadrangle on Sept. 21,1975, what man spoke of Stan
ford's foundation as a 'solid triad of law, learning and
liberty?"'
Second-year law students Craig Segall, Tara
Heumann, Dana Johnson and Ognen Stojanovski cor
rectly pegged Gerald Ford as the correct answer to seal
their win at Stanford Law Students' Association's Bat
tle of the Brains event last night. "Team Deuce" top
pled three other student teams and two faculty teams
on their way to championship.
Held in Kresge Auditorium, Battle of the Brains is
an annual fundraising event that joins law students and
faculty with a celebrity host for an evening of Quiz
Bowl-style trivia fun.This year, the 16 participating stu
dents and eight faculty and staff members joined attor
ney-turned-reality-star Jennifer Massey of "The Ap
prentice" for two hours of knowledge, laughter and
jokes about "You're fired!"
Behind the lighthearted appearance of the event
was a serious fundraising effort. According to Law As
sociation co-president Bret Logue and event organiz
er Jenny Allen, Battle of the Brains is the largest firm
directed fundraiser of the year.
"Law firms sponsor Battle of the Brains at either
the Einstein ($5000), Genius ($2500), Brilliant ($1000)
or Enlightened ($500) level," Allen wrote in an email
to The Daily. Contributing firm names are featured on
promotional materials and are offered VIP seating at
the actual event.
"This year we raised $24,000," Logue said, adding
that this totaled a $ 1 ,(XK) increase over last year, includ
ing an unprecedented $5,000 donation by Skadden.
