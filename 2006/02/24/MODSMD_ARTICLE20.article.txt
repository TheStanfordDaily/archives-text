### ISRAEL ROJAS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Records are nice, hut champi
onships are even better.
This weekend, Stanford heads to
Seattle, Wash, for the 2006 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation In
door Championships. Ther, 11 pro
grams will compete, including eight
Pac-10 schools, or all hut Southern
California and Oregon State. The
field will also include nine of the top
25 teams in the nation.
The Stanford women look to jus
tify their lofty No. 2 national rank
ing with a third-straight champi
onship, while the men hope to end
UCLA's four-year streak at the top.
"This is the meet for a majority of
the team," senior Michael Robert
son said. "Everyone is getting ready
for big performances."
Given such an intense desire to
excel, athletes may well look for any
way to gain an advantage â€” fair or
not. For sprinters, this comes in the
form of mind games, with nearly
Tree-worthy stunts being pulled to
psyche out the competition.
"People will come out with
braces [even though they are
healthy], or false start intentionally
[in order to make any subsequent
false starts result in a disqualifica
tion]." junior Janice Davis said.
"Other people try to dictate your
race."
The Washington Huskies will
host the event for the third year in a
row. The championship, an annual
event since the MPSF's establish
ment in 1992. filled the void of
championship competition for Divi
sion 1 athletes in the Big West. Pac
-10. Mountain West, Western Athlet
ic and West Coast Conferences.
In a meet where the top eight fin
ishers score team points, more ath
letes than usual will be looking to
make a difference.
"It's going to be a matter of com
peting not only for first, but for
every spot along the top eight,"
Robertson said. "You might not win.
but if you make the most of your
event and help the team to victory,
then you are still a champion."
Last year, the MPSF enjoyed
considerable national success, as four confer
ence teams won NCAA championships and
hundreds of athletes participated in the
NCAA postseason.
With multiple athletes having recently set
personal and school records, success this week
end will be a matter of consistency and improve
ment,
Sophomore Chauntae Bayne has taken
this mentality to a whole new level, having al
ready broken the school 200 meter record
several times this season. Bayne credits her
newfound success to her family. She took
some time off from running last year when she

had a baby girl, and she has been using her
daughter as motivation to improve as she
looks toward a professional career.
"1 tell myself it is for her, for her best fu
ture," Bayne said.
She wasted little time in getting back into
shape, waiting only about a month before she
was back in training.
"I used to have a horrible work ethic,"
Bayne said.
But the responsibility of starting a family
pushed her to turn her life around.
"When you have other people depending
on you, you can't be selfish," Bayne said.
