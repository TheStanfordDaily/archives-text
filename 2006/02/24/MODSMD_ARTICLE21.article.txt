# ON THE ROAD
## BASEBALL STARTS 10-GAME TRIP WITH A VISIT TO FRESNO STATE STANFORD VS. FRESNO STATE 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Through the first five games of Stan
ford's baseball season, senior Chris Lewis
could only collect one hit. Finally,on a Feb.
12 Stanford slugfest against Kansas, Lewis
picked up his second hit and RBI with a
homerun. Since then, the second baseman
and the Cardinal have been looking to im
prove their performances at the plate.
Though he enters this weekend's Fres
no State (6-6) series with just a .125 aver
age, Lewis' mark is miles ahead of the
.062 average he carried five games in.
Stanford (7-3) has also improved offen
sively overall in that time, from a .199 to a
.240 team mark.
All told, after outscoring its opponents
23-12 in the last three games, Stanford's fi
nally starting to click.
"We need to string together hits, not
rely on the long ball and get something
going around the bases," Lewis said. "If we
can get all that down, we'll be fine, because
we've been pitching phenomenally."
This weekend could provide another
opportunity to rack up some hits, with the
Cardinal facing an inexperienced Fresno
State team. Stanford swept Fresno State
last season, as well as in 2003, while taking
two of three in 2004.
If last season's games are any indica
tion, Lewis might come back from Fresno
out of his slump. The last time the Cardi
nal played the Bulldogs, he went 3-for-5

at the plate.
As for his recent struggles, Lewis —
who finished last season with a .266 bat
ting average but now holds the lowest av
erage among starters — said he took his
focus away from wanting to hit the ball
deep.
"I think I'm trying too hard to hit,"

Lewis said. "I'm trying to create too much
at the plate."
While Lewis has been working on
minor adjustments, such as on his hand
mechanics and timing, the team is also
stressing fundamentals as a means of im
provement.
"We need to get the ball out of the air
and onto the ground," senior Chris Mi
naker said. "We need to focus on line
drives. Even on outs [we hit into], we have
to make them earn it."
The Fresno State pitching staff, with a
5.37 team ERA. won't be any better than
what the Cardinal saw in their recent 10-
game homestand. Even so, the Bulldogs'
hurlers have helped their team win three
consecutive series this year.
Tonight's starter for the Bulldogs,
righthander Doug Fister. posted a strong
showing in his last appearance on the
mound. In seven innings, he gave up only
two runs on eight hits to get the win. im
proving his record to 1-2 with a 4.50 ERA.
Southpaw Eddie Romero, Saturday's
pitcher for the Bulldogs, is coming off an
impressive eight-inning shutout victory
last week in which he fanned seven in an
11-6 win over Utah Valley State. Romero
is 2-1 on the season with a 4.37 ERA.
But perhaps the most dominant mem
ber of Fresno State's pitching trio is third
starter Andy Underwood, who owns a 2-1
record and a 1.99 ERA. 'ITie righthander

Senior infielder Chris Lewis, currently batting .125 on the season, will try to slap himself out of his slump this weekend at Fresno State.
The Cardinal, coming off three straight victories at home, has dropped only one game to the Bulldogs in the last three seasons.
went 8.2 innings, struck out nine and
gave up just three runs in a 5-4 loss.
Kent Sakamoto, Steve Susdorf
and Christian Vitters have been
leading the way for the Bulldogs on
the offensive end. Sakamoto (.340)
has four doubles on the season, and
Susdorf follows closely with three.
Susdorf (.340), a leftfielder, and Vit
ters (.349), a shortstop, are tied for
the team lead with four home runs
apiece.
The Cardinal counter with Mi
naker and sophomore rightfielder
MichaelTaylor. Minaker had a 5-for
-5 day last year against the Bulldogs,
and brings a .308 average into this
weekend's series. The shortstop has
been swinging a hot bat lately, with
seven hits, six RBI and four runs in
the last three games, including his
second career grand slam against
Texas last Sunday.
Taylor enters the weekend with a
.294 average,five hits and seven RBI
in the same period of time.
But it has been the Cardinal's
pitching that has carried the team
thus far, with senior righthander
Greg Reynolds (0-1,2.89 ERA) and
freshman reliever Jeremy Bleich
(0.00 ERA, 4 saves) in particular
dominating the mound. If trends
continue, Saturday starter Matt
Manship (6.55 ERA) should have a
chance at his first win this season.
The senior has improved in every
outing, and he held Texas to just one
run last Sunday. He attributes his im
provement to throwing "more off
speed pitches for strikes and mixing
it up more."
Stanford, who dropped out of
the rankings this week, got a pre
view of the season to come when its
first Tuesday game rolled around
two weeks ahead of schedule. The
Cardinal beat Nevada 5-2 on Tues
day afternoon, finishing off a four
game weekend at home before a 10-
game tour of the Bay Area and Los
Angeles. According to Minaker, the
Cardinal felt some fatigue after the
four-game stretch, but the squad
has recovered and is mentally
preparing for its first road trip of
the year.
Tonight's matchup is scheduled
for 6:35 p.m. at Fresno State, while
Saturday and Sunday's games will
start at 1:05 p.m.
