## NBA Playoff Ponderings 
### 
Now that we're just past the All-Star Weekend
Extravaganza, it's time to take a look at the
N BA and size up the competition, the frontrun
ners and the dark horses heading into the playoffs. With
around 30 games to play, here's how I see things shak
ing out.
First of all, with the exception of the Detroit Pistons,
there's not a team in the overmatched East that will be
able to go more than five games with whoever comes
out of the juggernaut West. Some analysts want to say
that the Heat can do it, but with a weak 5-11 record
against the teams that would make the playoffs from
the West if the season ended today, they aren't going to
cut it.
'Ihe Pistons are coming out of the East at 22-6 in
conference and as one of only four teams with a win
ning record against the West (the Heat, Pacers and sur
prising Sixers round out the list).
If you want a dark horse, look to the Gilbert Arenas
led Washington Wizards. They've got some playoff ex
perience, and could surprise the Nets in the first round.
They might get all the way to the Easten Conference Fi
nals if the Heat (read: Shaq) is off.
But the road to the championship will inevitably
pass through the Western Conference. As hot as the Pis
tons started, their record in the past 10 games has been
a mediocre 6-4. Cracks in the armor are starting to show,
while the Mavericks and Spurs have only shown signs
of improvement.
The defending champs have been a bit slowed by in
juries to key players, including a sidelined Manu Gi
nobli and a less-than-full-strength Tim Duncan. If they
ever start running on all cylinders, the Spurs have got to
be the team to beat.
New-age NBA thought is that you don't need the
big man to win anymore, but not since the Jordan era
has a team without a dominant center gone all the way.
San Antonio's defense and offense both run through
Duncan, and if he's good to go, the Spurs will be tough
to beat.
Who can challenge San Antonio? Right now, my
Dallas Mavericks hold the top seed in conference.
Probably the deepest and most balanced team in the
league, the Mavericks have significantly improved their
team defense under the watchful eye of Avery Johnson,
now in his first full season as head coach.The offense is
putting up three digits a game, and the team has shown
that they can beat the best, trouncing both the Pistons
and the Spurs in a single week earlier this season.
Hie silver bullet? Dallas doesn't have a big game
like the other contenders. Erick Dampier, DeSagana
Diop, and DJ Mbenga have all been serviceable, but
Duncan, Amare Stoudemire, or Shaquille O'Neal
would eat them alive. And because of the stupid way
in which the NBA seeds the playoffs, the Mavericks
and Spurs are almost guaranteed to meet in the sec
ond round.
Seriously, how can San Antonio be a No. 4 seed at 41-
12 and Denver a No. 3 seed at 29-26? Even the No. 6
seed Memphis Grizzlies have a better record than the
Nuggets. Someone please fix this.
But I digress. The other team with the potential to
dethrone the Spurs in the West is the Phoenix Suns.The
top seed a year ago, the Suns have been hampered by a
huge injury l to All-Star center Stoudemire. If he can get
healthy, the Suns will be a force to be reckoned with in
the playoffs. It would be a shootout every night, but
they've shown that they're able to outshoot just about
anyone with Steve Nash at the helm and Shawn Mari
on on the boards. Just as last year, however, if the Suns
run against a team with solid defense (i.e. the Spurs.
Mavericks, or the league-leading Grizzlies), they're
going to have problems in the playoffs.
Speaking of Memphis, they're my dark horse of the
West. Relatively untested and young, they may lack the
pressure experience to go far in these
playoffs. But if they can draw the
Nuggets in the first round and avoid
San Antonio or Dallas in the second,
they have the potential to make a run.
As for the rest of the West, forget
the L.A. teams. The Clip are having a
franchise year, hut they'll falter under
the big light. As for the L.A. Kobes...
I mean Lakers, no way. Kobe's not MJ.
and even MJ showed that he can't
carry a team to a championship all
alone (remember that ugly Wizards
experiment?). The Nuggets are hardly
worthy of a No. 3 seed, and the NOK
(where?) Hornets just don't have the
firepower.
In the finals, expect the Pistons to
have the upper hand, no matter who
they take on.
For the sake of argument, however,
I'm going out on a limb here and back
ing my hometown boys. I'll take the
Mavericks over the Pistons, in six. to
bring Dallas home its first ever NBA
championship.
