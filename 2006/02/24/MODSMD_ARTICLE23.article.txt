# Heart of a Champion
## I specialized because of my shoulder. I had to get good at something to be valuable. LAUREL CHAMPION, senior defender 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
A (Jaunting challenge faced senior
defender Laurel Champion as she
headed into her final season on the
Farm — after undergoing two rounds
of surgery this past summer to repair a
torn rotator cuff in each of her shoul
ders, Champion was forced to embark
upon a tedious rehabilitation program
essentially consisting of nothing more
than strength and conditioning train
ing. It wasn't until the second week of
January — just three weeks prior to
the start of the Stanford water polo's
2(H)6 campaign — that Champion ac
tually began practicing with the rest of
her team.
Three weeks didn't exactly give
her a lot of time to get into regular
season form, but Champion hasn't
seemed to miss a beat. Through the
first seven games of the Stanford
women's season, she has contributed
three goals while providing an invalu
able presence in the defensive end of
the pool.
But neither her timely recovery nor
her steady play has come as a surprise
to her teammates, who witnessed the
daily resolve with which Champion ap
proached her rehab, and the season.
And that mindset, according to coach
John Tanner, is exactly what makes her
the model team captain.
"Every day.she walks into the office
ready to have a good practice," he said.
"She has a very persistent attitude and

daily approach. So to Laurel, what
seems like interminable rehab exercise
is just something she's able to put her
mind to and improve from. I feel that
she's a great captain because of her dis
cipline. and the high expectation she
has of herself and of others."
Champion's attitude toward her
conditioning and endless kick sets
made a lasting impression on her team
mates as well.
"I've been really inspired by her atti
tude." sophomore driver Jenna Scal
manini said. "There were definitely
times when her shoulder was hurting
her. or she wanted to jump into some
thing and give it her all but just couldn't.
But she never let on that anything was
bugging her. So in that way, she really
inspired us to work as hard as we could
and to give it our all."
In addition to the intangibles she
brings to the team. Champion serves an
invaluable role as the anchor of the
Stanford field defense. After losing
three strong defensive players from last
year's squad, the Cardinal knew that
their ability to compete this season

would be largely contingent upon hav
ing a healthy Champion marking the
opposition's players at set.
"She's a really great defensive play
er, especially at the two-meter mark,"
Tanner said. "She matches up against
some of the best players in the country,
and very successfully. In that regard,
she's a symbol of the consistent and ef
fective defensive play of our entire
team."
At a position where players will do
just about anything short of drowning
each other to get possession of the ball.
Champion plays with a composure that
never seems to waver.
"The thing that's great about her as
a defender at such a high intensity posi
tion is that she always looks so calm and
in control," junior driver Katie Hansen
said. "She always seems to be able to
take the aggression from the offensive
side and diffuse it."
Ironically, Champion's defensive
prowess developed as the direct result
of the shoulder injuries from which she

is now recovering. During her first two
seasons on the team. Champion was
used as a versatile utility player. But
when the health of her rotator cuffs
began to deteriorate near the end of
her sophomore season, she was forced
to cope with limited arm strength and
shooting abilities.
"I came in to Stanford a very well
rounded player," Champion said. "1
sprinted, I drove and I posted up. But
toward the end of my second year,
when I injured my shoulders, I pretty
much stopped shooting and got more
defensive-minded."
Champion played through the in
juries last season with the help of
monthly cortisone shots, but the per
sistent shoulder pain required her to
compensate with her legs.
"I specialized because of my
shoulder," Champion said. "I had to
get good at something in order to be
valuable somewhere, so it was really

the logical decision. I've become
more of a one-dimensional player,
hut I never would have worked as
hard on my leg strength or two-meter
defense if I hadn't needed to."
With all the work she has put in.
Champion has firmly cemented
herself as an integral piece of the
Cardinal's defensive puzzle. Still, it
is perhaps her lead-by-example,
whatever-it-takes attitude that is
her greatest contribution to this
year's team.
"One of my old coaches told me
that people talk all the time, but that
no one listens," Champion said. "I've
always believed that it would be best
for me to do unto others exactly what
I expected from them."
Scalmanini offered a testament to
Champion's success in achieving that
personal goal.
"There are so many times when
we'll come over to the wall during a
timeout in a tight game, and she'll be
the one who's always encouraging,"
Scalmanini said. "She's always the
one to speak up and say something,
and she's always pushing every one of
us to finish strong."
