### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
Yesterday, the McDon
ald's High School All-Ameri
can game named 24 men and
24 women to play in the na
tion's premier high school
all-star game. Stanford was
one of just three schools to
put four recruits on the list,
joining basketball power
houses Duke and North Car
olina.
On the men's side, incom
ing twin post recruits Brook

and Robin Lopez of Fresno,
Calif, were tabbed. For the
women. Jayne Appel out of
Concord, Calif., and Michelle
Harrison of Orem, Utah made
the list.
This marks the most hon
ors ever for Stanford, which
had signed just seven basket
ball Ail-Americans before
yesterday's announcement.
Three current members of
the women's team played in
the All-American game —
junior Brooke Smith in 2002
and sophomores Candice

Wiggins and Cissy Pierce in
2004. Next year, the women's
squad could play an entirely
All-American lineup.
The Cardinal men have not
had an All-American recruit
since Josh Childress was hon
ored in 2001.
The Lopezes are only the
second set of twins to be
named men's All-Americans.
The only other pair — Jason
and Jarron Collins — also
chose Stanford.They now play
for the New Jersey Nets and
Utah Jazz, respectively.
