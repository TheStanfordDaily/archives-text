# Wiggins, Cardinal reach 100-point plateau
## No ill effects for Wiggins, she lends Cardinal with 29 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sophomore guard Candice Wiggins was
coming off an inury.The women's basketball
team had lost at Arizona State last weekend,
and had lost to Washington earlier in the sea
son. Yet, last night at Maples, none of that
seemed to matter as Stanford rolled to a 100-
69 victory over the Huskies.
Wiggins, who was on an IV yesterday, fa
tigued and suffering from a flu-like illness,
paced the Cardinal with 29 points and was 7-
of-lOon three-pointers.
"I was kind of nervous before the game,
wondering how I was going to start playing
on the court, but I think my competitive na
ture and adrenaline outweighed all that,"
Wiggins said.
The rest of the Cardinal was also slight
ly nervous heading into a weekend in
which they could clinch the Pac-1() regular
season title. However, Wiggins, junior cen
ter Brooke Smith (20 points and 7 re
bounds) and the bench alike all came out
aggressively.
"I hope we play like this every game,"
head coach Tara VanDerveer said. "I think
our team came out really focused, we
worked very hard on defense and we got out
and got good shots."
Wiggins, with seven three-pointers, was
the most explosive, but the team as a whole
posted a season-high .583 field goal per
centage.
"Candice opened it up, [Krista Rappa
hahn] opened it up, and Brooke couldn't be
stopped one-on-one," VanDerveer said. "I
thought Brooke also did a great job of get
ting the ball into Kristen [Newlin], and pass
es were exceptional."
The Cardinal kicked off the night domi
nating from the outside with Wiggins and
Rappahahn having four and three three
pointers, respectively, in the first half Stan
ford rode a 15-0 run to a 27-9 lead by the mid
dle of the half, and closed it out 51-31.
Stanford had a 6-0 run to start the second
half in which the team saw contributions
from all over and extended its lead to as
much as 35. Junior forward Newlin had 10
points in the second half for 12 total, while
freshman forward Jillian Harmon, freshman
guard Rosalyn Gold-Onwude and Rappa
hahn each scored at least seven.
"Many different people helped out,"
VanDerveer said. "I think this has been
there, and I'm glad we found it before the
Pac-10Tournament. I think it points to peo
ple's competitive nature. We want to win the
regular season, and we knew that this game
was a big one."
Stanford lost to Washington in Decem
ber when the Huskies had a 14-0 run in the
second half en route to a 77-72 victory. This
time, the Cardinal were able to control
Washington's leading scorer, junior guard
Cameo Hicks, who had 23 points in the De
cember game and averages 15.0 points per
game. Tonight, she came away with only
eight.
"I think Roz did a great job defensively,
and she worked on Cameo a lot." Van-
Derveer said. "I think a lot of [Hicks'] shots
are offensive boards and we worked hard to
keep her off the offensive board. A lot of her
baskets are transition shots and we worked
hard to not let them get out in a running
game."
All around, the Cardinal have seen
tremendous improvement since the disap
pointing loss, according to VanDerveer.
"Our defense has improved, our re
bounding has improved, our offensive exe
cution is much better, and we're playing
here,"she said."People are playing with con
fidence. We were showing great enthusiasm
and excitement."
The Cardinal are looking at a strong fin
ish to the season, having clinched at least a
share of the Pac-10 crown. They will likely
win the league Saturday against cellar
dwelling Washington State.
