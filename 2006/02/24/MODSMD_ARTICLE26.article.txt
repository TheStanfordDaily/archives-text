### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
In a widely anticipated move,
Stanford yesterday announced
that the Cardinal's Sept. 9 foot
ball game against San Jose State
has been relocated from Stanford
to Spartan Stadium, 20 miles
south. The move provides the
Card an additional week to com
plete construction on the new
stadium.
vv We're extremely pleased
with the progress [of the con
struction] ," interim athletic direc
tor Bill Walsh said on Thursday.
"It's projected to be done on time.
But in moving the San Jose State
game to Spartan Stadium, we feel
it gives us that extra week to as
sure ourselves that the stadium
will be 100 percent ready."
The inaugural game in the $90
million new stadium will now be
the Cardinal's battle with Navy,
scheduled for Sept. 16.

Sept. 2 at Oregon
Sept. 9 at San Jose State
Sept. 16 Navy
Sept.23 Washington State
Sept. 30 at UCLA

Oct. 21 at Arizona State

The Cardinal and Spartans
regularly face off in the presea
son, so to accommodate this
switch, the game scheduled for
the 2008 season will now be a
home game for Stanford.
