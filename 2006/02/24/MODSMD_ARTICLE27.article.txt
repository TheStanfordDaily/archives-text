## Panel highlights plight of many Latino Muslims 
### MIMA MOHAMMED CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While Latinos and Islam may first
appear to be unrelated subjects, yes
terday's panel titled "Hispanos
Musulmanes: Latinos embracing
Islam" highlighted the unique popu
lation of Muslims residing in Latin
American nations and the Caribbean.
The three-person panel, com
prised of members from the organiza
tion "Members of Latino Muslims of
the Bay Area," came to the El Centro
Chicano community center to ad
dress students, with MeCHA and the
Muslim Students Association co
sponsoring the talk.
The panelists focused on the phe
nomenon of young Latinos in major
cities converting to Islam. These new
converts face myriad hurdles in trying
to reconcile their new faith with Latino
cultural backgrounds. The speakers
candidly spoke of their personal strife
in fighting to win acceptance from
their families and friends about the
tenets of the Muslim faith.
The panel was composed of Ale
jandro Hamed. Daniel islam and Issa
Delgadillo. Hamed, a Muslim by birth
but raised in Chile, was the first to
speak. The son of Syrian immigrants,
Hamed made immigration a central
focus of his issue. He traced the roots
of Islamic populations in Latino
countries to the influx of Indian in
dentured servants to the Caribbean
sugar canes in the late 19905. Hamed
also braced the influence of Islam on
Spain as well, reflecting on its effect
on architecture. He addressed the fact
that a lot of Stanford architecture
originated from Spanish and Islamic
influences, as seen in the arches
throughout the Stanford campus.
The second speaker with the coin
cidental name Islam hails from Tijua
na and was raised in a Catholic family.
However, after finding many of the
Catholic rituals insufficient to fulfill
his spiritual thirst, he turned to Islam,
which he found to be more sensible.
Despite his past frustration with his
faith, however, Islam nevertheless ex
pressed a strong respect for the
Catholic community.

"Faith that the Mexicano have
with the Catholic faith is incredible,"
Islam said. "Their faith was so strong,
that they would give their last peso to
people who were poor when in
church."
Delgadillo, who is originally from
Nicaragua but grew up in Los Ange
les, said that converting to Islam
changed his life completely. After a
shameful past of gang activity and ille
gal activity, an old girlfriend of his,
who had converted to Islam earlier,
introduced him to the religion by
bringing him books. Then she also
took him to a mosque, where he was
able to learn from other Muslims.
Since he has become a Muslim, his life
is completely different since he no
longer drinks, as alcoholism is prohib
ited by Islam.
"Since 1 converted, my life from
that moment changed," Delgadillo
said. "My life is very different from
how it once was, it is a lot easier, I have
not had alcohol in over two years."
His mother, however, who is from
a strict Catholic background, still has
trouble coming to terms with her son
being a Muslim, he said.
Audience members were drawn to
the event for different reasons, rang
ing from personal connection to mere
curiosity.
"I was interested in this topic be
cause of friends I had in Texas, where
there is a large Latino population.
This topic of Latinos in Islam is not
understood by a lot of Muslims or
Latinos," said freshman Fatima Has
san, who organized the panel and
presentation.
"This program brought to light the
influence of Islam in our Latino cul
ture that I never realized," said soph
omore Joshua Bogus. "It also high
lighted the difficulty that members of
our community face who are trying to
balance their Latino and Muslim
identifies."
"The talk really intrigued me — I
never realized how connected the his
tories of Islam and Latinos are, and
the personal stories of identity, strug
gle and conversion were truly heart
warming," said MSAN President and
junior Omar Shakir
