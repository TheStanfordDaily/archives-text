It has recently come to our atten
tion there is a segment of the popula
tion — albeit a small one — that does
not believe in the greatness of the cin
ematic masterpiece, "The Mighty
Ducks," released in 1992. To these
wayward folks, we say unto you, "If
'Ducks' is not the greatest movie ever
made, then you should have your eye
balls removed."
Emelio Estevez turn as pee-wee
hockey coach, Gordon Bombay was
unfortunately looked over by the Os
cars. but not by our hearts. He strad
dles the fine line between authoritari
an father figure and hardcore puck kil
lah, a hero for the ages. Yet, despite
his magnificence, he's not even the
greatest part of the film.
The greatest part, of course, is the
single sports move that has transcend-

Ed film into the political world. The
aptly titled "Knuckle-puck" was the
perfect allegory for the recently un
harnessed power of the United States.
In the aftermath of the fall of the
Berlin wall, the Western world was
unchallenged in the international
arena, but the "Knuckle-puck" taught
us that though we had this amazing
power, we had to learn to control it for
it he effective. Is "The Mighty Ducks"
a shallow story about kids playing
hockey? I think not.
Also, on a different note, it has
come to Betsy's attention that there is
an unwarranted hatred of New York
and its baseball team, the Yankees. Of
course, everyone else tends to agree
that the Yankees are demon spawn
from the darkest pits of the under
world, where happiness is burned
away by the fires of unbridled hatred,
but Betsy says otherwise.
Oh, snap. We totally forgot it was
parent's weekend. So, umm, hi Mom.

Sorry about this issue, we don't usual
ly print such filth. (Shhhh..., no one say
a word and she won't know we're
lying.)
