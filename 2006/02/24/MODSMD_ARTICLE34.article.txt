## Don't Mess With the best...cause the best don't mess 
### LOREN NEWMAN INTERMISSION GREEN GOAT 
You are a kid; you love movies and you love sports. You'd think
that all these things wrapped up into one would constitute some
thing truly great, like an omelet or a United Nations kegger. But
you'd be wrong. With very few exceptions, the world of children's
sports movies is a world of shameless racketeering and general
badness.

Now I know a lot of you are saying, "But there are a lot of real
ly good sports movies I loved as a kid, jerk!" Well let me ask you
this: have you seen those movies lately? The more of them you see

again as a reasonable non-kid person, the more you

realize that when you were a child, some
one could have taken a baseball-shaped
dump and you would have stared at it for

hours, just on principle. Know
ing this, all the cinema execs

decided to give the kiddies

the artistic shaft around the

late 80s.
It is an outrage. Have
you watched "The Big

Green" when you

weren't eight

years old? Not only is the entire picture filmed with inferior equip
ment, but the premise is cliche and obviously not the product of an
appropriate amount of thought. The film did not garner a single
positive review nationwide. 1 think it's downright indecent how
filmmakers skimped and continue to skimp on children's films —

especially sports films — simply because they knew we couldn't
tell the difference. Well, 1 can tell the difference now, damnit, and
1 want my crumpled up, smelly, lawn-mowing money back. This is
murder. "The Big Green" grossed nearly $18 million dollars do
mestically because all of a sudden it was okay to exploit the most

impressionable age-demographic in America. Don't even get

me started about "Little Giants" or "The Mighty Ducks."
What about the original BBC "The Chronicles of Nar-

nia?" I loved those movies as a child. With Reepicheep owning

people, Asian regulating Godfather style (allegory intended),and
all these really awesome visual effects, it was hard not to watch all

wide-eyed with drool coming out of your mouth. Even the orig-

inal score was good.

But alas, to watch those same films in maturity.

The horror and the pain, the utter disappoint-

ment! First of all, the animal costumes are

complete crap, the snow is superimposed

on the actual film in post-production and

the actors are bad — really bad. I couldn't believe it. It's painfully
obvious that the films were budgeted less money than most college
beer runs. It feels like a part of my childhood has been snatched
away, all because some British television suits didn't want to make
films that would stand the test of time.

This is not to say that all children's movies are bad. Most
notably in the sports genre there are some shining exam
ples of films that were genuinely classics. When I think
back on films like "Angels in the Outfield," it's amazing
t to think how good they were. By developing all these rel

evant themes of family val

ues, racial and gender

equality, "Angels" estab
lishes itself as quality chil
dren's cinema, along with

"The Sandlot." Speaking of

"Sandlot," it has to be at

least 10,000 times

better than "Rook

Ie of the Year."

That little snot
nosed kid with the

broken arm can
say "Funky Butt-j
loving" as many

times as he wants, but will he ever be able to match the pool scene,
the s'more scene and the Great Bambino scene? No, not in a mil
lion years. Can you say "unrealistic premise?" (Sorry to poach on
someone else's territory, but I have strong feelings.)
But this brings me to another important point about children's
films and shameless profit hounding: the dreaded sequel. C'mon
folks, after "Aladdin II" and "Aladdin III," "Peter Pan II",
"Mulan II," "Pocahontas II," "Cinderella II," "The Hunchback of
Notre Dame II," "The Little Mermaid II," "The Lion King 1 1/2"
and "II," "The Sandlot II" (sacrilege!), and the upcoming "Bambi
II," it becomes clear, nay, blatantly obvious, that these films were
not made to further the beloved stories in any real way. They were
made, brace yourselves, so some rich executive could go on vaca
tion to shoot zebras and patronize prostitutes. So what are you to
do, now that all your juvenile memories are being used to subsidize
some trollop on a Zebra hunting expedition? I don't know. Do
what I do: pretend you're a robot from the future and that you
were never young. Solves everything.

Notre Dame II," "The Little Mermaid II," "The Lion King 1 1/2"
and "II," "The Sandlot II" (sacrilege!), and the upcoming "Bambi
II," it becomes clear, nay, blatantly obvious, that these films were
not made to further the beloved stories in any real way. They were
made, brace yourselves, so some rich executive could go on vaca
tion to shoot zebras and patronize prostitutes. So what are you to
do, now that all your juvenile memories are being used to subsidize
some trollop on a Zebra hunting expedition? I don't know. Do
what I do: pretend you're a robot from the future and that you
were never young. Solves everything.
