# "Sandlot" out hits "Rookie" in showdown
## 
### MATTY SMITH INTERMISSION L-7 WEENIE 
Ah, baseball. The Great American Pastime. The sport that
' brought us Babe Ruth, a nationally shared hatred for New York
and the disastrous tragedy that was 1979s Disco Demolition
Night. But baseball's most significant contribution to American
history has come in the form of some of the greatest family films
ever made. ; -
From "Little Big League" to "A Kid iu King Arthur's
Court,"the Awesome Baseball Family Film genre has been
snubbed by high-profile awards ceremonies for years. "Forrest
Gump" beats out ensemble-powered classic "Major League II"
for Best Picture? Get your head in the game. Oscars. No won
der nobody respects you Anymore. And Matt Leßlanc definite
ly deserved at least a nomination for his performance in "Ed."
But two films stand far above the rest. Two films that define
greatness. Two films that stand the test of time better than any
other film — better than "Casablanca," belter than "Citizen
Kane," even better than "Ferris Bueller's Day Off." Two films
that will make you wonder if Shakespeare, Faulkner and
Goethe had come back to life to create two of the finest master
works the world has ever known. If you haven't guessed the
: 112 ilms by now, then you are a sorry sod. Those classics are " Rook
ie of the Year" and"The Sandlot." The only question that re
mains regarding their merits: which is better?
Both have a lot going for them. Hilarious, touching and ever
poignant, they remain testament to the triumph of human spir

it in the face of adversity—or. in the case of the films, a crazy
bearded Yankee slugger and a giant dog. They improve with
each viewing, as each subtle acting nuance, each witty line of di
alogue and each carefully calculated direction becomes more
impressive each time they are seen. Now, we have a job to do:
analyze to see which film is superior and thus quite possibly the
greatest film ever made.
We'll start with the plots of the two. "Rookie of the Year"
tells the tale of a young man who, upon slipping on a baseball (a
warning of the recklessness of youth from writer Sam Harper),
is forced to wear a cast, tightening his tendons. Suddenly, he
possesses a super-strong arm capable of throwing a fastball 105
miles per hour and is drafted by the Chicago Cubs. "The Sand
lot" features a more personal, heartwarming, even humanistic
story of a young man who discovers baseball one summer when
he accidentally hits his (possibly abusive) stepfather's auto
graphed baseball into the perilous backyard of a psychotic blind
man played by James Earl Jones. "Rookie" definitely wins as
far as reliving childhood fantasies goes, but I'll be darned if I
ever hear Darth Vader's voice again without thinking of the
dread invoked by Jones' turn in "Sandlot."
Next is the issue of lead protagonist. "Rookie's" Henry
Rowengartner ("American Pie's" Thomas lan Nicholas) is the
kid you wanted and probably still wanl to be. He's just so cool.
Look at how he gels his hair. He's like a younger, sexier, more
athletic Zack Morris. "The Sandlot's" Scotty Smalls (Tom
Guiry, who was in an episode of "Law and Order: SVU"), on
the other hand, is the hyper-annoying kid in fifth grade that you

not only hated but weren't ashamed of hating. He's a total
square. An L-7 weenie. Henry would totally beat this kid up if
they ever met. And I hope they do. "Rookie" clearly wins here.
Both excel at integrating social commentary into their sto
ries. Henry's mom's boyfriend represents corporate greed at its
slimiest. His coach's inability to pronounce his name ("GAR
DENHOSAH!")represents our nation's all-too-real adult illit
eracy problem. But nothing compares to the brutal honesty of
"The Sandlot's" attack on America's history of misogyny rep
resented by Hamilton "Ham" Porter's insult, "You play ball
like a girl." Thirteen years later, it still stings.
Then comes the category of supporting cast, ultimately the
deciding factor. Sure, "Rookie" has a pre-psychosis Gary Busev
and Darnel Stern at his zaniest. But nothing compares to "Sand
lot's" roster: the insightful sexual deviant Squints, the sympa
thetic mentally challenged Yeah-Yeah, the unforgettable
Benny Rodriguez. Even Denis Leary appears, which would be
a fault were it not for the fact that he beans the annoying main
kid in the eye with a baseball. Only "The Mighty Ducks" can
compete with "Sandlot" as far as film ensembles go.
In the end, "The Sandlot" wins- the cast is just too good, too
charming, too sweet. "Rookie of the Year" makes a great case,
but it lacks the depth and humanity that "Sandlot" is all too
happy to provide. It's hardly fair, because "Sandlot" would win
for its legendary "s'more" and "FOR-EV-ER" tree house scene
alone. For a complete experience, watch both. But if you have
to choose one, it's gotta be a night with Squints, Benny. Ham, i
The Beast and"The Sandlot."

poignant, they remain testament to the triumph of human spir

it in the face of adversity—or. in the case of the films, a crazy
bearded Yankee slugger and a giant dog. They improve with
each viewing, as each subtle acting nuance, each witty line of di
alogue and each carefully calculated direction becomes more
impressive each time they are seen. Now, we have a job to do:
analyze to see which film is superior and thus quite possibly the
greatest film ever made.
We'll start with the plots of the two. "Rookie of the Year"
tells the tale of a young man who, upon slipping on a baseball (a
warning of the recklessness of youth from writer Sam Harper),
is forced to wear a cast, tightening his tendons. Suddenly, he
possesses a super-strong arm capable of throwing a fastball 105
miles per hour and is drafted by the Chicago Cubs. "The Sand
lot" features a more personal, heartwarming, even humanistic
story of a young man who discovers baseball one summer when
he accidentally hits his (possibly abusive) stepfather's auto
graphed baseball into the perilous backyard of a psychotic blind
man played by James Earl Jones. "Rookie" definitely wins as
far as reliving childhood fantasies goes, but I'll be darned if I
ever hear Darth Vader's voice again without thinking of the
dread invoked by Jones' turn in "Sandlot."
Next is the issue of lead protagonist. "Rookie's" Henry
Rowengartner ("American Pie's" Thomas lan Nicholas) is the
kid you wanted and probably still wanl to be. He's just so cool.
Look at how he gels his hair. He's like a younger, sexier, more
athletic Zack Morris. "The Sandlot's" Scotty Smalls (Tom
Guiry, who was in an episode of "Law and Order: SVU"), on
the other hand, is the hyper-annoying kid in fifth grade that you

not only hated but weren't ashamed of hating. He's a total
square. An L-7 weenie. Henry would totally beat this kid up if
they ever met. And I hope they do. "Rookie" clearly wins here.
Both excel at integrating social commentary into their sto
ries. Henry's mom's boyfriend represents corporate greed at its
slimiest. His coach's inability to pronounce his name ("GAR
DENHOSAH!")represents our nation's all-too-real adult illit
eracy problem. But nothing compares to the brutal honesty of
"The Sandlot's" attack on America's history of misogyny rep
resented by Hamilton "Ham" Porter's insult, "You play ball
like a girl." Thirteen years later, it still stings.
Then comes the category of supporting cast, ultimately the
deciding factor. Sure, "Rookie" has a pre-psychosis Gary Busev
and Darnel Stern at his zaniest. But nothing compares to "Sand
lot's" roster: the insightful sexual deviant Squints, the sympa
thetic mentally challenged Yeah-Yeah, the unforgettable
Benny Rodriguez. Even Denis Leary appears, which would be
a fault were it not for the fact that he beans the annoying main
kid in the eye with a baseball. Only "The Mighty Ducks" can
compete with "Sandlot" as far as film ensembles go.
In the end, "The Sandlot" wins- the cast is just too good, too
charming, too sweet. "Rookie of the Year" makes a great case,
but it lacks the depth and humanity that "Sandlot" is all too
happy to provide. It's hardly fair, because "Sandlot" would win
for its legendary "s'more" and "FOR-EV-ER" tree house scene
alone. For a complete experience, watch both. But if you have
to choose one, it's gotta be a night with Squints, Benny. Ham, i
The Beast and"The Sandlot."
