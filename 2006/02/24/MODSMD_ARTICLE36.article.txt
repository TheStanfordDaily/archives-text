# Hot groupies!

### ALEX GYR INTERMISSION GROUPIE HUNTAH 
While rock star groupies garner most of the aftention. rabid,
lustful fans make their presence fell in the sports world as well.
Oddly enough, there is a class of people who are looking to
hook up with athletes for the lone reason that they are. in fact,
athletes. They form a strange and mysterious group and are cu-

riously turned on by sweaty, oversized men.
To my knowledge this breed of fans is rare here at Stanford.

Whether or not that is a positive is up to you, but one thing is
certain — compared to the other groupie environments

around the Pac-10conference, Stanford looks like a nunnery.
During the past two years. I have had the pleasure of trav
eling up and down the West Coast covering football and

men's basketball for both'lhe Dailyand other media outlets,
'lliis has given me a chance to get a feel for the quality and
quantity of groupies at various schools in the Pac-10. The
number of people huddled outside the home locker rooms
after games, waiting for the team to emerge, never fails to
amaze me.
This amazing trend got me thinking. Someone needs

~l cr- r —

to compile a list of schools have the best, the most and the ea
gerest groupies. So here you are sports fans.
Note: These rankings are based both on my personal

experience as a casual observer and input from various Stan
ford athletes. Most of the data I've collected comes from out
v side locker rooms after men's basketball games. The order
\ is established by quantity and attractiveness of groupies
vs. attractiveness of players as well as just the vibe given

off by the groupies.
(Editor's note: We don't get it either. But then again, we 're not
fiieking rocket scientists. Well, Betsy is.)

1. Arizona —This turned out to be a hit of an upset, but they truly
earned the number one spot. Pair a good basketball team with a
school full of attractive people and you have a recipe for great jersey
chasers. 1 was astonished by the number of very attractive girls who

were milling around in the hall outside the Wildcat locker room fol
lowing an Arizona win over Stanford at McKale Arena last spring.

Arizona gets bonus points for the fact that the groupies made it to
the locker room, in spite of a formidable security force — this def-

initely shows some initiative. As we saw once again this weekend,
Arizona is a team comprised of fairly unattractive guys. I doubt

1 lassan Adams and Ivan Radenovic would be lady-killers without the
help of a solid post game.

2. Oregon Slate — Another shocker. When I was talking to

an anonymous Stanford athlete before my trip to Cor
vallis. he told me. "Oregon State has got bitches."
While I don't necessarily agree with his phrasing, 1 have
to admit that 1 was impressed by the quality of the

Beaver's groupies. 'ITicy were well-behaved, pa
tiently waiting on the court for the players to come
out of the locker room after the game, which earns
them points for dedication. But this fact also makes
them lose points in the creativity category. Hie fan
base overall was above my expectations (it is the
only school where I have ever been personally heck-

led. Someone was kind enough to tell me that, "KZSU sucks!") which boosts the

groupies to the top part of this list.

3. UCLA — Filling the third spot was a tough choice. Oregon. Washington and Arizona State all
competed for this position, but the nod has to go to UCLA for the dedication of the fans, overall at-

tractiveness of the student body and overall ugliness of the play
ers. I won't go player by player, but I will say that there are cer
tain members of the Bruins squad who make Adams look like
Brad Pitt. You've got to give UdA's fans credit for hanging

in there, 'ltiey also powered ahead of their LA rivals, USC,

by virtue of actually showing up to basketball and football

games, even when their team is down.
