## HOOKIN' UP ON AND OFF THE COURT 
### WHITNEY SADO INTERMISSION HOOKUP EXPERT 
The Intermission editors assigned me to
write about "the best sports-movie hookups."
I think this is because they know how much I
love a good sports movie. I think this is also
because they know how much I love a good
hookup. Regardless of what their motivations
were or why they told me to "just draw from
your own experience" when I asked for sug
gestions, here are my top 10 in no particular
order at all:
1. •Bull Durham" (1988): A movie centered
Dn a minor league baseball groupie is bound
to have a good hookup scene or two. My per
sonal favorite from this film is the scene when,
with 10 minutes to go before his professional
pitching debut, Nuke LaLoosh's (Tim Rob
bins) manager catches him screwing the
daughter of the Durham Bulls' owner in the
team locker room. Chastised for not having
warmed up yet, Nuke retorts that he still has
10 minutes and resumes his, ahem, "warming
up."
2. "Friday Night Lights" (2004): One of the
most memorable scenes from this movie
about high school football in small-town
Texas occurs when Don Billingsley (Garrett
-> Hedlund) and a girl he brought home from a
party are going at it, both half-naked, on the
living room couch. Don's alcoholic father (a
brilliant and balding Tim McGraw) walks in

completely smashed and lecherously watches
unnoticed. He finally lewdly tells the girl that
she's grown up. and then grabs his son and

duct-tapes a football to his hand as punish-

ment for a mistake Don made during the
game earlier that night. He leaves the two

teenagers to figure out what to do next with
their hormones and a footballed hand.

3. "Varsity Blues" (1999): Another small-

town Texas high school football flick, this
one with Dawson Leery (James Van Der
Beek) playing second-string quarterback Jon
"Mox" Moxson, who becomes Mr. Popular

when he gets the chance to start. With pop-

ularity comesrffex, and Mox arrives at the

head cheerleader's house one night

to find her waiting ror him wear
ing nothing but minimal

whipped cream. Obviously they
start to hook up, but then Mox
— : who already has-a girlfriend

— gets all Dawson-self-

righteous on us and
stops them from going
any further. Anti-cli-

mactic, sure, but still a

great scene.
4. "Summer Catch" (2001):
How do you seduce a Cape
Cod League baseball play
er (or any guy, for that mat
ter)? Stand over him while
holding a beer bottle be
tween your knees, and

skillfully pour the brew into his mouth. Then
straddle his lap in your micro-shorts and try to

take off his shirt. When he feeds

you some bull about swearing off

women and beer for the season.

show some more cleavage.

You're in. Enjoy the sleeping-

bag sex on one of Cape Cod's

storied baseball fields — Brit-

tany Murphy and Freddie

Prinze, Jr. certainly appear to like it

in this movie.

5. "Love and Basketball" (2000): Two

words: strip basketball. Genius. Mon
ica Wright (Sanaa Lathan) and Quin-

cy McCall (Omar Epps), both bas
ketball players for USC, make good

use of the basketball hoop

in his dorm room.

Quincy loses the

game and gets

naked first, but

doesn't seem to

mind when they

begin making out

against the wall.

6. "Happy Gilmore"

(1996): 1 can be a fan of
cute and chaste
hookups, too, and this is

one of the most adorably

cheesy. Bashfully trying

to woo pro golf tour PR

rep Virginia (Julie Bowen).

failed hockey player Happy Gilmore (Adam
Sandler) dares Virginia to shoot a puck into
the goal when they are alone together at an ice
rink. If she misses, she has to kiss him. Natu
rally, she makes the shot but still chooses to
kiss him, while some random guy at the rink
lip-synchs to "Endless Love" in the back
ground. Creepy, yet touching.
7. "Bend it Like Beckham" (2002): Again,
nothing too scandalous, but there's something
titillating about a coach making out with one
of his players. Joe (Jonathan Rhys Myers) and
Jess (Parminder Nagra) kiss at the film's end,
finally acting on long-pent-up feelings and
validating all those coach-crushes I had grow
ing up.
8. "Rocky" (1976): In a victory for awkward
misfits everywhere, self-conscious Adrian
(Talia Shire) is clearly uncomfortable when
alone with beefy boxer Rocky Balboa
(Sylvester Stallone). She admits that she has
never been in a man's apartment before and
tries to leave. Rocky intercepts her, asking her
to remove her glasses so he can see her "real
ly nice eyes." Next, he asks her to take off her
winter hat; when she does, he says, "1 always
knew you was pretty." Of course, they hook
up then, but it's a tentative kiss at first —
Adrian clearly doesn't know what to do until
instinct kicks in and they fall to the floor
wrapped up in each other's arms and tongues.

9. "Jerry Maguire" (1996): Explicit sex? Check.
Sports agent Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) stands
with his back to a bookshelf while giving fiancee
Avery (Kelly Preston) such a ride that she has to
grab onto it in order to, um, stay on. Tossed about
and clearly enjoying it, Avery actually breaks park
of the bookshelf with the intensity of her passion.
Then, the two feed each other strawberries while
naked. Overall, a charmingly wholesome and fami
ly oriented scene.
10. "The Sandlot" (1993): Though it (fortunately)
never develops into a full-fledged hookup, the CPR
scene is nonetheless an iconic one. Eleven-vear-old

"Squints" Palledorous (Chauncey Leopardi) takes
a break from his summer spent playing baseball on
the neighborhood sandlot to fake his drowning and
con luscious lifeguard Wendy Peffercorn (Marley
Shelton) into performing mouth-to-mouth on him.
Then he does, according to the film's narrator, "the
most desperate thing any of us had ever seen" — he
kisses Wendy, allowing us to vicariously live our
childhood fantasy of making out with that older
girl/guy who first opened our eyes to the purely hy
pothetical joys of hooking up. Oh, how far we've
come since those days of youthful inexperience. ..al
though it might just be me.
