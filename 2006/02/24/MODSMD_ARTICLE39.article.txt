Intermission listened to every
soundtrack for Mgry sports movie
ever made until our ears rang like a
buzzer to uncover the best of the best
of the worst.
Space Jam — Remember when K, k
Kelly used to inspire children instead 1
of having sex and urinating on them?
"I Believe I Can Fly" was probably
the most abused karaoke song of
1996. However, for those of us in our
twenties, it came out at a time when
lyrics lijke "If I can see it, then I can do
it/If 1 just believe it, there's nothing to
it" really meant something. The song
did go on to win three Grammys and
to this day still gives Intermission
I goose bumps. The rest of the sound
track is well-worth revisiting, with a
quality cover of "Fly Like an Eagle"
by Seal and another heart-tugger with
Monica's "For You 1 Will." And you
can't forget the theme song "Space

Jam." If "Wave your hands in the air
if you feel fine/We're gonna take it
into overtime/Welcome to the Space
Jam" doesn't get you pumped, then
you obviously led a deprived child
hood.

Nancy Wilson makes her requisite
appearance*, but the highlight on the
album is Bruce Springsteen's "Secret
Garden." Okay, so this isn't
that will put you in a mindset to throw
a long-ball, but it is one of the most
beautiful songs The Boss has pro

duced, and elevated the soundtrack
to a musical must-have. j

standout tracks. The
songs highlight each band at their
best: Guys Finish Last" cap
tiffes Green Day's more humorous
side — before they became seriously
political — while still maintaining top
musicianship. And. everyone needs a
song for those times when they miss
the winning field goal. "Hero"
doesn't veer too far from the Foo

Fighter's norm, but you hear some
thing new every time, from the ele
gant drum beat to the melodies. Plus,
we all have heroes, right? Yes, that
was shameless attempt at pulling on
your heartstrings.
Dirty Dancing — What a good I
movie. And if you don't think it qual
ifies as a sports movie, you should try
doing those lifts. Dancing is not easy,
man. And, it captures Patrick Swayze
before botox. Most of the soundtrack
is just okay, with the exception of
Jennifer Warnes "I've Had the Time
of My Life," the quintessential we're
moving-on-but-let's-be-friends-for-
ever tune. Whether you're ending a
sports season, or a summer fling that
changed your life, we can all appreci
ate the sentiment.
Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights
— You thought one "Dirty Danc
ing" could possibly he enough? The
soundtrack to "Havana Nights" is
approximately fifty million times
better than the movie. From Yerba
Buena's "Guajira (1 Love U 2
Much)" to Black Eyed Pea's "Dirty

Dancing" and Orisha's "Repre
sent, Cuba," the intensity of the
l.atin beats makes you want to
dance, so we here at Intermission
recommend you take this sound
track to the gym with you. Or down
to the local Salsa Bar where you
will be outdanced and outsexed.
