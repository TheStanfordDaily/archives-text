# WASHINGTON WHOOPING
## Stanford's "Big Three" struggle as guards commit 17 of 18 Card TOs 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
SEATTLE. Wash. — For 11 minutes on
Thursday night, it looked like
Stanford would be able to hang with the frantic
pace set by the No. 17 Washington Huskies —
they trailed by just one.
But then, Washington senior Mike Jensen
took the game into his own hands.
And in a game that Stanford badly needed
to win to keep themselves in the playoff hunt,
the Card put up one of their worst overall ef
forts of the Pac-10 season, losing 75-57.
The No. 17 Huskies (21-5,10-5 Pac-10) con

trolled the pace through the entire game.
When the visiting Cardinal (13-11, 9-6) had
the ball, Washington played active and solid
defense. Offensively. Washington shot excep
tionally well from the outside, especially in the
first half.
Indeed, the Cardinal could find no answer to
the Huskies' perimeter game — Washington
started 7-of-10 to hit 8-of-l 3 deep in the first pe
riod. Most surprising was the outside shooting
of 6-foot-8 Jensen, who hit five of his first seven
three-point attempts, and scored nine of the
Huskies' first 11 points.
Jensen finished with 18 points on 6-of-8
shooting (all three-pointers), a new career high.
The Card big men continually failed to step up
to the perimeter in time when he had the ball,
leading to open look after open look.
