# WASHINGTON WHOOPING
## Stanford's "Big Three" struggle as guards commit 17 of 18 Card TOs 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
SEATTLE. Wash. — For 11 minutes on
Thursday night, it looked like
Stanford would be able to hang with the frantic
pace set by the No. 17 Washington Huskies —
they trailed by just one.
But then, Washington senior Mike Jensen
took the game into his own hands.
And in a game that Stanford badly needed
to win to keep themselves in the playoff hunt,
the Card put up one of their worst overall ef
forts of the Pac-10 season, losing 75-57.
The No. 17 Huskies (21-5,10-5 Pac-10) con

trolled the pace through the entire game.
When the visiting Cardinal (13-11, 9-6) had
the ball, Washington played active and solid
defense. Offensively. Washington shot excep
tionally well from the outside, especially in the
first half.
Indeed, the Cardinal could find no answer to
the Huskies' perimeter game — Washington
started 7-of-10 to hit 8-of-l 3 deep in the first pe
riod. Most surprising was the outside shooting
of 6-foot-8 Jensen, who hit five of his first seven
three-point attempts, and scored nine of the
Huskies' first 11 points.
Jensen finished with 18 points on 6-of-8
shooting (all three-pointers), a new career high.
The Card big men continually failed to step up
to the perimeter in time when he had the ball,
leading to open look after open look.
"He's a capable shooter, you
have to give him credit," Stanford
head coach Trent Johnson said. "He
played better than he has all season
long. He got them off to a good
start."
Jensen has hurt the Cardinal in
the past as well, tallying a then-best
17 points the last time Stanford was
in Seattle in January 2(X)5.
And Jensen found plenty of help
from his teammates. In a critical
stretch, in which the Huskies ex
tended their one-point lead to 10
with 7:27 left in the first half, Joel
Smith hit back-to-back shots from
long range.
As a team, the Huskies shot a
blistering 55.6 percent from the
three-point line, and a solid 42.6 per
cent overall. In contrast, the Cardi
nal struggled to just 36.5 percent for
the game, and an abysmal 21.4 per
cent from long-range.
While Jensen carried the load in
the first half, senior guard Brandon
Roy provided the spark in the sec
ond. Washington's leading scorer
contributed 16 second-half points
en route to 23 overall, marking his
eighth consecutive game of over 20
points.
Stanford's sloppy play on offense
only augmented their defensive dif
ficulties. The Cardinal finished the
game with 18 turnovers to Washing
ton's 10.
And even when Stanford hung
onto the ball, the results weren't
much better. Senior guard Chris
Hernandez finished with just 9
points on 2-of-13 shooting from the
field and hitting just l-of-6 from
three-point range. Senior forward
Matt Haryasz struggled as well, tal
lying a team-high of just 10.
"I didn't make plays," Hernan
dez said. "They did a good job of ro
tating and doubling and mixing it up.
The bottom line is we didn't make
plays."
Senior guard Dan Grunfeld
missed his first start of the season
due to the flu, and played just two
minutes in the contest. Given
Haryasz's and Hernandez's strug
gles, Grunfeld's absence placed the
offensive burden squarely on the
shoulders of the team's younger
players.
"It is not going to be one guy who

has to step up offensively, it is going
to be a number of guys," Johnson
said. "We have to have some guys
step up and make open shots. Matt is
getting double-teamed and getting
frustrated at times, but he's kicking
the ball out for open shots. They're
running guys at Chris and he's pass
ing off for open shots. But, you've
got to knock them down."
Sophomore center Peter Prowitt
chipped in 10 points and freshman
Anthony Goods had eight, but there
was no doubt the Cardinal missed
their big scorers.

Stanford stayed within striking
distance until the end, but never led
in the contest. After the 17-minute
mark in the second half, the Card
faced a double-digit deficit for the
rest of the game.
For the fifth straight game, Stan
ford struggled to match its oppo
nents' intensity out of the halftime
locker room. After sophomore Tim
Morris's tip-in started the period,
Washington responded with an 8-2
run to push the lead to 15 points, 47-
32. Stanford had not trailed by that
many in any game since 2005.
SEATTLE. Wash. — For 11 minutes on
Thursday night, it looked like
Stanford would be able to hang with the frantic
pace set by the No. 17 Washington Huskies —
they trailed by just one.
But then, Washington senior Mike Jensen
took the game into his own hands.
And in a game that Stanford badly needed
to win to keep themselves in the playoff hunt,
the Card put up one of their worst overall ef
forts of the Pac-10 season, losing 75-57.
The No. 17 Huskies (21-5,10-5 Pac-10) con

trolled the pace through the entire game.
When the visiting Cardinal (13-11, 9-6) had
the ball, Washington played active and solid
defense. Offensively. Washington shot excep
tionally well from the outside, especially in the
first half.
Indeed, the Cardinal could find no answer to
the Huskies' perimeter game — Washington
started 7-of-10 to hit 8-of-l 3 deep in the first pe
riod. Most surprising was the outside shooting
of 6-foot-8 Jensen, who hit five of his first seven
three-point attempts, and scored nine of the
Huskies' first 11 points.
Jensen finished with 18 points on 6-of-8
shooting (all three-pointers), a new career high.
The Card big men continually failed to step up
to the perimeter in time when he had the ball,
leading to open look after open look.
"He's a capable shooter, you
have to give him credit," Stanford
head coach Trent Johnson said. "He
played better than he has all season
long. He got them off to a good
start."
Jensen has hurt the Cardinal in
the past as well, tallying a then-best
17 points the last time Stanford was
in Seattle in January 2(X)5.
And Jensen found plenty of help
from his teammates. In a critical
stretch, in which the Huskies ex
tended their one-point lead to 10
with 7:27 left in the first half, Joel
Smith hit back-to-back shots from
long range.
As a team, the Huskies shot a
blistering 55.6 percent from the
three-point line, and a solid 42.6 per
cent overall. In contrast, the Cardi
nal struggled to just 36.5 percent for
the game, and an abysmal 21.4 per
cent from long-range.
While Jensen carried the load in
the first half, senior guard Brandon
Roy provided the spark in the sec
ond. Washington's leading scorer
contributed 16 second-half points
en route to 23 overall, marking his
eighth consecutive game of over 20
points.
Stanford's sloppy play on offense
only augmented their defensive dif
ficulties. The Cardinal finished the
game with 18 turnovers to Washing
ton's 10.
And even when Stanford hung
onto the ball, the results weren't
much better. Senior guard Chris
Hernandez finished with just 9
points on 2-of-13 shooting from the
field and hitting just l-of-6 from
three-point range. Senior forward
Matt Haryasz struggled as well, tal
lying a team-high of just 10.
"I didn't make plays," Hernan
dez said. "They did a good job of ro
tating and doubling and mixing it up.
The bottom line is we didn't make
plays."
Senior guard Dan Grunfeld
missed his first start of the season
due to the flu, and played just two
minutes in the contest. Given
Haryasz's and Hernandez's strug
gles, Grunfeld's absence placed the
offensive burden squarely on the
shoulders of the team's younger
players.
"It is not going to be one guy who

has to step up offensively, it is going
to be a number of guys," Johnson
said. "We have to have some guys
step up and make open shots. Matt is
getting double-teamed and getting
frustrated at times, but he's kicking
the ball out for open shots. They're
running guys at Chris and he's pass
ing off for open shots. But, you've
got to knock them down."
Sophomore center Peter Prowitt
chipped in 10 points and freshman
Anthony Goods had eight, but there
was no doubt the Cardinal missed
their big scorers.
