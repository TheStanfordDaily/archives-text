## Roxy plays with balls and more... 
### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION SPORTS GODDESS 
As the ladies ot Ihe Jersey Chasers Facebook group know, there is nothing
hotter than an athlete. So. as a tribute to the greatest sport of all — jersey chas
ing—Roxy has compHed a sweet little list of the hottest athletes and why
they'll give you a rockin' good time in bed. Disclaimer: Obviously any athlete
is hot, but Roxy had the difficult task of deciding which ones were the hottest.
So, it you didn't make the list, it doesn't mean that Roxy wouldn't bang you —
because she would! So, on to the top 5...
5. Volleyball players are oh- so- hot! To prove it, just watch the beach volley
ball scene in "Top Gun." A shirtless Val Kilmer is a thing of beauty. With their
bodies glistening in the sun, playing with their balls, high-five-ing each other...
I mean, what's not to like? Actually any athletes with balls are hot, but when
volleyball players dive for that ball, Roxy just wants to shout "Hey baby, you
can dive on me anytime!" Damn that sand is so lucky!
4. Soccer players — These guys are beautiful. Just look at David Beckham.
No man in the world can get away with changing his look as much as this man
does. Soccer is also like a religion all over the world. So as soccer players,
they're automatically like gods among mortals. Roxy personally admires their
legs and the fact that they tend to rip off their shirts in the middle of the field.
Oh baby, they totally bring new meaning to sex on legs! Roxy might just have
to give them a red card — to her room.
3. Football players — Football players are great because you get a whole
spectrum of bodies. If you like them lean but buff, quarterbacks and wide re
ceivers are great. Hell, they can throw Roxy around any day. You also know
that quarterbacks have great aim. so they'll never miss. Linebackers are phe
nomenal if you like big boys. These guys won't mind getting down and dirty
with you. Also, Roxy personally knows that because of the aggressive nature of
football, they all like it rough. Yummy!
2. Baseball players — It is America's other favorite pastime after all — the
first one being sex... obviously! Merging the two is like a multiple orgasm —
Roxy will take that everyday! If you won't take Roxy's word for it, just watch
"Bull Durham" — baseball and sex did some great things for Crash. Honestly,
who knew hitting a little ball with a stick could create such great bodies, but
baseball players do have some great ones, and they love to show it with those
tight pants. Baseball players never strike out in my book; they can slide into
Roxy's home base anytime!
1. Swimmers & Water Polo players — Now we've finally reached number I.
Roxy may be a little biased in this respect, but honestly swimmers are the
hottest. They have the best bodies — long, lean, and chiseled — and they show
it off, these boys aren't afraid of exposing EVERYTHING in those teeny
Speedos. On top of that, they're all tan — no pastiness for them...rawr! How
ever, don't take Roxy's word for it, according to Playboy magazine, "Swimmers
and water polo players are great lovers. Their strong hip flexors and abdominal
muscles give them stamina that helps maintain a very enjoyable rhythm in the
bedroom." And Time magazine states: "Because of physiological changes in
certain hormone producing metabolic pathways during aerobic and anaerobic
exercise, swimmers are the most sexually active athletes." Roxy didn't develop
a swimmer-boy radar for nothing.
There you have it, now go to some games and nail yourself a hot athlete. If
you'll excuse me, Roxy must go do some jersey chasing. Oh swimmer boy, let's
go skinny dipping!
