# Review threatens legal action
## Publication may sue University if current door-to-door distribution policy is not changed 
### GERRY SHIH SENIOR STAFF- WRITER 
The ongoing debate regarding the University's door-to-door distri
bution policy reached a sudden flash point last Monday, Feb. 13, when
an attorney representing a group of students led by The Stanford Re
view threatened the University with legal action if it does not "elimi
nate the door-to-door ban or at least consider a compromise."
The letter, written by Denver-based attorney Robert Corry Jr. and
addressed to President John Hennessy, Vice Provost Greg Boardman
and General Counsel Debra Zumwalt, was made public when it was
published on the front page of The Review on the following Friday,
Feb. 17. In an email sent to The Daily on Thursday night, Senior Assis
tant to the President Jeff Wachtel did not mention whether or not the
issue would be settled in court, but maintained that "Stanford's rules
are reasonable and protect students from unwanted intrusions in their
private living spaces, while protecting the right of all student publica
tions to express their views, whatever they may be, and to distribute
those publications widely and publicly on campus."
Wachtel added that Zumwalt had responded to Corry directly on
behalf of the University.
Under Stanford's current policy, publications are by default pro
hibited from distributing material door-to-door, unless a particular
dorm "opts-in" through vote or a decision made by the resident fellow
(RF). However. ASSU Senate Chair Chris Nguyen, a junior, pointed
out that resident fellows often do not offer the opportunity for dorms
to vote on their specific policy.
According to Review Hditor-in-
Chief Emeritus Ben Guthrie, the
door-to-door distribution policy has
been the subject of ongoing debate
since three and a half years ago. Be
fore the fall of 2003, he said,The Re
view had no problems with delivering
its publication to every room in
dorms, a distribution method prac
ticed regularly by The Review. I le be
lieved the policy was then "rediscov
ered" by students and the administra
tion in response to a controversial ar
ticle comparing MeC'HA to the Ku
Klux Klan published by the Review
that fall.
"It seemed that it was a direct re
sult of those articles that some stu
dents then decided they were offend
ed by The Review, and looked out for
some policy that was on the books,"
Guthrie said. "So they complained to
various administrators and were able
to find this rule in the books that stat
ed that door-to-door distribution is
not allowed unless the dorm specifi
cally allows it."
Guthrie claimed that immediately
following the MeCIIA controversy,
he cooperated with the ASSU and
other publications — most notably
Hie Stanford Progressive — in an ef
fort to lilt the door-to-door distribu
tion ban, lobbying with the adminis
tration and initiating letter-writing
campaigns. In the fall of 2(X)5, the
ASSU began to represent Ilie Re
view before the Office of Residential
Education and individual RFs to pres
ent its case. Nguyen reported that in
the spring of 2(K)5, the ASSU Under
graduate Senate had unanimously
voted in favor of backing a resolution
to change the policy. 1 le noted that in
addition, when the 2005 spring elec
tion ballot included an initiative ask
ing for student opinion on the issue,
the majority of students supported
changing the current policy as well.
ASSU Publications Director
Brendan Marten, also the business
manager for The Stanford Daily, said
that when the Publications Board re
cently convened, it appeared to gener
ally support a change in current policy
as well.
"From what I can see, the mem
bers of the board were all in favor of
having a policy changed to be of an
opt-out nature as opposed to an opt-in
design as it is right now," he said.
But the University did not respond
before last week. Guthrie said.
Last month, however, a frustrated
Review staff reconvened and decided
on a different strategy.
"We decided that an act of civil dis
obedience to protest the policy made
sense," Guthrie said."lt was essential
ly to raise awareness,because we felt it
was unjust and we felt our representa
tives from the ASSU were being re
jected by the administration and the
alternative routes were not working."
The Daily reported that on Jan. 21,
staff of the Review distributed copies
of their publication in violation of the
policy and as a result, the publication
now faces indictment by the Universi
ty and a possible appearance before
the Organizational Conduct Board.
The three students involved in the in
cident. including Guthrie and current
Editor-in-Chief RyanTracey, received
an email from Associate Dean of Stu
dents Morris Graves charging The
Review with violating both the distri
bution policy and Stanford's Funda
mental Standard.
"After the Organizational Con
duct Board notice, we decided that we
needed to do something fast to ad
dress the situation," Tracey said. "We
wanted to meet with the administra
tors. so we and the editors of the Pro
gressive met with [ResEd Associate
Director] Joshua Schiller. We didn't
learn a whole lot and figured out that
the University didn't understand our
concerns and it was going to be really
hard for anyone to see our view
point."
Meanwhile, the ASSU met with
the general counsel "to say that they
thought the policy was illegal," ac
cording to Guthrie, and the counsel
responded to the ASSU by instruct
ing Residential Education to change
its policy within 30 to 60 days — as of
Jan .24 — to either choose between a
blanket yes option — door-to-door
distribution would be unconditional
ly allowed in all dorms — or a blan

ket no option.
"Since we saw that the only rea
son Stanford responded was because
of the legal implications," Guthrie
explained, "we recognized the effec
tiveness of legal pressure."
That was when The Review decid
ed to take the first step toward pur
suing what Tracey described as the
"nuclear" option: legal action.
They enlisted the services of
Corry, a IW4 graduate of Stanford
Law School, who had taken Stanford
to court in his third year of law
school under similar circumstances
— and won. In his recent letter to
Hennessy, Corry wrote: "I sent then-

Stanford President Gerhard Casper
a letter very similar to this one, ask
ing Stanford to rescind its former
Speech Code and advising that litiga
tion was imminent if the Speech
Code remained."
More than a decade ago, Corry
won Corry vs. Stanford, and his re
cent letter conveyed his confidence
in beating his alma mater again, if
this case ended in a courtroom battle
as well.
"This letter is Stanford's chance
to avoid once again being on the
wrong side of free speech," Corry
wrote. "Although there are never any
guarantees in litigation, it seems

more likely than not that the Santa
Clara Superior Court will once again
rule in favor of student speech and
against University speech restric
tions."
Nguyen, who has researched the
relevant legal precedents extensively
and worked closely with The Review
as an ASSU liaison, agreed.
"Previously, the Supreme Court
has ruled in Martin vs. Struthers that
door-to-door distribution of reli
gious leaflets could not be prohibit
ed," he said. "Leonard Law [official
ly California Education Code sec
tion 94367] then extends that ruling
to college campuses in California,

public or private. I'm not a lawyer,
but 1 think political speech has very
similar — maybe even stronger —
legal protection than religious
speech."
Though they are confident,
Guthrie, Tracey and Corry's letter
emphasized The Review's reluc
tance to resort to legal measures.
"We're not interested in going to
court," Guthrie insisted. "That's a
burden on everyone and we want to
avoid that. We're not working here
just for our self-interest or publicity,
we're working for the interests of fu
ture publications that might not even
exist yet. If publications with infre

quent circulation are not read by stu
dents by this distribution policy, they
will have a low chance of surviving
and gaining readership. We believe
this to be a matter of freedom of
speech and freedom of press, and a
matter of upholding the values that
Stanford promotes."
Wachtel's statement simply coun
tered: "Stanford University pro
motes and supports the principles of
free expression. There is nothing that
prohibits distribution of the Stanford
Review or other publications in the
lobbies, lounges and other common
areas of all residences, as well as
other locations on campus."
