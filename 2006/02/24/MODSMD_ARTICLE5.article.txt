# Review threatens legal action
## Publication may sue University if current door-to-door distribution policy is not changed 
### GERRY SHIH SENIOR STAFF- WRITER 
The ongoing debate regarding the University's door-to-door distri
bution policy reached a sudden flash point last Monday, Feb. 13, when
an attorney representing a group of students led by The Stanford Re
view threatened the University with legal action if it does not "elimi
nate the door-to-door ban or at least consider a compromise."
The letter, written by Denver-based attorney Robert Corry Jr. and
addressed to President John Hennessy, Vice Provost Greg Boardman
and General Counsel Debra Zumwalt, was made public when it was
published on the front page of The Review on the following Friday,
Feb. 17. In an email sent to The Daily on Thursday night, Senior Assis
tant to the President Jeff Wachtel did not mention whether or not the
issue would be settled in court, but maintained that "Stanford's rules
are reasonable and protect students from unwanted intrusions in their
private living spaces, while protecting the right of all student publica
tions to express their views, whatever they may be, and to distribute
those publications widely and publicly on campus."
Wachtel added that Zumwalt had responded to Corry directly on
behalf of the University.
Under Stanford's current policy, publications are by default pro
hibited from distributing material door-to-door, unless a particular
dorm "opts-in" through vote or a decision made by the resident fellow
(RF). However. ASSU Senate Chair Chris Nguyen, a junior, pointed
out that resident fellows often do not offer the opportunity for dorms
to vote on their specific policy.
