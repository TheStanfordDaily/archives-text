# CAMPUS LIFE
## Tree Week kicks off with a bang 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
Ttee Week kicked off yesterday as candidates began their campaigns
to become the next mascot, making their official entrances to the infor
mational meeting at the Band Shak. A good entrance to the event is
considered a key factor in any successful Tree campaign, and wannabe
TYees usually compete to see who can arrive last.
Even with today's festivities marking the official beginning of TVee
Week, some candidates had already gotten off to early starts.
On Sunday, senior Tommy Leep streaked at the men's basketball
game, and sophomore Daniel Novinson, Daily managing editor of
sports, styled his hair into a big red "S."
"What people don't realize about my hair is that I actually covered
everything but that S in gasoline, and then had Erin light a match before
extinguishing the fire in the fountain by MemAud,"said Novinson. "So
as much as the "S" stands for "Stanford." it also stands for singe... or psy
cho."
Novinson added that to demonstrate his dedication, he is already
four days into wearing the same "Me for IVee" T-shirt for two weeks
straight. He will also be sleeping in a tent in White Plaza all next week.
Even before the 4 p.m. meeting began, an assemblage of onlookers
had gathered around the parking lot by the Shak. Leep's supporters,
mostly fraternity brothers from Sigma Nu, arrived on the scene decked
out in white "Save Tommy" T-shirts.
