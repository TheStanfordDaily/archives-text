# CAMPUS LIFE
## Tree Week kicks off with a bang 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
Ttee Week kicked off yesterday as candidates began their campaigns
to become the next mascot, making their official entrances to the infor
mational meeting at the Band Shak. A good entrance to the event is
considered a key factor in any successful Tree campaign, and wannabe
TYees usually compete to see who can arrive last.
Even with today's festivities marking the official beginning of TVee
Week, some candidates had already gotten off to early starts.
On Sunday, senior Tommy Leep streaked at the men's basketball
game, and sophomore Daniel Novinson, Daily managing editor of
sports, styled his hair into a big red "S."
"What people don't realize about my hair is that I actually covered
everything but that S in gasoline, and then had Erin light a match before
extinguishing the fire in the fountain by MemAud,"said Novinson. "So
as much as the "S" stands for "Stanford." it also stands for singe... or psy
cho."
Novinson added that to demonstrate his dedication, he is already
four days into wearing the same "Me for IVee" T-shirt for two weeks
straight. He will also be sleeping in a tent in White Plaza all next week.
Even before the 4 p.m. meeting began, an assemblage of onlookers
had gathered around the parking lot by the Shak. Leep's supporters,
mostly fraternity brothers from Sigma Nu, arrived on the scene decked
out in white "Save Tommy" T-shirts.
Junior Christina Zempel was the
first candidate to arrive, wheeled in
on a black ship with the Band's red
trumpet insignia on the sail. Zempel,
was accompanied by an all-black en
tourage garbed in shirts depicting a
tree with a big"Z" through it.
A robed member of her proces
sion began to read a death sentence,
complete with a list of crimes osten
sibly committed by Zempel includ
ing: "piracy, impersonating the ar
biter of the royal coxswain's society,
impersonating a bishop, imperson
ating the undead sister of the pope,
looting, poaching, pilfering, depravi
ty, degradation and general lawless
ness."
As the reader finished the list of
crimes and sentenced Zempel to be
"hung until dead," Pirates of the Car
ribbean music faded in and the candi
date commenced sword-fighting with
other members of her entourage. The
battle culminated with Zempel blood
ily slaying her final attacker and escap
ing into the Shak. The group dragged
the boat back onto Serra Street chant
ing,"Z for tree! Z for tree!"
"It was good they had an exit plan,
usually these things are pretty anti
climactic," observed a bystander.
Others were not impressed.
"That pirate shit sucked," said
freshman Pokey Rule.
TTie Sigma Nu Leep supporters
were unimpressed, turning their
backs on the rival candidate's en
trance.
Leep was the second prospective
Tree to arrive, amid the frenzied cries
of his supporters. A sheriffs depart

ment SUV pulled up to the Shak with
sirens blazing. After Leep was taken
out from the vehicle, his handcuffs
were removed and the police left.
An individual who identified him
self as Leep's attorney began reading
a lengthy statement about Leep's
legal status. He was interrupted by a
black SUV, which had pulled up to
the Band Shak.
"Hey Leep, you can't be Tree if
you're dead!" yelled an unidentified
masked man, emerging from the car.
Two other unidentifiable men
began to shoot Leep with paintball
guns. After several rounds had been
pumped into their target, they
jumped into the SUV. which peeled
out onto Serra Street. The Leep sup
porters were in a panic as he fell to the
ground.
Finally a young woman clad in a
bikini, later identified as junior Katie
Fogelsong, revived Leep by perform
ing an extremely graphic mouth-to
mouth CPR. Fully resuscitated, Leep
spat a mouthful of blood onto his res
cuer's chest and entered the Shak.
The third candidate, identified
only as "Patches," was dragged feet
first to the Band Shak on a long board
underneath a Jeep Wrangler. After
high-fiving the driver, he wordlessly
entered the Shak.
Novinson, dressed like the Virgin
Mary and carrying a baby Jesus doll,
was next to arrive. He was accompa
nied by a cortege including flag bear
ers, a chicken carrying a teddy bear
and a gun-toting bunny, all chanting,
"Behold the Virgin Daniel."
'Ilie chicken presented Novinson
with the bear, which the bunny then
dressed in a UC-Berkeley tee shirt.
Novinson blessed both the bunny and
the bear to gospel music. TTie music
then changed to the Nine-Inch Nails
song "Closer" and Novinson began to

strip. Blowing the crowd a kiss, he re
moved his clothing leaving nothing
but a Speedo. He then threw the
Speedo into the crowd, applied KY
jelly to himself, and began to pene
trate the bear. After a prolonged
episode, Novinson scooped his ejacu
late into a water-gun, proceeding to
spray his entourage and take a drink
of the fluid. He continued spraying
the utterly disgusted crowd and then
proceeded into the Band Shak.
"My friends in the Band told me
it's the best Tree stunt they've seen —
ever," Novinson later claimed.
The final candidate, sophomore
Adam "Shmoopy" Monroe, arrived
masked and tied to a wheeled dolly, in
the manner of Hannibal Lecter. As he
was untied, Monroe struck his atten
dants, broke free >112 his restraints and
began to run through the crowd.The
candidate took off his belt,strangled a
bystander and proceeded to cut him
open, eating a fake liver.
Other candidates downplayed the
opening ceremonies, claiming that
the best was yet to come.
"This is just the beginning," said
Zempel.
According to Isaac Salier-Hel
lendag, Tree from 2(M)4-2(X)5, the en
trance is only one of a number of fac
tors that leads to the final decision of
who will be the next free.
"Last year, [the decision] really
hinged on non-Euclidian geometry,"
he said. "Last year was a Gauss year,
this year it's looking more like a
Levandovsky year or maybe a Rie
mann, definitely more than ISO de
grees. It's like a horse race. One horse,
no matter what, is going to win the
race. When the winning horse comes
across the line, we don't determine
that horse won, we just report on
which horse won. Also, whoever has
the largest penis, that can help too."

dants, broke free >112 his restraints and
began to run through the crowd.The
candidate took off his belt,strangled a
bystander and proceeded to cut him
open, eating a fake liver.
Other candidates downplayed the
opening ceremonies, claiming that
the best was yet to come.
"This is just the beginning," said
Zempel.
According to Isaac Salier-Hel
lendag, Tree from 2(M)4-2(X)5, the en
trance is only one of a number of fac
tors that leads to the final decision of
who will be the next free.
"Last year, [the decision] really
hinged on non-Euclidian geometry,"
he said. "Last year was a Gauss year,
this year it's looking more like a
Levandovsky year or maybe a Rie
mann, definitely more than ISO de
grees. It's like a horse race. One horse,
no matter what, is going to win the
race. When the winning horse comes
across the line, we don't determine
that horse won, we just report on
which horse won. Also, whoever has
the largest penis, that can help too."
Ttee Week kicked off yesterday as candidates began their campaigns
to become the next mascot, making their official entrances to the infor
mational meeting at the Band Shak. A good entrance to the event is
considered a key factor in any successful Tree campaign, and wannabe
TYees usually compete to see who can arrive last.
Even with today's festivities marking the official beginning of TVee
Week, some candidates had already gotten off to early starts.
On Sunday, senior Tommy Leep streaked at the men's basketball
game, and sophomore Daniel Novinson, Daily managing editor of
sports, styled his hair into a big red "S."
"What people don't realize about my hair is that I actually covered
everything but that S in gasoline, and then had Erin light a match before
extinguishing the fire in the fountain by MemAud,"said Novinson. "So
as much as the "S" stands for "Stanford." it also stands for singe... or psy
cho."
Novinson added that to demonstrate his dedication, he is already
four days into wearing the same "Me for IVee" T-shirt for two weeks
straight. He will also be sleeping in a tent in White Plaza all next week.
Even before the 4 p.m. meeting began, an assemblage of onlookers
had gathered around the parking lot by the Shak. Leep's supporters,
mostly fraternity brothers from Sigma Nu, arrived on the scene decked
out in white "Save Tommy" T-shirts.
Junior Christina Zempel was the
first candidate to arrive, wheeled in
on a black ship with the Band's red
trumpet insignia on the sail. Zempel,
was accompanied by an all-black en
tourage garbed in shirts depicting a
tree with a big"Z" through it.
A robed member of her proces
sion began to read a death sentence,
complete with a list of crimes osten
sibly committed by Zempel includ
ing: "piracy, impersonating the ar
biter of the royal coxswain's society,
impersonating a bishop, imperson
ating the undead sister of the pope,
looting, poaching, pilfering, depravi
ty, degradation and general lawless
ness."
As the reader finished the list of
crimes and sentenced Zempel to be
"hung until dead," Pirates of the Car
ribbean music faded in and the candi
date commenced sword-fighting with
other members of her entourage. The
battle culminated with Zempel blood
ily slaying her final attacker and escap
ing into the Shak. The group dragged
the boat back onto Serra Street chant
ing,"Z for tree! Z for tree!"
"It was good they had an exit plan,
usually these things are pretty anti
climactic," observed a bystander.
Others were not impressed.
"That pirate shit sucked," said
freshman Pokey Rule.
TTie Sigma Nu Leep supporters
were unimpressed, turning their
backs on the rival candidate's en
trance.
Leep was the second prospective
Tree to arrive, amid the frenzied cries
of his supporters. A sheriffs depart

ment SUV pulled up to the Shak with
sirens blazing. After Leep was taken
out from the vehicle, his handcuffs
were removed and the police left.
An individual who identified him
self as Leep's attorney began reading
a lengthy statement about Leep's
legal status. He was interrupted by a
black SUV, which had pulled up to
the Band Shak.
"Hey Leep, you can't be Tree if
you're dead!" yelled an unidentified
masked man, emerging from the car.
Two other unidentifiable men
began to shoot Leep with paintball
guns. After several rounds had been
pumped into their target, they
jumped into the SUV. which peeled
out onto Serra Street. The Leep sup
porters were in a panic as he fell to the
ground.
Finally a young woman clad in a
bikini, later identified as junior Katie
Fogelsong, revived Leep by perform
ing an extremely graphic mouth-to
mouth CPR. Fully resuscitated, Leep
spat a mouthful of blood onto his res
cuer's chest and entered the Shak.
The third candidate, identified
only as "Patches," was dragged feet
first to the Band Shak on a long board
underneath a Jeep Wrangler. After
high-fiving the driver, he wordlessly
entered the Shak.
Novinson, dressed like the Virgin
Mary and carrying a baby Jesus doll,
was next to arrive. He was accompa
nied by a cortege including flag bear
ers, a chicken carrying a teddy bear
and a gun-toting bunny, all chanting,
"Behold the Virgin Daniel."
'Ilie chicken presented Novinson
with the bear, which the bunny then
dressed in a UC-Berkeley tee shirt.
Novinson blessed both the bunny and
the bear to gospel music. TTie music
then changed to the Nine-Inch Nails
song "Closer" and Novinson began to

strip. Blowing the crowd a kiss, he re
moved his clothing leaving nothing
but a Speedo. He then threw the
Speedo into the crowd, applied KY
jelly to himself, and began to pene
trate the bear. After a prolonged
episode, Novinson scooped his ejacu
late into a water-gun, proceeding to
spray his entourage and take a drink
of the fluid. He continued spraying
the utterly disgusted crowd and then
proceeded into the Band Shak.
"My friends in the Band told me
it's the best Tree stunt they've seen —
ever," Novinson later claimed.
The final candidate, sophomore
Adam "Shmoopy" Monroe, arrived
masked and tied to a wheeled dolly, in
the manner of Hannibal Lecter. As he
was untied, Monroe struck his atten
dants, broke free >112 his restraints and
began to run through the crowd.The
candidate took off his belt,strangled a
bystander and proceeded to cut him
