### ANDREA FULLER STAFF WRITER 
A surprisingly pleasant peak in stag
nant ticket sales will mean approximately
800 people shuffling in the halls of the
Hyatt Regency tonight as Stanford hosts
the 29th Viennese Ball.
Although organizers of the event ini
tially experienced difficulties selling tick
ets, numbers surged toward the end of the
week.

"Ticket sales have really picked up in
the past few days so we're at around 380
pairs of tickets" said senior Louise Nutt,
co-chair of the Viennese Ball steering
committee. "Including our honored
guests, we have roughly 800 people who
are showing up."
"The publicity push over the weekend
has made a difference," added senior Ali
son Brooks, steering committee co-chair.
"We sold over 100 pairs Tliesday and
Wednesday."
While financial strife had originally
cast doubt on the potential success of the
ball, both co-chairs now expressed relief.
"My co-chair Alison and I are confi

dent that the ball will at least break even."
Nutt said. "We won't know the exact fig
ures for the ball until tomorrow night,
though, because we sell t-shirts, DVDs
and wine glasses the night of the ball."
Since 1978, the Viennese Ball has been
a Stanford community tradition. This
year, the ball will host gu&ts from the Vi
ennese Waltz Society of San Francisco, as
well as the Austrian Consul General.
"When the Ball was held in Toyon.
people used to camp out in White Plaza in
order to be able to get tickets," Brooks
said. "It's become more of a big deal since
