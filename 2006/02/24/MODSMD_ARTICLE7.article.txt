## Peaking ticket sales save the night Viennese Ball set to break even, despite initial doubts 
### ANDREA FULLER STAFF WRITER 
A surprisingly pleasant peak in stag
nant ticket sales will mean approximately
800 people shuffling in the halls of the
Hyatt Regency tonight as Stanford hosts
the 29th Viennese Ball.
Although organizers of the event ini
tially experienced difficulties selling tick
ets, numbers surged toward the end of the
week.

"Ticket sales have really picked up in
the past few days so we're at around 380
pairs of tickets" said senior Louise Nutt,
co-chair of the Viennese Ball steering
committee. "Including our honored
guests, we have roughly 800 people who
are showing up."
"The publicity push over the weekend
has made a difference," added senior Ali
son Brooks, steering committee co-chair.
"We sold over 100 pairs Tliesday and
Wednesday."
While financial strife had originally
cast doubt on the potential success of the
ball, both co-chairs now expressed relief.
"My co-chair Alison and I are confi

dent that the ball will at least break even."
Nutt said. "We won't know the exact fig
ures for the ball until tomorrow night,
though, because we sell t-shirts, DVDs
and wine glasses the night of the ball."
Since 1978, the Viennese Ball has been
a Stanford community tradition. This
year, the ball will host gu&ts from the Vi
ennese Waltz Society of San Francisco, as
well as the Austrian Consul General.

people used to camp out in White Plaza in
order to be able to get tickets," Brooks
said. "It's become more of a big deal since

then. All of the important stuff, like
the bands and the location, is the
same this year, but we're adding little
things, like a silent auction for Vien
nese Ball memorabilia and other
items."
The night will open with a Strauss
polka and a Strauss waltz performed
by the Opening Committee of
dancers, a performance by the Cardi
nal Ballet and the Honored Guests
procession.
The elaborate nature of the cere
mony has developed through exten
sive work both by the coordinating
committees and the students in
volved. The organizers host Austria
Week, which features a variety of
dance lessons students can attend to
develop the skills they will need to
participate.
"The lessons assume that the peo
ple taking them don't know anything
about dance," said recent graduate
Diana Lam, opening committee co
chair. "So for anyone who is starting

out, it's a good way to be introduced
to the dance and learn the basic step.
It makes it easier for them to enjoy
the ball and participate. We've gotten
really good feedback from the dorms.
Most of the residents really enjoyed
the lesson, and some dorms even
asked for another."
Students noted that attending the
ball took a great deal of preparation,
including attending events like the
Bon Bon Bali in January, for a taste
of the atmosphere of the Viennese
Ball.
"I have tried every year to go, but
it seemed like it snuck up on me and 1
was never prepared," said senior
Teena Redhorse. "Even though my
date doesn't go to Stanford, we have
been practicing every weekend for
the past month. We both attended the
Bon Bon dance a few weeks ago and
it was great. It gave us an idea of what
to expect, both on the dance floor and
about the fun we'll have at Viennese
Ball-
Senior Kat Snyder, who plans to
attend the ball, also cited knowledge
of social dance as helpful preparation
while also listing off a number of
other criteria.
"I've been doing social dance

since I was a freshman and this is one
of the social dance community's
largest and best traditions," she said.
"As for preparations, first I had to
find myself a date, then I had to get
my dress altered and find acces
sories, and then there was the dra
matic rush at the end to make sure
that all of my friends had dates as
well. Then I had to order a bouton
niere and make dinner arrange
ments. This year, the preparations
went swimmingly."
Junior Renata Sanchez agreed
that deliberating over clothing choice
was a big part of the event for the
ladies.
"I bought a dress long before I
even had a date," she said. "Now if I
could just find some cute shoes I can
dance in, that would be great."
Sanchez felt that getting to be part
of the ball experience was worth such
extensive planning.
"I chose to go to the ball because I
love finding opportunities to dress up
and be sophisticated," she said. "At
Stanford, those opportunities don't
come very often. I'm really glad the
tradition of the Viennese Ball is con
tinuing. I really do believe it's an inte
gral part of Stanford tradition."
