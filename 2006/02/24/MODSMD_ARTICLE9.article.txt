MANILA, Philippines (AP) â€” President Gloria
Macapagal Arroyo declared a state of emergency today
as she struggled against a reported coup plot and a pos
sible repeat of the protests that ousted two of her pred
ecessors.
The announcement came after the military said a gen
eral had been arrested in connection with a coup plot and
as people defied a ban on rallying at a shrine of the 1986
revolt that ousted Ferdinand Marcos. Clashes erupted as
police tried to disperse the protesters.
Arroyo said her action was the result of ongoing ef
forts by the political opposition, along with both the ex
treme left and the extreme right, to bring down the elect
ed government.
"I am declaring a state of emergency because of the
clear threat to the nation," a defiant Arroyo said in a
taped, nationally televised statement.
"This is my warning against those who threaten the
government: the whole weight of the law will fall on your
treason. You are unhinging the economy from its
strengthening pillars."
Arroyo claimed the military had quashed an effort by
some military officers and their men to intervene in pol
itics.
"There were a few who tried to break from the armed
forces chain of command, to fight the civilian govern
ment and establish a regime outside the constitution,"
Arroyo said. "We crushed this attempt.
Military chiefs said they backed the democratically
elected Arroyo. They arrested an army general, who
leads elite special forces unit, for alleged involvement in
a coup plot and ensured that a marine colonel was in his
barracks.
"We have reduced the threat," army chief of staff
Gen. Generoso Senga said. "We cannot say that it has
been stopped."
An unspecified number of other people also were
taken into custody, and police were seeking eight to 10
more, said Arroyo chief of staff Mike Defensor.
Already-tight security was bolstered in the capital.

The government canceled rally permits and told schools
to call off classes, aiming to keep the opposition from ex
ploiting the scheduled demonstrations commemorating
the 20th anniversary of the peaceful revolt that ousted
dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
Extra barbed wire and shipping containers were set
up on roads leading to Malacanang, the presidential
palace, and only essential staff were allowed in. Security
council members had to leave their cars outside and walk
into the compound.
Checkpoints appeared around the capital. Media
were barred from the main military headquarters. Camp
Aguinaldo, where reinforcements arrived in eight ar
mored personnel carriers. An armored personnel carrier
sat outside the marines' camp, with a truckload of
marines in full battle gear nearby.
Police already were on red alert nationwide as wide
spread reports of a coup plot have circulated for more

than a week; even elementary school students were dis
cussing it in detail.
The Philippine stock market and the peso both
plunged on the emergency declaration.
Army chief Lt. Gen. Hermogenes Esperon has said 14
junior officers were identified as being involved, and that
the military stood ready to crush any takeover attempt.
Esperon said seized documents outlined the alleged
plot, which included establishing a revolutionary govern
ment after Arroyo was forcibly removed and abolishing
"democratic institutions."
Arroyo survived three impeachment bids in Septem
ber over alleged massive corruption and vote-rigging. Op
position groups have continued to call for her resignation.
Last week, Arroyo met the military's top brass to dis
cuss security threats and ordered the generals to hasten
efforts to bolster the morale and welfare of soldiers, ac
cording to a general at the meeting.
