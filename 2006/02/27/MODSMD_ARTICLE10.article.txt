Stanford's commitment to giving back to the
community will tee off with the Cardinal
Golf, Drive to Learn Academy. In the near
future, students from high schools in East
Palo Alto, east Menlo Park and Redwood
City will have the opportunity to participate
in this program. Formerly known as the East Palo
Alto Junior Golf and Tutoring Program, it is current
ly being revamped and will be based on Stanford's
campus.
The mission of the Cardinal Golf, Drive to Learn
Academy is to assist students in the third to 12th
grades with their academic performance, using golf as
an athletic incentive.
"By bringing the students to Stanford and getting
them out of their current environment, we hope to
make a greater impact, especially with a focus on ac
ademics and taking advantage of all the resources
Stanford has to offer,"says Phil Ekedahl executive di
rector of the program.
In addition to Ekedahl, Stanford's women's golf
coach Caroline O'Connor and Stanford men's golf
coach Conrad Ray will be involved, as will Associate
Dean of Students Morris Graves, local venture capi
talist Mike Orsak and ex- Ladies Professional Golf
Association player Kay Cockerill, who now works for
the Golf Channel.
Ekedahl explains that the three main elements to
the program will involve tutoring and mentoring by
Stanford students, online academic tutoring and golf
instruction.
"As students become accomplished golfers, they
will be able to play local golf courses and attend golf
tournaments throughout the country." he says.
While some of the students may become success
ful golfers and receive golf scholarships for college,
this is not the principle aim, Ekedahl adds.
"The goal is that all students will graduate from
high school and attend college," he explains. "This is
especially important given the fact that less then 40
percent of students in East Palo Alto end up graduat
ing from high school."
The golf instruction, led by O'Connor and Ray, is
intended to keep students interested and involved.
"The Cardinal Drive to Learn Program is an
amazing opportunity for Stanford Golf and the Stan
ford Golf Community," says Ray, who has played golf
on the Stanford team and professionally around

the world for eight years.

"Through the game of goll we
are going to be able to
reach kids who
need our help,'
he continues. "It

is easy to take for granted how valuable a college ed
ucation is. and we want to use what we have here in
order to help kids get to college."
O'Connor is currently in her 11th year as head
coach of Stanford Women's Golf, has played profes
sionally, and has taught with one of the country's top
25 instructors. She says that while there are many pro
grams that currently target young children, the Cardi
nal program will be unique because its focus will also
include older students.
"We want to see more kids graduating from high
school with the possibility of attending such great in
stitutions as Stanford," she explains. "As 1 see it, golf
has become wildly popular over the past 10 years, par
ticularly with Tiger Woods' success and, more recent
ly, the media craze over Michelle Wie. A common

theme that we hear from
both Tiger and Michelle is
the importance of educa
tion."
O'Connor continues,
"Unfortunately, economic
barriers still exist for the un-

derprivileged in terms of course
access, instruction and equipment.
We hope to provide access and edu
cation that might have otherwise

seemed unattainable." "
The program has an excellent founda
tion and a history of success, according to

Graves.
"The majority of the students that com
pleted at least four years with us have gone
on to various colleges and universities
around the country," he says, adding that the
success of the new program will be measured
in large part by the criteria of academic
achievement, development of social skills

and individual acceptance of personal ob
ligation and responsibility.

The Stanford women's and men's
golf teams have been involved in var-

ious volunteer activities and have
hosted golf clinics on campus for

underprivileged youth. But O'-
Connor and Ray both say that

none of these initiatives have
been at a level comparable to

the new program.
"I love kids
and I

love golf, and clearly I believe in the value of educa
tion," O'Connor says. " l"he Cardinal Drive to Learn
Academy embraces those three passions."
Ray adds that Stanford Golf carries a lot of weight
with kids because of what it can offer.
"Being involved with an outreach program is a
natural fit for what we try and stand for â€” giving
back," he says.
Graves says he hopes that students will leave the
program with the knowledge that life can be challeng
ing. but that obstacles are not insurmountable.
"From a very personal standpoint, 1 want to help
foster in these young persons the belief and under
standing that one's quality of life is very much tied to
one's commitment to excellence and willingness to
make the personal sacrifices now for future returns,"
Graves explains. "At the termination of a student's

time within this program, it is my hope and desire
that each will leave better prepared for the
\ world that they face than when they entered.

We can write our own future with commit
ment, determination and a willingness to

learn from both our successes and fail
ures."

The program directors say they
hope Stanford students will volun
teer both as tutors and mentors.

"We will be looking for
students who can offer one to
two hours per week in the after
noon to work with our students
on things like homework assis
tance, college applications and
test taking strategies," Ekedahl
says.

has become wildly popular over the past 10 years, par

the importance of educa

the new program.

love golf, and clearly I believe in the value of educa

"Being involved with an outreach program is a

Graves explains. "At the termination of a student's

time within this program, it is my hope and desire

Stanford's commitment to giving back to the
community will tee off with the Cardinal
Golf, Drive to Learn Academy. In the near
future, students from high schools in East
Palo Alto, east Menlo Park and Redwood
City will have the opportunity to participate
in this program. Formerly known as the East Palo
Alto Junior Golf and Tutoring Program, it is current
ly being revamped and will be based on Stanford's
campus.
The mission of the Cardinal Golf, Drive to Learn
Academy is to assist students in the third to 12th
grades with their academic performance, using golf as
an athletic incentive.
"By bringing the students to Stanford and getting
them out of their current environment, we hope to
make a greater impact, especially with a focus on ac
ademics and taking advantage of all the resources
Stanford has to offer,"says Phil Ekedahl executive di
rector of the program.
In addition to Ekedahl, Stanford's women's golf
coach Caroline O'Connor and Stanford men's golf
coach Conrad Ray will be involved, as will Associate
Dean of Students Morris Graves, local venture capi
talist Mike Orsak and ex- Ladies Professional Golf
Association player Kay Cockerill, who now works for
the Golf Channel.
Ekedahl explains that the three main elements to
the program will involve tutoring and mentoring by
Stanford students, online academic tutoring and golf
instruction.
"As students become accomplished golfers, they
will be able to play local golf courses and attend golf
tournaments throughout the country." he says.
While some of the students may become success
ful golfers and receive golf scholarships for college,
this is not the principle aim, Ekedahl adds.
"The goal is that all students will graduate from
high school and attend college," he explains. "This is
especially important given the fact that less then 40
percent of students in East Palo Alto end up graduat
ing from high school."
The golf instruction, led by O'Connor and Ray, is
intended to keep students interested and involved.
"The Cardinal Drive to Learn Program is an
amazing opportunity for Stanford Golf and the Stan
ford Golf Community," says Ray, who has played golf
on the Stanford team and professionally around

the world for eight years.

"Through the game of goll we
are going to be able to
reach kids who
need our help,'
he continues. "It

is easy to take for granted how valuable a college ed
ucation is. and we want to use what we have here in
order to help kids get to college."
O'Connor is currently in her 11th year as head
coach of Stanford Women's Golf, has played profes
sionally, and has taught with one of the country's top
25 instructors. She says that while there are many pro
grams that currently target young children, the Cardi
nal program will be unique because its focus will also
include older students.
"We want to see more kids graduating from high
school with the possibility of attending such great in
stitutions as Stanford," she explains. "As 1 see it, golf
has become wildly popular over the past 10 years, par
ticularly with Tiger Woods' success and, more recent
