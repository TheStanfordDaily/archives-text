# Student group hopes to build green dorm near central campus

How does a single or a two-room double
sound to you? Outdoor study areas? Housing
right across fromTresidder and next to the Row?
How about all these perks while knowing thaw
the dorm in which you live uses the latest tech
nology and minimizes the negative impact on
the environment?
Enter the Green Dorm. Students, professors
and engineers since 2(X)3 have been planning a
dorm that is both desirable for students and
good for the environment.They're almost done
with a Green Dorm Project Feasibility Study,
and the three-year-old dream is finally begin
ning to take form. Partnered with San Francis
co-based EHDD Architecture, the Green
Dorm Project group is seeking a location for
the dorm.
"The group is targeting the site behind Casa

Italiana as the most appropriate site," says soph
omore Jonas Kettcrle, student coordinator for
the project."The location would be ideal for the
project because of its close proximity to central
campus and good orientation for passive heating
and cooling design."
The group plans to use solar panels and hy
drogen fuel cells as the dorm's primary source of
energy Other sustainable practices would in
clude natural lighting, energy efficient kitchen
appliances and the reuse of rainwater and gray
water — essentially all waste water except that
from toilets and food washing — for irrigation,
laundry and toilet water.
'The group hopes to achieve net zero carbon
emissions, which means that all of the dorm's
carbon emissions from burning natural gas are
offset by renewable electricity fed into the grid,"
Ketterle explains. "This is one of only a handful
of buildings worldwide that strives for this ambi
tious goal and requires the most state of the art

green-building technology and design."
Undergraduate and graduate students are
now working on developing some of these sus
tainable practices.
"We currently have many exciting projects
underway,"says Lauren Dietrich,a graduate stu
dent in civil and environmental engineering who
is helping to coordinate the project. "For exam
ple, metering plug loads to better understand
user demand, researching energy efficient
kitchen appliances, designing passive coolers to
replace in-room refrigerators and many more."
Mike Lin, a Stanford graduate student study
ing mechanical engineering, has taken the initia
tive to develop an information device that will let
students know how much energy the dorm is
using at any given point.
"For example,on the way out the door, a res
ident passes a flat panel display which senses his
or her motion and the screen springs to life,"
Lin explains. "When consumption is high, the

image might be full of vibrating shades of red
and orange, while during the middle of the
night, when usage is low, the image might con
sist of slowly oscillating shades of soothing and
green and blue."
Not only will the dorm feature the latest sus
tainable practices, but it will also be home to a
laboratory that allows students to research sus
tainability and keep the dorm up-to-date with
technology. The goal is to design a building that
can adapt to technology revisions.
Dietrich says that the group received a
$1(),(XX) grant from the United States Environ
mental Protection Agency — called the People,
Prosperity and the Planet grant — that will help
them buy materials for more green dorm re
search.
"We are also competing in Washington D.C.
in early May for an additional $75,(KK) in fund
ing," Dietrich adds.
Kettcrle says that lack of student and faculty

awareness is the Green Dorm Project's largest
obstacle at the moment.
"People have heard of the project mostly
through word of mouth and email, so it has been
hard to reach the broader Stanford community,"
he explains. "We are currently planning to spon
sor a branding and logo competition to develop
a new. more creative name for the project and to
develop a logo people recognize."
To learn about the project, students can take
the independent study course CEE 124/224 next
quarter. In the course, they can create their own
research projects and help plan the dorm's sus
tainable living environment. ITie course is also
being offered this quarter and was also offered
last quarter.
