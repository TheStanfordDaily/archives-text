## Editorial In search of athleticism 
### 
At the NBA All-Star Game a couple of
weekends ago, LBJ, Al, KG and other
stars rolled up in their hummers to the
hottest clubs in Houston, partying with Eva
Longoria. Diddy and Jay-Z. They sipped
Cristal, which sold out in many Houston liquor
stores,stayed in the best suites at the most lux
urious hotels and behaved like they make tens
of millions of dollars a year. And then, just lor
a brief moment, they played a little bit of bas
ketball.
Amazingly, this charade captured the at
tention of a nation obsessed with professional
sports, supplanting the Winter Olympics that
aired on American television sets. While an
nouncing the Las Vegas location of next year's
NBA All-Star Game, NBA Commissioner
David Stern called the game a "celebration."
Please enlighten us. Stern: a celebration of
what? A celebration of basketball? A celebra
tion of talent? Or a celebration of overpaid,
self-indulgent athletes bathing in the warm
waters of misplaced idolatry? Perhaps the
Commissioner said it best himself: The Las
Vegas game, he offered, will be "a merger be
tween the basketball capital of the world and
the entertainment capital of the world."
According to Stern, it's unavoidable: Profes
sional sports are and will always be mergers and
acquisitions."just business" for the athletes and
for the teams that own them. On a superficial
level, there's nothing wrong with that. But on a
deeper level, we must also remain mindful of
the beauty of sport for sport's sake, of promot
ing amateurism and, above all. of the Olympic
Games.
In the 2(KW Athens Summer Olympics, we
saw firsthand some of the stark differences be
tween those athletes who care more about
their sport than the money, and those who find
the money more important.The newest edition
of the Dream Team, the American basketball
squad, was defeated by two teams in a sport
that they had essentially dominated since its in
ception. The other teams played more cohe
sively, were less selfish and wanted the medals
more.
At the Winter Olympics in Torino that con
cluded yesterday, many of the same themes
were evident: NHL superstars from the United
States. Russia and Canada fell flat, while lesser
known. home-bred talents from Finland and
Switzerland surprised audiences.
It may be argued, and argued well, that the
Olympic Games are the last and purest exhibi
tion of athleticism and sport. But contempo
rary follies — the corporate side of the
Olympics — threaten what make the Games

unique and special. For the Winter Games,
surely a conscious decision was made to in
clude players from the NHL in order to in
crease television audiences in North America,
where the Olympics are relatively less popular;
for the Summer Games, a similar decision was
made to include NBA players. Though this
strategy has succeeded to some degree, we will
never see another "Miracle on Ice" or another
made-for-Hollywood script on the basketball
hardwood. To reinvigorate the Olympics,
Jacques Rogge and members of the Interna
tional Olympic Committee (IOC) must com
mit to excluding players from professional
spoil franchises like the NHL and NBA. If they
are replaced with players who really care about
being there, we promise that people will be
watching.
The other major visible step taken by the
lOC to increase the corporate appeal of the
Games has been to add a whole multitude of
niche events to fill out the schedule, from skele
ton to snowboard cross. These events, whose
competitors are concentrated in a small smat
tering of nations, simply serve to dilute the
quality of the Games as a whole and therefore
should be eliminated.
The lOC should also be conscious that the
integrity of the Games is suffering. Ever since
Ben Johnson tested positive for steroids in the
l(X)-meter race in the 1988 Seoul Summer
Olympics, the Olympics has been battling with
drugs while a skeptical public was forced to
confront the reality of steroid use in sports.
Fewer positive tests in Torino may point to a
more rigorous testing regime, but may also in
dicate an increased use of sophisticated mask
ing agents and designer steroids among ath
letes.
Equally troubling in these Winter Games
has been a seemingly newfound culture of en
titlement in certain athletes. From the whining
of failed figure skater Johnny Weir, to the child
ish feud between speedskaters Chad Hedrick
and Shani Davis, to the poor sportsmanship
shown by the American women's hockey team,
there are a lot of reasons to suspect that some
of the ego of professional sports has found its
way into the ultra-competitive, sponsor-ob
sessed reality of the modern Olympic Games.
The Olympics are, at their essence, one
enormous, multi-sport, all-star game. At their
best, however, they can be the antithesis of the
vanities and excess of the all-star showcases of
professional sports. Restoring the "Olympic
spirit" will doubtless be a long and arduous
task; doubtless, it should be a task well worth
undertaking.

Please enlighten us. Stern: a celebration of
what? A celebration of basketball? A celebra
tion of talent? Or a celebration of overpaid,
self-indulgent athletes bathing in the warm
waters of misplaced idolatry? Perhaps the
Commissioner said it best himself: The Las
Vegas game, he offered, will be "a merger be
tween the basketball capital of the world and
the entertainment capital of the world."
According to Stern, it's unavoidable: Profes
sional sports are and will always be mergers and
acquisitions."just business" for the athletes and
for the teams that own them. On a superficial
level, there's nothing wrong with that. But on a
deeper level, we must also remain mindful of
the beauty of sport for sport's sake, of promot
ing amateurism and, above all. of the Olympic
Games.
In the 2(KW Athens Summer Olympics, we
saw firsthand some of the stark differences be
tween those athletes who care more about
their sport than the money, and those who find
the money more important.The newest edition
of the Dream Team, the American basketball
squad, was defeated by two teams in a sport
that they had essentially dominated since its in
ception. The other teams played more cohe
sively, were less selfish and wanted the medals
more.
At the Winter Olympics in Torino that con
cluded yesterday, many of the same themes
were evident: NHL superstars from the United
States. Russia and Canada fell flat, while lesser
known. home-bred talents from Finland and
Switzerland surprised audiences.
It may be argued, and argued well, that the
Olympic Games are the last and purest exhibi
tion of athleticism and sport. But contempo
rary follies — the corporate side of the
Olympics — threaten what make the Games

unique and special. For the Winter Games,
surely a conscious decision was made to in
clude players from the NHL in order to in
crease television audiences in North America,
where the Olympics are relatively less popular;
for the Summer Games, a similar decision was
made to include NBA players. Though this
strategy has succeeded to some degree, we will
never see another "Miracle on Ice" or another
made-for-Hollywood script on the basketball
hardwood. To reinvigorate the Olympics,
Jacques Rogge and members of the Interna
tional Olympic Committee (IOC) must com
mit to excluding players from professional
spoil franchises like the NHL and NBA. If they
are replaced with players who really care about
being there, we promise that people will be
watching.
The other major visible step taken by the
lOC to increase the corporate appeal of the
Games has been to add a whole multitude of
niche events to fill out the schedule, from skele
ton to snowboard cross. These events, whose
competitors are concentrated in a small smat
tering of nations, simply serve to dilute the
quality of the Games as a whole and therefore
should be eliminated.
The lOC should also be conscious that the
integrity of the Games is suffering. Ever since
Ben Johnson tested positive for steroids in the
l(X)-meter race in the 1988 Seoul Summer
Olympics, the Olympics has been battling with
drugs while a skeptical public was forced to
confront the reality of steroid use in sports.
Fewer positive tests in Torino may point to a
more rigorous testing regime, but may also in
dicate an increased use of sophisticated mask
ing agents and designer steroids among ath
letes.
Equally troubling in these Winter Games
has been a seemingly newfound culture of en
titlement in certain athletes. From the whining
of failed figure skater Johnny Weir, to the child
ish feud between speedskaters Chad Hedrick
and Shani Davis, to the poor sportsmanship
shown by the American women's hockey team,
there are a lot of reasons to suspect that some
of the ego of professional sports has found its
way into the ultra-competitive, sponsor-ob
sessed reality of the modern Olympic Games.
The Olympics are, at their essence, one
enormous, multi-sport, all-star game. At their
best, however, they can be the antithesis of the
vanities and excess of the all-star showcases of
professional sports. Restoring the "Olympic
spirit" will doubtless be a long and arduous
task; doubtless, it should be a task well worth
undertaking.
