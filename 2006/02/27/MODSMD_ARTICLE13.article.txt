# How to Smile and Nod
## 
### 
What I offer you is more than a method,
more than a technique. It is a way of
life. The teachings I present to you
have been passed on to me from generations
and generations of experts in the art of BS. I lay
these skills before you with the humble assump
tion that you will use the power they give you
only for good, for no other purposes than pre
tension, falsification, and possibly seduction.
I reveal to you now what you must do to
attain success in this world: Smile and Nod.
This cardinal rule is easy to learn, but difficult
to master. Many men have grown swollen
with confidence and become reckless in their
use of our art, coming to abuse the power of
this principle. Most of them end up as either
corpses, or worse, politicians. Proceed with
caution, and remember, you smile and nod at
your own risk.
I shall begin my introduction with a cou
ple of brief explanations of different varia
tions of the Smile and Nod that you can use
in your everyday life. Our art is a subtle one,
one in which the slightest curl of the lip or bat
of an eyelash can mean the difference be
tween getting 100 percent for section partic
ipation and getting charged with sexual ha
rassment. Read carefully, consider the meth
ods, and use your common sense when you
apply them in your life.
The Section
As the name suggests, this move is most
handy while in section. You would use this move
while yourTA is giving his longwinded summa
ry that explains the actual (rather, what he
thinks is the actual) answer to what has been dis
cussed for the past hour.'lhe idea of this move is
to convey that his analysis is revealing some
magnificent mystery of life to you, thus making
you seem like an engaged and interested stu
dent. Start with a blank stare of befuddled igno
rance as your TA begins making his point. As he
approaches the powerful conclusion of his state
ment, let the corners of your lips start to curl up
wards gradually. Now. this is important, make
sure not to stretch into an all out smile too quick
ly. Think of it like a sunrise, like the wonderful
significance of what he is saying is literally dawn
ing on you and you can finally see for the first
time. When the smile is about three quarters of
the way done, start to nod your head in slow and
steadied awe. Extra style points for accompany
ing with an "Ahhh."
Advanced: Ity experimenting with starting
with a gradual nod and segueing into a smile.
The "That's Interesting"
This Smile and Nod is especially useful on

dates or during conversations with that one kid
in your dorni who never shuts up.The key to this
move is to feign interest. You're going to want a
half smile on your face (not an open mouthed
smile, that's too much in this case) and a perpet
ual nod of the head. The final effect is something
similar to a grinning hobble head doll. Make
sure that every couple of seconds you toss in an
"uh huh" or "wow" or "great" so your subject re
ally knows you care.
Advanced: Try experimenting with creasing
your forehead or moving your eyebrows around
while you nod. If done wrong this may make you
look confused instead of interested (e.g.,
George W. Bush).
The Smile and Nod Off
This is an adaptive maneuver that you can
employ when you find yourself ravaged by
sleepiness in seminars or sections. You don't
want to be that one kid who is blatantly asleep
while the professor is talking. The Smile and
Nod Off is an organic move that builds upon
your natural nodding off movements to convey
an aura of profound satisfaction. As you start to
fall asleep your head will become heavy, so
heavy that it is pulled downward, as are your
eyelids. If you are careful to wear a light smile,
close your eyes, and then nod off, the effect is to
convey that you are agreeing with something
you find very wise. Be careful not to close your
eyes as your head nods downward and smile af
terwards, because then it just looks like you are
having a very satisfying dream.
Advanced: Try falling asleep with your eyes
open.
WARNING: The Smile and Nod is not always
applicable. It is not appropriate in the following
situations:
Your doctor tells you that you've tested positive
for a venereal disease.
Your friend tells you his father just passed away.
Your girlfriend asks you if you think she looks
liit.
