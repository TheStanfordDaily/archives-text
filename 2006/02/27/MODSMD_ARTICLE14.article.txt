# The
						oblivion: women's basketball
## 
### 
I stumble into the game shortly before
tip-off. because I don't like being there
early and watching warm-ups. Chatting
with my fellow members of the press al
ways weirds me out. because they don't like
me comparing their job to copying and
pasting from the Associated Press. My
work 1 know the Associated Press won't
touch, because I don't try to be objective. I
try to be accurate.
Early on. of course, when they foul
Brooke Smith, my girlfriend, they incur the
wrath of whatever dozen generations of
highlander and Viking I'm descended from.
That, and an angry Brooke fan who is
hocked up on enough green tea that 1 might
actually storm the court and distribute
Viking justice accordingly. I won't touch
coffee though, because then 1 actually
might fly off the handle.
'Hie old alumni look about into this
game as they would be into the circus, but I
always associate the circus with the time I
had a fever when I was a child and I imag
ined the elephant grew to 60 feet and was
carrying a clown with the face of a squid.
That circus was exciting, man. ITiese folks
seem to really want to be part of that 30-sec
ond teeth-whitening commercial or cheer
on the West Bedford Children Without
Motor Skills Jamboree that performs at
halftime.The game itself renders them pas
sively accepting the events that go on
around them. If Zeus himself came down
courtside and challenged the undead spirit
of Grover Cleveland to a cage match, these
people would still politely clap.
I watch as Candice, who rides on angels'
wings that I've seen actually spout flames
and melt her opponents — from beyond
the arc and with the clock running down —
once again is able to have the effect of
telling every member of the opposing
bench that she just ran over their dog with a
weed-wacker. That is the kind of power
Candice has.
I enjoy basketball games. Even when I'm
in the thick of the crowd I can still make ob
servations and insights that are above the
common fan. Like for instance. I will know
that the girl who just fouled Brooke lacks a
soul, was the spawn of some cheap trick and
is actually a man who at a very young age
decided that s/he wanted to be a complete

hack. I can tell all this just by observing.
I'm like Sherlock Holmes in vans, having
taken the chivalry thing a bit too far. He
saves the women, I will desecrate the re
mains of anyone who touches Brooke or
Candice (and increasingly, I'm developing
a relationship with Krista. But don't tell
the other two.)
So when the opponents look at me, when
they drop open their mouths like I just ate a
pigeon in front of them and still had feath
ers caught between my teeth. I feel the burn
of a drug worse than any other — I feel the
burn of fear. I begin to smell their fears,
view the spiraled toilets of their souls; I can
actually hear the blaspheming chorus
singing as they touch the pure, holy. Cardi
nal women's basketball player.
And then the nachos kick in and my eyes
grow large, my pistons churn and I see
everything. They see some scrawny white
kid with a white hat and ring of Christmas
tree lights on his head like some kind of
fucked-up halo and an ironic T-shirt and
they know me and they know fear. For I am
worse than any bad fan,any student section.
I am an angry writer dammit, and my blood
is flowing and I'll berate them with my
metaphor, screw them with my simile and
trip them up with my acerbic, tangential,ex
tremely weird wit. They know that I am
dangerous because I have nothing to gain
from yelling at them, yes, but I have nothing
to lose. In a world where I get yelled at for
comparing governments to fascist regimes,
for calling hipsters hollow elitists, for just
not liking Dave Matthews Band. I've got a
lot to vent about.
My Candice-just-schooled-your-ass
buzz is wearing off. so I look at the ads dur
ing the time outs and I quietly curse Big
Brother for his ingenuity — he makes us
believe these corporations exist, actually
exist, are not figments of my imagination

bent on stealing my pudding.
The ads are as inconspicuous as parents
at pub night. They throw their visual ham
mers down on the circus-goers and the
young sexual-frustration corral bedecked
in white shirts. They want to be obvious
enough to pique your interest, but they
don't want you to question it. Questions
upset the little elf pulling the controls in
the changing maw of blackness on the
screen. Questions deny student money to
anti-abortionist evangelical nutjobs who
run women's fitness center fronts, ques
tions make you bite back at the companies
and conglomerates that see you as a num
ber and a dollar sign and tell you that it is
in us, why isn't it in you? I look at this box,
this black box that is constantly churning
in its blackness. 1 have seen oblivion. It re
sides in Maples.
I turn my attention to my roommate. He
gets bitter at the striped ones, but 1 always
felt sorry for the lot of them. The Divine
Creator took their little heads and decided
to slap on whatever blackened lint came
from the great Laundromat in the sky.
I feel the circus-goers above me get
more into the game now that the striped
ones have said something they don't like,
and they grow louder when they realize
their initial boos did not communicate their
desire to have the previously made decision
respectfully overturned. I haven't seen this
many bitter white people wearing red since
1900s Russia.
Yeah, that last line was completely off
and forced, but working on a regimen of
sugar and Slapstick albums will do that to
you. The basketball season is almost over, I
assure myself. The typing monkey men in
the press box will be gone.The sexual-frus
tration corral will disperse back to their
pimped out prison cells in Wilbur. I will be
left alone with an Advil regimen and the
memories of the women I have loved.
Brooke, Candice, Krista and the rest of the
women's basketball team — you are all
amazing. I'll see you at the PAC-lOs. Good
nachos there, I've heard.

Chris would like to take every member of the
women's basketball team out to dinner. He
will bring a high chair. Send complaints to
cholt@stanford. edu.
