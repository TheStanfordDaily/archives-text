## Prospective Trees prepare for the week Tree Week stunts range from streaking to human catapulting 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
After making raucous entrances to last Thurs
day's Tree Week kickoff meeting, candidates for
the Band's notorious mascot fell surprisingly
silent over the weekend. Most of

the candidates appeared to be
saving their tricks for noon A

during the school week,j
when a majority of the stunts j
will take place in White
Plaza.

The lack of activity was not
lost on the student body.

"1 was despondent over the lack of
stunts this weekend," confessed freshman Evan
Purcell.
One candidate, junior Christina Zempel, was
seen on Palm Drive on Friday with a procession
of her supporters. According to junior Bryan
Schell.Tree week coordinator for the Band, Zem
pel walked the entire length of Palm Drive clad
only in green body paint
"1 had a medieval weekend," claimed Zempel.
"For my second stunt, I built a gigantic trebuchet,
dressed in goggles and a cape, and launched my
self into Avery's Olympic-sized pool. It was kind
of scary because there was enough of a cross
breeze that 1 could have hit the shallow end or
missed the pool entirely. The trebuchet is behind
FloMo for the moment; if housing doesn't take it,
I'll be attaching it to my pirate ship."
Another alleged stunt over the weekend took
place at the multiculturar , Rhythms"showon Fri
day. Candidate senior Tommy Leep dressed as the
popular television character Ali G and spoke at
the event.

"Leep made joking reference to
his streaking incident and the kind
administration at Stanford," said
junior Mary Kate Hanlon. "He was
charismatic and funny, even as he
did 'the worm' awkwardly off stage.
A highlight was when he said that
he had something to say to us be
fore we all got 'into the intermis
sionary position' since he came on
stage right before intermission."
Leep allegedly approached San
skriti organizers during a tech re
hearsal and asked if he could be in
the show. According to an anony
mous source, reports have surfaced
that Leep will attempt another
stunt at the Battle of the Bands at
Phi Psi on Saturday.
Other candidates adopted new
campaign strategies.
"Anyone can get out there and
do me me me stunts, but being Tree
isn't just about me me me, it's about
sacrifice, it's about dedication, it's
about representing the band and
your school and I really want to
demonstrate that I'll do that well
this week," said Daily Sports Man
aging Editor and fellow candidate

Daniel N, a sophomore.
"Because being the Tree is about
sacrifice and trust in others, I've
placed full control of my campaign
in the Chicken and the Rabbit.
Whatever they say I cannot do in
order to be a good tree, I'll have to
follow their orders."
At 9 p.m. last night N and
his multi-species entourage un
furled a large banner that read
"Trees Don't:" Every day at 12:30
p.m. and 6 p.m. N will go to
White Plaza and add a new restric
tion from his campaign managers to
the banner. Last night the phrase
"Trees Don't Sleep Indoors" was
unveiled after the animal accom
plices pulled N's mattress
into White Plaza, where he will now
sleep outdoors until the end of the
week.
The mattress was promptly
thrown over the fence around the
Old Student Union, which is cur
rently under construction.
"I think everybody understands
that I'm goofy enough, but I also
need people to see that I take this
job incredibly seriously," N
said. "Hopefully some of the ex
traordinary sacrifices I'm making
this week will demonstrate that to
the student body. It's just going to
get more and more intense as we get
closer to the final day."
