## Prospective Trees prepare for the week Tree Week stunts range from streaking to human catapulting 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
After making raucous entrances to last Thurs
day's Tree Week kickoff meeting, candidates for
the Band's notorious mascot fell surprisingly
silent over the weekend. Most of

the candidates appeared to be
saving their tricks for noon A

during the school week,j
when a majority of the stunts j
will take place in White
Plaza.

The lack of activity was not
lost on the student body.

"1 was despondent over the lack of
stunts this weekend," confessed freshman Evan
Purcell.
One candidate, junior Christina Zempel, was
seen on Palm Drive on Friday with a procession
of her supporters. According to junior Bryan
Schell.Tree week coordinator for the Band, Zem
pel walked the entire length of Palm Drive clad
only in green body paint
"1 had a medieval weekend," claimed Zempel.
"For my second stunt, I built a gigantic trebuchet,
dressed in goggles and a cape, and launched my
self into Avery's Olympic-sized pool. It was kind
of scary because there was enough of a cross
breeze that 1 could have hit the shallow end or
missed the pool entirely. The trebuchet is behind
FloMo for the moment; if housing doesn't take it,
I'll be attaching it to my pirate ship."
Another alleged stunt over the weekend took
place at the multiculturar , Rhythms"showon Fri
day. Candidate senior Tommy Leep dressed as the
popular television character Ali G and spoke at
the event.
