## WOMEN'S BASKETBALL Women win Pac-10 again 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
I"he No. 15 Stanford women's basketball
team finished its season right where everyone
thought it would: atop the Pac-10 standings. On
senior day, Stanford's youth carried the team
over Washington State,7B-47,clinching the Car
dinal's sixth straight regular season crown.
"Washington State came out and played us
really hard," head coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"They gave us a good first 20 minutes, but then
in the second 20 minutes we increased our de
fensive intensity, and started hitting shots."
After a lackluster start, sophomore guard
Candice Wiggins exploded, scoring 17 of her 22
points in the second half. ITie Cardinal (21-6,
15-3 Pac-10) trailed early in the game but built
a 30-point cushion midway through the second
half, as the Cougars faltered.
"When we just started off, we just weren't
making shots," Wiggins said. "I mean some
times we couldn't be more open, and they
wouldn't go in. But 1 knew that they'd eventual
ly go down."
Washington State was able to jump out to an
early 11-3 lead with outside shooting, but the
Cardinal was kept in striking distance almost
single-handedly by freshman forward/guard Jil
lian Harmon. Harmon scored 15 of Stanford's
first 20 points. She finished with 19 points, six
rebounds and four steals.
"I've seen her for a long time [from recruit
ing], and she's playing up to her potential,"
Washington State head coach Sherri Murrel.
"She's a great inside-outside threat. Jillian was
actually one of the ones we keyed on before the
game, but obviously my pre-game speech didn't
work."
With the loss, Washington State (8-19, 2-16
Pac-10) is now 0-42 all-time against the Cardi
nal. Stanford has now won 45 straight confer
ence games at home and six straight conference
regular season titles. The win also means Stan
ford will be the top seed in next weekend's Pa
cific Life Pac-10 tournament in San Jose.
"We have one guard on the bench right now
and we got tired," Murrel said. "Stanford just
became Stanford and started making shots.
When you don't have any gas in the tank, and
you're trying to beat a Mercedes â€” we're like a
Ford Taurus."
Ilie Cardinal also honored the graduating
class of 2006 before tip-off. Forward Shelley
Nweke and guard Krista Rappahahn walked
onto the Maples floor for the last time with
their families. Rappahahn. the Pac-10 leader in
3-point attempts this season, was subbed back
