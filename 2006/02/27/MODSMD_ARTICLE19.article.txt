# ALL-TIME UGLY
## Freshman Anthony Goods tiffs in a Chris Hernandez miss to give the Cardinal an ugly 39- 37 victory in Putt man 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
PULLMAN. Wash. — In a game in
which neither team could find any sort
of offensive rhythm, a little bit of young
blood made a big difference for Stan
ford.

Freshman guard Anthony Goods
banked in a missed Chris Hernandez
jumper in for the winning basket with
3.7 seconds left to give the Cardinal (14-
11, 10-6 Pac-10) a 39-37 win over Wash
ington State (11-14,4-12) in a game that
saw the teams combine for 66 missed
shots.
With just over four seconds left on
the clock and the game tied at 37-37,
Hernandez came off a screen and found
himself open at the right corner of the
key. His jumper rattled in-and-out. but
Goods came in on the weak-side, un
guarded, to clean up the miss. Derrick

Low's three-point attempt at the buzzer
missed badly as the Card hung on for
victory.
"I saw Chris put his head down and 1
decided to just crash," said Goods, who
finished with five points and seven re
bounds in a season-high 22 minutes. "I
ran in there as hard as 1 could. Fortu
nately, the dude that was guarding me
wasn't looking and I just snuck in there.
I just tried to focus and put it back."
The open space for Goods was creat
ed when three Cougar defenders boxed-

out forward Matt Haryasz, leaving
the far side vacant.
"He did a good job, especially for
a freshman," Haryasz said. "It shows
that he has enough basketball smarts
to crash the boards. A lot of times, es
pecially when the game is on the line,
guys tend to watch the guy with the
ball. Anthony didn't do that. He just
went straight to the boards and no
one boxed him out and he made a
great play."
It looked like the game might be
headed for overtime after Washing
ton State forward Robbie Cowgill
made a game-tying layup with just
over a minute to play. Matt Haryasz
missed jumper from the corner with
35 seconds left, but Goods saved the
ball from going out-of-bounds by
throwing it off the leg of a Cougar
player to give the Cardinal a shot for
victory with the shot clock off.
The Cougars, known for playing a
slow-paced style of offense coupled
with a stingy defense, held Stanford
to just 32.6 percent shooting. Their
only problem was that they couldn't
score either.
Washington State shot 2-of-17
from the three-point line, including
just l-for-9 in the first half.
"We were just taking the first shot
that was open for us," said Cougar
guard Josh Akognon, who led the
team with 11 points. "On a good day
we'll make those open shots, but on a
bad day you've got to find a second
option."
Stanford trailed going into the
half 20-22, despite a 7:27 minute
scoring drought from the 11:24 mark
to 3:57 left in the half. I"he Cougars
managed only eight points in that
stretch and the Cardinal scored
seven points in the final minutes of
the period to keep it close.

The Cardinal had a similar scor
ing famine in the second half, going
7:23 minutes without scoring early in
the period.
"You just have to realize it's going
to be a defensive game," I lernandez
said. "You have to not get frustrated
on the offensive end and then you
have to focus on defense. If that's
what they're going to focus on, that's
what we have to focus on too."
Hernandez led the squad with 10
points, but struggled while shooting
the ball for the second straight game,
finishing just 2-of-8 from the field.
Haryasz again found himself dou
ble-teamed nearly every time he got
the ball under the basket and fin-

attempts.
"It was a real struggle offensive
ly," Haryasz said. "No one was in a
rhythm. It was real hattle — it was
ugly. It wasn't one ot those games
that's real fun to watch when you
only have 39 points, but it's fun to
win one."
The win was Stanford's first while
scoring under 40 points since a 38-33
victory over UCLA during the 1946-
47 season. It was also the team's low
est total offensive output since a 42-
34 loss to UCLA during the 19K1-82
season, before the introduction of
the shot clock.
