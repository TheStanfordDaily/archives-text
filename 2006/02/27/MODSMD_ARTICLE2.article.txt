## Stanford awaits OK for hotel Environmental impact, historical significance taken into account 
### PATRICK LEAHY COURTNEY WEAVER 
As Stanford awaits the green light from the
Menlo Park City Council on its plans to develop a
luxury hotel and office complex at the Sand Hill
Road corridor, a debate over the costs and bene
fits of the project has come to the forefront.
The proposed venture, a partnership with pre
mier ultra-luxury hotel company Rosewood Ho
tels and Resorts, would include a 120-room hotel,
a restaurant, a health spa and several office build
ings.
Rosewood and the University have carved out
a 21-acre slice of Stanford land between Inter
state-280 and Sand Hill Road, an area that has
been virtually synonymous with venture capital
ism since the dot-com boom in the late 1990s.The
facility will cater primarily to the corporate
heavyweights who flock to do business with ven
ture capital firms in the area.
The city of Menlo Park levies a 10 percent oc
cupancy tax on hotel rooms. At that rate, a high
end hotel such as this one could generate millions
of dollars in tax revenue each year.
According to Steve Elliott, director of devel
opment projects for the Stanford Management
Company, fiscal analysis has determined that the
economic benefits of the hotel will be significant.
"[When it is stabilized,] the hotel project will
provide $ 1.9 million to the general fund of Menlo
Park," he said. "In addition, the property taxes
from the project will provide $500,000 a year to
the Menlo Park schools."
Yet despite its potential to swell the city's cof
fers, not everyone is convinced that the hotel's
presence will be a boon for the community.
Lennie Roberts, a legislative advocate for the
Committee for Green Foothills in San Mateo
County, expressed concern about the growing im
balance between jobs and housing in the region.
"The price of housing in our area is the result
of too many jobs being approved by cities who
want the tax revenue," she wrote in an email to
The Daily. "This project will likely exacerbate the
problem, resulting in workers having to travel
long distances, especially lower-paid hotel and
service workers."
Elliott estimated that the new facilities would
employ about 600 people altogether.
The addition of the hotel and office complex
could also increase traffic congestion in the area.
Some Menlo Park officials have also expressed
concern that traffic on Sand Hill Road and 1-280
would spill over into residential neighborhoods.
City Councilmember Andrew Cohen said that
he has no complaints about the hotel itself, but
that the traffic changes would be negative.
"Stanford's overall plan, including all the
other offices and other development, puts quite a
burden on the city's traffic capabilities," he said.
Cohen said that he considers development
