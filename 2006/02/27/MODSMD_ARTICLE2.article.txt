## Stanford awaits OK for hotel Environmental impact, historical significance taken into account 
### PATRICK LEAHY COURTNEY WEAVER 
As Stanford awaits the green light from the
Menlo Park City Council on its plans to develop a
luxury hotel and office complex at the Sand Hill
Road corridor, a debate over the costs and bene
fits of the project has come to the forefront.
The proposed venture, a partnership with pre
mier ultra-luxury hotel company Rosewood Ho
tels and Resorts, would include a 120-room hotel,
a restaurant, a health spa and several office build
ings.
Rosewood and the University have carved out
a 21-acre slice of Stanford land between Inter
state-280 and Sand Hill Road, an area that has
been virtually synonymous with venture capital
ism since the dot-com boom in the late 1990s.The
facility will cater primarily to the corporate
heavyweights who flock to do business with ven
ture capital firms in the area.
The city of Menlo Park levies a 10 percent oc
cupancy tax on hotel rooms. At that rate, a high
end hotel such as this one could generate millions
of dollars in tax revenue each year.
According to Steve Elliott, director of devel
opment projects for the Stanford Management
Company, fiscal analysis has determined that the
economic benefits of the hotel will be significant.
"[When it is stabilized,] the hotel project will
provide $ 1.9 million to the general fund of Menlo
Park," he said. "In addition, the property taxes
from the project will provide $500,000 a year to
the Menlo Park schools."
Yet despite its potential to swell the city's cof
fers, not everyone is convinced that the hotel's
presence will be a boon for the community.
Lennie Roberts, a legislative advocate for the
Committee for Green Foothills in San Mateo
County, expressed concern about the growing im
balance between jobs and housing in the region.
"The price of housing in our area is the result
of too many jobs being approved by cities who
want the tax revenue," she wrote in an email to
The Daily. "This project will likely exacerbate the
problem, resulting in workers having to travel
long distances, especially lower-paid hotel and
service workers."
Elliott estimated that the new facilities would
employ about 600 people altogether.
The addition of the hotel and office complex
could also increase traffic congestion in the area.
Some Menlo Park officials have also expressed
concern that traffic on Sand Hill Road and 1-280
would spill over into residential neighborhoods.
City Councilmember Andrew Cohen said that
he has no complaints about the hotel itself, but
that the traffic changes would be negative.
"Stanford's overall plan, including all the
other offices and other development, puts quite a
burden on the city's traffic capabilities," he said.
Cohen said that he considers development
along Sand Hill Road an inevitability, but
empathizes with local residents who are
opposed to the traffic that a large hotel
complex would create.
Elliott pointed out that the developers
are taking traffic issues into consideration,
however.
"We're required to provide what miti
gation we can where there are impacts," he
said. In this case, the hotel will be paying a
traffic-impact fee to the city and making
improvements to the nearby northbound
off-ramp on 1-280.
According to a Jan. 31 Enviornmental
Impact Report, the project will require
ecological mitigation as well. Since a por
tion of the site is classified as wetland habi
tat, the developers will need to create new
wetlands to replace existing ones â€” typi
cally two to three acres of wetlands for
every one that is destroyed.
"There are wetlands areas of about 0.91
acres on the site and we will be required to
mitigate that, most likely by relocating and
recreating wetland at an additional site on
Stanford land." Elliott said. "The plan on
that is actually to increase the amount of
wetlands at a 1.5 ratio."
Cohen said he does not believe environ
mental issues will have much impact on the
city's final decision regarding the project.
While he remarked "you probably
won't find the Sierra Club liking it," Cohn
expressed that financial considerations
would likely be enough to override any en
vironmental concerns.
The building's developers also plan to

minimize the impact on the area through
the architectural design. According to El
liott, all of the complex's buildings will be
between one and two stories in order to
minimize the effect that construction will
have on the view of the foothills.
The buildings are designed in a "Cali
fornia ranch style with low pitched cabled
roofs and open patios and courtyards to
create kind of an open feeling and more re
laxed feel," he said. "It's trying to comple
ment the outdoor environment along Sand
Hill Road."
The projected Adobe style of the devel
opment is a sharp contrast from its 1980s
predecessor. Designed as a large, mid-rise
building, the earlier development failed to
launch due to economic and various other
reasons, Elliott said.
Within the past two years, the plan has
been redeveloped, and Elliott said con
struction is slated to begin at the end of
2006. finishing sometime in 2008.
In order to reach such goals, the man
agement team is working closely with sev
eral departments on campus to foresee all
land-related matters and verify the totality
of the construction's impact.
Laura Jones of Stanford's Planning Of
fice has already reviewed the site for ar
chaeological resources on three separate
occasions.
While she did not find an "archeological
site" on the complex, Jones said she did
come across lumps of chert, a material that
Native Americans typically used to make
knives and other tools.
Jones did not come across these pieces
of chert until her third visit there, and
after spending around 10 hours at the site
with other specialists, she is confident that
the construction will be able to proceed
safely.

"It's not what you would call a highly
sensitive sight archaeologically," she said.
"We didn't find any tools and it's not a
good place to put a village because there's
no water-source there, and it's on a hill.
We've looked at it pretty comprehensive
ly"
Nevertheless, an archaeologist will be
required to monitor the development, as
will a paleontologist, in case any fossils are
found.
"If they really hit a bunch of fossils in
the basement there would be some minor
construction delays," Jones said.
Stanford Conservation Biologist Alan
Launer similarly sees no concerns in the
conservation planning department.
He observed that the site was in an iso
lated location, and stated that he did not
perform a lot of his conversation work
there because of the area's relative biolog
ical isolation.
Launcr's only concern with the con
struction is its interference with the water
that flows under the site to a nearby creek.
While this water already flows under I
-280 and the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC), Launer emphasized the
importance of monitoring the impact con
struction will have.
"We just have to make sure that that
run-off is clean and not increased," he said.
"You don't want the run-offs timing and
magnitude to change."
The planning commission will hold a
public hearing on the proposed Sand Hill
Road hotel/office complex at 7 p.m. on
Monday, Feb. 27, in the council chambers at
the Menlo Park Civic Center.
If the project is approved and the re
view process goes according to schedule,
the hotel could be operating as early as
2(X)8.
