### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
The season is not yet even a month old, but freshman hurler
Jeremy Bleich is already well on his way to making a name for
himself on the Farm. In the final game of the Cardinal's season
opening homestand, a 5-2 victory over the Nevada Wolf Pack last
TUesday, Bleich tossed a 1-2-3 ninth to preserve both his perfect
save opportunity conversion rate (4/4) and his flawless 0.00
earned run average mark.
But like all good things, both streaks were destined to come to an
end. On the road this weekend against Fresno State (7-8), the rook
ie lefthander allowed his first earned run of the season and blew his
first save opportunity. Nevertheless, the Cardinal (9-4) took two of
three from the Bulldogs, capturing their second consecutive series
victory and opening their 10-game road trip on a high note.
Friday evening's series opener featured a pitching duel be
tween Stanford junior ace Greg Reynolds and Bulldogs senior
Doug Fister. The two pitchers exchanged zeroes on the score
board through the first four innings of play, but the Cardinal
broke out for two runs in the top of the fifth.
After freshman leadoff man Joey August started the inning
with a infield single,junior centerfielder Jim Rapoport drilled an
RBI double to the wall in left to plate August and break the
scoreless tie. Two batters later, sophomore rightfielder Michael
Taylor brought Rapoport in with a single down the rightfield line
to push the Cardinal's lead to 2-0.
Meanwhile, Reynolds continued to roll.The Bulldogs picked up
a run in the bottom of the sixth on a solo homer by leftfielder Steve
Susdorf. but that was only score of the evening against the stingy
Reynolds.The big righthander worked into the eighth, racking up
11 strikeouts in his 7.2 innings of work before giving way to Bleich.
Bleich entered with runners on second and third, but he got
Bulldogs designated hitter Beau Mills to ground out to first base
to end the threat.
Ihe rookie's streak of 10.2 consecutive scoreless innings final
ly came to an end in the bottom of the ninth inning. Bulldogs
rightfielder Ozzie Lewis tagged a one-out triple to right center
and came across to score on catcher Frank LoNigro's sacrifice fly.
Fresno State got the tying run to second base, but Bleich showed
his mettle by getting a ground out to end the game.
"Jeremy's done a great job in some pressure games," head
coach Mark Marquess said. "That was his fifth save, [and] that's
pretty good."
Bleich s first blown save of the season came just one day later.
Ironically, though, the lefthander was not charged with a single
earned run in the loss.
