# The
						year that was meant to be—then wasn't
## 
### 
Well, this was the season. As a sophomore
now, I only have two years left at Stan
ford. As disappointed as I am that I
missed our near-perfect season two years ago, I
was satisfied in the way that we rebounded after
the loss of Josh Childress, Justin Davis and Matt
Lottich. Moreover, I was looking forward to a
considerably better year this season.
By the end of last season, we were down to
three bench players.Tim Morris' academic ineli
gibility and the injury of Dan Grunfeld at the cli
max of his breakout season hurt the Cardinal
down the stretch. Given all of these deficits, the
first-round loss in the Tournament was regret
table, but not all that surprising.
Then came the off-season, and everything
went wrong. The loss of Rob Little and Nick
Robinson should have been countered by the ad
dition of a large freshman class — Stanford was
ready to get back in the game. Chris Hernandez
decided not to go pro, Dan and Tim were back,
and Matt Haryasz' development into a senior
leader turned us into what seemed to be a nation
al contender. The Associated Press saw it and
gave us a generous pre-season rank.
But this was all too logical. Fulfilling expecta
tions was too easy for Stanford students who are
always looking for the harder path. Loss after
loss we proved to the nation that we could lose to
the worst of teams.
After the conference schedule started, we ul
timately got our game together as we always do,
but we never emerged as the Pac-10 power
everyone thought we would be. The good news
for Card fans was that Chris Hernandez was fi
nally shooting like the two-time first-team All
Pac-10 player he is and Matt Haryasz was getting
things done inside with his powerful presence.
This worked for a few weeks until opposing
teams realized that Stanford only had two
threats. Matt is now double teamed every game
and Chris cannot get a shot off within four feet of
the three-point line.
On the plus side, players like Mitch Johnson.
Lawrence Hill and Tim Morris are getting open
looks all over the court. Unfortunately, none of
these players are shooters. We still give the ball to
Chris to shoot because he has a better shot with
triple coverage behind the arc than Mitch does
shooting free throws in his backyard. Ihe only
player who has been starting to take advantage
of the Chris-Matt freedom is Anthony Goods,
who is finally getting some time and making
some baskets.
You know what's coming though: Gradua
tion. Say goodbye to Chris' shot, Matt's strength
and even Dan's perseverance. Now players like
