# WOMEN'S SWIMMING AND DIVING
## Women's swimming third at Pac- 10s, Kirk sweeps fly 
### ALEXIS PETERSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's swimming
and diving teams, two-time defend
ing conference champs, failed to pull
off the victory this week at the 2006
Pac-10 Championships. After four
days of competition, the Cardinal
finished third overall with 1227
points, behind to first-place Arizona
(1325.5 points) and second-place
UCLA (1246.5 points).
While Stanford was disappointed
in its failure to earn a third consecu
tive conference crown, the meet was
not without a number of personal
successes.
Dana Kirk captured her 10th ca
reer Pac-10 title and swept the meet's
fly events — a first for the senior.
"It was really exciting to win both
the butterfly events," Kirk said. "I
was a little more confident in the KM)
fly than in the 200 fly, and in the 200
fly it really came down to the last

stroke. I just got lucky."
Lucky or not. Kirk touched the wall
0.13 seconds ahead of her nearest com
petition — Arizona's Whitney Myers
and UCLA's Kim Vandenberg, who
finished in a two-way tie for second.
Fellow senior Kristen Caverly's
standout performance came on the
second day of competition, when she
kicked things off for the Cardinal in
the 200 individual medley. With a
time of 1:58.54, Caverly earned her
lirst Pac-10 title, and gave the team
an important boost in points.
"It was not expected for me to win
the 2001 M. especially because I have
never won a Pac-10 Championship,"
Caverly said. "But as a team, we had
to move up in events, and in order to
do that, I needed to get first and win
my event.

in all three of this weekend's games. Shortstop Chris Minaker has hit safely in six straight.

she edged California's Emily Silver
in the 50 free by 0.03 seconds.
First-place finishes were not the
only triumphs the team enjoyed,
however. Both Kirk and Caverly
cited the 200 free relay as the event
that made the team proud. Swim
ming to second place in a total time
of 1:31.62. the relay team featured
Bishop and three freshmen: Made
line Rovira, Alexa Merz and Fiona
O'Donnell-McCarthy.
"I think that our 200 free relay
was a really great swim," Caverly
said."Getting second wasn't expect
ed from us at all. We just had a cou
ple freshmen who really showed
that they could do it, and really
proved themselves as determined
and capable swimmers. It was the
highlight of our meet."
It was also yet another example
of outperforming expectations.
"I'm really proud of how the girls
in our 200 free relay stepped up, be
cause going into that race, people
doubted us," Kirk said. "But we
were there to race. We weren't there
to get passed over."
For the swimmers, the next com
petition is the biggest of the year, as
the girls head to Athens, Ga. for
NCAA Championships March 16-
18. Hie disappointment of a third
place finish at Pac-lOs will not be
problematic.
"I believe everything happens
for a reason," Caverly said. "We
have another opportunity to come
out and race in two weeks. This is a
great learning experience, and it's
just more motivation for everyone
to turn things around."
The divers could not contribute
the effort in Long Beach — they
competed 1.000 miles away in Feder
al Way, Wash. — but they too man
aged to turn in strong performances.
Junior diver Cassidy Krug fin
ished second overall in both 1- and
3-meter diving. Ranked third in
both events after morning prelimi
naries, Krug was pleased with her
ability to exceed expectations.
"It was really exciting to be able
to step it up when it counted," Krug
said. "Individually, I'm proud of the
fact that I was able to go into both of
my finals and improve my dives and
my scores from prelims."
For the divers, the NCAAs are
still one step away. The Cardinal
head to Oklahoma City March 9-11
for NCAA Zone E Championships,
where they will try to qualify for
spots at Nationals.
"If we can dive the way we have
been diving recently, then we should
be able to qualify a few girls for
NCAAs," Krug said. "There are still
some things [from Pac-lOs] that we
will need to work on for Zones, but
we dove better at Pac-lOs as a team
than we have at dual meets. That
shows some improvement over the
course of the year."
As championship season heats
up, the Cardinal's main goal re
mains cleaning up the smaller tech
nical details.
"We have to concentrate on the
details — starts, turns, finishes, get
ting that hand a little bit deeper in the
water, having it glide a little better,"
Kirk said. "I"he athletes at NCAAs
will be the cream of the crop."
