# WOMEN'S SWIMMING AND DIVING
## Women's swimming third at Pac- 10s, Kirk sweeps fly 
### ALEXIS PETERSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's swimming
and diving teams, two-time defend
ing conference champs, failed to pull
off the victory this week at the 2006
Pac-10 Championships. After four
days of competition, the Cardinal
finished third overall with 1227
points, behind to first-place Arizona
(1325.5 points) and second-place
UCLA (1246.5 points).
While Stanford was disappointed
in its failure to earn a third consecu
tive conference crown, the meet was
not without a number of personal
successes.
Dana Kirk captured her 10th ca
reer Pac-10 title and swept the meet's
fly events — a first for the senior.
"It was really exciting to win both
the butterfly events," Kirk said. "I
was a little more confident in the KM)
fly than in the 200 fly, and in the 200
fly it really came down to the last

stroke. I just got lucky."
Lucky or not. Kirk touched the wall
0.13 seconds ahead of her nearest com
petition — Arizona's Whitney Myers
and UCLA's Kim Vandenberg, who
finished in a two-way tie for second.
Fellow senior Kristen Caverly's
standout performance came on the
second day of competition, when she
kicked things off for the Cardinal in
the 200 individual medley. With a
time of 1:58.54, Caverly earned her
lirst Pac-10 title, and gave the team
an important boost in points.
"It was not expected for me to win
the 2001 M. especially because I have
never won a Pac-10 Championship,"
Caverly said. "But as a team, we had
to move up in events, and in order to
do that, I needed to get first and win
my event.
