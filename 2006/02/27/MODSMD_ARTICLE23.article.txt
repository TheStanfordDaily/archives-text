for us to see that kind of competition."

and collected 24. I"he freshman also did her
part in the batter's box, driving in four runs on
five hits.
"['llie freshmen] both did pretty well." sen
ior outfielder Catalina Morris said. "They've
been adjusting well from day to day, just like
the rest of the team. Missy has been doing re
ally well working on different pitches and get
ting better with each game."
The Cardinal opened the tournament with
a six-inning, 8-0 win over Texas Tech Thursday.
Stanford took control early, collecting three
runs in the first inning before Penna struck out

The Cardinal went 4-2 in the Palm Springs Classic, but lost to No. 4 Texas 2-0 They did pick up
a big win over No. 25 Louisiana State, 1 -0.
Row residents through increased
noise, partial loss of the Mars front
yard and newly placed fences in
front of houses to contain the con
struction. Senior Barrett Sheridan,
Mars financial manager and a
columnist for The Daily, requested
earplugs, a housing bill and parking
permit financial compensation in a
letter to University officials. He was
promised earplugs for his house, but
had not yet received them. There
has been no response to his other
requests.
"The fencing [on the Mars front
yard] is an eyesore and makes eat
ing and relaxing outside much less
enjoyable," Sheridan wrote in an
email to Susan Rozakis, a Munger
project manager.
The Mariposa. Serra and Rogers
buildings will be moved to the
Tresidder lot across from the Bech
tel International Center. In order
to move these houses, a fenced
temporary road is being laid be
tween Mars and Sigma Nu. After
the houses are moved over spring
break, the road will be removed
again for the lawn area to be re

stored. According to Rozakis, mov
ing will take three days total, one
house a day.
"Safety is extremely important
on all of our project sites," Rozakis
wrote in an e-mail response to
Sheridan. "'Hie fence will remain in
place until the houses are moved
and the lawn restored. At that time,
the temporary fence on the
Mars/Sigma Nu front lawns will be
removed."
Moving the three houses to
Tresidder will permanently elimi
nate 120 parking spots in the Tresid
der lot, of which SO are A spots and
40 are metered parking spaces.
Parking and Transportation Ser
vices (P&TS) is gradually convert
ing C parking spots to A and student
permit spaces, because these permit
holders have priority.
"Everyone feels inconvenienced
[by the construction] to some de
gree. but the most inconvenienced
will be those with C permits," said
Phillip Garcia, parking services
manager. "They are being forced
out as a result of this."
Many students on the Row have
been advocating for compensation
for the costs of their parking per
mits as a backlash of construction.
But Garcia "does not forsee this
happening" because utilization sur
veys show that onlv half of the resi

dents in Muwekma. Columbae,
Mars and Sigma Nu actually park in
the 24 students spaces in the lot and
the new spots being converted for
them are in "relative proximity" to
the current spots. More surveys are
scheduled for next week and P&TS
will continue to make adjustments
based on the results.
Some Mars residents were also
upset about the impending death of
some woodpeckers living in the
palm tree in front of the house,
scheduled to be torn down. To
protest, they made signs, displaying
messages such as "Peck you,"
"Please don't kill us" and pictures of
Woody the Woodpecker. Residents
posted the signs on Wednesday on
the construction fence under the
tree only to find them removed on
Thursday morning.
Rozakis informed Sheridan that
Stanford conducts bird surveys
prior to the relocation or removal of
trees, which showed that "there are
no active nesting birds in the trees
that were relocated or removed at
or around the project site."
"The contractor owns and main
tains the project site and the
fences," Rozakis wrote in her email
to Sheridan. "Please be advised that
posting of unauthorized signs/graf
fiti can be considered vandalism to
their property."

In preparation for the new, four
level, 1,227-stall parking garage
under Wilbur Field, 125 EA parking
spaces in the current Wilbur lot as
well as spaces from Stern and the
Law School lots will be eliminated.
To help alleviate these losses, the
parking lot where the Wilbur Mod
ulars were located is being restored
and will offer 143 new parking
spots.
In addition, a temporary parking
lot will be constructed between
Stern Hall and Wilbur Hall off of
Arguello Mall (next to the basket
ball courts) and will accommodate
108 student parking spaces. The lot
will likely not be completed until
summer or fall.
"Overall, our residents have
been surprised and upset by the lack
of warning about the construction
and the failure of the University to
offer any concessions to inconve
nienced residents," said senior
Chelsea Reinhardt, Mars kitchen
manager. "Despite being told re
peatedly that the University'values
student input,' we have yet to see
any of our requests acted upon."

The Cardinal went 4-2 in the Palm Springs Classic, but lost to No. 4 Texas 2-0 They did pick up
a big win over No. 25 Louisiana State, 1 -0.
Row residents through increased
noise, partial loss of the Mars front
yard and newly placed fences in
front of houses to contain the con
struction. Senior Barrett Sheridan,
Mars financial manager and a
columnist for The Daily, requested
earplugs, a housing bill and parking
permit financial compensation in a
letter to University officials. He was
promised earplugs for his house, but
had not yet received them. There
has been no response to his other
requests.
"The fencing [on the Mars front
yard] is an eyesore and makes eat
ing and relaxing outside much less
enjoyable," Sheridan wrote in an
email to Susan Rozakis, a Munger
project manager.
The Mariposa. Serra and Rogers
buildings will be moved to the
Tresidder lot across from the Bech
tel International Center. In order
to move these houses, a fenced
temporary road is being laid be
tween Mars and Sigma Nu. After
the houses are moved over spring
break, the road will be removed
again for the lawn area to be re

stored. According to Rozakis, mov
ing will take three days total, one
house a day.
"Safety is extremely important
on all of our project sites," Rozakis
wrote in an e-mail response to
Sheridan. "'Hie fence will remain in
place until the houses are moved
and the lawn restored. At that time,
the temporary fence on the
Mars/Sigma Nu front lawns will be
removed."
Moving the three houses to
Tresidder will permanently elimi
nate 120 parking spots in the Tresid
der lot, of which SO are A spots and
40 are metered parking spaces.
Parking and Transportation Ser
vices (P&TS) is gradually convert
ing C parking spots to A and student
permit spaces, because these permit
holders have priority.
"Everyone feels inconvenienced
[by the construction] to some de
gree. but the most inconvenienced
will be those with C permits," said
Phillip Garcia, parking services
manager. "They are being forced
out as a result of this."
Many students on the Row have
been advocating for compensation
for the costs of their parking per
mits as a backlash of construction.
But Garcia "does not forsee this
happening" because utilization sur
veys show that onlv half of the resi

dents in Muwekma. Columbae,
Mars and Sigma Nu actually park in
the 24 students spaces in the lot and
the new spots being converted for
them are in "relative proximity" to
the current spots. More surveys are
scheduled for next week and P&TS
will continue to make adjustments
based on the results.
Some Mars residents were also
upset about the impending death of
some woodpeckers living in the
palm tree in front of the house,
scheduled to be torn down. To
protest, they made signs, displaying
messages such as "Peck you,"
"Please don't kill us" and pictures of
Woody the Woodpecker. Residents
posted the signs on Wednesday on
the construction fence under the
tree only to find them removed on
Thursday morning.
Rozakis informed Sheridan that
Stanford conducts bird surveys
prior to the relocation or removal of
trees, which showed that "there are
no active nesting birds in the trees
that were relocated or removed at
or around the project site."
"The contractor owns and main
tains the project site and the
fences," Rozakis wrote in her email
to Sheridan. "Please be advised that
posting of unauthorized signs/graf
fiti can be considered vandalism to
their property."

In preparation for the new, four
level, 1,227-stall parking garage
under Wilbur Field, 125 EA parking
spaces in the current Wilbur lot as
well as spaces from Stern and the
Law School lots will be eliminated.
To help alleviate these losses, the
parking lot where the Wilbur Mod

and will offer 143 new parking
spots.
In addition, a temporary parking
lot will be constructed between
Stern Hall and Wilbur Hall off of
Arguello Mall (next to the basket

108 student parking spaces. The lot
will likely not be completed until
summer or fall.

Arguello Mall (next to the basket
ball courts) and will accommodate
108 student parking spaces. The lot
will likely not be completed until
summer or fall.
"Overall, our residents have
been surprised and upset by the lack
of warning about the construction
and the failure of the University to
offer any concessions to inconve
nienced residents," said senior
Chelsea Reinhardt, Mars kitchen
manager. "Despite being told re
peatedly that the University'values
student input,' we have yet to see
any of our requests acted upon."

It was an up-and-down weekend for the

team with a .579 average, 11 hits, three runs
and one RBI. Freshman infielder Maddy
Coon also notched six RBI on nine hits with
two homeruns.
"We had great team chemistry going into
the tournament, and seeing these great teams
is a good experience in getting used to playing
with each other on the field," Coon said.
"Overall, the competition was better this
weekend. Pitchers threw harder, and it's good
for us to see that kind of competition."
Pitcher Missy Penna (8-2) threw 20 innings
and collected 24. I"he freshman also did her
part in the batter's box, driving in four runs on
five hits.
"['llie freshmen] both did pretty well." sen
ior outfielder Catalina Morris said. "They've
been adjusting well from day to day, just like
the rest of the team. Missy has been doing re
ally well working on different pitches and get
ting better with each game."
The Cardinal opened the tournament with
a six-inning, 8-0 win over Texas Tech Thursday.

JAMES CHAN/Tlie Stanford Daily
The Cardinal went 4-2 in the Palm Springs Classic, but lost to No. 4 Texas 2-0 They did pick up
a big win over No. 25 Louisiana State, 1 -0.
Row residents through increased
noise, partial loss of the Mars front
yard and newly placed fences in
front of houses to contain the con
struction. Senior Barrett Sheridan,
Mars financial manager and a
columnist for The Daily, requested
earplugs, a housing bill and parking
permit financial compensation in a
letter to University officials. He was
promised earplugs for his house, but
had not yet received them. There
has been no response to his other
requests.
"The fencing [on the Mars front
yard] is an eyesore and makes eat
ing and relaxing outside much less
enjoyable," Sheridan wrote in an
email to Susan Rozakis, a Munger
project manager.
The Mariposa. Serra and Rogers
buildings will be moved to the
Tresidder lot across from the Bech
tel International Center. In order
to move these houses, a fenced
temporary road is being laid be
tween Mars and Sigma Nu. After
the houses are moved over spring
break, the road will be removed
again for the lawn area to be re

stored. According to Rozakis, mov
ing will take three days total, one
house a day.
"Safety is extremely important
on all of our project sites," Rozakis
wrote in an e-mail response to
Sheridan. "'Hie fence will remain in
place until the houses are moved
and the lawn restored. At that time,
the temporary fence on the
Mars/Sigma Nu front lawns will be
removed."
Moving the three houses to
Tresidder will permanently elimi
nate 120 parking spots in the Tresid
der lot, of which SO are A spots and
40 are metered parking spaces.
Parking and Transportation Ser
vices (P&TS) is gradually convert
ing C parking spots to A and student
permit spaces, because these permit
holders have priority.
"Everyone feels inconvenienced
[by the construction] to some de
gree. but the most inconvenienced
will be those with C permits," said
Phillip Garcia, parking services
manager. "They are being forced
out as a result of this."
Many students on the Row have
been advocating for compensation
for the costs of their parking per
mits as a backlash of construction.
But Garcia "does not forsee this
happening" because utilization sur
veys show that onlv half of the resi

dents in Muwekma. Columbae,
Mars and Sigma Nu actually park in
the 24 students spaces in the lot and
the new spots being converted for
them are in "relative proximity" to
the current spots. More surveys are
scheduled for next week and P&TS
will continue to make adjustments
based on the results.
Some Mars residents were also
upset about the impending death of
some woodpeckers living in the
palm tree in front of the house,
scheduled to be torn down. To
protest, they made signs, displaying
messages such as "Peck you,"
"Please don't kill us" and pictures of
Woody the Woodpecker. Residents
posted the signs on Wednesday on
the construction fence under the
tree only to find them removed on
Thursday morning.
Rozakis informed Sheridan that
Stanford conducts bird surveys
prior to the relocation or removal of
trees, which showed that "there are
no active nesting birds in the trees
that were relocated or removed at
or around the project site."
"The contractor owns and main
tains the project site and the
fences," Rozakis wrote in her email
to Sheridan. "Please be advised that
posting of unauthorized signs/graf
fiti can be considered vandalism to
their property."

In preparation for the new, four
level, 1,227-stall parking garage
under Wilbur Field, 125 EA parking
spaces in the current Wilbur lot as
well as spaces from Stern and the
Law School lots will be eliminated.
To help alleviate these losses, the
parking lot where the Wilbur Mod
ulars were located is being restored
and will offer 143 new parking
spots.
In addition, a temporary parking
lot will be constructed between
Stern Hall and Wilbur Hall off of
Arguello Mall (next to the basket
ball courts) and will accommodate
108 student parking spaces. The lot
will likely not be completed until
summer or fall.
"Overall, our residents have
been surprised and upset by the lack
of warning about the construction

nienced residents," said senior
