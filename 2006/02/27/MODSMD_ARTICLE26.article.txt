Stanford University will pay tribute to I
the Stanford Family at the annual \
Founders' Celebration on April 10, i
2006. This day is reserved on the I
University calendar to reflect on and
recognize their achievements in found- !
ing our University that bears their
name.
Highlights of the Founders'
Celebration activities will be speeches
from one undergraduate student and
one graduate student. Once again, in
hopes of increasing student awareness 1
and participation in the Founders'
Celebration, President Hennessy has
decided to provide each student
speaker with a $1,000 cash award. j
A Founders' Celebration student com- j
mittee has developed a two-stage
process to determine which students I

will have the honor of speaking at the Founders' Celebration. The first stage
requires each student to submit a copy of the actual speech by noon on March 6
to the Office of Student Activities (on the second floor of Tresidder Memorial
Union). The Founders' Celebration student committee will review all completed
submissions regarding content, and will then invite a small group of finalists to
deliver their speech in front of the committee as the second and final stage of the
process.
Speech Criteria:
1. Speeches should not take more than five minutes to deliver.
2. Speeches can address any of the following elements:
background of the Stanford Family.
background of the founding of Stanford University.
*What Stanford means to you.
*How Stanford has impacted your life.
*How Stanford impacts the world.
Speeches will be judged on their overall content. Judges will be looking for inter
esting, creative, thoughtful, and passionate speeches.
Please contact Chris Griffith at 723-9929 or griffith@stanford if you have any
questions. DON'T FORGET, THE DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION OF YOUR
SPEECH IS 12 NOON ON MARCH 6.
