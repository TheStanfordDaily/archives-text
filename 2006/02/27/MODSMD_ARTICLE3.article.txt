Breaking records is no longer only the
domain of Winter Olympians, as Stanford
received $603.6 million in gifts for the
2(K)5 fiscal year, more than any other uni
versity last year and the second-highest
total ever behind Harvard's $683 million
in 2001.

This unprecedented amount consisted
of approximately $330.4 million in gifts
from individuals, $187.7 million from
foundations and associations, $39.2 mil
lion from corporations and $46.2 million
from bequests. In addition, the School of
Medicine set a new cash record, raising
$127.8 million, and the School of Human
ities and Sciences received a record sum of

gifts totaling $101 million

The largest cumulative gift of the year
was $81.9 million from the William and
Flora Hewlett Foundation, according to
Vice President for Development Martin
Shell. The second largest gift came from
a couple who made a joint contribution
$38.9 million. During fiscal year 2005, the
Office of Development received gifts
from 71,976 donors and processed
114,556 gifts. Gifts to expendable pur
poses totaled $346.2 million, gifts to the
endowment totaled $235.6 million, and
gifts to capital purposes totaled $21.7
million.

Shell stated that large gifts to the Uni
versity are usually made by donors seek
ing to "make philanthropic investments in
academic and research programs, in stu

dents, in faculty and in other specific com
ponents of the University's overarching

vision

"Larger gifts can provide a necessary
infusion of significant funding to get a
new program off the ground; they sup
port financial aid that enables Stanford
to maintain its need-blind admissions
policy; they help pay for new buildings
that are needed to make research break
throughs; or to house students," Shell
continued, 'in short, nearly every corner
of the University is touched by donors
who partner with the University to help it
achieve its coals."

Shell noted that large gifts often come
with more restrictions as to how the funds
can be spent, whereas smaller gifts — such
as those that come from the Stanford

University receives more than $600 million in contributions

Fund or a school-based annual fund

are generally made with few or no strings
attached. These smaller gilts are valuable
to the University as they can he applied to
the most urgent needs.

"Last year, the majority of gifts made
to the University were less than $1,000,
but together, these gifts totaled millions of
dollars that were available to address
some of the University's most important
financial needs Shell said. "One recent
example emphasizing the importance of
small gifts is Stanford's increased need for
students' financial aid. Large gifts in the
form of endowed scholarships have
helped, but there is still a significant gap
between what the available endowment
can pay for and the ongoing, critical need.
Annual gifts assist the University in making
up the difference."
Gifts from both undergraduate and grad
uate alumni totaled $159.7 million in fiscal
year 2005, as compared to $129.1 million in
fiscal year 2004. In fiscal year 2005,39.14 per
cent of undergraduates made a gift to Stan
ford versus 39.05 percent in fiscal year 2004.
Through annual giving programs, especially
the Stanford Fund, the University focuses on
increasing dollars and alumni participation
rates, especially among classes celebrating
their reunion year and the University's
young alumni population.
Shell emphasized that annual gifts also
help the University innovate.
"Gifts to the Stanford Fund provided
initial seed funding for some of the pro
grams that later were made permanent
through large gifts raised during the Cam
paign for Undergraduate Education," Shell
said. "Therefore, smaller gifts, like large
gifts, are constantly at work throughout the
University."
For fiscal year 2006, Shell stated that the
focus of gift-seeking will continue to be do
nations supporting the University's educa
tional and research mission.
"In the undergraduate program, Stan
ford will continue to focus on increasing
the endowment for need-based scholar-

Larger gifts can provide a
necessary infusion of
significant funding to
get a new program off
the ground.

in undergraduate education put in place
through CUE." he said. "In particular, the
emphasis will be on improving advising,
expanding undergraduate research pro
grams and enhancing residential educa
tion."
Other fundraising attention will be paid
to University President John Hennessy's
initiatives concerning human health, envi
ronmental sustainability and international
affairs.

"The three multidisciplinary initiatives
represent a core piece of the University's
vision,and, as such, they play an important
part in our future fundraising efforts,"
Shell said.
Resources for translational research in
human health care will be awarded to the
Initiative on Human Health — designed
to support basic discoveries and insights at
the lab bench, breakthroughs in clinical
therapies, and solutions to the world's po
litical, social and economic problems in
volved with effectively deploying such
new therapies.
Through the Initiative on Environmen
tal Sustainability, Stanford is researching
new ways to create energy, supply commu
nities around the world wiih fresh water, ad
dress growth with adequate living and farm
ing space and protect the oceans vital to
human society and Earth ecology. Shell said.
The Office of Development hopes to build
upon the success of the recently established
Woods Institute for the Environment, at the
center of the new initiative.
Fundraising for the International Initia
tive will bring together experts from all
seven Stanford schools, as well as the
Hoover Institution and the Freeman Spogli
Institute for International Studies, to ex
plore questions about peace and security,
governance and human well being.
