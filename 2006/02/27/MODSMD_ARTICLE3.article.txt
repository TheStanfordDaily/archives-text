Breaking records is no longer only the
domain of Winter Olympians, as Stanford
received $603.6 million in gifts for the
2(K)5 fiscal year, more than any other uni
versity last year and the second-highest
total ever behind Harvard's $683 million
in 2001.

This unprecedented amount consisted
of approximately $330.4 million in gifts
from individuals, $187.7 million from
foundations and associations, $39.2 mil
lion from corporations and $46.2 million
from bequests. In addition, the School of
Medicine set a new cash record, raising
$127.8 million, and the School of Human
ities and Sciences received a record sum of

gifts totaling $101 million

The largest cumulative gift of the year
was $81.9 million from the William and
Flora Hewlett Foundation, according to
Vice President for Development Martin
Shell. The second largest gift came from
a couple who made a joint contribution
$38.9 million. During fiscal year 2005, the
Office of Development received gifts
from 71,976 donors and processed
114,556 gifts. Gifts to expendable pur
poses totaled $346.2 million, gifts to the
endowment totaled $235.6 million, and
gifts to capital purposes totaled $21.7
million.

Shell stated that large gifts to the Uni
versity are usually made by donors seek
ing to "make philanthropic investments in
academic and research programs, in stu

vision

"Larger gifts can provide a necessary
infusion of significant funding to get a
new program off the ground; they sup
port financial aid that enables Stanford
to maintain its need-blind admissions
policy; they help pay for new buildings
that are needed to make research break
throughs; or to house students," Shell
continued, 'in short, nearly every corner
of the University is touched by donors
who partner with the University to help it
achieve its coals."

Shell noted that large gifts often come
with more restrictions as to how the funds
can be spent, whereas smaller gifts â€” such
as those that come from the Stanford

Fund or a school-based annual fund

are generally made with few or no strings
attached. These smaller gilts are valuable
to the University as they can he applied to
the most urgent needs.

"Last year, the majority of gifts made
to the University were less than $1,000,
but together, these gifts totaled millions of
dollars that were available to address
some of the University's most important
financial needs Shell said. "One recent
example emphasizing the importance of
small gifts is Stanford's increased need for
students' financial aid. Large gifts in the
form of endowed scholarships have
helped, but there is still a significant gap
between what the available endowment
