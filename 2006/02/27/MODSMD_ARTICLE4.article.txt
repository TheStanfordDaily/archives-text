## Munger projects displace parking 
### 
Buildings relocated to
clear room for construction

Beginning Monday, residents of
Sigma Nu and Mars will be looking
for new parking spots, as the 24-stu
dent parking spots behind their
houses will be lost forever to con
struction of the Munger Graduate
Residences.
The project aims to house 600
graduate students at the center of
campus, with priority being given to
law students. Stanford will become
the only top law school in the coun
try to guarantee three years of hous
ing to all law students.
However, the ambitious project
also comes with a cost. Construction
will commence at 8 a.m. every
morning, Monday through Friday,
for the remainder of the school year.
A temporary road is being con
structed, front lawns are being up
rooted and trees are being removed
and relocated while Wilbur field is
being excavated for the parking
structure.
Much of the work in the next
month will center around moving
five existing buildings on Salvatier
ra Walk — the Drell, Owen, Rogers,
Mariposa and Serra Houses — to
other sites on campus. The Owen
and Drell buildings will be moved to
the existing parking area located be

hind Sigma Nu and Mars in mid-
April as preparations are already
under way.
This move will permanently
eliminate all 75 parking spots in that
area, including 24 "SO" student per
mit spaces,4l "A" permit spaces and
10 metered parking spaces. To make
up for this loss, the street parking
spaces in front of Tresidder on May
field will be converted to SO spots
while those south of Campus Drive
will now be made available to SO
permit holders in addition to the
current SJ permit holders.
Munger construction ousted the
Bridge Peer Counseling Center
from Salvatierra Walk to a tempo
rary location behind the Graduate
Community Center.The Bridge will
move to a new home in the relocat
ed Rodgers House in the Tresidder
parking lot by fall 2006.
"Our main concern with the proj
ect is the decreased visibility of our
new location," said senior Alex
Rivas, a live-in at Bridge. "The num
ber of students dropping in for
counseling has dropped precipi
tously. We fear that while people
know about the Munger project,
they do not know that we have
moved, and might not know where
our new location is in the fall. We
hope to work with the Munger proj
ect to come up with sufficient fund
ing to make it known we still exist."
