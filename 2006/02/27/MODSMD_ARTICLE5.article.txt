# SPECIAL EVENT
## Islam Awareness Month draws to close Surgeon discusses Islamic views of high-profile bioethics issues 
### AMIT ARORA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Islam Awareness Month concluded yester
day with a lecture on Islam and bioethics at the
Bechtel International Center hosted by
renowned emergency room surgeon and Is
lamic ethicist Faiz Khan.The event marked the
end to month-long discussions on Islam and Is
lamic perspectives on contemporary interna
tional issues.
Designed to increase awareness of Islam, to
remove misconceptions regarding the religion
and its practice and to encourage discourse
among Stanford students, this year's Islam
Awareness Month has sponsored five lectures

and attracted hundreds to issues on poverty,
racism and the environment. The lecture on
bioethics was equally comprehensive, address
ing issues from contraceptives and abortion to
euthanasia and stem cell research.
To establish a foundation for a discussion of
ethics. Khan first defined the term and elaborat
ed on its historic interplay with religion.
"Ethics has to do with what ought to be
done," he said. "In Islam, as in many other reli
gions. the human faculties of knowing are con
tingent on God. Islam is an ontology based on
theocentricity. and from the Islamic perspective,
what ought to be done is that which is consistent
with Godliness and holiness."
Khan then explored the source for human
behavior.
"Human behavior is defined and inspired by
ruh or the spirit or breath of God," he said.
The Muslim, Khan stressed, attempts to
achieve taqwa or a heightened consciousness of

the divine.
"The goal of any Muslim is to act as Mo
hammed and his companions would have
acted," he said.
From behavior. Khan moved to a discussion
of societal codes. In doing so, the ethicist clari
fied the concept of Sharia.
"Shariu, from its etymological source, is the
path," Khan said. "Sharia is really an amalgama
tion of a code of conduct. It very much parallels
the Hindu notion of dharnta and is not solely
limited to legalism. That is a Western construct
that has been branded onto the term."
In establishing a foundation for Islam and
ethics. Khan emphasized the lack of absolute
thought central to Islam.
"There is no one way of doing things," he said.
"True Muslim law is free of absolutism, lliere
will be differences of opinion. It is the intention

behind what you do that is important
in terms of its spiritual value."
Khan then described a series of
modern ethical issues and explored
Islamic perspectives in those situa
tions. Central to Islamic ethics, he ar
gued, is the protection of the person,
which manifests itself in patient au
tonomy and euthanasia cases. In
terms of death, meanwhile, Islam
shares the consensus of Western
medicine.
"The Islamic consensus on death
is to assume the diagnosis of brain
death by allopathic definitions,"
Khan said. "At that point, it is ethi
cal, from an Islamic perspective, to
withhold life support."
The most controversial issue that
Khan tackled was abortion. Here,
Khan also discussed Islamic notions
of life.
"Termination of pregnancy is
only permissible for therapeutic rea
sons, like the mother's health," Khan
said."ln situations that don't involve
the mother's health, abortion is con
sidered from extremely reprehensi
ble and forbidden to inherently sin
ful. There is also a definite time
when the fetus becomes a living
being from an Islamic perspective.
This differs from 40 days to 80 days
to 120 days, depending on interpre
tation."
In describing the Islamic view
point on bioethics, Khan con
demned absolute interpretation of
the law.
"The normative understanding
of Sharia regrettably in most Mus
lim countries is actually black-and
white," he said. "In popular practice,
faith is made absolute. This is a
human defect in understanding reli
gion. It is crucial to understand that
Islamic ethics is not absolute."
Khan's lecture was well received
by an audience of approximately 60
listeners. The audience reflected a
diverse group of students, and many,
like junior Omair Saadat, found the
speaker to be well-informed.
"I was impressed by the speak

er's breadth of knowledge," Saadat
said. "A lot of health policy is dictat
ed by religion or politicians trying to
cater to religious groups. I was
amazed by the speaker's knowledge
of the issues."
Junior Omar Shakir, president of
the Muslim Students Awareness
Network (MSAN), shared Saadat's
sentiment and described the organi
zation's motivations for bringing
Khan to speak on campus.
"Our initial idea was that, this
year, we wanted to tackle contempo
rary issues," Shakir said. "We, as
Muslims, believe that Islam provides

the lens with which to view issues.
Dr. Khan is a top expert in the field
of hioethics, who could speak from
both a religious and secular hack
ground."
Overall, Shakir deemed Islam
Awareness Month as a success and
believed it to be effective on campus.
"1 think that we had a lot of dis
cussion and dialogue," he said. "I
mean people continued these dis
cussions outsides the walls of the
event in their classrooms and dorms.
1 think that it was effective in that
sense, and such dialogue is central to
MSAN outreach to students."

Islam Awareness Month concluded yester
day with a lecture on Islam and bioethics at the
Bechtel International Center hosted by
renowned emergency room surgeon and Is
lamic ethicist Faiz Khan.The event marked the
end to month-long discussions on Islam and Is
lamic perspectives on contemporary interna
tional issues.
Designed to increase awareness of Islam, to
remove misconceptions regarding the religion
and its practice and to encourage discourse
among Stanford students, this year's Islam
Awareness Month has sponsored five lectures

and attracted hundreds to issues on poverty,
racism and the environment. The lecture on
bioethics was equally comprehensive, address
ing issues from contraceptives and abortion to
euthanasia and stem cell research.
To establish a foundation for a discussion of
ethics. Khan first defined the term and elaborat
ed on its historic interplay with religion.
"Ethics has to do with what ought to be
done," he said. "In Islam, as in many other reli
gions. the human faculties of knowing are con
tingent on God. Islam is an ontology based on
theocentricity. and from the Islamic perspective,
what ought to be done is that which is consistent
with Godliness and holiness."
Khan then explored the source for human
behavior.
"Human behavior is defined and inspired by
ruh or the spirit or breath of God," he said.
The Muslim, Khan stressed, attempts to
achieve taqwa or a heightened consciousness of

the divine.
"The goal of any Muslim is to act as Mo
hammed and his companions would have
acted," he said.
From behavior. Khan moved to a discussion
of societal codes. In doing so, the ethicist clari
fied the concept of Sharia.
"Shariu, from its etymological source, is the
path," Khan said. "Sharia is really an amalgama
tion of a code of conduct. It very much parallels
the Hindu notion of dharnta and is not solely
limited to legalism. That is a Western construct
that has been branded onto the term."
In establishing a foundation for Islam and
ethics. Khan emphasized the lack of absolute
thought central to Islam.
"There is no one way of doing things," he said.
"True Muslim law is free of absolutism, lliere
will be differences of opinion. It is the intention

behind what you do that is important
in terms of its spiritual value."
Khan then described a series of
modern ethical issues and explored
Islamic perspectives in those situa
tions. Central to Islamic ethics, he ar
gued, is the protection of the person,
which manifests itself in patient au
tonomy and euthanasia cases. In
terms of death, meanwhile, Islam
shares the consensus of Western
medicine.
"The Islamic consensus on death
is to assume the diagnosis of brain
death by allopathic definitions,"
Khan said. "At that point, it is ethi
cal, from an Islamic perspective, to
withhold life support."
The most controversial issue that
Khan tackled was abortion. Here,
Khan also discussed Islamic notions
of life.
"Termination of pregnancy is
only permissible for therapeutic rea
sons, like the mother's health," Khan
said."ln situations that don't involve
the mother's health, abortion is con
sidered from extremely reprehensi
ble and forbidden to inherently sin
ful. There is also a definite time
when the fetus becomes a living
being from an Islamic perspective.
This differs from 40 days to 80 days
to 120 days, depending on interpre
tation."
In describing the Islamic view
point on bioethics, Khan con
demned absolute interpretation of
the law.
"The normative understanding
of Sharia regrettably in most Mus
lim countries is actually black-and
white," he said. "In popular practice,
faith is made absolute. This is a
human defect in understanding reli
gion. It is crucial to understand that
Islamic ethics is not absolute."
Khan's lecture was well received
by an audience of approximately 60
listeners. The audience reflected a
diverse group of students, and many,
like junior Omair Saadat, found the
speaker to be well-informed.
"I was impressed by the speak

er's breadth of knowledge," Saadat
said. "A lot of health policy is dictat
ed by religion or politicians trying to
cater to religious groups. I was
amazed by the speaker's knowledge
of the issues."
Junior Omar Shakir, president of
the Muslim Students Awareness
Network (MSAN), shared Saadat's
sentiment and described the organi
zation's motivations for bringing
Khan to speak on campus.
"Our initial idea was that, this
year, we wanted to tackle contempo
rary issues," Shakir said. "We, as
Muslims, believe that Islam provides

the lens with which to view issues.
Dr. Khan is a top expert in the field
of hioethics, who could speak from
both a religious and secular hack
ground."
Overall, Shakir deemed Islam
Awareness Month as a success and
believed it to be effective on campus.
"1 think that we had a lot of dis
cussion and dialogue," he said. "I
mean people continued these dis
cussions outsides the walls of the
event in their classrooms and dorms.

sense, and such dialogue is central to
MSAN outreach to students."
