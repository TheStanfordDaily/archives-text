### AMIT ARORA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Islam Awareness Month concluded yester
day with a lecture on Islam and bioethics at the
Bechtel International Center hosted by
renowned emergency room surgeon and Is
lamic ethicist Faiz Khan.The event marked the
end to month-long discussions on Islam and Is
lamic perspectives on contemporary interna
tional issues.
Designed to increase awareness of Islam, to
remove misconceptions regarding the religion
and its practice and to encourage discourse
among Stanford students, this year's Islam
Awareness Month has sponsored five lectures

and attracted hundreds to issues on poverty,
racism and the environment. The lecture on
bioethics was equally comprehensive, address
ing issues from contraceptives and abortion to
euthanasia and stem cell research.
To establish a foundation for a discussion of
ethics. Khan first defined the term and elaborat
ed on its historic interplay with religion.
"Ethics has to do with what ought to be
done," he said. "In Islam, as in many other reli
gions. the human faculties of knowing are con
tingent on God. Islam is an ontology based on
theocentricity. and from the Islamic perspective,
what ought to be done is that which is consistent
with Godliness and holiness."
Khan then explored the source for human
behavior.
"Human behavior is defined and inspired by
ruh or the spirit or breath of God," he said.
The Muslim, Khan stressed, attempts to
achieve taqwa or a heightened consciousness of

the divine.
"The goal of any Muslim is to act as Mo
hammed and his companions would have
acted," he said.
From behavior. Khan moved to a discussion
of societal codes. In doing so, the ethicist clari
fied the concept of Sharia.
"Shariu, from its etymological source, is the
path," Khan said. "Sharia is really an amalgama
tion of a code of conduct. It very much parallels
the Hindu notion of dharnta and is not solely
limited to legalism. That is a Western construct
that has been branded onto the term."
In establishing a foundation for Islam and
ethics. Khan emphasized the lack of absolute
thought central to Islam.
"There is no one way of doing things," he said.
"True Muslim law is free of absolutism, lliere
will be differences of opinion. It is the intention
