(AP) — The deadly HSNI bird flu virus has
killed 15 wild swans in southeastern France, agricul
ture officials said Sunday, raising fears the lethal
strain could spread in the European Union's lead
ing producer of poultry.
The news of the dead swans came a day after
French authorities confirmed that a nearby turkey
farm of more than 11,000 birds had been contami
nated— the European Union's first outbreak of
deadly bird flu in commercial poultry.
The dead swans were found around the numer
ous ponds that dot the southeast area.
Switzerland, meanwhile, reported Sunday that
an H5 subtype of bird flu has been found in a dead
duck in Geneva, and tests were pending to deter
mine if it was the HSNI strain, which hasn't yet
been reported in the country.
The lethal HSNI bird flu strain has spread from
Asia to at least 10 European countries and Africa,
and scientists fear it could mutate into a form that is
easily transmitted between humans.sparking a pan

The disease has killed more than 90 people,
mostly in Southeast Asia, according to the World
Health Organization. No human cases have been
reported anywhere in Europe.
The dead duck in Switzerland was found
Wednesday between two boats at a Lake Geneva
pier, said Gottlieb Dandliker, a fauna inspector.
Swiss authorities said they were erecting a pro
tective zone around the area where the duck was
found.
Hans Wyss, director of the Switzerland's veteri
nary office, said officials have been prepared for the
possibility of bird flu reaching Geneva after Ger
many and France both reported their first cases of
the disease in wild fowl earlier this month.
In India, thousands of workers in the poultry in
dustry have lost their jobs amid plunging demand
for chicken after the country reported its first case
of bird flu last week, an official said Sunday.
India's poultry industry has reported losses to
taling about $1.1 billion since bird flu was detected
last week. The Hindu Business Line newspaper re
ported.
In the northern Uttar Pradesh state, among
India's largest poultry producers, more than 60 per
cent of the state's 2.5 million poultry workers have
lost their jobs, said Mukesh Singh, a poultry compa
ny executive.
Although experts say bird flu cannot be con
tracted from eating properly cooked food, millions
of people in India have stopped eating chicken and
eggs because of fears of the disease, threatening to
derail India's fast-growing $13.6 billion poultry in
dustry.
