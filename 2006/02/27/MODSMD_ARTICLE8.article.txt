# Soldiers quell terrorism-related Kabul prison riot
## 
### AMIR SHAH ASSOCIATED PRESS 
(AP) — Summary executions of prisoners took place
at the Policharki prison during the Soviet occupation of
Afghanistan and the Taliban rule of the country. On Sun
day, it was the inmates who were in charge.
Hundreds of Afghan soldiers with tanks and grenade
launchers surrounded Kabul's main prison Sunday after
rioting inmates seized control of much of the facility in an
uprising that officials blamed on al-Qaida and Taliban
militants.
Local media reported several people were killed and
dozens injured. But it appeared security forces had yet to
gain access to parts of the jail under prisoners' control, so
officials could not confirm reports of casualties. One offi
cial said at least four inmates were injured.
Gunshots occasionally rang out as troops tried to keep
the prisoners bottled up. Officials said the rioters did not
have any firearms but had armed themselves with small
knives and clubs fashioned from wrecked furniture.
Smoke could be seen curling out of some cell windows,
where inmates apparently set fire to bedding and furni
ture.
Government negotiators late Sunday suspended talks
to end the standoff at the notorious Policharki jail, which
later this year is slated to receive dozens of Afghans cur
rently in U.S. military's Guantanamo prison.
The riot broke out late Saturday in Block Two of the
prison, which houses about 1,300 of the 2,000 inmates. Of
ficials said the violence began when inmates refused to
put on new uniforms, which were ordered after seven Tal

iban prisoners escaped last month by disguising them
selves as visitors.
Officials said some 350 al-Oaida and Taliban loyalists
were among the inmates in that block. Abdul Salaam Bak
shi, chief of prisons in Afghanistan, accused them of incit
ing the other prisoners, mostly common criminals.
He said no inmates escaped from the prison block but
guards had been forced out.
The Afghan army said it deployed 800 soldiers around
the prison. Along with NATO peacekeepers, they parked
at least 10 tanks and armored personnel carriers outside
the gates.
"We have surrounded the jail. There's no way to es
cape," Mohammed Qasim Hashimzai, deputy justice min
ister, said.
Hashimzai. who was part of a government delegation
that came to negotiate with the prisoners,said at least four
inmates had been hurt.
He said about 100 of the rioters from Block Two had
taken control of the neighboring wing of the jail housing
about 70 women.
Another senior government official, who would speak
only on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity
of the matter, said prisoners had dug a tunnel to the
women's wing — explaining how they had managed to in
filtrate it.
Hashimzai said attempts to negotiate the release of the
women from the rioters' control floundered because of
disunity among the inmates and confusion over their var
ious demands. Prisoners also backtracked on an agree
ment to hand over their injured to the International Red
Cross, he said.

"Unfortunately, the prisoners have no unity and have
different demands. There's no one leader who can talk to
us," Hashimzai said as he left the prison around dusk,
adding that officials would try to resume negotiations
Monday.
He gave no details about the prisoners' demands. But
Ezamary, an army battalion commander who like many
Afghans uses only a single name, said inmates had dropped
notes from the windows complaining about the justice sys
tem and prison conditions.
"We are human beings!" he quoted inmates as shout
ing. Others could be heard bellowing "God is great!" be
tween volleys of gunfire.
Policharici, which lies on the eastern outskirts of Kabul,
was built in the 1970s and has earned notoriety for its
harsh and crowded conditions. It is under renovation to
improve living conditions and security.
Afghan officials say some 110 Afghan terrorism sus
pects are expected to be transferred there later this year
from the prison at the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba.
Riots and breakouts have cast doubts over its readi
ness.
In December 2004, four inmates and four guards died
during a 10-hour standoff that started when al-Qaida mil
itants used razors to wrest guns from guards and then tried
to break out. Afghan troops stormed the prison and fired
guns and rocket-propelled grenades to retake control.
During the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan from
1979-89, Policharki housed opponents of the Communist
installed regime, and torture and execution of prisoners
were commonplace.
