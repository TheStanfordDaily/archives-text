# "Da Vinci" author sued for copying

### DAVID STRINGER ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER 
LONDON (AP) — It's the latest twist for the mega
selling conspiracy thriller "The Da Vinci Code": a law
suit against the hook's publisher for breach of copyright
that could taint the novel and delay the much-anticipat
ed movie version.
Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, authors of the
1982 nonfiction book "The Holy Blood and the Holy
Grail," are suing publisher Random House, Inc. over the
allegation that parts of their work formed the basis of
Dan Brown's novel, which has sold more than 40 million
copies worldwide and remains high on best seller lists
nearly three years after publication.
If the writers succeed in securing an injunction to bar
the use of their material, they could hold up the sched
uled May 19 release of "The Da Vinci Code" film, star
ring Tom Hanks and directed by Ron Howard.
Brown, who rarely speaks to the media,sat attentive
ly before a judge in London's High Court, a short walk
from Temple Church — the place of worship founded
by the Knights Templar — which figures in his novel. A
New Hampshire native who still lives in his home state
and has been working on a new novel. Brown is expect
ed to give evidence here next week.
Brown, was "interested in taking, and took,short cuts
rather than doing any of the work himself." Jonathan
Rayner James, lawyer for Baigent and Leigh, told the
court.
Baigent, born in New Zealand, and Leigh, originally
from the United States, are suing Random House,
which also published their book. The company denies
the claim and chief executive Gail Rebuck said in a
statement that she believed the lawsuit was without
merit.
Both books hinge on the theory that Jesus married
Mary Magdalene and they had a child, and that blood
line survives to this day. The earlier book set out the no
tion that Christ did not die on the cross but lived later in
France.
James said his case was not attempting to "stultify
creative endeavor," or to claim a monopoly on ideas or
historical debate, but to prove that Brown had "relied
heavily" on the earlier work, published in Britain in
1982 and the following year in the United States.
Though it does not relate to theft of specific sections
of text, the case involves the alleged appropriation of
themes and ideas from the earlier work, James said.
