# Graduate Life
## An albatross around my neck 
### 
I did a hellish thing in my last column. 1
derided the job search process — mocked
at resumes, scoffed at the interview
ordeal, and by presuming to be doing career
counseling, I slayed it. I was scared to death
with the prospect of ending up a jobless grad
student crying out. "Jobs, jobs everywhere,
and all the interviews are long done;jobs,jobs
everywhere, and I didn't find a single one."
So, I decided to pay the penance by telling the
tale of "real career counseling" to the grad
students. And remember."you cannot choose
but hear."
Did you know that over 18 different
industries recruited for grad students at the
fall career fair? Do you know that the visual
appearance of your resume is very
important? Do you know that a cover letter is
not supposed to be a verbatim repetition of
your resume? Do you know whether or not
you should talk about salary at your first
interview? Do you know that the average
starting salary of a consultant is $120,000 and
that of a professor is $77,794? Do you know
that life-after-postdoc, whatever little is left,
can be beautiful with many different career
options? Damn it! Do you even know that
there is someone called Stephanie Eberle at
the Career Development Center specifically
for answering the career concerns of grad
students?
No, you don't go for career counseling
when all your career-seeking efforts have
failed. It's not a hospital emergency room
where you go with your arms broken, blood
gushing out of your nose and they fix you.
They cannot. But if you go to them
sufficiently early, they can help you think
through the process of deciding for yourself
what the best career option is.
Neither do you have to sing permanent
good-bye songs to academic life in music if
you didn't like your Ph.D. thesis focus area.
You do not have to teach psychology to
jarring students all your life if you graduated
with a psychology degree — you could
rather, like one of our Stanford alumni,
become the director of research at the Los
Angeles Zoo.
Rearranging research results to meet the
demands of defending dissertations at the
final stages of your grad student career
doesn't leave enough time for you to ponder
over the question of "to be an academician or
not to be."
Hence, start early. Register at the CDC
and schedule an appointment with a career
counselor. Maybe go to the "Ask a Career
Counselor series," held every Wednesday at
the Women's Community Center from 4 to 5
p.m., where Stephanie answers questions
about resumes and curriculum vitae — yes,
they are different — cover letters, interviews
and everything else career-related. And. if
you still need incentive, there is food too. Or
go the "Academic Job Search" series given in
October and November to know how to get
set and go for the faculty career.
Back in the old days, you could be offered
assistant professor positions just because you
had published papers explaining
photoelectric effect, the theory of relativity
and Brownian motion. Not anymore. You of
course still have to publish extensively. But to
get an academic job at a top university, you
also have to write well-designed and
organized curriculum vitae clearly labeling
information that can be of special interest to
search committee members, obtain letters of
reference and prepare, practice and then
deliver a perfect job talk.
Sound daunting? Well, the CDC can help.
Or you also can talk to Stanford alumni —
these benevolent generous souls — who have
listed their contact information at the
Stanford Career Network in order to help
you find a job.
But maybe you want to seek alternatives.
You were doing a Ph.D. just because your
parents always wanted to call you doctor, and
you're now intimated by the prospect of
running on the tenure track for a faculty. Or
maybe you just prefer more money to less
and hence, instead of helping your advisor in
his sacred duty of "intellectual
reproduction," you want to defect to the
darker side of business.
Not sure how your Ph.D. work can help
you get a consultant job? Contact the CDC.
Want to learn which of your skills may be of
interest to recruiters in entertainment or
engineering, investment banking or
insurance, non-profit or government (which
we know is 'for-profit') and many others?
Contact the CDC. It's the one-stop shop for
all your career needs, and. what's more — it's
all free.

you're now intimated by the prospect of
running on the tenure track for a faculty. Or
maybe you just prefer more money to less
and hence, instead of helping your advisor in
his sacred duty of "intellectual
reproduction," you want to defect to the
darker side of business.
Not sure how your Ph.D. work can help
you get a consultant job? Contact the CDC.
Want to learn which of your skills may be of
interest to recruiters in entertainment or
engineering, investment banking or
insurance, non-profit or government (which
we know is 'for-profit') and many others?
Contact the CDC. It's the one-stop shop for
all your career needs, and. what's more — it's
all free.
