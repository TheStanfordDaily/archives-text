If you're interested in good food and international
diversity, then expect to have a good time at the
fifth annual Graduate Student International Gala
on Saturday, March 4. Hie Gala, which celebrates
diversity through cultural performance and
international food, is free of charge and will begin at ft
p.m. at the Frances C. Arrillaga Alumni Center.
Saturdays gala will include a vast array of tasty ethnic
foods, cultural performances and opportunities to learn
more about various cultures.
"Expect to taste food from 14 different countries,
view cultural displays from over 15 different
international student groups and experience dynamic
cultural performances from 12 different individuals or
performance groups," says Gala committee member
ChaÃŸandle Jordan, a genetics student at the School of
Medicine. "At the gala, you can immerse yourself into
the cultural diversity of the University. You will get a
chance to chat with people from all over the world, see
the beauty of national costumes, and enjoy the
performances put up by students themselves. It is an
evening of sharing and appreciating the cultures present
at the University."
The Graduate Student International Gala committee, in
charge of Saturday's event, is co-chaired by Anshul Agarwal, a
graduate student in petroleum engineering, and Lumina

Albert, a doctoral research scholar in the Psychology'
Department. They, along with Jordan, are also Escondido
Village Community Associates (CAs).
"The gala is a smaller and more formal version of the
International Festival, hosted by the Bechtel
International Center in the spring," Jordan explains.
"Their advice and template was essential in designing
the event."
The gala, created by a team of Escondido Village CAs
and the Graduate Student Programming Board
(GSPB), was first held on Feb. 2, 2002 and has been
popular with graduate students ever since.
CAs and the Graduate Student Programming Board
are under the umbrella of the Graduate Life Office.
"In graduate student surveys, international and non
international students often mention that the Graduate
Student International Gala is one of their favorite events
of the year," says Jordan. "It allows us to celebrate our
small communities and to actively participate in the
community of others."
The diversity of this year's gala will draw from
participating student associations who represent many
countries, Jordan adds. Those counties include China,
India, Pakistan. Romania and Vietnam, among others.
Jordan emphasizes the help that Graduate Life
Office and the Office of Multicultural Affairs has given
to the gala committee.

leaders in charge of this year's event.
"The actual work of organizing the event is done by
graduate student enthusiasts who care about the international
diversity on campus and want to provide opportunities to learn
about the countries and cultures represented on campus." Pals
says."The gala would not be possible without the work by
international student organizations. They are the ones putting
up the performances, showing their culture, and selecting the
food tasting."
In addition to offering delicious foods and exposure
to a multitude of culture, the gala has become a
University mainstay because it is one of the largest
cultural traditions on campus
"With more than 20 student groups and more than
1.000 spectators, the gala is one of the best venues on
campus to share one's culture with other graduate
students," Pals says.
