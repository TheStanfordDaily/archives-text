# International students face cultural challenges in their transitions to the Farm
## "Being an international student is different in several accounts relating to culture and customs, as many of the procedures — housing utilities, banks, etc. — differ from those at home."

Fall quarter, 2,679 international graduate
students were enrolled at Stanford,
comprising 32.7% of the graduate
student population according to information
released by the Bechtel International
Center. The "top 10" countries represented
by international graduate students are, in
order — China. India, South Korea, Canada,
Taiwan. France, Singapore, Japan. Turkey
and Germany.
Most international graduate students are
in the engineering department. There are
also significant numbers in the business,
computer science, and physics and applied
sciences departments. However, most
international graduate students are studying
engineering and, following the overall
gender ratio of graduate students, they are
also mostly male. In 2005, there were 720
female international graduate students
compared to 1,959 male international
graduate students.
Many international students look to
Bechtel International Center for
information on immigration and visa laws, as
well as for programming to cope with
possible culture shock and the transition to
living in a different country.
"Bechtel's role is broader than just
immigration advising, though that is a major
part of our work with international
graduate students," says John Pearson,
director of the Bechtel International
Center. "Our goal in this area is to ensure
that international graduate students can
succeed in their academic goals without
having to continually worry about
immigration issues. We do this through
workshops, individual advising, a weeklong
orientation program and e-mail and web

outreach to students and departments. We
also offer advising to families of
international students and support
international student organizations
through programming funds and the
facilities of the building."
For many international students, move-in
day to The Farm is not as simple as packing
up the car or jumping on an airplane.
"Being an international student is
different in several accounts relating to
culture and customs, as many of the
procedures — housing, utilities, banks, etc.
— differ from those at home," explains
Ibrahim Saad A 1 Mojel. a doctoral candidate
in management science and engineering
who is from Saudi Arabia. "With time, all of
these 'difficulties' became part of life.
However, things changed since 9/11, as now
I can't feel secure about my studies. I know
of several of my friends who didn't see their
families for years out of fear of not getting a
visa to conic back. As for myself, before
beginning the Ph.D. program I applied for a
visa... Now my visa will expire in 2007, and I
will not go home after that until I finish my
Ph.D."
Bechtel International Center offers
several programs and activities for their
families.
"Many international graduate students
are accompanied at Stanford by their

spouses, and in some cases, children," says
Gwyn Dukes the Adviser to International
Families at the Bechtel International Center.
"Often spouses of international students
teach informal classes at the I-Center in their
language, or the cuisine of their area, or lead
discussions on "Hot Topics in Europe" and
other timely subjects."
Indeed immigration restrictions after 9/11
have drastically affected many international
graduate students and their ability to go
home.
"After 9/11, the U.S takes a stricter policy
about the visa for international students,"
explains international graduate student
Zhou Huang, from China. "This impact
varies depending on home countries, major
and admitted universities. For example,
students in sensitive majors, without
financial aid, or from some certain countries
may have more difficulties with visas. The
good news is this situation is much better in
the last year."
Still, coming as an international student
has advantages.
"On a positive note, as an international
student, I don't only benefit from my course
of studies but also from the exposure to a
different culture and ideas," Al-Mojel says.
"This has been,by far, what most affected my
experience here. This has been my first
choice and I am grateful that I have the

chance to study here."
Many international students also have to
deal with the problem of language
transitions.
"First, language is still a main problem,"
Huang says. "Although international
students have to show proof of English
proficiency to get admitted by Stanford, the
English levels vary a lot. I think the English
proficiency is extremely important to
international students in the aspects of
communication with others, academic
performance and career success."
Stanford provides many opportunities for
international graduate students to improve
their English, such as EIA (English in
Action) programs offered by the Bechtel
International Center.
"These programs are much better than
most public universities," Huang says, "but
Stanford could have done better, compared
with other top universities like Harvard."
Nevertheless, many international
graduate students continue to come to
Stanford for its reputation and highly ranked
programs.
"1 came to Stanford as it has the unique
characteristic of being a top school and in the
heart of the Silicon Valley," says Mohamad
Charafeddine. a doctoral candidate in
Electrical Engineering, who is from
Lebanon. "Being from the Middle East, and
apart from academia.one cannot escape nor
ignore the political clout of the events
unfolding in the region. Sometimes we find
solace in diffusing some of our energy and
voicing our concerns by participating in the
political and cultural students' organizations
on campus. 1 think the same goes for any
international student. Sometimes we feel we
need to induce change, although
predominantly it's a local one at the current
circumstances."

Action) programs offered by the Bechtel
International Center.
"These programs are much better than
most public universities," Huang says, "but
Stanford could have done better, compared
with other top universities like Harvard."
Nevertheless, many international
graduate students continue to come to
Stanford for its reputation and highly ranked
programs.
"1 came to Stanford as it has the unique
characteristic of being a top school and in the
heart of the Silicon Valley," says Mohamad
Charafeddine. a doctoral candidate in
Electrical Engineering, who is from
Lebanon. "Being from the Middle East, and
apart from academia.one cannot escape nor
ignore the political clout of the events
unfolding in the region. Sometimes we find
solace in diffusing some of our energy and
voicing our concerns by participating in the
political and cultural students' organizations
on campus. 1 think the same goes for any
international student. Sometimes we feel we
need to induce change, although
predominantly it's a local one at the current
circumstances."

Fall quarter, 2,679 international graduate
students were enrolled at Stanford,
comprising 32.7% of the graduate
student population according to information
released by the Bechtel International
Center. The "top 10" countries represented
by international graduate students are, in
order — China. India, South Korea, Canada,
Taiwan. France, Singapore, Japan. Turkey
and Germany.
Most international graduate students are
in the engineering department. There are
also significant numbers in the business,
computer science, and physics and applied
sciences departments. However, most
international graduate students are studying
engineering and, following the overall
gender ratio of graduate students, they are
also mostly male. In 2005, there were 720
female international graduate students
compared to 1,959 male international
graduate students.
Many international students look to
Bechtel International Center for
information on immigration and visa laws, as
well as for programming to cope with
possible culture shock and the transition to
living in a different country.
"Bechtel's role is broader than just
immigration advising, though that is a major
part of our work with international
graduate students," says John Pearson,
director of the Bechtel International
Center. "Our goal in this area is to ensure
that international graduate students can
succeed in their academic goals without
having to continually worry about
immigration issues. We do this through
workshops, individual advising, a weeklong
orientation program and e-mail and web

outreach to students and departments. We
also offer advising to families of
international students and support
international student organizations
through programming funds and the
facilities of the building."
For many international students, move-in
day to The Farm is not as simple as packing
up the car or jumping on an airplane.
"Being an international student is
different in several accounts relating to
culture and customs, as many of the
procedures — housing, utilities, banks, etc.
— differ from those at home," explains
Ibrahim Saad A 1 Mojel. a doctoral candidate
in management science and engineering
who is from Saudi Arabia. "With time, all of
these 'difficulties' became part of life.
However, things changed since 9/11, as now
I can't feel secure about my studies. I know
of several of my friends who didn't see their
families for years out of fear of not getting a
visa to conic back. As for myself, before
beginning the Ph.D. program I applied for a
visa... Now my visa will expire in 2007, and I
will not go home after that until I finish my
Ph.D."
Bechtel International Center offers
several programs and activities for their
families.
"Many international graduate students
are accompanied at Stanford by their

spouses, and in some cases, children," says
Gwyn Dukes the Adviser to International
Families at the Bechtel International Center.
"Often spouses of international students
teach informal classes at the I-Center in their
language, or the cuisine of their area, or lead
discussions on "Hot Topics in Europe" and
other timely subjects."
Indeed immigration restrictions after 9/11
have drastically affected many international
graduate students and their ability to go
home.
"After 9/11, the U.S takes a stricter policy
about the visa for international students,"
explains international graduate student
Zhou Huang, from China. "This impact
varies depending on home countries, major
and admitted universities. For example,
students in sensitive majors, without
financial aid, or from some certain countries
may have more difficulties with visas. The
good news is this situation is much better in
the last year."
Still, coming as an international student
has advantages.
"On a positive note, as an international
student, I don't only benefit from my course
of studies but also from the exposure to a
different culture and ideas," Al-Mojel says.
"This has been,by far, what most affected my
experience here. This has been my first
choice and I am grateful that I have the

chance to study here."
Many international students also have to
deal with the problem of language
transitions.
"First, language is still a main problem,"
Huang says. "Although international
students have to show proof of English
proficiency to get admitted by Stanford, the
English levels vary a lot. I think the English
proficiency is extremely important to
international students in the aspects of
communication with others, academic
performance and career success."
Stanford provides many opportunities for
international graduate students to improve
their English, such as EIA (English in
Action) programs offered by the Bechtel
International Center.
"These programs are much better than
most public universities," Huang says, "but
Stanford could have done better, compared
with other top universities like Harvard."
Nevertheless, many international
graduate students continue to come to
