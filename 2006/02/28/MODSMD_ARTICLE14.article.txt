## Editorial The
						Tree: More than a piece of lumber 
### 
The Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band can hardly claim to be
the most serious of musical ensembles
around. From the long list of stadiums the
Band can claim to have been kicked out of to
the resounding chorus of boos they receive
when they run onto the field at schools like
USC, the Band has a reputation for mayhem
and mishap.
Recently, its profile on Stanford's campus
has been raised with an unusual Tree Week,
previous to which the reigning Tree, cotermi
nal student Erin Lashnits, was suspended for
the rest of the year and taken out of the au
ditioning process. As reported in The Daily,
the reasons given for Lashnits' removal as
Stanford's unofficial mascot include atten
dance, punctuality and "attitude to her posi
tion," as well as the final straw — violating
the Band's alcohol policy.
It is ironic that the symbol of the Band
was removed for violating alcohol policies.
However, this incident reminds us that while
alcohol can at times provide necessary social
lubrication, we need to drink responsibly.
While running around screaming and acting
intoxicated is acceptable behavior for the
Tree, failing a breathalyzer test is not. The
message, of course, is that neither fun nor in
sanity requires intoxication.
At the same time, however, we should
recognize that the antics of the Tree and the
Band help to unify the campus and promote

Stanford's image as one of the more relaxed
of the top-caliber schools.
Let's face it — Stanford doesn't actually
have a mascot, unless you consider a shade
of red to be a suitable candidate. Something
tells us that Stanford students would be less
inclined to rally around a color than around
a singing, dancing, hyperactive Tree.
We wouldn't have picked the Tree as a
mascot if all we wanted it to do was act like a
piece of lumber. Obviously, the Tree was
chosen because it represented a fun-loving
side of the University. In this light, a proper
ly irreverent figure like the Tree is still a suit
able Stanford institution. All work and no
play, after all, would make Stanford a dull
university.
Hopefully, when this controversy comes
to a close with the selection of a newTree,the
Band will still be the Band — an unending
source of laughs for Stanford students, shock
and amazement for prospective freshmen
and visiting friends, horror for parents and
income for companies like Anheiser-Busch
and Miller.
To many, the Band is a proud Stanford
tradition. But above all, it is a reminder to all
of us that this is college, and college is sup
posed to be the best four years of our lives.
And whatever different paths we may pur
sue academically, when all is said and done,
we should all be able to come together to
throw furniture off the roof of the Shak.
