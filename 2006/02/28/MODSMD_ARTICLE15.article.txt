# The 						art of the away message
## 
### 
You can tell a lot about people by what
they say when they're not there. Just
open up your AIM buddy list and
click on a few names, and before you know it
you'll know exactly what is going on in every
one of your friends' lives. Well, sort of. What
a person puts in his away message is a great
clue to what kind of person he really is.
Some people actually use their away mes
sages to say where they are or what they are
doing. (What a novel idea!) Nosy people that
we are, we college students do enjoy know
ing exactly where our friends are at all times.
But our nosiness is outweighed by our love
of procrastination. Thus, we are much more
appreciative of interesting away messages
that give as an excuse to keep reading them
rather than begin typing that history paper
that's due in an hour.
How might one go about creating such an
interesting away message? A good place to
start is on iTUnes; when a song comes on that
seems to speak to you, Google the lyrics then
copy and paste a line or two into that little
text box. Boom, you've got a Pulitzer Prize
worthy away message — and you've proven
to the world what great taste in music you
have.
The great thing about song lyrics is that
they are entirely ambiguous. The people
reading your away message don't need to
know why you're quoting Alicia Keys' song
"Karma" when you write, "What goes
around comes around." Sure, they can prob
ably guess that you're not happy about
something, but it's a little more tactful than
writing, "My best friend is a fugly slut who I
am not speaking to because last night she
made out with the guy I had a crush on."
Even if your emotions are a little less dra
matic, it's nice to maintain a sense of mystery
and subtlety. For instance, I am currently
using Oasis lyrics as my away message —
the exact meaning of which is left up to the
reader to figure out
Depending on your choice of song, lyrics
can illustrate a practically endless range of
emotions — I've used everything from
Madonna to Cake to "You're a Mean One,
Mr. Grinch" (for when I'm feeling especially
joyful around Christmas-time).The correla
tion between song choice and emotion is es
pecially evident when somebody on your
buddy list finds a new love interest to obsess
over. As her — and her away messages —
sentimentality increases exponentially, man

hating lyrics from Fiona Apple are suddenly
replaced with Louis Armstrong's "What a
Wonderful World."
Of course, song lyrics aren't the only way
you can let the entire world (or at least
everyone on your buddy list) know how you
are feeling without having to explicitly admit
that, yes, you really do have emotions. Ex
cerpts from your daily horoscope are great;
whether you believe in astrology or not, you
can always find something in there that re
flects your mood on any given day. Quotes
from movies,TV shows, famous people, your
little sister or your perpetually drunk friend
can also be quite astute.
Whatever you do, keep in mind that there
is nothing more annoying than an away mes
sage left on default. Nobody wants to click
on your profile in search of a thought-pro
voking, insightful or — at the very least —
funny peek into the inner workings of your
mind, only to have their hopes thwarted by:
"I am away from my computer right now."
Not only is that type of away message boring
and uncreative, but it doesn't even have the
practical application of letting people know
where you are other than sitting in front of
your computer screen — even a simple "at
class" or "dinner" would be better.
So the next time you leave your room,
take an extra 30 seconds to come up with
some witty remark for your friends to read.
They'll appreciate the distraction, and you
never know, your away message could be
just the inspiration they need to finish that
paper. Okay, maybe that's a stretch — but at
least they'll have someone else to blame
when they realize that they've wasted away
the entire night pondering the deeper mean
ing of Backstreet Boys lyrics.

Do you have a favorite away message (either
your own or one that you ve read while you
were "working") Send it to Stephanie at sa
lessi@stanford.edu. If she likes it, she may steal
it and use it as her own.
