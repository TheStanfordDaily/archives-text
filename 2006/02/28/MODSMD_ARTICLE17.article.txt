# Principles for public restroom design
## 
### 
After stirring up a huge amount of con
troversy among Harry Potter fans for
advocating the kidnap of J.K. Rowl
ing in my last column. 1 decided to write this
week's article about a topic on which every
one can agree — public restrooms.
Sex Separation
Restricting one-person bathrooms to a
single sex when there are clearly huge num
bers of people of the other sex standing out
side hopping about in desperation is easily
one of the most ridiculous things I have ever
seen. When I am the victim of useless sex sep
aration. I furtively peer about to ensure that
no one can see me and then use the women's
restroom (I always lift up the toilet seat
though, I swear). Exiting is more of a prob
lem. To ensure that anyone waiting outside
the door doesn't see me, 1 usually swing the
door out really fast in the hopes of distracting
them momentarily by hitting them in the
face, and then quickly walk away with my
head down. If private restrooms allowed ei
ther sex to use them, I wouldn't have to resort
to such violence.
Automation
Urinals — Yes
People pee often enough to make flushing
a hassle, and it's easy to jump out of the way
once the auto-flusher starts. In the event that
the auto-flusher accidentally starts, the re
sultant splash is not fatal.
Toilets — No
One of the worst feelings you can have is
the splash of rushing water across your bare
ass. Automatic flush on toilets is so faulty and
unreliable that it almost always results in
flushing at inappropriate moments. Ban au
tomatic flush on toilets for the sake of dry
asses everywhere.
Sinks — No
I hate automated sinks because they rely
on lasers with ridiculous ranges. The water
doesn't turn on until my hands are no longer
below the faucet, meaning that the only way
to turn the water on is to place your hands
somewhere that's not part of the water's

path.
Paper towel dispensers/hand dryers — Yes
No one wants to touch anything after get
ting their hands clean, especially something
that has probably been touched by people
who didn't use soap.
Garbage Can Location
No one wants to touch the doorknob with
their bare hands, so people always grab an
extra paper towel with which to grip the
doorknob. Unfortunately, most of the time,
there is nowhere to throw the towel after
using it, so restrooms will oftentimes amass
an enormous mound of paper right next to
the door, which is both aesthetically displeas
ing and unsanitary. Placing a garbage can
near the door is a ridiculously easy way to
solve this problem. It doesn't even cost
money, unless your janitor is being paid per
task, in which case you are an idiot.
Women's Restrooms
Women's bathrooms should install fewer
sinks and more stalls. If you think about it,
washing hands takes relatively little time
compared to the time it takes to do your busi
ness. That means in the time it takes one
woman to use a bathroom stall, at least seven
women could wash their hands, getting rid of
those ridiculously long lines that plague
every female on the planet. Of course, this as
sumes that women refrain from treating
bathroom visits as social events, which is not
at all a safe assumption.
Men's Restrooms
Dividers between urinals are a must — no
one wants to see other people's wangs. None

of that long trough-style stuff either. Urinals
should remain strictly separate and have
large plastic dividers between them to ob
struct the view of neighbors. Also, men's rest
rooms should always have more toilets than
urinals. Basically, you can do everything you
need in a toilet, but you can only piss in a uri
nal. Unless you are highly creative.
Toilet Seal Covers
Toilet seat covers should be provided.
Always. This is not debatable on any level,
unless your toilet washes itself after each
use with strong soap and a clean sponge. 1
hear they have those in Japan. I also hear
they sell used panties in vending machines
there.
Stall Size
A stall should be deep enough so that one
can stand in front of the toilet and still have
room to swing the door open without having
to bend backwards. Maybe this is just partic
ular to the restroom in my dorm, but every
time 1 attempt to leave my stall, I basically
have to back up into the toilet, threatening to
pitch me head-first into my own feces.
Toilet Paper Accessibility
Lots of public restrooms have this
strange two-tiered contraption that houses
a backup roll of toilet paper in the top part
but makes it impossible to remove. It's al
most as if they put the extra toilet paper roll
in just to mock the poor souls who sit bare
assed wondering how they will ever get out
of the stall and still be able to respect them
selves. Instead, extra toilet paper rolls
should be either accessible through a slid
ing cover or completely free, sitting on top
of the container.
Plumbing
A toilet plunger in every stall. Just in case.
