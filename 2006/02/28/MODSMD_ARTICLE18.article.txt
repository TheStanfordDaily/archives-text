Intelligent design fails as a science
In his letter ("The myths surrounding intel
ligent design," Feb. 21). THstan Abbey pres
ents a distorted view of the fake science of in
telligent design (ID) in an attempt to dispel
three "myths" about ID.
While criticizing evolution is not equiva
lent to promoting ID, promoting ID consists
almost entirely of attacks on evolution. No
positive evidence is ever given for the origin of
life's features through intelligent design. In
stead, proponents of ID only assert that if evo
lution is insufficient, intelligence must have
played a role. This is because ID, as currently
formulated, isn't scientifically testable. Any

testable model of ID would require some as
sumptions about the designer, such as motive
or ability. Because, for political reasons, advo
cates of ID cannot openly reveal that they
think the designer is God, they cannot make
explicit hypotheses about the designer, and
therefore cannot make predictions about de
sign.
While Abbey may be trivially correct to
claim that ID is not creationism, ID in fact
evolved directly from creationism, and was de
signed specifically to avoid the constitutional
challenges that doomed creation science in the
1980s. Proponents of ID have tried to remove
any overt references to God or religion in their
writings, but have failed to completely cover

their tracks. For example, where the ID text
book "Of Pandas and People" uses the phrase
"intelligent design" throughout the text, earli
er drafts of the book used "creationism" in the
exact same places. Not so coincidently, the
change in phrasing occurred in 1987, the same
year creation science was declared unconstitu
tional by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Contrary to Abbey's claim, advocates of
ID attempted to insert ID into the curriculum
of Ohio high school biology courses a few
years ago. When that seemed likely to fail,
they switched strategies to the more political
ly savvy approach of "teaching the controver
sy", which remains their current position.
Instead of teaching antievolution under the

title "intelligent design", they have removed
the title, but kept the antievolution content
under the pretext that they are teaching the
"strengths" and "weaknesses" of evolutionary
theory. These supposed "weaknesses" of evo
lution consist of distortions, selective omis
sions, and outright lies designed specifically to
sow the seeds of doubt in the minds of young
students and the general public.
Despite the fact that these attacks have
been thoroughly refuted countless times both
within the scientific literature and on the In
ternet. proponents of ID repeat them contin
uously, confident in the knowledge that few
will read these refutations, and fewer still will
understand them.

ID should be rejected as science because it
utterly fails as a science. The religious founda
tions of ID may help explain why its propo
nents. many of whom have advanced degrees,
continue to advocate its teaching, despite its
complete failure to gain any acceptance with
in the mainstream scientific community. It is
entirely possible that a religiously-based theo
ry of origins could be scientific; but ID isn't, re
gardless of its inspiration. The sooner people
realize that accepting evolution doesn't re
quire the abandonment of faith, the sooner we
can put this sad episode behind us.
