## Annual senior pledge is leaderless at Stanford Environmental responsibility pledge was started in 1987 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
This June, seniors at colleges across the
nation will take the Graduation Pledge of
Social and Environmental Responsibility,
vowing to consider environmental and so
cial concerns in their careers and job selec
tion.
Seniors at Stanford, however, may be
left out of the nationwide effort, as difficul
ties have arisen in finding a group to organ
ize the pledge on campus this year.
The pledge was started at Humboldt
State University in 1987 and has since

spread to hundreds of schools across the
nation â€” even to some schools outside the
United States. The pledge reads: "I [name]
pledge to explore and take into account the
social and environmental consequences of
any job I consider and will try to improve
these aspects of any organizations for
which 1 work."
The national pledge effort is now coor
dinated by Manchester College in Indiana
and is headed by Neil Wollman, a professor
of psychology. According to Wollman, the
pledge reached Manchester in 1988 and the
college became the headquarters in the
mid-19905.
"It started informally and eventually be
came institutionalized and a formal part of
commencement." he said. "People wear
green ribbons, the president speaks about it

and it's a part of the ceremony."
According to Wolllman, the pledge was
initially brought to Stanford in the 1980s. It
was abandoned and then started back up
again, but the movement may not happen
this year as no group has stepped up to head
the project.
"No one seems to be taking the leader
ship, which is disappointing," Wollman said.
While Students for a Sustainable Stan
ford (SSS) has coordinated the pledge for
the past few years, the group is not planning
to continue this year. Junior Emma Yuen, a
leader of SSS, said that the group is already
working on other big campaigns and that
the idea was introduced too late this year,
after tasks had already been divided up. She
also noted that the project is usually head
ed by a graduating senior and that there are

few seniors in SSS this year.
"I've tried to get other environmental
groups to pick [the pledge project] up, how
ever, no one has gotten back to me about
it," she said.
In the past,SSS has passed out green rib
bons to those who have taken the pledge
and has decided exactly what the gradua
tion pledge will be. The group also handled
publicity efforts, encouraging people to
sign and contribute to the pledge.
"Stanford has a pretty strong program
and now no one is set to do it," Wollman
said, mentioning a similar problem at Har
vard University.
The pledge Web site stresses its impor
tance, stating, "Not only does it remind
students of the ethical implications
of the knowledge and training they
received, but it can help lead to a so
cially-conscious citizenry and a bet
ter world. The impact is immense
even if only a significant minority of
the one million college graduates
each year sign and live out the
Pledge."
Though it is difficult to know how
many people sign the pledge each
year and how well they live up to it,
the Web site mentions examples of
how the pledge has influenced people
to act in the workplace, citing actions
ranging from promoting recycling to
helping to persuade an employer not
to enter into a contract involving
chemical weapons.
Lauren Dietrich, a graduate stu
dent in construction management in
civil and environmental engineering
who worked with SSS to organize the
pledge a few years ago, talked about
her experience.
"I signed the grad pledge when 1
finished my undergrad degree. And
I'll sign it again when I finish my Mas

ters," she said. "I think there is real
power in signing the grad pledge. It is
a personal vow to consider the social
and environmental implications of
your actions: it is a commitment to
uphold your own personal values and
to work for a healthier, more just
world."
Though it is unlikely that the
pledge will be formally organized at
Stanford this year, some seniors still
expressed interest.
Karl Gumerlock. a senior major
ing in mechanical engineering, said
that though he had not previously
heard of the pledge, he would proba
bly take it.
"It's a no-brainer," he said. "Part
of being a human being is taking into
account any and all consequences of
your actions and weighing them
against the outcome."
Dietrich was optimistic about the
potential power of the pledge.
"There are great jobs out there
and if bright graduates hold out for
work that is aligned with their ethics,
more such jobs will be created," she
said. "Young graduates can wield
their power as aspiring future leaders
and guide employers to change job
responsibilities and priorities, or we
can start new businesses on our own.
The job market will respond."
