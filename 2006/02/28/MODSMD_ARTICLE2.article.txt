## Projects aim to raise awareness of sleep "Sleep and Dreams" focuses on sleep debt 
### MELANIE CORBETT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sleep deprivation at Stanford
comes as no surprise. Recently, howev
er, students across campus have made
concerted efforts to raise awareness of
its dangers. Over the past week, the
roughly 725 students in sleep expert
Dr. William Dement's popular psychi
atry course "Sleep and Dreams" have
conducted sleep-related outreach
projects for the campus and broader
community.

Informational presentations,
videos, brochures and newspaper arti
cles have proliferated as students dis
seminate vital facts about the mental
and physical effects of sleep depriva
tion. The information is provided free
of charge and presented in accessible
and even entertaining forms of com
munication.
The Central Role of Sleep Debt
Juniors Megan Green and Lindsay
Garlock explored the critical concept
of "sleep debt" in a radio presentation
on, Feb. 3 during Green's weekly show
on Stanford's KZSU station.
The two said they focused on sleep debt because of
its perceived relevance to the student body.
"We thought that topic would be the most helpful
for most of the people listening," Garlock said.
Awareness of sleep debt is crucial to understand
ing the relationship between sleep and personal well
being. Sleep debt is the cumulative sum of daily hours
of sleep received that are below the mean daily
amount needed. Eight hours a night is the average re
quirement.
Sleep debt's fundamental principle states that all
lost sleep accumulates as a debt and does not simply
dissipate. Consequently, only additional sleep can re
duce one's sleep debt.
"Contrary to popular belief, receiving eight hours
of sleep one night does not adequately compensate
for an entire week's worth of insufficient sleep,"
Green said.
The radio show included a discussion of the "sleep
homeostat" that directs the tendency to fall asleep and
to stay asleep. The homeostat is active 24 hours a day
and takes into account each individual's amount of
wake time and sleep time.
The sleep homeostat drives the effects of sleep
deprivation. Because most people have a significant
sleep debt — Sleep and Dreams course statistics esti
mate that 95 to 100 percent of Stanford undergradu
ates do not receive enough sleep — they have an in
tense homeostatic drive to sleep while awake.
"Sleep homeostasis explains the need for a re
bound of sleep after a period of severe sleep depriva
tion," Garlock said, noting that the process is self-reg
ulatory.
Sleep deprivation's negative effects extend beyond
unpleasant fatigue and in some instances can lead to
death. Sleep and Dreams course statistics hold that 87
percent of motor vehicle accidents that occur as a re
sult of falling asleep at the wheel are fatal. Significant
sleep debt produces a vulnerability to inattention and
microsleeps that can lead to such deadly accidents on
the road.
Even more disturbing, driving with a large sleep
debt can reduce one's coherence level to that of a
drunk driver. A person awake for 24 consecutive
hours has a degree of performance impairment equal
to a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .10. Fur
ther, receiving four hours of sleep a night for six nights
in a row leads to driving performance that is consid
ered to be worse than that of drunk driver's.
Sleep Debt's Toll on Mental Health
For his outreach project, junior Chris Denton cre
ated and presented a video for his outreach project
demonstrating sleep debt's harmful effects on mental
health.The video conveys the story of a male student
who values an activity (playing video games) more
than sleep.
The student's sleep debt ultimately hurts not only
his video game skills but also his relationship with his
girlfriend and his school work. After a sleep doctor
identifies the student's tremendous sleep debt, the
student works to reduce his sleep debt and soon sees
his quality of life vastly improve.
The video highlights the destructive consequences
of sleep debt that can result both from controllable ac
tions like prioritizing activities over sleep as well as
from uncontrollable sleep disorders.
"We explain some symptoms of narcolepsy, which
is a relatively common sleep disorder," Denton said,
referring to the video scenes in which the character
undergoes sleep disorder tests.
Narcolepsy can be characterized by excessive
sleepiness, sleep "attacks," cataplexy and disturbed
nocturnal sleep. Obstructive sleep apnea, another se
rious sleep disorder, causes loud snoring and blocked
air flow through the windpipe.
Recognition, the First Step Toward a Solution
The inability of sleep debt to dissipate coupled
with its self-destructive and potentially fatal effects
point to the indispensable nature of sleep. While in
creasing the average hours of daily sleep that Stanford
students receive may take substantial time, the height
ened awareness of Sleep and Dreams students and
their outreach project participants is a first step to
ward promoting improvement.
