Sleep deprivation at Stanford
comes as no surprise. Recently, howev
er, students across campus have made
concerted efforts to raise awareness of
its dangers. Over the past week, the
roughly 725 students in sleep expert
Dr. William Dement's popular psychi
atry course "Sleep and Dreams" have
conducted sleep-related outreach
projects for the campus and broader
community.

Informational presentations,
videos, brochures and newspaper arti
cles have proliferated as students dis
seminate vital facts about the mental
and physical effects of sleep depriva
tion. The information is provided free
of charge and presented in accessible
and even entertaining forms of com
munication.
