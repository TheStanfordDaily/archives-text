The Daily misparaphrased Stan
ford Review Editor-in-Chief Emeri
tus Ben Guthrie in the front page ar
ticle "Review threatens legal ac
tion" on Feb. 24. The article said,
"Before the fall of 2003. he said The
Review had no problems with deliv
ering its publication to every room
in dorms, a distribution method
practiced regularly by The Review."
Guthrie did not say that The Re
view had no problems distributing
door-to-door whatsoever prior to
2003. On the contrary, he said that
The Review had at least two docu
mented distribution conflicts — one
in 1998 in Arroyo and Okada. and

another in 1994 in Casa Zapata.
He also indicated that he was
personally unaware of any problems
during the entire 2002-03 academic
year — the same year he was a regu
lar door-to-door distributor for The
Stanford Review.
As Distribution Manager for The
Review during the first half of the
2003-04 academic year, he attests to
the fact that The Review had no
problems distributing its first issue
door-to-door across campus. The
complaints and enforcements of
bans on door-to-door distribution
began after the second issue (which
contained the controversial
MEChA articles), published and
distributed door-to-door on Oct. 15,
2003.
