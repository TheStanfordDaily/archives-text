## TRACK AND FIELD Women claim league title School records are set, men's team takes second at Mountain Pacific Sports Federation championship 
### ISRAEL ROJAS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's track and field team is getting used to this
— after capturing the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation champi
onship this past weekend in Seattle, Wash., the Cardinal returned
home the owners of their fourth-straight league title.
At the beginning of Saturday's events, the women trailed Arizona
State by 32 points. But the team didn't seem worried as they steam
rolled through the day, collecting 161 points en route to a 46-point
win over the second-place Sun Devils. Various athletes stepped up
during the event, each one inspiring the next as they created the 78-
point swing.
"We came together as a team to support one another and each
person's success in her event was motivation for the next person in
her own event," redshirt sophomore Chauntae Bayne said.
Another four-year streak that was achieved was victory in the
3,(KX) meters, where junior Arianna Lambie claimed her second vic
tory of the meet. Earlier in the day, Lambie had successfully defend
ed her MPSF title in the mile by leading the women to a 1-2-3 finish.
Sophomore Erica McLain successfully defended her long and
triple jump titles to become Stanford's other two-event winner.
McLain had not competed in the long jump all season, while her dis
tance in the triple this weekend hit the NCAA automatic qualifying
mark.
Bayne almost continued her own record-breaking streak as she
won the 60 meters with the second-fastest time in school history.
Later, junior Janice Davis mirrored that result as she won the 2(X) me
ters in the second-fastest school time.
Coincidentally, Davis owns the
60-meter school record, while Bayne
is the owner of the 200-meter record.
Both Davis and Bayne then worked
together to win the mile relay, with
sophomore Keisha Gaines and sen
ior Nashonme Johnson running the
other two legs.
The women weren't alone in their
success, as the men's team also had
strong performances and finished
seven points away from the title,
which was won by the University of
Washington.
"It was very fun returning to team
competition, and we finished in a
very competitive second," senior
Solomon Welch said. "We have some
very exciting performances to look
forward to at NCAA indoor nation
als."
The men were paced by victories
from redshirt sophomore Russell

Brown in the mile and junior Jacob
Gomez in the 3,(KK) meters. The men
also achieved a 1-2-3 finish in the
3,000-meter race.
Both the men and the women's
team came away with titles in the dis
tance medley relay. Juniors Amanda
Trotter. Ashley Freeman, Lambie
and sophomore Katy Trotter ran for
the women, and Brown, junior
Joaquin Chapa, redshirt sophomore
Michael Garcia and redshirt fresh
man Garret Heath competed for the
men. Both teams reached the NCAA
provisional mark.
Sophomore Anna McFarlane set
a new school record in the pole vault
event, while freshman Lauren Stew
art and junior Josh Hustedt also post
ed school records in the pentathlon
and heptathlon events, respectively.
Coming up this weekend is the
Stanford Open, the team's first home
meet of the season. The Indoor
Championships take place in Fayet
teville. Ark. in two weeks,so this invi
tational will be the last chance for
many athletes to make the qualifying
list.
