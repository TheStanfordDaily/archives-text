## TRACK AND FIELD Women claim league title School records are set, men's team takes second at Mountain Pacific Sports Federation championship 
### ISRAEL ROJAS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's track and field team is getting used to this
â€” after capturing the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation champi
onship this past weekend in Seattle, Wash., the Cardinal returned
home the owners of their fourth-straight league title.
At the beginning of Saturday's events, the women trailed Arizona
State by 32 points. But the team didn't seem worried as they steam
rolled through the day, collecting 161 points en route to a 46-point
win over the second-place Sun Devils. Various athletes stepped up
during the event, each one inspiring the next as they created the 78-
point swing.
"We came together as a team to support one another and each
person's success in her event was motivation for the next person in
her own event," redshirt sophomore Chauntae Bayne said.
Another four-year streak that was achieved was victory in the
3,(KX) meters, where junior Arianna Lambie claimed her second vic
tory of the meet. Earlier in the day, Lambie had successfully defend
ed her MPSF title in the mile by leading the women to a 1-2-3 finish.
Sophomore Erica McLain successfully defended her long and
triple jump titles to become Stanford's other two-event winner.
McLain had not competed in the long jump all season, while her dis
tance in the triple this weekend hit the NCAA automatic qualifying
mark.
Bayne almost continued her own record-breaking streak as she
won the 60 meters with the second-fastest time in school history.
Later, junior Janice Davis mirrored that result as she won the 2(X) me
ters in the second-fastest school time.
