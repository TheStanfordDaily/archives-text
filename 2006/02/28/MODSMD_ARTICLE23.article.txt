## Card vault over Husky squad Seniors bid farewell to Burnham Pavilion in the last home meet of their collegiate careers 
### JUSTINA KAMIEL GRAYMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Three Stanford gymnasts now know what it is like to say goodbye for
ever to their memory-filled home arena. At Burnham Pavilion Friday
night against Washington, seniors Natalie Foley, (ilyn Sweets and Jessica
Louie experienced a goodbye to remember.
No. 12 Stanford scored over 49.(XX) in three of its four events and de
cisively crushed No. 37 Washington bv a margin of almost seven points,
196.375 to 189.6(X).
"We [didn't have any seniors on the team last year], so we've never
had to say goodbye," sophomore Tabitha Yim said. "1 really hate to say
goodbye. You can never replace a Glyn Sweets or Jessica Louie or Natal
ie Foley."
Yim praised the credentials of the team veterans, but the sophomore
has already proven herself ready to follow in the steps of the talented sen
ior crew. She gracefully won the bars with a 9.925 while Foley, whose
Shushunova wowed the crowd, took second. I luge falls and miniscule fal
ters by the Husky squad rendered the Washington team powerless to
rival Stanford, whose performance inspired a feverish energy in the
crowd.
Head coach Kristen Smyth highlighted Foley,who in 2(X)4 became the
first Stanford gymnast to be named the Pac-10 All-Around Champion,
when speaking of the night's events.
"It's looking like this will be her finest year yet," she said."She's doing
an outstanding job leading the team."
Bars is where the I luskies were effectively eliminated from competi
tion. The Washington squad scored a heart-wrenching 46.075 in the
event, while Stanford notched a 49.275, its highest score in any event.
Freshmen Kelly Fee, whose small stature conceals her tremendous
power, and Nicole Ourada, who performed a reverse hecht and earned
an enthusiastic ovation from the crowd with a stuck landing.shared third.
Vault was a very solid event for the Cardinal, despite slight slip-ups
early in the lineup. Sophomore Alex Pintchouk and Yim, last in the vault
lineup, tied to win the event (9.925), achieved career-bests and started the
team off with spectacular scores in the next rotation. Foley was third
and sophomore Stephanie Gentry, previously out from knee injury,
debuted on the event.
Foley earned her second event title (9.9) on beam, where she per
formed a difficult layout-layout sequence. Ourada and Fee tied for
second, while Yim and Washington's Kelly McDonald shared third.
"Beam was my most emotional event because 1 knew it was my
last event here," said Sweets, who performed with a unique artistry.
Holding a wide six-point lead, the Stanford team ended its night
fiercely and gracefully on floor. The crowd clapped along with the
upbeat routines,such as that of the animated Fee.The lagging Wash
ington team trailed haplessly, and the crowd simply gasped at the fre
quent falls of Jessica Brown, who scored a 7.8. Ourada. whose full-in
was a soaring spectacle, won the tloor-exercise title with a 9.9.
Pintchouk and Fee were second and third.
"My favorite event was Louie's floor routine because she's been
working so hard," Sweets said.
Foley ended her stunning night by garnering the all-around title
(39.325). Ourada was second with a career-best 39.3, and the
Huskies' Omori was third.
"We were able to come together as a team," Ourada said. "It was
incredible, being able to have the crowd behind us. It wasn't like
competing at any away meets, or even at Maples."
This Friday the Cardinal compete against No. 44 Cal State Fuller
ton.a team with no outstanding all-arounders in comparison to Stan
ford's.
Smyth commented on the phase that her team has entered, con
centrating less on conditioning and more on points.
"We're in our quantity phase." said Smyth. "We're trying to beef
up our numbers."
Stanford will have more of a challenge facing the talented No. 8
UCLA squad this Sunday. The Bruins have depth galore, with five
gymnasts scoring above 39 in the all-around. But the Bruins' have
not outscored Stanford as a team, as their high of 196.675 falls just
short of the Cardinal's 196.875.
"I think these two weeks will really test our team this late in the
season when we are reaching our best," Smyth said.
As a former Pac-10 Gymnast of the Week, UCLA's Jordan
Shwikert will be formidable, and Kristina Comforte has performed
a 10.0 on vault this season.
Kate Richardson, a Canadian Olympian, is an all-around power
house and the 2(X)3 NCAA balance beam champion. She is current
ly ranked second nationally in the all-around.
New adds will surely make an impact on the success of the meet.
Sophomore Liz'lVicase will come back to compete after resting her
hip on Friday's meet, and Ourada will compete a difficult full-in bars
dismount.
Stanford certainly plans to increase the already-high levels of dif
ficulty in its routines in the coming weeks, preparing for success in
following meets.
"If we just keep working hard, hopefully we'll win every single
one," Yim said.

"We're in our quantity phase." said Smyth. "We're trying to beef
up our numbers."
Stanford will have more of a challenge facing the talented No. 8
UCLA squad this Sunday. The Bruins have depth galore, with five
gymnasts scoring above 39 in the all-around. But the Bruins' have
not outscored Stanford as a team, as their high of 196.675 falls just
short of the Cardinal's 196.875.
"I think these two weeks will really test our team this late in the
season when we are reaching our best," Smyth said.
As a former Pac-10 Gymnast of the Week, UCLA's Jordan
Shwikert will be formidable, and Kristina Comforte has performed
a 10.0 on vault this season.
Kate Richardson, a Canadian Olympian, is an all-around power
house and the 2(X)3 NCAA balance beam champion. She is current
ly ranked second nationally in the all-around.
New adds will surely make an impact on the success of the meet.
Sophomore Liz'lVicase will come back to compete after resting her
hip on Friday's meet, and Ourada will compete a difficult full-in bars
dismount.
Stanford certainly plans to increase the already-high levels of dif
ficulty in its routines in the coming weeks, preparing for success in
following meets.
"If we just keep working hard, hopefully we'll win every single
one," Yim said.

Kelly Fee shared third place with fellow freshman Nicole Ourada on bars in a Stanford sweep of the event. The No. 12 Cardinal soundly beat the Washington Huskies,
1 96.375 - 189.600, in the last home meet of the season. The team travels to Cal State Fullerton on Friday, then faces No. 8 UCLA on Sunday.
Three Stanford gymnasts now know what it is like to say goodbye for
ever to their memory-filled home arena. At Burnham Pavilion Friday
night against Washington, seniors Natalie Foley, (ilyn Sweets and Jessica
Louie experienced a goodbye to remember.
No. 12 Stanford scored over 49.(XX) in three of its four events and de
cisively crushed No. 37 Washington bv a margin of almost seven points,
196.375 to 189.6(X).
"We [didn't have any seniors on the team last year], so we've never
had to say goodbye," sophomore Tabitha Yim said. "1 really hate to say
goodbye. You can never replace a Glyn Sweets or Jessica Louie or Natal
ie Foley."
Yim praised the credentials of the team veterans, but the sophomore
has already proven herself ready to follow in the steps of the talented sen
ior crew. She gracefully won the bars with a 9.925 while Foley, whose
Shushunova wowed the crowd, took second. I luge falls and miniscule fal
ters by the Husky squad rendered the Washington team powerless to
rival Stanford, whose performance inspired a feverish energy in the
crowd.
Head coach Kristen Smyth highlighted Foley,who in 2(X)4 became the
first Stanford gymnast to be named the Pac-10 All-Around Champion,
when speaking of the night's events.
"It's looking like this will be her finest year yet," she said."She's doing
an outstanding job leading the team."
Bars is where the I luskies were effectively eliminated from competi
tion. The Washington squad scored a heart-wrenching 46.075 in the
event, while Stanford notched a 49.275, its highest score in any event.
Freshmen Kelly Fee, whose small stature conceals her tremendous
power, and Nicole Ourada, who performed a reverse hecht and earned
an enthusiastic ovation from the crowd with a stuck landing.shared third.
Vault was a very solid event for the Cardinal, despite slight slip-ups
early in the lineup. Sophomore Alex Pintchouk and Yim, last in the vault
lineup, tied to win the event (9.925), achieved career-bests and started the
team off with spectacular scores in the next rotation. Foley was third
and sophomore Stephanie Gentry, previously out from knee injury,
debuted on the event.
Foley earned her second event title (9.9) on beam, where she per
formed a difficult layout-layout sequence. Ourada and Fee tied for
second, while Yim and Washington's Kelly McDonald shared third.
"Beam was my most emotional event because 1 knew it was my
last event here," said Sweets, who performed with a unique artistry.
Holding a wide six-point lead, the Stanford team ended its night
fiercely and gracefully on floor. The crowd clapped along with the
upbeat routines,such as that of the animated Fee.The lagging Wash
ington team trailed haplessly, and the crowd simply gasped at the fre
quent falls of Jessica Brown, who scored a 7.8. Ourada. whose full-in
was a soaring spectacle, won the tloor-exercise title with a 9.9.
Pintchouk and Fee were second and third.
"My favorite event was Louie's floor routine because she's been
working so hard," Sweets said.
Foley ended her stunning night by garnering the all-around title
(39.325). Ourada was second with a career-best 39.3, and the
Huskies' Omori was third.
"We were able to come together as a team," Ourada said. "It was
incredible, being able to have the crowd behind us. It wasn't like
competing at any away meets, or even at Maples."
This Friday the Cardinal compete against No. 44 Cal State Fuller
ton.a team with no outstanding all-arounders in comparison to Stan
ford's.
Smyth commented on the phase that her team has entered, con
centrating less on conditioning and more on points.
"We're in our quantity phase." said Smyth. "We're trying to beef
up our numbers."
