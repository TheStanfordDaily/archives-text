Three Stanford gymnasts now know what it is like to say goodbye for
ever to their memory-filled home arena. At Burnham Pavilion Friday
night against Washington, seniors Natalie Foley, (ilyn Sweets and Jessica
Louie experienced a goodbye to remember.
No. 12 Stanford scored over 49.(XX) in three of its four events and de

event, while Stanford notched a 49.275, its highest score in any event.
Freshmen Kelly Fee, whose small stature conceals her tremendous
power, and Nicole Ourada, who performed a reverse hecht and earned
an enthusiastic ovation from the crowd with a stuck landing.shared third.
Vault was a very solid event for the Cardinal, despite slight slip-ups
early in the lineup. Sophomore Alex Pintchouk and Yim, last in the vault
lineup, tied to win the event (9.925), achieved career-bests and started the
