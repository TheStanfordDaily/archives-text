The Daily continues its "Through My
Eyes" series on the women's tennis team with
sophomore Whitney Deason.

Sorry 1 can't give you funny anecdotes like
Theresa [Logar] did ("A presence on and off
the court," Feb. 14). I'm going to bring it down
a notch...
I don't want to be like, "I'm responsible."
but I guess 1 consider myself to be fairly ma
ture. I'm also fairly easygoing. For people who
don't know me super-well, I probably appear
on the surface to be even-keeled. But once I
get more comfortable with people and get to
know them better, it's a lot easier to crack
jokes. It might surprise people to think of me
like that. It's also very easy to joke around
with our team because everyone just kind of
feeds off of each other. We have a lot of, uh,
characters who incite things like that.
Common goals and backgrounds
Everyone plays an important role in their
own way on the team. One thing that's neat to
me is that the team has such a diverse range of
different personalities, but we all seem to

Sophomore Whitney Deason is looked up to by all her teammates for her calm in high-pressure situations and her
dependability. Even the seniors admire her maturity, but Deason has a mischievous side as well.
mesh those so well together. Part of
that is we all have a common goal
— we want to be number one in the
country. But there are never any in
stances of it being about one per
son. It's always about the team.
Everyone looks out for everyone
else and has a good head on her
shoulders.
I think what also really helps our
team's closeness is that through jun
iors, we all pretty much grew up
knowing everybody else on the
team. You've seen them at tourna
ments, played against them, prac
ticed with them. Some people you
knew better than others, but it just
makes it a lot easier to get more
comfortable quickly.
Settling in
You come in as a freshman and
you're hesitant to really put your
self out there until you get a feel for
what everybody's like and what
they think. But I definitely think
that this year's newbies have really
strong personalities. Especially to
ward the end of fall quarter, they all
started to come into their own.
I think the trip to Hawaii that we
take at Thanksgiving is when you
first get to really see that. We're all
together for about a week, which is
a really good experience for us as
far as team bonding. We have a
match against Hawaii, we teach
clinics in the morning — and then
we go to the beach and stuff.
Halfway through the year now,
everyone feels a lot more comfort
able with everybody else.
Team bonding traditions
The team plays its own version
of Family Feud at the beginning of
fall quarter every year, two or
three weeks into school. It's inter

esting to see what the freshmen
think of the team without really
knowing us all that well. The sen
iors come up with about 20 cate
gories of things like "If you were
stuck on a deserted island, who on
the team would you want to have
with you?" and "Who do you think
is going to get married first" and
"Who would be the best mother?"
We split the newbies up into
three teams, with one newbie per
group of upperclassmen. Then we
have the freshmen try to guess
which upperclassman their older
teammates voted as their selection
for each of these questions. I was
the most likely to be in bed at 10
p.m. on a Friday. 1 even wrote my
self in for that one.
We have this annual potluck
Holiday Dinner every year, too. It's
really fun to taste everyone's dishes.
I'd say Lejla [Hodzic]'s potatoes
went over pretty well, and of course
the cupcakes are always a hit.
We do a lot of stuff off the cuff as
a team, too. Everybody gets along
so well that spending too much time
together is not a problem.
Looking ahead to stepping up
It's going to be really different
next year with the seniors gone, be
cause the four of them make up al
most half the team.They all bring so
much and are such strong leaders
that it will definitely be an interest
ing adjustment. But having been on
the team with them for two years,
I've really learned from them. We
all have. And with that, I think we'll
be able to take some of their leader
ship skills and put them into effect
next year.
On the court too, everyone's
going to have to step up and take a
position they haven't necessarily
been in the past, because Amber
[Liu] plays one and Alice [Barnes]
plays two. It will be a challenge, but
I think that everyone on our team
has grown up knowing how to work
hard and fight.
