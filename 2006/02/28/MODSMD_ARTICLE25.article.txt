### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
Stanford opened its Pac-10 season this
weekend with a pair of 7-0 sweeps against
Washington State and Washington. The top
ranked Cardinal (11-0,2-0 Pac-10) have now
shut out nine of their 11 opponents this year.
The Card doubles teams were dominant
during both matches. Against the Cougars (4-
5,0-2) on Friday, the top-ranked team of sen
ior Alice Barnes and junior Anne Yelsey won
8-0 at the No. 1 doubles position while senior

Amber Liu and sophomore Celia Durkin
won 8-1 at the No. 2 spot. A new doubles
combination of sophomore Lejla Hodzic and
freshman Jessica Nguyen competed at the
No. 3 doubles spot, and won 8-3.
"We got to look at Lejla and Jess as a dou
bles team this weekend and we were really
pleased," head coach Lele Forood said.
"We'll be giving them more of a chance as a
team in the future."
Against the No. 39 Huskies (1-5, 0-2) on
Saturday, Barnes and Yelsey beat the ITA

toria Brymer, 8-1. Hodzic and Nguyen also
won 8-1, while Liu and Durkin won 8-2.
In singles action against Washington
State, Deason played the only three-set

match of the weekend. After dropping her
first set to Alexsandra Cekic, 0-6, she
bounced hack with a 6-3 second set and a 1-0
(10) 10-point tiebreaker.
Against Washington, Stanford made a
similarly strong singles showing. Durkin
started things off with a 6-0, 6-1 drubbing of
Monika Kobovic at the No. 6 position. Yelsey
finished her sets 6-1, 6-1 against Stephanie
Svanfeldt at the No. 4 spot, then Barnes
clinched the dual match on the second court
with a 6-1,6-0 victory over Victoria Brymer.
"We played pretty solidly this weekend,
especially against Washington," Liu
said."Everyone played smart and efficiently
— we were off the court pretty quickly.These
wins were important for us to keep the mo

mentum going into the rest of the season."
Forood said this past weekend was good
for the team because eight players, rather
than six, got the chance to compete.
"It was nice to get so many people into the
matches," she said. "1 think we're going to get
a lot of people in to play in the coming
weeks."
After three February weekends spent on
the road, the team is looking forward to this
weekend's home matches. ITie Cardinal host
Arizona State on Friday at 1:30 p.m. and Ari

"The Arizona schools are always tough
and play with a lot of energy," Deason said.
"But we are all looking forward to playing at
home."
