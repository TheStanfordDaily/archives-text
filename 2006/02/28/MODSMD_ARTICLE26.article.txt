# A 						Pond fit for the Kings

### 
You can never have too many
sports teams. Or so I thought.
Despite being inherently su
perior to its northern brother, south
ern California is plagued by a surplus
of professional athletic organizations.
Fans from San Diego to Los Ange
les own the rare privilege of choosing
from a plethora of teams — Dodgers,
Angels or Padres? Kings or Ducks?
Galaxy or Chivas USA? Lakers or
Clippers? And even while the NFL
remains defunct in the City of Angels,
football continues to divide Angelino
families twixt the UCLA and South
ern California loyalties.
Meanwhile, the city of Anaheim,
after forever ruining the Angels'
name, thinks this oversaturated mar
ket can afford yet another profes
sional team. The Arrowhead Pond,
current home to the Mighty Ducks of
Anaheim, was built in 1993 with
every intention of one day housing an
NBA team.
According to recent reports —
and owners Joe and Gavin Maloof —
the Sacramento Kings could be the
team to capitalize on the city's "des
perate need" for a professional bas
ketball team. A potential move
would come about because Sacra
mento is hesitant to build a new arena
with public funds, even with Arco
Arena requiring more refurbish
ments than Stanford Stadium.
So the question is whether or not
southern California can handle an
other professional franchise. With
both the Lakers and the Clippers al
ready battling for Southland domi
nance, it's hard to see another squad
offering viable competition.
But the Kings could easily find
success through the move by avoid
ing the same mistake of the Clippers.
Los Angeles' "forgotten team."
From 1994 t*> 1998, the Clippers
played occasional games at the Ar
rowhead Pond while calling the Los
Angeles Sports Arena its primary
home. Pond owners would have
loved to house the Clippers full-time,
and even made several lucrative of
fers to strike a deal.
Clippers owner and Hollywood
aficionado Donald Sterling, however,
would see his team play in my down
town high school's gym before com
pletely moving his pride and joy to
Orange County. Dazzled by the glitz
and glamour of the big city. Sterling
instead agreed to relocate his squad
to the then newly-built Staples Cen
ter, an arena furnished with purple
seats and seven retired numbers to go
along with six championship banners
— all of which belonging to Lakers.
Indeed, the saying is true: The
Lakers play in the Staples Center
while the Clippers just rent it out.
The Pond, however, provides
many more benefits than a mere
proximity to the "Happiest Place on
Earth." By calling the venue home, a
team would enjoy a market ranging
from Orange County to San Diego.
For some strange reason. Orange
County fans don't appreciate being
identified with Los Angeles. From
Fullerton to Irvine,sports enthusiasts
are empowered by seeing their teams
identified with Anaheim (even if the
baseball team's name is scattered
amongst several other words in the
nation's longest pro team title).
Additionally, while the typical San
Diego fan may not particularly iden
tify with the Lakers or be willing to
drive more than two hours to down
town Los Angeles, he or she might
gladly make the hour-long drive to
Anaheim.
The Clippers could have avoided
being Los Angeles' second-tier team
by focusing their interests on the Or
ange County-San Diego area — a
market still unexplored by the NBA.
An entirely different core of fans —
the same ones that sell out Angels
Stadium every night — would have
made the Clippers their own, but now
it seems the Maloofs will be the ones
to reap the benefits.
So if the city of Sacramento —
long described as housing the NBA's
greatest fans — doesn't appreciate
the team enough to provide a new
arena, there are tons of people down
south who would love to shell out
millions to support another team.
Besides, what kind of professional
franchise would want to stay in north
ern California — a region belea
guered with fair-weather Giants and
Warriors fans — anyway?
