## Second-place invitational finish for Cardinal Team avenges last season's 0-4 record against UCLA with a win 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
It's been a long time since the members of the
women's water polo team last enjoyed a victory
over conference rival UCLA.The Cardinal lost all
four of their contests against the Bruins last sea
son, including the penultimate NCAA title match.
The final loss came in particularly crushing fash
ion. as the Stanford women held their own against
the powerful UCLA squad and fell in narrow de
feat by a 3-2 final.
Hie No. 3 Cardinal (9-2,3-0 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) finally avenged that loss this
weekend at the 2(X)6 Gaucho Invitational in Santa
Barbara. Calif. Squaring off against defending na
tional champion UCLA in the semifinal round of
the tournament, the Cardinal produced the best
game of their season, toppling the No. 2 Bruins by
a score of 4-2. Although they ultimately lost to
top-ranked Southern California in the Invitation
al's first-place game, the Stanford women re
turned home energized and confident in their
ability to stack up against the best teams in the
league and win.
"We have great players and the potential to be
an amazing team," senior captain Scotti Shafer

said. "A win this weekend against a team like
UCLA helped bring this to our attention, espe
cially for our younger players."
After cruising to a pair of victories on Saturday
over No. 15 UC-San Diego and No. 6 California by
scores of 11-4 and 8-3. respectively, the Cardinal
were set to take on the Bruins for the first time
since last May's NCAA tournament.
In every aspect of their game, the Cardinal re
sponded to the challenge. After both teams tallied
one goal apiece in the opening period, the Stan
ford women took control. They netted a pair of
goals in the second period while effectively shut
ting down the UCLA attack, resulting in a 3-1 lead
when the clock expired on the first half of play.
The two-goal deficit put the UCLA squad in an
unfamiliar situation â€” not since their loss in the
2(X)4 MPSF conference tournament semifinals
had the Bruins gone into halftinie trailing by more
than one goal. Coincidentally, the Bruins had been
playing Stanford in that semifinal match and ulti
mately fell to the Cardinal. 3-2.
In similar style, the Stanford squad made their
halftime lead stand up this weekend. UCLA
clawed back to within one with the only goal of the
third period, but that was as close as the Bruins
would get.The Cardinal played lights-out defense
in the final period, especially against a six-on-five
advantage, and picked up an insurance goal to
preserve the 4-2 victory.
In fact, it was the respective play of the two

teams during man-down situations that proved to
be the deciding factor of the game.
"'All week going into the Santa Barbara tour
nament we concentrated on playing (well in] six
on-five and five-on-six [situations] " Shafer said.
"In the UCLA game, all four of our goals came
from our six-on-five. We did a great job shutting
them down on theirs, and they didn't score a single
one [with the man-up advantage]."
Freshman driver Lolo Silver, who currently
leads the team in scoring, notched two goals in the
win. and junior driver Katie Hansen and junior
two-meter Christina Hewko both netted one
apiece. But the Cardinal's play in the defensive
end of the pool was of equal, if not greater, signif
icance to the Stanford victory.
"We did a great job communicating and play
ing team defense," Shafer said. "We were playing
together and helping each other out. This was a
crucial win for our team because it gave us a lot of
confidence. We have definitely improved our
game since the Stanford Invitational, and we are
finally playing with an attitude, which is good to
see."
The Cardinal were unable to repeat their upset
performance later that same afternoon against the
Women of Troy. Despite jumping out to an early 3-
0 lead, the Stanford women were unable to con
tain the powerful USC offense. The game was tied
