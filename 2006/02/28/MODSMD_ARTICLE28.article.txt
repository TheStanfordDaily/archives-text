# MEN'S GYMNASTICS
## Late collapse leaves Cardinal with second Team nearly overtakes top-ranked Oklahoma 
### ANDREA AYALA 
Seven of the top 10 men's gym
nastics teams in the country battled it
out for top honors on Saturday at the
Aquafina Pacific Coast Classic. Six
events ran simultaneously as top
ranked Oklahoma, No. 3 Stanford,
No. 6 Michigan and several other tal
ented squads provided a great show
for a crowd of more than 3,(MX) spec
tators. Unfortunately for the Card, a
late collapse in their vault routines
left them just short of Oklahoma, the
meet's winner.
The Cardinal, currently ranked
No. 1 in the country on vault, seemed
a sure bet to win the meet entering
the vault ahead by .375. But the
young team let the lead slip away
with a series of botched landings,
scoring just a 35.4. Oklahoma posted
several good scores on floor and
pulled ahead of the Cardinal to win
by more than a whole point, 217.3 to
Stanford's 216.075. California took
third with a 212.65. followed by
Michigan (208.6), lowa (207.2), Min
nesota (206.575) and William and
Mary (200.2).
Oklahoma and Stanford quickly
separated themselves from the pack
at the meet's start. Stanford began on
parallel bars and hit six for six, as
sophomores Jason Shen and David
Sender posted season highs of 9.25
and 9.2. respectively.
On horizontal bars, sophomore

Sho Nakamori started the Cardinal
off with a solid 9.2 routine. Sender
posted a 9.35, while junior Dylan
Carney earned a season-high 9.65
with an excellent routine and a stuck
dismount. Senior Nate Downs had a
solid rhythm going, hut he put his
hands down on the landing and came
away with just a 9.25.
After two events, the Cardinal
were ahead of the Sooners, hut by
just .025. Floor started a bit roughly
for the Cardinal, as sophomore Eli
Alcaraz and junior Brice Rolston
missed. But both Nakamori and Car
ney had solid performances, and al
though Sender and senior Sean
Doolan had no major breaks in their
routines, they had to fight through
and did not score particularly well.
Nevertheless, the Cardinal managed
to pull ahead of the Sooners by eight
tenths of a point on the strength of
some tight scoring against the Soon
ers on vault.
On pommel horse, though, Stan
ford had a poor showing. The Cardi
nal hit only three of six routines â€”
those of freshman Bryant Hadden
(8.50), Downs (8.55) and Sender
(8.65). Nakamori found himself in
the lineup for the first time this year,
and despite having a solid set going,
he ultimately fell on the dismount.
Oklahoma's authoritative parallel
bar effort allowed them to pull ahead
of the Cardinal by .075.
The ring team went four for six
due to uncharacteristic misses by
Shen and Hadden. Although juniors
Peter Derman and Alex Schorsch
