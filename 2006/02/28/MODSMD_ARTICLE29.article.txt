# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## SoCal teams are too much 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
There are only four weeks left in
the season, hut something is still miss
ing for the men's volleyball team.
They played well in spurts this week
end but came up short, losing to No.
13 Southern California in three
straight games and to No. 3 Pepper
dine in four.
"We have definitely shown im
provement in some areas," senior op
posite Ben Reddy said. "But things
are still not coming together like they
should."
At times this weekend, particular
ly the last two games against Pepper
dine (10-3, 10-3 MPSF) the Cardinal
(4-14, 2-10) showed their physical
and mental toughness. Sophomore
outside hitter Jesse Meredith
slammed into the scorer's table to
keep the ball alive and several of his
teammates chased balls down into
the far corners of Burnham Pavilion.
But the Cardinal could not main
tain that intensity and were doomed
by slow starts and long runs by their
opponents.
Against USC (8-9,5-7) on Friday
night, the Cardinal got off to a slow
start and were unable to bounce
back. The Trojans hit nearly flawless
ly in the first game, recording only a
single hitting error and 16 kills. Stan
ford had as many kills but eight more
hitting errors as it lost the game by
eight, 30-22.
After a tie early in game two.Stan
ford's hitting percentage slipped
slightly, from .189 to .107 while the
Trojans improved their offense, hit
ting .500 in the game. The Cardinal
had no answer for USC's firepower
and dropped the game 30-17.
Stanford managed to build a 13-11
lead in the third game. But the USC
men clawed back to force a 17-17 tie
and didn't look back, winning 30-26.
The Stanford offense had its best
game of the night, though, hitting .289.
But the Trojans' match-low hitting
percentage was still better at .385.
Senior outside hitter Will Clayton
and senior middle blocker Chris
Ahlfeldt led the Stanford offense
with 11 kills apiece, while senior out
side hitter Nick Manov was error-free
with nine kills and a match-high .692
hitting percentage.
Senior setter Jeremy Jacobs
dished out 38 assists, half of them in
the third game alone.and contributed
on two of the Cardinal's three blocks
in the match. Reddy had Stanford's
lone service ace and led the team with
eight digs.
"We were not happy with how we
played against USC," Reddy said.
"That is the kind of inconsistency that
has been plaguing us this season. Pep
perdine is a better team than USC,
and if we had played on Friday night
the way we did on Saturday, we prob
ably would have won that game."
After losing badly to No. 13 USC,
Stanford came out swinging against
the third-ranked Waves.The Cardinal
built a 10-6 game one lead behind
three Clayton kills and a solo stuff
block by sophomore Matt Ceran. But
Pepperdine took advantage of four
consecutive Stanford errors to tie the
game at 15. The Waves then proceed
ed to gain their first lead of the night
at 19-18, and the team held on, win
ning 30-26.
In the second game, Pepperdine
jumped to an 8-3 lead. Stanford
closed to within three with an
Ahlfeldt ace at 10-13, but the Waves
dominated the rest of the game, lead

ing by as much as 10. Stanford fought
off four game points, but fell 30-24 on
a service error.
With their backs against the wall,
the Cardinal came out with renewed
vigor to start game three. With strong
blocking and impressive defensive
hustle, Stanford built a three-point
lead early on. After the Waves tied
the game, Stanford reeled off five
straight points, including a kill and
two aces by Reddy, but then Pepper
dine responded with a six-point run
of its own.
From then on, it was a dogfight
with neither team leading by more
than two. Stanford went up 25-24 and
Meredith's self-sacrifice into the
table raised the team's intensity.
Reddy tallied a kill to seal the 30-27
win for Stanford, forcing a fourth
game.
"Between the games, we just re
minded ourselves to have fun out

there" Redely said. "There was a
good crowd and when we got the mo
mentum going, the fans really got into
it."
But after their tenacious play in
the third game, the Cardinal stum
bled in the fourth. Rotation difficulty
and miscommunication on the Stan
ford side of the net put Pepperdine
ahead early. The lead ballooned to
seven at 21-14. and it looked like
Stanford was down for the count.
ITie Cardinal did not give up, how
ever, and solid blocking and serving
brought them right back in it. Stan
ford tied the game at 29 on a Reddy
kill, but a Cardinal service error and
Pepperdine kill ended the game 31-
29.
Reddy led the Stanford offense
with a match-high 27 kills on .250 hit
ting. He also recorded three of Stan
ford's seven aces on the night. Clay
ton contributed 10 kills and two aces.

Jacobs tallied 47 assists and a
team-high five blocks, and middle
blockers Ahlfeldt and Ceran each
added four blocks. Junior libero
Brian Lindberg led the team with 12
digs.
The Cardinal return to the gym
this week to prepare for top-ranked
BYU next weekend. Ivan Perez (4.26
kpg) and Russell Holmes (1.53 bpg)
lead the Cougars (12-2. 10-2). while
outside hitter Taylor Fivans (2.98 kpg,
1.31 dpg) is the brother-in-law of
Stanford junior and women's volley
ball star Kristin Richards. The Stan
ford men will be leaving Thursday to
get acclimated to playing at high ele
vation â€” Provo is 4.5(H) feet above
sea level.
"It's always a great place to play,"
Reddy said, "They always get a lot of
fans, very knowledgeable fans, but it's
also tough because of the cold and
the altitude."

the third game, the Cardinal stum
bled in the fourth. Rotation difficulty
and miscommunication on the Stan
ford side of the net put Pepperdine
ahead early. The lead ballooned to
seven at 21-14. and it looked like
Stanford was down for the count.
ITie Cardinal did not give up, how
ever, and solid blocking and serving
brought them right back in it. Stan
ford tied the game at 29 on a Reddy

29.
Reddy led the Stanford offense
with a match-high 27 kills on .250 hit
ting. He also recorded three of Stan

added four blocks. Junior libero
Brian Lindberg led the team with 12

There are only four weeks left in
the season, hut something is still miss
ing for the men's volleyball team.
They played well in spurts this week
end but came up short, losing to No.
13 Southern California in three
straight games and to No. 3 Pepper
dine in four.
"We have definitely shown im
provement in some areas," senior op
posite Ben Reddy said. "But things
are still not coming together like they
should."
At times this weekend, particular
ly the last two games against Pepper
dine (10-3, 10-3 MPSF) the Cardinal
(4-14, 2-10) showed their physical
and mental toughness. Sophomore
outside hitter Jesse Meredith
slammed into the scorer's table to
keep the ball alive and several of his
teammates chased balls down into
the far corners of Burnham Pavilion.
But the Cardinal could not main
tain that intensity and were doomed
by slow starts and long runs by their
opponents.
Against USC (8-9,5-7) on Friday
night, the Cardinal got off to a slow
start and were unable to bounce
back. The Trojans hit nearly flawless
ly in the first game, recording only a
single hitting error and 16 kills. Stan
ford had as many kills but eight more
hitting errors as it lost the game by
eight, 30-22.
After a tie early in game two.Stan
ford's hitting percentage slipped
slightly, from .189 to .107 while the
Trojans improved their offense, hit
ting .500 in the game. The Cardinal
had no answer for USC's firepower
and dropped the game 30-17.
Stanford managed to build a 13-11
lead in the third game. But the USC
men clawed back to force a 17-17 tie
and didn't look back, winning 30-26.
The Stanford offense had its best
game of the night, though, hitting .289.
But the Trojans' match-low hitting
percentage was still better at .385.
Senior outside hitter Will Clayton
and senior middle blocker Chris
Ahlfeldt led the Stanford offense
with 11 kills apiece, while senior out
side hitter Nick Manov was error-free
with nine kills and a match-high .692
hitting percentage.
Senior setter Jeremy Jacobs
dished out 38 assists, half of them in
the third game alone.and contributed
on two of the Cardinal's three blocks
in the match. Reddy had Stanford's
lone service ace and led the team with
eight digs.
"We were not happy with how we
played against USC," Reddy said.
"That is the kind of inconsistency that
has been plaguing us this season. Pep
perdine is a better team than USC,
and if we had played on Friday night
the way we did on Saturday, we prob
ably would have won that game."
After losing badly to No. 13 USC,
Stanford came out swinging against
the third-ranked Waves.The Cardinal
built a 10-6 game one lead behind
three Clayton kills and a solo stuff
block by sophomore Matt Ceran. But
Pepperdine took advantage of four
consecutive Stanford errors to tie the
game at 15. The Waves then proceed
ed to gain their first lead of the night
at 19-18, and the team held on, win
ning 30-26.
In the second game, Pepperdine
jumped to an 8-3 lead. Stanford
closed to within three with an
Ahlfeldt ace at 10-13, but the Waves
dominated the rest of the game, lead

ing by as much as 10. Stanford fought
off four game points, but fell 30-24 on
a service error.
With their backs against the wall,
the Cardinal came out with renewed
vigor to start game three. With strong
blocking and impressive defensive
hustle, Stanford built a three-point
lead early on. After the Waves tied
the game, Stanford reeled off five
straight points, including a kill and
two aces by Reddy, but then Pepper
dine responded with a six-point run
of its own.
From then on, it was a dogfight
with neither team leading by more
than two. Stanford went up 25-24 and
Meredith's self-sacrifice into the
table raised the team's intensity.
Reddy tallied a kill to seal the 30-27
win for Stanford, forcing a fourth
game.
"Between the games, we just re
minded ourselves to have fun out

there" Redely said. "There was a
good crowd and when we got the mo
mentum going, the fans really got into
it."
