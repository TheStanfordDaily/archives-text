# TREE! TREE! TREE!
## Potential Trees get serious Stunts get progressively weirder by the day 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
Despite the rain, three Tree Week
candidates made strong showings in
White Plaza yesterday to generate
buzz for their campaigns.
At 11 a.m.. junior Christina Zem
pel and her followers met in front of

Dinkelspiel audi
torium during
Dr. William De- J
merit's "Sleep!
and Dreams" 1
lecture. Before a "
guest lecture!
began, a teaching

sistant directed the class to say
"Kool-Aid is Red Alert" and Zempel
burst through a sheet of paper
dressed like the Kool-Aid Guy.
"Oh yeah," exclaimed Zempel,
imitating the popular catchphrase of
the giant red jug.
She left immediately afterwards.
Her entourage, including former
Tree and co-terminal student Erin
Lashnits and several newly-appoint
ed Dollies, then followed Zempel to
Kresge Auditorium, where a mem
ber of Zempel's faithful had been
planted in one of the front rows of
the ongoing Econ 1 lecture.
"I could really use some Kool-Aid
right now," the unidentified student
exclaimed.
"Oh yeah," answered Zempel,
once again breaking through the
paper.
"That's disappointing," said Prof.
Antonio Rangel, who was lecturing
during the stunts. "I thought they
were going to make you drink the
Kool-Aid."
The act was repeated again in
Cubberley Auditorium for another
unsuspecting lecture. The group then
headed up the Lasuen Mall to White
Plaza, where red Kool-Aid was
poured out of 40-oz. beer bottles into
cups which the followers drank,
promptly falling motionless to the
ground â€” a mock mass suicide of
sorts.
"It's time for us to leave our
empty vessels and go to the great be
yond," said Zempel. "Let us com
mence the ceremony, as though we
were Heaven's Gate. Drink! Z for
TVee!"
On Sunday night, senior Tommy
Leep's "Tommy for TYee" e-mail list
received a cryptic message.
