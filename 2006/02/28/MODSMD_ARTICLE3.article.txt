# TREE! TREE! TREE!
## Potential Trees get serious Stunts get progressively weirder by the day 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
Despite the rain, three Tree Week
candidates made strong showings in
White Plaza yesterday to generate
buzz for their campaigns.
At 11 a.m.. junior Christina Zem
pel and her followers met in front of

Dinkelspiel audi
torium during
Dr. William De- J
merit's "Sleep!
and Dreams" 1
lecture. Before a "
guest lecture!
began, a teaching

sistant directed the class to say
"Kool-Aid is Red Alert" and Zempel
burst through a sheet of paper
dressed like the Kool-Aid Guy.
"Oh yeah," exclaimed Zempel,
imitating the popular catchphrase of
the giant red jug.
She left immediately afterwards.
Her entourage, including former
Tree and co-terminal student Erin
Lashnits and several newly-appoint
ed Dollies, then followed Zempel to
Kresge Auditorium, where a mem
ber of Zempel's faithful had been
planted in one of the front rows of
the ongoing Econ 1 lecture.
"I could really use some Kool-Aid
right now," the unidentified student
exclaimed.
"Oh yeah," answered Zempel,
once again breaking through the
paper.
"That's disappointing," said Prof.
Antonio Rangel, who was lecturing
during the stunts. "I thought they
were going to make you drink the
Kool-Aid."
The act was repeated again in
Cubberley Auditorium for another
unsuspecting lecture. The group then
headed up the Lasuen Mall to White
Plaza, where red Kool-Aid was
poured out of 40-oz. beer bottles into
cups which the followers drank,
promptly falling motionless to the
ground — a mock mass suicide of
sorts.
"It's time for us to leave our
empty vessels and go to the great be
yond," said Zempel. "Let us com
mence the ceremony, as though we
were Heaven's Gate. Drink! Z for
TVee!"
On Sunday night, senior Tommy
Leep's "Tommy for TYee" e-mail list
received a cryptic message.

"This one's a throwback to older times.
I've been accused of a series of heretical
crimes," said the e-mail. "You've seen my es
cort, my bling, my rage and my d*ck [sic].
Enjoy, on Monday, my ass getting kicked."
Then yesterday at noon, a crowd gathered
next to a large pillory that had been set up in
White Plaza. A sign next to the stocks read,
"Public Execution at Noon" Leep was led in
from the Row by a group of captors dressed
entirely in black. Leep dragged a large wood
en square behind him, and his chest hair and
nipples were covered with clear packing
tape.

— captor of senior TOMMY LEER Tree candidate

"Thomas Elwood Leep has been accused
of the crime of heresy for thinking that he
could become a tree," one of Leep's captors
read from a scroll. "His verdict: guilty. Sen-

tence: He must undergo the five pains that a
tree suffers. First pain: the torture of loss.
Like trees that lose their needles, Leep must
lose his chest hair."
And with that, ropes were attached to
Leep's hands and feet and he was held to the
ground by four of his captors. The tape on
Leep's chest was quickly ripped off, leaving
him writhing in pain.
"The second torture: the torture of wind,"
said the captor. "Like trees that get tossed by
the breeze. Leep must have his feet tickled."
A long palm frond was brought out and
the captors tickled Leep's feet.
"Third: the torture of excretion," said the
darkly dressed man. "Like trees that sap
themselves, Leep must be covered in syrup."
The four men who held Leep's ropes took
bottles of maple syrup and covered him com
pletely.
"Fourth: the torture of birth," said the
man. "Like trees that bear fruit, Leep must
bear them in his face."
He was then led up to the stocks and was
locked in them after a brief struggle. The cap
tors distributed fruit among the crowd for
throwing at Leep, and soon he was covered in
tomatoes, lettuce and eggs.
"Those tomatoes are hard," observed a fe
male fruit assailant.
"Fifth: the torture of hanging." said the
scroll-reader."Like trees that stand tall, Leep
must get hung and drink the blood of the pre
vious tree."
".157," quipped an unidentified spectator.
Leep was hoisted onto a nearby tree, se
cured by straps, and forced to drink the liquid
that was presented to him through a funnel
tube. He was then released, falling heavily to
the ground.
"Let this be the penalty for all those who
consider themselves Tree," said the captor,
and bystanders began to shuffle away, think
ing the stunt was over.
But then Leep staggered to his feet.
"TREEDOM!" he yelled.
A group of students dressed in blue plas
tic and wielding an assortment of medieval
weapons stormed Leep's captors, dispatched
them and carried Leep back to the Row on
their shoulders.
At 12:40 p.m., sophomore Daniel Novin
son, managing editor of sports for The Daily,
emerged from a tent that had been erected
under the bird cage. Novinson launched into
a tirade against his fellow candidates but was
interrupted, chased down and tackled by his
campaign managers, the Chicken and the
Rabbit. The Chicken commenced beating
Novinson with a hockey stick and the Rabbit
added a phrase to Novinson's "Trees Don't"
list.
"Trees don't talk, except about Tree," the
Rabbit wrote.
The two farm animals then duct-taped
Novinson's mouth shut and left him on the
grass in front of Tresidder
"The institution ofTree is larger than any
one individual,so with my sacrifices I'm try
ing to put 'Tree' before 'me' in all my

stunts," Novinson told The Daily. "The Rab
bit and the Chicken are merciless in their
persecution and beatings. 1 think it's be
cause I'm Jewish, but these heathens need
to realize it's not 1943 Munich. It's all in the
hands of my animal masters, but I snuck a
peek at their future plans and all I saw was
the word 're-circumcision' in big. bold red
letters, circled repeatedly and surrounded
by little AIM smiley faces. I'm really scared
— where's my mommy when 1 need her to
hold me?"
A group of dedicated Tree Week ob
servers gathered in the pouring rain at 6
p.m. yesterday for Novinson's announced
addition to his list. Though the Chicken and
Rabbit showed up to add "Change clothes

or practice hygiene" to the "Trees Don't"
list in White Plaza, N was strangely
absent. However, a note from the campaign
advisors assured spectators that N
would he back for his 12:40 p.m. addition to
morrow.
Aside from N's 12:40 p.m. and 6
p.m. planned stunts, Leep e-mailed his list to
inform them that he will "be hanging around
White Plaza in the morning, so come say hi
on your way to class." Then "at noon at the
Intersection of Death, my years of playing
Nintendo games will come to fruition. Mind
the caution tape."
"Try to keep lunchtime open," advised
Tree Week coordinator Bryan Schell, a jun
ior. "Lots of things are happening this week."

lecture. Before a "
guest lecture!
began, a teaching

sistant directed the class to say
"Kool-Aid is Red Alert" and Zempel
burst through a sheet of paper
dressed like the Kool-Aid Guy.
"Oh yeah," exclaimed Zempel,
imitating the popular catchphrase of
the giant red jug.
She left immediately afterwards.
Her entourage, including former
Tree and co-terminal student Erin
Lashnits and several newly-appoint
ed Dollies, then followed Zempel to
Kresge Auditorium, where a mem
ber of Zempel's faithful had been
planted in one of the front rows of
the ongoing Econ 1 lecture.
"I could really use some Kool-Aid
right now," the unidentified student
exclaimed.
"Oh yeah," answered Zempel,
once again breaking through the
paper.
"That's disappointing," said Prof.
Antonio Rangel, who was lecturing
during the stunts. "I thought they
were going to make you drink the
Kool-Aid."
The act was repeated again in
Cubberley Auditorium for another
unsuspecting lecture. The group then
headed up the Lasuen Mall to White
Plaza, where red Kool-Aid was
poured out of 40-oz. beer bottles into
cups which the followers drank,
promptly falling motionless to the
ground — a mock mass suicide of
sorts.
"It's time for us to leave our
empty vessels and go to the great be
yond," said Zempel. "Let us com
mence the ceremony, as though we
were Heaven's Gate. Drink! Z for
TVee!"
On Sunday night, senior Tommy
Leep's "Tommy for TYee" e-mail list
received a cryptic message.

"This one's a throwback to older times.
I've been accused of a series of heretical
crimes," said the e-mail. "You've seen my es
cort, my bling, my rage and my d*ck [sic].
Enjoy, on Monday, my ass getting kicked."
Then yesterday at noon, a crowd gathered
next to a large pillory that had been set up in
White Plaza. A sign next to the stocks read,
"Public Execution at Noon" Leep was led in
from the Row by a group of captors dressed
entirely in black. Leep dragged a large wood
en square behind him, and his chest hair and
nipples were covered with clear packing
tape.

— captor of senior TOMMY LEER Tree candidate

"Thomas Elwood Leep has been accused
of the crime of heresy for thinking that he
could become a tree," one of Leep's captors
read from a scroll. "His verdict: guilty. Sen-

tence: He must undergo the five pains that a
tree suffers. First pain: the torture of loss.
Like trees that lose their needles, Leep must
lose his chest hair."
And with that, ropes were attached to
Leep's hands and feet and he was held to the
ground by four of his captors. The tape on
Leep's chest was quickly ripped off, leaving
him writhing in pain.
"The second torture: the torture of wind,"
said the captor. "Like trees that get tossed by
the breeze. Leep must have his feet tickled."
A long palm frond was brought out and
the captors tickled Leep's feet.
"Third: the torture of excretion," said the
darkly dressed man. "Like trees that sap
themselves, Leep must be covered in syrup."
The four men who held Leep's ropes took
bottles of maple syrup and covered him com
pletely.
"Fourth: the torture of birth," said the
man. "Like trees that bear fruit, Leep must
bear them in his face."
He was then led up to the stocks and was
locked in them after a brief struggle. The cap
tors distributed fruit among the crowd for
throwing at Leep, and soon he was covered in
tomatoes, lettuce and eggs.
"Those tomatoes are hard," observed a fe
male fruit assailant.
"Fifth: the torture of hanging." said the
scroll-reader."Like trees that stand tall, Leep
must get hung and drink the blood of the pre
vious tree."
".157," quipped an unidentified spectator.
Leep was hoisted onto a nearby tree, se
cured by straps, and forced to drink the liquid
that was presented to him through a funnel
tube. He was then released, falling heavily to
the ground.
"Let this be the penalty for all those who
consider themselves Tree," said the captor,
and bystanders began to shuffle away, think
ing the stunt was over.
But then Leep staggered to his feet.
"TREEDOM!" he yelled.
A group of students dressed in blue plas
tic and wielding an assortment of medieval
weapons stormed Leep's captors, dispatched
them and carried Leep back to the Row on
their shoulders.
At 12:40 p.m., sophomore Daniel Novin
son, managing editor of sports for The Daily,
emerged from a tent that had been erected
under the bird cage. Novinson launched into
a tirade against his fellow candidates but was
interrupted, chased down and tackled by his
campaign managers, the Chicken and the
Rabbit. The Chicken commenced beating
Novinson with a hockey stick and the Rabbit
added a phrase to Novinson's "Trees Don't"
list.
"Trees don't talk, except about Tree," the
Rabbit wrote.
The two farm animals then duct-taped
Novinson's mouth shut and left him on the
grass in front of Tresidder
"The institution ofTree is larger than any
one individual,so with my sacrifices I'm try
ing to put 'Tree' before 'me' in all my

stunts," Novinson told The Daily. "The Rab
bit and the Chicken are merciless in their
persecution and beatings. 1 think it's be
cause I'm Jewish, but these heathens need
to realize it's not 1943 Munich. It's all in the
hands of my animal masters, but I snuck a
peek at their future plans and all I saw was
the word 're-circumcision' in big. bold red
letters, circled repeatedly and surrounded
by little AIM smiley faces. I'm really scared
— where's my mommy when 1 need her to
hold me?"
A group of dedicated Tree Week ob
servers gathered in the pouring rain at 6
p.m. yesterday for Novinson's announced
addition to his list. Though the Chicken and
Rabbit showed up to add "Change clothes

or practice hygiene" to the "Trees Don't"
list in White Plaza, N was strangely
absent. However, a note from the campaign
advisors assured spectators that N
would he back for his 12:40 p.m. addition to
morrow.
Aside from N's 12:40 p.m. and 6
p.m. planned stunts, Leep e-mailed his list to
inform them that he will "be hanging around
White Plaza in the morning, so come say hi
on your way to class." Then "at noon at the
Intersection of Death, my years of playing
Nintendo games will come to fruition. Mind
the caution tape."
"Try to keep lunchtime open," advised
Tree Week coordinator Bryan Schell, a jun
ior. "Lots of things are happening this week."

buzz for their campaigns.
