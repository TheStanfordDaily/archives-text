## Team finishes fifth at Hilo invitational 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES STAFF WRITER 
A momentum-building fifth
place finish at the Hilo Intercolle
giate Invitational two weeks ago
leaves the men's golf team ready
for more today and tomorrow at
the Ashworth Collegiate Invita
tional in West Lake Village, Calif.
"I think the morale's high right
now and the guys are fired up for
the Ashworth," head coach Con
rad Ray said. "We had a good
start a couple weeks ago, and I
feel good about this coming
week."
In Hawaii Feb. 8-10, the squad
was able to ride up the rankings
from 16th to fifth after three
rounds. An uncharacteristically
strong final round was matched
by the excellent individual per
formances of junior Matt Savage
and freshman Dodge Kemmer,
who earned 17th and 29th, respec
tively. Usual team leader Rob
Grube also contributed, but fin
ished 39th.
For the Ashworth, the Cardi
nal will have the same lineup,
which also included junior Zack
Miller and freshman Daniel Lim.
Ray said the repeat was the result
of a close qualifying match. The
squad is currently more focused,
though, on the challenge the
North Ranch course presents.
"North ranch is a tighter

course," Ray said. "There aren't
as many drivers and the course is
in the middle of a housing devel
opment, so it's not as open as our
course here is."
"We've dedicated a lot of time
to practicing on the putting green
this week," Ray added. "We've
also spent a lot of time working on
ball control since the greens are
small and the fairways are tight."
Another obstacle will be the
weather, as showers are expected
during both days of the invita
tional. The Cardinal have been
practicing coping with inclement,
however, because it proved a
major factor in the fall.
The Cardinal will face an espe
cially strong field, including Pac
-10 rivals No. 5 UCLA, Washing
ton and Southern California. No.
6 BYU will also compete, but the
Bruins pose the greatest chal
lenge. in Ray's opinion, with six
players ranked in the top 100.
Still, the team is confident. As
Ray described, the men are "seri
ous," and "understand that it's
crunch time" now in the spring.
They have prepared well and ex
pect to continue to peak.
"I think we're headed in the
right direction for the spring,"
Kemmer said. "I wouldn't be the
least bit surprised if we have mul
tiple wins this spring, and what
better place to start than the Ash
worth?"
