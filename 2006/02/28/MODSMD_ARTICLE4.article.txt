# TO REBUILD OR ABANDON?
## Lecture explores the civil engineering, city planning and social effects of Hurricane Katrina 
### KATHERINE COX STAFF WRITER 
A handful of rain-soaked listeners gathered
yesterday evening at 7:30 p.m. to hear a city
planner, an engineer and a social scientist
speak in Braun Hall about how to prudently
approach reconstructing the city of New Or
leans. The lecture, entitled "Assessing Katrina:
Rebuild or Abandon?" was sponsored by Stan
ford's Woods Institute for the Environment.
The event was the third installment in the
four-part "Assessing Katrina: Ecosystems, Ur
banization and the Real Cost of Reclamation"
series, funded by the School of Earth Sciences,
the Woods Institute for the Environment —
which recently received a $30 million endow
ment and was renamed for its benefactors.
Ward W. and Priscilla Woods — and the Free
man Spogli Institute for International Studies

and Continuing Studies. The series' first two
lectures were held on Jan. 23 and Feb. 6 and ex
amined natural disaster and urbanization in
coastal ecosystems.
Woods institute Director Prof. Buzz
Thompson, who also teaches natural resources
law at the Law School, introduced the guest
speakers. Kenneth Topping, a former planning
director for the City of Los Angeles and San
Bernardino County. David Sykora of Expo
nent Failure Analysis Associates and Stan
ford's Martin Luther King, Jr. Centennial Prof.
Lawrence Bobo addressed different considera
tions pertinent to the reconstruction effort.
Topping, the first to speak, also teaches part
time in the City and Regional Planning De
partment at California Polytechnic State Uni
versity Responsible for developing LA's pre
disaster Recovery and Reconstruction Plan,
Topping provided an explanation for why cities

are often vulnerable to catastrophe and used
several examples of historical ruin and recov
ery to highlight U.S. policies that he believes
need to change.
Topping's presentation addressed the cen
tral and often-asked question,"Why do vulner
able places like New Orleans get built?" His
torical examples. Topping explained, suggest
that the city's location is invested in the "eco
nomics, convenience or aesthetics" of the
place. He listed commerce and access to the
Mississippi River, the Gulf of Mexico and. ulti
mately, to oil, as reasons New Orleans is poised
in this precarious stretch of land.
Topping also deconstructed the nation's
emergency response to the Hurricane Katrina
disaster. He charged the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FFiMA) with having
responded inadequately to what he
termed "the biggest natural disas
ter in U.S. history, with more than
$125 billion in direct and indirect
costs."
Topping suggested that "after
9/11, the government's focus shifted
from guarding against natural disas
ters to strengthening homeland se
curity." In the same way that devel
opers must rebuild what remains of
New Orleans, "FEMA was essen
tially broken and must be rebuilt."
Topping added. "I think it must
become much more flexible and in
dependent to regain its effective
ness."
David Sykora, a senior technical
manager at a consulting firm that
specializes in analyzing the circum
stances under which disasters occur,
spoke next. Among other disaster
related projects, he investigated the
structural damage incurred by the
bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah
Federal Building in Oklahoma City.
Sykora's presentation discussed the
technical failures of the New Or

leans levee systems. At the outset,
Sykora stated that his objective
"would be to provide a civil engi
neer's perspective on whether or
not to rebuild or abandon [New Or
leans]."
Sykora addressed four main
questions surrounding the efficacy
of the New Orleans pre-Katrina
levee and floodwall system, the
type of design required for catego
ry 3.4 or 5 hurricanes and the risk of
failure of new systems. Sykora pre
sented slides that contained in
depth analysis of the considerations
engineers face in fortifying and re
building these structures. Among
the many new systems proposed.
Sykora detailed what might be im
plemented in the areas of the 17th
Street. Orleans Ave and London
Ave canals — regions hit hard by
flooding. He explained that "[tem
porary] flood gate[s] can be used
near the lake" that borders these
streets, "to control the storm
surge."
Sykora suggested that the mean
recurrences that a hurricane strikes
within a certain radius of New Or
leans for category 3, 4 and 5 hurri
canes. indicate that a flood-barrier
system strong enough to withstand
a more intense hurricane should be

implemented if the city is indeed re
built. To summarize these statistics,
Sykora noted that "every year there
is a one to two percent chance that a
category 5 hurricane will strike in a
75-mile radius."
The final speaker, Boho — who
directs both the Center for Com
parative Studies in Race and Eth
nicity and the Program in African
and African American Studies at
Stanford — provided a social ra
tionale for rebuilding New Orleans.
Hobo enumerated the many ways in
which black residents of New Or
leans represented the lowest rung
of the social and economic ladder.
A possible impetus for reconstruc
tion, he suggested,is the positive so
cial improvement these victims
could enjoy if the city were rebuilt
"in a fashion that doesn't recreate
the racial segregations that once ex
isted."
Bobo spoke about the "trou
bling" media images that brought to
the publics conscious the issue of
racial inequalities. He said that he
felt these images helped to dispel
several prevailing myths about the
socioeconomic condition of the
United States' poor.
"Those images became power
fully etched in the national psyche

because they shatter the myths that
extreme poverty no longer exists in
the United States, that our nation
has largely solved the race problem
and that there are few collective or
social ends outside of national de
fense and social security that are en
during social duties or services that
the government owes the public,"
he said.
Bobo also discussed how Lati
nos, blacks and other minorities
often fall into the "extreme pover
ty" bracket, defined as "50 percent
below the official poverty level for a
particular household size." Individ
uals under extreme poverty were
concentrated together in the racial
ly segregated neighborhoods in
New Orleans. He noted the racial
group with the fewest resources was
the most devastated by the hurri
cane. The receipt of only a meager
response from the government by
these people suggests that many
racial and economic problems have
not been resolved in America, he
said.

ing Katrina series, entitled "Deal

on March 6 at 7:30 p.m. in

the publics conscious the issue of
racial inequalities. He said that he
felt these images helped to dispel
several prevailing myths about the
socioeconomic condition of the
United States' poor.
"Those images became power
fully etched in the national psyche

because they shatter the myths that
extreme poverty no longer exists in
the United States, that our nation
has largely solved the race problem
and that there are few collective or
social ends outside of national de
fense and social security that are en
during social duties or services that
the government owes the public,"
he said.
Bobo also discussed how Lati
nos, blacks and other minorities
often fall into the "extreme pover
ty" bracket, defined as "50 percent
below the official poverty level for a
particular household size." Individ
uals under extreme poverty were
concentrated together in the racial
ly segregated neighborhoods in
New Orleans. He noted the racial
group with the fewest resources was
the most devastated by the hurri
cane. The receipt of only a meager
response from the government by
these people suggests that many
racial and economic problems have
not been resolved in America, he
said.
The final lecture in the Assess
ing Katrina series, entitled "Deal
ing with Disasters," will take place
on March 6 at 7:30 p.m. in
Fairchild Auditorium the Medical
School.
A handful of rain-soaked listeners gathered
yesterday evening at 7:30 p.m. to hear a city
planner, an engineer and a social scientist
speak in Braun Hall about how to prudently
approach reconstructing the city of New Or
leans. The lecture, entitled "Assessing Katrina:
Rebuild or Abandon?" was sponsored by Stan
ford's Woods Institute for the Environment.
The event was the third installment in the
four-part "Assessing Katrina: Ecosystems, Ur
banization and the Real Cost of Reclamation"
series, funded by the School of Earth Sciences,
the Woods Institute for the Environment —
which recently received a $30 million endow
ment and was renamed for its benefactors.
Ward W. and Priscilla Woods — and the Free
man Spogli Institute for International Studies

and Continuing Studies. The series' first two
lectures were held on Jan. 23 and Feb. 6 and ex
amined natural disaster and urbanization in
coastal ecosystems.
Woods institute Director Prof. Buzz
Thompson, who also teaches natural resources
law at the Law School, introduced the guest
speakers. Kenneth Topping, a former planning
director for the City of Los Angeles and San
Bernardino County. David Sykora of Expo
nent Failure Analysis Associates and Stan
ford's Martin Luther King, Jr. Centennial Prof.
Lawrence Bobo addressed different considera
tions pertinent to the reconstruction effort.
Topping, the first to speak, also teaches part
time in the City and Regional Planning De
partment at California Polytechnic State Uni
versity Responsible for developing LA's pre
disaster Recovery and Reconstruction Plan,
Topping provided an explanation for why cities

are often vulnerable to catastrophe and used
several examples of historical ruin and recov
ery to highlight U.S. policies that he believes
need to change.
Topping's presentation addressed the cen
tral and often-asked question,"Why do vulner
able places like New Orleans get built?" His
torical examples. Topping explained, suggest
that the city's location is invested in the "eco
nomics, convenience or aesthetics" of the
place. He listed commerce and access to the
Mississippi River, the Gulf of Mexico and. ulti
mately, to oil, as reasons New Orleans is poised
in this precarious stretch of land.
Topping also deconstructed the nation's
emergency response to the Hurricane Katrina
disaster. He charged the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FFiMA) with having
responded inadequately to what he
termed "the biggest natural disas
ter in U.S. history, with more than
$125 billion in direct and indirect
costs."
Topping suggested that "after
9/11, the government's focus shifted
from guarding against natural disas
ters to strengthening homeland se
curity." In the same way that devel
opers must rebuild what remains of
New Orleans, "FEMA was essen
tially broken and must be rebuilt."
Topping added. "I think it must
become much more flexible and in
dependent to regain its effective
ness."
David Sykora, a senior technical
manager at a consulting firm that
specializes in analyzing the circum
stances under which disasters occur,
spoke next. Among other disaster
related projects, he investigated the
structural damage incurred by the
bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah
Federal Building in Oklahoma City.
Sykora's presentation discussed the
technical failures of the New Or

leans levee systems. At the outset,
Sykora stated that his objective
"would be to provide a civil engi
neer's perspective on whether or
not to rebuild or abandon [New Or
leans]."
Sykora addressed four main
questions surrounding the efficacy
of the New Orleans pre-Katrina
levee and floodwall system, the
type of design required for catego
ry 3.4 or 5 hurricanes and the risk of
failure of new systems. Sykora pre
sented slides that contained in
depth analysis of the considerations
engineers face in fortifying and re
building these structures. Among
the many new systems proposed.
Sykora detailed what might be im
plemented in the areas of the 17th
Street. Orleans Ave and London
Ave canals — regions hit hard by
flooding. He explained that "[tem
porary] flood gate[s] can be used
near the lake" that borders these
streets, "to control the storm
surge."
Sykora suggested that the mean
recurrences that a hurricane strikes
within a certain radius of New Or
leans for category 3, 4 and 5 hurri
canes. indicate that a flood-barrier
system strong enough to withstand
a more intense hurricane should be

implemented if the city is indeed re
built. To summarize these statistics,
Sykora noted that "every year there
is a one to two percent chance that a
category 5 hurricane will strike in a
75-mile radius."
The final speaker, Boho — who
directs both the Center for Com
parative Studies in Race and Eth
nicity and the Program in African
and African American Studies at
Stanford — provided a social ra
tionale for rebuilding New Orleans.
Hobo enumerated the many ways in
which black residents of New Or
leans represented the lowest rung
of the social and economic ladder.
A possible impetus for reconstruc
tion, he suggested,is the positive so
cial improvement these victims
could enjoy if the city were rebuilt
"in a fashion that doesn't recreate
the racial segregations that once ex
isted."
