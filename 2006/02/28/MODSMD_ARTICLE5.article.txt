# KILL DORMMATES
## "People have become extremely paranoid." 
### BEN EPPLER STAFF WRITER 
When ASSU Senate Chair Chris
Nguyen brought a water gun to the Under
graduate Senate meeting on Jan. 24 to pro
tect himself from would-be killers, it served
as a clear indication that Assassins season
was back. Yes, the persistent reality game is
once again sweeping Stanford dorms this
quarter in a variety of forms. With games
running in Freshman / Sophomore Col
lege, Rinconada and Branner, the para
noia-inducing game of hunters and the
hunted is causing many around campus to
guard their backs carefully.
"Rules of Play: Game Design Funda
mentals" defines Assassins as a "lifestyle
invading game." It is "essentially a live-ac
tion roleplaying game," according to
Wikipedia. Players are secretly assigned a
target, whom they attempt to kill —by
means which vary depending on the rules of
the particular game — knowing that they
too are being hunted by another player.

— DENISE SOHN, devious freshman assassin

Games vary from the extremely in
volved, with pages of rules and übiquitous
water guns, to the simple. Branner's game,
characterized as an "unofficial pick up
game" by its freshman creator Amara
Humprey, uses Post-it notes for weapons.
Rule concerning safe areas also tend to
vary. While class and the target's living
quarters are considered safe in most ver
sions. some games also exempt computer
clusters, dorm events and bathrooms.
Assassins has been played at least since
the 1980s, according to Wikipedia. and is
most popular on college campuses.
"It's great, especially in the beginning."
said freshman Amir Ghodrati. who leads
Branner's game with nine kills. "But as it
goes on, people stop trying to kill each
other and it gets boring."
To keep the game from stagnating.
FroSoCo employs a "terminator" rule,
where any assassin failing to report a kill
within a certain time limit is hunted down
by terminators, who are essentially inde
structible assassins with the express pur

pose of removing those who play too slow
ly-
As of Saturday, five people remained
alive in the FroSoCo game, a game rife with
betrayals. Freshman Denise Sohn. who on
Friday was one of fewer than half of the 78
initial participants still alive, got her first kill
while wishing her college assistant a happy
birthday.
"People have become extremely para
noid, carrying their water guns around at all
times and being afraid to go anywhere
alone," she wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
Paranoia is both the consequence of
and the key to success in this game, said
Francis Ring, coordinator of the FroSoCo
game.
"Most kills come from stalking people
on their way to class," he wrote. "Also, of
course, there are the many betrayals by so
called friends."
I loping to capitalize on the popularity of
dorm Assassins, the ASSU Student Life


A would-be assassin in Branner Hall pursues his unwilling victim. The annual game made its way around various dorms as usual
this quarter, although tentative plans for a campus-wide version are in the early stage.
Committee sponsored a campus-wide
variant in spring of 2(X)2 that drew 35
participants from 19 dormitories.
Few now remember the game.
Andrew Cross, a history major
who graduated last quarter, recalled
his experience. "I was a freshman
and I killed this dude in ZAP." he
said. "And then, somehow I blew the
job on someone in Roble and died. It
was cool, but not as cool as it could
have been."
Although publicized in The
Daily, the game drew relatively few
participants.
After the game concluded, game
organizer Eric Lai. Class of'o3, said,
"At a school with thousands of stu

dents, I know there must be more
than 35 people paranoid enough to
enjoy a campus-wide version of As
sassins."
But the idea of a renewed cam
pus-wide game has met a lukewarm
reception. "I don't want to
play with a bunch of people I've
never heard of in my life," said Gho
drati.'it's not fun."
" Ilie concept of stalking people
you don't even know would be a lit
tle scary, even in a game," Ring
agreed.
In spite of the alleged creepiness,
some intrepid souls expressed that
they would be interested.
Said freshman Danny Berring,
"Is it invasive? Yes. Would my priva
cy be threatened? Yes. But that's
what makes it fun."
"If they could get it together
again, it would be awesome," Cross
agreed.
