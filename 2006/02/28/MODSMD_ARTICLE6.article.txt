## Web surfers earn money for charity Alum's GoodSearch.com raises money by searching the Internet 
### MIKI SOFER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For Web-addicted Stanford students, the
thought "If only I had a penny for every time I
searched the Web ," may cross minds often.
Ideas such as this led Ken Ramberg, Class of
'87, and his sister JJ to found Good Search.com,
a one-of-a-kind search engine that allows Web
surfers to earn money for their favorite causes
through the simple act of searching the Internet.
Launched in November, this Yahoo-powered
search engine operates like any other,Ramberg
explained.
"(The Yahoo interface] is important because
when users visit the site they get the exact same
high-quality search results that they are accus
tomed to," he said.
The site is easy to navigate. Users simply ac
cess the Web site, designate the charity or school
to which they would like to donate by entering a
keyword and then type their query into the
search field.
The unique aspect is what happens behind
the scenes. Typically, search engines
earn money by charging companies
an advertising fee when users click
on that company's link during a
search. Good Search has developed a
way to track and redirect a portion of
these proceeds so that with each
search, 50 percent of the revenue
generated by advertisers goes to the
school or charity selected by the user.
The proceeds average out to about a
penny per search.
"TTie Web generated about $6 bil
lion last year through advertisements
through search engines," Ramberg
said. "Our thought was, 'What if we
could direct the revenue toward
good causes?'"
The founding of Good Search was
aided by Romberg's previous experi
ence with the Internet industry. He
was the co-founder and President of
JOBTRAK. an online career site for
college students and recent gradu
ates that was acquired by
Monster.com in 2(XX).
Also in 2(XX). however, tragedy
struck. Losing his mother to cancer put
things in perspective. Ramberg said.
"1 became involved in a number
of charities, and it really hit home
how difficult and time consuming it
was to raise money," he said. "Putting
the two ideas together — Internet
plus charities —just seemed like a
wonderful idea."
Since its launch last year, Good-
Search has generated a lot of buzz.
Ramberg estimates that approxi
mately 8(X).(XX) charities and schools
have become involved so far, includ

ing The Bay Area Defense Commit
tee for Battered Women. The Susan
G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation
and, on campus, the ASSU.
Although it is too soon to talk
about numbers in terms of searches
and revenues, the Good Search Web
site projects that a "small charity or
school with 1(X) supporters searching
twice a day would receive $730 per
year" based on the penny-per-search
standard. A large charity with 10,(XX)
supporters could earn as much as
$73.(XX) per year.
Good Search has the potential to
help generate donations for recent
major disasters like Hurricane Katri
na, but it can also spread the word
about lesser-known causes that typi
cally may have a hard time raising
funds. Such charities and schools
benefit tremendously from the in
creased exposure that is provided by
a listing with Good Search, especially
if featured as the site's "Charity of
the Day."
Mark Rieck of the Juvenile Re
search Diabetes Fund (JDRF),
which funds $1(X) million of type 1 di
abetes research annually, explained
that Good Search has already provid
ed a great service to the constituents
of the JDRF Los Angeles Chapter by
allowing families of children with
type 1 diabetes to direct funds to
ward this organization.
"We just started promoting this
service to our constituents last week
and expect to engage at least I,(XX)
users in Los Angeles and generate
$10.(XX) for JDRF this year," Rieck
said. "Other JDRF Chapters are
starting to use it too."
The Penn State Dance Marathon
(THON), a year-round event that
raises money to find a cure for pedi
atric cancer, has also made use of the

advertising and fundraising opportu
nities afforded by Good Search.
In an e-mail to The Daily, THON
chair Evan Jacobs said that the site
was advertised to over 10,000 stu
dents and alumni. In the last two
months, THON has raised $348 —
and counting — through Good-
Search alone.
"Good Search has been a valuable
resource for our organization this
year," said Jacobs. "1 would definitely
recommend this site for other
schools and charities. It is easy money
if you have a large support base, espe
cially if that base consists of college
age students who use the Internet all
the time."
As support for a particular cause
grows, inevitably so will the number
of Good Search users.
"I think it's an excellent business
model because they are creating in
centives for NGOs to do outreach for
them," said junior Nikhil Sachdev.
Rieck predicts that Good Search
will become a major player in the
philanthropic arena. First, however, it
will need to generate the support of
search-engine users across the Unit
ed States.
When asked whether he would
use Good Search. junior Brian Bur
ton replied, "probably only if it be
came the default search engine."
Despite an increased social
awareness, convenience remains an
issue. Expansion of the Good Search
clientele base in the face of students'
established habits may likely be the
next challenge facing the young Web
site.
