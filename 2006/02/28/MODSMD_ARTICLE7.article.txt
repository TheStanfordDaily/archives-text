## Roosevelt holds T-shirt design contest The 						national student think tank is currently accepting submissions 
### LAURA CARWILE STAFF WRITER 
Nearly everyone has heard about the Roo
sevelt Institution, the nation's first student-cre
ated progressive think tank that is found at var
ious universities across the nation — including
a thriving chapter on Stanford's campus.
But the nationwide student group has taken
another step to promote awareness of the Roo
sevelt Institution at universities — a T-shirt de
sign contest.
In true Roosevelt tradition, the future of the
T-shirt will lie in the hands of students, one of
whom will win $300 to be split be
tween the student and his or her uni
versity's chapter. It will also be fea
tured for sale on the Roosevelt Insti
tution's Web site.
Junior Vilas Rao, communica
tions director for the Stanford chap
ter, is in charge of the nationwide
contest.
"Roosevelt's national presence
has already been witnessed by poli
cymakers, newspaper headlines and
progressive leaders across the coun
try." he said. "But we would like to
make Roosevelt most visible at

home on our college campuses."
The decision to make it a student
led contest fit in well with Roo
sevelt's goals.
"We could have simply had a de
signer create a T-shirt for us," he
said,"but instead we decided that we
would let students express their vi
sions of the Roosevelt Institution."
The winning shirt will be chosen
in a similar fashion.
"Not only is the T-shirt being de
signed by students," said Rao, "but
the winning T-shirt is being chosen
by students, since the shirt design
with the highest sales will be cho
sen."
The T-shirt is not meant simply to
increase Roosevelt's membership
numbers.
"The T-shirts will be very helpful

in recruitment efforts," Rao said.
"However, the Roosevelt Institu
tion is not a campus club that re
cruits in the generic sense. We're an
organization that offers students an
outlet to get their ideas heard and to
engage the policy process. These
shirts will promote visibility of that
opportunity around campuses
across the country."
Also, Rao said, the organization
is excited to promote the idea that
students "are capable of effecting
change from their campus."
"[This is] an idea that is often dis
counted by our visions of the job
market and our place as 'merely'
college students," he continued.
"Promoting that vision will be a key
element in the T-shirt."
The chosen shirt will remain the

organization's official T-shirt for the
long haul, as there is no concrete
time established for an update.
Every college student, whether a
member of the Roosevelt Institu
tion or not, will be invited to pur
chase the T-shirts once they are re
leased for sale on the Web site.
"Roosevelt has no exclusive
membership," Rao maintained.
"Any college student is as much a
member as any other. We hope stu
dents will wear the Roosevelt T-shirt
whether they are a campus organiz
er or [just] supportive of our vision."
Those interested in participating
in the contest and wanting to have
an idea of what message the organ
ization is looking for or to find out
what type of design has the most
chance of success will be disap

pointed.
"[Because we are] opening the
design of Roosevelt's T-shirt to stu
dents across the country, we have no
particular message we're pushing
for," Rao concluded.
"The beauty of the contest is the
innovation it provides and the host
of different ideas and visions creat
ed." he continued. "Part of Roo
sevelt's vision is the audaciousness
of our task — moving student ideas
into the national policy dialogue —
and so we hope the designs will he
both creative and fresh, reflective of
the organization."
