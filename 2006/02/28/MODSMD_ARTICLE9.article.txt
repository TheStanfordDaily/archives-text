## Mardi Gras comes to New Orleans Traditional parades, though delayed by storms, celebrated a rebuilding city 
### CAIN BURDEAU ASSOCIATED PRESS 
NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Tourists and locals stood
side-by-side — in some spots 6 to 8 feet deep — as two of
the Carnival season's biggest and glitziest parades rolled
through a city struggling to reclaim some of its famous
fun.
"It's very special," said Barbara Sykes, who flew in
from Irving, Texas, where she's been living since Hurri
cane Katrina. "It's part of my heart, my blood."
The prelude to Mardi Gras— or Fat Tuesday—
brought party-hungry crowds to New Orleans' tradition
al parade route Sunday, nearly six months after Katrina
flooded 80 percent of the city and dispersed more than
two-thirds of the population.
Mardi Gras "is just a symbol of the fact that New Or
leans is going to come back," said Stephanie Hall, 28, a
city resident. "New Orleans has always done what it
wants to do and it's gonna come back whether the coun
try wants it to or not."
A threat of thunderstorms Saturday prompted a one
day delay of the Krewe of Endymion's parade, which fol
lowed the Krewe of Bacchus through the Uptown neigh
borhood on Sunday night. Three smaller parades were
held in the afternoon.
Lori Caswell, 34, of Chesapeake, Va., said this is her
first time participating in the festivities and she was sur
prised by the number of people involved. "It's a blast,"
she yelled, above the screams of children seeking beads.
"It's like no other fun I've ever had."
Caswell's friend, Yvette Hairston, said she was glad
the parades drew so many people back to her hometown
because it's a sign that people are putting money back
into the economy.
"It's a sign there's life here," she said. "It's a rebirth."
The Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club, the predomi
nantly black organization that puts on one of Fat Tues
day's most beloved parades, was scheduled Monday to
hold its annual "Lundi Gras" party — the start of the cer
emonial arrival of make-believe monarchs Rex and the
king of Zulu by boat on the Mississippi River.
While some decried the city's plan to hold Mardi Gras cele
brations while tens of thousands of residents were displaced,

Ebony Jenkins, who lost her home, car and possessions in the
flood, was in a festive mood nonetheless.
"My take on it is: Let it roll," she said as she waited for
floats and masked riders to fill the street and shed a rain
of doubloons and beads on the throngs.
Celebrities in town for the long weekend included
musician Harry Connick Jr., actors Dan Aykroyd,
Michael Keaton and Jim Belushi,and CNN's Anderson
Cooper, who rode on a float.
Nearby. Mark Krasnoff and Monica Verdin sold
boudin _ a type of sausage mixed with rice, onions and
peppers _ to parade-goers.
"This is important to us. whether tourists come or
not," said Krasnoff. "Every parade brings out the locals
and lifts people's spirits. We can dance again."
Visitors are often estimated at more than 1 million for
Mardi Gras. Pat Kaschalk, a public school teacher in New
Orleans, said this crowd seemed a little thinner.
"It was actually possible to catch something this
year," she said. "We were able to get close to the floats

and make eye contact with the riders. Normally we
wouldn't be able to do that."
The party began Friday in the French Quarter, as the
streets filled with revelers, many in costumes — white
Elvis jumpsuits, sexy bustiers and T-shirts with obscene
slogans taking aim at government officials.
New Orleans native Martin Bordon, 56, a firefighter,
said he's never ridden in a Mardi Gras parade, but on
TUesday planned to don a costume and ride for the first
time.
"I'm rewarding myself for the episode, the Katrina
episode," he said. "I'm going to celebrate fully."
Ordinarily, most New Orleans residents skip the
French Quarter frenzy in favor of family celebrations
along the parade routes, but many said they changed
their minds after being exiled by Katrina.
Police officer Jonathan Carroll Jr., whose house took
8 feet of water, said: "Six months ago, when we were
pulling people out of the flood, I would have never be
lieved we'd be doing this now."
