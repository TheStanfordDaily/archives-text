oes California's deteriorating infrastruc-
Iture pose too great a risk to residents?
JGov. Arnold Schwarzenegger seems to
J think so. It's about time residents and
legislators did. too.
On Friday, Schwarzenegger cut through the state's
financial and political red tape by declaring a state of
emergency, hoping to speed up repairs on 24 levees
across the state. Skeptics claim that the governor is
merely attempting to terminate the environmental
considerations that would otherwise accompany infra
structure repairs. But Schwarzenegger contends that
the threat is real: "Our levees are very vulnerable," he
said. "They are only one big earthquake or major
storm away from a major Katrina-like disaster."
Facing so ominous a prediction, Californians may
wonder why they are so endangered by faulty levees.
How could the state's engineers design a system in
which the next "big one" could destroy the capital?
Enter a chorus of grumbling from the graves of the
creators of California's water systems. "It wasn't sup
posed to be this way." they would posthumously argue,
taking exception to the implication that their work was
either reckless or overly bold.
Catastrophes like the flooding of New Orleans
have clued citizens in to a harsh reality: they too may
fall vulnerable to an engineering failure in the wake of
a natural disaster. Unfortunately, though, there are
two reactions we haven't seen. Katrina has not encour
aged greater public understanding of the risks accom
panying civil engineering projects (funded with tax
dollars). It has also failed to provoke the public to par
ticipate by determining acceptable risk levels and re
quiring legislators to be responsible trustees of these
systems.

What's the result? Too many potential catastrophes
— like the possible repeat of a New Orleans-scale
flood in Sacramento.
Part of the problem is that modern risk-assessment
practices are largely unknown to citizens, who in turn
have little say in, or understanding of, many of the
projects confronting their local governments. While
average Americans generally have distorted views of
what is and is not risky to start with, their ignorance on
how the government and engineers weigh a develop
ment's risks and benefits introduces new risks, beyond
the scope of engineers.
Over the past decades, researchers have developed
increasingly sophisticated means to assess risks when
designing systems that need to withstand floods and
quakes. Using these method - much to the chagrin of
most MS&E 120 students are based on statistics and
probability - is far more systematic than a popular vote
in determining what category hurricane a town's lev
ees should withstand. Proponents claim that employ
ing them will produce a better outcome than basing
decisions on the whims of emotional citizens —
whether they like it or not. Though mathematical,
these methods are relatively simple.
One way to assess exposure to risk, well known to

those students using Stats 60 to appease that nagging
math GER, is to calculate the "expected value" of the
magnitude of a disaster, which means multiplying an
event's likelihood by the numerical measure of that
event's impact, and adding these values together.
As a fictional example, say we knew a rainstorm
was going to hit Stanford campus. There is a 45 per
cent chance of it dropping 1 inch of rain, a 45 percent
chance of 2 inches and a 10 percent chance of 3 inch
es. The "expected value" of the rainstorm destined to
hit Stanford will then be about 1.65 inches, or the sum
of 0.45*1 + 0.45*2 + 0.10*3. This knowledge would
help engineers decide how big a rainstorm and what
level of flooding they need to plan for when building
on campus.
Many engineers favor this method because it takes
into account the potential for catastrophe. Let's adapt
the previous example, assuming that instead of a 10
percent chance of a 3-inch rainstorm there was a 10
percent chance of a mind-boggling 6-inch rainstorm.
This would bring our expected value up to a magni
tude of about 1.95 inches, indicating that Stanford
should spend more time and effort fortifying vulnera
ble sites on campus to be prepared for a reasonably
likely disaster.
Not all common means of anticipating risks take
into account worst-case scenarios, however. Common
parlance for people who work in water engineering is
the notion of the "100-year flood." Many engineered
water systems, like levees, are built to withstand a hy
pothetical "100-year flood."
To determine what a river's 100-year flood is,scien
tists collect data on the highest flow measured on a
given river at any single time each year. Using this
data, they construct a probability distribution and de-

fine the 100-year flood as a flow rate that has a 1 per
cent chance of being reached in a given year. Likewise,
a 10-year flood corresponds to a flow rate with a 10
percent chance of being reached in a given year, and a
500-year flood is that which has a 0.2 percent chance of
being reached in a year.
However,since the 100-year flood is based on prob
ability rather than certainty, there is rarely exactly one
100-year flood every 100 years. In a real estate devel
oper's dream, the 100-year flood on,say, the American
River in Sacramento might not occur for 150 years,
keeping his profits from buildings in its floodplain
flowing uninterrupted. In the corresponding night
mare, a wet year could produce five 100-year floods,
leaving in its wake water-logged apartments and a trip
for our developer to bankruptcy court.
This method of assessing risk does not consider
how disastrous the consequences will be if, for exam
ple, the 100-year flood is exceeded.The 100-year flood
and the levees built to withstand it will be the same re
gardless of whether the 200-year flood is negligibly
bigger or gigantic enough to lay waste to the city.
Californians. take note: it is based on these calcula
tions that your dams are designed and levees are built.
Upon hearing this, Californians start to grumble.'if
these methods of assessing risk are so great," they de
mand, "then why did the Sacramento Area Flood Con
trol Agency, before Katrina,say Sacramento had only
one-third the flood protection of New Orleans? That's
not okay!"
It's like our deceased early 20th century water en
gineers posthumously lamented — this wasn't how it
was supposed to be.

\Can what happened in Orleans really happen hereP Or WiLL the sa\!e California yet againPl
