# To nap or not to nap? The secret to a good night's sleep

Tiger Woods once said that one of the best
things about his choice to leave Stanford for
the professional golf circuit was that he could
finally get enough sleep. With the numerous
activities available on campus, classes, week
end parties, and — of course —the Face
book. it's no wonder that 95 to 99 percent of
students rack up a substantial sleep debt. It's
somewhat worrisome, however, that some
one cites a career in professional sports as
more restful than life as a college students.
Why would Tiger say this of life at the
Farm? The answer lies in that all-nighter you
pulled yesterday.
"Inadequate sleep prevents the vast ma
jority of us from consistently achieving opti

mal waking alertness," says William Dement,
a preeminent authority on sleep and the lec
turer for "Sleep and Dreams." "Many people,
in fact, live their days in a kind of 'twilight
zone' of impaired alertness, and as a conse
quence they fail or only partially succeed in
work, study and relationships."
More scary facts about sleep deprivation:
it has a huge effect on things like focus, learn
ing, memory, creativity, motivation, coordi
nation. and mood. Continued sleep depriva
tion leads to an amassed sleep debt. If it's dif
ficult to stay awake during sedentary activi
ties like listening in class, watching TV, study
ing or reading, or if you struggle to wake in
the morning, you have a large sleep debt. It is
possible to be up to 20 hours "in debt" —
that's a lot of missed sleep. The real question
is what you can do to improve your habits.

Before improvements can be made, you
need to understand why you feel tired at cer
tain points of the day and wide awake at oth
ers. Your body's periods of waking and sleep
ing are run by your biological clock, which is
linked closely to the daily 24-hour light-dark
cycle. The reason you can't keep your eyes
open in Math 51 during the afternoon but are
wide awake when the O.C. comes on at 9 is
due to a process called clock-dependent
alerting (CDA).
CDA is basically your body's method of
forcing you to wake up and become active,
even with a large sleep debt. It's equivalent to
drinking two pots of coffee or taking a strong
stimulant. There are two bouts of clock-de
pendent alerting during the day: a weaker
alerting period directly after waking up in the
morning and a very strong alerting period in

the evening, beginning at around 3 to 5 pm
and lasting until 9 to 11 pm or later.
The problem occurs between the morning
and evening alerting periods, from 12 to 4
pm. At this point in your day, CDA stimula
tion dips to its lowest level. Without your bi
ological clock stimulating you to stay awake,
your huge sleep debt takes over and makes
you drowsy.There's actually no such thing as
"food coma" after lunch or any large meal
unless you're already severely sleep de
prived.
HOW TO IMPROVE
YOUR SLEEP HABITS
Determine your periods of clock-dependent
alerting. Knowing the times of day that you
are most alert is useful. During these times
you will be extremely attentive and produc

tive, even if you got very little sleep the night
before. To determine your personal produc
tivity hours, pay close attention to how sleepy
you feel throughout the day. Rate your tired
ness every hour or two from when you wake
to when you sleep on a scale from 1 (alert) to
5 (fighting to stay awake). Do this for a week;
a pattern will emerge. It may be a pain, but
the information that you gather about when
you're most efficient will last the rest of your
college and working career.
Determine the amount of sleep you need
Dement recommends that each person do
the following measurement at least once in
their lives to discover how much sleep they
personally need to function:
