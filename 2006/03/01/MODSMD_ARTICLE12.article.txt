# To nap or not to nap? The secret to a good night's sleep
## 
### LISA VERMILLION CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Tiger Woods once said that one of the best
things about his choice to leave Stanford for
the professional golf circuit was that he could
finally get enough sleep. With the numerous
activities available on campus, classes, week
end parties, and — of course —the Face
book. it's no wonder that 95 to 99 percent of
students rack up a substantial sleep debt. It's
somewhat worrisome, however, that some
one cites a career in professional sports as
more restful than life as a college students.
Why would Tiger say this of life at the
Farm? The answer lies in that all-nighter you
pulled yesterday.
"Inadequate sleep prevents the vast ma
jority of us from consistently achieving opti

mal waking alertness," says William Dement,
a preeminent authority on sleep and the lec
turer for "Sleep and Dreams." "Many people,
in fact, live their days in a kind of 'twilight
zone' of impaired alertness, and as a conse
quence they fail or only partially succeed in
work, study and relationships."
More scary facts about sleep deprivation:
it has a huge effect on things like focus, learn
ing, memory, creativity, motivation, coordi
nation. and mood. Continued sleep depriva
tion leads to an amassed sleep debt. If it's dif
ficult to stay awake during sedentary activi
ties like listening in class, watching TV, study
ing or reading, or if you struggle to wake in
the morning, you have a large sleep debt. It is
possible to be up to 20 hours "in debt" —
that's a lot of missed sleep. The real question
is what you can do to improve your habits.

Before improvements can be made, you
need to understand why you feel tired at cer
tain points of the day and wide awake at oth
ers. Your body's periods of waking and sleep
ing are run by your biological clock, which is
linked closely to the daily 24-hour light-dark
cycle. The reason you can't keep your eyes
open in Math 51 during the afternoon but are
wide awake when the O.C. comes on at 9 is
due to a process called clock-dependent
alerting (CDA).
CDA is basically your body's method of
forcing you to wake up and become active,
even with a large sleep debt. It's equivalent to
drinking two pots of coffee or taking a strong
stimulant. There are two bouts of clock-de
pendent alerting during the day: a weaker
alerting period directly after waking up in the
morning and a very strong alerting period in

the evening, beginning at around 3 to 5 pm
and lasting until 9 to 11 pm or later.
The problem occurs between the morning
and evening alerting periods, from 12 to 4
pm. At this point in your day, CDA stimula
tion dips to its lowest level. Without your bi
ological clock stimulating you to stay awake,
your huge sleep debt takes over and makes
you drowsy.There's actually no such thing as
"food coma" after lunch or any large meal
unless you're already severely sleep de
prived.
HOW TO IMPROVE
YOUR SLEEP HABITS
Determine your periods of clock-dependent
alerting. Knowing the times of day that you
are most alert is useful. During these times
you will be extremely attentive and produc

tive, even if you got very little sleep the night
before. To determine your personal produc
tivity hours, pay close attention to how sleepy
you feel throughout the day. Rate your tired
ness every hour or two from when you wake
to when you sleep on a scale from 1 (alert) to
5 (fighting to stay awake). Do this for a week;
a pattern will emerge. It may be a pain, but
the information that you gather about when
you're most efficient will last the rest of your
college and working career.
Determine the amount of sleep you need
Dement recommends that each person do
the following measurement at least once in
their lives to discover how much sleep they
personally need to function:
Pick a two-week period (prefer
ably over vacation when you won't be
tempted to break your schedule) and
decide what you think would be an
optimal amount of sleep for your
body. Choose a bedtime and consis
tently sleep at that time. If your sleepi
ness during the day decreases, you are
sleeping more than your optimal
amount. Conversely, if drowsiness
during the day increases, you aren't
sleeping enough. Adjust your amount
of sleep accordingly until your sleepi
ness during the day remains the same;
that's your optimal level of sleep.
Nap. It's not just for babies.
Because many of us don't get
enough sleep at night, naps can be an
excellent way to improve concentra
tion, alertness, creativity, and reaction
time during the day. Schedule your
naps during that 12 to 4 p.m. midday
dip in alertness. Don't postpone tak
ing a nap when you're tired. If it is de
layed until after the midday clock-de
pendent alerting begins, it will be dif
ficult to fall asleep and you'll waste
your time.
How long is the ideal nap? Fifteen
to 30 minutes.
"Long enough to reap the benefits
and restore some of the sleep debt
that we're all carrying, but short
enough so you don't go into delta, or
deep, sleep," says Dr. James Maas, a
Cornell University sleep researcher
and author of Power Sleep.
If you want something a little
longer to refresh yourself before fin
ishing a paper or problem set, sleep in
intervals of 90 minutes (ie: 3 hours, 4.5
hours, etc). This is the length of a full
sleep cycle. But be sure to time it care
fully.
"If we get into deep sleep, or REM
state, and then wake up before the
cycle's over, we feel like a truck hit us,"
says Dr. Pierce Howard, author of The
Owner's Manual fur The Brain. In ad
dition. he says, be careful that a longer
"nap" doesn't impede nighttime
sleep.
The conclusion? Napping is good.
Don't force yourself to stay awake if
you're extremely tired. Even if you
manage to stay conscious, you won't
be able to focus and will probably end
up doodling on your notebook be
cause everything your professor says
sounds like Charlie Brown's teacher.

COMMON SLEEP TROUBLES
Night-Owls. Of course, there are plen
ty of people who work all night and
sleep during the day, but it's generally
a bad idea. Sleep tendency is strongest
from 12 — 6 am in most people, so it
may be difficult for those who work at
night to stay awake. In addition, 60
percent of people who have chronic
difficulty sleeping are on "night shift"
schedules. Unless you're extremely
tired, it may be hard to fall asleep at
dawn after a night of problem-setting
because your biological clock will
stimulate you to wake when sunlight
streams in your window. So if you plan
on keeping your nocturnal schedule,
at least invest in good curtains.
Erratic sleep schedules. We all do it:
party or hang out until 4 a. m. on Fri
day and Saturday, sleep all day, and
then try to make it to our 9 a. m. on
Monday. Obviously this is a problem;
your body is too rested from sleeping
in on Sunday to adhere to an early
bedtime, but that leaves you tired on
Monday. In general, the more consis
tent you are with your sleeping habits,
including bedtime and naps, the bet
ter off you'll be.
Classes. Clock-dependent alerting is
often delayed in high school and col
lege-aged students in comparison to
older adults. Often, because some stu
dents don't begin feeling sleepy until 1
a. m.. 9 a. m. classes may not be the
best choice. Schedule your classes
based on when you're most awake
and avoid taking them during your
specific dip in alertness (see above on
how to determine both of these). And
when you go home for break, don't lis
ten to your parents when they tell you
to go to bed. Like you needed a rea
son.
Other factors detrimental to sleep.
Stress, anxiety or late-evening activity
causes levels of Cortisol hormones in
the body to rise. Sleep normally oc
curs when these hormones are at their
lowest levels of the day. So try to re
duce stress as much as possible, and
don't become one of those crazy 1
AM runners. Because then not only
won't you be able to sleep, but people
will make fun of you.
It's easy to overlook the fact that
sleeping is one of the most important
functions your body performs. Know
ing when you are at your best and how
to get the most out of your sleep is es
sential to a healthy and happy
lifestyle. Lucky for him. Tiger Woods
is not an expert on sleep. But he did
know that it was key to his success. So
go on, be a Tiger.
