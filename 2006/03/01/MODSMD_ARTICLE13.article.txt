## Editorial Advising must improve 
### 
Recently, the Undergraduate Advising
Program (UAP) and Undergraduate
Research Program (URP) an
nounced that they are coming together to
form a new entity. Despite disputes over
what the merged unit will he called, we trust
that the two programs will eventually settle
on a catchy name, preferably one with a
cutesy abbreviation. We also trust that the
programs will continue to take active steps to
improve the quality of advising and research
experiences for Stanford undergraduates.
Currently, there are several critical gaps in
Stanford's advising program that need to be
filled. As such, the UAP-URP merger pro
vides the Editorial Board with the opportuni
ty to articulate our expectations of how the
new organization should better serve the
needs of Stanford students.
First and foremost, all advisers need to
have some basic familiarity with Stanford ac
ademics. While advisers need not have an en
cyclopedic knowledge of the Stanford Bul
letin. they should at least be familiar with im
portant introductory classes such as Chem
istry 31, Math 51 and Economics 1.
In addition, advisers should emphasize the
importance of taking these classes early on in
one's Stanford career. Some sophomores al
ready deeply regret not having taken these
critical introductory courses in their fresh
man years. Poor advice can have huge impli
cations for a student's four-year plan or abili
ty to go abroad. The current system is insuffi
cient to address these issues.
The newly-merged unit also needs to match
the interests of freshman advisees to those of
their assigned advisers in a more systematic
fashion. We recognize that there is a tradeoff
between matching interests and ensuring that
each adviser does not have too many advisees.
However, we believe that assigning the right
adviser is significantly more important than
having smaller advising group sizes
To that end, there must be more flexibility
for students to choose their advisers. Students
are often stuck with an adviser that does not
know much about their field of interest. Con
sequently, they may be deprived of certain
opportunities that they are never alerted to.

The situation can be remedied in two ways.
First, advisers should talk in-depth with stu
dents about their interests, and recommend
other advisors who might be a better fit. Sec
ond, students should be able to switch advis
ers if they find another whose interests match
theirs more closely.
With a more flexible system, the merged
unit should then seek to strengthen the rela
tionship between advisers and students by
better encouraging honest communication
and frequent interaction. While it is impor
tant for advisers to allay the fears of their
freshman advisees, it is just as important for
advisers to underscore the need for early
planning. ITiey should not shy away from of
fering candid advice, instead of reassuring but
vacuous platitudes like "you'll be fine." They
should have in-depth conversations with their
advisees and provide frequent follow-ups on
their academic performance.
Last but not least, the new program must
strive to help students discover what their re
search interests, why conducting research is
important and what sort of research opportu
nities and resources are available. Stanford is
a prominent research institution, but advising
programs rarely emphasize research as an in
tegral part of a successful undergraduate ca
reer. Students differ in interests and abilities
to explore resources â€” while some students
come to Stanford with independent research
in mind, some do not even know where to
begin. Hopefully, the merger between UAP
and URP will seek to incorporate research
into the broader advising program.
Advising programs at Stanford have gen
erally been weak and inadequate; hopefully,
the merger between UAP and URP will ad
dress such shortcomings.
But even after the merger is complete, stu
dents need to play an active role in seeking in
formation and guidance. Programs like UAP
and URP are only there to assist peripherally;
as such, students should not rely entirely on
existing advising programs. Instead, we need
to take the initiative to discover our own aca
demic paths, learn how to pursue research op
portunities and forge meaningful undergrad
uate careers.
