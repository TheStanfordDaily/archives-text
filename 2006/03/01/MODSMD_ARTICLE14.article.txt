# I love the 90s
## 
### 
Every February, I must ask myself,"What
do you get the boy who wants noth
ing?" This is not a problem associated
with a certain love-centered, heart-themed
holiday but rather with my younger brother's
birthday — which seems to sneak up on us
each year without fail. My brother recently
turned 17, and of course my family and I found
ourselves, once again, in the position of having
nothing to buy him.
Unlike every other red-blooded American
teenager, my brother has virtually no interest
in music, movies or Playstation games. Gift
certificates don't cut it because he hates shop
ping, and clothes hold absolutely no appeal.
He doesn't even drive (he's even dreading
being forced to get his learner's permit) so
fuzzy dice and other car-related paraphernalia
are out too.
Given these challenges, my parents and I
collaborated this year to attack the problem
from a different angle. Instead of trying to find
gifts that are new and shiny and cutting-edge,
we looked to the past for inspiration.
Aladdin action figures and videos of old
cartoons like "Rocko's Modern Life," pro
cured from online auction sites like Ebay,
were among the highlights of my brother's
birthday presents this year. Not only was all of
this a lot cheaper than any of the gadgets he's
received in past years, but he's also having a lot
more fun reminiscing over his new toys. It
doesn't matter whether he watches the car
toons semi-ironically, or whether he genuine
ly enjoys them (though I'm pretty sure it's the
latter). Regardless, this just goes to show that
nostalgia is way underrated.
I could spout something saccharine about
how anyone can buy an iPod or an X-Box, but
heartfelt, sentimental gifts are worth so much
more. Wc don't need to reduce ourselves to
that level. It really just comes down to how we
all live a little bit in the past — the first step is
simply admitting it.
I can quote dialogue from select Sweet Val
ley High books, and I can sing the theme song
from the Babysitters ClubTV series. ITiere are
streamers on my bike handles and a Barbie
doll on my dorm room bookshelf. Mary-Kate
and Ashley Olsen are the most commonly re
curring actors in the movies that comprise my
DVD collection. And I 'm entirely proud of it.
Coming to college, many of us leave behind
our childhood bedrooms and all the kitsch
that goes with them. Boxes of toys are packed
up or given away to make room for books —
or worse yet — home gym equipment. So we
have to find a different way to hold on to those
last vestiges of childhood. There's a reason
that there are popular Facebook groups de
voted to Oregon Trail and the old-school
Nickelodeon classic "Salute Your Shorts."
We sit around watching "I Love the 90s"on
VHI and reflect on the good old days when
"Saved by the Bell" and the .Spice Girls were

everything that mattered. Sometimes we'll
adopt interests in childhood memorabilia that
we weren't even really into when it was con
temporary. I admit it: I'll launch enthusiasti
cally into a conversation about "Teenage Mu
tant Ninja Turtles" whenever prompted,
though I rarely watched the show when I was
a kid.
In anycase.it doesn't matter that those hal
cyon days of the 90s were really only six years
ago — we still have a right to our nostalgia.
Nearly everyone I know can gladly sing the
complete theme song of "Fresh Prince of Bel
Air." If you initiate the great Backstreet Boys
versus *NSYNC debate at any dining hall
table on campus, passions will ignite. The 90s
pop culture of our childhoods is our major
common ground.
The only way to cure a case of nostalgia is
to embrace it — and to be creative. Used book
stores always have classic adolescent paper
back series like "Boxcar Children" and
"Goosebumps,"and spending a half-hour rem
iniscing with your favorites is completely re
warding. Iliere are lots of old TV shows that
haven't made it to DVD, but videos are usually
easy to find on the Internet,often for only a few
dollars. Looking backward can be an excellent
source of inspiration when it comes to gift-buy
ing, but it's great to be a little selfish too.
Some adults may scoff that we're too
young to be nostalgic. And perhaps our long
ing for a not-so-distant age is actually typical
of each successive generation of college kids.
But with the wealth of information and media
now available on the Internet and DVDs, our
access to these collective memories is unparal
leled.
My brother can recite episode titles and
summaries for nearly every installment of the
"Aladdin" TV series that was spun off from
the movie, and since he now possesses videos
of the show, he's all the happier. ITiere once
was a time when I mocked him, but especially
since coming to college. I can embrace this pe
culiar passion completely (especially once I
realized that the actor who does the voice of
Aladdin also played D.J.'s cute boyfriend
Steve on "Full House.") So if you'll excuse me,
I have to turn to channel 52 — "Family Mat
ters" is about to start.

Every February, I must ask myself,"What
do you get the boy who wants noth
ing?" This is not a problem associated
with a certain love-centered, heart-themed
holiday but rather with my younger brother's
birthday — which seems to sneak up on us
each year without fail. My brother recently
turned 17, and of course my family and I found
ourselves, once again, in the position of having
nothing to buy him.
Unlike every other red-blooded American
teenager, my brother has virtually no interest
in music, movies or Playstation games. Gift
certificates don't cut it because he hates shop
ping, and clothes hold absolutely no appeal.
He doesn't even drive (he's even dreading
being forced to get his learner's permit) so
fuzzy dice and other car-related paraphernalia
are out too.
Given these challenges, my parents and I
collaborated this year to attack the problem
from a different angle. Instead of trying to find
gifts that are new and shiny and cutting-edge,
we looked to the past for inspiration.
Aladdin action figures and videos of old
cartoons like "Rocko's Modern Life," pro
cured from online auction sites like Ebay,
were among the highlights of my brother's
birthday presents this year. Not only was all of
this a lot cheaper than any of the gadgets he's
received in past years, but he's also having a lot
more fun reminiscing over his new toys. It
doesn't matter whether he watches the car
toons semi-ironically, or whether he genuine
ly enjoys them (though I'm pretty sure it's the
latter). Regardless, this just goes to show that
nostalgia is way underrated.
I could spout something saccharine about
how anyone can buy an iPod or an X-Box, but
heartfelt, sentimental gifts are worth so much
more. Wc don't need to reduce ourselves to
that level. It really just comes down to how we
all live a little bit in the past — the first step is
simply admitting it.
I can quote dialogue from select Sweet Val
ley High books, and I can sing the theme song
from the Babysitters ClubTV series. ITiere are
streamers on my bike handles and a Barbie
doll on my dorm room bookshelf. Mary-Kate
and Ashley Olsen are the most commonly re
curring actors in the movies that comprise my
DVD collection. And I 'm entirely proud of it.
Coming to college, many of us leave behind
our childhood bedrooms and all the kitsch
that goes with them. Boxes of toys are packed
up or given away to make room for books —
or worse yet — home gym equipment. So we
have to find a different way to hold on to those
last vestiges of childhood. There's a reason
that there are popular Facebook groups de
voted to Oregon Trail and the old-school
Nickelodeon classic "Salute Your Shorts."
We sit around watching "I Love the 90s"on
VHI and reflect on the good old days when
"Saved by the Bell" and the .Spice Girls were

everything that mattered. Sometimes we'll
adopt interests in childhood memorabilia that
we weren't even really into when it was con
temporary. I admit it: I'll launch enthusiasti
cally into a conversation about "Teenage Mu
tant Ninja Turtles" whenever prompted,
though I rarely watched the show when I was
a kid.
In anycase.it doesn't matter that those hal
cyon days of the 90s were really only six years
ago — we still have a right to our nostalgia.
Nearly everyone I know can gladly sing the
complete theme song of "Fresh Prince of Bel
Air." If you initiate the great Backstreet Boys
versus *NSYNC debate at any dining hall
table on campus, passions will ignite. The 90s
pop culture of our childhoods is our major
common ground.
The only way to cure a case of nostalgia is
to embrace it — and to be creative. Used book
stores always have classic adolescent paper
back series like "Boxcar Children" and
"Goosebumps,"and spending a half-hour rem
iniscing with your favorites is completely re
warding. Iliere are lots of old TV shows that
haven't made it to DVD, but videos are usually
easy to find on the Internet,often for only a few
dollars. Looking backward can be an excellent
source of inspiration when it comes to gift-buy
ing, but it's great to be a little selfish too.
Some adults may scoff that we're too
young to be nostalgic. And perhaps our long
ing for a not-so-distant age is actually typical
of each successive generation of college kids.
But with the wealth of information and media
now available on the Internet and DVDs, our
access to these collective memories is unparal
leled.
My brother can recite episode titles and
summaries for nearly every installment of the
"Aladdin" TV series that was spun off from
the movie, and since he now possesses videos
of the show, he's all the happier. ITiere once
was a time when I mocked him, but especially
since coming to college. I can embrace this pe
culiar passion completely (especially once I
realized that the actor who does the voice of
Aladdin also played D.J.'s cute boyfriend
Steve on "Full House.") So if you'll excuse me,
I have to turn to channel 52 — "Family Mat
ters" is about to start.
