# To the Stanford Review: Oh—it's on
## 
### 
It seems that my last column ("Long Live
Lightfoot? Are you Serious?" Feb. 22)
sparked a bit of a reaction from some
folks at The Stanford Review. Based on email
comments and Facebook messages that I've
received, some of them didn't particularly
agree with my analysis of their stance on the
use of American Indians as mascots. Others
agreed with my main points, but were disap
pointed by my suggestion that intelligent
Stanford students should stop reading the
publication, and that the paper should starts
single-spacing its content to save paper (al
though I framed the argument to say that
they would be creating less trash, the sugges
tion that the content itself is trash was never
made outright).
In a letter to the editor ("Respect the
memory of Lightfoot," Feb. 23), Executive
Editor Milton Solorzano, a junior, character
ized my assessment of his article ("Long live
Lightfoot," Feb. 17) as "a potpourri of at
tacks" that was "poorly strung together tit
for-tat." First off, let me declare that I proba
bly know much more about potpourri than
Mr. Solorzano, but I hardly see what a deli
cious mixture of dried flower petals with ex
otic herbs and spices has to do with anything.
And secondly, I would never do anything tit
for-tat. I'm just not that kind of guy.
Also, I was informed by junior "Disco"
Alex Medearis, Review editor emeritus, that
the paper does not double-space. Incidental
ly, he did not say that the publication is single
spaced, nor did he refute the trash argument
made in my previous column.
Granted, I'm not implying that The Daily
is a perfect paper either. As I recall, yester
day's front page declared: "Roosevelt holds
T-shirt design contest." I'm not a journalism
major, but I imagine that we can do better for
headlines and story topics — at least on the
front page.
But I digress.

What bothers me most about the feed
back that I received on the mascot debate is
that some people have argued that my vehe
ment objection to the use of American Indi
ans as mascots is somehow closed-minded.
The Stanford Review has repeatedly charac
terized the response of the Stanford Ameri
can Indian Organization (SAIO) as a "knee
jerk reaction" and suggested that the Ameri
can Indian community and the University
administration were acting without good rea
son in their confrontation of the recent use of
the Stanford Indian. I would like to submit
that the reaction of SAIO is hardly knee-jerk
— the Stanford policy banning the use of the
"Indian" caricature as a mascot has been in
place since 1972 and was implemented based
on sound reasons. Furthermore, given that
the actual policy is not up for debate, I hard
ly see why SAIO should be expected to re
view its stance merely because The Stanford
Review wants to remember Tinim Williams'
legacy as Prince Lightfoot.
As an aside, I should also clarify that I do
not speak directly on behalf of SAIO. How
ever, my personal feelings on the mascot
issue are hardly "knee-jerk" either — they
go back to the 1995 World Series between
the Cleveland Indians and the Atlanta
Braves when I was "tomahawk-chopped"
into alienation and marginalization as I
watched the traditions of my ancestors
clashing in an offensive display of racism and
ignorance.

I'm particularly disturbed by the claim
that I am being hypocritical and unprofes
sional by demanding tolerance in the realm
of the American Indian mascot debate and
then promoting intolerance by suggesting to
my readers that they stop reading ITie Re
view. I see no such hypocrisy or unprofes
sionalism.
In making a plea for inclusiveness, dignity
and respect, I cannot embrace a publication
that does not do the same.The Review is in
sensitive to its American Indian readers — if
it has any — and perpetuates an alienating
message by placing its focus on the memories
and traditions that have long been painful
and offensive to many members of the com
munity. The Review does not represent an in
tellectual diversity of perspectives; it offers a
one-sided conservative interpretation that is
not sensitive to the issue, readers or concepts
involved.
Finally, I don't sec how it is unprofession
al to discourage my readers from picking up
The Review. In fact, I feel that I have an obli
gation to speak out against the message of
the publication and its editorial staff. This
sort of thing is done all the time — take, for
example, the way that Dr. James Dobson of
Focus on the Family used his platform to dis
courage his readers and listeners from going
to Disneyland based on his personal convic
tions against the homosexual agenda exem
plified by the "Gay Days" celebrations. Like
wise, I have a conviction that also discour
ages support of publications that are hostile
to my interests or those of my readers.
For these reasons, I still encourage intelli
gent Stanford students to not read The Stan
ford Review. And to all others, I say go right
ahead. After all. compared to The Onion, it's
the next best thing.
