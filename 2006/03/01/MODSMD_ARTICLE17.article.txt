## Tree candidates continue battle Competitor reenacts Mario Kart at intersection of death 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
Morning showers did little to subdue
Tree Week yesterday, as a new candidate
made a bid for public prominence as the
others continued their campaigns.
From 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., sophomore
Adam "Schmoopy" Monroe sat on a
specially-constructed chair next to the
Claw in White Plaza. According to Mon
roe, the chair had roughly 3,034 nails
driven through the seat, armrests and ot
toman.

"It's good. It's a purification process,"
said Monroe, whose campaign had been
dormant since last week. "That's what
the focus is on. I wanted to do the student
body a favor by using purification to
heighten my senses. We're thinking more
of like a sixth, plus or minus one dimen
sion kind of a thing. They can come seek
advice from me."
Monroe sat through plunging morn
ing temperatures and driving rain bare
foot, wearing only shorts and a white T
shirt that read, "Sit on me." By noon, at
least five people had accepted the offer
— including one student who professed
to weigh more than 300 pounds. Monroe
claimed that he did not eat, drink or get

up once during the six-hour stunt.
"I've been fasting for a really long
time,so I don't have to go to the bath
room," he told The Daily. "But just in
case of emergencies I have a Snapple
bottle."
Senior Tommy Leep continued
his bid for Tree at noon with a Mario
Kart-themed stunt at the "intersec
tion of death" at Lausen Mall and Es
condido. Repeatedly chanting
"Tree," Leep supporters set up two
parallel lines of caution tape and
began to dump piles of banana peels
along with red and green painted vol
leyballs in the lane. First, a male stu
dent dressed up as Nintendo charac
ter Princess Peach, attempted the
course on a bicycle and finished in 7.4
seconds. Then Leep, dressed as Don
key Kong, appeared in a red Radio
Flyer wagon pushed by another stu
dent dressed as Mario.
As he hurtled through the obsta

cles, Leep lost control of the wagon
and crashed face first into the pave
ment. A student in a white golf cart,
imitating the Lakitu cloud-rescue
character from the game, picked
Leep up and towed him back to the
start. Leep attempted the course
again, but again was unsuccessful. He
crashed and was tackled into a pile of
banana peels by Princess Peach.
Meanwhile, sources report that
an undisclosed injury sidelined
sophomore Daniel N, the
managing editor of sports for The
Daily, from adding to his "Trees
Don't..." list. N refused to
confirm, deny or comment on the
origins of the injury, but reiterated
that he continues to abide by all his
restrictions — including sleeping
only in White Plaza, not changing

and not talking the entire week, ex
cept about Tree.
N promised to return
fully recuperated tomorrow at
lunchtime, for what he would de
scribe only as a "stunt based on one
of the most profoundly influential
movies of our time."
