## Late Nite sees changes 
### CHRISTIAN TOM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While many students maintain that
the greasy variety of chicken tenders and
cheese sticks at Late Nite are "crazy-de
licious," some have complained about
the lack of healthy options at Stanford's
two late-night dining options — the
Stern Cyber Cafe and Lakeside Late
Nite.
Others argue that healthier food
would attract more patronage to these
venues.
"1 know if there were healthier op
tions," said senior Jenny Cohen,"! would
go [to Late Nite] more."
Indeed, some students have sought
out less grease in favor of more greens.
"I always get the Caesar salad," said
freshman Liz Buck.
Late Nite's healthy choices include
yogurt, sushi and salads. According to its
Web site, Lakeside Late Nite also fea
tures "fresh organic salads and fruit."
Even healthy options exist, however,
their supply is often quickly exhausted.
"There is sushi at Late Nite," re
marked sophomore Karen Chiao."But it

sells out really quickly."
Students such as Chiao and Cohen
have also voiced requests for more fresh
juices and yogurt parfaits. Other stu
dents have proposed hummus and pita
bread as examples of healthy midnight
snacks, both of which could fulfill crav
ings.
But often, students are satiated best
by the classic — albeit unhealthy — late
night junk foods.
"When I come to Late Nite," ex
plained junior KiYonna Carr. "I just
want grease."
Senior Meena Harris, who does not
go to Late Nite often, said that if she did.
she'd "just get fries and chicken tenders."
Others said they relish the unhealthy.
Asked if she would go to Late Nite
more often if it offered healthier choices,
freshman Meg Lunde responded, "Hell
no!"
Her unequivocal response says some
thing about students' expectations about
Late Nite and the atmosphere it repre
sents.
"Late Nite is like the local diner,"said
one patron. "You go there to eat food
and hang out with your friends. It's
because of this place I have no more
points on my meal plan!"
In the wee hours of the morning,
meal plan points are burned on a va
riety of guilty pleasures.
"I'm all for healthier food," said
junior Claire Woods. "But not in the
middle of the night."
Other health-conscious proposals
include the posting of calorie-counts
or ingredients for the products of
fered.
"It would be good for us to know,"
said freshman Julie Faller.
Ultimately.it seems most students
would prefer healthier options, but
nevertheless choose what tastes
good.
"I usually get the cheese steak,"
said freshman Ranee Graham-Bai
ley, a frequent patron of the Lakeside
venue. "It's a sandwich stuffed so big

it doesn't even close."
In the past year, minor changes
have been made to Late Nite in an ef
fort to accommodate student re
quests.
According to Catering and Exec
utive Services Senior Associate Di
rector Eric Montell, students have
been requesting healthier options
more frequently.
"Over the years we have changed
the menu based on increased requests
which featured expanded salads, low
caloric entrees and what is perceived
by most as healthy options," Montell
said. "We currently offer a number of
healthy choices that students current
ly purchase including sushi, whole
fruit,salads,sandwiches, juices and en
trees. We serve trans-fat-free fries and
we cook in rice bran oil which is trans
fat-free also."
Improvements to Late Nite serv
ices also include the extension of
business hours to weekends.
"We have seen a recent trend in
increased late night meal participa
tion over the past year as students are
staying up and eating later seven
days per week." Montell said.
