## Univ. steps closer to demolition of dishes NASA proposes program to bring observatory back to use 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
The Dish, Stanford's popular hiking destina
tion, may stand alone in the near future, as the
final roadblock to the University's plan to de
stroy the surrounding smaller dishes has been
cleared.
Yesterday evening, opponents to Stanford's
proposal to demolish five 60-foot dishes sur
rounding the campus landmark suffered a loss
in their year-long struggle to save the more
minor radio telescopes. The Santa Clary Coun
ty Board of Supervisors denied the appeal of
Stanford's requested building permit to contin
ue with the demolition of the dishes — once
part of the Bracewell Observatory.
I"he University initiated its plan for the dem
olition in early 2(X)5, when the fire marshal or
dered the removal of the diy brush surrounding
the site. Dean of the Engineering School Jim
Plummer ordered that the dishes be removed
after concluding that the defunct observatory
was of no use to the University.
Tuesday's hearing came after an organization
called Friends of the Bracewell Observatory As
sociation (FBOA) appealed to the Land Use
Committee, hoping it would order further public
hearings or deny the issuance of the permit.
Bob Lash, head of the FBOA, argued that
the Bracewell Observatory is an important his
toric site.
"The Observatory was founded in the 1950s
by Electrical Engineering Prof. Ronald
Bracewell," Lash said. l, lt is the birthplace of
medical-scan imaging technology, which be
came the basis for CP scan and MRI machines.
It is one of the most important developments in
the history of medicine."
NASA has also made use of the observatory
in the past to aid in the detection of lethal radi
ation from solar flares, ensuring that the Apollo
astronauts could complete their moonwalks
safely.
Lash has received confirmation that the Cal
ifornia Office of Historic Preservation is work
ing to schedule a hearing on Aug. 4 to consider
the nomination of the Bracewell Observatory
to the California Register of Historical Re
sources. If the site is listed in the register it will
become an historic landmark under California
law — and could therefore not be demolished.
The observatory has been abandoned since
the mid-19905, when it was used by Stanford In
structional Television. According to earlier
statements made by Chris Carter, director of

the Stanford University Land Use and Environ
mental Office, the University conducted a year
long review that concluded there was no aca
demic use for the site.
Lash disagrees. Last Friday his group pub
lished an open letter in the Palo Alto Daily
News that named 10 professors who had pro
posals for using the observatory for astronomy
and engineering-related activities. He also re
vealed that NASA's Jet Propulsion Labs (J PL)
have approached Stanford with a proposal to
bring the facilities back into operation at little
cost to the University.
J PL's proposal envisions four groups using
the site. And J PL's outreach program could pro
vide radio-astronomy access to thousands of
high school students across the country. Stan
ford faculty and students would be able to use
the facility for "projects on mechanical systems,
wide-band, low-noise amplifiers, radio and in
frared frequency circuits and radio-astronomy
research." J PL itself would use the observatory
to test new designs for the Deep Space Net
work. an international network of antennas
similar to those at Bracewell Observatory.

Lash asserted that restoring the observatory
to working condition would not be expensive.
" ITie original Stanford crew that designed
and built the array are now professors at Har
vard," he said. ' Iliey did an inspection and
found that they are all structurally sound and
that all the parts are intact. And it's all a matter
of cleaning everything up. Even the cables that
connect the dishes are intact."
Stanford has not responded to J PL's propos
al. I lowever, two previous proposals made by
the FBOA were cleared by the Physics Depart
ment. but later rejected by the School of Hu
manities and Sciences for unknown reasons.
With the denial of the appeal, Stanford can
now proceed with the demolition at any time.
But Lash has requested that the University
wait.
"We're calling upon Stanford," Lash said,"to
officially sanction collaboration between
NASA's J PL and Stanford faculty in developing
a final proposal with JPL. We're asking Stanford
to wait on demolition until the state of Califor
nia has had the opportunity to rule on its histor
ical status."

Popular hiking area for the Stanford community is also home to satellite dishes that line the path.
These dishes could be added to the California Register of Historical Resources in Auaust.
