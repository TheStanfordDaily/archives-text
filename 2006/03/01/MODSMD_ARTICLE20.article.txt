## Entering the Pac-10 Championships ranked No. 1, it's time for men's swimming to... SINK OR SWIM Swimmers look to continue diving's great start 
### KATHERINE BELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Die members of the top-ranked men's swimming team
know they've got something special — and it's not just a No. 1
ranking.
Hie team has a tremendous legacy, having taken the Pac-10
Conference title the past 24 years under the leadership of
head coach Skip Kenney. When the Cardinal head to Federal
Way. Wash, this weekend for the conference championships.

they will be aiming to
win their 25th straight
title and extend one of
the most impressive
winning streaks in
NCAA history.
The team's No. 1
ranking does not guar
antee, however, that the
men will walk away with
the title. The Pac-10 is
often considered the na
tion's most competitive
conference, and the
Card will come face-to
face again with No. 3
California, No. 4 South
ern California, and N0.6
Arizona — all of whom
will be hungry to end
Stanford's 24-year
streak. No team will
enter the meet unde
feated, including the
Cardinal, who lost to
USC in January. But
after drowning the then-

top-ranked Bears two weeks ago, the men are confident that
they can bring home title number 25.
if this season's championships prove to be anything like last
year's. Stanford will have multiple individual and relay wins. Se
nior Tobias Oriwol will attempt to go out with a bang in the 2(X)
individual medley, which he captured in last year's meet, while
junior I longzhe Sun will try to defend his title in the 2(H) back
stroke. Sun is currently ranked first in the Pac-10 and third in
the nation in the 2(H) backstroke.
Also defending individual titles are juniors Andy Grant in
the 200 free and Shaun Chuy Phillips in the 1650 free. Phillips
enters the Pac-10 meet coming off promising swims against Cal
two weeks ago, where he smashed school and pool records as
old as him in the l(MK) yard free.
Junior captain Ben Wildman-Tobriner, a key player in last
year's three relay victories, is the nation's top returning 50
freestyler. Wildman-Tobriner is eager to pursue his own indi
vidual titles in the sprint freestyles, but it is the relays that he
finds most exhilarating.
"I'm excited for the relays," he said. " They all should be
closely fought battles."
The five relays, which emphasize team over individual per
formances, often determine the winner of the meet, since relay
points are worth twice as much as individual points. Cal, USC
and Arizona have all had relays that out-performed Stanford's
in dual meets, but the Cardinal will not let this fact deter their
confidence.
While the team's veterans will be counted for scoring points
and leadership, it's often the freshmen provide the element of

surprise at Pac-lOs with breakthrough swims.
"I am really looking forward to watching our freshmen
race," Wildman-Tobriner said. "There are always a few fresh
men who really surprise themselves, and there is nothing more
fun to watch."
Freshmen expected to make a big impact for the Cardinal
are sprinter Jason Dunford, breaststroker Paul Kornfeld and
backstroker Nate Cass. And in such a competitive meet, the
freshmen will be expected to contribute as much to the team ef
fort as their more experienced team members.
Freshman diver Dwight Dumais did just that this past week
end. propelling his team ahead of its fiercest competitors in the
Pac-10 Diving Championships, which also took place in Feder
al Way. Dumais placed second in the 3-meter, second in the 1-

meter and third in platform.
Each diving event is scored as an individual swimming event,
and these events often make or break a meet. For instance, the
Cardinal swimmers outscored NCAA champion Auburn last
year in the swimming events, but finished second due to
Auburn's stronger diving team.
Going in with a significant point advantage thanks to Du
mais,the Cardinal swimmers plan to carry this momentum and
qualify more men for the NCAA championship, which will take
place in three weeks. Wildman-Tobriner thinks that the upcom
ing Pac-10 meet will come down, once again, to either the Car
dinal or archrival Cal.
"Both Cal and Stanford want to win. but obviously only one
can." he said. "It's as simple and exciting as that."

"I'm looking forward
to watching our
freshmen race. There
are always a few who
surprise themselves,
and there is nothing
more fun to watch."
