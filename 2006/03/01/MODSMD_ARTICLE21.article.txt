### BEN BACKES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After an eight-hour rain delay,
Stanford and Baylor finally met in
San Francisco late Monday night.
And considering that Baylor has now
won the teams' last six meetings,
Stanford might have been better had
it kept on pouring.
In a battle of top-10 teams. No. 9
Baylor (7-3) easily handed No. 6
Stanford (6-1) its first loss of the sea
son, 5-1.
The weekend wasn't all bad
though, as the Card shut out an over
matched BYU squad two days earlier.
Against Baylor, senior captain
KC Corkery's absence plagued the
Cardinal. Head coach John
Whitlinger said Corkery, Stanford's
top singles and doubles player, expe
rienced a flare-up of an injury after
the BYU match that knocked him
out of the Baylor contest.
"[lt] was a shame," Whitlinger
said. "We've been able to survive be
fore, but Baylor is a tough team."
With Corkery out. Stanford's
players all moved up one position to

fill the gap. Playing at No. 1. junior
James Pade was given the task of
playing against Lars Poerschke, the
fourth-ranked singles player in the
country. After a close first set which
ended in a tiebreaker victory for Po
erschke, Pade also dropped the sec
ond set to lose the match, 7-6.6-4.
Freshman Matt Bruch. playing at
the No. 2 singles position, also lost in
a tightly contested match. After split
ting the first two sets with No. 56
Matija Zgaga, the match went to 5-5
in the third set before Zgaga pre
vailed, 6-3,3-6. 7-5.
Whitlinger was happy with how
his team played and though that the
match could have been a lot closer.
"As I reflect on it. we were close
and some matches you get those
breaks," he said. "I thought that the
effort was there and guys were ready
to play. We just couldn't get the
tiebreaker to get the momentum and
they just seemed to have answer for
us last night."
Stanford's lone point came when
sophomore Phil Kao beat Vladimir
Portnov, 4-6,6-0,6-3, at the No. 5 sin
gles position. With the victory, Kao in
creased his dual-match winning
streak to four.

Junior James Pade played No. 1 against Baylor, losing
the match 7-6, 6-4. He did garner a victory against
BYU on Saturday at No. 2, however, 6-2, 6-3.
"That's a great win for him for
confidence reasons," Whitlinger
said."l'm really proud of the effort."
Junior James Wan suffered his
first loss of the season, losing to Will
Ward at the No. 3 singles spot, 6-3.7-
6. It was Ward's sixth consecutive
win.
Freshman Blake Muller and sen
ior Jon Wong also lost in straight
sets. Muller lost to No. 53 Michal
Kokta (7-6, 6-2) and Wong to Matt
Brown (6-3,6-2).
After beginning the season with
a 2-3 record. Baylor has won five
consecutive matches, including a
victory against No. 16 California on
Sunday. Since 1999, the Cardinal are
0-6 against Baylor.
Originally scheduled for 1 p.m. at
theTaube Family Tennis Center, the
match was played at 9 p.m. at the San
Francisco Tennis Club when rainy
conditions on the Farm prevented
the match from being played out
doors.
Although Stanford was defeat
ed. the coaches and players appreci
ated the opportunity to play in front
of the fans who made the trip to San
Francisco.
"I was really impressed and
happy with the student support and
our fans," Whitlinger said."We had a
good group of people up there and it
was very much appreciated. Unfor
tunately we didn't pull it off for

them, but it always helps."
Due to time constraints caused
by the late start. Stanford and Bay
lor did not play doubles matches.
Meanwhile, Stanford used three
new doubles combinations against
BYU to help propel it to its first
sweep of the season. First to finish
were Corkery and Bruch, who de
feated Jose Lechuga and James
Ludlow 8-3 at the No. 1 doubles po
sition.
The Cardinal clinched the dou
bles point when Pade and Muller
cruised past Christian Hand and
Jonathon Sanchez 8-2 at the No. 2
spot. Although Pade and Corkery
were the No. 11 doubles team in the
country, the Cardinal coaching staff
decided to mix up the lineup by
splitting up the pair.
"We were 1 -4 at No. 2 doubles and
2-3 at No. 3 doubles and 1 felt like
[changing the lineup] was worth a
shot," Whitlinger said. "1 told the
guys early in the season it was some
thing we were thinking of doing. 1
talked to the guys and felt it was a
good time to do it and after watch
ing yesterday it was a good decision.
I liked what I saw and we'll keep ex
perimenting with options."
Wong and Wan won their dou
bles match 8-5 over Dominik
Kaufhold and Ivan Kokurin to earn
Stanford its first doubles sweep of
the season.

"James and Jon did a good job at
No. 3." Whitlinger said. "We won all
the doubles, and we haven't done
that too often."
Stanford continued its singles
dominance, especially at the top of
the lineup. Pade, Bruch and Wan all
won their singles matches in straight
sets.
Pade, who entered the national
singles rankings at No. 89 last week,
beat Dominik Kaufhold (6-2,6-3) at
the No. 2 spot. Bruch. the tenth
ranked player in the country, dis
patched Hand (6-3,6-4) to earn his
second dual match victory after re
turning from injury.
Wan beat Ivan Kokurin (6-0, 6-
3). The junior is now 49-10 in dual
match play.
After struggling to open the sea
son, Kao has found his groove, beat
ing Jonathan Sanchez 6-3,6-1.
Muller also won his singles
match, beating Lechuga at the No. 5
spot (6-2.6-7,1-0).
This weekend Stanford will play
in the Pacific Coast Doubles tourna
ment in La Jolla, Calif. Corkery's un
certain health status might force
Whitlinger to be creative when he
pencils in his lineup.
"We will have four doubles
teams down there." Whitlinger said.
"What they are is still up in the air. I
have some ideas of teams I'd like to
play."
