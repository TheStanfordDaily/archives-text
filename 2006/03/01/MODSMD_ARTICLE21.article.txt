### BEN BACKES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After an eight-hour rain delay,
Stanford and Baylor finally met in
San Francisco late Monday night.
And considering that Baylor has now
won the teams' last six meetings,
Stanford might have been better had
it kept on pouring.
In a battle of top-10 teams. No. 9
Baylor (7-3) easily handed No. 6
Stanford (6-1) its first loss of the sea
son, 5-1.
The weekend wasn't all bad
though, as the Card shut out an over
matched BYU squad two days earlier.
Against Baylor, senior captain
KC Corkery's absence plagued the
Cardinal. Head coach John
Whitlinger said Corkery, Stanford's
top singles and doubles player, expe
rienced a flare-up of an injury after
the BYU match that knocked him
out of the Baylor contest.
"[lt] was a shame," Whitlinger
said. "We've been able to survive be
fore, but Baylor is a tough team."
With Corkery out. Stanford's
players all moved up one position to

fill the gap. Playing at No. 1. junior
James Pade was given the task of
playing against Lars Poerschke, the
fourth-ranked singles player in the
country. After a close first set which
ended in a tiebreaker victory for Po
erschke, Pade also dropped the sec
ond set to lose the match, 7-6.6-4.
Freshman Matt Bruch. playing at
the No. 2 singles position, also lost in
a tightly contested match. After split
ting the first two sets with No. 56
Matija Zgaga, the match went to 5-5
in the third set before Zgaga pre
vailed, 6-3,3-6. 7-5.
Whitlinger was happy with how
his team played and though that the
match could have been a lot closer.
"As I reflect on it. we were close
and some matches you get those
breaks," he said. "I thought that the
effort was there and guys were ready
to play. We just couldn't get the
tiebreaker to get the momentum and
they just seemed to have answer for
us last night."
Stanford's lone point came when
sophomore Phil Kao beat Vladimir
Portnov, 4-6,6-0,6-3, at the No. 5 sin
gles position. With the victory, Kao in
creased his dual-match winning
streak to four.
