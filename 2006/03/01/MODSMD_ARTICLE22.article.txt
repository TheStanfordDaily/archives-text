## Three wrestlers go on to NCAAs Cardinal's disappointment tempered by individual triumph 
### DENIS GRIFFIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
IT»e Stanford wrestlers faced the most important test
of their season in the Pac-10 tournament on Sunday and
Monday in Maples Pavilion. And while the Cardinal
came away disappointed with their overall perform
ance. there were a couple of notable positives for the
young team, as senior captain Ray Blake and sopho
more captain Tanner Gardner both advanced to the na
tional tournament in Oklahoma City. Okla., three
weeks from now.
"Overall, obviously we would have liked to have
qualified more and placed more," head coach Kerry
McCoy said. "We had a couple of mistakes, we got
caught in a couple of positions, but we also had some
guys that came out and did it."
Stanford finished seventh as a team in the competi
tion with a total score of 54.5 team points. Meanwhile.
Arizona State narrowly edged Cal Poly for the team
title by a 118 -115.5 margin.The Sun Devils' win con
tinues their streak of Pac-10 dominance, as they took
home the conference championship for the fourth
time in six years.
"We did alright considering our circumstances,"
Gardner said, 'i thought everybody wrestled
hard even though everything didn't turn out
the way we wanted it to. But I thought overall
we competed well as a team."
'ITiose circumstances hit the Cardinal hard
before their first match even began, as top
seeded sophomore Josh Zupancic failed to
make weight at 149-pounds and was forced to
sit out the tournament. Zupancic. the second
ranked wrestler in the league, had earned a 22-
4 record over the course of the season. His ab
sence meant that Stanford was short one
wrestler for the duration of the tournament.
"Basically what we told the guys is he's not
here so we can't worry about it," McCoy said in
reference to Zupancic's exclusion from the
tournament. "The strength of this program is
the team aspect, and they were able to pick
each other up."
As the only two Stanford wrestlers to quali
fy for the NCAA tournament, Gardner took
second and Blake third. Gardner went unde
feated until he met Chad Mendes of Cal Poly in
the championship match. Gardner came out
aggressively in the first period, but when time
expired on the period he was down 2-0. He was
never able to come back, as Mendes went on to
win 7-4. denying Gardner a first place finish.
"It's kind of frustrating," Gardner said. "I
think I was a little bit over-aggressive early in
the match — things just didn't really go my
way. In the third period I had him tired. I had
him on the ropes with a chance to win. but 1 just
couldn't quite convert. It's something to work
for. because I'll probably see him again in three
weeks at nationals."
The second-seeded Blake, on the other
hand, was forced to come back from an earlier
defeat to earn his third place finish and a spot in
the NCAA tournament. Having lost 4-1 to
third-seeded Patrick Pitsch of Arizona State in
the championship semifinals. Blake defeated
top-seeded Joey Bracamonte of Oregon 17-5
and Johnny Nunez of Boise State 18-2 to earn
his trip to Oklahoma City.
Two other wrestlers placed for the Cardi
nal as sophomore Scott Loescher notched a
fourth place finish at 157-pounds and redshirt

freshman Luke Feist secured fifth place at
174-pounds. With the top three placers ad
vancing to the NCAA Tournament in each
weight class, and nine additional wildcard se
lections, Loescher barely missed advancing to
the national tournament as he lost 7-2 against
third-seeded and No. 16 ranked Tony Hook of
Oregon State in the consolation champi
onship.
"We told [Scott] that you want to leave

your fate in your hands by taking third. But
taking fourth, we thought that maybe we
could argue a little bit." McCoy said."But guys
did real well the entire tournament, so there
were a few guys that got left out. But that's
why it's a wild card."
Meanwhile, Luke Feist closed out an im
pressive first year of competition with an early
pin of Oregon's Chet Mcßee at 2:02 to secure
fifth place. It was an up-and-down tournament

for Feist, who lost two matches, but also had
two pins en route to his fifth place finish.
"It was nice to close out the tournament
with a place in my last match," Feist said, 'i
wrestled really well in my last match which
should give me some momentum heading into
next year, hopefully."
Gardner and Blake will travel to Oklahoma
City to represent the Cardinal in the NCAA
Tournament beginning March 16.
