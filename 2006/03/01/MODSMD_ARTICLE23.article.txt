# Leave Bode alone
## 
### 
As the world turned its atten
tion to the 2006 Winter
Olympic Games in Torino,
the expectations placed upon Bode
Miller were higher than those placed
upon any other US athlete. He was
the lone hope for US Alpine skiing —
the one man wearing the red, white
and blue who had shown that he
could consistently win at the interna
tional level. Not only that, but Bode
had drawn attention to himself by
going on "60 Minutes" and claiming
that after clinching the overall World
Cup Title, he skied the next day not
only hung-over. but still drunk from a
night of celebration.
So when Bode failed to medal in
the five events he entered in Torino,
the national media went off. They
claimed Bode was irresponsible. He
was out of shape. He wasn't trying his
hardest. He let America down. He
was an embarrassment.
Never before had I seen an
Olympian get hammered the way
Bode did. He didn't do steroids, he
didn't mouth off, he didn't hurt any
one — he simply didn't win.
Yet despite the sharp and inces
sant criticism. Bode seemed perfectly
content with how his Olympics went.
He didn't pout or moan or feel bad for
himself. Instead he said the Olympic
experience is what the whole thing is
about anyway, not just the results.
"The expectations were other
people's," Bode said in an interview
with the AP following his final race.
"I'm comfortable with what I've ac
complished, including at the
Olympics. I came in here to race as
hard as I could. TTiat was my obliga
tion to myself."
Instead of feeling sympathy for the
guy or having admiration for a person
who despite some tough breaks was
still emotionally strong, the national
press saw Bode's performance as an
outrage. They didn't seem to under
stand how a skier with so much talent
and with such a high ceiling could be
happy when his best finish was fifth
place. It may be hard for many sports
fans to appreciate, but in the
Olympics, winning isn't everything.
Sure, it is easy to get caught up in
medal counts — but talk to nearly
any Olympic athlete and they will tell
you that the experience is as impor
tant as the results.
There is no doubt that Bode is
one of the best skiers in the world.
That was made clear when he won
two medals in Salt Lake City four
years ago and when he won the over
all World Cup title during the 2004-
2005 season. But just like in all other
sports, in skiing, the best athlete
doesn't always win. There are so
many external factors in a sport like
skiing that play a role in the outcome
of the event. Bode was inches away
from winning the alpine combined
event, but he hooked a gate. He
caught an edge in the Super G and
didn't finish. That's the nature of the
beast — if Bode didn't push himself,
he wouldn't be so good. He certainly
wouldn't be the kind of skier that he
is, and he probably wouldn't make
the mistakes that people are riding
him so hard for.
In his book "Go Fast, Be Good,
Have Fun." Bode claims that his goal
is not to win medals, but go "as fast as
the natural universe will allow." That
is who Bode is, and sometimes the de
sire to achieve speeds above and be
yond comparison comes at a price.
And that's what we saw at these
Olympic Games.
So why do people get so angry at
Bode for pushing to win, and failing?

Yet he wasn't accused of not trying,

Bode is a presence — he has an
attitude and he puts himself out
there, all things that likely turn some
people off. Yet, in nearly every sport
outside of the Olympics, individuali
ty is valued as much as talent. Look
at some of our greatest and most
adored athletes.

popular athlete in the world.
Mohammed Ali is probably the
best example of personality and
sports being appreciated. Ali put him
self out there even more than Miller,
yet today we look back at that as a
positive trait. It was that individuality
and indifference to popular opinion
that made him so interesting and fun
to watch.
Yet today the same people who
love the Ali's and the Jordan's, not only
for their talent, but also for their ability
to be the best while remaining individ
uals, are frying Bode. Maybe people
are turned off by his Nike sponsorship,
his brash website (joinbode.com), the
fact he had his own RV at the Games or
his non-traditional attitude. But it is un
fair to demonize Miller for a bad two
week stretch.
Next time you see Brett Favre
throw an interception while trying to
make a crazy play happen, or Allen
I verson turn the ball over while weav
ing his way through five defenders,
think of poor Bode and the unfair
criticism he received.
Despite the drubbing he took in
the press and the struggles on the
slopes, I can take solace in the fact
that Bode is just going to keep on
doing his thing.
"I just did it my way," Bode said.
"I'm not a martyr, and I'm not a do
gooder. I just want to go out and
rock."

Sure, it is easy to get caught up in
medal counts — but talk to nearly
any Olympic athlete and they will tell
you that the experience is as impor
tant as the results.
There is no doubt that Bode is
one of the best skiers in the world.
That was made clear when he won
two medals in Salt Lake City four
years ago and when he won the over
all World Cup title during the 2004-
2005 season. But just like in all other
sports, in skiing, the best athlete
doesn't always win. There are so
many external factors in a sport like
skiing that play a role in the outcome
of the event. Bode was inches away
from winning the alpine combined
event, but he hooked a gate. He
caught an edge in the Super G and
didn't finish. That's the nature of the
beast — if Bode didn't push himself,
he wouldn't be so good. He certainly
wouldn't be the kind of skier that he
is, and he probably wouldn't make
the mistakes that people are riding
him so hard for.
In his book "Go Fast, Be Good,
Have Fun." Bode claims that his goal
is not to win medals, but go "as fast as
the natural universe will allow." That
is who Bode is, and sometimes the de
sire to achieve speeds above and be
yond comparison comes at a price.
And that's what we saw at these
Olympic Games.
So why do people get so angry at
Bode for pushing to win, and failing?
TTie best slalom skier in the world,
Giorgia Rocca of Italy, fell in the first
15 seconds of his first run in the event.
Yet he wasn't accused of not trying,
not being prepared or embarrassing
his country.
Bode is a presence — he has an
attitude and he puts himself out
there, all things that likely turn some
people off. Yet, in nearly every sport
outside of the Olympics, individuali
ty is valued as much as talent. Look
at some of our greatest and most
adored athletes.
Michael Jordan played with a flair
that made him not only the best bas
ketball player ever, but the most fun
to watch. He took care of his business
and did it very well. But his individu
ality and ability to add a personal
touch to his game made him the most

popular athlete in the world.
Mohammed Ali is probably the
best example of personality and
sports being appreciated. Ali put him
self out there even more than Miller,
yet today we look back at that as a
positive trait. It was that individuality
and indifference to popular opinion
that made him so interesting and fun
to watch.
Yet today the same people who
love the Ali's and the Jordan's, not only
for their talent, but also for their ability
to be the best while remaining individ
uals, are frying Bode. Maybe people
are turned off by his Nike sponsorship,
his brash website (joinbode.com), the
fact he had his own RV at the Games or
his non-traditional attitude. But it is un
fair to demonize Miller for a bad two
week stretch.
Next time you see Brett Favre
throw an interception while trying to
make a crazy play happen, or Allen
I verson turn the ball over while weav
ing his way through five defenders,
think of poor Bode and the unfair
criticism he received.
Despite the drubbing he took in
the press and the struggles on the
slopes, I can take solace in the fact
that Bode is just going to keep on
doing his thing.
"I just did it my way," Bode said.
"I'm not a martyr, and I'm not a do
gooder. I just want to go out and
rock."

Friends say junior Alex Gyr is nearly as
spunky as Bode himself. Hit the slopes

As the world turned its atten
tion to the 2006 Winter
Olympic Games in Torino,
the expectations placed upon Bode
Miller were higher than those placed
upon any other US athlete. He was
the lone hope for US Alpine skiing —
the one man wearing the red, white
and blue who had shown that he
could consistently win at the interna
tional level. Not only that, but Bode
had drawn attention to himself by
going on "60 Minutes" and claiming
that after clinching the overall World
Cup Title, he skied the next day not
only hung-over. but still drunk from a
night of celebration.
So when Bode failed to medal in
the five events he entered in Torino,
the national media went off. They
claimed Bode was irresponsible. He
was out of shape. He wasn't trying his
hardest. He let America down. He
was an embarrassment.
Never before had I seen an
Olympian get hammered the way
Bode did. He didn't do steroids, he
didn't mouth off, he didn't hurt any
one — he simply didn't win.
Yet despite the sharp and inces
sant criticism. Bode seemed perfectly
content with how his Olympics went.
He didn't pout or moan or feel bad for
himself. Instead he said the Olympic
experience is what the whole thing is
about anyway, not just the results.
"The expectations were other
people's," Bode said in an interview
with the AP following his final race.
"I'm comfortable with what I've ac
complished, including at the
Olympics. I came in here to race as
hard as I could. TTiat was my obliga
tion to myself."
Instead of feeling sympathy for the
guy or having admiration for a person
who despite some tough breaks was
still emotionally strong, the national
press saw Bode's performance as an
outrage. They didn't seem to under
stand how a skier with so much talent
and with such a high ceiling could be
happy when his best finish was fifth
place. It may be hard for many sports
fans to appreciate, but in the
Olympics, winning isn't everything.
Sure, it is easy to get caught up in
medal counts — but talk to nearly
any Olympic athlete and they will tell
you that the experience is as impor
tant as the results.
There is no doubt that Bode is
