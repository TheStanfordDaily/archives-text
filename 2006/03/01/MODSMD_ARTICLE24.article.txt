Stringer named Pitcher of the Week
Sophomore David Stringer has started in only one game for Stanford,
but that outing, plus a key five-inning relief effort against Fresno State,
was more than enough to earn him the Pac-10 Pitcher of the Week award.
"It's a great honor," said Stringer. "It's great to win the award, but I
can't take full credit. I felt like 1 threw the ball well, but without the team,
coaches and John [ Hester, senior catcher] behind me, 1 'd be nowhere."
A Palo Alto, Calif, native. Stringer's numbers were impressive,
going 2-0 with a 0.87 ERA in 10.1 innings of work. It is his first time
winning the award.
"I knew I had a great week," Stringer said."l didn't know how great."
Football coaching team complete
Jeff Hammerschmidt, the linebackers coach at Cal Poly San Luis
Obispo last year, was named the outside linebackers/special teams coach
for the Cardinal. Hammerschmidt attended the University of Arizona,
where he was a two-time All-Pac-10 safety.
His hiring fills the final of four spots recently vacated by former assis
tants. Former defensive coordinator Tom Hayes went to the New Or
leans Saints as a defensive backs coach while former running backs coach
Wayne Moses took the same position with the St. Louis Rams. Rounding
out the attrition, special teams coach Tom Quinn now holds that role with
the New York Giants and recruiting specialist Nathaniel 1 lackett is now
the quality control coach with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
Filling the other three vacated Stanford spots are A.J. Christoff.as the
defensive coordinator/secondary coach. Buzz Preston as running backs
coach and Nate Nelson as assistant coach for specialists and recruiting co
ordinator.
