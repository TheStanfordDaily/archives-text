after swimming them back-to-hack
this weekend," head coach Heather
Olson said. "Saturday and Sunday
were two hard competition days in a
row, so it was a great test of the team's
endurance. [I was] very excited about
the improvements the team made this
weekend."
ITie next and final test of the colle
giate season is the national champi
onship meet, which will be held at
Stanford March 23 - 25, when the Car
dinal will defend their 2(X)5 crown.
"We have three weeks to focus on

details, final matching of the routines
and improving our lift height," Olson
said.
In addition to preparations made
in the pool, the Cardinal swimmers
will also have to square away winter
quarter academic obligations in ad

"Many of our athletes are taking
finals during Dead Week," Olson said.
"I think our greatest challenge will be
balancing finals with trying to win a
national championship."

challenge will be Ohio State. The
Buckeyes (14-0) boast a large roster
of swimmers led by All-American
Becky Kim, whose early-season
