## Dramatic weekend for lacrosse Notre Dame wins in double-overtime sudden death 
### ROHAN PURANIK CONTRIBuTING WRITER 
The members of the women's lacrosse
team opened this past weekend on a
strong note with a dominant 17-9 win
over Ohio State, hut they were unable to
sustain the momentum as they suffered a
disappointing double-overtime sudden
death loss to Notre Dame on Sunday.
Last year, the squad defeated Ohio
State (0-1) 13-7, but the Cardinal (2-2,1-1
MPSF) bettered that margin this year by
defeating the Buckeyes 17-9. Junior at
tack Michelle DeChant and senior attack
Megan Burker were the top scorers for
the Cardinal with five goals each.
The game started out with the Buck
eyes picking up two quick goals in the first
two minutes. Soon after, however,
DeChant started a lengthy scoring run for
the Cardinal with her first tally of the day.
The Buckeyes managed to sneak in just a
single goal before the Card netted seven
straight unanswered goals.
The first half ended with the Cardinal
leading 10-4 and the Stanford women
having fired off twice as many shots as
Ohio State. In the half. DeChant con
tributed four goals as did Burker. Junior
midfielder Liz Piselli and senior attack
Sarah Bach scored the other two Stan
ford goals.
Hie second half was not nearly as
dominant a showing, as the Cardinal
scored only seven goals to the Buckeyes'
five. Ohio State took 13 shots while Stan
ford managed 15. Junior midfielder/de
fender Bryanne Gilkinson. freshman
midfielder Jamie Nesbitt and freshman
midfielder/attack Bis Fries all added
goals for the Card in the second half, in
addition to those from Burker, Piselli and
De( 3iant.
The Cardinal's success on Saturday,
however, did not translate on Sunday as
the women fell 11-12 to the No. 17 Notre
Dame (2-0) squad.
Both squads played excellent defense,
and the game remained scoreless until
the 11 minute mark of the first half.
Sophomore midfielder Anna Brown ig
nited a five goal Cardinal run with a free
position shot.
With less than a minute left and the
Cardinal leading 5-0 in the first half,
Notre Dame's Crysti Foote netted a goal
for the Fighting Irish. Still, the Stanford
team held a solid four goal lead at the
close of the first half of play.
The second half began with two quick
goals from the Fighting Irish, but the Car
dinal responded with four of their own.
With only 10 minutes left in the game,
Stanford held the commanding 9-4 lead.
ITien the Stanford defense fell apart,
allowing the Fighting Irish to score five
goals before the end of regulation. In
both overtime periods Stanford scored
early, only to see the Notre Dame squad
respond with mere seconds remaining on
the clock. In the sudden death finale,
however, it was Notre Dame who scored
first to gain the victory.
Sophomore attack Daphne Patterson
was the lead scorer for Stanford with four
goals over the course of the game.
The loss was particularly difficult to
swallow because the Stanford team
beat Notre Dame last season with a
goal in the final 18 seconds of the
game.
Stanford's record now stands at 2-
2 overall, 1-1 in Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation conference play.
I"he squad faces conference rival
UC-Davis this Friday at 7 p.m. at
home on Maloney Field. Stanford
routed Davis 14-6 last season on the
strength of Bach's three-goal per
formance. Then on Sunday, the squad
faces No. 13 Vanderbilt at home.
