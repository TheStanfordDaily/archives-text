"I've probably used more curse words in this building
than anybody ever — except for the failing students,"
quipped rapper Chuck D. to a packed audience in Cubber
ley Auditorium on TUesday night.
The leader and co-founder of the legendary rap group
Public Enemy delivered a lecture titled "Rap, Race and
Technology," combining the history of rap music, the legacy

"I have to hand it to you — you're the closest thing we've
got to Canada," he noted, to laughter and applause from the
audience. He characterized the current political climate as
"dumb-mass-ification with village idiot at the top," and crit

"You can't freestyle the facts," D. said, punning "weapons
of mass destruction" with "weapons of mass distraction" and
"whippings of ass-distraction."
He didn't spare the audience either, with his message
against apathy and resignation.
"Colleges are melting pots, or are they?" he asked, pok
ing fun at the breed of "collegiate thugs" that he calls "oxy
morons."
"People on the street do things, but they don't think," D.
