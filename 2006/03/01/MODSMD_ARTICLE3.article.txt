# Rapper addresses race issues
## Speaker's Bureau sponsors legendary rapper's talk on the culture of hip-hop 
### MELISSA FUSCO STAFF WRITER 
"I've probably used more curse words in this building
than anybody ever — except for the failing students,"
quipped rapper Chuck D. to a packed audience in Cubber
ley Auditorium on TUesday night.
The leader and co-founder of the legendary rap group
Public Enemy delivered a lecture titled "Rap, Race and
Technology," combining the history of rap music, the legacy
of technological innovation and the state of American poli
tics.The talk was sponsored by the ASSU Speaker's Bureau.
Chuck D. began his talk with a protest against racism
and the complacency toward it in American society, stress
ing the isolationism and ignorance of a history that fosters
discrimination.
But as a speaker who has toured colleges around the na
tion for 15 years, he had kind and joking words about North
ern California.
"I have to hand it to you — you're the closest thing we've
got to Canada," he noted, to laughter and applause from the
audience. He characterized the current political climate as
"dumb-mass-ification with village idiot at the top," and crit
icized the occupation of Iraq as "a war filled with misinfor
mation, which we still can't put our finger on."
"You can't freestyle the facts," D. said, punning "weapons
of mass destruction" with "weapons of mass distraction" and
"whippings of ass-distraction."
He didn't spare the audience either, with his message
against apathy and resignation.
"Colleges are melting pots, or are they?" he asked, pok
ing fun at the breed of "collegiate thugs" that he calls "oxy
morons."
"People on the street do things, but they don't think," D.

said. "College students don't do any
thing, they just think too much."
D. also reiterated the message of
Public Enemy's infamous 1991 single,
"I Don't Wanna Be Called Yo
Nigga," which blasted the practice of
using the racist slur for self-identifica
tion.
"In the new millennium, black is a
cursed word, but nigger ain't. What
sense does that make?" he asked.
"You can only say that because
someone gave you a platform to
broadcast the masses," he said, re
minding the audience of the violence
behind the words.
"How the hell could hip-hop turn
the word like that, after the way it was
used for 2(X) years?" he asked. "Even
'cracker,' for a white person, comes
from the sound of the whip."
From there, the rapper took the
audience on whirlwind history of

African-American music, tracing
hip-hop's roots back to slaves' use of
song for communication.
"What do you think black people
were thinking while the master was
cracking the whip? They were com
ing up with codes," he said.
D. narrated the transmission of
the black musical code throughout
the early 20th century, as jazz, gospel
and blues diffused through America,
emphasizing the music's rough roots
and the struggles of pioneering black
musicians.
"Jazz and the blues don't start out
with Kenny G.," he said. "It's ass
music, coming out of hustlers, prosti
tutes, pimps and slave-dealers.
"If you follow the black migration,
you find the code, people singing
things they weren't allowed to say."
He drew attention to the importance
of the mixed-race Creole community

in New Orleans, which added an ele
ment of classical music to the growing
jazz movement. The British Invasion
of the 1960s brought Europe into the
feedback loop of musical innovation,
but the source was still clear — even
the Rolling Stones, D. noted, got their
name from a Muddy Waters song.
A strong file-sharing activist and
Internet music pioneer. D. stressed
the importance of technology in
music's ability to spread through so
ciety and overcome the racial barri
ers that traditionally isolated black
music from the mainstream.
"In 1949. the first black DJ was fi
nally playing black music," he said.
"Technology has moved up from
WWII, and radio stations had more
power."
"Was this music just for black peo
ple? No, it was on the damn radio. It's
for everybody. They're listening to it.

ITieir kids art' listening to it,"he said.
I le also stressed the importance of
television, pointing to landmark pro
grams like " Ihe Cosby Show," which
first brought black professionals and
black colleges to the nation's attention.
While stressing technology's po
tential to break down racist barriers,
D. also denounced the apathy and
commercialism that forms the down
side of the information age, singling
out the entertainment industry in
particular.
"People in control want the mass
es to be synonymous with asses," he
said, calling New York and LA "con
trol stations of the radiation of a TV
radio nation."
"History isn't repetitive to Ameri
cans," he concluded. "It's given, and
then it just drifts away. You learn
something, don't just take a test and
forget it. Keep it with you."

got to Canada," he noted, to laughter and applause from the
audience. He characterized the current political climate as
"dumb-mass-ification with village idiot at the top," and crit
icized the occupation of Iraq as "a war filled with misinfor
mation, which we still can't put our finger on."
"You can't freestyle the facts," D. said, punning "weapons
of mass destruction" with "weapons of mass distraction" and
"whippings of ass-distraction."
He didn't spare the audience either, with his message
against apathy and resignation.
"Colleges are melting pots, or are they?" he asked, pok
ing fun at the breed of "collegiate thugs" that he calls "oxy
morons."
"People on the street do things, but they don't think," D.

said. "College students don't do any
thing, they just think too much."
D. also reiterated the message of
Public Enemy's infamous 1991 single,
"I Don't Wanna Be Called Yo
Nigga," which blasted the practice of
using the racist slur for self-identifica
tion.
"In the new millennium, black is a
cursed word, but nigger ain't. What
sense does that make?" he asked.
"You can only say that because
someone gave you a platform to
broadcast the masses," he said, re
minding the audience of the violence
behind the words.
"How the hell could hip-hop turn
the word like that, after the way it was
used for 2(X) years?" he asked. "Even
'cracker,' for a white person, comes
from the sound of the whip."
From there, the rapper took the
audience on whirlwind history of

African-American music, tracing
hip-hop's roots back to slaves' use of
song for communication.
"What do you think black people
were thinking while the master was
cracking the whip? They were com
ing up with codes," he said.
D. narrated the transmission of
the black musical code throughout
the early 20th century, as jazz, gospel
and blues diffused through America,
emphasizing the music's rough roots
and the struggles of pioneering black
musicians.
"Jazz and the blues don't start out
with Kenny G.," he said. "It's ass
music, coming out of hustlers, prosti
tutes, pimps and slave-dealers.
"If you follow the black migration,
you find the code, people singing
things they weren't allowed to say."
He drew attention to the importance
of the mixed-race Creole community

in New Orleans, which added an ele
ment of classical music to the growing
jazz movement. The British Invasion
of the 1960s brought Europe into the
feedback loop of musical innovation,
but the source was still clear — even
the Rolling Stones, D. noted, got their
name from a Muddy Waters song.
A strong file-sharing activist and
Internet music pioneer. D. stressed
the importance of technology in
music's ability to spread through so
ciety and overcome the racial barri
ers that traditionally isolated black
music from the mainstream.
"In 1949. the first black DJ was fi
nally playing black music," he said.
"Technology has moved up from
WWII, and radio stations had more
power."
"Was this music just for black peo
ple? No, it was on the damn radio. It's
for everybody. They're listening to it.

ITieir kids art' listening to it,"he said.
I le also stressed the importance of
television, pointing to landmark pro
grams like " Ihe Cosby Show," which
first brought black professionals and
black colleges to the nation's attention.
While stressing technology's po
tential to break down racist barriers,
D. also denounced the apathy and
commercialism that forms the down
side of the information age, singling
out the entertainment industry in
particular.
"People in control want the mass
es to be synonymous with asses," he
said, calling New York and LA "con
trol stations of the radiation of a TV
radio nation."
"History isn't repetitive to Ameri
cans," he concluded. "It's given, and
then it just drifts away. You learn
something, don't just take a test and
forget it. Keep it with you."
