# Boardman opens up new home to students
## "This is a great opportunity to work and live in this setting."

GREG BOARDMAN,
Vice Provost for Student Affairs, on his new lakeside residence

According to most campus maps, 636 Lomita Court is
the President's Office Operations Building, but outside
the gate there is a sign that says "private residence." As of
two weeks ago, that private resident is Greg Boardman,
the new Vice Provost for Student Affairs.
Even though Boardman started moving into what is
commonly called "The Lake House" two weeks ago, his
driveway is still piled high with cardboard boxes waiting
to be taken away.
Boardman has only been working at the University for
three years, hired to replace former VPSA Gene Awaku
ni under the title Interim Dean of Student Affairs. He has
certainly come far. His promotion to the position of VPS A
seemed no surprised for a man hailed for his "creative en
ergy" by his predecessor.
"Greg has shown capacity for leadership of the stu
dent affairs organization as well as a good understanding
of the Stanford community," said Provost John
Etchemendy in the January announcement of Board-

man s new position.
As part and parcel of the promotion, Etchemendy
asked him to move onto the Stanford campus, a move
Boardman was eager to make.
"This really gives me the opportunity to work and live
in this setting and get an idea of what issues and concerns
are affecting the campus," said Boardman, speaking at his
new home.
The house itself is airy, with broad windows opening
onto the expansive view of Lake Lagunita. Boardman
won't be taking in the view alone, as his dog. Raleigh, will
also enjoy the vast area surrounding the residence.
Though Boardman worked at Tulane University for
over 16 years, he has not had the chance to actually live on
a college campus. In his former job, he lived in uptown
New Orleans.
Now, he is right at the heart of things, just where he
wants to be.
"I'm looking forward to having a number of different
student and faculty groups over," Boardman said.
While he hasn't figured out just
what sort of activities he will end up
sponsoring, he is eager to make his
home a center for students, a campus
hub of so to speak.
When he first became the Interim
Dean of Students, Boardman stressed
his devotion to maintaining a close re
lationship with the student body.
"1 have a high commitment to
being responsive to student concerns
and a commitment to providing
high-quality programs and student
services," he said.
Now, three years later, and resid
ing on campus, Boardman has seem
ingly proven this devotion. The
ASSU Undergraduate Senate has
stated that his promotion will bring a
"high level of service in student af
fairs," but Boardman doesn't seem
the type to rest on his laurels.
"Living here really allows me to
eat, breathe and live Stanford,"
Boardman said.
For the next few weeks, students
walking home to Jerry, Kappa
Alpha, or the Enchanted Broccoli
Forest (EBF) ought to stop by and
welcome their newest neighbor.
