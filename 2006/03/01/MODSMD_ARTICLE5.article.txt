## More servers added to speed up Course Work Academic Computing increase number of servers 
### STEPHANIE FAGLIANO STAFF WRITER 
Several changes are being made to
Course Work, Stanford's academic ad
ministration site, to make it faster and
easier to use.
Academic Computing, a division of
Stanford University Libraries and Aca
demic Information Resources (SU
LAIR), is responsible for maintaining
this site. According to Lois Brooks,
technical manager of Academic Com
puting, Course Work's major goal is ef
ficiency.
"Our goal is to log everyone in as
fast as we can" Brooks said. "While we
have gotten better over the quarter, we
are exploring additional ways to im
prove login performance."
One of these improvements has
been the addition of servers.
"Additional servers were added to
the production environment in re
sponse to the login issues experienced
during the first three weeks of winter
quarter," Brooks said. "Doubling the
total numbers of Course Work servers
will help spread the distribution of
login attempts, thereby reducing the
likelihood of slow login process from
reoccurring."
The Course Work team has worked
hard to improve the speed and utility of
the site. There are also steps every stu
dent can take to help prevent the login
process from slowing.
"Please do not login multiple times,"
was Brooks' first piece of advice.
"Whenever possible,students are en
couraged to access Course Work during
non-peak hours." Brooks said. "Stu
dents are also encouraged to log out of
Course Work after they are done using
the system so Course Work connections
can be made available to other users.
"Finally, when students are on the
WebAuth page after logging in to
Course Work, they should click the link
that directs them to a specific
Course Work server only once,"
Brooks concluded. "Each addition
al click adds new connections to the
directing server, which will only
slow down the login process even
more."
Students who do not want to use
Course Work during peak hours
should avoid logging in between 10
p.m. and midnight — especially on
Sunday and Tuesday nights — which
tend to be the busiest times.
"The problem [that can slow
Course Work down] isn't the average
login times, but rather it's the peak
login times." Brooks said."lf we get a
sudden surge of users to a specific
Course Work server, users might go
from less than five-second logins to a
minute or more, while at the same
time people are logging on in less
than five seconds on other servers.
Login times vary wildly depending

on how many users are trying to log
onto a given server at a given time,
and how many courses those users
are in."
Yet despite the occasional diffi
culty logging on to the site, students
generally expressed satisfaction with
their Course Work experiences.
"I think Course Work is effec
tive," said sophomore Sophia
Hwang. "It's a nice centralized place
to get course information. It's just
annoying during high traffic times
when you can't really log on, but
most of the time, it's a good site."
Sophomore David Fenning
agreed.
"1 think Course Work is very ef
fective," Fenning said. "I think Stan
ford does a good job of providing
enough servers such that you never
really have to wait too long. Go to
Berkeley if you want to wait."
