# STUDENT GOVERNMENT
## Groups approved for fees ballot Student groups will no longer receive funds for food at meetings 
### CLAY BAVINGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last night th» ASSU Under
graduate Senate met to vote on
which student groups would be in
cluded on the spring ballot to re
ceive special fees. While the ma
jority of groups were approved,
several sparked further discus
sion. includingThe Daily and Club
Sports. All groups' requests had
previously been screened by the
Senate's finance committee.
Yet, immediately after Senate

Chair Chris Nguyen, a junior,
called the meeting to order, a mo
tion was made to reconsider the
bill regarding the listing of candi
dates' endorsements on the elec
tion ballots.The bill,calling for the
removal of such endorsements,
was passed at last week's joint ses
sion of the Senate and Graduate
Student Council.
Because many of the under
graduate senators were absent
from this last meeting due to per
sonal conflicts, several felt the
vote on the subject was unrepre
sentative. In light of these con
cerns, the Senate voted to recon
sider the bill.
The meeting then shifted to the
string of votes on which groups

will be allowed to appear on the spe
cial-fees ballot. The entire student
body will vote to grant special fees to
these approved groups during the
spring elections, to be held on April
12 and 13.
Most of the groups' requests were
quickly approved, though some in
volved lengthy debate.
Specifically, The Daily-which is
requesting $49,000 in special fees
this year-incited some controversy,
as some senators said they were
skeptical about whether or not the
campus newspaper truly needs the
funds to operate since it brings in in
come from advertisers.
Several senators, as well as GSC
Member Adam Beberg, a graduate
student in computer science, ex
pressed their belief that The Daily
would be able to support itself with
out the aid of special fees.
In rebuttal. Daily Chief Operat
ing Officer Brendan Marten said
that though the paper does bring in
revenue by selling ads, it delivers its
product to the student body for free.
He added that The Daily's financial
situation is not as steady as many
perceive it to be, sometimes suffer
ing losses amounting to as much as
$200,000.
Despite Marten's argument, the
Senate still voted to approve the
$31,000 limit on special fees for The
Daily, which will petition for more
funds as the election draws closer.
The special-fees request submit
ted by Club Sports was also ap

proved, though only after modifica
tions to pervious years' budgets. Last
year, the GSC expressed discontent
that the graduate student population
was forced to contribute as much to
the athletic program as undergradu
ates, even though far less graduate
students participate.
Last year, to remedy this situa
tion, both the GSC and Senate ap
proved a split fee that charged one
third of the contribution to Club
Sports to graduate students, and
two-thirds to the undergraduates.
Both governing bodies agreed that
this was a fair division of the costs.
However, not enough graduate
students voted in the election, leav
ing the Club Sports program with in
sufficient funds to carry on their reg
ular programming. This year, a pro
posed bill stipulates that if too few
graduate students vote-which is like
ly-only sports predominantly played
by graduate students will be impact
ed by the loss.
One of the major changes in this
year's ASSU financial policy for the
approval of student groups' budgets
concerns meeting food. ITiis year,
meeting food is not being funded,
eliciting complaints from several
groups.
"We are happier and more pro
ductive if we have food, which helps
our final product," argued a repre
sentative from the Stanford Shake
speare Society.
While the senators agreed with
this student, junior Senator Faris
Mohiuddin, chair of the Appropria
tions Committee, said. "With a limit
ed amount of money to give to stu
dent groups, we want to make sure
we give students the most bang for
the buck."
