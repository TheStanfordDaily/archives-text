Last night thÂ» ASSU Under
graduate Senate met to vote on
which student groups would be in
cluded on the spring ballot to re
ceive special fees. While the ma
jority of groups were approved,
several sparked further discus

Chair Chris Nguyen, a junior,

vote on the subject was unrepre
sentative. In light of these con
cerns, the Senate voted to recon
sider the bill.
The meeting then shifted to the
string of votes on which groups
