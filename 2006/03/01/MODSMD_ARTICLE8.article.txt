## New Orleans lets good times roll 
### MARY FOSTER ASSOCIATED PRESS 
NEW ORLEANS (AP) —The crowds were small
and the costumes wickedly satirical as Mardi Gras
reached its boozy climax Tuesday in this hurricane-buck
led city that could use a few laughs.
The culmination of the eight-day pre-Lenten bash fell
nearly six months to the day after the Aug. 29 storm that
smashed thousands of homes and killed more than 1,300
people, the vast majority of them in New Orleans.
"I lost everything," Andrew Hunter, 42, said as he sat
on the steps of his ruined home on Jackson Avenue. "But
what the heck, lliis helps us keep our spirits up, and we
need all the help we can get with that."
Even amid the typical debauchery — including early
morning drinking, flashes of bare breasts and skimpy
costumes in the French Ouarter — there was no escap
ing reminders of the storm.
Zulu, the 97-year-old Mardi Gras club, or krewe. that
lost 10 members to Katrina, paraded amid homes that
still bear dirty brown water marks from the floodwaters
that covered 80 percent of the city. Another krewe, Rex,
King of Carnival, paraded past a boarded-up store bear
ing a spray-painted warning that looters would be shot.
Kevin and Marie Barre.a husband and wife from New
Orleans, wore white plastic coveralls bearing the all-too
familiar spray-painted "X" that denotes a home that has
been checked for bodies. "It's a reminder. A lot of people
who are coming down here don't understand what we've
been through," Kevin Barre said.
Members of another club called the Krewe of MRE
covered themselves with brown labels from the Meals
Ready to Eat that were served to thousands who hud
dled in the Superdome after the storm. Others dressed as
giant maggots, recalling the days when city streets were
lined with abandoned refrigerators full of rotting food.
Mayor Ray Nagin, wearing a black beret and camou
flage uniform, portrayed cigar-chomping Gen. Russell
Honore.the military man who led the first big relief con
voy into the city.
"It's been absolutely — I don't know how to describe
it — great," Nagin said of the party. "Katrina did a lot of
bad things. But it has done something to give New Ocea
nians a fresh love for their city."
Several people draped themselves in blue tarps like
those used to cover damaged roofs, fashioning them into
ballgowns and nun's habits. A man with a model of a mil

itary helicopter suspended over his head wrapped him
self in a white blanket with "2000 lbs" stenciled on it —
he was a giant sandbag, like the ones dropped into one of
the breached levees.
Another group of French Quarter revelers dressed as
blind people with canes and dark glasses.They wore hard
hats and T-shirts emblazoned "LEVEE INSPECTOR."
Along an Uptown parade route, a family who lost their
Lakeview home to flooding poked fun at former FEMA
director Michael Brown. Jenny Louis,her husband, Ross,
and their three children strolled around in all-brown cos
tumes, similar to the uniforms worn by UPS drivers. Print
ed on their backs: "What Did Brown Do For You Today?"
After the parades. Bourbon Street was crowded with
hard-drinking revelers. Police on horseback generally
clear the street at midnight, although the party often con
tinues in French Quarter bars into the early hours of Ash
Wednesday.
Despite partly sunny weather and temperatures in the
70s, the crowds were smaller than usual in a city that still has
less than half its pre-storm population of almost a half-mil

lion. Finding a prime parade-watching spot was not hard.
"We came out about 5 this morning and had no trou
ble getting a good spot." said Tammi Harlan, 56, of
Metairie. "We've been coming to this spot for about 20
years, but normally the guys come the night before to
make sure we get it."
Traditions held. About 160 members of clarinetist
Pete Fountain's Half Fast Marching club had breakfast at
the shuttered Commander's Palace restaurant before
heading down the parade route — but without Fountain,
who is ill and missed what would have been his 46th trip
with the group.The celebrated musician is 75.
Visitors included New Orleans native Donald
Rooney, now of Denver, who wore a purple, green and
gold fright wig.
Mardi Gras is about "helping the city rebuild," he
said. "It's my hometown. ITiere's still a great soul that
lives in the city that lOfeet, 12 feet of water can't kill.and
it's coming back."Lissette Sutton, owner of a French
Quarter souvenir store, said she hoped the celebration
would show that the city can handle tourists again.

After the parades. Bourbon Street was crowded with
hard-drinking revelers. Police on horseback generally
clear the street at midnight, although the party often con
tinues in French Quarter bars into the early hours of Ash
Wednesday.
Despite partly sunny weather and temperatures in the
70s, the crowds were smaller than usual in a city that still has
less than half its pre-storm population of almost a half-mil

lion. Finding a prime parade-watching spot was not hard.
"We came out about 5 this morning and had no trou
ble getting a good spot." said Tammi Harlan, 56, of
Metairie. "We've been coming to this spot for about 20
years, but normally the guys come the night before to
make sure we get it."
Traditions held. About 160 members of clarinetist
Pete Fountain's Half Fast Marching club had breakfast at
the shuttered Commander's Palace restaurant before
heading down the parade route — but without Fountain,
who is ill and missed what would have been his 46th trip
with the group.The celebrated musician is 75.
Visitors included New Orleans native Donald
Rooney, now of Denver, who wore a purple, green and
gold fright wig.
Mardi Gras is about "helping the city rebuild," he
said. "It's my hometown. ITiere's still a great soul that
lives in the city that lOfeet, 12 feet of water can't kill.and
it's coming back."Lissette Sutton, owner of a French
Quarter souvenir store, said she hoped the celebration
would show that the city can handle tourists again.
