# White House fears civil war in Iraq
## Conflict in Iraq may jut Islamic sects against each other in Middle Last

WASHINGTON (AP) — A civil war in Iraq could
lead to a broader conflict in the Middle East, pitting the
region's rival Islamic sects against each other. National
Intelligence Director John Negroponte said in an un
usually frank assessment Tuesday.
"If chaos were to descend upon Iraq or the forces of
democracy were to be defeated in that country ... this
would have implications for the rest of the Middle East
region and, indeed, the world," Negroponte said at a
Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on global
threats.
Negroponte served as U.S. ambassador to Baghdad
before taking over as the nation's top intelligence offi
cial last April.
Iraqis have faced a chain of attacks and reprisals since
bombs destroyed the gold dome of a revered Shiite
shrine in Samarra last week. Hundreds, if not thousands,
have died, including more than 65 who were killed Tues
day by suicide attackers, car bombers and insurgents fir
ing mortars.
President Bush condemned the surge in violence and
said Iraqis must make a choice between "a free society
or a society dictated... by evil people who will kill inno
cents." Later, in an interview with ABC News' "World
News Tonight," he said he did not believe the escalation
of civil unrest would lead to a general civil war.
Negroponte tried to focus on progress in Iraq, but he
acknowledged a civil war would be a "serious setback"
to the global war on terror.
"The consequences for the people of Iraq would be
catastrophic," he said. "Clearly, it would seriously jeop
ardize the democratic political process on which they
are presently embarked. And one can only begin to
imagine what the political outcomes would be."
Saudi Arabia and Jordan could support Iraq's Sun
nis, Negroponte said. And Iran, run by a Shiite Islamic
theocracy, "has already got quite close ties with some of
the extremist elements" inside Iraq, he added.
While Iraq's neighbors "initially might be reluctant"
to get involved in a broader Sunni-Shiite conflict, "that
might well be a temptation," Negroponte said.
