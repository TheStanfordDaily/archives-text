Last night,the Drama Depart- \
ment opened the doors to its
production of "She," a play the
cast "hopes the audience will get
carried away in."The

play, fully titled

"She (In absence of love and
death)," is a dreamlike tragicom

edy written by Russian author Ed

vard Radzinsky in 1977.
"She" is set in a Communist

world rife with single women but nearly lacking single

men. The characters, each disillusioned with this so
ciopolitical situation, experience unique and delightful

dreams, though their lives still seem disturbingly similar.
When asked about the message of the play, director

Rachel Anderson, a second-year graduate student in

Drama, says, "The message is enmeshed in the charac

ters' different worlds and choices â€” it is a consequence of

the whole.
"I don't think it's a simple message," she continues. "In a very

quirky way. the play explores the difference between reality and
imagination, desire and possibility."
She wants to emphasize, however, that "She" is a funny, enter
taining play
"I hope there is laughter," she says. "I really hope we have a
thinking, laughing audience for this show. I think the play asks for
that, and I know that's what I'm looking for."

Radzinsky is a world-famous playwright, whose plays are out
produced in Russia only by Chekhov's. Besides playwriting,
Radzinsky is also an author, historian and television personality.
He has written many successful biographies of historical figures
such as Rasputin, Alexander 11, Nicholas II and Joseph Stalin. He
is famous throughout Russia, especially Moscow, for hosting the
television program "Mysteries of History."
The Drama Department produces several plays throughout
the school year. They just finished the Graduate Directing Work
shop, a series of one-acts each directed by a graduate student, and
"The Castle," a play about a soldier's return from the Crusades. In
the spring quarter, the department will produce "Phedre" by Jean
Racine.
Students generally enjoy the Drama Department's produc
tions.
"Having access to first-rate cultural events on campus has real
ly helped shape my freshman experience," says freshman Fiona
O'Donnell-McCarthy. "I really enjoyed 'The Castle' and am look
ing forward to watching 'She' this weekend."
O'Donnell-McCarthy also comments that she "does not un
derstand why some students don't take advantage of opportuni
ties like this."
Freshman Grant Escue agrees with O'Donnell-McCarthy.
He adds, "I appreciate the work that goes into these produc
tions. The Drama Department provides pretty good entertain
ment."
"She" will continue to run throughout Saturday, March 4. Tick
ets are available at the door or can be bought in advance by call
ing (650) 725-5838.
