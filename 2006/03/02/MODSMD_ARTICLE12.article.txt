# It's the end of the world as we know it

### 
When William Shakespeare wrote his
famous "Seven Ages of Man" poem
in his comedy "As You Like It," his
contemporaries weren't busily preparing cover
letters and resumes, or he would have included
an eighth age — the Senior Year of College.
Maybe it's because my friends and I are
mere months away from ending our glorious
rideontheconveyer-beltofadolescence,about
to be unceremoniously dropped in The Real
World with nothing more than diplomas in our
hands, but it's hard for me to conceptualize a
more stressful,life-altering moment in life than
the months before our college graduation.
For the past 21 years of our lives, we've al
ways had someone looking out for us — our
parents, our teachers, our RAs, our best
friends who live next door. On June IH, the
final strands of the umbilical cord will be cut
— it's time we look out for ourselves.
My friends have responded to this in very
different ways. Some lined up approximately

512,487 consulting interviews and are already
spending their signing bonuses before being
shipped off to the front lines of "financial
services strategy and risk management."
Hopefully they'll send me a postcard, if I hear
from them at all.
Others — dragging their feet in the sands
of life — are doing co-terminal programs and
will be lucky enough to enjoy another year of
full moons. Exotic/Erotics and Pub Nights. As
they say, the fifth time around is the charm.
Then there are the rest of us, who are
mired in so much self-reflection (and self
doubt) that we have no idea what we want to
do in this great wide world. It's not that 1 have
no interests — it's that the combination of my
indecision and my manic approach to life
means I have a new life plan every fortnight.
(Right now, it's living in Britain next year.)
When I start to panic about figuring out
my post-college life, I remind myself that as a
Stanford student. I could hardly be better off.

As dramatic as we may sometimes behave
about how scary next year is, we should all
take a step back and remember that we're the
top one percent of the top one percent of the
privileged.
But that may be what makes this upcom
ing transitional period so hard. My Class of
2(K)5 friends reminisce longingly about how
much they loved their time as undergrads
and how much more they should have appre
ciated the time they had — and they don't
generally seem all that satisfied post-college.

I received an email from a friend last week
that was a three-sentence summary of her life
— she works too much, hates her boss and
has no free time. She ended it rather direly:
"Oh. and (by the way]. I'm on anti-depres
sants too. Yippee!"
Is this what I have to look forward to? Can
too much fountain-hopping and Frisbee golf
lead to a disillusioned post-college life?
I don't think so. At least. I hope not. It
would be sad indeed if the biggest compli
ment I could give to Stanford is that five years
down the road I'll still be longing for Wilbur
Dining and long lines at the bookstore.
Ultimately, fulfillment in life has to come
internally, not externally. No one is going to
make us happy but ourselves. Of course, this
maxim only leads me back to my original
quandary — what will 1 do with my life, and
what will make me the happiest?
I may not know exactly what that is, but I
am confident of one thing: Life is too short to

spend it doing what you think someone else
wants you to do. At the end of the day, even
Mother Teresa was ultimately living life for
herself. Her conception of the good may have
involved tremendous and laudable self-sacri
fice, but she still pursued it the way Donald
Thimp pursues trophy wives and hairpieces
— unapologetically and with zeal.
The question, then, is not what we should
do with our lives, but what will make our lives
satisfying. And underclassmen, appreciate the
time you have now but realize that in the
blink of an eye, you'll be standing in my shoes.
While 1 figure what 1 want to do in life, I
can seek solace in one thing — though I may
be in the Senior Year of College, at least I'm
not in Shakespeare's seventh age. I just don't
have the cranium for baldness and glasses.
