## Editorial Blowing the whistle on animal experimentation 
### 
Several weeks ago, members of Animal
Rights on the Farm held a demonstra
tion outside the Animal Research Fa
cility to protest animal experimentation on
campus. Since then, the protest has sparked
a debate on the Daily's opinions page.
As pointed out in Prof. Linda Cork's op
ed ("Stanford protects animal rights," Feb.
17), there is a complex system of checks and
balances at various levels to prevent inhu
mane treatment of experimental animals.
However, the current system fails to address
one critical flaw: Ihe status quo relies too
heavily on self-policing. The reality is that
many violations of these policies can easily
go unnoticed without a robust policy of
whistleblowing in place. For instance.a labo
ratory rat can be sacrificed in an inhumane
manner without any of the varied commit
tees and subcommittees ever finding out.
But is the current system conducive to
whistleblowing? After all, scientists working
in a laboratory setting face unique pressures
that make it difficult to disclose incriminat
ing evidence against their errant colleagues.
In particular, those who are new to a lab
oratory are less likely to blow the whistle on
their principal investigators. Doctoral candi
dates on rotation are under tremendous
scrutiny and may feel uncomfortable blow
ing the whistle on their superiors when much
is at stake. Undergraduates who are at
tached to a laboratory are even lower in the
scientific food chain, and are even less in
clined to implicate their mentors. In such sit
uations. whistleblowing would be seen as the
height of ingratitude.
Likewise, doctoral candidates and post
doctoral staff who are already entrenched in
a laboratory are equally unlikely to de
nounce their colleagues. After all, it is in
their own interest to prevent the laboratory
from being slapped with punitive fines. In
these cases, whistleblowing would definitely
create an awkward, if not hostile, work envi
ronment.
Some might point out that much of sci
ence is already self-policing, and that scien
tists can be trusted to abide by such policies.
However, we are concerned that whistle
blowing may be less likely to take place in a
scientific environment, especially given the
immense pressure scientists face to publish

their results before their rivals.
Moreover, the public's faith in modern
science has been shaken by the publication
of fraudulent results by South Korean sci
entist Hwang Woo-suk. In light of these re
cent developments, scientists must recog
nize the stakes involved in this debate. In
stead of remaining silent or distant, it is im
perative that scientists become more trans
parent in their actions.
The Editorial Board suggests that the
Animal Care and Use Committee take con
crete steps to improve the general percep
tion of animal experimentation on campus.
First, the Committee should regularly pub
lish the number of animals that are used in
each laboratory. Second, it should make
clear how many of these experimental ani
mals are being sacrificed in the course of
each year. Third, it should provide a list of
representative procedures being carried out
on these animals — for instance, how labo
ratories probe brain activity in owls as part
of their research. Fourth, the Committee
should make clear the fines levied for viola
tions of such regulations and indicate these
amounts as a percentage of the laboratory's
annual budget. All this information should
be made easily available to the general Stan
ford community.
In addition, there must be more measures
in place for violations to be reported in com
plete anonymity. The Committee should
clearly publish phone numbers and email
addresses to which individuals can directly
report irregularities without first having to
inform the laboratory's principal investiga
tor. It should also make it mandatory for all
laboratories to publish this contact informa
tion prominently in every laboratory space.
Also, new members joining a laboratory
should be thoroughly briefed on the proce
dures of whistleblowing and informed of
their larger responsibility to report viola
tions.
Experimental animals cannot merely be
seen as collateral damage in the quest for
knowledge. Questions from animal rights
activists should not be instinctively regarded
as attacks on science; rather, scientists need
to step up to the challenge and hold them
selves to a higher level of scrutiny and ac
countability.
