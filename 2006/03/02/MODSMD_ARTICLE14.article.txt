# A 						Modern Fairytale
## The 						splendor of South Africa 
### 
Most Americans are not aware that
South Africa is the only country in
the world that contains an entire
Floral Kingdom within its borders. Nor are
they aware that while South Africa does not
allow the import of used cars, bringing in
used car parts is permitted. (The more enter
prising may know that the legal difference
between a "used car" and "used car parts" is
an engine and all four doors.) And many
don't realize that "apartheid" is actually pro
nounced "apart-hate."
When the plane touched down in Johan
nesburg, lb hours after take-off, the first
thing that greeted me outside the terminal
was a giant sculpture of a fist — clutching a
cell phone. 11 was an enormous three-dimen
sional Samsung advertisement.
I thought to myself, "This is my kind of
place."
But after that, my impression of South
Africa began to remind me of home. I mean
"home" in that loose sense of "other places
I've been besides South Africa."The Johan
nesburg skyline looks like any unspecified
U.S. city (although here most of the build
ings have been abandoned due to rampant
crime).The barbed wire and high fences sur
rounding homes are a bit unusual, but I
know I've seen homes around Newark with
similar armaments. The roadsigns remind
me of riding the bus between London and
Oxford.
They even have those cell phone towers
disguised to look like trees. But South Africa
does a remarkably better job than America
— the "trees" blend almost perfectly into
their surroundings, unlike the bizarre cross
es between redwoods and palm trees that
have cropped up in New York.
The trickier adjustment has been adapt
ing to being part of a herd. I haven't been
forced to spend so much time with strangers
since freshman year of college. Not only are
they strangers, but all, save one, of the 19 stu
dents in this program are female.
It's like freshman year all over again —
the small talk, the trying to figure out who
your friends will be, the gauging of every
one's sensitivity on various issues. Freshman
year was great, but it's the kind of thing I re
ally only needed to do once.
Worse yet, every single participant in my
program is pre-nied. Most also have an in
ternational focus of some kind. So beyond
the usual sizing up of the competition inher

ent to pre-meds, there's the whipping out
and measuring of international experiences
— the inevitable, "How did you get to do
that?" which translates to, "What have you
got that I haven't?"
Another quirk pre-meds share is the feel
ing that because they may be doctors one
day, they need to practice talking down to
people now. A few courses in the basic sci
ences, a summer or two in a lab and whatev
er outside reading they are compelled to do
and suddenly they're experts on skin cancer,
parasites or HPV, and hold forth on these
subjects with the quiet and grave authority
of the more-informed-than-thou.
But I forced this internal maelstrom to
quiet down and, like fungus on a three-toed
sloth, the other girls started to grow on me.
South Africa as a whole has been doing that,
too.
I came to this country with little real
knowledge of its history. In between out
wardly teaching us what a thesis is and more
subtly instructing us in how to appreciate a
well-crafted short story, my sixth grade Eng
lish teacher (who, in her heyday, once wore
nothing but an American flag on her college
campus to protest the Vietnam War) told us
the bare bones about apartheid. But I had
not realized how very dangerous it was, as
Mrs. Dalloway said, to live even a single day.
We visited the Apartheid Museum out
side Johannesburg, and this experience put a
face (several million faces, really) on what I
had previously seen as an anonymous but
brutal system of governance. If you were
black under apartheid, your home, your job,
your freedom — anything you considered
your own — could be snatched away on a
whim. The "pass system" was instituted, re
quiring black people to carry identity papers
and authorization for any movement within
the country. But even having these papers in
order did not guarantee safety. Daily life, let
alone resistance to the status quo, amounted
to an extraordinary feat of perseverance.
Scarier still was realizing how recently
this had all taken place — people my age
were born under apartheid, albeit at the tail
end of the regime.
Faced with this history, now is an exciting
time to be in South Africa: There is a com
pelling and motivating mix of optimism for
the future and the continuing need to right
the wrongs of the past. The generos
ity and hospitality of the people I've
met so far doesn't hurt, either.
On the drive to Port Elizabeth,
where we will spend most of the se
mester, the original familiarity was
replaced with the feeling that I was
somewhere completely new and dif
ferent. It wasn't any one thing —
rather, it was the combination of the
flat lands covered in short, dry-look
ing grasses, solitary water-efficient
trees, the immense amount of sky
covering all of us, the van with its
South African pop playing on the
radio, the single-level houses with
brick facades and tile roofs, and the
last vestiges of sunlight leaking
away.

On the drive to Port Elizabeth,
where we will spend most of the se
mester, the original familiarity was
replaced with the feeling that I was
somewhere completely new and dif
ferent. It wasn't any one thing —
rather, it was the combination of the
flat lands covered in short, dry-look
ing grasses, solitary water-efficient
trees, the immense amount of sky
covering all of us, the van with its
South African pop playing on the
radio, the single-level houses with
brick facades and tile roofs, and the
last vestiges of sunlight leaking
away.

Most Americans are not aware that
South Africa is the only country in
the world that contains an entire
Floral Kingdom within its borders. Nor are
they aware that while South Africa does not
allow the import of used cars, bringing in
used car parts is permitted. (The more enter
prising may know that the legal difference
between a "used car" and "used car parts" is
an engine and all four doors.) And many
don't realize that "apartheid" is actually pro
nounced "apart-hate."
When the plane touched down in Johan
nesburg, lb hours after take-off, the first
thing that greeted me outside the terminal
was a giant sculpture of a fist — clutching a
cell phone. 11 was an enormous three-dimen
sional Samsung advertisement.
I thought to myself, "This is my kind of
place."
But after that, my impression of South
Africa began to remind me of home. I mean
"home" in that loose sense of "other places
I've been besides South Africa."The Johan
nesburg skyline looks like any unspecified
U.S. city (although here most of the build
ings have been abandoned due to rampant
crime).The barbed wire and high fences sur
rounding homes are a bit unusual, but I
know I've seen homes around Newark with
similar armaments. The roadsigns remind
me of riding the bus between London and
Oxford.
They even have those cell phone towers
disguised to look like trees. But South Africa
does a remarkably better job than America
— the "trees" blend almost perfectly into
their surroundings, unlike the bizarre cross
es between redwoods and palm trees that
have cropped up in New York.
The trickier adjustment has been adapt
ing to being part of a herd. I haven't been
forced to spend so much time with strangers
since freshman year of college. Not only are
they strangers, but all, save one, of the 19 stu
dents in this program are female.
It's like freshman year all over again —
the small talk, the trying to figure out who
your friends will be, the gauging of every
one's sensitivity on various issues. Freshman
year was great, but it's the kind of thing I re
ally only needed to do once.
Worse yet, every single participant in my
program is pre-nied. Most also have an in
ternational focus of some kind. So beyond
the usual sizing up of the competition inher

ent to pre-meds, there's the whipping out
and measuring of international experiences
— the inevitable, "How did you get to do
that?" which translates to, "What have you
got that I haven't?"
Another quirk pre-meds share is the feel
ing that because they may be doctors one
day, they need to practice talking down to
people now. A few courses in the basic sci
ences, a summer or two in a lab and whatev
er outside reading they are compelled to do
and suddenly they're experts on skin cancer,
parasites or HPV, and hold forth on these
subjects with the quiet and grave authority
of the more-informed-than-thou.
But I forced this internal maelstrom to
quiet down and, like fungus on a three-toed
sloth, the other girls started to grow on me.
South Africa as a whole has been doing that,
too.
I came to this country with little real
knowledge of its history. In between out
wardly teaching us what a thesis is and more
subtly instructing us in how to appreciate a
well-crafted short story, my sixth grade Eng
lish teacher (who, in her heyday, once wore
nothing but an American flag on her college
campus to protest the Vietnam War) told us
the bare bones about apartheid. But I had
not realized how very dangerous it was, as
Mrs. Dalloway said, to live even a single day.
We visited the Apartheid Museum out
side Johannesburg, and this experience put a
face (several million faces, really) on what I
had previously seen as an anonymous but
brutal system of governance. If you were
black under apartheid, your home, your job,
your freedom — anything you considered
your own — could be snatched away on a
whim. The "pass system" was instituted, re
quiring black people to carry identity papers
and authorization for any movement within
the country. But even having these papers in
order did not guarantee safety. Daily life, let
alone resistance to the status quo, amounted
to an extraordinary feat of perseverance.
Scarier still was realizing how recently
this had all taken place — people my age
were born under apartheid, albeit at the tail
end of the regime.
Faced with this history, now is an exciting
time to be in South Africa: There is a com
pelling and motivating mix of optimism for
