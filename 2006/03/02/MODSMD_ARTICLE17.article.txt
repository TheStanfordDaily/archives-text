# Winning isn't everything...or is it?
## 
### 
The United States should realize we are
not the best at everything. If nothing
else, the Winter Olympics of the last
two weeks should have made that abundant
ly clear. By numbers alone. Germany won 29
medals, four more than the United States.
But what annoys me about the Olympics
is not that we failed to utterly destroy the rest
of the world with our athletic prowess, but
rather how we have handled losing.
Instead of acknowledging and accepting
that our Olympic team was not as talented as
those of other countries, something we knew
going into the Games, the media has lambast
ed the conduct and performance of the U.S.
athletes. Worst of all, the media has produced
a scapegoat for all the United States' misfor
tunes: Bode Miller. Miller, a world champ,
was the rebel without a cause cowboy skier
that was going to put the United States on the
map during these Olympics events. Unfortu
nately. his 0-5 performance left a lot to be de
sired.
But what Bode symbolizes is more upset
ting to the media and the country: unfulfilled
potential — and I don't mean athletic poten
tial. Hyped as the Michael Phelps of these
Games, he could have been the charismatic
personality that the media, and perhaps the
whole country, longed for.
But Miller didn't want to be the United
States' golden boy. He didn't care about win
ning gold medals. He skied only to satisfy
himself and. according to post race inter
views, most of the time he did.

Fifth in the downhill? "I was happy with
the way I skied today."
Most of all. he didn't care about how he
represented the country, and it infuriated the
media. Bill Penington wrote in The New York
Times, 'Because of his position as the best
known United States Olympic athlete,
Miller's failures set the tone for the entire
Olympic team early in these games and his 0-
for-5 performance in the medals chase will be
the lasting impression of the 2(X)6 Games for
many Americans."
No, Bill, as much as you want to blame
Miller for the United States' dismal Olympic
performance, he did not ruin the Olympics
for Team USA or for the country — you did.
The reason Bode is all anyone will remember
from these games is because the media
wouldn't leave him alone.
There were other things the media could
have focused on. How about Shaun "The Fly
ing Tomato" White's absolutely insane run to
win the gold after being nearly eliminated in
the prelims? Or the United States' near
sweep of the snowboarding events? Or the 16
year-old Emily Hughes' performance de

spite being put on the Olympic team after the
opening ceremony? Or up-and-comer Ted
Ligety's surprise gold in the combined alpine
skiing?
Despite the media's willingness to place
all the blame on Miller for not representing
the United States and fulfilling his obliga
tions to the team, in the end, the media didn't
seem to care about the character of the ath
letes or their dedication to Team USA —
they only cared about winning.
Chad Hedwick, USA's first gold medal
winner, looked to be a hero of the games. But
when a dispute erupted between him and
teammate Shani Davis, another gold medal
winner, over Davis' opting out of the pursuit,
the media made Hedwick look like a fool.
Davis would have won a medal in his individ
ual event regardless of his participation in
the pursuit. The only thing on the line was
what color the medal would be. How dare
Hedwick ask Davis to risk a gold medal in his
individual race, even though Davis' time
would have guaranteed a medal for Team
USA in the pursuit. But the media sided with
Davis. Ttoo individual gold medals make a
better star, especially an African American
star at an Olympics dominated by whiteness.
Sasha Cohen's composure as she finished
her routine and hung on to the silver was ad
mirable and heart-wrenching. Unlike Miller,
Cohen always stopped for interviews, spoke
of how seriously she took the responsibility
of representing her country and how she was

proud of her recovery after her falls.
But was the media interested in
that? No. All they could do was ask
why she fell and if her wrapped
quadricep had anything to do with
it. God knows the United States
doesn't lose when it's healthy.
Harvey Araton wrote in The
New York Times, "We can live with
not being first in sports we hardly
understand or much relate to." I dis
agree. As a country, we don't take
failure well — we don't even take
silver well.
Perhaps Stephen Colbert best ar
ticulated the sentiment of the coun
try when he discussed the Olympics
on The Colbert Report. "Once every
four years, athletes from around the
world should put aside their differ
ences and come together in peaceful
competition," he said. "And lose to
the United States."
