Student Affairs staff value ethnic
student organizations
As the Student Affairs staff who worked
with Sigma Theta Psi during the planning of
their "Unleashed" step show and its after
party, we wish to respond to their recent
Daily opinions piece regarding their con
cerns with our assistance ("Discrimination
in Activities office," Feb. 22).
We regret that the Sigmas were dissatis
fied with efforts that were intended to en
sure the success and safety of their events. In
addition to "Unleashed," there were three
large student events that occurred last
weekend and all of the sponsoring groups
were working with the same set of expecta
tions.
Also, Student Affairs staff routinely at
tend student-run activities both as a sign of
support and because staff enjoy seeing the
results of students' hard work. We highly
value ethnic student organizations as we do
all student groups, and we are committed to
making all student events successful. We will
continue to strive to improve our efforts in

working with Sigma Theta Psi and other stu
dent groups.

Bad Wound epitomizes the worst of
modern liberalism
In his column ("To the Stanford Review:
Oh — it's on," Mar. 1), Adam Bad Wound
epitomizes the worst of modern liberalism.
He employs the rhetoric of victimization to

stifle debate on a fascinating cultural subject
— Indian mascots.
He alleges that he is making a "plea for in
clusiveness, dignity and respect," but that The
Stanford Review "does not do the same."
ITiis is simply not true. Executive Editor of
The Review Milton Solorzano respectfully
acknowledged and even agreed with these
sentiments as he wrote in his article, "I too
would oppose such a poorly-drawn mascot
for its egregious and offensive nature."
It is sad that Bad Wound does not even
recognize his simultaneous close-minded
ness, insensitivity and intolerance.
He is close-minded and insensitive toward
all the Stanford alumni who cherished and
revered the Indian as their mascot. Eor these
people, "mascot" is not a dirty word, but a
symbol of the spirit of their university and a
point of reference that elicits positive memo
ries of shared cultural experiences.
He is intolerant because he is attempting to
suppress alternative perspectives on campus.
It is one thing to argue that you are right and
the other side is wrong, but it is quite another
to argue that no one should even lis
ten to the arguments on the other
side.The Review is arguably the only
forum on campus where you could
have an honest debate about the mas
cot; where multiple alternative views
are presented and debated; and
where people don't become so per
sonally offended that they cannot
even listen to each other anymore.
Bad Wound mischaracterizes
The Review by saying, "The Review
does not represent an intellectual
diversity of perspectives; it offers a
one-sided conservative interpreta
tion." He erroneously believes that
conservatism implies one point of
view. Conservatism is quite intellec
tually diverse, but The Review in
cludes much more than just conser
vative views. We present many mod
erate views that are also marginal
ized by the dogmatism of modern
liberalism that suffuses this campus.
In the spirit of debate, I encour
age you to read Bad Wound's col
umn and The Review and think
about these issues for yourself.
