The battle for Tree continued

to raise the campus' insanity

level yesterday as candidates
attempted to show their

mettle and other mascot-re
lated skills.

In the morning. Psychiatry

Prof. William Dements "Sleep

and Dreams" lecture was again visited by a

Tree candidate, when senior Tommy Leep,

dressed in ripped tights and a green shirt, inter
rupted the class in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
He then posed a question to Dement.
"I haven't been getting much sleep," Leep said.
"I've gone 375 consecutive hours without sleep.
What should I do? How do I sleep?"
Leep and some supporters dressed in white
boxer briefs, white tights and blue bunny tails then
began to perform a complex, well-rehearsed ballet
routine to Styx's song "Come Sail Away."
"They brought out a bed covered in leaves and
[Tommy] went to sleep," said freshman Devyn
Brown. "Then this other guy dressed in a toga
came out and put a crown-halo thing on his head.
It was very much like a ballet, I was very im
pressed."
