The battle for Tree continued

to raise the campus' insanity

level yesterday as candidates
attempted to show their

mettle and other mascot-re
lated skills.

In the morning. Psychiatry

Prof. William Dements "Sleep

and Dreams" lecture was again visited by a

Tree candidate, when senior Tommy Leep,

dressed in ripped tights and a green shirt, inter
rupted the class in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
He then posed a question to Dement.
"I haven't been getting much sleep," Leep said.
"I've gone 375 consecutive hours without sleep.
What should I do? How do I sleep?"
Leep and some supporters dressed in white
boxer briefs, white tights and blue bunny tails then
began to perform a complex, well-rehearsed ballet
routine to Styx's song "Come Sail Away."
"They brought out a bed covered in leaves and
[Tommy] went to sleep," said freshman Devyn
Brown. "Then this other guy dressed in a toga
came out and put a crown-halo thing on his head.
It was very much like a ballet, I was very im
pressed."

Sophomore Daniel Novinson,
managing editor of sports for The
Daily, made his return to White Plaza
after a day off. At 12:30 p.m., Novin
son emerged from his tent in front of
the Birdcage and set up a laptop play
ing techno music. He began to un
dress, attempting to grind on some
nearby tourists, and was soon down to
his boxers.
"Yeah, Daniel Novinson!"
screamed an unidentified passing cy
clist.
Novinson's campaign managers,
the Chicken and the Rabbit, arrived
shortly thereafter and wrestled him to
the ground. The Chicken produced a
tube of hair removal gel and began to
apply it to Novinson's chest. After ap
plying some hair removal strips, the

Chicken ripped the strips off along
with much of Novinson's chest hair.
The process continued — some by
standers, including former Tree Erin
Lashnits, a coterminal student in bio
logical sciences, were recruited to re
move the strips — until much of
Novinson's body hair had been re
moved.
"How many Trees do you know
with body hair?" Novinson said. "It
needed to be done. Plus, the '40 Year
Old Virgin' film crew was on-hand, so
if 1 play my cards right, I'm going to be
a DVD bonus feature on their se
quel."
As part of her campaign, junior
Christina Zempel claimed to have
BASE jumped off Hoover Tower on
TUesday afternoon.
"1 was nervous about this stunt,"
Zempel said. "My uncle came up and
helped me prepare for this, and he re
ally knows what he's doing. I rejected
the idea of doing it while on fire. 1
landed in front of MemAud, dead

center on a tarp I had put down as a
hull's eye. I apologize for not letting
everyone know beforehand, but with
the sketchy weather I didn't want to
have to let everybody down."
Yesterday evening, meanwhile,
Zempel staged a stunt in the Alondra
Dining commons. One member of
Zempel's hoard, freshman Alex
Willen, became jealous and organ
ized a mutiny.
"I was going to take over her spot
because she was doing such a terrible
job," Willen said. "So my fellow mu
tineers carried her out and threw her
on the floor. Just for laughs I thought
I'd untie her, give her a chance to
fight 30 or 40 people. It turns out that
she knows martial arts, and she beat
down 20 or 30 of them and hit me in
the face."
The campaign for Tree looks to
heat up today as only three days re
main until the new Tree is crowned on
Mar. 4.
