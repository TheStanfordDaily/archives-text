## FINAL STAND AT HOME When asked what this class will be remembered for, Trent Johnson said, "Their ability to work through things." 
### SEAN HOWELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Some think this weekend, featuring
Southern California and No. 15 UCLA,
could be Stanford's last chance to get an at
large hid in the NCAA Tournament.
Others say the weekend is merely a
tune-up for the Pac-10 Tourney, which the
Cardinal (14-11,10-6) will need to sweep to
get a bid, regardless of this weekend's re
sults.
But speculation aside, these final regu
lar-season games will surely be the last at
Maples Pavilion for the team's four sen
iors — forward Matt Haryasz and guards
Dan Grunfeld, Chris Hernandez and
Jason Haas.
The first three of those players have
been the squad's nucleus over the past two
years, climbing up the Stanford record
books in several statistical categories.
ITiey are also among the most accom
plished active players in the Pac-10. Her
nandez has scored the third-most career
points of any Pac-10 player and ranks sec
ond in assists and third in steals. Haryasz has
more career blocks than any Pac-10 player
and the second-most rebounds, and he
ranks seventh in career points (Grunfeld is
eighth).
But today, the Cardinal face a more im
mediate concern — Southern California,
led by first-year (and former Chicago Bulls)
head coach Tim Floyd. The Trojans (17-10.
8-8) bounced back from a losing season last
year to run up an eight-game win streak in
non-conference play. But they have strug
gled of late, losing four of their last six.
Stanford might have trouble keeping up
with USC's speed. Ranking fourth and sixth
respectively in Pac-10 scoring, sophomore
guards Nick Young and Gabe Pruitt lead
the Trojans.
Pruitt, a dangerous outside shooter,
burned the Cardinal twice as a freshman
last year, scoring 23 points in each of the
teams' meetings. Junior guard Lodrick
Stewart contributes 12.4 points per game.
USC should be able to out-run the Car
dinal. but Stanford's forwards will look to
take advantage of theTVojans' small lineup,
which essentially consists of four guards and
a center.
"Every year I look at USC and wait and
see when everything is going to click togeth
er for them," Hernandez said."l don't think
it has ever been a question of their talent

and their ability,
but more of
their ability to
get it together
and work the
right way for
them to be suc
cessful. I think
they've been
able to do that
this year."

win eight of
their next nine Pac-10 games.
Head coach Trent Johnson said that the
second half of the game against the Trojans
marked the turning point in the Cardinal's
season.
"I feel at that time our guys said/Hey, we
really have to defend, we really have to re
bound, we really have to play with a sense of
urgency,"' Johnson said at TUesday press
conference. "Since then. I feel that we've
done that."
The Pac-10 leading Bruins (22-6,12-4)
will present a similar challenge on Satur
day. Like USC, UCLA is led by two
skilled sophomore guards, Arron Afflalo
and Jordan Farmar, who rank seventh and
10th in Pac-10 in scoring, respectively.The
UCLA duo is considered a more com
plete pair though than USC's tandem
however — Afflalo and Farmar are
among the conference's top defenders
and Farmar dishes out a conference-best
5.4 assists per game.
UCLA has started to return to its former
glory days despite losing sophomore Josh
Shipp, who averaged 11.3 points before he
was sidelined with a hip injury. The Bruins
have received a big boost from freshman
forward Luc Mbah a Moute, who averages
8.8 points and 8.5 rebounds per game.
As always, the Cardinal will rely on Her
nandez, Haryasz and Grunfeld. ITie senior
trio has carried the offensive burden this
season, combining to score 65 percent of the
team's points. They led a young team
through a rocky preseason and strong
league showing, and Hernandez has often
bailed out the squad.

THE FORECAST
Tht s weekend could be vital to the life of the Cardinal .season, as it could be Stanford's last
chance to secure and NCAA Tourney bid. The Trojans have recently struggled but (heir 17-10
record proves they can be a formidable struggle on the courts. UCLA provides an even greater
challenge as the 22-6 team leads the Vac-10 conference. However the emotions involved in
Stanford's final season home stand could propel the Cardinal to victory this weekend.

Senior point guard Chris Hernandez has made 123 three-pointers in his Stanford career. He and
three other seniors will likely play their last games in Maples this weekend.
