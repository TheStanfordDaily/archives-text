# The
						end of the NFL as we know it
## 
### 
Welcome to the end of the
world, sports fans. Or as
ESPN.com NFL writer Len
Pasquarelli has dubbed it, "Bloody
Thursday."
The NFL, the undisputed king of
the American sports scene, is head
ing towards a monumental labor cri
sis at breakneck speed, and few fans
— and apparently even fewer insid
ers— saw it coming. Negotiations
on the league's collective bargaining
agreement (CBA) between the head
of the league Players' Association,
Gene Upshaw, and league Commis
sioner Paul Tagliabue have stalled,
and if a last-minute meeting today
doesn't deliver an accord, the conse
quences for your favorite team could
be drastic.
The disparities between the posi
tions of the league and its players
arose, unsurprisingly, over money.
Essentially, the players want a bigger
piece of the pie, and the owners don't
want to give it to them. Big surprise,
right?
To be fair, the players probably
have a point. Among professional
athletes in the four major sports, they
are the most underpaid. With an av
erage career length of under five
years and contracts that aren't guar
anteed (i.e. a player doesn't receive
the remaining salary on his contract
after he's cut) there's no question
that the average NFL player has
been getting the short end of the
stick for years.
Trying to explain the jargon sur
rounding the CBA collapse would be
about as interesting as watching
Bode Miller lose another event, so
let's just say you'd notice the results.
The salary cap would effectively be
reduced from its expected amount
next season, before disappearing al
together in 2007. And frankly, NFL
execs just don't know how to deal
with the uncertainty of it all.
The chaos has already begun, as a
handful of teams began dumping
veteran contracts yesterday. Among
those now on the free-agent market
are Carolina Panthers running back
Stephen Davis, Buffalo Bills safety
Lawyer Milloy, and two Denver
Bronco studs — defensive end
Trevor Pryce and running back Mike
Anderson. All still had the potential
to be solid role players, if not stars,
for the teams that cut them, and if no
agreement is reached, this may be
