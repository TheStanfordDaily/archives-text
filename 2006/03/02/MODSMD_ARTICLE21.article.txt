# The 						end of the NFL as we know it
## 
### 
Welcome to the end of the
world, sports fans. Or as
ESPN.com NFL writer Len
Pasquarelli has dubbed it, "Bloody
Thursday."
The NFL, the undisputed king of
the American sports scene, is head
ing towards a monumental labor cri
sis at breakneck speed, and few fans
— and apparently even fewer insid
ers— saw it coming. Negotiations
on the league's collective bargaining
agreement (CBA) between the head
of the league Players' Association,
Gene Upshaw, and league Commis
sioner Paul Tagliabue have stalled,
and if a last-minute meeting today
doesn't deliver an accord, the conse
quences for your favorite team could
be drastic.
The disparities between the posi
tions of the league and its players
arose, unsurprisingly, over money.
Essentially, the players want a bigger
piece of the pie, and the owners don't
want to give it to them. Big surprise,
right?
To be fair, the players probably
have a point. Among professional
athletes in the four major sports, they
are the most underpaid. With an av
erage career length of under five
years and contracts that aren't guar
anteed (i.e. a player doesn't receive
the remaining salary on his contract
after he's cut) there's no question
that the average NFL player has
been getting the short end of the
stick for years.
Trying to explain the jargon sur
rounding the CBA collapse would be
about as interesting as watching
Bode Miller lose another event, so
let's just say you'd notice the results.
The salary cap would effectively be
reduced from its expected amount
next season, before disappearing al
together in 2007. And frankly, NFL
execs just don't know how to deal
with the uncertainty of it all.
The chaos has already begun, as a
handful of teams began dumping
veteran contracts yesterday. Among
those now on the free-agent market
are Carolina Panthers running back
Stephen Davis, Buffalo Bills safety
Lawyer Milloy, and two Denver
Bronco studs — defensive end
Trevor Pryce and running back Mike
Anderson. All still had the potential
to be solid role players, if not stars,
for the teams that cut them, and if no
agreement is reached, this may be


Denis
Griffin
Rants and Raves
just the beginning.
Ironically, the death of the CBA
— which is responsible for maintain
ing the salary cap — could lead to
even greater parity initially, rather
than a return to the uncapped years
when more wealthy and aggressive
owners dominated the free-agency
market. Because only the teams over
the current salary cap of $95 million
would be immediately affected by a
breakdown in negotiations, in gener
al, the competitive franchise's loss
would be the rebuilding team's gain.
For instance, the Washington
Redskins, who believed themselves
to be on the cusp of Super Bowl con
tention, could now be forced to make
a return to the cellar just to meet the
unchanged cap that could result if
today's meeting doesn't go well.
Meanwhile, rebuilding teams like the

Cleveland Browns, estimated to be
$21.5 million under the cap according
to ESPN, could now have a lot more
veteran players to choose from this
off-season.
So what does this mean for you as
a fan? Well, maybe nothing... yet. If
your favorite team is somewhere be
tween the financial extremes of the
Redskins and Browns, you might see
relatively little change. But this new
labor angst might be a catastrophic
sign for the future of sports.
After all, if the reputedly harmo
nious NFL can't work out its labor
situation, there's no hope for the fu
ture of the more contentious situa
tions in baseball, hockey and basket
ball which have all dealt with this sort
of thing far more recently. Football
hasn't faced any real labor strife since
1987, and that may have been one
reason for its continued rise to domi
nance in the United States. If the
league doesn't work out its differ
ences soon, this blissful streak will be
effectively over.
Worse still, there's suddenly a lot

more behind the current disputes
than the traditional players v. owners
war for cash. Now, underlying rev
enue-sharing issues — similar to
those faced by Major League Base
ball — have bubbled to the surface,
creating tension among the owners.
Under the current arrangement,
much of the NFL's revenue is shared
evenly among all franchises. But now,
small market owners want the rest to
be evenly distributed as well, and like
Yankees owner George Steinbren
ner, the bigger market owners are
dead set against it.
One thing is for certain: if a deal
doesn't get done tomorrow, it will be
a huge black eye for a league man
agement system that's received
strictly positive attention in recent
years. But in the world of multi-mil
lionaire athletes and owners, all good
things must come to an end.
At the very least, the next few
weeks should be highly entertainingA

erage career length of under five
years and contracts that aren't guar
anteed (i.e. a player doesn't receive
the remaining salary on his contract
after he's cut) there's no question
that the average NFL player has
been getting the short end of the
stick for years.
Trying to explain the jargon sur
rounding the CBA collapse would be
about as interesting as watching
Bode Miller lose another event, so
let's just say you'd notice the results.
The salary cap would effectively be
reduced from its expected amount
next season, before disappearing al
together in 2007. And frankly, NFL
execs just don't know how to deal
with the uncertainty of it all.
The chaos has already begun, as a
handful of teams began dumping
veteran contracts yesterday. Among
those now on the free-agent market
are Carolina Panthers running back
Stephen Davis, Buffalo Bills safety
Lawyer Milloy, and two Denver
Bronco studs — defensive end
Trevor Pryce and running back Mike
Anderson. All still had the potential
to be solid role players, if not stars,
for the teams that cut them, and if no
agreement is reached, this may be

just the beginning.
Ironically, the death of the CBA
— which is responsible for maintain
ing the salary cap — could lead to
even greater parity initially, rather
than a return to the uncapped years
when more wealthy and aggressive
owners dominated the free-agency
market. Because only the teams over
the current salary cap of $95 million
would be immediately affected by a
breakdown in negotiations, in gener
al, the competitive franchise's loss
would be the rebuilding team's gain.
For instance, the Washington
Redskins, who believed themselves
to be on the cusp of Super Bowl con
tention, could now be forced to make
a return to the cellar just to meet the
unchanged cap that could result if
today's meeting doesn't go well.
Meanwhile, rebuilding teams like the

Cleveland Browns, estimated to be
$21.5 million under the cap according
to ESPN, could now have a lot more
veteran players to choose from this
off-season.
So what does this mean for you as
a fan? Well, maybe nothing... yet. If
your favorite team is somewhere be
tween the financial extremes of the
Redskins and Browns, you might see
relatively little change. But this new
labor angst might be a catastrophic
sign for the future of sports.
After all, if the reputedly harmo
nious NFL can't work out its labor
situation, there's no hope for the fu
ture of the more contentious situa
tions in baseball, hockey and basket
ball which have all dealt with this sort
of thing far more recently. Football
hasn't faced any real labor strife since
1987, and that may have been one
reason for its continued rise to domi
nance in the United States. If the
league doesn't work out its differ
ences soon, this blissful streak will be
effectively over.
Worse still, there's suddenly a lot

more behind the current disputes
than the traditional players v. owners
war for cash. Now, underlying rev
enue-sharing issues — similar to
those faced by Major League Base
ball — have bubbled to the surface,
creating tension among the owners.
Under the current arrangement,
much of the NFL's revenue is shared
evenly among all franchises. But now,
small market owners want the rest to
be evenly distributed as well, and like
Yankees owner George Steinbren
ner, the bigger market owners are
dead set against it.
One thing is for certain: if a deal
doesn't get done tomorrow, it will be
a huge black eye for a league man
agement system that's received
strictly positive attention in recent
years. But in the world of multi-mil
lionaire athletes and owners, all good
things must come to an end.
At the very least, the next few
weeks should be highly entertainingA
