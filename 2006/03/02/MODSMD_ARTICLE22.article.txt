### CHRISTIAN TORRES STAFF WRITER 
Neither rain, wind nor a difficult
course could stop the Stanford men's
golf team as it continued building
spring-season momentum with a third
place finish at the Ashworth Colle
giate Invitational, Feb. 27-28. Hosted
by Southern California, the tourna
ment featured a number of top-ranked
teams, but the unranked Cardinal
proved they could compete.
"The guys feel good about how they
played," head coach Conrad Ray said.
"But they also feel like they could play
better. We came down to try to win,
and we were close but not quite there.
But still it's definitely a marked im
provement. and the guys did a really
good job and I'm excited about it."
Before the Ashworth, the squad
had taken fifth in its first tournament
of the spring season, the Hawaii-host
ed Hilo Intercollegiate Invitational.
The Cardinal had a disappointing fall,
but coming to the North Ranch Golf
Course in West Lake Village. Calif., the
squad expected to prove its potential
against a strong field.The team did,
placing higher than No. 5 UCLA,
No. 6 Brigham Young and No. 23
Washington (who placed tied for
fourth, sixth and eighth, respective
ly)-
Other than presenting strong
competition, though, the Ashworth
presented a challenging, tight
course with few drivers and small
greens. However, foul weather be
came an issue as there was heavy
wind and rain on the first day.
The Cardinal dealt with the
weather and moved on to capitalize
from the downfall of many other
teams. After a six-over-par (290)
first round, the team had only three
more strokes in the second as con
ditions worsened.
"We made our move shooting
nine-over in the second round,
while some of the leaders went
much higher than that," Ray said.
"It was good to see the team stick
with it despite the weather condi
tions."
Sophomore Rob Grube agreed
that the Cardinal made the best of
the situation.
"I think a number of players
gave up, but our guys never gave in,
and we picked up a lot of strokes on
the field because of our positive at
titude," he said.
The second round's finish was
postponed to Ttiesday because of
the weather. Stanford was in eight,
heading into what was a much
clearer day, but with its second
round total of 293 and third-round

290 the Cardinal moved up the
rankings and clinched third.
"It was just a good team effort,"
Ray said. "Every guy had a good
contribution to the team score and
did well."
In particular, junior Zack Miller
led the Cardinal in their strong fin
ish with a three-under-par (68)
third round and placed an impres
sive second individually, tying his
career-high.
"I was really happy with my fin
ish," Miller said. "It's nice to see my
game improve as the season has
gone on. My short game kept me
going, and I owe everything this
week to it."
Grube also performed well.
After placing 39th at the Hilo, the
usual team leader made a come
back with a sixth-place finish this
week. Despite his better play at the
Ashworth, Grube felt he could do
better.
"If I had putted better I could
have had a run at the title," he said.
"I have a lot of things to work on
before the next tournament."
The Cardinal next travel to
Santa Cruz, Calif, for the Western
Intercollegiate, Mar. 27-28. Despite
the event still being a month away,
the men feel they can continue the
momentum they have built and
continue to gain the confidence re
quired to compete with the best.
"1 feel like we've approached
things the right way all year but you
can't control the results," Ray said.
"As long we focus on the process, I
feel really good about our chances
as we head toward the spring. I
think the guys are realizing their
roles on the team, they're working
on their weaknesses, and I think
we're just continuing to improve."
