# A 						visit south of the border
## No. 13 women's golf travels to Guadalajara Mexico to face Berkeley rivals 
### CARSON COOPER 
Once you've competed in a tournament spon
sored by Hooters, you would think that things could
n't get any more unusual. However, the Stanford
women's golf squad's strange odyssey continues as it
travels to Guadalajara, Mexico, next week.
The No. 13 Cardinal plan to compete in the Cal-
Guadalajara Invitational, hosted by the Golden
Bears, starting Monday. The tournament will take
place at the Guadalajara Country Club Golf Course,
a prestigious private club in Mexico's second oldest
city, and a course that was rated 14th in the country.
The location of the tournament seems odd, espe
cially considering that Cardinal's Bay Area rivals
are hosting the tourney, the first women's golf event
the school has ever hosted. Most foreign-destination
tournaments take place in tourist destinations such
as Cancun or Puerto Vallarta, rather than an indus
trialized Mexican city of over two million residents.
Nevertheless, the Central Mexico city is known
for its golf. 2(X)2 LPGA Rookie of the Year Lorena
Ochoa hails from Guadalajara, and the city often
sends young golfers to American universities.
Ochoa competed for Arizona before turning pro.
The tournament will be a homecoming for Cal
ifornia senior and Guadalajara native Sophia
Sheridan.

The tourna
ment is set to fea
ture No. 2 Arizona
State, winner of
the past two tour
naments Stanford
has entered.
Arizona State
will be led by
freshman Aza
hara Munoz, the
Spanish import

the squad was led by individual medalist Husted.
Since Stanford's last tournament, the team had
"heavily intensive short game practices," said head
coach Caroline O'Connor. Stanford leads the nation
