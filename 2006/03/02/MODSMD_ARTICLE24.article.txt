# Stanford achieves high APR from NCAA

### 
Stanford received NCAA Public Recognition
Awards in 11 of its sports, after the NCAA's Acade
mic Progress Rates (APR) were released yesterday.
Exemplary academic performance from Stanford
student-athletes is the norm, and Stanford continued
to set an example. Cardinal teams that earned the
award were football, men's and women's volleyball,
men's and women's gymnastics, women's water polo,
women's swimming, women's golf, women's fencing,
men's tennis and wrestling. The teams in the top 10
percent in terms of APR were recognized.
Stanford football was one of just five Division I
football programs which earned the honor. The oth
ers were Auburn, Boston College, Duke and Navy.
Academic Progress Rates are set according to
each individual team â€” not the school. Two points
are given each term to student-athletes who have
met academic-eligibility standards and are still en
rolled in the college or university. Those points are

then divided by the total possible points for each
team. The APR is part of the NCAA's academic re
form instituted in 2(X)2. If schools continue to under
perform, they could face postseason bans in 2007-
2008.
No major national programs had scholarship cuts
in major sports because of the latest APR numbers.
Among the programs on the bubble due to poor
scholastic performance are Cal Poly, Kansas State,
Florida A&M and several schools in the Mid Ameri
can Conference in the Midwest.
This year's APR data showed improvement, as
the number of Division I sports teams potentially
losing scholarships went down from 350 last year to
99 this year. Last year, APR results were used to
warn schools of possible scholarship losses, and this
year the punishment was enforced.
Ninety of the 99 teams sanctioned were men's
squads.
