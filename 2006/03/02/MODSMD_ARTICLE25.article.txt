## Future looks bright for Card Lopez twins resemble former set of Stanford siblings on the court 
### SAMUEL CHEN STAFF WRITER 
The regular season is nearing a close for the 2005-06
Stanford men's basketball team, and so the time has
come to take an early look toward the future. By all ac
counts, it looks to be an exciting one.
A big — literally and figuratively — reason for this is
the incoming class, which is highlighted by twin big men
Brook and Robin Lopez.TWo of the most decorated bas
ketball recruits of all-time for the Cardinal, the Lopez
brothers are expected to have an immediate impact on
the court once they reach the Farm. Currently playing the
last games of their senior seasons, the identical twins have
helped lead San Joaquin Memorial High School in Fres
no, Calif., to a 30-3 record and chance for the division
state title.
Both seven footers, the Lopezes strongly resemble a
set of twins that took to the hardwood and formed a for
midable frontcourt for the Card from 1997-2001: Jarron
and Jason Collins, both of whom are currently in the
NBA.
After the announcement of the McDonald's High
School Ail-American squad last week. Brook and Robin
are the first Stanford recruits named to the prestigious
national all-star team since the Collins twins finished
their senior season at Harvard-Westlake in southern Cal
ifornia and were named to the team.
Winter and spring are often extremely busy for bas
ketball recruiting, though not for most of the top recruits
in the nation, who are recruited heavily since the start of
their high school careers and are offered scholarships by
their junior year. Brook and Robin fell into this later cat
egory, though head coach Trent Johnson did not have to
do much convincing. Their mother. Deborah Ledford.
was a 1971 Stanford graduate and Cardinal athlete her
self (a swimmer), the twins figured out early in their
childhood where they wanted to attend college.

Johnson, who recruited the Collins twins to the Farm
during his tenure as an assistant coach at Stanford, took
the initiative to bring another set of big men to the Farm
during his first year as head coach, closing the deal start
ed by Mike Montgomery.
Brook and Robin have long expressed the comfort
and familiarity they feel on campus and the recruiting
process was almost formality after the twins' athletic and
academic success put them in prime position to attend
their dream school.
After verbally committing to the Cardinal as high
school juniors in February 2005, the two signed official
national letters of intent with Stanford last November.
Though the twins' high school stats won't jump out at
you as the most outstanding you've seen — considering
the acclaim they have received — those close to the
school would say that this is due to the guard-dominated
offense of their prep team. Still, with a new coach in their
senior season. Brook, who plays power forward, is aver
aging 13.5 points per game, 7.0 rebounds per game and
2.5 blocks per game, shooting 67 percent from the field.
Robin, a center who prefers to stay closer to the basket, is
averaging 10.4,8.K, and 5.7 in the same categories on 66
percent shooting.
The Lopezes' athleticism and overall potential are
judged as outstanding. The intangibles they display on
the court further justify ranking Brook the No. 2 power
forward and Robin the No. 4 center in the nation, accord

As part of a traveling AAU team, the Lopez twins led
the Fresno-based Elite Basketball Organization to a 36-4
record over the summer. The previous summer. Brook
was named the MVP of Las Vegas' Adidas Super 64 Invi
tational, scoring 14 points in the title-clinching game
against a team featuring 2004 NBA first-round draft
picks Dwight Howard and Josh Smith.
Next season, these two are expected to contribute to
the Cardinal frontcourt — and possibly even start by sea
son's end. The twins say they relish to the opportunity.
"I'm very excited to come to Stanford and play bas
ketball," said Brook Lopez in the press conference when
he officially signed with the Cardinal. "It's a great envi
