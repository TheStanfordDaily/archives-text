## Health, low-fat diets not linked Women's Health Initiative reports that shopping low-fat may be pointless 
### KATHERINE COX STAFF WRITER 
In February, the Women's Health Initiative (WHI)
published surprising findings that bewildered avid pur
suers of low-fat labels in supermarkets.The organization's
lengthy clinical trial concluded that a low-fat diet does not
significantly improve health or prevent cancer and heart
disease.
Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Insti
tute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
WHI launched its 12-year clinical trial in 1993, administe
ring a low-diet plan to 40 percent of the participants while
the other 60 percent continued their usual diets.
" The hypothesis that a low-fat dietary pattern can re
duce breast cancer risk has existed for decades but has
never been tested in a controlled intervention trial," cited
the article, published in the Journal of the American Med
ical Association on February Bth.
After collecting the health studies of 48,835 women
from clinics all over the nation, the study concluded that a
low-fat diet, contrary to common assumptions, did not de
crease the possibility for fatal health risks. Marcia Stefan
ick of the Stanford Prevention Research Center heads
one of such WHI clinics at Stanford. Her research team
has contributed data to the WHI trial since 1994, amassing
data about 1,350 women total.
However. WHI investigators made clear on their Web
site that the effect of a low fat diet is not entirely negligi
ble. Stefanick pointed out that many participants reduced
total fat by replacing dietary fats with commercial low-fat
products that have little nutritional value, which may lead
to adverse health effects.
"Both the cancer and heart disease results might have
been quite different if more women had replaced fats with

nutrient-dense vegetables, such as dark, leafy greens and
cruciferous vegetables, e.g. broccoli or cauliflower, and
high fiber foods, and for heart disease, they should have
reduced saturated and trans fats, not just total fat intake,"
she said.
According to the WHI Web site, although a low fat diet
may indeed be a legitimate approach to reducing the risk
of breast cancer in older women,"the current findings are
not strong enough to make a recommendation that most
women should focus on low-fat dietary patterns to pre
vent breast cancer." According to the study's results, a
low-fat diet is not seen as an appropriate measure to
adopt in hopes of preventing colorectal cancer or heart
disease, although, in general, it is not detrimental in the
least.
Although the trials are now completed and the WHI
Clinical Centers are no longer doing interventional stud
ies, WHI is conducting an extension study, in which the
health outcomes of former study participants will be mon
itored for five more years. Stefanick anticipates that her
research team will continue to follow about 3,800 women
at Stanford through 2010.
Sophomore Molly Goldstein responded to the study's
conclusions.
"Having learned about the study's results. I'm not going
to change my diet. One reason is that I'm not a post
menopausal woman which was the group tested by the
trial," she said, 'if you ate lots of fatty foods in your young
adulthood it could very well cause heart disease later in life.
"Plus I'm not really looking to eat a lot of potato
chips," she added.
Sophomore Jenna Schmidt also felt it was unnecessary
to alter her eating habits in light of the new findings.
"It's my feeling that there are so many new diets com
ing out all the time, likp Atkins, for instance, that I don't re
ally pay attention to any of the studies," she said. "In gen
eral, I think you should eat a balanced diet in healthy pro
portions because its also a life style choice you can main
tain for the rest of your life."
