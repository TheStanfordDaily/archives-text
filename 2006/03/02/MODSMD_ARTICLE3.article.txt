# AFTER STANFORD
## Poll shows that size does matter Increasing number of graduates prefer small-mid size companies 
### ADAM WIDMAN STAFF WRITER 
Undergraduates seeking jobs generally pre
fer sniall-or medium-sized employers to larger
corporations when they leave college, according
to a recent poll on the student career Web site
CollegeGrad.com.
The poll gathered the responses of about 500
students nationwide, and 70 percent of respon
dents said they preferred small to medium sized
employers, while 30 percent said they would pre
fer a large employer.
According to the Web site, the results of the
poll defied common industry expectations.
"This feedback is contrary to the generally
held view that college graduates only want to
work for Fortune 500 or Global 1000 compa
nies," said Brian Krueger, president of College-
Grad.com. "Not only are college grads interest
ed in small and medium size companies, they
prefer them."
Employers cited a variety of rea
sons for the poll's findings. Some la
beled the results as a response to in
creasing uncertainties associated
with large employers, while others
said they were an indication that the
market is experiencing a new gener
ation of job seekers.
"Today's graduates have seen the
cyclical nature of the global and na
tional economies," said Steven Jung
man, division director for Chas
e Source, LP, in a press release.
"Terms like 'downsizing,' 'fur
loughs' and 'mass-layoffs' are now a
part of everyone's vocabulary and
are typically associated with larger
firms."
Heidi Hanisko, the director of
client services at CollegeGrad.com,
said that the poll's results were re
flective of a generational shift.
"The significance is that the re
sults represent a change in the pref
erence that Generation X had of
chasing the giant paycheck typically
associated with large international
firms, to Generation Y's (also
known as the Millennial Genera
tion) preference to work for smaller
companies," she said.
When asked for their prefer
ences about employer size, Stanford
seniors were split between large and
small-medium sized companies.
Joanne Gan, an economics and
international relations major, said
she would prefer a large employer
due to her special needs as a foreign
student.
"I am an international student,
and in order to get a work visa I
need to be employed by a company
which will sponsor me," she said.
"Typically, only large companies do
this."
Gan added that large companies
can offer graduates opportunities
that small or medium sized compa
nies cannot.
"I would want a strong name on
my resume," Gan added. "Further
more. large companies tend to have
many new employees, so social op

portunities would be good, and
training programs would be well es
tablished."
Ratul Narain, an engineering
major, said he too would prefer to
work for a large employer, citing the
prestige and resources of many
large companies.
"Large companies have better
security, more resources, and a bet
ter name," he said. "These are some
of the same reasons 1 chose a larger,
well-known university over a small
er liberal arts college."
Narain added that he would pre
fer to work for a small company in
the more distant future.
"I'd like to work for a start-up
sometime in the next ten years," he
said.
Students who said they preferred
smaller companies indicated their
desire to be more involved with
their future employer than is often
possible at large companies.
"At a [small or medium sized]
company, a greater opportunity ex
ists for creative control over a proj
ect in an entry-level position," said
Saahir Khan, a history major.
Cyrus Chee, also a history major,
said that he would prefer the more
comfortable atmosphere of a small
company.
"If I were forced to choose, I'd
probably choose a small company
because it would be more personal,
friendly and intimate," he said. "I'd
get more attention and develop a
stronger network."
