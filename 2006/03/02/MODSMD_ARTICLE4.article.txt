## Scholar pilots innovation journalism 
### LAURA CARWILE STAFF WRITER 
Everyone has his or her favorite
section of the morning newspaper.
Be it sports or finance, one can al
ways count on an entire spread de
voted solely to one's topic of choice.
Now, it appears, a new section may
be in the works, as David Nordfors, a
senior research scholar at the Stan
ford Center for Innovations in
Learning (SCIL), is spearheading a
new program devoted to the fusion

between technology and business.
The program, deemed Innovation
Journalism, gives seven Swedish and
Finnish journalists the opportunity to
spend the next seven months interning
in top U.S. newsrooms working on
what Nordfors has titled the "Innova
tion" beat.
But many readers, especially
those not in touch with the increasing
synthesis of technology and business,
may be wondering what exactly the
Innovation section will feature.
"Today, innovation is the main

source for driving society forward
and creating wealth, but large parts
of the news media are struggling with
the coverage of it," Nordfors wrote in
an e-mail to The Daily. "Innovation is
a cross-disciplinary thing, bringing
together techies, business people and
others to challenge the silo-type or
ganizations that keep people from
different work areas apart.
"Innovation thrives on the meet
ing between cultures," he added.
