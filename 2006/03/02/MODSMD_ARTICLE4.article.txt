# BUSINESS & TECH
## Scholar pilots innovation journalism 
### LAURA CARWILE STAFF WRITER 
Everyone has his or her favorite
section of the morning newspaper.
Be it sports or finance, one can al
ways count on an entire spread de
voted solely to one's topic of choice.
Now, it appears, a new section may
be in the works, as David Nordfors, a
senior research scholar at the Stan
ford Center for Innovations in
Learning (SCIL), is spearheading a
new program devoted to the fusion

between technology and business.
The program, deemed Innovation
Journalism, gives seven Swedish and
Finnish journalists the opportunity to
spend the next seven months interning
in top U.S. newsrooms working on
what Nordfors has titled the "Innova
tion" beat.
But many readers, especially
those not in touch with the increasing
synthesis of technology and business,
may be wondering what exactly the
Innovation section will feature.
"Today, innovation is the main

source for driving society forward
and creating wealth, but large parts
of the news media are struggling with
the coverage of it," Nordfors wrote in
an e-mail to The Daily. "Innovation is
a cross-disciplinary thing, bringing
together techies, business people and
others to challenge the silo-type or
ganizations that keep people from
different work areas apart.
"Innovation thrives on the meet
ing between cultures," he added.
"and some places in the world, Stan
ford and the Silicon Valley among
them, offer proof of that."
But why not simply let technolo
gy or business journalists write
about innovation issues?
"The newsrooms are often silos
themselves," Nordfors said. "Who
can write a story that crosses the
traditional news beats of technolo
gy, business, culture and politics?
Which editor will edit such a story?
Which news section should it be
published in?
"Industry has changed," he
added. "It is no longer first the
techies who invent something, be
fore handing it over to the business
crowd to sell it. Co-development of
matching technology and business
models, interacting with societal
trends — often innovations in
themselves — is becoming key."
Nordfors offered a real world ex
ample, one that many college stu
dents can identify with.
"The iPod is a good example," he
said. "Apple putting a hard disk in an
MP3 player and selling music on the
Internet for a dollar a tune were not

major innovations in themselves.
They were co-developed compo
nents, a matching technology and
business model resulting in a major
innovation: a legal way to sell and
distribute music on the Internet."
An article about the collabora
tion between the iPod and the
iTUnes Music Store, Nordfors be
lieves, would fit nicely under the
heading "Innovation."
"Which publication can cover the
big picture of the Apple/i Pod story in
their daily news reporting?" Nord
fors asked. "Is it a tech story, a busi
ness story or a culture and music
story? It's all of them together, and
above all, it is a story about innova
tion, the introduction of a new con
cept."
Nordfors admits that some have
expressed skepticism toward his
idea.
"Some journalists share my view
that Innovation is valid as a news
beat," he said, "but others think of it
more as a mindset within the tradi
tional beats. [But] if enough jour
nalists want it to be a beat, it will be
a beat."
Nordfors believes the fellowship
program with Scandinavian jour
nalists is integral to getting his idea
of an Innovation beat off the
ground.
"The idea of the [fellowship]

program is to co-develop the con
cept and community of innovation
journalism," he said. "[lt] brings to
gether senior journalists from dif
ferent beats and different countries
who share an interest in reporting
on innovation."
Working with Nordfors is TUro
Uskali, who will be at the Stanford
Center for Innovations in Learn
ing during the coming year.
Uskali, a finance journalist for 10
years, recently started the first un
dergraduate course in Innovation
Journalism at the University of Jy
vaskyla in Finland, where he is an
assistant professor.
"While here [Uskali and I] will
be looking more into how to build
up the concept and community of
innovation journalism and identify
ing research questions concerning
the role of journalism in innovation
systems," Nordfors said.
The seven fellows will present
their work during a conference held
from April 5 to 7 in Tresidder Union.
Nordfors said that he is confi
dent that an innovation beat will be
a landmark in the future of report
ing.
"It is a challenging task, but the
industry is already there, and the rest
of society, including journalism, will
follow," he said. "I see it as an enor
mous opportunity for journalism."
