# ADVANCED PLACEMENT SCIENCE COURSES UNDER REVIEW
## APs Put to the Test Students, faculty discuss the role of Advanced Placement tests at Stanford 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
A five on an Advanced Placement (AP) exam is sup
posed to be equivalent of an A in a college class, but schol
ars at J larvard and the University of Virginia recently pre
sented research suggesting that a high score on an AP sci
ence exam does not guarantee success in its corresponding
introductory science course in college.
In 2000, Associate Registrar Paddy McGowan exam

ined the relationship between AP credit and grades at
Stanford. Her findings revealed that Biology 41 students
who took AP Biology and/or A P Chemistry received much
higher grades than students who had not taken the AP
exam(s). Forty-four percent of AP students earned As in
the class, compared to 18 percent of non-AP students.
"1 thought it was really quite striking," said Biology De
partment Chair Robert Simoni. "There needs to be an ex
planation."
At Stanford, undergraduates can use up to 45 units of
AP credit toward the I NO units required to graduate. How
ever, not all departments grant credit or placement for high
AP scores.
University Registrar Roger Printup said that credit is

granted for AP scores when the AP class' content seems to
be the equivalent of a Stanford course.
"As long as individual departments consider the AP
exam in their subject area to be the equivalent of a course
or courses taught at Stanford, 1 believe that we will contin
ue to take credit for those exams," Print up said.
He added that individual departments decide whether
to grant credit for high AP scores. This decision is usually
made after consultation with the Dean's Office of either
the School of Humanities and Sciences or the School of
Engineering.
Chemistry Prof. Chris Chidsey currently teaches Chem
istry 31A and 318.
"It seems that strong scores on the Chemistry AP
[test] are evidence of a good preparation for chemistry,"
he said. "The chemistry AP is better aligned with the in
troductory chemistry classes than might be the case in
some other disciplines."
Some students, however, said they found important
differences between their high school chemistry classes
and those offered at Stanford.
"Chem 3IX had a much greater emphasis on mathe
matical concepts," said freshman Christian Torres."]lt
was] less of an overview [than AP Chemistry] and more
of zeroing in on specific concepts."
Stacey Kang, also a freshman, added that while the
course content of Chemistry 31X correlated well to the
AP Chemistry class, the college test questions were pre
sented in a very different manner than those in high
school.
freshman Thinh Nguyen Due said that he knew a lot
of students "who did really well on the AP chem test but
are struggling with Chem 318 right now."
The Biology Department, on the other hand, decided
to stop offering credit or placement for high AP biology
test scores after the 2003-2004 academic year.
For his part, Simoni said that he disagreed with the de

cision.
"I took the AP test," he said. "It's really good, I think,
and it's hard. The format is different from the tests we
give, but for many things, the same level of understanding
is expected. So I think the AP Biology courses are really
good. I think it's college level material and Stanford
ought to give credit."
Simoni added that while students have, in the past, re
ceived credit for their AP Biology test scores, the depart
ment has never allowed students to place out of courses.
"There's one really predominant reason for that, and
it has nothing to do with the level at which the AP mate
rial is learned," he said. "We want to make sure all of our
students going into the upper division have the same
preparation, and AP preparation is not particularly well
suited to our upper division.
"It's not because we didn't think the AP material was
good material,"he continued."lt just didn't resonate with
our curriculum particularly well."
Freshman Douglas Stanford compared AP Physics to
the physics classes he has taken so far at the University.
"Maybe [a high AP Physics test score is] a substitute
for the 40s series," he said."But it's not a substitute for the
60s series because in college there's just a different way of
approaching the problems."
