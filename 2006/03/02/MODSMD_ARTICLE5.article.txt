# ADVANCED PLACEMENT SCIENCE COURSES UNDER REVIEW
## APs Put to the Test Students, faculty discuss the role of Advanced Placement tests at Stanford 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
A five on an Advanced Placement (AP) exam is sup
posed to be equivalent of an A in a college class, but schol
ars at J larvard and the University of Virginia recently pre
sented research suggesting that a high score on an AP sci
ence exam does not guarantee success in its corresponding
introductory science course in college.
In 2000, Associate Registrar Paddy McGowan exam

ined the relationship between AP credit and grades at
Stanford. Her findings revealed that Biology 41 students
who took AP Biology and/or A P Chemistry received much
higher grades than students who had not taken the AP
exam(s). Forty-four percent of AP students earned As in
the class, compared to 18 percent of non-AP students.
"1 thought it was really quite striking," said Biology De
partment Chair Robert Simoni. "There needs to be an ex
planation."
At Stanford, undergraduates can use up to 45 units of
AP credit toward the I NO units required to graduate. How
ever, not all departments grant credit or placement for high
AP scores.
University Registrar Roger Printup said that credit is

granted for AP scores when the AP class' content seems to
be the equivalent of a Stanford course.
"As long as individual departments consider the AP
exam in their subject area to be the equivalent of a course
or courses taught at Stanford, 1 believe that we will contin
ue to take credit for those exams," Print up said.
He added that individual departments decide whether
to grant credit for high AP scores. This decision is usually
made after consultation with the Dean's Office of either
the School of Humanities and Sciences or the School of
Engineering.
