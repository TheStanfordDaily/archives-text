## GSC votes votes on fees ballot Council blocks special fees requests from Daily, ISIS 
### JEFF BARNES 
The Graduate Student Council (GSC) convened last
night to grant funds to various graduate student groups and
to discuss the special fees initiatives that will appear on the
ASSU elections ballot in the spring.
After spending a brief period of time approving funding
for five student groups, the GSC turned to special fees delib
eration, which constituted the bulk of the meeting.
Of the nine groups under consideration for the special
fees ballot, the GSC voted down two: The Stanford Daily
and Innovative Student Information Services (ISlS).These
groups may still appear on the ASSU ballot, but now must
obtain a petition signed by 15 percent of the student body
to get funding as opposed to the 10 percent required for
groups approved by both the Undergraduate Senate and
the GSC.TTiey may also appeal to the Senate for undergrad
uate-only special fees.
There will be approximately seven graduate groups ap
plying for special fees and about 40 undergraduate associa
tions, including a number of joint grad-undergrad items, such
as Flicks.
The GSC discussed the future of Flicks, which will be re
moved from the control of Stanford Student Enterprises
(SSE) due to its poor performance as a business entity. As a
result. Flicks has turned to special fees for funding.
Following the discussion of Flicks, ISIS's request for
$21,(KM) came under review. ISIS provides and monitors
video screens on campus used for free advertising of student
group and University events.
Approximately half of the proposed $21 .(KM) would go to
ward nine additional screens targeted at the graduate popu
lation. While the GSC generally agreed that the screens were
a more effective advertisement medium than fliers or emails.
GSC co-Chair Tom Lee, a fourth year graduate student in
electrical engineering, expressed skepticism.
"$21,000 seems like a waste of money," he said.
Lee, a fourth-year electrical engineering doctoral student,
went on to question the efficiency of this form of advertise
ment.
