## GSC votes votes on fees ballot Council blocks special fees requests from Daily, ISIS 
### JEFF BARNES 
The Graduate Student Council (GSC) convened last
night to grant funds to various graduate student groups and
to discuss the special fees initiatives that will appear on the
ASSU elections ballot in the spring.
After spending a brief period of time approving funding
for five student groups, the GSC turned to special fees delib
eration, which constituted the bulk of the meeting.
Of the nine groups under consideration for the special
fees ballot, the GSC voted down two: The Stanford Daily
and Innovative Student Information Services (ISlS).These
groups may still appear on the ASSU ballot, but now must
obtain a petition signed by 15 percent of the student body
to get funding as opposed to the 10 percent required for
groups approved by both the Undergraduate Senate and
the GSC.TTiey may also appeal to the Senate for undergrad
uate-only special fees.
There will be approximately seven graduate groups ap
plying for special fees and about 40 undergraduate associa
tions, including a number of joint grad-undergrad items, such
as Flicks.
The GSC discussed the future of Flicks, which will be re
moved from the control of Stanford Student Enterprises
(SSE) due to its poor performance as a business entity. As a
result. Flicks has turned to special fees for funding.
Following the discussion of Flicks, ISIS's request for
$21,(KM) came under review. ISIS provides and monitors
video screens on campus used for free advertising of student
group and University events.
Approximately half of the proposed $21 .(KM) would go to
ward nine additional screens targeted at the graduate popu
lation. While the GSC generally agreed that the screens were
a more effective advertisement medium than fliers or emails.
GSC co-Chair Tom Lee, a fourth year graduate student in
electrical engineering, expressed skepticism.
"$21,000 seems like a waste of money," he said.
Lee, a fourth-year electrical engineering doctoral student,
went on to question the efficiency of this form of advertise
ment.

The requested $21,(XX) was voted
down by a narrow 6-5 margin.
The Stanford Daily, which was
also denied placement on the ballot
by the GSC, was the topic of a lengthy
and heated discussion.
On Hiesday, the Senate amended
the special fees contribution to The
Daily from $0 to $31.(XX) in hopes
that the paper would break even
after the subsidy. Following much de

liberation and scrutiny of The Daily's
accounting practices and its associa
tion with the organization Friends of
The Daily, the GSC voted down the
request for $31.(XX).
Alex Ene, a doctoral candidate in
physics, moved to reduce the number
to $20,000, and medical student
Stephen Hunt seconded the motion,
before voting it down along with
seven of the other eleven members. A
second vote to renegotiate the spe
cial fees amount pledged to The
Daily also failed.
Following the conclusion of spe
cial-fees voting, undergraduate sena
tors in attendance brought up an
issue that had arisen at Tuesday's
Senate meeting.

Senator Hershey Avula, a sopho
more, represented the nine senators
who tried to vote down a measure
that would ban endorsements on
ASSU ballots. According to Avula,
senators with an endorsement on the
ballot have historically won seats in
the Senate.
While the measure was approved
last Wednesday at a joint meeting of
the GSC and the Undergraduate
Senate, the senators asked the GSC
to allow reconsideration in light of
the way in which the bill was pro
posed and passed with the joint
meeting. Due to time constraints,
however, the GSC decided to table
the issue, postponing it until its meet
ing next week.
