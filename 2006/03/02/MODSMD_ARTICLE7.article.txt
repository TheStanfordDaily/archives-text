## Center fights Hepatitis B in Asians 
### LESLIE GEORGATOS 
'flicked away in the basement of the Boswell
building of Stanford's Medieal Center is the Asian
Liver Center (ALC), where 20 dedicated interns
and five staff launched their international fight
against the "silent killer," I lepatitis B, among Asian
Americans.
"Although a vaccine for Hepatitis B has existed
for over 20 years, the disease still kills one million

people a year, and infects approximately 10 percent
of Asian-Americans," said Eric Sue, special projects
coordinator for the ALC. "Every day, three times
more people die from Hepatitis B than the entire
SARS outbreak. Ten times more people live with
Hepatitis B than with HIV. The disease has not re
ceived the national attention it deserves."
