## Center fights Hepatitis B in Asians 
### LESLIE GEORGATOS 
'flicked away in the basement of the Boswell
building of Stanford's Medieal Center is the Asian
Liver Center (ALC), where 20 dedicated interns
and five staff launched their international fight
against the "silent killer," I lepatitis B, among Asian
Americans.
"Although a vaccine for Hepatitis B has existed
for over 20 years, the disease still kills one million

people a year, and infects approximately 10 percent
of Asian-Americans," said Eric Sue, special projects
coordinator for the ALC. "Every day, three times
more people die from Hepatitis B than the entire
SARS outbreak. Ten times more people live with
Hepatitis B than with HIV. The disease has not re
ceived the national attention it deserves."
Founded in 19%, the Asian Liver Center is the
only non-profit in the United States dedicated to
fighting the prevalence of Hepatitis Band liver
cancer in Asians and Asian Americans. The Center
began when founder and former liver transplant
surgeon Samuel So walked through the streets of
San Francisco with his secretary, handing out
brochures to passersby. It grew to encompass liver
cancer research, a clinical program where patients
may be tested for Hepatitis Band a thriving out
reach branch that involves Stanford students in its
efforts to educate the public about Hepatitis B.
"Stanford student interns are actually making
an important impact in this global fight," said Sue.
'There is a real opportunity right here at Stanford
to contribute to improving the health of the
world."
The Center's flagship program is the Jade Rib
bon Campaign, launched in 2(X)l.The culturally
targeted multimedia campaign educates Asians
and Asian Americans about the importance of get
ting tests and vaccinations for Hepatitis B. Though
it began locally, the program spread to other Cali
fornia cities, expanded to other states including
Washington and Arizona, and recently went inter
national — with budding operations in China and
the Philippines. Locally, the Jade Ribbon Cam
paign involves billboards in San Francisco, promi
nent advertisements on 1(X) of the 150 of the city's
buses, educational brochures in seven languages
and public service announcements in Chinese,
Vietnamese and Korean.
"We are trying to eradicate this infection, and
we can do it because there is a vaccine " said Sue.
"Essentially, this would help eliminate 80 percent
of liver cancer, the third-leading cause of cancer
death in the world."
In addition to the campaign, ALC staff mem
bers attend medical conferences and educate prac
titioners of traditional Chinese medicine on the
dangers of Hepatitis B. Annual youth conferences
on Stanford Campus help about 140 local students
learn how to spread the word about Hepatitis B in
their hometowns and schools. The Center also co
ordinated Three for Life, a collaboration with the
San Francisco Department of Public Health to pro
vide low-cost HBV screenings and Hepatitis A and
B vaccinations to the San Francisco community.
"1 strongly believe that the arrays of projects we
work on, like planning for youth conferences,
working at booths during community events or giv
ing presentations about Hepatitis B. are making a
difference in the community." said sophomore in
tern Diana Austria. "I see it every time we discuss
Hepatitis B with someone who has never heard of

"With HIV, there's no
vaccine, so we don't have all
the solutions, but with
Hepatitis B we have had the
vaccine for 20 years, so why
aren't we giving it to
everyone in the world?"
SAMUEL SO, founder of ALC

the issue. Often times, they are surprised, curious,
and most of all, grateful."
"As 1 completed projects and saw them put into
action, the great impact of the work that we do in
the community and the changes that we are mak
ing in promoting this public health issue were very
clear," added former intern and current Outreach
Coordinator Sei-Gyung Kim. "There's also an in
credible camaraderie in the office. The standards
and expectations are high, but there is a very sup
portive environment that makes the work fun and
challenging."
LlVERight, a 5-kilometer walk/run which took
place in April 2005 was one such project. Four hun
dred and forty participants raised $51 ,000 by walk
ing or running through Golden Gate Park in San
Francisco. Student volunteers coordinated the
project and manned booths with information on
Hepatitis B for participants and passersby.
"It was an event defined by hard work,sleepless
nights, sacrifice, but above all a love and passion for
the cause in mind," said Austria.
China is the next frontier for the ambitious
Liver Center, which brought the Jade Ribbon
Campaign to two Chinese provinces in 2004. The
country bears the greatest health burden from He
patitis B. with 500,000 people dying in China each
year due to liver failure.
"The problem with other funding for vaccina
tions in China was that it only paid for vaccines and
syringes," said Sue. "No money was provided for

education or for administrative fees for doctors
and nurses to give the vaccine. The vaccines were
not being implemented effectively."
The ALC began its efforts in China by vaccinat
ing 3,500 grade-school children in Sichuan
province, then expanded to two cities in the Guang
Dong province. There, they vaccinated 100,000 stu
dents for free. In addition to vaccines, the ALC pro
vided brochures, posters, and training to the staff of
doctors and nurses at each school. Doctors and
nurses in China also received financial rewards for
effective use of the vaccines.
Interns for 2006-2007 may have the opportuni
ty to go to China and directly oversee implementa
tion of the Center's plans.
"We're dedicated to solving this problem not
only nationally but globally. It's truly tragic that
one million people continue to die every year from
this disease," So said. "With HIV, there's no vac
cine, so we don't have all the solutions. But with
Hepatitis B, we have had the vaccine for twenty
years, so why aren't we giving it to everyone in the
world?"
The ALC has dedicated itself to bridging the
gap between finding vaccines and using these ad
vances to help people. Along the way, it has strug
gled through activism and advocacy to give Hepati
tis B national media attention — over HIV, SARS
or avian flu.
In the United States, Hepatitis B is not a con
cern of the general population, said Dr. So, citing
the one-third percent of the general population in
fection rate, as compared with a staggering 10 per
cent rate for Asian Americans.
"You can't treat the whole population like they
are generic Americans," he said. "If we are going to
improve the health of the whole nation, we must
pay attention to the health disparities in various
populations."
The Asian Liver Center is currently accepting
applications for intern positions as well as for the
positions of outreach coordinator and special proj
ects coordinator. Asian language skills are sought,
but all students are encouraged to apply.
"Since we emphasize outreach so much, it's im
portant for everyone to learn about the effects of
Hepatitis B.even if you're not Asian," Gu said.
"It's a chance to stretch yourself, to learn more
about important issues, and to invest in a really
standout cause that others are not addressing,"
Kim said. "There are many other non-profits
whose interests are divided, or who are focused on
raising money, but the ALC is really keenly focused
on the people, and our director Dr. So never lets us
forget how important that is."

their hometowns and schools. The Center also co

San Francisco Department of Public Health to pro

B vaccinations to the San Francisco community.
"1 strongly believe that the arrays of projects we
work on, like planning for youth conferences,
working at booths during community events or giv

the issue. Often times, they are surprised, curious,
and most of all, grateful."
"As 1 completed projects and saw them put into
action, the great impact of the work that we do in
the community and the changes that we are mak
ing in promoting this public health issue were very
clear," added former intern and current Outreach
Coordinator Sei-Gyung Kim. "There's also an in
credible camaraderie in the office. The standards
and expectations are high, but there is a very sup
portive environment that makes the work fun and
challenging."
LlVERight, a 5-kilometer walk/run which took
place in April 2005 was one such project. Four hun
dred and forty participants raised $51 ,000 by walk
ing or running through Golden Gate Park in San
Francisco. Student volunteers coordinated the
project and manned booths with information on
Hepatitis B for participants and passersby.
"It was an event defined by hard work,sleepless
nights, sacrifice, but above all a love and passion for
the cause in mind," said Austria.
China is the next frontier for the ambitious
Liver Center, which brought the Jade Ribbon
Campaign to two Chinese provinces in 2004. The
country bears the greatest health burden from He
patitis B. with 500,000 people dying in China each
year due to liver failure.
"The problem with other funding for vaccina
tions in China was that it only paid for vaccines and
syringes," said Sue. "No money was provided for

education or for administrative fees for doctors
and nurses to give the vaccine. The vaccines were
not being implemented effectively."
The ALC began its efforts in China by vaccinat
ing 3,500 grade-school children in Sichuan
province, then expanded to two cities in the Guang
Dong province. There, they vaccinated 100,000 stu
dents for free. In addition to vaccines, the ALC pro
vided brochures, posters, and training to the staff of
doctors and nurses at each school. Doctors and
nurses in China also received financial rewards for
effective use of the vaccines.
Interns for 2006-2007 may have the opportuni
ty to go to China and directly oversee implementa
tion of the Center's plans.
"We're dedicated to solving this problem not
only nationally but globally. It's truly tragic that
one million people continue to die every year from
this disease," So said. "With HIV, there's no vac
cine, so we don't have all the solutions. But with
Hepatitis B, we have had the vaccine for twenty
years, so why aren't we giving it to everyone in the
world?"
The ALC has dedicated itself to bridging the
gap between finding vaccines and using these ad
vances to help people. Along the way, it has strug
gled through activism and advocacy to give Hepati
tis B national media attention — over HIV, SARS
or avian flu.
In the United States, Hepatitis B is not a con
cern of the general population, said Dr. So, citing
the one-third percent of the general population in
fection rate, as compared with a staggering 10 per
cent rate for Asian Americans.
"You can't treat the whole population like they
are generic Americans," he said. "If we are going to
improve the health of the whole nation, we must
pay attention to the health disparities in various
populations."
The Asian Liver Center is currently accepting
applications for intern positions as well as for the
positions of outreach coordinator and special proj
ects coordinator. Asian language skills are sought,
but all students are encouraged to apply.
"Since we emphasize outreach so much, it's im
portant for everyone to learn about the effects of
Hepatitis B.even if you're not Asian," Gu said.
"It's a chance to stretch yourself, to learn more
about important issues, and to invest in a really
standout cause that others are not addressing,"
Kim said. "There are many other non-profits
whose interests are divided, or who are focused on
raising money, but the ALC is really keenly focused
on the people, and our director Dr. So never lets us
forget how important that is."
'flicked away in the basement of the Boswell
building of Stanford's Medieal Center is the Asian
Liver Center (ALC), where 20 dedicated interns
and five staff launched their international fight
against the "silent killer," I lepatitis B, among Asian
Americans.
"Although a vaccine for Hepatitis B has existed
for over 20 years, the disease still kills one million

people a year, and infects approximately 10 percent
of Asian-Americans," said Eric Sue, special projects
coordinator for the ALC. "Every day, three times
more people die from Hepatitis B than the entire
SARS outbreak. Ten times more people live with
Hepatitis B than with HIV. The disease has not re
ceived the national attention it deserves."
Founded in 19%, the Asian Liver Center is the
only non-profit in the United States dedicated to
fighting the prevalence of Hepatitis Band liver
cancer in Asians and Asian Americans. The Center
began when founder and former liver transplant
surgeon Samuel So walked through the streets of
San Francisco with his secretary, handing out
brochures to passersby. It grew to encompass liver
cancer research, a clinical program where patients
may be tested for Hepatitis Band a thriving out
reach branch that involves Stanford students in its
efforts to educate the public about Hepatitis B.
"Stanford student interns are actually making
an important impact in this global fight," said Sue.
'There is a real opportunity right here at Stanford
to contribute to improving the health of the
world."
The Center's flagship program is the Jade Rib
bon Campaign, launched in 2(X)l.The culturally
targeted multimedia campaign educates Asians
and Asian Americans about the importance of get
ting tests and vaccinations for Hepatitis B. Though
it began locally, the program spread to other Cali
fornia cities, expanded to other states including
Washington and Arizona, and recently went inter
national — with budding operations in China and
the Philippines. Locally, the Jade Ribbon Cam
paign involves billboards in San Francisco, promi
nent advertisements on 1(X) of the 150 of the city's
buses, educational brochures in seven languages
and public service announcements in Chinese,
Vietnamese and Korean.
"We are trying to eradicate this infection, and
we can do it because there is a vaccine " said Sue.
"Essentially, this would help eliminate 80 percent
of liver cancer, the third-leading cause of cancer
death in the world."
In addition to the campaign, ALC staff mem
bers attend medical conferences and educate prac
titioners of traditional Chinese medicine on the
dangers of Hepatitis B. Annual youth conferences
on Stanford Campus help about 140 local students
learn how to spread the word about Hepatitis B in
their hometowns and schools. The Center also co
ordinated Three for Life, a collaboration with the
