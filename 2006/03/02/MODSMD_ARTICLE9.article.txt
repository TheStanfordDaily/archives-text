In the March 1 issue of The
Daily, the article "Groups approved
for fees ballot" inaccurately para
phrased Daily Chief Operating Of
ficer Brenden Marten. The article
incorrectly implies that the Daily's
net income in some years is a loss of
up to $200,000, which has never
been the case. In addition. Marten's
point that The Daily's finances
often look better on paper than in
reality was not specifically limited
to this year, as the article may lead
readers to believe.
