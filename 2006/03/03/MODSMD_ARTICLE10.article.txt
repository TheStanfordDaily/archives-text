# Rebuttal to Last Week's Food Review
## Yo comprendo Compadres 
### PETE BORUM 
Compadres, located at 3877 El Camino, can be
summed up in two words — different and classy. I'he at
mosphere is one that you won't find anywhere else: dec
orated adobe walls and wood rafters that evoke images
of rustic Mexico, cleverly accented with modern ameni
ties. Hie outside patio appears to be open to the sky, but
is covered with a translucent rooftop and heated with
several natural gas heaters and a large fireplace.The re
sult is a laid-back charm that doesn't require that you
sacrifice either your comfort or the appeal of dining
outdoors. Indoors, there isn't as much space, but if it
isn't too crowded, it's still a great place to eat, with even
more of the decorations that lend themselves to the
lively ambience that is the restaurant's biggest draw.
Seating myself at the bar (what can I say? You're
only young once, right?), I was immediately impressed
by how many choices of bebidas awaited me. The full
bar boasts more than 60 types of tequila (that's
right... 60 plus) and 15 beers. 10 of which are Mexican. I
recommend the top-shelf margarita with the Grand
Marnier floater. Hie menu is extensive, and provides
much more than several variations of the meat-and
rice-stuffed tortilla that forms the staple of most Mexi

can restaurant cuisine. This is partly what I mean when
I say ( ompadres is different. There are enough options
that you could have a different food and drink combi
nation every day of the year, and then some. That's not
to say that everything on the menu is worth writing
home about, though there are definitely some high
lights. I ve had better queso before, but the presenta
tion was excellent, and the Seafood de la Diabla was
amazing. Never mind that it didn't live up to its descrip
tion of muy caliente: there are around 20 different hot
sauces to choose from, ranging from very mild to in
sanely hot (for your own sake, take my word for it). The
service was personable, professional and prompt,
though it wasn t busy enough to get an accurate gauge
of how things would be on a weekend night. Though
pi icier than the typical Mexican lood restaurant, you
definitely get what you pay for in the experience,as well
as in the portion sizes and food quality.
I ime and time again I ve had very good experiences
at ( ompadres, so the honest answer is the same as the
one that preserves good client relationships: for food
quality ( ompadres gets a 3.5/5; for atmosphere and ex
perience it gets a solid and honest 5/5. Especially for a
college crowd. I would recommend going to Com
padres by yourself, on a date or with a group.
