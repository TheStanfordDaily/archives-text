## Editorial Oscars: It's time to tackle the real issues 
### 
Un rokeback Mountain": a movie
about homosexuality? Or cow
-I—J boys and pretty scenery? Are
they mutually exclusive? Is "Syriana" reflec
tive of our current political situation and in
satiable hunger for oil? And was the earlier
2005 Valeric Plame scandal an indication of
our inability to learn anything from the
"Good Night, and Good Luck" era?
Thank you Hollywood for finally shaking
up some social awareness.
You heard us correctly At a time when
one of the biggest media circuses focuses on
how Vice President Dick Cheney shot his
hunting buddy Harry Whittington, Holly
wood is stepping up to the plate to offer
more the public a helping of reality.
It seems that this year, the Oscar lineup is
reflective of a growing national interest in
global affairs and Americas position in the
world community. In addition to "Broke
back Mountain," "Syriana" and "Good
Night, and Good Luck," the movie "Crash"
raised awareness of race relations while
"The Constant Gardener" critically reexam
ined the role of pharmaceuticals in develop
ing nations.
Some may lament the fact that this year's
Oscars ceremony lacks the draw of a large
blockbuster like "The Lord of the Rings" or
"Titanic." However, the increase in the
number of politically progressive movies
among this year's nominees is an encourag
ing trend.
Clearly, a great deal of credit goes to the
directors and producers for bringing these
controversial films into the mainstream.
Nevertheless, the fact that these movies have
received widespread attention suggests that
there is a growing interest in issues of greater
social significance. It's refreshing to note
that our national conscience is moving away
from flimsier, "Legally Blonde"-type films
to those that try to tackle more meaningful
debates.
At the same time, the Oscars can be seen
as a measure of the progress we have yet to

make. While most Americans have at least
heard of, if not seen, many of the nominated
films, critically acclaimed documentaries
that covered the same subjects as their fic
tional counterparts saw much lower box of
fice returns.
Apparently, those who were exposed to a
taste of life in an African country through
"The Constant Gardener" did not feel the
same inclination to see a nonfiction depic
tion in "The Boys of Baraka."
Similarly, the enthusiasm of "Syriana"
fans clearly did not translate into a willing
ness to see the real life "Occupation:
Dreamland," even though both made
strong statements about war. Surely it was
n't the violence that kept us away from "Oc
cupation: Dreamland," since box office re
ceipts skyrocketed for both "Syriana" and
"Crash."
One explanation is that movies like
"Brokeback Mountain" are popular be
cause of their ability to create a personal
space in which we can safely explore our
own biases, preconceptions and prejudices.
The response that documentaries tend to
evoke is largely intellectual, while fictional
movies allow us to respond on different lev
els.
But what does it say about us as a society
if we are only willing to think about chal
lenging norms and stereotypes if the debate
comes in a nice package starring Heath
Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal? Are we so un
able to stomach real debate that we can only
approach these issues from a fictional van
tage point?
This Sunday is Oscars night, and more im
portantly, Jon Stewart night, which is reason
enough to turn on the tube. Go ahead —
reach for the popcorn and pat yourself on
the back for having seen all of this year's
Oscar-nominated films. But before you do
that, stop for a second, drag your eyes away
from Rachel Weisz and George Clooney and
think about the real issues behind the star
studded event.
