# Drink like an Ottoman
## 
### 
We're in Istanbul. We're rolling
around the gateway to the Middle
East on the dime of one George
Will, a beloved Stanford alumni donor —
the type one imagines lounging around his
Italian villa in a scuba suit.TUrkey is fantas
tic. weird, lowbrow, beautiful. We met with
a member of parliament and saw Sabanci
University, which looks like Loyola Mary
mount University without the LA tan lines,
the diesel jeans or the coke. We bartered in
the labyrinthine bazaar for bootleg
"Tintin" T-shirts and a souvenir red fez,
walked through a mosque and learned
about Ttirkey and the European Union.
This column, however, is about an absolute
drunken shitshow.
We arrive at Akbabali Restaurant on
lUesday night, starved from a long day of
guided tours. None of us have slept well —
we flew into Turkey Monday at 2 a.m., and
the jet lag is killer. We sit down, spread
across six tables. I'm sitting with Walt, the
half-Jewish me; Marie, the group Saman
tha; Lauren, the big sister I never wanted
and live in fear of; and Maggie, formerly my
freshman-year neighbor and now my girl
friend. Also present in the tiny restaurant:
assorted faculty. Professor Gerdes' much
loved 4-year-old Stephen, and Cem Kozlu,
ex-CEO of TUrkish Airlines and ex-region
al president of Coca Cola. On our table: a
family-style smorgasboard of appetizers,
Red Wine, water and a TUrkish drink called
Raki (sounds like "rukka").
We raise the Raki to our lips. It tastes
fantastic, or. as the girls put it. "terrible."
Not for the faint of heart — even when you
mix in water, it still tastes like black
liquorice and spent cigarettes. Whatever,
the menfolk shrug —what essential na
tional drink doesn't taste horrible?
What's more American than a bottle of
Jack Daniel's, a beverage which makes ba
bies cry and probably kills kitties? We
pour some wine to chase the Raki, estab
lishing a vicious-circle precedent for the
night. Digital cameras begin to flash — I
briefly consider sepia. It's unclear whether
or not the many appetizers will be the en
tire meal, so we eat heartily for about an
hour. Then the waiters bring out the salad.
Our wine is dwindling, even though we
have one less person at our table than
everybody else. Mags (a good influence on
me) hates alcohol, and only fifth-grade
peer pressure gets her through her first
glass. Everybody else suffers the first, too
— then promptly refills.
Hey, it's free.
Little Steve's laughter fills the room. I
spin to take a picture — and knock a glass
of red wine onto my shirt. As the busboy
wipes it off the table (and me) with a nap
kin, he awkwardly smiles and nods, think
ing, "1 am judging all of the United States

by you, you vagrant drunkard." I try to
cover up my embarrassment by explaining,
"Don't worry, I bought the shirt cheap in
Haight-Ashbury."
Fortunately, by now, half the program is
swished. There is loud yelling and sounds of
tingling glass everywhere. People are send
ing back for more wine.
The drunken freak-outs are beginning.
Mr. CEO chooses this moment to stand up
and discuss the Turkish economy. I try to
listen, but Lauren is poking my stomach
like a little sib on a family road trip. She has
the upper hand — at the far end of our
table, opposite Mr. CEO, she can nod, look
straight-faced, and jab me under the table
cloth.
If I counterattack, all he'll see is that kid
who spilled red wine on himself molesting a
studious-looking girl. Trapped. I hold her
off with a juvenile "Ouiiit liiit," then by
loudly whisper-gossiping with her about
everyone else at our table.
The lecture ends.The waiters — clearly
masochists — bring more Raki. More
wine disappears. Tlie Asians glow. The
white kids with Irish blood get ruddy faces.
Someone puts Steve on their shoulders, a
moment of true Hitchcockian suspense —
it's all fun and games till you drop the tod
dler — but a quick-thinking busboy saves
the day. Chicks make out. There was over
share — the much-maligned state of
drunk where someone knows you don't
care, but feels obliged to tell you some
thing awkward and meaningless over and
over again. I consider toasting George Will
with our green tea, but cheap sarcasm
works only on happy tipsy folk — not
screeching madmen. Memory begins to
blur; there's a long line for the bathroom;
we're all out of water. There is a main
course, I think. I notice the wine stains
have faded — how long have we been
here? Sickly-looking people decamp back
to the hotel. It's time to leave, says some
authority figure. The waiters smile gamely
as we stumble into the warm TUrkish night.
Like the aftermath of a Civil War battle,
those who could still walk carry those who
can't.
Some photo evidence exists to suggest
two reasons for the drunken madhouse. Our
group is predominantly male — even Title

Eins! Swei! Drei!

— schooled on La Maison Fran
caise wine and cheese nights — can
only hold their own for so long
(same reason why even pro woman
golfers still play from the reds).
There's also the fuzzy-techie divide.
As the dinner wound down, and
Walt and I, drunk but cogent,
looked out on the shattered, stam
mering, shambling physical wreck
age of mechanical engineering ma
jors, one of us (impossible to recall
who) remarked, "This is what three

half-Jewish me; Marie, the group Saman
tha; Lauren, the big sister I never wanted
and live in fear of; and Maggie, formerly my
freshman-year neighbor and now my girl
friend. Also present in the tiny restaurant:
assorted faculty. Professor Gerdes' much
loved 4-year-old Stephen, and Cem Kozlu,
ex-CEO of TUrkish Airlines and ex-region
al president of Coca Cola. On our table: a
family-style smorgasboard of appetizers,
Red Wine, water and a TUrkish drink called
Raki (sounds like "rukka").
We raise the Raki to our lips. It tastes
fantastic, or. as the girls put it. "terrible."
Not for the faint of heart — even when you
mix in water, it still tastes like black
liquorice and spent cigarettes. Whatever,
the menfolk shrug —what essential na
tional drink doesn't taste horrible?
What's more American than a bottle of
Jack Daniel's, a beverage which makes ba
bies cry and probably kills kitties? We
pour some wine to chase the Raki, estab
lishing a vicious-circle precedent for the
night. Digital cameras begin to flash — I
briefly consider sepia. It's unclear whether
or not the many appetizers will be the en
tire meal, so we eat heartily for about an
hour. Then the waiters bring out the salad.
Our wine is dwindling, even though we
have one less person at our table than
everybody else. Mags (a good influence on
me) hates alcohol, and only fifth-grade
peer pressure gets her through her first
glass. Everybody else suffers the first, too
— then promptly refills.
Hey, it's free.
Little Steve's laughter fills the room. I
spin to take a picture — and knock a glass
of red wine onto my shirt. As the busboy
wipes it off the table (and me) with a nap
kin, he awkwardly smiles and nods, think
ing, "1 am judging all of the United States

by you, you vagrant drunkard." I try to
cover up my embarrassment by explaining,
"Don't worry, I bought the shirt cheap in
Haight-Ashbury."
Fortunately, by now, half the program is
swished. There is loud yelling and sounds of
tingling glass everywhere. People are send
ing back for more wine.
The drunken freak-outs are beginning.
Mr. CEO chooses this moment to stand up
and discuss the Turkish economy. I try to
listen, but Lauren is poking my stomach
like a little sib on a family road trip. She has
the upper hand — at the far end of our
table, opposite Mr. CEO, she can nod, look
straight-faced, and jab me under the table
cloth.
If I counterattack, all he'll see is that kid
who spilled red wine on himself molesting a
studious-looking girl. Trapped. I hold her
off with a juvenile "Ouiiit liiit," then by
loudly whisper-gossiping with her about
everyone else at our table.
The lecture ends.The waiters — clearly
masochists — bring more Raki. More
wine disappears. Tlie Asians glow. The
white kids with Irish blood get ruddy faces.
Someone puts Steve on their shoulders, a
moment of true Hitchcockian suspense —
it's all fun and games till you drop the tod
dler — but a quick-thinking busboy saves
the day. Chicks make out. There was over
share — the much-maligned state of
drunk where someone knows you don't
care, but feels obliged to tell you some
thing awkward and meaningless over and
over again. I consider toasting George Will
with our green tea, but cheap sarcasm
works only on happy tipsy folk — not
screeching madmen. Memory begins to
blur; there's a long line for the bathroom;
we're all out of water. There is a main
course, I think. I notice the wine stains
have faded — how long have we been
here? Sickly-looking people decamp back
to the hotel. It's time to leave, says some
authority figure. The waiters smile gamely
as we stumble into the warm TUrkish night.
Like the aftermath of a Civil War battle,
those who could still walk carry those who
can't.
Some photo evidence exists to suggest
two reasons for the drunken madhouse. Our
group is predominantly male — even Title

We're in Istanbul. We're rolling
around the gateway to the Middle
East on the dime of one George
Will, a beloved Stanford alumni donor —
the type one imagines lounging around his
Italian villa in a scuba suit.TUrkey is fantas
tic. weird, lowbrow, beautiful. We met with
a member of parliament and saw Sabanci
University, which looks like Loyola Mary
mount University without the LA tan lines,
the diesel jeans or the coke. We bartered in
the labyrinthine bazaar for bootleg
"Tintin" T-shirts and a souvenir red fez,
walked through a mosque and learned
about Ttirkey and the European Union.
This column, however, is about an absolute
drunken shitshow.
We arrive at Akbabali Restaurant on
lUesday night, starved from a long day of
guided tours. None of us have slept well —
we flew into Turkey Monday at 2 a.m., and
the jet lag is killer. We sit down, spread
across six tables. I'm sitting with Walt, the
half-Jewish me; Marie, the group Saman
tha; Lauren, the big sister I never wanted
and live in fear of; and Maggie, formerly my
freshman-year neighbor and now my girl
