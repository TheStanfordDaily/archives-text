So I'm planning a camping trip with a few
friends. We're at the local grocery store,
buying some supplies and planning the
meals.
"Let's get the lentils," one says, placing a
box in the cart.
"Lentils? You're wack," 1 say, replacing
the lentils with canned chicken. "Polio it is."
"I can't eat chicken. I'm a vegetarian."
Oh no you didn't.
Social Decorum 101: When interacting
with a group, subsume the demands of a
small minority to the will of the majority. It
works for democracy. Are you too good for
democracy?
Vegetarians are, apparently. This puts
them among the ranks of Robert Mugabe,
every Arab nation and a billion Chinamen.
(Note: Chinamen is not the preferred
nomenclature).
We democratic Americans love choice.
Yet befriend a vegetarian and "choice" be
comes an abstraction. Want to order a pizza?
Forget about pepperoni, sausage, ham or
Canadian bacon (Why are Canadian pigs so
much more delicious than ours?). Ordering
communal plates at a Thai restaurant? Don't
get beef in your pad thai.
God forbid they might have to pick the
meat out on their own. That would mean an
individual making a sacrifice for the good of
the group. That would make...sense. Why do
vegetarians assume that all of their friends

should conform their eating habits, just be
cause theirs are based on something like
"morals" or "health" or "religion"?
Something must be done about this
plague. The inconveniences of vegetarianism
are multitudinous, epic in proportion — and
by that 1 mean they've started to affect me.
What can we do to hold back the Green
Fide ?
Segregation.
The success of this country is due in part to
its expanse of wide open space — and a lot of
it still remains. Enough for Mormons to have
their own state. Let's manifest-destine vege
tarians to a green swathe of Idaho where they
can grow all the soy they want.Then they can
all go out for Chinese together and not worry
about inconveniencing their friends who
want to order the mu shu pork. Not that they
worry about it now.
Go forth and graze, veggies. You stick to
your granary, I'll stick to my abattoir.

tat them.
It's a sad fact that vegetarians are not
productive members of society. Their pro
tein-deficient bodies are soft and flaccid,
and they're too weak to lift much more
than a spoonful of chickpeas. Worse,
they're a cancer on the livestock industry.
Their refusal to purchase meat products
makes them the incarnation of deadweight
loss. As an American. I know what we do
with unproductive members of society:
kick them in the shins and knock their
shopping carts over.
Figuratively speaking, of course. In literal
terms, I know what 1 would do: eat them. The
same flaccidity that makes them weak also
gives their legs and midsections a juicy ten
derness. With a dash of Lawry's seasoning salt
they're 135 pounds of sumptuous barbecue.
Clearly, they're much more productive on the
supermarket shelf than as non-purchasers of
American meat products. Bad consumers,
great flank steak. It's the economy, stupid.
Start a religion.
Vegetarians often adopt an air of moral
righteousness to force their will upon their
dining companions. "I'm concerned about
the ecological impact of cattle farms" or "I
care about animal rights" or "I'm Hindu" are

frequent excuses. Meat-eaters can
counter by beginning their own reli
gion, one that mandates the eating
of meat at every meal. Call it the
High Holy Church of Visceronis.
Sounds authentic. Now you have a
moral rebuttal to their shrill cries for
meatless meals. "I'm sorry. I need
pepperoni on my pizza, I'm a Vis
ceronian."
You might call me cruel, cold, im
mature or intolerant. 1 prefer the
word "jejune," because most people
don't know what it means and you
probably can't even pronounce it.
But whether I'm jejune or not, don't
make me eat your oats and grain. I
want chicken.
