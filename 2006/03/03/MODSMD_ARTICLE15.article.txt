# It's prom night, yet again
## 
### 
Oh yes. Every high-schooler's dream.
The climax of American youth. The
prom.
Of course I'm a little old for the actual
prom. But this is merely a detail. And the
GSC is so good at blithely ignoring the stric
tures of convention (like, for example, fun)
when it comes to parties. So, tonight we have
the Graduate Student Formal.
Before 1 continue with my gentle(ish)
mockery, 1 should point out that, actually, I'm
genuinely excited about this. I think it's great
that we're having a formal (if for no other rea
son than it gives me something to write
about). Of course I also think it's going to be
really lame, but that might be a point in its
favor.
Now, back to mockery.
Proms are really about two things. One,
getting laid. Two, dressing up. Since the for
mer is one of those distant dreams that rarely
comes true (and is also a topic on which I
have commented frequently in the past), let's
chat about the latter.
Dressing up is fun. Lots and lots of fun. It's
escapism at its best — no troubling hang
overs or overdoses, just (hopefully) glorious
revelry
Sadly, I fear that the costumes tonight will
not live up to my expectations. I have a suspi
cion that not many of my compatriots have
tuxedos hanging in their closets. And, really,
who still keeps an evening gown on a hanger
in the land of shorts and flip flops?
While I understand the sentiment, and
even empathize, I can't help but feel that it's
somewhat of a shame that we're not all going
to arrive tonight decked out in penguin suits.
You see — much like in high school —

this whole prom business is really all about
pretending that we're grown ups. Of course,
by many measures, we shouldn't need to pre
tend — we are, after all. well past puberty. On
the other hand we inhabit a quasi-childlike
world, where much of what we do is not at all
adult.
Accordingly, opportunities to embrace a
glimpse of a more mature life should be
seized enthusiastically. Even when it's appar
ent that whatever you're indulging in is ab
surd.
Of course, it's ridiculous to have a formal.
We're barely capable of going out to our stu
dent bar, how on earth can we endure a so
phisticated evening of dance and drink?
There is no possible way that tonight's
events can come across in any way other than
ludicrous. I mean, playing dress up at faux
ritzy soirees is only acceptable for the chil
dren — after all they're not grown up
enough to have better things to do. For us,
though, it's ridiculous.
People in their mid-20s (actually late-20s,
early-30s and beyond, but we like to pretend)
should have real parties to go to; we should
n't need poor imitations to keep us happy.
ITie tendency of graduate student parties
to be somewhat reminiscent of school dances

has been well-documented (which is to say
that I've complained about it at some point);
I suppose from that point of view, prom night
is a natural progression and should be viewed
with appropriate amounts of scorn and deri
sion.
While I have said scorn, etc. fully-pre
pared, 1 have a feeling (as hinted above) that
it may not really apply to tonight's events.
ITiere is a point beyond which the awkward
ness becomes, if not endearing, then at least
so outlandish as to be sort of fun.
The spectacle of 8(X) graduate students
dressed up in what passes for finery in these
parts brings a smile to my face, and the
thought of the likes of me getting progres
sively drunker and deciding to showcase our
attempts at dancing makes me chuckle.
It's not just the increased potential for en
tertainment that has me all giddy and worked
up, nor is it the extraordinary lameness that
sets my heart-a-flutter. No. what really gets
me going is the hubris.
It's hard not to be an admirer of the kind
of ambition that decides that what the Stan
ford graduate student population really
needs to enliven itself is a Friday night formal
with all the trimmings (and I do mean all the
trimmings — discounted manicures and all).
These folks may be a little deluded, but given
the levels of excitement they've managed to
generate, I guess we should be at least a little
grateful. See you tonight.

Will you be at the prom? If so, come and say
hello, I 'II be the debonair fellow in the tiix prop
ping up the bar or making increasingly wild
shapes on the dance floor. Or you could email
navins@stanford.edu.

early-30s and beyond, but we like to pretend)
should have real parties to go to; we should
n't need poor imitations to keep us happy.
ITie tendency of graduate student parties
to be somewhat reminiscent of school dances

has been well-documented (which is to say
that I've complained about it at some point);
I suppose from that point of view, prom night
is a natural progression and should be viewed
with appropriate amounts of scorn and deri
sion.
While I have said scorn, etc. fully-pre
pared, 1 have a feeling (as hinted above) that
it may not really apply to tonight's events.
ITiere is a point beyond which the awkward
ness becomes, if not endearing, then at least
so outlandish as to be sort of fun.
The spectacle of 8(X) graduate students
dressed up in what passes for finery in these
parts brings a smile to my face, and the
thought of the likes of me getting progres
sively drunker and deciding to showcase our
attempts at dancing makes me chuckle.
It's not just the increased potential for en
tertainment that has me all giddy and worked
up, nor is it the extraordinary lameness that
sets my heart-a-flutter. No. what really gets
me going is the hubris.
It's hard not to be an admirer of the kind
of ambition that decides that what the Stan
ford graduate student population really
needs to enliven itself is a Friday night formal
with all the trimmings (and I do mean all the
trimmings — discounted manicures and all).
These folks may be a little deluded, but given
the levels of excitement they've managed to
generate, I guess we should be at least a little
grateful. See you tonight.

Will you be at the prom? If so, come and say
hello, I 'II be the debonair fellow in the tiix prop
ping up the bar or making increasingly wild
shapes on the dance floor. Or you could email
