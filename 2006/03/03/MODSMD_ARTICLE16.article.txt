## Election Bill 05 needs to be reevaluated 
### ANDREW BARRAGAN MIMA MOHAMMED 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate and
the Graduate Student Council passed
Election Bill 05 last Wednesday in a
joint meeting.This bill precludes any student
group endorsements for candidates in ASSU
elections to appear on the spring election
ballot.
The justification by the authors of the bill
is as follows: "The endorsement policy is un
necessarily restrictive and may require can
didates to alienate voters by choosing one
group over another from which to accept an
endorsement." In addition, the bill stated
that "multiple endorsements to appear on
the ballot for a given candidate has the po
tential to make the bill unwieldy." Whatever
the authors behind the bill meant by "un
wieldy" is not outlined.

Election Bill 05 essentially takes away
power from the student body. It primarily im
pacts candidates running for the Undergrad
uate ASSU Senate, because undergraduates
are often the ones who employ the endorse
ment policy. Candidates should be able to
have the choice whether or not they want to
receive an endorsement by a student group.
Many undergraduate senators, believe
that the inclusion of the bill on last week's
joint meeting agenda was done in an under
handed fashion. The Undergraduate Senate
convened for three hours the night before
the meeting; however, none of the under
graduate senators were informed that they
would be voting on Election Bill 05 the fol
lowing day. In addition, the email notifying
the senators that the bill would be up for vote
was sent less than four hours before the
meeting.
The joint meeting was attended mostly by

members of the Graduate Student Council,
because it was held during their regular
meeting time. More than half of the Under
graduate Senate was unable to attend the
meeting because of irreconcilable conflicts,
such as class, work, other club meetings or
job interviews. If senators had been informed
more than four hours in advance that Elec
tion Bill 05 would be up for a vote, many
would have planned ahead to attend.
The rules state that all bills must have a
24-hour notice given to senators prior to the
voting. Most bills this year have not adhered
to this rule, but have been emailed out at
least 12 hours before the meeting. In addi
tion. bills have often been introduced and
voted on during a single Senate meeting. Re
gardless, these bills were not of the same
gravity as Election Bill 05.
In addition, undergraduate sena
tors are expected to attend their own
meetings. They often plan their
schedules around these meetings —
not those of the GSC. Ibis joint
meeting was a special exception, and
the agenda should have been provid
ed to the senators earlier so that they
could have planned accordingly.
The GSC is currently addressing
Election Bill 05, and they will vote
on whether or not the bill should be
reconsidered for another vote. An
other vote on the bill will allow ade

quate discussion to take place
among the senators, which was not
done at the joint meeting according
to some graduate council members.
The job of the ASSU is to repre
sent and serve the entire student
body to the best of its ability. It
would be doing a disservice to the
students of Stanford and a disservice
to the fair and democratic processes
of the Senate by not discussing the
ramifications Election Bill 05.
