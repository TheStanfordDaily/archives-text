## Special fees hits the road to reform Council rules in favor of student's refund case 
### ALLSON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
With the Constitutional Council's re
cent ruling on partial refunds of special
fees, it will now be easier for students the
reclamation of funds that would have been
allocated to specific student groups.The re
fund option and process will also be more
highly publicized.
Sophomore Joshua Doty submitted the
petition for the case — which was held two
weeks ago — arguing that the current re
fund system was unconstitutional because
there was no clear way to request a partial
refund of a special fee. The case was passed
on a 4-0 vote with one abstention, and will
result in the reworking of the refund Web
site and boosting publicity about obtaining
refunds.
Every quarter, students are charged a
student activities fee on their University
bill. The money is then distributed by the
ASSU to help fund various student groups
on campus.
According to the ASSU funding Web
site, two types of funding are available: dis
cretionary funds and special fees funds.
"Discretionary funds are intended for
the majority of student groups," states the
Web site. "Special Fees are intended for
groups that serve a large portion of the
Stanford community and, as a result, have
large budgets." Student groups desiring ad
ditional funding beyond the discretionary
amount apply for special fees.
The Undergraduate Senate and Gradu
ate Student Council decided in the recent
meetings which groups are to be placed on
the ballot for the spring election. The stu
dent body will then decide which groups to
fund with special fees.
Students have the option of requesting a
refund of their general fee contributions
that go to specific groups. Student groups
are responsible for issuing the refunds, but
are then allowed to deprive the student of
any services the group offers. Each group
makes its own decisions about how to treat
those students who requested refunds, and
students who request even a partial refund
may be denied services.
Doty submitted a petition to the Consti
tutional Council reading, "The current sys
tem only provides the option for the entire
withdraw of funds for the groups listed.
However, ... as detailed and permitted in
the ASSU Constitution, members of the
Association should be provided with a con
venient avenue of selecting partial refunds
of the various special fee groups," citing Ar
ticle V. Section 4.1 of the ASSU Constitu
tion.
"1 brought the case to the Constitution
al Council because until this quarter. I was
unaware that 1 even had the ability to get
refunds and the way the current system is
set up makes it difficult for students to ob
tain one," Doty said. "1 felt all students
should be aware of their ability to get a re
fund because they have a right to choose
what to do with their own money."
