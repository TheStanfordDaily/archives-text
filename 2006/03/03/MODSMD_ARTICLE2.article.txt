## Special fees hits the road to reform Council rules in favor of student's refund case 
### ALLSON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
With the Constitutional Council's re
cent ruling on partial refunds of special
fees, it will now be easier for students the
reclamation of funds that would have been
allocated to specific student groups.The re
fund option and process will also be more
highly publicized.
Sophomore Joshua Doty submitted the
petition for the case — which was held two
weeks ago — arguing that the current re
fund system was unconstitutional because
there was no clear way to request a partial
refund of a special fee. The case was passed
on a 4-0 vote with one abstention, and will
result in the reworking of the refund Web
site and boosting publicity about obtaining
refunds.
Every quarter, students are charged a
student activities fee on their University
bill. The money is then distributed by the
ASSU to help fund various student groups
on campus.
According to the ASSU funding Web
site, two types of funding are available: dis
cretionary funds and special fees funds.
"Discretionary funds are intended for
the majority of student groups," states the
Web site. "Special Fees are intended for
groups that serve a large portion of the
Stanford community and, as a result, have
large budgets." Student groups desiring ad
ditional funding beyond the discretionary
amount apply for special fees.
The Undergraduate Senate and Gradu
ate Student Council decided in the recent
meetings which groups are to be placed on
the ballot for the spring election. The stu
dent body will then decide which groups to
fund with special fees.
Students have the option of requesting a
refund of their general fee contributions
that go to specific groups. Student groups
are responsible for issuing the refunds, but
are then allowed to deprive the student of
any services the group offers. Each group
makes its own decisions about how to treat
those students who requested refunds, and
students who request even a partial refund
may be denied services.
Doty submitted a petition to the Consti
tutional Council reading, "The current sys
tem only provides the option for the entire
withdraw of funds for the groups listed.
However, ... as detailed and permitted in
the ASSU Constitution, members of the
Association should be provided with a con
venient avenue of selecting partial refunds
of the various special fee groups," citing Ar
ticle V. Section 4.1 of the ASSU Constitu
tion.
"1 brought the case to the Constitution
al Council because until this quarter. I was
unaware that 1 even had the ability to get
refunds and the way the current system is
set up makes it difficult for students to ob
tain one," Doty said. "1 felt all students
should be aware of their ability to get a re
fund because they have a right to choose
what to do with their own money."
Junior Chris Nguyen, chair of the Un-
dergraduate Senate, represented Doty in the case.
"For the student body, this ruling protects the rights
of students to object to a specific event or a specific ex
pense (such as officer salary or meeting food) without
objecting to an entire group," Nguyen said. "For student
groups, this could decrease how much money goes to re
funds, as some people who used to refund a group's
whole fee may opt to refund part of the group's fee in
stead."
Nguyen said he didn't think the ruling would have
much of an impact on the ASSU, other than the effort of
redesigning the Web site. He added, however, that he
was surprised that the Web site will need to be re
designed by this spring quarter rather than next fall.
Patrick Crosetto, a MBA student and a member of
the Constitutional Council, said he thinks the ruling will
"allow for a more transparent system."
"People will be more educated about the process of
getting refunds and people who want refunds will 110
longer be inhibited," he said. "Refunds are a right, not a
privilege."
Doty said he did not request a refund for this quarter,
but in the future, will decide at the beginning of each
quarter, starting this spring. While this was his first time
submitting a petition to the ASSU, Doty said he will not
hesitate doing it again.
"I would definitely consider submitting another case
if it would benefit students," said Doty, adding that he is
considering going into law in the future. Me also stressed
that his one and only priority in the case was maintain
ing students' rights.
"The purpose of my petition was not so that I could
get a refund, but that ultimately students' rights are pro
tected," he said.
