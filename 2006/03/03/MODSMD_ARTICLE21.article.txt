Stanford men's basketball has seen just about everything this
season: injuries to nearly every starter, shocking losses to bottom
feeders UC-Davis and UC-Irvine, thrilling last-second victories
over Oregon and nationally-ranked Washington, and a 39-point ef
fort — and victory — in the cagers' last contest against Washington
State.
All told, just about the only experience that has continually elud
ed the squad this season has been an easy victory. And, despite pre
game expectations of a Stanford cakewalk, the trend certainly con
tinued against Southern California last night at Maples.
Ultimately though, like they have all season at home — where
they are now 10-2 this year — Stanford found a way to eke out an
other last-second win, prevailing 58-56.
Tied at 56, senior guard Chris Hernandez drove the lane against
Gabe Pruitt of USC (17-11,8-9 Pac-10).The players ever so slightly
bumped, and Hernandez slipped to the floor with just 4.0 seconds
remaining.
But, after calling a tight game with only 31 fouls to that point, the
officials whistled Pruitt for blocking — to the surprise of just about
everyone in attendance, save for Hernandez.
Hernandez, a 95% free throw shooter in league play this season,
drained both his attempts from the line, USC's Ryan Francis' last
second, off-balance three caught the rim, and Stanford (15-11,11-6)
escaped yet another Maples heart-stopper.
"He was giving me some space, and I felt like he was off-balance
and had a weak stance," said Hernandez, who led Stanford with 16
points and 7-of-8 free throw shooting. "So I gave him a hesitation
[move] and had a step on him, and he moved into me. Maybe he was
playing for a charge or a no-call, but he came over and knocked me
down. It's good to see the ref made the right call."
Pruitt, meanwhile, said Hernandez "flopped," and initially
thought the whistle was for charging.
"I didn't hit him at all," said Pruitt, whose 13 points trailed only
guard Lodrick Stewart's 17 for USC. "He just tripped on his own
and fell down. Listen, the guy's a 96 percent free throw shooter [sic],
or something like that. I was not going to foul him."
Both head coaches — Tim Floyd of USC and Stanford's Trent
Johnson, refused to discuss the merit of the whistle.
"From where I sit, I can't officiate from over there," said John
son, who added that the Card diagrammed an isolation call that
would allow Hernandez and Pruitt to go one-on-one for the final
play. "I'm concerned about execution and Chris got a good look."
Early in the game, Stanford looked in control against the Trojans.
The Card used a 22-4 run to jump to a 25-14 first-half lead. The

Stanford's Chris Hernandez and USC's Gabe Pruitt hit the floor after running into each other with 4.0 seconds on the clock. Pruitt was called for a
blocking foul and Hernandez, clutch as always in the closing moments, made both free throws to break the 56-56 tie and give Stanford the win.
