# It Matt-ers: Senior Day for Haryasz
## 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
When the current men's basketball senior
class is remembered, it may be for its struggles.
It may be remembered for Chris Hernandez's
sweet shot, Dan Grunfeld's perseverance, or
Jason Haas' solid play off the bench. But, it
may well be Matt Haryasz, one of the best and
most emotional big men the Cardinal have had
in years, who lingers longest in the minds of
Stanford fans.

Six months ago, that might not have been
the case. Haryasz certainly had high expecta
tions on his shoulders, but Grunfeld and Her
nandez were the big scorers on the team.
Haryasz was a consistent big man through his
early Stanford career, but not the star â€” that
was left to players like Hernandez and former
Cardinal greats Josh Childress and Matt Lot
tich.
But this season, like in each of his first three,
Haryasz improved. He worked on his inside
game and became a more physical presence.

This has translated into points, rebounds and
attention from fans and opponents alike.
Haryasz now leads the team with 17.3
points per game and more than nine rebounds.
It is the third straight season in which he has in
creased his scoring total from the previous year
by at least five points per game.
"Look at what Matt's done from year to
year," coach Trent Johnson said when asked
about the development of his senior class.
