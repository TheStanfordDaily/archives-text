# It Matt-ers: Senior Day for Haryasz
## 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
When the current men's basketball senior
class is remembered, it may be for its struggles.
It may be remembered for Chris Hernandez's
sweet shot, Dan Grunfeld's perseverance, or
Jason Haas' solid play off the bench. But, it
may well be Matt Haryasz, one of the best and
most emotional big men the Cardinal have had
in years, who lingers longest in the minds of
Stanford fans.

Six months ago, that might not have been
the case. Haryasz certainly had high expecta
tions on his shoulders, but Grunfeld and Her
nandez were the big scorers on the team.
Haryasz was a consistent big man through his
early Stanford career, but not the star — that
was left to players like Hernandez and former
Cardinal greats Josh Childress and Matt Lot
tich.
But this season, like in each of his first three,
Haryasz improved. He worked on his inside
game and became a more physical presence.

This has translated into points, rebounds and
attention from fans and opponents alike.
Haryasz now leads the team with 17.3
points per game and more than nine rebounds.
It is the third straight season in which he has in
creased his scoring total from the previous year
by at least five points per game.
"Look at what Matt's done from year to
year," coach Trent Johnson said when asked
about the development of his senior class.
"From freshman to sophomore to junior to senior, he's gotten better."
But. his increased success on the court has not made anything easi
er. Teams are now double-teaming Haryasz every time he touches the
ball, making scoring a difficult task.
"It changes the way you play," Haryasz said. "When you're getting
double-teamed, it takes away the number of shots you are going to take
and it takes you out of a rhythm somewhat. I just need to work hard and

know it is not going to be
easy to get points. 1 have to
know it is not about the
number of points that I
score, but about the effec
tiveness of the team. If
teams try to focus on me,
other people are going to be
open."
Despite the double-team
Haryasz faces, he has contin
ued to succeed. He has had
10 twenty-point games on
the season and is fifth in the
Pac-10 in scoring. Much of
this improvement has come
from his ability to be more
physical.
"There was a time this
season where he was getting
through contact." Johnson
said. "In that period he was
being physical — playing
with a presence — playing
with poise."

I just worry about my
season here and the
rest will take care of
itself. I don't pay
attention too much, I
just go out and play
hoop.

Ilie physical play complements an emotional side to his game that is
obvious to anyone who watches him play. Haryasz is not afraid to get
riled up after a big play and is often seen calling for the Sixth Man Club
to step up its enthusiasm.
That emotion may come to a head this Saturday against UCLA
when Haryasz will suit up for a regular season game at Maples Pavilion
for the last time.
"When 1 really invest myself into something it means a lot," Haryasz
said.'i feel like I've invested everything I can into this program — all
the hard work. I've invested so much of myself and this program has
meant so much to me. I'm trying to do everything I can to play to the
best of my ability and better the program — both on and off the court."
"Senior Day is going to be special because it will be my last time
playing at home, my last time playing in front of the Sixth Man. Obvi
ously, that has been an awesome experience."
ITie good news for Haryasz is that the end of this season almost cer
tainly will mean the beginning of another stage of his athletic life —
playing in the NBA. Haryasz has been projected by some publications
as being as high as a late first-round pick in the upcoming NBA draft.
"It is definitely exciting." said Haryasz about his future in the game.
"I'm not nervous about it at all. I know that if I work as hard I can and
play to the best of my abilities, the rest will take care of itself. It is defi
nitely an exciting time as I'm moving on to a new chapter of my life —
another opportunity that basketball has given me."
But Haryasz isn't ready to focus on the future quite yet — he is still
focused on the final games of his Stanford career.
"I just worry about my season here and the rest will take care of it
self," Haryasz said. "1 don't pay attention too much, I just go out and
play hoop."

said.'i feel like I've invested everything I can into this program — all
the hard work. I've invested so much of myself and this program has
meant so much to me. I'm trying to do everything I can to play to the
best of my ability and better the program — both on and off the court."
"Senior Day is going to be special because it will be my last time
playing at home, my last time playing in front of the Sixth Man. Obvi

ITie good news for Haryasz is that the end of this season almost cer
tainly will mean the beginning of another stage of his athletic life —
playing in the NBA. Haryasz has been projected by some publications
as being as high as a late first-round pick in the upcoming NBA draft.
"It is definitely exciting." said Haryasz about his future in the game.
"I'm not nervous about it at all. I know that if I work as hard I can and
play to the best of my abilities, the rest will take care of itself. It is defi
nitely an exciting time as I'm moving on to a new chapter of my life —
another opportunity that basketball has given me."
But Haryasz isn't ready to focus on the future quite yet — he is still
focused on the final games of his Stanford career.
"I just worry about my season here and the rest will take care of it
self," Haryasz said. "1 don't pay attention too much, I just go out and
play hoop."
