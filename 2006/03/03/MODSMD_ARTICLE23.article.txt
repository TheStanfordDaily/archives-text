## Stanford women aim for third title in four-year tournament history 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
Stanford women's basketball has been waiting for
its "second season" all year. And now that it's here, the
Cardinal know all the accomplishments from the reg
ular season marathon — including 21 wins and a
record sixth-straight conference crown — will mean
nothing if the team cannot perform in the postseason
sprint.
"You can't stop and admire," sophomore guard
Candice Wiggins said. "Great teams look ahead and al
ways concentrate on the next goal, while good or aver
age teams will say 'oh, look what we've done.' '[That] is
what separates the champs from the chumps,' Tara al
ways says."
Stanford started its postseason on a high note yes
terday with the announcement of Pac-10 awards. Just
like last year, it was a clean sweep for the Cardinal —
Wiggins was the Player of the Year and head coach
Tara VanDerveer was Coach of the Year.
"It's different, because I feel like my experience
this year was so different than last year," said Wiggins,
who also won the award as a freshman last year. "One
of the biggest surprises to me this season was my three-

Sophomore guard Candice Wiggins was named Pac-10 Player of the Year
yesterday, becoming the fifth player ever to win back-to-back honors.
Wiggins leads the conference with four 30-point performances in 2006.
point shot. 1 never thought I d be a 40
percent three-point shooter. I guess
it comes with confidence. Shooting is
more mental than anything else."
Indeed, Wiggins is the confer
ence's most accurate free throw and
three-point shooter, at 82.8 and 46.3
percent, respectively. Her 21.7-point
scoring average is third best in the
country, and a Stanford record.
For VanDerveer, who reached
650 career wins and 500 wins with
Stanford this year, the latest acco
lade was still surprising.
"Honestly, 1 was shocked and re
ally honored," VanDerveer said.
"Last year we went 17-1 in the con
ference, and we had in some ways a
well-oiled machine team where
coaches could look and say that was
a really good job.
"But this year, in some ways, it
means more to me because coaches
recognized that we lost five seniors,

had the injury to Kristin Newlin, and
had to develop a freshman point
guard. And the conference was so
much closer.The vote could've gone
to so many different people."
Also receiving praise were junior
forward Brooke Smith, who was
tabbed First-Team All-Pac-10 for
the second straight season, and
freshman forward Jillian Harmon,
who was named to the freshman All-
Conference team. Point guard Ros
alyn Gold-Onwude rounded out the
awards with an honorable mention
on the freshman squad.
Tomorrow, the Cardinal (21-6,15-
3 Pac-10) will play the winner of the
first-round game between Arizona
(7-21,3-15) and Oregon (5-13.14-14)
tomorrow at 5:30 p.m in San Jose.
Stanford has won the tournament
three years in a row, and enters once
again as the top seed.
""We know the tradition of Stan
ford Basketball," Newlin said.
"Krista Rappahahn, being a senior,
has won every single year. But. we

everything if we want to keep the
