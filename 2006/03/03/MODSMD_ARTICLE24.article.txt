# New year, new look, same success

Despite the graduation of five players who ac
counted for nearly half of the team's scoring and re
bounding, the Stanford women's basketball team
came into its 2005-06 season ready for the challenge.
r l\venty-one wins and a Pac-10 regular season title
later, the Cardinal have proven that they could with
stand the loss.
The squad lost centers T'Nae Thiel and Azella
Perryman and guards Kelley Suminski, Susan King
Borchardt and Sebnem Kimyacioglu at the end of
last year, but current senior center Shelley Nweke is
pleased with her team's response to the change.
"I think a lot of people were ready for it; they
were ready to step up to the challenge," she said.
"Everyone has stepped up just through changing
their role on the team."
Most obvious is the emergence of the dynamic
duo of sophomore guard Candice Wiggins and jun
ior center Brooke Smith.The two combine for near
ly half the team's scoring and rebounding.
However, Nweke believes every one of her team
mates has improved her play.
Perhaps the best example is senior guard Krista
Rappahahn. Previously stuck behind older team
mates, Rappahahn moved this year to a starting po-
sition, mostly on the strength of her
three-point shooting. She averages
nearly three treys per game and had a
career-high six twice this season.
"It's awesome to he starting, and I
love to have the green light for the
three," said Rappahahn. "But it's not
about that — it's about our team
doing well, learning to work together,
having fun. growing together and
maximizing our potential."
Rappahahn doesn't believe the
Cardinal had a void to fill because its
departing seniors. Having been on a
team without a senior her freshman
year, she said that every year brings a
new dynamic, and that it is not de
pendent on who is on the roster.
"I don't think it's been a rebuild
ing year," she said. "It's just been an
other year of playing basketball."
This year's team has benefited not
just from the powerhouse scoring of
Wiggins, Smith and Rappahahn, but

also from the strong freshman pres
ence of guards Jillian Harmon and
Rosalyn Gold-Onwude. The two av
erage 26 and 23 minutes per game, re
spectively, and Harmon averages
over nine points per game.
"We've had freshman step up and
become a huge part of our team,"
Rappahahn said. "That's exciting,
and we needed that after losing the
five seniors."
The team also has junior center
Kristen Newlin, who returned as a
presence in the post after an injury
early in the season. She has four dou
ble-doubles this season. 26 blocks,
and averages nine points per game.
Together, the Cardinal have creat
ed a potent offensive and defensive
force, which has led to a fifth-straight
Pac-1() title — in a more competitive
conference than past years.
"The bottom of the Pac-10 is not
what the bottom used to be," Rappa
hahn said. "You have to be ready for
every game."
As for this weekend's tourna
ment. "Everyone's ready for it, ready
to play hard, and ready to get out
there," Nweke said.
