## BALCO or no, Barry's the best 
### 
Love him, hate him, or wish he was thrown naked into a swimming
pool full of hungry wolverines, Barry Bonds has surely caught
your attention. After all, the man generates more conversation
and controversy than any other professional athlete. As he enters the
2006 baseball season, he sits in a prime position to pass Babe Ruth on
the all-time homerun list and possibly even catch Hank Aaron, ce
menting his place as the greatest hitter in baseball history.

No one can argue with
the guy's numbers. He's a
seven-time MVP, a stat
matched by no one in any
professional sport (Michael
Jordan, who many believe to
be the greatest basketball
player of all time, only won
the award five times). He
holds the single season
homerun record, belting 73
dingers in 2001. He gets it
done in the field, with eight
Gold Gloves in left field. His
lifetime batting average is a
respectable .300, and that
doesn't include the walks
he's drawn — more than any

Bonds has surely caught
your attention.

player in the history of Major League Baseball, which pushes his other
worldly career on-base-percentage to above .440. Oh, and just to make
sure you believe he's a complete player, he has over 500 steals in his ca
reer.
Recently, however, these numbers' credibility has been called into
question due to Bonds' involvement (to what extent has yet to be de
termined) with known steroid provider and athlete doper Victor
Conte and the Bay Area company BALCO.
While he has tested positive for steroids, to this day he vehemently
denies knowingly using an illegal substance. He said that his trainer
Greg Anderson duped him into believing that the cream was just flax
seed oil for rehabilitation purposes.
There's more than that though. If you compare his physical stature
when he first came into the league with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1986
to the Giant you see before you today, it looks like "Invasion of the
Body Snatchers." Only instead of taking control of his mind and mak
ing him execute foul deeds, whoever took over Bonds' body seems in
terested only in turning it into one giant muscle.
Does this necessarily mean that Barry's on the juice? Absolutely
not. While a leap in body mass can be indicative of steroid use, many
professional athletes are able to add mass the old-fashioned way, with
proper diet and exercise. 1 mean, it's not like we've seen Barry with a
giant head, hair growing where
there was no hair before, and femi
nine breasts right? Oops, that was
Wednesday at spring training!
St) what? Why does Bonds de
serve all our attention? Jose Canseco
used juice. Ken Caminetti died from
it, and a slew of major league players
have tested positive for the stuff in
the past year. Well, guess what?

None of them is as good as Barry.
Barry sparks our curiosity because of
what he does, not because of what
the steroids allegedly do to him.
Bonds was hitting homeruns
long before the steroid era.'lTiere's
no arguing that he may be the best
hitter of all time, forget the home
runs. Watch Barry's swing. Even
when he was a sliver of the body you
see today, he still had that same
sweet stroke. He may be closing in
on the homerun record, but he's
also got one of the lowest strike-out
to at-bat ratios in all of Major
League Baseball. Simply put, the

guy hits the ball.
Do the supposed steroids turn a
gap double into a roundtripper?
Possibly, but, at the same time, they
do that for everyone. Why aren't
Jason Giambi, Juan Gonzales and
Jose Canseco running for the
record? The steroids can't hit the
ball for you.
No, Barry's not a conversation
topic because of his supposed
steroid use. He's a spotlight figure
because he does it better than any
one else. When Roger Maris broke
Babe Ruth's record for single-sea
son home runs, his run too engen

dered controversy. The single-sea
son homerun mark is the most hal
lowed record in sports, and many
felt Maris was not worthy to wear
the mantle of Ruth. This was the
same Ruth who was an alcoholic,
chain-smoking womanizer who died
early as a result of his fast living,
though he did it with charisma.
Unfortunately for Barry's image,
he doesn't play quite as well in the
press. It's a good thing he's got such
a big head, because he needs every
spare cubic inch for playing those
"psychological games" with himself
that he so recently described.

Barry's not worried about the game
of baseball, Barry's worried about
Barry. As a result, he often comes
across as an anti-team player or a
primadonna. That doesn't change
the fact that he's damn good.
People want their heroes to be
shining examples of what they as
pire to be. Barry wants nothing
more than to enjoy playing the
game and go about his business.
Maybe he's trying to change things
with this new reality series ("Barry
on Barry", tentatively debuting on
ESPN2 this season), but in the end,
the public as a whole may never ac

cept him.
I, for one, will watch every
minute of Bonds' chase in anticipa
tion, not to pass judgment on his ac
complishments, but merely to watch
the best ever chase down a dream.

Do the supposed steroids turn a
gap double into a roundtripper?
Possibly, but, at the same time, they
do that for everyone. Why aren't
Jason Giambi, Juan Gonzales and
Jose Canseco running for the
record? The steroids can't hit the
ball for you.
No, Barry's not a conversation
topic because of his supposed
steroid use. He's a spotlight figure
because he does it better than any
one else. When Roger Maris broke
Babe Ruth's record for single-sea
son home runs, his run too engen

dered controversy. The single-sea
son homerun mark is the most hal
lowed record in sports, and many
felt Maris was not worthy to wear
the mantle of Ruth. This was the
same Ruth who was an alcoholic,
chain-smoking womanizer who died
early as a result of his fast living,
though he did it with charisma.
Unfortunately for Barry's image,
he doesn't play quite as well in the
press. It's a good thing he's got such
a big head, because he needs every
spare cubic inch for playing those
"psychological games" with himself
that he so recently described.

Barry's not worried about the game
of baseball, Barry's worried about
Barry. As a result, he often comes
across as an anti-team player or a
primadonna. That doesn't change
the fact that he's damn good.
People want their heroes to be
shining examples of what they as
pire to be. Barry wants nothing
more than to enjoy playing the
game and go about his business.
Maybe he's trying to change things
with this new reality series ("Barry
on Barry", tentatively debuting on
ESPN2 this season), but in the end,
the public as a whole may never ac

I, for one, will watch every
minute of Bonds' chase in anticipa
tion, not to pass judgment on his ac
complishments, but merely to watch
the best ever chase down a dream.

Love him, hate him, or wish he was thrown naked into a swimming
pool full of hungry wolverines, Barry Bonds has surely caught
your attention. After all, the man generates more conversation
and controversy than any other professional athlete. As he enters the
2006 baseball season, he sits in a prime position to pass Babe Ruth on
the all-time homerun list and possibly even catch Hank Aaron, ce
menting his place as the greatest hitter in baseball history.

No one can argue with
the guy's numbers. He's a
seven-time MVP, a stat
matched by no one in any
professional sport (Michael
Jordan, who many believe to
be the greatest basketball
player of all time, only won
the award five times). He
holds the single season
homerun record, belting 73
dingers in 2001. He gets it
done in the field, with eight
Gold Gloves in left field. His
lifetime batting average is a
respectable .300, and that
doesn't include the walks
he's drawn — more than any

player in the history of Major League Baseball, which pushes his other
worldly career on-base-percentage to above .440. Oh, and just to make
sure you believe he's a complete player, he has over 500 steals in his ca
reer.
Recently, however, these numbers' credibility has been called into
question due to Bonds' involvement (to what extent has yet to be de
termined) with known steroid provider and athlete doper Victor
Conte and the Bay Area company BALCO.
While he has tested positive for steroids, to this day he vehemently
denies knowingly using an illegal substance. He said that his trainer
Greg Anderson duped him into believing that the cream was just flax
seed oil for rehabilitation purposes.
There's more than that though. If you compare his physical stature
when he first came into the league with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1986
to the Giant you see before you today, it looks like "Invasion of the
Body Snatchers." Only instead of taking control of his mind and mak
ing him execute foul deeds, whoever took over Bonds' body seems in
terested only in turning it into one giant muscle.
Does this necessarily mean that Barry's on the juice? Absolutely
not. While a leap in body mass can be indicative of steroid use, many
professional athletes are able to add mass the old-fashioned way, with
proper diet and exercise. 1 mean, it's not like we've seen Barry with a
giant head, hair growing where
there was no hair before, and femi
nine breasts right? Oops, that was
Wednesday at spring training!
St) what? Why does Bonds de
serve all our attention? Jose Canseco
used juice. Ken Caminetti died from
it, and a slew of major league players
have tested positive for the stuff in
the past year. Well, guess what?

None of them is as good as Barry.
Barry sparks our curiosity because of
what he does, not because of what
the steroids allegedly do to him.
Bonds was hitting homeruns
long before the steroid era.'lTiere's
no arguing that he may be the best
hitter of all time, forget the home
runs. Watch Barry's swing. Even
when he was a sliver of the body you
see today, he still had that same
sweet stroke. He may be closing in
on the homerun record, but he's
also got one of the lowest strike-out
to at-bat ratios in all of Major
League Baseball. Simply put, the

guy hits the ball.
