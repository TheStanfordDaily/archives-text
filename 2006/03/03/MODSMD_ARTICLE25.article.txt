## BALCO or no, Barry's the best

Love him, hate him, or wish he was thrown naked into a swimming
pool full of hungry wolverines, Barry Bonds has surely caught
your attention. After all, the man generates more conversation
and controversy than any other professional athlete. As he enters the
2006 baseball season, he sits in a prime position to pass Babe Ruth on
the all-time homerun list and possibly even catch Hank Aaron, ce
menting his place as the greatest hitter in baseball history.

No one can argue with
the guy's numbers. He's a
seven-time MVP, a stat
matched by no one in any
professional sport (Michael
Jordan, who many believe to
be the greatest basketball
player of all time, only won
the award five times). He
holds the single season
homerun record, belting 73
dingers in 2001. He gets it
done in the field, with eight
Gold Gloves in left field. His
lifetime batting average is a
respectable .300, and that

reer.
Recently, however, these numbers' credibility has been called into
question due to Bonds' involvement (to what extent has yet to be de
termined) with known steroid provider and athlete doper Victor
Conte and the Bay Area company BALCO.
While he has tested positive for steroids, to this day he vehemently
denies knowingly using an illegal substance. He said that his trainer
Greg Anderson duped him into believing that the cream was just flax
seed oil for rehabilitation purposes.
There's more than that though. If you compare his physical stature
when he first came into the league with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1986
to the Giant you see before you today, it looks like "Invasion of the
Body Snatchers." Only instead of taking control of his mind and mak
ing him execute foul deeds, whoever took over Bonds' body seems in
terested only in turning it into one giant muscle.
Does this necessarily mean that Barry's on the juice? Absolutely
not. While a leap in body mass can be indicative of steroid use, many
professional athletes are able to add mass the old-fashioned way, with
proper diet and exercise. 1 mean, it's not like we've seen Barry with a
