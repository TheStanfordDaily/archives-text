▼ ▼ found his family's house in Louisiana stili
standing, damaged lightly by heavy Waters that settled
on the roof and seeped through.
The native of Metairie, Louisiana — a suburb south
of Lake Pontchartain and just 15 minutes west of New
Orleans —joined his parents and older brother as they
drove around the worst areas affected by Hurricane
Katrina. Houses had been shifted onto the road and
cars had been toppled over onto their roofs. Bleich
couldn't believe how much was missing and with a sick
feeling in his stomach, as he would later tell teammate
Cireg Reynolds, Bleich asked his father to head hack.
He didn't want to see it anymore.
"1 knew it was going to be bad but there's really no
way of describing it other than seeing it," said Bleich.
who attended Isidore Newman K-12in New Orleans."l
knew it was bad but I didn't realize it was that bad. You
hear about it, but until you see the way it affects peo
ple's lives and the way it affects the city in general it's in
describable."
Bleich (1-1), the Cardinal's star reliever, had been
traveling with the Junior USA Baseball Team when the
hurricane hit his home state.The proud Louisiana resi
dent wasn't able to go back before arriving at Stanford,
and according to one of his closest teammates, fresh
man Brent Milleville. the start of the school year was
tough.
"That bothered him for a while because he didn't
have a lot of stuff he wanted." Milleville said. "He felt
he was rushed and he was worried because his family
was down there, his dad |a doctor] was working down
there."
Bleich has sinced moved on and is settled into his
Stanford life by now — and has found a niche on the
Stanford team as a dependable closer — but he won't
soon forget the bigger challenges in life.
"You're supposed to have fun with [baseball]," the
southpaw said. "Something like a hurricane is life
changing and obviously on a much higher scale. When
something like that happens, it definitely puts things in
perspective — baseball still a game."
Meanwhile, Bleich is easily handling the challenges
the game throws at him. Hie highly recruited lefty —
who was named a 2(X)5 First Team Ail-American by
Collegiate Baseball and owned a 0.56 HRA his senior
year — didn't even stumble in the transition from high
school to college, saving the game in his first appear-

ance in the Cardinal's seajson opener. With a iistball
reaching speeds of 88-92anph, and a solid breakmg ball
and changeup, Bleich has held opponents to a. IES bat
ting average while posting a 0.77 ERA.
* "For a freshman pitcher he is able to interchange all
three of those pitches for strikes which is the key to
pitching at our level," head coach Mark Marquess said.
"The adjustment from high school to college is can you
throw more than one pitch over for a strike and Jeremy
showed us from the fall up to now that he is able to do
that with all three pitches."
Bleich is part of a large freshman class of 14 this year
but his performance has made him a standout early. He
has come in many times with the game on the line, and
has succeeded in advancing the Cardinal to their cur
rent 9-4 record.
While according to Marquess it is unusual for a
freshman to take on the closer's role, Bleich has adapt
ed well. At first, it was hard for the 6-foot-2 hurler to get
ready quickly, but the transition seems to have worked
for the best, thanks in large part to his mentality.
"Pitching is pitching no matter whether you're pitch
ing in the ninth inning or the first inning — you still
have to get guys out the same way," Bleich said, later
adding that he is completely satisfied in his role as a re
liever.
Bleich has five saves in eight appearances, and did
n't allow an earned run in his first six trips to the mound.
In those first six appearances, Bleich seemed invincible
on the mound. He finally gave up his first earned run
against Fresno State on Feb. 24 and on Feb. 25, the Bull
dogs handed him his first blown save and loss in an out
ing that resulted in three unearned runs. Despite the
blemish on the stat sheet, his team isn't hesitant to hand
the game over to him.
"I've handed the ball over to him twice [Fullerton
and Fresno State] and both times he has come in and
gotten the baserunners out that I left," Reynolds, Stan
ford's righthanded ace said." I feel very confident hand
ing him the ball. I don't think there is a harder worker
on the pitching staff.... When I hand the ball, that's the
kind of guy that I want to hand the ball to."
Now that he knows the important bitter taste of a
loss, Bleich's season seems balanced. He focus is still on
consistency and trying to remain level-headed, though
it seems Bleich has got those two down.
"A lot of guys have the pitches and ability, but it's
how you handle the competition in stressful situa
tions," Marquess said. "And he's proven that he can
handle that."

▼ ▼ found his family's house in Louisiana stili
standing, damaged lightly by heavy Waters that settled
on the roof and seeped through.
The native of Metairie, Louisiana — a suburb south
of Lake Pontchartain and just 15 minutes west of New
Orleans —joined his parents and older brother as they
drove around the worst areas affected by Hurricane
Katrina. Houses had been shifted onto the road and
cars had been toppled over onto their roofs. Bleich
couldn't believe how much was missing and with a sick
feeling in his stomach, as he would later tell teammate
Cireg Reynolds, Bleich asked his father to head hack.
He didn't want to see it anymore.
"1 knew it was going to be bad but there's really no
way of describing it other than seeing it," said Bleich.
who attended Isidore Newman K-12in New Orleans."l
knew it was bad but I didn't realize it was that bad. You
hear about it, but until you see the way it affects peo
ple's lives and the way it affects the city in general it's in
describable."
Bleich (1-1), the Cardinal's star reliever, had been
traveling with the Junior USA Baseball Team when the
hurricane hit his home state.The proud Louisiana resi
dent wasn't able to go back before arriving at Stanford,
and according to one of his closest teammates, fresh
man Brent Milleville. the start of the school year was
tough.
"That bothered him for a while because he didn't
have a lot of stuff he wanted." Milleville said. "He felt
he was rushed and he was worried because his family
was down there, his dad |a doctor] was working down
there."
Bleich has sinced moved on and is settled into his
Stanford life by now — and has found a niche on the
Stanford team as a dependable closer — but he won't
soon forget the bigger challenges in life.
"You're supposed to have fun with [baseball]," the
southpaw said. "Something like a hurricane is life
changing and obviously on a much higher scale. When
something like that happens, it definitely puts things in
perspective — baseball still a game."
Meanwhile, Bleich is easily handling the challenges
the game throws at him. Hie highly recruited lefty —
who was named a 2(X)5 First Team Ail-American by
Collegiate Baseball and owned a 0.56 HRA his senior
year — didn't even stumble in the transition from high
school to college, saving the game in his first appear-

ance in the Cardinal's seajson opener. With a iistball
reaching speeds of 88-92anph, and a solid breakmg ball
and changeup, Bleich has held opponents to a. IES bat
ting average while posting a 0.77 ERA.
* "For a freshman pitcher he is able to interchange all
three of those pitches for strikes which is the key to
pitching at our level," head coach Mark Marquess said.
"The adjustment from high school to college is can you
throw more than one pitch over for a strike and Jeremy
showed us from the fall up to now that he is able to do
that with all three pitches."
Bleich is part of a large freshman class of 14 this year
but his performance has made him a standout early. He
has come in many times with the game on the line, and
has succeeded in advancing the Cardinal to their cur
rent 9-4 record.
While according to Marquess it is unusual for a
freshman to take on the closer's role, Bleich has adapt
ed well. At first, it was hard for the 6-foot-2 hurler to get
ready quickly, but the transition seems to have worked
for the best, thanks in large part to his mentality.
"Pitching is pitching no matter whether you're pitch
ing in the ninth inning or the first inning — you still
have to get guys out the same way," Bleich said, later
adding that he is completely satisfied in his role as a re
liever.
Bleich has five saves in eight appearances, and did
n't allow an earned run in his first six trips to the mound.
In those first six appearances, Bleich seemed invincible
on the mound. He finally gave up his first earned run
against Fresno State on Feb. 24 and on Feb. 25, the Bull
dogs handed him his first blown save and loss in an out
ing that resulted in three unearned runs. Despite the
blemish on the stat sheet, his team isn't hesitant to hand
the game over to him.
"I've handed the ball over to him twice [Fullerton
and Fresno State] and both times he has come in and
gotten the baserunners out that I left," Reynolds, Stan
ford's righthanded ace said." I feel very confident hand
ing him the ball. I don't think there is a harder worker
on the pitching staff.... When I hand the ball, that's the
kind of guy that I want to hand the ball to."
Now that he knows the important bitter taste of a
loss, Bleich's season seems balanced. He focus is still on
consistency and trying to remain level-headed, though
it seems Bleich has got those two down.
"A lot of guys have the pitches and ability, but it's
how you handle the competition in stressful situa
tions," Marquess said. "And he's proven that he can
handle that."
