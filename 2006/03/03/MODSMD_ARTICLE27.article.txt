# Shoney's swan song
## Being in the FBI is something I have wanted to do since eighth grade. I made a lot of life decisions then. SHONEY HIXSON, senior pinch runner 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
Coming soon to a theater near you — Shoney Hixson,
the singing detective.
Hixson, a senior pinch runner for the No. 5 Stanford
softball team, loves singing as much as Softball, and
dreams of working for the FBI. And it doesn't take a de
tective to know that she can score runs.
At first. Hixson wasn't interested in softball. but after
seeing her younger sister Himmita enjoy the game so
much, she begged to join in. She was seven at the time.
Ihe pair both fell in love with the sport, and now,years
later, Shoney stars at Stanford while Himmita. a junior,
plays for Arizona State.
"I love the camaraderie of it." I lixson said. "I love the
competition. And I love the feeling of being out there on
the field. And the grass and being outside in the sun. I just
like it all."
Even though there was no guarantee that she would
get to play the game she loves, I lixson knew that Stanford
was the place for her.
"I've wanted to come here since I was in eighth grade,"
she said. "It was my first choice regardless of whether I
was going to play or not. So I came out and walked on at
tryouts my freshman year."
llie 5-foot-4 I lixson made the team as a pinch runner
and outfielder,and has used her quickness to rack up runs
for the Cardinal. In 49 appearances as a sophomore pinch
runner, she scored 11 times. As a junior,she also scored 1 1.
This season. I lixson has scored two runs and is I -for-4
at the plate. In her career, she has stolen four bases in six
attempts.
In her first two years on the Farm. I lixson split her time
between her two great passions — softball and singing. In
fact, she quit softball for several months as a freshman to
dedicate her time to the a capella group Everyday People.
"I had been doing softball all my life and I had been
singing also but always put softball first," Hixson said. "So
I wanted to see what it was like to just be a singer for a

year, and then I came hack to the team."
Even when she had left the group, Hixson continued to
sing every chance she got. She has sung the national an
them at several home Softball games over the years and at
every wrestling dual meet this season.
And when there's nothing else to do, hand Hixson a
microphone. During the 2004 College World Series, a tor
nado warning forced the team to seek shelter under
ground.
"We went down into the media room and were hang
ing out," I lixson said. "There were a few people in there
but basically it was just us."
While they waited out the storm. Hixson, an Okla
homa native, was nominated to entertain her teammates
and her hometown press.
"They had the mikes set up for press conferences and
everyone was telling me to go up and sing." she said. "I
said I would if [senior pitcher] Laura [Severson] sang with
me. So Laura and 1 went up there and sangit's Your Love'
by Tim McGraw and Faith Hill. We had a lot of fun."
When her Softball days are done, Hixson wants to get
back into serious singing and hopes to join a choir in
Chicago, where the international relations major will be
attending law school.
"Being in the F BI is another thing I have wanted to do
since eighth grade," she said. "I guess I made a lot of life
decisions then."
Ultimately, the half-Choctaw, half-Cherokee Hixson
wants to return to Oklahoma and work in advocacy or a
related field.
" I want to work for the Choctaws and do something for
them because I think that our tribal government really
needs help." she said.
When she leaves Stanford at the end of the year, Hix
son will most likely leave her softball days behind her.
"My sister and I have talked about coaching together
but she will be in Arizona for probably another five years
getting her schooling done and I'll be in Chicago," she
said. "Maybe it will happen eventually, but I don't see it
right now. I think this will be it for me."
