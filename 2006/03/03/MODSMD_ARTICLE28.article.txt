# Business as usual
## Cal just another opponent, with "a little extra incentive" 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
Listening to junior pitcher Greg
Reynolds talk about his squad s up
coming series against cross-bay neme
sis California, it almost seems that the
storied rivalry between Stanford and
the Golden Bears doesn't exist on the
baseball diamond.
"We're not going to prepare any
other way [than usual]," the 6-foot-7
righthander said."lt's really just anoth
er weekend, and we're going to come
out Friday, Saturday and Sunday and
play hard like always."
Only as an afterthought did he add
that "there's a little extra incentive
against Cal, and a little extra competi
tiveness within the games."
But none of that changes the Cardi
nal's perspective on the job they have
to do this weekend at Berkeley's
Evans Diamond.
"We're just going to take care of
business like we usually do," Reynolds
said.
Considering the strong 9-4 start to
the No. 19 Cardinal's 2006 campaign, it
might be best for them to think of their
three-game showdown against the
Bears (6-5) as nothing more than an
other series. Iheir opponents haven't
seemed to matter much thus far to the
Cardinal, who have won three of their
four series thus far.They head into this
weekend's competition back in the na
tional rankings after taking two of
three from a dangerous Fresno State
squad.
After a disappointing loss to the
Bulldogs last Saturday, Stanford
bounced back to claim the rubber
game of the weekend in exciting fash

ion. Sophomore hurler David Stringer
contributed five clutch innings of
scoreless relief in the win —a per
formance that earned him Pac-10
Pitcher of the Week honors on lUes
day.
"That kind of stuffs really impor
tant for our team right now,"
Reynolds said of Stringer's effort out
of the bullpen. "Whenever someone
goes down, we pick each other up.
Whether it's an error, a bad outing,
walking guys, or giving up hits, you
know the next guy is going to come in
and pick you up, and that's a good
feeling."
Looking to keep their momentum
rolling this weekend, the Cardinal
know they will be up for a challenge
against the unranked California
squad.
"We know that they're a team that
can beat us, so we need to play our
game, play hard and play with confi
dence," senior catcher John Hester
said.
The Bears' pitching staff enters the
upcoming series with a 4.35 combined
ERA, nearly a whole point higher than
the Stanford staffs 3.38 mark. But Cal
ifornia received three sterling starting
performances last weekend from jun
iors Brandon Morrow and Michael
Cooper and freshman Tyson Ross
against UC-Santa Barbara.The Bears'
staff combined to limit the Gauchos to
just two runs in three games.
Still, the Cardinal are confident that
their timely hitting will continue to
produce the runs necessary to com
pete.
"We're just going to stand by our
approach," Hester said. "As a hitter,
you have to have the confidence to be

lieve that you're better than the pitch
er — no matter how well he's throw
ing."
The Stanford lineup has been
steady from top to bottom, coming
through in key situations to back the
team's solid pitching. Sophomore
Michael Taylor (.340 average. 7-game
hitting streak and 13 RBI) and senior
shortstop Chris Minaker (.321 average,
3 HR, 13 RBI) are pacing the Cardinal
in most major offensive categories.
Stanford's starters on the mound
— Reynolds, senior Matt Manship and
junior Matt Leva — will have their
work cut out for them on the mound, as
they face a California lineup that
comes in batting at a .270 clip The Car
dinal hurlers will be particularly wary
of juniors Brennan Boesch and Chris
Errecart, who form an intimidating 4-5
punch in the heart of the California
lineup. In just 11 games thus far, the two
have combined to crank seven home
runs, drive in 13 RBI and collect 43 total
bases.
"Obviously we need to be careful of
those two guys," Hester said. "They
were both preseason Ail-Americans,
but we can't be afraid of them. We need
to attack their weaknesses."
The Stanford squad owns a.50()
record in series openers this season, but
will be looking to improve upon that
mark when Reynolds takes the mound
on Friday afternoon.
"If you go by the numbers, the ram
ifications of winning the first game of
the series are huge," Reynolds said.
"That's one of the things that comes
with my job as the Friday night starter.
We know how important Friday night
is, so everyone's going to be pulling to
gether to get that first win."

upcoming series with a 4.35 combined
ERA, nearly a whole point higher than
the Stanford staffs 3.38 mark. But Cal
ifornia received three sterling starting
performances last weekend from jun
iors Brandon Morrow and Michael
Cooper and freshman Tyson Ross
against UC-Santa Barbara.The Bears'
staff combined to limit the Gauchos to
just two runs in three games.
Still, the Cardinal are confident that
their timely hitting will continue to
produce the runs necessary to com
pete.
"We're just going to stand by our
approach," Hester said. "As a hitter,
you have to have the confidence to be

lieve that you're better than the pitch
er — no matter how well he's throw
ing."
The Stanford lineup has been
steady from top to bottom, coming
through in key situations to back the
team's solid pitching. Sophomore
Michael Taylor (.340 average. 7-game
hitting streak and 13 RBI) and senior
shortstop Chris Minaker (.321 average,
3 HR, 13 RBI) are pacing the Cardinal
in most major offensive categories.
Stanford's starters on the mound
— Reynolds, senior Matt Manship and
junior Matt Leva — will have their
work cut out for them on the mound, as
they face a California lineup that
comes in batting at a .270 clip The Car
dinal hurlers will be particularly wary
of juniors Brennan Boesch and Chris
Errecart, who form an intimidating 4-5
punch in the heart of the California
lineup. In just 11 games thus far, the two
have combined to crank seven home
runs, drive in 13 RBI and collect 43 total
bases.
"Obviously we need to be careful of
those two guys," Hester said. "They
were both preseason Ail-Americans,
but we can't be afraid of them. We need
to attack their weaknesses."
The Stanford squad owns a.50()
record in series openers this season, but
will be looking to improve upon that
mark when Reynolds takes the mound
on Friday afternoon.
"If you go by the numbers, the ram
ifications of winning the first game of
the series are huge," Reynolds said.
"That's one of the things that comes
with my job as the Friday night starter.
We know how important Friday night
is, so everyone's going to be pulling to
gether to get that first win."
