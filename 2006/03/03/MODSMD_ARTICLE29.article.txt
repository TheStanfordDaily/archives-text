## Pursuing perfection We keep shooting ourselves in the foot in the big games. JOHN RITTMAN, head coach 
### ANDREW LOMELI STAFF WRITER 
If the No. 5 Stanford softhall team
wants to collect big wins this week
end at the Worth Classic in Fullerton,
Calif., then the squad will need to
avoid the costly mistakes that robbed
the Cardinal of two victories last
week.
Stanford (14-3) walked home
Texas' only two runs in last Friday's
meeting with the No. 3 Longhorns in
Palm Springs.
And the picture wasn't any pretti
er in the batter's box. Card batters
struck out 16 times against ace pitch
er Cat Osterman, including two in the
bottom of the sixth inning with a run
ner anxiously waiting on third base.
"We keep shooting ourselves in
the foot in the big games," head coach
John Rittman said. "Each time we
played Texas, we opened the doors
for them to score runs with our errors
and walks. We need to eliminate
those mistakes, and we can't afford to
give free outs to good teams in a
seven-inning game."
After being frustrated by Oster
man, the Cardinal offense is also a
concern.
"Offensively, we need to get time

ly hits against good pitching,"
Rittman said.
While the team will look to work
out the kinks this weekend, Rittman
said the squad exhibited many posi
tives in Palm Springs. Most impres
sive was the productivity throughout
the entire lineup.
"I am impressed with our ability to
have different people produce at dif
ferent times," he said. "Last weekend
against [Louisiana State] in the bot
tom of the seventh, it was the lower
half of the lineup that sparked us and
gave us the run to win the game. It's
definitely a team effort."
And that depth will come in handy
against a tough schedule this week
end in Fullerton. The Cardinal will
meet two nationally ranked teams in
No. 2 Tennessee and No. 16 North
western, along with Purdue, UC-
Santa Barbara, and Cal State-Fuller
ton.
Stanford opens up the invitational
Friday against Tennessee (10-0) after
having fallen to the Lady Vols in last
season's NCAA Super Regionals.
Tennessee defeated No. 24 lowa and
Florida State in the NFCA Leadoff
Classic last weekend for the second
best start in school history.
Junior infielder Lindsay Schutzler

leads the Lady Vols' offense with a
.531 average, 12 runs and nine RBI
for the season. Junior pitcher Monica
Abbott has collected a 0.69 ERA for
a 7-0 record.
"Tennessee has a lot of different
great weapons, so it's going to be a
challenge for us right at the get-go
heading into the weekend," Rittman
said.
Just hours after challenging Ten
nessee. the Cardinal then take on
Purdue (8-6), who went 2-1 at last
weekend's Bradley Invitational.
Sophomore Tiffany Krcelich earned
Big 10 Player of the Week Honors for
her .769 batting and four RBI last
weekend.
Stanford opens Saturday with a
contest against UCSB (7-5), who
highlighted its weekend at the Palm
Springs Classic with a 10-1 trouncing
of Ohio State. Junior pitcher Jennifer
Davis' 5-3 record leads the Gauchos
while junior outfielder Kendra Sin
gley leads the offense with a .410 av
erage and eight RBI.
Later that day, the Cardinal meets
Northwestern (8-4), led by senior
pitcher Courtnay Foster's 6-2 record
and 1.96 ERA and senior infielder
kristen Amegin's .382 batting aver
age. Stanford will close the weekend
with a Sunday afternoon match up
with Fullerton (8-7), who upset No. 8
Texas A&M. 6-5. last week.
"We're going to take it one game
at a time," Rittman said. "One thing
we can't do with this kind of tourna
ment is overlook opponents. We're
going to look at Tennessee first and
then work from there. We'd like to
win every game, obviously. But we
need to get better defensively and
more consistent with our pitching
and offense."
Rittman added that the seniors'
leadership will play a large role in es
tablishing the Cardinal's game plan
this weekend as well.
"We've got a lot of leadership, and
it's showing in the ballgames,"
Rittman said. "We're not panicking
or freaking out when we make mis
takes. Our upperclassmen are leading
by example and verbalizing what
they need to do."
