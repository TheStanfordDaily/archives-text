# $20 million funneled to nanotech
## Nanotechnology cancer development to be funded over the next five years 
### SHIRIN SHARIF SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford lias been awarded a $20 million
grant from the National Cancer Institute to he
paid out over the next five years to integrate
nanotechnology into cancer research. Hie
goal is to use nanoscale devices — which can
be as small as one-ten thousandth of a cross

section of human hair — that can slip into liv
ing cancer cells to detect, monitor and treat
cancer.
Professors involved in the project believe
Stanford was chosen due to its history of
strong research in the areas of nanotechnol
ogy, cancer biology and cancer imaging.
Stanford's multidisciplinary approach to the
venture also made the University a prime

candidate because of its unique expertise in
the Schools of Medicine, Engineering and
1 lumanities and Sciences.
"I am very excited that we have been
given the funding to pursue what 1 hope will
lead to many new translational discoveries in
the field of cancer," said project director, Ra
diology Prof. Sanjiv Sam Gambhir and direc
tor the Molecular Imaging Program at Stan

ford. "This is also a great time, as Stanford is
in the process of becoming an NIH-funded
comprehensive cancer center."
The Stanford Medical School will now
house one of eight national Centers of Can
cer Nanotechnology Excellence. Ilns is to be
a broad research alliance among cancer con
ters, medical institutions, schools of engi
neering and physical sciences, nonprofit or
ganizations and private corporations, at
cording to Gambhir.
"This is the first project bringing together
medical faculty and science and engineering
faculty," said Robert Sinclair, a professor in
materials science and engineering, who is
also involved in the project. "It's a really ter
rific development and 1 think our team can
make a significant contribution to cancer di
agnosis and treatment."
Ilie Clark Center and the Bio-X program
will be key components of the team's efforts,
in addition to collaboration with the pro
ject's industrial partners, (II and Intel.
Graduate students and post-doctoral stu
dents are also expected to be involved in the
research and will help to bridge the labs in
volved in the projects, Gambhir said.
"We have as a key goal to train the next
generation of scientists that can bridge quite
different fields in order to tackle and soh
important problems such as cancer," h
added.
According to Gambhir. since the other
seven centers each received $15 to $20 mil
lion, Stanford got one of the highest, if not
the highest, sum. Sinclair believes that the
National Cancer Institute is trying to bring
together different ways of thinking about
early cancer research in this multidiscipli
nary project.
Technically speaking, the center aims to
develop nanotechnologies that can very ac
curately determine low levels of proteins in a
patient's blood before and after cancer ther
apy, which tells if the patient is responding to
the given therapy. An additional goal is to
link these types of in vitro diagnostics to in
vivo molecular imaging with nano-particle
that are injected into a subject to visualize
cancer and response to therapy.
"This will allow many new possibilities in
both novel therapies and diagnostics allow
ing the study of cancer and management of
cancer in a way not previously possible,"
Gambhir said.
