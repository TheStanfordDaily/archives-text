# OSCARS!
## 
### VICTOR FUSTE BETSY CONGDON INTERMISSION OSCAR HOSTS 
We hate running
predictions. Oscar
predictions, Golden
Globe predictions,
predictions on

what you're going

to eat for din-

nerâ€”you name
it and someone
is going to dis
agree with

everything

that you
say. Hence,
we were
hesitant to

even ask for
a preview of

Sunday's
event.

That said, while we enjoyed the Oscar article and
thought that it was amusing, we didn't necessarily agree
with it. Victor, for example, is not a terrible person for not
liking "Brokeback Mountain;" he's a terrible person be
cause he steals from old people. In fact, we think that so
ciety should admire a person who is willing to stand up and
say that he doesn't like a movie not because of the politics
but because he thought that it was aimless and resorted to
cheap melodramatic conventions. So if you don't agree
with the article, send us some hate mail. We don't neces
sarily agree with the predictions or with whatever spiteful
response you may send, but you gotta admit that it's a good
article regardless.
On another topic: facebook for high school and college
have merged to create an awkward bastardized version of
American college student's favorite stalking tool. Those
photos and wall posts that you never wanted people in high
school to see? Free domain, suckah. Hum...a bit upsetting
to say the least. Not that valedictorian,"l can do no wrong"
golden-boy of your hometown anymore, are you? Imagine
if employers were looking at it. Say goodbye to your future
job and any opportunity for self respect.
Enjoy this week, it is the last one before dead week.
Maybe the weather will stay nice. Oh, and don't forget to
send pictures of you sunbathing in the fountain to your
friends who chose East Coast schools. They fucking hate
that.
