# Calder is living The Surreal Life'
## 
### DI DANG INTERMISSION DALI 
"The Surreal Calder", which runs
through May 21 at the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art (SFMoMA),
reclaims Alexander Calder (1889-
1976), most famous for pioneering the
art of mobiles, within the context of the
European avant-garde Surrealist
movement.
Surrealism, which emerged in the
early 20th century, was the artistic re
sponse to the psychoanalysis craze of
the period. Artists such as Marcel
Duchamp, of the legendary urinal, and
Salvador Dalf, of the renowned melt
ing clocks, sought to liberate there-

pressed subconscious. In di
vesting themselves of the
conscious. Surrealists pur
sued a greater plane of real
ity, one uncontaminated by
rationale and social con
structs.
According to Mark
Rosenthal, one of the cura
tors of the exhibit, "No Sur
realist exhibit for the past 20
years have included
Calder." Though Calder
was heavily influenced by
Joan Miro and Piet Mondri
an — other Surrealists —
he is often neglected in ret
rospective accounts of the
movement. As Rosenthal
states, "Calder wasn't really

a card-carrying Surrealist." I'm not
certain what that would entail, but it
sounds like a fun bunch.
The galleries in "The Surreal
Calder" lead you through various Sur
realist themes present in Calder's
work. The first gallery of the exhibit
serves as an introduction to Surreal
ism, with a sampling of works by Rene
\ 1 agritte, Pablo Picasso, and the afore
mentioned Miro. Magritte's "Ceci est
un morceau de fromage (This is a piece
of cheese)" features a small painting of
a piece of cheese, encased in a glass
cake holder, which is then encased
once again within the glass box. The
work is thought-provoking, stimulat-

ing questions of
the arbitrary na
ture of language.
More befuddling
is Miro's "(Paint
ing [The Magic of
Color])". It con
sists of a large gray
canvas with three
spots of colored
paint of varying
sizes. Thus, the
Surrealist sam
pling ranges from
the more literally
concrete to the
confusingly ab
stract.
However,
upon leaving the
first gallery, it is
easy to forget this
presentation of
the fundamentals
of Surrealism due
to the immersion
in Calder. Title
cards at the en
trance of the re
maining rooms

briefly allude back to the other Surreal
ists, but it is otherwise difficult to make
the visual connections between artists.
Publicly replacing Calder back into the
echelons of the Surrealists could have
been facilitated if the work of other
artists was perhaps more distributed

among the entire exhibit.
Unfortunately, most of Calder's
works are neatly tucked away into cor
ners or positioned at an adequate dis
tance from the viewer. This is rather
disappointing, as it prevents the visitor
from being able to interact more close-

ly with Calder's masterpieces.
The inability to walk around his
art and examine it from all angles
dampens the fanciful nature of his
work.
The remaining galleries give a
broad overview of the rest of
Calder's work, presenting it in re
lation to themes of wit and
humor, the universe, the novelty
of objects, foreign creatures and
nature. By highlighting certain
concepts alongside the art, the
viewer is finally able to gain a
stronger understanding of the
whimsical nature of Calder's mo
biles and stabiles. For instance,
the convulsive beauty of "The
Spider" reminds the viewer to
take a step back and reevaluate
his preconception of what a spi
der is and represents. Another
work that cannot afford to be
missed is the exuberant "Her
cules and the Lion". As Calder's
first transition from the stabile to
the mobile, the dynamism of Her
cules wrestling emanates from the
work. The careful wiring of the
sinewy brawn of both man and

creature is definitely noteworthy. Ulti
mately, "The Surreal Calder" succeeds
in presenting a strong selection of
Calder's masterpieces, while also
demonstrating to and reminding audi
ences of his status among the other
great Surrealist artists.
