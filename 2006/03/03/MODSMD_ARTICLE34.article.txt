# Chappelle throws a pretty good 'Block Party'
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN INTERMISSION RICK JAMES 
Everybody's hungry for Dave
Chappelle these days. After giving
his viewers the figurative finger last
year when he bailed on his show for
an "extended holiday" in South
Africa." the general public has had
nothing but the Season 1 and 2
DVDs to fall back on (as well as that
one Comedy Central stand-up spe
cial that's been played, oh, about 30
times now during primetime over
the course of the last year... you
know what I'm saying here?).
So I'd suppose when the news
broke out that a feature-length
Chappelle movie was going to be re
leased. his fans must have been ec
static. But make no mistake, "Dave
Chapelle's Block Party" is by no
means a 100-minute series of "Chap
pelle Show" skits with a music per
formance or two mixedJn. It's actu
ally quite the opposite - a 100-
minute set of musical acts with ran
dom Chappelle-centric comedy
sketches thrown in here and there.
The premise of the movie is fairly
straightforward: Chappelle is throw
ing a "block party" (hence the
movie's title) in some run-down
New York City neighborhood in
front of a very strange couple's
"house" (watch the movie and
you'll know what I mean). Every
body's invited, including a number
of well-known musical artists and

random people who are generously
bused in all the way from the state of Ohio. In
short, it's bound to be zany.
Being fairly low-budget in nature, the end re
sult is a camera crew following Chappelle in order

to tape him and
others before,
during and after
the event. The
final product is a
slew of witty (al
though rather
unrelated)
scenes of fairly
funny Chap-

'Dave Chappelle's Block Party'
Dir. Michel Gondry

pelle-esque comedy mixed with numerous
longish clips of the music performances from the
actual party. These include acts such as the
Fugees, Jill Scott, Kayne West, the Roots, Talib
Kweli and more.
On that note. I've got to give Chappelle some
respect for putting together such a talented and
refreshingly non-commercial collection of musi
cians. However, your enjoyment of this movie
may hinge on your level of interest in these artists
- if you enjoy their music, the movie will be a plea
sure, but if you're not such a fan, it might get a bit

long toward the end. Since my taste tends to lean
toward a different side of the music spectrum (ed
itor's note: uh, by "lean toward a different side"
he means "polar opposite"), there were times
when I got a bit antsy.

But again, there were enough bits of
humor from Chappelle to keep me engaged
for most of the flick. In particular, there are
some fairly priceless moments, such as when
Chappelle attempts (emphasis on "at
tempts") to rap-battle a Mr. T look-a-like, or
when a few young chaps from Ohio recount a
particularly hilarious golfing moment (oh, if
only I could detail it here!).
Overall, there's not a lot to sav other

than that this movie is pretty much be what you
might expect — only with a little less Chappelle
than would be desired. Also, waiting until a re
lease to video would be entirely acceptable (al
though if I were to have attended a showing with
more lively of a crowd than the press folks, per
haps I would feel differently on this point).
And most importantly, like I said before, re
member that this is not just another episode of
the "Chappelle Show." But if you're cool with
that and are dying for more of the man. I say go
for it. After all, he is Rick James.


Ironically, both of the movies reviewed this week have something
to do with city blocks. We really don't know what to make of it,
but its an interesting coincidence, ain't it.
