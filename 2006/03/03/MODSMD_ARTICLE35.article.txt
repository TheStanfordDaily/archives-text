## Watch 'Die Hard,' it's better 
### RYAN LAMPE INTERMISSION THRILL-SEEKER 
In an early sequence from "Die Hard:
With a Vengeance," Bruce Willis and
Samuel L. Jackson's characters are given half
an hour to get from a subway station on the
Upper West Side to a subway station near
Wall Street. If they fail to reach the station in
time, a bomb will detonate. They steal a taxi
cab, drive right through Central Park and fol
low an ambulance through a heavy traffic
jam. The scene culminates with Willis' char
acter climbing into a moving train and madly
trying to dispose of the bomb. The sequence
is thrilling, inventive and infinitely better
than anything in "16 Blocks."
Like "Die Hard: With a Vengeance," "16
Blocks" is an action thriller that pairs Willis
with an up-and-coming-African-American
actor, Mos Def. Willis plays Jack Mosley, an
aging, alcoholic detective. After staying up
the previous night guarding a crime scene,
Mosley is charged with transporting a crimi
nal named Eddie Bunker from his cell to the
courthouse by 10 a.m. For those of you doing
the math, this amounts to 16 blocks in 118
minutes.
Unfortunately, Bunker is a key witness in
a trial involving crooked cops. If he fails to
reach the courthouse in time, the case is
dropped and the cops are off the hook. Need
less to say, the cops in question make travers
ing these 16 blocks a formidable task for the
two protagonists.
"16 Blocks" continues a recent trend for
director Richard Donner. Though Don
ner's early career includes greats such as

"Superman" and "Lethal
Weapon." his recent work is
populated with lesser
movies like "Assassins" and
"Timeline." His new movie
has a decent premise, but the
end result is never as tense
and exciting as it should be.
The audience is rarely in-

formed of where the characters are in rela
tion to the courthouse, and there are few
references to the time remaining. A notion
of time and space is crucial to action
thrillers, and its absence here is devastating.
"16 Blocks" contains numerous
shootouts and chases, hut it also works hard
to function as a redemptive tale for its two
characters. Mosley has a checkered past and
seems to have given up on life, while Bunker
is looking to leave behind his criminal past
and open a bakery in Seattle. By helping
Bunker, Mosley learns that a person can
change. This theme is admirable, particularly
for a big-budget Hollywood action film, but it
never pays off: the characters are far too
cliche to be engaging. Willis, in particular,
has played a disaffected, drunk cop in sever
al movies, like "Striking Distance" and"The
Last Boy Scout," and Defs character is fre
quently irritating,
"16 Blocks" is not an awful movie. An ini
tial confrontation, in which Mosley chooses
to side with Bunker, is surprisingly tense, as is
a short-lived sequence involving a runaway
bus filled with hostages. But, these scenes are
interspersed with shootouts that lack both
energy and impact. Last year's "Assault on
Precinct 13," which also revolved around
crooked cops seeking to eliminate a key wit
ness, was grittier and more satisfying. "As
saulf's R-rating allowed for more thematic
(i.e. violent) content, which made this movie
seem hampered at times by its PG-13 rating.
Ultimately. "16 Blocks" is not as exciting
as other films in its genre. While movies like
"Speed" and "Die Hard: With a
Vengeance" don't attempt to develop

meaningful charac
ters. they stick to
the basics: thrilling
action scenes and a
good sense of pace.
By neglecting these
essentials, "16
Blocks" condemns
itself to failure.
