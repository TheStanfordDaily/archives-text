# THE
						78™ ANNUAL ACADEMY AWARDS'
## SUNDAY MARCH 5, 2006 5PM PT/8PM ET abc 
### KELLY PETERSON INTERMISSION CARPET WATCHER 
American moviegoers may

remember 2006 as the year Oscar
questioned his sexuality... if they

even saw this year's best picture
contenders. "Brokeback Mountain"
was the most successful of the nomi-

nees, grossing $73 million — not too

shabby considering it only cost $14
million to make. Unlike previous
years, the Oscar race is notably absent

of a big budget vs. small artsy rivalry
(think "Aviator" and 'Million Dollar

Baby," or "Lord of the Rings" and... well,
that didn't really have much competition).

which suggests that the awards show is re
turning to its roots, celebrating the craft of

filmmaking. Unfortunately, this also suggests
that a large chunk of potential Oscar-watchers

won't have an interest in who wins and who loses.

Most viewers will only turn in for Jon Stewart, con
sidering that more people regularly watch "'The Daily

Show with Jon Stewart" than have seen "Munich." Is
this a bad thing? Nah, but you'd think that they could

have thrown "Mr. And Mrs. Smith" in the mix, just to get
Brad and Angelina out on the red carpet.

Best Picture Nominees: "Brokeback Mountain," "Capote,"
"Crash," "Good Night, and Good Luck," "Munich"

Who Should/Will win: "Brokeback Mountain." This film has it all:

a slew of impeccable performances, a masterful presentation of

pressing social issues and a heartbreaking storyline. It doesn't hurt

that the expansive shots of Wyoming's landscape will appeal to many

an American sentimentalist voter. "Crash" has the greatest chance of

unseating "Brokeback," not only because of its unique portrayal of race

relations, but also bccausc it got everyone talking. Unfortunately for "Crash,"'

its early release may have hurt it in the Oscar race. Most of the buzz surrounding the

film fizzled away over the summer. Though critics seemed to have had high expectations

for "Munich," especially with Spielberg being Oscar's not-so-secret love child, it only reached

"almost as good as Brokcback" status. With Golden Globe winner "Walk the Line" conspicuously

absent from the category, "Brokcback" retains the most momentum and hype. Pass us the tissues, and

pass them the Oscar.

Best Acton Phillip Seymour Hoffman ("Capote"), Terrence Howard ("Hustle and Flow"), Heath Ledger ("Brokeback

Mountain"), Joaquin Phoenix ("Walk the Line"), David Strathairn ("Good Night, and Good Luck")

Who Should/Will win: Phillip Seymour Hoffman ("Capote"). Take Hoffman out of "Capote" and you have about 12 minutes of film and

nothing to write home about, much less to nominate for Best Picture. Hoffman captured the essence of Truman Capote so diligently that he made

audience members simultaneously hate and respect him. Though Phoenix may have captured the essence of the Man in Black to a similar degree. Hoff-

man bears the sole weight of the film in a less formulaic role. Heath Ledger also outperformed anyone's expectations in "Brokeback," but this is where Oscar
politics come into play: Hoffman's portfolio dwarfs that of Ledger (" 10 Things 1 Hate About You," anyone?), and he has simply been around longer. Hoff-

man as Truman Capote is a once in a lifetime, Oscar-worthy role, and voters will see that Ledger's got plenty of time lor a repeat.

Best Actress: Reese
Withcrspoon ("Walk
the Line"). Judi Dench
("Mrs. Henderson Pre
sents"), Felicity Huff
man , ("Transameri
ca"), Kcira KnightJcy
("Pride and Prcju
dice ']), Charlize
Theron ("North Coun
try")
Who Should Win:
Reese Witherspoon
("Walk the Line").
Reese was dazzling as
June Carter Cash, who
she portrayed with sur
prising facility and ani
mation. She was June
on stage, singing coun
try music with a smile,
on tour, resisting John
ny's forthcomings, and

at home, smoothing out John
ny's rougher edges and essen
tially saving his life. What I loved

mittl about Reese in this role is that

she made the sugar and spice, soft yet
tough aspect of Cash's personality look

so easy, and I'm sure that it was anything
but. Perhaps I'm just a sucker for country
music.

Who Will Win: Felicity Huffman
("Transamerica"). Huffman did everything
that Oscar voters love women to do to get an

Oscar: she made herself ugly (think Charlize

Theron in "Monster") and did a gender role-re
versal, portraying a preoperative malc-to-fcmale

transsexual. Huffman is also on top of her game in
her career, and having a weekly reminder of her ex
istence with "Desperate Housewives" doesn't hurt

Then again, Judi Dench might surprise everyone and
sneak through, but only because she's getting that old.

Hell, she deserves an Oscar for getting out of bed in the morning.

Best Supporting Acton Paul Ciiamatti ("Cinderella Man"), George
Clooney ("Syriana"), Matt Dillon ("Crash"), Jake Gyllenhaal
("Brokeback Mountain"), William Hurt ("A History of Violence")

Who Should/Will win: I have no idea. Oscar voters may feel badly about not
nominating Giamatti for "Sideways," and the Oscar committee is big on repay-

ing overduedebts, but Clooney's performance in "Syriana" may take the cake be
cause everyone likes him and he had to gain 30 pounds for the role (which 1 don't

see as too much of a sacrifice). Voters may also choose him to compensate for snub-

bing him in the best director category. Too bad for Clooney, however, I don't think any
one actually understood "Syriana" enough to say whether or not he did a good job.

This leaves Gyllenhaal, who shouldn't be in this category anyway since he is on screen
almost as much Heath Ledger, who is considered a lead. With so much confusion and

underground politics, 1 wouldn't be surprised if Matt Dillon went home with the stat
ue — especially after rebounding from "Beverly Hills, 90210."

Best Supporting Actress: Rachcl Weisz ("The Constant Gardener"), Amy Adams
("Junebug"), Catherine Keener ("Capote"), Frances McDormand ("North Coun
try"), Michelle Williams ("Brokeback Mountain")

Who Should Win: Catherine Keener ("Capote"). Keener had a great year career-wise, appealing to mass audi-

ences with "40 Year-Old Virgin" and stretching her acting musclcs as Harper Lee in "Capote." Though Hoffman car-

ried the film, she provided an excellent crutch, and therein lies the beauty of a supporting role. Keener acted as the li-

aison between the audience and Truman Capote, giving the film a relatable character and somehow illuminating some of

the more mystifying aspects of the leading role. She was an excellent match for the role, and complemented Hoffman beau
tifully, but 1 think that she will prove easier to ignore than the competition.

Who Will Win: Rachcl Weisz ("The Constant Gardener"). Don't get me wrong about Weisz — she's only one notch below Keener in
my book, and her performance in the role of a murdered social activist was fantastic, but Keener meshed with Capote so naturally that 1 have

a hard time not giving her an edge. That said, Weisz is probably still going to win, since it's hard to resist such a moving portrayal of a politically
poignant character. She's also got the most momentum, after having won over the S.A.G. and the Golden Globe committee. As for the other

nominees, Michelle Williams' performance is overshadowed and unnoticeable in comparison to the cowboys', and I

wonder if Anne Hathaway would have been the more appropriate nominee. A win for Adams would certainly be

a dark horse, considering that no one has even heard of "Junebug," and though McDormand is a veteran, her

role wasn't complex enough for an Oscar

Best Director: George Clooney ("Good Night, and Good Luck"), Paul Haggis ("Crash"), Ang Lee
("Brokeback Mountain"), Bennett Miller ("Capote"), Steven Spielberg ("Munich")

Who Should/Will Win: Ang Lee ("Brokeback Mountain"). Lee brought America a controversial film that
no one seems to have anything bad to say about. "Brokeback" has become a litmus test for our society — if

you didn't like it, you're no longer a good person. Even Howard Stern gave it a rave review, saying it was one
of the best movies he's ever seen... not that we should necessarily trust him. But Stern's opinion aside, Holly
wood is unanimous in complimenting Lee's cinematography, portrayal of homosexuality and adaptation of
Proulx's short story. It doesn't hurt that Lee is so "Aw, shucks," about it, considering that modest people in the
industry are as rare as celebrity marriages that last a lifetime. Clooney could steal some of Lee's thunder, since

the Oscar committee likes to reward actors who branch away from their original profession, a la Clint

Eastwood, but otherwise, even Spielberg doesn't seem to stand a chance

The Oscars will air on Sunday at 5 P.M. on ABC. America will be watching with unbridled an
ticipation for the outfits, Joan and Melissa Rivers (who are too hatcablc to be allowed on TV
— they probably didn't even like "Brokeback Mountain"), and for Jon Stewart. Hopefully they
won't script all the humor out of him like they did to Chris Rock (they won't cause he is white
and Jewish). As far as the actual awards go, however, we'll probably care a lot more about the
presenters than the winners and losers, especially since a huge chunk of exceptionally beautiful
people were mysteriously omitted from the nominees. Of course, I'll be rooting for Jake Gyl
icnhaal, Keira Knightley, and Heath Ledger, but if Judi Dench has to hobble on stage for an

acceptancc spccch, I'm investing in a TiVo.



Let the cat fight begin! Best Actress Nominees Reese Witherspoon ("Walk the
Line") and Felicity Huffman ("Transamerica") get ready to scratch their eyes
out and pretend to act surprised when Judi Dench takes home the trophy.
