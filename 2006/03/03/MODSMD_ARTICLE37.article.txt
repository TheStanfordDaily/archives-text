# Midseason Workout!
## 
### MATTY SMITH INTERMISSION COUCH POTATO 
With midseason cuts over, television stations have
begun the tedious task of finding passable shows to fill
all the empty slots in their primetmte schedules. From
four brand new series — three comedies and one
drama — it's readily apparent that originality doesn't
have much place in the newest television lineup. It's not
all bad, though, because while we've already seen much
of what the newest shows have to offer, several offer
much more than what's already on your regular view
ing schedule.
"Sons And Daughters/' ABC,
Premieres Tuesday, March 7,9:00 p.m.
Easily the best new show on TV (at least, of this
post-ruidsoason season), "Sons and Daughters" will
do a great deal to fill in the comedy void left behind by
the cancellation of "Arrested Development." Pro
duced by "Saturday Night Live's" Lome Michaels,
"Sons" revolves around the extended family of
Cameron, and is filmed in a frantic, quickly-paced style
that seems to have been recorded with a handheld
camera — think of a more family-oriented "Curb
Your Enthusiasm." Always charming and often hilar
ious with its tongue-in-cheek and subtle tone, the show
succeeds mostly because of its liberal use of an ensem
ble cast — the "extended" feature of the family allows
the show to switch to different families and households
at any time before it has a chance to lag. And, while the
adults of the cast do a great job. it is the surprisingly
funny performances of the kids that take the show to a
more-than-special level. The youth always manage to
be cute without being obnoxious, all the while with a
great feeling of honesty. The greatest lines of the first
few episodes belong to the kids — "Aunt Rae says
we're all going to hell...because we're Jews!" a tutu
wearing four-year-old exclaims joyfully, oblivious of
what she's saying, while in another instance a thirteen
year-old with thick-rimmed glasses and imposing
braces (who in most other cases would come off as the
most typically annoying character) remarks that a har
monica is "like a little piano in your mouth." While the
laugh track-less fast-paced style is nothing new (ever
since "Malcolm in the Middle," traditional sitcoms
have been disappearing steadily), what separates
"Sons" from its competition is the earnest sincerity be
tween the relatives. It truly feels like you're watching a
real family, and all the respect, regret, love and shame
that comes with it. Hopefully, "Sons and Daughters"
will succeed, and we'll be watching this family for a
long time.
"Conviction/' NBC,
Premieres Fridav, March 3,10 p.m.
Here's an original idea: How about a drama, about
lawyers 0 Yes. "Gmviction's premise is nothing new.
Created by "Law and Order'"s Dick Wolf, it even fea
tures "L&O:SVU'"s ADA Bureau Chief Alex Cabot.
"Conviction's" separating feature is its focus on the
younger members of a district attorney's office and
their troubles due to inexperience. Fortunately, the
show hits this angle hard, imbuing itself with a strong
sense of style and an intensity not found on most law

shows. It may be the same basic formula (check scene,
get witness, go to court, celebrate/lament), but that for
mula is improved upon through creative changes. For
instance, the pilot has newcomer assistant DA Nick
thrown into the middle of a controversial case com
plete with terrified witnesses and even a murdered
member of the DA team. Also, it uses more original —
if not always realistic — events and interactions. It
may be unusual that a new lawyer doesn't know how
to handle her first case's objections (Didn't she go to
law school? Jeez, I learned that stuff in high school
mock trial...), but her emotional troubles in dealing
with the case do make for good entertainment. "Con
viction's" ensemble cast (post-"Lost"/"Housewives,"
everything's an ensemble) also performs admirably,
with no standouts, but a series of equally gifted young
actors. If the show survives, it has a chance of being the
next great law show — entertaining no matter how
many times we've seen it before.
"Free Ride," FOXa /
Sundays 9:30 p.m.
There's one good thing to say about "Free Ride"
— it's on FOX, whose historically poor handling of
new shows almost guarantees that this one will flop
within its first month. Yet again, we see the laugh
track-less formula played out — this time about a col
lege graduate going home to live with his parents. But,
unlike "Sons," the jokes themselves have been heard a
million times before. The reuse of a formula is okay if
something new or different or at least entertaining is
done with it, but "Free Ride" falls flat. For one, it asks
us to sympathize with lead character Nate — but he is
so annoyingly played that it's difficult to find any sort
of connection. The show hinges on Nate's embarrass
ment of his hometown, but the only one he should be
embarrassed of is his himself. The show also doesn't
seem to know how it wants its characters to be viewed
— is it funny or just annoying that Nate is so adamant
in thinking that you never need to change a car's oil? I
wonder how he got through college assuming that one.
Nate's parents are confusing as well, at times overly
goofy, at others a voice of reason, sometimes random
ly hateful toward Nate, other times overly loving.
Hopeless go-nowhere high school friend Dove (por
trayed condescendingly as a failure, even though he's
become assistant manager of a department store and is
so far more successful than Nate) comes off mostly like
a failed audition for Jack Black's role in "Orange
County." Worst of all is that there is no sense of respect
for anything involved — it's as if Nate thinks he's
above all the craziness of his hometown. Someone
should tell him he's the most irritating of all. Let it die,
FOX.
'The Loop/' FOX,
Premieres Wednesday, March 15,9:30 p.m.
There's one bad thing to say about "The Loop" —
it's on FOX. whose historically poor handling of new
shows almost guarantees that this one will flop within
its first month. Another member of the new breed of
sitcoms (no laugh track, one lead with crazy world
around him), " The Loop" is a show with great poten-
tial. A sort of cross between "The Office" and "Scrubs,"
"The Loop" centers on Sam, a recent college graduate who
is the first of his friends to get a job — as an executive of a
major airline. The show bounces back and forth between his
serious working life (complete with mentally special boss
and snarky secretary) and his home life (complete with
hopeless/jobless brother and a best friend he's been in love

with for years), and unlike "Free Ride," it has characters
that both the audience and the show's creators can love. The
first few episodes were a little inconsistent (most comedies
don't jump out of the starting gate as well as "Sons" does),
but made it clear that the show will only get better over time,
and if given a chance could turn out to be one of the best
comedies on TV. FOX, don't let this one die.
