## The 						Roxies 
### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION SEX GODDESS 
It's Oscar time once again and there is still no "Best Shag' Award. Thau
makes Roxy sad. to say the least. So, for this issue, Roxy is going to have aifl

awards ceremony of her own — the Roxies.

flie Nominees:
1. Best Position by an Actress:

Angelina Jolie with "Reverse Cowgirl"
Jennifer Aniston with "Missionary"

Isla Fisher (Gloria from "Wedding Crashers") with "Woman-on-TopH

while-the-Man-is-Tied-Down-with-Ropes"
2. Most Likely to Have a Costume Fetish:

Vince Vaughn in "Wedding Crashers"

Johnny Depp (in any movie).

Christian Bale in "Batman Begins"

3. Best Shag (Women):

Angelina Jolie in "Mr. and Mrs. Smith"
Natalie Portman in "Closer"
Hermione in "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"

4. Best Shag (Men):

Brad Pitt in "Fight Gub"
Paul Walker in "Fast and the Furious"
Ryan Reynolds in "Van Wilder"

Tlie Winners Are: !
1. A tough choice. For all you Team Aniston and Team Jolie fans, you'll
be disappointed to hear that the winner is Isla Fisher. "Wedding Crash{
ers" is just racking it up, but that girl can get it on. She knows what
wants from a man and she goes after it. Any man (or woman) with com*

mon sense will agree that "Woman-On-Top-While-thc-Man-is3
Tied-Down-with-Ropes" is the best position because the womeifl

can please themselves to their hearts content, and the man can be a lazy ass and lad

there watching. It's a win-win situation.
2. You would think that Christian Bale would be a shoe-in tor this category.

since he does dress up in a bat-suit, a kinky choice to say the least. Howev
er, the winner is Johnny Depp. Edward Scissorhands, Willy Wonka, Jack
Sparrow... Depp loves to dress up. and so does Roxy. Roxy would wear
gold caps on her teeth if that's what turned on Mr. Depp. In fact, Roxy

would get some scissor-hands and cut his hair if he were so inclined, or she

could just go with the traditional French maid outfit. Growr!

3. For those of you who think that the clear winner in this category is

Hermione — you are perverts! The girl is like 15 years old and that's still

illegal in most states. The real winner is Angelina Jolie. Granted, Natal
ie Portman came in a close second — her portrayal as a stripper defi-

nitely got a few men very happy — but it really is no competition. She
may not be a stripper, but Jolie is the only woman Roxy would ever go
lesbian for. Just look at her: that body, that face, those lips — Jolie is

perfection. Roxy doesn't blame Brad for dumping Jen. If you need

proof of her stamina, just watch her kick some major ass in "Tomb

Raider," or kick Brad Pitt's ass in "Mr. and Mrs. Smith." Even after

a killing spree, she's ready for some steamy makeup sex. Damn...

a threesome with Brangelina... that'd he heaven for Roxy.

4. This category was especially difficult, since these three

men happen to be obsessions of Roxy's. However, looking
at the individual movies, the clear-cut winner is Brad Pitt.
Why? Two words: sex muscles. Nothing compares with a

chiseled, sweaty, beefy hunk of a man who fights. Pitt is half-

naked for most of the movie, and his character is definitely a man

who would throw you down and getdrough. Wh00... he's the only man
that makes Roxy giggle like a schoolgirl. But don't get Roxy wrong, pret
ty boys are alright, but give Roxy a "Fight Club" man any day. Pitt is a

real man — a hottie that makes Roxy want to do some really naughty
things not fit to print. On that note, if you'll excuse me, Roxy needs some

time alone with her copy of "Fight Gub."
