## The 						Veronicas should have Jable Danced with Betty 
### SINI MATIKAINEN INTERMISSION EIGHTH NOTE 
The first CD I ever bought was in seventh grade,
based on a song I heard on the Disney Channel. It
was from a girl band called Bewitched, except that
the band had oh-so-cleverly replaced the first "e"
with a star.
Today, I am unashamed to say that 1 know all the
lyrics to "Hollaback Girl," "My Humps" and a
good deal of "Oops, I Did It Again." (Ifby"agood
deal" one means "every word, even including the
weird "Titanic" interlude in the middle.")
This goes to show that I am not above pop music
— far from it. We're actually about the same
height, and sometimes we borrow each other's
clothes. So when I started listening to "The Secret
Life 0f..." by the Veronicas, I went in without pre
conceptions.

Okay, I went in thinking that the Veronica on the

back of the CD sporting waist-high, baggy.

plaid purple shorts and too-dark lipstick

had made an unfortunate decision, but

besides that I went in without precon-

ceptions.
Turns out "The Secret Life of..."is

not good pop music.

It might have been if it
accepted that it was pop music.

but it doesn't, and therein lies

its major flaw. The CD has

a few songs inviting the lis-

tener to go party, some
talking about how won-

derful her/their boyfriend is, some talking about
how terrible her/their ex-boyfriend is, one telling
the guy to get out of her/their face, etc. (I say
her/their because, though there are supposedly two
of them, I can neither vocally nor visually tell the dif
ference between them. For all I know, it might ac-

tually be the same girl dressed up in
two equally terrible outfits).

The Veronicas' music is not un
pleasant to listen to, but it's almost
too inoffensive. Even when
screaming, the singers sound like

they don't want to

yell too loud

and risk
making

th e
song

sound un-

pleasant. It smacks of hav-

ing been run by a focus group too many times, until
any spark of originality or catchiness long since dis
appeared.
Because, I think, that's what can redeem pop
music. Pop music can be good when it's weird or
funny or well-written or just really damn catchy.
But the Veronicas fail on all counts. Even after lis
tening to some of their songs as many as three times
(at 42 minutes for the entire CD, it doesn't take
long), I can't remember a single melody. The songs

didn't motivate me to dance so much as to do Fxon
problem sets.
And the lyrics were as tired and uninspired as di
alogue for a bad WB show: "Hold on tight/ I'm a
revolution/ Close your eyes/1 am, 1 am/ I'll blow
your mind/1 am/ I'm a revolution/ Why do I have to

explain who I am again and
again?"
The only lyric that
stood out in my mind at all was
one from "Secret," a song
about a girl and what sounds
like her stalker. "You're a little
obsessed with me/ And I'm a
little bit scared of you." she
sings uncertainly at the begin
ning. But toward the middle of

the song, she non-sequiturs, "I never

looked at you that way/1 always thought

you were gay."
Is that supposed to be an excuse? A way

of putting off her suitor? A slightly offensive dig at

his sexuality? But something about the context sug
gests that maybe the guy is less of a stalker and more

a poor boy hopelessly devoted to a girl at his high
school who just makes a face and says, "Prom?
With you? I thought you were gay." Unfortunately,
these quasi-amusing lyrics are an exception to the
rule.
All that aside, the band might find favor with the
pre-teen set, which is probably its target demo
graphic anyway. Their songs are the generic kind
that blends in quite well with Disney Channel orig
inal movies.
