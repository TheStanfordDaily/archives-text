## Tree trimming under way Band selects those who will make it to the final round 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
Yesterday, Band management interviewed the Tree
candidates at the Band Shak. narrowing down the field
to "five to six finalists," according to junior Bryan Schell,
TYee Week coordinator. Among those who arc still in the
game are junior Christina Zempel and sophomore
Daniel Novinson. Hie winner will be announced Sun
day.
ITie previous Tree, coterminal student Erin Lashnits,
reflected positively on this year's Tree Week.
"Looking back on the week. 1 think it went smashing
ly," Lashnits said. "I saw a lot of public nudity, insanity
and humiliation, as well as the usual sex, drugs and rock
and roll.'Hie candidates all proved they're heavy metal
and it's a shame that out of a pool of so many mind-blow

ing contestants only one. come Sunday, will be the
Tree."
Hie details of the selection process — who exactly
chooses the next tree and how — are shrouded in secre
cy. Virtually no specifics have been released to the public,
with Lashnits' comments only adding to the confusion.
"All the rumors you've ever heard are true," she said.
Meanwhile, many candidates said they were con
vinced that they would prove to be the best Tree.
"I'll be crazier, spunkier and more charismatic than
all the old Trees put together,but my Freedom isn't going
to just be about me, me, me," said sophomore Daniel
Novinson. managing editor of sports for Die Daily. "I
love this school so much, so I really want to make people
proud of Stanford, and maybe, God forbid, get them to
actually cheer for our sports teams."
Novinson continued to comment on his prospective
life as'lVee.

"I'm going to create memories of a lifetime
with the Band, next year's Dollies and all the
fans, especially the cute buxom blonde ones,"
he said. "It's something I've wanted to do ever
since I first saw the Tree two days after 1
stepped on this campus — and it's something
I'd do with as much pizzazz as anything — or
anyone — I've done in my entire life."
When asked about his plans for the remain
der of Tree Week, Novinson told The Daily
that he plans to kick his antics up a notch.
"1 will continue to sleep only in a tent in
White Plaza, not change clothes or shower,
and not talk, except about Tree," he said. "I will
take my sacrifices to a new level and announce
I will not eat or drink until a new Tree is
crowned. I will also be renting a helicopter and

climbing down the rope into the Band Shak
like a Marine for my final stunt, so be on the
lookout for that."
Zempel, who claimed to have performed
Swan Lake yesterday on the shores of lake Lagu
nita with 1(X) men clad in pink tutus, offered her
reasoning for why she is more eligible than any
other candidate to be named the next mascot.
"Known as the human catapult, I have built
a reputation in Eastern Europe for the ability
to fold complex origami while being launched
through the sky," Zempel said."My tears rean
imate dead kittens. I once beat Chuck Norris.
My eyes shoot lasers when I'm tired, and I
breathe fire. I am the original inspiration for
the TV show MacGyver. I spent the middle ten
years of my life in a monastery in Japan learn
ing sacred fighting arts. Bruce Lee is my father.
When I kill an animal, I use every part and
waste nothing. I speak 18 languages. Also, I
swam the English Channel.Twice."
The Band will crown the new Tree on Sun
day morning.
