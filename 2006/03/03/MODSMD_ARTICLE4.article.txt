## Tree trimming under way Band selects those who will make it to the final round 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
Yesterday, Band management interviewed the Tree
candidates at the Band Shak. narrowing down the field
to "five to six finalists," according to junior Bryan Schell,
TYee Week coordinator. Among those who arc still in the
game are junior Christina Zempel and sophomore
Daniel Novinson. Hie winner will be announced Sun
day.
ITie previous Tree, coterminal student Erin Lashnits,
reflected positively on this year's Tree Week.
"Looking back on the week. 1 think it went smashing
ly," Lashnits said. "I saw a lot of public nudity, insanity
and humiliation, as well as the usual sex, drugs and rock
and roll.'Hie candidates all proved they're heavy metal
and it's a shame that out of a pool of so many mind-blow

ing contestants only one. come Sunday, will be the
Tree."
Hie details of the selection process — who exactly
chooses the next tree and how — are shrouded in secre
cy. Virtually no specifics have been released to the public,
with Lashnits' comments only adding to the confusion.
"All the rumors you've ever heard are true," she said.
Meanwhile, many candidates said they were con
vinced that they would prove to be the best Tree.
"I'll be crazier, spunkier and more charismatic than
all the old Trees put together,but my Freedom isn't going
to just be about me, me, me," said sophomore Daniel
Novinson. managing editor of sports for Die Daily. "I
love this school so much, so I really want to make people
proud of Stanford, and maybe, God forbid, get them to
actually cheer for our sports teams."
Novinson continued to comment on his prospective
life as'lVee.
