### TAM VO CHRIS HOLT INTERMISSION TOKEN HOGS 
The Subways are the latest in a swarm of
bands to ride the coattails of the British rock in
vasion Their debut album "Young for Eternity"
is aptly named, seeing as two-thirds of the band is
under the age of 21. We might excuse them for
their youth, but we'd rather save some time and
listen to The Arctic Monkeys {also under 21) in-

stead.
TAM: The album opens
with the jumpy "I Want to
Hear What You've Got to
Say," but after attempting
to get through the entire
album a few times without
skipping tracks, I decided
I didn't really want to hear
what this band wants to say.

This high-energy, youthfully defiant opening
track has promise, but it just didn't sustain my in
terest. Sounding like Oasis on downers—it just
made me feel angsty.
CHRIS: "I Want..." is putting their best foot
forward. It's a catchy song that starts with an
acoustic, seemingly defiant, gritty Brit punk-in-

'Young for Eternity'
The Subways

fluenced verse about failed love. The lyrics are
pretty simple, but then the beat picks up and the
song builds into a solid rock tune. For being a
high water mark, it's unfortunately forgettable
and hints at the shortcomings of "Young for
Eternity."
TAM: "The 0.C." has already packaged
"Rock and Roll Queen" as a radio-friendly sin
gle into the show's fifth soundtrack mix. which
has become a rite of passage for any UK band

hoping to jump the Atlantic these
days.
CHRIS: Tam and I agree
we've heard it before. The Sub
ways seem to follow the formula
that British bands must discuss the
"rock-and-roll" lifestyle and senti
ments of urban jadedness.
TAM: On a similar note of
failed romantic intent, "With You"

is fairly sloppy: "My best days are with you /
They are so easy I They are so easy" sums up this
tune. The syncopation of drums and guitar con
jures up both Franz Ferdinand and Foo Fight
ers, but sloppy songwriting and predictable
chord progressions leave the song uninspired.
I'll admit there's an infectious hook, bolstered
by the dual vocals of Lunn and Cooper.

The lyrical blunders of the album continue in
"Mary." The Subways display impeccable
rhyming skills, with gems that Dr. Seuss would
be proud of, such as "Mary is my best friend /
She makes me my tea / She lets me stay around
her place / when there's nowhere else to be."
Unfortunately, this instance of lyrical genius will
loop its way into your head, which is a red flag
for retardation.
CHRIS: Here's my dramatic reenactment of
how The Subways write a song: "Mary... drinks
my tea... uh, what rhymes with tea? TV! Late-ly!
Me! Tea again! Perfect! We're done!" Ironical
ly, if this had been an actual song writing session,
the songwriters would be rolling in money while
the ghosts of The Clash roll over in their graves
and blood shoots out my nose.
IAM: When I heard "She sun" my immediate
thought was: "This song would be a lot better if it
was tided 'She-Ra.'
CHRIS: I will start a British band that's ded
icated entirely to Masters of the Universe.
TAM: There are moments where this trio
verges on creating something new, where they
almost make good on all the hype that's sur
rounded them for the past year. You want to like
them, you really do. Unfortunately, one of the
best moments is in the final two minutes of the

penultimate track, "Somewhere," locked within
the frenetic, driving buildup and the song's un
intelligible refrain. This is where they come clos
est to conveying the youthful spirit that's absent
elsewhere. Ideally, the album would stop here.
CHRIS: The latter half of "Somewhere" is
this weirdly haunting, strangely different song
from the rest of the album. The chorus(?) of
"Nah nah nah" works despite its seeming silli
ness, and there is a raw energy to it I cannot
deny. The first song of this album is decent and
there are a couple songs that actually build the
guitar riffs and drum beats into solid rock
tunes. The problem is these moments of a
unique and vibrant sound are almost iost in a
sea of forced energy', unoriginal guitars and
lazy lyrics. I just didn't really feel like they
wanted to make this album, the band seemed to
have to do it as a homework assignment one
night. Lunn at one point sings: "I'm so lazy."
It's perhaps the most honest thing these kids
have to say.
SOUNDS LIKE (but doesn't come close to):
The poor man's White Stripes, The Arctic Mon
keys, The Strokes, The Vines, every band that
starts with "The,"and Jet, the band that imper
sonates every other mediocre garage rock band
But now with female vocals!

"Mary." The Subways display impeccable
rhyming skills, with gems that Dr. Seuss would
be proud of, such as "Mary is my best friend /
She makes me my tea / She lets me stay around
her place / when there's nowhere else to be."
Unfortunately, this instance of lyrical genius will
loop its way into your head, which is a red flag
for retardation.
CHRIS: Here's my dramatic reenactment of
how The Subways write a song: "Mary... drinks
my tea... uh, what rhymes with tea? TV! Late-ly!
Me! Tea again! Perfect! We're done!" Ironical
ly, if this had been an actual song writing session,
the songwriters would be rolling in money while
the ghosts of The Clash roll over in their graves
and blood shoots out my nose.
IAM: When I heard "She sun" my immediate
thought was: "This song would be a lot better if it
was tided 'She-Ra.'
CHRIS: I will start a British band that's ded
icated entirely to Masters of the Universe.
TAM: There are moments where this trio
verges on creating something new, where they
almost make good on all the hype that's sur
rounded them for the past year. You want to like
them, you really do. Unfortunately, one of the
best moments is in the final two minutes of the

penultimate track, "Somewhere," locked within
the frenetic, driving buildup and the song's un
intelligible refrain. This is where they come clos
est to conveying the youthful spirit that's absent
elsewhere. Ideally, the album would stop here.
CHRIS: The latter half of "Somewhere" is
this weirdly haunting, strangely different song
from the rest of the album. The chorus(?) of
"Nah nah nah" works despite its seeming silli
ness, and there is a raw energy to it I cannot
deny. The first song of this album is decent and
there are a couple songs that actually build the
guitar riffs and drum beats into solid rock
tunes. The problem is these moments of a
unique and vibrant sound are almost iost in a
sea of forced energy', unoriginal guitars and
lazy lyrics. I just didn't really feel like they
wanted to make this album, the band seemed to
have to do it as a homework assignment one
night. Lunn at one point sings: "I'm so lazy."
It's perhaps the most honest thing these kids
have to say.
SOUNDS LIKE (but doesn't come close to):
The poor man's White Stripes, The Arctic Mon
keys, The Strokes, The Vines, every band that
starts with "The,"and Jet, the band that imper
sonates every other mediocre garage rock band
But now with female vocals!
