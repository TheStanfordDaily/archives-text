# SPECIAL SPEAKER
## When architecture meets the real world Speaker analyzes Katrina and Sept. 11 from architectural view 
### ANDREA FULLER STAFF WRITER 
Pulitzer Prize winner Paul Goldberger took the
podium at Annenberg Auditorium last night to speak
about architecture's relationship to two of the greatest
crises of recent times — the World IVade Center disas
ter and I lurricane Katrina. As a Christensen Fund Dis
tinguished Visiting Lecturer, Goldberger gave a pres

entation entitled "After the World Trade Center and
Katrina: Rethinking the City for Our Time."
Goldberger is the dean of Parsons School for Design
and an architecture critic for The New Yorker. A recip
ient of the Pulitzer Prize for his architecture criticism
and a writer at The New York limes for 25 years, he fo
cuses on social and political implications of design.
Goldberger has also authored several books, most re
cently "Up from Zero: Politics, Architecture, and the
Rebuilding of New York."
Goldberger began the lecture by speaking about
New York and his book titled "Up from Zero." I le fo
cused his lecture on the rebuilding of Ground Zero and

expressed his pessimism regarding its progress.
"Lately.it has not been encouraging," he said.'Mt has
taken something of a nosedive in the last few months
and has turned into a complicated, dreary mess. This
story is indeed more about politics than architecture. It
is no exaggeration to say that Ground Zero is the great
est urban design challenge of the 21st Century."
Goldberger compared the problem to that of re
building New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.
"The problem in New Orleans is vastly more se
vere since the existence of the city as we've known it is
at stake," Goldberg said. "We feared that would he the
case in New York in the awful weeks after Sept. 11, hut it
turned out not to he. What happened in New Orleans is
a different kind of killing — the potential death of the
city itself."
He then tracked the history of the World Trade Center
as a part of the New York skyline.
"Looking back at the short life of the World Trade Cen
ter, there were three distinct phases," he said. "The first
phase we can call resentment. What was this pair of things
doing there? So big, so banal. Then came a second phase,
which we can call acceptance. We can get used to anything."
In the case of architecture, we better get used to it. Then
came the final phase: I he phase of martyrdom.The World
Trade Center is now inexplicably bound up in a whole set
of values that martyrdom embraces. And martyrs, after all.
are beyond criticism."
Goldberger also discussed the towers as a symbol of
modernity.
"To most of the world, these towers represented the
modernist idea in its most perfect, realized form," he said.
"The ultimate symbols of modernity were the ultimate
target. The World Trade Center looms larger in death than
it ever did in life. It's now more than ever before Ameri
can. Modern architecture has never before been intimate
ly tied to the identity of this country. The terrorists man
aged to do what an architect has never been able to do —
make this country cherish a national design."
The lecture also focused on the rebuilding process.
Goldberger highlighted the dispute regarding Ground
Zero between the Port Authority, different architects, the
governor, families of the victims and numerous other par
ties. He criticized the lack of public control over the
process and the idea that the towers should be rebuilt.
"Rebuilding denies history," he argued. "To put things
back the way they were as if nothing happened signifies
that you think of the city as a kind of theme park, not a real
place. Real places show their history, they don't deny it. We
have to do two contradictory things — to commemorate
and rebuild. We have to blend the awesome and the every
day."
Goldberger focused the rest of his lecture on the com
bination between the commonplace and the sacred, dis
cussing the alternate plans for Ground Zero's rebuilding.
He criticized the political factors at work, noting how the
Drawing Center and the Freedom Center were forced out
of the site due to objections over the content of the muse
ums.
"I come back in the end to a paradox," he said. "We
need to combine the awesome and the everyday and that's
not easy. We need to make a new place anil we need to con
nect and enhance the old. But as difficult and as seeming
ly contradictory as all of these things are, they are part of
the art of city building and they always have been. I am dis
couraged about the state of things right now at Ground
Zero, as you can plainly see."
However, Goldberger did not fail to wrap up his talk
with a hint of optimism.
"But I still believe that this is a place where our dreams
and realities meet with greater intensity than ever before,"

he said. "And I hope with greater intensity that it is where
they will ultimately come together."
The Christensen Fund enabled the Department of Art
and Art History to bring Goldberger to Stanford.The or
ganization began in 1990 and provides free lectures not
only for the Stanford community, but the general public as
well.
" ITie fund allows us to invite a distinguished, interna
tionally recognized art or architectural historian to the
Department to present a major public address," said Lisa
Vestal, Art and Art I fistory Department publicist. "The
Christianson family has been very generous to us. It af
fords us to bring a world-renowned speaker to come and
give a public lecture. This enables us to bring the best and

the brightest out there."
Vestal noted the honor of bringing such a renowned ar
chitecture critic to campus.
"He's a huge name in the art world and particularly in
architecture and architecture criticism. He's talking about
these timely disasters and thinking about these catastro
phes in a new worldview and what our city is or needs to
be in terms of a sociological standpoint."
Junior Megan Green agreed on Goldberger's impor
tance in the art world.
"It was the big art history lecture of the quarter and
he's kind of a forced to be reckoned with in architectural
criticism," said Green. "Reconstruction is a very pertinent
topic right now with New Orleans and New York."

case in New York in the awful weeks after Sept. 11, hut it
turned out not to he. What happened in New Orleans is
a different kind of killing — the potential death of the
city itself."
He then tracked the history of the World Trade Center
as a part of the New York skyline.
"Looking back at the short life of the World Trade Cen
ter, there were three distinct phases," he said. "The first
phase we can call resentment. What was this pair of things
doing there? So big, so banal. Then came a second phase,
which we can call acceptance. We can get used to anything."
In the case of architecture, we better get used to it. Then
came the final phase: I he phase of martyrdom.The World
Trade Center is now inexplicably bound up in a whole set
of values that martyrdom embraces. And martyrs, after all.
are beyond criticism."
Goldberger also discussed the towers as a symbol of
modernity.
"To most of the world, these towers represented the
modernist idea in its most perfect, realized form," he said.
"The ultimate symbols of modernity were the ultimate
target. The World Trade Center looms larger in death than
it ever did in life. It's now more than ever before Ameri
can. Modern architecture has never before been intimate
ly tied to the identity of this country. The terrorists man
aged to do what an architect has never been able to do —
make this country cherish a national design."
The lecture also focused on the rebuilding process.
Goldberger highlighted the dispute regarding Ground
Zero between the Port Authority, different architects, the
governor, families of the victims and numerous other par
ties. He criticized the lack of public control over the
process and the idea that the towers should be rebuilt.
"Rebuilding denies history," he argued. "To put things
back the way they were as if nothing happened signifies
that you think of the city as a kind of theme park, not a real
place. Real places show their history, they don't deny it. We
have to do two contradictory things — to commemorate
and rebuild. We have to blend the awesome and the every
day."
Goldberger focused the rest of his lecture on the com
bination between the commonplace and the sacred, dis
cussing the alternate plans for Ground Zero's rebuilding.
He criticized the political factors at work, noting how the
Drawing Center and the Freedom Center were forced out
of the site due to objections over the content of the muse
ums.
"I come back in the end to a paradox," he said. "We
need to combine the awesome and the everyday and that's
not easy. We need to make a new place anil we need to con
nect and enhance the old. But as difficult and as seeming
ly contradictory as all of these things are, they are part of
the art of city building and they always have been. I am dis
couraged about the state of things right now at Ground
Zero, as you can plainly see."
However, Goldberger did not fail to wrap up his talk
with a hint of optimism.
"But I still believe that this is a place where our dreams
and realities meet with greater intensity than ever before,"

he said. "And I hope with greater intensity that it is where
they will ultimately come together."
The Christensen Fund enabled the Department of Art
and Art History to bring Goldberger to Stanford.The or
ganization began in 1990 and provides free lectures not
only for the Stanford community, but the general public as
well.
" ITie fund allows us to invite a distinguished, interna
tionally recognized art or architectural historian to the
Department to present a major public address," said Lisa
Vestal, Art and Art I fistory Department publicist. "The
Christianson family has been very generous to us. It af
fords us to bring a world-renowned speaker to come and
give a public lecture. This enables us to bring the best and

the brightest out there."
Vestal noted the honor of bringing such a renowned ar
chitecture critic to campus.
"He's a huge name in the art world and particularly in
architecture and architecture criticism. He's talking about
these timely disasters and thinking about these catastro
phes in a new worldview and what our city is or needs to
be in terms of a sociological standpoint."
Junior Megan Green agreed on Goldberger's impor
tance in the art world.
"It was the big art history lecture of the quarter and
he's kind of a forced to be reckoned with in architectural
criticism," said Green. "Reconstruction is a very pertinent
topic right now with New Orleans and New York."

Stanford University Christensen Fund Distinguished Visiting Lecturer Paul Goldberger presented "After the World Trade
Center and Katrina:Rethinking the City of our Time" last night.
Pulitzer Prize winner Paul Goldberger took the
podium at Annenberg Auditorium last night to speak
about architecture's relationship to two of the greatest
crises of recent times — the World IVade Center disas
ter and I lurricane Katrina. As a Christensen Fund Dis
tinguished Visiting Lecturer, Goldberger gave a pres

entation entitled "After the World Trade Center and
Katrina: Rethinking the City for Our Time."
Goldberger is the dean of Parsons School for Design
and an architecture critic for The New Yorker. A recip
ient of the Pulitzer Prize for his architecture criticism
and a writer at The New York limes for 25 years, he fo
cuses on social and political implications of design.
Goldberger has also authored several books, most re
cently "Up from Zero: Politics, Architecture, and the
Rebuilding of New York."
Goldberger began the lecture by speaking about
New York and his book titled "Up from Zero." I le fo
cused his lecture on the rebuilding of Ground Zero and

expressed his pessimism regarding its progress.
"Lately.it has not been encouraging," he said.'Mt has
taken something of a nosedive in the last few months
and has turned into a complicated, dreary mess. This
story is indeed more about politics than architecture. It
is no exaggeration to say that Ground Zero is the great
est urban design challenge of the 21st Century."
Goldberger compared the problem to that of re
building New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.
"The problem in New Orleans is vastly more se
vere since the existence of the city as we've known it is
at stake," Goldberg said. "We feared that would he the
case in New York in the awful weeks after Sept. 11, hut it
turned out not to he. What happened in New Orleans is
a different kind of killing — the potential death of the
city itself."

ter, there were three distinct phases," he said. "The first
