## Roth party theme runs the redlight Former theme of the house's annual party deemed derogatory 
### ANNE RITCHIE STAFF WHITER 
Tonight's party at Roth House, "Moulin Roth." was not
always going to be named as such. In the past, the all female
house's annual party was known as "The Brothel."This year,
however, the Office of Student Activities denied the house's
request to use the name, "because it is derogatory towards
women," said senior Morgan Craven, the Roth social chair.
"We arc an entire house of women and it was decided that
'The Brothel' sends the wrong message about the residents,"
Craven said. "At first we were upset that the name was de
nied because it was such a popular party in the past and we
were hoping to continue the legacy. But. once the name was
forbidden, we saw the opportunity to be pretty creative in
coming up with a new, but related theme."
Among some of the considered themes were "Pajama
Party" and "Hugh Hef√üoth's Playboy Mansion." but
"Moulin Roth" emerged as the most popular choice in the
house. According to sophomore resident Lauren I aleao,"of
ficially, the theme is 'Moulin Roth,' but unofficially, it's
'Moulin Roth: not a brothel, still a whorehouse.'"
However, some residents said they were baffled by the
denial of the party's original name.
"I think it's kind of ridiculous that 'The Brothel' was de
nied as a name," Falcao said. "680 has 'Exotic Erotic,' and
FloMo had 'G1 Joes and Barbie Hoes. Why is The Brothel'
any different?"
Indeed, the distinction between being merely suggest iw
and derogatory is a fine line.
"While I understand why the name 'The Brothel' has
been forbidden. I personally didn't have a problem with it."
