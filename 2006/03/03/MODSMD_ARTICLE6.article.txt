## Roth party theme runs the redlight Former theme of the house's annual party deemed derogatory 
### ANNE RITCHIE STAFF WHITER 
Tonight's party at Roth House, "Moulin Roth." was not
always going to be named as such. In the past, the all female
house's annual party was known as "The Brothel."This year,
however, the Office of Student Activities denied the house's
request to use the name, "because it is derogatory towards
women," said senior Morgan Craven, the Roth social chair.
"We arc an entire house of women and it was decided that
'The Brothel' sends the wrong message about the residents,"
Craven said. "At first we were upset that the name was de
nied because it was such a popular party in the past and we
were hoping to continue the legacy. But. once the name was
forbidden, we saw the opportunity to be pretty creative in
coming up with a new, but related theme."
Among some of the considered themes were "Pajama
Party" and "Hugh Hefßoth's Playboy Mansion." but
"Moulin Roth" emerged as the most popular choice in the
house. According to sophomore resident Lauren I aleao,"of
ficially, the theme is 'Moulin Roth,' but unofficially, it's
'Moulin Roth: not a brothel, still a whorehouse.'"
However, some residents said they were baffled by the
denial of the party's original name.
"I think it's kind of ridiculous that 'The Brothel' was de
nied as a name," Falcao said. "680 has 'Exotic Erotic,' and
FloMo had 'G1 Joes and Barbie Hoes. Why is The Brothel'
any different?"
Indeed, the distinction between being merely suggest iw
and derogatory is a fine line.
"While I understand why the name 'The Brothel' has
been forbidden. I personally didn't have a problem with it."
Craven said. "I see a difference between a
suggestive name and one that is just straight
up derogatory. I always thought that 'The
Brothel' was suggestive —it was a place
where ladies of the evening sold their goods
— while something that included 'sluts' or
'hoes' was blatantly derogatory."
While the Office of Student Activities
found the name beyond suggestive, its Web
site fails to show any explicit guidelines of
what makes a party theme inappropriate.
The only guidance was for parties with
cultural themes, which read:"lf you are plan
ning a party with a cultural theme, it is impor
tant that it be respectful of that culture. The
focus of the event must not be alcohol."
Jane Camarillo, director of Residential
Education, explained why the original name
may have been rejected.
"(In creating themes for parties], it has
been a practice to encourage fun activities

without endorsing illicit activity," Camarillo
said. "Perhaps this is where the Roth party
ran into some problems. In addition, at an in
stitution like Stanford, we would rather not
encourage themes that degrade men or
women, particular cultures or groups."
Regardless of the theme, Craven said she
just hopes that people enjoy the party.
"Whether suggestive or derogatory, 'The
Brothel' apparently had the potential to of
fend someone and we would never want to do
that," said Craven. "We especially wouldn't
want to put any of the lovely ladies in our all
girls house in an uncomfortable position."
Falcao, on the other hand, said that she
still didn't understand what the uproar was
about.
"It's not like guys don't visit," she joked.
"Moulin Roth" will begin at 10 p.m.
tonight. Guests are asked to bring their
SUIDs to enter.
