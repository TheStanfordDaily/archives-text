### CAITLIN BERKA 
Calling all sultans of swing, revelers in ragtime, bebop babes and fusion fanciers: if
you haven't checked out these local jazz clubs, you're not living the high life. So
grab a martini, put on your best spats, and Charleston, shimmy, Lindy Hop or
cakewalk on down. All the cool cats are doing it.

Yoshi's

Situated on Oakland's Jack London Square, Yoshi's is the premier jazz club in the Bay
Area and among the finest in the nation. Boasting a laundry list of classic perform
ances, Yoshi's has long been home to the jazz greats of the era; since its opening in
the late 70s. it has seen such legends as Stan Getz, Ray Brown. Shirley Horn, Diana Krall
and the Charles Mingus Big Band. If mingling with the patrons is more your style, pre
pare to be dazzled: recent audience members have included Danny Glover and cele
brated civil-rights activist Yuri Kochivama.

A triumph of acoustical engineering, Yoshi's is more concert hall than club in many
respects; while it does feature Japanese cuisine, no one really goes for the food. The
chic, curved design of the walls contributes to the remarkable sound quality and cre
ates a plush, yet tastefully understated, atmosphere. For those who can't stand the Bay
Bridge at night, a new location is due to open in San Francisco in a few months. A must
for all music lovers.

Cafe Fino

Like Yoshi's, Cafd Fino is a combination cabaret and old-fashioned supper club, serv
ing up a healthy dose of sophisticated jazz alongside its pinot grigio and pesto penne.
Located at 540 Emerson Street in Palo Alto.Caf6 Fino gets points for proximity as well
as artistic merit. Patrons are greeted by authentic art deco surroundings and old movie
posters originally from the Stanford Ilieater that mesh beautifully with the 20s-style jazz
emanating from the bar room.

I*he music is Cafe Fino's main selling point; Margie Baker, a regular singer at Fino, was
trained by Dizzy Gillespie himself and has often sung with the Stanford Jazz Orchestra in con-

cert. And if you need another reason to check it out, regular attendance may fuel your innovative
and entrepreneurial genius: rumor has it that this is the very cafe where Steve Jobs and Steve Woz
niak first met. Opulent and beautiful. Cafe Fino will take you back to an age of decadence, romance
and sumptuous nonchalance, whether you want it to or not.

Pearl's
As you descend into its dark, candlelit, cavernous dining room
with a chandelier vaguely reminiscent ofThe Phantom of the
Opera. Pearl's will inevitably make you feel like a bootlegger
— in the best way possible.This 19305-style supper club at Colum
bus and Broadway in the North Beach district of San Francisco —

universally recognized for its authenticity and ambiance —

boasts an array of high-profile jazz acts and has been
named one of the top 30 hottest clubs worldwide by

Conde Nast magazine, the media company responsible
for Vogue, GQ and The New Yorker.

Pearl's closed its doors in April 2003 but, in the
wake of vociferous public outcry, reopened just

months later under new ownership. Now. it is staffed
and run entirely by jazz musicians, actors, screenwriters

and other artists of the San Francisco ilk. Pearl's is rather

pricey for the college crowd, with $10 tickets and a two-drink
minimum, but a night in the city at this world-famous club is well
worth the price of admission.
