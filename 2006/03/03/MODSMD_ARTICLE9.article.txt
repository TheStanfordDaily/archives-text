# Olivia Puerta's Best Bites
## Joanie's a mouthful 
### 
As I walked into Joanie's Cafe
last Saturday morning, I was delight
ed to see several signs suggesting
that a great breakfast lay ahead.
One of these signs was quite literal
â€” a placard hangs on the wall tout
ing Joanie's ' Best Breakfast" rating
by The Palo Alto Weekly. The clean,
bright and cheerful restaurant was
filled with customers and the tones
of pleasant jazz music. I was seated
in a corner table,my favorite place to
sit in a restaurant. However, despite
these auspicious initial indications,
my meal at Joanie's was under
whelming. In short, it offers decent
food and service, but nothing worthy
of a standing ovation.
The popular breakfast and lunch
joint serves standard brunch fare
(eggs, pancakes, waffles, sandwiches,
soups) at middle-ground prices.
Prices are definitely skewed to en
courage larger orders; one egg costs
$2.45, but you get two eggs scram
bled with veggies and choice of toast

or a muffin and fruit or potatoes for
$8.00.
This dismayed my not very hun
gry companion but, ready to eat a
full meal. I didn't feel unjustly served
paying $S.(K) for my toast, fruit, and
eggs scrambled with spinach, mush
rooms and onion. Another friend
ordered two eggs any style with
choice of potatoes or fruit, choice of
meat and choice of toast of muffin
for $7.95.
Ibe taste of butter dominated
every part of my meal save my fruit
cup (thank goodness). The toast

came pre-buttered with u lot of but
ter. If you like a little more control
over your lard intake, I highly rec
ommend asking Joanie's to leave the
butter on the side. My friend's hash
browns were greasier than she
would have liked. Similarly, I would
have enjoyed my scrambled eggs
much more had I not been inundat
ed with a buttery taste in every bite.
At the beginning of my meal, I felt
that I had selected a fairly healthy
breakfast, but by my first taste I dis
covered that was not the case. Apart
from Joanie's unnecessarily liberal
use of butter, its food inspires no
major complaints or raves. From the
hot chocolate to the bacon, every
thing was middling.
Joanie's isn't a terrible place to
eat, but I won't be rushing back any
time soon. Despite The Palo Alto
Weekly's verdict, I have a feeling
(and a hope) that there's a better
breakfast to be had somewhere else
in Palo Alto.
