## Which love guru is right for you? 
### 
Over the past few months I
have received several
emails addressed to Roxy
Sass, the sex columnist who
also writes for this publication. I can
understand the confusion — in addi
tion to Ms. Sass, a number of other
columnists will occasionally write
about topics like love and dating —
topics I copyrighted, and for which I
receive large royalties whenever they
are mentioned in The Daily.
But as much as I enjoy this steady
stream of income, I'm sure many of
you out there are asking yourselves,
"With so many columnists who claim
to be experts on romance, how do 1
know which one is right for me?"
Well, Curious McCuriocabinet,
you're in luck. I spent countless hours
creating a quiz that will assess your
dating personality and then tell you
which love guru is right for you. Now
you will know exactly whom to send
all those suggestive/threatening
emails from an untraceable Hotmail
account. Have fun!
1) You think that squirrels are:
A. Deserving of death by fire and/or
strangling, but only in the context of a
humorous Valentine's Day column.
B. F***ing hot.
C. Conspiring against you.
2) Thursday is your favorite day of
the week because at night you get to:
A. Go to Pub Night, where you meet
new people and dance the night away!
B. Go to Pub Night, where you f***
new people and f*** the night away!
C. Rifle through the drawers of your
roommate, who is at Pub Night.
3) Let's say you get really drunk at
a party and wake up next to someone
you barely know and have no interest
in speaking to again. What is the prop
er post-hookup etiquette?
A. Tip them 10 percent and quietly
leave before they wake up.
B. Tip them syphilis and quietly leave
before they wake up.
C. Tell them that if they ever call you
again, you will cut them.
4) In general,you think that dating is:
A. The only thing that will deliver
Stanford students from a life of social
awkwardness.
B. An annoying and unnecessary pre
cursor to sex, kind of like consent.
C. An asthma attack waiting to happen.
5) Your idea of the perfect date is:
A. Dinner at a nice restaurant fol
lowed by a romantic walk around
Lake Lag.
B. One involving whips, hot wax and a
donkey named "Sal."
C. Dinner at Lag, followed by a ro
mantic walk around a nice restaurant.
6) When it comes to the possibility
of an exclusive relationship, you are:
A. Open to whatever might come your
way, but not really looking for any
thing too serious right now.
B. Open to whatever might come your
way, as long as it involves Sal.
C. Seriously concerned that your right
hand might get jealous.
Mostly A's: You're a Stanford Sin
gle! You are confident, witty and have
a good sense of appropriate conduct in
even the most complex social situa
tions. You like your love advice enter
taining and written in proper English
by a moderately attractive member of
the Greek system. TUne in to this sec
tion on Mondays to get your fix of an
occasionally insightful and consistent
ly irreverent take on the single scene at
Stanford.
Mostly B's: You're a Roxy Sass
hole! You are impulsive, erratic and
have more crabs than a New England
seafood shack. You like your love ad
vice pornographic, fantastical and
written in dialect by an anonymous
member of the Hoover Institution.
Check out the Intermission section,
whatever that is, for more information
on how to f*** people.
Mostly C's: You're Going to Die
Alone! Follow the love advice from
any of the other columnists for ways to
do this faster.
