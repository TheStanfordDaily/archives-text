rriving early to observe a

J ■ Shakespeare Society's
112 production of "Richard *
112 112 M III" — which opens
%AVednesday — I was star
tled by a burst of violence from the hardwood
Elliot Programming Center stage.The exquisite
ly choreographed brawl — which I was comfort
ed to learn was a stage fight — immediately re
minded me of a scene out of an engaging action
movie. Such unlocking of the entertainment
value and accessibility of Shakespeare's works
— while preserving the text — is one of the stu
dent group's trademarks.
"Shakespeare was popular entertainment —
he was the popular TV show of his time," says
senior Jonathan Palley, StanShakes' executive
producer. "Bringing out that sense of entertain
ment is one of the main goals of Shakes."
To do so, Richard lII' Director Maggie
Mason, a senior, has set the play — the tale of a
diabolical duke who butchers ail who hinder his
ascent to the throne — in a chaotic mob-era en
vironment, complete with epic strobe-lit skir
mishes.
"I embraced the idea of a gangster setting i
because loyalty, families and the transfer of I
power are central to the play — though *
Richard violates them all," Mason says. "Addi
tionally, there's no outer law. There's a feeling
that all the action is above the law. The mobster
context is merely a modern context, a sugges
tion."
Via the mobster motif. Mason says she hopes
to resurrect the genre of tragedy — one she feels
has been increasingly disregarded. Despite the
ultimate destruction of evil. Mason argues that
the play's ending is by no means happy.
"We always want a hero, but ['Richard lll']
has no hero," she says. "We always look for a
catharsis, a resolution...but does that really hap
pen in life? Tragedy used to be a greatly revered
genre. It doesn't pretend like everything is all
right when it's not. It's great to have an art that
ends like that, with no apologies."
To bridge the gap between accessibility and
the resurrection of the long lost dramatic form.
Mason has made some cuts to the infamously
long text — this version of the play runs just
under two hours with intermission — to flesh
out the humor embedded in the bard's work and
keep the pace racing at a machine gun-like
tempo.
"Shakespeare deems man's quest of power
tragic, but it's also funny," Mason says. "This play
has all of Shakespeare's biggest hallmarks with
humor masking morbidity."
The set itself oozes irony. The throne —
whose price is the blood of Richard's victims and
the desire of so many — is a threatening, elec
tric-chair-like piece that is constantly at center
stage.The gauze-draped mirror behind the play
ing area is cleverly used to mockingly answer the
actors in soliloquy.
The throne also points to a cycle of power
that Palley finds relevant today.
"The play questions how people get into
power," Palley explains."lt presents a dangerous
cycle, where personality charges power. We

played off the idea that power
is a force that sucks anyone with
in its proximity."
Though family eventually spells
destruction and tragedy for Richard
and his acquaintances,one can't help feel
ing that StanShakes has a strong, almost fa
milial bond.
The student group operates in a company
format, which means they hold auditions in the
beginning of the year. Only those who are cho
sen at the beginning can participate in the plays
throughout the year, and the team trains togeth
er quite intensely
"[The StanShakes' organization] allows us to
get to know each other on a longer-term basis,
making as an entire season together, not just one
show," Palley says. "1 think the acting is better
because of it."
The company also participates in workshops
and classes involving Shakespeare skills, such as
stage combat, iambic pentameter and voice
technique.The fact that they work exclusively on
Shakespeare allows them to convey the texts'
complexities and contributes to the audience's
comprehension of their performance.
"We're really having fun up there — the
room's full of energy," cast member Leah
Schwartz, a junior, says. "It's not an academic
way to spend an evening. It's entertainment."
