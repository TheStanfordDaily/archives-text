## Worried about the flu epidemic? Bless you! 
### 
Recent news articles about the possible
avian flu pandemic may have left you
very afraid. Many pundits have iden
tified the flu epidemic as a serious threat to
the global community. Experts are wary of
the possibility that avian flu, a subtype of in
fluenza viruses transmitted by birds, might
mutate into a highly contagious and virulent
strain that could kill thousands. So just how
afraid should you be?
Perhaps you do have a cause for concern.
The Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 emerged
almost out of nowhere, claiming tens of mil
lions of lives before disappearing just as
mysteriously. Likewise, the Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic
that appeared in late 2(X)2 resulted in hun
dreds of deaths in mainland China, Hong
Kong. Taiwan, Canada, Singapore and the
rest of the world.
1 lowever.it is instructive to note that there
is a fine line between awareness and panic.
While there is a need to remain vigilant, there
is no need to be paranoid. Although avian in
fluenza is highly contagious among birds,
even then, the virus does not kill all birds.
While avian flu spreads easily among birds, it
appears not to spread as easily between birds
and humans or among humans. Moreover,
the exact mortality rate of an undiscovered
strain of the avian flu virus remains uncertain.
Some humans infected with the avian flu
virus may very well develop harmless symp
toms associated with the common eold.
Being aware of the risks of contracting
avian flu should help us modulate our re
sponse to the virus. For instance, it might be
a good idea to wash your hands after coming
into close contact with wild birds at a nation
al park. It might not be as necessary for
chicken lovers to overhaul their dietary

habits, as the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention's Web site reports "no evi
dence that properly cooked poultry or eggs
can be a source of infection."
It is not our intention to downplay the
possible risks of the epidemic. On the con
trary, the U.S. government needs to take into
account the full extent of the possible epi
demic and prepare a swift medical response
to such an epidemic.
To some extent, the relevant authorities
have already taken steps to curb the fallout
from a future epidemic. In fact, Stanford's
School of Medicine is slated to begin testing
a promising vaccine to block the HSNI sub
type of the influenza virus.
Granted, more can certainly be done.
However, a lot of the barriers to developing
a safe and effective vaccine lie in the domain
of scientific research. Even as researchers
continue to race against the clock, not
enough is known about the HSNI virus or its
possible mutants. In this respect, medical ex
perts and government officials are battling
an unknown enemy.
Yet, in spite of our imperfect knowledge,
more should be done to inform the public of
the general risks of avian flu. As engaged
members of society, it should also be our
duty to remain informed about the situation
by keeping up with developments or visiting
the CDC's website.
At the same time, there is a lot to be said
for holding on to traditional wisdom in the
face of uncertain threats. Wash your hands
before touching any part of your face and
stay at home if you develop any symptoms of
a cold. There are plenty of sensible and level
headed precautions we should take against
any kind of contagious disease before de
scending into utter panic.
