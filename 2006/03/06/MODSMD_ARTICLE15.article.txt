— I salute you! Mem-
Chu is yours for the
taking; get all of the
family in that shot
with Hoover Tower;

take your time as you center that picture of Meyer Library. If it
were not for you and your photo-happy brethren, I might forget
the true majesty of the institution 1 attend. People come here
from other countries just to see our school — I mean, come on,
how cool is that?
I'll admit that, at first, I didn't recognize the value of the
swarms of enthusiastic tourists I saw flocking about every week.
Ihere was even a time when I would try to bike into as many pic
tures being taken as possible (I called it the cameo game). But at
some point — I think it was when I hit a tourist child with my
bike — I realized that these people are like us, with hopes and
dreams and feelings. Listening to the cries of anguish from that
young boy, 1 realized that their kind feel pain too.
From then on, I became nothing but a friend to our frequent
visitors. Well, the kind of friend who occasionally feeds young
sightseers wildly inaccurate historical information about our
campus (I've got a whole middle school believing the Civil War
was fought at the Oval). Or, better yet, the kind of friend who of
fers to take a picture, tells the family to back up so they all fit in
the frame and then runs away with their camera. Good times.
It's also fun to hijack tour groups of eager, young Stanford
hopefuls. It's even more fun to tell these groups that you are not
only a tour guide, but also an official in the admissions office (try
a foot massage from a high-schooler, it's breathtaking). But no
tour group would be complete without the parents who think
they can impress you by asking obscure questions like what Jane
Stanford majored in or the name of the sculptor who made the
Claw. I always tell them that families who ask questions like that
just aren't Stanford material.Then I mention that my feet are
killing me from all the walking I've been doing.
I've also taken it upon myself to give willing tourists the
chance to get some firsthand experience of Stanford life by liv
ing with me in my dorm room (for a small fee and laundry duty,
of course). My current resident is Randy, a 32 year old invest
ment banker who's trying to hearken back to his college days
and forget that his wife cheated on him with some young official
in the admissions office who said she could be Stanford materi
al. Randy's not bad company. He does keep rather odd hours
and cries a lot. but he does a great job on my math and econom
ics problem sets, and a couple of times when I've let him out of
his cage we've even had some really meaningful conversations.
Without tourists. Stanford would not be the same. Yes, for the
most part I have come to embrace our visitors as an integral part
of the Stanford way of life.
Oh, and by integral, I mean integral in that fuzzy, nostalgic,
not really real sort of way that just sounds nice but doesn't actu
ally mean anything. Kind of like something that would be the
subject of an IHUM or PWR course. "The Rhetoric ofTourism"
- I can see it now (that's not already a course, is it?). Honestly,
I think I just wanted to use the word integral in a context outside
of Math 42.
But in all seriousness, it's easy to get caught up in reading,
doing problem sets and all the hectic activities involved in living
the college life. Its a shame that we students get so busy we often
forget that we're at a place as great as Stanford — a place so
many people go out of their way to visit. So the next time you
hear, "cheese," and are temporarily blinded by a flash, remem
ber how lucky you are (and see if you can steal that camera).
