ASSU Speakers Bureau has
exciting spring line-up
I would like to thank the Daily for covering llies
<Jay night's Chuck D event and announcing the Speak
ers Bureau's spring lineup ("Public Enemy's Chuck D.
comes to Cubberley", Mar. 1). However, in publishing
the lineup, the Daily excluded some important infor
mation that we had asked them to include.
With the exception of Ray Kurzweil (May 15), all of
our events next quarter are being co-presented with
other student groups on campus, and they deserve
recognition because they are also working hard to
make these events possible: Seth MacFarlane (Apr. 16)
is being presented with FLiCKS, Mustafa Barghouthi
(Apr. 24) is being presented with the Muslim Student
Awareness Network, John Edwards (Apr. 26) is being
presented with Stanford in Government, Sandra Cis
neros (May 4) is being presented with El Centro Chi
cano. and Elie Wiesel (May 21) is being presented with
Hillel and Students Taking Action Now: Darfur. The
last of these aforementioned events will be raising
money for Darfur related charities.
The Speakers Bureau is excited about its spring
lineup not just because of the speakers, but also be
cause we are fortunate enough to work with such fine
organizations.
As a final note, for those curious as to how to get
tickets to our spring speakers, please keep checking
our Web site http://speakers.stanford.edu, as we have
not yet decided our ticketing policies for these events.
