# Why I don't live in a co-op
## 
### 
I should have drawn into a co-op. I
love the outdoors, all my friends
live in one and I'm an English
major. All of these factors make me a
prime candidate for co-op life. And yet,
the co-op life has not been for me. 1
guess I'm a co-op groupie. Of course,
the last time I was a groupie it was for
this dark heavy metal band back in
high school. We were so into it, we had
this suicide pact...and well, I sure miss
those guys.
But the fact remains: I don't live in a
co-op. I think it comes from a deep
seeded fear of using jars, bowls or
gourds as drinking receptacles. It began
as a child, when my mother caught me
drinking from my cereal bowl and said
"Don't be a dirty hippie." And then she
beat me with a Phish record, which also
probably explains a lot.
Co-op people are usually friendlier
and nicer than I am.That bugs me. For
example, if you had a really bad day in
a dorm, you would shut your door and
listen to your music. Not so in a co-op,
because it's all shared space. Your door
cannot be shut because your door has
been removed by magical community
gnomes. By midnight, these same
gnomes will have baked you bread and

knit you a scarf.
When I visit co-ops, I can never
leave. Most of this draws from not
knowing where I am. Many co-ops re
ject the conventional idea of number
ing rooms in the same way that Flicks
rejects conventional ways of making
money. Co-ops prefer room names like
"Enchanted Cupboard." or "Happy
Place" or "Sex Palace." None of these
rooms live up to their name. The cup
board has no magical Indian, the
Happy Place was full of guys working
on problem sets, and the Sex Palace
had two members of the Stanford Solar
Car Project. ITie names are a bit mis
leading, in my opinion. 1 think my room
would be called "Bastion of Bitter
ness." Or possibly "Squid Factory," but
that's because this is a humor column
and I think that just sounds funny.

I can't do the vegetarian thing. And
the whole "consensus" thing? Yeah,
that isn't happening. For those who
don't know, some cooperative commu
nities make all major decisions by con
sensus — everyone must agree on the
course of action. Personally, I think any
group over two creates a mathematical
impossibility of agreeing on something
as simple as pizza toppings, but I guess
bigger issues like living arrangements
are much easier to get everyone to
agree on. And if everyone agrees hairy
naked guy should put on some fucking
pants when he cooks, can he still vote
no and the motion not carry?
Some co-ops bake bread, which is
awesome. Unfortunately, it is always
healthy or natural, which to me equals
"non-tasty." It never is the coco-puff
banana bread I enjoyed as a child,
which my mother carefully made from
the finest in Wonder Bread, non-organ
ic bananas and frosted chemical com
pounds in nugget form.
Also, co-ops are naturally social
places.They are always well stocked in
tea, have open kitchens and sometimes
make other things. They are exciting
places — with dancing people and face
paint and fire dancers and fire couches

and (later on) fire men. I don't know if
I'm ready for that kind of life. I don't
mind living in Lantana, where I don't
know my neighbors, their names or
their "World of Warcraft" alter-egos.
Alright, maybe I missed out on
something big and grand at Stanford.
Maybe I should have drawn into a co
op, sucked up the weekly jobs, turned
in my plaid jackets and chain belts for
tie-dye shirts and creative facial hair.
Maybe I should turn down the RX
Bandits and give hugs while listening
to some kind of hippie crap — I dunno,
something about a disaster involving
string cheese?
I'd make a terrible hippie, but I do
feel like co-op life would have been
pretty awesome. As an ally of the co-op
scene. I'll still go to your houses, drink
your tea (from a cup, dammit) and be
friends with all of you. I invite everyone
to visit a co-op and meet the interesting
people, enjoy the unique viewpoints
and try to leave the friendly atmosphere
— no really, I'm still trying to find the
fire exit here. Send help, and bread.

paint and fire dancers and fire couches

and (later on) fire men. I don't know if
I'm ready for that kind of life. I don't
mind living in Lantana, where I don't
know my neighbors, their names or
their "World of Warcraft" alter-egos.
Alright, maybe I missed out on
something big and grand at Stanford.
Maybe I should have drawn into a co
op, sucked up the weekly jobs, turned
in my plaid jackets and chain belts for
tie-dye shirts and creative facial hair.
Maybe I should turn down the RX
Bandits and give hugs while listening
to some kind of hippie crap — I dunno,
something about a disaster involving
string cheese?
I'd make a terrible hippie, but I do
feel like co-op life would have been
pretty awesome. As an ally of the co-op
scene. I'll still go to your houses, drink
your tea (from a cup, dammit) and be
friends with all of you. I invite everyone
to visit a co-op and meet the interesting
people, enjoy the unique viewpoints
and try to leave the friendly atmosphere
— no really, I'm still trying to find the
fire exit here. Send help, and bread.

Chris thanks his co-op friends for help
ing him write this column. Send com
plaints to cholt@stanford.edu.
