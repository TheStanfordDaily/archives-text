## Card women 'play out of their mind' USC coach praises Card after rout Women trounce Arizona in first round In a surprise, finals bring UCLA 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CHRISTIAN TORRES STAFF WRITERS 
No. 13 Stanford women's basketball has just one
step left to clinch its fourth straight conference title.
One day after handily defeating Arizona 77-50 in the
quarterfinals, Stanford dismantled USC 73-44 in Sun
day s semis.The Cardinal (22-6,15-3 Pac-10) emptied
their bench in both games and should be well rested
for their third game in three days.
Surprisingly, Stanford will take on third-seed
UCLA (20-10,12-6) tonight.The Bruins, who beat the
Cardinal 90-80 earlier this season, rebounded from an
abysmal first half and defeated the Arizona State 60-
59 on last second free throws from Noelle Quinn/Ilie
finals are tonight at 7:30 p.m. at HP Pavilion in San
Jose.
"We did not play them well last time and I think
that will help us," head coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"Hopefully, we come out a little hungrier."
No. 13 Stanford 73, USC 44
After eking out a narrow 73-69 win over USC in
last year's semifinals, Sunday night's semifinal game
against the Women of Troy was a completely different
story.The 29-point blowout was one of the Cardinal's
most complete games of the year â€” Stanford led in
every statistical category but free throw percentage.
"I think we could all tell that we were very excited
about the game tonight," junior center Brooke Smith
said."l can tell the difference in energy level now that

we're in the tournament. [It helped us] really buckle
down on defense and hit the offensive boards hard."
Junior centers Brooke Smith and Kristin Newlin
set the tone down low pacing Stanford to a 22-5 ad
vantage in points in the paint in the first half. Smith led
all scorers with 15 points in only 24 minutes. The Car
dinal outrebounded the Trojans 59-43.
"1 think we're playing our best basketball," Van-
Derveeer said. "People were very unselfish and we
were running the floor. It's fun to see."
Stanford then moved to the perimeter, shooting 50
percent from behind the arc in the second half. USC
doubled down on Smith, freeing up two-time Pac-10
Player of the Year sophomore guard Candice Wiggins
and senior guard Krista Rappahahn. the first- and
third-most accurate three point shooters in the Pac
-10, respectively.
Rappahahn hit her 80th three pointer of the season
with 17:27 left in the game, moving her to within one
of the Stanford single-season record. Her attempt at
No. 81 hit back iron, so she will have to wait one more
game in her bid to tie and pass Jamie Carey.
She also made a two-point jumper in the first half,
and the Cardinal moved to 7-0 all-time when the out
side specialist scores on a field goal inside the arc.
"I just shoot where I'm supposed to shoot when
I'm open," Rappahahn said sheepishly when asked
about her infrequent shooting inside the arc. "Last
year's team was a completely different team, and it's
just a lot of fun to get in there and contribute."
The Cardinal held USC to a dismal 26.5 percent
from the field, well below their season average of 39.9
percent.
"We just ran into a buzzsaw tonight,"Trojan head
coach Mark Trakh said. "We didn't play well and they
played out of their mind."
