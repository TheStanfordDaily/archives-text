## Med school dean serves another term Future plans include increased diversify in student body 
### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
University President John Hennessy and
Provost John Etchemendy have reappointed
Philip Pizzo to a second five-year term as the
dean of Stanford Medical School.
"Stanford is a remarkable university and I
feel privileged to serve as the dean of its school
of medicine," Pizzo said. "I believe that Stanford
has the ability to serve as beacon and role model
for the future of medicine and biomedical re
search and I am committed to do all that 1 can to
help lead that effort."
Hennessy identified Pizzo's "impressive per
formance in his first term and the strong support
he received from faculty, staff, and students" as
key factors in the decision to reappoint him as
dean.
"Dean Pizzo has a long list of accomplish
ments, which include developing the plan for the
Stanford Comprehensive Cancer Center, secur
ing some impressive additions to the Medical
School faculty, pioneering the creation of a new
curriculum for medical education as well as the
scholarly concentration model, and helping to
reestablish financial stability at our hospitals,"
Hennessy noted.
Pizzo first assumed the deanship on April 2,
2001, at a time when Stanford Medical School
was working through a challenging change of
hands with UC-San Francisco. In an effort to
unite faculty, staff and students — as well as to
renew Stanford Medical School's sense of pur
pose — Pizzo launched a multifaceted plan
called Translating Discoveries in Jan. 2002. As a
result of the program, the Medical School initi
ated a new medical student curriculum, added a
master's in medicine program and developed
techniques that translate more of the knowledge
gained from research into concrete treatments.
"Translating Discoveries aligned the School
of Medicine's missions in education, research
and patient care," Pizzo said. "I am particularly
pleased that our Stanford community has drawn
more closely together with the common goal of
fostering discovery and innovation to improve
human health and that we have forged a closer
relationship with our colleagues across the Uni
versity."
Pizzo said he believes it is important for indi
viduals and institutions such as Stanford to help
define the future of medicine and biomedical re
search, which is experiencing an exciting, yet
challenging time. Exciting, he said, in the sense
that recent discoveries and innovations derived
from basic research have the capability to im
prove the diagnosis, treatment and prevention
of human disease. Challenging, on the other
hand, in the sense that the United States is fac
ing rising healthcare costs accompanied by dete
rioration in healthcare quality.
During the next five years as dean. Pizzo said
he thinks that it is important to sustain a "sense
of harmony and forward looking cooperation
among faculty, students and staff to enhance the
School of Medicine's excellence." Specifically.
