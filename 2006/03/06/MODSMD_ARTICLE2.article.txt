## Med school dean serves another term Future plans include increased diversify in student body 
### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
University President John Hennessy and
Provost John Etchemendy have reappointed
Philip Pizzo to a second five-year term as the
dean of Stanford Medical School.
"Stanford is a remarkable university and I
feel privileged to serve as the dean of its school
of medicine," Pizzo said. "I believe that Stanford
has the ability to serve as beacon and role model
for the future of medicine and biomedical re
search and I am committed to do all that 1 can to
help lead that effort."
Hennessy identified Pizzo's "impressive per
formance in his first term and the strong support
he received from faculty, staff, and students" as
key factors in the decision to reappoint him as
dean.
"Dean Pizzo has a long list of accomplish
ments, which include developing the plan for the
Stanford Comprehensive Cancer Center, secur
ing some impressive additions to the Medical
School faculty, pioneering the creation of a new
curriculum for medical education as well as the
scholarly concentration model, and helping to
reestablish financial stability at our hospitals,"
Hennessy noted.
Pizzo first assumed the deanship on April 2,
2001, at a time when Stanford Medical School
was working through a challenging change of
hands with UC-San Francisco. In an effort to
unite faculty, staff and students — as well as to
renew Stanford Medical School's sense of pur
pose — Pizzo launched a multifaceted plan
called Translating Discoveries in Jan. 2002. As a
result of the program, the Medical School initi
ated a new medical student curriculum, added a
master's in medicine program and developed
techniques that translate more of the knowledge
gained from research into concrete treatments.
"Translating Discoveries aligned the School
of Medicine's missions in education, research
and patient care," Pizzo said. "I am particularly
pleased that our Stanford community has drawn
more closely together with the common goal of
fostering discovery and innovation to improve
human health and that we have forged a closer
relationship with our colleagues across the Uni
versity."
Pizzo said he believes it is important for indi
viduals and institutions such as Stanford to help
define the future of medicine and biomedical re
search, which is experiencing an exciting, yet
challenging time. Exciting, he said, in the sense
that recent discoveries and innovations derived
from basic research have the capability to im
prove the diagnosis, treatment and prevention
of human disease. Challenging, on the other
hand, in the sense that the United States is fac
ing rising healthcare costs accompanied by dete
rioration in healthcare quality.
During the next five years as dean. Pizzo said
he thinks that it is important to sustain a "sense
of harmony and forward looking cooperation
among faculty, students and staff to enhance the
School of Medicine's excellence." Specifically.
The idea for the stipend originated with SPILF, but the
University has since recognized its importance and taken it
under its wing. Nelson noted. Now. SPILF helps the Univer
sity fund these stipends while selecting "innovative, new legal
nonprofits that serve underrepresented groups," with which
to award outside program grants, she said.
The group also nominates a public interest lawyer of the
year. Nelson added.
The event drew a diverse crowd, including students, facul
ty and their families according to Jenny Skinner, who co
chaired the silent auction committee.
"It's a good cause, and a fun event," said second-year law
student and auction attendee Steve Herman, who chaired an
auction committee last spring.
Items on the block this year varied from autographed tel
evision show scripts to weekend getaways at nearby vacation
destinations. Other notable pieces included airline tickets,
wine from local vineyards and dinners at local restaurants.
Items were solicited from local businesses, alumni, vine
yards and students themselves by multiple auction commit
tees staffed by first-year law students. Skinner said.
"They're incredible," Nelson said of the auction organiz
ers.
The first auction was held in 1994, and has since grown to
provide approximately 75 percent of SPILF's funding. Nel
son said. This year's consisted of a silent component with re
freshments followed by a live auction emceed by Law School
Profs. Pam Karlan and Robert Weisburg and conducted by a
professional auctioneer, Martin Willis of Clars Auction
Gallery.
Bidding was intense at the live auction, which began at
8:30 p.m.The crowd was boisterous — at times overwhelm
ing the voices of the emceeing professors. The most hotly
contested items were those involving time with friends and
law school faculty and staff. An evening of beer, bowling
and pizza with former Law School Dean Kathleen Sullivan
went for $1,300, while scotch with current Dean Larry
Kramer was the subject of a fierce bidding war, finally sell
ing for $3,250.
"It's only money," exhorted Willis as he encouraged the
attendees to bid higher.
But nothing could compare with what was perhaps the
auction's marquee item, an opportunity to appear as an extra
in the next season of the television hit "24.'"11 ie package also
included a pilot script signed by the show's creators, includ
ing Stanford alumnus Robert Cochran. The"I Heart Jack
Bauer" package sold for $3,500 which was significant be
cause— unlike the other high-priced items like activities
with faculty — it could only be enjoyed by one person.
Attendees recognized that the auction as a charity event,
at one point bidding quickly some $1,150 dollars to stop
emcee Karlan from singing further verses of her song, a law
school-themed parody of West Side Story's "Maria."
Most said they enjoyed themselves and were more than
happy to support what they found to be a good cause.
Said Law School Prof. Mark Kelman.'it's helpful because
it permits some students interested in representing under
served communities and clients to do things that they other
wise couldn't afford, and it's just a nice community building
event."

"It's a good cause, and a fun event," said second-year law
student and auction attendee Steve Herman, who chaired an
auction committee last spring.
Items on the block this year varied from autographed tel
evision show scripts to weekend getaways at nearby vacation
destinations. Other notable pieces included airline tickets,
wine from local vineyards and dinners at local restaurants.
Items were solicited from local businesses, alumni, vine
yards and students themselves by multiple auction commit
tees staffed by first-year law students. Skinner said.
"They're incredible," Nelson said of the auction organiz
ers.
The first auction was held in 1994, and has since grown to
provide approximately 75 percent of SPILF's funding. Nel
son said. This year's consisted of a silent component with re
freshments followed by a live auction emceed by Law School
Profs. Pam Karlan and Robert Weisburg and conducted by a
professional auctioneer, Martin Willis of Clars Auction
Gallery.
Bidding was intense at the live auction, which began at
8:30 p.m.The crowd was boisterous — at times overwhelm
ing the voices of the emceeing professors. The most hotly
contested items were those involving time with friends and
law school faculty and staff. An evening of beer, bowling
and pizza with former Law School Dean Kathleen Sullivan
went for $1,300, while scotch with current Dean Larry
Kramer was the subject of a fierce bidding war, finally sell
ing for $3,250.
"It's only money," exhorted Willis as he encouraged the
attendees to bid higher.
But nothing could compare with what was perhaps the
auction's marquee item, an opportunity to appear as an extra
in the next season of the television hit "24.'"11 ie package also
included a pilot script signed by the show's creators, includ
ing Stanford alumnus Robert Cochran. The"I Heart Jack
Bauer" package sold for $3,500 which was significant be
cause— unlike the other high-priced items like activities
with faculty — it could only be enjoyed by one person.
Attendees recognized that the auction as a charity event,
at one point bidding quickly some $1,150 dollars to stop
emcee Karlan from singing further verses of her song, a law
school-themed parody of West Side Story's "Maria."
Most said they enjoyed themselves and were more than
happy to support what they found to be a good cause.
Said Law School Prof. Mark Kelman.'it's helpful because
it permits some students interested in representing under
served communities and clients to do things that they other
wise couldn't afford, and it's just a nice community building
event."
University President John Hennessy and
Provost John Etchemendy have reappointed
Philip Pizzo to a second five-year term as the
dean of Stanford Medical School.
"Stanford is a remarkable university and I
feel privileged to serve as the dean of its school
of medicine," Pizzo said. "I believe that Stanford
has the ability to serve as beacon and role model
for the future of medicine and biomedical re
search and I am committed to do all that 1 can to
help lead that effort."
Hennessy identified Pizzo's "impressive per
formance in his first term and the strong support
he received from faculty, staff, and students" as
key factors in the decision to reappoint him as
dean.
"Dean Pizzo has a long list of accomplish
ments, which include developing the plan for the
Stanford Comprehensive Cancer Center, secur
ing some impressive additions to the Medical
School faculty, pioneering the creation of a new
curriculum for medical education as well as the
scholarly concentration model, and helping to
reestablish financial stability at our hospitals,"
Hennessy noted.
Pizzo first assumed the deanship on April 2,
2001, at a time when Stanford Medical School
was working through a challenging change of
hands with UC-San Francisco. In an effort to
unite faculty, staff and students — as well as to
renew Stanford Medical School's sense of pur
pose — Pizzo launched a multifaceted plan
called Translating Discoveries in Jan. 2002. As a
result of the program, the Medical School initi
ated a new medical student curriculum, added a
master's in medicine program and developed
techniques that translate more of the knowledge
gained from research into concrete treatments.
"Translating Discoveries aligned the School
of Medicine's missions in education, research
and patient care," Pizzo said. "I am particularly
pleased that our Stanford community has drawn
more closely together with the common goal of
fostering discovery and innovation to improve
human health and that we have forged a closer
relationship with our colleagues across the Uni
versity."
Pizzo said he believes it is important for indi
viduals and institutions such as Stanford to help
define the future of medicine and biomedical re
search, which is experiencing an exciting, yet
challenging time. Exciting, he said, in the sense
that recent discoveries and innovations derived
from basic research have the capability to im
prove the diagnosis, treatment and prevention
of human disease. Challenging, on the other
hand, in the sense that the United States is fac
ing rising healthcare costs accompanied by dete
rioration in healthcare quality.
During the next five years as dean. Pizzo said
he thinks that it is important to sustain a "sense
of harmony and forward looking cooperation
among faculty, students and staff to enhance the
School of Medicine's excellence." Specifically.
The idea for the stipend originated with SPILF, but the
University has since recognized its importance and taken it
under its wing. Nelson noted. Now. SPILF helps the Univer
sity fund these stipends while selecting "innovative, new legal
nonprofits that serve underrepresented groups," with which
to award outside program grants, she said.
The group also nominates a public interest lawyer of the
year. Nelson added.
The event drew a diverse crowd, including students, facul
ty and their families according to Jenny Skinner, who co
chaired the silent auction committee.
