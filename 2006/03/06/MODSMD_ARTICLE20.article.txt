Friday's match against the No. 17 Sun
Devils (6-3, 0-3) was complicated by
heavy rain that forced the teams to skip
doubles play and begin with singles.
Playing through the downpour, seniors
Amber Liu and Alice Barnes, junior
Anne Yelsey and sophomore Celia
Durkin all won their singles matches, at
the No. 1, No. 2, N0.4 and No. 6 positions
respectively. These wins earned four
points, clinching the dual-match victory
for the Cardinal.
"There was a brief delay during the
matches, but it was fairly short, so peo
ple went back on and finished up four of
the singles," senior Joanna Kao said.
"Then with Whitney [Deason, a sopho
more] and Theresa [Logar, a junior] the
only ones on court, it started pouring.
We waited around for a little bit, and
then the coaches decided to call the
match."
Ihe sun came out on Saturday for
the match against the Wildcats (9-4, 0-
4). Stanford took the doubles point with
easy wins on all three doubles courts.
Sophomore Lejla Hodzic and freshman
Jessica Nguyen continued their success
as a new doubles team, winning 8-1 at
the No. 3 position.
"It has been great playing with
Lejla," Nguyen said. "I think our games

getting more and more comfortable
with one another on the court."
The Cardinal also swept singles play.
Logar's match went to three sets
after she dropped the first set to Juliette
Mavrolean and won the second.

"U of A came out strong in the sin
gles after the quick doubles sets,"
Nguyen said. "They raised their level
and played tough to get into a lot of the
matches. Mavrolean especially was on
fire with all her shots, but Theresa was
amazing and pulled through."
