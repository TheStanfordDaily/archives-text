# Seniors make a selfish NIT decision
## 
### 
Sometimes, decisions in sports
simply defy explanation.
"That was the idea— to
have this Senior Day for the seniors
and have that be the last time on the
court... It was the seniors and the
team, really. It was everybody's deci
sion," senior Matt Haryasz said to
Scout.com.
What Matt is trying to say here is
that Stanford would refuse a Na
tional Invitation Tournament (NIT)
bid if it means playing at Maples —
they will only play N IT games on the
road. And as it turns out, this deci
sion was left up to the seniors. Ouch.
The Cardinal, who have not
missed the NCAA Tournament since
1993-94, will likely have to beat Ari
zona, UCLA and Washington in
order to make the Big Dance this
year. Unfortunately, the team has
only won one of six games against
these three teams, and that lone win
came in the comfort of Maples Pavil
ion. So, while no one will be rooting
harder for Stanford during the Pac
-10 Tournament than I, it is a safe as
sumption that this will be the year
that we will see the streak broken and
have to settle for an NIT invitation.
For those unfamiliar, the NIT, un
like the NCAA Tournament, is nor
mally played at the home court of the
higher seeded team up until the quar
terfinal round. As a likely high seed in
the NlT,Stanford would have the op
portunity to play in front of its fans a
few more times.That's the good news.
But, for the seniors, the bad news
is that any home game could be
their last. So, instead of following
convention, the class of 2006 decid
ed to declare the UCLA game their
last home contest.
The seniors' decision was not en
tirely unjustified. Going out playing
the highly-seeded Bruins in front of
a sellout crowd could have been
ideal. In NIT games, Stanford might
well host less impressive WCC or
Big Sky teams in a half-empty stadi
um. For stars like Chris Hernandez
and Matt Haryasz, ending a college
career like that would not do their
legacies justice. But then again, nei
ther did this season.
Sometimes you have to suck it up,
seniors. Due to early-season incom
petence, the Cardinal dug themselves
into a hole and out of the NCAA
Tournament, denying fans any March
Madness. And now, the team is not
even letting us live through a few
more games with our favorite players.
In fairness, the decision to play in
the NIT (or not) belongs to the
team. But if I remember correctly,
isn't it coach Trent Johnson who is
always talking about how Sixth Man
is one of the best cheering sections in
the country, and how grateful the
team is for the Club's support?
And it's not just that the team
owes it to the fans, it's that the team
owes it to themselves. There is no
question that the Cardinal have im
proved since the beginning of the
season, but they still have a lot more
to work on. By playing at Maples dur
ing the NIT, Stanford (11-3 at home,
4-8 on the road) will have a signifi
cantly better chance at advancing to
the next rounds. These extra games
could be pivotal for freshman Antho
ny Goods and other young players
who have not seen that much time
this season, but will be critical to our
success in the next few years.
The best part is, if the seniors
don't want to play more games at
home, they can take the bench and
see what our future can do.
As I see it, the senior class is one
of the most humble and selfless
group of players that I see playing
college ball today. That is why this
decision is so perplexing.
I am keeping my fingers crossed
that this whole thing was just an inef
fective ploy to pump up the players
for the UCLA game. Perhaps in the
aftermath of the embarrassing de
feat, the team might change its mind.
"We just got thoroughly out
played," senior Dan Grunfeld re
flected to Scout.com after the rout,
"I know that's not how we wanted
our last game to go at Maples. That's
a little disappointing."
A little disappointing for him and
a little disappointing for all the Stan
ford fans who just want to see the
Card in their groove at least once
more before the season's end.

If Haryasz doesn't want to play, soph
omore Jamie Marincola would gladly
take his spot in an NIT game at
Maples. Tell him why that 's a bad idea

don't want to play more games at
home, they can take the bench and
see what our future can do.
As I see it, the senior class is one
of the most humble and selfless
group of players that I see playing
college ball today. That is why this
decision is so perplexing.
I am keeping my fingers crossed
that this whole thing was just an inef
fective ploy to pump up the players
for the UCLA game. Perhaps in the
aftermath of the embarrassing de
feat, the team might change its mind.
"We just got thoroughly out
played," senior Dan Grunfeld re
flected to Scout.com after the rout,
"I know that's not how we wanted
our last game to go at Maples. That's
a little disappointing."
A little disappointing for him and
a little disappointing for all the Stan
ford fans who just want to see the
Card in their groove at least once
more before the season's end.

If Haryasz doesn't want to play, soph
omore Jamie Marincola would gladly
take his spot in an NIT game at
Maples. Tell him why that 's a bad idea
