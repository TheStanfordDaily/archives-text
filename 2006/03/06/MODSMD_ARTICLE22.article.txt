Committing three errors in a day
doesn't give a team a great shot at win
ning a closely contested ballgame. Con
sidering the fact that the No. 19 Cardi
nal (10-5) achieved this ignominious
feat twice this weekend against cross
hay rival California, it's a small wonder
they were able to split the series' two
games with the Golden Bears (7-6).
In Friday afternoon's series opener,
the visiting Cardinal staged a dramatic
comeback in the top of the ninth that
tied the score at 6-6. But the effort
went to waste, as an errant throw home
from freshman third baseman Austin
Yount in the bottom half of the inning
allowed the Bears to plate the winning
run to claim the 7-6 win.
A day later, it was senior Chris Mi
naker who committed the costly ninth
inning error. With the Cardinal just
one out away from victory, the short
stop booted a routine grounder that
enabled Cal's Chris Errecart to score
and send the game into extra innings.
But two innings later, in the top of
the 11th. Minaker redeemed himself
with a clutch RBI single that propelled
the Cardinal to the 6-5 victory.
Stanford's defensive woes began
early in the weekend, as a pair of errors
in the bottom of the second inning of
the series opener allowed the Bears to
take a 2-1 lead.
Hie Cardinal rallied to retake the
lead in the top of the fifth, plating two on
an RBI single from Minaker and an
error from Bears catcher Garrett
Bussiere. But that was all the offense
Stanford could muster against California
starter Brandon Morrow, who scattered
seven hits in his 7 1/3 innings of work.
The Bears scored three in the bot
tom of the sixth, bringing Cardinal
righthander Greg Reynolds' day to an
early end. The senior hurler's 5 1/3 in
nings of work made his outing in
Berkeley his shortest of the year. The
score remained 6-3 until the top of the
ninth, when the Cardinal responded to
the challenge and retied the game.
Sophomore rightfielder Michael
Taylor's second hit of the day drove in
freshman leftfielder Joey August for
Stanford's first run of the inning. Then,
with the bases loaded, freshman desig
nated hitter Brendan Domaracki
brought the Cardinal back even with a

key two-out single.
But the comeback win was not meant
to be, as the Bears promptly loaded the
bases in their half of the ninth. Bussiere
tapped a slow roller to Yount at third, but
the freshman overthrew senior catcher
John Hester trying to get the force at
home, and Cal came away with the win.
Sophomore Erik Davis (0-1) took the
tough-luck loss for Stanford in his first
decision of the season.
The Cardinal seemed set to turn
things around in their Saturday meeting
with the Bears, scoring once in the first
and four times in the second to take
control of the game with a 5-0 cushion.
Minaker put Stanford on the board
with an RBI single, pushing his season
high hitting streak to eight games.Then in
the second, five of the Cardinal's first six
hitters of the inning reached base. August
and junior centerfielder Jim Rapoport
drove in runs with singles before Mi
naker doubled down the rightfield line to
build the Stanford lead to five. Cal's Chris
Petrini came on in relief to put out the
fire, but the damage was already done.
Still, the Bears wouldn't go down
without a fight, battling to back to a 5-
4 deficit heading into the last half of
the ninth. Junior hurler Blake Holler
put away the first two Cal batters of the
final inning and looked well on his way
to closing things out. But a walk and a
hit batsman put runners on second and
third, before Mmaker's error allowed
the tying run to score.
Neither team was able to score in
the 10th, but Cardinal third baseman
Cord Phelps singled to lead off the
11th. A sacrifice bunt moved him to
second, and Minaker brought him
home with the eventual game-winner
with a single through the left side.
"It felt great because I felt like 1 let
everyone down with the error in the
ninth inning," Minaker said. "I was so
grateful that our guys kept batting and
gave me a chance to make up for it."
Yount was also able to make
amends for his role in the Cardinal's
loss the day before. After playing third
base in Friday's game, the versatile
freshman took the mound for the final
1.2 innings of Stanford's win on Satur
day, shutting down Cal's batters in
order to wrap up the victory. With the
win, the Cardinal salvaged a split of the
series, which was shortened to two
games due to rain yesterday.
The final game of the series will be
rescheduled today, most likely either for
tonight or a date in early May.Tomorrow,
the Cardinal travel to San Jose State be
fore heading down to Southern Califor
nia for a three-game series this weekend.

Cord Phelps singled to lead off the
11th. A sacrifice bunt moved him to
second, and Minaker brought him
home with the eventual game-winner
with a single through the left side.
"It felt great because I felt like 1 let
everyone down with the error in the
ninth inning," Minaker said. "I was so
grateful that our guys kept batting and
gave me a chance to make up for it."
Yount was also able to make
amends for his role in the Cardinal's
loss the day before. After playing third
base in Friday's game, the versatile
freshman took the mound for the final
1.2 innings of Stanford's win on Satur
day, shutting down Cal's batters in
order to wrap up the victory. With the
win, the Cardinal salvaged a split of the
series, which was shortened to two
games due to rain yesterday.
The final game of the series will be
rescheduled today, most likely either for
tonight or a date in early May.Tomorrow,
the Cardinal travel to San Jose State be
fore heading down to Southern Califor
nia for a three-game series this weekend.

Committing three errors in a day
doesn't give a team a great shot at win
ning a closely contested ballgame. Con
sidering the fact that the No. 19 Cardi
nal (10-5) achieved this ignominious
feat twice this weekend against cross
hay rival California, it's a small wonder
they were able to split the series' two
games with the Golden Bears (7-6).
In Friday afternoon's series opener,
the visiting Cardinal staged a dramatic
comeback in the top of the ninth that
tied the score at 6-6. But the effort
went to waste, as an errant throw home
from freshman third baseman Austin
Yount in the bottom half of the inning
allowed the Bears to plate the winning
run to claim the 7-6 win.
A day later, it was senior Chris Mi
naker who committed the costly ninth
inning error. With the Cardinal just
one out away from victory, the short
stop booted a routine grounder that
enabled Cal's Chris Errecart to score
and send the game into extra innings.
But two innings later, in the top of
the 11th. Minaker redeemed himself
with a clutch RBI single that propelled
the Cardinal to the 6-5 victory.
Stanford's defensive woes began
early in the weekend, as a pair of errors
in the bottom of the second inning of
the series opener allowed the Bears to
take a 2-1 lead.
Hie Cardinal rallied to retake the
lead in the top of the fifth, plating two on
an RBI single from Minaker and an
error from Bears catcher Garrett
Bussiere. But that was all the offense
Stanford could muster against California
starter Brandon Morrow, who scattered
seven hits in his 7 1/3 innings of work.
The Bears scored three in the bot
tom of the sixth, bringing Cardinal
righthander Greg Reynolds' day to an
early end. The senior hurler's 5 1/3 in
nings of work made his outing in
Berkeley his shortest of the year. The
score remained 6-3 until the top of the
ninth, when the Cardinal responded to
the challenge and retied the game.
Sophomore rightfielder Michael
Taylor's second hit of the day drove in
freshman leftfielder Joey August for
Stanford's first run of the inning. Then,
with the bases loaded, freshman desig
nated hitter Brendan Domaracki
brought the Cardinal back even with a

key two-out single.
But the comeback win was not meant
to be, as the Bears promptly loaded the
bases in their half of the ninth. Bussiere
tapped a slow roller to Yount at third, but
the freshman overthrew senior catcher
John Hester trying to get the force at
home, and Cal came away with the win.
Sophomore Erik Davis (0-1) took the
tough-luck loss for Stanford in his first
decision of the season.
The Cardinal seemed set to turn
things around in their Saturday meeting
with the Bears, scoring once in the first
and four times in the second to take
control of the game with a 5-0 cushion.
Minaker put Stanford on the board
with an RBI single, pushing his season
high hitting streak to eight games.Then in
the second, five of the Cardinal's first six
hitters of the inning reached base. August
and junior centerfielder Jim Rapoport
drove in runs with singles before Mi
naker doubled down the rightfield line to
build the Stanford lead to five. Cal's Chris
Petrini came on in relief to put out the
fire, but the damage was already done.
Still, the Bears wouldn't go down
without a fight, battling to back to a 5-
4 deficit heading into the last half of
the ninth. Junior hurler Blake Holler
put away the first two Cal batters of the
final inning and looked well on his way
to closing things out. But a walk and a
hit batsman put runners on second and
third, before Mmaker's error allowed
the tying run to score.
Neither team was able to score in
the 10th, but Cardinal third baseman
Cord Phelps singled to lead off the
11th. A sacrifice bunt moved him to
second, and Minaker brought him
home with the eventual game-winner
with a single through the left side.
"It felt great because I felt like 1 let

allowed the Bears to plate the winning
run to claim the 7-6 win.
A day later, it was senior Chris Mi
naker who committed the costly ninth
inning error. With the Cardinal just
one out away from victory, the short
stop booted a routine grounder that
enabled Cal's Chris Errecart to score
and send the game into extra innings.
But two innings later, in the top of
the 11th. Minaker redeemed himself
with a clutch RBI single that propelled
the Cardinal to the 6-5 victory.
Stanford's defensive woes began
early in the weekend, as a pair of errors
in the bottom of the second inning of
the series opener allowed the Bears to
take a 2-1 lead.
Hie Cardinal rallied to retake the
lead in the top of the fifth, plating two on
an RBI single from Minaker and an
error from Bears catcher Garrett
Bussiere. But that was all the offense
Stanford could muster against California
starter Brandon Morrow, who scattered
seven hits in his 7 1/3 innings of work.
The Bears scored three in the bot
tom of the sixth, bringing Cardinal
righthander Greg Reynolds' day to an
early end. The senior hurler's 5 1/3 in
nings of work made his outing in
Berkeley his shortest of the year. The
score remained 6-3 until the top of the
ninth, when the Cardinal responded to
the challenge and retied the game.
Sophomore rightfielder Michael
Taylor's second hit of the day drove in
freshman leftfielder Joey August for
Stanford's first run of the inning. Then,
with the bases loaded, freshman desig
nated hitter Brendan Domaracki
brought the Cardinal back even with a

key two-out single.
But the comeback win was not meant
to be, as the Bears promptly loaded the
bases in their half of the ninth. Bussiere
tapped a slow roller to Yount at third, but
the freshman overthrew senior catcher
John Hester trying to get the force at
home, and Cal came away with the win.
Sophomore Erik Davis (0-1) took the
tough-luck loss for Stanford in his first
decision of the season.
The Cardinal seemed set to turn
things around in their Saturday meeting
with the Bears, scoring once in the first
and four times in the second to take
control of the game with a 5-0 cushion.
Minaker put Stanford on the board
with an RBI single, pushing his season
high hitting streak to eight games.Then in
the second, five of the Cardinal's first six
hitters of the inning reached base. August
and junior centerfielder Jim Rapoport
drove in runs with singles before Mi
naker doubled down the rightfield line to
build the Stanford lead to five. Cal's Chris
Petrini came on in relief to put out the
fire, but the damage was already done.
Still, the Bears wouldn't go down
without a fight, battling to back to a 5-
4 deficit heading into the last half of
the ninth. Junior hurler Blake Holler
put away the first two Cal batters of the
final inning and looked well on his way
to closing things out. But a walk and a
hit batsman put runners on second and
third, before Mmaker's error allowed
the tying run to score.
Neither team was able to score in
the 10th, but Cardinal third baseman
Cord Phelps singled to lead off the
11th. A sacrifice bunt moved him to
second, and Minaker brought him
home with the eventual game-winner
with a single through the left side.
"It felt great because I felt like 1 let
everyone down with the error in the
ninth inning," Minaker said. "I was so
grateful that our guys kept batting and
gave me a chance to make up for it."
Yount was also able to make
amends for his role in the Cardinal's
loss the day before. After playing third
base in Friday's game, the versatile
freshman took the mound for the final
1.2 innings of Stanford's win on Satur
day, shutting down Cal's batters in
order to wrap up the victory. With the
win, the Cardinal salvaged a split of the
series, which was shortened to two
games due to rain yesterday.
The final game of the series will be
rescheduled today, most likely either for
tonight or a date in early May.Tomorrow,
the Cardinal travel to San Jose State be
fore heading down to Southern Califor
nia for a three-game series this weekend.

Committing three errors in a day
doesn't give a team a great shot at win
ning a closely contested ballgame. Con
sidering the fact that the No. 19 Cardi
nal (10-5) achieved this ignominious
feat twice this weekend against cross
hay rival California, it's a small wonder
they were able to split the series' two
games with the Golden Bears (7-6).
In Friday afternoon's series opener,
the visiting Cardinal staged a dramatic
comeback in the top of the ninth that
tied the score at 6-6. But the effort
went to waste, as an errant throw home
from freshman third baseman Austin
Yount in the bottom half of the inning
allowed the Bears to plate the winning
run to claim the 7-6 win.
A day later, it was senior Chris Mi
naker who committed the costly ninth
inning error. With the Cardinal just

stop booted a routine grounder that
