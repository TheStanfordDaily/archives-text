### ANDY LOMELI STAFF WRITER 
With two outs in the top of the sev
enth. senior outfielder Catalina Morris
stepped up to the plate with the No. 5
Stanford softball team trailing No. 16

four-run rally. Morris remained cool and
knocked a single to center field, advanc

third and sparking a comeback that
would propel the Cardinal (17-4) to the 5-
4 victory.
Senior catcher Lauren Lappin did her
share in the next at-bat, collecting a dou
ble to score Howe and move Morris to
third. Trailing 4-1, Stanford's timely rally
was capped with a three-run round-trip
per off the bat of freshman infielder
Maddy Coon. Sophomore infielder
Michelle Smith was hit by a pitch in the
next at-bat. giving her the free trip to first.
The Wildcats answered by replacing be
fuddled starter Eileen Canney with
Courtnay Foster, who forced a fly-out to
end the inning.
"It was an amazing experience," Mor
ris said. "After the game, we were laugh

ing at how excited we had been. We
couldn't even stand still playing defense
on the field. We walked off the field with
really high emotions."
Stanford's excitement quickly evapo
rated as Northwestern threatened again
in the bottom of the seventh. The Wild
cats opened the inning with a double and
an intentional walk. After a foul-out.
Northwestern 's Ashley Crane scorched a
line-drive right into the glove of sopho
more outfielder Anna Beardman, who
threw out the Cats' runner at second to
complete the double-play.
ITie Cardinal loaded the bases with no
outs to start the eighth inning. A strikeout
later. Beardman grounded out to second
to cash in the go-ahead run. Morris then
struckout to end the inning. A sacrifice
bunt placed a runner on third to begin the
Wildcats' half of the inning, but the threat
would end there, as the Cardinal clinched
the one-run victory with a Northwestern
fly-out and strikeout.
Solo blasts in the Wildcats' first two in
nings drove Northwestern to the early 2-
0 lead. The Cats added two more runs in
the third.
Freshman Missy Penna threw eight in
nings. allowing nine hits and five walks
while notching six strikeouts. Northwest
ern's Canney struckout 13 before giving
up seven hits and two walks in the sev
enth.
"We had some late-game heroics and
great hitting off a great hitter," head
coach John Rittman said. "Anytime you
have the talent we have, you never give
up. The players were frustrated from the

loss earlier in the day, but they fought
through and succeeded."
A few hours before their comeback
against Northwestern, the Cardinal
dropped a 2-0 decision to UC-Santa Bar
bara.
UCSB's Kendra Singley drove home
Christine Ramos on a single to left center
in the top of the first. The Gauchos added
an extra run in the fourth to ice the score
at 2-0. McCullough allowed five hits while
collecting a strikeout in seven innings of
work.
Stanford defeated Purdue, 4-0. to open

three-run homer in the bottom of the
third. The blast ended two and a half
scoreless innings as the Cardinal grabbed
the lead for good. A single from Smith in
the fifth drove in Morris for the insurance
run. Penna added seven innings and 11
strikeouts to her weekend campaign.
The Cardinal's scheduled opener
against No. 2 Tennessee Friday was can
celed due to rain.
Stanford ended its weekend with a 4-2
win over Cal-State Fullerton.
Coon nabbed her seventh dinger of
the year in the fourth to put the Cardinal
ahead 1-0. Fullerton retaliated with a
two-run blast in the inning's bottom
frame. Morris collected another homerun
in the sixth before Stanford added two
more insurance runs in the seventh.
Penna pitched five and a third innings,
allowing three hits and three walks while
striking out two. McCullough closed the
game with two hits, no walks, and three
strikeouts.

"The best thing we realized this week
end is our ability to come back." Morris
said. "We weren't at the top of our game
in every aspect, but we realized through
out the weekend that we needed to pick it
up a little bit, especially the comeback
after the wake-up call of losing earlier in
the day [to lIC/SB]."
Rittman echoed Morris' opinion while
still maintaining the team has room for
improvement.
"I'd like to see us be more consistent
offensively and find other places to
pitch," Rittman said. "But we're finding
ways to win games. I'm proud of the kids.
They're fighting through and giving their
best."
