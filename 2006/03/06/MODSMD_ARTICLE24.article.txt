# MEN'S SWIM & DIVE
## Silver year in a golden streak tor swimmers 
### KATHERINE BELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Not many teams get to celebrate being the best in
their conference. Even fewer get to throw that same
party 25 years in a row.
But No. 1 men's swimming and diving isn't your av
erage team. And when they claimed their 25th straight
Pac-10 title this weekend, they kept alive the longest
conference title streak in the history of the Pac-10.
The man most responsible for the team's domina
tion the past 25 years is head coach Skip Kenney, who
has also led the men to seven NCAA titles during his
28-year tenure at Stanford. Kenney has been named
the Pac-10 coach of the year 16 times, and has only lost
two dual meets in the past six years. 2006 seems to be no
exception to his success.
A week before the swimming events even began,
freshman diver Dwight Duniais catapulted the Cardi
nal to a strong start by grabbing two seconds and a third
in the 1 -meter, 3-meter, and platform events at the Pac
-10 Diving Championships.
Then, the Card placed third in both the 200-yard
medley relay and the 800 freestyle relay. And even
though the two relays' times met the NCAA automatic
standards, the men were trailing both No. 3 California
and No. 6 Arizona going into Day 2.
However, once the individual events began on
Thursday, the men stole the lead and didn't look back.
Perhaps the meet was clinched in Thursday's 200 in
dividual medley, in which junior Hongzhe Sun, senior
Mark Stephens and freshman Nate Cass finished 1-2-3,
respectively, all under the NCAA "A" standard.The IM
not only showcased the Cardinal's unmatchable depth
and versatility, but also propelled the team into first
place. With five men placing in the top eight in the IM.
Sun believes the race raised team morale.
"The 200 IM was a big confidence boost, especially
since we fell a little behind after the first day,"he said.
Sun also won the 100 and 2(M) backstrokes, making
him the only man in the meet to win three individual
events.
By capturing a tight race in the 50 free, junior Ben
Wildman-Tobriner proved to be the fastest man in the
conference. His time of 19.26 is also the second-fastest
time in the nation so far this year. He went on to win the
100 free and place second in the 100 butterfly.
Also winning for the Cardinal was distance swim
mer junior Shaun Phillips, who dominated the mile, fin
ishing nearly 20 seconds ahead of the rest of the field.
Phillips also took third in the 500 free and fourth in the
200 free. The 200-free relay team of freshman Jason
Dunford, Wildman-Tobriner, junior Kyle Ransom and
junior Matt Crowe took top honors with the team's
only relay victory by out-swimming a supposedly un
touchable Cal team.
According to Sun, the freshmen class had a break
through meet, racking up points that were essential for
the team's win.
"There were a lot of step-up swims, especially from
the freshmen," he said. "That got the team excited and
everything just snowballed from there."
In his first Pac-10 Championship meet, freshman
Paul Kornfeld showed his stuff by defeating Cal senior
Henrique Barbosa in the 200 breaststroke and placing
second in the 100 breaststroke. Frosh sprinter Dunford
was a key player in four of the five relays, also placing
fifth in the 50 free, fourth in the 1 (X) free and sixth in the
100 fly. In addition to his third-place finish in the 200 IM,
Cass also added significantly to the team effort placing
fifth in the 1(K) back and seventh in the 2(X) back.
Other newcomers scoring points were freshman
breaststrokers Chris Ash and Paul Zaich and freshman
backstroker Scott Lathrope.
What initially looked like a close meet turned out to
be a runaway victory for the Cardinal men. who scored
880 points, a full 84 more than second-place Cal. How
ever, the men are far from finished with their season.
While winning Pac-lOs proves they are the best in
the conference yet again, the men look ahead to a more
daunting feat â€” capturing their first NCAA title since
1998. The meet will kick-off March 23 at the Georgia
Tech aquatic center in Atlanta. Ga. With a No. 1 rank
ing and a victory in arguably the fastest conference
championship meet in the nation, the Cardinal know
that the NCAA title is within reach.
Sun is looking forward to seeing what the team is re
ally capable of achieving.
"Winning Pac- 10s means we know we're on the right
track, and by working out the details and getting more
rest, there's no limit to how well this team can do at
NCAAs."
