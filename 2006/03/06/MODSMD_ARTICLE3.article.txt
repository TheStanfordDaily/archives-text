You could see it in every pass to an
empty spot on the Maples Pavilion floor.
You could hear it in every groan from
the full-capacity crowd of 7,334.
You could sense it in every spinning
Dan Grunfeld runner, every rushed fade
away jumper, every hall that slipped off a

Stanford player's fingertips.
Desperation. Hie Cardinal tried to
make up for their lack of quickness by
playing too fast for much of Saturday's
contest against No. 15 UCLA (24-6.14-4).
All told, the Cardinal (15-12,11-7 Pac
-10) committed 15 turnovers — 12 of them
in the decisive first half— and 105t,75-54,
on the final day of the regular season. It
was Stanford's most lopsided defeat at
Maples since a 25-point loss to Jason Kidd
and Berkeley in 1993.
