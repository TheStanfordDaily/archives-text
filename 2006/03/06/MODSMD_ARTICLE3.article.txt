# UCLA 75. STANFORD 54
## CRASH Largest home loss since '93, Card worse "at every position" 
### SEAN HOWELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
You could see it in every pass to an
empty spot on the Maples Pavilion floor.
You could hear it in every groan from
the full-capacity crowd of 7,334.
You could sense it in every spinning
Dan Grunfeld runner, every rushed fade
away jumper, every hall that slipped off a

Stanford player's fingertips.
Desperation. Hie Cardinal tried to
make up for their lack of quickness by
playing too fast for much of Saturday's
contest against No. 15 UCLA (24-6.14-4).
All told, the Cardinal (15-12,11-7 Pac
-10) committed 15 turnovers — 12 of them
in the decisive first half— and 105t,75-54,
on the final day of the regular season. It
was Stanford's most lopsided defeat at
Maples since a 25-point loss to Jason Kidd
and Berkeley in 1993.


NINA GONZALUDO/The Stanford Daily
Combining for 26 points, senior guard Dan Grunfeld (above) and freshman guard An
thony Goods each benefitted from the attention paid to Haryasz and Hernandez.
But the Ben Howland-coached Bruins' calm, precise execu
tion of their offense made anything that Stanford did — or did
n't do — somewhat irrelevant. With the win. the Bruins clinched
sole possession of the Pac-10 Title.
"It's a tough loss for us, 1 don't think we really need to look at
the stats to know what happened," said Grunfeld. who thrived in
Stanford's frenetic offense and led the team with 14 points. "We
were thoroughly outplayed. We didn't want our last game at
Maples to be like that."
The loss effectively guarantees that head coach Trent John
son's team will have to win the Pac-lOTournament next weekend
to secure an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. But Stan
ford's chances of winning three consecutive games against con
ference opponents seem slim, especially if the team has to face
UCLA again.
"They're better than us at every position," senior guard Chris
Hernandez said flatly.
Knowing that they were facing a more athletic opponent, the
Cardinal hurried out of the gate, fumbling the ball away on their
first three possessions — but still jumping to a short-lived 5-0
lead.
ITie Bruins, meanwhile, executed their offense with poise,
shooting 50 percent on the game and out-rebounding the Cardi
nal at both ends, 33-24.They rebounded from their initial deficit,
and unsettled Stanford, with a 19-4 run early in the first half,
keyed by four three-pointers. UCLA worked for open shots,
drove to the basket and often got a second opportunity when
they missed, as they secured 15 offensive rebounds.
The Cardinal played catch-up for much of the first period and
fell behind 38-24 by the time the halftime whistle blew. Bruin
sophomore point guard Jordan Farmar ran UCLA's offense and
controlled the pace in the first half, scoring 11 of his 13 points be
fore the break. Farmar also dished out a game-high seven assists.
"They do a very good job of executing, using the shot clock
and putting ball in Jordan's hands," Johnson said."He makes the
game look easy, no matter what defense we were using on him,
and he makes guys better."
Stanford, meanwhile, was unable to get the ball into the hands
of its scorers. Hernandez, scoreless at the half, finished with only
five attempted shots, nine points and three assists. Often stifled
by a double team. Haryasz turned in a sub-par performance,
shooting only 3-of-10 from the field and 2-of-5 from the free
throw line to finish with just eight points.
Ilaryasz has averaged only 11.7 points in nine games since he
was poked in the eye at Oregon on Feb. 2. But Johnson credited
UCLA's defense, not Haryasz's vision, with his relative ineffec
tiveness on Saturday.
"You have to give credit to the defense," Johnson said."Teams
have been physical with Matt and Chris, they've been doubling
them. All the teams we struggled against have done a good job of
taking Matt out of the game and making Chris work.
"As with all good teams, UCLA's defense dictates how they
play."
The Cardinal came out with more energy in the second half
and cut the Bruin lead to 53-44 with an 11-4 run that featured
three-pointers from freshman Anthony Goods, Hernandez and
freshman Lawrence Hill. Goods started in place of freshman
guard Mitch Johnson and scored a career-high 12 points, making
all three of his attempts from beyond the arc.
But unlike Stanford, UCLA recharged its offense after the
Cardinal cut into the lead.The Bruins responded with a 14-2 run
of their own. working the clock and pounding the ball inside to
freshman forward Luc Richard Mbah a Moute for three layups.
Sophomore guard Aaron Afflalo capped the run when he hit a
three and took a foul, converting the four-point play to put the
Bruins up, 67-46, and stamp the victory with 5:52 remaining.
Afflalo finished with 16 points on 5-of-7 shooting. Mbah a
Moute, a Cameroon native, scored 12, and senior forward Ryan
Hollins added 13 for the Bruins.
Ihe Cardinal will go back to work in practice this week,
preparing for weekend they will decide their season after a game
in which their faults seemed limitless.
"There isn't one or two things we need to do [to improve],"
Hernandez said. "(Our problems are] numerous.To put a finger
on something would give us an easy way out."

JOEL LEWENSTEIN/The Stanford Daily
Senior forward Matt Haryasz struggled against UCLA's double team, much like
he has against similar defensive focus ever since returning from his eye injury.
You could see it in every pass to an
empty spot on the Maples Pavilion floor.
You could hear it in every groan from
the full-capacity crowd of 7,334.
You could sense it in every spinning
Dan Grunfeld runner, every rushed fade
away jumper, every hall that slipped off a

Stanford player's fingertips.
Desperation. Hie Cardinal tried to
make up for their lack of quickness by
playing too fast for much of Saturday's
contest against No. 15 UCLA (24-6.14-4).
All told, the Cardinal (15-12,11-7 Pac
-10) committed 15 turnovers — 12 of them
in the decisive first half— and 105t,75-54,
on the final day of the regular season. It
was Stanford's most lopsided defeat at
Maples since a 25-point loss to Jason Kidd
and Berkeley in 1993.


NINA GONZALUDO/The Stanford Daily
Combining for 26 points, senior guard Dan Grunfeld (above) and freshman guard An
thony Goods each benefitted from the attention paid to Haryasz and Hernandez.
But the Ben Howland-coached Bruins' calm, precise execu
tion of their offense made anything that Stanford did — or did
n't do — somewhat irrelevant. With the win. the Bruins clinched
sole possession of the Pac-10 Title.
"It's a tough loss for us, 1 don't think we really need to look at
the stats to know what happened," said Grunfeld. who thrived in
Stanford's frenetic offense and led the team with 14 points. "We
were thoroughly outplayed. We didn't want our last game at
Maples to be like that."
The loss effectively guarantees that head coach Trent John
son's team will have to win the Pac-lOTournament next weekend
to secure an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. But Stan
ford's chances of winning three consecutive games against con
ference opponents seem slim, especially if the team has to face
UCLA again.
"They're better than us at every position," senior guard Chris
Hernandez said flatly.
Knowing that they were facing a more athletic opponent, the
Cardinal hurried out of the gate, fumbling the ball away on their
first three possessions — but still jumping to a short-lived 5-0
lead.
ITie Bruins, meanwhile, executed their offense with poise,
shooting 50 percent on the game and out-rebounding the Cardi
nal at both ends, 33-24.They rebounded from their initial deficit,
and unsettled Stanford, with a 19-4 run early in the first half,
keyed by four three-pointers. UCLA worked for open shots,
drove to the basket and often got a second opportunity when
they missed, as they secured 15 offensive rebounds.
The Cardinal played catch-up for much of the first period and
fell behind 38-24 by the time the halftime whistle blew. Bruin
sophomore point guard Jordan Farmar ran UCLA's offense and
controlled the pace in the first half, scoring 11 of his 13 points be
fore the break. Farmar also dished out a game-high seven assists.
"They do a very good job of executing, using the shot clock
and putting ball in Jordan's hands," Johnson said."He makes the
game look easy, no matter what defense we were using on him,
and he makes guys better."
Stanford, meanwhile, was unable to get the ball into the hands
of its scorers. Hernandez, scoreless at the half, finished with only
five attempted shots, nine points and three assists. Often stifled
by a double team. Haryasz turned in a sub-par performance,
shooting only 3-of-10 from the field and 2-of-5 from the free
throw line to finish with just eight points.
Ilaryasz has averaged only 11.7 points in nine games since he
was poked in the eye at Oregon on Feb. 2. But Johnson credited
UCLA's defense, not Haryasz's vision, with his relative ineffec
tiveness on Saturday.
"You have to give credit to the defense," Johnson said."Teams
have been physical with Matt and Chris, they've been doubling
them. All the teams we struggled against have done a good job of
taking Matt out of the game and making Chris work.
"As with all good teams, UCLA's defense dictates how they
play."
The Cardinal came out with more energy in the second half
and cut the Bruin lead to 53-44 with an 11-4 run that featured
three-pointers from freshman Anthony Goods, Hernandez and
freshman Lawrence Hill. Goods started in place of freshman
guard Mitch Johnson and scored a career-high 12 points, making
all three of his attempts from beyond the arc.
But unlike Stanford, UCLA recharged its offense after the
Cardinal cut into the lead.The Bruins responded with a 14-2 run
of their own. working the clock and pounding the ball inside to
freshman forward Luc Richard Mbah a Moute for three layups.
Sophomore guard Aaron Afflalo capped the run when he hit a
three and took a foul, converting the four-point play to put the
Bruins up, 67-46, and stamp the victory with 5:52 remaining.
Afflalo finished with 16 points on 5-of-7 shooting. Mbah a
Moute, a Cameroon native, scored 12, and senior forward Ryan
Hollins added 13 for the Bruins.
Ihe Cardinal will go back to work in practice this week,
preparing for weekend they will decide their season after a game
in which their faults seemed limitless.
"There isn't one or two things we need to do [to improve],"
Hernandez said. "(Our problems are] numerous.To put a finger
on something would give us an easy way out."
