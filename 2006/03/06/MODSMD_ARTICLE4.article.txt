### MIMA MOHAMMED DESK EDITOR 
"People worry if they could afford bus fare or
breakfast. They worry that their kids won't have
a better life than they did," said Anna Burger,
chair of the Change to Win Federation, during
her passionate speech on the ongoing struggle
for worker's rights.
Leading faculty and legal practitioners across
the country convened at Stanford Law School
last Saturday for a symposium entitled "The

New Frontier in Workers Rights" to reflect on
the future of labor and employment law.
The conference focused on public interest
law faculty and students. The day-long sympo
sium featured numerous influential speakers
and panels addressing issues such as: "The Legal
and Political Future of the IJS Labor Move
ment," "Local and State Models for Protecting
Workers," "Immigrant Workers' Rights,"
"Lessons Learned after the Hurricanes" and
"The Ongoing Battle against Employment Dis
crimination."
Burger, who gave the lunchtime keynote
speech, is the highest-ranking woman in the U.S.
labor movement. As international secretary
treasurer of the Services Employees Interna
tional Union (SElU),she directs the union's po
litical and field operations. With 1.8 million

members, SEIU is the largest and fastest grow
ing union in America,and a leading voice on pro
gressive issues such as globalization, immigra
tion rights and quality and affordable health
care.
Last year. Burger became the first woman to
head a major U.S. labor federation when she was
elected chair of the Change to Win Federation.
Change to Win was founded by SEIU and six
other national unions and represents nearly six
million working families. It stated goal is to reach
out to millions of unorganized workers across
the nation who want the opportunity to form a
union so they can win better wages, affordable
health care and a better future for themselves
that their families.
Burger began her speech by addressing what current
working families are facing in their everyday lives. She
spoke about struggles such as increasing layoffs and
work hours that is coupled with stagnated wages, de
creased family time, less retirement security and a de
crease in quality health care.
She also summarized the growing economic divide in

the United States,
which is expanding
more rapidly in con
trast to other nations.
She cited the after
math of Hurricane
Katrina, when peo
ple could not afford
the transportation
costs to evacuate the
area. Throughout the
country, the produc
tivity level for work
ing people has gone
up, she said, but not
their wages —
whereas chief execu
tive officer pay has
skyrocketed.
Addressing the
power of education.
Burger spoke about
her own life and
working class back
ground. She said her
opportunity to ob
tain an education al
lowed her to elevate
her socioeconomic
status, while point
ing out that it is be
coming harder for

"Globalization has
been sweeping our
world. Walmart is
now the largest
employer or our
country...but [they]
do not allow their
workers to unionize."
ANNA BURGER,
chair of Change to
Win Federation

children in working
families to gain access to higher level education be
cause of the growing economic divide. She added that
the number of children in working families is decreas
ing at higher-level institutions such as Stanford.
ITie source of a lot of these problems, according to
Berger, is a decrease in union membership over time.
"Globalization has been sweeping our world. Wal
mart is now the largest employer of our country and
they have so much power in the economy, but do not
allow their workers to unionize," Burger said.
Burger said she believes that this issue could be
stemmed by holding public officials accountable, build
ing a movement strong enough to set standards for af
fordable health care, working on joint campaigns and
global partnerships in addition to rebuilding worker
strength in nonunion sectors.
In her speech. Burger also praised the Stanford
Labor Action Coalition (SLAC) for their efforts in the
recent strike to ensure that workers at Stanford are
treated fairly. Burger said that the University continues

to contract out their labor, which is not the best interest
of their workers.
"Lawyers everyday can make a difference, corpora
tions should not be able to use the bankruptcy laws to
get out of paying," she said.
Burger also addressed the battle for immigrant
workers and their rights, referring to the F. James
Sensenbrenner-sponsored bill. The Border Protection,
Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of
2005 — passed on Dec. 16, 2005 by the U.S. House of
Representatives — as "horrible."
The bill amends the Immigration and Nationality
Act to make it a felony to "assist...a person to reside in

or remain in the United States or to attempt to reside in
or remain in the United States, knowing or in reckless
disregard of the fact that such person is an alien who
lacks lawful authority to reside in or remain in the Unit
ed States."
The language of the bill has been assailed be critics
as overly broad.
The struggle for workers' rights is paramount to the
ideals of the United States, Burger said.
"I have a sense of urgency and a sense of passion,"
she added. "Wealth is something that should be shared.
Iliat's what this country was built on, that idea of the
American dream."

Anna Burger speaks on worker rights at the New Frontier Symposium on Saturday at Stanford Law School.
"People worry if they could afford bus fare or
breakfast. They worry that their kids won't have
a better life than they did," said Anna Burger,
chair of the Change to Win Federation, during
her passionate speech on the ongoing struggle
for worker's rights.
Leading faculty and legal practitioners across
the country convened at Stanford Law School
last Saturday for a symposium entitled "The

New Frontier in Workers Rights" to reflect on
the future of labor and employment law.
The conference focused on public interest
law faculty and students. The day-long sympo
sium featured numerous influential speakers
and panels addressing issues such as: "The Legal
and Political Future of the IJS Labor Move
ment," "Local and State Models for Protecting
Workers," "Immigrant Workers' Rights,"
"Lessons Learned after the Hurricanes" and
"The Ongoing Battle against Employment Dis
crimination."
Burger, who gave the lunchtime keynote
speech, is the highest-ranking woman in the U.S.
labor movement. As international secretary
treasurer of the Services Employees Interna
tional Union (SElU),she directs the union's po
litical and field operations. With 1.8 million

members, SEIU is the largest and fastest grow
ing union in America,and a leading voice on pro
gressive issues such as globalization, immigra
tion rights and quality and affordable health
care.
Last year. Burger became the first woman to
head a major U.S. labor federation when she was
elected chair of the Change to Win Federation.
Change to Win was founded by SEIU and six
other national unions and represents nearly six
million working families. It stated goal is to reach
out to millions of unorganized workers across
the nation who want the opportunity to form a
union so they can win better wages, affordable
health care and a better future for themselves
that their families.
Burger began her speech by addressing what current
working families are facing in their everyday lives. She
spoke about struggles such as increasing layoffs and
work hours that is coupled with stagnated wages, de
creased family time, less retirement security and a de
crease in quality health care.
She also summarized the growing economic divide in

the United States,
which is expanding
more rapidly in con
trast to other nations.
She cited the after
math of Hurricane
Katrina, when peo
ple could not afford
the transportation
costs to evacuate the
area. Throughout the
country, the produc
tivity level for work
ing people has gone
up, she said, but not
their wages —
whereas chief execu
tive officer pay has
skyrocketed.
Addressing the
power of education.
Burger spoke about
her own life and
working class back
ground. She said her
opportunity to ob
tain an education al
lowed her to elevate
her socioeconomic
status, while point
ing out that it is be
coming harder for

"Globalization has
been sweeping our
world. Walmart is
now the largest
employer or our
country...but [they]
do not allow their
workers to unionize."

chair of Change to
Win Federation

children in working
families to gain access to higher level education be
cause of the growing economic divide. She added that
the number of children in working families is decreas
ing at higher-level institutions such as Stanford.
ITie source of a lot of these problems, according to
Berger, is a decrease in union membership over time.
"Globalization has been sweeping our world. Wal
mart is now the largest employer of our country and
they have so much power in the economy, but do not
allow their workers to unionize," Burger said.
Burger said she believes that this issue could be
stemmed by holding public officials accountable, build
ing a movement strong enough to set standards for af
fordable health care, working on joint campaigns and
global partnerships in addition to rebuilding worker
strength in nonunion sectors.
In her speech. Burger also praised the Stanford
Labor Action Coalition (SLAC) for their efforts in the
recent strike to ensure that workers at Stanford are
treated fairly. Burger said that the University continues

to contract out their labor, which is not the best interest
of their workers.
"Lawyers everyday can make a difference, corpora
tions should not be able to use the bankruptcy laws to
get out of paying," she said.
Burger also addressed the battle for immigrant
workers and their rights, referring to the F. James
Sensenbrenner-sponsored bill. The Border Protection,
Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of
2005 — passed on Dec. 16, 2005 by the U.S. House of
Representatives — as "horrible."
The bill amends the Immigration and Nationality
Act to make it a felony to "assist...a person to reside in

or remain in the United States or to attempt to reside in
or remain in the United States, knowing or in reckless
disregard of the fact that such person is an alien who
lacks lawful authority to reside in or remain in the Unit
ed States."
The language of the bill has been assailed be critics
as overly broad.
The struggle for workers' rights is paramount to the
ideals of the United States, Burger said.
"I have a sense of urgency and a sense of passion,"
she added. "Wealth is something that should be shared.
Iliat's what this country was built on, that idea of the
American dream."
