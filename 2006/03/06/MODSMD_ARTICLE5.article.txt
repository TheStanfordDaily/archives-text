With the I lousing Draw quickly ap
proaching, students will have a wider
variety of rooming options to choose
from. Added to the list of residential
programs will be two new initiatives, as
Wilbur Hall's Arroyo will feature a
symbolic systems focus for its upper
class students and Manzanita Park's
Lantana House will host a one-unit
residential humanities program.
Devised by the resident fellows of
these dorms, the initiatives aim to at
tract upper-class students with similar
academic interests. With University
support from Dean of Student Affairs
Greg Boardman and Vice Provost of
Undergraduate Education John Brav
man, the programs will be implement
ed initially for a trial period, after
which permanent changes may be
made.

Termed the "Mind and Intelligence
Focus," Arroyo's symbolic systems
program looks to draw in a range of
students attracted to the interdiscipli
nary field. As described in a Universi
ty press release, the dorm will offer
residential seminars, guest speakers
and coordinated discussions.
" llie Mind and Intelligence Focus
is intended to be of interest to anyone
who wonders how the mind woiks,
how people behave and communicate
and what the future holds for comput
ers and artificial intelligence," the re
lease noted.
An upgraded multi-media seminar
space will also be featured in Arroyo
to facilitate an understanding of sym
bolic systems material. Residential
Fellow David Beaver endorsed the
new technology and described his
hopes for the program.
