## Dorms Take on Themes Arroyo, Lantana gain new focus, programming 
### AMIT ARORA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With the I lousing Draw quickly ap
proaching, students will have a wider
variety of rooming options to choose
from. Added to the list of residential
programs will be two new initiatives, as
Wilbur Hall's Arroyo will feature a
symbolic systems focus for its upper
class students and Manzanita Park's
Lantana House will host a one-unit
residential humanities program.
Devised by the resident fellows of
these dorms, the initiatives aim to at
tract upper-class students with similar
academic interests. With University
support from Dean of Student Affairs
Greg Boardman and Vice Provost of
Undergraduate Education John Brav
man, the programs will be implement
ed initially for a trial period, after
which permanent changes may be
made.

Termed the "Mind and Intelligence
Focus," Arroyo's symbolic systems
program looks to draw in a range of
students attracted to the interdiscipli
nary field. As described in a Universi
ty press release, the dorm will offer
residential seminars, guest speakers
and coordinated discussions.
" llie Mind and Intelligence Focus
is intended to be of interest to anyone
who wonders how the mind woiks,
how people behave and communicate
and what the future holds for comput
ers and artificial intelligence," the re
lease noted.
An upgraded multi-media seminar
space will also be featured in Arroyo
to facilitate an understanding of sym
bolic systems material. Residential
Fellow David Beaver endorsed the
new technology and described his
hopes for the program.
"The new multimedia space in
Arroyo is a space where we can show
movies and provide enhanced pre
sentations and is a good space for
small group meetings and collabora
tive project work," he said. "We're
hoping this new enhanced space will
have a very positive impact on the
dorm."
In an interview with The Daily,
Beaver outlined specific programs
that will be featured in Arroyo next
year.
"Programming will include spe
cial events trips, visiting speakers
and in-house one-unit seminars on
general interest topics which pose
enjoyable intellectual challenges re
lated to the dorm focus," he said.
"Seminar topics we're looking at in
clude AI in the movies, computer
game interfaces, how to solve puz
zles and the nature of humor."
While the symbolic systems
major has become increasingly pop
ular on campus among students of
all years, the Mind and Intelligence
Focus has been reserved for upper
class students next year. Beaver
added that the program may expand
in future years depending on its ap
peal.
"The aim was to rebalance the
distribution of upperclassmen in
Wilbur so that the remaining four
class dorms would have a higher per
centage of frosh than has been the
case for the last couple of years," he
said. "Thirty-five to 50 [percent]
frosh seems to be a critical mass. Per
haps a four-class version is some
thing the University might try in the
future. Based on the huge demand
for symbolic systems-related fresh
man seminars, I'm confident that the
interest is there among incoming
freshmen as well."
While the program will be head
ed by Beaver, focus assistants are
needed to coordinate specific activi
ties. He emphasized the need for a
team focus.
"After seven years of RF experi
ence, I know it's vital that we don't
impose too much programming
structure on the new yet-to-be-hired
staff, but rather develop the new pro
gram as a team," he said.
While Arroyo will implement a
symbolic systems theme, Lantana
will highlight the humanities for its
upper-class students. With projects
directed by humanities professors,
the program will look to draw 30 res
idents into the house under special
priority.
Its educational focus will include
English, history, philosophy, reli
gious studies, classics, comparative
literature and modern languages
and literature. Resident Fellows
Barbara Pitkin and Brent Sockness
hope to attract students with com
mon interests in the field.
"We are both professors of Reli
gious Studies with broad interests in
other humanistic disciplines," Pitkin
and Sockness wrote in a joint email
to The Daily. "As professors and aca
demic advisors, we have noticed that
'fuzzy' students can feel intellectual
ly isolated and marginalized at Stan
ford. Since we are passionate about
the liberal arts and the integration of
life and learning that is at the heart
of Residential Education's mission,
we feel that a humanities-theme
dorm will address an unmet need
among Stanford undergraduates
and play to our own strengths and in
terests as members of the University
community."
Specific programs have been de
vised for each quarter of Lantana's
one-unit seminar. Pitkin and Sock
ness outlined these initiatives and
described their contribution to the
residence's academic theme.
"Priority residents will partici
pate in a weekly, one-unit seminar
on the place of the humanities at
Stanford and in the wider culture in
the fall quarter," they wrote. "In the

winter and spring quarters, each
resident will share his or her partic
ular interests and passions by or
ganizing or helping to organize two
humanities-related projects, pre
sentations or workshops for fellow
priority residents and the whole
dorm. These might involve short
story and hot chocolate study
breaks; a film and discussion
evening; a series of op-ed pieces
about the humanities posted in the
bathroom stalls and on the dorm
Web site; and presentations of
focus residents' research.There will
also be group outings to campus
lectures and symposia."
While the academic initiatives in
Arroyo and Lantana were devised
independently, the changes are in
dicative of larger shifts in the Uni
versity's residential philosophy.
Students appeared excited of the
new programs. Freshman and
prospective symbolic systems major
Max Kleiman-Weiner described his
enthusiasm.
"I think that the opportunity of
being with many people with similar
interests is appealing," he said."l can
become more aware of different op
portunities in the field, and I think it
would definitely foster some of the
collaborative aspects of symbolic
systems."

small group meetings and collabora
tive project work," he said. "We're
hoping this new enhanced space will
have a very positive impact on the
dorm."
In an interview with The Daily,
Beaver outlined specific programs
that will be featured in Arroyo next
year.
"Programming will include spe
cial events trips, visiting speakers
and in-house one-unit seminars on
general interest topics which pose
enjoyable intellectual challenges re
lated to the dorm focus," he said.
"Seminar topics we're looking at in
clude AI in the movies, computer
game interfaces, how to solve puz
zles and the nature of humor."
While the symbolic systems
major has become increasingly pop
ular on campus among students of
all years, the Mind and Intelligence
Focus has been reserved for upper
class students next year. Beaver
added that the program may expand
in future years depending on its ap
peal.
"The aim was to rebalance the
distribution of upperclassmen in
Wilbur so that the remaining four
class dorms would have a higher per
centage of frosh than has been the
case for the last couple of years," he
said. "Thirty-five to 50 [percent]
frosh seems to be a critical mass. Per
haps a four-class version is some
thing the University might try in the
future. Based on the huge demand
for symbolic systems-related fresh
man seminars, I'm confident that the
interest is there among incoming
freshmen as well."
While the program will be head
ed by Beaver, focus assistants are
needed to coordinate specific activi
ties. He emphasized the need for a
team focus.
"After seven years of RF experi
ence, I know it's vital that we don't
impose too much programming
structure on the new yet-to-be-hired
staff, but rather develop the new pro
gram as a team," he said.
While Arroyo will implement a
symbolic systems theme, Lantana
will highlight the humanities for its
upper-class students. With projects
directed by humanities professors,
the program will look to draw 30 res
idents into the house under special
priority.
Its educational focus will include
English, history, philosophy, reli
gious studies, classics, comparative
literature and modern languages
and literature. Resident Fellows
Barbara Pitkin and Brent Sockness
hope to attract students with com
mon interests in the field.
"We are both professors of Reli
gious Studies with broad interests in
other humanistic disciplines," Pitkin
and Sockness wrote in a joint email
to The Daily. "As professors and aca
demic advisors, we have noticed that
'fuzzy' students can feel intellectual
ly isolated and marginalized at Stan
ford. Since we are passionate about
the liberal arts and the integration of
life and learning that is at the heart
of Residential Education's mission,
we feel that a humanities-theme
dorm will address an unmet need
among Stanford undergraduates
and play to our own strengths and in
terests as members of the University
community."
Specific programs have been de
vised for each quarter of Lantana's
one-unit seminar. Pitkin and Sock
ness outlined these initiatives and
described their contribution to the
residence's academic theme.
"Priority residents will partici
pate in a weekly, one-unit seminar
on the place of the humanities at
Stanford and in the wider culture in
the fall quarter," they wrote. "In the

winter and spring quarters, each
resident will share his or her partic
ular interests and passions by or
ganizing or helping to organize two
humanities-related projects, pre
sentations or workshops for fellow
priority residents and the whole
dorm. These might involve short
story and hot chocolate study
breaks; a film and discussion
evening; a series of op-ed pieces
about the humanities posted in the
bathroom stalls and on the dorm
Web site; and presentations of
focus residents' research.There will
also be group outings to campus
lectures and symposia."
While the academic initiatives in
Arroyo and Lantana were devised
independently, the changes are in
dicative of larger shifts in the Uni
versity's residential philosophy.
Students appeared excited of the
new programs. Freshman and
prospective symbolic systems major
Max Kleiman-Weiner described his
enthusiasm.
"I think that the opportunity of
being with many people with similar
interests is appealing," he said."l can
become more aware of different op
portunities in the field, and I think it
would definitely foster some of the
collaborative aspects of symbolic
systems."
With the I lousing Draw quickly ap
proaching, students will have a wider
variety of rooming options to choose
from. Added to the list of residential
programs will be two new initiatives, as
Wilbur Hall's Arroyo will feature a
symbolic systems focus for its upper
class students and Manzanita Park's
Lantana House will host a one-unit
residential humanities program.
Devised by the resident fellows of
these dorms, the initiatives aim to at
tract upper-class students with similar
academic interests. With University
support from Dean of Student Affairs
Greg Boardman and Vice Provost of
Undergraduate Education John Brav
man, the programs will be implement
ed initially for a trial period, after
which permanent changes may be
made.

Termed the "Mind and Intelligence
Focus," Arroyo's symbolic systems
program looks to draw in a range of
students attracted to the interdiscipli
nary field. As described in a Universi
ty press release, the dorm will offer
residential seminars, guest speakers
and coordinated discussions.
" llie Mind and Intelligence Focus
is intended to be of interest to anyone
who wonders how the mind woiks,
how people behave and communicate
and what the future holds for comput
ers and artificial intelligence," the re
lease noted.
An upgraded multi-media seminar
space will also be featured in Arroyo
to facilitate an understanding of sym
bolic systems material. Residential
Fellow David Beaver endorsed the
new technology and described his
hopes for the program.
"The new multimedia space in
Arroyo is a space where we can show
movies and provide enhanced pre
sentations and is a good space for
small group meetings and collabora
tive project work," he said. "We're
hoping this new enhanced space will
have a very positive impact on the
dorm."
