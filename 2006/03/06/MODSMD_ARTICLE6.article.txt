Law students, professors and com
munity members gathered at Stanford
Law School Saturday night for the !4th
annual "Bid for Justice" auction.
Ihe event, which attracted upwards
of 300 participants and raised more
than $50,000 through sales, was hosted
by the Stanford Public Interest Law
Foundation (SIMI I).
A nonprofit organization, SPILF

was founded in 1978 by law students
and alumni to "support groups that lack
adequate legal representation," accord
ing to the group's Web site.
To that end, SPILF donates money
to help pay a stipend for law students
taking public interest law internships
over the summer which otherwise
would not provide an adequate living
salary, said SPILF President Megan
Nelson, a third-year law student.
"lliat's a huge difference," Nelson
said, "Its a huge contribution for stu
dents to be able to afford food and
housing while working at a public in
terest job."

Students and faculty participate in the 1 4th annual "Bid for Justice" auction at
Stanford Law School on Saturday. The proceeds from this event, which totaled
$50,000, will be used to help pay stipends for law internships.
Pizzo plans to secure resources to
support faculty research; strengthen
the diversity of students, faculty and
staff; foster leadership development
opportunities, especially for women
and minorities; advocate for im
provements in the American health
care system; develop University ini
tiatives in community service and
global health; launch a facilities mas
ter plan that calls for a new Learning
and Knowledge Center and the
Stanford Institutes of Medicine re
search buildings and serve as a
spokesperson for the importance of
science and medicine in society in an
effort to reengage the public trust.
According to Stephen Hunt, a
sixth-year doctoral student in the de
partment of Molecular and Cellular
Physiology and Graduate Student
Council representative for the Med
ical School, Pizzo is highly regarded
by the student body.
"Dr. Pizzo has demonstrated the
strength of leadership to make very
necessary curricular changes and im
prove the visibility and stature of the
Medical School nationwide," said
Hunt, who was first impressed by

Pizzo after learning of the dean's vi
sionary efforts at the National Insti
tutes of Health to study 11IV on pe
diatric populations. "He is one of the
leaders of California's stem-cell ini
tiative, and many students respect
the fact that Dr. Pizzo is not afraid to
take a stand in his principles on the
side of integrity. For example, Dr.
Pizzo has initiated a ban on pharma
ceutical representatives plying their
wares at Stanford. He is also a vocal
advocate of increasing access to
medical care to the poor and unin
sured."
Hunt went on to say that Pizzo is
highly acclaimed for both his scien
tific leadership and clinical acumen.
"My wife, Mana, worked with Dr.
Pizzo for one of the few weeks he is
still has time to attend in Pediatric
Infectious Disease over at Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital," Hunt
continued. "She said his care for both
his patients and students was unpar
alleled."
In his next term. Hunt hopes
Pizzo continues to advocate for
human health worldwide, grow Stan
ford into the premier research insti
tution for stem cell biology, establish
an Environmental Medicine Insti
tute at Stanford and further improve
the evaluation system for clinical ro
tations.
Similarly, another sixth-year

M.D./Ph.D. student, Ryan Louie
praised Pizzo for his work as dean,
especially in the area of translational
medicine research.
"Dean Pizzo has taken the School
of Medicine in new directions, by
bringing together the basic sciences
and clinical medicine for creating
new multi-disciplinary programs,"
Louie said. "He is enthusiastic about
the School of Medicine and the Stan
ford community, and I am happy to
hear of his reappointment as Dean."
Harry Greenberg, senior associ
ate dean for research at the School of
Medicine, noted that Pizzo, who
serves on the board of the California
Institute for Regenerative Medicine,
has made Stanford's School of Med
icine a "national presence."
"Phil is a visionary type of per
son," Greenberg said. "He had a
pretty clear goal when he came here,
and he's pursued it."
David K. Stevenson, senior asso
ciate dean of academic affairs for the
Medical School, stated that one of
Pizzo's major accomplishments was
to better connect the Medical School
with the rest of the University. Pro
jects such as the new Department of
Bioengineering represent Pizzo's ef
forts to create "synergy that ensures,
facilitates and accelerates the kinds
of contributions that Stanford, as
great research University, can make

to a very challenged world," Steven
son said.
"If the medical school is con
cerned about human well-being, it
cannot do so without the expertise
from the diverse fields represented
in the other Schools that make up
this extraordinary place," he said.
Senior Associate Dean for Med
ical Education Julie Parsonnet em
phasized that Pizzo has put students
front and center in all his initiatives.
"Dean Pizzo's regrounding of our
educational mission has enhanced
the culture of the Medical School
and made it a much more exciting
place for faculty and students alike,"
Parsonnet said. "Dean Pizzo is a
marathon runner and his view on
running the school is
'marathonesque.' He takes a long
view of everything we undertake; it is
rare when he is not thinking 10 or 20
years down the line. This strategic
thinking is essential for success of
our programs, given the rapid
changes in biotechnology, research
funding. Medicare, and health care
more generally."
Senior Associate Dean for Clini
cal Affairs Norman Rizk, said he be
lieves that the reappointment of
Pizzo is "essential for continuing the
innovation and vision he has brought
to the Medical School.
"Dean Pizzo's work is well

begun, but still will require years of
follow-through to make Stanford
Medical School the very best," Rizk
said. "I hope that during the next
five years, Dean Pizzo will further
develop the School of Medicine in
stitutes, beginning with the Cancer
and Stem Cell Institute. In addition,
completing the Knowledge and
Learning Center and educational
program revisions while handling
the economic challenges of declin
ing real dollars from National Insti
tute of Health funding and
MediCare will require tenacity and
devotion, all of which we have come

to expect from the deans of Stan
ford's major schools."
Before serving as dean of the
Stanford Medical School, Pizzo was
the head of the infectious disease
division, chief of pediatrics and act
ing scientific director of the Nation
al Cancer Institute's Division of
Clinical Sciences. Pizzo earned his
bachelor's from Fordham Universi
ty and his medical degree from the
University of Rochester School of
Medicine. He is acclaimed for his
significant contributions to the
treatment of children with cancer
and HIV.
