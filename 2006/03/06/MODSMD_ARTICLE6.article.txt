Law students, professors and com
munity members gathered at Stanford
Law School Saturday night for the !4th
annual "Bid for Justice" auction.
Ihe event, which attracted upwards
of 300 participants and raised more
than $50,000 through sales, was hosted
by the Stanford Public Interest Law
Foundation (SIMI I).
A nonprofit organization, SPILF

was founded in 1978 by law students
and alumni to "support groups that lack
adequate legal representation," accord
ing to the group's Web site.
To that end, SPILF donates money
to help pay a stipend for law students
taking public interest law internships
over the summer which otherwise
would not provide an adequate living
salary, said SPILF President Megan
Nelson, a third-year law student.
"lliat's a huge difference," Nelson
said, "Its a huge contribution for stu
dents to be able to afford food and
housing while working at a public in
terest job."
