## New Stanford tree announced Sunday Tree week coordinator discusses tasks carried out by candidates, including written exams 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
After nearly 10 days of tomfool
ery, unlawfulness and general de
bauchery, Ti ee Week concluded early
Sunday morning with the announce
ment that senior Thomas Elwood
Leep will succeed coterminal student
Erin Lashnits as the next manifesta
tion of the Stanford Tree.
"The end of Tree Week is like a
monster truck rally," Lashnits said.
"Some trucks have speed and agility,
some have strength and power. The
winning truck combines all of this
with courage, fortitude and the
biggest wheels you've ever seen to
crush the brains out of the competi
tion. [Tommy's] a gangsta, but he's
still got flavor."
After Band management cut the
field of candidates down to several fi
nalists on Thursday, a few last minute
stunts took place Friday. Freshman
Patrick "Patches" Fortune was bom
barded with hundreds of eggs, and
junior Christina Zempel sported a
bra made entirely out of Laffy-Taffy.
According toTree Week coordina
tor Bryan Schell, a junior, on Satur
day candidates were greeted by an
Eskimo on the corner of Campus
Drive and Mayfield Road, and flown
to a secret island off the coast of Van
couver, Canada.
"At this undisclosed location,
prospective Trees were required to
take a two-part written exam lasting
three hours," Schell said. "They were
then made to watch Broken Flowers'
starring Bill Murray to test their met
tle, while they ran on a treadmill at 35
miles-per-hour. The candidates that

succeeded in this
test were then^

pitted against
each other in an
American Glad-

iator style melee.
Doctors were pres-

ent and helmets were worn for

the safety of all.

"At the end of the night it came
down to two candidates who couldn't
best each other physically: Tommy
Leep and Douglas M. Whitaker,"
Schell continued. "The match up was
resolved by the most mentally inten
sive contest known to mankind, the
paper-rock-scissors contest. Both
candidates threw rock 849 times,
however, in the 850 th round, Douglas
M. Whitaker lost the hand strength to
throw rock and had to go with paper.
Leep threw rock and won because
nothing beats rock. Whitaker was
sent to the hospital."
Some candidates expressed dis
agreement with the final selection,
but all seemed to accept Leep's ap
pointment. Reports have surfaced
that this year's decision was largely
made on the part of Band manage
ment and not the old Tree, as in years
past.
"I have no regrets," said sopho
more Daniel Novinson, managing ed
itor of sports for The Stanford Daily.
"It seems counterintuitive at first, but
I really believe that once 1 soak
everything in, what 1 learned this past
week is going to prepare me for the
rest of my life a whole lot better than
my classes here ever will. 1 ran exact
ly the campaign that I wanted to run,
and I'm sure Tommy will do a great
job."
In his first statement as Tree, Leep
expounded on the experience of be
coming the Band's infamous mascot.
"What's it like to be Tree?" Leep
said. "It's crushing a full, unopened
can of beer with your bare hands. It's
an explosion of guts and glory. There
will be casualties."
