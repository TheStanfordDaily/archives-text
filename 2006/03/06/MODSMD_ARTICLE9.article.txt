# CONSERVATION
## Energy Bowl extends deadline, efforts Brainier and Stern tied for first place in conserving resources 
### KAT LEWIN STAFF WRITER 
Despite the recent cold weather. Students
for a Sustainable Stanford hope that their peers
will turn off the heat and don sweaters until the
end of the quarter. The Second Annual Great
Energy Bowl and Water Derby has been ex
tended through March 20, giving participants
almost three extra weeks to do their part to
conserve water and energy.
According to event organizers, there was a
practical reason for extending the deadline
change.
"The deadline had to be extended because
the energy and water meter readings will come
out later than we had anticipated," said senior
Greg Holburd. "Originally, we had planned on
giving mid-way results around the first week of
February but the readings weren't available
until mid-February. Similarly the next available
reading will be March 20. which is now the end
of the competition."
However, group members acknowledged
that increasing the duration of the Energy Bowl
and Water Derby would also yield greater con
servation.
"The longer we can keep people motivated
to conserve water and energy, the better," said
sophomore Nastassia Patin. "I'm extremely
happy about the extension because now there's
more opportunity to publicize the event and
raise awareness."
Official mid-competition standings are post-

Ed on the Students for a Sustainable Stanford
Web site. Members said they are happy with the
results so far. The competition spans all under
graduate residences, and is divided into two cat
egories — dorms and houses.
Branner and Stern are tied for first place for
dorms, each having decreased combined water
and energy usage 33 percent from this time last
year. Freshman/Sophomore College is in sec
ond place, with a decrease of 26 percent, ac
cording to an email sent by Patin to The Daily.
The decision to extend the Energy Bowl to
houses as well as dorms is a change from last
year,and Sustainable President and event coor
dinator Emma Yuen said she was pleased with
the addition. Yost and Murray currently hold
first place in the category with "an incredible 46
percent decrease." Theta Delta Chi and Syner
gy are in second and third place, with decreases
of 30 percent and 28 percent, respectively.
These numbers represent a significant in
crease in overall conservation over last year —
when the competition was much less expansive,
said Energy Management and Building Re
newal Program Coordinator Larry Hoffman.
"We are expecting to achieve a much greater
savings in electricity and water for this year
compared to last year since we have expanded
the competition to all undergraduate dorms
and houses," Hoffman said.
Yuen estimated that the campus has. on av
erage, shown a 10 percent decrease in energy
use and 15 percent decrease in water consump
tion from this time last year. A few residences,
such as Mirrielees, Kimball and Roth, have in
creased their energy and water consumption
over last year, but some Sustainable group
members said thev are still encouraged by the

overall results.
"There are only a few dorms and houses in
total that have increased energy and water use,
but only by a few percentage points, so that is
promising as well," Hulburd said. "It seems that
the competition has inspired conservation and
wiser resource choices which is the main objec
tive of the Energy Bowl and Water Derby. I
think that this competition has definitely
helped bring the issue of campus sustainability
to students' attention."
One way that Students for a Sustainable
Stanford has attempted to raise awareness
among students is through the competition's
prizes. According to Yuen, all residents of the
winning residence in each category will win T
shirts. In addition, the two winning residences
will have energy-saving technology, like solar
panels or low-flow toilets, installed in their hous
es, courtesy of Student Housing. 1 lowever, Yuen
said the expense of fitting houses with water
and energy-efficient technology is balanced out
by the money saved by the competition.
" ITie Energy Bowl actually saves so much in
energy and water reduction that it saves hous
ing money," she said. "Last year, Student Hous
ing saved around $2,5(X) in water and energy
costs, and that wasjustfora few houses, so that's
how we can afford such nice prizes. The envi
ronmental technology is also a great incentive
for people who already care about the environ
ment: if they conserve a lot this year, they'll re
ceive tools to make it easier to conserve in fu
ture."
The competition ends on March 20. Mid
