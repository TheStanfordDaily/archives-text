a tp he most surprising thing about
America is it is full of Ameri-
JL cans. Everywhere Americans,
Americans, big and white. It is a little
frightening." As I read through my copy
of "Inscrutable Americans" by Anurag
Mathur, I pitied the sufferings of the pro
tagonist finding his way in unfamiliar sur
roundings. Poor guy - had he never
watched American movies?
I — having grown up on a steady diet
of American films — was supposed to be
better armored for the impending "cul
tural shock" when I came to the U.S. For
mulating my theory on movies, I figured
that America was essentially just like
anywhere else in the world, except there
was a lot more kissing and sex.
Now I — and I am sure many others
— consider that as a welcome change. It's
not a mere coincidence that there was a
sudden rise in foreign nationals applying
for student visas after 1999 — the year
"American Pie" was released.
Yes, I had been warned about the lan
guage barrier between English-speaking
Americans and the rest of the English
speaking world. And I quickly learned
that rest isn't what you do in a "rest
room." U's and q's suddenly disappear as
"colour" is spelled "color," "cheque" is
spelled "check" and my research sudden
ly becomes on "say-my-conductors" in
stead of "say-me-conductors." And after
standing for a lifetime in queues, I would
for a change start standing in lines.
There was also some Indianized Eng
lish that I needed to shed, as I realized en
route to San Francisco. When exchanging
phone numbers with a cute girl, give her a
"call" not a "ring," at least not at first. And
unless you have given that ring,don't ever
ask for a "rubber," when all you need is an
"eraser."
As my plane circled above the Bay I
was mentally challenging everyone
below to ask me "Howz it goin?","Was
sup", or "How you doin?" and all the
other mumbo jumbo greetings, as I was
prepared to throw back an appropriate
hogwash response. I was ready, steady
and raring to confront the cultural shock
that everyone promised I would meet.
My shuttle driver's conversation
starter on the way to Stanford was "Are
you an alien?" "Yes, I am an internation
al student," I answered as I passed my
hand over my head to make sure that my
disheveled hair was not giving an impres
sion of alien antennas.
But when he asked "Does your reli
gion allow you to look at girls?" I knew I
was at the right place. Of course my reli
gion allows me to look at, adore, drool at
and fantasize about girls. If it didn't, 1
would have modified it. I reached Stan
ford smiling ear-to-ear.
But, the first few days in America
were the beginning of the end of my
American Dream.This wasn't the Amer
ica I had been preparing myself for. In
the orientation programs on campus, I
shook hands with students of more var
ied nationalities than I knew existed on
earth. It was anything but "full of Amer
icans." A tour of San Francisco showed
that even the richest country in the
world had homeless people shivering in
cold weather.
Thus started my realization of strange
realities of the new world I had gotten
myself into. My classes were — and this
may be only true for grad classes — full
of Asian graduate students - Indian, Chi
nese and Thai. A random walk down
University Avenue would show me why I
— having lived for most of my formative
life in Asia — hadn't had as much Asian
food as I had living in America. It was
wonderfully surprising to see the diverse
Asian traditions being acknowledged
and celebrated. It's one thing to hear of
the benefits of cultural diversity, and
quite another to actually live through
and experience the breadth it brings to
one's life.
As the old story goes, some 500 years
ago Christopher Columbus set out to find
a sea route to Asia and ended up discov
ering America. I set out to find America
and ended up discovering Asia.
