## AND TE.... Nominations FOR THE GORE'S AWARD ARE... "When they emailed me to say that Hennessy wanted to have a little chat with me, I just figured I had too many parking tickets." VIRGINIA MATZEK, Gores Award Recipient 
### FRANCOIS JEAN-BAPTISTE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
112 v€r wonder what incentives TAs have to do
a good job? For starters, each spring the
hard work and dedication of at least one
teaching assistant (TA), or teaching fellow
V (TF), pays of handsomely. The Walter J.
Gores Awards, which are unequivocally the highest
honor for excellence in undergraduate and graduate
teaching, are also given to a senior and junior faculty
member.
Any member of the Stanford community, including
students, may nominate someone for the Gores Award.
Gores Award recipient Virginia Matzek, a doctoral
student in biological sciences, was one of two TAs who
received the honor last year. She described the ac
knowledgment as extremely flattering.
"I felt tremendously honored to win the award last
year and very grateful for the recognition," Matzek
says. "It's also really fun because the nomination
process is a secret,and then you get called into the pres
ident's office to get the award as a surprise. When they
emailed me to say that Hennessy wanted to have a lit
tle chat with me, I just figured I had too many parking
tickets."
While her account is rather modest, the reasons why
she won are no simple matter.
"Matzek was cited for exemplary work as a gradu

ate teaching consultant, contributing to a wide range of
services for other teaching assistants to help them im
prove as teachers," according to the Stanford News
Service. "For developing and teaching the popular and
highly regarded class. Restoration Ecology, while
maintaining a full research program for her doctorate;
for being an exceptionally charismatic teacher and a
wonderful colleague; and for her deep engagement and
tireless efforts on behalf of students that have set a new
standard for excellence in teaching at Stanford."
High honors aside, Matzek said one advantage to
receiving the Gores Award was her unique vantage
point at last year's Commencement ceremony.
"Another side benefit is that you get to watch Com
mencement from on the stage, behind the commence
ment speakers, while everyone else roasts in the sun at
Stanford Stadium," she said.
In terms of what the selection committee is looking
for in TAs, 1999 Gores recipient Rebecca Whelan, who
was a doctoral student in chemistry, says she has a rea
sonably good idea.
"If I had to guess, I think that demonstration of ef
fectiveness as a teacher along with significant innova
tion make a favorable impression," says Whelan. "In
my case, I was recognized for my work with the Chem
istry Department's writing-intensive course, which was

RYAN NOON/The Stanford Daily

also a very rigorous lab course. As head TA, I devel
oped a new writing curriculum and also worked to re
vamp the lab curriculum."
Last, but not least, winners of the Gores Awards re
ceive a substantial cash prize, which Whelan describes
as "quite generous."
She is now an assistant professor of chemistry at
Oberlin College in Ohio.
The first TA to receive the award was James F. Dice,
who is now a professor of physiology at TUfts Universi
ty. Secretary of State and former Stanford Provost
Condoleezza Rice was also a recipient of the Gores
Award in 1984. At the time, she was an assistant profes
sor of political science.
Walter J. Gores. Class of 1917, served as a professor
of design at the school of architecture at the Universi
ty of Michigan, where he taught for over 30 years. The
Walter J. Gores Awards for Excellence in Undergradu
ate and Graduate Teaching was established in 1971 by
request of his estate.
In order to be considered for this year's awards,
nominations should be sent to the Office of the Regis
trar via letter to the Subcommittee on University Hon
ors or an email sent to Academic Committee Coordi
nator Lindi Press (lindi.press@stanford.edu). Nomina
tions must be received by Friday, April 7.
