# GSC kicks off recruitment for spring election
## 
### MIMA MOHAMMED DESK EDITOR 
This year's ASSU elections are rapidly ap
proaching, slated for April 12 and 13. Gradu
ate Student Council candidates do not need to
petition for signatures. Candidates simply
need to file a declaration of intent online at
the elections Web site: http://elections.stan
ford.edu.
In order to get out the word about elec
tions, an extra Grad Night at Flicks will be
shown on March 12, for Walk the Line. 'Vote
for GSC' chapsticks will be given out, along
with donuts and juice.
"There are giveaway items that have Run
for GSC' printed on them," says GSC Co-chair
Thomas Lee, a fourth-year graduate student in
electrical engineering. "We will also be conduct
ing an extensive email and flyering campaign."
Many members of the GSC encourage
their fellow graduate students to run, empha
sizing that campaign efforts will not greatly af
fect their academic commitments. TTiese cam
paigns, according to some GSC members, are
not as intense as in the undergraduate races.
"It doesn't take much to run, and cam
paigning is relatively light when compared

with the Undergraduate Senate," Lee says.
"I would highly encourage all graduate
students to get involved with advocacy, pro
gramming and student group funding efforts
of the Graduate Student Council, regardless
of whether they decide to run for office" says
GSC Co-chair Jenny Allen, a second-year law
student. "Many of the GSC's most active
members are not elected representatives, they
are people who actively work on behalf of the
GSC and really have a heart for serving the
graduate student community."
Elections Commissioner Tim Sanders is
working hard to get the elections underway,
including advertising efforts. Those involved
with the Elections Commission will be mak
ing personal trips to visit graduate depart
ments that are not yet represented on the list
of the declared candidates, to appeal students
to run for office.
"We are doing quite a bit to get grads in
volved and to recruit GSC candidates," says
Sanders, a second year law student. "We have
been promoting the elections at the 750 Pub
on Grad Nights and Comedy Nights and will
continue to do so. In addition, we held two of
the candidate info sessions at the GCC in
order to make them more accessible to grad

students."
Several members of the GSC say that their ex
perience has been rewarding and empowering.
"My favorite Stanford memories and clos
est friends have resulted from my involve
ment with the Graduate Student Council,"
Allen says."I became involved with the GSC
during my very first week on campus and
loved planning campus-wide events, including
the Graduate Community Center grand
opening party and working on tax relief for
graduate students on the legislative action
committee."
"The thing I've enjoyed most [about GSC]
is working together with other grad students,"
Lee says."The GSC is a very dedicated group,
and we've made tremendous accomplish
ments this year."
Concerning this year's upcoming election,
GSC members had a lot to say.
"It is an exciting time to be part of the
Graduate Student Council, especially be
cause of the new vice provost of graduate ed
ucation and other recommendations of the
Commission on Graduate Education," Allen
says. "Graduate students who have creative
ideas to improve graduate life at Stanford
have an unparalleled opportunity to leave a

legacy at this University."
"It is of vital importance that graduate stu
dents vote this year — there are several issues
on the ballot that will affect them directly,"
Lee says. "These include a new general fee for
grad-specific transportation programs and in
creased funding for student groups. If grad
students do not come out to vote, then they
will lose out on these important services."
"I think the best part of the GSC experi
ence is being able to serve students. I've start
ed cooking classes — along with the help of
TVacy Terry — as part of our graduate student
cross-interaction initiatives, and students real
ly enjoy them," says Maria Spletter, a gradu
ate student in biological sciences and a mem
ber of the GSC. "It is nice to get grad students
together from multiple departments in an in
formal setting where they can get to know
each other and do something fun."
Spletter also notes the friendly relation
ship between the GSC and University admin
istration.
"If you have an advocacy issue, this is the
organization to work through to really talk to
important people at the University who can
help you achieve your goals, whatever they
may be," she says.
