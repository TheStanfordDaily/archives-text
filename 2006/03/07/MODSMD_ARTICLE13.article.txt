## Editorial Why Stanford students must request a regrade 
### 
At the end of each quarter, students
anxiously await their moment of
reckoning as finals week approaches.
Our labors will be judged worthy or unwor
thy based on letter grades assigned by our
professors. Yet the entire grading process
feels somewhat arbitrary, and this ambiguity
only leads to greater anxiety.
In an ideal world, grades should reflect
how well we comprehend the material and
how much effort we put into it. Of course,
they aren't going to be perfect yardsticks.
And we're always going to glare at that kid
next to us who seems to be effortlessly
pulling KM) percents on the weekly quizzes
only to complain about the one time that he
got a point knocked off.
But grading systems should be designed
to maximize fairness. One basic principle of
grading is that students should be evaluated
against objective standards like the material,
rather than, say, the performance of their fel
low students.
Many professors, unfortunately, don't
seem to abide by this principle. Some of the
most egregious offenders are those who de
sign systems where a large but arbitrary pro
portion of students will get B's. Scales like
this do not rank students relative to the ma
terial, but instead relative to each other.
This is blatantly unfair. If the students in
any given class are especially good, then the
professor should be able to reward their ef
forts. If they are especially bad, the professor
should be able to make that point too.
Also, by removing objectivity from stan
dards of grading and merely ranking stu
dents against each other, the professor en
sures that one student's A or B will only be
earned at the expense of another's. Is this the
policy that we want â€” so that whenever fel
low students ask us for help, we know that by
helping them, we are hurting ourselves?
Given that incentives affect behavior, do we
want to encourage students to collaborate

with one another or fight for a limited num
bers of A's and B's?
Moreover, trying to fit each and every
class into a predetermined number of A's
and B's discourages exceptional teaching
and encourages mediocrity. Professors are
going to have to assign the same grades no
matter how well they teach and how well stu
dents understand the material. In turn,
mediocre teaching will lead to mediocre stu
dents who understand less of the material
and get lower grades. Departments may then
be tempted to make grading policies even
more inflexible, feeding a vicious cycle.
Professors need to do more to address
the needless and unproductive anxiety sur
rounding grading policies. First, they should
clearly state their goals and expectations
for the class at the start of the quarter and
ensure that students are evaluated accord
ing to those goals. Also, they should encour
age collaborative work wherever possible
and assure students that teamwork will
never be punished with a lower grade. Such
measures would go a long way to ensure
that students remain engaged with class
material and not become obsessed with
their final grades.
Grading policies should not promote a
zero-sum situation where one student's gain
is another's loss. Instead, such policies
should encourage students to work together
and help each other out when difficulties are
encountered. In fact, more inspired grading
policies could even encourage healthy com
petition. Applying oneself to the material
and trying to understand it better is a healthy
pursuit, but the higher grade gained from
such an exercise should not be to the detri
ment of one's peers.
When students come to Stanford, they
hope to leave a dog-eat-dog environment
behind in high school and pursue the joys of
true learning for learning's sake. We should
n't disappoint them.
