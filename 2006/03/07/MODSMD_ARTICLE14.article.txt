# Screwed over

There's a strange phenomenon sweep
ing Stanford's campus these days.
That's right: people are actually asking
each other out on dates. Yes, it's that time of
year when many freshmen begin to realize
that the person who lives down the hall real
ly isn't as cute as they thought during NSO.so
frosh dorms take pity on their residents and
their diminishing social lives and decide to
host Screw Your Roommate parties so they
can boost their hookup numbers to pre
"Freshman 15" levels.
Screw Your Roommate is a peculiar event.
If all goes well, it can foster great inter-dorm
friendships (and possibly more, for those who
are lucky enough to have roommates with es
pecially good taste). But,for every positive po
tentiality, there are a dozen opportunities for
things to take a turn for the worst.
Obviously, all the dangers inherent in
going on a blind date are unavoidable if your
roommate sets you up with somebody
you've never met. No matter how nice that
person seems, in the back of your mind
lingers the possibility that your date is actu
ally an axe-murderer who has recently es
caped from San Quentin. (You're not fooled
by those khakis and bright pink polo shirt.)
But the winter has been lonely for you, so
you ask your roommate to find you a date
anyway — under the strict qualifications that
the chosen person is cute, smart, nice and not
a prison escapee. However, since the average
freshman's social network outside of the
dorm tends to be limited to a few kids from I-
Hum section and a friend from high school,

you will likely have to settle for somebody
who is lacking one or more of these qualifica
tions. (Cuteness, of course, is non-negotiable.)
Still, randomness is often the best way to
go. Imagine that you know exactly who you
want to go with. Or, better yet. imagine that
you know exactly who you want to marry and
have two-and-a-half kids and a white picket
fence with — but in the meantime you'll settle
for a Screw Your Roommate date. At first,
your roommate is ecstatic, thinking: "Good, I
can just ask that person and. instead of search
ing for a suitable date for my roomie, I can
spend all that time tagging my photos on Face
book." It seems like the perfect solution for
everyone — until you consider the conversa
tion that will ensue when your roommate talks
to your potential date/future spouse: "Hi, you
don't know me, but my roommate is obsessed
with you and talks about you all the time and
really really wants to ask you out." Not exact
ly the smooth approach you had hoped for.
So you accept your random date. You
then proceed to dress up for this person with
whom you are less than pleased but want to
impress anyway because it is the closest you
have come to finding true love since you
stepped on campus.
