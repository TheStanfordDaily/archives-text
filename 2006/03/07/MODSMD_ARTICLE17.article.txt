# Fraternities and sororities: It's all Greek to me
## 
### 
The concept of the Greek system is very
confusing to me. It's not that I have a
problem with fraternities or sororities,
although I do think they are an interesting
example of social institutions that are de
fined by exclusivity rather than commitment
to any sort of external object or goal. But 1
don't have a problem with any of that busi
ness. I am just as committed to the formation
of arbitrary social circles as the next person.
The only thing that I don't get is why these
organizations are considered Greek.
Certainly fraternities and sororities in
clude some Greek people, but by no means
are they exclusive to people of that noble na
tion. It's not as if they're set up to valorize the
values of Greco-Roman civilization either.
I"he quintessential representative of fraterni
ty life, the legendary John Belushi. was Ital
ian, which is about as far from Greek as what
ever Google Maps tells me is the distance be
tween Italy and Greece.
On the surface, using Greek letters for the
name of your organization seems mysteri
ously cool, as if you were some sort of secret
society with your own exclusive tree house
guarded by a stuffed tiger who would make
potential visitors recite delightfully frivolous
poems about the proper way to get rid of
slimy girls. But when you really think about
it, the practice of naming clubs after random
letters from the language of an ancient civi
lization actually presents a number of serious
problems.
For one thing, it's hard as hell to tell all the
fraternities and sororities apart. No one real
ly knows what Greek letters look like, so try
ing to find a party on campus can get really
confusing when you're trying to figure out
whether you're in front of Sigma Nu or
Sigma Chi. If it weren't for handy puns and
mnemonic devices like Theta Delta Airlines
and Sexual Assault Expected. 1 would never
be able to remember the names of half the

Greek organizations on campus. Even then, I
often confuse Theta Delta Chi with Kappa
Alpha Theta, since everyone just refers to
both as Theta; and Sigma Phi Epsilon with
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, since the label SigEp
could apply to both.
To top it off. these names mean absolutely
nothing. I imagine that the very first fraterni
ty brothers picked their name out during a
bar game of darts in which a chart of ancient
Greek letters replaced the dartboard. In gen
eral, it would be a lot easier if Greek organi
zations had more descriptive names to help
students figure out what they're all about. For
example. Phi Psi could be called "Geekland,"
Kappa Sig could be called "Stonerdom,"
Sigma Nu could be called "The Good Guys"
and SAE could be called "Therapists."
Greek societies with ethnic interests are
even more confounding. I don't really under
stand how the members of Lambda Phi Ep
silon are Greek in any way. Do they eat
Greek pizza or something? Maybe they prac
tice culinary fusion by cooking Greek dishes
in an Asian style — in which case I would
love to join them. Or maybe they feature
Asian men posing nude like statues of Greek
gods — in which case they should be banned
from campus forever. What about Jewish
frats like Alpha Epsilon Pi? I'd expect that
it's sacrilegious on some level to name a Jew
ish organization after a culture with pagan
and polytheistic religious beliefs.
What's really disconcerting, though, is the

thought of what will happen when all the pos
sible two-letter and three-letter combina
tions of Greek letters have been used up.
What will fraternities and sororities do then?
Will they extend to four-letter combinations
with such monstrosities as Alpha Chi Omega
Kappa? Perhaps children will learn the vari
ous types of numerical prefixes by learning
how to distinguish between TriDelt, Quad-
Delt and PentaDelt. But even then, the
propensity to abbreviate Greek names will
lead to confusion. Pi Phi could refer to either
Pi Beta Phi or Pi Beta Kappa Phi or Pi Beta
Kappa Alpha Delta Delta Delta Theta Om
nicron Zeus Hermes Mynameischarlottes
immons Mightymorphingpowerrangers
Nowwerereallyrunningoutofideas Phi. The
potential chaos is devastating.
Sometimes, when I lie awake in the wee
hours of the night, I get really frightened
about the possibility of some Greek people
getting together and starting an actual
Greek-interest fraternity. The very social
scene as we know it might fracture to an ir
reparable degree, because no one would un
derstand what you were talking about when
you talked about the Greeks. But then I think
back to my long history of interaction with
Greek people — which mostly comes from
watching the movie "My Big Fat Greek Wed
ding" — and I realize that Greek-interest
fraternities would just involve some gather
ing of fat, swarthy people who drink a lot and
scream loudly at random moments. Nothing
too different from the current scene. And I
am able to fall asleep with a smile upon my
glowing face.

McCurdy a shout-out until he had to judge a

okay, Sini Matikainen suffered in solidarity

ness. I am just as committed to the formation
of arbitrary social circles as the next person.
The only thing that I don't get is why these
organizations are considered Greek.
Certainly fraternities and sororities in
clude some Greek people, but by no means
are they exclusive to people of that noble na
tion. It's not as if they're set up to valorize the
values of Greco-Roman civilization either.
I"he quintessential representative of fraterni
ty life, the legendary John Belushi. was Ital
ian, which is about as far from Greek as what
ever Google Maps tells me is the distance be
tween Italy and Greece.
On the surface, using Greek letters for the
name of your organization seems mysteri
ously cool, as if you were some sort of secret
society with your own exclusive tree house
guarded by a stuffed tiger who would make
potential visitors recite delightfully frivolous
poems about the proper way to get rid of
slimy girls. But when you really think about
it, the practice of naming clubs after random
letters from the language of an ancient civi
lization actually presents a number of serious
problems.
For one thing, it's hard as hell to tell all the
fraternities and sororities apart. No one real
ly knows what Greek letters look like, so try
ing to find a party on campus can get really
confusing when you're trying to figure out
whether you're in front of Sigma Nu or
Sigma Chi. If it weren't for handy puns and
mnemonic devices like Theta Delta Airlines
and Sexual Assault Expected. 1 would never
be able to remember the names of half the

Greek organizations on campus. Even then, I
often confuse Theta Delta Chi with Kappa
Alpha Theta, since everyone just refers to
both as Theta; and Sigma Phi Epsilon with
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, since the label SigEp
could apply to both.
To top it off. these names mean absolutely
nothing. I imagine that the very first fraterni
ty brothers picked their name out during a
bar game of darts in which a chart of ancient
Greek letters replaced the dartboard. In gen
eral, it would be a lot easier if Greek organi
zations had more descriptive names to help
students figure out what they're all about. For
example. Phi Psi could be called "Geekland,"
Kappa Sig could be called "Stonerdom,"
Sigma Nu could be called "The Good Guys"
and SAE could be called "Therapists."
Greek societies with ethnic interests are
even more confounding. I don't really under
stand how the members of Lambda Phi Ep
silon are Greek in any way. Do they eat
Greek pizza or something? Maybe they prac
tice culinary fusion by cooking Greek dishes
in an Asian style — in which case I would
love to join them. Or maybe they feature
Asian men posing nude like statues of Greek
gods — in which case they should be banned
from campus forever. What about Jewish
frats like Alpha Epsilon Pi? I'd expect that
it's sacrilegious on some level to name a Jew
ish organization after a culture with pagan
and polytheistic religious beliefs.
What's really disconcerting, though, is the

thought of what will happen when all the pos
sible two-letter and three-letter combina
tions of Greek letters have been used up.
What will fraternities and sororities do then?
Will they extend to four-letter combinations
with such monstrosities as Alpha Chi Omega
Kappa? Perhaps children will learn the vari
ous types of numerical prefixes by learning
how to distinguish between TriDelt, Quad-
Delt and PentaDelt. But even then, the
propensity to abbreviate Greek names will
lead to confusion. Pi Phi could refer to either
Pi Beta Phi or Pi Beta Kappa Phi or Pi Beta
Kappa Alpha Delta Delta Delta Theta Om

potential chaos is devastating.
Sometimes, when I lie awake in the wee
hours of the night, I get really frightened
about the possibility of some Greek people
getting together and starting an actual
Greek-interest fraternity. The very social
scene as we know it might fracture to an ir
reparable degree, because no one would un
derstand what you were talking about when
you talked about the Greeks. But then I think
back to my long history of interaction with
Greek people — which mostly comes from
watching the movie "My Big Fat Greek Wed
ding" — and I realize that Greek-interest
fraternities would just involve some gather
ing of fat, swarthy people who drink a lot and
scream loudly at random moments. Nothing
too different from the current scene. And I
am able to fall asleep with a smile upon my
glowing face.

okay, Sini Matikainen suffered in solidarity
