## Port security cannot be jeopardized 
### PETER CHANG 
Much of the current debate in the
media over the Dubai port deal is
oddly misguided. Supporters of the
Dubai takeover contend that critics
of the transfer are xenophobic igno
ramuses who cannot comprehend
the idea that port security in Ameri
ca is managed by the U.S. Coast
Guard. They argue that the authori
ties who dictate what comes over on
the boat is irrelevant so long as
Americans are in charge of deter
mining which shipments are allowed
within our borders. To some extent,
this may be true; there are some indi
viduals out there who unilaterally
paint the UAE as a terrorist Arab
country and make blanket state
ments about Bush's weak stance on
national security in an attempt to
score political points.

But there is one key assumption
that supporters of the Dubai deal
make and which is deeply troubling:
they assume that the U.S. Coast
Guard does a wonderful job of secur
ing our ports. This simply isn't true.
The Bush administration has in
vested relatively little in protecting
our ports. The Coast Guard has esti
mated that port facilities would need
to spend at least $5.4 billion in the
next decade to improve security.
Since 2002, the administration's Port
Security Grant program has allocat
ed about $708 million even though
port officials have requested more
than $3 billion.
Historically, at least, the federal
government has drastically under
funded this initiative. What is the
amount in President Bush's pro
posed budget for the coming year
dedicated to port security grants?

Well. it's a difficult question to an
swer, because the President wants to
fold his Port Security Grant pro
gram, which was established in 2(X)2,
into the DHS's Targeted Infrastruc
ture Protection (TIP) program.
Officials from the American As
sociation of Port Authorities
(AAPA), which represents SO US.
ports, said that this consolidation
would force ports to compete against
other transit systems, such as buses
or rail, for funds. So it's likely that the
inadequate funding that port securi
ty already has will be diminished
even further.
Moreover, many ports are still op
erating without vital radiation detec
tors, and those that are don't have
the fortune of using machines that
work very well.
According to a recent article in
the New York Times, the United
States has spent about $1.6 billion on
security since Sep. 11. but only about
a third of the 600 monitors needed
nationwide have been installed. As a
result, only 37 percent of shipped
goods are checked for a dirty bomb
or other nuclear device.
Additionally, the selection proce
dure for screening cargo is rather ar
bitrary, incomplete, and frequently
inaccurate. Robert Bonner, commis
sioner of U.S. Customs and Border
Protection, told a Senate subcom
mittee on homeland security in 2005
that the first set of radiation detec

tion devices installed in May 2000
had picked up over 10,(XX) radiation
hits in vehicles or cargo shipments
entering the country in those 5 years.
All were false positives. Perhaps this
number does not seem like much,
but the fear is that a security official,
having seen a thousand false posi
tives already, will simply overlook
the 10.001st hit. which happens to be
an actual WMD. Not to mention the
fact that the devices often fail to pick
up uranium, a key ingredient in nu
clear weapons and a substance very
difficult to detect when shielded by
layers of metal.
In the Times article, Stephen E.
Flynn, a retired Coast Guard com
mander. said that "port security today
is still a house of cards. For each of
these programs, the bar is not very
high and there is very little in the way
of verification. ITie result is it is not

much of an effective deterrent."
I don't mean to suggest that we
need not be concerned about the
overly protectionist and anti-Arab
reaction to this port deal. But this
debate "misses the boat," so to
speak. When we are in no way cer
tain of our own port security it real
ly becomes a matter of luck, and not
strategic planning and prepared
ness, that we haven't been hit with a
dirty bomb already. And that gives
us all the more reason to be con
cerned about a Dubai-based com
pany managing an American port,
because when one's own borders
are so porous, even the slightest in
crease in the possibility of an attack
can make a vital difference.
