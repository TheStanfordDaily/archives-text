## Port security cannot be jeopardized 
### PETER CHANG 
Much of the current debate in the
media over the Dubai port deal is
oddly misguided. Supporters of the
Dubai takeover contend that critics
of the transfer are xenophobic igno
ramuses who cannot comprehend
the idea that port security in Ameri
ca is managed by the U.S. Coast
Guard. They argue that the authori
ties who dictate what comes over on
the boat is irrelevant so long as
Americans are in charge of deter
mining which shipments are allowed
within our borders. To some extent,
this may be true; there are some indi
viduals out there who unilaterally
paint the UAE as a terrorist Arab
country and make blanket state
ments about Bush's weak stance on
national security in an attempt to
score political points.

But there is one key assumption
that supporters of the Dubai deal
make and which is deeply troubling:
they assume that the U.S. Coast
Guard does a wonderful job of secur
ing our ports. This simply isn't true.
The Bush administration has in
vested relatively little in protecting
our ports. The Coast Guard has esti
mated that port facilities would need
to spend at least $5.4 billion in the
next decade to improve security.
Since 2002, the administration's Port
Security Grant program has allocat
ed about $708 million even though
port officials have requested more
than $3 billion.
Historically, at least, the federal
government has drastically under
funded this initiative. What is the
amount in President Bush's pro
posed budget for the coming year
dedicated to port security grants?

Well. it's a difficult question to an
swer, because the President wants to
fold his Port Security Grant pro
gram, which was established in 2(X)2,
into the DHS's Targeted Infrastruc
ture Protection (TIP) program.
Officials from the American As
sociation of Port Authorities

ports, said that this consolidation
would force ports to compete against
other transit systems, such as buses
or rail, for funds. So it's likely that the
inadequate funding that port securi
ty already has will be diminished
even further.
Moreover, many ports are still op
erating without vital radiation detec
tors, and those that are don't have
the fortune of using machines that
work very well.
