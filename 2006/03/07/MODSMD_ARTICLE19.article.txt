Current systems of whistle
blowing are effective
Last Thursday's editorial ("Blow
ing the whistle on animal experimen
tation," Mar. 2) suggests that self
policing and whistleblowing are inef
fective and that violations are easily
overlooked. It argues that whistle
blowing, in particular, is ineffective
and suggests that the public's confi
dence in scientists has been shaken
by the scandal surrounding cloning
by a South Korean scientist. Hwang
Woo-suk, and therefore, requires
more transparency. Moreover, it im
pugns the integrity and courage of
Stanford's faculty, post-docs, stu
dents and staff by characterizing
them as unwilling to be "whistle
blowers." This is simply not the case.
Contrary to allegations in this ed
itorial, whistleblowing, and the abili
ty to do so anonymously, was pre
cisely how the fraud perpetrated by
the South Korean scientist was re
vealed — his junior and senior col
leagues reported his fraud. Experi

ence shows that whistleblowing in
the protection of research animals is
also effective, and people at Stan
ford know how to do this.The impor
tance of reporting problems ob
served in animal research — and the
assurance of anonymity and protec
tion of the whistle blower — is em
phasized in the training required of
individuals who work with animals
at Stanford. Signs are posted
throughout the animal facilities to
ensure that individuals with con
cerns about animal use know whom
to contact and how to contact them.
The signs specifically state that re
ports can be made anonymously di
rectly to the Administrative Panel
on Laboratory Animal Care
(A PL AC) or to the Veterinary Ser
vice Center (VSC). All such reports
— and reports are made — are thor
oughly investigated by the APLAC
and the VSC.
Often, there is simply a misunder
standing of what an individual ob
served. For example, depending on
the anesthetic used, an anesthetized

animal may have its eyes open and
make spontaneous movements, so
that a passerby might think it was not
anesthetized, even when the animal
was anesthetized to a depth appro
priate for surgery and was insensitive
to pain. This editorial seriously un
derestimates scientists', students'
and staff's concerns for animal wel
fare or their ability and willingness to
report events which might indicate
lapses in animal care.
The editorial suggests that Stan
ford's APLAC needs to improve the
perception of animal experimentation
on campus. Whose perception really
needs correction? For more than 15
years Stanford's animal care program
has pursued policies that enable indi
viduals who wish to learn about our
program to do so; the VSC provides a
significant number of tours for indi
viduals ranging from scientists, stu
dents, senior citizens and animal ac
tivists. We are proud of the way Stan
ford cares for its research animals.
