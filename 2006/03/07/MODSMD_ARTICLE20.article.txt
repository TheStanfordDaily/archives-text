## Printers will see double 
### KATHERINE COX STAFF WRITER 
If Residential Computing's new print
ing policy proves effective, more students
will be flipping through double-sided slide
print-outs in lecture next quarter.
ResComp, a division of Stanford Acade
mic Computing, will implement duplex.or
double-sided printing, as the default set
ting in all residential printers as well as
those at Meyer Library and TYesidder
Union.
A change in the price of color printing
will accompany the duplex policy. Spring
quarter, students will face a 10-cent
charge per page, same as the grayscale
price, instead of the current color printing
charge of 50 cents per page.
Surajit A. Bose, ResComp's Cluster
Operations Manager, said the switch to
duplex printing was motivated by envi
ronmental consciousness. ResComp's
central staff was initially approached by
members of Students for a Sustainable
Stanford (SSS) with the idea.
Emma Yuen, president of the student
group,said they developed the proposal in
response to meetings with Stanford Pro
curement — the University's buyer and
distributor of materials — and the Uni
versity Architect/Planning Office that oc
curred in the spring of last year.
"The meetings resulted in an initiative
to reduce the paper used in the massive
amount of printing on campus," Yuen
said. She and others then spoke with
ResComp to generate ideas about how to
get students to utilize duplex printing as
their primary print format.
After a few conversations with SSS,
Bose and other staff members decided the
change to a duplex default setting was a
good idea.
"We feel that a lot of Stanford students
would print double-sided if it were made
easier, or if it was an automatic setting, es
pecially because much of what students
print are drafts, .pdfs, lecture slides and
graphs," he said.

This aspect of the new policy will be
easily executed because last year
ResComp installed "duplexers," the hard
ware necessary for bulk double-sided
printing, in each residential printer, Iliis
year, duplex printing became a standard
option in Meyer and Tresidder printing
kiosks.To designate duplex printing as the
default mode. ResComp must now simply
change the print software's settings. Stu
dents will still have the option to print sin
gle-sided documents; although, as of next
quarter, they must specify whether they
wish to do so before printing.
Some Green Library printers will not
be affected by the change because they
are not capable of printing double-sided
pages and because they are not managed
by ResComp. said Robert Smith, a com
puting info systems analyst for Stanford
University Libraries tech support.
Bose hopes that this simple alteration
will have a significant impact on the
amount of paper used by students printing
in residential computer clusters.
ResComp, which is also responsible for
stocking clusters with printer paper and
toner, will monitor the effects of the poli
cy.
"We will be keeping an eye on how
much paper is used over the next few
quarters," Bose said. "If we buy half as
much paper, or two-thirds of what we
were buying before, then it might allow us
to charge less for printing."

According to Bose, Residential Com
puting sets prices according to the cost of
servicing the printers.
"Our print accounting system is not
based on turning a profit. What we charge
is for replacement costs: paper, toner and
the printers themselves, in addition to the
cost of software development," he said.
Yuen suggested that the duplex print
policy is central to a larger campaign cur
rently spearheaded by her group. Stan
ford Procurement has committed
to the effort, in which SSS will work with
ResComp to publicize the importance of
duplex printing to Stanford students.
Yuen said she designed the fliers posted in
each residential computer cluster that
outline the positive ramifications of dou
ble-sided printing. She explained that
"SSS is still going through ideas" as to how
to best advocate the practice and make
use of the campaign funds.
ITie smaller price of color printing that
will debut next quarter will be implement
ed for technical reasons as well. Only 15 of
the campus' 77 residences are equipped
with color printers. In most of these clus
ters, students may currently choose be
tween printing on a black and white print
er for the lower rate or printing on a color
printer for 50 cents per page.
Bose explained, however, that as
ResComp moves toward supplanting
both printers in such clusters with a single
color nrinter. charyinc a flat rate for both

types of printing makes more sense.
"The color printer has four ink car
tridges. one of which is black ink. Hie
toner for each cartridge costs the same.
But since students print in black and white
more often, and they're printing on this
color printer, we have to change the black
cartridge most frequently," he said,adding
that charging more for color printing is il
logical.
A second reason for the low rate
stemmed from ResComp's inability to
eliminate a loophole in the printing sys
tem that allowed users of residential PCs
to print in color for the 10-cent price.
"We couldn't find a way to solve this
technical problem so we figured, what the
hell," Bose joked.
Color printing at Meyer and Tresidder
will incorporate this new price as well.
Senior Seth Cairo, the Residential
Computing Coordinator at Mars, received
the email ResComp sent RCCs request
ing they notify their residents about the
upcoming changes. Cairo said he had "al
ready counseled residents to use the du
plex option," and that he believed they
would heed his advice.
"About half of our residents use the
cluster for printing purposes" Cairo esti
mated. Although he praised the new
color printing rates. Cairo added that
Mars did not have a color printer, and
speculated that this is the case for most
Row houses.

"We feel that a lot of Stanford students
would print double-sided if it were made
easier, or if it was an automatic setting, es
pecially because much of what students
print are drafts, .pdfs, lecture slides and
graphs," he said.

This aspect of the new policy will be
easily executed because last year
ResComp installed "duplexers," the hard
ware necessary for bulk double-sided
printing, in each residential printer, Iliis
year, duplex printing became a standard
option in Meyer and Tresidder printing
kiosks.To designate duplex printing as the
default mode. ResComp must now simply
change the print software's settings. Stu
dents will still have the option to print sin
gle-sided documents; although, as of next
quarter, they must specify whether they
wish to do so before printing.
Some Green Library printers will not
be affected by the change because they
are not capable of printing double-sided
pages and because they are not managed
by ResComp. said Robert Smith, a com
puting info systems analyst for Stanford
University Libraries tech support.
Bose hopes that this simple alteration
will have a significant impact on the
amount of paper used by students printing
in residential computer clusters.
ResComp, which is also responsible for
stocking clusters with printer paper and
toner, will monitor the effects of the poli
cy.
"We will be keeping an eye on how
much paper is used over the next few
quarters," Bose said. "If we buy half as
much paper, or two-thirds of what we
were buying before, then it might allow us
to charge less for printing."

According to Bose, Residential Com
puting sets prices according to the cost of
servicing the printers.
"Our print accounting system is not
based on turning a profit. What we charge
is for replacement costs: paper, toner and
the printers themselves, in addition to the
cost of software development," he said.
Yuen suggested that the duplex print
policy is central to a larger campaign cur
rently spearheaded by her group. Stan
ford Procurement has committed
to the effort, in which SSS will work with
ResComp to publicize the importance of
duplex printing to Stanford students.
Yuen said she designed the fliers posted in
each residential computer cluster that
outline the positive ramifications of dou
ble-sided printing. She explained that
"SSS is still going through ideas" as to how
to best advocate the practice and make
use of the campaign funds.
ITie smaller price of color printing that
will debut next quarter will be implement
ed for technical reasons as well. Only 15 of
the campus' 77 residences are equipped
with color printers. In most of these clus
ters, students may currently choose be
tween printing on a black and white print
er for the lower rate or printing on a color
printer for 50 cents per page.
Bose explained, however, that as
ResComp moves toward supplanting
both printers in such clusters with a single
color nrinter. charyinc a flat rate for both

types of printing makes more sense.
"The color printer has four ink car
tridges. one of which is black ink. Hie
toner for each cartridge costs the same.
But since students print in black and white
more often, and they're printing on this
color printer, we have to change the black
cartridge most frequently," he said,adding
that charging more for color printing is il
logical.
A second reason for the low rate
stemmed from ResComp's inability to
eliminate a loophole in the printing sys
tem that allowed users of residential PCs
to print in color for the 10-cent price.
"We couldn't find a way to solve this
technical problem so we figured, what the
hell," Bose joked.
Color printing at Meyer and Tresidder
will incorporate this new price as well.
Senior Seth Cairo, the Residential
Computing Coordinator at Mars, received
the email ResComp sent RCCs request
ing they notify their residents about the
upcoming changes. Cairo said he had "al
ready counseled residents to use the du
plex option," and that he believed they
would heed his advice.
"About half of our residents use the
cluster for printing purposes" Cairo esti
mated. Although he praised the new
color printing rates. Cairo added that
Mars did not have a color printer, and
speculated that this is the case for most
Row houses.

Residential Computing plans on implementing several printing changes next quarter. Duplex, or double-sided printing, will become
the default setting in all residential printers as well as those in Meyer Library and Tresidder Union. The price of color printing will fall
to 10 cents per page. The initiative was developed with Students for a Sustainable Stanford.
If Residential Computing's new print
ing policy proves effective, more students
will be flipping through double-sided slide
print-outs in lecture next quarter.
ResComp, a division of Stanford Acade
mic Computing, will implement duplex.or
double-sided printing, as the default set
ting in all residential printers as well as
those at Meyer Library and TYesidder
Union.
A change in the price of color printing
will accompany the duplex policy. Spring
quarter, students will face a 10-cent
charge per page, same as the grayscale
price, instead of the current color printing
charge of 50 cents per page.
Surajit A. Bose, ResComp's Cluster
Operations Manager, said the switch to
duplex printing was motivated by envi
ronmental consciousness. ResComp's
central staff was initially approached by
members of Students for a Sustainable
Stanford (SSS) with the idea.
Emma Yuen, president of the student
group,said they developed the proposal in
response to meetings with Stanford Pro
curement — the University's buyer and
distributor of materials — and the Uni
versity Architect/Planning Office that oc
curred in the spring of last year.
"The meetings resulted in an initiative
to reduce the paper used in the massive
amount of printing on campus," Yuen
said. She and others then spoke with
ResComp to generate ideas about how to
get students to utilize duplex printing as
their primary print format.
After a few conversations with SSS,
Bose and other staff members decided the
change to a duplex default setting was a
good idea.
"We feel that a lot of Stanford students
would print double-sided if it were made
easier, or if it was an automatic setting, es
pecially because much of what students
