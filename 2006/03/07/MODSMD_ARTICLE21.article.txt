## MEN'S BASKETBALL Adams out, duo nabs honors All-Frosh HM Johnson joins First Team Hernandez and Haryasz as Pac-10 honorees 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
Arizona's Adams suspended from
Pac-10 Tourney for DUI arrest
Already coming off an arrest and ci
tation for disturbing the peace in De
cember, Arizona guard Hassan Adams
was arrested, and subsequently sus
pended from the Pac-10 Tournament,
on suspicion of driving under the influ
ence, according to the Associated Press.
Adams, who turned 21 last June,
registered a .124 and then a .121 blood
alcohol level on consecutive Breatha
lyzer tests, or more than 50% over Ari
zona's legal limit of .08. Police original
ly pulled over Adams for speeding
early Sunday morning, but turned to
the Breathalyzer after he appeared vis
ibly drunk.
"I apologize to the team, to the
coaches, the University and the fans for
my violation of a team rule," said
Adams in a release. "I wish the team
well and hope for its success. I'm look
ing forward to participating in the
NCAA Tournament."

Indeed. Arizona Coach Lute Olson,
known for his lax treatment of players,
suspended Adams for just the Pac-10
Tournament — a somewhat meaning
less affair for a squad that has already
punched its ticket to the Big Dance.
The short suspension follows Olson's
decision to play Adams in the after
math of the December incident, which
involved a 2 a.m. party, drinking and
dancing on cars, according to the Asso
ciated Press.
"It's been a difficult year,but it goes
with the territory," Olson said. "There
are some years that everything goes
very smoothly, and some years where
things don't go very smoothly. This
would be one of those years, because of
problems and injuries."
Stanford Coach Trent Johnson
holds his weekly press conference at
11:45 a.m. today.

nament against Stanford Thursday at
