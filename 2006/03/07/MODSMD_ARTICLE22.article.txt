## Men's tennis duos go as deep as semis at PCDC in La Jolt a 
### BEN BACKES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Having performed poorly in doubles play ear
lier in the season, Stanford entered the 117 th Pa
cific Coast Doubles Championship further ham
pered by the absence of two of their top players.
All things considered, the Cardinal would have
been satisfied with just a couple of wins at the
tournament.
But by the end of the weekend, the three dou
bles teams representing the No. 7 Cardinal (6-1)
had surpassed expectations. All three teams ad
vanced to the fourth round, and two of them
reached the semifinals at the tournament held
this weekend at the La Jolla Beach and Tennis
Club in La Jolla, Calif.
Junior James Pade and freshman Blake
Muller, who played their first match together last
week against Brigham Young, were one of the
Stanford teams to reach the semifinals. After win
ning their first four matches in the tournament,
the pair had a 5-0 record in doubles play togeth
er before receiving their first loss in the semifi
nals. Ivor Lovrak and Pedro Rico of Pepperdine
ended Pade and Muller's run, winning in straight
sets, 6-4,7-5.
Although his team advanced deep into the
tournament, Muller would have liked to go even
further.
"I was happy with the way we played and
competed, but whenever you don't win you're al
ways a little disappointed, knowing you could
have done a little better," he said.
Lovrak and Rico, who would go on to win the
tournament, are both nationally ranked singles
players, with Lovrak ranked No. 87 and Rico No.
11. In the quarterfinals, Pade and Muller defeat
ed Shuon Madden and No. 14 Jerry Makowski of
Texas A&M.
Muller enjoyed having the opportunity to
play with his upperclass teammate.
"Playing with James [Pade], he makes it a lot
easier for me and everyone he plays with,"
Muller said. "I love playing with him and think we
play well together. He's able to help me out a lot
and teach me a lot. I'm a freshman and I haven't
played as much, so I think as we play more to
gether we'll continue to improve as a team."
Junior James Wan and senior Jon Wong also
advanced to the semifinals by winning four con
secutive matches. In the quarterfinals, the pair
upset UCLA's Phillip Gruendler and Luben
Pampoulov, 7-6,2-6,7-5. Gruendler, who is a part
of the tenth-ranked Bruins doubles team, won his
doubles match against Stanford when the two
teams played earlier this season in February. In
the semifinals. Wan and Wong dropped a three
set match to Toby Haerle and Robert Searle of
Rice (4-6,7-5,6-1). Searle is No. 52 in the nation
al rankings.
Nevertheless, head coach John Whitlinger
liked what he saw in the doubles pair.
"James [Wan] and Jon [Wong] beat a very
good UCLA team," he said. "That was a great
win by them, and [they] battled in their other
matches as well. It was a great weekend for
them."
Junior David Ryan and freshman Ken Kao
also had a successful tournament, winning two
matches to reach the fourth round before falling
to Lovrak and Rico,6-1,6-0. In the second round,
they defeated Guillame Schils and Lawrence
Wang of Garemont McKenna (6-1,6-7,7-5) be
fore going on to topple Johan Berg and Dejan
Cvetkovic (0-6,6-4,6-2).
"Dave Ryan and Ken Kao beating the No. 1
independent seed [Berg and Cvetkovic] is one of

my highlights of the year," Whitlinger said. "It
was an incredible win by them."
The Cardinal finished with a 10-3 record for
the weekend, an encouraging sign for Whitlinger
and the rest of the coaching staff.
"It gives me and the coaching staff some op
tions down the road," Whitlinger said. "We were

really thrilled with the way we played, and I still
think we can play better. It was very encouraging
as far as doubles goes."
This weekend Stanford heads to Arizona for
its first two road dual matches of the season, fac
ing No. 44 Arizona State (5-4) on Friday and No.
46 Arizona (7-2) on Saturday.
