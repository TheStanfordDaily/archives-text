# WATER POLO
## Women shoot past UCI, LSBU Next for the No. 2 Card: No. 1 Southern California 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
In sports, there generally tend to be
two sure-fire methods for earning a vic
tory — playing overwhelming defense,
or playing overwhelming offense. The
women's water polo team employed
both strategies this weekend.
And sure enough, the squad came
away with commanding wins over No. 13
UC-Irvine and No. 7 Long Beach State,
triumphing by scores of 5-2 and 14-5, re
spectively. Not only did the pair of victo
ries keep the No. 2 Cardinal (11-2, 5-0
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) un
defeated in conference play, but they also
gave the Stanford women critical mo
mentum heading into this Thursday's
showdown against top-ranked Southern
California.
The Cardinal opened their weekend
against a visiting Anteaters squad that
played much more competitively than its
No. 13 ranking suggested.
For the high-powered Stanford of
fense, it wasn't a matter of generating
quality scoring opportunities — it was a
matter of converting them. The Cardinal
fired off an incredible 31 shots in the
game,but Irvine goalie Lauren Machanis
was up to the challenge for almost the en
tire contest, posting a school-record 20
saves.
As the game went into the half, the
Stanford women had managed to build
only a slim 2-1 lead against Machanis and
the relentless Anteaters' defense. At the
same time, though, the Cardinal were
equally stingy in their half of the pool.
And in the second half, the difference
proved to be Stanford's ability to main
tain its stifling defense.
Goals from freshman driver Lolo Sil
ver, senior driver Scotti Shafer and junior
two-meter Christina Hewko in the final
half of play effectively crushed whatever
hopes for an upset Irvine might have
held.The Anteaters were unable to score
until sophomore Nicole Flacco found the
back of the net with 3:22 remaining in the
fourth period. But Cardinal goalie
Meridith McColl and the rest of the Stan
ford defensive corps kept up the pressure
and closed out the 5-2 victory.
"Awareness was the key for us on de
fense against Irvine," senior defender
Laurel Champion said. "We did a great
job of turning our heads, reading players,
and knowing what was going on at differ
ent parts of the front court."
What the Cardinal lacked in offensive
production against the Anteaters they
more than made up for the next after
noon against the 49ers, exploding for
three goals in the opening period of play
and tallying five more in the second. The
Cardinal attackers continued to pummel

the hapless Long Beach defense
even after the halftime break,
cracking the double-digit mark
early in the third period en route
to a spectacular 15 goals.
Silver continued her torrid
scoring pace, recording a hat trick
to push her team leading goal
total to 25. Matching Silvers scor
ing feat was senior two-meter
Nancy El-Sakkary. who effective
ly anchored the Cardinal attack at
set.
"Nancy played great for us
today," Champion said. "She was
strong and solid in front of the
cage."
Junior driver Katie Hansen
and freshman two-meter Jessica
Steffens each also tallied two
goals in the contest. McColl
stonewalled eleven shots, mark
ing her third consecutive game
with at least ten saves.
Similarly balanced offense and
steady defense will be key this
weekend as the Card take on un
defeated Southern California. In
two meetings this season, the
Stanford women have fallen to

USC by narrow margins. The sec
ond of these two losses was partic
ularly hard to swallow for the Car
dinal, who faltered after holding a
3-0 lead early in the game. But this
past weekend's defensive per
formances have given the Stan
ford squad a new air of confidence
heading into their first showdown
with the Women ofTroy in confer
ence play.
"Everyone played really
good one-on-one defense this
weekend, in addition to being
heads up on team defense," jun
ior two-meter defender Alison
Gregorka said. "Everyone was
making quick decisions and fol
lowing through, which is exactly
what needs to be done on de
fense. We are all very excited to
play USC again, and we will be
ready to play them tough on
Thursday."
Champion echoed a similar
sentiment, expressing faith in her
teams preparedness for the up
coming rematch.
"We've taken what we've
learned from the last time we
played them, read over the plays,
and watched the video," the team
captain said. "1 think everyone's
taken something from the last
time we played them, and we're
excited to get another shot."

Stanford women have fallen to

USC by narrow margins. The sec
ond of these two losses was partic
ularly hard to swallow for the Car
dinal, who faltered after holding a
3-0 lead early in the game. But this
past weekend's defensive per
formances have given the Stan
ford squad a new air of confidence
heading into their first showdown
with the Women ofTroy in confer
ence play.
"Everyone played really
good one-on-one defense this
weekend, in addition to being
heads up on team defense," jun
ior two-meter defender Alison
Gregorka said. "Everyone was
making quick decisions and fol
lowing through, which is exactly
what needs to be done on de
fense. We are all very excited to
play USC again, and we will be
ready to play them tough on
Thursday."
Champion echoed a similar
sentiment, expressing faith in her
teams preparedness for the up
coming rematch.
"We've taken what we've
learned from the last time we
played them, read over the plays,
and watched the video," the team
captain said. "1 think everyone's
taken something from the last
time we played them, and we're
excited to get another shot."
