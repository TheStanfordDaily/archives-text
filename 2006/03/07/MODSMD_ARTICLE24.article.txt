# Brothers, basketball and bonding
## 
### 
One of the few things I can
thank my brother for is
teaching me how to be a
passionate basketball fan.
Twelve years separate me from
my thirty year-old sibling — twelve
years of major generational differ
ences. While I listened to Limp
Bizkit, my brother would pump
Ace of Base through his car stereo.
While I watched MTV, he watched
VHI. And while my earliest bas
ketball memory was watching
Magic Johnson's failed attempt at
coaching, my brother could recol
lect the "Showtime" era during
which Johnson led the Lakers to
five NBA titles.
Basketball was one of very few
special things 1 could share with
him while growing up. Together, we
could watch television for hours,
talking about how much we loved
our Lakers and how next year
would be our season.
My brother currently lives in In
diana with his wife and four chil
dren. The combination of his busy
family life and my life as a studious
Stanford student makes it pretty
hard for us to communicate on a
daily basis. But this past Saturday
evening — on the heels of one of
the most exciting basketball days in
recent memory — my cell phone lit
up and vibrated with my brother's
number on the display.
The day was indeed filled with
its highs and lows.
It couldn't have begun any
worse than with the Cardinal's 21-
point loss to UCLA on Senior Day.
But the game was fun while it last
ed. The Sixth Man Club erupted
when three-pointers from Chris
Hernandez and Lawrence Hill pro
pelled the Cardinal to within nine
in the second half. And it's always
nice hearing the band.
The afternoon quickly im
proved once the UNC-Duke game
made its way to the television
screen. Several lead changes and
ties throughout the evening made
the game one of the best I'd ever
witnessed — and that notion was
only strengthened by Duke's late
heroics, erasing a twelve-point
deficit with two minutes to go. I'm
sure the shouts erupting from my
RA's room at the time could be
matched only by those of the
Cameron Crazies themselves.
And then came the best game of
them all, the Lakers' impressive win
over the mighty Pistons. Kobe
Bryant (see: God) nabbed 40 points
en route to leading his team to a
105-94 trouncing of the Evil Ones
from the East. After suffering
through a more-than-disappointing
start to the season. Laker fans wel
comed the victory with open arms.
The middle of the Laker game
marked the special occasion itself
— the rare phone call from my
brother.
"Hey, you watchin' the Lake-
Show?" he asked. "We're up right
now and we got a chance to take
this one. Hey, and I was watching
the Stanford game at the restaurant
today. Were you there? You were
rooting for UCLA, right?"
"Ummm, you're joking, right?" I
replied. "It'd be awesome if the
Lakers won this one. And yeah, I
was sitting in the Sixth Man section.
And no, I didn't go to the Universi
ty of La Verne, so I actually have
loyalty to my own school."
From there, we went on to talk
about new ballparks he had visited,
our thoughts on the Dodgers' up
coming season, how much we hated
Mike Vanderjagt, and the chances
of another basketball team moving
to Anaheim. At no point did we dis
cuss my classes, his family, our par
ents, or our ambitions. Tlie discus
sion was rooted in sports, and that's
where it stayed. After a few min
utes, the need to pick my clothes up
from the dryer forced me to hang
up.
It's funny how sports can bring
people together. And it's also kind
of sad that oftentimes, it's the only
thing that can bring people togeth
er.
Sure, we're all happy and cheer
ing together watching Chris Her
nandez make a game-winning free
throw. You're fine giving hugs to
complete strangers whenTYent Ed
wards throws a touchdown pass.
But when that same stranger passes
you by in the Quad, would you even
throw him a smile?
Most of the time, 1 wish my rela
tionships with certain distant fami
ly members could extend beyond
the arena. Yet when I compare
these relationships to those shared
by my friends and their families, I
thank God I have at least these ties.
People frequently ridicule me
for my obsession with sports. "It's
just a waste of time," they say.
"Where will it take you in life?"
Well, other than a lucrative ca
reer with ESPN in the near-future,
that obsession can bring me togeth
er with people I would have never
met otherwise and with those loved
ones who have very little else in
common with me.
And for those few minutes each
week, it can reconnect me with the
guy who was once my best friend,
the guy who long ago taught me
how to be a fan.
