# WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
## After sweep, here comes the Tide 
### JUSTINA KAMIEL GRAYMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the season nears a close, women's gymnastics is
in great position to contend for the title of being the
best — both in the Pac-10, and in the nation.
"We're climbing a mountain getting ready to peak
at the end of the year," head coach Kristen Smyth said.
The team had an intense weekend on the road,
with 11 gymnasts having only one day of rest between
meets.
"They showed they could be a great team no mat
ter what the circumstances," Smyth said. "It was a
challenging weekend mentally and physically."
On Friday, the No. 8 Stanford women's gymnastics
team made a spectacular team effort, easily outper
forming No. 51 Cal State Fullerton, 194.675-191.175.
The Cardinal took the top two places in all four events
and in the all-around. Freshman Nicole Ourada noted
the confidence that spread as a result of the meet.
"The energy was just very high," Ourada said. "We
went out there knowing what we wanted to do and we
knew what we needed to get it done."
The greatest Titan efforts came in an attempt to
rival the Cardinal's performance on bars and beam.
The defeats, however, were nearly insurmountable.
In vault, Stanford gymnasts soared to the top three
places. Sophomore phenom Liz Tricase, with a 9.95 ca
reer-best. and senior Glyn Sweets, with a season-best of
9.9, captured first and second, respectively. On uneven
bars.Tricase again dominated, winning the event with a
perfect 10.0. Freshman Kelly Fee had an outstanding
performance with a season-best of 9.875 on bars.
Fee also captured the floor exercise title, and Foley
was second on the event. Foley, who won beam and
was in the top three of every event, and Ourada, the
top two finishers in the all-around, helped issue a
crushing blow in the all-around to Fullerton, with the
top Titan finisher scoring more than one full point less
than than Ourada.
On Sunday, Stanford proved more than capable of
contending with the nation's elite, as the Cardinal
trumped then-No. 8 UCLA for the first time in school
history, 195.950-195.150.
"[lt will] help us carry on," Ourada said."[The en
ergyj was just crazy."
Tricase is making perfection a norm these days,
having scored a 10.0 on bars in three consecutive
meets, and even earning a shoutout in Sports Illustrat
ed's "Faces in the Crowd."
But. for Tricase, the limelight was hardly a blip on
the radar.
"Spotlight? What spotlight?"Tricase said. "It's not
an individual thing."
Vault was a high-placing event for the Cardinal,
with Sweets and Tricase tying for second (9.9). Oura
da too had an impressive showing with a 39.125 sec
ond-place finish to UCLA's Kristina Comforte. Com
forte was the Bruins' top performer on Sunday, and
the all-around winner. Meanwhile, freshman Heather
Purnell proved ready to compete, returning from a
knee injury to debut in the all-around.
On Friday, Stanford will put its success on the line
against a formidable No. 3 Alabama squad in its last
regular-season meet. The team will likely need to
excel in beam, where Alabama is weakest, and on
bars, where the Cardinal have an impressive No. 2 na
tional ranking.
While sophomores Tabitha Yim and Lauren El
more may compete Friday, Smith didn't think the line
up would look that different.

"There are not many more adds to our lineup,"
Smyth said. "We just want to refine it."
Ashley Miles is the star for Alabama. She is the No.
1 gymnast in the nation on vault, and the second
ranked gymnast on floor. The Crimson Tide's team
success is mirrored by Miles' success in these events,
as they are ranked third on vault and second on floor.
Terin Humphrey, a 2004 USA Olympian, also will
compete for Alabama, and she figures to challenge
Stanford in the all-around.
Cassie Martin. Melanie Banville, and Brittany
Magee also have proven themselves to be some of the
team's top performers in individual events.
"This is a great opportunity for us to hit twenty
four routines," Smyth said.
With Stanford coming off of its historic feat at
UCLA, it would be impossible to make any assump
tion about the outcome of the upcoming competition.
ITie Cardinal gymnasts can break records, make histo
ry, and trounce great teams — and they can also con
tend.
"We're coming together as a team like you wouldn't
believe," Smyth said.
