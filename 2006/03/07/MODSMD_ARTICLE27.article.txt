Being a big fish in a little pond isn't always enough.
With just the NCAA Indoor Championships remaining,
several track stars are hoping to prove that they can set
records not just at Stanford, but outside the Farm as well.
Senior Solomon Welch highlighted Stanford's per
formance at the University of Washington's Last
Chance Indoor Meet in Seattle two weekends ago.
Welch closed out the regular season by breaking the
school triple jump record, which he had set in Seattle at
the beginning of the year. Welch wasted no time in set
ting the record, jumping 51 feet and 10.5 inches on his
first attcmpt3 of the day. Later on, junior Feranmi
Okanlami responded with a personal best of his own by
jumping 51 feet 7 inches — a distance nearly a foot fur
ther than that of his previous, and good enough for sec
ond on Stanford's all-time list.
"The triple jump competition was inspirational for
both Feranmi and myself," Welch said. "I jumped [the
record] on my first try, and [Okanlami] knew that we
had to take care of business."
Both jumps met the NCAA provisional mark, with
Welch's jump placing him 12th in the nation and earn
ing him a guaranteed trip to NCAAs. Other athletes
who made provisional standards were junior Joaquin
Chapa and sophomore Lauren Jesperson in the mile.
On Tuesday night, athletes across the national will hear
whether or not they will travel to nationals, as many
more athletes reach provisional marks than are allowed
to go.
This year's NCAA Indoor Championship will be
held in Fayetteville. Ark. The Stanford men's team will
head to the meet tied for No. 20 in the national rankings

with UCLA, while the women's team will arrive ranked
second, trailing just Texas.
The women's strongest event looks to be the 300()
meter run. an event in which the Cardinal have four
women ranked in the top ten. Junior Arianna Lambie,
who is ranked second, is expected to lead the Stanford
group of runners. The Cardinal also have several
women ranked in the top ten in various other events as
well. Sophomore Teresa McWalters in ranked third the
3000 meter, and sophomore Erica McLain is ranked
fourth in the triple jump. The distance medley relay
team is also ranked fourth in the nation.
On the men's side, most of the Cardinal's points are
likely to be scored in the distance events. The men did
not qualify any runners for the sprint events, but sever
al athletes did qualify for field events. Sophomore
Graeme Hoste will travel to the meet as the highest in
dividually ranked Cardinal, as he holds the No. 10 rank
ing in the pole vault.
Welch is hoping that he and a few others can step up
and perform well for the team. Welch feels that he un
derperformed in last year's competition, and he wants
to turn things around.
"This is my chance to prove to myself, my coach, and
my opponents that 1 can perform well when it's impor
tant," Welch said.
Meanwhile, although the indoor track season has yet
to end, Stanford ignored the cold and rainy weather and
opened the outdoor season with the Stanford Spring
Opener. A small crowd was in attendance as several
athletes began their quest for NCAAs. Senior Sarah
Hopping and sophomore Danielle Maier hit NCAA re
gional marks in the javelin and hammer, respectively,
while sophomore Anna McFarlane qualified in the pole
vault.
