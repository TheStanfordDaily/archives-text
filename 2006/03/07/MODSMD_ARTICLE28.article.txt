## Ehrlich to teach new bio course Reading-based course will focus on social sciences 
### JULIE KLEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It sounds like a bold proclamation, but the unofficially
titled "How the World Works in 18 Lectures" course, to be
offered spring quarter, may just live up to its hyperbolic
name.
Formally listed as "Human Biology and Environment,"
Prof. Paul Ehrlich's new class promises to take students
through topics such as how nuclear weapons work, the im
portance of population size, the process of evolution and
how many people in the world are rich, poor, hungry or full.
The three-unit class, offered through the Biological Sci
ences Department, is a reading-based course geared to
ward freshmen and sophomores. With no prerequisites, the
class will focus on the social sciences, with continuous influ
ence from the natural sciences, philosophy and ethics.
"Nothing is off limits," said Ehrlich, who also serves as
president of the Center for Conservation Biology. "No sci
ence or math background is needed. Everything will be ex
plained in plain English. It will be a free-willing and fun
course."
Known for his dry sense of humor, Ehrlich clarified that
the class will not go in depth on every issue that it covers,
but will give a broad overview of where humanity came
from, where it is going and how it treats its environment
and individuals.
"I think everyone ought to have a course like this,"
Ehrlich said. "We are not going to dodge controversies."

While similar classes have existed in the past, this recent
incarnation is a result of Stanford's new focus on environ
mental studies led by the new Woods Institute for the En
vironment. Previously known as the Stanford Institute for
the Environment, Woods is overseeing the campus-wide
Initiative for Environmental Sustainability, launched in
2004. The Institute is named for Stanford trustee Ward W.
Woods, Class of 1964, and his wife Priscilla, who gave a $30
million gift to the University for this purpose.
"At Stanford, we believe that creating a sustainable fu
ture is not only possible, it is essential," reads the Web site
for the Woods Institute, "and that as a member of the
greater global community, the University has a responsibil
ity to contribute its best efforts toward that end."
Kathy Neal, communications manager for the Woods
Institute, further expressed its goals for the future of envi
ronmental concerns at Stanford.
"One of the founding principles of Stanford's Woods
Institute for the Environment is that to solve complex en
vironmental problems, we must learn to think in new and
different ways," wrote Neal in an email to The Daily. "That
means, for example, understanding the links between
human evolution and the environment, between and with
in cultures and ecosystems and economics, population and
consumption.
"Finally, we must understand the global forces at work,
and how national and international governments and
other agencies are affecting our world," she concluded.
These are among the many issues that will be ad
dressed in Ehrlich's new course.
"Professor Ehrlich's class will cover these and other
critical issues," Neal said, "informing and engaging stu
dents, as well as pushing them to understand and develop
their own values in a 'messy world,' as Ehrlich describes it."

"He is a master," Neal continued. "The class will be
quite an experience for any student."
The class will read two books in addition to attending
the semiweekly lectures. Ehrlich said that the texts will en
able students to critically and analytically consider the top
ics presented in class.
Ehrlich said that he hopes that all students will coasider
taking the course because he aims to draw questions of the
modern era into the Stanford curriculum.
"My great hope," he said."is that Stanford will become
the first 21st-century university"
