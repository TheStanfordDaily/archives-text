# SUPREME COURT RULES TO UPHOLD MILITARY RECRUITMENT ON CAMPUSES
## Solomon survives suit 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD MANAGING EDITOR 
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously yesterday to up
hold a federal statute that requires law schools to grant military
recruiters access — or risk losing federal funding.
The law. known as the Solomon Amendment, had drawn fire
from law students, faculty and administrators nationwide due
to the military's discriminatory "Don't Ask Don't Tell Policy"
targeting gays and lesbians. Many of these law schools boast
policies barring employers that discriminate from recruiting on
campuses.
According to the opinion written by Chief Justice John
Roberts, the Court ruled that the law does not violate the free
speech rights of universities opposed to the policy, as the
Solomon Amendment "regulates conduct, not speech."
"It affects what law schools must do — afford equal access to
military recruiters — not what they may or may not say,"
Roberts wrote.
The 8-0 decision — Justice Samuel Alito did not take part

because he had not been confirmed before opening argu
ments began in December — presented a significant, if not
unexpected, blow to the Forum for Academic and Institution
al Rights (FAIR), an alliance of law schools and faculties that
oppose the law.
Roberts rejected FAIR'S argument — as well as that of U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which had sided with the
law schools — alleging that their First Amendment rights were
violated.
"Nothing about recruiting suggests that law schools agree with
any speech by recruiters, and nothing in the Solomon Amend
ment restricts what the law schools may say about the military's
policies," he wrote.
In the decision, Rumsfeld vs. FAIR, the Court took an overly
narrow approach to an issue that was not so clear-cut, said an admit
tedly disappointed Larry Kramer, dean of Stanford Law School.
"It's not a very generous decision with respect to speaker
rights," Kramer told The Daily. "It seems to be a stretch to say it's
not an issue of speech."
Members of OUTLAW, the stu
dent group at the Law School that led
protests against "Don't Ask, Don't
Tell" when recruiters from the Navy
Judge Advocate General's Office vis
ited Stanford in October (see "Policy
under fire: Law students protest JAG
recruitment," The Stanford Daily,
Oct. 4,2005) expressed similar senti
ments of resigned disappointment.
"I'm not really surprised by the
decision," said OUTLAW Co-presi
dent Michael Angelo. "It doesn't
mean we're dropping this issue."
According to Susan Robertson, as
sociate dean for career services at the
Law School, only a small percentage
of students take jobs with the armed
forces.
"I hope that this decision is a cata
lyst to encourage people that because
that military's policies are wrong, to
really push for change," Robertson
said. "It's not going to come from the
courts."
Indeed, with a doubled initiative
to pressure politicians, direct chal
lenges creeping up through the courts
and alternative legislation proposed
by Rep. Marty Meehan (D-Mass.) ap
pearing in Congress, concerned
groups and individuals are looking at
the big picture and moving to tackle
the military's discriminatory policy

head on.
"Eventually I have no doubt that
this policy will be abandoned," said
Kramer, who likened the logic behind
"Don't Ask, Don't Tell" to previous
policies against women and African
Americans in the armed forces.
"There's no question where we're
going to end up with this."
Kramer added that — with sup
port of virtually the entire faculty —
the Law School would aid further
protests against the Solomon
Amendment and military recruit
ment on campus in the future.
"As with all such issues, part of our
mission is to encourage students to
take the lead," he said.
Not all OUTLAW members found
the decision to be detrimental to the
cause of ending discrimination
against gay men and lesbians in the
armed forces, however.
"Personally, I think there are cases
where requiring certain conduct
should be seen as a violation of free
speech," wrote OUTLAW member
Justin McNabney in an email to The
Daily. "However, this is not one of
those cases because no one miscon
strues the law school's permission to
allow the military to use its facilities
as its implicit endorsement of 'Don't
Ask Don't Tell,' especially given the
publicity of this case."
Looking beyond the issue of free
speech, McNabney echoed Roberts'
argument.
"Even if the First Amendment
were applicable here, Congress' au
thority to raise a strong military

should trump whatever minor in
fringement the Solomon Amend
ment imposes on faculty members'
free speech," he wrote.
If they are to move against the rule
itself, opponents of "Don't Ask, Don't
Tell" said they hoped to have greater
backing from the University than it
saw during the case against Solomon.
While the Law School faculty as a
group supports FAIR, and University
President John Hennessy issued a
statement during the protests, Stan
ford as an institution did not join the
lawsuit.
"We felt that was a glaring error,"
said OUTLAW Co-president
Spencer Jones, noting that a number
of other prestigious institutions of
higher learning had signed on. "Stan
ford was the big exception."
Kramer said that this criticism of
the University is misplaced.

"It affects what law schools must do — afford equal access to
military recruiters — not what they may or may not say,"
Roberts wrote.
The 8-0 decision — Justice Samuel Alito did not take part

because he had not been confirmed before opening argu
ments began in December — presented a significant, if not
unexpected, blow to the Forum for Academic and Institution
al Rights (FAIR), an alliance of law schools and faculties that
oppose the law.
Roberts rejected FAIR'S argument — as well as that of U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which had sided with the
law schools — alleging that their First Amendment rights were
violated.
"Nothing about recruiting suggests that law schools agree with
any speech by recruiters, and nothing in the Solomon Amend
ment restricts what the law schools may say about the military's
policies," he wrote.
In the decision, Rumsfeld vs. FAIR, the Court took an overly
narrow approach to an issue that was not so clear-cut, said an admit
tedly disappointed Larry Kramer, dean of Stanford Law School.
"It's not a very generous decision with respect to speaker
rights," Kramer told The Daily. "It seems to be a stretch to say it's
not an issue of speech."
Members of OUTLAW, the stu
dent group at the Law School that led
protests against "Don't Ask, Don't
Tell" when recruiters from the Navy
Judge Advocate General's Office vis
ited Stanford in October (see "Policy
under fire: Law students protest JAG
recruitment," The Stanford Daily,
Oct. 4,2005) expressed similar senti
ments of resigned disappointment.
"I'm not really surprised by the
decision," said OUTLAW Co-presi
dent Michael Angelo. "It doesn't
mean we're dropping this issue."
According to Susan Robertson, as
sociate dean for career services at the
Law School, only a small percentage
of students take jobs with the armed
forces.
"I hope that this decision is a cata
lyst to encourage people that because
that military's policies are wrong, to
really push for change," Robertson
said. "It's not going to come from the
courts."
Indeed, with a doubled initiative
to pressure politicians, direct chal
lenges creeping up through the courts
and alternative legislation proposed
by Rep. Marty Meehan (D-Mass.) ap
pearing in Congress, concerned
groups and individuals are looking at
the big picture and moving to tackle
the military's discriminatory policy

head on.
"Eventually I have no doubt that
this policy will be abandoned," said
Kramer, who likened the logic behind
"Don't Ask, Don't Tell" to previous
policies against women and African
Americans in the armed forces.
"There's no question where we're
going to end up with this."
Kramer added that — with sup
port of virtually the entire faculty —
the Law School would aid further
protests against the Solomon
Amendment and military recruit
ment on campus in the future.
"As with all such issues, part of our
mission is to encourage students to
take the lead," he said.
Not all OUTLAW members found
the decision to be detrimental to the
cause of ending discrimination
against gay men and lesbians in the
armed forces, however.
"Personally, I think there are cases
where requiring certain conduct
should be seen as a violation of free
speech," wrote OUTLAW member
Justin McNabney in an email to The
Daily. "However, this is not one of
those cases because no one miscon
strues the law school's permission to
allow the military to use its facilities
as its implicit endorsement of 'Don't
Ask Don't Tell,' especially given the
publicity of this case."
Looking beyond the issue of free
speech, McNabney echoed Roberts'
argument.
"Even if the First Amendment
were applicable here, Congress' au
thority to raise a strong military

should trump whatever minor in
fringement the Solomon Amend
ment imposes on faculty members'
free speech," he wrote.
If they are to move against the rule
itself, opponents of "Don't Ask, Don't
Tell" said they hoped to have greater
backing from the University than it
saw during the case against Solomon.
While the Law School faculty as a
group supports FAIR, and University
President John Hennessy issued a
statement during the protests, Stan
ford as an institution did not join the
lawsuit.
"We felt that was a glaring error,"
said OUTLAW Co-president
Spencer Jones, noting that a number
of other prestigious institutions of
higher learning had signed on. "Stan
ford was the big exception."
Kramer said that this criticism of
the University is misplaced.
