# COSMIC COLLAPSE
## UCLA scores 25 of game's final 32 points to claim Pac-10 Title 
### BLAIR CRTICHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Up 69-60 with 2:15 left in regulation. No.
13 Stanford seemed to have its fourth straight
Pac-10 tournament title all but wrapped up
— but Noelle Quinn willed it otherwise.
The junior guard, who led the Bruins with
22 points, had her most important five in the
final 45.0 seconds of regulation. After con
verting a three-point play, she hit a turn
around jumper at the buzzer to tie the game
at 70 and send it into overtime, a first for the
Pac-10 Tournament.
And after using a 10-1 spurt to send the
game into overtime, the Bruins dominated
the extra period as well. The Bruins finished
the game on a 25-7 run en route to the 85-76
victory and the conference title.
"The shot was at the free throw line,
Brooke [Smith] was right in my face but that
play was called for me, so I had to come
through for my team," Quinn said. "It was a
challenge, but it was a good look."

"They're capable of doing that," junior
center Brooke Smith added. "They've got
some very, very talented players. They just hit
shots the needed to hit."
After sophomore guard Candice Wig
gins' breakaway layup stretched Stanford's
lead to nine points, the Cardinal missed
back-to-back free throws and shot just 2-of
-10 in overtime. Wiggins, who led all scorers
with 23 points, went ()-of-5 from the field in
overtime.
"1 was just trying to be as aggressive as I
could and help my team win," said Wiggins of
continuing to shoot, despite the cold streak.
Stanford's last chance to take the lead
came with 1:59 left, but Wiggins missed a
jumper and the Cardinal could not come up
with the rebound. Freshman center Chiny
Ibekwe sealed the game with two free throws,
putting the Bruins up 80-76.
"We had some people playing uncharac
teristically and missing some shots that nor
mally go down," VanDerveer said. "We had
some chances to seal it and we didn't," [But] 1
don't think there is any shame in losing to
three first-round draft picks."
UCLA depended heavily on the
aggressive defense of their "Big
Tliree" — Quinn and senior guards
Lisa Willis and Nikki Blue. The Bruins
led the conference in steals this season
(10.66 per game), and forced 15 in the
Finals.
Willis, who was named the tourna
ment's Most Outstanding Player, had
six of her own en route to a new tour
nament record (19).
"I thought some of the turnovers
were just unforced," VanDerveer said.
"They didn't get easy baskets except
for when we turned it over."
Stanford held a 13-point lead both
in the first and second halves, but was
never able to break the game open.
"Our players just never said die,"
UCLA head coach Kathy Olivier
said. "1 was a little concerned with
two-and-a-half minutes, but they had
that hunger. They had a look of'tell us
what we need to do, because we'll do
it."'
The Cardinal started the game with
four made baskets, all on layups down
low. Junior center Brooke Smith (22
points, 9-of-16 shooting) had six points
and an assist in the first two minutes.
Starting the game one three-point
er shy of the Stanford single season
record, senior Krista Rappahahn
struggled before breaking the for most
three-pointers in a season (82). Nei
ther shot was textbook.
The senior from Lebanon, Con
necticut missed her first two chances at
the record, but tied Jamie Carey's
1990-1991 mark on a Wiggins despera
tion pass from the baseline. The
record-setter came from the right cor
ner. rolled around the rim twice and
needed the backboard to drop.
Junior forward Kristin Newlin
showed impressive range throughout
the game. Her first two jumpers were
18-footers, and then she decided to
back up even further in the second
half. The forward was 2-of-8 from be
hind the arc for her career, but the six
foot-five forward stroked back-to
back three-pointers in the second half
to extend the Cardinal lead to 11
points.
Newlin had a double-double (10
points, 10 rebounds) off the bench, hut

junior forward Eziamaka Okafor (two
points) was the only non-starter to
score.
Willis fouled out in overtime, but by
then the damage was already done.
UCLA's three talented guards had
scored 56 points.
"I know they've won state titles in
basketball and volleyball, but I've
never won anything in my life," Blue
said. "Just cutting down the net [was
special], I've never cut down a net be
fore."
The Bruins were able to get players
other than the "Big Three" involved.

time since 1988. The loss ends Stan
ford's streak of three straight Pac-10
Tournament titles, but the team's sea
son does continue with the NCAA
Tournament. The Cardinal will find
out their next opponent on Selection
Monday, March 13.
"We definitely have learned a lot
from this," Wiggins said. "Losing is
painful but we're really just focused
going into the next game."
Up 69-60 with 2:15 left in regulation. No.
13 Stanford seemed to have its fourth straight
Pac-10 tournament title all but wrapped up
— but Noelle Quinn willed it otherwise.
The junior guard, who led the Bruins with
22 points, had her most important five in the
final 45.0 seconds of regulation. After con
verting a three-point play, she hit a turn
around jumper at the buzzer to tie the game
at 70 and send it into overtime, a first for the
Pac-10 Tournament.
And after using a 10-1 spurt to send the
game into overtime, the Bruins dominated
the extra period as well. The Bruins finished
the game on a 25-7 run en route to the 85-76
victory and the conference title.
"The shot was at the free throw line,
Brooke [Smith] was right in my face but that
play was called for me, so I had to come
through for my team," Quinn said. "It was a
challenge, but it was a good look."

"They're capable of doing that," junior
center Brooke Smith added. "They've got
some very, very talented players. They just hit
shots the needed to hit."
After sophomore guard Candice Wig
gins' breakaway layup stretched Stanford's
lead to nine points, the Cardinal missed
back-to-back free throws and shot just 2-of
-10 in overtime. Wiggins, who led all scorers
with 23 points, went ()-of-5 from the field in
overtime.
"1 was just trying to be as aggressive as I
could and help my team win," said Wiggins of
continuing to shoot, despite the cold streak.
Stanford's last chance to take the lead
came with 1:59 left, but Wiggins missed a
jumper and the Cardinal could not come up
with the rebound. Freshman center Chiny
Ibekwe sealed the game with two free throws,
putting the Bruins up 80-76.
"We had some people playing uncharac
teristically and missing some shots that nor
mally go down," VanDerveer said. "We had
some chances to seal it and we didn't," [But] 1
don't think there is any shame in losing to
three first-round draft picks."
UCLA depended heavily on the
aggressive defense of their "Big
Tliree" — Quinn and senior guards
Lisa Willis and Nikki Blue. The Bruins
led the conference in steals this season
(10.66 per game), and forced 15 in the
Finals.
Willis, who was named the tourna
ment's Most Outstanding Player, had
six of her own en route to a new tour
nament record (19).
"I thought some of the turnovers
were just unforced," VanDerveer said.
"They didn't get easy baskets except
for when we turned it over."
Stanford held a 13-point lead both
in the first and second halves, but was
never able to break the game open.
"Our players just never said die,"
UCLA head coach Kathy Olivier
said. "1 was a little concerned with
two-and-a-half minutes, but they had
that hunger. They had a look of'tell us
what we need to do, because we'll do
it."'
The Cardinal started the game with
four made baskets, all on layups down
low. Junior center Brooke Smith (22
points, 9-of-16 shooting) had six points
and an assist in the first two minutes.
Starting the game one three-point
er shy of the Stanford single season
record, senior Krista Rappahahn
struggled before breaking the for most
three-pointers in a season (82). Nei
ther shot was textbook.
The senior from Lebanon, Con
necticut missed her first two chances at
the record, but tied Jamie Carey's
1990-1991 mark on a Wiggins despera
tion pass from the baseline. The
record-setter came from the right cor
ner. rolled around the rim twice and
needed the backboard to drop.
Junior forward Kristin Newlin
showed impressive range throughout
the game. Her first two jumpers were
18-footers, and then she decided to
back up even further in the second
half. The forward was 2-of-8 from be
hind the arc for her career, but the six
foot-five forward stroked back-to
back three-pointers in the second half
to extend the Cardinal lead to 11
points.
Newlin had a double-double (10
points, 10 rebounds) off the bench, hut

junior forward Eziamaka Okafor (two
points) was the only non-starter to
score.
Willis fouled out in overtime, but by
then the damage was already done.
UCLA's three talented guards had
scored 56 points.
"I know they've won state titles in
basketball and volleyball, but I've
never won anything in my life," Blue
said. "Just cutting down the net [was
special], I've never cut down a net be
fore."
The Bruins were able to get players
other than the "Big Three" involved.
