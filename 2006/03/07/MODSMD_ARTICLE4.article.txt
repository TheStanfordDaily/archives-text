# COSMIC COLLAPSE
## UCLA scores 25 of game's final 32 points to claim Pac-10 Title 
### BLAIR CRTICHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Up 69-60 with 2:15 left in regulation. No.
13 Stanford seemed to have its fourth straight
Pac-10 tournament title all but wrapped up
â€” but Noelle Quinn willed it otherwise.
The junior guard, who led the Bruins with
22 points, had her most important five in the
final 45.0 seconds of regulation. After con
verting a three-point play, she hit a turn
around jumper at the buzzer to tie the game
at 70 and send it into overtime, a first for the
Pac-10 Tournament.
And after using a 10-1 spurt to send the
game into overtime, the Bruins dominated
the extra period as well. The Bruins finished
the game on a 25-7 run en route to the 85-76
victory and the conference title.
"The shot was at the free throw line,
Brooke [Smith] was right in my face but that
play was called for me, so I had to come
through for my team," Quinn said. "It was a
challenge, but it was a good look."

"They're capable of doing that," junior
center Brooke Smith added. "They've got
some very, very talented players. They just hit
shots the needed to hit."
After sophomore guard Candice Wig
gins' breakaway layup stretched Stanford's
lead to nine points, the Cardinal missed
back-to-back free throws and shot just 2-of
-10 in overtime. Wiggins, who led all scorers
with 23 points, went ()-of-5 from the field in
overtime.
"1 was just trying to be as aggressive as I
could and help my team win," said Wiggins of
continuing to shoot, despite the cold streak.
Stanford's last chance to take the lead
came with 1:59 left, but Wiggins missed a
jumper and the Cardinal could not come up
with the rebound. Freshman center Chiny
Ibekwe sealed the game with two free throws,
putting the Bruins up 80-76.
"We had some people playing uncharac
teristically and missing some shots that nor
mally go down," VanDerveer said. "We had
some chances to seal it and we didn't," [But] 1
don't think there is any shame in losing to
three first-round draft picks."
