# CONSTRUCTION UPDATE
## CIP renovations right on track 
### GERRY SHIH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Two months ago, two students lament
ed the condition of Durand House in the
"Intro to the Creative Writing Minor"
course with an ode to their residence.
They wrote: "It is an old and dying
structure/Chipped walls and falling
paint/Above the sink lies a dripping rup
ture/You'll sit on faded, cold furniture/The
sound of the stair is hardly faint."
Consider that less than a mile away
from 634 Mayfield. freshmen are merrily
feasting in Branner's sumptuous dining
hall, supping with frivolous abandon be
neath the newly renovated, vaulted ceiling
and glittering lights, and the inequality in
housing conditions suddenly seems re
markably clear.
University officials claim that they are
all too aware. Stanford Housing is current
ly in year 14 of a massive 20-year, $300 mil
lion renovation process, called the Capital
Improvement Project (CIP), with the ob
jective to systematically refurbish and up
date all undergraduate and graduate stu
dent residences across campus.
"This is the largest program of renewal
and rejuvenation of University residences
and dining facilities in Stanford's history,"
said Rodger Whitney, executive director of
student housing. "The goal of the program
is to provide parity in quality of living in
Stanford's older residences, to provide ad
ditional on-campus housing for graduate
students and to provide a four-year guar
antee of on-campus housing and dining for
undergraduate students in facilities that
meet operational and programmatic needs
for current and future Stanford students."
Once the CIP is complete, he added, all
residences will be of roughly comparable
quality "from a facilities and overall oper
ational standpoint."
According to CIP manager Gabriella
Judd, the first priority of the project is to
improve all-around housing safety. By the
time the project is finished, each residence
will have upgraded its seismic safety level
to Stanford's Level 4 "life safety" standard,
and fire alarm and fire sprinkler systems
will be improved as well. Buildings will
comply with the federal Americans with

Much of the construction on campus is part of a 20-year, $300 million renovation
project called the Capital Improvement Project (CIP). Here, a worker performs weld

Disabilities Act (ADA),and paint jobs, carpets and furniture
will be replaced as needed.
"Although these needs are generally held in common,
each building is a bit different and has its own set of issues,"
Judd said. "The CIP also addresses issues specific to the
house or dorm, such as refurbishing kitchens as necessary or
improvements to such spaces as computer clusters, study
spaces and seminar rooms."
Electronic access control systems will be installed, so stu
dents can enter buildings with their SUID cards rather than
traditional keys.
The CIP was originally conceived as a $110 million proj
ect to be completed over 10 years. However, Whitney re
called that by the third year, "it became clear that our plans
were very ambitious and it was operationally impossible to
maintain that pace and afford the costs required to provide
such significant renovations over such a short period of
time."
The University's budget, combined with initial cost mis
calculations, the introduction of the ADA and continuously
changing building codes forced the CIP to lengthen its
schedule to 19 years.
As of today, the program appears on track to finish by its
projected completion date.
"I can tell you that the program has been extremely suc
cessful in meeting its goals," Judd said. "The program is very
closely managed to ensure that the projects are completed
successfully, which to our department means on time, within
budget and in a manner that leaves our student residents sat
isfied."
While the emphasis of the CIP rests on "invisible" electri
cal, mechanical and plumbing infrastructure upgrades, Judd
emphasized the positive student feedback on immediately
visible improvements.
"We regularly receive positive comments about the vast
improvement in the appearance of our ClP'ed residences,
and we hope that students are pleased with the new interior
and exterior appearance and functionality too," Judd said.
"Students also generally really enjoy the new bike racks and
outdoor site furnishings such as picnic tables and barbe
cues."
