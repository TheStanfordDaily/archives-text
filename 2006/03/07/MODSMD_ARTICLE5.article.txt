## CIP renovations right on track

Two months ago, two students lament
ed the condition of Durand House in the
"Intro to the Creative Writing Minor"
course with an ode to their residence.
They wrote: "It is an old and dying
structure/Chipped walls and falling
paint/Above the sink lies a dripping rup
ture/You'll sit on faded, cold furniture/The
sound of the stair is hardly faint."
Consider that less than a mile away
from 634 Mayfield. freshmen are merrily
feasting in Branner's sumptuous dining
hall, supping with frivolous abandon be
neath the newly renovated, vaulted ceiling
and glittering lights, and the inequality in
housing conditions suddenly seems re
markably clear.
University officials claim that they are
all too aware. Stanford Housing is current
ly in year 14 of a massive 20-year, $300 mil
lion renovation process, called the Capital
Improvement Project (CIP), with the ob
jective to systematically refurbish and up
date all undergraduate and graduate stu
dent residences across campus.
"This is the largest program of renewal
and rejuvenation of University residences
and dining facilities in Stanford's history,"
said Rodger Whitney, executive director of
student housing. "The goal of the program
is to provide parity in quality of living in
Stanford's older residences, to provide ad
ditional on-campus housing for graduate
students and to provide a four-year guar
antee of on-campus housing and dining for
undergraduate students in facilities that
meet operational and programmatic needs
for current and future Stanford students."
Once the CIP is complete, he added, all
residences will be of roughly comparable
quality "from a facilities and overall oper
ational standpoint."
According to CIP manager Gabriella
Judd, the first priority of the project is to
improve all-around housing safety. By the
time the project is finished, each residence
will have upgraded its seismic safety level
to Stanford's Level 4 "life safety" standard,
and fire alarm and fire sprinkler systems
will be improved as well. Buildings will
comply with the federal Americans with
