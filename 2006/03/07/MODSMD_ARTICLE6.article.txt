Students who are relatively poor readers dur

likely to show aggressive behavior later on, two
Stanford researchers found in a new study The
conclusion suggests the importance of early inter

Literacy Achievement in a Sample of Low-In

researchers found that students who entered ele

skills as of the third grade. But this relationship did
not seem to carry into fifth grade.
The study points to the importance of paying
