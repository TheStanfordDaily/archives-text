## Study links reading skills and aggression 
### JAMES HOHMANN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Students who are relatively poor readers dur
ing their first years of elementary school are more
likely to show aggressive behavior later on, two
Stanford researchers found in a new study The
conclusion suggests the importance of early inter
vention and supports an emerging consensus
among education experts that children's" reading
and social skills are connected.
"The study demonstrates that the academic and
social worlds are linked from very early in school,"
said study co-author and Education doctoral candi
date Sarah Miles in an interview with The Daily. "If

kids are having problems in one area, other areas
should he looked at to figure out what is going on."
"This points out that we really need to look at
the whole child, even if our primary concern is
with their academic performance," added Debo
rah Stipek, the other co-author and the dean of the
School of Education. "There is evidence that chil
dren's emotional well-being, social skills and other
areas of development play a role in how well they
learn."
The study "Contemporaneous and Longitudi
nal Associations Between Social Behavior and
Literacy Achievement in a Sample of Low-In
come Elementary School Children," was pub
lished in the January-February issue of Child De

velopment,the flagship journal for the Society for
Research in Child Development.
The study found that good readers were not
more likely to be social. Along with aggression, the
researchers found that students who entered ele
mentary school with relatively strong social skills
were more likely to have relatively good reading
skills as of the third grade. But this relationship did
not seem to carry into fifth grade.
The study points to the importance of paying
attention to the "whole child," the researchers
said. It suggests that schools and parents should in
tervene on their child's behalf when they show
early signs of trouble.
"Problems tend to exacerbate
over time," Miles said, who was a
public school teacher in Oakland be
fore enrolling in the Stanford pro
gram. "Aggression actually increased
only moderately but statistically sig
nificantly later on."
While the report eschewed spe
cific policy recommendations. Miles
said that spending more one-on-one
time with students, experimenting
with different teaching methods and
creating after-school reading groups
are ways teachers can reach out to

poor readers. Schools could also do
more to make sure all students have
access to books at home and are
aware of local public libraries.
Miles and Stipek spent three
years analyzing data collected be
tween 19% and 2002. Four-hundred
rural and urban children from low
income families were followed from
kindergarten or first grade through
the end of elementary school. The
children were assessed when they
first entered school and again in
third and fifth grades. The re
searchers controlled for ethnicity
and gender, but not for whether
they came from rural or urban
schools.
"It's a population that is at risk,"
Miles said of the focus on low-in
come children. "It is a group of kids

who need support."
Miles said that their longitudinal
data — following the same group of
children for five years — was more
revealing than cross-sectional stud
ies, which evaluate different children
at different ages. A five-area correla
tion path analysis was used for the
study. Longitudinal studies like this
are less common than cross-section
al studies because they are more ex
pensive to conduct and take more
time. Miles said that the large sample
helps lend more weight to the study's
results, which were peer-edited by
three boards of review.
The authors cautioned that the
research only showed "moderate ef
fects."
"We cannot make any huge
proclamations," Miles said.

The researchers both pointed to
questions the study raised that they
would like to investigate further in
the future. For instance, the study did
not attempt to analyze frustration
levels of students, a factor that Miles
acknowledged could be important
on the path that leads to aggression.
"We don't really know why kids
who have a hard time reading are
generally more aggressive later on,"
Stipek said. "We are not demonstrat
ing causation.There is a proven asso
ciation. You can predict a little bit
about aggression but you cannot say
one causes the other.
"We need to go behind the associ
ation and try to learn the mecha
nisms causing this," she continued.
"We really need to learn more about
how to promote social skills in kids."
