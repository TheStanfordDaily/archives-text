## Law School selects gender committees Four committees aim to examine gender equality 
### DENISE SOHN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In early February, Stanford Law
School created four committees to
look into issues of gender equality on
campus as well as in the professional
legal world.
More than 50 law students applied
to serve on one of the four commit
tees. Though students of all class years
expressed interest in joining the com
mittees, Law Association Co-Presi
dents Sarah Gilbert and Bret Logue
noted that first-year law students in
particular had wanted to become in
volved.
Overall, "there was a healthy level
of interest in the committees from a
diverse group of students, faculty and
staff," said Associate Dean of Student
Affairs Catherine Glaze.
Despite strong interest from stu
dents, only five were selected to be
members, per committee.
Law School Prof. Pamela Karlan
joined Glaze, Gilbert and Logue to
choose these members.
According to Glaze, the "most im
portant goal of the selection process
was to get diverse membership on the
conimittees."The four defined "diver
sity in the broadest sense of the
word," she said.
Among other things, the selection
group looked for diversity in gender,
class year and viewpoint.
Each of the four committees, "Ad
missions," "Faculty, Academics and
Classroom Preparation," "Student
Life" and "Career Services and
Women in the Legal Profession" will
work to "better understand issues fac
ing Stanford students here and in
their careers and...generate and help
to implement any solutions to prob
lems that the committees identify,"
wrote Gilbert and Logue in a letter
addressed to the Stanford communi
ty.
Students will work closely with
facultv and staff members "as full

members of each committee," Glaze
said.
The "Admissions" committee is
comprised of faculty and staff mem
bers Ron Gilson. Norm Spaulding
and Faye Deal, and students Kristina
Filipovich, Anna Humphreys. Sarah
Olsen, John Polita and Aravinda Se
shadri. These members will focus
their attention on the Law School ad
missions process, including specific
aspects that relate to the gender
makeup of the school. Among other
things, the committee will investigate
"how the process works, who applies,
who is accepted and who accepts of
fers of admission to the Law School."
The second committee, on "Career
Services and Women in the Legal Pro
fession," will focus on issues of gender
equality in professional legal careers.
Committee members, including facul
ty and staff members Karlan, Debo
rah Hensler and Susan Robinson, and
students Katy Johnson, Meredith
Nikkei, Leah Reid, Ariel Schwartz
and Neesa Sethi, will look at "hiring
processes for summer and permanent
jobs, networking and career develop
ment" in the legal profession.
The third committee, focusing on
"Faculty. Academics and Classroom
Participation." will examine aspects
of classroom and academic life, as well
as the composition of Stanford's fac
ulty. The committee includes faculty
and staff members Deborah Rhode
and Jayashri Srikantiah, and students
Alan Bakowski, Angie Cha, Anna
Neill, Sonya Sanchez and Jon Stein.
The final committee will tackle "is
sues outside the classroom, including
first-year orientation, student activi
ties and other aspects of student life."
This Student Life Committee is com
posed of faculty and staff members
Allen Weiner. Diane Chin and Glaze,
and students Salena Copeland. Eliza
beth Mcßride. James Poole, Nolan
Reichl and Perrin Wright.
Though members have been se
lected, the committees are far from
complete.
"it is premature to say exactly how
the committees will work or how many times they will meet,"
Glaze explained. "I think the committees will start working
this week or next, depending on the committee."
Though Glaze expressed uncertainty about whether any
changes or progress made would be felt by the broader Stan
ford community, she spoke very optimistically about the pos
sible benefits for the Law School.
"I am confident that the energy and the creativity of the
committee members can make Stanford Law School an even
better place than it already is," she said.
