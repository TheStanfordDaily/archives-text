## Those dammed salmon 
### 
If someone told you they were about to plant some
salmon, what would you think that meant?
My upbringing in New England entailed annual
trips to Plymouth Plantation, complete with lessons on
the instructive role American Indians played in pilgrim
life. Members of local tribes taught America's first Eng
lish settlers how to grow corn and fertilize it with fish,
producing an awesome bounty that led to the inaugural
Thanksgiving celebration. And so the story goes.
So that's probably what I would guess: planting a
salmon means burying it at the base of a cornstalk to
fertilize it.
Guess again. Instead, picture a 21st-century version
of a young salmon school bus, driving thousand offish
down a river, past all the dams, where they are finally
deposited to belatedly commence their coming-of-age
migration to the ocean.
Today, "planting" salmon is just a small part of mod
ern fish farming — one of the inventions we now use to
keep another of our inventions, large dams, from
killing them all off.
Over the past 150 years, salmon populations in the
Pacific Northwest have fallen precipitously, initially
because of commercial over-fishing, but later due to
the construction of dozens of dams that block salmon
from returning to their birthplaces to reproduce. The
government has tried to protect salmon by labeling
various species as threatened or endangered under the
Endangered Species Act. They have subsequently
spent hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars to
figure out how we can have our hydropower and eat
salmon, too. As required under the National Environ
mental Policy Act, any project — like building dams
— that causes a significant environmental impact
needs to take measures to "mitigate" these negative ef
fects, either by avoiding them or by doing an equiva
lent amount of good elsewhere.
"Salmon farming" has not been the sole mitigation
strategy applied to this problem. Many dams have
been outfitted with special ladders, screens and by
passes to facilitate the annual salmon runs that the
dams would otherwise destroy.
In the wild, adult salmon swim from the ocean in
land, in some cases traveling thousands of miles up
stream to lay their eggs. To facilitate their migration,
many dams are equipped with special ladders that fish
are able to navigate in steps to get past the dam. With
out these ladders, the salmon would try to scale the
dams, most near or over 200 feet tall, in a single jump.
Not being the smartest of creatures, salmon would try
to do so until they were either eaten by a predator or
fatally self-flagellated.
Going downstream isn't a Cakewalk for young
salmon, either. They, too, have to navigate our dams —
and generally get to choose between being flung over
the top. finding the bypass channel or going through
the turbines while trying to avoid the blades. Both have
their dangers (though improvements in turbines have
made their fish kill rates surprisingly small), leading
engineers to seek an even better means of juvenile
salmon passage. Most recently, they've come up with
the "removable spillway weir," the fish version of the
waterslide at Great America.
"Now, there's what a fish has been dreaming of!'"
Bob Lohn.the regional administrator for the National
Marine Fisheries Service, has been quoted as saying.
Were I a betting woman. I would guess that they'd
rather the dam wasn't there at all. And despite at
tempts at fish amusement, many stakeholders have not
found these mitigation efforts to be sufficient.
This is where hatcheries — or fish farms — come
in. Some dams have no means for salmon to get past
them. Sometimes they are too tall for a reasonable fish
ladder, or salmon passage was simply not a priority
when they were built. Either way, these dams would be
the end of the line for the epic salmon run — were it
not for the hatchery.
As yet another mitigation measure, fish that reach
many of these dams are now collected and "harvest
ed." The adult salmon, for which this migration is nat
urally a last hurrah anyway, are bonked on the head
(a.k.a. killed), allowing eggs to be removed from the fe
males and semen from the males.'l Tien.in closely mon
itored tanks, fish farmers fertilize the eggs, creating
about 2.000 baby salmon for each female. Once they
are big enough, the baby salmon, or smolts. are moved
to larger tanks — sometimes called "the raceway" —
where they are fed until they are ready to be "planted"
in the river. When the water is ripe, the smolts are ei
ther barged or trucked downstream where they are left
to naturally migrate to the ocean. Presumably, after
they spend several years in the ocean as adults, they
will migrate back to where they were born,get bonked
on the head and continue the circle of farmed fish life.
TT»e verdict on hatcheries is still out. Some argue
that they arc effective, even occasionally creating new
salmon runs. Others argue that they do not compen
sate for the loss of wild fish caused by the dams.
Regardless of which side of that debate you fall on.
you have to wonder if this is what the drafters of the
Endangered Species Act had in mind when they called
for the protection of threatened wildlife.
For other animals, like Oregon's spotted owl. peo
ple have sought to preserve the species primarily for
aesthetic value and ecosystem health. The result was
stringent restrictions on spotted-owl habitat destruc
tion. For many in the Northwest, the salmon runs hold
a similar, majestic place in Pacific life — but the basis
for their preservation isn't simply aesthetic. Salmon
arc essential to both the pockets of commercial fisher
men and the cultures and stomachs of American Indi
an tribes.
