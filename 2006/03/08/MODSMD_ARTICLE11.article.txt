# Once Computer, $100
## Planned Laptop Promises Huge Impact On Developing World 
### SAM BHAGWAT DESK EDITOR 
In January 2005, at the
World Economic Forum in
I Davos. Switzerland, world leaders
discussed the possibility of comput
ers so cheap that they could be easily
available in the developing world.
Today, that possibility seems to be coming
close to reality In November 2005,
Nicholas Negroponte, head of the MIT
Media Lab. unveiled a prototype of a lap
top that could be sold — in minimum or
ders of one million —at a cool $100.
While Negroponte now projects the price
somewhat higher, around $110, he also
sees the project's completion soon — in
late 2006.
How can a computer be manufac
tured so cheaply? According to the pro
ject's Web site, they will use "high-reso
lution black and white displays com
monly found in inexpensive DVD play
ers [that) can be used in bright sunlight
— at a cost of approximately $35." They
also plan to save money by running
open-source code like Linux and selling
their computers in a minimum order of
one million to governments.
The project, run by the nonprofit
group One Laptop Per Child (OLPC)
formed at Davos and backed by compa
nies like Google. Red Hat,and Advanced
Micro Devices, could have monumental
consequences for the education and ma-

terial improve
ment of poorer na
tions. Historically, technoi
ogy facilitating the cheap and
easy spread of information has
often taken centuries to he directly seen
in material progress — from the printing
press to "Poor Richard's Almanack" for
example. But One Laptop Per Child, by
connecting poor, rural farmers to every
thing from weather forecasts to educa
tional resources to medical information,
shows how this process can be sped up
exponentially. Commentators have also
suggested alternate uses of the OLPC
laptops as cash registers and a method to
document transactions or to provide the
formal titles to land necessary for the
poor to obtain loans.
Other effects of digitalization in the
third world could also complement and
amplify the impact of One Laptop Per
Child. A prime example is Internet ac
cess, which has been spreading like wild
fire - the proportion of all Internet users
that are from the developing world has
grown from 2% in 1996t0 12% in 2002 to

an estimated 20% today. OLPC, com
bined with wider Internet access, could
prove revolutionary.
And while commercially available
computers have been growing more and
more powerful and radically cheaper, the
OLPC laptop, at SIOO, would be im
mensely cheaper than other manufactur
ers' options. Dell, for example, prices its
bottom-of-the-line desktops and laptops
— which have little more memory and
processing power than are projected in
the specifications of the OLPC laptop —
at $300 and $450 respectively.
Moreover, these $1(X) laptops will
have features designed especially for its
projected market. The two notable ex
tras are a hand crank that can provide an

RYAN NOON/The Stanford Daily
hour's worth of power with two
minutes of use, to cope with a sparse,
unpredictable or nonexistent electricity
supply; and wireless broadband enabling
networking between physically close
computers. The $100 laptop's innovative
design also utilizes flash memory in lieu
of a hard disk.
Throughout the modern era, the sci
entific community has relied on making
research accessible to all who might be
interested in learning or building on it.
With the coming of the new age of infor
mation technology, the amount of
knowledge made easily accessible to all
has grown to include not only somewhat
esoteric and complex scientific concepts,
but, through Web sites like Wikipedia,
everyday knowledge and ideas.
But those behind One Lap Per Child
argue that its ultimate potential is far
higher than the immediate goal of dis
seminating knowledge.
"Peace will never happen as long as
there is poverty." said Negroponte in a
February 2005 interview. "Poverty can
only be eliminated through education."
