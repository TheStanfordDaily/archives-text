# Electronic postage system ignites controversy
## 
### JANET KIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Though email has been assuming the
role traditionally filled by "snail mail."
email providers AOL and Yahoo! have
proposed a program that inadvertently
preserves a relic of the bygone era:
stamps. At first glance, the idea of elec
tronic stamps seems a paradox; the small,
adhesive squares have always been asso
ciated with physical post.
The "e-stamp" program, however,
seeks to implement a system of electron
ic postage fees, in order to ensure that
mass mailings reach their intended recip
ients without interception by anti-spam
filters. Senders looking to take advantage
of this secure email service would pay a
fee ranging from one-fourth of a cent to a
penny per message. Users of this service
— primarily businesses and advertisers,
whose mass-mailings are often filtered
out as spam mail — would also be re
quired to secure prior consent from the
recipients, or risk being blocked from the
email servers. According to the Associat
ed Press. AOL stated that the system
would reduce help reduce spam, since
only legitimate groups would be likely to
pay the fee.
Proponents point to the new program
as a natural evolution in the email deliv
ery process.
"The last time I checked, the postal
service has a very similar system to pro
vide different options," said Nicholas

Graham, an AOL spokesman, in an inter
view with The New York Times. He high
lighted services like certified mail,
"where you really do get assurance that if
what you send is important to you, it will
be delivered, and delivered in a way that
is different from other mail."
The proposal, however, has met with
vocal opposition from a variety of inter
est groups. I"hey contend that the pro
gram would perpetrate the rich-poor di
vide on the Internet, a forum that has
thus far managed to provide a relatively
equal playing field for people of all
backgrounds.
"The Internet has become what it is
because of freedom of communication.
Open discussion is what gives it value.
There should be no cost for particular
services, and email should be free and ac
cessible to all. This will disenfranchise
people," said Richard Cox, chief informa
tion officer of anti-spam organization
Spamhaus, in an interview with
CNET.co.uk. "An email charge will de
stroy the spirit of the Internet."
Over 500 groups have joined in form
ing DearAOL.com. an open letter to
America Online that decries the imple
mentation of the program. The coalition
— which joined together such disparate
groups as the Gun Owners of America
and the Democratic National Committee
— characterizes the program as an
"email tax," and argues that the program
will allow AOL to profit from a poor
email filtering process.

"AOL will face a simple business
choice: spend money to keep regular
spam filters up-to-date, or make money
by neglecting their spam filters and push
ing more senders to pay for guaranteed
delivery," the letter argues. "Poor deliv
ery ol mail turns from being a problem
that AOL has every incentive to fix to
something that could actually make them
money if the company ignores it."
It is this long-term "incentive" to have
a faulty spam filter that is of the most con
ccrn to critics. An ideal email system with
a flawless spam filter would have no need
for different levels of delivery guarantee,
but critics believe that financial profits
will deter AOL, Yahoo! and other
providers from perfecting their filters.
Another major concern is that legiti
mate organizations, such as not-for-profit
and community groups, will suffer from a
tiered delivery process because of their
relative lack of spending power.
"We're a grassroots organization,"
said William Green, president of Right-
March.com, in an interview with The
Washington Post. "We're not funded by
big donors. If we're sending two to three
million emails a week, paying a penny per
email will price us out."
AOL has worked to assuage these
concerns. On March 3, it issued a press
statement stating its intentions to make
the secure delivery program available,
free of charge, to all qualified non-profit
organizations.
"We want to make sure that not-for

profits who depend on timely commu
nication with their members get all of
the privileges of this powerful medi
um," said AOL Postmaster Charles
Stiles in the press release. "Our an
nouncement guarantees that every cer
tified not-for-profit will get the same
benefits as private-sector companies
that have decided to utilize four] Certi
fied Email system."
Proponents contend that providers
won't profit on a faulty spam system be
cause trying to do so would drive off cus
tomers. They envision the paid delivery
option as an opportunity to increase both
technological innovation and sender dis
cretion.
Executives from Goodmail. the com
pany whose certification service AOL is
using, commented on this issue.
"The email inbox is a potentially dan
gerous place." said Richard Gingras,
Goodman's chief executive officer, in an
interview with The New York Times.
"There is a tremendous need for a class of
certified email that can convey to con
sumers that a message is authentic."
Graham believes that the paid deliv
ery system will provide justifiable com
pensation for the anti-spam technology
that email providers have been develop
ing.
"We have some prerogative to move
to a system that asks for other people to
participate and share the financial bur
den in making a clean email environment
on the Internet," he said.
