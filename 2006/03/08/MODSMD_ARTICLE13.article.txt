## Editorial Life on the OSP wait list 
### 
We know that the Oxford overseas
studies program is highly competi
tive and academically rigorous. We
recognize that the Australia program is high
ly popular and academically specialized. We
are coming to terms with the fact that even
after having been admitted to Stanford,
there is still a great deal of competition for
limited opportunities. It's not as if all doors
magically opened once we entered Stanford;
there are still plenty of applications left to fill
out. And yes, we are thankful for all of these
opportunities, even if we have to fight for
them.
However, since the acceptance decisions
were announced for next fall's Overseas
Studies Programs, the selection criteria has
raised many eyebrows. Most of these deci
sions have no obvious rationale; the nebu
lous standards for admission can only be
guessed at based on the applicant's personal
statement.
Meanwhile, the OSP waitlist has become
a popular place to hang out. even for people
considered to be shoo-ins for an overseas
program. Many qualified students have been
rejected from popular programs such as
Paris and Santiago. Other students were de
ferred to a second choice, and still others are
figuring out the changes they'll have to make
to their four-year plans.
From the looks of it, participating in an
overseas program is not a conscious decision
on our part; rather, it is something that hap
pens to us. Students have very little control
over which program they are accepted to or
which quarters they can spend abroad. If
studying overseas is an integral part of our
college experience, why aren't we given a lit
tle more say in the matter?
The University constantly lauds OSP as
an incomparable experience for Stanford
students,one that gives us the opportunity to
break out of what we've known our whole
lives and push ourselves to discover the
world. Participation in OSP is even required,
or at least highly recommended, for certain
majors.
The University is right; This program is
important. Studying abroad is one of the
best opportunities we will ever get. and of
fers the chance of an experience that will

shape our lives and perspectives forever. But
if all Stanford students truly deserve the
chance to live this experience, we should also
have the autonomy to choose what kind of
experience we want.
To be fair, acceptance rates for most over
seas programs are fairly high, especially for
some less popular centers. This makes it is
easy enough for people to go overseas if they
aren't fussy about where or when they go.
But really, should students who want to go to
Paris in spring as part of their academic plan
be expected to be equally happy to go to
Moscow in the winter?
Whether it be Paris. Berlin or Australia,
Stanford students should be able to count on
going where we want to go when we want to
go. Contrary to what you might learn from
ResEd, Stanford students are capable of
managing their own lives.
Perhaps the truth is that the overseas ex
perience is not for everyone. Maybe going
overseas is a privilege to which only select
candidates are entitled. Maybe we cannot
expect to go overseas whenever we want. Or
maybe there aren't enough resources avail
able to ensure that everyone has a realistic
chance of going to the overseas program
they want.
If so. OSP and the University need to be
more honest about overseas programs.They
should state clearly that Stanford's overseas
program will not be able to accommodate
everyone, and that students should be ex
pected to apply to non-Stanford programs if
they want to plan their academic programs
with greater certainty.
And as competition for overseas pro
grams continues to rise, OSP needs to make
the selection process more transparent. It
should clearly frame the selection criteria in
terms of more objective measures like lan
guage requirements, grade-point averages,
relevance to one's major or participation in
extracurricular activities. The program also
needs to accommodate the increasing de
mand for its overseas programs, or at least
start by being honest about how competitive
it is to see the world this way.
OSP should avoid inflating our expecta
tions; instead. the program should only make
promises that it can realistically keep.
