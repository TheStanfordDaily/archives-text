# Board game manifesto

### 
The score is tied. The roar of the crowd
is in your ear. but you barely hear it. A
single bead of sweat rolls down your
forehead, but you don't notice. There is
nothing but you and the Game. You are
ready.
You flip the card over. You have one
minute to draw...Flying Buttress. GO!
You see, there are some people who are
born with absolutely no aptitude for sports.
Except for when my brother and I were
forced to participate in youth soccer, no
Klein has played on an organized sports
team since my grandfather played soccer in
Hungary in 1918. It's possible that he broke
his leg in practice on purpose that year to
keep from being drafted into the Austro-
Hungarian army. It's also possible that he
was just a crappy soccer player.
The bottom line is, even if baseball is the
great American pastime or football is a
testosterone-fest not to be missed, I have
about as much interest in watching paint dry
as I do in watching or playing sports games.
There is no runner's high or thrill of the fight
in my life, so I have to find somewhere else
to apply my competitive drive.
And that's where my favorite pastime —
the board game — comes in. You may scoff,
but there's a lot more to board games than
rainy day distractions or something to occu
py the kids you baby-sit — the board game
experience can be as Xtreme as you make it.
Monopoly, Outburst and Cranium are
some of my favorites, and because there are
many different genres of board game, it's
easy to find the perfect one for any situation.
Big group of friends with nothing to do?
Whether drunk or sober, party games like
Catchphrase are great. Got four hours to kill
with your teenage brother? TVy Risk and at
tempt to conquer Asia.
These games can be educational, too,
though not in the way you might expect.
When my roommate DeAnna came to col
lege, she never swore out loud and rarely had
a cross word to say about anybody. But when
we play the rummy-like card game Phase 10,
there is no room for niceties. The first time
DeAnna played the game and someone
played a Skip card on her, she giggled, called
the offending player a bitch and promptly
apologized. However, thanks to countless
rounds of play over the last year, DeAnna
has learned to curse with the best of us — a
skill that she says has proved invaluable in
her daily life.
Many people would never consider play
ing a board game to relieve stress. But espe
cially at this time of the quarter, as Dead
Week and finals approach, there's nothing
better than taking 30 minutes or an hour off
to play with friends. If you want it to be a
laidback time to chill and decompress, that's

fine. Or, if you want it to be no-holds-barred,
I'm-going-to-throw-this-board-across-the
room-and-pretend-that-it's-my-problem-
set. that's even better. And at the end of the
day. it's really just a game: you can put it
away, return to reality and move on with
your life. If you want to.
I have come to the unfortunate realiza
tion. however, that the line between the
darkness of sports and the light of board
games is grayer than I once believed. There
actually are certain instances where my en
thusiasm for gaming actually extends out
into the three-dimensional world.
In his final sports column for the Daily
last year, Jordi Mata-Fink discussed a certain
trip that we took to Malibu Grand Prix, an
old-school mini-golf course just up the 101.
Although I was described as "a fashion-con
scious Grande Dame who disdains all things
sports" and who "spent a rather enjoyable
evening strolling around the well-lit gardens
with her putter over her shoulder like a para
sol," he neglected to mention that I was a re
spectable third place out of five players. With
all of the ultimately irrelevant scenery and
theming, mini-golf bears a striking resem
blance to props-heavy games like Mouse
Trap, which I completely support.
And I was once perfectly content to be
lieve that Jordi had his world of sports and I
had mine — until he quite literally beat me
at my own game. Trivial Pursuit, and forced
me to reevaluate. First conclusion: Trivial
Pursuit is stupid. Second conclusion: Jordi is
good at lots of things. Third conclusion:
Whatever, I still hate sports.
No matter how much I contemplate my
dislike of sports versus my love of board
games, I never reach conclusive answers.
Board games may fulfill the role that sports
conventionally play in a person's life, and they
shouldn't be considered inferior to sports.
The last-second win right before the buzzer is
just as thrilling for me as that last touchdown
or homerun may be for you, and I'm fine with
that. If you don't judge me for my passion for
board games, then I won't hold your interest
in sports against you. Much.
