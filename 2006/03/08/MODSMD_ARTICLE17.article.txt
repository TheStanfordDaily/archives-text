# The 						Racist Review?
## 
### 
Apparently, my declaration to The
Stanford Review that it is, in fact,
"on" ("The Stanford Review: Oh —
It's on," March 1) was interpreted by Emeri
tus Editor-in-Chief, senior Benjamin
Ciuthrie, as an opportunity to try to cast me
off as the "epitome of the worst in modern
liberalism" ("Bad Wound Epitomizes the
Worst in Modern Liberalism," March 2). Fair
enough. I called your publication out for its
"trash" production. I urged my readers to do
anything they could to avoid reading it — in
cluding not reading. I presented my opinion
on the issue and it opposes your opinion. So
what do you do? You make it so now every
time my grandma Google searches my name;
she sees that her grandson, the gay-Ameri
can-Indian-doctoral-student-in-California,is
heralded as the "epitome of the worst in
modern liberalism." Thanks.
But what you forget is that I have cat-like
skills and reflexes. And I have an uncanny
ability to make a delicious sparkling lemon
ade party spritzer punch out of sour lemons.
But I did not expect it to get THIS BAD.
How can you not see that I — an American
Indian — do not want my image to be used as
an athletic mascot? The fact that you do not
comprehend how this is offensive to me is be
yond understanding. I have simply tried to
remind my readers that placing the debate in
terms of tradition, legacy and free-speech
neglects the lived experiences of American
Indian students at Stanford and elsewhere.
Before I remove myself from this dialogue,
let me respond to your charges — and then I
will say no more.This is the last column I will
devote to this topic. I think my point has been
clear from the start.
To the charge that I epitomize the worst in
modern liberalism, I say no. In my opinion, the
worst modern liberals are the ones that sit

back and let publications like The Review
marginalize their comrades without writing,
speaking out and re-enforcing the strength of
the informed voice. But since you are in the
business of identifying and "outing" those that
epitomize the "worst" in modern liberalism,
Mr. Guthrie, can you name some others? Do
you keep a list? I could use a little company.
To the charge that 1 am close-minded, I say
no. You are mistaken. 1 have considered your
stance and rejected it. If I had given it no con
sideration— that would be close minded.
Must 1 keep it in constant consideration? The
task seems exhausting, if possible, which is
why I believe that the Stanford American In
dian Organization (SAIO) and the Universi
ty Administration have put the issue to rest
(although that's only based on my interpreta
tion of their actions).
To the charge that I am intolerant. 1 say
yes. 1 cannot tolerate your abusive treatment
and attitude toward my heritage. I realize that
you arc well within your rights as an Ameri
can to exploit my image in vain, but I will not
sit beside you at an athletic event or revel in
the memories of this exploitation with you. If
you want to alienate me for my intolerance,
you are within your rights to do so. Apparent
ly my appeals will not stop you.
But by casting me off as the epitome of
"the worst in modern liberalism" you do an
injustice to your conservative readers as well.

There are conservative students that agree
with me on the mascot issue, and you only
alienate them by aligning my efforts with
"modern liberalism." In truth. I feel that this
issue transcends political perspective, which
is one of the reasons why I'm surprised that
The Review has taken it on and approached it
so vigorously. I don't appreciate you using this
as a divisive political wedge!
It's not about liberals and conservatives.
The Review, as a conservative publication,
has inappropriately misplaced its energy by
rekindling the debate. Any such prolonging
has been the fault of The Review, who has
preached "Long Live Lightfoot!" well after
the incidents on campus have occurred — all
of which have been formally apologized for
by those responsible — and continued to
present an isolating message through Letters
to the Editor of the Daily.
The worst of such accusations is this:
"[Bad Wound] employs the rhetoric of vic
timization to stifle debate on a fascinating cul
tural subject — Indian mascots."
Do you have any idea how racist that
sounds? The plight of the American Indian is
hardly rhetorical. It's historical. Your state
ment is ignorant and racist, Mr. Guthrie. And
to the degree that you represent The Review,
it is too!
In fact, I believe your last accusation is
what has stifled this debate. I will not be your
victim. You. your publication and your alum
ni can enjoy your athletic events and revel in
your memories without me. thank you.
And your claim that "The Review is ar
guably the only forum on campus where you
could have an honest debate about the mas
cot" is delusional at best, apocalyptic at worst.

Indian — do not want my image to be used as
an athletic mascot? The fact that you do not
comprehend how this is offensive to me is be
yond understanding. I have simply tried to
remind my readers that placing the debate in
terms of tradition, legacy and free-speech
neglects the lived experiences of American
Indian students at Stanford and elsewhere.
Before I remove myself from this dialogue,
let me respond to your charges — and then I
will say no more.This is the last column I will
devote to this topic. I think my point has been
clear from the start.
To the charge that I epitomize the worst in
modern liberalism, I say no. In my opinion, the
worst modern liberals are the ones that sit

back and let publications like The Review
marginalize their comrades without writing,
speaking out and re-enforcing the strength of
the informed voice. But since you are in the
business of identifying and "outing" those that
epitomize the "worst" in modern liberalism,
Mr. Guthrie, can you name some others? Do
you keep a list? I could use a little company.
To the charge that 1 am close-minded, I say
no. You are mistaken. 1 have considered your
stance and rejected it. If I had given it no con
sideration— that would be close minded.
Must 1 keep it in constant consideration? The
task seems exhausting, if possible, which is
why I believe that the Stanford American In
dian Organization (SAIO) and the Universi
ty Administration have put the issue to rest
(although that's only based on my interpreta
tion of their actions).
To the charge that I am intolerant. 1 say
yes. 1 cannot tolerate your abusive treatment
and attitude toward my heritage. I realize that
you arc well within your rights as an Ameri
can to exploit my image in vain, but I will not
sit beside you at an athletic event or revel in
the memories of this exploitation with you. If
you want to alienate me for my intolerance,
you are within your rights to do so. Apparent
ly my appeals will not stop you.
But by casting me off as the epitome of
"the worst in modern liberalism" you do an
injustice to your conservative readers as well.

There are conservative students that agree
with me on the mascot issue, and you only
alienate them by aligning my efforts with
"modern liberalism." In truth. I feel that this
issue transcends political perspective, which
is one of the reasons why I'm surprised that
The Review has taken it on and approached it
so vigorously. I don't appreciate you using this
as a divisive political wedge!
It's not about liberals and conservatives.
The Review, as a conservative publication,
has inappropriately misplaced its energy by
rekindling the debate. Any such prolonging
has been the fault of The Review, who has
preached "Long Live Lightfoot!" well after
the incidents on campus have occurred — all
of which have been formally apologized for
by those responsible — and continued to
present an isolating message through Letters
to the Editor of the Daily.
The worst of such accusations is this:
"[Bad Wound] employs the rhetoric of vic
timization to stifle debate on a fascinating cul
tural subject — Indian mascots."
Do you have any idea how racist that
sounds? The plight of the American Indian is
hardly rhetorical. It's historical. Your state
ment is ignorant and racist, Mr. Guthrie. And
to the degree that you represent The Review,
it is too!
In fact, I believe your last accusation is
what has stifled this debate. I will not be your
victim. You. your publication and your alum
ni can enjoy your athletic events and revel in
your memories without me. thank you.
And your claim that "The Review is ar
guably the only forum on campus where you
could have an honest debate about the mas
cot" is delusional at best, apocalyptic at worst.
