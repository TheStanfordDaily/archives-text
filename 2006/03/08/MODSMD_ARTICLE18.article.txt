The truth about vegetarianism
Barrett Sheridan,in his Friday piece, "The
fight against vegetarianism," clearly intends
to provoke and humor his audience. In re
sponse to his call. I offer something stranger
(and even funnier) than common misunder
standings and stereotypes: truth.
Despite Sheridan's contention that vege
tarians are economically inefficient, vegetar
ians actually decrease deadweight loss. Ihe
fact is that the price of meat would be a lot
higher if it accounted for the environmental

damages of the agriculture it necessitates, the
unnecessary suffering it induces and the hun
dreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer subsi
dies it receives. As it is, people are effectively
encouraged to eat more meat than is good for
society due to the implicit and explicit subsi
dies.
Also, Sheridan bemoans the lack of
choice afforded him when eating with vege
tarians. While I can empathize with the de
sire to share a Thai dish with a friend, I can
only sympathize with someone who be
lieves their freedom of choice is violated

when their decision to befriend vegetarians
leads to tough trade-offs, like whether to
share a vegetarian meal or dine on cow
alone.
Ultimately, Sheridan jejunely suggests
eating vegetarians for economic efficiency. 1
can prove that it would work better to man
date that 10 percent of meat sold in the U.S.
be rendered from omnivorous humans. Let's
be honest, their fattier tissue would sell bet
ter anyway.
