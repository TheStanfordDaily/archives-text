# Op-Ed
## Election bill has positive impact 
### TIM SANDERS 
Friday's op-ed by Andrew Barragan and Mima Mo
hammed ("We need to reevaluate election bill 05,"
Mar. 3) contains several factual inaccuracies and
dubious claims. 1 will deal briefly with these, after which 1
will discuss the Commission's rationale for proposing this
bill and the positive impact it will have on students and
the electoral process in general.
Contrary to the claims of Barragan and Mohammed,
it is true neither that "the joint meeting was attended
mostly by members of the Graduate Student Council"
nor that "more than half of the Undergraduate Senate
was unable to attend the meeting." A quorum in a joint
legislative session is eight members of each body, and the
minutes from the meeting clearly demonstrate that there
were exactly eight voting members present from each
legislative body. Furthermore, 1 find it difficult to believe
that many undergraduate senators were "unable to at
tend the meeting because of irreconcilable conflicts," but
"would have planned ahead to attend" if they were given
more advance notice. How an "irreconcilable" conflict
can be avoided even by someone who "planned ahead" is
beyond me.
Barragan and Mohammed attack the wording of the
bill first by misquoting it and then by asserting that,
"Whatever the authors behind the bill meant by 'un
wieldy' is not outlined." The irony of course is that going
to the trouble of defining "unwieldy" would have made
the bill itself unwieldy. It should be clear to any reason
able reader what the effect would be if we were to allow
an unlimited number of endorsements on the ballot.
Barragan and Mohammed assert that "Election Bill
05 essentially takes away power from the student body,"
and that "candidates should be able to have the choice
whether or not they want to receive an endorsement by a
student group." They must not have read far enough
down the bill to encounter the text that states, "elimina
tion of the endorsement option on the ballot does not in
any way detract from candidates' abilities to seek from
any and all sources endorsements that will not be listed
on the ballot." How this bill "takes away power" remains

unclear; in fact,elimination of the endorsement option on
the ballot actually gives power back to the student body
that could otherwise have been concentrated in the
hands of special interests.
Any student on this campus has the capability to be
come aware of the candidates as well as their positions
and affiliations through a variety of means far more in
formative than a tagline on the ballot. In fact, the Elec
tions Commission publishes a handbook each year on the
same website that the ballot appears. To argue that en
dorsements need to be listed on the ballot itself requires
the assumption that voters are either too incompetent or
too lazy to look up this information themselves.
Even if the Commission were to concede that the vot
ers were as apathetic and uninformed as would be re
quired for ballot endorsements to be useful (which we do
not), we still must address the disparate impact that
would occur for candidates.To the uninformed voter who
looks no further than the ballot to make choices about
whom to vote for, a candidate who takes a principled
stand against seeking an endorsement looks like he was
unable to secure one, while a candidate who appeals to a
broad voter base and could attract many endorsements
looks like she is beholden to one interest group. Thus the
system as it existed last year advantages the true one
issue special interest candidate at the expense of both
candidates who seek no endorsements and candidates
who could secure multiple endorsements.
Although the Commission will not be including en
dorsements on the ballot this year, candidates are free to
seek as many endorsements as they wish from any
sources whatsoever. The Commission feels that endorse
ments are a wonderful way for groups to communicate
their support of candidates, and by removing endorse
ments from the ballot we have greatly increased the po
tential for multiple groups to express their approval of
the same candidate in whatever non-ballot forum they
choose. Thus, we have not only leveled the playing field
for candidates but also for endorsing groups.
