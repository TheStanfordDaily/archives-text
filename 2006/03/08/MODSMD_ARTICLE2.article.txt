## Stanford's SMART leaves kids healthier Program to reduce TV watching started in California, Michigan school districts

With technological advances in the entertainment in
dustry, it seems unlikely that students will cut back on the
time they spend watching TV and playing video games.
But that is exactly what is taking place in school districts
around the globe thanks to a program designed by Stan
ford researchers.
Tom Robinson, associate professor of pediatrics and
of internal medicine at Stanford, is the University's prin
cipal researcher behind the Stanford Student Media
Awareness to Reduce Television (SMART) curriculum.
The curriculum was provided for third and fourth
grade children from two public elementary schools in
San Jose of similar demographic and scholastic composi
tion. A trial period was conducted between September
19% and April 1997.
These students were challenged to do without televi
sion for 10 days, then to limit themselves to just seven
hours per week.
Students in one of the two elementary schools re
ceived 18 lessons over the course of a six month curricu
lum to reduce television, videotape and videogame use.
The study showed that the students receiving the ad
ditional instruction experienced a decrease in their body
mass index. Using this information, the researchers were
able to conclude that reducing television, videotape and
videogame use may be a promising approach to prevent
childhood obesity.
This change, researchers said, could be explained by
the increase in exercise children received when they
found new ways to spend their time.
An article in The San Francisco Chronicle reported
that students in the study found activities to replace
watching TV, including reading, playing outside with
friends and riding bikes. The community became more
involved in helping children find alternate outlets as
other schools within the district began to participate.The
YMCA offered free temporary memberships and the
city library organized various games and classes.

Are Stanford students watching too much TV? Study
shows reducing TV time increases exercise, reduces
childhood obesity and cuts down on aggression.
