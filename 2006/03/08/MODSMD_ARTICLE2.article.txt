## Stanford's SMART leaves kids healthier Program to reduce TV watching started in California, Michigan school districts 
### STEPHANIE FAGLIANO STAFF WRITER 
With technological advances in the entertainment in
dustry, it seems unlikely that students will cut back on the
time they spend watching TV and playing video games.
But that is exactly what is taking place in school districts
around the globe thanks to a program designed by Stan
ford researchers.
Tom Robinson, associate professor of pediatrics and
of internal medicine at Stanford, is the University's prin
cipal researcher behind the Stanford Student Media
Awareness to Reduce Television (SMART) curriculum.
The curriculum was provided for third and fourth
grade children from two public elementary schools in
San Jose of similar demographic and scholastic composi
tion. A trial period was conducted between September
19% and April 1997.
These students were challenged to do without televi
sion for 10 days, then to limit themselves to just seven
hours per week.
Students in one of the two elementary schools re
ceived 18 lessons over the course of a six month curricu
lum to reduce television, videotape and videogame use.
The study showed that the students receiving the ad
ditional instruction experienced a decrease in their body
mass index. Using this information, the researchers were
able to conclude that reducing television, videotape and
videogame use may be a promising approach to prevent
childhood obesity.
This change, researchers said, could be explained by
the increase in exercise children received when they
found new ways to spend their time.
An article in The San Francisco Chronicle reported
that students in the study found activities to replace
watching TV, including reading, playing outside with
friends and riding bikes. The community became more
involved in helping children find alternate outlets as
other schools within the district began to participate.The
YMCA offered free temporary memberships and the
city library organized various games and classes.

Are Stanford students watching too much TV? Study
shows reducing TV time increases exercise, reduces
childhood obesity and cuts down on aggression.
In addition to children spending
more time on healthy activities, the
study also found that reducing the
hours spent watching television is a
promising approach to decrease
the influences advertising has on
behavior.
Robinson said he was pleased
with the program's success.

"lt is very exciting to see the
fruits of our research disseminated
and used in schools throughout the
country, as well as some other
countries," Robinson told The
Daily.
School districts in Michigan
have now adopted this curriculum
in response to violent behavior.
"The Michigan school districts
recently heard about the effects of
the program on aggressive behav
ior, and I believe that was their pri
mary interest." Robinson said.
"Observers charted aggressive

playground incidents — shoving,
hitting, obscene gestures, name
calling — at eight elementary
schools immediately before and
after the program," The Chronicle
reported. "The totals dropped at
every school but one."
The average decline was 52 per
cent.
"Students in Michigan's school
districts enrolled in the program
exhibited less aggressive and dis
tracting behaviors at school,"
Robinson said. "Administrators
were so enthusiastic about the pro

gram that they sponsored a nation
al conference last spring and plan
another for April."
The district also compared
scores of fourth-graders who took
standardized tests while participat
ing in the TV-free challenge in Jan
uary 2005 with scores of fourth
graders who tested before the
adoption of the SMART curricu
lum. Math and writing scores made
double-digit increases.
Administrators were more than
satisfied with the results of the cur
riculum. These were "even more

positive results than we'd hoped
for," Kristine Paulsen, the district's
general education director, told
The Chronicle.
This satisfaction may help ex
plain why the program has become
increasingly popular. More school
districts are encouraged to consid
er implementing SMART.
"The curriculum is available to
any school district or teacher who
is interested through the Stanford
Health Promotion Resource Cen
ter at http://noTV.stanford.edu."
Robinson said.

Back at Stanford, a current goal
of SMART developers is to focus
on future results rather than the
immediate outcomes of the study.
"Stanford researchers are
studying the program's long-term
effects in California," Robinson
said,"but they haven't reported re
sults."
In the meantime, the SMART
curriculum is spreading and be
coming more widely advertised,
with benefits for health, academic
performance and behavior becom
ing more and more apparent.
