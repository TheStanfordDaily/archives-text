## Stanford must fight 'Don't Ask' 
### MICHAEL ANGELO SPENCER JONES 
As members of the LGBT community at Stanford
Law School, we are deeply disappointed with the
U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Rumsfeld vs.
FAIR. The Court upheld the Solomon Amendment,
which compels educational institutions to provide "equal
access" to military recruiters notwithstanding the mili
tary's blatantly discriminatory "Don't Ask, Don't Tell"
policy (DADT). Now more than ever, affirmative action
is required by our policymakers and University adminis
trators to confront DADT and end this pernicious policy
of discrimination against gays, lesbians and bisexuals.
The outcome of this case does not come as a surprise,
but the Court's opinion is still a disappointment. The
opinion concentrates on the technicalities and logistics of
on-campus recruiting in order to avoid deciding thornier
free speech issues. It sidesteps addressing the critical
issue: that the military is being allowed to run roughshod
over the nondiscrimination policies of numerous univer
sities and law schools — striking a powerful blow to the
equality efforts of the LGBT community on these cam
puses. The Federal Government's use of its spending and
military powers by way of the Solomon Amendment —
though technically constitutional according to this opin
ion — is shameful and runs counter to our nation's inter
est in staffing our military with "the best and the bright
est," especially in a time of war.
Ultimately, the heart of this issue is not the Solomon
Amendment itself, but rather the military's discriminato
ry DADT policy. DADT runs afoul of most law schools'
non-discrimination policies for on-campus recruiters be
cause of the way it excludes lesbians and gays. It has re
sulted in the discharge of literally thousands of otherwise
able men and women from serving in the armed forces —
and prevented countless thousands more from joining
the military in the first place — simply because they are
gay. Numerous opinion polls,conducted by organizations
ranging from Gallup to Fox News, have repeatedly shown
that the majority of Americans believe DADT to be out
dated and unwise. If the military truly wants "the best and
the brightest," it would do away with its own discrimina
tory practices rather than compel educational institu
tions to accept them.
Here at Stanford the disappointment with the
Supreme Court decision is only aggravated by the dis
turbing incapacity of and continued non-response by our
University administration with respect to this issue. Stan
ford has denounced neither the Solomon Amendment

nor the military's DADT policy despite consistent prod
ding to do so. Several Stanford law students met with
President John Hennessy last November following a spir
ited demonstration against the Navy JAG Corp's inter
viewing at the Law School. We addressed Stanford's lack
of support for its LGBT students in its failure to support
FAIR in the Solomon litigation — despite the fact that its
peer institutions had done so — and by maintaining a
University-wide nondiscrimination policy that only ex
cludes employers who practice "unlawful" discrimina
tion. This policy provides an open invitation for the mili
tary to recruit on Stanford's campus and to discriminate
against LGBT students because the military's brand of
discrimination is technically "lawful." A petition with 150
signatures from the Law School community endorsed a
change in the administration's posture, as did over 1(K)
personal emails to Hennessy. Our shared message was
simple: discrimination is discrimination, unlawful or not.
As an institution that professes inclusion and accept
ance of LGBT students, we had hoped that even if Stan
ford would not turn down the receipt of federal funds in
the face of the Solomon Amendment, it would at least
take an affirmative stand against discrimination by the
military on the basis of sexual orientation. Unfortunate
ly, to this date Stanford has not taken such a stand, and
Hennessy's utter failure to even respond to our requests
has left many on this campus saddened and frustrated.
We believe, given the Supreme Court's decision, that
now is the time for Stanford and her peer institutions to
directly engage the wrongs of DADT and throw their
support resolutely behind new policies, such as the Fed
eral Military Readiness Enhancement Act, which has 110
co-sponsors in the U.S. House of Representatives and
would end the military's discrimination against gays and
lesbians. It is time for Stanford to review its nondiscrimi
nation policy for on-campus recruiters and close the
loophole that allows employers who discriminate against
gays and lesbians to do so unchallenged. And it is time for
Hennessy and our administration to publicly and un
equivocally demonstrate their loyalty to gay and lesbian
students in the face of a government and a society that in
sists on perpetuating discrimination against them by
speaking out on this issue. If universities cannot enforce
nondiscrimination inside their own walls, they can and
must work to end discrimination outside of them.

support resolutely behind new policies, such as the Fed
eral Military Readiness Enhancement Act, which has 110
co-sponsors in the U.S. House of Representatives and
would end the military's discrimination against gays and
lesbians. It is time for Stanford to review its nondiscrimi
nation policy for on-campus recruiters and close the
loophole that allows employers who discriminate against
gays and lesbians to do so unchallenged. And it is time for
Hennessy and our administration to publicly and un
equivocally demonstrate their loyalty to gay and lesbian
students in the face of a government and a society that in
sists on perpetuating discrimination against them by
speaking out on this issue. If universities cannot enforce
nondiscrimination inside their own walls, they can and
must work to end discrimination outside of them.
