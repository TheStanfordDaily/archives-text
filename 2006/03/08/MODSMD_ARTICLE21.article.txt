## SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING Synchro going for repeat of national title Sophomore Olympian Sara Lowe fries to lead the Card to an undefeated season 
### JOHN CHOCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
What does it take to defend a national title?
For nine Stanford women, it takes rolling back the plastic
covers on the pool at 5:45 in the morning.
" I he moon was up when we got here," sophomore co-cap
tain Sara Lowe said after a morning practice. "It was dark
when we left the pool last night. We joked that we should've
just stayed here."
And then there's the swimming. Underwater,or nearly out
of the water, or catapulting above the surface.
' What they do is like running the hurdles," Coach Heather
Olson says of her undefeated synchronized swimmers.
"While holding your breath."
When they do come up for air. it had better be with a smile,
a flourish and wide-open eyes — but don't mistake synchro
for water ballet. ITiese swimmers can tread water upside
down, and keep their legs and hips high and dry in a spinning
split kick. They can rise and sink in a twirling "rocket" to a
beat, legs perfectly straight and toes pointed. In a split sec
ond, the team can fall into a pinwheel formation, or a
chevron, or a zipper that looks like an aquatic moonwalk.
"It's also a little like gymnastics in the water," Olson ex
plains. "Ihe same explosive power and tight control — but
without the benefit of anything to push off."
A synchronized swimming meet consists of four events: a
trio, a duet, a solo and an eight-woman team program. In nine
meets this year, the Cardinal have yet to drop a single event.
Their next challenge is to defend their 2005 crown at the Col
legiate Nationals March 23-25. Stanford is hosting the Cham
pionships this year, and the meet will mark only the second
time this season the Cardinal have competed at home.
"Especially because it's here at home, it would be the
worst thing ever to lose that title," sophomore Poppy Carlig
said, with a laugh. "But 1 don't think that's going to happen."
Olson is more cautious about making predictions, but ex
pects the team's best performance yet.
"I don't say perfect," she said. "But I know I'll see a really
energetic, mistake-free swim at the Nationals."
And that's hardly a bold prediction, as energetic and flaw
less have been par for the course all season. At Nationals
though, Stanford will unveil a modified team routine with
added elements and increased difficulty.
"Our routine is a lot stronger," Lowe said. "I thought we
were in a really good place to begin with, but I think these
changes are really going to give us the extra edge and put us
over the top."
Those changes include a modified final lap and a sequence
of impressive lifts. For the lifts, the Cardinal stack up under
water, and use their combined force to throw one or even two
of the swimmers up and over the surface of the pool.
"It's definitely more difficult than last year's routine,"
Lowe said.
Lowe, a 2004 Olympian, is undefeated this season in solo
performances and will swim the solo, the team program and a
duet with sophomore Courtenay Stewart, also an Olympian,
at the championship meet. When the team huddles at the side
of the pool before a practice run, it is her voice that steadies
the laughter and rallies the weary stragglers.
"I give the team a scenario before every swim," Lowe ex
plains.
"Last year I was really intimidated," Carlig says of her first
encounter with Lowe. "She went to Athens — she and
Courtenay both — and I was kind of nervous to swim with
her because she's really, really good. But she's a great cap
tain."
As a member of the U.S. National Team, Carlig certainly
qualifies "really really good" herself. She, Lowe, Stewart and
sophomores Hilary Homenko. Missy Knight and Katie Nor
ris were called the strongest recruiting class in the history of
collegiate synchronized swimming when they came to Stan-
