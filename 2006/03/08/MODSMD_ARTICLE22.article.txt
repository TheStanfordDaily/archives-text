lot of pressure on Stanford to try to sal
vage the event. Sophomore Sho
Nakamori posted a solid 9.35 to place sec
ond in the event after Michigan's Luke
Bottke. Senior Sean Doolan tied for
fourth with a 9.25.
Stanford's presentation on the pom
mel horse, traditionally a problem area,
proved to be their most solid perform
ance to date. Junior Brice Rolston led a

sweep of the top five finishes with a 9.05.
Senior, Nate Downs hit a clean set to fol
low in second with an 8.95, and Nakamori
posted an 8.5 to finish third despite a slop
py dismount.
Junior Alex Schorsch posted a season
best of 9.75 on rings, topping his previous
season best of 9.7 and kicking off another
sweep for Stanford. The Cardinal's im
pressive 38.05 on the rings was the team's
best this season.
"The ringnien were extraordinary,"
head coach Thom Glielnii said. "What re
ally sets this ring team apart is they all
hold their strength skills for a legitimate
three seconds each. Other teams may

have one guy — we've got six."
Sophomore Chris I larper led Stanford
on another sweep of the top-three finish
es on the parallel bars, nabbing first with
an 8.9.1 hidden and Shen tied for second
place with 8.5, while Downs came in fifth
with an 8.35.
Carney posted a 9.65 on high bar to
tally his second individual win of the
evening. Downs followed close behind
with a 9.5 to take second.
Sophomore David Sender was in
Philadelphia last weekend representing
the U.S. in the American Cup, where he
placed fifth.
As a young team, Stanford has bridged

many of the small gaps that separate indi
vidual talent from a seamless team effort.
"Although our team may have been
physically capable of this score, we were
not mentally ready until now," Shen said.
"There is a world of difference in hitting
your sets in practice, and bringing it to the
meet. Our confidence levels have been
building throughout the season as we
train and compete more and more."
The Cardinal travels to face top
ranked Oklahoma for one final dual meet

Federation Championships in Colorado
