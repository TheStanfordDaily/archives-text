# "When my matches get close, its hard to channel people out."
## 
### BY MIA LEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Daily's new series, "Through
My Eyes," continues this week with
some pearls of wisdom from freshman
tennis player Blake Muller. Currently
holding a 6-1 record, the No. 12 men's
team has already weathered some nail
biting ups and downs, including a pair of
4-3 wins over critically acclaimed
Southern California and UCLA.
And without further ado, here's
Blake:
Frenzied freshmen
We have four freshmen on the team
this year, and Matt [Bruch] and I are
two members of the starting lineup. I
hang out with Matt quite a bit, since he
lives across from me in J-Ro. We've be
come good friends, and he's an awe
some player (currently the highest
ranked freshman in the country]. Being
one of the starting players can get in
tense, especially when we play the
tougher schools. We suffered our first
lost last week, to Baylor. In fact, we've
never beaten Baylor.
We lost two seniors from last year,
Sam [Warburg] and Phil [Sheng],so it's
been important that we step up to fill
those crucial spots. With a lot of hard
work, we're rising back up to where
we've been in previous years. We've had
a rewarding season so far, getting in
some big wins.'lTie winning is great, but
even so. it's the losing that provides per
petual motivation.
When we got handed the 1-5 loss by
Baylor, yeah, you could make excuses
about the rain delays, or KC [being in

jured] and everyone having to play up a
notch. Instead, I feel inspired, like
there's always something [you] can do
to be improving.
Fanning the lan cluh flames
I was impressed that five people
made it up to SF to watch that match.
It's awesome, the people here are so
nice, and I love having people come out
and support me. It makes tennis so
much more fun; the lively atmosphere
you get in college tennis isn't something
you get to experience in the juniors or
elsewhere.
But I have to admit, when my match
es get really close, it's hard to channel
people out. Recently, playing No. 4 and
5. I've been playing in a position to win
the match for Stanford. I try not to think
about it too much during play — I
could lose but the team could still win.
That said, when the matches go to a
third set, I can feel the nerves set in a lit
tle bit. I have a tendency to take the first
set without a problem and then struggle
some, so it's just something I'll have to
work on.
Over the years, I've been used to just
getting down to business and playing
my game. As I play more and more
matches here, I'll be able to better han
dle the crowd enthusiasm.
Why Stanford?
Why not? When looking at colleges,
I knew right away that I wanted to stay
in California. I chose Stanford in the
end because I really liked the guys on
the team and the coaching staff. I'll for
give my coach [head coach John
Whitlinger] for starting the "Win a Date

with Blake" contest. During the half
time show at our matches, our announc
er Jimmy [Lin] has been offering the
date to anyone who can throw a tennis
ball into a basket or something...l think
it's a shopping cart. I'm never actually
on the court at that time, but I heard no
one has won yet.
Coach said it to me as a joke, so I
thought he was kidding until it actually
happened. If anyone wins, I'd go on the
date, you know. Okay, 1 actually have a
few requirements: please be out of high
school, and, say, under 40.
Learning the Ropes
I look up to the juniors and the sen
iors on the team, there's definitely men
torship going on there. Everyone looks
up to KC [Corkery], the captain. He
provides a lot of support during training
and practice. He can get very intense,
but it's his personality, and it keeps
everyone focused. James [Wan] is a jun
ior and the class act. He's always on the
courts talking, pulling antics — even
prompting a spectator to yell out,
"Show some love, James!" He may get
into trouble sometimes, but he's good
natured and an easy going guy.
As a freshman, I'm still trying to fig
ure out my role. I'm easy going. I can get
along with most personalities. Right
now. I'm just having fun and trying to
get more involved in my dorm. I have
no idea what my major will be, and
when I get a little bit of downtime, it's
fun to hang out with the men's team. We
don't hang out as much as the women's
team, I don't think, but the upperclass
men take us out to dinner a lot — usu
ally pizza or sushi.
