# Barry's on the juice? Who cares?
## 
### 
Iwoke up yesterday morning and
carried out my daily ritual of
opening my computer and going
to ESPN.com. Not surprisingly, the
lead story was about a book coming
out by two San Francisco Chronicle
writers, Mark Fainaru-Wada and
Lance Williams, detailing the alleged
steroid use by Barry Bonds.
The two have gone through thou
sands of pages of testimony, inter
views, and reports and have conclud
ed that Bonds used steroids for at
least five seasons, from 1998-2002.
1 am not 100 percent sure that
these allegations are entirely true.
After all, nothing sells books better
than sliming the best player who has
ever lived. But, true or not, I have
one thing to say: "Who cares?"
Today, steroid usage is as impor
tant and integrated part of the game
as the Wild Card playoff spot, inter
league play and the designated hitter
all modern changes that we've come
to accept. And while steroids are not
a sanctioned part of the game, they
likely are one of the reasons that the
game is as entertaining as it is today.
The hypocrisy begins with the
value that has been placed on the
homerun. For fans, there are few
plays more exciting in baseball than
the homerun. Mark MaGwire and
Sammy Sosa's homerun race in 1998
single-handedly rejuvenated a game
that was struggling following the
strike and cancellation of the World
Series in 1994. Without steroids,
would baseball have recovered?
Probably not, and definitely not as
quickly as it did.
We encourage fielders when they
lay out for a fly ball, or hitters to
"take one for the team", yet we are
upset that they are damaging their
bodies in the name of hitting more
homeruns and making the game
more exciting.
And the argument that American
thinks steroids are a problem be
cause of their long-term health ef
fects on their users is absolute hog
wash. Look to our nation's most pop
ular sport, the NFL. There, the aver
age offensive lineman weighs well
over 300 pounds, and, as a result, has
a life expectancy of just 52, or 26
years shorter than the average
American male. This loss of life is far
more than anything steroids might
ever produce, yet Congress is not on
the verge of launching a national cru
sade on the NFL.
Then there is the more controver
sial issue of legitimacy of statistics.
But I believe the point is somewhat
moot, because, with or without
steroids, it is still meaningless to com
pare statistics in our current era to
those of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and
even Hank Aaron.
The game of baseball has evolved
dramatically over the last 1 (X) years,
and steroids are just a fraction of the

overall change. The mound has risen
and fallen, and the designated hitter,
the lengthening of the season, expan
sion, free agency, the luxury tax, the
juicing of the ball and the Coors Field
Effect are just a few of countless
other notable changes.
Each of these alterations to the
structure of baseball has resulted in
dramatic changes in success of the
hitters and the stats they have accu
mulated.
And it is not like this most recent
spree of steroid use is the first time
that drugs in sports have been in
issue. After all. Sports Illustrated ran
a cover reading "DRUGS —
A THREAT TO SPORTS." — in
June 1969.
Ball Four, one of the most influ
ential and important sports books of
all time, carefully documents play
ers' use of amphetamines or "gree
nies" to enhance their performance
on game days for the past thirty
years. For generations in baseball,
this was an issue that was simply
swept under the rug. Yet today, we
are attacking athletes who have
never tested positive for any type of
drug and have never broken the
rules of baseball.
To be clear, I don't endorse
steroids. While it is true that many
people look at me and automatically
assume that I am juiced up, I would
never dream of touching the stuff. I
hate to think that athletes are doing
permanent and serious damage to
their bodies in the name of entertain

ments.
But the fact of the matter is that it
is time to move on. Most athletes are
(or, at least, should be) responsible
adults capable of making their own
decisions. If they are not breaking
any rules, they can do what they
want. The recent allegations against
Bonds are from a time when steroids
were not banned by the league. Obvi
ously, a positive test today is a differ
ent story.
One of the strongest arguments
against steroids is that players taking
them today will encourage youth
athletes to take them to stay in com
petitive. It is a vicious cycle. But ath
letes are not role models, no matter
what the United Way commercials
try to portray. We hear about athletes
and their on- and off-field transgres
sions every day. The sad truth is, if
you're emulating the average athlete,
and you don't have the safety net of
being great at a sport, you will proba
bly end up cheering the Yankees on
from Sing Sing.
I am looking forward to a time
when we don't have to hear about
steroids every time baseball is dis
cussed. It will be a happy day when
we can go through an entire Spring
Training and not have to deal with
another breaking story about an ath
lete using drugs, when, in reality, they
all probably do it. It is time to move
on and pick another story, not just
one that sells books.
I won't hold my breath.

Alex Gyr is a junior who claims it was
just flaxseed oil. And judging by his
fetus-like upper-body strength, that's
probably true. Pro-lifers, complain the
analogy is cruel to the unborn at

cause of their long-term health ef
fects on their users is absolute hog
wash. Look to our nation's most pop
ular sport, the NFL. There, the aver
age offensive lineman weighs well
over 300 pounds, and, as a result, has
a life expectancy of just 52, or 26
years shorter than the average
American male. This loss of life is far
more than anything steroids might
ever produce, yet Congress is not on
the verge of launching a national cru
sade on the NFL.
Then there is the more controver
sial issue of legitimacy of statistics.
But I believe the point is somewhat
moot, because, with or without
steroids, it is still meaningless to com
pare statistics in our current era to
those of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and
even Hank Aaron.
The game of baseball has evolved
dramatically over the last 1 (X) years,
and steroids are just a fraction of the

overall change. The mound has risen
and fallen, and the designated hitter,
the lengthening of the season, expan
sion, free agency, the luxury tax, the
juicing of the ball and the Coors Field
Effect are just a few of countless
other notable changes.
Each of these alterations to the
structure of baseball has resulted in
dramatic changes in success of the
hitters and the stats they have accu
mulated.
And it is not like this most recent
spree of steroid use is the first time
that drugs in sports have been in
issue. After all. Sports Illustrated ran
a cover reading "DRUGS —
A THREAT TO SPORTS." — in
June 1969.
Ball Four, one of the most influ
ential and important sports books of
all time, carefully documents play
ers' use of amphetamines or "gree
nies" to enhance their performance
on game days for the past thirty
years. For generations in baseball,
this was an issue that was simply
swept under the rug. Yet today, we
are attacking athletes who have
never tested positive for any type of
drug and have never broken the
rules of baseball.
To be clear, I don't endorse
steroids. While it is true that many
people look at me and automatically
assume that I am juiced up, I would
never dream of touching the stuff. I
hate to think that athletes are doing
permanent and serious damage to
their bodies in the name of entertain

ments.
But the fact of the matter is that it
is time to move on. Most athletes are
(or, at least, should be) responsible
adults capable of making their own
decisions. If they are not breaking
any rules, they can do what they
want. The recent allegations against
Bonds are from a time when steroids
were not banned by the league. Obvi
ously, a positive test today is a differ
ent story.
One of the strongest arguments
against steroids is that players taking
them today will encourage youth
athletes to take them to stay in com
petitive. It is a vicious cycle. But ath
letes are not role models, no matter
what the United Way commercials
try to portray. We hear about athletes
and their on- and off-field transgres
sions every day. The sad truth is, if
you're emulating the average athlete,
and you don't have the safety net of
being great at a sport, you will proba
bly end up cheering the Yankees on
from Sing Sing.
I am looking forward to a time
when we don't have to hear about
steroids every time baseball is dis
cussed. It will be a happy day when
we can go through an entire Spring
Training and not have to deal with
another breaking story about an ath
lete using drugs, when, in reality, they
all probably do it. It is time to move
on and pick another story, not just
one that sells books.
I won't hold my breath.

Alex Gyr is a junior who claims it was
just flaxseed oil. And judging by his
fetus-like upper-body strength, that's
probably true. Pro-lifers, complain the
analogy is cruel to the unborn at

Iwoke up yesterday morning and
carried out my daily ritual of
opening my computer and going
to ESPN.com. Not surprisingly, the
lead story was about a book coming
out by two San Francisco Chronicle
writers, Mark Fainaru-Wada and
Lance Williams, detailing the alleged
steroid use by Barry Bonds.
The two have gone through thou
sands of pages of testimony, inter
views, and reports and have conclud
ed that Bonds used steroids for at
least five seasons, from 1998-2002.
1 am not 100 percent sure that
these allegations are entirely true.
After all, nothing sells books better
than sliming the best player who has
ever lived. But, true or not, I have
one thing to say: "Who cares?"
Today, steroid usage is as impor
tant and integrated part of the game
as the Wild Card playoff spot, inter
league play and the designated hitter
all modern changes that we've come
to accept. And while steroids are not
a sanctioned part of the game, they
likely are one of the reasons that the
game is as entertaining as it is today.
The hypocrisy begins with the
value that has been placed on the
homerun. For fans, there are few
plays more exciting in baseball than
the homerun. Mark MaGwire and
Sammy Sosa's homerun race in 1998
single-handedly rejuvenated a game
that was struggling following the
strike and cancellation of the World
Series in 1994. Without steroids,
would baseball have recovered?
Probably not, and definitely not as
quickly as it did.
We encourage fielders when they
lay out for a fly ball, or hitters to
"take one for the team", yet we are
upset that they are damaging their
bodies in the name of hitting more
homeruns and making the game
more exciting.
And the argument that American
thinks steroids are a problem be
cause of their long-term health ef
fects on their users is absolute hog
wash. Look to our nation's most pop
ular sport, the NFL. There, the aver
age offensive lineman weighs well
