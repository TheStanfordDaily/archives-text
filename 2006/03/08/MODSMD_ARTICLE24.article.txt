# Barry's on the juice? Who cares?
## 
### 
Iwoke up yesterday morning and
carried out my daily ritual of
opening my computer and going
to ESPN.com. Not surprisingly, the
lead story was about a book coming
out by two San Francisco Chronicle
writers, Mark Fainaru-Wada and
Lance Williams, detailing the alleged
steroid use by Barry Bonds.
The two have gone through thou
sands of pages of testimony, inter
views, and reports and have conclud
ed that Bonds used steroids for at
least five seasons, from 1998-2002.
1 am not 100 percent sure that
these allegations are entirely true.
After all, nothing sells books better
than sliming the best player who has
ever lived. But, true or not, I have
one thing to say: "Who cares?"
Today, steroid usage is as impor
tant and integrated part of the game
as the Wild Card playoff spot, inter
league play and the designated hitter
all modern changes that we've come
to accept. And while steroids are not
a sanctioned part of the game, they
likely are one of the reasons that the
game is as entertaining as it is today.
The hypocrisy begins with the
value that has been placed on the
homerun. For fans, there are few
plays more exciting in baseball than
the homerun. Mark MaGwire and
Sammy Sosa's homerun race in 1998
single-handedly rejuvenated a game
that was struggling following the
strike and cancellation of the World
Series in 1994. Without steroids,
would baseball have recovered?
Probably not, and definitely not as
quickly as it did.
We encourage fielders when they
lay out for a fly ball, or hitters to
"take one for the team", yet we are
upset that they are damaging their
bodies in the name of hitting more
homeruns and making the game
more exciting.
And the argument that American
thinks steroids are a problem be
cause of their long-term health ef
fects on their users is absolute hog
wash. Look to our nation's most pop
ular sport, the NFL. There, the aver
age offensive lineman weighs well
over 300 pounds, and, as a result, has
a life expectancy of just 52, or 26
years shorter than the average
American male. This loss of life is far
more than anything steroids might
ever produce, yet Congress is not on
the verge of launching a national cru
sade on the NFL.
Then there is the more controver
sial issue of legitimacy of statistics.
But I believe the point is somewhat
moot, because, with or without
steroids, it is still meaningless to com
pare statistics in our current era to
those of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and
even Hank Aaron.
The game of baseball has evolved
dramatically over the last 1 (X) years,
and steroids are just a fraction of the
