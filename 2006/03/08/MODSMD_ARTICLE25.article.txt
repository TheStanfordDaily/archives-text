# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Men don't win a game at BYU in pair of losses 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
Facing the prospect of two matches at the No. 1
team in nation, 4,5(X) feet above sea level no less, the
members of the Stanford men's volleyball team knew
they were facing an uphill battle.
The Cardinal were swept by No. 1 BYU both nights
this weekend. But they proved that they would not go
out without a fight, holding on to the bitter end.
The Cougars (14-2,12-2 MPSF) blasted the Cardi
nal (4-16,2-12) to start the weekend, but, in the grudge
match, Stanford showed the tenacity and intensity
that it has been lacking for much of the season. Al
though they did not win a game all weekend, the Card
have momentum which they hope will carry them
through their upcoming three-week home stand as
the end of the season and the MPSF tournament
loom.
"With the level of play that BYU gave us and the
way that we adjusted, we were really
playing better at the end of the week
end than at the beginning," head
coach Don Shaw said. "We don't al
ways bring it Monday through Thurs
day like we do the weekend, but hope
fully we can practice this week with
that enthusiasm and intensity and it
can continue into the weekend."
As he has all season, senior oppo
site Ben Reddy spearheaded the
Cardinal offense in Utah with 13 kills
on Friday and 12 on Saturday. Play
ing in only two games Saturday.soph
omore Jesse Meredith also tallied 12
kills while hitting .733.
The Cardinal had some trouble at
the net. notching only a pair of blocks
on Friday, but they matched the
Cougars with six on Saturday. Senior
middle blocker Chris Ahlfeldt was in
on four of those blocks to lead the
team. In the back row, Ahlfeldt
recorded a team-high seven digs on
the weekend.
After having trouble from the
service line Friday, serving was the
only category in which Stanford out
performed BYU on Saturday. The
Cardinal recorded four aces in the
second matchup to the Cougars' two.
Freshman setter Miki Groppi had a
pair, and Reddy and Meredith
chipped in one apiece.
"it's tough at altitude — the serv
ing and passing are affected." Shaw
said. "We started out not serving very
well, but we started to adjust.The ball

tends to float a little at high altitude
— it gets going fast, and when they
serve it at you it seems like it gets
there a split-second sooner."
While the Cardinal struggled to
adjust, BYU got off to a quick start
Friday and never looked back. Stan
ford managed a respectable .238 hit
ting percentage, but the Cougars hit
an other-worldly .800 in the first
game with 20 kills and no errors. The
Cardinal won the first two points and
stayed close until the middle of the
game, when BYU stretched a 10-9
lead to 20-11. BYU's Yosleyder Cala
— a 22-year-old freshman and four
year veteran of the Cuban national
team — hit .857 with no errors to
lead his team to the 30-16 win.
"When they have their best guys
in there, they are a very, very good
team." Shaw said. "We didn't have
much of a chance against them."
Stanford came closer in the sec
ond game but still could not compete
with the Cougars. BYU's hitting per
centage dropped to .467, but the Car
dinal could only put the ball down 10
times, hitting .171 as a team. The
teams traded points early, but BYU
pulled ahead at 11-10 and held on for
the 30-23 game victory.
Stanford's offense continued to
struggle in the third game, with only
eight team kills on .087 hitting. The
Cougars also had a relatively unpro
ductive offensive game, but their .370
hitting was still better than the Cardi
nal's best effort of the night. BYU
built a six-point lead early and
cruised to win the third game, 30-23.
The next night, it was more of the
same, with BYU once again opening
the match on fire. While BYU hit .762

in the first game, Stanford struggled
to stay in the black, hitting .034 as a
team. The Cardinal trailed by seven
midway through the game, and the
deficit continued to grow as they
proved powerless to stop BYU's hit
ters. With only a single hitting error,
the Cougars swept to an easy 30-15
win.
Shaw began to change his lineup,
giving playing time to his bench, until
he finally hit upon a lineup that
clicked.
"The level of play is just drastical
ly different," Shaw said. "They have a
ton of experience in top internation
al volleyball on that team and it took
us a little while. After playing four or
five games with them, we finally start
ed to adjust and the group started to
play well together."
Stanford rebounded from the first
game loss and came painfully close to
winning the second game before
falling, 33-31. Stanford used a five
point run to take the 16-15 lead, their
first of the night, but fell behind
again. After battling back, the Cardi
nal squandered two game points and
the Cougars converted on their first
chance, taking a two-games-to-none
advantage.
"[The close score] was a combina
tion of us playing better and them
getting out of sync," Shaw said. "It's
hard to maintain your play when the
other team is not doing well. I think
we lulled them to sleep a little bit and
then came back."
The Cardinal did not give up the
fight in the third game, once again
forcing the Cougars into extra points.
But once again, they came up just
short, losing 32-30. Stanford held the

lead for most of the game, but let the
Cougars clawed back late.The Cardi
nal fought off one match point, but
could not stop BYU on their next
chance. The Cardinal offense had
their best game of the weekend, hit
ting .448. But BYU's .500 was just
good enough to make the difference.
After their third road trip in four
weeks, the Cardinal host No. 8 UC-
Santa Barbara (10-9, 7-7) and No. 6
Cal State Northridge (10-7, 6-6) on
Friday and Saturday, the first of three
weekends at home for the squad.
The Gauchos swept the Cardinal
in their first meeting this season and
are coming off a win over UC-San
Diego. Santa Barbara's win over San
Diego came after a five-game loss to
No. 5 Long Beach State that snapped
their three-game winning streak. Ju
nior Evan Patak leads UCSB with
299 kills (5.54 per game) and 38 serv
ice aces (0.70 per game).
After dropping a series to No. 4
Hawaii, the Matadors upset Long
Beach and swept UCSD last week
end. Freshman outside hitter Eric
Vance earned MPSF Player of the
Week honors after leading the squad
with 42 kills in the two matches.
The scheduling of the remainder
of the season will allow a road-weary
Cardinal squad to spend all of Dead
Week and finals on campus, a wel
come break.
"We have been doing a lot of trav
eling lately and seen a lot of weather
changes," Shaw said. "We've been on
different trips with snow and all. It's
been interesting, but it will be nice to
be able to stay home and not be living
in and out of suitcases and hotel
rooms."

the end of the season and the MPSF tournament
loom.
"With the level of play that BYU gave us and the
way that we adjusted, we were really
playing better at the end of the week
end than at the beginning," head
coach Don Shaw said. "We don't al
ways bring it Monday through Thurs
day like we do the weekend, but hope
fully we can practice this week with
that enthusiasm and intensity and it
can continue into the weekend."
As he has all season, senior oppo
site Ben Reddy spearheaded the
Cardinal offense in Utah with 13 kills
on Friday and 12 on Saturday. Play
ing in only two games Saturday.soph
omore Jesse Meredith also tallied 12
kills while hitting .733.
The Cardinal had some trouble at
the net. notching only a pair of blocks
on Friday, but they matched the
Cougars with six on Saturday. Senior
middle blocker Chris Ahlfeldt was in
on four of those blocks to lead the
team. In the back row, Ahlfeldt
recorded a team-high seven digs on
the weekend.
After having trouble from the
service line Friday, serving was the
only category in which Stanford out
performed BYU on Saturday. The
Cardinal recorded four aces in the
second matchup to the Cougars' two.
Freshman setter Miki Groppi had a
pair, and Reddy and Meredith
chipped in one apiece.
"it's tough at altitude — the serv
ing and passing are affected." Shaw
said. "We started out not serving very
well, but we started to adjust.The ball

tends to float a little at high altitude
— it gets going fast, and when they
serve it at you it seems like it gets
there a split-second sooner."
While the Cardinal struggled to
adjust, BYU got off to a quick start
Friday and never looked back. Stan
ford managed a respectable .238 hit
ting percentage, but the Cougars hit
an other-worldly .800 in the first
game with 20 kills and no errors. The
Cardinal won the first two points and
stayed close until the middle of the
game, when BYU stretched a 10-9
lead to 20-11. BYU's Yosleyder Cala
— a 22-year-old freshman and four
year veteran of the Cuban national
team — hit .857 with no errors to
lead his team to the 30-16 win.
"When they have their best guys
in there, they are a very, very good
team." Shaw said. "We didn't have
much of a chance against them."
Stanford came closer in the sec
ond game but still could not compete
with the Cougars. BYU's hitting per
centage dropped to .467, but the Car
dinal could only put the ball down 10
times, hitting .171 as a team. The
teams traded points early, but BYU
pulled ahead at 11-10 and held on for
the 30-23 game victory.
Stanford's offense continued to
struggle in the third game, with only
eight team kills on .087 hitting. The
Cougars also had a relatively unpro
ductive offensive game, but their .370
hitting was still better than the Cardi
nal's best effort of the night. BYU
built a six-point lead early and
cruised to win the third game, 30-23.
The next night, it was more of the
same, with BYU once again opening
the match on fire. While BYU hit .762

in the first game, Stanford struggled
to stay in the black, hitting .034 as a
team. The Cardinal trailed by seven
midway through the game, and the
deficit continued to grow as they
proved powerless to stop BYU's hit
ters. With only a single hitting error,
the Cougars swept to an easy 30-15
win.
Shaw began to change his lineup,
giving playing time to his bench, until
he finally hit upon a lineup that
clicked.
"The level of play is just drastical
ly different," Shaw said. "They have a
ton of experience in top internation
al volleyball on that team and it took
us a little while. After playing four or
five games with them, we finally start
ed to adjust and the group started to
play well together."
Stanford rebounded from the first
game loss and came painfully close to
winning the second game before
falling, 33-31. Stanford used a five
point run to take the 16-15 lead, their
first of the night, but fell behind
again. After battling back, the Cardi
nal squandered two game points and
the Cougars converted on their first
chance, taking a two-games-to-none
advantage.
"[The close score] was a combina
tion of us playing better and them
getting out of sync," Shaw said. "It's
hard to maintain your play when the
other team is not doing well. I think
we lulled them to sleep a little bit and
then came back."
The Cardinal did not give up the
fight in the third game, once again
forcing the Cougars into extra points.
But once again, they came up just
short, losing 32-30. Stanford held the

lead for most of the game, but let the
Cougars clawed back late.The Cardi
nal fought off one match point, but
could not stop BYU on their next
chance. The Cardinal offense had
their best game of the weekend, hit
ting .448. But BYU's .500 was just
good enough to make the difference.
After their third road trip in four
weeks, the Cardinal host No. 8 UC-
Santa Barbara (10-9, 7-7) and No. 6
Cal State Northridge (10-7, 6-6) on
Friday and Saturday, the first of three
weekends at home for the squad.
The Gauchos swept the Cardinal
in their first meeting this season and
are coming off a win over UC-San
Diego. Santa Barbara's win over San
Diego came after a five-game loss to
No. 5 Long Beach State that snapped
their three-game winning streak. Ju
nior Evan Patak leads UCSB with
299 kills (5.54 per game) and 38 serv
ice aces (0.70 per game).
After dropping a series to No. 4
Hawaii, the Matadors upset Long
Beach and swept UCSD last week
end. Freshman outside hitter Eric
Vance earned MPSF Player of the
Week honors after leading the squad
with 42 kills in the two matches.
The scheduling of the remainder
of the season will allow a road-weary
Cardinal squad to spend all of Dead
Week and finals on campus, a wel
come break.
"We have been doing a lot of trav
eling lately and seen a lot of weather
changes," Shaw said. "We've been on
different trips with snow and all. It's
been interesting, but it will be nice to
be able to stay home and not be living
in and out of suitcases and hotel
rooms."
Facing the prospect of two matches at the No. 1
team in nation, 4,5(X) feet above sea level no less, the
members of the Stanford men's volleyball team knew
they were facing an uphill battle.
The Cardinal were swept by No. 1 BYU both nights
this weekend. But they proved that they would not go
out without a fight, holding on to the bitter end.
The Cougars (14-2,12-2 MPSF) blasted the Cardi
nal (4-16,2-12) to start the weekend, but, in the grudge
match, Stanford showed the tenacity and intensity
that it has been lacking for much of the season. Al
though they did not win a game all weekend, the Card
have momentum which they hope will carry them
through their upcoming three-week home stand as
the end of the season and the MPSF tournament
loom.
