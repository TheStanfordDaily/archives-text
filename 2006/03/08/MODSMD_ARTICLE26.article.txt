### ROHAN PURANIK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The women's lacrosse team dominated No. 13
Vanderbilt 15-9 on Sunday at Maloney Field. The
Cardinal outscored the Commodores in both
halves of the game, with senior attack Sarah Bach
scoring a career-high six goals in the contest.
"Sarah spoke up last year after our loss to Vander
bilt. so 1 think she remembered the disappointment
and put all of her energy into being sharp," Coach
Michelle Uhlfelder said. "She took advantage of her
opportunities to take the ball to goal, as well as to set
herself up for teammates passes. She had a quick first
step and not only made very good decisions with the
ball, but picked up key ground balls for us."
Stanford's Friday matchup with UC-Davis was
cancelled due to poor playing conditions, so the
squad had an extra day to rest and practice before
facing the Commodores.
Stanford junior attack Michelle DeChant set
the tone for the afternoon less than three minutes
in with the first goal of the match. The teams trad
ed goals until halfway through the first half, level
ing at 2-2.
Bach's goal at 13:04 set off a five-goal streak for
Stanford, halted by a single goal from the Com
modores. Stanford led 7-3 until, when the first half
was winding down. Commodore attack Margie
Curran scored a goal to send the teams back to the
locker rooms at 7-4.
Stanford outshot Vanderbilt a close 12-10 in the
first half. Sophomore goalie Laura Shane made
three saves in the period.
The second half of the game was relatively sim
ilar to the first half with Stanford knocking in eight

goals to Vanderbilt's five. The Commodores and
Cardinal each got off 13 shots in the half, while
Shane tallied six saves for Stanford.
DeChant set off the Cardinal's fireworks once
again in the second half. Assisted by senior attack
Megan Burker, sophomore attack Daphne Patter
son started a five-goal set for Stanford.
The Commodores attempted a comeback, scor
ing three late goals, but the Cardinal responded
with two goals to reach a six-goal lead as the game
ended.
Bach's achievement tied the all-time Stanford
single-game goals record and earned the Baltimore

native her third career MSPF player of the week
award.
This is the second consecutive week that a Stan
ford player has won this award. Junior midfield Liz
Piselli picked up the honor last week, thanks in part
to her performances against Ohio State and Notre
Dame. Piselli scored three goals against each of
those teams.
Stanford hosts Columbia and St. Mary's this
weekend at Maloney Field.The Cardinal defeated
conference opponent Saint Mary's 14-5 during the
2004-2005 season, and they face Columbia for just
the second time in school history.
