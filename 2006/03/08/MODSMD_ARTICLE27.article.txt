## Rebuilt cycling team road-ready 
### CALEY ANDERSON DESK EDITOR 
If you've ever congratulated yourself after successfully
navigating through the intersection of death at 10 a.m. on
your hike, you might have considered joining Stanford's
Cycling Team. Now. imagine surviving a similar scenario —
jockeying for position while trying not to crash — at 20-30
mph. and then you might he ready for one of Stanford's
most accomplished club sports.
The cycling squad has won three national champi
onships in the past 10 years and last year, the road team
placed third nationally. All the while, the team stays true to
its club sport roots by having membership open to all of
Stanford.
This year, however, looks to be a rebuilding season for
the team. Four of last year's best riders left, for reasons
ranging from graduation to defending a thesis, and the
team's coach of 12 years moved to Portland.
"We have a team of almost entirely undergrads, with
many freshman and first-time racers," said third-year PhD
candidate Evan Pickett. "This bodes well for the future, of
course, but means we do not place as consistently this year
as we did last year."
The new members, however, are contributing already to
the team. In the race against UC-Davis Feb. 25-26, a first
time racer, freshman Grace Hunter, won the Women's B
Road Race.
The Men's A team rode to second place in the Team
Time Trial and Road Race, and third in the criterium.
More important than the placement, however, was the
way the teams worked together.
"The UC-Davis race showed how necessary teamwork
is in bike racing." graduate student Joakim Vinberg said.
"The Men's A team worked together terrifically. When you
see a race executed like this, it's just beautiful, and high
lights how important the team is, rather than the individual
rider."
Anyone who has watched the Tour de France knows
why that a strong team is just as important as any indi
vidual rider. And one of the biggest changes this year is
the development of team chemistry with a young
squad.
"Compared to last year, the riders this year talk more
and are more of a team, "Vinberg said. "We've bonded, and
it shows in our races when we can talk to each other and
work together."
"[The new riders] are amazing," sophomore Ryan
Parnes added. "It's an incredible feeling to be surrounded
by a bunch of people excited about riding and racing. It's
just a really good vibe."
