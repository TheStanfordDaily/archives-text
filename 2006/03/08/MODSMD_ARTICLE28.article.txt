## Card second at Mclntyre 
### BETH THOMPSON 
Given the never-ending schedule,
some intense gusts, white caps and
currents, the Stanford coed sailing
team had no choice but to bond this
past weekend.
On Saturday and Sunday, Stanford
hosted the Mclntyre team race, earn
ing second place with a 12-7 record for
the weekend. St. Mary's (Md.) posted
a 14-5 record to take first place.
Stanford hosted their team races in
the Redwood City basin, with eight of
the top 20 teams in the country pres
ent. Representing the Card were jun
iors Emery Wager, Caroline Young,
Becca Levin and Joanna Madsen,
sophomores Evan Brown and Eddie
Conrad, freshman Taylor Grimes and
senior Anna Vu.
Unlike some sailing regattas, in
which an individual boats race to win,
these team races test the cohesiveness
and strategy of each team as a whole.
One particularly helpful strategy is
the creation of stable combinations,
which the Cardinal hopes to work on
this week in practice.
"The team with 10 or fewer com
bined points wins the race, so having

a boat in second, third and fourth
place is a winning combination, and
it is also a stable combination, be
cause of the proximity of all of the
boats of one team," said sophomore
Kimberly Korinek.
This weekend, the Cardinal will be
sailing at St. Mary's in Maryland. Al
though Stanford had fewer total wins
than St. Mary 's last weekend, the Car
dinal beat the school all three times
they faced each other. As a result, the
Card is optimistic going into the up
coming regatta.
"Stanford sailing is looking at this
weekend as an opportunity to show
our strength as a nationally competi
tive team," Korinek said.
The Card also sent two teams to
Treasure Island, where California
hosted another team race, mainly for
West Coast schools. But terrible
weather and poor administration at
Cal prevented the races from being
completed.
Despite the weather, the Race
Committee made Stanford's first
team wait in their boats for an hour
and half before telling them their op
ponent had withdrawn.
