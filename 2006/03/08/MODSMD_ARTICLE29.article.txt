# PAC-10
## 'Victoria' punks Pruitt 
### ALEX GYR DANIEL NOVINSON 
Hey, Sixth Man: take notice.
Sure, heckling visiting shooting
free throws is nothing new, and
First Team All-Pac-10 guard Gabe
Pruitt of USC has received his fair
share of taunts. But when the
sophomore stepped to the stripe
during last Saturday's game at Cal
he heard something incredibly fa
miliar yet even more jarring from
the Bears' student section: his own
phone number.
As Sl.com first reported, it
turns out Pruitt had been chatting
on AOL Instant Messenger the
week leading up to the game with
"Victoria," who claimed to be a
cute UCLA student.
Pruitt liked the pictures she
sent, allegedly telling her, "You
look like you have a very fit body,"

and, "Now I want to c u so bad."
Sure enough, he eventually gave
the "girl" his digits and agreed to
meet her when he returned to L. A.
Unfortunately for Pruitt, "Vic
toria" turned out to be a member
of the Cal Rally Com, who shared
the information with the rest of his
student section. So when Pruitt
came up to shoot his first free
throws of the night, the student
section erupted in chants of "Vic
toria," as well as his phone num
ber.
Pruitt, a 79-percent free throw
shooter, missed both attempts
badly, and finished just 3-of-13
from the field. Perhaps Not sur
prisingly, Cal ended up winning
the game 71-60.
The two teams meet in the first
round of the Pac-10 Tournament
on Thursday. No word yet on
whether "Victoria" will attend.
