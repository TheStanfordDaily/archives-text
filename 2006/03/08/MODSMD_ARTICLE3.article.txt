# ASSU adopts new system for groups to solicit signatures
## Fee petitions go online 
### JAMES HOHMANN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The introduction of an online system to petition in
support of special-fee funding requests has thrown a
curve ball to student groups this year. In previous years,
groups were able to use paper petitions to get signa
tures.
The ASSU Elections Commission decided to transi
tion to what they call a more efficient and secure online
petitioning system. While some groups support the
change, others have openly castigated the Elections
Commission for not making the online petitions more
user friendly. Debate among petitioning students and
groups over whether the new system is easier has
prompted the Commission to offer exemptions to at
least four groups.
To sign the petition, students go to a Web site (peti
tions.stanford.edu), choose one of 11 groups from a
pull-down menu and then enter identification informa
tion.The site includes contact information for the finan
cial officer of each of the organizations and links to
budget information. After filling out the petition form,
students receive a confirmation email.
The ASSU leadership has passionately defended the
new system, which has been implemented in anticipa
tion of the April election. Questions had been raised in
years past about students feeling pressured to sign peti
tions when solicited face-to-face. ITie online system, the
ASSU says, is less tedious and more secure.
"People were looking for ways to make the special
fee petition system more effective, more secure and
more reflective of the student body," said sophomore
Chris Elmore, the assistant commissioner responsible
for special fees. "Online petitions are certainly less in
trusive than paper. There are more creative ways to col
lect signatures than just accosting people at dinner."
The commissioners argue that the online system al
lows group leaders to continually check how many con
firmed signatures they have. In the past, it would take
days to confirm whether signatures were valid after the
petition period had closed. Even then, the Commission
only checked 20 percent of signatures to see if they were
accurate.
"This [online petitioning] guarantees every signature
is collected and counted properly," Elmore said. "This
was not feasible under the old system, which required
people to hand count more than 20,(XX) signatures. We
could not guarantee a valid and correct number of signa
tures under the old system. That was not fair to the stu-
dent body and student groups."
"An invalid signature is now
known immediately," said Elections
Commissioner Tim Sanders, a law
student.
Student reaction to the change
has been mixed. Most agree the on
line option should supplement the
paper option, at least during the
transition period.
Sophomore Diane Cheng, a
spokeswoman for Mock Trial, said
each group benefits from overlap
ping outreach campaigns.
"Instead of having members
walk around with a clipboard and
nag people in their classes or on the
street, we can reach more people
faster through mailing lists," she
said. "It's also a lot easier to sign pe
titions online because you can ap
prove multiple groups at once."
Club Sports Financial Manager
Melissa Smit, a sophomore, said the
online option could reduce the
stress level for leaders.
"It is much easier for us to publi
cize voting by allowing emails to be
sent out advocating voting," she said.
"The details involved with paper bal
lots in previous years have been
much more work, for example having
to re-check every signature to make
sure that it is eligible in the petition."
Some group members disagree
that it streamlines everything as
much as ASSU officials say.
"Instead of making it simpler, it
seems the Senate is making it
tougher year-to-year," said Moham
mad Subeh, a coterminal sociology
student and vice president of the
Muslim Students Awareness Net
work (MSAN). "This clearly takes
away from the productivity of what
our members could potentially be
doing."
"The Senate has set up a lot of
roadblocks for groups like MSAN
and MEChA [Movimiento Estudi
antil Chicano de Aztlan]," he said in
a telephone interview. "The new sys
tem makes the process a lot more
difficult to go and just check boxes.
The drop down menu makes it take
a lot more time consuming. So you
will get a lot less people going online
to sign petitions."
"The online petition system
makes it more difficult to collabo
rate in signature campaigns with
other petitioning groups, as a stu
dent must repeat the entire signa
ture process for each group," said
sophomore Bernard Fraga, a
spokesman for MEChA. a Latino
outreach group. "A system with
check-boxes, similar to that used in
the election, would be far more effi
cient and effective. Paper petitions
are also more effective for this rea
son, as a person can sign for multiple
groups at once."
Subeh complained that the on
line petition Web site will be open
for less than two weeks.

"The Senate makes their Web
site difficult to use and then reduces
the time window by giving us only a
week-and-a-halfhe said. "This is
only one phase of obtaining our spe
cial fees. It is another hurdle in the
process."
Some activity leaders said they
agreed there were benefits to an on
line system but worried about possi
ble drawbacks.
"I think that the online petition is
a double-edged sword," said Kiah
Williams, president of the Stanford
NAACP chapter. "On the one hand it
prevents clerical errors such as illegi
ble signatures and duplicates, but it
also makes it harder to get your point
across as an organization."
Groups have traditionally re
quired their members to individual
ly solicit signatures. Under the new
system, it is harder for groups to
track how many people their mem
bers have convinced to sign the on
line petition.
"in the past, we gave members a
quota of signatures to gather, to
make sure that we eventually re
ceived the required amount; howev
er, we have to change our strategy
for the new system," Cheng said.
The ASSU officials have listened
to these complaints, but still stand
behind the system.
"I have heard complaints from
some people that it makes it harder
and complaints from others that it
makes it easier," said junior Chris
Nguyen, chair of the Undergraduate
Senate. "If we are hearing com
plaints from both sides about the
difficulty level, it is probably a sign
we are doing it right."
GSC Funding Committee Chair
Adam Beberg. a doctoral candidate
in computer science, said the new e
systeni will make the petitioning
process "profoundly easier for
everyone" and dismissed group
complaints about the system.
"Some groups either fear the new
system, or just don't understand," he
wrote in an email to The Daily.
"Groups gathered petitions in ques
tionable ways in the past, and very
few students could say after the fact
what they had signed. Some groups
are rightfully worried that without a
piece of paper (no one reads) and
peer pressure to force people to
sign, their group may not be able to
get the signatures."
Concerns about the online system
prompted exemptions for some stu
dent groups to continue using the old
paper petitions. At least four groups.

including The Daily, have requested
the ability to use paper petitions.
"We are opening up both options
this year," Sanders said.
Even so, group leaders will need
to enter the information from the
paper petitions and turn in the hard
copies to the Elections Commission.
Students who fill out paper petitions

will also receive confirmation emails.
"This way, we can now have our
staffers gather signatures all over
campus from the widest possible
cross-section of the student body
without needing to lug along lap
tops," said Brendan Marten, the
chief operating officer for The
Daily.

trusive than paper. There are more creative ways to col
lect signatures than just accosting people at dinner."
The commissioners argue that the online system al
lows group leaders to continually check how many con
firmed signatures they have. In the past, it would take
days to confirm whether signatures were valid after the
petition period had closed. Even then, the Commission
only checked 20 percent of signatures to see if they were
accurate.
"This [online petitioning] guarantees every signature
is collected and counted properly," Elmore said. "This
was not feasible under the old system, which required
people to hand count more than 20,(XX) signatures. We
could not guarantee a valid and correct number of signa
tures under the old system. That was not fair to the stu-
dent body and student groups."
"An invalid signature is now
known immediately," said Elections
Commissioner Tim Sanders, a law
student.
Student reaction to the change
has been mixed. Most agree the on
line option should supplement the
paper option, at least during the
transition period.
Sophomore Diane Cheng, a
spokeswoman for Mock Trial, said
each group benefits from overlap
ping outreach campaigns.
"Instead of having members
walk around with a clipboard and
nag people in their classes or on the
street, we can reach more people
faster through mailing lists," she
said. "It's also a lot easier to sign pe
titions online because you can ap
prove multiple groups at once."
Club Sports Financial Manager
Melissa Smit, a sophomore, said the
online option could reduce the
stress level for leaders.
"It is much easier for us to publi
cize voting by allowing emails to be
sent out advocating voting," she said.
"The details involved with paper bal
lots in previous years have been
much more work, for example having
to re-check every signature to make
sure that it is eligible in the petition."
Some group members disagree
that it streamlines everything as
much as ASSU officials say.
"Instead of making it simpler, it
seems the Senate is making it
tougher year-to-year," said Moham
mad Subeh, a coterminal sociology
student and vice president of the
Muslim Students Awareness Net
work (MSAN). "This clearly takes
away from the productivity of what
our members could potentially be
doing."
"The Senate has set up a lot of
roadblocks for groups like MSAN
and MEChA [Movimiento Estudi
antil Chicano de Aztlan]," he said in
a telephone interview. "The new sys
tem makes the process a lot more
difficult to go and just check boxes.
The drop down menu makes it take
a lot more time consuming. So you
will get a lot less people going online
to sign petitions."
"The online petition system
makes it more difficult to collabo
rate in signature campaigns with
other petitioning groups, as a stu
dent must repeat the entire signa
ture process for each group," said
sophomore Bernard Fraga, a
spokesman for MEChA. a Latino
outreach group. "A system with
check-boxes, similar to that used in
the election, would be far more effi
cient and effective. Paper petitions
are also more effective for this rea
son, as a person can sign for multiple
groups at once."
Subeh complained that the on
line petition Web site will be open
for less than two weeks.

"The Senate makes their Web
site difficult to use and then reduces
the time window by giving us only a
week-and-a-halfhe said. "This is
only one phase of obtaining our spe
cial fees. It is another hurdle in the
process."
Some activity leaders said they
agreed there were benefits to an on
line system but worried about possi
ble drawbacks.
"I think that the online petition is
a double-edged sword," said Kiah
Williams, president of the Stanford
NAACP chapter. "On the one hand it
prevents clerical errors such as illegi
ble signatures and duplicates, but it
also makes it harder to get your point
across as an organization."
Groups have traditionally re
quired their members to individual
ly solicit signatures. Under the new
system, it is harder for groups to
track how many people their mem
bers have convinced to sign the on
line petition.
"in the past, we gave members a
quota of signatures to gather, to
make sure that we eventually re
ceived the required amount; howev
er, we have to change our strategy
for the new system," Cheng said.
The ASSU officials have listened
to these complaints, but still stand
behind the system.
"I have heard complaints from
some people that it makes it harder
and complaints from others that it
makes it easier," said junior Chris
Nguyen, chair of the Undergraduate
Senate. "If we are hearing com
plaints from both sides about the
difficulty level, it is probably a sign
we are doing it right."
GSC Funding Committee Chair
Adam Beberg. a doctoral candidate
in computer science, said the new e
systeni will make the petitioning
process "profoundly easier for
everyone" and dismissed group
complaints about the system.
"Some groups either fear the new
system, or just don't understand," he
wrote in an email to The Daily.
"Groups gathered petitions in ques
tionable ways in the past, and very
few students could say after the fact
what they had signed. Some groups
are rightfully worried that without a
piece of paper (no one reads) and
peer pressure to force people to
sign, their group may not be able to
get the signatures."
Concerns about the online system
prompted exemptions for some stu
dent groups to continue using the old
paper petitions. At least four groups.

including The Daily, have requested
the ability to use paper petitions.
"We are opening up both options
this year," Sanders said.
Even so, group leaders will need
to enter the information from the
paper petitions and turn in the hard
copies to the Elections Commission.
Students who fill out paper petitions

will also receive confirmation emails.
"This way, we can now have our
staffers gather signatures all over
campus from the widest possible
cross-section of the student body
without needing to lug along lap
tops," said Brendan Marten, the
chief operating officer for The
Daily.
The introduction of an online system to petition in
support of special-fee funding requests has thrown a
curve ball to student groups this year. In previous years,
groups were able to use paper petitions to get signa
tures.
The ASSU Elections Commission decided to transi
tion to what they call a more efficient and secure online
petitioning system. While some groups support the
change, others have openly castigated the Elections
Commission for not making the online petitions more
user friendly. Debate among petitioning students and
groups over whether the new system is easier has
prompted the Commission to offer exemptions to at
least four groups.
To sign the petition, students go to a Web site (peti
tions.stanford.edu), choose one of 11 groups from a
pull-down menu and then enter identification informa
tion.The site includes contact information for the finan
cial officer of each of the organizations and links to
budget information. After filling out the petition form,
students receive a confirmation email.
The ASSU leadership has passionately defended the
new system, which has been implemented in anticipa
tion of the April election. Questions had been raised in
years past about students feeling pressured to sign peti
tions when solicited face-to-face. ITie online system, the
ASSU says, is less tedious and more secure.
"People were looking for ways to make the special
fee petition system more effective, more secure and
more reflective of the student body," said sophomore
Chris Elmore, the assistant commissioner responsible
for special fees. "Online petitions are certainly less in
trusive than paper. There are more creative ways to col
lect signatures than just accosting people at dinner."
