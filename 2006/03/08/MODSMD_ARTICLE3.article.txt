# ASSU adopts new system for groups to solicit signatures
## Fee petitions go online 
### JAMES HOHMANN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The introduction of an online system to petition in
support of special-fee funding requests has thrown a
curve ball to student groups this year. In previous years,
groups were able to use paper petitions to get signa
tures.
The ASSU Elections Commission decided to transi
tion to what they call a more efficient and secure online
petitioning system. While some groups support the
change, others have openly castigated the Elections
Commission for not making the online petitions more
user friendly. Debate among petitioning students and
groups over whether the new system is easier has
prompted the Commission to offer exemptions to at
least four groups.
To sign the petition, students go to a Web site (peti
tions.stanford.edu), choose one of 11 groups from a
pull-down menu and then enter identification informa
tion.The site includes contact information for the finan
cial officer of each of the organizations and links to
budget information. After filling out the petition form,
students receive a confirmation email.
The ASSU leadership has passionately defended the
new system, which has been implemented in anticipa
tion of the April election. Questions had been raised in
years past about students feeling pressured to sign peti
tions when solicited face-to-face. ITie online system, the
ASSU says, is less tedious and more secure.
"People were looking for ways to make the special
fee petition system more effective, more secure and
more reflective of the student body," said sophomore
Chris Elmore, the assistant commissioner responsible
for special fees. "Online petitions are certainly less in
trusive than paper. There are more creative ways to col
lect signatures than just accosting people at dinner."
The commissioners argue that the online system al
lows group leaders to continually check how many con
firmed signatures they have. In the past, it would take
days to confirm whether signatures were valid after the
petition period had closed. Even then, the Commission
only checked 20 percent of signatures to see if they were
accurate.
"This [online petitioning] guarantees every signature
is collected and counted properly," Elmore said. "This
was not feasible under the old system, which required
people to hand count more than 20,(XX) signatures. We
could not guarantee a valid and correct number of signa
tures under the old system. That was not fair to the stu-
