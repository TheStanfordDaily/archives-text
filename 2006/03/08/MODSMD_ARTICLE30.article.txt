### ANDREW SHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After competing in the Western Regionals in the
high altitude of Colorado Springs, Colo., Stanford
can breathe easy The Cardinal won the tournament,
beating UC-San Diego. Cal Tech, Cal State-Fuller
ton and Air Force, opponents they also easily dis
patched just three weeks ago at San Diego.
Highlighting Stanford's accomplishments were
gold medals from captain foilist Steve Gerberman
and freshmen sabreists Eva Jellison and Teddy
Levitt. Senior Martin Lee added a silver medal, and
senior Aileen Maloney, junior Curtis Andrus, soph
omore Rick Fulton and freshman Brittany Leader
garnered bronze medals.
The Cardinal's three gold medalists all had a rel
atively smooth tournament. Gerberman and
Levitt's closest matches were 15-7 and 15-8, respec

tively. Jellison also emerged victorious, all while
fencing "in a relaxed manner."
However, the entire team did not have as effort
less a tournament as the gold medalists.
"I was having a good day, and 1 felt that 1 was
fencing consistently well. With that, combined with a
bit of luck, I was able to reach the top four," said Ful
ton, who rebounded from a 5-1 deficit to win the
bronze medal bout by a score of 9-7.
Needless to say, the Cardinal have very high ex
pectations of themselves.
"To tell you the truth, I am disappointed that 1 got
second," Lee said. "Right now, I just have to prepare
for the NCAA Championships, and my second
place will help fuel my desire to perform well for
both myself and Stanford."
"I'm really going to have to get myself psyched
for NCAA Championships," said Jellison. who
knocked off Olympic gold-medalist Mariel Zagunis

of Notre Dame in February. "The competition there
is really stiff, including two Olympians and many
world team members. With the five-touch bout for
mat, I certainly have a wonderful chance of making
the final four."
Along with medalists Gerberman Jellison, Levitt
and Fulton, freshman Clayton Kenney was one of
1 44 fencers nationwide to be selected to compete in
the NCAA Championships. They will compete in a
round-robin style tournament, with the top four
fencers squaring off in a direct elimination round.
For Gerberman, this year's championships have
an extra special meaning.
"The NCAAs are two weekends from now in my
hometown of Houston, and I hope to continue my
performance and do the best that I can," he said."All
in all, I was impressed with most of our fencers. Iliey
fought hard and never gave up, which should show
in our results at NCAAs."
