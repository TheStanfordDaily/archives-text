## Petitioning process sparks debate 
### JAMES HOHMANN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Eleven student groups are rushing to gather signa
tures on petitions for their ASSU special-fee funding
requests to appear on the April ballot before the March
17 deadline. The controversial introduction of online
petitioning; a short time frame to collect more than
2,(KK) signatures for some groups; and the amount of
money at stake have made this year's fight for signa
tures particularly heated.
ITie annual special-fees process applies to groups re
questing more than $B,(XX) in funding. Groups must seek
signatures to secure a place on the ballot for the ASSU
elections that will be held April 12 and 13. If they are re
questing special funds for the first time, asking for in
creased support of more than 10 percent or if their re

quest was not supported in full by the ASSU Under
graduate Senate and Graduate Student Council (GSC),
they also must petition.
Groups with the support of the ASSU, and those
catering only to undergraduates need fewer petitions
than groups who are requesting more special-fee sup
port than the ASSU approved, or who provide servic
es to graduate students as well. A group is not guaran
teed funding if it secures the minimum number of sig
natures. They are simply guaranteed a place on the bal
lot in April.
Groups are doing everything they can to garner sup
port for both the online and paper petitions. Leaders are
advertising the work their groups do, sending members
dorm-to-dorm with laptops and paper petitions and
using email lists.
Every group reported utilizing
email lists to drum up support and
point students toward the ASSU peti
tion Web page. Campus inboxes have
been flooded since the online petitions
opened last weekend. Some students
report receiving dozens of emails solic
iting support, and express frustration
at the continuing onslaught.
"It we get an email from everyone
in every group, our inboxes will be re
ally cluttered, so please stop." wrote
senior Seth Ort. a member of the
Cedro staff, in a message to the dorm
list atter almost 10 solicitations were
sent over a few hours.
Some groups and their supporters
said they are mindful of what many
would consider a nuisance.
"We'd like to get as much support
as possible without spamniing too
many lists too often," said the finan
cial manager for Student Initiated

Courses, senior Jenna Boiler.
Six Degrees: A Journal of Human
Rights, handed out the latest issue of
the publication and set up laptops in
White Plaza on Monday for students
to fill out online petitions. The group
was also granted an exemption to use
paper petitions.
The Muslim Student Awareness
Network (MSAN) has plans to send
its members armed with laptops to
dorms. A group leader said they do
not want to risk falling short of the re
quired number of signatures. MSAN
also received an exemption to use
paper petitions from the Elections
Commission. They are sending their
members out to collect a minimum
number of signatures, and are expect
ing them to exceed that level.
"Our core members are going out
there dorm-to-dorm, door-to-door to
talk about MSAN, its mission, its
budget and what it all means in terms
of why we need special fees," said Mo
hammad Subeh, a coterminal sociolo
gy student and vice president of
MSAN.
MEChA [Movimiento Estudiantil
Chicano de Aztlan] is participating in

a joint effort with MSAN and other
groups to gain signatures via email
and personal reminders to sign the
petition, said sophomore Bernard
Fraga. a spokesman for MEChA, a
Latino outreach group.
Group members said they are try
ing to get as many signatures as they
can. even if it is more than required.
"We are also making sure to col
lect many more signatures than we
actually need in order to protect
against potential signature disqualifi
cations due to incorrect information
provided by students signing our peti
tion and other various causes." said
Brendan Marten, the chief operating
officer of The Stanford Daily.
Group leaders are closely moni
toring the number of signatures they
have, as they devise strategies to get
the needed number by the close of
special-fee petitioning on Mar. 17.
Nine financial officers for petitioning
groups said they are checking their
count at least every day.
"The petition status Web site is
my new Facebook, I look at it at least
10 times a day to make sure that peo
ple are still going to the site," said
Shannon Enox, the financial manag
er for Flicks.
The groups needing fewer signa
tures are not as concerned about
meeting their goals as organizations
that need more than 2.000 signatures,
such as The Daily.

"We are literally monitoring the
signature situation on an hourly
basis, and it is our goal to have suc
cessfully completed the petition
process a number of days in advance
of the deadline in order to give us
buffer time in case the effort for some
reason does not go as planned,"
Marten said.
The NAACP chapter and Stan
ford Concert Network (SCN) would
not release the number of signatures
they have,explaining that the number
is constantly changing.
"We don't want to send the image
that we are begging or that we have
too many petitions," said Rene Spell
man, a financial manager for both the
NAACP and SCN.
Club Sports leaders said they are
confident they will get at least the
minimum number of signatures. Only
679 are needed and there are nearly
1.000 members in the group. Club
Sports had nearly enough by last
night at 7 p.m.
• MEChA had received approxi
mately 60 percent of the required sig
natures by 5 p.m. yesterday.
• Six Degrees had 287 signatures
at 5 p.m. yesterday.
• Flicks had 8(K) as of 10 p.m. Mon
day night.
• Student Initiated Courses had
245 signatures at 5 p.m. Monday.
• Alternative Spring Break had
490 signatures Monday.

senior Seth Ort. a member of the
Cedro staff, in a message to the dorm
list atter almost 10 solicitations were
sent over a few hours.
Some groups and their supporters

as possible without spamniing too
many lists too often," said the finan

dorms. A group leader said they do
not want to risk falling short of the re
quired number of signatures. MSAN
also received an exemption to use

members out to collect a minimum
number of signatures, and are expect
ing them to exceed that level.
"Our core members are going out
there dorm-to-dorm, door-to-door to

budget and what it all means in terms
of why we need special fees," said Mo

Group members said they are try
ing to get as many signatures as they
can. even if it is more than required.
"We are also making sure to col
lect many more signatures than we
actually need in order to protect
against potential signature disqualifi
cations due to incorrect information
provided by students signing our peti
tion and other various causes." said
Brendan Marten, the chief operating
officer of The Stanford Daily.
Group leaders are closely moni
toring the number of signatures they
have, as they devise strategies to get
the needed number by the close of

Nine financial officers for petitioning
groups said they are checking their
count at least every day.
"The petition status Web site is
my new Facebook, I look at it at least
10 times a day to make sure that peo
ple are still going to the site," said
Shannon Enox, the financial manag
er for Flicks.
The groups needing fewer signa
tures are not as concerned about
meeting their goals as organizations
that need more than 2.000 signatures,
such as The Daily.

"We are literally monitoring the
signature situation on an hourly
basis, and it is our goal to have suc
cessfully completed the petition
process a number of days in advance
of the deadline in order to give us
buffer time in case the effort for some
reason does not go as planned,"
Marten said.
The NAACP chapter and Stan
ford Concert Network (SCN) would
not release the number of signatures

man, a financial manager for both the
NAACP and SCN.

Eleven student groups are rushing to gather signa
tures on petitions for their ASSU special-fee funding
requests to appear on the April ballot before the March
17 deadline. The controversial introduction of online
petitioning; a short time frame to collect more than
2,(KK) signatures for some groups; and the amount of
money at stake have made this year's fight for signa
tures particularly heated.
ITie annual special-fees process applies to groups re
questing more than $B,(XX) in funding. Groups must seek
signatures to secure a place on the ballot for the ASSU
elections that will be held April 12 and 13. If they are re
questing special funds for the first time, asking for in
creased support of more than 10 percent or if their re

quest was not supported in full by the ASSU Under
graduate Senate and Graduate Student Council (GSC),
they also must petition.
Groups with the support of the ASSU, and those
catering only to undergraduates need fewer petitions
than groups who are requesting more special-fee sup
port than the ASSU approved, or who provide servic
es to graduate students as well. A group is not guaran
teed funding if it secures the minimum number of sig
natures. They are simply guaranteed a place on the bal
lot in April.
Groups are doing everything they can to garner sup
port for both the online and paper petitions. Leaders are
advertising the work their groups do, sending members
dorm-to-dorm with laptops and paper petitions and
using email lists.
Every group reported utilizing
email lists to drum up support and
point students toward the ASSU peti
tion Web page. Campus inboxes have
been flooded since the online petitions
opened last weekend. Some students
report receiving dozens of emails solic
iting support, and express frustration
