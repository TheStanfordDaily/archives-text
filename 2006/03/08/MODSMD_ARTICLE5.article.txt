## Petitioning process sparks debate 
### JAMES HOHMANN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Eleven student groups are rushing to gather signa
tures on petitions for their ASSU special-fee funding
requests to appear on the April ballot before the March
17 deadline. The controversial introduction of online
petitioning; a short time frame to collect more than
2,(KK) signatures for some groups; and the amount of
money at stake have made this year's fight for signa
tures particularly heated.
ITie annual special-fees process applies to groups re
questing more than $B,(XX) in funding. Groups must seek
signatures to secure a place on the ballot for the ASSU
elections that will be held April 12 and 13. If they are re
questing special funds for the first time, asking for in
creased support of more than 10 percent or if their re

quest was not supported in full by the ASSU Under
graduate Senate and Graduate Student Council (GSC),
they also must petition.
Groups with the support of the ASSU, and those
catering only to undergraduates need fewer petitions
than groups who are requesting more special-fee sup
port than the ASSU approved, or who provide servic
es to graduate students as well. A group is not guaran
teed funding if it secures the minimum number of sig
natures. They are simply guaranteed a place on the bal
lot in April.
Groups are doing everything they can to garner sup
port for both the online and paper petitions. Leaders are
advertising the work their groups do, sending members
dorm-to-dorm with laptops and paper petitions and
