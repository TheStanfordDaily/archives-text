## CHOMPZ DELIVERS Seniors start door-to-door In-N-Out delivery business 
### MELISSA FUSCO STAFF WRITER 
It's not rare to see Stanford graduates and business
students come together to set up their own ventures post
graduation. But for seniors Sam Yam, Nick Miyake and
James Lin, getting down to business could not wait.
In February, the three seniors launched their own
venture, a food-delivery business called Chompz. Using
food heaters to deliver warm In-N-Out burgers to pa
trons in on-campus housing, Chompz enables students to
order online anytime before 11 p.m. at
www.chompz.com, and expect delivery around mid
night. The Web site offers a menu of hamburgers, grilled
cheese sandwiches, fries, milkshakes and the classic dou
ble-patty cheeseburgers aficionados of the fast-food hot
spot call "double-doubles."
"When we were freshmen, we didn't have the privi
lege to simply drive over to Rengstorff every time we
craved In-N-Out," notes the team's Web site.The service
now makes one trip to In-N-Out and delivers primarily
to undergraduate dormitories. Chompz charges a mod
est fee for delivery — 99 cents per burger — to recover
the costs of gas, heating and transportation.
Business, the trio said, has been brisk thus far, with the
team netting about S(X) orders in the first four weeks.
While the price markup is modest, co-founder Yam ex
pects to benefit more from experience than profits.
"We probably won't make much, if anything, from
this," Yam said. "I sat down and did a calculation for the
first night, and each of us made around $4.75 per hour."
He continued,"But it's fun, and we'll have something

to tell our potential employers when we look for jobs
next year."
Although business is in its beginning stages. Yam said
the group's Web site is already attracting attention.
"On our first day of business, we were blogged by a
Stanford alumnus on his Web site, and we were also con
tacted by some business students," he recalled.
While it began as a passing thought, these three sen
iors started an operation that is simple in nature, but a
novelty on campus.
"The idea was something we had for a while," Miyake,
a senior computer science major recalled. "We started
talking about it last year and were discussing student
needs on campus, and noted that there are few late-night
food options. Nothing on campus is open after 7 or 8
p.m., other than Late Nite.
"We joked that if someone started a late-night deliv
ery system, they would make so much money," he added.
In the future, the group said it hopes to branch out to
other popular food vendors around campus that are out
of reach to students without cars.
