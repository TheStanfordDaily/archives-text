## ASSU pitches changes to UAP programs 
### MIKI SOFER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This week's ASSU Undergraduate Senate
meeting kicked off with a presentation by ASSU
Executive Cabinet Member, senior Jeremy Bar
ton, on marketing strategies to increase aware
ness of undergraduate advising resources on
campus and to foster communication between
the Undergraduate Advising Program (UAP)
and student body.
The goals of the UAP. explained Barton, are to
improve student life by putting people on the
right track, connecting them with faculty and
providing them with direction and encourage
ment during times of stress.
"It's a good place to go if you have small or big
questions, but the UAP is underutilized because
not many people know what they do to help stu
dents," Barton said.
To remedy this problem, fliers will be posted
starting this spring in residential dining halls
across campus to advertise the resources that are
available at the UAP. By monitoring the number
of people who subsequently come in for advising
help throughout the quarter, the UAP will be
able to assess the program's success and useful
ness to students.
Senators also suggested ways in which the ad
vising programs themselves could be improved.
