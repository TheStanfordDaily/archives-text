## ASSU pitches changes to UAP programs 
### MIKI SOFER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This week's ASSU Undergraduate Senate
meeting kicked off with a presentation by ASSU
Executive Cabinet Member, senior Jeremy Bar
ton, on marketing strategies to increase aware
ness of undergraduate advising resources on
campus and to foster communication between
the Undergraduate Advising Program (UAP)
and student body.
The goals of the UAP. explained Barton, are to
improve student life by putting people on the
right track, connecting them with faculty and
providing them with direction and encourage
ment during times of stress.
"It's a good place to go if you have small or big
questions, but the UAP is underutilized because
not many people know what they do to help stu
dents," Barton said.
To remedy this problem, fliers will be posted
starting this spring in residential dining halls
across campus to advertise the resources that are
available at the UAP. By monitoring the number
of people who subsequently come in for advising
help throughout the quarter, the UAP will be
able to assess the program's success and useful
ness to students.
Senators also suggested ways in which the ad
vising programs themselves could be improved.
Several students indicated that
sophomores, in particular, should re
ceive more advising due to the diffi
cult transition they make from fresh
man year. One senator offered that
letters be sent directly to sopho
mores in the fall, making them aware
of upcoming deadlines and advising
opportunities, instead of expecting
them to come in on their own.
Another senator stressed the im
portance of finding more efficient
ways to pair students with advisors
based on their interests. This is a
challenge, however, given that a ma
jority of freshmen remain uncertain
of what they would like to study
when they first matriculate.
Barton said that the UAP is well
aware of these issues and is current
ly working to resolve them.
An additional topic of discussion
this week was Bill 16, which moves to
increase the ASSU programming
and community service general fee
by 10 percent. The bill passed by a
vote of 11-0-1. If the measure passes
in the spring election, students will
see a rise in the Student Activities
Fee that is paid along with the quar
terly tuition.
"This will slightly increase the
amount of money available to stu
dent groups, but it's up to the voters
to decide if they want to pass it," said
ASSU Senate Chair Chris Nguyen, a
junior. "There's always the possibili
ty that if fees go too high people will
begin asking for refunds."
Another funding issue on the
table was the bill to increase special
fees for Innovative Student Infor
mation Services (ISIS), the group re
sponsible for the flat-screen panels
advertising 50 to 70 student-organ
ized events around campus each
week. According to the ASSU ballot
recommendation, ISIS requested
these funds to maintain existing
screens and for expansion to new lo
cations.
The bill was already approved
once by the Undergraduate Senate
earlier in the quarter. But upon re
jection by the Graduate Student
Council (GSC).it returned to the un
dergraduate body for consideration.
"Given the sheer number of
events that we fund undergraduate
groups to put on, ISIS would be in
strumental in making sure that those

events actually get advertised and
people make use of them." ASSU
Appropriations Chair Paris Mohiud
din, a junior, said.
The strategic placement of these
screens around campus and the
thousands that it saves in paper fliers
also makes it a fairly cost-efficient
method of advertising, he added.
Bearing these facts in mind, the
ASSU has modified the bill so that
the new screens will be placed only
in locations frequented by under
graduates, such as residential dining
halls. This will effectively deny the
graduate school community of fu
ture ISIS advertisement services.
Hie bill was passed by a unanimous
vote.
Constitutional changes were dis
cussed at the meeting as well, but
these primarily consisted of minor
"housekeeping" changes such as the
removal of redundancies and shift
ing of clauses.
The ASSU also voted to increase
funding to student groups by the
sum of $5,000. Among organizations
requesting funding were the Filipino
American Student Union, Stanford
Gospel Choir, Stanford German
Students Association, Basmati Raas,
Multiracial Identified Community
and the European Association at
Stanford.
