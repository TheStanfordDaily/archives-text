# CAMPUS LIFE
## Ashland trip snowed in 
### JENNIFER CHIN STAFF WRITER 
Stuck, stranded and snowed in — all with
out a single white tlake on the ground.This was
the unfortunate situation facing 94 Stanford
students this past Sunday as they planned to
head back to campus after a theater-filled
weekend at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival
in Ashland, Oregon.
The trip is an annual event organized by
Donner Resident Fellow Linda Paulson, an
English professor and theater aficionado.
Each year,she invites Donner freshmen,house
alumni and members of her Ashland-focused
Sophomore College group to join her for three
days at the festival.
In her 10 years of planning the trip, this was
the first that Paulson found herself stranded.
"Ashland is 18 miles over the [California-
Oregon] border." she said in an interview with
The Daily. "There was 30 inches of snow in
Shasta City on Sunday, and even snow 10 miles
south of Ashland — but no snow in Ashland it
self."
Due to adverse conditions on the road, the
California Highway Patrol found it fit to close
portions of lnterstate-5 on Sunday afternoon.
Just as quickly, Paulson found her and her
group effectively "snowed in" in Ashland, hav
ing previously planned to drive back to cam
pus after a Sunday matinee.
The extra day in town gave the nearly 100
students more time to reflect on their theater
experiences over the Friday-Sunday weekend.
Despite its name, which implies a short
lived nature, the OSF actually lasts eight
months and puts on 11 plays — over half of
which were not penned by the Bard. Students
had the opportunity to see all four of the plays
currently playing in Ashland, including Shake
speare's 'The Winter's Tale," "The Importance

of Being Earnest," by Oscar Wilde,"'lhe Diary
of Anne Frank," adapted by Wendy Kessel
man, and "UP!," by Bridget Carpenter.
Of these, "The Importance of Being
Earnest" emerged as a popular favorite among
students, especially current Donner freshmen.
"It was absolutely hilarious and really well
done," said freshman Stephanie Swenson.
"The sets and the costumes were excellent."
Fellow freshman EB Meade agreed.
"The set was really rich in contrast to 'The
Winter's Tale,' which [...] was mostly bare on
the stage." she said.
Paulson also spoke highly of the play —
"They always do comedy very well." she said
The annual trek to Ashland began in 1995,
sparked by Paulson's desire to share her love
of theater and OSF. Twenty-seven students
went the first year, while, in recent years, the
number of attendees has hovered around 100.
The group traditionally leaves Friday morning
and spends all weekend in Oregon, taking in
plays and the town before returning on Sun
day.
Paulson said she has always been commit
ted to making the trip reasonably priced for
anyone who wants to go.
"I want everyone to have a really intense
experience of really good theater that they can
also afford," she said.
In the early years, students did their part to
help make the trip possible by writing letters
for the Stanford Fund. But when the Fund
stopped allowing dorms to earn money this
way. Paulson acted on the advice of a friend,
who suggested that noted Stanford donor
Helen Bing might be interested in helping out.
Bing had never been to the OSF,but agreed
to help Paulson continue the project. Due to
this connection, Bing is now very involved with
the festival and travels each year to OSF's
opening weekend.

Today, the trip "isn't free, but is very well
subsidized," reported Paulson. Students this
year were asked to pay $50 for accommoda
tions, in addition to $5 per ticket for any play
they wished to see. Even though they were in
charge of most of their own meals, many
thought the excursion was a bargain.
"Mrs. Bing is very generous to make this
trip affordable," Swenson said.
Despite the weather mishap, everyone
praised the opportunity.
"For all the inconvenience of missing a sec
ond dav of classes, it was still worth it," said

Donner freshman Aaron Bronzan. "I had a
great time. I'm looking forward to going back
next year."
"We were kind of happy to get snowed in
because Ashland is a cute town," freshman
Stephanie Alessi explained.
"What we miss at Stanford is a real college
town, but you're able to get that up there," she
added, referencing Ashland's copious shops
and cafes.
Paulson said she continues to believe that
the trip is an invaluable experience for stu
dents.

"[Theater] is such a wonderful thing to be
active in, to be a supporter of," she said. "It's an
absolutely vital part of the arts. I really hope
this kind of thing happens more often."
Paulson suggested that anyone interested
in starting similar trips contact her, or even
Helen Ring herself.
"She's interested in showing students that
things cai. be don*: well --they can enjoy a
good meal, have a good experience and talk
about it afterwards," Paulson said. "I think
she'd really be interested in growing this
thing."

the first that Paulson found herself stranded.
"Ashland is 18 miles over the [California-
Oregon] border." she said in an interview with
The Daily. "There was 30 inches of snow in
Shasta City on Sunday, and even snow 10 miles
south of Ashland — but no snow in Ashland it
self."
Due to adverse conditions on the road, the
California Highway Patrol found it fit to close
portions of lnterstate-5 on Sunday afternoon.
Just as quickly, Paulson found her and her
group effectively "snowed in" in Ashland, hav
ing previously planned to drive back to cam
pus after a Sunday matinee.
The extra day in town gave the nearly 100
students more time to reflect on their theater
experiences over the Friday-Sunday weekend.
Despite its name, which implies a short
lived nature, the OSF actually lasts eight
months and puts on 11 plays — over half of
which were not penned by the Bard. Students
had the opportunity to see all four of the plays
currently playing in Ashland, including Shake
speare's 'The Winter's Tale," "The Importance

of Being Earnest," by Oscar Wilde,"'lhe Diary
of Anne Frank," adapted by Wendy Kessel
man, and "UP!," by Bridget Carpenter.
Of these, "The Importance of Being
Earnest" emerged as a popular favorite among
students, especially current Donner freshmen.
"It was absolutely hilarious and really well
done," said freshman Stephanie Swenson.
"The sets and the costumes were excellent."
Fellow freshman EB Meade agreed.
"The set was really rich in contrast to 'The
Winter's Tale,' which [...] was mostly bare on
the stage." she said.
Paulson also spoke highly of the play —
"They always do comedy very well." she said
The annual trek to Ashland began in 1995,
sparked by Paulson's desire to share her love
of theater and OSF. Twenty-seven students
went the first year, while, in recent years, the
number of attendees has hovered around 100.
The group traditionally leaves Friday morning
and spends all weekend in Oregon, taking in
plays and the town before returning on Sun
day.
Paulson said she has always been commit
ted to making the trip reasonably priced for
anyone who wants to go.
"I want everyone to have a really intense
experience of really good theater that they can
also afford," she said.
In the early years, students did their part to
help make the trip possible by writing letters
for the Stanford Fund. But when the Fund
stopped allowing dorms to earn money this
way. Paulson acted on the advice of a friend,
who suggested that noted Stanford donor
Helen Bing might be interested in helping out.
Bing had never been to the OSF,but agreed
to help Paulson continue the project. Due to
this connection, Bing is now very involved with
the festival and travels each year to OSF's
opening weekend.

Today, the trip "isn't free, but is very well
subsidized," reported Paulson. Students this
year were asked to pay $50 for accommoda
tions, in addition to $5 per ticket for any play
they wished to see. Even though they were in
charge of most of their own meals, many
thought the excursion was a bargain.
"Mrs. Bing is very generous to make this
trip affordable," Swenson said.
Despite the weather mishap, everyone
praised the opportunity.
"For all the inconvenience of missing a sec
ond dav of classes, it was still worth it," said

Donner freshman Aaron Bronzan. "I had a
great time. I'm looking forward to going back
next year."
"We were kind of happy to get snowed in
because Ashland is a cute town," freshman
Stephanie Alessi explained.
"What we miss at Stanford is a real college
town, but you're able to get that up there," she
added, referencing Ashland's copious shops
and cafes.
Paulson said she continues to believe that
the trip is an invaluable experience for stu
dents.

"[Theater] is such a wonderful thing to be
active in, to be a supporter of," she said. "It's an
absolutely vital part of the arts. I really hope
this kind of thing happens more often."
Paulson suggested that anyone interested
in starting similar trips contact her, or even
Helen Ring herself.
"She's interested in showing students that
things cai. be don*: well --they can enjoy a
good meal, have a good experience and talk
about it afterwards," Paulson said. "I think
she'd really be interested in growing this
thing."

to campus was delayed by snow miles away from where they were located.
