The Stanford Improvisers (Simps) will put on
one of their biggest shows of the year this
weekend at the Pigott Theater in Memorial
Auditorium March 10 and 11. The two-hour
Theatresports show will start at 8 p.m. (both
Friday and Saturday evening). Friday will fea
ture a new addition to the performance fol
lowing Theatresports — "Spontaneous
Broadway" which involves improvising musicals. The
following evening will feature what is called Free
Play, "a complete free-for-all," says Simps member
Jill Wurzburg, a sophomore. Current Simps and
alumni will participate in Free Play, which will begin
at 10 p.m.
"We'll be performing a whole new form of iniprov
in which players perform songs from eight different,
inchoate musicals," said Simps member Joanna
Fiduccia. "The audience selects their favorite, which
is then performed in its entirety in the second act. Our
script writers have been toiling madly on that one."
Simps members call the show a must-see.
"It's your only chance — everything you see on
stage has never been seen before and will never be
seen again; also. Spontaneous Broadway is going to
be fantastic," Wurzburg says.

The Spontaneous Broadway segment is also a
brand new addition to this quarter's show.
"The players receive suggestions from the audi
ence for song titles, and then they perform that song
as part of their pitch for a musical," says producer
Tom Hurlbutt, a graduate student in computer sci
ence. "The audience votes on which pitch they like
the best, and then the improvisers act out that musi
cal right before the audience's eyes. It's amazing to
think that they're able to sing and act on the fly."
Simp shows are organized quarterly for the Stan
ford community and general public. Each marks the
culmination of eight weeks worth of rehearsal and
class instruction.
"People who are interested in learning more
about improvisation can take 'Drama 103,' offered
during the fall and winter quarters." Hurlbutt says.
The purpose of the Simps is to provide curriculum
and guidance for a select group of students that show
aptitude and talent in the study of improvisation.
There is an audition that is held about twice a year for
the show in order to select new group members. After
that, rehearsals begin — demanding large time com
mitments on the part of members.
"On average, 1 probably spend six hours a week
doing Slmps, between practice,class and shows," says

junior Deshka Foster, a Simps member.
Jeff Russell, Class of 2005, jokingly adds, "I'm still
hoping to fit a meal or two in before the show."
In the upcoming show, two teams will perform
against each other at Theatresports. Judges or audi
ence members are responsible for scoring perform
ances, and usually, an emcee is present to keep things
under control.
"Everything in a Simps show is completely impro
vised,on the spot," says junior Troy Steinmetz. "Audi
ence members will probably laugh, maybe cry and
definitely have a great time. We do everything from
improvised musicals to scenes with audience volun
teers, just using what we have and what we make to
tell the story."
Audience participation is emphasized and en
couraged.
"The shows will be stellar." Fiduccia says. "We've
been rehearsing day and night for about eight weeks,
and I think we've got our lines and blocking down
pat. The choreography has been tricky, but we com
missioned the ballet mistress from the San Francisco
Opera to refine our execution.This weekend's shows
may be some of the most complex to grace Stanford's
campus in seven years."
TTie Simps have been working hard to put togeth

er a comprehensive show and are enthusiastic about
the results.
"All of the performers are fantastic," Hurlbutt
says. "They have great energy, have fun playing with
one another and are a blast to watch. We've put in a
lot of time into this show, and we hope our energy
transfers to the audience."
"1 try to think about it as little as possible, to avoid
overwhelming myself with the grandeur," Russell
says. "Unfortunately, I'm not doing very well so far.
The thrall of improv tends to grip your every waking
and sleeping moment. Oh. the dreams..."
The Stanford Simps also appear regularly at
dorms and houses on campus over the course of the
year.
"Throughout the quarter we tend to have a dorm
show every week as well as doing workshops both on
campus and at other schools in the area," Foster says.
Many students are looking forward to the event.
"1 really like the Simps," says junior Pablo Pozo.
"They are funny."
Simps members hope there will be large turnout.
"Bring a friend or seven," Steinmetz says.
Tickets are $5 with SUID,SB without; after 10 p.m.
the price will be reduced to $3 with SUID and $5
without. Everyone is welcome.

stage has never been seen before and will never be
seen again; also. Spontaneous Broadway is going to
be fantastic," Wurzburg says.

The Spontaneous Broadway segment is also a
brand new addition to this quarter's show.
"The players receive suggestions from the audi
ence for song titles, and then they perform that song
as part of their pitch for a musical," says producer
Tom Hurlbutt, a graduate student in computer sci
ence. "The audience votes on which pitch they like
the best, and then the improvisers act out that musi
cal right before the audience's eyes. It's amazing to
think that they're able to sing and act on the fly."
Simp shows are organized quarterly for the Stan
ford community and general public. Each marks the
culmination of eight weeks worth of rehearsal and
class instruction.
"People who are interested in learning more
about improvisation can take 'Drama 103,' offered
during the fall and winter quarters." Hurlbutt says.
The purpose of the Simps is to provide curriculum
and guidance for a select group of students that show
aptitude and talent in the study of improvisation.
There is an audition that is held about twice a year for
the show in order to select new group members. After
that, rehearsals begin — demanding large time com
mitments on the part of members.
"On average, 1 probably spend six hours a week
doing Slmps, between practice,class and shows," says

junior Deshka Foster, a Simps member.
Jeff Russell, Class of 2005, jokingly adds, "I'm still
hoping to fit a meal or two in before the show."
In the upcoming show, two teams will perform
against each other at Theatresports. Judges or audi
ence members are responsible for scoring perform
ances, and usually, an emcee is present to keep things
under control.
"Everything in a Simps show is completely impro
vised,on the spot," says junior Troy Steinmetz. "Audi
ence members will probably laugh, maybe cry and
definitely have a great time. We do everything from
improvised musicals to scenes with audience volun
teers, just using what we have and what we make to
tell the story."
Audience participation is emphasized and en
couraged.
"The shows will be stellar." Fiduccia says. "We've
been rehearsing day and night for about eight weeks,
and I think we've got our lines and blocking down
pat. The choreography has been tricky, but we com
missioned the ballet mistress from the San Francisco
Opera to refine our execution.This weekend's shows
may be some of the most complex to grace Stanford's
campus in seven years."
TTie Simps have been working hard to put togeth

er a comprehensive show and are enthusiastic about
the results.
"All of the performers are fantastic," Hurlbutt
says. "They have great energy, have fun playing with
one another and are a blast to watch. We've put in a
lot of time into this show, and we hope our energy
transfers to the audience."
"1 try to think about it as little as possible, to avoid
overwhelming myself with the grandeur," Russell
says. "Unfortunately, I'm not doing very well so far.
The thrall of improv tends to grip your every waking
and sleeping moment. Oh. the dreams..."
The Stanford Simps also appear regularly at
dorms and houses on campus over the course of the
year.
"Throughout the quarter we tend to have a dorm
show every week as well as doing workshops both on
campus and at other schools in the area," Foster says.
Many students are looking forward to the event.
"1 really like the Simps," says junior Pablo Pozo.
"They are funny."
Simps members hope there will be large turnout.
"Bring a friend or seven," Steinmetz says.
Tickets are $5 with SUID,SB without; after 10 p.m.
the price will be reduced to $3 with SUID and $5
without. Everyone is welcome.
