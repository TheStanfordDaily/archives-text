# Branner sucks? Well, its dining does
## 
### 
This week our intrepid near-vegetarians, weary
from midterms and eager to save fossil fuels, de
eided to investigate a dining option close to home
yet shrouded in intrigue and mystery — Branner dining.
Liebner, as a proud member of the class of'Ohhhhh
hh6. missed out on the mythic pleasures of Branner, re
furbished during her freshmen year. Louk. as a transfer
student, was never even freshman-eligible. However,
having heard good things about it his sophomore year,
he and other renegade Stern residents traipsed by the
dozens over to Branner to enjoy a brand-new dining
hall with goblet-sized soda glasses and amazing faire.
Eager to relive his sophomore experience, Louk
brought Liebner to the vaulted ceiling, chandelier-clad
dining room. Although it was 6:15 p.m., the Wilbur rush
time, the dining hall seemed to be clearing out.
As Louk and Liebner approached the 'servery' (yes,
we're still in a torrid love affair with the word), they
were greeted with shock and awe by names-changed-to
protect-the-innocent Elizabeth, an RA in Branner.
"What are you guys doing here?!" she asked.
Vaguely vegetarian and therefore generally opti
mistic and naive about life. Liebner and Louk assumed
that Elizabeth was surprised and excited to see them.
How mistaken they were. Instead, she warned them in
horror to go back whence they came — the food at
Branner isn't good anymore.
After explaining they were actually there on column
review business rather than pleasure. Liebner and Louk
made their way into the servery...
...and were immediately under-whelmed .'Hie dining
hall didn't seem to serve a lot of food, let alone vegetar
ian food. Liebner observed that the lentils, were, well,
lame, but the only source of vegetarian protein at Bran
ner. As Liebner cased the joint for other protein op
tions, the more pessimistic Louk headed straight for the

burger station — hoping, like in countless previous
Stanford dining occasions, the gardenburger would res
cue Louk from an otherwise protein-free meal.
When Louk saw no gardenburgers laying out for
consumption, he assumed that meant Branner made
them fresh to order. He eagerly asked the chef to whip
him up a gardenburger.
"A what?" the cook asked.
"Gardenburger?" He looked puzzled, then asked an
other cook. Apparently, they didn't have that.
"Boca burger?," Louk followed up, with his best
"please-sir-can-I-have-s'more" Oliver Twist face. And
just as in a Dickens novel, this too he was denied. With
one "Never heard of that" from the chef, all of Louk's
hopes, dreams and aspirations for Branner dining came
crashing down.
Meanwhile, Liebner was making an equally fruitless
(literally — where were the fresh fruit options?!) expe
dition through Branner's measly salad bar. No spinach,
scant options and worst of all, no tofu! Liebner came up
equally short at the pasta bar — the spaghetti with meat
sauce wasn't going to cut it.and the pasta with creamy
pesto sauce was almost out.
As Liebner contemplated how a vegan would sur
vive a year here without needing supplemental IV nutri
tional treatments. Louk hit the jackpot — the waffle
bar! He loaded a waffle up with all the usual brunch fix
ings: strawberries, maple syrup and chocolate chips! As

Previously on Destination Dining...

Liebner chided Louk's sugar and carb-heavy plate (and
his tendency to use exclamation marks when on a sugar
high), both realized that nearly all of Branner's vegetar
ian dining options were refined carbs — pastas, white
rices, waffles, French fries and desserts.
In fact, the only thing the Branner dining seemed to
do well was dessert. Though Branner is ostensibly the
"destination" for Mongolian BBQ "dining," it mostly
seemed to accommodate a raging sweet tooth.
The strawberry shortcake definitely hit the spot, and
the Froyo and various toppings were scrumptious —
except for the candy corn. Louk speculated it had been
left over from Branner's Halloween party. When he
reentered the dining hall and took a bite, the crack of the
rock-hard candy corn echoed throughout the vaulted,
nearly empty room.
Where were all the eager freshmen stocking up on
fruits, veggies and whole grains? It was only on the way
out that Liebner and Louk realized yet another sad fact
about Branner dining — it's only open until 6:30 p.m.
for dinner. What about late practices, dinnertime meet

ings and irritatingly-scheduled IHUM sections? Appar
ently, it's off to Wilbur, Manzanita or Stern with you.
This is probably just as well. As Louk and Liebner
staggered back to Wilbur from carb-induced, protein
deprived sugar comas, they realized that the freshmen
15 that both assumed they had avoided by crafting deft,
well-balanced quasi-vegetarian entrees complete with
greens and grains was in actuality most likely side
stepped simply by not living in Branner.
It was then that the two appreciated that one good
thing did come out of this meal — three years' worth of
bitterness about missing out on Branner was evaporat
ing faster than the water on the steamed veggies they
were looking forward to back at Wilbur.
Bowls of Cereal: 0, because Branner has only TWO
cereals to choose from!
Tofu blocks: Also 0! A double bagel, if you will, be
cause they didn't even have whole-wheat ones!
The Background on this column: Both seniors, David
Louk and Christina Liebner are on a mission to check
oat Stanford Dining fare specifically for the veggie-in
clined. Follow them next time as they traipse across
campus, hunting down vegetarian protein sources and
fresh assortments of fruits and vegetables.
Food rating system: Food quality is rated in bowls of
cereal: the number of bowls of cereal that we, com
bined, consumed at the meal. The more bowls of cereal,
the less good the food is. Vegetarian options are meas
ured in blocks of tofu, with one being very little and five
being a full tofu bar complete with tofu dipping sauces.

Christina Liebner and David Louk enjoy going for
"swims" in Lake Lag and napping while watching
Gilmore Girls, respectively. If you share these interests and
don't have plans for the weekend, email them at
