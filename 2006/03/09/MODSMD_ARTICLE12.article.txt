## Editorial The 						Great Firewall of China must come down 
### 
In recent months, American tech giants
have had to grapple with their response
to the economic and technological boom
in China.
Early this year, Microsoft agreed to cen
sor blog content on its MSN Spaces service.
Google agreed to block Web sites that the
Chinese government considers illegal, in
cluding those of human rights groups, Ti
betan independence movements and reli
gious organizations.
Yahoo! provided information that led to
the conviction of dissident journalist Shi
Tao, who is currently serving a 10-year sen
tence for leaking information about govern
ment propaganda to the press; due to its ac
tions, Yahoo! is being reviewed by a human
rights subcommittee of Congress.
It's one thing to refrain from imposing
American ideals of democracy and free
speech onto the Chinese people, but it is
quite another to aid the Chinese govern
ment in its attempts to clamp down on free
speech.
Yet these Internet companies argue that
it's necessary to cooperate with the Chinese
government in order to provide the coun
try's people with access to more informa
tion than they've ever had before. Also,
Yahoo! points out that the United States
and the international community need to
regulate the high-tech industry in China in
stead of pointing fingers at alleged viola
tions.
As socially conscious students poised to
enter the governmental, non-governmental
and corporate spheres, we are faced with
two questions. First, is the infringement of
free speech and human rights ever justified,
even with the benefit of Chinese people
with greater access to information? Second,
should companies wait for government reg
ulation before doing the right thing?
Should Yahoo! be providing the Chinese
government with information regarding its
dissidents,helping the Chinese to implement
laws that the international community rec
ognizes as human rights violations? Should
Microsoft be shutting down its bloggers to
appease the government, restricting free
dom of speech? Should Google comply with
the restrictive rules blocking "illegal sites"?
Actions like these call into question our
legitimacy as a nation. Just how committed

is America to freedom of speech and infor
mation? Is it justified to consider such cen
sorship to he a short-term sacrifice on the
path to a more democratic China?
To the outraged, disappointed or per
turbed American consumer, there is a more
personal betrayal: Google has made its rep
utation as a magnanimous and socially-con
scious corporation. It has made its millions
by appealing to the social consciousness of
its clients with its motto "Don't be evil." To
these consumers, Google's compliance with
the Chinese government's undemocratic
regulations amounts to a serious breach of
confidence. This betrayal strikes especially
close to home not only because Stanford is a
socially-conscious campus, but also because
a significant number of Stanford graduates
go on to work at Google right here in the
Bay Area.
'ITie crisis of high-tech censorship in
China was inevitable with the growth of the
Internet and the opening of the communist
country's borders to international capital
ism. The actions of Google, Yahoo! and Mi
crosoft represent a moment of reckoning
for the international community and for the
United States. These actions bring up the
question: Are our democratic values flexi
ble when corporate profit is at stake?
We believe that Yahoo!'s demand for
regulation in China's high-tech industry is
timely and sound. We want to see this area
addressed by our elected representatives in
a way that recognizes the moral dilemma
therein and accords with our democratic
values. Nevertheless, Google, Microsoft and
Yahoo! need to make good-faith efforts to
address this dilemma even without govern
ment intervention. These companies must
be honest with consumers.
But above all. they should use their com
mercial and economic leverage to pressure
China to reviewing their current practices of
Internet censorship. As much as these com
panies want to gain access to hundreds of
millions of Internet users, China needs to
court these companies for the investments
and technology transfer that accompany
them. There is room for significant leverage
and a space for business to exert a social in
fluence for good. Google, Microsoft and
Yahoo! should seize this opportunity — we,
the consumers, demand it.
