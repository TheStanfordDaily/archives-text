# With Liberty and Justice for All?

I write today unconcerned with how our po
litical views may differ. Unconcerned that
you may think I'm a bleeding heart liberal
who doesn't care enough about the War on
Terror and our national security. Uncon
cerned whether you take political issues seri
ously or are apathetic toward them. I write as
a citizen of the United States and I am dis
gusted by my country.
Last week. The New York limes ran a
story on a secret U.S. prison in Bamar,
Afghanistan. The prison, 40 miles north of
Kabul, houses approximately 500 uncharged
terror suspects for undetermined lengths of
time. While the facility was initially designed
as a staging area for suspects on their way to
U.S. prisons, inmates have been held there for
two to three years. One Pentagon official
noted that the average time spent in Bamar is
14.5 months.
When the United States began using
Bamar in 2003, conditions were, to put it
mildly, inhumane. Inmates were held in wire
cages. They used buckets for latrines. They
slept on thin mats on the floor under harsh
florescent lighting that was rarely, if ever,
turned off.
The Pentagon boasts that improvements
were made last year. Detainees are now held
in larger cells enclosed by stacked razor wire
and use flushing toilets. However, prisoners at
Bamar still rarely see daylight and have no
area for exercise.
"It was like a cage,"said Hajji Lalai Mama,
a 60-year-old tribal elder from the Spinbaldak
who was released last June after spending two
years in the camp. Mama compared the camp

to a zoo in Pakistan when he added,"Like the
cages in Karachi where they put animals: It
was like that."
And where does the United States get the
gall to treat humans this way? From our histo
ry, of course.
The conditions at Bamar naturally raise
comparisons with those at Guantanamo Bay.
the subject of recent court scrutiny. Unlike
Guantanamo inmates however, the prisoners
at Bamar are unable to consult lawyers and
many have little, if any, knowledge of why
they are being held. Prisoners appear before
Enemy Combatant Review Boards where no
charges are brought against them, where they
have no access to a lawyer and where "The
detainee is not involved at all," according to a
prison official.
More disturbing than the actual condi
tions of the prisons are the torture methods
used against the inmates, many of whom
claim they shouldn't be there in the first place.
Using the barking of attack dogs to scare new
prisoners; chaining inmates' arms to the ceil
ings of their cells while striking their knees
with clubs — such torture raises comparisons
to those used in Abu Ghraib. Oh, and let me

add here that if nothing so far has shocked
you, then go to TheMemoryHole.org and
look at the recent photographs of inmates at
Abu Ghraih.
Evidently the constitutional principles
upon which our country was founded —
those of due process, right to counsel and pro
tection from cruel and unusual punishment
— don't apply to our prisons used in the War
on Terror. Our country has now repeatedly
decided that the rest of the world doesn't
share the basic rights we so adamantly de
fend.
But we continue to trumpet our way as the
best way. We shroud places like Bamar in se
crecy as we claim to spread Democracy and
Freedom to all mankind. We pronounce that
ours is a noble and humanitarian quest.
Yet in pursuit of our goal, we capture and
torture anyone that we have the slightest in
clination might stand in our way. We deny
them rights that we ourselves have deemed
fundamental and in so doing reduce ourselves
to the basest of nations.
Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky once
wrote, "The degree of civilization in a society
can be judged by entering its prisons." These
prison camps should not be out of sight, out of
mind. While you and 1 may not be hanging
prisoners up by their arms or hitting their legs,
we are part of the society that is.These camps
and their mutilation of prisoners are a reflec
tion of you and me. I don't know about you,
but 1 want no part in it.
