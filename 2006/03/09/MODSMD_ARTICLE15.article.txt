						Modern Fairytale
## Paved with good intentions 
### 
During our four day orientation in
Plettenberg Bay, the students in my
study abroad program were
brought to several different places that
were meant to be "eye-opening" about life
in parts of South Africa. For me they were,
just not in the manner intended.
We visited a children's shelter that pro
vides schooling, food and other resources
for kids whose parents may not always be
able to provide them with adequate care. It
was also where I was referred to as
"whitey" for the first time. I've been called
a "gringo" before, but the word cuts deeper
in English.
We were greeted in the driveway by the
director of the center who explained what
the center does while a dozen little kids
pressed their faces to the window of the
school-house behind her and waved at us.
"We don't want these children on the
streets, learning to beg from whitey," she
said at one point. "It's not right."
When she finished, we went inside to
play with the kids. One of the girls in my
program had brought stickers and passed
sheets of colorful hearts and stars out to all
of us. As we approached them, the kids
crowded around us, some cupping their
hands and holding them out in traditional
supplicant posture and I wondered if we
weren't doing more harm than good.
I followed the director into a small dor
mitory where a baby slept. She explained
that the baby and his slightly older sister
were AIDS orphans (although she used the
euphemism "His mother was very sick")
that live at the shelter permanently; most of
the other children went home at some point
during the day The baby, who was HIV pos
itive, had spent his first months of life strug
gling to survive but was now thriving.
"I believe God spared me to take care of
him," the director told us. "The children are
my whole world." She had been diagnosed
with diabetes and had significantly changed
the way she was living to cope with the dis
ease.
"The older girl cried the other day. And
I asked her, 'Why are you crying?' i miss
my mom,' she said. 'You go to hell,' I said to

her,'l'm your mother now.' But inside my
heart just breaks for her."
It's not that she is unkind; the rhetoric of
tough love prevails here, where polo
grounds are within walking distance of
shantytowns.
The next day we visited a squatter camp.
The camp began as a small community of
farm workers employed on the land. It grew
into a fair-sized shantytown as family mem
bers and homeless poverty-stricken people
moved in. When the government tried to
evict the residents, some fought back and
established their legal right to the land.
The valley enveloping the camp is beau
tiful and the houses full of "character," as
our romantically-inclined liaison to the
community described it. Ironically, much
higher-quality housing sits on top of the
hillside, overlooking the nailed-together
planks, zinc roofs, garbage-lined dirt roads
and shipping container-turned-stores of the
squatter camp.
As we were led through town, a relative
ly new member of the community ap
proached a few girls in my group and spoke
to them. 1 didn't learn his whole story but he
seemed like a positive force â€” ambitious
and full of plans for improving the area.
One girl said later that he told her he sells
"ganja" on the side and is looking for some
one to take him to America. Which, in the
end, seemed to be what the group of us ac
tually represented: money and opportunity
for access to America. Currently, the resi
dents' unemployment rate is somewhere
around 85 percent.
Later on, a youth singing group brought
their speaker and keyboard out to the cen
tral blacktop and sang for us. We danced
with some of the little kids who had been
following us and the crowd quickly grew as
curious residents came to see what was
going on. By the end. many people were
dancing and singing with us and there was
that rare feeling in the air when you realize
you're part of a moment that will stick with
you for a long time.
When the singers finished, we borrowed
