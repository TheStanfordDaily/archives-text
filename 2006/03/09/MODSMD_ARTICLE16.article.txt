## Confused about the Greeks? Let me explain 
### CYNTHIA BENIN 
Confused Chris, I'm writing to applaud
you for your column on the so-called
"Greek" system ("Fraternities and
sororities: It's all Greek to me," Mar. 7). I'm
sure the Greeks appreciate you defending
their honor by pointing out that Greek life has
little to do with Mediterranean culture. I'm
convinced, however, that your confusion
about Greek life stems from a lack of informa
tion and can be easily remedied.
Your gravest concern is the use of "ran
dom" Greek letters in the names of these or
ganizations. You will be relieved to learn that
these letters represent principles that the or
ganization particularly values. Only initiated
members know these associations, but take
the example of the national religious studies
honor society, Theta Alpha Kappa: Theta is
the first letter of the Greek word Theos,
meaning "God"; Alpha is the first letter of the
Anthropos, meaning "human"; and Kappa is
the first letter of Koinonia, which means
"community". Therefore Theta Alpha Kappa
appropriately represents the three areas of
most importance to members of this organi
zation.
In regard to your grievance that the use of
a foreign alphabet makes it impossible for
anyone to tell one Greek house from the next.
I must caution you: You're at Stanford now.
The assumption that "no one really knows
what Greek letters look like" may be true of

your high school classmates, hut it is egre
giously misapplied to our community. As for
your own illiteracy, a few minutes spent re
viewing these symbols would he well worth
your time, especially if you plan on taking any
math courses in the future. But perhaps you're
right; more conventional names would make
these houses more convenient to locate on
drunken weekend nights. Maybe we should
enforce a mandatory renaming of all non-
English row houses — including Haus Mit
teleuropa, Slavianskii Dom, and Casa Ital
iana. After all, we are in America.
Oh, and those ethnic fraternities and soror
ities are the worst! How dare they muddy the
Greek alphabet by associating it with groups
who engage in such decidedly un-Greek activ
ities as reading theTorah and cooking tamales.
I'm sure lightning would strike from the
heights of Mt. Olympus if the gods knew the
Hebrews were thus defiling their letters. Cer
tainly we could find more, as you term it, "de
scriptive" names for these groups. How about
"The Big Schnozes?" Or "The Beaners"?
Even if you maintain that the names of
these organizations are random,you can hard
ly argue that their membership is arbitrary.
The men and women of ethnic fraternities and
sororities who celebrate their mutual culture
and values are no more arbitrarily chosen
then the members of the LGBT or NAACP.
And what of the non-ethnic fraternities and
sororities? True, there are certain similarities,
but each fraternity and sorority has its distinct

personality. You admit this yourself in your
statement that you have come to associate
houses with specific stereotypes. Could it not
be that mutual interests and hobbies bring
these students together in the first place? Men
rush Phi Psi to be with other geeks, Sigma Nu
to meet other wholesome "good guys," SAE
to bond with other sex offenders. (Rapists
unite!) I, for one,chose my particular sorority
for its reputation for naked pillow fights.
The area where you have the most to learn
is that of "commitment to any sort of external
object or goal." Greeks at Stanford are some
of the most active students within the school
and in local community. Through its annual
charity race, Theta raised almost $20,000 in
support of Court Appointed Special Advo
cates. Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. recent
ly held its second annual Bayou Fashion Show
to raise funds for Katrina relief. Pi Phi tutors
children in East Palo Alto schools twice a
week. Every Wednesday morning. KA pre
pares and serves breakfast to local homeless
at a shelter. The claim that Greek organiza
tions have no dedication to their community
beyond the nearest keg vendor is offensive
and plainly incorrect.
1 hope this letter has cleared things up a bit.
Right now I'm going to go to the kitchen, eat
some leftover falafel and drink a bottle of
wine with my sisters. Zeus would be proud.
