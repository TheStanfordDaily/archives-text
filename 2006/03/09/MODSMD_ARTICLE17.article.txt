Law schools need to
accept military recruiters
The Supreme Court ruled Monday that
the government can force law schools to
grant access to military recruiters as a condi
tion of federal funds. The court unanimously
rejected FAIR'S claims that the conditions of
these funds violated their First Amendment
rights. Chief Justice Roberts wrote that al
lowing recruitment "does not affect the law
schools' speech, because the schools are not
speaking when they host interviews and re
cruiting receptions."
FAIR's claim that granting access to re
cruiters reflects agreement with military
policies underestimates the intelligence of
the public and the law students. Contrary to
the 2000 Supreme Court ruling allowing the
Boy Scouts of America to deny membership
to a homosexual troop leader to maintain its
message, military recruiters never become

part of the law school in which they recruit.
Surely the nation's brightest legal students
can discern between the messages of the mili
tary and the school. Few would argue that
granting access to a recruiter allows the mili
tary to speak for the school. A military re
cruiter is attempting to seek employees, not
express an anti-homosexual message. To view
compelled access as an expression of agree
ment is naive because the schools are not re
quired to show any other form of support for
the military. In fact, the school can organize
protests against the military recruiters to show
their disapproval. If students disagree with the
message of the military, they can and should
avoid these recruiters. However, by denying
access to recruiters in this crucial time follow
ing the Sep. 11 attacks, law schools are just
harming both the military and their fellow stu
dents who are seeking employment.

DKE apologizes for Jello Bash ads
As President of the Sigma Rho Chapter of
Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity here at
Stanford, I am writing on behalf of my chap
ter to apologize to the Stanford community
for the recent offensive advertising cam
paign for Jello Bash.
Not only are these ads in poor taste, but
they also create a hostile environment for
women, tantamount to sexual harassment.
This is embarrassing both to DKE and
the fraternity community as a whole. In the
weeks to come, DKE will do everything it
can to atone and compensate for the harm it
has done to Stanford, to the Inter-Fraternity
Council and especially to women. We are
immediately removing the flyers, and feel
free to remove them yourself.
