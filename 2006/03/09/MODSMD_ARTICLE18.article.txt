## Clean Air Act perpetuates environmental racism 
### CAITLIN SANFORD SETH SILVERMAN 
The proposed revisions to the Clean Air
Act's regulation of particulates repre
sent a conscious decision by the federal
government to ignore a certain and continual
threat to the American people. Members of
Students for a Sustainable Stanford object to
this failure to protect the environment and the
weak revisions to the Clean Air Act offered by
the EPA.
Particulate pollution is composed of soot
from industrial smokestacks, diesel exhaust, fine
aerosols, and toxic metals like lead, copper, nick
el, zinc and cadmium. Particulates are extreme
ly harmful to human health as they cause chron
ic asthma, heart attacks, strokes and lung cancer.
According to EPA data from 1997, particulates
cause premature death in 35,000 Americans an
nually. Here in California, where we suffer from
some of the worst particulate emissions, over
2,600 people die every year from hazardous con
centrations of particulate emissions. For each in
crease of 10 micrograms per cubic meter of fine
particles in the air, the risk of death from any
cause increases by 11 to 17 percent.
Empirical evidence shows that the brunt of
the health risks associated with particulates is
born disproportionately by low-income and

minority communities, making this issue an
environmental, public health, and civil rights
concern. Forty-six percent of the nation's pub
lic housing units are located within about a
mile of factories that have reported toxic emis
sions to the EPA. In low-income communities
in New York City, where buses and trucks
crisscross neighborhoods and industrial facili
ties dot the landscape, hospitalization rates
due to asthma were 21 percent higher than in
other communities.
Black Americans are 79 percent more likely
than white Americans to live in neighborhoods
where industrial pollution is suspected of posing
the greatest health danger. In 19 states, blacks
are more than twice as likely as whites to live in
neighborhoods where air pollution creates the
greatest health threat.
Here in California, communities of color are
almost three times more likely to breathe heav
ily-polluted air and low income residents are ex
posed to 17 percent more particulate matter
than better resourced communities. Just as the
burdens of current pollution fall disproportion
ately on low income and minority communities,
the benefits of stronger regulation would make
the most significant impact on them as well.
Instead, however, the revision to the Clean
Air Act offered by this administration further ex

acerbates this environmental injustice and envi
ronmental racism; it also directly contradicts Ex
ecutive Order 12898 issued by President Clinton
in 1994 to address environmental injustice in the
United States. This weak revision would, of
course, not be the first time in the past year that
President Bush has knowingly abandoned low
income communities and communities of color
in the face of environmental hazards; sadly, it
seems that it will not be the last.
Power plants and diesel engines are the most
substantial polluters with regard to particulates.
One way to begin to address concerns about
particulate emissions is to shift from a petrole
um-based diesel to biodiesel. Replacing petrole
um diesel with biodiesel reduces particulates by
47%.
The Clean Air Act instructs that prescriptive
air regulations be determined solely based on
the protection of public health.The current revi
sion does not account for what is supposed to be
singular concern for public health. Such a revi
sion runs contrary to the prescriptions of the
Clean Air Act, which along with the Clean
Water Act, NEPA, FIFRA, CERCLA and the
Endangered Species Act form the bedrock of
environmental protections in the United States.
Unfortunately, the revision in question is not the
first time this administration has worked aggres

sively to undermine the environmental safe
guards that have protected Americans and our
environment for the past three and a half
decades.
Instead, such an assault on foundational en
vironmental law is routine for the Bush admin
istration. In its first five years in office.it has en
gaged in a flagrant and unrestrained attack on
virtually every environmental protection safe
guarding U.S. citizens and our environment.To
fight this trend, the Bush administration must
strengthen regulation of particulate standards
before this revision to the Clean Air Act is fi
nalized. The standards must be set at the most
protective levels based on the recommenda
tions of the scientific review of particulate
emissions. This level of protection would mean
annual standards limited to 12 micrograms per
cubic meter and daily standards maxing out at
25 micrograms per cubic meter.
As concerned members of the public, we
urge the EPA to strengthen the current revision
to the Clean Air Act before it is finalized in Sep
tember.

vironmental law is routine for the Bush admin
istration. In its first five years in office.it has en
gaged in a flagrant and unrestrained attack on
virtually every environmental protection safe
guarding U.S. citizens and our environment.To
fight this trend, the Bush administration must
strengthen regulation of particulate standards
before this revision to the Clean Air Act is fi
nalized. The standards must be set at the most
protective levels based on the recommenda
tions of the scientific review of particulate
emissions. This level of protection would mean
annual standards limited to 12 micrograms per
cubic meter and daily standards maxing out at
25 micrograms per cubic meter.
As concerned members of the public, we
urge the EPA to strengthen the current revision
to the Clean Air Act before it is finalized in Sep
tember.
