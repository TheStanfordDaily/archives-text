# Don't let politics stand in the way of public welfare

On behalf of the Center on the Environ
ment and Energy of the Stanford chap
ter of the Roosevelt Institution, we
would like to highlight two pressing concerns
about the EPA's proposed changes to the par
ticulate matter standard. First, the EPA has not
portrayed a high commitment to scientific in
tegrity in the present administration and is
under scrutiny by its own scientific advisers.
Second, recent research indicates that particu
lates may be the second leading cause of global
warming.
While it is encouraging that the EPA is con
sidering stricter standards, "stricter" does not
automatically translate to "sufficient." There is
substantial evidence to indicate that EPA ac
tions under the present administration warrant
scrutiny. The Union of Concerned Scientists, in
its 2(X)4 Scientific Integrity in Policymaking re
port, criticized the EPA for withholding an
analysis showing the benefits of a bipartisan al
ternative to President Bush's Clear Skies Act.
Political motivations interfered with the com

munication of clear, objective science in a time
ly manner.
Given this precedent, it is hard to ignore an
NPR report indicating substantial disagree
ment between the EPAs scientific advisers and
its present administrator, Steven Johnson.
After Johnson announced the proposed revi
sions to particulate matter standards, the chair
of EPA's Clean Air Scientific Advisory Board
challenged his decision to override the board's
consensus â€” a consensus that called for both
stricter maximum daily and annual particulate
matter exposure standards. The board's con
sensus was based upon extensive review of the
scientific literature and hearings with public
health advocates. As they stand now, the pro
posals only call for changes in daily exposure
levels, but leave annual exposure maximums
unchanged.
But under this status quo and these contin
ued particulate matter levels, thousands of
Americans will continue to suffer from corre
sponding heart disease, stroke, and respiratory
failure. Commenting on Johnson's decision,
professor of epidemiology at Harvard Univer
sity Joe Schwartz stated,"What the science has

been saying about particles is that [this] deci
sion is going to kill thousands of people per
year. It's not that the science isn't there.
They're just ignoring it." We challenge the
EPA administration to consider the advice of
its own scientific advisory board and to com
mit to lower annual particulate matter stan
dards.
Stricter emissions standards can provide
even more than these well-known public health
benefits. Leading research indicates that the re
striction of particulate emissions could be pos
sibly the most effective method of slowing glob
al warming. Recent publications in the scientif
ic journal Nature and the Journal of Geophysi
cal Research maintain that black carbon partic
ulate matter is a leading factor in global warm
ing. New computer modeling developments by
leading EPA-funded climatologists also show
that black carbon absorbs more radiation than
it reflects, contrary to previous belief. Indeed,
the global warming effect of black carbon is
enough to counter the cooling effect of other
particulates.
Soot containing black carbon has an atmos
pheric lifetime of only a few weeks, yet black

carbon particulates are constantly in the atmos
phere since they are continuously emitted. In
comparison, greenhouse gases like carbon
dioxide and methane have atmospheric life
times of 10 to 1(H) years. Therefore, more strin
gent particulate emissions standards would
have a quicker effect on slowing global climate
change than targeting carbon dioxide and
methane. To quantify this change. Professor
Mark Jacobson of Stanford University CEE es
timates that "eliminating all fossil fuel black
carbon and associated organic matter could
eliminate 20 to 45 percent of such net warming
within three to five years if no other change oc
curred. Reducing carbon dioxide emissions by a
third would have the same effect, but after 50 to
200 years."
As part of the EPAs mission to protect the
public welfare, taking a more aggressive ap
proach on regulating particulates is in order.
