# vs. Arizona Pac-10 Tournament, Staples Center, LA
## Last Chance to Dance Adams-less Arizona aims to end 11-year NCAA run 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
On the eve of today's Pac-10 Tournament
quarterfinal against Arizona at 12:20 p.m.,
coach Trent Johnson was realistic about where
his team stands.
"We're on the bubble for the NIT," said
Johnson, who denied reports that the team
would turn down the chance to host National
Invite Tournament games. "We are going to
enjoy an opportunity to play in games in any
tournament if we get the opportunity. But I
watched the tape from this Saturday, and the
team I saw wasn't any kind of tournament
team."
Sure enough, Saturday's 21-point loss to
Pac-10 regular season champ No. 12 UCLA
(24-6,14-4 Pac-10) capped a trying regular sea
son for the Cardinal (15-12, 11-7), who must
now win the Pac-10 Tournament — or miss the
NCAA Tournament for the first time since
1994.
And while only three victories separate
Stanford from the Big Dance, the Card might as
well save on the airfare to Los Angeles if they
can't dramatically improve their level of play.
Just a month ago, an 8-1 mid-season spurt
had wiped away memories of a horrific start.
But consecutive last-minute losses at Cal and
Gonzaga seemed to knock the wind out of Stan
ford's sails, and now the Cardinal stumbles into
its first, and perhaps only, postseason tourna
ment having won just three of its last eight con
tests.
"I was embarrassed to walk off the floor like
that," senior guard Chris Hernandez said of his
home-finale against UCLA. "To end the game
like that and to play like that was an embarrass
ment for me and the whole team."
The loss to UCLA clinched the Pac-10's five
seed for Stanford, and that seed line makes this
weekend's prospects all the more dim. If Stan
ford can get past four-seed Arizona (18-11,11-
7) — a team it has yet to beat this season —
likely awaiting the Card are the top-seeded
Bruins, whom Stanford has yet to come within
17 points of, let alone beat.

For Stanford to live to fight another day, freshman shooting guard Anthony Goods has
to keep scoring and take pressure off the "Big Three," and the Card need to help senior
forward Matt Haryasz guard the paint, especially now that Adams is gone for the Cats.
Los Angeles' Staples Center,
home of the Tournament and the
NBA's Lakers and Clippers, figures
to be full of fans from nearby UCLA
and sixth-seeded USC (17-12,8-10).
More bad news for Stanford, who is
just 4-9 away from Maples this sea
son.
And if the Card can somehow
overcome a hostile crowd and van
quish the Bruins, the Finals still re
main. There, the Card would likely
face two-seed No. 13 Washington
(24-5,13-5) or three-seed Cal (18-9,
12-6). who is fighting for its NCAA
Tournament life.
All told, bettors at tradesports.
com. one of the Internet's largest
and most respected gambling sites,
value Stanford's chances of winning
the Tournament at just seven per
cent. That 's a 1 -in-14 chance of keep
ing the 11 -year NCAA streak alive.
However. Johnson and his play
ers insist they are focused on Ari
zona. and Stanford does have reason
for optimism in today's quarterfinal.
While the Wildcats swept the season
series, Stanford pushed them to the
limit in both games — a 90-81 over
time thriller in TUcson and a 76-72
nailbiter in Palo Alto.
But Stanford's best reason for op
timism won't even step on the court
tomorrow. Hassan Adams, Arizona's
First Team AII-Pac-10 senior guard.

floor leader and best player, has
been suspended from the Pac-10
Tournament because of a DUI arrest
on Sunday morning.
"It is unfortunate that it hap
pened" said Hernandez, who down
played the incident's effect on the
game. "When we played at Arizona,
they were without Chris Rodgers
and they came out with a fury. Other
guys came out and made big plays,
and I'm sure that's going to happen
again."
Fury or not, to ask Adams' team
mates to replicate his playmaking
ability is one tall order. Adams sim
ply torched the Card in the season
series (40 points, eight steals), and
the Wildcats may struggle to find a
perimeter threat now that he is
gone.
If so. look for senior forward Matt
Haryasz to get lots of help defending
Arizona's Ivan Radenovic. Raden
ovic notched 23 points on just 10
shots from the field in his last battle
with Haryasz, a Page. Ariz, native.
Indeed. Adams' absence is nearly
the only reason the Card is only a
two-point underdog, because while
Stanford has slipped as of late, the
Wildcats have finished on a roll, win
ning five of their last seven.
Ultimately then, though Stanford
may be not have the odds or momen
tum — both today and in days to
come — Hernandez and the Card
still profess faith.
"I think we are capable of any
thing." Hernandez said. "I think we
can still pull it together if things go
well."

Fury or not, to ask Adams' team
mates to replicate his playmaking
ability is one tall order. Adams sim
ply torched the Card in the season
series (40 points, eight steals), and
the Wildcats may struggle to find a
perimeter threat now that he is
gone.
If so. look for senior forward Matt
Haryasz to get lots of help defending
Arizona's Ivan Radenovic. Raden
ovic notched 23 points on just 10
shots from the field in his last battle
with Haryasz, a Page. Ariz, native.
Indeed. Adams' absence is nearly
the only reason the Card is only a
two-point underdog, because while
Stanford has slipped as of late, the
Wildcats have finished on a roll, win
ning five of their last seven.
Ultimately then, though Stanford
may be not have the odds or momen
tum — both today and in days to
come — Hernandez and the Card
still profess faith.
"I think we are capable of any
thing." Hernandez said. "I think we
can still pull it together if things go
well."
On the eve of today's Pac-10 Tournament
quarterfinal against Arizona at 12:20 p.m.,
coach Trent Johnson was realistic about where
his team stands.
"We're on the bubble for the NIT," said
Johnson, who denied reports that the team
would turn down the chance to host National
Invite Tournament games. "We are going to
enjoy an opportunity to play in games in any
tournament if we get the opportunity. But I
watched the tape from this Saturday, and the
team I saw wasn't any kind of tournament
team."
Sure enough, Saturday's 21-point loss to
Pac-10 regular season champ No. 12 UCLA
(24-6,14-4 Pac-10) capped a trying regular sea
son for the Cardinal (15-12, 11-7), who must
now win the Pac-10 Tournament — or miss the
NCAA Tournament for the first time since
1994.
And while only three victories separate
Stanford from the Big Dance, the Card might as
well save on the airfare to Los Angeles if they
can't dramatically improve their level of play.
Just a month ago, an 8-1 mid-season spurt
had wiped away memories of a horrific start.
But consecutive last-minute losses at Cal and
Gonzaga seemed to knock the wind out of Stan
ford's sails, and now the Cardinal stumbles into
its first, and perhaps only, postseason tourna
ment having won just three of its last eight con
tests.
"I was embarrassed to walk off the floor like
that," senior guard Chris Hernandez said of his
home-finale against UCLA. "To end the game
like that and to play like that was an embarrass
ment for me and the whole team."
The loss to UCLA clinched the Pac-10's five
seed for Stanford, and that seed line makes this
weekend's prospects all the more dim. If Stan
ford can get past four-seed Arizona (18-11,11-
7) — a team it has yet to beat this season —
likely awaiting the Card are the top-seeded
Bruins, whom Stanford has yet to come within
17 points of, let alone beat.


ALVIN CHOW/The Stanford Daily
For Stanford to live to fight another day, freshman shooting guard Anthony Goods has
to keep scoring and take pressure off the "Big Three," and the Card need to help senior
forward Matt Haryasz guard the paint, especially now that Adams is gone for the Cats.
Los Angeles' Staples Center,
home of the Tournament and the
NBA's Lakers and Clippers, figures
to be full of fans from nearby UCLA
and sixth-seeded USC (17-12,8-10).
More bad news for Stanford, who is
just 4-9 away from Maples this sea
son.
And if the Card can somehow
overcome a hostile crowd and van
quish the Bruins, the Finals still re
main. There, the Card would likely
face two-seed No. 13 Washington
(24-5,13-5) or three-seed Cal (18-9,
12-6). who is fighting for its NCAA
Tournament life.

the Tournament at just seven per

However. Johnson and his play
ers insist they are focused on Ari

for optimism in today's quarterfinal.
While the Wildcats swept the season
series, Stanford pushed them to the
limit in both games — a 90-81 over
time thriller in TUcson and a 76-72
nailbiter in Palo Alto.
But Stanford's best reason for op
timism won't even step on the court
tomorrow. Hassan Adams, Arizona's

been suspended from the Pac-10
Tournament because of a DUI arrest
on Sunday morning.
"It is unfortunate that it hap

played the incident's effect on the
game. "When we played at Arizona,
they were without Chris Rodgers

guys came out and made big plays,
