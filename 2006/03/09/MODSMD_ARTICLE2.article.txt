# vs. Arizona Pac-10 Tournament, Staples Center, LA
## Last Chance to Dance Adams-less Arizona aims to end 11-year NCAA run 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
On the eve of today's Pac-10 Tournament
quarterfinal against Arizona at 12:20 p.m.,
coach Trent Johnson was realistic about where
his team stands.
"We're on the bubble for the NIT," said
Johnson, who denied reports that the team
would turn down the chance to host National
Invite Tournament games. "We are going to
enjoy an opportunity to play in games in any
tournament if we get the opportunity. But I
watched the tape from this Saturday, and the
team I saw wasn't any kind of tournament
team."
Sure enough, Saturday's 21-point loss to
Pac-10 regular season champ No. 12 UCLA
(24-6,14-4 Pac-10) capped a trying regular sea
son for the Cardinal (15-12, 11-7), who must
now win the Pac-10 Tournament — or miss the
NCAA Tournament for the first time since
1994.
And while only three victories separate
Stanford from the Big Dance, the Card might as
well save on the airfare to Los Angeles if they
can't dramatically improve their level of play.
Just a month ago, an 8-1 mid-season spurt
had wiped away memories of a horrific start.
But consecutive last-minute losses at Cal and
Gonzaga seemed to knock the wind out of Stan
ford's sails, and now the Cardinal stumbles into
its first, and perhaps only, postseason tourna
ment having won just three of its last eight con
tests.
"I was embarrassed to walk off the floor like
that," senior guard Chris Hernandez said of his
home-finale against UCLA. "To end the game
like that and to play like that was an embarrass
ment for me and the whole team."
The loss to UCLA clinched the Pac-10's five
seed for Stanford, and that seed line makes this
weekend's prospects all the more dim. If Stan
ford can get past four-seed Arizona (18-11,11-
7) — a team it has yet to beat this season —
likely awaiting the Card are the top-seeded
Bruins, whom Stanford has yet to come within
17 points of, let alone beat.

For Stanford to live to fight another day, freshman shooting guard Anthony Goods has
to keep scoring and take pressure off the "Big Three," and the Card need to help senior
forward Matt Haryasz guard the paint, especially now that Adams is gone for the Cats.
