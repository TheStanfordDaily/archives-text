## Damn (whiny) Yankess 
### 
Spring is in the air and I, for one,
couldn't be happier. The start
of the Major League Baseball
season is just around the corner, and
with the boys of summer on deck,
summer itself can't be too far be
hind.
And even though we're still
mired in the midst of Spring Train
ing. marveling at the glories of
Triple-A no-names who go 2-3 and
manage not to screw up too badly in
the field, there are still plenty of in
teresting storylines to choose from.
There are the age-old debates, of
course. Which team has improved
the most during the offseason? Can
the current champs repeat? And
how old is Julio Franco really?
But it seems that again, I've been
handed a gift — one of the most po
larizing, riveting and hated figures in
all of sports has once again made the
news with the season not yet under
way
Yes, that's right folks — I'm talk
ing about Yankees owner George
Steinbrenner.
Were you expecting someone
else?
Of course, I say this fully aware of
the media feeding frenzy again
swirling around San Francisco Gi
ants slugger Barry Bonds' use of ille
gal performance-enhancing drugs.
But I'm avoiding that subject.
You read about it in this space yes
terday.and besides, as Chicago Cubs
first baseman Derrek Lee put it,
"People have been alleging him for
ever."
So I ask you, how better to get
away from the storms of media cov
erage circling Bonds' wounded
image than by converging on another
little-loved national figure: TTie Boss.
Maybe you didn't hear, but
George is apparently more than a
little upset that the inaugural World
Baseball Classic will feature so
many of his players. Apparently,
Steinbrenner believes that his 26-
time World Champion Yankees are
getting the raw deal once again.
Steinbrenner went so far as to
have a sign posted at the Spring
Training home of the Yankees, apolo
gizing for the absence of such stars as
Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez, Johnny
Damon and Bernie Williams. The
sign goes on to explain, "The World
Baseball Classic is an event sanc
tioned by the commissioner of Major
League Baseball and The Major
League Baseball Players Associa
tion. The New York Yankess [sic] did
not vote to support this event."
Aside from the paradox that the
Yankees organization is willing to
spend millions of dollars on over
the-hill talent, but not a single penny
on hiring a spell-checker, you have
to wonder about what the Boss is
thinking on this one.

This is the same guy who habitu
ally spends millions of dollars not
necessarily to sign the best players
available, but rather to sign the high
est-profile players. And now he's
upset that because he's signed so
many of these All-Star types, a new
All-Star event is dreamed up that
unfairly affects him? Please.
Steinbrenner's reasoning is sim
ple: The World Baseball Classic is at
worst a more strenuous exhibition
schedule than players are used to and
could cause a lot of injuries. At best, it
is a distraction that will take his play
ers away from their ordinary routines.

And thus, oh travesty of traves
ties, the Yankees have been placed at
(gasp) a competitive disadvantage.
But ultimately, injury is a risk for
any player in Spring Training or the
Classic, and midseason events like
the All-Star Game and Home Run
Derby take the best players in base
ball out of their rhythm every sea
son. And does anyone really think
that even if Steinbrenner had known
the Classic was coming he would
have held off on signing some of
those stars because of worries they
could be hurt in the new internation
al competition?
For me, this is the last straw. I've
been able to accept for a while now
that the Yankees are somewhat of a
necessary evil. Without them to
cheer against, the Big Leagues
would be a lot more boring. But what

I didn't realize was that whining was
a part of the Evil Empire's job de
scription.
Can you think of a franchise in all
of sports that has ever acted in a pet
tier manner with less reason?
As the globalization of baseball
continues, the Classic has the poten
tial to be a monumental event in the
future. And any fan of the kind of in
ternational competition offered by
the World Cup or the Olympics can
surely appreciate the added dimen
sions to baseball that such a compe
tition could bring.
But if it's bad for the Yankees,
then I guess it just wasn't meant to
be, eh, George?
