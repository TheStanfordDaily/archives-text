# LOOKING AHEAD
## Women's basketball team most likely a three, Four or Five seed as Selection Monday nears 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Tara VanDerveer has led Stanford teams to
the postseason for longer than some of her
current players have even been alive. In fact, it
was this legacy of consistent excellence that at
tracted many members of the current team to
the Farm.
But after winning two national titles in her
first seven seasons, VanDerveer has struggled
to get past the regional finals for the last eight
years. The Cardinal have not reached the Final
Four since they made three straight from 1995
to 1997.
"I wanted to be in the NCAAs," freshman
guard Rosalyn Gold-Onwude said.'i remem
ber watching it as a kid. You can go to a small
school and be amazing, but I wanted the
chance to compete for national titles. That's
one of the big reasons I came here."
This time around, the No. 11 Cardinal will
play in their 19th consecutive NCAA Tourna
ment with a chip on their shoulder. Coming off
a disappointing 85-76 overtime loss to UCLA
(20-10,12-6 Pac-10) in the Pac-10Tournament
Finals, Stanford (23-7, 15-3) will not receive
the Pac-10's automatic bid to NCAAs for the
first time since the 2(X) 1-2002 season.
"It was an extremely devastating loss,"
Gold-Onwude said. "But we've had time to
think, and it will stay with us. Going into the Fi
nals, I thought we were peaking, but maybe the
game shows that there's much more to come
[in terms of growth] and that there's a much
bigger prize at the end."
With a weekend off before Selection Mon
day, the Cardinal won't know for another five
days whom they will play or where they will be
going. In the meantime, all they can do is prac
tice and wait for the selection committee to de
cide their seed.
"The UCLA loss still pains us, but we've got
to turn it into a positive," junior forward
Kristin Newlin said. "We need to make it fuel
our team. In practice, we're going to have to go
over every situation and prepare like every
game is our last, because it could be our last."
Stanford knows better than most schools

what a "weird science" the NCAA tourna
ment selection process can be. Last years
team had a 29-2 record, was the consensus No.
I team in both the AP and ESPN/USA Today
Polls, but still somehow ended up slotted as a
number two seed.
This year, the situation seems a little less
cut-and-dry for the Cardinal (23-7, 15-3 Pac
-10). Before the finals upset, Stanford was No.
II in the AP poll while a slightly lower No. 15
in the ESPN/USA Today poll. New polls come
out every Monday,so Stanford won't know the
effect of the UCLA loss until the selection
show.
Another factor that is considered in seed
ing is the team's RPI, which also fluctuates de
pending on the source.The NCAA website has
Stanford dropping from No. 17 to No. 18 after
the UCLA loss, while ESPN has kept Stanford
at No. 15.
In an attempt to sort out the details before
hand, ESPN's ever-popular "bracketology,"
updated daily by analyst Charlie Creme, pre
dicts the entire NCAA tournament seeding.
Despite the loss to UCLA in the Pac-10 Finals,
Creme still has Stanford holding at a No. 3
seed in the Bridgeport, Conn., regional. In this
scenario, Stanford would play Sacred Heart, a
member of the Northeastern Conference, and
potentially meet top-seed Duke in the region
al finals. But all this speculation falls on deaf
ears when it comes to the Stanford women
themselves.
"Thinking about it is just wasted energy be
cause we're not in control of our seeding,"
Newlin said. "There's no telling what we can
do because in the game now, no one is head
and-shoulders above the rest. [As an exam
ple], we were as high as a six seed my freshman
year and we made it to the Elite Eight, and
then last year's Elite Eight, so you never know
what can happen."
Based upon their rankings, RPI and
strength of schedule — their out-of-confer
ence schedule included challenges like No. 7
Tennessee and Boston College in Chestnut
Hill — Stanford could be looking realistically
at anywhere between a three and a five seed.
But regardless of how things change in the
next few days, the task is the same.
"For me personally, it's whoever we need to
go through," Gold-Onwude said. "Personally,
I'm now taking each game at a time. When
we're on the floor, all of us are leaders. I don't
sense any anxiousness. I'd follow any of these
girls into battle, and I don't doubt our heart."

ment with a chip on their shoulder. Coming off
a disappointing 85-76 overtime loss to UCLA
(20-10,12-6 Pac-10) in the Pac-10Tournament
Finals, Stanford (23-7, 15-3) will not receive
the Pac-10's automatic bid to NCAAs for the
first time since the 2(X) 1-2002 season.
"It was an extremely devastating loss,"
Gold-Onwude said. "But we've had time to
think, and it will stay with us. Going into the Fi
nals, I thought we were peaking, but maybe the
game shows that there's much more to come
[in terms of growth] and that there's a much
bigger prize at the end."
With a weekend off before Selection Mon
day, the Cardinal won't know for another five
days whom they will play or where they will be
going. In the meantime, all they can do is prac
tice and wait for the selection committee to de
cide their seed.
"The UCLA loss still pains us, but we've got
to turn it into a positive," junior forward
Kristin Newlin said. "We need to make it fuel
our team. In practice, we're going to have to go
over every situation and prepare like every
game is our last, because it could be our last."
Stanford knows better than most schools

what a "weird science" the NCAA tourna
ment selection process can be. Last years
team had a 29-2 record, was the consensus No.
I team in both the AP and ESPN/USA Today
Polls, but still somehow ended up slotted as a
number two seed.
This year, the situation seems a little less
cut-and-dry for the Cardinal (23-7, 15-3 Pac
-10). Before the finals upset, Stanford was No.
II in the AP poll while a slightly lower No. 15
in the ESPN/USA Today poll. New polls come
out every Monday,so Stanford won't know the
effect of the UCLA loss until the selection
show.
Another factor that is considered in seed
ing is the team's RPI, which also fluctuates de
pending on the source.The NCAA website has
Stanford dropping from No. 17 to No. 18 after
the UCLA loss, while ESPN has kept Stanford
at No. 15.
In an attempt to sort out the details before
hand, ESPN's ever-popular "bracketology,"
updated daily by analyst Charlie Creme, pre
dicts the entire NCAA tournament seeding.
Despite the loss to UCLA in the Pac-10 Finals,
Creme still has Stanford holding at a No. 3
seed in the Bridgeport, Conn., regional. In this
scenario, Stanford would play Sacred Heart, a
member of the Northeastern Conference, and
potentially meet top-seed Duke in the region
al finals. But all this speculation falls on deaf
ears when it comes to the Stanford women
themselves.
"Thinking about it is just wasted energy be
cause we're not in control of our seeding,"
Newlin said. "There's no telling what we can
do because in the game now, no one is head
and-shoulders above the rest. [As an exam
ple], we were as high as a six seed my freshman
year and we made it to the Elite Eight, and
then last year's Elite Eight, so you never know
what can happen."
Based upon their rankings, RPI and
strength of schedule — their out-of-confer
ence schedule included challenges like No. 7
Tennessee and Boston College in Chestnut
Hill — Stanford could be looking realistically
at anywhere between a three and a five seed.
But regardless of how things change in the
next few days, the task is the same.
"For me personally, it's whoever we need to
go through," Gold-Onwude said. "Personally,
I'm now taking each game at a time. When
we're on the floor, all of us are leaders. I don't
sense any anxiousness. I'd follow any of these
girls into battle, and I don't doubt our heart."
