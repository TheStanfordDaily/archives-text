# Pac-10 Connection of the Year: Candice and Tara
## 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES STAFF WRITER 
Just over three years ago, an incoming high
school junior named Candice Wiggins came to
Stanford for a summer basketball camp, shy
and in awe of head coach Tara VanDerveer.
When Wiggins became part of the women's
basketball team, now nearly two years ago,she
still felt the same way.
"I was thinking 'Oh my gosh, I'm at Stan
ford, I'm playing for Tara,"' Wiggins said. "Of
course, over the course of the year we talked
and worked together, but still I'm in awe of
her."
For VanDerveer, the respect is mutual. A
few years and hundreds of games and prac
tices after that summer camp, VanDerveer is
proud to have Wiggins with her.
"She's just a joy to coach," VanDerveer
said. "I treasure every day I get to coach her.
She's a very special player and a very special
person."
This mutual respect is part of an even
stronger relationship that the two have forged
over the past two years. And. in recognition of
that relationship — and their performances
— the duo has won Pac-10 Player and Coach

of the Year Awards, respectively, for the sec
ond year in a row.
Wiggins fully understands why VanDerveer
deserves the award, and said that the reasons
aren't limited to her incredible record.
"She's a coach you want to play hard for,"
Wiggins said. "I find confidence knowing that
our coaching staff is with Tara. I want to go out
every game and work hard for her. and I think
that our team feels the same — she's just that
kind of person".
VanDerveer, however, avoids taking full
credit for being named an eight-time Pac-10
Coach of the Year and three-time NCAA
Coach of the Year.
"You're not going to win a Pac-10 Coach of
the Year award without great players," she
said.
And for VanDerveer, Wiggins, who was
also last year's Pac-10 Freshman of the Year, is
the epitome of a great player. VanDerveer
noted that Wiggins not only contributes to the
stat box (she averages 21.2 points per game),
but leads by example and drives the team with
her spirit and work ethic.
"I think she deserves [the Pac-10 Player of
the Year award] based on a consistent effort."
VanDerveer said. "She gives her best every

game, every practice, and she sets a really high
standard for herself in terms of how hard she
plays. Her competitive desire is unmatched."
That same competitiveness is what Wiggins
believes to be at the core of her relationship
with VanDerveer. The two work tirelessly on
and off the court, before, during and after
games, to put forth the best effort.
"That's why she's such a great coach, be
cause she's so competitive and winning is the
only answer [for her.] I think I share that,"
Wiggins said. "It's fun playing for a coach
that's as competitive as she is, and I think we
feed off of that energy from each other."
Similarly. Wiggins feeds off VanDerveer's
criticism. Given the maturity and leadership
Wiggins already possesses, VanDerveer said
she finds it difficult to help with more than just
the technical work that Wiggins needs, but she
tries to "help [Wiggins] develop the skill set
and the mental and emotional toolbox to not
only to be successful here but at the next
level."
VanDerveer says that Wiggins is always
willing to listen and put what she learns into
effect.
"She's a sophomore still, and she's got a lot
of learning to do and a lot of growing," Van-

Derveer said. "And I feel we have a trusting
relationship where I feel really comfortable
telling her exactly what's on my mind, exactly
what we need from her. I feel like I can be very
forthright and honest."
Wiggins, meanwhile, is thankful for Van-
Derveer's guidance. She considers her a men
tor who teaches something new every day.
"She's the best teacher I've had in basket
ball and life in general," Wiggins said.
With this kind of healthy, productive rela
tionship, VanDerveer and Wiggins also know
what they each expect from one another, and
the Cardinal, in the future. VanDerveer sees
Wiggins becoming an Olympian and WNBA
star.
As for the team, Wiggins says that a nation
al championship is the main goal she shares
with VanDerveer. With two full seasons left,
the two have time to pursue their goal, but
Wiggins sees the value of their relationship
every day.
"I'm trying to learn as much as I can from
Tara — as much about life, about basketball,
about everything," Wiggins said. "And beyond
this, I know we'll have a relationship; I know
we'll stay in touch. It's exciting to have that
kind of connection."

the Year award] based on a consistent effort."
VanDerveer said. "She gives her best every

game, every practice, and she sets a really high
standard for herself in terms of how hard she
plays. Her competitive desire is unmatched."
That same competitiveness is what Wiggins
believes to be at the core of her relationship
with VanDerveer. The two work tirelessly on
and off the court, before, during and after
games, to put forth the best effort.
"That's why she's such a great coach, be
cause she's so competitive and winning is the
only answer [for her.] I think I share that,"
Wiggins said. "It's fun playing for a coach
that's as competitive as she is, and I think we
feed off of that energy from each other."
Similarly. Wiggins feeds off VanDerveer's
criticism. Given the maturity and leadership
Wiggins already possesses, VanDerveer said
she finds it difficult to help with more than just
the technical work that Wiggins needs, but she
tries to "help [Wiggins] develop the skill set
and the mental and emotional toolbox to not
only to be successful here but at the next
level."
VanDerveer says that Wiggins is always
willing to listen and put what she learns into
effect.
"She's a sophomore still, and she's got a lot
of learning to do and a lot of growing," Van-

Derveer said. "And I feel we have a trusting
relationship where I feel really comfortable
telling her exactly what's on my mind, exactly
what we need from her. I feel like I can be very
forthright and honest."
Wiggins, meanwhile, is thankful for Van-
Derveer's guidance. She considers her a men
tor who teaches something new every day.
"She's the best teacher I've had in basket
ball and life in general," Wiggins said.
With this kind of healthy, productive rela
tionship, VanDerveer and Wiggins also know
what they each expect from one another, and
the Cardinal, in the future. VanDerveer sees
Wiggins becoming an Olympian and WNBA
star.
As for the team, Wiggins says that a nation
al championship is the main goal she shares
with VanDerveer. With two full seasons left,
the two have time to pursue their goal, but
Wiggins sees the value of their relationship
every day.
"I'm trying to learn as much as I can from
Tara — as much about life, about basketball,
about everything," Wiggins said. "And beyond
this, I know we'll have a relationship; I know
we'll stay in touch. It's exciting to have that
kind of connection."
