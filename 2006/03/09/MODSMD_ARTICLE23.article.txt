# WOMEN'S DIVING
## Divers hope to make big splash at NCAA quals 
### ALEXIS PETERSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Only one meet stands between the
Stanford women's diving team and the
NCAA Championship competition:
the three-day-long NCAA Zone E
Championships in Oklahoma City,
starting today.There, the Cardinal must
fight to secure spots for as many divers
as possible at the upcoming NCAAs.
"Qualifying divers for NCAAs is re
ally the main purpose of this weekend,"
head coach Rick Schavone said."Natu
rally, I would also like to see all the
divers dive well. But since they all have
a chance to qualify, that is our primary
focus."
Schools from five different confer
ences, including the Pac-10. will make
the tick to Oklahoma City, chasing the
]] remaining individual NCAA quali
fying spots. The competition, which
promises to be intense, will offer only a
glimpse of the pressure these athletes
will face at NCAAs.
"Because more schools are coming
into play, the competition will be a little

more difficult than the competition we
saw at Pac-10s," freshman Sarah Ohr
said. "This is definitely a more challeng
ing meet, and we will all be putting a lot
of pressure on ourselves to qualify for
NCAAs."
Unlike earlier competitions during
the dual meet season, the zone champi
onships focus far less on the team as a
whole, stressing instead personal
achievement.
"At this point, we really do not dive
as a team." Schavone said. "It becomes
very individual, and each diver has her
own strengths and weaknesses."
Four divers from Stanford will be in
the hunt for NCAA spots, including
three-time All-American junior Cas
sidy Krug.
"Cassidy is considered one of the
top divers in the country, so she really
just has to stay consistent and she
should qualify," Schavone said.
Krug placed second in both the one
meter and three-meter diving events at
the 2(X)6 Pac-10 Championships in Fed

Stanford divers hope to use this weekend's Zone E Championships
to qualify for NCAAs. Divers from five different conferences will be
vying for the 11 remaining individual NCAA Championship spots.
eral Way, Wash., two weeks ago.
Sophomore Katie Lampe is also
expected to perform well, having
earned fifth in the three-meter and
placing into the top 10 in both one
meter and platform at Pac-lOs.
"Lampe has a strong chance on
both three meter and platform."
Schavone said. "She is relatively con
sistent. She can handle her dives and
is coming off a good showing — her
best ever — at the Pac-lOs."
Senior Sarah Bowling and Ohr
round out the Cardinal roster.
"Bowling has great entries and
can handle her dives, so this would
be a great way to finish up,"
Schavone said. "Ohr has a good shot
on three-meter. But [with her] being
a freshman, my main for her is

to being some of the new mechanics
she has been learning into the meet."
Still. Schavone expressed modest
expectations for the Cardinal.
"I would like to qualify at least
two women," he said. "We've trained
exceptionally hard this year — much
more so than in the past. 1 am hoping
to see each diver change the level of
her performance. Of course. I will be
satisfied with simply qualifying."
Ohr. excited to see what her first
Zone Championship will bring, has
trust in the hard work she and her
teammates have put into this season.
"All our training from the year is
definitely coming together right
now," Ohr said. "We all have the abil
ity to qualify; we just have to do our
best. It is definitely doable — we just
have to see how well we perform
under pressure."
That pressure will reach a season
high at the 2006 Women's Swimming
and Diving NCAA Championships,
held March 23-25 in Atlanta.
