## Teams look to pull through at spring season opener 
### JOHN CHOCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's open and
lightweight teams take their long
awaited first stab at the spring season
on Saturday. With boats from Cana
da to California awaiting the Cardi
nal at the starting line, these early
races will put the Cardinal's winter
workouts to the test.
"We have trained hard this winter
and it is time to show our hard work,"
head open-weight coach Aimee
Baker said. "We face the toughest
race schedule this year that we have
ever put together in an effort to pre
pare us for an NCAA invite."
That berth narrowly eluded the
open-weight team in last year's
spring season, and the team's bid for
a 2(M)6 invitation begins this weekend
against two elite Canadian teams —
University of British Columbia and
Simon Fraser — as well as UC-Santa
Barbara. The races will take place at
the Cardinal's home course at Red
wood Shores, Calif.
"This weekend we are looking for
race plan execution and to get the first
race jitters out," Baker said, noting

that this year's season opener comes
two weeks earlier than usual. "The
Canadian schools that we face always
provide a competitive race for us."
This weekend's race will also
serve as a test run for the highly-an
ticipated Windermere Collegiate
Classic to be held March 25-26 at
Redwood Shores.
"We will see three major powers
in women's rowing — UVA, Ohio
State and Syracuse," Baker said of
the Windermere regatta field. "They
are all teams that go to NCAAs each
year."
The Windermere Collegiate Clas
sic also weighs on the minds of the
women's lightweight team, which be
gins competition this Saturday at the
Sacramento State Invitational in
Rancho Cordova, Calif.
The Stanford lightweights,
coached by A 1 Acosta, are four-time
defending Pacific Coast champions,
and finished fifth in last year's na
tional championships. The Sacra
mento regatta, which does not count
toward any rankings, will give the
lightweight Card an early chance to
gauge their winter progress.
"Our race this Saturday is kind of
a preseason event," Acosta said. "It
serves primarily as an opportunity
for us to work on different elements
of our race plan and to help figure
out what we need to address in the
next two weeks before our season
really gets going."
In the spring season, boats race a
2,000-meter course instead of the
5,000-meter distance contested in
the fall.The shorter race takes about
seven minutes to complete and is
equally demanding of endurance
and speed.
"The intensity level is raised
quite a bit," Acosta said.
A number of new faces will be
rising to that challenge for this year's
lightweight team.
"Our team is young," Acosta
said. "We have some people that are
injured right now, and three of our
top eight athletes studied abroad
this year. We're looking to make big
improvements throughout the sea
son with the ultimate goal of being
at top speed when we defend our Pa
cific Coast Championship."
