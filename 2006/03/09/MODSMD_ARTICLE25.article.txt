# PAC-10 PREVIEW
## 
### 
11 years on the line
Stanford has not missed the
Big Dance since 1994, but will
not make this year's edition
unless they win three games in
three days. The last time the
Card won three in a row? Ver
sus Washington, Oregon and
Oregon State in the midst of
their 8-1 mid-season run, with
Chris Hernandez increasingly
clutch by the game. Will Her
nandez, Haryaszand Grunfeld
have to lead the team, like they
have all season, or will unsung
heroes step up?
