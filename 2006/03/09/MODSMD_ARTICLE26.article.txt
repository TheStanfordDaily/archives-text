## Florida State prof questions self-esteem 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
Contrary to popular belief, high self-esteem
does not necessarily lead to increased productivi
ty or better academic performance, according to
Roy Baumeister. professor of social psychology at
Florida State University, in an article titled "Re
thinking Self-Esteem." Published in The Stanford
Social Innovation Review, his findings created a
stir among nonprofit groups who aim to raise
child self-esteem.
Baumeister conducted a survey and found evi
dence indicating that people with high self-es
teem are not more likely to succeed than people
with low self-esteem. The study followed 1,500
high-school students from l()th-grade and be
yond, showing that self-esteem increased after a
student received good grades and decreased after
the student received bad grades. However, if rea
sons not related to grades caused a student's self
esteem to go up or down, his or her academic
record did not tend to change.
According to the article, studies have shown
that high self-esteem is not necessarily linked with
good first impressions. When pairs of strangers
met, people with high self-esteem were not liked
any more than those with low self-esteem. The
main difference between the two groups was that
some with high self-esteem thought they had
made a good impression when they actually had
not.
Baumeister cited that women have lower self
esteem than men by a small margin. The differ

ence, he said, primarily comes from body image, as
women are more likely to consider themselves
unattractive than men.
The article also posited out that criminals and
drug or alcohol users tend to have higher self-es
teem, contradicting years of theory that links low
self-esteem to these behaviors.
This claim sparked controversy among readers
of The Social Innovation Review, a magazine tar
geted at chairmen and executives of nonprofits.
Alana Connor Snibbe, senior editor of The Re
view, described the conflict.
"There are a lot of nonprofits in the world who
exist to raise the self-esteem of one group or an
other," Snibbe said. "A lot of these programs are
targeted at women, African-Americans or low
performing students. And there's not any evi
dence that's going to help."
The article has had a polarizing effect on The
Review's audience, Snibbe continued.
"I've gotten letters from both sides," she said,
"People just don't believe it. Or they say they've
been waiting 20 years for an article like this be
cause they've known this all along. That's often
what happens in psychology. Whatever finding
you have, half of the people will say they knew it
all along, their grandmother said it: the other half
won't believe it."
Snibbe called the firestorm a "PR Problem"
for the social sciences, since this study contradicts
conventional wisdom in the field.
"Because for many years." she said,"it was psy
chology that was saying it was self-esteem, and
that if you twist this or notch that up, self-esteem

would be better and performance would be bet
ter."
Hazel Markus, a professor of psychology at
Stanford who studies related issues, disagreed
with Baumeister's conclusions.
"I thought it was too harsh and that there are
many ways to look at the evidence," Markus said.
"Most importantly, it depends on your under
standing of self-esteem. Ifyoujust think of self-es
teem as going around and saying, I'm wonderful,
I'm great,' then it's not going to work."
Markus argues that self-esteem is not an isolat
ed feeling; it only comes from accomplishments
and relationships with others.
"Perhaps there are some people out there who
have a good attitude from nothing," she said. "But
that's hard to maintain. The only real way to get
good self-esteem is by doing well in the world and
getting the regard of others. It's virtually impossi
ble to just have high self-esteem if there is no basis
for it."
According to Markus, with a solid foundation
of self-esteem, one will be more able to have a
positive outlook, and that will be the cause of
good outcomes. She said she finds Baumeister's
view too narrow, as it only takes into account the
kind of self-esteem that is felt but not earned.
But Markus agreed that this sort of self-esteem
has no beneficial effects and ought to be discred
ited.
"You can't just tell kids to look in the mirror
every morning and say I'm beautiful and expect to
do something," she said. "You just end up with a
bunch of conceited people."
