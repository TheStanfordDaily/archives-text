GSB prof, sworn in by Bush
On Feb. 6, President George W.
Bush swore in Graduate School of
Business Prof. Edward Lazear as
Chairman of the Council of Econom
ic Advisors. Replacing Ben Bernanke,
who recently assumed the chair of the
Federal Reserve, formerly held by
Alan Greenspan, Lazear received
Senate approval to head the three
person advisory council on Feb. 17.
In the swearing-in ceremony, the
president highlighted Lazear's ca
reer achievements, including the
teacher of the year award he earned
at the GSB.
"That's not an easy accomplish
ment," he said.
Bush also used the ceremony as a
springboard to propose new legisla
tion granting the executive line-item
veto powers. The controversial rule,
held by governors in all but seven
states yet deemed unconstitutional
by the Supreme Court in 1996. would
allow the president to veto individual
parts of a bill instead of the entirety.

oppression of women and the de
