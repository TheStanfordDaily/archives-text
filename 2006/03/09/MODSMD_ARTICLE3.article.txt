# SPORTS ANALYSIS
## Goods must live up to name 
### SEAN HOWELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It was hard to find bright spots in the men's
basketball team's 75-54 loss to UCLA last Sat
urday, their worst at Maples Pavilion since
1993.
But there, in the middle of the box score,
stood freshman guard Anthony Goods' line: 4-
of-4 from the field, including 3-of-3 from be
yond the arc, for a season-high 12 points.
Stanford has been desperate for a fourth
scoring option this entire season. Outside of the
three senior starters — forward Matt Haryasz,

and guards Chris Hernandez and Dan Grun
feld — no one on the team averages more than
five points per game.
As a result, opponents have started to dou
ble Haryasz and key on Hernandez, significant
ly slowing the duo's scoring, all while essential
ly ignoring the other two guys on the floor.
Even so, players outside the "Big Three" have
led the team in scoring only twice, further en
couraging opponents to cheat on Haryasz and
Hernandez, Stanford's two First Team All-Pac
-10 performers.
Enter Goods. Since seeing in
creased playing time in the last two
weekends, he has started to alleviate
the scoring pressure on Stanford's
primary scorers, chipping in 7.5
points per game and averaging 20.8
minutes — well over his respective
season averages of 2.3 and 8.5.
His recent spurt has come after he
played only 32 total minutes during
the previous 10 games — barely
more than the 30 that he played in
one contest against UCLA, the first
start of his career.
Suffice it so say then that Goods
has seen firsthand how rocky a col
lege basketball player's season can
be. He has grown simply by learning
how to take a breather and just watch
for awhile, taking mental notes on
the play of his teammates and hitting
the gym on his off-days.
"His confidence has gotten a lot
better since the first time around."
Coach Trent Johnson said, referring
to the significant minutes that Goods
logged early in the Pac-10 confer
ence schedule, before his playing
time dwindled.
In the intervening period. Goods
worked on his jump shot. He also de
veloped a more complete offensive
game with a little bit of help from

Grunfeld. one of the most canny
players on the team.
"Dan has walked me through
some things in practice," Goods said.
"He talks to me when I'm guarding
him, and when he's guarding me. I've
learned a lot of different things about
how he comes off screens, how he
gets other people the ball and how he
makes people better."
Grunfeld has taught Goods how
to pick his spots on offense, a skill at
which Grunfeld thrives. Combined
with the extra attention that the
team's primary scorers have re
ceived. Goods said that he has seen
more open shots recently. And he has
been able to knock them down — he
is shooting 55 percent from the field
and 54 percent from three-point
range in the last four games, after hit
ting just 20 percent of his field goals
before that point.
"I think my understanding of the
offense has improved a lot," Goods
said. "When I got here. I was going
100 miles per hour, trying to do
everything I could. Now, I've slowed
down. I have a better feel for what
everybody else is going to do, just
from playing with them."
Goods' offense has improved, but
according to Johnson, it was his de

fense that earned him his first career
start on Saturday, because he
matched up well defensively with
UCLA. Goods was charged with
chasing around UCLA sophomore
guard Aaron Afflalo. the Bruins'
leading scorer, for much of the game.
The assignment would he a chore for
many, but Goods actually looked for
ward to the task.
"My high school team was not
very good. I never got into really big
games." Goods said of playing at
Centennial High in Corona.Calif."So
1 get really excited to guard guys like
Afflalo, [Arizona's] Hassan Adams
or [Washington's] Brandon Roy."
The fact that Goods sounds excit
ed when he talks about defense must
be music to Johnson's ears. Goods
said that he was "inspired" when he
watched Chris Rogers, Arizona's
tenacious defender, guard Stanford
players during the Wildcats' win at
Maples last month. He talked about
the importance of applying defen
sive pressure and crashing the
boards in the Cardinal's opening
round game against the Wildcats in
the Pac-10Tournament on Thursday.
Goods makes college basketball
sound easy. Defend hard, knock
down open shots and come away with

a win. Actually doing these things is,
of course, much easier said than done
— otherwise, the team would have
found another reliable scoring option
by now. But Goods has managed to
find his niche in the offense over the
last few games, taking the opportuni
ties to shoot when he finds them.
There is no better example of this
development than his game-winner
against Washington State two week
ends ago. when he ran to the hoop to
tip in Hernandez's missed jumper
with 3.7 seconds left, allowing the
Cardinal to escape Pullman with a
39-37 win.
"I knew Chris was going to take
the shot [coming out of a timeout]."
Goods said. "I was just waiting, and I
decided that 1 was going to run in as
hard as I could when the shot went
up."
Goods might not get to start this
afternoon's game — the decision
will again depend on how Johnson
feels about the defensive matchup,
and who plays in Hassan Adams'
place for Arizona — but he should
see significant minutes. And if he can
again provide some offensive punch
and defensive spark, the Cardinal
just might be able to keep up with the
athletic Wildcats.

points per game and averaging 20.8
minutes — well over his respective
season averages of 2.3 and 8.5.
His recent spurt has come after he
played only 32 total minutes during
the previous 10 games — barely
more than the 30 that he played in
one contest against UCLA, the first
start of his career.
Suffice it so say then that Goods
has seen firsthand how rocky a col
lege basketball player's season can
be. He has grown simply by learning
how to take a breather and just watch
for awhile, taking mental notes on
the play of his teammates and hitting
the gym on his off-days.
"His confidence has gotten a lot
better since the first time around."
Coach Trent Johnson said, referring
to the significant minutes that Goods
logged early in the Pac-10 confer
ence schedule, before his playing
time dwindled.
In the intervening period. Goods
worked on his jump shot. He also de
veloped a more complete offensive
game with a little bit of help from

Grunfeld. one of the most canny
players on the team.
"Dan has walked me through
some things in practice," Goods said.
"He talks to me when I'm guarding
him, and when he's guarding me. I've
learned a lot of different things about
how he comes off screens, how he
gets other people the ball and how he
makes people better."
Grunfeld has taught Goods how
to pick his spots on offense, a skill at
which Grunfeld thrives. Combined
with the extra attention that the
team's primary scorers have re
ceived. Goods said that he has seen
more open shots recently. And he has
been able to knock them down — he
is shooting 55 percent from the field
and 54 percent from three-point
range in the last four games, after hit
ting just 20 percent of his field goals
before that point.
"I think my understanding of the
offense has improved a lot," Goods
said. "When I got here. I was going
100 miles per hour, trying to do
everything I could. Now, I've slowed
down. I have a better feel for what
everybody else is going to do, just
from playing with them."
Goods' offense has improved, but
according to Johnson, it was his de

fense that earned him his first career
start on Saturday, because he
matched up well defensively with
UCLA. Goods was charged with
chasing around UCLA sophomore
guard Aaron Afflalo. the Bruins'
leading scorer, for much of the game.
The assignment would he a chore for
many, but Goods actually looked for
ward to the task.
"My high school team was not
very good. I never got into really big
games." Goods said of playing at
Centennial High in Corona.Calif."So
1 get really excited to guard guys like
Afflalo, [Arizona's] Hassan Adams
or [Washington's] Brandon Roy."
The fact that Goods sounds excit
ed when he talks about defense must
be music to Johnson's ears. Goods
said that he was "inspired" when he
watched Chris Rogers, Arizona's
tenacious defender, guard Stanford
players during the Wildcats' win at
Maples last month. He talked about
the importance of applying defen
sive pressure and crashing the
boards in the Cardinal's opening
round game against the Wildcats in
the Pac-10Tournament on Thursday.
Goods makes college basketball
sound easy. Defend hard, knock
down open shots and come away with

a win. Actually doing these things is,
of course, much easier said than done
— otherwise, the team would have
found another reliable scoring option
by now. But Goods has managed to
find his niche in the offense over the
last few games, taking the opportuni
ties to shoot when he finds them.
There is no better example of this
development than his game-winner
against Washington State two week
ends ago. when he ran to the hoop to
tip in Hernandez's missed jumper
with 3.7 seconds left, allowing the
Cardinal to escape Pullman with a
39-37 win.
"I knew Chris was going to take
the shot [coming out of a timeout]."
Goods said. "I was just waiting, and I
decided that 1 was going to run in as
hard as I could when the shot went
up."
Goods might not get to start this
afternoon's game — the decision
will again depend on how Johnson
feels about the defensive matchup,
and who plays in Hassan Adams'
place for Arizona — but he should
see significant minutes. And if he can
again provide some offensive punch
and defensive spark, the Cardinal
just might be able to keep up with the
athletic Wildcats.

Along with freshman guard Anthony Goods, senior guard Dan Grunfeld
(above) must take the scoring load of Hernandez's and Haryasz's shoulders.
It was hard to find bright spots in the men's
basketball team's 75-54 loss to UCLA last Sat
urday, their worst at Maples Pavilion since
1993.
But there, in the middle of the box score,
stood freshman guard Anthony Goods' line: 4-
of-4 from the field, including 3-of-3 from be
yond the arc, for a season-high 12 points.
Stanford has been desperate for a fourth
scoring option this entire season. Outside of the
three senior starters — forward Matt Haryasz,

and guards Chris Hernandez and Dan Grun
feld — no one on the team averages more than
five points per game.
As a result, opponents have started to dou
ble Haryasz and key on Hernandez, significant
ly slowing the duo's scoring, all while essential
ly ignoring the other two guys on the floor.
Even so, players outside the "Big Three" have
led the team in scoring only twice, further en
couraging opponents to cheat on Haryasz and
Hernandez, Stanford's two First Team All-Pac
-10 performers.
Enter Goods. Since seeing in
creased playing time in the last two
weekends, he has started to alleviate
the scoring pressure on Stanford's
primary scorers, chipping in 7.5
points per game and averaging 20.8
minutes — well over his respective
season averages of 2.3 and 8.5.
His recent spurt has come after he
played only 32 total minutes during
