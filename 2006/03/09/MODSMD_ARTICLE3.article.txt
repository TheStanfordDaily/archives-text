## Goods must live up to name

It was hard to find bright spots in the men's
basketball team's 75-54 loss to UCLA last Sat
urday, their worst at Maples Pavilion since
1993.
But there, in the middle of the box score,
stood freshman guard Anthony Goods' line: 4-
of-4 from the field, including 3-of-3 from be
yond the arc, for a season-high 12 points.
Stanford has been desperate for a fourth
scoring option this entire season. Outside of the
three senior starters — forward Matt Haryasz,

and guards Chris Hernandez and Dan Grun
feld — no one on the team averages more than
five points per game.
As a result, opponents have started to dou
ble Haryasz and key on Hernandez, significant
ly slowing the duo's scoring, all while essential
ly ignoring the other two guys on the floor.
Even so, players outside the "Big Three" have
led the team in scoring only twice, further en
couraging opponents to cheat on Haryasz and
Hernandez, Stanford's two First Team All-Pac
-10 performers.
