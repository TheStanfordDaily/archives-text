# Lack of fees would spell cuts
## Flicks, Six Degrees among those that would suffer 
### JAMES HOHMANN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Eleven student groups may be in dire straits if they do not secure the minimum number
of signatures required to place their special-fee funding requests on the April ASSU elec
tions ballot.These groups are now mobilizing to raise awareness of possible consequences if
they do not reach the minimum signature count by the March 17 deadline.
Some groups say their very survival depends on whether they get special fees support in
the April 12 and 13 elections. Others say special fees funding is crucial for their organizations
to offer improved services, expand or travel.
Groups requesting special fees for the first time; asking for increased support of more
than 10 percent; or requesting more than was approved by the ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate and Graduate Student Council (GSC) must petition.
Six Degrees: A Journal on Human Rights members said they do not think they can pub
lish next year if the publication does not get special-fees funding.The magazine has received
temporary' funding from the ASSU Publications Board, but needs more money to continue
printing. Last year, the group came up only a handful of signatures short, and leaders say it
would be a "huge blow" if they do not get the funding.
"There's a chance we might not be able to publish our issues." said the magazine's Finan
cial Manager Shila Soni, a junior.

The Alternative Spring Break (ASB) program would
only he able to offer financial aid to students severely in
need.

"ASB is requesting a budget increase in order to offer
students more travel trips and. more importantly,financial aid to
more in-need participants "said ASB Financial Manager Allison
Paige Dencker, a senior. "Participants who are accepted into the
ASB service-learning trips are frequently prevented from par-

ticipating because they cannot afford the airfare or par
■ ticipant fee, and the ASB program has only enough
I funding to assist participants designated by the Office
of Financial Aid as very high-need. If ASB does not
get the new funding approved, the program will be
able to offer fewer trips and less aid to participants."
Flicks would be discontinued unless it found
another source of funding.
"Flicks is an organization that has always been

dependent upon the support of the
Stanford population," said Flicks Fi
nancial Manager Shannon Enox.
"Without their continued support
through the petitioning and general
elections process. Flicks will not be
able to continue beyond this year."
The Stanford Daily, already hob
bled by declining revenues and an un
favorable national advertising mar
ket, would struggle to cover printing
costs and could lose money next years
with the special fees infusion.
"Unlike some groups out there,
Ilie Daily obviously would not im
mediately close shop if it did not get
the special fee for a given year, but
the lack of a fee would seriously im
pact our product and our ability to
reinvest in the organization for the
long-term," said Brendan Marten,
The Daily's chief operating officer.
Mock Trial would have to increase
dues and send fewer competitors to

high profile tournaments.
"If we do not receive special fees,
we will probably have to cut down on
the number of teams we have next
year," said Financial Manager Diane
Cheng, a sophomore."This would be
extremely unfortunate because we
always have a great number of quali
fied applicants during try-outs, and it
would be disappointing to deny them
an opportunity to participate in colle
giate mock trial."
Funding for Student Initiated
Courses (SIC) comes exclusively
from the ASSU.The group, which al
lows students to design their own
classes, would be forced to reduce its
offerings without special fees.
"We have increased our budget by
over 10 percent because we are con
tinuing to get more course applica
tions than we had previously expect
ed," said SIC Financial Manager
Jenna Boiler, a senior. "We tried to be
modest with our budget increase, and
we are hoping that our budget for
next year will continue to accommo
date more student-initiated courses."
I"he Muslim Student Awareness
Network (MSAN) and Movimiento

Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan
(MKChA) would have to pare down
outreach activities and bring in fewer
quality speakers.
"If the group does not receive the
online petitions, it will be extremely
difficult to hold the Raza Day Youth
Conference, as other sources of
funding are already stretched to the
limit for the event." said sophomore
Bernard Fraga, MEChAs financial
manager. "The Raza Day Youth
Conference is an opportunity for all
Stanford students to perform com
munity service for area youth
through workshops on college ad
missions, cultural awareness, finan
cial aid and academic skills improve
ment."
The NAACP Stanford chapter
could not bring in a prominent civil
rights activist to speak if it does not
secure their requested fees.
"If we do not make it on the ballot
for special fees, the Stanford commu
nity will lose out on hearing the hon
orable Julian Bond, a long-time civil
rights activist who worked very close
ly with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.. as
well as some other great speakers

and programs," said junior Kiah
Williams, president of the Stanford
NAACP chapter.
Stanford Concert Network repre
sentatives said they could not put on
as many concerts without the support
of special fees.
"The Stanford Concert Network
is a business," said Financial Manager
Rene Spellman, a junior. "The con
tent we buy is very expensive."
Club Sports also relies heavily on
special-fees funding, but a spokes
woman said she is confident the
group will get the requisite support to
appear on the April ballot.
One ASSU member said the peti
tion system is an important barome
ter of student opinion on these
groups and activities.
"The whole point of the petition
process is to find out which groups
have so much interest in them that
they should have the privilege of tax
ing all Stanford students for what
they do," said GSC Funding Commit
tee Chair Adam Beberg, a graduate
student in computer science. "If they
don't, there are many other sources
of funding to look at."

able to continue beyond this year."
The Stanford Daily, already hob
bled by declining revenues and an un
favorable national advertising mar
ket, would struggle to cover printing
costs and could lose money next years
with the special fees infusion.
"Unlike some groups out there,
Ilie Daily obviously would not im
mediately close shop if it did not get
the special fee for a given year, but
the lack of a fee would seriously im
pact our product and our ability to
reinvest in the organization for the
long-term," said Brendan Marten,
The Daily's chief operating officer.
Mock Trial would have to increase
dues and send fewer competitors to

high profile tournaments.
"If we do not receive special fees,
we will probably have to cut down on
the number of teams we have next
year," said Financial Manager Diane
Cheng, a sophomore."This would be
extremely unfortunate because we
always have a great number of quali
fied applicants during try-outs, and it
would be disappointing to deny them
an opportunity to participate in colle
giate mock trial."
Funding for Student Initiated
Courses (SIC) comes exclusively
from the ASSU.The group, which al
lows students to design their own
classes, would be forced to reduce its
offerings without special fees.
"We have increased our budget by
over 10 percent because we are con
tinuing to get more course applica
tions than we had previously expect
ed," said SIC Financial Manager
Jenna Boiler, a senior. "We tried to be
modest with our budget increase, and
we are hoping that our budget for
next year will continue to accommo
date more student-initiated courses."
I"he Muslim Student Awareness
Network (MSAN) and Movimiento

Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan
(MKChA) would have to pare down
outreach activities and bring in fewer
quality speakers.
"If the group does not receive the
online petitions, it will be extremely
difficult to hold the Raza Day Youth
Conference, as other sources of
funding are already stretched to the
limit for the event." said sophomore
Bernard Fraga, MEChAs financial
manager. "The Raza Day Youth
Conference is an opportunity for all
Stanford students to perform com
munity service for area youth
through workshops on college ad
missions, cultural awareness, finan
cial aid and academic skills improve
ment."
The NAACP Stanford chapter
could not bring in a prominent civil
rights activist to speak if it does not
secure their requested fees.
"If we do not make it on the ballot
for special fees, the Stanford commu
nity will lose out on hearing the hon
orable Julian Bond, a long-time civil
rights activist who worked very close
ly with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.. as
well as some other great speakers

and programs," said junior Kiah
Williams, president of the Stanford
NAACP chapter.
Stanford Concert Network repre
sentatives said they could not put on
as many concerts without the support
of special fees.
"The Stanford Concert Network
is a business," said Financial Manager
Rene Spellman, a junior. "The con
tent we buy is very expensive."
Club Sports also relies heavily on
special-fees funding, but a spokes
woman said she is confident the
group will get the requisite support to
appear on the April ballot.
One ASSU member said the peti
tion system is an important barome
ter of student opinion on these
groups and activities.
"The whole point of the petition
process is to find out which groups
have so much interest in them that
they should have the privilege of tax
ing all Stanford students for what
they do," said GSC Funding Commit
tee Chair Adam Beberg, a graduate
student in computer science. "If they
don't, there are many other sources
of funding to look at."
Eleven student groups may be in dire straits if they do not secure the minimum number
of signatures required to place their special-fee funding requests on the April ASSU elec
tions ballot.These groups are now mobilizing to raise awareness of possible consequences if
they do not reach the minimum signature count by the March 17 deadline.
Some groups say their very survival depends on whether they get special fees support in
the April 12 and 13 elections. Others say special fees funding is crucial for their organizations
to offer improved services, expand or travel.
Groups requesting special fees for the first time; asking for increased support of more
than 10 percent; or requesting more than was approved by the ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate and Graduate Student Council (GSC) must petition.
Six Degrees: A Journal on Human Rights members said they do not think they can pub
lish next year if the publication does not get special-fees funding.The magazine has received
temporary' funding from the ASSU Publications Board, but needs more money to continue
printing. Last year, the group came up only a handful of signatures short, and leaders say it
would be a "huge blow" if they do not get the funding.
"There's a chance we might not be able to publish our issues." said the magazine's Finan
cial Manager Shila Soni, a junior.

The Alternative Spring Break (ASB) program would
only he able to offer financial aid to students severely in
need.

"ASB is requesting a budget increase in order to offer
students more travel trips and. more importantly,financial aid to
more in-need participants "said ASB Financial Manager Allison
Paige Dencker, a senior. "Participants who are accepted into the
ASB service-learning trips are frequently prevented from par-

ticipating because they cannot afford the airfare or par
■ ticipant fee, and the ASB program has only enough
I funding to assist participants designated by the Office
of Financial Aid as very high-need. If ASB does not
get the new funding approved, the program will be
able to offer fewer trips and less aid to participants."
Flicks would be discontinued unless it found
another source of funding.
"Flicks is an organization that has always been

dependent upon the support of the
Stanford population," said Flicks Fi
nancial Manager Shannon Enox.
"Without their continued support
through the petitioning and general
elections process. Flicks will not be
able to continue beyond this year."
