## Senior events in jeopardy Class presidents warn seniors to curb drinking at events 
### COURTNEY WEAVER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On March 2, seniors across campus
found a stern email from their class presi

"Over the past few months," the email
began, "there have been a number of inci

pre-partying," and asking that no personal
alcohol be brought to events. They also said
that students who vomit on Marguerites or
chartered buses will now have to pay the
$S(X) clean-up fee and that "students who
are reported for misconduct (belligerent
behavior and serious alcohol misuse) will
be referred to the University for appropri

events."
Some seniors explained that these prob

rules and limitations at certain events.

sports editor at The Daily, the e-mail's mes
