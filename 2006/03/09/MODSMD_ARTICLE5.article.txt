## Senior events in jeopardy Class presidents warn seniors to curb drinking at events 
### COURTNEY WEAVER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On March 2, seniors across campus
found a stern email from their class presi
dents in their inboxes.
"Over the past few months," the email
began, "there have been a number of inci
dents of misconduct reported at senior
events."
Highlighting incidents ranging from
"disruptive behavior, to vomiting, to prop
erty damage and theft," the message stated
that such occurrences jeopardize the class's
"ability to hold future Senior Nights and the
San Francisco Senior Nights."
In a joint email to The Daily, the Senior
Class Presidents Kevin Gao, Pamela Kum,
James Mitchell and Shyani Ravindran, ex
plained the reasoning behind the statement.
"With any events we hold where alcohol
is served, there occasionally are incidents of

overdrinking or rowdy behavior," they said.
"Our weekly Senior Nights are our primary
events with access to alcohol, and that's
where the majority of incidents occur."
In their email, the presidents outlined
their expectations, discouraging "excessive
pre-partying," and asking that no personal
alcohol be brought to events. They also said
that students who vomit on Marguerites or
chartered buses will now have to pay the
$S(X) clean-up fee and that "students who
are reported for misconduct (belligerent
behavior and serious alcohol misuse) will
be referred to the University for appropri
ate action and may lead to barring the indi
viduals) involved from future senior
events."
Some seniors explained that these prob
lems were a result of past behavior or strict
rules and limitations at certain events.
According to senior Whitney Sado. a
sports editor at The Daily, the e-mail's mes
sage is a far cry from the "student-friendly"
attitude of Stanford security earlier this
year. She noted an incident during which
these-

curity
guards let a "clearly intoxicated"
senior onto the Marguerite, "merely
reminding him not to bring his drink
on the bus and to act as sober as pos
sible once at [Pub Night],
"I think seniors quickly realized
that the rules weren't being strictly
enforced and that they could get way
with small things — bringing alcohol
onto Marguerites for example —
and then it just kind of snowballed,"
she said.
Senior David Louk blamed the
locations at which some of the
events were held for the problems
that the class presidents addressed

in their e-mail.
"I think the issue is that closed
events with high drink prices, many
students feel the need to do all their
drinking beforehand," he said.
"Some people don't want to pay $8
or $9 for drinks, so they end up
grotesquely drunk on the Mar
guerites."
The presidents said that the re
cent number of alcohol-related inci
dents did not appear to represent an
increase from previous years or with
in this year alone.
"These types of issues occur every
year, and it's difficult to judge
whether there's a qualitative differ
ence between this year and previous
ones," the presidents told The Daily.
"It's difficult to say whether there's
been a trend or not through the year;
there have been points where we've

advertised less in regards to our alco
hol policies and warnings to the class
in general."
The email also alluded to "recent
problems at our Semi-Formal." and
sources tell The Daily that a number
of students were caught breaking
into stores of alcohol at the event.
However, the presidents said that
"no particular incident prompted the
class e-mail."
"There have been a few incidents
recently to where we felt it necessary
to reinforce our policies and think of
ways to continue improving upon
our operation of Senior Nights and
class events in general and ensure
that our future events would take
place without incident," they said.
The presidents' email was drafted
"in coordination and contact with"
the Senior Cabinet and administra

tors at such as the Office of Student
Affairs and Vaden Health Center.
In his discussions with the presi
dents, Ralph Castro, manager of the
Substance Abuse Prevention Pro
gram at Vaden, said they discussed
how to avoid problems at future
events, and added, "There have
been a number of problems associ
ated with the Senior Nights where
students have [had] too much alco
hol."
Castro worked with the presi
dents to phrase the language of their
message and the expectations that
they wanted to give to the seniors
who attend these events.
According to Castro, he and the
presidents approached the situation
by "looking at the line between what
the University's expectations are
and the students' expectations are

and trying to find some middle
ground."
"We're trying our best to preserve
Senior Nights and our general privi
lege to serve alcohol at class events,
and we think the [seniors] under
stand that we're working hard to do
that," the presidents said.
Castro agreed, also noting that
the trouble is coming from only a
small portion of seniors.
"The senior class presidents have
been doing a really good job of fol
low-up and just being proactive," he
said. "The vast majority of students
are making good decisions. Every
one really needs to be aware and
look out for each other, because the
fun of one can jeopardize these
events happening in the future."
Senior Corie Geballe agreed that
students are ultimately responsible

for their actions and should know
how to behave at events.
"By this point, seniors should
know their tolerance level," she said.
"It's kind of ridiculous that people
are throwing up on the Marguerites."
The presidents noted that they
had "generally heard positive or neu
tral comments regarding the email."
Sado agreed that the presidents
are doing a good job of communicat
ing with their class.
"As far as the senior class presi
dents go, I think they're doing really
well with the senior events." she
said. "It seems like a pretty thank
less job where people are quick to
criticize. [The presidents] get securi
ty, send out repeated warnings to
the seniors about proper Pub Night
behavior and should just be able to
trust us."
