## GSC discusses fees, election 
### CAITLIN BERKA 
With the approach of the April ASSU
elections, ballot and voting measures were
the primary topics of discussion at last nights
meeting of the Graduate Student Council
(GSC), in addition to several bills.
Members were reminded that the upcom
ing elections will be publicized at this Sun
day's Flicks.
The first order of business was a vote on a
proposed change to a joint bylaw.
Originally, the bylaw had mandated that
all elections campaign policy meetings must
be "publicized by at least two display adver
tisements in The Stanford Daily." The old
document also required "at least one well

advertised informational session during win
ter quarter."
TTie bill discussed last night proposed that
the elections campaign policy meetings not
require publication, and that the two manda
tory ads in The Daily should instead an
nounce the informational sessions. The bill
passed 11-0 with one abstention.
Soon thereafter, GSC members discussed
voting outreach programs, noting that gradu
ate students rarely vote, and those who do
are not always aware of what they are voting
for.
Strategies to combat this widespread apa
thy include plans for a massive flyering cam-

paign, quarterly newsletters and a
voters guide outlining the pros and
cons of various special fees and bal
lot initiatives.
A bill that proposed removing en
dorsements from the elections ballot
was the source of heated debate later
in the meeting. The Undergraduate
Senate and GSC both passed the
measure two weeks ago, but some
undergraduate senators expressed
concern that the vote was not publi
cized far enough in advance â€” the
Constitution mandates that informa
tion regarding the agenda must be

made available at least 72 hours in
advance.
An op-ed piece recently pub
lished in The Daily cited "classes,
midterms and irreconcilable con
flicts" as factors that prevented many
senators from attending the vote on
such short notice. A delegate from
the Senate also attended tonight's
GSC meeting to voice such concerns.
While most members agreed that
the Senate had not followed correct
procedure, there was some dissent
over whether the bill should be re
opened. Some members pointed out
that the 72-hour requirement is
often not followed and that subject
ing this particular bill to a re-vote
would force the ASSU to reconsider
a multitude of other bills.
In addition, GSC Co-chair Tom

Lee, a fourth-year doctoral candi
date in electrical engineering, ex
pressed concern over the move to re
consider.
"I was disappointed in the choice
of the term 'underhanded' to de
scribe this," he said. "I try to run a
clean vote."
The move to reconsider the re
moval of endorsements from the
elections ballot ultimately failed in a
6-5 vote. There was one abstention.
Also at the meeting, Hannah
Scherer, graduate student in geolog
ical and environmental sciences and
chair of the Parking and Transporta
tion Committee, proposed a Gradu
ate Student Transportation Board.
Ilie board would tackle research on
the role of transportation in grad
student life, help grad students be

come more connected to the com
munity at large and put forth an ef
fort to lower transportation costs
and reduce environmental effects.
The bill was tabled until next
week to allow GSC members a
chance to reflect on the issues at
hand. Scherer also detailed the
budget for the Graduate Trans
portation General Fee, which totals
$422,750. This sum includes Caltrain
GO Passes for each off-campus stu
dent as well as on-campus trans
portation programs, such as a rental
car service and an airport shuttle
charter. This bill was also tabled
until next week.
The GSC also heard from Ryan
MacFarlane, the graduate represen
tative on the Faculty Senate Com
mittee for Graduate Studies.
