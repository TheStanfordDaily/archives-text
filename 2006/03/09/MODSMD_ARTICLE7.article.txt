## Facebook opens to highschoolers 
### ANDREW BURMON STAFF WRITER 
Too many numbers can be confusing, but here's one sta
tistic that should make everyone blink: Facebook.com now
has over eight million registered users. That's roughly equal
to the combined populations of Los Angeles and Chicago.
The popular college networking Web site, which spread
to Stanford in February 2(X)4. has grown astronomically in
its first two years and now sits as the seventh most-visited
page on the Internet.
Recently, Facebook.com administrators
made the decision to allow members of the high
school version of its site to be friends with their
college counterparts. While the high school ver
sion has existed since late 2005. there had not
been a link between that site and the broader
college community.
Chris Hughes, a spokesperson for Face
book.com explained that the decision was
made because of the similarities between col
lege and high school students.
"High schools and colleges, even though
they're very different in a lot of ways, are ulti
mately built on the same concept: an education
al institution around which students assemble
their everyday lives," he said.
Despite Hughes' insistence that high school
and college students share certain experiences,
some college students reacted negatively to the
sudden change.
"I hate it," said sophomore Joel Lewenstein.
"I left Ithaca for a reason."
Conversely, many high school students were
enthusiastic about the change.
"It's an awesome way to keep in touch with
people I don't go to school with or just don't get
to see very often," said Whitney Roller, a senior
at Agnes Irwin School in Philadelphia.
While the new link between high schools
and colleges may be controversial.
Facebook.com has enjoyed astounding success
on the whole.
The networking site has expanded to every
college and university in the United States, as
well as into 14 other countries.
Hughes also pointed out the popularity of
Facebook.com among individual students.
"Our users are spending an average of 18

minutes per day on the site," he said. "Also, ac
cording to our statistics, 67 percent of our users
log in each day, and we get about 300 million
page views in any given 24-hour period."
Despite the success of Facebook.com and
other similar social networking sites, there is
concern that these pages will facilitate the
spread of Internet vandalism or undesirable
content. For this reason, Facebook.com offers
its users the ability to complain about offensive
advertisements or other content.
Hughes said the site does what it can to
avoid controversy.
"[Questionable behavior] is less likely on
Facebook.com than it is on other sites because
we have a one-to-one ratio between the num
ber of users and 'real' people because of the re
quirement that our users have .edu email ad
dresses," he said.
While networking sites like Facebook.com
or MySpace.com have prompted concerns
about privacy, a recently released study by the
Pew Internet and Family Life Foundation sup
ports the notion that Facebook.com does serve
as a valuable networking tool, proving that,
"people who use online communication are
quite social and tend to meet with and call peo
ple more often than nonusers."
Though the Facebook.com team — which
now consists of 100 employees — refuses to
speak about any further developments, it is
clear that the site and the new wave of commu
nication networks it represents is here to stay.
"It's a really great way to connect to peo
ple," said Ani Kardashian, a sophomore. "It al
lows you to share your photos and albums with
your friends and stay in touch with people you
don't get to see that often."
