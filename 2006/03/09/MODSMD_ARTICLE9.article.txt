## Proposed trails awaiting approval Santa Clara okays trails, San Mateo still to decide 
### LAURA CARWILE STAFF WRITER 
In the ever-constant effort to beautify
the campus, Stanford has proposed a plan
to build two connecting recreational
trails in nearby counties.
One trail is proposed near Page Mill
Road in Santa Clara Country; the other,
built along Alpine Road, would be in San
Mateo County.
As it stands, the two counties are in
different stages of the approval process.
Santa Clara County approved the
plan by a 4-1 vote in September 2005, giv
ing Stanford permission to go ahead with
the trails, pending approval from San
Mateo County officials.
In return for building the Santa Clara
trail, the University will acquire an addi
tional two square-miles for new build
ings.
If San Mateo County approves the
proposed trail, Stanford will allocate $8.4
million for improvements on Alpine
Road. To be eligible for these funds, San
Mateo County must complete work on
the road by 2011 and sign a contract out
lining the specific renovations.
San Mateo's Board of Supervisors re
cently created a subcommittee to review

the proposal.
Two members of this subcommittee,
Jerry Hill and Rich Gordon, will serve as
the "link between plan proponents, the
affected departments and the full board."
according to a recent article in The San
Mateo Daily.
Gordon said that although the trail is
definitely in San Mateo County's future,
he is worried about the time frame al
lowed to complete it.
"This proposed trail is on our master
plan, but has never been identified as a
priority trail." he wrote in an email toThe
Daily. "To move the Stanford proposal
forward would require giving this trail a
higher priority and would require the in
vestment of staff time ([and] financial re
sources) into the process."
Gordon added that financial concerns
are at the top of San Mateo County's list.
"The Stanford plan for a trail along
Alpine Road includes moving the road
(and re-configuring a hillside) and build
ing in a sensitive riparian corridor," he
wrote. "Both of these are subject to envi
ronmental review and public comment.
This process will be costly and time con
suming."
Gordon also discussed other financial
concerns, such as hiring personnel to
work on the trail.
"There is no current way to get reim
bursed for the staff costs," he said. "So
this would be an out-of-pocket expense

for San Mateo County."
Due to the Alpine Road deadline
given to the county, the committee is ex
pected to come to a decision in the near
future.
Gordon said he does not foresee
problems in arriving at a resolution.
"At the very outside, San Mateo
County must make a decision by the end
of 2011." he said. "I expect a decision
much, much sooner. Our subcommittee
will be meeting with staff to discuss the
key issues and to consider a timeline for
decision points."
"'There could be some early decisions
to be made by the San Mateo County
Board of Supervisors or we could ask
staff to use the next several months to de
velop issues," Gordon added. "The first
subcommittee meeting to be held later
this week will be critical in developing
the first steps to a timeline."
If San Mateo County ultimately de
cides against the proposal. Santa Clara
County would then receive the allocated
$8.4 million.
Hill spoke about possible benefits of
the trail in the recent San Mateo Daily ar
ticle.
"There are favorable ways to look at
it,"he said. "We could get a nice trail
through our county paid for by someone
else. But it needs to fit into the plans of
the county and be something we find
beneficial."
