How do Yiddish novels reveal changes in modern Jewish life and literature in Europe and the U.S.
in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries? This course will examine the influences of folklore,
traditional Jewish culture, and European literature on the rise of the novel in Yiddish.
We will read works by Isaac and Joshua Singer, Joseph Opatoshu, Chava Rosenfarb, Mendele
Moykher Slorim, Sholem Aleichem and David Bergclson.
Readings will be in English, with optional sessions for close readings in Yiddish.
