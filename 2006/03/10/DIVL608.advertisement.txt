Announcing Openings for
Sophomore College Assistants, Oral Communication Tutors
and Residential Computer Coordinators
for the 2006 Sophomore College
September 2 - September 22, 2006
Sophomore College is a set of programs for returning sophomores, who live together in a student residence and work under faculty supervision in a series of small-group classes during early September, before the start
of fall quarter.
Dates
September 2, 2006 - Student staff must arrive back on campus between noon and 5:00 p.m. • September 2, 2006, evening - student staff training begins. • Staff duties will continue through September 22. • September 4, 2006 -.
Participating students must arrive back on campus between noon and 5:00 p.m. • College will remain in session through September 22.
• Sophomore College Assistants (SCAs): Each faculty member is assisted by two upper-class sophomore college assistants (SCAs). SCAs have a combination of three roles: academic advisor, residence staff, and
teaching assistant. They will live in residence with student participants, report to and collaborate with the faculty, as well as Assistant Directors in the dorms. Any student who will be a junior or senior in 2006-2007 and is in good
academic standing is eligible to apply. (In some instances, one of the SCAs may be a graduate student.) SCAs will receive room, board, and a stipend TBA (Stipend was $750 in 2005) for full-time work during the course of the pro
gram, and for potential planning meetings with faculty at the end of this spring quarter. Note: Due to the fact that the training for RA, RCC, lIR\C, and OV programs conflict with Sophomore College, if you are selected for both posi
tions, you must choose between them. We will coordinate with the Peer Mentor Program and CTL Subject Tutor Program, so these positions will not conflict.
• Residential Computer Coordinators (RCCs) and Oral Communication I\itors (OCTs):RCCs and OCTs will also live in residence and will receive room and board as part of their compensation. Only RCC appli
cants that have already completed RCC training can be considered. The stipend for RCCs will be in an amount TBA ($5OO in 2005) and the OCTs will be paid an hourly wage commensurate with level of training
Staff applications, full job descriptions, and the updated list of faculty and course titles will be available at http://soco.stanford.edu on Friday, March 10, after 5 p.m.
