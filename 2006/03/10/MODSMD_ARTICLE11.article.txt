Overwhelmed with school work
as we enter the end of the
quarter crunch, Stanford stu
dents aren't likely to travel far to sat
isfy their cravings this week. 1 couldn't
afford taking anything more than a
short trip away from campus, so I
headed over to University Avenue in
search of a quick bite. I found myself
at Sushi Tomo, which occupies the
space formerly home to World Wraps.
Relics of Sushi Tomo's predecessor
linger in the continued use of World
Wraps' colorful tables. Red and yel
low walls, paper lanterns and cranes
hanging from a high ceiling give the
restaurant a bright, cheery feel.
Perusing Sushi Tomo's menu while
contentedly sipping my complemen
tary green tea, I was favorably im
pressed by the prices. I paid $9.95 for
soup, salad, rice and a dinner box con
taining chicken teriyaki, tempura and
California rolls. At lunch, the same
fare costs $7.50.
During both lunch and dinner, the
roll combo with miso soup, salad and
six California rolls, six tuna rolls and
six. Kappa (cucumber) roll pieces or
18 vegetarian rolls costs $8.95. A la
carte sushi ranges from $1.75 for Inari
and Tomago to $7.95 for eight pieces
of special rolls, with many costing
$3.50.
Despite the low cost of several
items on Sushi Tomo's menu, you'll
need to dish out at least $6 for your
meal â€” Sushi Tomo enforces a mini
mum charge per person. There's also
a $15 minimum for credit card
charges.
Though Sushi Tomo is reasonably
priced, the food itself is not spectacu
lar. In fact, 1 had several complaints
about my meal: The chicken teriyaki
sauce was somewhat watery, and the
texture of the chicken was rubbery
and unappetizing. Also, the dipping
sauce for the tempura bordered on
tasteless, while the tempura batter
was thick and heavy, not light and
crispy like it should be.
However, I believe that part of my
dissatisfaction with my meal came
from selecting the wrong menu items.
Perhaps 1 should have taken the hint
from Sushi Tomo's name and gone
the route of my neighboring restau
rant patrons by enjoying a lot of sushi
at a great price.
Given my less than stellar experi
ence with the chicken teriyaki and
tempura, I can certainly advise pa
trons of Sushi Tomo to steer away
from non-sushi items, but 1 won't sug
gest that people stay away from Sushi
Tomo all together. I have a hunch that
sushi is the way to go at Sushi Tomo in
terms of value and quality.
Due to Sushi Tomo's inexpensive
prices, I think I'll make a second visit
to the near-campus location to focus
on sushi and see whether my stick-to
sushi theory pans out.
