For me, this year has been full of "Senior Moments"
— the gratuitous "last football game," weekly Se
nior Pub Night and Senior Semi-Formal to name a
few. But there are also the anxiety-ridden job fairs,
applications to graduate schools, job hunting and, in
general, figuring out what I want to do in life. Never
theless, of all the "Senior Moments" that I will experience this
year, the Sunday afternoon I spent with friends at Vino Locale
ranks highest amongst them.
Located in the garden of a historic Victorian house and the
former site of the Palo Alto Tea Garden, Vino Locale provides
a quaint and peaceful atmosphere for the enjoyment of good
wine and great food. Showcasing wines from around Santa
Clara County and the Santa Cruz Mountains, owner and propri
etor Randy Robinson focuses on getting to know local grape
growers and winemakers.
Offering vintages from more than 30 wineries and vineyards
in Northern California, the prices at Vino Locale are reason
able, with generous 2-ounce. tastes ranging from $1 to $6. Priced
by the taste, glass and bottle, Vino Locale accommodates the
multi-millionaire and the poor college student alike.
Of the wines I tasted, the thick and full-bodied Martella Zin
fandel (20()1) was by far my favorite. Robinson also offers sev
eral white wines, dessert wines and champagne. If you're look
ing for a fruity alternative, you can order a glass of homemade
sangria for $5.
Not in the mood for wine? Robinson also carries a selection
of locally produced beers, coffee, iced tea and Hansen's Natural
Sodas.
Though wine is the main focus of Vino Locale, the bar and
small restaurant also offers savory and sweet delights. Robinson
serves an impressive assortment of goat cheeses from Harley
Farms in Pescadero, Calif. During our visit, my friends and I
sampled the Cranberry-Walnut, Monet, Dill and Apricot fla
vored goat cheeses, served with slices of baguette. Some of us or
dered grilled panini and sausage sandwiches, while I ogled the
chocolate truffles at the next table.
While the food is slightly expensive and more of a snack than
a filling meal. Vino Locale truly shines as a haven for fine and
fresh food. With art for sale on the walls, jazz music in the back
ground, a glass of wine in my hand and the aroma of good food
filling the room, I was glad to relax in the coziness of the venue.
Whether you're looking for a mature yet quaint place to have
a drink and a snack or if you just want to try out the life of a wine
connoisseur, make sure to check out Vino Locale.
