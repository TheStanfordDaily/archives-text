# California knows how to party: hot spots of California Avenue
## 
### CAITLIN BERKA 
Sleepy California Avenue, located a few blocks south of
Stanford off El Camino Real, has long been dismissed as
a relatively dormant part of local culture. Dubbed "Palo
Alto's other downtown," it doesn't have the same flashy
flair as University Avenue or the sheer volume of con
sumer outlets as the Stanford Shopping Center. Yet its
quiet, understated appeal and array of offbeat, independent establish
ments give it a unique and eclectic feel, making it a beloved addition
to the city.

Printer's Inc.
Delightfully cluttered and chock
full of colorful tomes. Printer's Inc.
is more reminiscent of your great
grandmother's attic than a book
store.The Kepler's of California Av
enue, Printer's Inc. closed its doors
temporarily in 1998 but reopened in
response to public outcry. Now, pa
trons are greeted by the smell of
fresh-brewed coffee wafting from
the equally-famed cafe, as well as
friendly employees who will find lit
erally any book, regardless of
whether it's in stock. Warm, cozy
and bursting with a literary vibe.
Printer's Inc. is truly a California
landmark. (The nearby Know
Knew Books, a used bookstore, is a
nice complement with a similar
indie feel.)
Fayrouz
This impossibly trendy Mediter
ranean-restaurant-cum-nightclub is
a fairly recent addition to Califor
nia. Catering to a younger crowd of

mostly well-dressed yuppies and
ehic recent grads, Fayrouz is miracu
lously affordable even for a starving
student. It's a burgeoning hotspot to
see and be seen, but the atmosphere
is the real reason to go. Even the
restaurant feels like a club, with
dimmed bluish lighting and high,
sparse walls. Middle Eastern music
videos play on a TV screen on the
back wall, giving it a kitschy, fun
feel. The food is delectable, with a
wide variety of Mediterranean dish
es including several vegetarian
meals. A nice option are mezza, or
small sampler dishes, to be shared,
almost like a tapas bar. For dessert,
the TUrkish coffee and baklava are
out of this world. Fun and stylish.
Fayrouz is not to be missed.
The Nut House
Widely considered the best dive bar
within a 25-mile radius. The Nut
House is known a mecca of unpre
tentiousness in the midst of the
overly self-important Silicon Valley.

For this reason, it's likely to be pop
ulated by out-of-towners on any
given night, but the cheap prices
and proximity to the University
give it that college-y, frat-house
feel-as does the sizeable crowd of
Stanford patrons. Peanut shells lit
ter the floor — you actually have to
wrestle your peanuts away from the
resident animatronic gorilla — rau
cous games of foosball and darts
surround you at every angle and the
Jagermeister flows freely. The bar
tenders might be a little rough
around the edges, but they get
friendlier once you become a regu
lar. Sorry, kids, gotta have your IDs
for this one.
Leaf and Petal
Make sure to pad your wallet before
setting off to this trendy boutique.
Carrying only designer brands at
rather hefty prices, Leaf and Petal is
every fashionista's dream and a
starving college student's nightmare.
Just stepping inside can make you

feel like a diabetic in a candy store.
Still, the clothes are soft and pretty,
the salespeople are ridiculously
good-looking, and after all, this may
be as close to Hollywood as you will
ever get. As one patron puts it, "If
Sofia Coppola lived in Palo Alto, she
would probably shop at Leaf and
Petal-
Avenue of the Arts
Not one of California Avenue's
main attractions per se. Avenue of
the Arts is simply its more poetic
street name. The California Av
enue Area Development Associa
tion — yes, it does sound preten
tious — commissioned its first
major artwork in 1996 and has
since collected a vast array of
quirky statues by local artists that
pepper the street and contribute to
its off-the-beaten-path atmos
phere. Good for a stroll on a clear
day, the Avenue of the Arts is prob
ably the foremost collection of
public artwork in Palo Alto.
