## Editorial Troops in Iraq deserve more compassion 
### 
As we finish our last minute cramming
before finals start next Sunday, we
will also mark the third anniversary
of the United States declaration of war on
Iraq. Since the war began three years ago,
over 2,000 American military personnel
have died. It has truly polarized the nation;
meanwhile, the high-flying rhetoric on both
sides reminds us that the stakes are high. Yet,
we have reached a point where it is hard to
have a reasoned discussion across party lines
about the war.
There are many moral ambiguities. Some
see the war as part of a larger crusade against
terror.To them, the war promises democracy in
the Middle East, and with it peace and stability.
To others, however, the war in Iraq is a
quagmire.They believe that the exaggerated
reports of weapons of mass destruction, pris
oner abuse in Abu Ghraib and the lack of
proper armor for soldiers all represent fail
ures of the current administration.
As students at an elite university, it is easy
to limit our interaction with this war to ei
ther criticize or support the government's
actions. In the process, many of us have
blurred the line between supporting the ad
ministration and supporting the troops on
the ground.
Yet. as we enter the fourth year of mili
tary action in Iraq, remember that included
among the hundreds of thousands of Amer
ican troops serving in Iraq are many of our
peers. Remember that they are doing a diffi
cult job — to serve and fight where the gov
ernment commands. Remember that it is
these men and women who actually pay the
price of this war.Those who serve with honor
and integrity deserve our support, regardless
of our personal opinions about George W.
Bush. Dick Cheney. Condoleezza Rice and
the rest of the administration.
Consider the position of the American

soldier and the U.S. Marine in Iraq. Perhaps
their decision to fight was completely apolit
ical. Maybe they made a choice to join the
armed forces because it was a lifelong ambi
tion; maybe they joined because they need
ed the money.They are well aware of the ob
jections to this war; in fact, they may even
agree with some of the objections. Remem
ber nonetheless that these American sol
diers are risking their lives everyday on the
battle field.
Some soldiers fight because they sincerely
believe that by doing so they are securing the
peace of their families and loved ones back
home; others fight for a cause they find hard
to believe in. Some deliberately shoot to miss
because they are fighting a war they believe to
be unjust. Whatever their motivations, these
soldiers have to make tough moral decisions
on a daily basis — decisions not made any
easier by the pressures of combat.
Whenever we discuss the war. an easy set
of dichotomies springs up. Republicans are
presumed to support the war while Democ
rats are presumed not to. Let us strive to
transcend these divisions to support our
peers who are bearing the real brunt of this
war. When engaging in political debates on
the issue, remember that the price of the de
cision is the lives of soldiers. Don't engage in
meaningless trash-talking of soldiers — con
sider instead the difficult situation they have
been placed in. Take advantage of opportu
nities to send greetings or care packages to
American troops or through the many Web
sites that allow you to do so.
More than anything —in this tumul
tuous time of war and ideological conflicts
— try to see past the smoke and mirrors of
the political rhetoric surrounding the war.
Recognize that the troops pay the price for
the government's policies in Iraq, and they
are not so different from us.
