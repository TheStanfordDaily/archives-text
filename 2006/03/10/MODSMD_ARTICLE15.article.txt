# It's bird flu season
## 
### 
Dear Sanofi Pasteur,
As the French pharmaceutical company
responsible for equipping much of the world
with a vaccine against avian influenza, you
are charged with a grave and serious task, 112
am sure you will do everything in your abili
ty to ensure that humankind is protected
from our fearsome microbial enemy.
Which is too bad.
Bird flu is our best bet at the moment for
a global Armageddon that will leave behind
only a few, scattered survivors. Being one of
those survivors and wandering a post-apoc
alyptic wasteland in search of canned goods,
and dry matches has been a life goal of mine,
something I have aspired to since seeing
"Terminator 2" on TV in fifth grade.
It's a goal of mine because I believe I
have the skills to prosper in a dead or dying
world. For one, I am an Eagle Scout and am
therefore comfortable in the outdoors. I am
nearing completion of an economics degree
at Stanford and will be well-equipped to
swindle fellow traders as we attempt to es
tablish a primitive barter system. I am a nat
ural leader and would be good at forming
marauding cliques of loosely-aligned scav
engers. Tribal formation is necessary for pro
tecting ourselves from other tribes, initiating
a sad mimicry of human culture and engag
ing in promiscuous sex.
As springtime approaches in the North
ern Hemisphere. I have been encouraging
friends and family to get outdoors. Hunting,
camping and tree-climbing are all enjoyable
pastimes that will put them in close proxim
ity to migratory fowl and increase their odds
of being the lucky human being to harbor a
swiftly mutating virus capable of wiping out
three-quarters of humanity.
Of course, 1 do not put all my hope in your
failure. Other possible Apocalypses, in order
of likelihood, are:

The Melting of the Polar Ice Caps: 2-to-l
odds. Its only a matter of time before Ne
braska is a verdant tropical coastline. But
how much time? I don't have forever. And
the melting of the polar ice caps will, in all
likelihood, move at glacial speeds, providing
time for island and coastal residents to flee
the rising water. Quality of Apocalypse: 1
(out of 5).
Nuclear Armageddon: 10-to-l. This is a
favorite of Hollywood and science fiction lit
erature, but the chances of Nuclear Ar
mageddon will decrease significantly once
Bush leaves office. (I know,sorry â€” that was
my handout to liberal readers). And even if
Osama gets his hands on a Little Boy, it is un
likely we will reach nuclear winter. But if we
do...Quality of Apocalypse: 4.
Robots: 15-to-l. Mankind is in tatters,but
the indefatigable human spirit plans its
counterattack against the robots from dusty
below-ground bomb shelters. My favorite
Armageddon. John Connor, eat my dust.
Quality of Apocalypse: 5.
Meteor: I,(KX)-to-l. An unlikely scenario,
but complete destruction is ensured. TTiat's
the problem with it: if the dinosaurs couldn't
make it. how will 1? Quality of Apocalypse: 1.
The Smiting Hand of God: ??. The odds
are indeterminate. If you're Pat Robertson,
they are damn near close to KM) percent. But

A whole lotta B.S.
of Apocalypse: 2.
I, for one, am rooting for bird flu.
It has migrated from Asia to Africa to
Europe, and cases have been found
in domesticated cats, zoo tigers and
swine. Your company is trying to halt
the spread.
The good news is that World
Health Organization experts say
your vaccine is unlikely to be effec
tive against a human pandemic of
avian influenza. A new vaccine
would need to be created and manu
factured in less than six months to
have a chance of staunching the viral
tide.
But I have hope. You're a French
company and probably incapable of
working hard enough to save
mankind.

Barrett wants to take you bird-watching.
