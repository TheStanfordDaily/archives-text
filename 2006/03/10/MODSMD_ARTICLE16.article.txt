Fraternity and sorority stereotypes
are unfounded and untrue
Chris Lin's column in yesterday's paper,
"Fraternities and Sororities: It's All Greek
to Me," was poorly timed and distasteful.
With the spring rush period only a few weeks
away, the column perpetuates negative
stereotypes about fraternities and sororities
that could discourage prospective members
from rushing. Phi Kappa Psi is not a house of
geeks who rush there to do homework to
gether. Kappa Sigma is not a house full of
stoners who just sit around all day and get
high. Sigma Alpha Hpsilon is not a fraternity
of rapists who sexually assault people once
they enter the house. These stereotypes are
unfounded and blatantly untrue, yet contin
ue to exist because of columns like Mr. Lin's.
As this spring's rush period approaches,
prospective rushees (especially freshmen)
need to be given an honest, non-stereotypi

cal view of Greek life so that they may ex
plore all of their options and choose the
house that suits them best. 1 invite all fresh
men to attend the remaining Greek social
events on campus this quarter, but more im
portantly. to give rush a try. Each Greek or
ganization has its own unique blend of indi
viduals. Come meet our members and judge
us for yourselves. Don't let unfounded
stereotypes discourage you from giving
Greek life a chance.
