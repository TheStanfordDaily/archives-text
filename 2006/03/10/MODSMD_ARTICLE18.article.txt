# Charlie likes tea
## 
### 
After the excitement of last week's Prom
(which, incidentally, was a riot) I'm
feeling a little apathetic, so I'm not
writing a column this week. While this might
seem like a problem, I have a plan: someone
else is going to write it for me.
An old writing partner (and object of my
eternal affections) is visiting me from Eng
land and, having arrived in San Francisco
after a coast-to-coast trip, he's going to regale
you with his impressions of your magnificent
country; well, either that or he's going to piss
you off. Anyway, without further ado, here's
Charlie:
What is it with America and tea? I've just
driven S.(MX) miles across this vast, incredible
country and I was not able to get a good cup
of tea anywhere.
I can't understand it. Tea is a wonderful,
wonderful thing. It's very simple to make, it's
not bad for your health, it's soothing, com
forting and reassuring and it's cheap as chips.
In England, if you visit someone's house, they
give you a cup of tea. If your cat has just died,
you have a cup of tea. If you've just got home
after a tough day at work, you have a cup of
tea. If you've just been binned by your bird
(dumped by girlfriend),you hit the pub.drink
10 pints of lager, get in a fight, steal a fridge
and pass out unconscious in the street.Then,
when you wake up, you have a cup of tea.
There is no situation that cannot be im
proved by tea.
So why don't you have it here? I really
think it would make you all feel better. You

could stop worrying about tropical storms,
gun control, killer bees, the situation in the
Middle East and all the other things that get
you guys wound up. You can adopt it as a na
tional pastime, wholesale. Imagine: blacks
and whites. Republicans and Democrats, rich
and poor, all enjoying a nice cup of tea at four
o' clock every afternoon. You can all just sit
back, put your feet up. inhale the steam and
enjoy the drink from the first scalding sip to
the last sweetened swig.
Look, here's what you do. First, don't
worry about china cups, teapots, saucers, etc.
— all that nonsense is great if your mother's
visiting, but not actually necessary for mak
ing excellent tea. Next, find a big mug (and
not a glass, OK?). Rinse it out if you're fussy
about germs and stuff. Boil some water in a
kettle. Put a teabag (Tetley's, if you can find
it) in the mug. Pour in the boiling water. Wait
for a minute, then stir it around a bit, remove
the bag, add a slosh of milk and two sugars
and drink the damn thing. Easy, right?
It's especially strange when you consid
er the quality and variety of the rest of the
menu over here. When I had breakfast this

afternoon, I was offered six different bread
products, eight different varieties of cooked
egg and 12 flavors of milkshake. Why can't
I choose to have my tea the way I like it
(and, for that matter, the bacon)? The tea
was weak, lukewarm, served in a glass and
disappointing in every possible way. At
least, it would have been disappointing if I
hadn't learnt to expect primitive, substan
dard, epsilon-double-minus tea from
America.
It's like a huge trans-national blind spot.
It's a terrible, terrible flaw in an otherwise
marvelous country. Across 18 states, 1 saw
some amazing things: an Atlantic sunrise in
South Carolina, a Pacific sunset in San Diego,
limitless desert in New Mexico, a Mardi Gras
parade in New Orleans, alligators in Florida.
1 played poker in Vegas, drank absinthe with
Indians in the Navajo Nation, ate a 72 oz.
steak in Texas and visited the Met in New
York. The USA is a spectacular, dazzling and
fantastically diverse country. Amid all this
variety, there were only two things common
to all the states: i) terrifying Christian radio
stations and ii) piss-poor tea.
So make some decent tea, lose the whole
Jesus thing, vote a little bit more intelligently
in 2(H)8 and declare independence for Cali
fornia. Get those things sorted and every
thing else will follow.

Email Charlie Ralitz (liplomat@gniail.com if
you think you can offer him a decent cup of tea;
he'll he here until Tuesday. Alternatively, both
er me at navhvi@stanford.edu.

limitless desert in New Mexico, a Mardi Gras
parade in New Orleans, alligators in Florida.
1 played poker in Vegas, drank absinthe with
Indians in the Navajo Nation, ate a 72 oz.
steak in Texas and visited the Met in New
York. The USA is a spectacular, dazzling and
fantastically diverse country. Amid all this
variety, there were only two things common
to all the states: i) terrifying Christian radio
stations and ii) piss-poor tea.
So make some decent tea, lose the whole
Jesus thing, vote a little bit more intelligently
in 2(H)8 and declare independence for Cali
fornia. Get those things sorted and every
thing else will follow.

Email Charlie Ralitz (liplomat@gniail.com if
you think you can offer him a decent cup of tea;
he'll he here until Tuesday. Alternatively, both
er me at navhvi@stanford.edu.
