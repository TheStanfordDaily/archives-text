# So many films, so little time
## 
### 
Berlinale: the Berlin Film Festival. Not
as cool as Sundance, not as chic as
Cannes, but still a weird, explosive 11
days of films. There were 360 this year —
mostly European, some Middle Eastern and
a few big ticket Hollywood items ("V for
Vendetta's world premiere"). We need to go
for class; but for me, it's more like a race. Who
can see the most films'?
My enemy: Stephen Ringer, footballer,
fellow Film major, scrubby Berlin program
heartthrob. We are well-matched — he, a la
conic admirer of Antonioni; me, a fanatic for
post-"Scarface" Pacino. We are the yin and
the yang, the sincerest and the absurdist.This
is our battleground.
My constant companion: Maggie, who
finds something immensely charming
about my film geekery (a truly evolved girl,
she).
It's 5:20 Sunday morning. Day 4. We need
to line up early for tickets. We were up until
12:30 a.m. watching an Irish transvestite in
70s Ireland ("Breakfast on Pluto" — hilari
ous). I've seen 13 films in three days — an Is
raeli chick flick here (with a meet-cute dur
ing a terrorist bombing), a grandly horrible
Moroccan flick there (think a beer commer
cial remake of "Amores Perros").They're all

blurring now; I'm living off coffee, cigarettes
and bratwurst.
Today's the big show: the buzzed-about
German flick "Elementary Particles," and
Michel "Eternal Sunshine" Gondry's new
mindbender,"The Science of Sleep."
Ringer's already in line. "I stayed out all
night," he says, smiling ruefully. I can see be
hind the grin — he's judging me, he thinks
I'm weak for resting at a time like this. My
sleep-deprived mind considers sabotage,
maybe stealing his pass, or something subtler
like framing him for homicide, or planting
heroin in his wallet... I fall asleep scheming
and wake up badly needing a coffee.
We get to the Urania theater at 8:55 a.m.
It's packed; we sit front-row center. Many
people whine about sitting so close. I saw
"The Two Towers" opening day in the front

row of the Mercado and went epileptic with
joy during Helm's Deep. Up front, you're
ABSORBED by the movie — if you're not
ready for that, stay home with your flat
screen, save that theater money and die un
happy.
"Particles" is the best movie in the festi
val. There've been too many self-consciously
"gritty" films, with shaky cameras and mo
rose characters. I saw a lesbian movie with no
action, no hot Romanian chicks making out
and a lot of pouting and whining about the
unbearable lightness. Now, "Particles," here's
a film about sexual perversion, addiction, sui
cide, miscarriage, emotional abuse and insan
ity that's never less than completely hilari
ous. It's "Requiem for a Dream," only laugh
out-loud funny.
"ITie New World" is next. It's from Ter
ence Malick, who made "The Thin Red
Line," perhaps the only war movie that could
double as its own pretentious New Age
screen saver. "The New World" is told mostly
with voiceover that sounds like a fifth grade
lovepuppy stalker: "She makes all things
lighter... she is my all." The tone is between
glacial and stoned. Everybody else hated it;
