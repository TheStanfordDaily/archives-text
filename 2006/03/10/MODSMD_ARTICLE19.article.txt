# So many films, so little time
## 
### 
Berlinale: the Berlin Film Festival. Not
as cool as Sundance, not as chic as
Cannes, but still a weird, explosive 11
days of films. There were 360 this year —
mostly European, some Middle Eastern and
a few big ticket Hollywood items ("V for
Vendetta's world premiere"). We need to go
for class; but for me, it's more like a race. Who
can see the most films'?
My enemy: Stephen Ringer, footballer,
fellow Film major, scrubby Berlin program
heartthrob. We are well-matched — he, a la
conic admirer of Antonioni; me, a fanatic for
post-"Scarface" Pacino. We are the yin and
the yang, the sincerest and the absurdist.This
is our battleground.
My constant companion: Maggie, who
finds something immensely charming
about my film geekery (a truly evolved girl,
she).
It's 5:20 Sunday morning. Day 4. We need
to line up early for tickets. We were up until
12:30 a.m. watching an Irish transvestite in
70s Ireland ("Breakfast on Pluto" — hilari
ous). I've seen 13 films in three days — an Is
raeli chick flick here (with a meet-cute dur
ing a terrorist bombing), a grandly horrible
Moroccan flick there (think a beer commer
cial remake of "Amores Perros").They're all

blurring now; I'm living off coffee, cigarettes
and bratwurst.
Today's the big show: the buzzed-about
German flick "Elementary Particles," and
Michel "Eternal Sunshine" Gondry's new
mindbender,"The Science of Sleep."
Ringer's already in line. "I stayed out all
night," he says, smiling ruefully. I can see be
hind the grin — he's judging me, he thinks
I'm weak for resting at a time like this. My
sleep-deprived mind considers sabotage,
maybe stealing his pass, or something subtler
like framing him for homicide, or planting
heroin in his wallet... I fall asleep scheming
and wake up badly needing a coffee.
We get to the Urania theater at 8:55 a.m.
It's packed; we sit front-row center. Many
people whine about sitting so close. I saw
"The Two Towers" opening day in the front

row of the Mercado and went epileptic with
joy during Helm's Deep. Up front, you're
ABSORBED by the movie — if you're not
ready for that, stay home with your flat
screen, save that theater money and die un
happy.
"Particles" is the best movie in the festi
val. There've been too many self-consciously
"gritty" films, with shaky cameras and mo
rose characters. I saw a lesbian movie with no
action, no hot Romanian chicks making out
and a lot of pouting and whining about the
unbearable lightness. Now, "Particles," here's
a film about sexual perversion, addiction, sui
cide, miscarriage, emotional abuse and insan
ity that's never less than completely hilari
ous. It's "Requiem for a Dream," only laugh
out-loud funny.
"ITie New World" is next. It's from Ter
ence Malick, who made "The Thin Red
Line," perhaps the only war movie that could
double as its own pretentious New Age
screen saver. "The New World" is told mostly
with voiceover that sounds like a fifth grade
lovepuppy stalker: "She makes all things
lighter... she is my all." The tone is between
glacial and stoned. Everybody else hated it;

Eins! Swei! Drei!
Mags slept; I have not been so fully swept
away by a movie since "Lord of the
Rings," and that was packed with action
scenes and epic special effects. It's the
strangest Hollywood movie since "Fear
and Loathing," and I bet. like Kubrick's
movies, it'll be huge in about two
decades. This will revive your faith in
Colin Farrel: his looks of artful constipa
tion perfectly fit the material.
Mags and I go our separate ways; I
meet Ringer at "Voyage to Italy," direct
ed by the great Neorealist Roberto
Rossellini. Working in post-war Italy,
Rossellini sought to capture a new real
ity onscreen, far removed from the Old
Hollywood dreamland. I applaud his ef
forts — his work is often so realistic, it
feels like actual boredom. Still, nothing
beats Bergman on the silver screen (shit
on you. Video), or seeing her daughter,
Isabella, at the screening. If you've seen
"Blue Velvet," she's the crazy nympho

getting it on with Dennis Hopper. Great
actress.
On the way to "Science of Sleep," I ask
Ringer how many films. "Whoo. I don't
know man, I'm losing count." Liar. You
lie. Ringer. He knows he's doomed.
"Eternal Sunshine" was the rare film
everyone could like: artsy enough for the
beret crowd, funny enough for the uncul
tured plebes, romantic enough for both
genders. "Science of Sleep" has the same
dream structure, same narrative
leapfrogs through time, same cutesy hip
ster romance subplot. But it's too much
whimsy, not enough substance — think
"Life Aquatic" vs "Royal Tenenbaums."
It stars Gael Garcia Bernal, the indie Or
lando Bloom — an actor just dangerous
enough for English majors, fifth graders
and lesbians. Still, this has been an awe
some day for movies — the best in Berli
nale, maybe the best ever.
Oh, and my final count is 34. Ringer
saw 40.

Darren Franich has seen more movies
than God. Test his blasphemy at
