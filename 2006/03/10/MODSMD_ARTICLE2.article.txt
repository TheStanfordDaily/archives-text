# ARIZONA 73, STANFORD 68
## NOT IN TOURNEY, FIRST SINCE '94 "We didn't win enough games. It's disappointing and that's it." 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
- MATT HARYASZ, senior center

LOS ANGELES — Though the NCAA
field will not be officially announced until
Sunday, there is little suspense for players,
coaches, experts or even the casual fan.
After a 73-68 loss to Arizona in the Pac-10
Tournament Quarterfinals, Stanford will
miss the NCAA Tournament for the first
time since 1994.
In that 11-year span, Stanford had accu
mulated the fifth-longest active streak of
consecutive NCAA appearances in the na
tion. Only Arizona (21), Kansas (16), Ken
tucky (14) and Cincinnati (14) have been to
the Big Dance more times in a row.
"[Ending the NCAA Tournament
streak] is really disappointing, especially in
your senior year," said senior forward Matt
Haryasz, who tallied 14 points on 6-of-8
shooting, as well as five rebounds and five
turnovers. "We didn't win enough games,
and we had td fight hard for other ones. It's
disappointing and that's it."
Now. the Card will likely be delegated to
the National InVite Tournament, with their
first game coming between Mar. 14 and
Mar. 17.
The outstanding play of Mustafa Shakur
and Ivan Radenovic helped the Wildcats
(19-11, 11-7 Pac-10) overcome Hassan
Adamsf absence to down the Cardinal (15-
13,11-7) for the third time this season.
The Wildcats were forced to play without
Adams, their leading scorer, after Coach
Lute Olson suspended him for the Pac-10
Tournament because of a DUI arrest.
As in the schools' previous two meetings
this season, the Cardinal saw no lack of op
portunities down the stretch. They cut the
Wildcat lead to just one point with 3:11 to
play, but their 23 turnovers on the afternoon
proved too costly to overcome.
"There is no question that the thing that
did it for us today was our defense," Olson
said. "That's been our trademark all year
long. Our guys believe that defense is the
way to win games. I think this is the best de
fensive team we've had here."
The Wildcats stifled the Cardinal's ball
movement, limiting opportunities and get
ting into passing lanes. Arizona finished
with 13 steals, including five by guard Chris
Rodgers — a Pac-10 Tournament record.
"You have to look at why those
turnovers happened," Stanford Coach Trent
Johnson said." You have to give credit to our
opponent. Bottom line is they are better
than us."
And while Arizonafs defense was solid,
Stanford had more than its share of offen-

sive miscues. In their final chance to keep
the 11-year streak alive, Haryasz and senior
guard Chris Hernandez combined for 12 of
the Cardi's 23 turnovers, many of them un
forced.
At the other end of the floor, Arizona's
offense proved too much in the final ten
minutes. While the Cardinal limited the
Wildcats to just two field goals in that
stretch, Arizona still got to the free-throw
line 22 times. They would make 17 of those
attempts to strengthen their NCAA bid and
advance to todayi's semifinal tilt against
UCLA (25-6, 14-4), a 79-47 winner over
Oregon State yesterday.
Yet Stanford still had a chance to snatch
the victory in the final minutes.The Cardinal
were down by just one, 61-60, following
sophomore guard Tim Morrisi' lay-in with
3:11 to play.
But Arizona answered with a layup from
Shakur (18 points, seven rebounds, six as
sists) and two Radenovic free throws. A
three-pointer from Cardinal freshman An
thony Goods — his only bucket in five long
range attempts — once again made it a one
possession game with two minutes remain
ing. But, fittingly, four turnovers in the final
2:30 cut the Stanford rally short.
Stanford opened the game hot, cruising
to a 9-2 lead in less than three minutes.
But the Wildcats countered with a 16-2
run that put the Card in an 18-11 hole. Rade
novic chipped in four of those points on his
way to a game-high 21.

streaks, Stanford responded with an 11-2 spurt of
its own to take a 22-20 edge, and hung on for a half
time 32-31 lead.
But, much as they did after trailing by two at
halftime in Palo Alto, the Wildcats jumped out to a
quick start in the second half and never trailed
again.
And as the Wildcats pulled away, Hary asz lost his
offensive touch when his team needed him the
most. While Hernandez scored 15 of his 20 in the
second half, Haryasz, playing against his home-state
school, scored only two of his 14 in the second half.
As has been the case in nearly every game re
cently, Haryasz was double-teamed every time he
touched the ball.
"We could tell early on in the game that he was
one of the guys that we had to stop in order to be
successful," Olson said. "We tried to come up
quickly and put pressure on him. Matt is a good
player, and it is really a compliment to him. the way
we have to guard him."
"I just didn't get opportunities to get a shot,"
Haryasz said. "If you don't shoot, you don't score.
I wasn't in a position to score in the second half."
Ultimately, not only Haryasz, but all four sen
iors ended their Pac-10 careers on a disappointing
note. Hernandez led the Cardinal in scoring with
20 points, but he also turned the ball over seven
times. Guard Dan Grunfeld was held to just five
points in 14 minutes, and guard Jason Haas didn't
get into the game at all.
"It is a disappointing way to go out, being a sen
ior," Grunfeld said. "We have four seniors that
played four years in the Pac-10 and have come
down here to L.A. every year. You don't want to
end your Pac-10 tenure on a loss."

the 11-year streak alive, Haryasz and senior
guard Chris Hernandez combined for 12 of
the Cardi's 23 turnovers, many of them un
forced.
At the other end of the floor, Arizona's
offense proved too much in the final ten
minutes. While the Cardinal limited the
Wildcats to just two field goals in that
stretch, Arizona still got to the free-throw
line 22 times. They would make 17 of those
attempts to strengthen their NCAA bid and

UCLA (25-6, 14-4), a 79-47 winner over

Yet Stanford still had a chance to snatch
the victory in the final minutes.The Cardinal
were down by just one, 61-60, following
sophomore guard Tim Morrisi' lay-in with
3:11 to play.
But Arizona answered with a layup from
Shakur (18 points, seven rebounds, six as
sists) and two Radenovic free throws. A
three-pointer from Cardinal freshman An
thony Goods — his only bucket in five long
range attempts — once again made it a one
possession game with two minutes remain

2:30 cut the Stanford rally short.
Stanford opened the game hot, cruising
to a 9-2 lead in less than three minutes.

its own to take a 22-20 edge, and hung on for a half
time 32-31 lead.
But, much as they did after trailing by two at
halftime in Palo Alto, the Wildcats jumped out to a
quick start in the second half and never trailed
again.
And as the Wildcats pulled away, Hary asz lost his
offensive touch when his team needed him the
most. While Hernandez scored 15 of his 20 in the
second half, Haryasz, playing against his home-state
school, scored only two of his 14 in the second half.
As has been the case in nearly every game re
cently, Haryasz was double-teamed every time he
touched the ball.
"We could tell early on in the game that he was
one of the guys that we had to stop in order to be
successful," Olson said. "We tried to come up
quickly and put pressure on him. Matt is a good
player, and it is really a compliment to him. the way
we have to guard him."
"I just didn't get opportunities to get a shot,"
Haryasz said. "If you don't shoot, you don't score.
I wasn't in a position to score in the second half."
Ultimately, not only Haryasz, but all four sen
iors ended their Pac-10 careers on a disappointing
note. Hernandez led the Cardinal in scoring with
20 points, but he also turned the ball over seven
times. Guard Dan Grunfeld was held to just five
points in 14 minutes, and guard Jason Haas didn't
get into the game at all.
"It is a disappointing way to go out, being a sen
ior," Grunfeld said. "We have four seniors that
played four years in the Pac-10 and have come
down here to L.A. every year. You don't want to
end your Pac-10 tenure on a loss."

LOS ANGELES — Though the NCAA
field will not be officially announced until
Sunday, there is little suspense for players,
coaches, experts or even the casual fan.
After a 73-68 loss to Arizona in the Pac-10
Tournament Quarterfinals, Stanford will
miss the NCAA Tournament for the first
time since 1994.
In that 11-year span, Stanford had accu
mulated the fifth-longest active streak of
consecutive NCAA appearances in the na
tion. Only Arizona (21), Kansas (16), Ken
tucky (14) and Cincinnati (14) have been to
the Big Dance more times in a row.
"[Ending the NCAA Tournament
streak] is really disappointing, especially in
your senior year," said senior forward Matt
Haryasz, who tallied 14 points on 6-of-8
shooting, as well as five rebounds and five
turnovers. "We didn't win enough games,
and we had td fight hard for other ones. It's
disappointing and that's it."
Now. the Card will likely be delegated to
the National InVite Tournament, with their
first game coming between Mar. 14 and
Mar. 17.
The outstanding play of Mustafa Shakur
and Ivan Radenovic helped the Wildcats
(19-11, 11-7 Pac-10) overcome Hassan
Adamsf absence to down the Cardinal (15-
13,11-7) for the third time this season.
The Wildcats were forced to play without
Adams, their leading scorer, after Coach
Lute Olson suspended him for the Pac-10
Tournament because of a DUI arrest.
As in the schools' previous two meetings
this season, the Cardinal saw no lack of op
portunities down the stretch. They cut the
Wildcat lead to just one point with 3:11 to
play, but their 23 turnovers on the afternoon
proved too costly to overcome.
"There is no question that the thing that
did it for us today was our defense," Olson
said. "That's been our trademark all year
long. Our guys believe that defense is the
way to win games. I think this is the best de
fensive team we've had here."
The Wildcats stifled the Cardinal's ball
movement, limiting opportunities and get

streaks, Stanford responded with an 11-2 spurt of
its own to take a 22-20 edge, and hung on for a half
time 32-31 lead.
But, much as they did after trailing by two at
halftime in Palo Alto, the Wildcats jumped out to a
quick start in the second half and never trailed
again.
And as the Wildcats pulled away, Hary asz lost his
offensive touch when his team needed him the
most. While Hernandez scored 15 of his 20 in the
second half, Haryasz, playing against his home-state
school, scored only two of his 14 in the second half.
As has been the case in nearly every game re
cently, Haryasz was double-teamed every time he
touched the ball.
"We could tell early on in the game that he was
one of the guys that we had to stop in order to be
successful," Olson said. "We tried to come up
quickly and put pressure on him. Matt is a good
player, and it is really a compliment to him. the way
we have to guard him."
"I just didn't get opportunities to get a shot,"
Haryasz said. "If you don't shoot, you don't score.
I wasn't in a position to score in the second half."
Ultimately, not only Haryasz, but all four sen
iors ended their Pac-10 careers on a disappointing
note. Hernandez led the Cardinal in scoring with
20 points, but he also turned the ball over seven
times. Guard Dan Grunfeld was held to just five
points in 14 minutes, and guard Jason Haas didn't
get into the game at all.
"It is a disappointing way to go out, being a sen
ior," Grunfeld said. "We have four seniors that
played four years in the Pac-10 and have come
down here to L.A. every year. You don't want to
end your Pac-10 tenure on a loss."
