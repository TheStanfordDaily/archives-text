## Card visit tired Trojans After five days off, Cardinal take on struggling USC 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
When Stanford and Southern California
meet tonight at Dedeaux Field, the amount of
rest each team has recently received could af
fect the outcome of the game. One team has
spent too much time on the playing field this
week, while the other has not spent enough.
Stanford's Sunday game against California
and its Tuesday game against San Jose State
were both postponed due to weather, giving
the No. 16 Cardinal (10-5) five days without
competition, or nearly a week of rust-gather
ing.
USC (10-9), on the other hand, was on the
diamond for more than five hours on TUesday
evening in a 13-inning loss to UC-Irvine.
Though USC put up good numbers at the
plate, the Anteaters eventually triumphed, 10-
9.
In addition to the emotional drain, the 13-
inning loss also fried the USC bullpen. The
Trojans sent eight hurlers to the mound, so
tonight's starter lan Kennedy (2-3,2.29 ERA)
will be trying to give his relievers some rest.
At the plate, USC left fielder Cyle Hankerd
bumped his batting average up to .425 with a 4-

for-7 day against Irvine. Hankerd leads his
team offensively with seven doubles, four
homeruns and 26 RBIs.
Backing Hankerd are third baseman Matt
Cusick, shortstop Blake Sharpe and first base
man Lucas Duda, who bat .403, .342 and .348,
respectively.
But Stanford has a hot bat of its own in sen
ior shortstop Chris Minaker (.381 average, 19
RBI. 5 HR), who will attempt to shake off the
long rest and extend his eight-game hitting
streak. In those eight games, Minaker's batting
average has jumped from .200 to .381 as he has
knocked in 15 runs.
Many members of the Stanford lineup,
however, have continued to struggle. Sopho
more rightfielder Michael Taylor follows Mi
naker's team-leading mark with a .346 average
and 14 RBI, but he and Minaker are the only
starters hitting above the .300 mark.
Meanwhile, despite the fact that the Trojans
have a .323 team average and sport a lineup
with five regulars above .300, Southern Cali
fornia is still battling to keep their record
above .500. They went 2-1 last weekend
against Georgia.
Junior Greg Reynolds starts tonight for
Stanford. I"he righthander is 1-1 with a 2.84

ERA this season after suffering his first loss
last weekend, a 7-6 heartbreaker at California.
His outing in Berkeley was his worst of the
season, even though he went 5.1 innings and
gave up just three earned runs on five hits.
Tonight's matchup figures to set the tone
for the weekend, with the teams' two aces
squaring off in a preview of their Pac-10 series
three weeks from now.
In his last start against Stanford last May,
Kennedy pitched a 5-2 win. In that game, the
future Pac-10 Pitcher of the Year went eight
innings, giving up just five hits and one earned
run.
The teams split the 2005 season series 3-3.
Matt Manship starts Saturday against the
Trojan's Ryan Cook, whose 7.20 ERA pales in
comparison to Manship's 3.97. Southpaw
Tommy Milone (4.50, 4-0) starts Sunday for
the Trojans.
The Cardinal will conclude their first road
trip of the season with this weekend's three
games in Malibu, Calif.They then take a week
long break for finals before plunging into Pac
-10 competition against Washington State on
Mar. 25.
Tonight's game begins at 6 p.m., with Satur
day and Sunday's tilts slated for 1 p.m.
