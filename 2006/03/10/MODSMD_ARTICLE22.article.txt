## How not to be that guy at the game

"You )e wearing the shirt of
the band you are going to see?
Dude, don'/ be that guy."
JAMES "DROZ" ANDREWS
Hey, being a fan is great. We get
the thrill of victory without
actually having to succeed.
We live and die with the team. Come
home with a championship, and
we're on top of the world. Lose a
game, and we're talking about relo
cating. While the melodrama is just a
part of being a diehard fanatic (ahh,
there's where the term fan comes
from), there are some of us who have
developed some unflattering habits
that make us look like idiots. In an ef
fort to correct these toolish behav
iors, here's my list of things to avoid
as a fan at a live sporting event.
Rule #1: Hang up the cell phone
"Oh holy crap! I'm on TV? Dude,
can you see me? This rocks!"God,do
I hate these guys. They go to the
game (normally dressed in the t-shirt
from the trucker rally or death metal
concert they were at the night be
fore), do everything they can to get
on the Jumbotron, and then proceed
to call their friends and tell them that
they can see you. "Holy crap! You
look like you on TV!"
Guys, this isn't that cool. It's not
even that unique. Want to be on TV?
Stay at home and buy a video cam
era. If you go to the game, watch the
game! Don't spend the majority of
the first half telling your friend how
awesome your seats are.
Rule #2: Minimize uniformity
Remember when you were in
Little League and your team would
go watch the pro sports team one
night, all dressed in your complete
uniform (even the cleats)? Yeah,
that was cute then. Now that you're
40, leave the baseball pants at
home. First, it's ridiculous to see a
grown man with a Peter Pan com
plex trying to garner attention by
dressing as a seven-year-old. Sec
ond, for the sake of public decency,
you shouldn't be wearing those
pants anymore. The athletes who
do are in shape. You look like
you've got cans of uncooked Pills
bury biscuits sticking out of your
legs.
Rule #3: If you can't think of any
thing creative to say, shut up!
Heckling the refs and opposing
players is part of the game. Everyone
enjoys hearing a creative taunt every
now and then, but it's not funny or
clever when you tell the ref "get off
your knees, you're blowing the
game" for the 17th time in the last
four minutes. Seriously, you've worn
it out. Give us a break and come up
with some new material. Spend some
time at home before the game think
ing of a repertoire. Because I don't
want to hear "Steroids!" as if it's the
most clairvoyant and original taunt
ever made about Barry Bonds.
