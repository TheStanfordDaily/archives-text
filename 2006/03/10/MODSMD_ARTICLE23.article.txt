Despite a light rain that forced No. 5 Stan
ford softball to finish Wednesday's batting
practice in jackets, the squad seemed unfazed.
It's March in the Bay Area, and that means
cloudy skies, cold weather and preseason soft
ball.
In one of their final tune-ups before Pac-10
play begins, the Cardinal (17-4) will host the
Stanford Invitational II this weekend, where
they will see both familiar local rivals and new
faces. And while the team continues to work
out the kinks, it is still looking to close out the
preseason on a high note.
After struggling at last weekend's Worth
Classic, where they dropped a game to UC-
Santa Barbara and barely pulled out wins over
No. 16 Northwestern and host Cal State-
Fullerton, the Cardinal are focusing on
preparing for the tough conference schedule
that kicks off at the end of the month.
"We had a game where we didn't show up

and play our best, so hopefully that will be a
learning experience that we can draw from,"
said head coach John Rittman of the UCSB
loss. "Santa Barbara played a really good
game, and we just need to realize that there is
a target on our backs and that we need to be
prepared to play every time we go on the
field."
Despite last weekend's lapses, the Cardinal
have, on the whole, gotten off to a strong start.
ITiey have been beat only by UCSB, No. IS
Baylor and No. 2 Texas, twice.
"We have learned some valuable lessons in
the 21 games that we have played, and I really
am pleased with the way the team is playing,"
Rittman said. "Ilie biggest thing is just keep
ing our focus and trying to improve daily."
The soggy fields have limited what the
team can do in practice, but they have used the
opportunity to work on fundamentals
"[Sophomore pitcher Lauren] Nydam and
[senior pitcher Laura] Severson got to throw
some innings in the cage â€” they got to see the
hitters, and the hitters got to see some live

pitching, which is important to do." Rittman
said. "When you are playing a lot of games in a
weekend this time of year, during the week
you just try to stay sharp and make adjust
ments"
And while there have been a few missteps
in the batters' box and in the field, the Cardi
nal have swept through much of their presea
son.
Senior centerfielder Catalina Morris and
freshman shortstop Maddy Coon have been
swinging hot bats all season and show no signs
of letting up. Morris leads the Cardinal in bat
ting average (.386), hits (27) and triples (3),
while Coon has team-high marks in runs (18),
homeruns (8). RBI (25) and slugging percent
age (.779).
While Coon has been getting it done at the
plate, her classmate Missy Penna has been
doing her part in the circle. Penna has already
amassed a 10-2 record and pitched four com
plete games,striking out 88 batters in only 77.1

innings. Sophomore Becky McCullough (4-2,
1.33 ERA) and senior Laura Severson (3-0,1.12
ERA) have also helped the Cardinal to its 17-4
record and No. 5 ranking in the national polls.
In this weekend's invitational, the Cardinal
will be the heavy favorites. None of the oppo
nents are ranked in the Top 25, but Rittman said
they need to take each game seriously, as the
UCSB loss showed.
"Every team, with the exception of Middle
Tennessee State, played in the postseason either
last year or the year before," Rittman said. "Like
I always tell our team, we'll get a scouting report
and we'll watch some games, but the biggest
thing we need to do is worry about ourselves and
get ourselves prepared to play."
The Cardinal start the Invitational this after
noon against Miami (Ohio) at 1 p.m. The Red
hawks (12-8) went 3-2 at last weekend's Buzz
Classic, earning first baseman Halle Popson
MAC East Player of the Week honors. Pitcher
Courtney Salmon (6-5,3.43 ERA) tallied a win
;nMI a pair of losses last weekend.
Later on Friday, Stanford will take on a Wis
consin squad (4-6) which also finished the Buzz
Classic with three wins. Samantha Polito leads
the Badgers' offense with 13 homers and.3B2 hit
ting. Pitcher Eden Brock (3-3) has an ERA of
2.37 in 38 innings of work this season.
The Cardinal return to the field Saturday af
ternoon against Middle Tennessee State (6-14-
1). Despite the Blue Raiders' 1-5 finish at the
Frost Classic, Muriel Ledbetter earned Sun Belt
Player of the Week honors last week. She spear

heads the Middle Tennessee offense with a .340
batting average, five home runs and nine RBI.
Ace Laura Moore (4-8, 4.41 ERA) leads the
pitching staff with 42 strikeouts.
Stanford will then face BYU (14-5) and
MWC player of the week Ashlyn Russell (.343
batting, 12 RBI).
"BYU was one strike away from beating Cal
in the Regional last year in Fresno," Rittman
said. "They are a very good program with good
pitching and good hitting."
The Cougars notched four wins at Texas
A&M's tournament last weekend, including a
20-0 five-inning rout ofTexas Southern in which
Summer Tobias (7-3,2.02 ERA) tossed a no-hit
ter.
The Cardinal will close out the tournament
Sunday against familiar foe Pacific (8-8).
"UOP is something of a rival school with us,"
Rittman said. "They play us tough every time we
step on the field with them."
The Tigers most recently split a double-head
er with San Jose State early last week. Gina Car
bonotto's .490 batting average leads the batters,
and pitcher Briana Santos paces the staff with a
0.51 ERA.
With temperatures projected in the low 50s
through the weekend and a significant chance of
thunderstorms, the Cardinal may get as much
trouble from the weather as from their oppo
nents. But as always, they plan to take it all in
stride.
"February was looking so nice," Rittman said.
"But this is pretty normal for us. It's colder than
what we're used to, but the rain comes and goes
this time of year. You have to be ready to play in
all the elements. 1 remember in 2(XK) we went to
Michigan for Regionals and played in thirty-de
gree weather in May. So it could always be
worse."

Third baseman Michelle Smith has been connecting well in the preseason. The sophomore, who
set a new Stanford home run record last year, leads the team in doubles and ranks third in RBI.
