Despite a light rain that forced No. 5 Stan
ford softball to finish Wednesday's batting
practice in jackets, the squad seemed unfazed.
It's March in the Bay Area, and that means
cloudy skies, cold weather and preseason soft
ball.
In one of their final tune-ups before Pac-10
play begins, the Cardinal (17-4) will host the
Stanford Invitational II this weekend, where
they will see both familiar local rivals and new
faces. And while the team continues to work
out the kinks, it is still looking to close out the
preseason on a high note.
After struggling at last weekend's Worth
Classic, where they dropped a game to UC-
Santa Barbara and barely pulled out wins over
No. 16 Northwestern and host Cal State-
Fullerton, the Cardinal are focusing on
preparing for the tough conference schedule
that kicks off at the end of the month.
"We had a game where we didn't show up

and play our best, so hopefully that will be a
learning experience that we can draw from,"
said head coach John Rittman of the UCSB
loss. "Santa Barbara played a really good
game, and we just need to realize that there is
a target on our backs and that we need to be
prepared to play every time we go on the
field."
Despite last weekend's lapses, the Cardinal
have, on the whole, gotten off to a strong start.
ITiey have been beat only by UCSB, No. IS
Baylor and No. 2 Texas, twice.
"We have learned some valuable lessons in
the 21 games that we have played, and I really
am pleased with the way the team is playing,"
Rittman said. "Ilie biggest thing is just keep
ing our focus and trying to improve daily."
The soggy fields have limited what the
team can do in practice, but they have used the
opportunity to work on fundamentals
"[Sophomore pitcher Lauren] Nydam and
[senior pitcher Laura] Severson got to throw
some innings in the cage â€” they got to see the
hitters, and the hitters got to see some live

pitching, which is important to do." Rittman
said. "When you are playing a lot of games in a
weekend this time of year, during the week
you just try to stay sharp and make adjust
ments"
And while there have been a few missteps
in the batters' box and in the field, the Cardi
nal have swept through much of their presea
son.
Senior centerfielder Catalina Morris and
freshman shortstop Maddy Coon have been
swinging hot bats all season and show no signs
of letting up. Morris leads the Cardinal in bat
ting average (.386), hits (27) and triples (3),
while Coon has team-high marks in runs (18),
homeruns (8). RBI (25) and slugging percent
age (.779).
While Coon has been getting it done at the
plate, her classmate Missy Penna has been
doing her part in the circle. Penna has already
amassed a 10-2 record and pitched four com
plete games,striking out 88 batters in only 77.1
