he probably wasn't talking about the
Stanford women's golf team. But he
could have been.
'ITte No. 15 Cardinal traveled to Mex
ico looking to put forth a strong effort in
the Cal-Guadalajara Invitational, but
instead finished next-to-last in the
eleven-team field.

"I ordered a milkshake, and got tea,"
junior Lauren Todd said. Todd was
speaking of the miscommunication and
service in Guadalajara, hut for the Car
dinal, it was just that type of week.
No. 3 UCLA took the overall team
victory, finishing with an even-par 864.
The Bruins featured three of the top
five finishers in the tournament, includ
ing freshman Jane Park, who paced her
squad and finished second overall with
a 3-undcr 213.
USC senior Irene Cho took the in
dividual title, shattering USC's 54-
hole record with a 13-under 203, a
massive ten-stroke margin of victory.
