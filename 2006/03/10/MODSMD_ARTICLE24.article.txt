## Strife south of the border Stanford 10th of 11 at Guadalajara Tourney, top finishers tie for 31st 
### BY CARSON COOPER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When Mick Jagger once lamented,
"You can't always get what you want,"
he probably wasn't talking about the
Stanford women's golf team. But he
could have been.
'ITte No. 15 Cardinal traveled to Mex
ico looking to put forth a strong effort in
the Cal-Guadalajara Invitational, but
instead finished next-to-last in the
eleven-team field.

"I ordered a milkshake, and got tea,"
junior Lauren Todd said. Todd was
speaking of the miscommunication and
service in Guadalajara, hut for the Car
dinal, it was just that type of week.
No. 3 UCLA took the overall team
victory, finishing with an even-par 864.
The Bruins featured three of the top
five finishers in the tournament, includ
ing freshman Jane Park, who paced her
squad and finished second overall with
a 3-undcr 213.
USC senior Irene Cho took the in
dividual title, shattering USC's 54-
hole record with a 13-under 203, a
massive ten-stroke margin of victory.
She also set the USC single-round
record by shooting an 8-under 64 on
TUesday.

Senior Kelly Husted placed 54th in Mexico, where the entire Cardinal
squad struggled on and off the links. Conference foes UCLA and USC had
no such trouble in the final tune-up before the Pac-10 Championships.
Todd and freshman Mari Chun
led Stanford. They each shot a 228,
and tied for 31st overall.
"I was happy with my hall-strik
ing and consistency,"Todd said. "My
game is in a good spot."
Head coach Caroline O'Connor,
however, was disappointed with the
team's play in a tournament featur
ing seven Pac-10 teams.
"We definitely performed below
expectations, both mine and the
team's," O'Connor said. "We just
had a bad week."
Perhaps the worst came on Tues
day, the second day of the tourna
ment. Then, the team combined to
shoot a 319, ten more than the next
worst team.
"The thing that really hurt us the
most was that all five players had off

days on Tuesday," O'Connor said.
Junior Jennifer Tangtiphaiboon
tana finished 47th with a 237, while
teammate Stephanie Lue carded a
238, tying for 50th place. Kelly
Husted placed 54th with a 244.
The tournament was an unusual
one for Stanford, who traveled to
Guadalajara in central Mexico for
the Cal-hosted tournament. Never
theless, the team said that playing in
the industrialized city of two-million
had little effect on them.
"Flaying in Mexico had nothing
to do with the performance," O'Con
nor said. "Our decision-making and
shot selection were lacking the
sharpness that is characteristic of
this team."
"When we were on the course, we
had no idea we were in Mexico,"
Todd added.
The Card returns to action March
31,f0r the ASU PING Invitational in
Tempe, Ariz., in preparation for the
Pac-10 Tournament, which starts on
April 24.
