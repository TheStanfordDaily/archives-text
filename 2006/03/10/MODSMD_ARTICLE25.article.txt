## SOS: Educational success is a mess Panel addresses the need to healthily redefine educational success 
### COURTNEY WEAVER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While I HUM essays and dorm
meetings may seem slightly less over
whelming than AF courses and
SATs, Stressed Out Students (SOS),
a research group started by School of
Education lecturer Denise Pope, be
lieves an overemphasis on academic
achievement persists at the college
level — a problem that may lead to
the sacrifice of academic integrity.
Pope, author of "Doing School:
How We are Creating a Generation
of Stressed Out. Materialistic and
Miseducated Students," teamed up
with Vaden psychologist Doug
Daher to found the interdisciplinary
group four years ago. Enlisting the
help of departments ranging from
the Office of Judicial Affairs to the
Office for Religious Life and the
Haas Center for Public Service, the
group has worked to redefine educa
tional success through an annual
conference that will take place May
12 and 13.
According to Senior Associate
Dean for Religious Life Rabbi Patri
cia Karlin-Neumann, SOS deals with
many of the same issues as her office.
"As both a parent of high school
students and a clergy person trying to
inculcate some 'counter cultural' val
ues, I saw how toxic the values of elit
ism when applied to education had
become,"she said."! think religion is
an alternative set of definitions of
success — more concerned with re
lationships than with finances, more
apt to see people fully than through
their resume or college application."
This year's third-annual, two-day
conference will welcome middle
school and high school teams consist
ing of parents, teachers, counselors
and students. Each team will work
with a coach to formulate plans to
combat their students' academic is
sues, and will return for a follow-up
conference in November to evaluate
its progress.
According to Marcela Muniz, a
former coach and third-year doctor
al student at the School of Educa
tion. the coach's role is to "provide
guidance to the teams as they imple
ment strategies to reduce student
stress and to improve student health,
engagement and integrity in their re
spective school communities."
The conference will feature
speakers such as Pope, as well as col
lege, high-school and middle-school
students.
"It was crazy to do this without
the students," Pope said. "We also

needed to have parents and teachers
and administrators working together
to solve this problem at the same
table."
According to Pope, part of the
blame may lie with the parents them
selves.
"A lot of these kids are over
scheduled outside of school, and
their parents don't understand that
they're actually contributing to [the
problem of stress]," she said.
She also noted that student
teacher relationships play a signifi
cant role in finding a solution.
"If students think their teachers
know them and care about them,
they are less likely to fall through the
cracks," Pope said.
In addition to focusing on issues
of time management, homework and
curriculum instruction and assess
ment, the conference will also touch
on the connection between academ
ic stress and cheating.
According to Pope, 75 percent of
high-school students admit to cheat
ing on a test, and 90 percent admit to
having copied another student's
homework. These statistics are even
higher among honor students and
students from the local area — of
whom 90 percent have cheated and
almost 100 percent have copied
homework.
"The students know that [cheat
ing] is wrong but they're so desperate
at that point, they feel that they have
to in order to please their parents or
themselves or their teachers," Pope
said. "This pressure to be the best
and be perfect is actually causing
kids to cheat."
She also noted that this pressure
continues to exist in college as well.
"You work, work, work to get into
Stanford for this idea that you can
have a life, and then you get to Stan
ford and realize people are still play
ing the same games they played in
high school."
Muniz agreed.
"Many college students feel com
pelled to live up to the high expecta
tions that they have placed on them
selves and that their families have
placed upon them," she said. "And
these expectations can in turn gener
ate a great deal of stress."
For these reasons, SOS has begun
to address issues of stress in student
life at the college level. Pope has al
ready helped organize a November
presentation for freshmen and has
met with Vice Provost of Student Af
fairs Greg Boardman to discuss pos
sibilities.
"I'm optimistic because we've
been having these meetings and the
administration is listening," she said,
noting that the conference itself
could benefit Stanford students
through encouraging their self-re
flection or through promoting
change at their high schools.
Junior Anh Pham, the college
student speaker at last year's confer
ence, agreed.
"I think the conference can be
very beneficial for college students
who are handling a lot of stress just
because it creates the opportunity
for discussion, the opportunit> to
share similar experiences and the
opportunity to talk to people who
are in the same boat," he said.
Muniz sees Stanford as the per
fect forum for such dialogue.
"It is imperative for places like
Stanford to facilitate dialogue on is
sues of student stress because many
perceive the admission process for
highly selective institutions to be
among the causes of student stress,"
she said. "At Stanford, we have a
unique opportunity to bring differ
ent communities and stakeholders
to the table."
