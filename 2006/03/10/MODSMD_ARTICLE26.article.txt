## Democracy races nukes in Iran 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
"The only way to solve Iran's nuclear problem is to
bring democracy to Iran ," declared Abbas Milani of
the Hoover Institution last night in a dialogue entitled
"Iran's Nuclear Program: Past, Present, Future."
The event, held at the Bechtel International Cen
ter, was co-hosted by the Coalition for Justice in the
Middle East (CJME) and the Roosevelt Institution.
Milani, who worked and taught in Iran until 1987,
currently serves as the director of the Iranian Studies
Program at Stanford and as co-director of the Iran
Democracy Project at the Hoover Institution.
The Iranian nuclear program has lately garnered
international attention, as the United Nations Securi
ty Council will meet next week to consider possible
action against the program. A resolution will likely be
passed directing Iran to cooperate with the Interna
tional Atomic Energy Agency (lAEA).
With the Iran issue at the forefront of internation
al consciousness, organizers stressed the timeliness of
the dialogue.
"CJME agreed that it was important for us to pro
mote awareness and dialogue about the Iranian nu
clear program, which has profound regional and in
ternational security implications," junior Olivia
Sohns, co-president of CJME, said.
Milani began by outlining the history of the nu
clear program in Iran, from its birth in 1959 through
the 1979 Iranian revolution and its implementation in
the 1980&
Discussed at length was the current Iranian
regime, which Milani asserted has been "successful in
pitching [its nuclear program] as a David and Goliath
situation."
"We have to distinguish between Iran and this
regime," Milani said. "I think this is a very despotic
regime, but I think a democratic Iran should have the
right to a nuclear program."
"This regime, so long as they're in power, will be
dedicated to getting the bomb because they see it as
essentially their insurance for survival domestically,"
he continued, describing the regime as clever in its
ability to "create controlled chaos."
Milani also spoke for the need for democracy from
within Iran, expressing the belief that "having the
bomb will prolong the regime's power for many
years."

However, he also outlined positive signs for Iran,
such as its indigenous democratic movements and its
developed civil society.
Milani used a metaphor of "two clocks ticking: the
nuclear clock and the democratic clock."
"I think the nuclear clock has stopped ticking alto
gether; there's very little that can be done with that,"
he said. "So the United States instead should try to
help — help, not deliver — the democratic move
ment in Iran."
According to Milani, this democratization must
occur in a non-intrusive manner.
"It has to be clear that Iran is deciding its own fu
ture," he said.
Milani also emphasized the timeliness of the issue.
"There is a point of no return that is going to come
soon," he said. "If they master this full cycle of tech
nology, it might take them another four, five years, for
example, to purify uranium to the extent that they
need it to get the bomb, but by then they will have
learned all that they need to know to master the
bomb."
"I think the way they have gone about it has basi
cally allowed the regime to play both the people of
Iran and the people around the world."
Students spoke positively about the talk.
"I didn't know much about the issue," admitted
freshman Sarah Woodward, "but I found the way he
presented it really useful to me."
"He knows his stuff," agreed Ben Goldsmith, pres
ident of the Roosevelt Institution. "It's always fun to
get these experts here to talk about issues like this."
First-year law student Mahbod Moghadam de
scribed Milani as "very moderate" in his political
views as well as "absolutely brilliant as a speaker."
Organizers of the event were pleased with its re
sult.
Junior Ann Walker, co-vice president of CJME,
highlighted the importance of the issue.
"Many students either know very little about
Iran's [nuclear] program or do not completely under
stand the issue and its implications for national and
global security," she said.
Sohns agreed.
"Iran is one of the most complex and fascinating
countries in the region and we must strive to better
understand it," she said. "It is vital for us, as Ameri
cans, to inform ourselves about Iran and the history of
our country's relationship to it."
