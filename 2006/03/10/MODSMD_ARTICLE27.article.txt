## Greek groups reinstitute Order of Omega The 						Greek national honor society to be revived after its 1990s flop 
### AMIT ARORA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Although fraternity and sorority recruitment
is not scheduled to begin until spring quarter,
Greek organizations on campus have been ac
tive on another front.The Intersorority Council
(ISC) and the Interfraternity Council (IFC)
have successfully pushed for the re-chartering of
the Order of Omega, a national Greek honor so
ciety.
After collapsing in the early 1990s due to a

lack of cohesion and support among Greek or
ganizations, the Order of Omega is reemerging
on campus. The society received almost 50 stu
dent applications from members of the ISC and
IFC. as well as the African American Fraternal
and Sororal Association (AAFSA) and the Mul
ticultural Greek Council (MGC).
Initiated in 1959 at the University of Miami,
the Order of Omega was created to recognize
fraternal leadership and service.The honor soci
ety also provided an academic forum for Greek
organizations and — following its inception —
expanded to more than 300 colleges and univer
sities nationwide.
At Stanford, the ISC and IFC have been
proactive in reinstating the Order of Omega's

Kappa Mu Chapter. ISC Vice President Sofie
Leon, a senior, described efforts to increase pub
licity for the society.
"The ISC has taken the lead in reestablishing
Order of Omega at Stanford, but has had signif
icant involvement from IFC, as well as participa
tion from MGC and AAFSA," she said. "The
ISC has and will continue to promote Order of
Omega through print and electronic advertising.
Within these organizations, there has also been
active promotion at chapter meetings to encour
age members of individual fraternities and
sororities to apply."
In an interview with Ilie Daily, Leon outlined
the requirements for acceptance
into the society.
"At Stanford, the Kappa Mu
Chapter will select members who
have a GPA above the all-Greek
CPA (currently 3.55), and exhibit
leadership and community service,"
she said. "The purpose of Order of
Omega is to recognize those who
have attained a high standard of
scholarship, leadership in inter-fra
ternal activities and service to Stan
ford University and its communi
ties. Selection for membership is de
termined by academic success, char
acter and leadership within the
communities."
Open only to juniors and seniors,
the society looks to attract dedicat
ed members of fraternity and soror
ity organizations. While applications
are no longer being accepted for the
Order, Leon stressed the impor
tance of an academic focus in the so

ciety and in Greek life in general.
"We hope to ensure the Kappa
Mu chapter becomes a central point
for Greek leaders to unite and help
the Stanford community," she said.
"The Greek organizations at Stan
ford are filled with talented people
who are smart and dynamic. We
want to emphasize that positive
image of the Greeks at Stanford,
and we want to include AAFSA,
MGC, IFC and ISC in that effort."
Currently, there are 27 Greek or
ganizations on campus including 16
fraternities and 11 sororities. Ac
cording to the Office of Student Ac
tivities, 13 percent of all undergrad
uates are members of Greek organ
izations.
Leon described the potential of
the Order of Omega to unite frater
nity and sorority members.
"Order of Omega will encourage
communication and collaboration

within these groups and help pro
mote the image of fraternities and
sororities as academic and service
oriented communities," she said.
Student response to the Order of
Omega has been positive. Although
first-year students are not eligible
for participation in the society,
some, such as freshman James
Vaughan, described their enthusi
asm and prospective involvement in
the organization.
"The reputation that fraternities
hold tends to discourage participa
tion by more moderate students,"
Vaughan said. "When considering a
fraternity, 1 was worried that the ac
ademic focus of Stanford might be
mitigated by the social activities of
fraternities. The existence of a na
tional Greek honor society allevi
ates some of my doubts and makes
me more enthusiastic about frater
nities as a whole."
