						Greek national honor society to be revived after its 1990s flop 
### AMIT ARORA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Although fraternity and sorority recruitment
is not scheduled to begin until spring quarter,
Greek organizations on campus have been ac
tive on another front.The Intersorority Council
(ISC) and the Interfraternity Council (IFC)
have successfully pushed for the re-chartering of
the Order of Omega, a national Greek honor so

After collapsing in the early 1990s due to a

lack of cohesion and support among Greek or
ganizations, the Order of Omega is reemerging
on campus. The society received almost 50 stu
dent applications from members of the ISC and
IFC. as well as the African American Fraternal
and Sororal Association (AAFSA) and the Mul
ticultural Greek Council (MGC).
Initiated in 1959 at the University of Miami,
the Order of Omega was created to recognize
fraternal leadership and service.The honor soci
ety also provided an academic forum for Greek
organizations and — following its inception —
expanded to more than 300 colleges and univer
sities nationwide.
At Stanford, the ISC and IFC have been
proactive in reinstating the Order of Omega's

Kappa Mu Chapter. ISC Vice President Sofie
Leon, a senior, described efforts to increase pub

"The ISC has taken the lead in reestablishing
Order of Omega at Stanford, but has had signif

ISC has and will continue to promote Order of
Omega through print and electronic advertising.
Within these organizations, there has also been
active promotion at chapter meetings to encour
age members of individual fraternities and
sororities to apply."
