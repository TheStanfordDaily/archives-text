Wiggins one of 12 Wade Finalists
Sophomore guard and Pac-10 Player of the
Year Candice Wiggins was announced as a fi
nalist for the 2006 State Farm Wade Trophy
yesterday.
The 12 finalists include seven seniors, two
juniors and three sophomores. LSU senior Sei
mone Augustus, last year's winner, heads the
list.
Wiggins, who won her second straight con
ference award last week, has led the Cardinal
to the Pac-10 regular season title and the Pac
-10 Tournament Finals, and looks to make a run
deep into the NCAA Tournament, starting
next Saturday or Sunday.
With 21.7 points per game, Wiggins is the
third-highest scorer in the country. She has

scored over 30 points four times this season
and, though just a true sophomore, is already in
the Stanford top-20 in scoring.
The award is given by State Farm, the
Women's Basketball Coaches Association
(WBCA) and the National Association for
Girls and Women in Sport (N AGWS) to recog
nize a player who makes significant contribu
tions to her school "both on and off the court,"
according to WBCA CEO Beth Bass.
The winner of the Wade Trophy will be an
nounced in a press conference April 1.
Tennis rolls over William & Mary
A combination of classes, dreary weather
and the telecast of the men's basketball game
conspired to keep turnout low for the No. 1
women's tennis match against William and
Mary yesterday afternoon at Taube Family
Tennis Stadium.
But those who came out saw Stanford dom

inate an overmatched opponent, sweeping the
doubles matches, and nearly pulling the same
feat in singles against No. 20 William & Mary
for a 6-1 victory.
In singles. No. 15 senior Amber Liu lost at
the No. 1 slot to William & Mary's No. 30
Megan Moulton-Levy 7-6 (3), 4-6,1 -0 (10-6).
Stanford won the other five singles matches.
Of those five, the Card won three in two sets,
with sophomore Whitney Deason's 6-0, 6-0
sweep of Lingda Yang highlighting the after
noon.
Stanford swept doubles, with the No. 1, No.
2 and No. 3 tandems of senior Alice Barnes and
junior Anne Yelsey, sophomore Celia Durkin
and senior Amber Liu, and sophomore Lejla
Hodzic and freshman Jessica Nguyen winning
8-6,8-4 and 8-1, respectively.
