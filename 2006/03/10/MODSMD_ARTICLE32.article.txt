INTERMISSION: So, ain 1 talking to Bob Saget?
808 SACJE'E If it's an imposter, I'm going to sue his ass.
I'm driving, so if I lose you I'll call you back. I'm driving
to my recording for the movie I'm directing.
INT: Let's start there. Could you tell me about the movie
you're off to direct?
BS:I ve been working for months on this movie that's a
takeoff of "March of the Penguins."
It's called "Farce of the Penguins," right?
BS: Yes, not "Farts of the Penguins." It's an R-rated
movie that's made out of 80 hours of penguin footage
that we got licensed outside 0f... it's not the other movie
that just won the Oscar. It's crazy what's happening.The
main cast is me (I play Carl the penguin),TVacy Morgan,
who plays Marcus, a well-endowed penguin — which
we're doing with computer generated effects. Lewis
Black is my best friend, Jimmy, who has a really dirty
mouth. The people who are providing guest voices are
Jamie Kennedy. John Stamos,Dave Coulier.John Lovitz,
Norm McDonald. Jason Alexander, Allison Hannigan
and Jason Biggs.
INT: That sounds hilarious, but I wanted to address a
concern of mine. I grew up with the image of Bob Saget
as this wholesome family entertainer. It's only been re
cently that I've discovered this whole other side to your
work.
BS:That's true. I did an HBO special while "Full House"
and "America's Funniest Home Videos" were in the top
10 and I dropped the F-bomb all over and I talked about

more like my comedy.
INT;: Have you had trouble shaking that crystal-clean
image of Danny Tanner (from "Full House")?
BS: I don't really think so. It wasn't shaking the image, it
was me coming up with material that...you can't just
stand around and bitch as an actor that people don't
know the real you. I always loved my stand-up because I

BS: Well, the Aristocrats is the dirtiest joke I know and I
don't tell jokes on interviews or anywhere. I never tell a
joke if someone asks me to tell one because then I 'm per
forming for them and then I'm their bitch. And I am no
body's bitch. I'll tell a joke if I feel like it and that's usu
ally most of the time.
INT: Ummm. alright.

was always able to kick ass with it just because I knew
how to do it. But hey, Robin Williams goes off and
„ J 4-1 un II nL

BS: People say "Yeah, say something funny." I just want
to say, "Oh my God, say something classy" I'm not

does "Flubber' and then does "One Hour Photo.
One's a G-rated family goofy movie and the
other's a demented R-rated movie and no
body's says "Why is he doing this dirty thing?
He's supposed to be Mork." But when you do
eight years on a show, people think that you're a
character on that show. Those people don't have
an understanding of Acting 101. It's like, Antho
ny Hopkins doesn't eat people.

that kind of performer and believe it or not. I
look at myself as an artist, which is insane. I
I don't look at myself as a guy who you put a
quarter in and I do a little dance.
INT: Well...okay. Moving on. Since this is a
college publication, is there any crazy col
lege...

INTi Well we don't know about that. He
might.

BS: Oh, you're a college publi
cation?
\ INT: Yeah.

BS: Actually, I was on "Late Night
with Conan O'Brien" one night
and he said he does eat people.

IN'D That's probably the scari
est thing I've ever heard.

BS: I think Danny Tanner
eats people.

INT: Speaking of
which, could you tell
me the dirtiest joke you
know?

BS: Oh, well. In that
case, let me think of

something dirty for
you instead of
L _ L !x-1

being bitchy.
(Pause) Oh
God, it's all so
dirty. Okay, if a
man shaves his
balls and the

the insides of people's bodies and weird crap that proba-

bly wasn't that funny, hut its
still

woman doesn't shave up her (pause) self, that's not fair
because when they're having sex it looks like Castro
smoking a cigar! See, that's not even that dirty! It's just
the imagery of ZZTop smoking a blunt is what it is. I did
n't mean to be bitchy about it. I just get so many people
who say, "Tell me a joke." I don't do it for them. 1 do it be
cause I'm fuckin' delighted to get up on stage and go
nuts.
INTi On the topic of colleges, if you could go back and
change anything, what would it be?
BS: I would get laid. 1 didn't get laid. I had a girlfriend.
I'm lying, I got laid. I ended up marrying her.
INTi Well that's good.
BS: Y'know. it's nice to say you got laid from your girl
friend. People never talk about their wife that way. You
don't hear a guy say, "I had great sex from my wife last
night." Nobody does that because it's gross. If you had it.
you might as well be happy about it. If you had great sex
with somebody else's wife, that's awesome.
INTi (Pause)
BS: I'm just joking. Anyways, here's something you'll
like. I got a music video coming out on MTV in June. It's
called "Rolling with Saget." I recorded this song with
Jamie Kennedy who's filming this new show about be
coming a rapper.
