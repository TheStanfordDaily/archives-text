# Straight from London, Intermission talks to Laurence Dunmore
## 
### SILVIA SANCHEZ INTERMISSION DUNBAR-TON 
Intermission catches Laurence
Dunmore in England (i.e. imagine
this in a British accent) on the cellu
lar and asked him about his first film.
Intermission: How was your first di
recting experience?
Laurence Dunmore: It was a won
derful experience, not without blood,
sweat and tear;, but one I wouldn't
trade for anything. I think conceiving
this movie is somewhat akin to being
a dad, which is my other pursuit that
I am in love with. It was made incred
ible by the factor of having the trust
and respect of some of the most in
credible cast and crew to work with.
That certainly empowered me to re
alize my vision. It allowed me to
make something that transported
everyone to another world which
was mid-17th century England and
the likes of John Wilmot.
INTi Do you have any funny anec
dotes about the filming experience?
LI): Oh gee, that's a tough one. Yes
there are many funny anecdotes, but
it's actually remembering them. I re
member it far more for the good
humor of everybody. I mean in par
ticular how the likes of Johnny
[Depp], Samantha [Morton] and
John [Malkovich] kind of inspired
the other cast and crew with their,
shall we say, good humor and good
nature. I mean, Johnny was always
one for being able to step into the
role and step out of it in a way that
sort of enabled him to finish the film
ing with the crew sort of cracked up
with laughter — even if we had just
filmed something sad a couple min
utes earlier. It was full of a lot of emo
tion in that way, I mean there was one
particular scene, not necessarily a
funny anecdote, where he goes back
home and he's dying and he has an
argument with his wife and it's a very
emotional scene where he's literally
falling apart in front of her and very
angry and very depressed and she
likewise is pleading for him to just be
himself and to live and to stop de
stroying himself in that way. At the
end of it, Johnny leaned over — hav
ing given this incredible perform
ance and tapped me on the side. I was
operating the camera and he just
said, "Breathe" because I'd literally
been holding my breath for the
whole take. Another one with him
doing the dance in the playhouse
with Samantha Morton, I literally
caught lire because I hit the chande
lier with the camera, and to have
Johnny and Samantha pull me out of
the fire was an interesting experi
ence. shall we say.
INT: While filming "Pirates of the
Caribbean," Johnny Depp wanted
gold caps on his teeth, so for lever
age with the directors, he put more
caps on his teeth than he wanted.
Did he pull any stunts like that with
you?
LI): No he didn't. The character of
Rochester was one we had a very col
laborative process on. I mean there
was no need for anybody to be doing

anything other
than the vision
that we had for

the charac
ter and the
film as a
whole.

think we had decided with Peter
Owen, who designed the makeup
and the character's deterioration for
the latter half of the film, on a very
specific timeline and structure and
knowledge of what we were going to
do in terms of Johnny's physical ap
pearance. Obviously, Johnny en
joyed and relished the opportunity
not to be restricted by having to keep
a beautiful face and a beautiful body.
But it was more because of the char
acter and the physical deterioration
of that character that he relished the
part more than the sensational ele
ment of doing something to himself
just to create something.
INTi Johnny Depp said he had want
ed to change people's impression of
John Wilmot. Do you think he
achieved it?
LI): 1 think his performance is one
that has a profound effect on people
one way or another. It elevates
Wiimot into a position of entering
into the minds and thoughts of peo
ple. We wanted to do it for all kinds of
reasons. One, we felt, because of
Rochester and his life, a sense of
modernity. In so many ways, aspects
of his life and writing, and the betray
al of his talents relate to contempo
rary lives. So, 1 think he portrayed a
very complex and deep character
that had a surface that could be
smelled and disliked, seen and dis
liked, but had a depth within him that
really only Johnny, in my mind, could
bring to that character. He allowed
for the question of the possibility of
love and redemption. I hope
Rochester is at least now a more vis
ible character and the recognized
character that he deserved to be. He
was one of the most incredible writ
ers of his time and indeed anytime.
INTi How do you think the Ameri
can public will react to film?
LI): That 1 couldn't say. I'd say that
like any public, they will judge it on
the basis of the film. And, I hope it
will be viewed within the context of
the period, the man's life and the
story that we're trying to tell. I want
people to walk through a couple of
years of mid 17th century English
history. It's the story of a man and
his inner fight, the.relationships be
tween him and the people around [
him and the betrayal of his own abil
ities and talents. So it really, de
pends, if it's taken on ,a,f>ensatHj#al
level, it will have more impact. If it's
taken on the emotional, possibly
sexual level, then it will have anoth
er.
INT: You keep mentioning the be
trayal of his talents, could you ex
plain that a little bit more?
LI): Well Rochester was a man who
in my mind had a genius for his art
and a passion for life. He was some
body who in the reality of his output
and the nature of his work, often
didn't realize to leave for enough
himself, the writer, the full extent of
his abilities. I think he didn't tie his
work to cutting satire and ridicule of
society — especially the court of
Charles 11. His most beautiful work
is enclosed in his poetry and letters
to his wife and his friends. It's a little
bit like seeing somebody with such
incredible ability not fully realizing
it. It's hard for us — not being able
to benefit from his full potential.
INT Did you watch the play when
John Malkovich was in it?
LI): I didn't, I knew of Rochester at
that time but I didn't know about
the play until John and I worked to
gether and he told me about the
play.
INT: Since he was in the play, did he
help you in the development of John
Wilmot's character?
LI): No because luckily for me, back
in its early days Johnny had seen the
play and he knew of Rochester. One
of the things 1 had to bring to the film
was that I wasn't encumbered with a
preconception of what had come be
fore. Neither was Johnny because
when John asked him to originally be
in ihe film and asked him if he could
play the character he said, "Yes, but
not like you did it." Because they
both have such tremendous pres
! ence and power, their interpreta-

tion of the role is so different. I
think John's contribution to the
film was very much as someone
who trusted and believed in the
I vision that 1 — and the rest of the

crew — had. He contributed as
much as he wanted. It was never
, an imposition of his thoughts or
L ideas on the film. He had tried

[or years to make the film him
self and had decided when we
, met that he would pass that
L role on. I benefited from his
■ experience and his contri-

bution immensely but it
wasn't one that was inter-
I fering.

lN'ft How did you and
John Malkovich meet?

LD: We worked together on a com
mercial about 5 years ago. We did a
little film for a train company that
runs between London and Paris and
we worked together for a couple of
days and we got on very well. 1 obvi
ously let it slip that I was desperately
looking to one day be moving away
from commercials and into films and
without forcing the point too much,
said to John that I'd only unlock the
dressing room door when he gave me
a script, which he did. He left after we
worked together and it was a won
derful experience — especially for
me, because working with an actor of
his caliber and abilities is kind of a
dream for a director, especially one
used to working with inanimate ob
jects. So to have that sort of opportu
nity afforded me by working with
John and then for him come through
with a couple of scripts. It was one of
those moments where you suddenly
think, "Okay maybe this dream that
I'd had could become a reality. If he
thinks I can do it, maybe 1 can." It was
a very daunting project — "The Lib
ertine" — because it was not an easy
film. It was still a play when 1 read it.
so it was something that had to devel
op into being a film. It was a complex
film, it was a film with many of the
things that I haven't had the oppor
tunity to do. I mean, work on an in
depth story, with characters, emo
tions and performance.
INT: Was working on a period piece
like that different than you'd envi
sioned?
LI): I wouldn't say a lot different, I
mean each day brought along its own
surprises and different experiences.
When you spend so much time prep
ping a film and dreaming it and get
ting to that point where you first put
the camera on your shoulder and
stand knee deep in mud and smell
the air and choke on the smoke,
you've kind of been there so many
times in dreams. The biggest differ
ence I guess is the thrill that you get
when you hear the film running
through the camera and you see ac
tors delivering the lines in costume
and delivering the character. You get
taken to a place where even dreams
pale into insignificance because
you're transported into a whole
other world.
INT: So is this something that you'd
like to continue doing then?
LI): I would like to, yes —if any
body's willing to give me another go.
I will continue to make select films
and I hope that they will be as varied
as they are similar.
IN'D Do you think you'll get to work
with Johnny Depp or John
Malkovich again?
LI): I would personally pay a lot of
money to work with either again and
even give various limbs. They both
brought an awful lot and I'm sure
that we'll all work again either sepa
rately or together on various proj
ects.
INT: I really liked Rosamund Pike's
portrayal of John's wife. Did you
have a favorite personality like that?
LI): It's interesting because a lot of
the actors were kind of first choice or
first thoughts of either Mary Selway
who cast the film, or myself.
Rosamund was someone who I was
particularly single-minded on be
cause I believed, in the little that I'd
seen of her which included a play
that she was doing at the time, that
there was something within her that
naturally had the access to the char
acter that I was looking for. 1 think
that Rosamund really demonstrated
that enormous talent and ability that
she has. She was not afraid to put up
in front of the likes of Johnny Depp,
who. however warm and empower
ing he is with his contribution, is still
a force that is quite something to be
around and be put with. For me as a
director and for anybody else, he has
this incredible intensity and charis
ma, which carries or aids this talent
that he has.
IN'D So do you have any future work
planned?
LD: 1 have a couple of projects that
I'm working on at the moment one of
which is an adaptation of this book
from the 1950s by J.P. Dunleavy
called "The Gingernian," which will
hopefully happen in the next couple
of years. I am also working on a film
based on the book by Jerry Stahl
called "I, Fatty" about Roscoe Ar
buckle.
Well, thank you very much for
your time.
LD: My pleasure and thank you.
INTi Good luck with your projects
and say hello to Johnny Depp for me
if you get the chance. |
Ll): Haha. I will.

body who in the reality of his output

himself, the writer, the full extent of
his abilities. I think he didn't tie his
work to cutting satire and ridicule of

Charles 11. His most beautiful work
is enclosed in his poetry and letters
to his wife and his friends. It's a little
bit like seeing somebody with such
incredible ability not fully realizing
it. It's hard for us — not being able
to benefit from his full potential.
INT Did you watch the play when
John Malkovich was in it?
LI): I didn't, I knew of Rochester at
that time but I didn't know about
the play until John and I worked to
gether and he told me about the
play.
INT: Since he was in the play, did he
help you in the development of John
Wilmot's character?
LI): No because luckily for me, back
in its early days Johnny had seen the
play and he knew of Rochester. One
of the things 1 had to bring to the film
was that I wasn't encumbered with a
preconception of what had come be
fore. Neither was Johnny because
when John asked him to originally be
in ihe film and asked him if he could
play the character he said, "Yes, but
not like you did it." Because they
both have such tremendous pres
! ence and power, their interpreta-

tion of the role is so different. I
think John's contribution to the
film was very much as someone
who trusted and believed in the
I vision that 1 — and the rest of the

crew — had. He contributed as
much as he wanted. It was never
, an imposition of his thoughts or
L ideas on the film. He had tried

[or years to make the film him
self and had decided when we
, met that he would pass that
L role on. I benefited from his
■ experience and his contri-

bution immensely but it
wasn't one that was inter-
I fering.

lN'ft How did you and
John Malkovich meet?

LD: We worked together on a com
mercial about 5 years ago. We did a
little film for a train company that
runs between London and Paris and
we worked together for a couple of
days and we got on very well. 1 obvi
ously let it slip that I was desperately
looking to one day be moving away
from commercials and into films and
without forcing the point too much,
said to John that I'd only unlock the
dressing room door when he gave me
a script, which he did. He left after we
worked together and it was a won
derful experience — especially for
me, because working with an actor of
his caliber and abilities is kind of a
dream for a director, especially one
used to working with inanimate ob
jects. So to have that sort of opportu
nity afforded me by working with
John and then for him come through
with a couple of scripts. It was one of
those moments where you suddenly
think, "Okay maybe this dream that
I'd had could become a reality. If he
thinks I can do it, maybe 1 can." It was
a very daunting project — "The Lib
ertine" — because it was not an easy
film. It was still a play when 1 read it.
so it was something that had to devel
op into being a film. It was a complex
film, it was a film with many of the
things that I haven't had the oppor
tunity to do. I mean, work on an in
depth story, with characters, emo
tions and performance.
INT: Was working on a period piece
like that different than you'd envi
sioned?
LI): I wouldn't say a lot different, I
mean each day brought along its own
surprises and different experiences.
When you spend so much time prep
ping a film and dreaming it and get
ting to that point where you first put
the camera on your shoulder and
stand knee deep in mud and smell
the air and choke on the smoke,
you've kind of been there so many
times in dreams. The biggest differ
ence I guess is the thrill that you get
when you hear the film running
through the camera and you see ac
tors delivering the lines in costume
and delivering the character. You get
taken to a place where even dreams
pale into insignificance because
you're transported into a whole
other world.
INT: So is this something that you'd
like to continue doing then?
LI): I would like to, yes —if any
body's willing to give me another go.
I will continue to make select films
and I hope that they will be as varied
as they are similar.
IN'D Do you think you'll get to work
with Johnny Depp or John
Malkovich again?
LI): I would personally pay a lot of
money to work with either again and
even give various limbs. They both
brought an awful lot and I'm sure
that we'll all work again either sepa
rately or together on various proj
ects.
INT: I really liked Rosamund Pike's
portrayal of John's wife. Did you
have a favorite personality like that?
LI): It's interesting because a lot of
the actors were kind of first choice or
first thoughts of either Mary Selway
who cast the film, or myself.
Rosamund was someone who I was
particularly single-minded on be
cause I believed, in the little that I'd
seen of her which included a play
that she was doing at the time, that
there was something within her that
naturally had the access to the char
acter that I was looking for. 1 think
that Rosamund really demonstrated
that enormous talent and ability that
she has. She was not afraid to put up
in front of the likes of Johnny Depp,
who. however warm and empower
ing he is with his contribution, is still
a force that is quite something to be
around and be put with. For me as a
director and for anybody else, he has
this incredible intensity and charis
ma, which carries or aids this talent
that he has.
IN'D So do you have any future work
planned?
LD: 1 have a couple of projects that
I'm working on at the moment one of
which is an adaptation of this book
from the 1950s by J.P. Dunleavy
called "The Gingernian," which will
hopefully happen in the next couple
of years. I am also working on a film
based on the book by Jerry Stahl
called "I, Fatty" about Roscoe Ar
buckle.
Well, thank you very much for
your time.
LD: My pleasure and thank you.
INTi Good luck with your projects
and say hello to Johnny Depp for me
if you get the chance. |
Ll): Haha. I will.

Intermission catches Laurence
Dunmore in England (i.e. imagine
this in a British accent) on the cellu
lar and asked him about his first film.
Intermission: How was your first di
recting experience?
Laurence Dunmore: It was a won
derful experience, not without blood,
sweat and tear;, but one I wouldn't
trade for anything. I think conceiving
this movie is somewhat akin to being
a dad, which is my other pursuit that
I am in love with. It was made incred
ible by the factor of having the trust
and respect of some of the most in
credible cast and crew to work with.
That certainly empowered me to re
alize my vision. It allowed me to
make something that transported
everyone to another world which
was mid-17th century England and
the likes of John Wilmot.
INTi Do you have any funny anec
dotes about the filming experience?
LI): Oh gee, that's a tough one. Yes
there are many funny anecdotes, but
it's actually remembering them. I re
member it far more for the good
humor of everybody. I mean in par
ticular how the likes of Johnny
[Depp], Samantha [Morton] and
John [Malkovich] kind of inspired
the other cast and crew with their,
shall we say, good humor and good
nature. I mean, Johnny was always
one for being able to step into the
role and step out of it in a way that
sort of enabled him to finish the film
ing with the crew sort of cracked up
with laughter — even if we had just
filmed something sad a couple min
utes earlier. It was full of a lot of emo
tion in that way, I mean there was one
particular scene, not necessarily a
funny anecdote, where he goes back
home and he's dying and he has an
argument with his wife and it's a very
emotional scene where he's literally
falling apart in front of her and very
angry and very depressed and she
likewise is pleading for him to just be
himself and to live and to stop de
stroying himself in that way. At the
end of it, Johnny leaned over — hav
ing given this incredible perform
ance and tapped me on the side. I was
operating the camera and he just
said, "Breathe" because I'd literally
been holding my breath for the
whole take. Another one with him
doing the dance in the playhouse
with Samantha Morton, I literally
caught lire because I hit the chande
lier with the camera, and to have
Johnny and Samantha pull me out of
the fire was an interesting experi
ence. shall we say.
INT: While filming "Pirates of the
Caribbean," Johnny Depp wanted
gold caps on his teeth, so for lever
age with the directors, he put more
caps on his teeth than he wanted.
Did he pull any stunts like that with
you?
LI): No he didn't. The character of
Rochester was one we had a very col
laborative process on. I mean there
was no need for anybody to be doing

anything other
than the vision
that we had for

the charac
ter and the
film as a
whole.

think we had decided with Peter
Owen, who designed the makeup
and the character's deterioration for
the latter half of the film, on a very
specific timeline and structure and
knowledge of what we were going to
do in terms of Johnny's physical ap
pearance. Obviously, Johnny en
joyed and relished the opportunity
not to be restricted by having to keep
a beautiful face and a beautiful body.
But it was more because of the char
acter and the physical deterioration
of that character that he relished the
part more than the sensational ele
ment of doing something to himself
just to create something.
INTi Johnny Depp said he had want
ed to change people's impression of
John Wilmot. Do you think he
achieved it?
LI): 1 think his performance is one
that has a profound effect on people
one way or another. It elevates
Wiimot into a position of entering
into the minds and thoughts of peo
ple. We wanted to do it for all kinds of
reasons. One, we felt, because of
Rochester and his life, a sense of
modernity. In so many ways, aspects
of his life and writing, and the betray
al of his talents relate to contempo
rary lives. So, 1 think he portrayed a
very complex and deep character
that had a surface that could be
smelled and disliked, seen and dis
liked, but had a depth within him that
really only Johnny, in my mind, could
bring to that character. He allowed
for the question of the possibility of
love and redemption. I hope
Rochester is at least now a more vis
ible character and the recognized
character that he deserved to be. He
was one of the most incredible writ
ers of his time and indeed anytime.
INTi How do you think the Ameri
can public will react to film?
LI): That 1 couldn't say. I'd say that
like any public, they will judge it on
the basis of the film. And, I hope it
will be viewed within the context of
the period, the man's life and the
story that we're trying to tell. I want
people to walk through a couple of
years of mid 17th century English
history. It's the story of a man and
his inner fight, the.relationships be
tween him and the people around [
him and the betrayal of his own abil
ities and talents. So it really, de
pends, if it's taken on ,a,f>ensatHj#al
level, it will have more impact. If it's
taken on the emotional, possibly
sexual level, then it will have anoth
er.
INT: You keep mentioning the be
trayal of his talents, could you ex
plain that a little bit more?
LI): Well Rochester was a man who
in my mind had a genius for his art
and a passion for life. He was some
body who in the reality of his output
and the nature of his work, often
didn't realize to leave for enough
himself, the writer, the full extent of
his abilities. I think he didn't tie his
work to cutting satire and ridicule of
society — especially the court of
Charles 11. His most beautiful work
is enclosed in his poetry and letters
to his wife and his friends. It's a little
bit like seeing somebody with such
incredible ability not fully realizing
it. It's hard for us — not being able
to benefit from his full potential.

called "I, Fatty" about Roscoe Ar
buckle.
Well, thank you very much for
your time.
LD: My pleasure and thank you.
INTi Good luck with your projects
and say hello to Johnny Depp for me
if you get the chance. |
Ll): Haha. I will.

Intermission catches Laurence
Dunmore in England (i.e. imagine
this in a British accent) on the cellu
lar and asked him about his first film.
Intermission: How was your first di
recting experience?
Laurence Dunmore: It was a won
derful experience, not without blood,
sweat and tear;, but one I wouldn't
trade for anything. I think conceiving
this movie is somewhat akin to being
a dad, which is my other pursuit that
I am in love with. It was made incred
ible by the factor of having the trust
and respect of some of the most in
credible cast and crew to work with.
That certainly empowered me to re
alize my vision. It allowed me to
make something that transported
everyone to another world which
was mid-17th century England and
the likes of John Wilmot.
INTi Do you have any funny anec
dotes about the filming experience?
LI): Oh gee, that's a tough one. Yes
there are many funny anecdotes, but
it's actually remembering them. I re
member it far more for the good
humor of everybody. I mean in par
ticular how the likes of Johnny
[Depp], Samantha [Morton] and
John [Malkovich] kind of inspired
the other cast and crew with their,
shall we say, good humor and good
nature. I mean, Johnny was always
one for being able to step into the
role and step out of it in a way that
sort of enabled him to finish the film
ing with the crew sort of cracked up
with laughter — even if we had just
filmed something sad a couple min
utes earlier. It was full of a lot of emo
tion in that way, I mean there was one
particular scene, not necessarily a
funny anecdote, where he goes back
home and he's dying and he has an
argument with his wife and it's a very
emotional scene where he's literally
falling apart in front of her and very
angry and very depressed and she
likewise is pleading for him to just be
himself and to live and to stop de
stroying himself in that way. At the
end of it, Johnny leaned over — hav
ing given this incredible perform
ance and tapped me on the side. I was
operating the camera and he just
said, "Breathe" because I'd literally
been holding my breath for the
whole take. Another one with him
doing the dance in the playhouse
with Samantha Morton, I literally
caught lire because I hit the chande
lier with the camera, and to have
Johnny and Samantha pull me out of
the fire was an interesting experi
ence. shall we say.
INT: While filming "Pirates of the
Caribbean," Johnny Depp wanted
gold caps on his teeth, so for lever
age with the directors, he put more
caps on his teeth than he wanted.
Did he pull any stunts like that with
you?
LI): No he didn't. The character of
Rochester was one we had a very col
laborative process on. I mean there
was no need for anybody to be doing

anything other
than the vision
that we had for

the charac
ter and the
film as a
whole.

think we had decided with Peter
Owen, who designed the makeup
and the character's deterioration for
the latter half of the film, on a very
specific timeline and structure and
knowledge of what we were going to
do in terms of Johnny's physical ap
pearance. Obviously, Johnny en
joyed and relished the opportunity
not to be restricted by having to keep
a beautiful face and a beautiful body.
But it was more because of the char
acter and the physical deterioration
of that character that he relished the
part more than the sensational ele
ment of doing something to himself
just to create something.
INTi Johnny Depp said he had want
ed to change people's impression of
John Wilmot. Do you think he
achieved it?
LI): 1 think his performance is one
that has a profound effect on people
one way or another. It elevates
Wiimot into a position of entering
into the minds and thoughts of peo
ple. We wanted to do it for all kinds of
reasons. One, we felt, because of
Rochester and his life, a sense of
modernity. In so many ways, aspects
of his life and writing, and the betray
al of his talents relate to contempo
rary lives. So, 1 think he portrayed a
very complex and deep character
that had a surface that could be
smelled and disliked, seen and dis
liked, but had a depth within him that
really only Johnny, in my mind, could
bring to that character. He allowed
for the question of the possibility of
love and redemption. I hope
Rochester is at least now a more vis
ible character and the recognized
character that he deserved to be. He
was one of the most incredible writ
ers of his time and indeed anytime.
INTi How do you think the Ameri
can public will react to film?
LI): That 1 couldn't say. I'd say that
like any public, they will judge it on
the basis of the film. And, I hope it
will be viewed within the context of
the period, the man's life and the
story that we're trying to tell. I want
people to walk through a couple of
years of mid 17th century English
history. It's the story of a man and
his inner fight, the.relationships be
tween him and the people around [
him and the betrayal of his own abil
ities and talents. So it really, de
pends, if it's taken on ,a,f>ensatHj#al
level, it will have more impact. If it's
taken on the emotional, possibly
sexual level, then it will have anoth
er.
INT: You keep mentioning the be
trayal of his talents, could you ex
plain that a little bit more?
LI): Well Rochester was a man who
in my mind had a genius for his art
and a passion for life. He was some
body who in the reality of his output
and the nature of his work, often
didn't realize to leave for enough
himself, the writer, the full extent of
his abilities. I think he didn't tie his
work to cutting satire and ridicule of
society — especially the court of
Charles 11. His most beautiful work
is enclosed in his poetry and letters
to his wife and his friends. It's a little
bit like seeing somebody with such
incredible ability not fully realizing
it. It's hard for us — not being able
to benefit from his full potential.
INT Did you watch the play when
John Malkovich was in it?
LI): I didn't, I knew of Rochester at
that time but I didn't know about
the play until John and I worked to
gether and he told me about the
play.
INT: Since he was in the play, did he
help you in the development of John
Wilmot's character?
LI): No because luckily for me, back
in its early days Johnny had seen the
play and he knew of Rochester. One
of the things 1 had to bring to the film
was that I wasn't encumbered with a
preconception of what had come be
fore. Neither was Johnny because
when John asked him to originally be
in ihe film and asked him if he could
play the character he said, "Yes, but
not like you did it." Because they
both have such tremendous pres
! ence and power, their interpreta-

tion of the role is so different. I
think John's contribution to the
film was very much as someone
who trusted and believed in the
I vision that 1 — and the rest of the

crew — had. He contributed as
much as he wanted. It was never
, an imposition of his thoughts or
L ideas on the film. He had tried

[or years to make the film him
self and had decided when we
, met that he would pass that
L role on. I benefited from his
■ experience and his contri-

bution immensely but it
wasn't one that was inter-
I fering.

lN'ft How did you and
John Malkovich meet?

LD: We worked together on a com
mercial about 5 years ago. We did a
little film for a train company that
runs between London and Paris and
we worked together for a couple of
days and we got on very well. 1 obvi
ously let it slip that I was desperately
looking to one day be moving away
from commercials and into films and
without forcing the point too much,
said to John that I'd only unlock the
dressing room door when he gave me
a script, which he did. He left after we
worked together and it was a won
derful experience — especially for
me, because working with an actor of
his caliber and abilities is kind of a
dream for a director, especially one
used to working with inanimate ob
jects. So to have that sort of opportu
nity afforded me by working with
John and then for him come through
with a couple of scripts. It was one of
those moments where you suddenly
think, "Okay maybe this dream that
I'd had could become a reality. If he
thinks I can do it, maybe 1 can." It was
a very daunting project — "The Lib
ertine" — because it was not an easy
film. It was still a play when 1 read it.
so it was something that had to devel
op into being a film. It was a complex
film, it was a film with many of the
things that I haven't had the oppor
tunity to do. I mean, work on an in
depth story, with characters, emo
tions and performance.
INT: Was working on a period piece
like that different than you'd envi
sioned?
LI): I wouldn't say a lot different, I
mean each day brought along its own
surprises and different experiences.
When you spend so much time prep
ping a film and dreaming it and get
ting to that point where you first put
the camera on your shoulder and
stand knee deep in mud and smell
the air and choke on the smoke,
you've kind of been there so many
times in dreams. The biggest differ
ence I guess is the thrill that you get
when you hear the film running
through the camera and you see ac
tors delivering the lines in costume
and delivering the character. You get
taken to a place where even dreams
pale into insignificance because
you're transported into a whole
other world.
INT: So is this something that you'd
like to continue doing then?
LI): I would like to, yes —if any
body's willing to give me another go.
I will continue to make select films
and I hope that they will be as varied
as they are similar.
IN'D Do you think you'll get to work
with Johnny Depp or John
Malkovich again?
LI): I would personally pay a lot of
money to work with either again and
even give various limbs. They both
brought an awful lot and I'm sure
that we'll all work again either sepa
rately or together on various proj
ects.
INT: I really liked Rosamund Pike's
portrayal of John's wife. Did you
have a favorite personality like that?
LI): It's interesting because a lot of
the actors were kind of first choice or
first thoughts of either Mary Selway
who cast the film, or myself.
Rosamund was someone who I was
particularly single-minded on be
cause I believed, in the little that I'd
seen of her which included a play
that she was doing at the time, that
there was something within her that
naturally had the access to the char
acter that I was looking for. 1 think
that Rosamund really demonstrated
that enormous talent and ability that
she has. She was not afraid to put up
in front of the likes of Johnny Depp,
who. however warm and empower
ing he is with his contribution, is still
a force that is quite something to be
around and be put with. For me as a
director and for anybody else, he has
this incredible intensity and charis
ma, which carries or aids this talent
that he has.
IN'D So do you have any future work
planned?
LD: 1 have a couple of projects that
I'm working on at the moment one of
which is an adaptation of this book
from the 1950s by J.P. Dunleavy
called "The Gingernian," which will
hopefully happen in the next couple
of years. I am also working on a film
based on the book by Jerry Stahl
called "I, Fatty" about Roscoe Ar
buckle.
Well, thank you very much for
your time.
