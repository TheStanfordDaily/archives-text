### SILVIA SANCHEZ INTERMISSION DEPPLOVER 
In typical Johnny Depp fashion.
"The Libertine" is a movie that you
either love or hate. The movie takes
place in 17th century England and is
directed by first-time director Lau
rence Dunmore. It is the story of John
Wilmot (played by Depp), the Earl of
Rochester, a writer renowned for his
satire.The film traces the last years of
Wilmot's life: writing a play in honor
of King Charles 11. his affair with ac
tress Liz Barry, his exile and finally
his death from syphilis. While you
may love Depp, this period piece cer
tainly isn't a film that will be univer
sally adored.
Depp shines in his portrayal of a
man consumed with his own hedo
nism. His drunken rants are remi
niscent of Captain Jack Sparrow
from "Pirates of the Caribbean," yet
Depp's portrayal of Wilmot is dark
er and less comical than his cartoon
ish pirate scalawag. Depps's Wilmot
frequents whorehouses and is ulti
mately and completely consumed
by alcoholism. However. Depp
looks amazing throughout the first
half of the film, perfectly pristine in
the role of a 17th century gentleman
and entirely absorbed in the atmos
phere of the English playhouse. He
doesn't just act. he becomes his
character.
Unfortunately ladies, Johnny
Depp doesn't look gorgeous for the
entire film. Towards the end of the
film. Wilmot starts to show the phys
ical signs of syphilis—a disease
that mainly disfigures the face and
makes you bat-shit crazy. Yet, even
with his greatest asset disfigured,
Depp still exudes charisma. Depp
has often said that his dream is to
play a role in which his face is unrec
ognizable and in which he doesn't
have to cuic about his appearance.
While women everywhere will cry '
at the sight of Depp's mangled
countenance, he clearly relished the

role of Wilmot and did ;i perfect
job portraying the man's agony
and frustrations with life.
Supporting Depp's perform
ance is Rosamund Pike, a play
actress who portrays plays Eliz
abeth Malet — Wilmot's wife.
While hers was a small role, Pike
holds her own beside the impos
ing acting presence of Depp. Her
character's passion and devo
tion for her husband shows in
every nuanced look. She deliv-

ers a rather complex perform
ance, capturing the suffering of a
woman who loves a man, knows
that his heart belongs to someone
else, yet wonders if he loves her
hack. All these heart-wrenching
emotions push to the forefront
when she confronts him in an emo
tionally poignant scene.
But beware: this movie is not for
the faint of heart. In contrast to
other films set in England during
the 17th century, it shows London at
its darkest and dirtiest. Within the
film's copious number of sexually
explicit scenes, phallic images
abound (a dance with dildos is si
multaneously disturbing and hilari-

ous) and sex talk flows like the wine
poured into Wilmot's mouth. Like
any good sexual rebel, Wilmot's
overt mocking of the king grants
him an honor not uncommonly he
stowed upon satirists — Jonathan
Swift, anyone? — and he is ban
ished. However, despite all of these
flamboyant excesses. Depp man
ages to somehow depict a different
side of Wilmot, the side that cared;
he paints a complex portrait of a
compelling man,creating a captivat
ing character in the process.
From the very beginning, Wilmot
warns his audience that they will not
like him. Despite this warning, and
despite the inherent despicable na
ture of the character — do you real
ly see your parents wntching this
movie? — Depp conveys the more
' human side of Wilmot. sculpting a
persona unscrupulous yet at the
same time likable. Depp's perform-

ancc lets the audience look past the
sensationalism associated with John
Wilniol and end up empathizing
with him.
Adding to the wonderful cast.
John Malkovich plays King Charles
11. His relationship with Wilmot
shows both the tyrannical and arro
gant nature of the British monarchy.
But, at the same time, Malkovich
makes King Charles 11 a compas
sionate individual who has just as
many issues to deal with as any of
the characters in the film. I lis strug
gles are externalized in his conflicts
with Parliament and his subjects.
Conversely. Wilmot's struggle is in
ternal. coming to terms with his
emotions.The contrast between the
characters establishes an interesting
dichotomy that fuels many of their
clashes; though they are different,
they are intrinsically the same.
The final crux of the film is
Wilmot's love affair with the
temptress Elizabeth Barry (Saman
tha Morion), which stems from his
all-encompassing passion for his own
pleasures. As interesting as cheating
on your wife is, their relationship
leaves something to be desired. It was
not well developed and lacked some
of the most enticing aspects of "for
bidden love." I ended up wishing that
Wilmot would appreciate his wife
more and that the story would indeed
have a happy ending.Then again, life
in 17th century London can't-be all
neaches and cream, fi
