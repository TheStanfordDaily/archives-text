# "THE HILLS" MAY HAVE EYES, BUT YOU'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE
## 
### MATTY SMITH INTERMISSION EYE-BALLER 
You know there's a problem
when the act of writing a review
about how a movie genre is now just
a series of cliches becomes a cliche.
And while the horror genre espe
cially has always been the bearer of
a seemingly endless line of pre
dictable storylines, made very clear
by Wes Craven's "Scream," lately
those cliches seem to just keep
building up to the point of total ab
sence of creativity. "The Hills Have
Eyes" (ironically a remake of a Wes
Craven film) is another film that
does very little to break from the
trends of recent horror movies —
which is not to say it makes for an
entirely bad movie experience, just
one we've all seen played out many
times before.

To put it
simply, most of
you already
know whether
or not you'll
like "Hills." It's
a remake of a
cheap, gritty
70s horror
flick. As such.

it's a gritty, gory, stylized 00s horror
flick. It's pretty graphic, filled with
the gory imagery popularized in the
likes of "Saw" and "Hostel" (every
thing's even got that yellowish tint
found so often in horror movies
nowadays). It's unflinching in de
picting the brutality of its villains,
often using cringe-worthy moments
and buckets of fake blood to evoke
scares. The rest pretty much follows
all the formulas you'd expect —
which is okay, given the circum
stances, as with horror movies it's
less about originality and more
about scaring the audience by any
means necessary. Basically, if you're
a fan of movies like "Saw," "Hos
tel," or even the "Texas Chain Saw
Massacre" remake (which was
much worse than this), you'll prob
ably like "Hills."

The story re
volves around a
family on a road
trip through New
Mexico (with cast
members includ
ing "Lost"'s Enii
lie de Raven and
"Monk'"s Ted
Levine because
Hollywood hier-

archy demands that horror movie
actor fall right above TV supporting
star — check out the remake of
"The Fog" if you don't believe me).
As on any family roadtrip — sur
prise, surprise — Dad wants to take
a detour through the middle of the
boring, barren wasteland that is the
desert. Fortunately for the audi
ence, those hills are not so barren,
and are in fact inhabited by angry
mutants left disfigured (and
ornery) by US nuclear testing so
many years ago. I'm pretty sure
there was a bit of social commen
tary there in the original film, but,
you know, whatever. So the mutants
go about their ways in attacking and
occasionally just tormenting the
family. On a purely brainless level,
it's pretty entertaining, providing
enough shocking intense moments
to sustain the film for those expect
ing just the horror movie they've
seen time and again. On to the
gripes!
"Hills" comes off as just a stan
dard modern horror flick and. un
fortunately, does little to stand out
among the rest. For starters, direc
tor Alexandre Aja does very little to
create suspense throughout the first
half of the movie, made all the
worse by how obvious it is he's try
ing. His attempt to imbue the empty
desert with a creepy sense of life
fails, and what we're treated to is a
series of empty images of rocks. In
addition, as far as character devel
opment goes, all we get are a bunch
of annoying family members
yelling at each other and frustrating

the audience.The first
part of the movie

is pretty much just filler until we
get to the good stuff.
Fortunately, when the movie
gets going, it gets going. After
two-thirds of the movie drudges
by, the movie comes alive, with a
nonstop barrage of intense vio
lence and gore that succeeds in
exciting the audience. It's not so
much scary, but intense and
graphic enough to shock and en
tertain. Some of the character de
velopments make no sense —
the most annoying character be
comes a sort of vengeful cult
hero figure and one of the vil
lains does something that goes
entirely unexplained — but all is
forgiven for the sheer entertain
ment value. Many of the prob
lems of the first two thirds, in
cluding confusing and frustrat
ing motivations of all involved
(Wouldn't you take notice if

your sister was screaming for her
life? And where did the villains de
velop their unique tastes?) and the
fact that some of the mutants come
off as comic (two of them 1 amiably
nicknamed Skinny Gary Busey and
Vaudeville Gollum), are forgotten
when the movie finally kicks into

gear.
In the end,you probably already
know whether you'll like the

; "
movie — it's a moc'
ern standard hor
ror movie in
the vein of
those that

came before it. It's no Hitchcock or
Carpenter or even Craven classic,
hut for many, including me, it's got
enough good ol' horror guts n' gore
to make for an overall engaging (if
totally unoriginal) movie experi
ence.


The nuclear testing may have made them mutants, but they
should have known better than to get between her and the
shoe sale at Macy's.



Why does everyone in this movie
have an axe? I mean do you
own an axe?
