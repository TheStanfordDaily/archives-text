# ROXY SAYS: FIRST IS THE WORST
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
So it's your first time. You can be honest with Roxy.
Chances are this is a true statement for 80 percent of you I
reading this article right now. No need to be shy. And 1
whether you're that sexually precocious froshie who feels '
a stirring in thy loins at the slightest provocation, or that
aged-to-perfection senior who wants to just get the damn

thing over with before entering the real world,
Roxy has some practical, no-nonsense advice. j

Ditch the Magic and find some strange ass.
All of those high school sex-ed classes and .

very "special" episodes of Saved-by-the-
Bell-Blossom-Step-by-Step-Boy-Meets- j
World type shows you grew up with were J

lying to you. The first time you have sex .
isn't going to be earth-shattering no matter'
who you're with. There are no fireworks.

and the only loud bangs are likely to be your i

head cracking against the very un-sexy
post of your twin dorm bed. It doesn't mat
ter whether you're sleeping with your
childhood sweetheart who promises to
love and cherish you forever even though

he/she will inevitably leave you in a cold, cold puddle of de
spair and broken dreams sooner than you can say pub crawl.

In fact, it's better if you don't. Your first time should be
with someone who a) you've never met, b) someone you

— —— / j — J
can't stand, and preferably loathe, or c) that guy in
l IHUM section who picks at his skin and always has

i massive sweat stains under his arms even in the
dead of winter. Basically someone you generally
don't give a shit about.That way when the unavoid-

able humiliation sets in, you can quickly sweep it
under the emotional rug. This, of course, rules out that
good friend who you've always had sexual tension

with despite his persistent acne, that girl that winds
up in at least two of your discussion sections every
quarter and who might actually be stalking you
but its okay because she's semi-cute and anyone
else who you ever need to make eye contact with
again.

This goes doubly for you guys, despite
your fervent protestations that you've read quite
educational material on Ask Men.com and that
you're absolutely positive you will last a good 35
minutes on your first try, moving your partner

to unprecedented ecstasy. It just ain't gonna
happen. Don't be a chump. Accept your 2-
minute-man status — hell, embrace it, pray to
the gods of sexual-endurance and hope this

phase of your life is fleeting.!here is no other way around
it. Gals, you too need to scrap whatever expectations of si-

multaneous-orgasms or life-altering
moments of inward connectedness
you might have. Sure, you'll tell all
your close girlfriends immediately
thereafter (maybe even from his
dorm bathroom) that you came to
gether in one epic, screaming, panti
ng,"Basic Instinct' Mike climax. You
might have glimpsed the meaning of
life, you say.
In reality, there was approxi
mately 10 minutes of hungry mak
ing-out, followed by a race to un
dress, some uncomfortable and ill
advised fingering-hand-job action
and then the main course much too
fast despite both participants assur
ance that they were going to take it
slow and gentle. Literally two
thrusts and it was over, leaving you
feeling more naked than you may
ever have felt in your entire life. And
when you turn your head to look at

the person next to you — as you probably try very hard not
to touch one another in any way not even feet — the last
thing you want to see is the disappointment in the eyes of
someone you actually care about.

Call Roxy cynical, but you'll
thank me when you realize how much
practice you're going to want to have
before moving onto that studly guy
down the hall that you've already
named your fictitious children with.
Plus hey, a little ignorance goes
a long way Shedding all self-conscious
ness, you can pretty much do whatever
you want and write it off as a novice mis
take. Oh-was-that-the-wrong-hole?
moments are far more easily glossed
over in this context. Heard about the
donkey punch? Go for it. Whose to say
you don't suffer from spontaneous arm
spasms? Curious what would happen if
you gnawed just a little when you're
going down on him? Oops, sorry, I'm
just so innocent. It might not be the best
time to break out the nipple clamps, but
everyone's done something that de
serves a good spanking.

So the moral of the story is, go
out, be fruitful, prosper and all that... but you know, with
complete, hopefully repulsive, strangers that you can make
fun of later over dinner to mask your own freakish tenden
cies. And Stanford's the perfect place to start.
