## ACADEMICS New biochem focus asks for student input 
### JAMES HOHMANN SENIOR STAFF WRITER Patrick Fitzgerald 
The Chemistry De
partment recently an
nounced plans to add a
new biochemistry focus
to its existing undergrad
uate major. Specific re
quirements for the new
concentration remain
unknown as administra
tors continue planning
and seeking student
input.
"The beginnings of
this program have been
under development for
several years, as we have
developed two lecture
courses — Chemistry
188 and 189 —to fill a
need for undergraduate
instruction in biochem
istry," said Chemistry
Prof. Wray Huestis, vice
chair of the department.
The department is
considering expanding
on the Chemistry 188
and 189 courses with a
formal degree track pro
gram in biochemistry.
Department leaders
could not offer specifics,
as the new program re

810 BRIEF

The University announced
Wednesday that it has hired an
architect for the Medical
School's $89 million Learning
and Knowledge Center.
The San Francisco firm
NBBJ will oversee design of
the four-story, 120,000-square
foot building, set to serve as
the school s educational hub
with innovative lecture halls,
discussion areas, a conference
center and a digitally-driven
biomedical library.
"This is a major step for
ward in our effort to revitalize
our campus and transform the
way we train physicians and
scientists in the 21st century,"
Philip Pizzo, dean of the
School of Medicine, told The
San Jose Business Journal.
The project, which plans to
break ground in 2007. will be
funded through a combination
of private donations, debt and
University funds.

phase. However, a spokesman said he envisions students will
be able to complete the new emphasis' requirements during
their senior year.
"It is expected that interested students would take the
normal chemistry major course sequence through most of the
first three years, then take a three — and eventually four —

The announcement t»f a new biochemistry specialization is
part of the Chemistry Department's effort to be more respon
sive to undergraduates. With increasing overlap across the
fields of biology, chemistry and physics, students suggested
the idea of a biochemistry track while trying to independent
ly devise their own programs of study.
"Part of the impetus for this effort is student demand,"
Huestis said. "Over the years a number of undergraduates
have expressed interest in a biochemistry major, and some
have crafted individually designed majors that share many
features of the program being developed
The department welcomes student comments and ques
tions as it moves forward. Students are invited to an informa
tional meeting next Wednesday, March 15 at 12:30 p.m. in the
Chemistry Gazebo.
