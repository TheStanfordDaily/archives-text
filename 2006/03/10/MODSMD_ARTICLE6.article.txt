## Dining faces a variety platter of opinions Dining incorporates positive feedback as well as criticism into improvement plans 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Dining services at Stanford have undergone a number of
changes over the past few years, keeping food at the forefront of
student debate. With approximately 3,600 students enrolled in
Stanford meal plans, many have expressed myriad opinions on
the state of dining on campus.
A number said they were "really happy" with the dining serv
ices.
"No complaints from me," said freshman Alex Onsager as he
ate dinner at Wilbur.
Freshman Jimmie Sandman also expressed overall satisfac
tion.
"The food seems like it's better here than at other colleges,"
he said.
Despite such positive feedback. Dining Services representa
tives said that progress is always being made to further improve
the system.
"The student meal program is in a continuous process of im
provement," said Eric Montell, senior associate director of Stan
ford Dining. "We have a relationship with this campus and we
are concerned about how we can expand our role with student
groups and make students part of the process."
Recent modifications include moving from a system offering
over 15 different meal plans last year, to the current one that of

meals. Previously, two of the nine dining halls were a la carte fa

"The system was very confusing and it did not provide stu
dents with real options," Montell said. "We were asked by the
students, parents and other key stakeholders to provide simplic
ity, flexibility and choice."
In light of such upgrades, Stanford Dining was recently se
lected as one of the six winners of the Ivy Award. Sponsored by
Restaurants and Institutions (R&I), its Web site explains the
award as "given annually to food service operations that demon
strate the highest standards of excellence in food, service and
overall hospitality." The award is given to a variety of food serv
ice institutions, including hotels and restaurants. Stanford is the
first university in California to win the Ivy Award.
Some students, on the other hand, said they questioned din
ing service prices and would like the option to buy meal plans
with fewer meals and points.
Junior Matt Burriesci was involved with a petition during his
freshman year that aimed to allow "students to be excused from
the meal plan for economic or dietary reasons." He said the pe
tition wasn't very popular.
"If I had the option to buy five meals a week and obtain the
rest by myself, it would make the plan more affordable," Burri
esci wrote in an email to The Daily. "Some dining halls are pret
ty good and the improvements in letting us use points at non
dining hall eating establishments are good. However, it is still far
too expensive. While I think that Residential Education is im-
