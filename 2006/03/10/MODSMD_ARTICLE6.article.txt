# CAMPUS LIFE
## Dining faces a variety platter of opinions Dining incorporates positive feedback as well as criticism into improvement plans 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Dining services at Stanford have undergone a number of
changes over the past few years, keeping food at the forefront of
student debate. With approximately 3,600 students enrolled in
Stanford meal plans, many have expressed myriad opinions on
the state of dining on campus.
A number said they were "really happy" with the dining serv
ices.
"No complaints from me," said freshman Alex Onsager as he
ate dinner at Wilbur.
Freshman Jimmie Sandman also expressed overall satisfac
tion.
"The food seems like it's better here than at other colleges,"
he said.
Despite such positive feedback. Dining Services representa
tives said that progress is always being made to further improve
the system.
"The student meal program is in a continuous process of im
provement," said Eric Montell, senior associate director of Stan
ford Dining. "We have a relationship with this campus and we
are concerned about how we can expand our role with student
groups and make students part of the process."
Recent modifications include moving from a system offering
over 15 different meal plans last year, to the current one that of
fers three meal plan options with a combination of points and
meals. Previously, two of the nine dining halls were a la carte fa
cilities and the others were all-you-care-to-eat facilities.
"The system was very confusing and it did not provide stu
dents with real options," Montell said. "We were asked by the
students, parents and other key stakeholders to provide simplic
ity, flexibility and choice."
In light of such upgrades, Stanford Dining was recently se
lected as one of the six winners of the Ivy Award. Sponsored by
Restaurants and Institutions (R&I), its Web site explains the
award as "given annually to food service operations that demon
strate the highest standards of excellence in food, service and
overall hospitality." The award is given to a variety of food serv
ice institutions, including hotels and restaurants. Stanford is the
first university in California to win the Ivy Award.
Some students, on the other hand, said they questioned din
ing service prices and would like the option to buy meal plans
with fewer meals and points.
Junior Matt Burriesci was involved with a petition during his
freshman year that aimed to allow "students to be excused from
the meal plan for economic or dietary reasons." He said the pe
tition wasn't very popular.
"If I had the option to buy five meals a week and obtain the
rest by myself, it would make the plan more affordable," Burri
esci wrote in an email to The Daily. "Some dining halls are pret
ty good and the improvements in letting us use points at non
dining hall eating establishments are good. However, it is still far
too expensive. While I think that Residential Education is im-

portant. I eat fewer than 10 meals a
week at Stanford-owned establish
ments most weeks due to scheduling
conflicts."
Junior Ben Savage also attempt
ed to start a petition, but it "never
got off the ground."
"We are upset that we are re
quired to buy a dining plan and that
there are not pay-per-meal options
on campus," he said.
However, some, such as freshman
Zach Nevi, said they find the prices
reasonable.
"As one who really packs away
the food. $8 or $9 for a buffet isn't re
ally that bad a price," Nevi said.
Montell offered insight behind
the price determination process.
"The rate for the meal plans for
each year are presented to and ap
proved by the Board of Trustees." he
said.The meal plan rate incorporates
costs such as facility renovations and
maintenance, menu variety address

ing special dietary needs, competi
tive wage increases for the staff and
extended hours of service. He also
mentioned the opportunity for stu
dents to work for Stanford Dining in
a variety of positions to decrease the
cost of their meal plans.
Montell added that transition
from a la carte to all-you-care-to-eat
in Wilbur was "a major undertak
ing."
"We are developing student focus
groups to evaluate and help develop
new programs and service standards
unique to Wilbur dining," he said.
"Some of the ideas include expand
ed menu stations and developing a
continuous cafe with soft and hard
seating in the servery."
Executive Director of Stanford
Dining Rafi Taherian stressed the
importance of student feedback in
the ongoing effort to improve servic
es.
"As administrators, we can't sit
down and make these decisions
without you." he said. "Why create
something students won't use? We
want to make the experience at
Stanford the best. Better than any
where else."

mentioned the opportunity for stu
dents to work for Stanford Dining in
a variety of positions to decrease the
cost of their meal plans.
Montell added that transition
from a la carte to all-you-care-to-eat
in Wilbur was "a major undertak
ing."
"We are developing student focus
groups to evaluate and help develop
new programs and service standards
unique to Wilbur dining," he said.
"Some of the ideas include expand
ed menu stations and developing a
continuous cafe with soft and hard
seating in the servery."
Executive Director of Stanford
Dining Rafi Taherian stressed the
importance of student feedback in
the ongoing effort to improve servic
es.
"As administrators, we can't sit
down and make these decisions
without you." he said. "Why create
something students won't use? We
want to make the experience at
Stanford the best. Better than any
where else."
