## Stanford dismisses wireless scare

While a small college in Canada known as Lakehead University
made international headlines after shutting down campus wireless
due to purported health risks from electromagnetic forces, Stan
( ' ford continues to blaze ahead in its expansion of wireless Internet
u access on campus.
u Richard Holeton, head of Residential Computing, disputed the
allegations made by Lakehead's president on CNN.
, } "That claim must have something to do with the fact that wire
less operates on the same radio frequency as, for example, mi
ir crowave ovens," he said. "You might argue that they're slowly
being cooked, but it's so slow that I think that it's negligible. 1
j,' don't know of any solid research that shows there's a serious
health risk from wireless. The signal is so small that it's hard to
imagine. No one that I know of here has taken it seriously enough
to raise it as a health issue."

Senior Zi Shen Lim, a residential computing consultant at
Roble, agreed that he found Lakehead's decision questionable.
"It's kind of like the cell phone thing," he said. "Some people do
some research and they think it's a reason to be worried about it,
but I personally am not worried about it.There aren't enough rea
sons to worry about things like that. If you want to be worried about
connections, you should be worried about cell phones because
you're carrying it next to you."
Convinced that the risks posed by wireless, if any, are negligible
to the point of being non-existent, health concerns are taking the
back seat to convenience as the University continues to push for ex
panded wireless service.
The project, which began three years ago, has yet to meet its goal
of Ã¼biquitous wireless connection on campus. Currently, wireless is
available in a number of residences, as well as in public areas such
as the libraries, the Quad, academic departments and TVesidder
