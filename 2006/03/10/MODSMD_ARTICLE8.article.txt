## Stanford dismisses wireless scare 
### ANDREA FULLER STAFF WRITER 
or
While a small college in Canada known as Lakehead University
made international headlines after shutting down campus wireless
due to purported health risks from electromagnetic forces, Stan
( ' ford continues to blaze ahead in its expansion of wireless Internet
u access on campus.
u Richard Holeton, head of Residential Computing, disputed the
allegations made by Lakehead's president on CNN.
, } "That claim must have something to do with the fact that wire
less operates on the same radio frequency as, for example, mi
ir crowave ovens," he said. "You might argue that they're slowly
being cooked, but it's so slow that I think that it's negligible. 1
j,' don't know of any solid research that shows there's a serious
health risk from wireless. The signal is so small that it's hard to
imagine. No one that I know of here has taken it seriously enough
to raise it as a health issue."

Senior Zi Shen Lim, a residential computing consultant at
Roble, agreed that he found Lakehead's decision questionable.
"It's kind of like the cell phone thing," he said. "Some people do
some research and they think it's a reason to be worried about it,
but I personally am not worried about it.There aren't enough rea
sons to worry about things like that. If you want to be worried about
connections, you should be worried about cell phones because
you're carrying it next to you."
Convinced that the risks posed by wireless, if any, are negligible
to the point of being non-existent, health concerns are taking the
back seat to convenience as the University continues to push for ex
panded wireless service.
The project, which began three years ago, has yet to meet its goal
of übiquitous wireless connection on campus. Currently, wireless is
available in a number of residences, as well as in public areas such
as the libraries, the Quad, academic departments and TVesidder
Union, co-supported by Academic Comput
ing and ITSS.
"They have been pretty successful includ
ing coverage for about 75 percent of the un
dergraduate residences on campus," Holeton
said. "The graduate residences have been
moving slower and we're making good
progress now. The Escondido Village low
rises are about two-thirds completed and we
hope that the Escondido Village low rises will
be done by this summer. We have plans in the
works for the studios in the graduate resi
dences. Likewise, we're trying to move ahead
with the rest of the undergraduate residences
that don't have wireless yet."
Though Residential Computing currently
lacks sufficient funds to immediately expand
wireless to all areas at the present, Holeton
said that the University is working as quickly
as possible to bring wireless to the largest
number of people possible.
"We've tried to move it in ways to have the
greatest impact that we could by deploying in
it in whole complexes whenever possible," he
said. "Another thing that we do is piggyback
onto capital improvement projects."
While Holeton deemed the progress suc
cessful so far, he added that some buildings
such as Roble have been held off from imme
diate wireless installation due to practical rea
sons.
"It's about to undergo renovation, so as
part of the renovation.it will be made wireless
ready," he said. "So meanwhile, what we did is
go out and install wireless in the common
areas as a partial measure. Our standard is to
make it available everywhere in all student
rooms and in the outdoor areas, and Roble is
one exception we made while it is awaiting
renovation."
Lim also added that the expansion is a
product of consistent student demand.
"Many people have asked for it,"he said.
"We've seen it in the residential survey.
There's the computer part and every year
people have mentioned that we want wireless.
That's pretty much the main concern. But it's
been getting better. You're getting connec
tions at more places."
Freshman Sarah Spikes fully supported
the expansion project.
"My computer doesn't work on wired, be
cause I have hardware issues, so 1 depend
solely on wireless," she said. "This means it's
really inconvenient when the wireless is spot
ty. It should be available on the entire cam
pus."
