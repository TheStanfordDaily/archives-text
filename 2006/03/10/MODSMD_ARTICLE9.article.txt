The recent resignation of Harvard President
Lawrence Summers cast a shadow over yester
day's meeting of the Faculty Senate, which con
sisted mostly of discussions about the public af
fairs status of the University — namely media
relations and its impact on public standing.
At the meeting, which convened at the Law
School, University Academic Secretary Edward
D. Harris Jr. stressed the vital importance of
public affairs to a university's well-being, citing
Summers as his prime example.
Summers was forced to resign after a turbu
lent five years and the most public faculty rebel
lion in the school's 370 year history. His pejora
tive comment on the subject of women in sci
ence. which circulated like wildfire in the press,
was the final blow. Harris pointed out that Har
vard is now looking to form a faculty senate sim
ilar to that at Stanford to prevent such instances
from reoccurring.
The main speaker at last night's meeting was
David Demarest, Stanford vice president of
Public Affairs. His address outlined the mission
and structure of proactive public affairs: to ad
vance and defend the University's reputation
while helping it achieve its objectives related to
teaching, learning and research.
Demarest also touched on the recent
Olympics to stress the power of the media, par
ticularly its ability to paint events in either a pos
itive or negative light.
"The media put Bode Miller on a pedestal;
the media also removed Bode Miller from that
pedestal," he said.
He said he believes that solid research in
forms the University's public affairs strategies
about key constituencies and issues. Having ex
perience and skill in dealing with the media is
also of utmost importance, he said.
The Office of University Communications
provided a handout for faculty on public affair
strategies. The flier outlined information about
ethics and procedures, including a reminder that
during interviews, one becomes the representa
tive of the entire University and therefore should
be clear to distinguish personal opinions as sepa
rate from the standpoint of the institution.

Demarest also addressed the goal to com
pile campus speakers and events on one cal
endar to make the schedule more accessible
to students and faculty.
"The absence of a master calendar that I can
access to understand and take advantage of
everything that is happening — that is some
thing on my list of to dos," he said.
Among other issues addressed were the
memorial resolutions for Jan F. Triska and
Elizabeth Cohen.
Cohen, professor emerita of education, died
of cancer on March 12, 2005 at her campus
home. With a doctorate from Harvard, Cohen
joined the Stanford faculty in 1966 and became
a full professor in 1975. Among her accomplish
ments was the foundation of the Program for
Complex Instruction, a groundbreaking peda
gogy that applies sociological theory to promote
racial, ethnic and gender equity in the class
room. Jan TViska, professor emeritus of Political
Science since 1989, died on February 20,2003, at
the age of 81.
The Senate also voted unanimously to
pass two bills put forth by the Committee on
Graduate Studies, recommending the con
version of Interdisciplinary Programs in Epi
demiology and Health Services Research to
Departmental Programs within Health Re
search and Policy.
Harris also spoke of the long-awaited online
Faculty Senate election, in which more than 500
votes had been cast by the faculty electronically
— a greater number than the amount of total
votes last year. Harris attributed the success so
far to strong publicity and encouraged more fac
ulty members to vote.
"We hoped the move to online elections
would enfranchise more of the faculty," Harris
said as he closed the meeting.
