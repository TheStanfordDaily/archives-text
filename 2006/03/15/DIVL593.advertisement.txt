are caused by people attempting
to cook or smoke while under the influence of alcohol.

How do Yiddish novels reveal changes in modern Jewish life and literature in Europe and the U.S.
in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries? This course will examine the influences of folklore,
traditional Jewish culture, and European literature on the rise of the novel in Yiddish.
We will read works by Isaac and Joshua Singer, Joseph Opatoshu, Chava Rosentarb, Mendele
Moykher Sforim, Sholem Aleichem and David Bergelson.
Readings will be in English, with optional sessions for close readings in \iddish.
