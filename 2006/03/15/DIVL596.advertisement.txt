Senior Web
Developer
(database god, inventor, renaissance person, genius,
detail maniac, scalability guru)
A little about us. We're a startup in Menlo Park creating an online
world that combines elements of building, inventing, combat and
community. If you like Lego®, Transformers®, NeoPets or the show
Junkyard Wars, then you'll love what we're working on. We're
searching for a Senior Web Developer to lead the development of
our website and database infrastructure.
Now a little about you. You're a MS or Ph.D., or a BS with
significant industry experience. You have built production sites with
PHP, JSP, Python or .Net. On the database side, you're into
MySQL, PostgreSQL and/or SQL Server.
This is an opportunity to get in on the ground floor with a capable
team in a hot market. We hail from Stanford, Cornell and Brown,
and we've successfully created, invested in, and sold companies
before. This could be your Dream Job.
Thanks for your interest in ROBLOX. You can contact us directly at
david@roblox.com or at 650-701-0101.
