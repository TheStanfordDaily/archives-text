Higher fuel prices aren't just breaking your hank -
they may jeopardize your spring break. Fliers be
ware: you're about to experience some recirculated
air. Side effects may include body odor, stuffiness, and - de
pending on whom you believe - an increased chance of
spending the last week of March under the weather.
In the 19605, when commercial airlines enjoyed a world of
pre-1973 oil prices, jet passengers basked in a cabin that was
constantly being replenished with fresh air from outside the
plane. Ihe average passenger would receive about 20 cubic feet
of fresh air per minute.
My, how times have changed. In a world of post-1973 oil
prices, a passenger is lucky to get 6 cubic feet of fresh air each
minute. As fuel prices have risen, airlines have sought ways to
lower costs on fuel oil.
One way has been to reduce the amount of air circulat
ed from outside, thus reducing the drag on the plane, which
in turn decreases fuel needs. Now, to keep air quality kosher
during flights, airlines are increasing the role of "recirculat
ed air," air from the cabin that is run through a filter and re
turned to passengers.Today, more than 50 percent of the air
passengers breathe comes not from outside the plane, but
from recirculated air.
Some of the consequences of this change in air supply
have been clearly documented. For one, the filters charged
with the task of picking particulates out of the recirculated
air cannot eliminate odorous gases. Reducing the amount of
fresh air in the plane means that more body odors and
volatile organic chemicals - especially on planes that serve
large amounts of alcohol - are spread throughout the cabin.
In 1960 you may have only worried if the passenger next to
you had run out of deodorant that day. Now you're almost at
equal risk from the drunk in 36C as you are from the perspir
ing hippie in 7F.
Recirculated air also affects carbon dioxide levels. When
outside air was brought in. enough fresh oxygen would be
cycled through the cabin to keep levels of CO2, constantly
exhaled by passengers, low. However, when air is recirculat
ed, carbon dioxide levels gradually rise over the course of a
flight while oxygen levels decrease. This does not pose a
real health threat to passengers, but it can result in CO2 lev
els where people perceive a change in air quality. If you
start feeling stuffy several hours into the flight, blame your
airline's decision to save fuel costs at the expense of your
pulmonary pleasure.
If you're en route to Cancun or Waikiki. however, you may
be likely to put up with sonic unpleasant fumes as long as you
can avoid the worst fate to befall a spring breaker - a cold or flu.
Many a traveler could likely share an anecdote about
getting sick from a fellow plane passenger. After all, each
person on an airplane has about one-tenth the available air
space they enjoy in an office. But does recirculating air in
stead of bringing in fresh air put you at even greater risk?
M.B. Hocking, a professor of chemistry at the Universi
ty of Victoria in British Columbia thinks it does. In a 2000
article in the journal Chemosphere, Hocking argues that,
while there is no conclusive data, evidence suggests that the
increasing dependence on recirculation docs put passen
gers at greater risk.
The answer to this question hinges largely on the effi-

ciency of planes' air filters. Air filters
theoretically range in efficacy from
those with % percent removal rates
for particles 0.5 micrometers in di
ameter to those with 99.97 percent
removal rates for particles 0.3 mi
crometers in diameter. However,
Hocking argues that, in practice, effi
ciency can be as low as 70 percent.
This means that, while the filters
are likely to capture bacteria, which
range from 0.5 to 15 micrometers in
diameter, viruses, which are smaller
and range in diameter from 0.003 to
0.05 micrometers, are a different
story. The 1991 handbook for the
American Society of Heating, Re
frigeration and Air Conditioning
Engineers states that "the airborne
viruses that transmit infection are so
small that no known filtering device
is effective." If this is true, recirculat
ed air turns airplanes into mini
whirlpools that pick up viruses from
one part of the aircraft and expose
passengers to them over and over
again. Hocking points out that this
may increase the risk to passengers
of catching a virus while flying.
An extreme case occurred about
25 years ago when a plane got held
on a runway for three hours. In this

case, there was neither circulation of
outside air nor filtering of air inside
the cabin. The result? Seventy-two
percent of passengers on the plane
contracted the same virus.
But tropics-bound seniors, fear not.
An empirical study may give you hope.
A study printed in the July 24,
2002 issue of the Journal of the
American Medical Association
found no statistically significant evi
dence of increased illness in passen
gers traveling on planes with recircu
lated air. The experiment, which in
volved 1100 passengers, found that
19 percent of passengers who trav
eled on flights with 100 percent fresh
air ventilation experienced cold
symptoms within one week, versus
21 percent of passengers on flights
that recirculated air. Ten percent of
passengers in fresh-air ventilated
flights versus 11 percent of those in
flights with air recirculation report
ed a runny nose, and 3 percent of
passengers in each case reported an
aggregate of eight upper respiratory
infection symptoms.
So pack your perfume and enjoy
the Bay Area air while you can. You
don't need to worry too much about
germs being blown into your seat by
your air nozzle overhead. Do keep
your eye, however, on the messy
five-year-old next to you. He may be
your greatest enemy.
