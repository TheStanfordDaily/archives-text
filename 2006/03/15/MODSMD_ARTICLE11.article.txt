Jess Dang. Class of 2003, spends her days working
as a management consultant for a boutique firm in
Palo Alto. By night, she's cooking up a storm at home
and trying out her delicious creations.
"I read about it; I cook it; I eat it; I dream about it."
Dang says.
Her big break came last December when she was
selected as one of eight finalists for tiie second series
of "The Next Food Network Star." The show is one of
the channel's most popular primetime series.
"After the success of the first season, we couldn't
wait to work with the new batch of contestants," says
Bob TUschman, senior vice president of programming
for the Food Network, in a press release.
Season one was one of the highest-rated and most
watched primetime series in Food Network history.
The show works like many other reality TV shows —
there are eight participants, ranging from amateurs to
professional chefs. Each week there is a cooking chal
lenge, after which a panel of judges eliminates one of
the contestants.
Dang says she got her start in cooking while she
was studying abroad in Florence with the Stanford
Overseas Program. Then, she kept cooking on the
Farm during her junior and senior years.
"My junior year I was a resident assistant in
Larkin and I had the room with a kitchen in it," Dang
says. "My senior year I lived in Kairos and really en
joyed cooking for everyone."
Kairos voted Dang best cook at the end of the
year.
The Food Network looks for contestants that
viewers would want to invite into their own living
room every day.
"I rented a camera from Meyer Library one day
last fall and created my own three-minute audition
tape," Dang says.
The Food Network selected her submission from
a pool of more than B,(XK) audition tapes. After get
ting called back by the casting director, she sent in 25
original recipes. A week later, the Food Network flew
Dang to New York for three weeks to tape the show.
"Dang came across as smart, upbeat and fun-lov
ing," TUshman explains. "She had an infectious ener
gy and brought an expertise in Asian cooking that
was appealing to us, since we don't have a show like
that on our air."
Dang says that the aura on the set during taping
was slightly competitive.

"It was stressful to do something outside of a lot of
people's comfort zones — to have six cameras in
your face and to be entertaining and engaging at the
same time was not something I was used to!" Dang
says.
Food Network Public Relations Representative
Lisa del Colle explains that " The Next Food Network
Star" is a "great behind-the-scenes look at how food
television is made."

Dang mentions that her cooking philosophy
caters to young professionals looking for quick and
easy recipes.
"I'm a self-taught chef and I really think people
can teach themselves how to cook." Dang says. "My
cooking philosophy is kind of chic food that is easy to
put together — lots of shortcuts here and there."
Her friends call her "the petite pig" because she
eats like someone twice her size. You can learn more

Ilie first episode of "The Next Food Network
Star" will air on Sunday, Mar. 19 at 9 p.m.The winner
receives his or her own six-part cooking series on the
Food Network that will premiere in June 2(M)6.
