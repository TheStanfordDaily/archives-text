## At Pasta? you'll get tasty meals—no question 
### 
Pasta? poses an interesting dilemma
over how to pronounce its name.
Docs one simply say "pasta" —
with an upward inflection suggesting an
inquiry — or say "pasta question-mark."
Despite the uncertainty reflected in its
alias, there's no question that Pasta? spe
cializes in pasta dishes. In a trendy setting
on University Avenue, Pasta? dishes out
tasty, traditional Italian food.
Walk through the door, and you're
met by two huge bottles of vodka that
adorn a bar buzzing with people while a
large TV screen plays sports in the back
ground. A curvy brick bench runs along
one side of the equally-full dining room,
with walls painted in bold, hunger-inspir
ing yellow and red. Übiquitous photo
graphs of wine bottles, espresso beans,
grapes and pasta decorate the walls, and
vogue lights — reminiscent of Venetian
blown glass — hang from a high ceiling.

pleasant, stylish environment part of a
patron's dining experience.
Pasta? is quite a popular weekend
spot, and a wait to get a table can be ex
pected. On a Saturday night, my party
and I waited for what the hostess said
would be a half hour but felt longer. If
you're under 21 and can't hang out at the
bar, Pasta? doesn't provide much in
terms of a waiting area — my dining
companions and I had to choose between
awkwardly standing directly in front of
the doorway or freezing at a table out
side.
After being seated, my party was

greeted by a no-nonsense server who did
n't go out of his way to appear friendly,
hurriedly asking us for our order. If not
chatty, he was certainly efficient, and the
food arrived very quickly at our table.The
insalata delta casa ($4.25) consisted of
fresh field greens, tomato, shredded car
rots and two olives, with a vinaigrette that
had a strong olive oil taste.The vegetables
were all very fresh and tasted wonderful.
The verdict on the Caesar salad was
not as positive. My friend remarked that
it was "surprisingly bland," but noted that
at least the waitress who offered us
ground pepper for the salads was far
friendlier than our other server.
A lot of the menu items at Pasta? stick
to the basics, and you get what you ex
pect. Although none of the dishes were
amazing, died-and-gone-to-heaven deli
cious, everything was definitely tasty. My
fettuccine primavera ($10.25), with
homemade fettuccine, tomato sauce.

broccoli, zucchini and mushrooms, was
enjoyable, although a little skimpy on the
vegetables.
One of my friends liked the macaroni
and cheese ($10.25), but found it too
small for someone with a big appetite. I
thought that the portions were adequate
and liked the fact that they weren't
alarmingly enormous — although it's
true that if you're very hungry and on a
budget, it's disappointing that a $10 meal
won't leave you any leftovers. Another
friend thought that the salmon ($14.25),
which comes with potatoes and vegeta
bles, was well-prepared.
Pasta? could make a nice destination
for a dinner out with friends, especially if
your group contains some picky eaters
that don't like to venture into unknown
territory.The prices aren't cheap, but they
could be worse considering the am
biance. Overall, Pasta? is a safe bet for a
nice meal.
