## Editorial Introducing the Editorial Board 
### 
Sam Bhagwat is a freshman who plans to
major in Economics out of genuine interest
for the subject rather than career plans. He
thinks of himself as the classic fuchie, as re
vealed by his contemplation of taking mi
nors in both math and history. He is a liber
tarian equally amused by the political cli
mate of his conservative suburban home
town and the eternal egalitarian activism of
the Farm. While unable to express his moti
vations for joining the editorial board in
anything but broad generalities, he hopes
that his drop in the bucket — a trust in indi
vidual human beings — can help dry up the
poisonous well of faith in arbitrary authori
ty-
Theodora Chang is a junior majoring in
International Relations and Human Biolo
gy. As a 20-year-old who still believes in play
grounds, Theodora believes that the Board
offers her a way to express her innate ideal
ism in a constructive fashion. She looks for
ward to going abroad next quarter, as she
will officially become the Board's corre
spondent in Oxford. She holds on to the con
viction that Dick Cheney should not have
shot his hunting partner.
Molly Cunningham was born and raised
in Louisville, Kentucky, then moved to the
deep suburbia of DC/MD/VA. Though of
fensively opinionated, Molly trusts neither
the left nor the right; the former because she
is too jaded from being raised by peaceniks
in suits, the latter because, well, who trusts
the right? In fact, Molly generally mistrusts
people, but she especially mistrusts institu
tions. Needless to say, she is a CASA major.
She is also passionately opposed to the Stan
ford Bubble. Bring up any problem facing
the Stanford community, and she will attrib

ute its root to the Iron Fist of University
Hand-Holding. In other words, she dislikes
ResEd just as much as they dislike her. She
now lives at EBF. (Her peacenik parents are
proud.) She is doing all she can to get back to
Africa.
Opinions editor Victoria Degtyareva. a
sophomore majoring in Comparative Liter
ature, has been writing for The Daily since
the beginning of her freshman year, but this
is her first volume with the Board. After
spending three very satisfying volumes
working in the news department, she decid
ed that it was time to branch out and try
something new. Opinions seemed like the
way to go. She enjoys the unique discussion
forum provided by the Editorial Board and
appreciates contributing to the Board's
work.
Nick Hoy is a sophomore majoring in In
ternational Relations. He brings a Canadian
perspective to the Board, but unlike most
Canadians, makes no efforts to conciliate.
Once an integral fourth-line right winger for
the Stanford hockey team, several injuries
forced Nick to miss his sophomore season,
opening up a small hole in his extracurricu
lar schedule. The Board offers Nick an op
portunity to engage in dialogue with people
he doesn't agree with, and to experience
journalism ex post facto the Stanford Re
view. Nick's objective in joining the Board is
to take strong stands on the issues that
should matter most to Stanford students as
engaged global citizens.
Laure Negiar is a junior from France
majoring in Public Policy. She started
working as a columnist for the Daily last
volume — it was then that she re
alized how many people read the
Daily. She also learned that people
take the time to respond, both to
agree and disagree. She is thor
oughly enjoying the Editorial
Board experience, particularly the
intense debates during the Board's
weekly meetings. Her pet issues in
clude eating disorders and body
image on campus, the lack of un
dergraduate hang-out locations,
international students and advis
ing.
Opinions editor Wenkai Tay is a
sophomore majoring in Chemical
Engineering. He is a veteran of the
Board, as he has a member for the
last two volumes. In his spare time,
he works as a peer writing tutor and
as a research assistant on an ongoing
sociology project on social move
ments. He truly believes that well
written editorials can change the
world.
Vijaya Tripathi is a senior major
ing in International Relations with a
minor in English. Her interests in
clude human rights norms, ethnic
conflict and conflict resolution, and
human security. In addition to being
on the Board, she is also the Gender
Dialogue Coordinator with the
Stanford University Women's Com
munity Center, as well as a Focus As
sistant in Castano Global Affairs
dorm. She hopes the Stanford com
munity will relate to the Board's ef
forts toward open and honest com
munication about matters close to
the Stanford heart.
Yuting Yeh is a sophomore con
sidering a major in International
Relations or another environ
ment-related but non-techie field.
This is her first exposure to jour
nalism. A native of Taiwan, she has
had the privilege of experiencing
two different cultures and educa
tional philosophies. She is current
ly the kitchen manager of Ham
marskjold, having the power to
order $800 worth of food each
week. She hopes to promote inter
national understanding within the
Stanford community and offer
perspectives that are often neg
lected. Most importantly, she
hopes to foster the interconnec
tions among the Stanford commu
nity, the environment and the rest
of the world.

town and the eternal egalitarian activism of
the Farm. While unable to express his moti
vations for joining the editorial board in
anything but broad generalities, he hopes
that his drop in the bucket — a trust in indi
vidual human beings — can help dry up the
poisonous well of faith in arbitrary authori

Theodora Chang is a junior majoring in
International Relations and Human Biolo
gy. As a 20-year-old who still believes in play
grounds, Theodora believes that the Board
offers her a way to express her innate ideal
ism in a constructive fashion. She looks for
ward to going abroad next quarter, as she
will officially become the Board's corre
spondent in Oxford. She holds on to the con
viction that Dick Cheney should not have
shot his hunting partner.
Molly Cunningham was born and raised
in Louisville, Kentucky, then moved to the
deep suburbia of DC/MD/VA. Though of
fensively opinionated, Molly trusts neither
the left nor the right; the former because she
is too jaded from being raised by peaceniks
in suits, the latter because, well, who trusts
the right? In fact, Molly generally mistrusts
people, but she especially mistrusts institu
tions. Needless to say, she is a CASA major.
She is also passionately opposed to the Stan
ford Bubble. Bring up any problem facing
the Stanford community, and she will attrib

ute its root to the Iron Fist of University
Hand-Holding. In other words, she dislikes
ResEd just as much as they dislike her. She
now lives at EBF. (Her peacenik parents are
proud.) She is doing all she can to get back to
Africa.
Opinions editor Victoria Degtyareva. a
sophomore majoring in Comparative Liter
ature, has been writing for The Daily since
the beginning of her freshman year, but this
is her first volume with the Board. After
spending three very satisfying volumes
working in the news department, she decid
ed that it was time to branch out and try
something new. Opinions seemed like the
way to go. She enjoys the unique discussion
forum provided by the Editorial Board and
appreciates contributing to the Board's
work.
Nick Hoy is a sophomore majoring in In
ternational Relations. He brings a Canadian
perspective to the Board, but unlike most
Canadians, makes no efforts to conciliate.
Once an integral fourth-line right winger for
the Stanford hockey team, several injuries
forced Nick to miss his sophomore season,
opening up a small hole in his extracurricu
lar schedule. The Board offers Nick an op
portunity to engage in dialogue with people
he doesn't agree with, and to experience
journalism ex post facto the Stanford Re
view. Nick's objective in joining the Board is
to take strong stands on the issues that
should matter most to Stanford students as
engaged global citizens.
Laure Negiar is a junior from France
majoring in Public Policy. She started
working as a columnist for the Daily last
volume — it was then that she re
alized how many people read the
Daily. She also learned that people
take the time to respond, both to
agree and disagree. She is thor
oughly enjoying the Editorial
Board experience, particularly the
intense debates during the Board's
weekly meetings. Her pet issues in
clude eating disorders and body
image on campus, the lack of un
dergraduate hang-out locations,
international students and advis
ing.
Opinions editor Wenkai Tay is a
sophomore majoring in Chemical
Engineering. He is a veteran of the
Board, as he has a member for the
last two volumes. In his spare time,
he works as a peer writing tutor and
as a research assistant on an ongoing
sociology project on social move
ments. He truly believes that well
written editorials can change the
world.
Vijaya Tripathi is a senior major
ing in International Relations with a
minor in English. Her interests in
clude human rights norms, ethnic
conflict and conflict resolution, and
human security. In addition to being
on the Board, she is also the Gender
Dialogue Coordinator with the
Stanford University Women's Com
munity Center, as well as a Focus As
sistant in Castano Global Affairs
dorm. She hopes the Stanford com
munity will relate to the Board's ef
forts toward open and honest com
munication about matters close to
the Stanford heart.
Yuting Yeh is a sophomore con
sidering a major in International
Relations or another environ
ment-related but non-techie field.
This is her first exposure to jour
nalism. A native of Taiwan, she has
had the privilege of experiencing
two different cultures and educa
tional philosophies. She is current
ly the kitchen manager of Ham
marskjold, having the power to
order $800 worth of food each
week. She hopes to promote inter
national understanding within the
Stanford community and offer
perspectives that are often neg
lected. Most importantly, she
hopes to foster the interconnec
tions among the Stanford commu
nity, the environment and the rest
of the world.
