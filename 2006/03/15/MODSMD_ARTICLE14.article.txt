## Editorial Introducing the Editorial Board

Sam Bhagwat is a freshman who plans to
major in Economics out of genuine interest
for the subject rather than career plans. He
thinks of himself as the classic fuchie, as re
vealed by his contemplation of taking mi
nors in both math and history. He is a liber
tarian equally amused by the political cli
mate of his conservative suburban home
town and the eternal egalitarian activism of
the Farm. While unable to express his moti
vations for joining the editorial board in
anything but broad generalities, he hopes
that his drop in the bucket — a trust in indi
vidual human beings — can help dry up the
poisonous well of faith in arbitrary authori
ty-
Theodora Chang is a junior majoring in
International Relations and Human Biolo
gy. As a 20-year-old who still believes in play
grounds, Theodora believes that the Board
offers her a way to express her innate ideal
ism in a constructive fashion. She looks for
ward to going abroad next quarter, as she
will officially become the Board's corre
spondent in Oxford. She holds on to the con
viction that Dick Cheney should not have
shot his hunting partner.
Molly Cunningham was born and raised
in Louisville, Kentucky, then moved to the
deep suburbia of DC/MD/VA. Though of
fensively opinionated, Molly trusts neither
the left nor the right; the former because she
is too jaded from being raised by peaceniks
in suits, the latter because, well, who trusts
the right? In fact, Molly generally mistrusts
people, but she especially mistrusts institu
tions. Needless to say, she is a CASA major.
She is also passionately opposed to the Stan
ford Bubble. Bring up any problem facing
the Stanford community, and she will attrib

ute its root to the Iron Fist of University
Hand-Holding. In other words, she dislikes
ResEd just as much as they dislike her. She
now lives at EBF. (Her peacenik parents are
proud.) She is doing all she can to get back to
Africa.
Opinions editor Victoria Degtyareva. a
sophomore majoring in Comparative Liter
ature, has been writing for The Daily since
the beginning of her freshman year, but this
is her first volume with the Board. After
spending three very satisfying volumes
working in the news department, she decid
ed that it was time to branch out and try
something new. Opinions seemed like the
way to go. She enjoys the unique discussion
forum provided by the Editorial Board and
appreciates contributing to the Board's
work.
Nick Hoy is a sophomore majoring in In
ternational Relations. He brings a Canadian
perspective to the Board, but unlike most
Canadians, makes no efforts to conciliate.
Once an integral fourth-line right winger for
the Stanford hockey team, several injuries
forced Nick to miss his sophomore season,
opening up a small hole in his extracurricu
lar schedule. The Board offers Nick an op
portunity to engage in dialogue with people
he doesn't agree with, and to experience
journalism ex post facto the Stanford Re
view. Nick's objective in joining the Board is
to take strong stands on the issues that
should matter most to Stanford students as
engaged global citizens.
Laure Negiar is a junior from France
majoring in Public Policy. She started
