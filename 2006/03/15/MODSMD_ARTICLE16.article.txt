Hey. I know our country has been
through some serious stuff lately, but
have we forgotten about Number
lOne? Whatever happened to Osama? It
Jseems like only yesterday we were plaster
•ing his face across dartboards and hoping to
|get him in our pack of terrorist trading
'cards. But then there was Afghanistan, then
ilraq, then Katrina and now we've had
Dubais and Milosevic and more Iraq.
•Osama who?
1 It's been ages since I've heard about dis
crimination at the airports, so 1 know securi
ty is getting way too loose. Does this mean
.'it's ok to grow a beard now? Maybe all we
[need is a good Red Color Alert to get us
'back in the bin Laden hype (what color are
|we at now anyway?). It's funny that the ter
rorism poster boy gets more trouble from
Jhis kidneys than he does from the United
Maybe we'd remember our old friend if
iwe could manage to settle on something to
•be afraid of. Between terrorists, hurricanes,
Earthquakes, mudslides and a vicious flu
[strain that could become a global killer, I
have no idea what should keep me up at
inight. Do I stock up on duct tape or antibi
otics or bottled water? If only our govern
ment was content to control us with just one
ifear, we might be able to remember which
•fear it is. Too bad the facts always get in the
.'way and they're forced to come up with
something even more frightening, even
more eminent and even more stupid. I just
.don't see how our number one priority can
[change so frequently. It's almost as if the
changes its focus as fast as the
I media does.
This is about the administration, but this
!is also about the United States and about the
people who live in the United States. What
'troubles me most is how quickly we all for
!get. How quickly we forget the last big scare,

how quickly wc forget promises politicians
have made, and most of all. how quickly we
forget that we are at war this very minute.
Even worse. I. personally, don't feel like
we're at war, so it's that much easier to ig
nore. How can what's wrong change if we ig
nore it instead of confront it? I hope that one
day our children will ask us with blank stares
how we could have let such a mess go on for
so long.
But I suppose there's nothing more con
ducive to governing than panic, as long as
everyone thinks that the government
knows exactly what to do.That's the key re
ally: get everybody scared enough to rally
behind you, and assure them that if they
just duck-and-cover beneath those desks
they'll be fine. That hypocritical and para
doxical line between hysteria and security
is where we live now, for better or for
worse.
Of course, I do remember a time when
it was popular to be at war, when people
proudly purchased red, white and blue
products by the dozen. Blankets, flags,
posters, tattoos — nothing was too patri
otic for the stars and stripes when the War
on Terror first began. But here we are
three years after "mission accomplished,"
and waving a flag to cheer on America just
isn't as fulfilling. We're not afraid of Iraq
anymore, just disturbed by it. It's too un-

settling to remember that we
haven't done what we set out to
do. So why bother remembering at
all?

It's the same with Osama. No one
(especially no one in government)
wants to remember that we still
haven't captured the old number
one priority. They would rather tell
you about Saddam, or mention how
many Iraqis voted,or drop that Bush
isn't splitting the Katrina relief be
tween Louisiana and Texas. I'm not
saying that capturing bin Laden was

the best thing we could have ever
done,just that we acted like it was. So
I'm surprised that it's not a bigger
deal that we've just given up on him.
Maybe if we bring back freedom
