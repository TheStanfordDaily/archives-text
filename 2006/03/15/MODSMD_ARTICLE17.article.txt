# Solemn Column
## 
### 
So Charlie got fan mail. I never get fan
mail. Well, actually that's not exactly
true, but nobody's emailed about a col
umn for months. Yet last week's piece by my
guest columnist garnered a solid trio of re
sults. TTiis upsets me.
I don't like being ignored. It's bother
some. More accurately, my deep-seated, well
developed and carefully-honed insecurities
require constant attention to keep up to code.
Insecurity is an odd thing. It's not exactly
a valued personal quality, but it does have a
cherished place in the canon of human emo
tion. It's funny. People like laughing at other
people's insecurities.
A significant proportion of comedy is
built around self-depreciation, around hold
ing up your failures and waving them around
furiously for the punters to see.
Such self-flagellation is also a staple of the
opinion journalism practiced by students.
You're just as likely to read about the prob
lems of dating as you are to find a cutting
analysis of the failure of the Democratic
Party to exploit the full potential of their
newfound base.
Obvious reasons for this revolve around
ignorance and the fact that the real world is
indescribably dull compared with the mind
blowing excitement that is Life at Stanford.
The problem with switching to social com
mentary in order to sidestep ignorance is that
ignorance is a dogged follower. For example,
take me.
I really have no place writing about life. I
don't have much more experience at it than
most of my readers (and what there's been
was fairly uneventful). 1 have no guiding phi
losophy to help me or faith to give my obser
vations the veneer of credibility. In fact, I
have nothing to offer that you couldn't get
from a post-coital chat with a well-educated
hooker.
The role of columnists is an odd one in the
world of journalism: opinion has little to do
with the pursuit of truth and an awful lot to
do with its creation.
Now, this sort of thing gives real colum
nists incredible power: When the likes of
Krugman, Dowd or Noonan express an idea
it instantly becomes an object of substance,
even for those who might disagree with the
particular sentiment expressed.
Of course, none of this happens when
Sivanandam, Sheridan, Cannizzaro et al.

grace you with their thoughts. Mostly this is
because our thoughts aren't that interesting
(though if my colleagues are listening: I'm a
big fan of your work), but also because most
of us commit the cardinal (and for that mat
ter Cardinal) columnist sin: Self-Indulgence.
Writing about oneself is a dangerous thing
to do. There is a fine line between illustrating
a problem and whining. A fine line between
using yourself as an example of a broader
point and wallowing in the irrelevant minuti
ae of your life and your worries.
1 am not exceptional. Yet, despite that, I
fall into the trap of believing that I am special
when 1 write each week's Sketch. 1 not only
tell you about my life, I pretend that it's rele
vant. (1 also seem to use "I" a lot; this is not, 1
think, something that 1 should do if I want to
ensure that 1 can maintain that I am the aloof
commentator that 1 like to pretend that I
am).
Which brings us nicely to a little puzzle:
Why are you reading this?
This column really has nothing to offer to
you. In all honesty 1 write this mostly as a
cathartic exercise. It's sort of like discount
therapy: Instead of lying on an analyst's
couch waxing and whining about my life, I get
to lie on my couch and do the same thing for
free to a larger audience.
Still, maybe the constant clamoring for at
tention serves a nobler purpose. Perhaps my
complaints are illustrative rather than specif
ic. Perchance I am serving a greater need by
bitching about my life. But I doubt it.
On the other hand, while banality may be
the curse of serious commentary, it is the
lifeblood of student journalism. My fellow
commentators and 1 may not be heading for
a Pulitzer anytime soon, but hey, at least
we're doing our job.
