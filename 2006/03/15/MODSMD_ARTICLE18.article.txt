South Dakota's abortion policy
makes sense
Yes, South Dakota has electricity.
TTiis is the response 1 have had to give to
not just one person in the last couple of days.
My home state also has running water, traffic
lights and the Internet.
This past week South Dakota Gov. Mike
Rounds signed legislation that virtually bans
abortion. Suddenly my home has become the
hot button topic of conversation.
As a former South Dakota resident and a
Stanford-educated, 20-somcthing female, I
am coming to the defense of my state.

The first criticism appears to fall on the
legislature. "How could they do this?" cries
the pseudo-intellectual San Francisco hip
ster.
The occupational makeup of the legisla
ture reflects the occupational makeup of the
state — including more than a dozen farm
ers. multiple teachers and the obligatory at
torneys. Because it is comprised of average
working people instead of the millionaire
politicians who comprise the legislature in
California, my legislature is better able to re
flect the opinions of the general population.
So, this bill must be a vast right
wing conspiracy, right?
ITie bill was introduced by a De
mocrat. By a woman. Sen. Julie
Bartling is pro-life and a Democrat.
Enter the accusations that
Bartling is betraying her party.
Many of South Dakota's Democ
rats are socially conservative. They
are Catholics or Lutherans who sup
port farm subsidies but have
adamant beliefs that abortion is tak
ing innocent life. To many South
Dakotans, Democrat and liberal are
not synonymous.
My favorite criticism is that we as
a state must be unintelligent.
For a moment, use your imagina
tion and picture yourself as a pro
lifer. You believe that every day a
baby or two is being legally killed in
your state. You probably want to
stop this immediately, but it appears
to be a federal issue.
Suddenly there are two new U.S.
Supreme Court Justices who haven't
been tested on the abortion issue.
You could wait for someone else to
bring it up — or you could pass a law
that will undoubtedly be challenged
and taken to the new court.
This reasoning has all the mak
ings of a strategy.
1 am not going to change your po
sition on abortion. But perhaps I
gave you deeper insight into the cul
ture and mindset that led to the pas
sage of the ban.

Stanford ignores other study
abroad programs
In "Life on the OSP waitlist''
(Mar. 8), the Editorial Board did not
address the greater inequities in
Stanford's overseas programs when
they chose to focus on the small
number of students jilted by a
process that is not very selective.lTie
problem is not availability.
If a student wants to study abroad
there are many more options outside
of Stanford's Overseas Study Pro
gram than there are within it. Stan
ford's nine overseas centers cannot
possibly meet the study-abroad
goals of all students. Even if Stanford

centers could accommodate any un
dergraduate who applied, some stu
dents would still opt to attend other
programs.
The issue, then, is not the selec
tiveness of Stanford's overseas pro
grams, but rather Stanford's attitude
toward non-Stanford programs.
Stanford will never he able to offer
everything, and instead of striving
toward universal availability, Stan
ford should grant the same financial
aid and housing privileges to stu
dents who want to take advantage of
other abroad opportunities. Stu
dents shouldn't be limited to Stan
ford programs because choosing an
other program would adversely af
fect their aid packages.

Proposed trail will hurt
residents
Laura Carwile's article "Pro
posed Trails Awaiting Approval"
(Mar. 9) made Stanford's idea of
placing a hiking trail alongside
Alpine Road look like a nice,simple
community-directed gesture that
will be welcomed everywhere. This
couldn't be farther from the truth.
This hiking trail is a poorly
planned project that will be very un
safe if constructed. From the exit off
interstate 280, Alpine Road runs 1.1
miles to the intersection of Santa
Cruz Avenue and Junipero Serra
Boulevard. Up to 31,(KM) cars travel
this two-lane stretch each day.
Quite simply, there is no room
for a 12- to 16-foot wide trail along
this route — especially on the half
mile stretch between Piers and
Stowe Lanes. This is Stanford
Weekend Acres, which most com
muters on Alpine Road probably
have little or no idea exists. Stan
ford Weekend Acres numbers some
255 residents, 120 homes and up to
200 vehicles.
Now Stanford wants to add bicy
clists, runners, hikers and motheis
with baby carriages to the list of cars,
people and assorted objects that we
now dodge as we enter and leave our
homes. It is absurd to place a pedes
trian trail in the midst of these al
ready busy intersections. Let's hope
San Mateo County sees the light
soon.

ster.
The occupational makeup of the legisla
ture reflects the occupational makeup of the
state — including more than a dozen farm
ers. multiple teachers and the obligatory at
torneys. Because it is comprised of average
working people instead of the millionaire
politicians who comprise the legislature in
California, my legislature is better able to re
flect the opinions of the general population.
So, this bill must be a vast right
wing conspiracy, right?
ITie bill was introduced by a De
mocrat. By a woman. Sen. Julie
Bartling is pro-life and a Democrat.
Enter the accusations that
Bartling is betraying her party.
Many of South Dakota's Democ
rats are socially conservative. They
are Catholics or Lutherans who sup
port farm subsidies but have
adamant beliefs that abortion is tak
ing innocent life. To many South
Dakotans, Democrat and liberal are
not synonymous.
My favorite criticism is that we as
a state must be unintelligent.
For a moment, use your imagina
tion and picture yourself as a pro
lifer. You believe that every day a
baby or two is being legally killed in
your state. You probably want to
stop this immediately, but it appears
to be a federal issue.
Suddenly there are two new U.S.
Supreme Court Justices who haven't
been tested on the abortion issue.
You could wait for someone else to
bring it up — or you could pass a law
that will undoubtedly be challenged
and taken to the new court.
This reasoning has all the mak
ings of a strategy.
1 am not going to change your po
sition on abortion. But perhaps I
gave you deeper insight into the cul
ture and mindset that led to the pas
sage of the ban.

Stanford ignores other study
abroad programs
In "Life on the OSP waitlist''
(Mar. 8), the Editorial Board did not
address the greater inequities in
Stanford's overseas programs when
they chose to focus on the small
number of students jilted by a
process that is not very selective.lTie
problem is not availability.
If a student wants to study abroad
there are many more options outside
of Stanford's Overseas Study Pro
gram than there are within it. Stan
ford's nine overseas centers cannot
possibly meet the study-abroad
goals of all students. Even if Stanford

centers could accommodate any un
dergraduate who applied, some stu
dents would still opt to attend other
programs.
The issue, then, is not the selec
tiveness of Stanford's overseas pro
grams, but rather Stanford's attitude
toward non-Stanford programs.
Stanford will never he able to offer
everything, and instead of striving
toward universal availability, Stan
ford should grant the same financial
aid and housing privileges to stu
dents who want to take advantage of
other abroad opportunities. Stu
dents shouldn't be limited to Stan
ford programs because choosing an
other program would adversely af
fect their aid packages.

Proposed trail will hurt
residents
Laura Carwile's article "Pro
posed Trails Awaiting Approval"
(Mar. 9) made Stanford's idea of
placing a hiking trail alongside
Alpine Road look like a nice,simple
community-directed gesture that
will be welcomed everywhere. This
couldn't be farther from the truth.
This hiking trail is a poorly
planned project that will be very un
safe if constructed. From the exit off
interstate 280, Alpine Road runs 1.1
miles to the intersection of Santa
Cruz Avenue and Junipero Serra
Boulevard. Up to 31,(KM) cars travel
this two-lane stretch each day.
Quite simply, there is no room
for a 12- to 16-foot wide trail along
this route — especially on the half
mile stretch between Piers and
Stowe Lanes. This is Stanford
Weekend Acres, which most com
muters on Alpine Road probably
have little or no idea exists. Stan
ford Weekend Acres numbers some
255 residents, 120 homes and up to
200 vehicles.
Now Stanford wants to add bicy
clists, runners, hikers and motheis
with baby carriages to the list of cars,
people and assorted objects that we
now dodge as we enter and leave our
homes. It is absurd to place a pedes
trian trail in the midst of these al
ready busy intersections. Let's hope
San Mateo County sees the light
soon.
