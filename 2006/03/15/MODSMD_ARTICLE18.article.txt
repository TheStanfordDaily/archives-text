South Dakota's abortion policy
makes sense
Yes, South Dakota has electricity.
TTiis is the response 1 have had to give to
not just one person in the last couple of days.
My home state also has running water, traffic
lights and the Internet.
This past week South Dakota Gov. Mike
Rounds signed legislation that virtually bans
abortion. Suddenly my home has become the
hot button topic of conversation.
As a former South Dakota resident and a
Stanford-educated, 20-somcthing female, I
am coming to the defense of my state.

The first criticism appears to fall on the
legislature. "How could they do this?" cries
the pseudo-intellectual San Francisco hip
ster.
The occupational makeup of the legisla
ture reflects the occupational makeup of the
state â€” including more than a dozen farm
ers. multiple teachers and the obligatory at
torneys. Because it is comprised of average
working people instead of the millionaire
politicians who comprise the legislature in
California, my legislature is better able to re
flect the opinions of the general population.
