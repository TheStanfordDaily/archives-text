# All slates secure ballot
## Six of 43 Senate candidates fall short of required signatures 
### JAMES HOHMANN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
All 11 executive and class presidential slates
seeking a place on the ASSU ballot for the April
elections secured the minimum number of signa
tures needed to do so, each surpassing the thresh
old by Monday's 11:59 p.m. deadline. Six of the 43
students who filed to run for Undergraduate
Senate, however, are out of the race, having with
drawn or failed to secure the needed number of
signatures.
Candidates wishing to appear on the ballot
had to collect 100 or more signatures, depending
on the office sought. This year's process was

"the online petitioning system certainly compli

candidate/slate that made an earnest effort to
rack up signatures shouldn't have had any prob

One candidate new to the process, freshman
Osarugue Michelle Odemwingie, said she and
her running mates on the iSlate ticket found the
new system easy and time efficient.

"Switching to the online method from my un
derstanding was way easier than the handwritten
method in the past," she said. "This also gave peo
ple a chance to sincerely decide if they wanted to
petition for you and not feel the pressure of being
face to face with a candidate."
Others said they found it inconvenient to ask
supporters to go online to sign.

"Although I understand the verification rea
soning behind the online petition process, I find
it very intrusive to go to people and say 'Hey,sign
my petition on your computer,'" said executive
candidate Elizabeth Heng, who is running with
fellow junior Lauren Graham."Luckily,the exec-
