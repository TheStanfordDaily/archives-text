# All slates secure ballot
## Six of 43 Senate candidates fall short of required signatures 
### JAMES HOHMANN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
All 11 executive and class presidential slates
seeking a place on the ASSU ballot for the April
elections secured the minimum number of signa
tures needed to do so, each surpassing the thresh
old by Monday's 11:59 p.m. deadline. Six of the 43
students who filed to run for Undergraduate
Senate, however, are out of the race, having with
drawn or failed to secure the needed number of
signatures.
Candidates wishing to appear on the ballot
had to collect 100 or more signatures, depending
on the office sought. This year's process was
unique because candidates could only seek on
line signatures for their petitions. While none of
the slates struggled to meet the minimum re
quirement, they had different experiences with
the new e-petition system.
"We hunted down every last signature," said
executive candidate Allan Phillips, a junior. "The
petitioning process was a bit of an irritant as we
were not able to leverage our considerable com
manding presences to as great a degree as we are
accustomed to."
Senior class president candidate Faris Ali Mo
hiuddin, part of the MARVEL slate, said that
"the online petitioning system certainly compli
cated matters," but added that "any
candidate/slate that made an earnest effort to
rack up signatures shouldn't have had any prob
lems hitting their benchmark."
One candidate new to the process, freshman
Osarugue Michelle Odemwingie, said she and
her running mates on the iSlate ticket found the
new system easy and time efficient.

"Switching to the online method from my un
derstanding was way easier than the handwritten
method in the past," she said. "This also gave peo
ple a chance to sincerely decide if they wanted to
petition for you and not feel the pressure of being
face to face with a candidate."
Others said they found it inconvenient to ask
supporters to go online to sign.

"Although I understand the verification rea
soning behind the online petition process, I find
it very intrusive to go to people and say 'Hey,sign
my petition on your computer,'" said executive
candidate Elizabeth Heng, who is running with
fellow junior Lauren Graham."Luckily,the exec-

utive slate only has 200 signatures. It
must be incredibly difficult for stu
dent groups to get the necessary 700
to 1,500 signatures."
"We reached the 100-petition
mark within a few days," said fresh
man Andy Mo of the sophomore
class iSlate ticket."lt was a fairly easy
task to accomplish."
Freshman Patrick Cordova, who
is running for sophomore class pres
ident on The Cure ticket, said that
the outreach process for online sig
natures helps "put yourself on the
radar screen."
With their names officially on the
ballot, slates for executive and class
president are starting to strategize
for the campaign ahead.
ITiree slates will vie for executive
ASSU office.
"We blasted well past the mini
mum signature threshold with plenty
of time to spare before the petition

deadline," said junior Chris Nguyen,
current chair of the Senate, who is
running with junior Marc Rillera.
The Chappie slate took a more
lighthearted approach in an email to
The Daily about the election.
"Our campaign will be focused on
finding the student body's raw nerve
of discontent with the status quo of
the ASSU and playing that like a fid
dle reel," wrote junior Allan Phillips,
who adds "Rumrunner" in place of a
middle name. "When the walls come
crashing down, we expect it to be
very clear who would build the best
new walls (us) if indeed we need
walls at all."
The executive slates this year are
not balanced by gender or race as has
been seen in the recent past. Two of
the slates are made up of men and
the other of two women. For their
part, the executive candidates said
the lack of diversity on their tickets
should not be an important issue.
"I'm not sure why all the slates
are single-gender," Nguyen said. "1
believe Stanford students have
reached the point where gender
doesn't matter; the only thing stu

dents care about is who can do the
best job."
"I do not think gender balance is
that important," seconded Heng. "I
believe what matters most is the
pairing of candidates, how well they
compliment each other and how well
they understand the student body's
needs."
Other class president candidates
stressed diversity in their early ap
peals, offering a glimpse into a po
tential issue during the campaign.
"We represent diversity in our
candidates: we represent east and
west campus and our interests and
backgrounds are diverse and inter
national," said freshman Casey
Means of The Golden Ticket, a soph
omore class presidential slate.
Two slates will go head-to-head
for both the senior and junior class
presidencies. There are four sopho
more class tickets on the ballot.
Candidates from the slates ex
pressed energy and enthusiasm for
the race ahead.
"We are hoping to bring new en
ergy and ideas to the junior class
leadership." said Molly Tokaz. part of

the 40-Year Old Juniors: We Do It
for the Kids ticket. "Our slate hails
from a wide variety of groups on
campus in hopes of representing the
interests of the junior class as a
whole."
Tokaz and her running mates will
face off against Daniel Zavala and
his Party of Five presidential slate.
"We look forward to a fun and
rewarding campaign ahead for
spring quarter and an opportunity
to represent our junior class for
some really exciting and (in the case
of service activities) helpful events,"
he said.
Candidates are not officially al
lowed to begin seeking votes until
campaign week starts on April 5 at
12:01 a.m. Not wanting to violate the
rule against early campaigning, can
didates sought to paint broad sketch
es about their potential agendas and
their slate's strategies to win student
support.
"My running mates and 1 plan on
talking over break and then we'll
begin to get our names and ideas out
there to the frosh voters when we all
get back," said freshman Johnny Mc-

Cormick of the iSlate ticket.
Other slates will need to work
through some logistical challenges as
they plan for the upcoming cam
paign.
"With the petitioning process be
hind us, we're going to focus on refin
ing our platform and goals for the
senior class next year," Mohiuddin
said. "Campaign content aside, we're
fleshing out the logistics for early
April. One of our slate members is
returning from abroad and another
is departing for the spring; so we plan
to spend some time coordinating our
individual roles for the coming cam
paign."
Students can expect another
heated and intense flurry of activity
during campaign week again this
year, candidates said.
"Campaigning at Stanford is one
of the most intense and fun things
I've ever experienced," said junior
class presidential candidate Brett
Hammon. "The Party of Five's strat
egy is to emphasize our experience
because we take this job very seri
ously, but we certainly don't take
ourselves too seriously."
