## Student Housing committed to conserving energy and water 
### LARRY HOFFMAN RODGER WHITNEY 
A recent Daily editorial challenged both the campus
at-large and Student Housing to do more to conserve en
ergy. We are writing to clarify some misperceptions in the
editorial and to describe very proactive current efforts, as
well as highlight a long-standing commitment to energy
and water conservation initiatives over the past 16 years
by Student Housing.
Since 1998, Housing has been working through the
University's Energy and Water Conservation Program.
Incentives from this program for retrofit projects have

cut water consumption by 50,000,000 gallons and saved
over 2.(MX),(XK) kilowatt-hours in 2005 alone.
Longer-term efforts of water and energy-use retrofits
undertaken by Student Housing in all undergraduate resi
dences over past years include: Installing low-flow shower
heads and sink faucets; replacing 5-gallon toilets with 1.6-
gallon toilets; converting laundry machines to energy effi
cient, low-flow units; replacing all student room incandes
cent fixtures with fluorescent ones;adding motion sensors to
common areas; replacing kitchen appliances with Energy
Star models in row kitchens; and upgrading mechanical
equipment with smart controls for
building heating systems.
In addition, upgrades made to all
Escondido Village graduate apart
ments include: Weatherizing over
800 apartments; replacing single
pane with double-pane windows
(currently in progress); retrofitting
interior lights from incandescent to
fluorescent lamps, installing exterior
lighting with photo cells for auto
matic shut off; and installing low flow
toilets throughout EV and other
areas of graduate housing.
Student Housing also encour
ages students to become aware of
energy and water uses through a
number of highly publicized educa
tional posters, fliers and the annual

Energy Bowl and Water Derby. A
new and exciting project, the new
Green Dorm, partners Student
Housing with faculty and students
from the Engineering and other de
partments to build a sustainable
green residence where students can
live and learn from the experience
as well as perform research on the
building. This new Row house is
currently going through University
approval processes and fund-rais
ing efforts. It represents a major
long-term Student Housing and
University investment in sustain
ability and energy conservation in
frastructure in new housing con
struction.
There's also a very important di
rect benefit of managing utility
usage and costs by continually in
vesting in energy and water-saving
improvements: Student Housing's
ability to keep room rates lower
over time in spite of continued utili

ty rate increase pressures. This off
sets the large consumption reduc
tions we have been experiencing
through the initiatives described
above.
While there is always more that
can be done by all of us to conserve
energy conservation and reduce util
ity consumption over time. Student
Housing — partnering with Stan
ford's Energy and Water Conserva
tion programs — is pleased with ac
complishments and efforts to date.
Working together with environmen
tally conscious Stanford students is
an important investment for the fu
ture of all students and their costs of
living on campus.
