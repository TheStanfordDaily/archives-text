# The 						Stanford Review respects Native Americans
## 
### BENJAMIN GUTHRIE 
I am disappointed by Daily columnist Adam Bad
Wound's libelous accusation that the Review is racist
("Racist Review?". Mar. 8). After the Review published
an article that included a forgotten perspective in the
debate, that of Timm "Prince Lightfoot" Williams, he
suddenly thinks the Review is racist. For the record, no
body at the Review believes the Indian mascot should
return.
I lowever. we do not think the subject is so taboo that
it cannot be discussed in a civil manner. We also recognize
that there are many diverse perspectives from Native

Americans and non-Native Americans alike that are not
being heard. In the upcoming issue of the Review, we will
be publishing a comprehensive history of the Indian mas
cot as well as two nuanced commentary pieces by Fea
tures Editor Luukas lives and Guest Contributor Kim
ball Bighorse.
In the past, the Review has sometimes used a cartoon
called the "Chief," which has been misinterpreted as a jab
at Native Americans. The purpose of this satirical por
trayal was to highlight the absurdity of those who place
excessive emphasis on the Indian mascot. Joe Fairbanks,
a Native American currently work
ing on public policy issues affecting
Native Americans and a former edi
tor at the Review who supported the
use of the "Chief," wrote in a letter
that the Daily failed to print:
"The problems facing Native
communities throughout this coun
try are much more serious than a car
toon or school mascot. And, despite
attempts by cynics claiming victim
ization, none of these problems are
caused directly or indirectly by the
use of those mascots. My tribe, along
with others in my state of Oklahoma,
is plagued by things like drug and al
cohol dependency, substandard edu
cation. deadbeat fathers, and ram
pant corruption in the tribal councils.
Those are just a few of the dozens of
problems we are addressing today.
Any attempt to relate these prob-

lems to the use of Indian mascots is
silly."
The debate at Stanford is not
whether to bring back the mascot —
the Indian mascot is long gone. Nor
is the debate whether anyone has the
right to depict the image of an Indian
— the right is called freedom of
speech and is protected at Stanford
through Corry v. Stanford in 1995.
The debate at Stanford is now thus:
Under what conditions, if any.should
anyone in the Stanford community
depict cartoon images of Native
Americans?
First, one must recognize a pre
sumption in favor of the people clos
est to the issue because they are
members of the community using
the mascot and their own heritage is
being depicted. Controversy may
still remain about whether a certain
depiction is ennobling or degrading.
It may not be the case that a mascot
itself is undignified but that only cer
tain types of portrayals are undigni
fied. TTien the problem becomes a
matter of judging the particulars

rather than making categorical state
ments. Indeed there was much con
troversy in the 1970s on this point,
some of which the Review's history
of the Indian mascot feature will
bring to light.
Adam Bad Wound categorically
rejects all Indian mascots. As a re
sult. he cannot tolerate nuanced
views or dissenting opinions. He
would prefer to suppress the views of
any publication that might acknowl
edge the mere existence of other
points of view. He literally recom
mends that "intelligent Stanford stu
dents stop reading The Stanford Re
view," despite the fact that the Re
view's Editorial Board does not sup
port the use of Indian caricatures. If
you are looking for a civil debate, in
stead of Adam Bad Wound's con
ceited monologue, you will have to
turn to the Review.
