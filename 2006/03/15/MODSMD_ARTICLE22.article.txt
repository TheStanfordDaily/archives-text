## Text edits skew Indian history 
### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
Every six years, California reviews
the content of its social studies text
books. On Wednesday, March 8, the
State Board of Education voted 8-0,
with two abstentions, to reject a series
of additional changes to sixth grade
textbooks co-proposed by the Vedic
Foundation (VF) and the Hindu Ed
ucation Foundation (HEF) that
would have inaccurately skewed the
way ancient Indian history is present
ed to students.
Three Stanford students — senior
Neepa Acharya, sophomore Laksh
mi Karra and graduate student
Ashish Chadha — spoke in Sacra
mento in opposition to the proposed
changes, which would have added
factually flawed depictions of
women, minorities, migrational histo
ry and polytheism. As March 8 was
also coincidentally International
Women's Day, Acharya and Karra, as
representatives of Saheli — a Stan
ford feminist coalition of 15 South
Asian undergraduate women — fo
cused their arguments on the strug
gles of women in ancient India and
throughout the world.
"The vote of the Board of Educa
tion is a victory because it will allow
young children to read scholarly
work that is factually accurate," said
Chadha, who, as a doctoral candidate
in the Department of Cultural and
Social Anthropology, studies the
archeology of ancient India. "The
proposed changes by right-wing na
tionalists in India would have insert
ed ahistorical data into California
textbooks and taught young children
incorrect narratives of India."
According to Chadha, also an ac
tive member in the Bay Area com
munity group Friends of South Asia
(FOSA), the right-wing political
groups in India tried to insert similar
inaccuracies into Indian school text
books in the mid-1990'5. ITiese at
tempts were ultimately foiled when a
new political regime assumed power
in 2004. He sees the work of the VF
and HEF in California as an "off
shoot of what happened in India."
"California has served as a battle
ground of what might happen in
India later on," Chadha continued.
"Since fundamentalist Hindu nation

alist groups were unable to push for
ward their agenda in California, they
will have a very difficult time insert
ing their ahistorical data into text
books in India. Thus, the decision by
the Board of Education in California
is very important because it will have
powerful repercussions in India. 1 re
alized this fact and that is in part why
1 became involved with speaking out
against the proposed changes to Cal
ifornia textbooks."
Acharya noted that the contro
versy greatly affects South Asian-
Americans growing up in California
who read about their history in exist
ing textbooks.
"Across America, sixth-grade stu
dents with any sort of South Asian
background are put on the spot to ex

plain and interpret their cultures and
identities to supplement the obvious
gaps and inadequacies of the text
book materials and to supplant any
biases that their teachers may have,"
Acharya said. "California has made
amazing strides in incorporating
South Asian faces into their text
books. Yet at the same time, it is im
perative that the history of ancient
India depicted is factual. Changes
should not be made in the texts so as
to drive any sort of censorship or po
litical agenda."
For Acharya, the debate at the
State Board of Education meeting
highlighted the fundamental prob
lem in the way textbooks are written
to "censor, rewrite and whitewash
history."

"Indian scholars, like myself, be
lieve that no matter how other cul
tures may be discussed, sixth graders
should be presented with factual ev
idence about Ancient India,"
Acharya said. "In my opinion, we
need interest groups of scholars and
community groups of concerned in
dividuals to take interest in every
single chapter of school textbooks in
order to call for changes to the way in
which textbooks engage in histories
of injustice and inequality. It is only
by doing this that we can fully un
mask the unseen faces that have
been missing from history books
across the country."
