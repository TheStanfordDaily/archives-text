# Women pleased with No. 3 seed
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
Though it came on a Monday this
year, the women's NCAA selection
process once again proved rife with con
troversy.
One year after being shocked with a
No. 2 seed, despite being the top-ranked
team in both major polls, the No. 13
Stanford women's basketball team was
happy that this year someone else was
the biggest seeding victim.
"I'm never too relaxed when I am
watching that show," Coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "[Creating the bracket] a
really tough job. There's always contro
versy, and this year it's about Tennessee
being a two-seed and Ohio State being a
one-seed. Honestly. I'm just glad none of
it was about us."
Stanford (23-7, 15-3 Pac-10) is now
off to Denver, Colo, as the No. 3 seed in
the San Antonio regional. The Cardinal
will play their first opponent. No. 14-
seed Southeast Missouri State, this Sat
urday.
The Redhawks (22-8,15-4 Ohio Val
ley Conference) earned their first-ever
NCAA Tournament appearance via au
tomatic bid, sealing their ticket to the
dance with a 71-50 victory over Ten
nessee Tech.
With a victory, Stanford would play
No. 6-seed Florida State or No. 11-seed
Louisiana Tech Monday.
"We're excited about Denver," Van-
Derveer said. "I think our fans can get
there economically and easy. We're ex
cited about the No. 3 seed.The most im
portant thing is were healthy and excit
ed to play."
Playing closer to home —Denver
and TUcson are the only sites of first- and
second-round games in the Western
United States —is a double-edged
sword. It means less travel time as the
Cardinal deal with Dead Week and fi
nals, but it also means dealing with an al-

"I've trained at the U.S. Olympic

the summer, and as an incoming fresh

the same venue," sophomore guard
Candice Wiggins said. "It shouldn't be a
big factor that we have to worry about."

"LSU and Oklahoma are great

Courtney [Paris] on USA teams the last
two years, and she's having a great fresh
man year. If we do happen to get to the
Sweet Sixteen and meet Oklahoma, it
will be kind of like playing UConn last
year, and the experience of doing it last
year will help."

into the tournament, they will need to

excel down low. The Sooners are lead by freshman cen
ter Courtney Paris, son of ex-San Francisco 49er Bubba
Paris, who has established herself as one of the nation's
premier inside players in only one season (21.3 ppg, 15.1
rpg)-
LSU also has one of the nation's premier interior
players in sophomore center Sylvia Fowles.
"It's really to early to worry about possible match
ups down the road," junior center Brooke Smith said.
"If we don't take care of business in the early rounds,
then we won't see any of those great players. But there
are some great centers in our region."
Reduced expectations from last year, where Stan
ford was among the four or five National title favorites,
stem from a change in personnel, but may benefit the
Cardinal.
"Honestly, 1 don't feel the pressure that 1 did last
year," VanDerveer said. "I don't know if that's a good or
a bad thing,but I hope we can play relaxed and excited."
One of the bigger stories on the West Coast was the
added respect the Pac-10 received. In last year's NCAA
tournament, all five of the Pac-10 teams won their first
round games and two teams, Stanford and Arizona
State made it to the Sweet Sixteen.
The conference had the fifth highest RPI this year,
and was awarded six bids: Stanford. No. 4-seed Arizona
State.conference tournament champion and N0.5-seed
UCLA, No. 8-seed USC, No. 9-seed Washington, and,
most surprisingly. No. 10-seed California.
"The loudest cheer of the day came when Cal went
up on the board," VanDerveer said. "We knew UCLA
and Arizona State would get in, and we expected USC
to make it, but everyone was so excited about getting six
teams."
Playing in a deeper conference, and suffering a stun
ning overtime loss to UCLA in the Pac-lOTournament
title game could actually pay dividends in the long run
for the Card. The coaching staff hopes the loss will help
eliminate the freshman moments that Jillian Harmon
and Rosalyn Gold-Onwude each displayed in the late
moments as Stanford blew a nine-point lead in just min
utes.
"It was a long week," Wiggins said. "Watching video
was like getting a root canal, it was really painful.
"The Pac-lOTournament was like a dress rehearsal,"
Wiggins added. "Your season doesn't end, but you are
in that one-and-done atmosphere. I think the freshman
have a bigger experience [because of the loss]."

to make it, but everyone was so excited about getting six
teams."
Playing in a deeper conference, and suffering a stun
ning overtime loss to UCLA in the Pac-lOTournament
title game could actually pay dividends in the long run
for the Card. The coaching staff hopes the loss will help
eliminate the freshman moments that Jillian Harmon
and Rosalyn Gold-Onwude each displayed in the late
moments as Stanford blew a nine-point lead in just min
utes.
"It was a long week," Wiggins said. "Watching video
was like getting a root canal, it was really painful.
"The Pac-lOTournament was like a dress rehearsal,"
Wiggins added. "Your season doesn't end, but you are
in that one-and-done atmosphere. I think the freshman
have a bigger experience [because of the loss]."
Though it came on a Monday this
year, the women's NCAA selection
process once again proved rife with con
troversy.
One year after being shocked with a
No. 2 seed, despite being the top-ranked
team in both major polls, the No. 13
Stanford women's basketball team was
happy that this year someone else was
the biggest seeding victim.
"I'm never too relaxed when I am
watching that show," Coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "[Creating the bracket] a
really tough job. There's always contro
versy, and this year it's about Tennessee
being a two-seed and Ohio State being a
one-seed. Honestly. I'm just glad none of
it was about us."
Stanford (23-7, 15-3 Pac-10) is now
off to Denver, Colo, as the No. 3 seed in
the San Antonio regional. The Cardinal
will play their first opponent. No. 14-
seed Southeast Missouri State, this Sat
urday.
The Redhawks (22-8,15-4 Ohio Val
ley Conference) earned their first-ever
NCAA Tournament appearance via au
tomatic bid, sealing their ticket to the
dance with a 71-50 victory over Ten
nessee Tech.
With a victory, Stanford would play
No. 6-seed Florida State or No. 11-seed
Louisiana Tech Monday.
"We're excited about Denver," Van-
Derveer said. "I think our fans can get
there economically and easy. We're ex
cited about the No. 3 seed.The most im
portant thing is were healthy and excit
ed to play."
Playing closer to home —Denver

LSU also has one of the nation's premier interior
players in sophomore center Sylvia Fowles.
"It's really to early to worry about possible match
ups down the road," junior center Brooke Smith said.
"If we don't take care of business in the early rounds,
then we won't see any of those great players. But there
are some great centers in our region."
Reduced expectations from last year, where Stan
ford was among the four or five National title favorites,
stem from a change in personnel, but may benefit the
Cardinal.
"Honestly, 1 don't feel the pressure that 1 did last
year," VanDerveer said. "I don't know if that's a good or
a bad thing,but I hope we can play relaxed and excited."
One of the bigger stories on the West Coast was the
added respect the Pac-10 received. In last year's NCAA
tournament, all five of the Pac-10 teams won their first
round games and two teams, Stanford and Arizona
State made it to the Sweet Sixteen.
The conference had the fifth highest RPI this year,
and was awarded six bids: Stanford. No. 4-seed Arizona
State.conference tournament champion and N0.5-seed
UCLA, No. 8-seed USC, No. 9-seed Washington, and,
most surprisingly. No. 10-seed California.
"The loudest cheer of the day came when Cal went
up on the board," VanDerveer said. "We knew UCLA
