# Women pleased with No. 3 seed
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
Though it came on a Monday this
year, the women's NCAA selection
process once again proved rife with con
troversy.
One year after being shocked with a
No. 2 seed, despite being the top-ranked
team in both major polls, the No. 13
Stanford women's basketball team was
happy that this year someone else was
the biggest seeding victim.
"I'm never too relaxed when I am
watching that show," Coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "[Creating the bracket] a
really tough job. There's always contro
versy, and this year it's about Tennessee
being a two-seed and Ohio State being a
one-seed. Honestly. I'm just glad none of
it was about us."
Stanford (23-7, 15-3 Pac-10) is now
off to Denver, Colo, as the No. 3 seed in
the San Antonio regional. The Cardinal
will play their first opponent. No. 14-
seed Southeast Missouri State, this Sat
urday.
The Redhawks (22-8,15-4 Ohio Val
ley Conference) earned their first-ever
NCAA Tournament appearance via au
tomatic bid, sealing their ticket to the
dance with a 71-50 victory over Ten
nessee Tech.
With a victory, Stanford would play
No. 6-seed Florida State or No. 11-seed
Louisiana Tech Monday.
"We're excited about Denver," Van-
Derveer said. "I think our fans can get
there economically and easy. We're ex
cited about the No. 3 seed.The most im
portant thing is were healthy and excit
ed to play."
Playing closer to home —Denver
and TUcson are the only sites of first- and
second-round games in the Western
United States —is a double-edged
sword. It means less travel time as the
Cardinal deal with Dead Week and fi
nals, but it also means dealing with an al-

"I've trained at the U.S. Olympic
training center in Colorado Springs in
the summer, and as an incoming fresh
man, we played in Denver last season at
the same venue," sophomore guard
Candice Wiggins said. "It shouldn't be a
big factor that we have to worry about."
The biggest story nationally saw
overall top seed North Carolina placed
in arguably the most difficult region,
Cleveland. And though an ESPN head
line dubbed Cleveland "the Region of
Doom." Stanford's San Antonio region
is not without its challenges.
Senior guard Seimone Augustus, last
year's Wooden Award winner, will lead
top-seed LSU (27-3, 13-1 SEC) in its
quest for Boston and the Final Four.
Big 12 champ Oklahoma (29-4,16-0
Big-12) is Denver's No. 2 seed, looming
as a potential Sweet Sixteen matchup for

"LSU and Oklahoma are great
teams." Wiggins said. "I've played with
Courtney [Paris] on USA teams the last
two years, and she's having a great fresh
man year. If we do happen to get to the
Sweet Sixteen and meet Oklahoma, it
will be kind of like playing UConn last
year, and the experience of doing it last
year will help."

into the tournament, they will need to
