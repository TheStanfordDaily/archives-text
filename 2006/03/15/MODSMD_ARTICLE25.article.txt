limiting the Trojans to one hit while Milone gave up two
runs early in the game.
A balk and a wildpitch in the bottom of the fifth in
ning. however, opened the door for USC, as Darin Vieira
(two hits, three RBI) scored on a sacrifice fly with two
outs.The sixth inning saw the Trojans go up 3-2 but it was
the eighth which was most damaging to the Card.
Up 4-2,* the Trojans managed a single and a walk
against sophomore Erik Davis. Daniel Perales, who hurt
the Card on Saturday, was intentionally walked and
Vieira came up to the plate with one out. His double to
centerfield cleared the bases.
Stanford's only runs of the game came from a left
field RBI hit by senior shortstop Chris Minakcr in the
third and on freshman Brent Milleville's homerun in the
fourth. Milleville's dinger over the 395 mark in center
field was one of a few offensive highlights in the game.
Stanford went down quietly. 1-2-3, in the final four
frames.
Stanford finished its first road trip 4-4, as Milone
outlasted Stringer by one inning and Stanford's
bullpen gave up four runs to a powerful USC lineup
after Stringer left in the sixth.
The Cardinal got out of a jam in the bottom of
the ninth in Friday's series opener. With one out,
senior Peter Duda's third hit of the night was the
first of three consecutive hits in the final frame.
Sophomore righthander Erik Davis recorded his
first season save, but not before the Trojans scored
one run and loaded the bases. With the tying run at

third, however, USC's Hector Estrella hit into a
fielder's choice for the final out.
The final-inning threat made senior second base
man Chris Lewis the hero of the night. Though
swinging only .211 on the season, Lewis came
through for the Cardinal with a two-out, two RBI
double down the left field line in the eighth to put
Stanford up 7-s.The Cardinal had held a 4-! lead be
fore the Trojans tied it 5-5 in the seventh.
Senior Greg Reynolds (1-1,3.11 ERA) went six
innings, giving up seven hits and three runs. Sopho
more Nolan Gallagher (2-0,1.69) was the second re

liever of the seventh inning, and the righty got the
win.
Saturday's blowout was ugly, hut the rookies
made solid efforts toward making the final score a
bit more respectable. The Trojan offense pounded
Cardinal pitching from the start and drove senior
starter Matt Manship (0-2, 5.92) from the mound
with a six-run second inning. It was the
righthander's shortest start of his career (1 2/3 in
nings).
The pounding continued in the fourth, fifth and
sixth innings, putting the game out of reach at 14-4
before the Cardinal freshman scored three RBIs in
the ninth.
The Trojans tallied a season-high 20 hits in the af
ternoon game and the Los Angeles team was led by
Daniel Perales and Johnny Bowden. Perales (.406
batting average) was 5-for-5 with two doubles, one
home run and four RBI, while Bowden contributed
five RBI. Ryan Cook earned the win in 5 1/3 innings
of work where the Cardinal mustered eight hits and
three runs.
The team will now take a one-week break for fi
nals and ease into Pac-10 play at Sunken Diamond
on Saturday, March 25. Washington State visits for a
three-game series Saturday through Monday.
The Cougars went on a 13-2 run earlier this sea
son before splitting two games with Chicago State
last week. WSU pitchers have tossed two shutouts in
the past three games, and righthander Mike Wagner
struck out 10 and retired all the batters he faced in
his last outing, an 8-0 win last Thursday.
The Cardinal will then get a chance to even the
series when USC comes to Palo Alto to round out
the teams' season matchups. The second week of
Pac-10 play heats up on Friday, March 31, giving way
to a week packed with games â€” five games Friday
through Wednesday.
Stanford was projected to finish third in presea
son Pac-10 polls while the Trojans were picked to
finish second and the Cougars to finish last.
