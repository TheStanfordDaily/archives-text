# WOMEN'S TENNIS
## Taking it nice and easy 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
After wrapping up its winter quarter
competition this past weekend, the
women's tennis team has just one hope:
that Finals come just as easily as this sea
son's matches have thus far.
After all. the squad currently boasts a
perfect record and a No. 1 national rank
ing. This weekend, they easily dispensed
of their latest victims — No. 20 William
& Mary on Thursday and No. 8 Califor
nia on Saturday.
Under extremely windy conditions
that effected everyone's game, the Car
dinal (15-0, 5-0 Pac-10) trampled the
Tribe (9-4) Thursday afternoon at
home, 6-1. After sweeping doubles,
Stanford went on to win five of its sin
gles matches.
Sophomore Whitney Deason
blanked Lingda Yang at the No. 5 posi
tion, 6-0, 6-0. Senior Alice Barnes and
sophomore Celia Durkin also won in
two games, while juniors Theresa Logar
and Anne Yelsey each took three
games to down their opponents. Senior
Amber Liu. currently ranked 15 in the
ITA rankings, was the sole Card to fall,
losing at No. 1. 7-6. 4-6,0-1 (10-6), to
William & Mary's astoundingly strong
30-ranked Megan Moulton-Levy.
"William & Mary was not an easy

match," Deason said. "Not only was
our competition tough, but the condi
tions were awful. It was freezing and
windy. But everyone did a great job of
dealing with the less-than-perfect con
ditions, and we came out with a deci
sive win."
On Saturday, the team traveled
across the Bay to battle the Bears (10-4,
4-1). and handed its rival both its first
Pac-10 loss and its first home loss of the
season with a 6-1 campaign. Stanford
again swept doubles and won all but one
singles match.
"I think as a team we had a really
dominating performance in the doubles
against Cal," Liu said. "This was crucial
for our confidence going into the second
half of the season. I'm glad we were all
able to keep our focus before rallying
for Theresa's 21 [birthday] Saturday
night."
This time, it was Barnes, currently
ranked fifth and playing at the No. 2 po
sition, who lost in singles. Barnes put up
a good fight against 29-ranked Suzi
Babos but ultimately lost in the
tiebreaker, 7-6 (7-4), 3-6 (9-11).
Liu displayed some impressive ten
nis. upsetting ninth-ranked Suzi Fodor,
6-3, 6-4. Yelsey and Durkin also each
won in two games, on the fourth and
sixth courts respectively.
"We beat a good Cal team," Barnes

said. "Obviously we always love to beat
Cal, and to do it so convincingly made it
even more fun."
The team now takes a two-week
break during before playing three
matches over Spring Break. It hosts Cal
Poly on March 26 at noon, before visit
ing Pepperdine on March 29 and at Pac
-10 foe Oregon on March 31.

"We're all hitting some good form
now and we'll try to keep that up
through spring break and into next
quarter," Barnes said. "It's important at
this midway stage to keep our focus be
cause the NCAAs can seem a long way
off, but we know that each match we
play is getting us better and more pre
pared."
