# MEN'S SWIMMING
## Not chasing history, obliterating it 
### KATHERINE BELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In his 26 seasons as head coach of
the top-ranked men's swimming and
diving team. Skip Kenney has won the
Pac-10 title every year since 1982, the
longest such streak in the history of the
Pac-10 Conference — in any sport.
A three-time Olympic coach. Ken
ney has been named the Pac-10 Coach
of the Year 17 times and the NCAA
Coach of the Year six times.
And after his team won its 15th
straight two weeks ago, Kenney is fo
cusing in on doubling the next-longest
streak in Pac-10 history — the string of
UCLA's 14 straight men's basketball
conference titles. But (no pun intend
ed) that streak is very likely on the
verge of being blown out of the water.

What makes Kenney's streak even
more impressive is the perennial suc
cess of the Pac-10 This year, four Pac
-10 teams are ranked in the nation's top
six, with the Card leading the field.The
men hope to translate that No. 1 rank
ing into Kenney's eighth NCAA title
in Atlanta, Ga. next week.
His seven NCAA titles is the
fourth-most for any coach in history.
I le has coached 98 All-Americans and
65 NCAA champions, while losing just
seven dual meets in the past 14 years.
Assistant coach Ted Knapp, a for
mer Stanford swimmer who is in his
22nd season with the team, believes a
key to the team's success is never tak
ing the conference title for granted.
"It's pretty simple," Knapp said.
"We've never overestimated our own
team or underestimated our oppo

nents. We're never over-confident."
Knapp has seen teams whose sole
goal was to end the Cardinal's reign,
but the Stanford team has always fo
cused on their own swimming first.
"Teams just talk about wanting to
beat us," he said. "We talk about doing
our best, not who we're going to beat."
Kenney identified six factors that
have kept Stanford consistently at the
top in such a tough conference —Stan-
ford admissions, the class of 1982
which started the streak. Knapp's re
cruiting "golden gems." the expecta
tions of the team and alumni, twenty
five years of tradition and the wisdom
passed down to younger teammates.
Ilie seventh factor? Skip Kenney.
Perhaps it's no surprise then that
when Kenney. 15 swimmers and a
diver head to next week's NCAA

Championships, they will not settle for
anything but a winning performance.
And the Cardinal have earned the
right to be optimistic, with several high
rankings heading into the meet.
Ben Wildman-Tobriner is seeded
second in the 50and l(X)yard freestyle,
Hongzhe Sun is second in the 2(H)
backstroke and 2(X) IM while Shaun
Phillips is third in the mile. The 2(X)
freestyle relay of Wildman-Tobriner.
Kyle Ransom, Matt Crowe and Jason
Dunford is the Card's only top seed.
But no matter how many consecu
tive Pac-10 or NCAA titles the team
wins, the best part about coaching for
Kenney isn't the accomplishments,but
the athletes.
"They're highly motivated Stan
ford student-athletes," he said. "It
doesn't get any better than that."
