## Center to look at corporate governance 
### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
With the trial of former Enron executives contin
uing to make headlines, Stanford Law School re
cently received a $10 million donation from Arthur
Rock and his wife,Toni Rembe, for the further study
of corporate governance. The new Arthur and Toni
Rembe Rock Center for Corporate Governance
will be the first of its kind on the west coast.
As a multidisciplinary undertaking, the Rock
Center aims to bring together faculty members from
across the University to research corporate gover
nance and disseminate the findings to business peo
ple and policy makers. The new center will be direct
ed by Law School Profs. Joseph Grundfest, a former
commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Com
mission (SEC), and Robert Daines, a former invest
ment banker at Goldman Sachs.
According to Grundfest, the Rock Center hopes
to launch a series of "novel initiatives," one of which
will be a new publicly-accessible database with in
formation about corporate governance practices at
traded firms. And on April 3 in Washington, D C, the
first of a series of conferences hosted by both the
Rock Center and the SEC titled "Governance and
the Regulators" will discuss proposed executive
compensation disclosure rules.
In addition, new business school and law school
courses will be designed for Stanford students. Un
dergraduate and graduate students will also be able
to participate in research projects funded by the
Rock Center, Daines said.
"The new course materials designed by the Rock
Center will emphasize the need for business stu
dents and executives to pay attention to matters of
legal compliance, separate and apart from the more
traditional focus on notions of business ethics,"
Grundfest said.
Law School Dean Larry Kramer said he believes
the Center will tackle important issues currently
faced by the community, resulting in significant im
plications for future economic growth.
"The Center will provide a locus for joint work
among faculty and students in law, business, eco
nomics and engineering, playing to Stanford's
strength in these areas and its well deserved reputa
tion for working across institutional and disciplinary
boundaries," Kramer said. "As such,
the Rock Center can, and 1 believe
will, have a real impact in the world
of corporate governance."
Daines hopes that the Rock Cen
ter will benefit scholars, regulators
and students by encouraging re
search that leads to the better un
derstanding of corporate gover
nance and improves its teaching and
practice.
"Stanford is uniquely positioned
to make a difference in the area of

corporate governance because the
University houses the country's top
programs in the areas of business,
economics and law" Daines said.
"And I am thrilled that legendary in
vestor Arthur Rock is supporting
Stanford's interdisciplinary work."
All interviewed said they viewed
the donation by Arthur and Toni
Rembe Rock, given March 6, as a
significant vote of confidence in the
University and Stanford Law
School.
"Arthur and Toni saw a problem
that needed more focus and atten
tion in the academy and selected
Stanford as the place most likely to
create something that would make a
positive contribution," Kramer

noted.
Arthur Rock is a legendary ven
ture capitalist whose pioneering ef
forts helped start companies such as
Apple Computer and Intel in Sili
con Valley. Toni Rembe Rock, ac
cording to Grundfest, is a "trailblaz
ing attorney who brilliantly suc
ceeded in the law at a time when
women partners at major firms were
quite rare."
The study of corporate gover
nance gained widespread attention
after recent corporate accounting
scandals such as Enron. World Com
and Tyco.
Corporate governance concerns
the "link between a corporation's
management and the interests of

the corporation's investors â€” pri
marily those of shareholders," said
Law School Prof. Michael Klausner.
Dairies also noted that "scandals
caused by bad governance affect the
legitimacy and public perception of
large business interests."
"The central issue of corporate
governance is the extent to which
managers are constrained from act
ing in their own interests at the ex
pense of investors and the extent to
which they have incentives to pur
sue the interests of their investors,"
Klausner said. "The issue is impor
tant because if the legal and eco
nomic environment in which busi
nesses operate do not respond well
to the potential problem of self-in

terested or unresponsive manage
ment, economic activity suffers."
Grundfest further emphasized
that the vast majority of the United
States' economic output is generat
ed by organizations that have adopt
ed the corporate form.
"'Hie study of corporate gover
nance seeks to advance our under
standing of how corporate entities
operate and hopes to help them
function more productively and ef
ficiently," Grundfest said. "The
study of corporate governance also
concerns itself with a broad range of
ethical and other questions related
to the implications of corporate ac
tivity on a wide range of social and
economic concerns."
