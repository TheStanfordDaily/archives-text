## Women send 10 to Georgia for NCAAs 
### ALEXIS ANN PETERSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ten members of the women's
swimming and diving teams will
represent the Cardinal at the 2006
NCAA Championships March 16-
18 in Athens, Ga.
Junior diver Cassidy Krug offi
cially made the grade Saturday at
the NCAA Zone E Championships
in Oklahoma City. Krug placed
third in the 1-meter event and
fourth in 3-meter, which was
enough to secure her one of the
eleven available qualifying spots for
NCAAs.
Krug will join senior swimmers
Kristen Caverly, Dana Kirk and
Laura Davis, as well as juniors Lau
ren Costella and Desiree Stahley,
sophomores Brooke Bishop and
Elizabeth Durot and freshmen An
drea Axtell and Madeline Rovira in
their quest for NCAA glory.
While this may be a smaller
group of women than the team orig
inally hoped would qualify, expecta
tions remain high.
'i am very hopeful — we may
only be bringing nine girls [from the
swimming team], but they are nine
of the best in the country," Kirk said.
"People should be scared of us."

Kirk has received 14A11-Ameri
can honors during her time at The
Farm. Seeded second in the 1(X)-
meter fly and fourth in the 2(X)-
meter fly. Kirk will seek to complete
her Stanford career with an NCAA
title.
"I'm not putting too much pres
sure on myself," Kirk said.'i want to
make it just like any other meet."
Caverly, who is seeded third in
the 2(X)-meter individual medley
and seventh in the 200-meter
breast, is also in a position to take
home her first-ever NCAA crown.
"My goal is just to get my best
times, whether that means taking
first or taking third," Caverly said.
"Winning a national title has of
course always been one of my goals,
and 1 do want to make this my best
meet and go out with a bang."
Bishop is also expected to finish
within the top 10 nationally having
earned a sixth -place seed in the 200-
meter back.
"Individually, I have never made
the top heat, but this year. 1 should
be able to in all three of my events,"
Bishop said. "Everyone has individ
ual goals, but as a team, this is going
to be about every person contribut-
ing and doing what she can to
score the most points."
In a general sense, it has been
a bit of an adjustment year for
Stanford. The biggest change,
perhaps, was the introduction of
head coach Lea Maurer to the
Cardinal swimming staff this
fall.
"Everything is different this
year Kirk said. "We have a new
coach, a new sponsor, new team
mates, a new training philoso
phy, a new attitude on deck.
Both our approach and our race
strategy are different."
The difference Maurer has
made has helped to produce a
new level of energy on the team.
"This is a different era, and
different is good; change is
good," Kirk said. "Last season
was one of the most disappoint

ing seasons I've had. And so
right now, my biggest motiva
tion is that people think we are
going to lay down and die, and
we're not."
Although Stanford may not
be expected to make waves at
NCAAs, the athletes remain
confident in their abilities.
"We are definitely the under
dogs," Caverly said. "We are
seeded eighth,just by our roster,
but we have great potential. We
just need to tap into that and
swim our best races."
Ultimately, the Cardinal be
lieve the element of surprise will
work in their favor during com
petition.
"Other teams just aren't ex
pecting us," Bishop said. "And
we are definitely going to sur
prise people."
