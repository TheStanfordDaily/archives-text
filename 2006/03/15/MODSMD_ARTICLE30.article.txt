### ALEXIS ANN PETERSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ten members of the women's
swimming and diving teams will
represent the Cardinal at the 2006
NCAA Championships March 16-
18 in Athens, Ga.
Junior diver Cassidy Krug offi
cially made the grade Saturday at
the NCAA Zone E Championships
in Oklahoma City. Krug placed
third in the 1-meter event and
fourth in 3-meter, which was
enough to secure her one of the
eleven available qualifying spots for
NCAAs.
Krug will join senior swimmers
Kristen Caverly, Dana Kirk and
Laura Davis, as well as juniors Lau
ren Costella and Desiree Stahley,
sophomores Brooke Bishop and
Elizabeth Durot and freshmen An
drea Axtell and Madeline Rovira in
their quest for NCAA glory.
While this may be a smaller
group of women than the team orig

Caverly, who is seeded third in

home her first-ever NCAA crown.
"My goal is just to get my best
times, whether that means taking

"Winning a national title has of

meet and go out with a bang."
Bishop is also expected to finish
within the top 10 nationally having

"Individually, I have never made
the top heat, but this year. 1 should
