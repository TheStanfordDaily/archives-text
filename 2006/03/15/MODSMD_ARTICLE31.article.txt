## Struggling spikers swept 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
In desperate need of time to regroup and refo
cus before the end of the conference season, Stan
ford men's volleyball is ready for a break.
In the team's last action of winter quarter, the
Cardinal stretched their losing streak to nine this
weekend, getting swept by No. 7 UC-Santa Bar
bara (12-10,8-8 MPSF) and No.sCal State-North
ridge (12-8,7-7).
In both matches, the Cardinal (4-18,2-14) put
together runs and individuals had good perform
ances, but ultimately the team could not keep up
down the stretch. The Gauchos and Matadors
both hit .432, while Stanford's hitters managed
only .227 and .089 in the two matches.
Senior middle blocker Chris Ahlfeldt led
Stanford with a .MX) hitting percentage Friday,
while senior opposite Ben Reddy had a team
high 18 kills on .235 hitting. Reddy notched three
of Stanford's seven service aces, sophomore mid
dle blocker Matt Ceran scored assists on all three
of Stanford's blocks and junior libero Brian I .ind
berg had a team-high five digs.
Ahlfeldt hit .8(X) in the first game,but the Gau
chos edged out the Cardinal for the 30-25 win.
Santa Barbara's offense picked up in the second
and hit .607 as a team. Reddy had eight kills, but
the rest of the team struggled and fell 30-21. The
third game was the closest of the match, with
Reddy's serve keeping the Cardinal in it to the
end, but the Gauchos finished with a 30-26 win.
The Cardinal started strong Saturday but
could not stay with the Matadors. After being tied
at 11, Northridge pulled away and won 30-21.
The Matadors carried that momentum into the
second game, going up 7-2 after consecutive Stan
ford errors.The Cardinal closed to within two on a
Reddy service ace, but CSU-Northridge distanced
itself once again.The game ended on three straight
service errors for the 30-22 Northridge win.
In crunch time, Stanford started game three
hot.going up 4-1. But, as was the case far too often
this past weekend, the success was short-lived.
Three errors tied the game, and then the Mata
dors edged out in front. The Cardinal trailed by
two at 19-17 but scored only one more point in the
match — a kill by Reddy — and lost 30-18.
Stanford hit .089 for the match, including .000
in the second game. Reddy led the way with two
aces and 11 kills but hit at a negative percentage.
Ahlfeldt hit a team-high .300 and tallied three
blocks, including one solo, while Lindberg had a
match-high eight digs.
After breaking for Dead Week and finals,
Stanford returns to the court March 29 and 30,
hosting No. 4 Hawaii each day. The Card then
head south to visit No. 9 UCLA and No. 2 UC-
Irvine.
Stanford will close out the MPS!' season at
home against UC-San Diego, still winless in con
ference. and No. 6 Long Beach State.
