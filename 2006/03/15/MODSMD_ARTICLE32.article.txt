# WATER POLO
## Post-USC, polo seeks its Marco 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
No. 2 women's water polo can't quite
get over the hump against top-ranked
Southern California.
In all three of their showdowns with
the undefeated Women of Troy (16-0,5-0
MPSF) this season, the Cardinal (12-3,5-
1) have fallen just short. The third of
these showdowns came this past Thurs
day in Malibu, Calif., where a late USC
offensive surge proved the difference in
the Women of Troy's 7-6 victory.
After falling behind early, the Stanford
women responded with three straight to
take a 3-1 lead and a 4-3 halftime edge.
Stanford was unable to make the lead
stand up. however, as the Women of Troy
converted a six-on-five advantage to tie
the game and took the lead back for good
on a skip-shot from junior Erica Figge.
Down 6-4, senior defender Laurel
Champion found the back of the cage
midway through the fourth period to put
Stanford back in position to tie.
But USC junior Brittany Hayes put
the game away on her team's next posses
sion, burying a backhand from the two
meter mark for her third goal of the
game. Freshman driver Lolo Silver
scored with five seconds remaining to
provide the 7-6 final.
Though the result was disappointing,
the play at set of Champion and junior
two-meter Christina Hewko stood out.
Junior Meridith McColl, who anchored

the Stanford defense with 14 saves, noted
Champion's success against USC two
meter Moriah Van Norman, one of the
nation's toughest assignments.
"Laurel totally shut [her] down, and
USC had no natural goals out of two me
ters," McColl said. "Every time we play
USC, they get frustrated because Laurel
has so much experience shutting their
hole set down."
"Christina is always giving 110 percent,"
McColl continued. "Playing two-meter of
fense is extremely exhausting. While others
get a chance to rest, she is battling all out in
the hole. Her effort isn't always rewarded,
but she is always going for it."
McColl emphasized that, while regu
lar season meetings are critical to a
team's progress, it is performance in the
postseason that really counts — and in
that regard, the Cardinal are confident
that they are right on track.
"It is hard to come so close in a game
like USC because we outplayed them on
so many fronts," McColl said. "We still
have things to work on, and that is very ex
citing because with a little fine-tuning we
know that the difference can be dramatic."
The Cardinal bounced back from the
loss Saturday with a 9-3 victory over No.
14 UC Davis (9-8, 5-2 WWPA). Seniors
Scotti Shafer and Katie I lansen notched
three goals apiece and McColl tallied five
saves. Freshman Lauren Silver scored two
to bring her season total to a team-high 28.
After breaking for Finals, the team
will host No. 16 Princeton on March 24.
