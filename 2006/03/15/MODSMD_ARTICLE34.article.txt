# TRACK & FIELD
## Women shine at Indoors 
### ISRAEL ROJAS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This weekend, the Cardinal returned to
Fayetteville, Ark., to compete in the 2006
NCAA Division I Indoor Track & Field
Championships. Stanford's previous visit
to the University of Arkansas' lyson In
door Track Complex resulted in several
new school records — and it was no differ
ent the second time around.
The women's team finished second
overall as projected, scoring 36 points and
trailing only the favorite Texas, who fin
ished with an overwhelming 51-point total.
Not since 1992 — when the Stanford squad
also finished second — have the Card per
formed so well. Additionally, they extend
ed their streak of top 10-finishes at the
meet to five years straight.
Junior Arianna Lambie. who earned
three All-American honors, paced the
team with half of Stanford's total points.
She finished third in the 3000 meters and
fourth in the mile.
She also anchored the team's distance
medley relay, which placed second overall.
In two-plus year on the the Farm, she has
earned nine All-American honors in cross
country and indoor and outdoor track.
In her last visit to Arkansas' track,
Chauntae Bavne set a school record of

23.41 seconds in the 2(M) meters.This time,
Bayne one-upped herself.
The sophomore sprinter left Arkansas
with two new school records: a 7.21 in the
60, and a 22.77 in the 2(H). For her two
records. Bayne received All-American
honors.
Sophomores Erica McLain, Teresa
McWalters and Keisha Gaines, and juniors
Amanda Trotter and Ashley Freeman were
also honored as Ail-Americans. McLain
earned the distinction for her performance
in the triple jump, McWalters for the 3000
meters, and the others for their accom
plishments in the distance medley relay.
The men's indoor meet did not go as
well, with the team scoring just two points
to place 52nd. Sophomore Russell Brown
took eighth in the mile, earning him All-
American status and keeping the men
from returning home scoreless.
While the team's finish was dishearten
ing, coach Edrick Floreal emphasized that
the team is rebuilding and that he is more
concerned with the outdoor season.
Both the men and women now shift
their focus outdoors. While the women are
in good shape — they are looking to place
in the top four at NCAAs — the men have
plenty of room for improvement.
"We have to get hack to the top," Flore
al said.
