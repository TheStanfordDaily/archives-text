# WRESTLING
## Duo headed to NCAAs 
### DENIS GRIFFIN STAFF WRITER 
For the majority of Stanford's
wrestlers, the season is over. But two
members of the Cardinal squad will con
tinue on to represent Stanford at the
NCAATournament.beginning March 16
in Oklahoma City. Okla.
Sophomore captain Tanner Gardner,
at 125 pounds, and senior captain Ray
Blake, at 165 pounds, both placed highly
in the Pac-10 Tournament to get their
tickets punched to Oklahoma this com
ing weekend. Head coach Kerry McCoy
praised the work ethic of the Cardinal
duo.
"The biggest thing is that they know
what they've put into it," McCoy said.
"They know that they've done everything
above and beyond what they've been ex
pected to do, and that's why they're in this
situation now to become National
Champs. I think that's a true credit to
them."
Gardner will make his second trip to
the NCAA Tournament, having qualified
two years ago as a true freshman. He

takes his second-place Pac-10 finish and a
33-10 overall record with him to Okla
homa City. McCoy emphasized that
Gardner's greatest challenge would be
tempering his aggressive style with pa
tience.
"[Tanner's] biggest asset is his condi
tioning and being able to control the pace
of the match," McCoy said. "He has to
force that on his opponent, but at the
same time, he has to be patient and not be
worried if it's a one- or two-point match.
He knows that he's going to own that
third period, so he has to pace himself and
really go out there with that mindset."
McCoy stressed that the key for Blake
— who takes a 41-11 record and third
place finish in the Pac-10 to Nationals —
will be staying calm under championship
level pressure.
"When he starts to get tense, that's
when he starts to freeze up and starts
making mistakes," McCoy said. "So he
just needs to relax and have his legs under
him and feel good. And as long as he feels
good, no one's going to be able to stay
with him."
Despite similarities in their respective

records and aggressive styles, the differ
ence between the two wrestlers' situa
tions also stands out. As a sophomore,
Gardner can hope for more opportuni
ties at national success after this season.
Blake, on the other hand, faces his first,
last and only chance at NCAA success as
a fifth-vear senior.

"Tanner's going to be the corner
stone of our program for the next few
years," McCoy said. "But for Ray, this is
his last shot. Every day that's gone by,
he's cemented his place in the history of
Stanford wrestling. Now he has the
chance to cement himself in the history
of wrestling overall."
