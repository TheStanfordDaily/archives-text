# STANFORD 65, UVA 49
## SENIOR SEND-OFF Stanford wins what is likely its last home game of season 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
It may not have been the NCAA Tourna
ment, but against the University of Virginia in
the first round of the NIT last night, the Car
dinal played like they were competing for a
national championship.
In what will likely be the final home game
for Stanford's four seniors, the No. 8 seeded
Cardinal (16-13) cruised past the No. 9 seed
ed Cavaliers and into the second round with a
65-49 win.
The game may have been Stanford's best
defensive effort of the season, as the Cardinal
held the Cavs (15-14) to a season-low point
total on just 36 percent shooting from the
field and 10 percent from the three-point line.
Virginia also turned the ball over 15 times.
"The last time we played at home we got
beat by a really good team," Stanford head
coach Trent Johnson said. "I thought tonight
our guys were really looking forward to the
challenge and knew we had an opportunity to
be successful."
The game was a bit of redemption for
Stanford and its seniors, who got crushed in
what figured to be their last home game, 75-
54, by conference-champs UCLA. While last
night's contest lacked the pregame fanfare as
sociated with senior day, this will be the game
that many of the seniors remember.
"It felt a lot better walking off today then
it did against UCLA," said senior forward
Matt Haryasz, who scored 10 points in the
win. "This is a good way for us to go out. We
came together as a team and played really
well tonight...This is the way we're going to
remember going out at Maples."
Haryasz was one of three seniors finishing
in double-digits in scoring. Guard Chris Her
nandez led the team with 14 points and Dan
Grunfeld, also a guard, ended with 12.
"It is a really good feeling to know that we
won the last game here at Maples and repre
sented Stanford and the people who cheered
for us," Grunfeld said. "It feels good. This is
postseason play — what it is all about."

Senior center Matt Haryasz scored 10 points against the University of Virginia last
night in Maples Pavilion. The win sends Stanford into the second round of the NIT.
round of their conference tournament
and did not get an NCAA Tournament
berth. The conference received four invi
tations to the Big Dance and Missouri
State, who finished with an RPI of 21, is
likely feeling like they were unfairly left
out.
"They're a good basketball team,"
Johnson said. "They have a very hostile
home environment. They are very bal
anced.They have seven or eight guys who
can score for them. They are probably a
little bitter since they didn't get an at large

Even though the game was the last
for four Stanford players at Maples
Pavilion there was little audible excite
ment from the crowd until the seniors
came off the court for the last time. The
contest was played in front of a paltry
crowd of 2,519 fans and was the Cardi
nal's most decisive blowout win since a
58-34 win over Princeton on Dec. 21.
The Cavs opened the game on a 6-0
run as the Cardinal turned the ball over,
missed three shots and committed two
fouls before they even got on the score
board. But the tide turned quickly as the
Cardinal stepped up their defense and
started scoring at ease. Stanford went on
a 32-11 run and led from the 14:52 mark
in the first half all the way to the final
horn.
Virginia guards Sean Singletary and
J.R. Reynolds, who both averaged over 17
points per game coming into last night's
contest, were limited to 13 and 12 points
respectively, and shot just a combined 11-
of-32 from the field.
"We had great team defense," Her
nandez said. "If the guards would get
beat, the big men were there to help. I
think we did a good job of helping each
other and making them take tough shots
and not get any easy looks."
The Cavaliers became visibly fatigued
as the game wore on — likely from play
ing on short rest and being forced to trav
el on little notice.The Cavs were eliminat
ed from the ACCTournament last Friday
with a 79-67 loss to No. 10 North Caroli
na.The NIT bracket came out on Sunday
night and the team flew to the Bay Area
on Monday.
"For Virginia, finding out that they
had to travel clear across the country on
Sunday — they definitely fatigued a little
late in the first half and at the end of the
game," Johnson said.
The Cardinal, who missed the NCAA
Tournament for the first time since the
1993-94 season, advance to play No. 2
seeded Missouri State in Springfield. Mo.
on Friday.
The Bears (20-8) finished the regular
season third in the Missouri Valley Con

bid to the Tournament."
If the Cardinal can advance past Mis
souri State, they would play the winner of
Brigham Young and Houston on the
road. The only way that the Cardinal
would return to play at Maples is if the
Cardinal win their next two games and if
Delaware State beats No. 1 seeded
Louisville and then the winner of the
game between Clemson and Louisiana
Tech. Stanford would then play the 1 lor
nets at Maples on March 22 in the quar
terfinals.

JOEL LEWENSTEIN/The Stanford
senior guard Chris Hernandez and his three fellow seniors have one more chance to play at home
his season. Nevertheless, last night's game was a solid send-off for the Class of 2006.
