# STANFORD 65, UVA 49
## SENIOR SEND-OFF Stanford wins what is likely its last home game of season 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
It may not have been the NCAA Tourna
ment, but against the University of Virginia in
the first round of the NIT last night, the Car
dinal played like they were competing for a
national championship.
In what will likely be the final home game
for Stanford's four seniors, the No. 8 seeded
Cardinal (16-13) cruised past the No. 9 seed
ed Cavaliers and into the second round with a
65-49 win.
The game may have been Stanford's best
defensive effort of the season, as the Cardinal
held the Cavs (15-14) to a season-low point
total on just 36 percent shooting from the
field and 10 percent from the three-point line.
Virginia also turned the ball over 15 times.
"The last time we played at home we got
beat by a really good team," Stanford head
coach Trent Johnson said. "I thought tonight
our guys were really looking forward to the
challenge and knew we had an opportunity to
be successful."
The game was a bit of redemption for
Stanford and its seniors, who got crushed in
what figured to be their last home game, 75-
54, by conference-champs UCLA. While last
night's contest lacked the pregame fanfare as
sociated with senior day, this will be the game
that many of the seniors remember.
"It felt a lot better walking off today then
it did against UCLA," said senior forward
Matt Haryasz, who scored 10 points in the
win. "This is a good way for us to go out. We
came together as a team and played really
well tonight...This is the way we're going to
remember going out at Maples."
Haryasz was one of three seniors finishing
in double-digits in scoring. Guard Chris Her
nandez led the team with 14 points and Dan
Grunfeld, also a guard, ended with 12.
"It is a really good feeling to know that we
won the last game here at Maples and repre
sented Stanford and the people who cheered
for us," Grunfeld said. "It feels good. This is
postseason play â€” what it is all about."
