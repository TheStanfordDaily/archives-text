### JOHN CHOCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The best collegiate crews in the nation
will launch their boats at the Cardinal's
home course of Redwood Shores for the
fourth-annual Windermere Real Estate
Rowing Classic, March 25-26.
The Cardinal are preparing to host an
elite field of 20 teams that includes Yale,
California and Princeton in the premiere
early-season regatta.
Head-to-head competition is the signa
ture feature of a duel racing format that pits
one boat against another in a two-team heat.
"It suits our style of racing very well,"
senior Jake Cornelius, the men's team
captain, said.
All three Stanford crew teams — the
men's heavyweight, women's open
weight and women's lightweight — will
field teams for the Classic.

For the men. the Windermere will kick
off a highly-anticipated spring season
that comes on the heels of last year's his
toric campaign in which the Cardinal fin
ished seventh in the nation and knocked
off California for the first time in 18 years.
The women's open-weight team en
ters the Windermere with the momentum
of a season-opening four-event sweep
March 11 against British Columbia,
Simon Frasier and UC-Santa Barbara.
"The first race of the season is always
nerve-racking, because nobody knows
how we're going to compare to other
teams," senior open-weight co-captain
Susan Beville said.
The wins included one by a 50-second
margin over UCSB in the novice division.
"It is always great to see the freshmen
and novices take their first racing strokes
for Stanford," women's open coach
Aimee Baker said..
