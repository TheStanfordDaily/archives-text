## Cardinal wins two 
### ROHAN PURANIK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With hat tricks from both senior attack Megan Burker and soph
omore attack Daphne Patterson, the women's lacrosse team took
charge in the second half of its game against the Columbia Lions this
past Saturday, notching a 13-4 victory.
The squad also defeated the Saint Mary's Gaels 18-7 on Sunday
and boosted its overall season record to 5-2, and its conference record
to 2-1. Patterson led the Cardinal with four goals, as 10 members of
the Stanford team scored in the game.
The match on Saturday started with the Lions netting the first
goal. But the Cardinal responded with five consecutive goals in a 15-
minute stretch to pull ahead by four. Columbia attempted to come
back from the 5-1 deficit, but the Lions only managed to score two
goals before Stanford junior midfield Liz Piselli scored the final goal
of the half.
Stanford outshot the Lions 18-13 while sophomore goalkeeper
Laura Shane made six saves.
Stanford began the second half by demolishing the Lion defense
with three goals scored barely five minutes into the half. Burker
scored the first two, while sophomore midfield/attack Megan Mc-
Clain scored the third.
The Cardinal offense continued its onslaught and went on to score
four more goals before the end of the game. Columbia captain Car
rie Anderer scored the only Columbia goal of the second half as the
Stanford women rolled to the 13-4 win.
An even more dominant first-half offensive showing aided the
Cardinal in Sunday's game against St. Mary's. Stanford netted 12 of
23 shots while the Gaels only managed to make four of their nine.
Senior attack Sarah Bach was the first scorer of the game, finding
the back of the net four minutes into the game. McClain netted the
Cardinal's second goal, but the Gaels responded with one of their
own. Bach scored again at 19:11 to set off a four-goal streak for the
Cardinal.
The Cardinal's fiery scoring touch returned in the last seven min
utes of the first half, with Piselli and Patterson producing two goals
apiece, and junior midfield Jessica Verrilli scoring one.
Stanford's showed a weaker performance in the second half, only
scoring half of the first-half total. Saint Mary's maintained its offen
sive pace by tallying three goals in the second half, but still came up
short.
The Card now face a tough match against Northwestern on Satur
day. The Wildcats ousted Stanford 16-3 last season, with only Mc-
Clain, Bach and alumna midfield Kelsey Twist scoring. The game will
be held at home on Maloney Field at 1 p.m.
