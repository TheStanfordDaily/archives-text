# MEN'S GOLF
## Golf starts spring hot 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES STAFF WRITER 
Gaining not only victories, but also confidence with every pass
ing event, the men's golf team is looking to keep its strong start
going when it heads to Santa Cruz for the Western Intercollegiate
on March 27 and 28.
"We all feel really good about our showing at [the Ashworth
Invitational], and we're just looking to play in a similar fashion
down at the Western," coach Conrad Ray said.
The Cardinal finished in third at Ashworth, following their fifth
place finish at the Hilo Intercollegiate. Sophomore Rob Grube (sixth
at Ashworth) and juniors Zack Miller (second at Ashworth) and
Matt Savage (17th at Hilo) have helped the Card to their solid spring
start.
The squad will have its chance at the Western, although the dif
ficult Pasatiempo Golf Course could prove a challenge.
"It's definitely a course where putting is at a premium," Ray
said. "There's a lot of slope on the greens and it can get pretty
fast."
Putting is especially a focus for Grube, who was disappointed
with his poor putting at Ashworth. Grube said he's improved his
short game in the team's qualifiers, but added that Pasatiempo is
just as much about ball striking.
"The course forces a player to be in particular spots on the
green if they're going to have any legitimate shot at making
birdie," Grube said. "It's a putting contest among those players
who can control their ball well enough to have legitimate birdie
putts."
And if the course isn't challenging enough, the Cardinal could
once again face poor weather in the mountains of Santa Cruz.
Last year's third round was canceled because of the downpour,
and Ray said rain is frequent in the mountains this time of year.
Other than No. 10 Duke, Stanford isn't expecting as challenging a
field as at recent invites. Facing mostly regional teams such as San
Jose State, Santa Clara and California, Stanford's outlook should be
good.
