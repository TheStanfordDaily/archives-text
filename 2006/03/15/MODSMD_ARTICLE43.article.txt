# WOMEN'S GOLF
## Tough field awaits Card 
### BY CARSON COOPER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a disappointing trip to Mexico that resulted in a next-to
last-place finish, the Stanford women's golf team is desperately
searching for answers as the Pac-10 Tournament nears. The team
will continue that search over spring break, traveling to Arizona
State for the ASU/PING Invitational beginning March 31.
InTempe, the No. 15 Cardinal will face a strong field that will in
clude the No. 2 Sun Devils. Also participating will be No. 3 UCLA,
who will be looking to continue its winning streak after taking the
Cal/Guadalajara Invitational.
The tournament will be a homecoming for Stanford junior Lauren
Todd. She expects a large group of friends and family to be in atten
dance at the three-day tournament, just minutes from her hometown.
"I grew up playing on the ASU course, so it will definitely feel
familiar," Todd said.
The Arizona State lineup features Alissa Kuczka and Brooke
Todare, two former teammates of Todd's at Xavier College Prep.
Todd expects that their presence will bolster the quality of her play.
"I was recruited by ASU, and I have a couple of friends who
play there, so there will be some playful banter during the tourna
ment," the junior said. "It's always a motivating factor for me play
ing against ASU."
The Cardinal will be looking to bounce back from their difficult
trip to Guadalajara, in which they placed 10th in the 11 -team field.
"This was a wakeup call for the team," head coach Caroline
O'Connor said of the team's performance south of the border.
"We need to work harder on every component of the game. Partic
ularly, we need to be more disciplined on the golf course."
To rebound, the Card will look first and foremost to senior Kelly
Husted. The Florida native leads the nation in total short game, a
measure of chipping and putting ability. Freshman Mari Chun will
also be expected to contribute. Earlier in the year, Chun shot a single
round 68 that has been the top round on the year to date for the Card.
