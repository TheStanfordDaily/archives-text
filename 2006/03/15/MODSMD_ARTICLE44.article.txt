## Small dishes removed this week University deemed renovation of Bracewell Observatory impractical 
### ADAM WIDMAN STAFF WRITER 
Last Friday, Stanford began removing five radio an
tennas at Site 515 in the foothills. The antennas, smaller
cousins of Stanford's well-known landmark the Dish,
each had radio dish components measuring 60 feet.
According to the Stanford News Service, the concrete
mounting piers used to support the five antennas will not
be destroyed. The piers, which don carved signatures of
visiting professors from the 19705, will be moved to an
other location on campus.
The University announced plans to raze the antennas
about two years ago — claiming that they were a fire haz
ard — but ran into a number of obstacles before Santa
Clara County issued clearance for demolition.
A number of organizations and individuals sought to

spare the antennas for academic purposes and other ini
tiatives. However, the University did not find any of these
initiatives to be worthy enough to justify the costs of re
pairing and then maintaining the antennas.
"[Since the 19705] research and teaching have pro
gressed in a way that makes the academic use of these an
tennas impractical and inefficientthe University stated
in a press release. "No compelling academic mission was
identified that would justify the substantial resources
necessary to restore and operate the dishes."
Bob Lash, President of the Friends of the Bracewell
Observatory, an organization created to prevent Stan
ford from razing the dishes, said his group will still advo
cate the historical significance of these antennas and
their role in the research of former Stanford Prof. Ron
Bracewell.
"We will continue our effort to preserve and present
the history and scientific contributions made by
Bracewell and his colleagues at the Bracewell Observa
tory" he said.
According to the Stanford News Service, removal of
the antennas is expected to be completed by Friday.
