## Dems host House challengers 
### BEN EPPLER STAFF WRITER 
Getting a head start on the upcoming November con
gressional elections, the Stanford Democrats recently host
ed two party hopefuls for California's 11 th district,current
ly held by Republican Richard Pombo.
AJ Carrillo, campaign manager for Jerry McNerney.
addressed 17 members of the student group Monday
evening at the History Corner. McNerney himself was
scheduled to speak at the event, but cancelled his appear
ance earlier in the day because his mother-in-law had a
stroke, Carrillo said.
McNerney is running in the 11th district Democratic
primary this June against Steve Filson.who addressed the
Dems last Monday.'The winner of the primary will take on
Pombo, who seems assured of the Republican nomina
tion despite a challenge from former congressman Pete
McClosky.
Explaining why the Stanford Democrats chose to host
primary hopefuls for the 11 th district. Special Events Coor
dinator Debashish Bakshi, a sophomore, noted that Stan
ford is located in the strongly Democratic 14th district rep
resented by Ana Eshoo.
"That's great," said Bakshi, "but she doesn't have to
make much of an effort."
ITius, the group chose to highlight a competitive race
that is garnering national attention in the Democratic
party.
"This is the most intense race in the area," he said. "It's
one of the two [congressional] races west of the Rockies
that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee
is targeting this year."
Carrillo agreed that a victory against the seven-term in
cumbent is imperative.
"His revision of the Endangered Species Act essential
ly guts the whole law," he said.
At the beginning of his presentation, Carrillo gave back
ground on McNerney's unsuccessful 2(XW race against
Pombo, in which he lost 60 percent to 40 percent after get
ting a late start—joining the race two weeks before the
primary at the insistence of his son, a member of the Air
Force. "His son challenged him. 1 le said,' Dad. 1 did my
duty: it's time for you to do yours," said Carrillo, pointing
out that McNerney had posted the best showing ever for a
challenger to Pombo despite his late entry, which ham
strung his funding and his ability to reach voters.
Carrillo continued with a summary of the candidate's
three major priorities: renewable energy, universal health
care and a phased withdrawal from Iraq.
"Jerry is a nationally recognized expert in renewable
energy," he said, citing McNerney's current position as the
head of a small renewable energy start-up as evidence of
his commitment to ending what President George W. Bush
called the nation's "addiction to oil."
"We can be brought to our knees with the flick of a pen,"
Carrillo said, referring to American reliance on Middle
East petroleum.
Carrillo also highlighted McNerney's stance in favor of
universal healthcare, arguing that automaker Toyota chose

to locate its North American factory in Canada partly due
to the country's single-payer plan, which eliminates the fi
nancial burden on businesses to provide healthcare.
Addressing the war in Iraq, Carrillo said his boss stands
for a withdrawal on an eight-to-twelve-month timetable.
"I lis philosophy is that this war is a war of choice," said
Carrillo, making reference to the overextension of the
American military. "A two front war, we cannot fight, and
China knows this. Iran knows this," he explained.claiming
that foreign countries can currently go ahead with their nu
clear programs without fear of repercussion from Ameri
can forces bound up in Iraq.
Carrillo expressed confidence in McNemey's chances
against Filson.a former tighter pilot. He pointed to a recent
endorsement from the statewide AFL-CIO, an organiza
tion with more than two million members.
"All the ground troops and money that come from that
endorsement are on our side," Carrillo said.
Audience members pointed out that the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee has implicitly en
dorsed Filson. helping him raise $3(),(KX) more than McNer
ney last year.
"The DCCC has backed our opponent implicitly, but as
far as endorsements that matter in a Democratic primary,
we're racking those up," Carrillo responded.
The Stanford Democrats remain uncommitted on
which member of their party to back in the race.
"We're holding off on endorsements." Bakshi said."But
we will be involved in the race itself,especially after the pri
mary."
