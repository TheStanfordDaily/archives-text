# SPECIAL FEES
## Most groups bag enough signatures Daily, MEChA among those that need more names 
### ANDREA FULLER STAFF WRITER 
As Friday's deadline for ASSU Spe
cial Fees petitioning approaches, student
groups working to obtain the required
number of signatures have been largely
successful. Many have already met their
goal, while others said that they were on
their way.
Senior Allison Dencker, financial of
ficer for Alternative Spring Break, said
she found it easy to get 10 percent of the
student body to sign her group's peti
tion.
"We've had enough signatures for a
while now," she said. "I contacted all of
the trip leaders and they were all respon
sible for contacting their friends and all
of their participants. And I also emailed
the participants and asked them to en
courage others to sign the petition. It
was pretty easy. 1 think Alternative
Spring Break serves a lot of students, so
it wasn't too challenging to get the need
ed signatures. I sent out one email."
Sophomore Melissa Smit, financial
officer for Club Sports, said that her
group also easily met its goal because of
its size.
"Our group size is about 1,0t)0 partic
ipants, just within our club," she said.
"We did have a certain percentage who
were grad students who couldn't peti
tion, but it wasn't a problem because we
just had to get everybody in our group to
sign."
Like several other financial officers,
Smit found email the most effective way
to gather signatures.
"I'm sending out emails to all of our
clubs and having them send out emails
to the houses," she said. "We didn't have
too hard of a time for getting the numbers.
We've had them for a while. We got all of ours
pretty quickly."
Other groups have yet to meet their quo
tas. though financial officers expected to ob
tain the needed number of signatures.
"[Jewish Student Association]'s strategy
has mainly included emailing lists of individ
uals who might be interested in supporting
our cause and spreading the word about peti
tioning at JSA events, in our dorms and to
other student groups." said sophomore
Shaina Katz, JSA's financial officer. "We are
pleased with the results so far and feel confi
dent that we will have the required number of
signatures."
Sophomore Bernard Fraga. financial offi
cer for Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de
Azltan (MEChA), expressed hope for suc
cess, even though his group experienced a cri
sis involving a miscalculation.
" Illere was a mistake made regarding

how many signatures were required." he said.
"But we're still attempting to get the required
number of signatures."
The Stanford Daily still has a way to go in
terms of gathering signatures. As a joint un
dergraduate and graduate group. The Daily
must collect support from 15 percent of the
entire campus student population to appear
on the special fees ballot.
"We've got 600 signatures to go, but we
have staffers who still need to turn in their sig
nature packets." said Daily Chief Operating
Officer Brendan Marten. "So that, with a lit
tle extra effort on our part, should put us
over."
The Daily was one of a handful of groups
who used paper packets for petitioning to
supplement the online process.
"Without the ability to use paper packets
for petitioning this year, we never would have
been able to hit the approximately 2,200 that
we need," Marten said. "Online just isn't

enough on its own — two-thirds of our signa
tures came from paper packets."
Groups requesting special fees for the first
time, requesting more than a 10 percent in
crease in fees over last year or asking for
more than was approved by the Undergradu
ate Senate and Graduate Student Council
had to petition to appear on the special fees
ballot. Groups enter their budget informa
tion in an online form to be evaluated by the
ASSU, which then decides what aspects of the
budget it will fund.
Despite the complications faced by some
groups. Dencker said she found the petition
ing process fair and easy
"It was much easier for me because I did
n't have to follow around 7(X) people with a
petition," she said. "1 think that it is fair be
cause it allows each person in the student
group to independently solicit signatures,
therefore giving an advantage to student
groups that [directly] impact many students."
