## ASSU discusses possible revisions to Constitution Senate also looks at door-to-door distribution polity 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate
convened last night, focusing its discus
sion on proposed changes to the ASSU
Constitution. The Senate will vote on the
revised Constitution at its next meeting
on April 4.
"It's mostly shrinking the constitution
down," said Senate Chair Chris Nguyen, a
junior, describing the changes. "We're just
trying to cut it down to the normal length
of a constitution."
The current Constitution, which has re
mained unchanged since 1999, is 90 pages

in length, including an appendix.
The Senate meeting began with re
ports. including one from Publications
Director Brendan Marten on his com
mittee's meeting with Jane Camarillo of
Residential Education regarding the cur
rent door-to-door publication distribu
tion policy.
Marten called the meeting "produc
tive" and reported a planned follow-up
meeting to explore different options.
"I'm glad to hear that progress is being
made on the door-to-door distribution
policy and that Residential Education is
showing a new willingness to compromise
with student publications in order to bal
ance their goals with those of the publica
tions," Nguyen said.
Elections Commissioner Tim Sanders
reported that the petition period for Un
dergraduate Senate candidates ended. Sev
eral Senate candidates attended last night's
meeting.
The Senate then turned its attention to
funding bills, budget modification bills
and reserve transfer bills for various stu
dent groups and club sports. Each was
passed.
Nguyen then opened the Senate floor
for questions, clarification and general dis
cussion of the Constitutions revisions.
These changes were put together in a
joint committee that included Nguyen;
Deputy Senate Chair Danny Arbiter, a
sophomore; Funding Committee Chair of
the Graduate Student Council Adam Be
berg, a graduate student in computer sci
ence and GSC co-ChairTom Lee, a fourth
year electrical engineering doctoral stu
dent.
Nguyen explained the goals of the com
mittee's changes.
"We're just trying to make it more flexi
ble, because the constitution has incredibly
minute details that belong in bylaws rather
than in the constitution." he said.
"I really don't think anyone believes
that the size of an Undergraduate Senate
committee belongs in a constitution, for ex
ample. No one believes the size of a U.S.
senate committee belongs in the federal
Constitution," Nguyen continued.
Senator Macarrin Morton, a junior ex
pressed concerns that compressing the
constitution "leaves interpretation open
and makes [the constitution] a little more
ambiguous."

Nguyen asserted, however, that "any
large sections cut out are not being re
moved; they're being moved to the bylaws
to give [the Senate] more flexibility" to
make changes it sees fit without having to
call for a vote from the student body.
"1 think it will be just as effective in by
laws," said sophomore Kat Kershner, who
stated that the revisions "make the consti
tution clear and specify bylaws."
However, senior Andrew Hendel ques
tioned the revisions.
"Are we just making change for the sake
of making change?" he asked.
Before adjourning, the Senate agreed to
hold another meeting to discuss the consti
tutional amendments before they are
called to a vote next month.
The GSC, which meets tonight, will also
include discussion of the Constitutional re
visions in its agenda.
Hannah Scherer, chair of the Parking
and Transportation Advocacy Committee,
will present a bill creating the Graduate
Student Transportation Board/Hie Gradu
ate Student Transportation Fee will also be
discussed at the meeting. This fee will fund
Caltrain passes for students who live off
campus as well as transportation options to
help students living on-campus gain access
to off-campus opportunities.
The GSC will also discuss increasing the
Graduate Student General Fee. which
funds graduate student groups and GSC
programming.
Other items on the GSC agenda include
funding proposals and an update from the
Diversity Committee.
