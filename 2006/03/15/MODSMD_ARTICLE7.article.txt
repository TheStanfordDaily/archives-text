### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate
convened last night, focusing its discus
sion on proposed changes to the ASSU
Constitution. The Senate will vote on the
revised Constitution at its next meeting
on April 4.
"It's mostly shrinking the constitution
down," said Senate Chair Chris Nguyen, a
junior, describing the changes. "We're just
trying to cut it down to the normal length
of a constitution."
The current Constitution, which has re
mained unchanged since 1999, is 90 pages

in length, including an appendix.
The Senate meeting began with re
ports. including one from Publications
Director Brendan Marten on his com
mittee's meeting with Jane Camarillo of
Residential Education regarding the cur
rent door-to-door publication distribu
tion policy.
Marten called the meeting "produc
tive" and reported a planned follow-up
meeting to explore different options.
"I'm glad to hear that progress is being
made on the door-to-door distribution
policy and that Residential Education is
showing a new willingness to compromise
with student publications in order to bal
ance their goals with those of the publica
tions," Nguyen said.
