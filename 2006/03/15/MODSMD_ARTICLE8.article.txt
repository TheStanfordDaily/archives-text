Donation for Latin American scholarships
Leading a group of 35 supporters. Alejan
dro Zaffaroni and his wife l.ida last week
helped donate $10 million to benefit finan
cial aid for Latin American students. The
new Alejandro and Lida Zaffaroni Scholar
ship and Fellowship Program will support
both undergraduate scholarships and gradu
ate student fellowships.
Zaffaroni is the founder of Alza Corp.
and has aided in the creation of several other
Silicon Valley companies. An expert in
biotech and drug delivery, and a native of
Uruguay, he graduated from the University
of Montevideo, and first came to the United
States on a Fulbright Scholarship to the Uni
versity of Rochester, where he earned his
doctorate in biochemistry in 1949.
"Over the past Five decades, a generation
of individuals has been inspired byAlexZaf
faroni's values," said Isaac Stein, former
chairman of the Board of Trustees and long
time business partner of Zaffaroni. "A group
of those individuals have now come togeth
er to establish this program, to help create an

enduring recognition of Alex's core values at
Stanford University."
In 1995, Zaffaroni was recognized by
President Bill Clinton for his contributions
to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology in
dustries with the National Medal ofTechnol
ogy
Money donated for the undergraduate
portion of the Zaffaroni Program was
matched by Stanford's Campaign for Un
dergraduate Education. In addition, the
William and Flora Hewlett Foundation
matched gifts to the graduate fellowship
fund.
Ilie need-based scholarship program will
be run by the Financial Aid Office and the
School of Humanities and Sciences.

Med School Gets New Center
With the recent selection of architectural
firm NBBJ to design its new Learning and
Knowledge Center, the School of Medicine
looks to proceed with the first of five new
buildings planned for construction
over the next 15 years.
The University hopes that the
building, which will be constructed at
the current location of Fairchild Audi
torium. will fill the physical gap be
tween the Medical School and the
main campus.The primary goal of the
Center, however, will be a focus on
translational medicine and turning
research into patient benefits.
The building will contain a Knowl
edge Management Center — a bio
medical library in largely digital for
mat. The 120,(X)0-square-foot estab
lishment will also contain the Center
for Immersive and Simulation-based
Learning, where students will have a
fully-equipped operating room,
emergency department and intensive
care unit containing real equipment
and artificial patients.
"In many ways the learning and
knowledge center is emblematic of a
number of the transformational
changes taking place both in medi
cine and science in general and as it
relates to the school of medicine at
Stanford in particular," said Medical
School Dean Philip Pizzo in a recent
interview with The San Francisco
Business Times. "The fact we will
bring this all together in one site will
make Stanford a really leading edge
institution in that regard."
David Lenox, University architect
for Stanford, said that the construc
tion of the Center is an important
breakthrough for the School.
"For the school of medicine, this is
one of the most important buildings
they've built in a long time," he told
The BusinessTimes."We're very excit
ed with the opportunity to provide a
strong identity for the campus and re
ally set the stage for what is to come."

Stanford collaborates on
"spintronics"
Last week, Stanford announced a
collaboration with UCLA. UC-
Berkeley and UC-Santa Barbara to
further develop a research technolo
gy called "spintronics," targeting at in
novations in semiconductor technol
ogy-
Spintronics capitalizes on the abil
ity of an electron's spin to carry infor

mation, as researchers hope to mini
mize power consumption for new
electronics. Conventional electronics
move electric charges with no regard
to spin, while spintronics hopes to
harness this power.
"All current electron devices are
based on the flow or presence or ab
sence of charge," said James Harris,
professor of electrical engineering.
"That has worked fine for vacuum
tubes through transistors, but as de
vices get smaller and smaller, we're
working with fewer and fewer elec
trons. So we're looking for a technol
ogy that will utilize this quantum me
chanical variable. This would take
much less power than moving charges
from one place to another."
Scientists at the Western Institute
of Nanoelectronics' headquarters at
UCLA will conduct the research,
though Stanford and the other two
schools will have scientific and techni
cal input.
Six semiconductor industry spon
sors and the four schools will co-man
age the spintronics work. Philip
Wong, another professor of electrical
engineering, will work closely with

UCLA Engineering Prof. Rang
Wang, director of the Institute.
The Western Institute of Nanoelec
tomics is starting off with grants total
ing $ 1 8.2 million. Another $200 million
is estimated to come from the univer
sities' infrastructure and personnel.

team steps it up
Stanford's Bhangra team, which
performs a traditional dance from the
north Indian state of Punjab, is having
a banner year so far. Though the team
did not come close to placing in last
year's competitions, members have
seen significant improvement.
"This year, we stepped up our pro
gram immensely." said Ankur Gupta,
head captain and manager of the
team. Gupta leads the team with two
other captains, sophomore Rishi
Mallik. captain of the boys' squad,
and junior Mona Mohindra, captain
of the girls' squad.
The team competes two to four
times each year. So far. it has compet
ed at the national South Asian Stu
dents Alliance Culture Show (SASA)
in New York City and at the CSU-

Northridge (CSUN) Bhangra com
petition in Los Angeles, two of the
biggest such events in the nation. The
team received second place at CSUN,
earning a $ 1,000 prize.
"Since Bhangra has been flourish
ing as a competitive art form for the
last 15 years in the U.S., there are now
over 300 competitive teams, so simply
getting into a competition is a tremen
dous challenge and a victory in itself,"
Gupta said. "They usually only accept
10 or 11 to compete from the 30 to 60
who apply for each competition. To
cap off the year, we are applying to
compete in the nation's biggest
bhangra competition in May called
Bruin Bhangra hosted by UCLA."
Gupta is confident that the team
will continue to grow in the future.
"We have become a bhangra force
to be reckoned with in California,"
Gupta said. "We hope to make the
same impression on a national scale if
and when we get the opportunity to
compete with the nation's best
bhangra teams."

Traditional MCAT undergoes
surgery
For busy pre-meds, taking the
MCAT (Medical College Admission
Test) just got easier as the Associa
tion of American Medical Colleges
(AAMC) has thoroughly revised
the test.

The review board "adapted the
exam to a 21st century standard of
electronic reliability," according to
thcnewMCAT.com. a Web site devot
ed to keeping pre-med students in
formed about the changes.
The biggest change is that the test
will be computer-based. According to
the Web site, the computer-adaptive
testing method has many benefits, as
it is both cheaper and more accurate
than the current pencil-and-paper
method.
The new test will be offered more
frequently with 20 potential testing

dates each year. This will provide stu
dents with more opportunities to take
the test, unlike the two current options
in the spring and fall. In addition, the
new test will be five hours long instead
of the current eight, and score report
ing will be cut from 60 to 30 days.
The new process "will facilitate
the medical school application
process for both examinees and ad
missions officers," said Ellen Julia, as
sociate vice president of the AAMC
and director of the MCAT, adding
that the AAMC hopes that these
changes will enhance the MCAT

process for all involved.

Program discusses upcoming
Mexican election
Though recent coverage of foreign
affairs has focused on the other side
of the globe, changes are taking place
much closer to home.
Ihe upcoming Mexican presiden
tial election, to he held in July, was the
topic for discussion on Saturday's
"2(X)6 Mexican Presidential Elections:
A Challenge for Democracy."The pro
gram, which was conducted in Spanish
and translated into English, debated
the role that this election will play in
the shifting Mexican government.
The event was sponsored by the
Mexican Students Association in con
junction with the Knight Fellowship
Program and Yost House. The three
key topics of discussion for the pro
gram — an all-day event at Kresge
Auditorium — were the roles of the
media, political parties and civil socie
ty in Mexico.

"It was a very good event," said
law student Luis Fernando Perez
Hurtado, president of the Mexican
Students Association. "People were
very happy, and we had a lot of media
coverage."
The event was covered by both the
Mexican and local Spanish-speaking
media.
There are a number of transitions
taking place in the Mexican govern
ment that should not be overlooked,
Hurtado said.
"Everyone is focused on the Mid
dle East and Iraq," he said/'But there
are a lot of things happening in Mexi
co, much closer to the United States,
that people need to learn to analyze."

VViishu club beats Cal
The Bhangra team isn't the only
student organization to receive na
tional recognition this year, as
Stanford Wushu also enjoyed re
cent victory.
The group recently sent 10 mem

bers to the 10th annual National Col
legiate Wushu Tournament at the
University of Oregon. A dozen
schools from across the country par
ticipated in the tournament, and Stan
ford took first place with 27 medals
and two trophies.
Stanford has competed in the
tournament since 1999, two years
after the club's founding. The team
won the overall competition once be
fore, in 2001.
"We've come in second place to
Berkeley for the last five years, until
this year," said sophomore Kunyu
Ching, the Stanford Martial Arts Pro
gram representative."This victory has
been a long time in coming."
According to the Stanford Wushu
Web site, the name of the martial art
comes from the Chinese characters
"wu," which means military, and "shu,"
which means art. Stanford Wushu is a
student organization devoted to the
practice and promotion of the sport.
