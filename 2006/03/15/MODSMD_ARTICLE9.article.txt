## If film stars sported white coats... 
### 
As far as my movie knowledge goes — which is not far
in most cases — I can't recall any prominent Holly
wood stars receiving Ph.D.s in any discipline.Those of
you unaccustomed to the relentless, route-less, result-less re
search that we doctoral candidates often do. might consider it
as an inconceivable and implausible scenario and stop the
quest for a star that would have squandered the better part of
his 20's doing research.
But not me. So, I proceeded to do an Internet Movie Data
Base search which resulted in unfamiliar film industry names
like Ruth C Sullivan Ph.D. and John E. Rawlins Ph.D. If you
are like me, I won't expect you to recognize the names of the
autistic behavior consultant in 'Rain Man' and entomological
consultant in "ITie Silence of the Lambs.'
Disappointed and defeated? No way. My multiple years
of observing some of successful researchers around the
world, especially in obscure fields like my own nanotechnol
ogy, have taught me an approach — make assumptions
based on the evidence you can collect, publish it and then
wait for the reviews. If your readers argue against it and tell
you why you are wrong, you have got your answer. If they
don't, you still have your answer.
So, based on the behavior of some of the famous actors of
the day, I tried to hypothesize what would be the discipline
of choice for the actors if suddenly the film industry was shut
down and all the actors are forced to join a grad school.
I.Tom Hanks, Ph.D. Nutrition science:"Life is like a box
of chocolates". Chocolates or no chocolates, this guy
changes his body from bulky obese Hanks to lean skinny
Hanks as easily as some of us change our wardrobe (of
course, many grads are too busy or lazy to even do that). He
lost 30 pounds to portray an AIDS-stricken lawyer for
'Philadelphia.' He then gained 50 pounds for his Fed-Ex
systems engineer in 'Castaway.' Later, with rigorous diet
and exercise, he became the desert island survivor seen in
the latter part of the film. If someone knows about food in
the movie industry, it's our own Oakland boy Tom.
2. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Ph.D. History: "I will be


Hermant
Adhikari
Uniquely Grad
back".
Well, history repeats itself and so
does Arnold. He kept on coming
back over and over again with his
thick accent — what ever little he
spoke — in over-the-top, nonsensi
cal, boom-doom action films, and we
kept on paying for the movie ticket
and popcorn. Now, he has promised
to be back as governor of the state of
"Kaliphornia." Whether he will write
history by becoming the President of
the United States or will become a
small footnote in books as the "one
terminator" is yet to be seen
3. George Clooney, Ph D, School
of Business: "There's a 95-pound
Chinese man with a $160 million be
hind this door."
George Clooney's Ocean's
Eleven, Ttoelve, Thirteen and Four
teen— and 1 hope he will stop by
then — clearly demonstrate his
leadership, team work and financial
management abilities. Add the com
munications skills as evidenced in
his award acceptance speeches and
in writing 'Good Night and Good
Luck', he has a resume to be the envy
of management students.
4. Johnny Depp, Ph.D. English:"l
think we've all arrived at a very spe

cial place. Spiritually, ecumenically,
grammatically."
He has portrayed literary figures
like Sir J.M. Barrie, Ist Baronet in
'Finding Neverland' and John
Wilmont, 2nd Earl of Rochester in
The Libertine,' but he most im
pressed me with his command of lan
guage as the unlikable pirate in the
blockbuster hit movie 'Pirates of the
Caribbean: Curse of the Black
Pearl.' Just look at how he says that
the correct nautical term was to
"commandeer," not "steal" the ship;
that his intention was to "raid, pil
lage, plunder and otherwise pilfer";
his insistence on using the proper
title of "Captain" Jack Sparrow. I be
lieve I have enough evidence to pro
claim that "this is the day that you
will ALWAYS remember as the day"
when Johnny Depp's academic incli
nations were exposed.
5. Julia Roberts, Drew Barry
more, Meg Ryan, Cameron Diaz,
Keira Knightley. Ph.D. Materials Sci
ence and Engineering: Muhahah
haaaa. You didn't really expect me to
share the goodies when I'm the one
distributing it.

Heniant Adhikari is a doctoral candi
date in materials science and engineer
ing and a master's candidate in man
agement science. If you also want to

ment, send an email to adhikari@stan
