## If film stars sported white coats... 
### 
As far as my movie knowledge goes — which is not far
in most cases — I can't recall any prominent Holly
wood stars receiving Ph.D.s in any discipline.Those of
you unaccustomed to the relentless, route-less, result-less re
search that we doctoral candidates often do. might consider it
as an inconceivable and implausible scenario and stop the
quest for a star that would have squandered the better part of
his 20's doing research.
But not me. So, I proceeded to do an Internet Movie Data
Base search which resulted in unfamiliar film industry names
like Ruth C Sullivan Ph.D. and John E. Rawlins Ph.D. If you
are like me, I won't expect you to recognize the names of the
autistic behavior consultant in 'Rain Man' and entomological
consultant in "ITie Silence of the Lambs.'
Disappointed and defeated? No way. My multiple years
of observing some of successful researchers around the
world, especially in obscure fields like my own nanotechnol
ogy, have taught me an approach — make assumptions
based on the evidence you can collect, publish it and then
wait for the reviews. If your readers argue against it and tell
you why you are wrong, you have got your answer. If they
don't, you still have your answer.
So, based on the behavior of some of the famous actors of
the day, I tried to hypothesize what would be the discipline
of choice for the actors if suddenly the film industry was shut
down and all the actors are forced to join a grad school.
I.Tom Hanks, Ph.D. Nutrition science:"Life is like a box
of chocolates". Chocolates or no chocolates, this guy
changes his body from bulky obese Hanks to lean skinny
Hanks as easily as some of us change our wardrobe (of
course, many grads are too busy or lazy to even do that). He
lost 30 pounds to portray an AIDS-stricken lawyer for
'Philadelphia.' He then gained 50 pounds for his Fed-Ex
systems engineer in 'Castaway.' Later, with rigorous diet
and exercise, he became the desert island survivor seen in
the latter part of the film. If someone knows about food in
the movie industry, it's our own Oakland boy Tom.
