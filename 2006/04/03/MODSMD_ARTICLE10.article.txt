# REPAIRING AMERICA'S SCHOOLS
## NONPROFIT GROUP URGES STUDENT INPUT ON EDUCATION REFORM 
### SINI MATIKAINEN 
While most of their classmates fresh
man year were trying to navigate
their schedules and the intricacies
of dorm life, Yale University stu
dents Ethan Mutt and Aaron Tang
were trying to figure out how to reform the American
educational system. The two — who graduated in
2(X)5 — discovered a mutual interest in education re
form while they were freshmen and eventually started
Our Education, a nonprofit organization dedicated to
raising awareness and support for higher-quality and
more equitable public education in the United States.
"The more we thought about it.the more we real
ized that serious changes were needed in public schools,
which led us to think about ways that young people
could have a say in education reform,"Tang says.
Hutt and Tang have focused specifically on build
ing support among the people that the education sys
tem affects most — students.
Our Education received the Echoing Green grant,
which provides funding for "Best Emerging Social
Change Entrepreneurs," according to I lutt and Tang.

Additionally,U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.), and Rep
Cliaka Fattah (D-Pa),have praised the organization.
ITie nonprofit hopes to receive even more attention
by launching a petition demanding that local, state and
federal legislators make improving public education a
higher priority. The organization aims to collect one
million signatures from students age 13 to 24.
Fang and 1 lutt say they hope the petition will force
legislators to take students' concerns more seriously.
"Students are the primary stakeholders in educa
tion. but government representatives often don't see
them as constituents," I lutt says.
Tang adds, "If you get a million young people —
the stakeholders themselves — to stand up and say
that they are tired of legislators not devoting the nec
essary resources and common-sense policies to public
schooling, the potential for change is enormous."
More than 3,000 students have signed the petition,
including several from Stanford.
Steven Siger, a Stanford law student who was in
volved in Our Education while at Yale, says lie signed
because he feels that students are not given enough of
a chance to provide input for education policy.

While Our Education acknowledges that
[school boards, teachers' unions, legisla

tors and interest
groups] have an im
portant role to play
in formulating edu
cation policy, Our
Education aiso be
lieves that students
have equally im
portant insights
into what improve

ments and changes
our school system
needs," Siger says.
Another sup

porter, sophomore Megan
Hsu. says that her involve
ment with East Palo Alto tu

toring sparked her interest in ed
ucation reform.
"One of the most difficult things to
I 1. ~ «L'l J • iL 1 I

do is to look a child in the eyes and real
ize that he/she has so much hope still and

hasn't been hit by the harsh reality that
his/her situation is bad and the government isn't

doing enough to try to help," Hsu explains. "Chil
dren should he able to have class in actual rooms,
not trailers with no heaters or air conditioning. 1
don't understand how many things could possibly be
more important than giving all kids a fair chance."
Stanford students who have signed the petition
study topics ranging from engineering to communica
tion, but are united by the common cause.
"My studies are in electrical engineering, which
itself is unrelated to the study of education," says
senior Tim Chang. "But as a student, it's clear what
techniques work and what techniques don't. For
now. I intend to continue to study education from
the perspective of a student simply out of interest,
but 1 hope that one day I may be able to contribute
to the improvement of the American education sys
tem as a whole."
Our Education will hold a conference in 2007 for
students to outline goals for reform. It is intended to
give students the opportunity to serve in some capaci
ty on local school boards. Eventually, the organization
hopes to affect education policy on a constitutional
level. Tang and Hutt say they believe that the right to
education is fundamental and should receive the same
protection as the right to free speech.
"What's really fundamental about America?" Tang
asks. "What makes America great? At the end of the
day. almost all people will agree that it is idea that any
child will be able to grow up to be president of the
United States. For that to be true, schools will have to
do a much better job."
