# BUNCH OF MUNCH
## CANTOR'S NEW EXHIBIT FEATURES TURN-OF-CENTURY SYMBOLIST 
### AMIN EL GAMAL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Many people associate Norwegian, turn
of-the-century symbolist Edvard Munch with
his harrowing 1893 painting "The Scream,"
often dubbed the "icon of existential anguish."
Many recollect legends surrounding the theft
of the haunting piece.
Ihe Cantor Visual Arts Center's current ex
hibit "Desire, Anxiety, and Loss: The Prints of
Edvard Munch" doesn't do much in the way of
dissociating Munch from the pure pain ex
pressed in his most famous works.The forebod
ing"Self-Portrait with Skeleton Arm" (1895) —
in which Munch's head floats in a sea of obliv
ion. like a mocking death mask with only a
skeleton arm to keep it company — greets visi
tors as they enter the exhibit, an indication of

the images to come.
"These are exceptional prints; nearly any
one with some experience in printmaking —
if only with rubber stamps — can find aston
ishing accomplishments in these works" says
Patience Young, curator for education at
Cantor. "The subject of his work is also time
less: the individual's internals struggle in cop
ing with the world."
Composed of 36 lithographs, etchings, dry
points and woodcuts from 15 collections, the ex
hibit is organized into thematic categories
("Love" or "Woman," for instance).
"The themes, 1 believe, inspired the work it
self," Young says. "This was one means of divid
ing the prints into subject areas, and a most ef
fective one for visitors to view and digest what
they're seeing."
The first subject area."Lx>ss,"is a series of im

ages capturing scenes from Munch's turbulent
personal life. It includes "Death Mother and
Child" (1901). which superimposes the afore
said "The Scream" face on a little girl as her
dead mother lies in the background.The autobi
ographical quality of the piece, based on
M unch's loss of his mot her at age five, adds a vis
ceral aura to the works. The exhibit's extensive
and insightful commentary on the pieces also
reveals biographical, contextual information
that enlivens the works.
"It is widely known that Munch was a melan
choly individual, and his emotional states were
made evident in his artwork," Young says.
"What sets him apart from previous artists was
his willingness to mine the depths of his feelings
in his work and to bare his uncertainties and
self-perceived shortcomings so rawly, so per
sonally, so transparently."
Likewise, "Death in the Sickroom" (18%)
juxtaposes Munch's dead and living family
using images rooted in emotional and brutal re
ality.
Quoted in Cantor's exhibit. Munch summa
rizes his artistic philosophy: "We should paint
no more interiors, no more people reading or
women knitting. We should paint living people
who breathe, feel,suffer and love."

In this vein is the etching "Girl in a Dress by
the Window" (1894), a reaction to his sisters
heightened Schizophrenia after their father's
passing. I lere, Munch is noted for expressing
feminist ideas. These ideas are echoed to some
extent in the works of Norwegian playwright
Henrik Ibsen, for whom Munch designed the
atrical sets and programs — one of which can
be seen at Cantor's exhibit.
Indeed. Munch was part of a bohemian cir
cle of artists and writers in Berlin, including
Ibsen and Swedish dramatist August Strindberg
— this is reflected in arguably the most intrigu
ing aspect of Cantor's showroom. Hie images of
Munch's contemporary bohemian celebrities
play like pop art from an age long-gone.
Despite Munch's reputation and his claim
that he saw "all people behind their masks, smil
ing, calm faces, pale corpses, hurrying without
pause along a winding path that ends in death,"
the portraits celebrate life and hope for happi
ness. Perhaps this is reflected best in his vibrant
portrayals of the enigmatic lesbian violinist
Eva Mudix'ci, the cafe scene of "Tete a Tete"
(1894). and his own "Self-Portrait Smoking a
Cigar" (1908-09), which showcases the joy of
his last cigar after his release from a Copen
hagen clinic (and the hope that quitting smok

ing will he a source of emotional and physical
rejuvenation). In this piece, the morhid. cock
eyed visage in the previous self-portrait he
comes a whirlwind of exuberance and opti
mism — refreshing in the face of his prevailing
theme of desperation.
In accordance with Munch's bohemian in
fluences. Cantor is hosting a reading from
Ihsen's play "A Doll's House" hy American
Conservancy Theater actress Renee Augeson
and a series of concerts presented hy members
of Stanford's Department of Music.
The exhibit closes with an etching of "The
Scream." as if to remind patrons of Munch's al
leged bipolar personality.
"I think that visitors to the exhibition will
find the combination of subject matter and
technique (printmaking methods) to be power
ful," Young says. "As Marshall McLuhan said.
'The medium is the message' and in this case, the
medium really supports the message."
The Munch exhibit at Cantor opened March
22 and will run through June 25. Ihe museum is
open Wednesday through Sunday, 11 a.m. to 5
p.m.. and Thursday, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.
