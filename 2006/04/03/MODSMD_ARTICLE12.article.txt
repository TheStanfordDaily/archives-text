## Editorial Staying committed to the issues that matter 
### 
After a brief hiatus of just over two
weeks, the Editorial Board returns
to highlight important issues on
campus and in the world at large.
Since we took over in early February, we
have commemorated everything from
Valentine's Day to National Engineers
Week. We used the Oscars ceremony to draw
attention to important national debates
about homosexuality and the war in Iraq.
Likewise, we took the opportunity provided
by the Winter Olympics to reexamine the
spirit of athleticism.
First and foremost, however, the board
has a duty to weigh in on issues that are im
portant to students. To that end. we strive to
act as the voice of the student community,
representing your views and opinions.
Just before Finals Week, we wrote an edi
torial that urged professors to adopt more
thoughtful grading policies — hopefully
that translated into a couple more A's on
your transcript.
In addition, we urged the Overseas Stud
ies Program to expand its overseas centers
or be more honest about their capacities and
admission policies. We held the scientific
community at Stanford accountable for de
signing a more robust policy on animal ex
perimentation that would encourage
whistleblowing. We asked for greater trans
parency regarding the annual tuition hike,
though we have yet to hear from the Board
of Trustees.
At the same time, we've tried to get a han
dle on issues that are a little less obvious. We
brainstormed about how campus life would
be different if graduate students and under
graduates interacted more often. Before
Tommy Leep was selected as the new Tree,
we mused on what qualities we wanted to

see in a Stanford mascot.
And yet, while the Board has a commit
ment to covering campus issues, we have not
restricted ourselves to events on the Farm.
Unlike many boards in the past, we have
made a conscious effort to focus on broader
national and global issues. We have entered
into the midst of ongoing national debates
not necessarily because we had some
thing radically different to say. but because
some things are so important they bear re
peating.
We took a stance on the controversy over
the Muslim cartoons in the Jyllands-Posten
as well as Iran's nuclear plans. We called for
the tearing down of the Great Firewall of
China, and urged greater compassion for our
troops in Iraq. And our editorial on intelli
gent design sparked ongoing debate on the
opinions page. We hope that future editori
als on domestic and international affairs will
spark more thoughtful debate.
We're also pleased that many others have
stepped up to fill the gaps in our coverage.
The page provided a forum for a flurry of
discussion about the Hamas elections in late
January, as well as the Stanford Indian mas
cot. Meanwhile, columns, op-eds and letters
to the editor have covered everything from
the Clean Air Act to the Supreme Court's
decision to uphold the Solomon Amend
ment. These contributions round out the
board's perspective on the issues we cover in
our editorials, while providing a variety of
views on those issues that we don't cover.
This spring, the Board stands by our orig
inal commitment —as articulated in our
very first editorial —to challenge you to
think more clearly, to feel more deeply and
to care more fervently. We invite you to join
us in this pursuit.
