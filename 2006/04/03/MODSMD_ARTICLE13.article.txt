# Damn you, FEMA

### 
While 1 was in Louisiana over spring
break, a new set of levees strained
and finally broke under the duress
of a powerful deluge. This disaster caused
many people intense emotional and physical
agony. Metaphorically speaking.
I was in Louisiana with the Alternative
Spring Break Program working with Habitat
for Humanity to gut out Katrina-ravaged
houses so homeowners could rebuild. The
disaster occurred during our group's visit to
the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) headquarters. FEMA acted
even more inconsiderately toward me than
they had the victims of Katrina. Yes. the
FEMA officials had the audacity to make a
case for why they were not the "bad guy,"
showing no regard for how comfortable 1 had
been scapegoating them.
For every mistake, I must hold someone
responsible, find someone to whom 1 can at
tach my anger and criticism. Before hearing
FEMA's side of the story, my group and I
were positive that they were the root cause of
all the Katrina response problems. After all.
that was what the media had told us, and
they're not allowed to lie. right? It's not like
they would ever say something just to play on
people's need to play the blame game. On top
of that, all of the New Orleans residents we
talked with voiced frustration about FEMA.
They told us the agency was giving them trail
ers but not giving them keys, it was denying
requests for aid, it was tied up in red tape and
inaccessible. Even New Orleans Mayor Ray
Nagin said that "things spiraled" after FEMA
officials made promises that "weren't kept."
It was easy and fun for us to point the finger
at FEMA, to agree that it was definitely all
the agency's fault.
Imagine how disappointed 1 was when we
arrived at FEMA and 1 realized that the asso
ciation is more than just a name — it is actual
ly made up of people. It was so simple to lay
blame on them when 1 was miles away and
criticizing some abstract federal organization,
but I found it much harder to hate when I was
confronted with the bitter truth that they are
just a bunch of people doing their best —
many who have already retired and are work
ing because they really care about the relief ef
fort. It was even harder not to sympathize with
them when I found that since FEMA tries to
involve local communities in its efforts, many
employees of the Louisiana branch are actual
ly Katrina victims themselves.
As if this wasn't enough, FEMA informed
us that the agency is just a supplement to state
and local government relief efforts, and that
the effectiveness of their response is a func
tion of the effectiveness of the city govern
ment. So now I need to choose whether to
blame FEMA or the city?
FEMA's facts also hampered our efforts to
aid the tourist economy of New Orleans. On
Bourbon Street, T-shirts are sold making fun
of FEMA's failure to create an evacuation
plan. FEMA had to go and ruin the joke for all
of us by pointing out that it is actually the re
sponsibility of the city government to come up

with evacuation plans. Thanks a lot for the
buzzkill you tightwads, now I can't even enjoy
my shirt.
FEMA's reckless disregard for the truth
has left me both physically and emotionally
exhausted. Because of their wholly selfish ac
tions. my comfortable perception of FEM A as
the best target for blame has been destroyed,
and now I don't know who to accuse. The
flood of information 1 received broke the
levee that was my perception of Katrina,
plunging my mind's hunt for a scapegoat into
an impassable quagmire (now that's a
metaphor).
After much time and with much effort and
cooperation between local, state and federal
governments, recovery from Katrina can be
successful. However. I fear that the damage
FEMA has done to me is irreparable. Never
again will I be able to comfortably blame one
entity, because I will always be haunted by the
unsettling truth that in real life things are
more complicated. Damn you, FEM A.
