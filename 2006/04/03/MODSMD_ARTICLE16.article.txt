# Pandas humping for democracy
## 
### 
1 gotta hand it to the roommate — some
times he has great ideas. He's the one who
suggested I write on the current crisis U.S.
zoos are facing with China's pandas.
During the Cold War, US. zoos leased pan
das from China as a sign of "good will." World
leaders thought sending pandas to foreign
countries and having them make hot panda
love for the amusement of children would
help bring world peace. Obviously, this didn't
work. Now. U.S. zoos are complaining be
cause they can't pay the millions of dollars to
keep them here.
Personally, 1 think if pandas can't be hu
miliated for my entertainment purposes, they
aren't worthy of space in a zoo. But that is why
I'm not in charge of diplomacy. Or zoos. Pan
das. it seems, are little furry diplomats. Of
course, these pandas are some of the stupidest
animals ever. They can't even have sex. So
China gave us impotent pandas. Thanks
China. Here, we'll give you this three-legged
dog in return. Personally, I believe you should
fire someone who is paid for sex and doesn't
perform. But instead of shoving them out of
our speeding vehicle, U.S. zoos keep paying
them in hopes that they'll eventually get it on.
Pandas, when abstinent, are a big attraction it
seems. Anna Nicole Smith: not so much.
Roommate: "If we send the pandas back
to China, maybe they'll learn from the Chi
nese population how to have sex."
Overpopulation jokes aren't funny, name
less roommate. I'd prefer to be on the good
side of the most populace country in the
world, so I can receive nice contracts — like
Google. I'm not willing to compromise my

morals though. I would never reveal that my
roommate lives at 687 Escondido Road
Room 417 (outer room) and has a long list of
exploitable fears.
Maybe China won't buy my attempt at
diplomatic relations. The pandas don't seem
to be working well either. But maybe we
could send other animals to foreign countries
in hopes of bridging fissures in foreign policy.
"Panda Diplomacy" can be replaced with
other cute animals to foster world peace.
Iran,for instance,can have a nice shipment
of wolverines. The "teddy bear" of the Amer
icas, the cuddly wolverines are often great
pets.They love being placed in sacks, poked a
bit. and then purring against your face. They
are America's gift to the president of Iran.
Remember: wolverines are domestic pets and
often get lonely.They like being kept by your
unguarded bedside.
North Korea gets a jackalope. Now I
know what you are saying,"l've never seen a
jackalope." Well I've never seen Kim Jung II
score a perfect 18 on a golf course either.
While North Korea can claim imaginary
things like "democracy" and "human rights,"
we can further the bullshit-fest by sending

them a bunny rabbit with antlers. You want
to play imaginary games. North Korea? Then
you're getting jackalopes, unicorns and rab
bits that lay eggs.
Ireland gets Texas's snakes. You like that
Ireland? Yeah. That's right, we're tired of
your bragging that some saint killed all the
snakes in Ireland. Now you're getting a
whole shipload of Texas's best diamond
backs. This will hopefully take you arrogant
pricks, with your green beer and your patron
saint, and put you in your place.This will also
piss off those crazy Texans who annually
have a,get this — rattle snake roundup.They
gather snakes, and then eat them. So, ven
omous snakes: edible treat. Same sex mar
riage: dangerous threat. Ireland, would you
accept our hospitable gift of the population
of Texas as well?
I bet you are asking, well, with all these
various animals being exported out of the
United States, what will nations send to us in
return? Based on our inability to find WMDs,
some feel that sending crow for the president
to eat would be a fitting gift. Others may send
a donkey, both suggesting the view other na
tions have of him, and an allusion to the De
mocrats recent electoral successes. But I think
the best act of good will and good humor
would be if the nations of the world send the
president an animal we already know he
clearly represents: a wounded mallard, or
rather, a lame duck.

C hris built this entire column around that last
tired joke. Send complaints to eliolt@stan
