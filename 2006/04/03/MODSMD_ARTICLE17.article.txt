## Hetch Hetchy deserves to be restored to original beauty 
### RON GOOD MARSH PITMAN 
Jen Graham's recent two-part series
("Engineering for the 'Big One'?" Feb.
22) prompted us to write to make readers
of The Stanford Daily aware of a burgeoning
national issue of relevance to college stu
dents. We heartily agree with Graham when
she writes: "That we use Hetch Hetchy water
now doesn't mean that it couldn't, and maybe
shouldn't, have been another way." It could
have been another way, and it still can be, as
we will explain.
Eighty years ago, a terrible mistake was
made when Congress authorized the building
of a dam in Yosemite National Park's Hetch
Hetchy Valley — the twin sister of the mag
nificent Yosemite Valley, with booming water
falls, soaring granite walls, wildflowers, and a
free flowing river. Since the drowning of the
Valley, many have clung to the hope that it will
be restored to its natural splendor — de
scribed by environmentalist John Muir as "a

grand landscape garden, one of nature's
rarest and most precious mountain temples."
In 1987, President Ronald Reagan's Secre
tary of the Interior Donald Hodel made a se
rious proposal to eliminate the reservoir and
restore the Valley. Again Congress refused to
fund the necessary studies.
In 2003, the movement gained momentum
when a graduate student from UC-Davis
published a masters thesis demonstrating that
the dam could be removed with virtually no
loss of water for the San Francisco area. The
work caught the eye of a Sacramento Bee ed
itorial writer who authored a series of editori
als advocating restoration, and won a Pulitzer
Prize for his efforts. Since then, the issue has
caught fire, with similar studies released by
our organization and Environmental De
fense. The state of California is currently re
viewing all the studies and will shortly issue its
own analysis.
The Environmental Defense and Restore
Hetch Hetchy studies include documented
cost estimates ranging from $500 million to

$1.5 billion; surely a small price to pay for a
second Yosemite Valley. Hodel believes that
these costs can be covered by private and
philanthropic donations.
The issue has received both domestic and
international media attention, including
coverage by Time Magazine, Jim Lehrer's
News Hour, the London Guardian, and the
Boston Globe.
Harvard Public Policy Lecturer Marshall
Ganz once said, "Young people have an al
most biological destiny to be hopeful." One
can only hope that he was right in these times
of unpopular war, allegations of corruption at
the highest levels of government and natural
and man-made disasters of monstrous pro
portions. College students are in need of caus
es that inspire hope. Restoration of Hetch
I letchy Valley is such a cause.
What can you do? Visit http://www.hetch
hetchy.org and become a student member of
Restore Hetch Hetchy for $20; educate your
self, friends and family about this important
national issue; start a Restore Hetch Hetchy

chapter at Stanford. Most of all. fulfill that bi
ological destiny to he hopeful.

Ron Good is the executive director of Restore
Hetch Hetchy. Marsh Pitman is a hoard mem
