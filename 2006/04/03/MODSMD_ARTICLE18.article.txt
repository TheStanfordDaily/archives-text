Mascot woes
It is interesting, informative and instruc
tive to observe this year's "travails of the
Tree. As far as I can recall. Prince Lightfoot
was never drunk on the job. And he never got
lired until a bunch of misguided white liber
al kids needed a "replacement cause" as the
Vietnam War was winding down.
