## Law School Clinic victorious 
### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
On March 22, Stanford's Supreme Court Litigation
Clinic achieved a Fourth Amendment victory with the
U.S. Supreme Court's decision in the case Georgia vs.
Randolph. This win resulted from the efforts of Stan
ford Law School Prof. Pamela Karlan and Lecturer
Tommy Goldstein, as well as third-year law students
James Darrow. Lauren Kofke and Jason Tarricone.

According to an email from Asso
ciate Dean for Public Interest and
Clinical Education Larry Marshall,
the case involved the estranged wife
of the Supreme Court Litigation
Clinic's pro bono client giving the
police permission to search her hus
band's home for drugs. Even after
the client refused to consent to a war
rantless search, the police searched
his premises, located drugs and sub
sequently indicted him. The Supreme

Court held that "when a physically present co-occu
pant clearly refuses to permit a search, the warrantless
entry and search are unreasonable and invalid as to
him under the Fourth Amendment."
Karlan and Goldstein said they were pleased with
the finding, which sided with the Clinic's client.
"The case is important because it reinforces some
central principles of Fourth Amendment law: that the
police cannot search an individual's home without a
warrant over his objection, and that one's right to pri
vacy isn't compromised simply by living, as most
Americans do, with other people," Karlan said.
Darrow explained that the case clarifies when po
lice searches are "reasonable" under the Fourth
Amendment.
" The Court held that the search of Mr. Randolph's
home was unreasonable largely because we expect
people to stay out of our home when we say stay out,
even if our co-tenant would invite them in," Darrow
said. "The Court rejected the government's argument
that simply by living with other people we assume the
risk that those people will let the police into our
homes over our objection. Hie 'assumption of risk'
doctrine is prevalent in Fourth Amendment law. When
taken to its logical extreme, the concept has the capac
ity to overwhelm the privacy we expect when we en

trust our property to the control of others. I"he Ran
dolph decision is a welcome limit on that concept."
Chief Justice John Roberts, joined by Justices An
tonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, dissented from the
majority opinion, written by Justice David Souter.
"Like many constitutional questions that make it to
the Supreme Court, this one was not easy," Tarricone
observed. "I understand where the dissent is coming
from, but 1 think they failed to give sufficient consider
ation to the dignity of a person standing in his or her
doorway demanding that the police obtain a warrant."
Goldstein, who delivered the oral argument to the
Supreme Court with the assistance of his law student
team, noted it was a "very hard fought case in which
the justices were very engaged."
"Justice Souter seemed extremely hostile to our
position," Goldstein recalled. "So it was nice to see
him write an opinion in our favor."
Darrow noted that it was "fascinating to watch
[Goldstein] prepare to address anticipated concerns
of the Justices."
Tarricone echoed that it was "exciting to watch the
case unfold at oral argument."
"It was a great experience and I would definitely
encourage other students to take [part in] the
Supreme Court Litigation Clinic," Tarricone said.
"[Goldstein] did an excellent job and even fielded
questions from the ever-silent Justice Thomas."
The Supreme Court Litigation Clinic exposes Stan
ford Law School students to litigation before the
Supreme Court, with teams of two to five students
working on assigned cases. Students' responsibilities
include drafting petitions for certiorari and amicus
briefs as well as assisting with oral arguments, accord
ing to the Clinic's website.
"I think Stanford Law School students in the
Supreme Court Litigation Clinic learn both about the
actual legal doctrine at issue in a case and about
strategic choices advocates have to make in pitching
their argument to the Supreme Court," Karlan said.
"Clinical experience is important for legal education
because it gives students hands-on experience with
making the kinds of decisions they'll have to make
when they enter practice and puts into action various
principles they've learned in the classroom. In addi
tion, clinical education exposes students to a variety
of practice areas and makes them aware of unmet
legal needs."
