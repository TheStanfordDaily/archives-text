# FOR FAMILIES EARNING UNDER $45,000, PARENFS PAY NOTHING
## STANFORD EXPANDS AID 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford families with combined incomes
less than $45,(XK) will not he expected to con
tribute any money toward their children's
Stanford tuition. Families with an annual in
come between $45,(XX) and $6(),(XX) will also
see significant reductions in expected parental
contributions.
'Hie changes, announced on March 15, will
benefit more than 1,1 (X) students and cost the
University an additional $3.1 million in funds
budgeted for financial aid next year. Stanford
joins a select group of elite schools with the
announcement, effective at the start of the
new school year in September for both new
and currently-enrolled students.
The University hopes that publicizing the
policy will send a clear message encouraging
qualified low-income students to apply for
admission.
"Well-prepared students don't apply to
higher-cost colleges as much as their peers,"
Financial Aid Director Karen Cooper said in
an interview with The Daily. "This is a nation
al problem. One way to address it is to get the
word out to families who may not know that
financial aid is available: an education at Stan
ford can be affordable."

The announcement was picked up all over
the country by a wide range of media outlets.
University officials said they were pleased by
what they characterized as a tremendous re
sponse from parents, alumni and the media.
"We've always had a strong program for
low-income students, but what we have lacked
is the clear message to students and parents,"
Cooper said. Ten percent of student's families
at the University already make $30,(XX) or less,
she added.
Stanford remains competitive with other
top colleges in measures of economic diversi
ty, according to data collected by Economic-
Diversity.org, a project of the Institute for Col
lege Access and Success.
"From its earliest days, Stanford has had
equal commitments to excellence and ensur
ing access to students from the widest variety
of backgrounds and circumstances," Universi
ty President John Hennessy said in the state
ment announcing the new policy.
The announcement is, at least in part, an ef
fort by the University to remain a leader in its
quest for disadvantaged applicants. 1 larvard,
Princeton, Brown and Yale have also recently
implemented policies that reduce parental
contributions to differing degrees for the
poorest families.
Hennessy announced such a plan last

spring, but predicted that it would take up to
five years to implement.
A booming endowment and the successful
$1 billion Campaign for Undergraduate lidu
cation — combined with the vocal insistence of
newly-hired Dean of Admission and Financial
Aid Richard Shaw, who arrived last year from
Yale, — played a role in convincing the Board
of Trustees to appropriate the extra money.
"We decided the time was right,"said Coop
er. "There was no need to wait for five years."
The $3.1 million cost of the new program
joins the $66 million in University funds al
ready pledged for next year's financial aid
program. Roughly 76 percent of students re
ceive some form of internal or external aid.
The break for low-income parents comes
in conjunction with a 5.75 percent increase in
tuition for other families next year, bringing it
to $32,994.
The $45,(XX) cutoff was not arbitrary, as
there was some concern that wealthier fami
lies with low annual incomes but large assets
could unfairly benefit from the new program.
After assessing financial data from past years,
the financial aid specialists at the University
concluded this line would benefit the greatest
number of students who truly need aid.
"•S4S,(KM) was a logical cutoff," said Cooper.
"These families tend not to have a significant

amount of assets. Iliey generally qualify for
other aid, including Pell Grants."
"Only a small portion of our population
would be in a situation where we would not
want to give a zero family contribution," she
said. "If we tried to bring in caveats about as
sets, it would have complicated the message
we are trying to send. At $45,(MX). it's worth
taking the risk."
Last year, low-income families earning
below $45,(XM) were expected to contribute an
average of $2,650, University representatives
said. Families earning incomes between
$45.(XX) and $60,(X)0 will still be expected to
contribute a yearly average of $3.8(X). accord
ing to The Chronicle of Higher Education.
Those closer to the $60,(XX) total will see a
smaller reduced contribution — estimated at
one-sixteenth of the total contribution from

the previous year, than families who fall just
above the $45.(HM) threshold. Some parents
with incomes greater than $45,tXX) who have
multiple children in college or special circum
stances may now have no parental contribu
tion as a result of the change. While parental
contributions will move to zero, student con
tributions will not change. Low-income stu
dents will still need to take loans and work
throughout the year to pay their share.
The University spokespeople said that the
student contribution formulas at Stanford are
more generous than comparable institutions
with similar aid programs for parents. The Fi
nancial Aid office said that students can earn
enough money in six to seven hours of weekly
work study through the school year and a sum
mer job. Expected student contributions also
increase as students move closer to graduation.
