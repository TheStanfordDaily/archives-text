## Women Elite and Out Women fall one win short of the Final Four for the third straight year 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CHRISTIAN TORRES STAFF WRITERS 
ITie season came to an abrupt end for the women's
basketball team last weekend in San Antonio.
Though they made it as far as the regional final, the
Cardinal lost their Final Four bid in the last 11.5 sec
onds against LSU.
Down 60-59, sophomore guard Candice Wiggins
got the pass in and sprinted down the court, passing to
senior guard Krista Rappahahn in the right corner.
Rappahahn made the three-pointer and it looked
like the Card were in business.The illusion only last
ed a brief moment as a foul was called on Wiggins for
a charge into LSU senior guard Seimone Augustus,
negating the shot. Augustus sunk two free throws,
sealing the Tigers' win, 62-59, and the Cardinal's
third-straight year falling just one game short of the
Final Four.
For Wiggins, out of those 11.5 seconds, it came
down to one.
"I knew [Augustus awaiting the charge] was com
ing. We run that play all the time." she said."lt was just
too late. Just one second — one second and the pass
would've been there."
Head coach Tara VanDerveer and the rest of the
Cardinal were surprised by the controversial call in
the final seconds, but agreed that it was not the decid
ing factor in the game's outcome.
"I'm really proud of our team and how well we
competed, and the plays that we made," VanDerveer
said. "It just came down to some execution. I think we
had a great last shot,and it went in, but we need to im
prove on execution throughout the game."
Stanford and LSU had been back and forth in the
first half, but the Cardinal started off the second with
a 28-23 lead. A stepped-up LSU defense bogged the
Card down and the Tigers went on a 14-2 run to take
the lead. 41-35. with 12:54 left in the game. Wiggins
helped regain Stanford's advantage, only to see her

team fall behind again, struggling to capture the win
in those final, fateful seconds.
Stanford gave away easy rebounds and baskets, es
pecially to sophomore guard Erica White, who fooled
the Cardinal with her height and proved a strong,
quick presence on the court. She contributed eight of
the Tigers' lead-grabbing points, and had 14 on the
game.
The Cardinal also had to deal with Augustus, who
was named Most Outstanding Player for the Region

al All-Tournament Team. Stanford attempted to dou
ble-team her — a strategy that worked against Okla
homa's Courtney Paris two days prior — but was un
successful.
In the regional semifinal, Stanford surprised the
No. 2-seeded Sooners, both offensively and defen
sively. The Cardinal began the game on a 9-0 run, and
led the whole way to an 88-74 victory.

Freshman point guard Rosalyn Gold-Onwude and LSU guard Erica White chase down a loose ball in the NCAA
Regional Final in San Antonio. The No. 1 seeded Tigers held off the Cardinal, 62-59.
Junior center Brooke Smith led
the oftensive charge with a career
high 35 points, besting her 26 at
I'( LA earlier this season. She was
14 for 16 from the field.
"There's no other post player in
the country I'd rather have on my
team than Brooke," Wiggins said."lt
makes me happy to see her playing
her best, and I'm glad the whole na
tion got to see what we see every day
in practice and what a great player
she is."
Smith was humble about her ca
reer mark, despite praise from her
teammates and VanDerveer's con
stant cries to "Give the ball to
Brooke."
"My teammates did a great job of
finding me when I was open, and my
shots were just dropping," Smith
said.
Paris, the record-breaking Okla
homa freshman, was locked up by
Stanford's tight double-teaming ro
tation throughout the game.
"We wanted to be a presence in
there and basically make her work
for everything she gets," junior cen
ter Kristen Newlin said. "A great
player like her we're not going to
shut down, but we could contain
her."
And the Cardinal did, holding
Paris to just eight points in the first
half. Although the star post ended up
with 26 points after a second-round

surge, Stanford was able to fend off
the Sooners, maintaining a lead of at
least six points, and as many as 19.
In the previous second round of
the tournament in Denver, Florida
State had its own game plan to ex
ploit Stanford's perceived lack of
depth, but came up short, 88-70.
The Seminoles' bench outscored
the Cardinal's 32-6, but Wiggins' 34
points and Smith's 22, along with
contributions from other starters,
kept Stanford afloat.
The Cardinal saw another strong
performance in the first round
against Southeast Missouri State, es
pecially from sophomore guard and
Missouri native Cissy Pierce, who
notched 10 points. Stanford had a
blow-out 72-45 win against the Red
hawks, shaking off first-round jitters
by the second half.
The Cardinal were disappointed
that their tournament run ended as it
had the previous two years, with a
close match in the Elite Eight. How
ever, they also made it to the region
al final this year amid low expecta
tions as the No. 3 seed.
"If someone had told me at the
beginning of the year, or in Decem
ber, January, or February this team
was going to the Elite Eight, I would
have jumped for joy," VanDerveer
said. "I can't say I'm jumping for joy
right this second, but I'm proud of
our team and how everyone im
proved so much.
"I think this can be a stepping
stone for us," she added. "We have a
lot of people coming back, and I
think they'll have higher expecta
tions now."
