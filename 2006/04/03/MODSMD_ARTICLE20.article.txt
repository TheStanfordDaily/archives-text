## Women Elite and Out Women fall one win short of the Final Four for the third straight year 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CHRISTIAN TORRES STAFF WRITERS 
ITie season came to an abrupt end for the women's
basketball team last weekend in San Antonio.
Though they made it as far as the regional final, the
Cardinal lost their Final Four bid in the last 11.5 sec
onds against LSU.
Down 60-59, sophomore guard Candice Wiggins
got the pass in and sprinted down the court, passing to
senior guard Krista Rappahahn in the right corner.
Rappahahn made the three-pointer and it looked
like the Card were in business.The illusion only last
ed a brief moment as a foul was called on Wiggins for
a charge into LSU senior guard Seimone Augustus,
negating the shot. Augustus sunk two free throws,
sealing the Tigers' win, 62-59, and the Cardinal's
third-straight year falling just one game short of the
Final Four.
For Wiggins, out of those 11.5 seconds, it came
down to one.
"I knew [Augustus awaiting the charge] was com
ing. We run that play all the time." she said."lt was just
too late. Just one second — one second and the pass
would've been there."
Head coach Tara VanDerveer and the rest of the
Cardinal were surprised by the controversial call in
the final seconds, but agreed that it was not the decid
ing factor in the game's outcome.
"I'm really proud of our team and how well we
competed, and the plays that we made," VanDerveer
said. "It just came down to some execution. I think we
had a great last shot,and it went in, but we need to im
prove on execution throughout the game."
Stanford and LSU had been back and forth in the
first half, but the Cardinal started off the second with
a 28-23 lead. A stepped-up LSU defense bogged the
Card down and the Tigers went on a 14-2 run to take
the lead. 41-35. with 12:54 left in the game. Wiggins
helped regain Stanford's advantage, only to see her

team fall behind again, struggling to capture the win
in those final, fateful seconds.
Stanford gave away easy rebounds and baskets, es
pecially to sophomore guard Erica White, who fooled
the Cardinal with her height and proved a strong,
quick presence on the court. She contributed eight of
the Tigers' lead-grabbing points, and had 14 on the
game.
The Cardinal also had to deal with Augustus, who
was named Most Outstanding Player for the Region

al All-Tournament Team. Stanford attempted to dou
ble-team her — a strategy that worked against Okla
homa's Courtney Paris two days prior — but was un
successful.
In the regional semifinal, Stanford surprised the
No. 2-seeded Sooners, both offensively and defen
sively. The Cardinal began the game on a 9-0 run, and
led the whole way to an 88-74 victory.
