## USC wins two at Sunken Offensive woes doom Stanford in rubber game 
### ELIZABETH AGULAR DESK EDITOR 
After notching 27 hits in Satur
day's doubleheader, the Cardinal
bats floundered in Sunday's rubber
match. Stanford notched only four
hits and couldn't keep pace with
Southern California's potent lineup
as the Card dropped their third
straight series.
The Trojans rallied behind their
winning pitcher Ryan Cook in Sun
day's game, sending nine men to the
plate in a key eighth inning, tallying
11 hits overall. Cook, a freshman
righthander, pitched 8 1/3 innings
and held the Card (13-11,2-4 Pac-10)
to one run in the Trojans' 6-1 win at
Sunken Diamond.
"We're not a very good offensive
team." Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess said. "We're batting .260
fas of Friday]. They're .330."

Despite a slightly shaky first and
second inning. Cook managed to ex
ploit the Cardinal's weak lineup.
"He did a good job of spotting,"
said freshman leftfielder Joey Au
gust, who went 0-for-4. i le was hit
ting his spots with all of his pitches:
his fastball, his curveball and off
speed."
Stanford scored its only run of the
game in the sixth inning when John
Castro doubled to right field. A sin
gle by senior Chris Lewis followed,
and Castro scored on freshman Cord
Phelps' double-play ball.
While the overcast sky reflected
the Cardinal's dismal day at the plate,
the Trojans lit up a number of Cardi
nal pitchers. Senior righthander Matt
Manship took the loss, giving up
three runs, while Sean Ratliff served
up three more. USC scored two in the
third and one unearned run in the
fourth before their eighth-inning
rally. They might have scored more,
had Manship not pulled out of a

bases-loaded jam in the sixth inning.
"We're not very good right now,"
Marquess said. "We pitch well, we
don't hit. I've been kind of disap
pointed with our defense. We only
had one error today but we've been a
little sloppy. We just aren't playing
good baseball. We have to improve
in all phases of the game."
USC's Hector Estrella — the
only Trojan starter batting under
.300 — recorded two hits, two runs
and one RBI before being intention
ally walked his last two at-bats. Matt
Cusick, who entered Sunday's game
with a team-leading .384, tallied
three hits, two RBI and one run.

The series started off well for the
Cardinal — though a little later than
expected — with a 9-7 come-from
behind win. Friday's postponed game
was the first of two contests on Satur
day. Stanford trailed 7-3 in the sev
enth inning, but Cardinal bats came
to life in a key six-run seventh inning.
Four Cardinal finished with
multi-hit games, while senior short
stop Chris Minaker finished with
two RBI and two runs, and Lewis fin
ished with four RBI — including a
three-run dinger. Max Fearnow took
the win in relief, and (JSC's Paul
Koss was dealt the loss.
The second game was just as in
tense. Stanford put two up in the
first, after the Trojans put one on the
board. USC tied the game 2-2 in the
fourth, and from that point, six in
nings of scoreless baseball followed.
Finally, the Trojans' Cyle Hankerd

reached second base on an error by
Michael Taylor. A sacrifice bunt
moved him to third and he scored
the unearned winning run on a field
er's choice to give the Trojans a 3-2
victory, in 12 innings.
The Cardinal left 14 men on base,
including loaded bases in the 11th
and 12th innings. Nolan Gallagher
was handed the loss for the Cardinal,
while John Dunn took the win Satur
day night.
Stanford looked to even the sea
son series with a win yesterday. In
stead, the Trojans took the series, 4-2.
Stanford was bested twice in South

ern California in March, including a
16-7 drubbing.
The Cardinal next face Sacra
mento State onT\iesday and travel to
Pacific on Wednesday. The team
won't face Pac-10 competition again
until April 14.
"I don't know if there is a whole lot
we can change right now," August said.
"Just things aren't going our way. It's
the way baseball is... For the most part,
we have to keep working hard in prac
tice. Things will fall into place, we just
have to keep playing hard, keep com
peting and not taking ourselves out of
any innings like we've been doing."
