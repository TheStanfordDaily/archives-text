## USC wins two at Sunken Offensive woes doom Stanford in rubber game 
### ELIZABETH AGULAR DESK EDITOR 
After notching 27 hits in Satur
day's doubleheader, the Cardinal
bats floundered in Sunday's rubber
match. Stanford notched only four
hits and couldn't keep pace with
Southern California's potent lineup
as the Card dropped their third
straight series.
The Trojans rallied behind their
winning pitcher Ryan Cook in Sun
day's game, sending nine men to the
plate in a key eighth inning, tallying
11 hits overall. Cook, a freshman
righthander, pitched 8 1/3 innings
and held the Card (13-11,2-4 Pac-10)
to one run in the Trojans' 6-1 win at
Sunken Diamond.
"We're not a very good offensive
team." Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess said. "We're batting .260
fas of Friday]. They're .330."

Despite a slightly shaky first and
second inning. Cook managed to ex
ploit the Cardinal's weak lineup.
"He did a good job of spotting,"
said freshman leftfielder Joey Au
gust, who went 0-for-4. i le was hit
ting his spots with all of his pitches:
his fastball, his curveball and off
speed."
Stanford scored its only run of the
game in the sixth inning when John
Castro doubled to right field. A sin
gle by senior Chris Lewis followed,
and Castro scored on freshman Cord
Phelps' double-play ball.
While the overcast sky reflected
the Cardinal's dismal day at the plate,
the Trojans lit up a number of Cardi
nal pitchers. Senior righthander Matt
Manship took the loss, giving up
three runs, while Sean Ratliff served
up three more. USC scored two in the
third and one unearned run in the
fourth before their eighth-inning
rally. They might have scored more,
had Manship not pulled out of a
