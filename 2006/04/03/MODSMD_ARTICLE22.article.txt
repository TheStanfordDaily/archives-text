# MEN'S SWIMMING & DIVING
## Men third at at NCAAs Auburn captures its fourth consecutive NCAA title 
### KATHERINE BELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After earning their 25th consecutive
Pac-10 title and a No. 1 dual meet rank
ing, the Stanford men's swimming and
diving team had a shot at winning the
NCAA Championships for the first time
since 1 But,a respectable third-place
finish was the best the Cardinal could
muster two weeks ago at the national
championship in Atlanta.
The Card's 362.5 points placed them
comfortably in third, trailing only the
Auburn Tigers (480.5) and the Arizona
Wildcats (440.5). Auburn captured its
fourth NCAA title in a row, while Ari
zona outscored the Card for the first
time this season (the Wildcats fell to
Stanford in a dual meet and the Pac-10
Championships).
The Stanford men were the only team
in the top six to not win an event. Howev
er, of the 16-man squad that traveled to
Atlanta, 14 scored points for the team.
Finishing up a banner season, junior
Ben Wildman-Tobriner was the team's
top scorer, finishing second in both the
50- and 100-yard freestyles and 11th in
the 100 butterfly. In the sprint freestyles,
Wildman-Tobriner was narrowly defeat
ed, touching less than a tenth of a second
behind the winner in both. In the 100
free, he broke his own school record set
at last year's meet.

Fellow junior Hongzhe Sun, the 2006
Pac-10 Championships Swimmer of the
Meet, blazed to a second-place finish in
the 200 backstroke, defeated only by
Olympian Ryan Lochte â€” who broke
his own American record. Sun also fin
ished sixth in the 100 back.
Five other juniors stood out in At
lanta. Shaun Phillips was the only Cardi
nal to qualify for the championship final
in all three of his individual events, fin
ishing sixth in the 500 free in school
record time, as well as eighth in both the
200 and 1,650 frees. Andy Grant logged
fifth-place points in the 200 free, as well
as 10th in the 200 back, while Keenan
Newman surged from a debilitating
back injury last year to eighth place in
the 200 individual medley and 16th in
the 400 IM. Kyle Ransom and Matt
Crowe displayed their speed in the
sprint free relays. While both Auburn
and Arizona will graduate their
strongest classes this year, the strength
and depth of Stanford's junior class
bodes well for next year's squad.
Not to be overshadowed are the
team's four freshmen, all of whom
scored significant points for the Card.
Nate Cass scored in all three individual
events, placing seventh in the 200 IM,
eighth in the 100 breaststroke, and 10th
in the 200 breaststroke. His classmate,
Paul Kornfeld, earned third place in the
200 breaststroke, as well as seventh in
the 100 breaststroke. Sprinter Jason
Dunford swam in four of the five relays
and finished 12th in the 100 free and
15th in the 100 fly. The team's only
diver at the meet, Dwight Dumais,
earned ninth-place points in the one
meter and 14th in the platform.
While the future of Stanford
men's swimming is bright given the
underclassmen's impressive per
formances, the team's three seniors,
Mark Stephens, Tobias Oriwol and
Mike McLean will be missed.
Stephens, a team captain from
Chambodia, Ga., ended his Stanford
career on a high note, finishing
eighth in the 400 individual medley
in his first-ever NCAA Champi
onship final. Oriwol of Ontario,

Canada, scored in both the 2(X) and
400 individual medleys. McLean, a
distance threat from Simsbury,
Conn., competed in the 200,5(X) and
1,650-yard freestyles at the meet.
While the senior leadership will
leave a void, the team knows an
NCAA title is a reasonable goal in
future years. Wildman-Tobriner
thinks the incoming freshmen class
could have what it takes to propel
the team to a national title.
"Next year's team looks great,"
he said. "Over the past couple of
weeks we've been able to follow a
few of our incoming freshmen at
some of their meets, and they have
been performing well beyond expec
tations. Although next year's season
is still quite a ways off, some of the
guys are quite excited by how our
roster is shaping up."
