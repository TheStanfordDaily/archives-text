## Missouri St. ends NIT run in second round 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
Trailing by five with one minute to go, Chris
Ilernandez tried once again to put the men's bas
ketball team on his shoulders. He drove aggressive
ly to the right elbow, leaned into contact, sent his
Missouri State defender crashing to the floor and
drew a whistle.
But the whistle was for charging, Hernandez's
game-ending fifth foul of the day. Thus, the book
closed on his final game in a Stanford uniform, per
haps all too fittingly.
Just like he had all season, the AII-Pac-10 senior
guard had led the Cardinal to the brink of victory,
but couldn't quite push them over the hump when
it mattered most.
And as Stanford (16-14) fell 76-67 to Missouri
State (21-8) in the second round of the National In

vite Tournament, it wasn't just Hernandez, but the
entire team whose performance served as a painful
reminder of all that went wrong in a season to forget.
A consensus top-15 preseason team returning
Hernandez, guard Dan Grunfeld and forward
Matt Haryasz, three All-Conference seniors, Stan
ford was expected to kick off its season by storming
through a creampuff slate of overmatched non
conference opponents.
But. without Haryasz. the Card kicked off their
season with a 16-point rout at the hands of UC-
Irvine. The embarrassment continued with losses
away from Maples to Montana. UC-Davis and Vir
ginia Tech, and absolute shellacking at the hands of
Pac-l()foes UCLA and Southern California.
The scene was no prettier early in Springfield,
Mo. There, the bad news was that Stanford was on
pace to score just 44 points with 7:16 to go in the
first half. The worse news was that Missouri State

was on pace to hit 110.
The score read 35-14, and the 12-hour, three
flight journey to the southwest corner of Missouri
just the day before appeared to have delivered a
knockout punch to the Cards season.
"All year, we have dug ourselves into holes,"
head coach Trent Johnson told The San Jose Mer
cury News. "But we didn't give up."
Against the Bears, the Cardinal closed the half
on a 10-2 spurt. The highlight of the stretch came
when freshman forward Lawrence Hill stripped
the ball and dished it to sophomore guard Tim
Morris, who leapt high above the rim before throw
ing down a thunderous, one-handed dunk as the
halftime buzzer sounded.
The 10-2 run was part of a 28-7 stretch of Stan
ford domination that tied the game at 42 just mo-
ments into the second half, and
brought a raucous crowd of 5,664 at
the Hammons Student Center back
to Earth.
But in the second half, fouls
doomed the Card. Hernandez and
freshman guards Anthony Goods
and Mitch Johnson all fouled out in
the closing minutes, while Haryasz,
Morris and sophomore forward Taj
Finger each ended the game with
four fouls. All told, the visiting Card
were whistled for 32 fouls, and Mis
souri State capitalized on a 28-of-38
night from the free-throw stripe.
Stanford drew enough whistles to
shoot 27-of-35 from the line.
Ultimately, for all the complexities
in the game of basketball, the Cardi
nal's problem was simple: they just
couldn't put the ball through the
hoop. Great defense held Missouri
State without a field goal for over
seven minutes in the second half. But
an offense that scored just 40 points
from the field on the day could not se
cure a victory when it had the oppor
tunity.
This inability to follow through
when it matters should hardly be a
surprise for a Stanford team that fin
ished just 5-11 on the road and 4-7
down the stretch.
