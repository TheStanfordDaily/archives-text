## Missouri St. ends NIT run in second round 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
Trailing by five with one minute to go, Chris
Ilernandez tried once again to put the men's bas
ketball team on his shoulders. He drove aggressive
ly to the right elbow, leaned into contact, sent his
Missouri State defender crashing to the floor and
drew a whistle.
But the whistle was for charging, Hernandez's
game-ending fifth foul of the day. Thus, the book
closed on his final game in a Stanford uniform, per
haps all too fittingly.
Just like he had all season, the AII-Pac-10 senior
guard had led the Cardinal to the brink of victory,
but couldn't quite push them over the hump when
it mattered most.
And as Stanford (16-14) fell 76-67 to Missouri
State (21-8) in the second round of the National In

vite Tournament, it wasn't just Hernandez, but the
entire team whose performance served as a painful
reminder of all that went wrong in a season to forget.
A consensus top-15 preseason team returning
Hernandez, guard Dan Grunfeld and forward
Matt Haryasz, three All-Conference seniors, Stan
ford was expected to kick off its season by storming
through a creampuff slate of overmatched non
conference opponents.
But. without Haryasz. the Card kicked off their
season with a 16-point rout at the hands of UC-
Irvine. The embarrassment continued with losses
away from Maples to Montana. UC-Davis and Vir
ginia Tech, and absolute shellacking at the hands of
Pac-l()foes UCLA and Southern California.
The scene was no prettier early in Springfield,
Mo. There, the bad news was that Stanford was on
pace to score just 44 points with 7:16 to go in the
first half. The worse news was that Missouri State

was on pace to hit 110.
The score read 35-14, and the 12-hour, three
flight journey to the southwest corner of Missouri
just the day before appeared to have delivered a
knockout punch to the Cards season.
"All year, we have dug ourselves into holes,"
head coach Trent Johnson told The San Jose Mer
cury News. "But we didn't give up."
Against the Bears, the Cardinal closed the half
on a 10-2 spurt. The highlight of the stretch came
when freshman forward Lawrence Hill stripped
the ball and dished it to sophomore guard Tim
Morris, who leapt high above the rim before throw
ing down a thunderous, one-handed dunk as the
halftime buzzer sounded.
The 10-2 run was part of a 28-7 stretch of Stan
ford domination that tied the game at 42 just mo-
