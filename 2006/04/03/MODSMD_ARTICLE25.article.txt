## Late rally falls just short in LA 
### ANDREW LOMELI STAFF WRITER 
Trailing No. 6 UCLA, 4-0 in the sixth inning, the No. 5
Stanford softball team staged a desperation four-run
comeback Friday afternoon to tie the score heading into
the game's final inning.
But with two outs and a runner on second base in the
bottom of the seventh, the Bruins' Whitney Holum dou
bled to left field, driving in the winning run and cutting
short the Cardinal's (27-6,1-2 Pac-10) late-game rally.
"We played a tough game against UCLA and just
came up on the short end of the stick." senior infielder
Lauren Lappin said. "Four runs against an Ail-American
pitcher is a major confidence-booster, and it shows a lot
about our team."
The teams breezed though two and a half scoreless in
nings until UCLA's left fielder Ashley Herrera collected
a round-tripper in the third to establish the Bruin's 1 -0 ad
vantage. UCLA (30-3, 2-1 Pac-10) cruised through the
next two innings defensively before notching three runs
in the fifth. Sophomore pitcher Becky McCollough quick
ly forced two outs to start the inning in relief for starter
freshman Missy Penna, but the Bruins responded with a
pair of singles to load the bases. McCollough walked
home a run, and Holum knocked a single to bring home
two runs, making the score 4-0.
Lappin and freshman infielder Maddy Coon ad
vanced on a fielding error and a single, respectively, to
open the sixth inning. Sophomore infielder Michelle
Smith then singled to center to score Lappin. Sophomore
catcher Erin Howe grounded out to short, bringing up
Penna, who drove home Coon on another single to cen

terfield. With two outs, junior infielder Lindsay Key col
lected two RBI to tie the game.
UCLA's Anjelica Selden pitched seven innings, allow
ing seven hits and no walks, while striking out seven.
Penna pitched four and two-thirds innings, striking out
two and walking three while giving up seven hits. McCol
lough collected two innings, giving up one run on two
hits. Penna and Coon each notched two hits.
One day later, the Cardinal nabbed a 1 -0 decision over
No. 14 Washington (26-10.1-2). Lappin hit a sacrifice fly in
the top of the fifth to score Key for the game's solo run.
The I luskies threatened in the bottom of the seventh with
a runner on third and only one out. but Penna struck out
Washington's Dena Tyson, and Smith threw out Alicia
Matthews at first to secure the Cardinal victory.
Penna threw seven innings, fanning two and allowing
three hits and two walks.The Huskies' Danielle Lawrie
struck out 12, giving up three hits and four walks in seven
innings.
The Huskies then crushed the Cardinal, 8-0, in five in
nings Sunday. Stanford was poised to take art early advan
tage in the top of the first, loading the bases before Lawrie
struck out three in a row to end the inning.The Cardinal
would receive several other scoring opportunities in the
second.fourth and fifth innings; but Lawrie's hot arm con
tinued to rake in the strikeouts, collecting 12 for the after
noon. Entering the bottom of the fifth with a 4-0 lead, the
Huskies knocked in a solo blast, three doubles and a bunt
to collect four more runs and end the game early.
"[Lawrie] did a really good job of bearing down to get
us out." coach John Ritman said. "Unfortunately, we
couldn't take advantage of two bases-loaded situations
in the game. Washington just came out really hungry."
