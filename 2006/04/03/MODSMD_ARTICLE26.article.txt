### ALEXIS ANN PETERSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's swimming and diving
team concluded its season in Athens, Ga. with a
fifth place finish at the 2006 NCAA Champi
onships. The result continues a Cardinal tradition
of finishing no lower than sixth overall for the en
tire 25 year history of the event.
No. 1 Auburn — winners of three consecutive
NCAA titles from 2002-04 — edged No. 2 host
and defending champion Georgia by a mere 3
points, 518.5-515.5, making this the second-closest
NCAA Championships ever.
For the duration of the three-day short-course
competition Stanford held the lead against No. 6
Southern California, ultimately finishing 16 points
ahead of the Women of Troy, 209-193. California,
who overtook Stanford on the second day of com
petition, succeeded in pushing away from the Car
dinal to finish fourth with a score of 291, although

the Golden Bears remained 124 points behind No.
3 Arizona (415 points).
Despite a number of inspiring individual per
formances, the climax of the meet may very well
have come in the final race, when Stanford's 400-
yard free relay team crossed the line ahead of USC
to place ninth in the event. The squad, which con
sisted of sophomore Brooke Bishop, freshman
Madeline Rovira.junior Desiree Stahley and senior
Dana Kirk, swam to a season-best time of 3:18.84, a
key victory in securing a fifth place finish overall.
Bishop in particular stepped up, clocking in
with a personal best time of 48.38 on the leadoff
leg of the relay. Bishop's performance was the sec
ond-fastest leg in either final, and earned her to
No. 2 spot on Stanford's all-time list of top per
formers in the event.
Kirk, who anchored the 4(H) free relay and
brought home the win for the Cardinal, also im
pressed the crowd two events earlier, when she
finished first in the consolation final of the 200 fly.

Alter a disappointing performance in the prelim
inaries. Kirk's time of 1:55.76 in the consolation final
was faster than seven of the eight times posted in the
championship final. Kirk also clocked the fastest
first 1(H) split for both races (28.72). Kirk also swam
to an impressive third-place finish in the 1 (K) fly,
which was her second-best career finish at NCAAs.
Senior swimmer Kristen Caverly turned heads as
well with her third place showing in the 4(H) IM — a
career-best NCAA performance and a personal best
time — as she moved up nineteen spots from her
entry seeding. Caverly is now ranked No. 3 on Stan
ford's list of all-time top performers in that event.

the 1-meter event and 7th in 3-meter.
