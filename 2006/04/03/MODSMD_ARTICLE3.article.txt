# Taliban admit haunts Shaw as Stanford letters go out
## 
### AMIT ARORA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In his former position as dean of undergraduate
admission at Yale University, current Stanford
Dean of Undergraduate Admission and Financial
Aid Richard Shaw admitted Sayed Rahmatullah
Hashemi into the schools special student program
in January 2005. His decision has come under fire in
recent weeks with the relevation that Hashemi had

served as a diplomat of
the former Taliban
regime to the United
States in 2001 and has a
fourth-grade education
with a high-school equiv
alency degree.
Student publications
at Yale and several na
tional news organiza
tions have criticized
Yale's admissions office
and Shaw for admitting a
diplomat of an oppres
sive and totalitarian
regime. Some have also
questioned Shaw's mo
tives in the matter.
The issue caught fire
on Feb. 26 when The
New York Times pub
lished a S,(XX)-word arti
cle on Hashemi's life and
his admission to Yale. In
an interview with The
Times, Shaw discussed
his thoughts on Hashe
mi's application and in
terview as a candidate
for admission.
"When I first met him
I was a little anxious,"
Shaw said. "My percep
tion was, 'It's the
enemy!' But the inter
view with him was one of

the most interesting I've ever had. I walked away
with a sense: Whoa! This is a person to he reckoned
with and who could educate us about the world."
Following admission, however, Hashemi's
background as a diplomat for the Taliban was not
publicly discussed. He attended classes, and the
Yale student body and faculty remained unaware
of his other life.
After the article was published, Shaw received
several emails from Yale faculty regarding his de
cision to admit Hashemi. Haym Benaroya, a for
mer Yale professor who currently teaches at Rut
gers, emailed Shaw with concerns about Hashe
mi's background.

In his response, Shaw wrote that though Hashe
mi had "non-traditional roots [and] very little for
mal education," his "personal accomplishments
had significant impact."
In a second email, Shaw discussed Hashemi's
ability to contribute politically and wrote that he
has "the potential to make a positive difference in
seeking ways towards peace and democracy."
While some Yale students and alumni have ex
pressed disbelief over Hashemi's potential to
make a positive difference, others criticized the ap
parent antagonism between Ivy-League schools.
In the New York Times Magazine article, Shaw in
dicated that another student of Hashemi's caliber
chose not to attend Yale.
"We lost him to Harvard." Shaw told the maga
zine."! didn't want that to happen again."
In an email to The Daily, Benaroya disagreed
with this attitude considering Hashemi's back
ground.
"I am sure Shaw did what he thought was right
and in the best interests of Yale." Benaroya said.
"Of this I have no doubt. Clearly others, including
me,do not agree that a slot in any university should
be squandered on someone who holds the United
States and Americans as worthy of only contempt
and the object of terrorist actions. I also have a
problem given the history of the Taliban."
Shaw has not responded to The Daily's phone
calls and emails regarding this issue.
Meanwhile, the former Taliban diplomat is the
topic of much conversation on Yale's campus
today. Officially the second foreign secretary for
Afghanistan in 2001, Hashemi toured the United
States for several weeks in the spring of that year.
During his trip which included a visit to Yale, he
defended the Taliban's bombing of ancient Bud
dhist statues and the regime's treatment of
women.
Upon the attacks of Sept. 11 and the subse
quent U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, Hashemi and

his family fled to Pakistan. There,
Hashemi received a high-school
equivalency degree and, after con
sulting with close friend and CBS re
porter Mike Hoover, applied to
Yale's non-degree program for spe
cial students.
At Yale, Hashemi did not openly
discuss his background until the pub
lication of The Times article. He has
expressed interest in applying to the
University's sophomore status pro
gram at the end of this year, but re
cent publicity will likely lower his
chances.
The Yale College Council is de
bating whether to petition Yale's
administration to deny Hashemi
full-time student status. Additional
ly, U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-
Tex.) has called for Hashemi's de
portation under the Patriot and
Real ID Acts and questioned the
means by which Hashemi obtained
a 82-prospective student visa in
Pakistan.
Hashemi's admission has sparked
protests among Afghanis as well. On
March 23, Afghan Parliamentarian
Malalai Joya delivered a speech at
Yale, during which she attacked
Hashemi and criticized his admis
sion to the school.
As reported by the Yale Daily
News, Joya deemed Hashemi's ad
mission "disgusting" and an "unfor
givable insult."
Yale's Office of Undergraduate
Admission will review Hashemi's
application if he chooses to apply for
sophomore-status at the end of this
year.
Stanford Office of Undergradu
ate Admission, meanwhile, an
nounced on March 31 that 2,430 ap
plicants had been accepted to the
Class of 2010 under Shaw's leader

ship, while more than 19,900 students
were denied admission. Shaw com
mented on the strength of the appli
cant pool in an interview with the
Stanford Report.
"We were in awe of the quality of
this group of applicants," he said.
"They are an incredibly bright, tal
ented and accomplished group of
students."
