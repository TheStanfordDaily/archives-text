## Justices return to The Farm Kennedy and O'Connor relive the past in an ode to the late Chief Justice Rehnquist 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
In a return to their alma mater on March 17, two prominent
legal figures and Stanford alumni heaped praise on a third —
the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist.
US. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy and recent
ly-retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor described to an over
filled Kresge Auditorium how Stanford and the American
West helped shaped both their careers and that of the man who
would become the highest-ranking judge in the land.
At times during the hour-long program, the event felt like a
big Stanford family reunion. In remarks flowing with nostalgic
pride for a bygone era, the speakers presented an idyllic vision
of the American West as an egalitarian land that encouraged
independent and open-minded thinking.
"Rehnquist was very proud of the fact that he was from the
West and from Stanford," said Kennedy, clad in a green tie and
handkerchief to commemorate St. Patrick's Day."He felt he
brought a particular clarity because he was from the West."
Kennedy connected Rehnquist's upbringing to his strong
support for federalism and drew parallels with John Marshall's
tenure as chief justice.
"Rehnquist felt very strongly," he
said. "There's a moral and ethical
component to the idea of federalism.
It's wrong to delegate and abrogate
so much power to a remote central
authority that you are no longer free.
"We're talking about an earlier
day before a tremendous compres
sion of transportation," he added.
"There is this perception that [sense
of place] makes a difference." O'Con
nor cited Rehnquist's humility.
"Bill Rehnquist was a terrific chief
justice because, in true Western fash
ion, he acted in a very humble fash
ion," she said. "He put on no airs and
held no grudges. He tried to assign
cases in a way that would best repre
sent the Court."
She worried that the Western per
spective might be lost on the Court
with her and Rehnquist's departures.
"The Court has lost many of its
Western members," she said. "I think
that's a pretty big loss. As we got jus
tices who went to Harvard Law
School, they didn't understand West
ern water law."
Kennedy also credited the West
ern experience with instilling a sense
of equality in both Rehnquist and
O'Connor.
"O'Connor was a deep believer in
equality, and it showed in her ju
risprudence," he said."Justice O'Con
nor is thrilled to be from the West. She
learned to ride horses when Arizona
was not even 25 years old as a state."
"On the frontier, there was no so
cial status," he added. "People were
treated with equality, and then you
measured one's talents from there."
Referencing the Bill of Rights and
later constitutional amendments, he
said: "The West helped restore to the
Constitution the concept of equality that
was missing in the original document."
Kennedy said that O'Connor's
legacy as a moderate and the first

woman on the Supreme Court will he
long remembered.
"Justice Rehnquist was very im
portant for the Court hy how he
voted," Kennedy said. "Justice O'-
Connor was very important for the
Court by how she explained her deci
sion. You listened very carefully in
conference to her assessment of the
dimensions and conceptions of that
particular case.
"Justice O'Connor would never
presume to say that she owned a little
piece of America, but she owned a lit
tle piece of America's trust," he
added. "She discharged that trust in a
magnificent and splendid way."
On O'Connor being the first
woman on the Court, Kennedy said,
"She never mentioned it or com
plained about it, but being the first fe
male justice could not have been easy.
It's lonely having to be a symbol for a
great step forward."
Both speakers remembered "the
chief" as an avid reader and historian.
"Rehnquist often mentioned
Dred Scott as an example of over
reaching on the part of the court,"
Kennedy said. "It was a self-inflicted
wound, and it took decades [for the
Court] to reclaim its moral authority.
Rehnquist, as a great student of histo
ry, was conscious of this."
The two painted a picture of Rehn
quist as an exacting student and jurist.
O'Connor said that she took copi
ous notes as a student, trying to write
down everything the professor said,
while her classmate Rehnquist sat and
listened closely for the important ideas.
"He always ended the hour with a
perfect outline," she said. "He could
have made a fortune on those notes."
Kennedy related a story about his
first lunch on the Court. When asked
what Sacramento's annual rainfall
was, Kennedy gave a rough estimate.
An unsatisfied Rehnquist sent a note
later in the day informing him that the
exact answer was 18.9 inches.
"William Rehnquist did have a
powerful mind," Kennedy said. "He
was fascinated with detail and had an
attentive memory."

O'Connor said the Court "is still in
good hands."
"We have a highly qualified new
chief justice who may be there a great
many years," she said in a nod of sup
port for the recently-confirmed 51-
year-old Chief Justice John Roberts.
She took a walk down memory
lane as she told the audience about
how the law school used to be and dis
cussed the connection Stanford
alums had on the Court.
"We used to take pride that we
needed one more to be a majority"
said O'Connor, referring to the plu
rality of four justices Stanford had on
the Court until last year.
"You have lost two members of
the Court who belong to Stanford
and the West," she added.
O'Connor spoke of a time when
the Law School was located on the
Inner Ouad,calling it"the Dark Ages."
She said the Stanford Law Review
"played a very important role" in
helping her meet her future spouse.
She and her husband, John, were as
signed to cite check articles for the
law review.They started their work in
the stacks of the library.
"We finished the job at Dinah's
Shack, a pub down the road," she said
of a bar that closed in 1989. "Forty
days later, we were engaged."
O'Connor received both her un
dergraduate and graduate degrees at
Stanford before moving to Arizona.
She fondly remembered a creative
writing course she took on the Farm,
taught by the legendary Pulitzer Prize
winning author Wallace Stegner.
Kennedy graduated with his bach
elor's from Stanford. He attended
Harvard Law School before return
ing to practice in Sacramento. 1 le won
unanimous Senate confirmation to
replace Justice Lewis Powell in 1988,
after nominee Robert Bork was re
jected. Widely viewed as the new piv
otal swing justice after O'Connor's
departure, Kennedy has gained noto
riety of late for his occasional efforts
to use international precedents to
guide U.S. Supreme Court jurispru
dence.

Both speakers remembered "the
chief" as an avid reader and historian.
"Rehnquist often mentioned
Dred Scott as an example of over
reaching on the part of the court,"
Kennedy said. "It was a self-inflicted
wound, and it took decades [for the
Court] to reclaim its moral authority.
Rehnquist, as a great student of histo
ry, was conscious of this."
The two painted a picture of Rehn
quist as an exacting student and jurist.
O'Connor said that she took copi
ous notes as a student, trying to write
down everything the professor said,
while her classmate Rehnquist sat and
listened closely for the important ideas.
"He always ended the hour with a
perfect outline," she said. "He could
have made a fortune on those notes."
Kennedy related a story about his
first lunch on the Court. When asked
what Sacramento's annual rainfall
was, Kennedy gave a rough estimate.
An unsatisfied Rehnquist sent a note
later in the day informing him that the
exact answer was 18.9 inches.
"William Rehnquist did have a
powerful mind," Kennedy said. "He
was fascinated with detail and had an
attentive memory."

O'Connor said the Court "is still in
good hands."
"We have a highly qualified new
chief justice who may be there a great
many years," she said in a nod of sup
port for the recently-confirmed 51-
year-old Chief Justice John Roberts.
She took a walk down memory
lane as she told the audience about
how the law school used to be and dis
cussed the connection Stanford
alums had on the Court.
"We used to take pride that we
needed one more to be a majority"
said O'Connor, referring to the plu
rality of four justices Stanford had on
the Court until last year.
"You have lost two members of
the Court who belong to Stanford
and the West," she added.
O'Connor spoke of a time when
the Law School was located on the
Inner Ouad,calling it"the Dark Ages."
She said the Stanford Law Review
"played a very important role" in
helping her meet her future spouse.
She and her husband, John, were as
signed to cite check articles for the
law review.They started their work in
the stacks of the library.
"We finished the job at Dinah's
Shack, a pub down the road," she said
of a bar that closed in 1989. "Forty
days later, we were engaged."
O'Connor received both her un
dergraduate and graduate degrees at
Stanford before moving to Arizona.
She fondly remembered a creative
writing course she took on the Farm,
taught by the legendary Pulitzer Prize
winning author Wallace Stegner.
Kennedy graduated with his bach
elor's from Stanford. He attended
Harvard Law School before return
ing to practice in Sacramento. 1 le won
unanimous Senate confirmation to
replace Justice Lewis Powell in 1988,
after nominee Robert Bork was re
jected. Widely viewed as the new piv
otal swing justice after O'Connor's
departure, Kennedy has gained noto
riety of late for his occasional efforts
to use international precedents to
guide U.S. Supreme Court jurispru
dence.
In a return to their alma mater on March 17, two prominent
legal figures and Stanford alumni heaped praise on a third —
the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist.
US. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy and recent
ly-retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor described to an over
filled Kresge Auditorium how Stanford and the American
West helped shaped both their careers and that of the man who
would become the highest-ranking judge in the land.
At times during the hour-long program, the event felt like a
big Stanford family reunion. In remarks flowing with nostalgic
pride for a bygone era, the speakers presented an idyllic vision
of the American West as an egalitarian land that encouraged
independent and open-minded thinking.
"Rehnquist was very proud of the fact that he was from the
West and from Stanford," said Kennedy, clad in a green tie and
handkerchief to commemorate St. Patrick's Day."He felt he
brought a particular clarity because he was from the West."
Kennedy connected Rehnquist's upbringing to his strong
support for federalism and drew parallels with John Marshall's
tenure as chief justice.
"Rehnquist felt very strongly," he
said. "There's a moral and ethical
component to the idea of federalism.
It's wrong to delegate and abrogate
so much power to a remote central
authority that you are no longer free.
"We're talking about an earlier
day before a tremendous compres
sion of transportation," he added.
"There is this perception that [sense
of place] makes a difference." O'Con
nor cited Rehnquist's humility.
"Bill Rehnquist was a terrific chief
justice because, in true Western fash
ion, he acted in a very humble fash
ion," she said. "He put on no airs and
held no grudges. He tried to assign
cases in a way that would best repre
sent the Court."
She worried that the Western per
spective might be lost on the Court
with her and Rehnquist's departures.
"The Court has lost many of its
Western members," she said. "I think
that's a pretty big loss. As we got jus
tices who went to Harvard Law
School, they didn't understand West
ern water law."
Kennedy also credited the West
ern experience with instilling a sense
of equality in both Rehnquist and
O'Connor.
"O'Connor was a deep believer in
equality, and it showed in her ju
risprudence," he said."Justice O'Con
nor is thrilled to be from the West. She
learned to ride horses when Arizona
was not even 25 years old as a state."
"On the frontier, there was no so
cial status," he added. "People were
treated with equality, and then you
measured one's talents from there."
Referencing the Bill of Rights and
later constitutional amendments, he
said: "The West helped restore to the
Constitution the concept of equality that
was missing in the original document."
Kennedy said that O'Connor's
legacy as a moderate and the first

woman on the Supreme Court will he
long remembered.
"Justice Rehnquist was very im
portant for the Court hy how he
voted," Kennedy said. "Justice O'-
Connor was very important for the
Court by how she explained her deci
sion. You listened very carefully in
conference to her assessment of the
dimensions and conceptions of that
particular case.
"Justice O'Connor would never
presume to say that she owned a little
piece of America, but she owned a lit
tle piece of America's trust," he
added. "She discharged that trust in a
magnificent and splendid way."
On O'Connor being the first
woman on the Court, Kennedy said,
"She never mentioned it or com
plained about it, but being the first fe
male justice could not have been easy.
It's lonely having to be a symbol for a
great step forward."
Both speakers remembered "the
chief" as an avid reader and historian.
"Rehnquist often mentioned
Dred Scott as an example of over
