## Justices return to The Farm Kennedy and O'Connor relive the past in an ode to the late Chief Justice Rehnquist 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
In a return to their alma mater on March 17, two prominent
legal figures and Stanford alumni heaped praise on a third â€”
the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist.
US. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy and recent
ly-retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor described to an over
filled Kresge Auditorium how Stanford and the American
West helped shaped both their careers and that of the man who
would become the highest-ranking judge in the land.
At times during the hour-long program, the event felt like a
big Stanford family reunion. In remarks flowing with nostalgic
pride for a bygone era, the speakers presented an idyllic vision
of the American West as an egalitarian land that encouraged
independent and open-minded thinking.
"Rehnquist was very proud of the fact that he was from the
West and from Stanford," said Kennedy, clad in a green tie and
handkerchief to commemorate St. Patrick's Day."He felt he
brought a particular clarity because he was from the West."
Kennedy connected Rehnquist's upbringing to his strong
support for federalism and drew parallels with John Marshall's
tenure as chief justice.
