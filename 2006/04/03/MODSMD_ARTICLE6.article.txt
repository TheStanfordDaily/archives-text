How does it feel to watch people publicly discuss your legacy?
"It's a little like attending your own funeral," said recently
retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor of the dis
cussion panel she attended at Stanford on March 17.
O'Connor, the first woman to be appointed to the Court,
played a leading role as a swing vote during the historically-sig
nificant tenure of the now-deceased Chief Justice William
Rehnquist.
Her presence, along with that of Associate Justice Anthony
Kennedy, could not be ignored in the back of law lecture hall
2W. She and Kennedy were the 800-pound gorillas in the audi
ence of the Stanford Law Review-sponsored panel, which tack
led judicial philosophy and the legacy of the Rehnquist Court.
Four prominent legal scholars took sometimes disparate
views of the Court and its members during the hour-and-a-half
discussion. While each had positive comments about O'Connor,
Rehnquist and the Court, each offered at least some criticism as
well.
"This is not a court that was at all modest pre-emption," said
Law School Prof. Pamela Karlan.the panel's moderator.
