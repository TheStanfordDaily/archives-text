# Panel tackles the legacy and judicial philosophy of the Rehnquist Court
## 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
How does it feel to watch people publicly discuss your legacy?
"It's a little like attending your own funeral," said recently
retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor of the dis
cussion panel she attended at Stanford on March 17.
O'Connor, the first woman to be appointed to the Court,
played a leading role as a swing vote during the historically-sig
nificant tenure of the now-deceased Chief Justice William
Rehnquist.
Her presence, along with that of Associate Justice Anthony
Kennedy, could not be ignored in the back of law lecture hall
2W. She and Kennedy were the 800-pound gorillas in the audi
ence of the Stanford Law Review-sponsored panel, which tack
led judicial philosophy and the legacy of the Rehnquist Court.
Four prominent legal scholars took sometimes disparate
views of the Court and its members during the hour-and-a-half
discussion. While each had positive comments about O'Connor,
Rehnquist and the Court, each offered at least some criticism as
well.
"This is not a court that was at all modest pre-emption," said
Law School Prof. Pamela Karlan.the panel's moderator.
Both Justices Rehnquist and O'-
Connor made missteps on federalism
by over-relying on the 10th Amend
ment, said Judge Jay Bybee, a sitting
member of the Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals.
"Justice O'Connor made the same
mistake by trying to read something
into the 10th Amendment," he said.
"It has no independent, substantive
content."
The panel considered the changing
view of the justices on Congress and
the power of the federal government.
"O'Connor was more skeptical of
Congress," said Harvard Law Prof.
Charles Fried. "Congressional legisla
tion is written by young staffers who
are still wet behind the ears."
He noted that there has been criti
cism of O'Connor for her authorship
of the plurality decision in Hamdi v.
Rumsfeld, which accepted the admin
istration rationale that the congres
sional Authorization for the Use of
Military Force after Sept. 11 justified
the detention of unlawful combatants
while asserting a Fourth Amendment
right to due process.
Calling changes in jurisprudence
after Sept. 11 "inevitable," he added
that "the Court will have to reflect 9-
11."
Many audience members could be
seen occasionally turning their heads
in search of some kind of reaction
from Justices O'Connor or Kennedy.
O'Connor occasionally nodded her
head slightly or offered a half-smile,
but she and Kennedy remained most
ly stoic throughout the discussion,
even when they were mentioned by
name.
O'Connor left the room with her
entourage, including her husband,
when the question-and-answer period
began.

Judicial philosophy
The panelists discussed whether
judges have a judicial philosophy, and
whether that is beneficial to the Court.
The issue gained widespread atten
tion during the Senate confirmation
hearings of Chief Justice John
Roberts, who replaced Rehnquist, and
Associate Justice Samuel Alito, who
replaced O'Connor. Both nominees
were pelted with questions about
their "judicial philosophies," a buzz
word used by political partisans on
both sides of the aisle.
"Most judges, including the best,
do not have and did not have a judicial
philosophy," Fried said. "It's always
dismaying when tag cliches that jour
nalists and politicians use enter into
academic conversation."
Most new judges come to the
Court with some preconceived no
tions but find it hard to pursue any
kind of agenda once in place, Bybee
said. He noted that Rehnquist, as an
example, clearly came to the Court
believing that states are mostly com
petent to make decisions independ
ently.
"You might think you have a phi
losophy, but when it comes down to it,
you need to take each case one at a
time," said Bybee, who, as assistant at
torney general during the president's
first term, authored the highly contro
versial "torture" memo that dogged
current Attorney General Alberto
Gonzalez during his confirmation
hearings. The leaked document nar
rowly defined torture and justified
certain interrogation techniques for
suspected terrorists.
The only panelist who has not sat
on a court, Georgetown Law Prof.
Mark Tushnet, said that judges are
moderated on the court by the need
to compromise and build majorities.
A majority opinion may not fully re
flect what the judge personally be
lieves because the decision needs to
represent each of its supporting
members.
"What happens is that even if indi

vidual judges have distinctive ap
proaches, these approaches are aggre
gated as the Court acts in a collegial
way," he said.
Ideology evident
The ideological leanings of the
panelists were not so subtle at some
points.
Ronald Reagan's Solicitor Gener
al Charles Fried, in his praise for
Rehnquist, criticized the direction the
Supreme Court took under the lead
ership of Chief Justice Earl Warren
and Associate Justice William Bren
nan.

"Rehnquist came in at the slightly
waning point of the Warren-Brennan
court, which had laid waste to consti
tutional law," he said, citing rulings on
the right to counsel, habeas corpus, the
death penalty and religion.
Karlan, a former assistant counsel
at the liberal-leaning NAACP, alluded
sarcastically to Fried's remarks during
an argument about the future of the
Court.
"These [current Stanford Law] stu
dents are going to reclaim the dissolu
tion of the Warren era if I have any
thing to say about it," she said, eliciting
laughter from the audience.

losophy, but when it comes down to it,
you need to take each case one at a
time," said Bybee, who, as assistant at
torney general during the president's
first term, authored the highly contro
versial "torture" memo that dogged
current Attorney General Alberto
Gonzalez during his confirmation
hearings. The leaked document nar
rowly defined torture and justified
certain interrogation techniques for
suspected terrorists.
The only panelist who has not sat
on a court, Georgetown Law Prof.
Mark Tushnet, said that judges are
moderated on the court by the need
to compromise and build majorities.
A majority opinion may not fully re
flect what the judge personally be
lieves because the decision needs to
represent each of its supporting
members.
"What happens is that even if indi

vidual judges have distinctive ap
proaches, these approaches are aggre
gated as the Court acts in a collegial
way," he said.
Ideology evident
The ideological leanings of the
panelists were not so subtle at some
points.
Ronald Reagan's Solicitor Gener
al Charles Fried, in his praise for
Rehnquist, criticized the direction the
Supreme Court took under the lead
ership of Chief Justice Earl Warren
and Associate Justice William Bren
nan.

"Rehnquist came in at the slightly
waning point of the Warren-Brennan
court, which had laid waste to consti
tutional law," he said, citing rulings on
the right to counsel, habeas corpus, the
death penalty and religion.
Karlan, a former assistant counsel
at the liberal-leaning NAACP, alluded
sarcastically to Fried's remarks during
an argument about the future of the
Court.
"These [current Stanford Law] stu
dents are going to reclaim the dissolu
tion of the Warren era if I have any
thing to say about it," she said, eliciting
laughter from the audience.
