## Buenos días, Stanford Single 
### 
When my friends and I heard that everyone
was going to Cabo for Spring Break, we
were nothing short of disgusted. Cabo. I
mean really, could it be any more cliche? It was al
most as bad as going toTahoe over MLK. weekend or
— God forbid — Aspen over Winter Break. We are
not the Cabo-for-Spring-Break type of girls. We are
dessert-before-dinner girls, kiss-on-the-first-date
girls, wear-white-way-after-Labor-Day girls. So we
went to Puerto Vallarta, which is definitely several
miles south of Cabo.
The cheapest ticket to PV (as we affectionately
began to refer to the exotic locale) had us flying from
SFO on an airline that may or may not be named
after a cold state near Canada. This airline — I'm
going to call it "Mahaska Airlines" for lack of a better
pseudonym — evidently fashioned its fleet from fish
bones and husky pelts. Whenever we encountered
minor turbulence the plane would shake as though
we had just hit a giant flying moose. 1 would have
found the captain's recommendation to "pull your
seatbelt a little tighter" rather quaint had 1 not been
vomiting uncontrollably into my Coach handbag,but
circumstances being what they were, I could only
pray that a flight attendant would go berserk and
ram the beverage cart over and over into my partial
ly conscious body until I took a permanent siesta.
Unfortunately, the plane landed before the crew
could perform any mercy killings (to my knowl
edge).
But if the flight was hell, life was heaven at the
Lindo Mar Resort. "Lindo Mar," for those of you
who don't hablar espanol, means "Great Bar" in
Spanish. And, true to its name, the resort had an ex
tensive bar next to the ocean complete with a bar
tender who would — get this — actually speak his
native language with me. At last, five years of Span
ish class and broken conversation with my Mexican
relatives culminated in exchanges such as:
ME: Una pina colada, por favor.
BARTENDER: Para Uevar?
ME: What?
By the end of the trip, I could tell that he and I had
formed a special connection. We would play this
game where I would down several pina coladas muy
fuertes and then hand him what I guessed was the ap
propriate amount of currency. He would point angri
ly at the bill and yell the Spanish word for "more,"
and I would laugh as I stumbled away, saying that I
couldn't possibly drink any more today. What a crazy
guy.
But the best part of the trip was undoubtedly
clubbing in town with my posse of gorgeous girl
friends, doing what we do best: getting hit on by
sleazy American guys. Now being the professionals
that we are, we have secret hand signals to indicate
when we need to be saved from a particularly shady
character [Ladies: I strongly suggest you develop a
similar code with your friends. Gentlemen: Forget
everything I just said]. "Saving" a girlfriend usually
involves physically lodging oneself between the
friend and Shady McShaderson. It may also include
statements such as, "She has a very large boyfriend,"
"She has a strange rash "or "Hey, look! A wet T-shirt
contest!" This last one was particularly effective, be
cause everywhere you turned there actually was a
wet T-shirt contest in some corner of the club, with
some bevy of beauties drowning their political aspi
rations along with their clothes.
It was an incredible week, and I was very sad to
leave the Lindo Mar and my bartender friend. As we
took off in our plane, I looked down on the beautiful
coastal town of Puerto Vallarta and thought about
how lucky I was to get in touch with my Hispanic her
itage and have a real cultural experience instead of
some cliche Spring Break. It's just what every single
girl needs — to bond with her girls and seek out
something beyond the Stanford Bubble. I should do
this more often, I thought. And as the plane shakily
flew off into the sunset, I clutched my stomach and
tried not to throw up. But this time I was smiling.

Marie would like to thank Sarah, Lindsay, Laura, A lice
