# Time for a fresh start
## 
### 
By now. everyone has forgotten about
(or rather,given up on) whatever New
Year's resolutions they made in a fit of
self-discipline — likely induced by an over
load of holiday debauchery — back on Jan
uary first. Mom's Valentine's Day care pack
age trumped any goals that had anything to
do with avoiding sweets, and the gym has be
come noticeably less crowded since the sec
ond round of midterms shuffled exercise to
the bottom of the average student's to-do
list. As for those who resolved to ease up on
the partying and leave more beer for every
one else, their efforts were in vain as the win
ter doldrums left many with only a Beirut
table and a couple of ping pong balls to turn
to for comfort.
But we are Stanford students. Failure is a
foreign concept to us. Well, maybe it's not
quite as foreign as that weird guy down the
hall who wears skintight jeans and way too
much cologne, but suffice it to say that we
don't like it. Likewise, we won't let our New
Year's resolutions remain unmet if we have
a say in the matter.
Fortunately, Stanford isn't too keen on
failure either and does whatever it takes to
make sure that its students always come out
ahead, both in school and in life: what grade
inflation has done for our academic success,
the quarter system has done for our moral
victories.
Ten weeks is the perfect length of time
for a quarter. It isn't so painfully long to
make you suffer in trying to attain a goal
you've set for yourself, but it is long enough
to make you feel like you have accom
plished something when it's over. On the
other hand, if you decide that, eh, you could
n't care less about becoming a better per
son, there is no need to feel guilty; in fewer
than 100 days you'll have another chance to
start over (by which point you may or may
not care any more than you do now, but that
is irrelevant at the moment). This ten-week
resolution cycle is especially conducive to
those of us with attention spans so short that
it is a struggle to finish even a 750-word
opinions column. I commend those of you
who have read this far.
When students from other schools go on
spring break, their fun is often disrupted by
a little voice in the back of their head re
minding them of a huge midterm or term
paper that is due bright and early on Mon
day morning. Not to say that anyone actual
ly listens to that voice, but it is annoying
nonetheless. Stanford, in its incredible per
ceptiveness of youth, recognizes that only

someone whose idea of fun is doing a close
reading and analysis of John Milton's life's
work would willingly do homework while all
their friends were getting tan at the beach.
(Students like this can be found at places
where fun goes to die — places like, for ex
ample, Harvard or Yale.)
So, instead of fooling themselves with
false hopes about their students' work ethic,
Stanford's administrators have made spring
break not just a break from classes but a
break from everything that has the slightest
bit to do with school. So what if we failed
our finals and have no idea what classes
we'll be taking next week; thanks to the
quarter system, we have ten days to spend
doing absolutely nothing — and we enjoy
every minute.
After a worry-free week outside of the
Stanford bubble, we come back refreshed
and ready to start the last third of the year
with a clean slate. Now that the sun is shin
ing, our running shoes will finally get reac
quainted with the pavement. Love blos
soms like the flowers that are just starting
to poke their heads out of the ground. It's
the perfect time to make some New Quar
ter's resolutions to replace those well-in
tentioned but futile goals from a few
months ago.
Whatever you told yourself you would do
back in January, now is your chance to recon
sider. It is your chance to finish what you
started, to start what you never got around
to starting or to start something completely
different. So lace up your tennis shoes and
hit Campus Loop, pick up an extra latte at
the CoHo to get back on your roommate's
good side or go out of your way to get to
know the other students in your new classes.
You only have ten weeks, so you had better
put your time to good use.
Of course, if worse comes to worst, you
can always start over come summer.

lutions. E-mail her any suggestions at sa
lessi@stanford.edu. She probably won't keep
them, but she 'll try (at least for a couple days).
