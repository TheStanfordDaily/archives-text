# A 						little death in Amsterdam
## 
### 
Wednesday, March 29: A cool wind
blows across a rocky beach on the
French Riviera through the streets
of Nice (rhymes with "niece," small, pretty, a
den of pickpockets) over the demonstrators
in le Centre-Ville — for one day. half of
France went on strike. Strangely, overall pro
ductivity didn't change — past my table at
the Brasserie "Sur Un Plateau" ("On A
Plateau"), where I sit,sipping my tea,my skin
buzzing from a few leisurely hours under the
bright sun. This is the Cote D'Azur at the
exact moment Spring starts to bloom. Day
light Savings Time started Sunday, the clouds
cleared Monday, the beaches filled TUesday.
The palm trees, the heat — it feels like home,
except better, older, more chic (this is France,
after all).
I was in Amsterdam a week ago, starting
Spring Break (we got two weeks off, because
we're special) with a bang, or rather, a nu
clear ka-BOOM! Most people associate Am
sterdam with a citywide nonstop party, an
old-world bacchanalia with legal weed and
Dutch hookers in red-lit windows peddling
their legal selves for 15 euros (more if you
want the bad craziness). But what struck me
was the leisurely tone of it all — this isn't
Cabo, there's no wet T-shirt parties, no kegs
on the beach, no beach. It's the San Francisco
we all wish San Francisco would be, a living,
breathing city that's beyond counterculture
because they've incorporated the insanity
into their natural existence.The town is small
and full of young people biking across canals
and through lushly green parks. It feels like a
college campus in city form, where the cops
wave at you while you're smoking a jay in
stead of crashing your party because it's
quiet hours.
If I could start an artist's colony any
where, it would be Amsterdam. (1 noticed the
"Netherland Academy of Film" down the

street from my hostel and realized I had my
after-college plans all lined up). But as much
as I enjoyed wandering through the Van
Gogh museum and really GETTING IT,
man, I was happy to roll over to London after
a couple days.Too much of a good thing is vi
cious; all through the town, in the bars and
coffeehouses, you meet people in Week 3 of a
four-day vacation. London was a good hum
bling experience — nothing like a couple of
days on the Pound, where happy hour beers
cost 7 dollars, to straighten a young college
boy out.
I was in Paris for about 18 hours — far. far
too long. I'm a big fan of the Lost generation
— Hemingway, Fitzgerald, all that nihilistic
20s-era romanticism — but the Paris of today
is just awful. Part of it is the people. All unfair
French stereotypes — that they are rude, hate
foreigners and glare at you when you butcher
their glorious language — are actually spot
on Parisian stereotypes. You can recognize
them, because their brutal overemphasized
accent sounds worse than German, and that's
pretty bad. But what's even worse, sadly, is the
city itself — it used to seem so grand, an epic
ode to Old World metropolitan chic, the
artist's capital of forever. Now, it's just too big,
dirty, unfriendly. Oversold and unimpressive;
the elites may scoff, but Paris has become the
LA of Europe, right down to the race riots.
After the whirlwind first week, I came to
Nice to relax. Actually, originally I went to

Cannes for a romantic weekend with my
girlfriend, but things got awkward when we
broke up. I booked a bed in the Villa St. Ex
upery, generally regarded as one of Eu
rope's best hostels — free internet, cheap
laundry service, a dining room/bar/lounge
built in an old chapel that serves 1 euro beer,
lots of young Americans and sketchy old
Frenchmen.
1 was expecting a few days of quality
moping: sipping coffee in the cafes, wander
ing around the seashore listening to Sigur
Ros, writing bad prose-poetry in my mole
skin journal. But the sun came out, and the
world never seemed so gosh dang bright —
except for a couple of days in scorching Is
tanbul. Winter Quarter was the longest cold
stretch of my life. That's three months of
snow turning to slush, seeing my breath, the
sound of no birds chirping in the trees. Here
on the Mediterranean, it feels like summer,
except hotter. My pale German skin dark
ened immediately. My mood improved. The
sunbathers came out. My mood continued
improving.
The sky may close up again tomorrow;
next week, it's back to Germany, where it's
still too cold for beer gardens or nude sun
bathing; but for now, sitting on the brasserie
porch, watching the cars, bikes and cute Eu
ropean motorcycles rolling by, the waitress
talking in the lulling southern French accent
— all is as it should be.
The wind blows a little ash from my ciga
rette into my tea. It tastes warm, a bit spicy.
Even the ass end of a cancer stick tastes like
sweet ambrosia in Paradise.
