## Textopedia book site bought by Chegg Chegg hopes to become a unifying force in market 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
Textopedia, a book exchange site found
ed by Stanford senior Vinay Mahagaokar in
2004, has been bought by Chegg Inc.
The two companies began negotiating
this January and reached an agreement in
February. Users who type in textopedia.com
will automatically be transferred to
chegg.com, where students can log on with
their Textopedia usernames. All items that
were posted on Textopedia are now posted
on Chegg. According to Mahagaokar, be
fore the merger there were around 1,200
users, all from Stanford.
"I wrote [the Textopedia program] be
cause I knew everyone on campus had a
book that you would need but there was no
way to know who they were," he said. "I
wanted a simple system where students
could post and find books."
"The values that Textopedia had were
very similar to the values Chegg has," said
Chegg Inc. Chief Executive Officer Osman
Rashid. "The whole idea is to try and help
students save money. Chegg started out as a
book site back in 2003. But we used to get a
lot of requests from students to sell items
other than books. So we went from books to
furniture to apartment subleases to ride ex
change. We want to launch the Web site on
the West coast and Stanford is where we
want to start."
Mahagaokar will stay on at Chegg as the
head of the student advisory board. Accord
ing to Rashid, everything at Chegg is stu
dent-initiated and driven.
"I still play an active role in coming up
with marketing ideas for the site and new
features," Mahagaokar said. "The Chegg in
terface will be different than what Stanford
users are used to with Textopedia mainly be
cause it offers a broader range of services.
Chegg has a renewal policy in place to en
sure that older items are expired."

One of the new features that Chegg of
fers is a text message system for books. Stu
dents will be able to text message Chegg
while they are at the Bookstore to find out if
the book they are looking to buy is available
for less on the site.
"We wanted Vinay to be a part of
Chegg because he understood the vision,"
Rashid said. "Under Vinay we can get
input from the students. All the features
came from students; even our categories
are based on student demand. We want
Vinay to be the voice of the students with
in the company. From the Chegg perspec
tive, we are actually taking a look at your
campus lifestyle. We are bringing to the
table a lot of bigger features. Textbooks
start as a key thing on campus but then
students realize all of the other things
they can do on the Web site."
Users can also "egg" other users with an
imations of Tito, the Chegg chicken mascot.
"It's similar to the Facebook.com poke,
but our notion is really for someone to get
interested a little bit more," Rashid ex
plained. "We have big plans for Tito."
Rashid envisions Chegg as a unifying
force in the campus market.
"From what we know about the campus
classifieds, it's very fragmented," Rashid
said. "No one has really pulled it together
with an overall solution, as one big network
among students. We're going to unify. Our
approach is unique in that we're working
with students who have already built sys
tems on their own campuses.
"We have not released Chegg across
every college campus," Rashid continued.
"We are planning on doing that in the up
coming months. We're to focus on certain
campuses like UCLA, UC-Berkeley and
Stanford but also open it up to everyone. If
students at smaller community colleges
want to get together to exchange books, we
don't want to hold them back."
According to Rashid, the name Chegg
references the chicken and egg dilemma.
"One of our guys just came up with the
name," he said. "You face a lot of chicken
and egg situations everyday: do you buy this
book? Do you borrow it from someone

else? You go through it everyday Chegg is a
nice five-letter word, something a little dif
ferent from your typical name."
To promote the new service, the compa
ny will offer various incentives on campus
throughout the quarter — with prizes cor
responding to students' current needs. For
example, Chegg will offer book discounts
for the first few weeks, then move on to
other appropriate items.
"Once you're done buying books, you
need a place to study so we're giving a futon
away," explained Rashid. "As you come into
midterms we might give away a camera. It's
not only one big prize. With a lot of small
prizes everyone has a chance to win."

"Basically the idea is to give people some
incentive to try the site out," Mahagaokar
said. "We're pretty confident that if you try
it out, you'll like it and you'll keep coming
back. If everyone at Stanford is using the
site it just makes it that much more useful."
Currently, the main issue confronting the
Chegg team is growth.
"You can either grow too fast and not re
ally understand what your users are looking
for or not grow fast enough " said Rashid.
"We want to learn a little more and then
launch in a smart fashion, not take too big of
a bite. We've had very positive responses
from investors, students and professors."
Faculty members are reportedly using

the site to sell cars.
"We are off to a very good start and peo
ple like Vinay can help us get to the next
level." Rashid said. "If a student needs
something and they think of Chegg, then in
my mind we have been a success."
Mahagaokar said he would like to see the
company grow into a site where students
can not only buy and sell things they need,
but also browse for other items that are
being sold.
"Every decision we make in terms of
user interface is based on the idea that the
user should get the most useful experience
out of the Web site," he said. "So Chegg it
out."

ed by Stanford senior Vinay Mahagaokar in
2004, has been bought by Chegg Inc.
The two companies began negotiating
this January and reached an agreement in
February. Users who type in textopedia.com
will automatically be transferred to
chegg.com, where students can log on with
their Textopedia usernames. All items that
were posted on Textopedia are now posted
on Chegg. According to Mahagaokar, be
fore the merger there were around 1,200
users, all from Stanford.
"I wrote [the Textopedia program] be
cause I knew everyone on campus had a
book that you would need but there was no
way to know who they were," he said. "I
wanted a simple system where students
could post and find books."
"The values that Textopedia had were
very similar to the values Chegg has," said
Chegg Inc. Chief Executive Officer Osman
Rashid. "The whole idea is to try and help
students save money. Chegg started out as a
book site back in 2003. But we used to get a
lot of requests from students to sell items
other than books. So we went from books to
furniture to apartment subleases to ride ex
change. We want to launch the Web site on
the West coast and Stanford is where we
want to start."
Mahagaokar will stay on at Chegg as the
head of the student advisory board. Accord
ing to Rashid, everything at Chegg is stu
dent-initiated and driven.
"I still play an active role in coming up
with marketing ideas for the site and new
features," Mahagaokar said. "The Chegg in
terface will be different than what Stanford
users are used to with Textopedia mainly be
cause it offers a broader range of services.
Chegg has a renewal policy in place to en
sure that older items are expired."

One of the new features that Chegg of
fers is a text message system for books. Stu
dents will be able to text message Chegg
while they are at the Bookstore to find out if
the book they are looking to buy is available
for less on the site.
"We wanted Vinay to be a part of
Chegg because he understood the vision,"
Rashid said. "Under Vinay we can get
input from the students. All the features
came from students; even our categories
are based on student demand. We want
Vinay to be the voice of the students with
in the company. From the Chegg perspec
tive, we are actually taking a look at your
campus lifestyle. We are bringing to the
table a lot of bigger features. Textbooks
start as a key thing on campus but then
students realize all of the other things
they can do on the Web site."
Users can also "egg" other users with an
imations of Tito, the Chegg chicken mascot.
"It's similar to the Facebook.com poke,
but our notion is really for someone to get
interested a little bit more," Rashid ex
plained. "We have big plans for Tito."
Rashid envisions Chegg as a unifying
force in the campus market.
"From what we know about the campus
classifieds, it's very fragmented," Rashid
said. "No one has really pulled it together
with an overall solution, as one big network
among students. We're going to unify. Our
approach is unique in that we're working
with students who have already built sys
tems on their own campuses.
"We have not released Chegg across
every college campus," Rashid continued.
"We are planning on doing that in the up
coming months. We're to focus on certain
campuses like UCLA, UC-Berkeley and
Stanford but also open it up to everyone. If
students at smaller community colleges
want to get together to exchange books, we
don't want to hold them back."
According to Rashid, the name Chegg
references the chicken and egg dilemma.
"One of our guys just came up with the
name," he said. "You face a lot of chicken
and egg situations everyday: do you buy this
book? Do you borrow it from someone

else? You go through it everyday Chegg is a
nice five-letter word, something a little dif
ferent from your typical name."
To promote the new service, the compa
ny will offer various incentives on campus
throughout the quarter — with prizes cor
responding to students' current needs. For
example, Chegg will offer book discounts
for the first few weeks, then move on to
other appropriate items.
"Once you're done buying books, you
need a place to study so we're giving a futon
away," explained Rashid. "As you come into
midterms we might give away a camera. It's
not only one big prize. With a lot of small
prizes everyone has a chance to win."

"Basically the idea is to give people some
incentive to try the site out," Mahagaokar
said. "We're pretty confident that if you try
it out, you'll like it and you'll keep coming
back. If everyone at Stanford is using the
site it just makes it that much more useful."
Currently, the main issue confronting the
Chegg team is growth.
"You can either grow too fast and not re
ally understand what your users are looking
for or not grow fast enough " said Rashid.
"We want to learn a little more and then
launch in a smart fashion, not take too big of
a bite. We've had very positive responses
from investors, students and professors."
Faculty members are reportedly using

the site to sell cars.
"We are off to a very good start and peo
ple like Vinay can help us get to the next
level." Rashid said. "If a student needs
something and they think of Chegg, then in
my mind we have been a success."
Mahagaokar said he would like to see the
company grow into a site where students
can not only buy and sell things they need,
but also browse for other items that are
being sold.
"Every decision we make in terms of
user interface is based on the idea that the
user should get the most useful experience
out of the Web site," he said. "So Chegg it
out."
