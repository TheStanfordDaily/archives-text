## Mixed results at final meet Wrestling concludes a 7-6 season at. NCAAs 
### DENIS GRIFFIN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford wrestling wrapped up
its season at the NCAA Tournament
in Oklahoma City, Okla. March 16-
18. In a fashion indicative of the
team's season results — 7-6 on the
season and in the 4-3 Pac-10 — the
pair who made the trip east came
away with mixed results.
Sophomore Tanner Gardner (37-
13) at 125 pounds earned his first
All-American honors by finishing
eighth with an overall tournament
record of 4-3. Gardner is just the
12th wrestler in Cardinal history to
earn the sports' honor, and the first
since Matt Gentry, an alumnus who
won the national championship in
2004.
Stanford coach Kerry McCoy
was thrilled with Gardner's per
formance, even though both he and
Gardner had hoped for more.
"Obviously, Tanner being an All
American is huge — huge for the
program, huge for him, huge for me,
since it's my first year at Stanford,"
McCoy said. "It shows that we were
doing something right."
The outcome was much more dis
appointing for fifth-year senior Ray
Blake at 165 pounds, who was
bounced from the tournament after
losing his first two matches. The un
seeded Blake (41-13) faced a tough
match to start, and he dropped a 4-2
decision to fourth-seeded Nick
Baima of Northern lowa. When

Max Dean of Indiana defeated
Blake 6-4 in his next match, the
Stanford senior's college career
ended.
Still, McCoy chose to focus upon
Blake's spectacular season leading
up to the NCAA tournament.
"[He] didn't have that successful

end to the season, but this season on
the whole was a tremendous success
for Ray," McCoy said. "If nothing
happens at the end of the season, if
he didn't wrestle another match, he
had a great season."
While Blake fell short in the
NCAA tournament and failed to

earn an All-American title, McCoy
pointed out that he did manage to
defeat four wrestlers who did win
such honors earlier in the season.
Stanford's coach went on to com
mend Blake's incredible improve
ment this season, as evidenced by his
jump from a 10-5 part time contrib

utor to a team-leading number of
wins and 41-13 record.
"He inked himself in the record
books of Stanford wrestling,"
McCoy said. "That's why the tourna
ment is so hard — some guys raise
the bar, and other guys fall a little
short."
Despite Blake's early departure
from the tournament, McCoy sees
Gardner's success as an indication
that the program is headed in the
right direction.
"Obviously we can't take credit
for all of Tanner's success because
he's one of the hardest working guys
in the country," McCoy said. "But we
were able to help him on the path.
Eighth place isn't what he wanted
but he's got two more years to im
prove on that foundation."
With a 2005-06 team dominated
by sophomores and freshmen,
McCoy believes the Cardinal are
primed for future success over the
next few seasons.
"We'll basically have the same
team for the next two years," McCoy
said. "And that's a huge thing to
have because they're a confident
group but we get to have that confi
dence build. So having the youth,
but with experience, that's what we
bring to the table."
McCoy hopes that the examples
set by Blake and Gardner this sea
son will show the rest of his squad
that wrestling success possible at
Stanford, despite the program's past
failures.
"I hope that they realize that we
can compete with and beat any
body," McCoy said. "Hopefully, they
take that to heart."
