## Men's crew off to best start in 30 years Cardinal nab elusive first place at Copley Cup in San Diego 
### JOHN CHOCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Five starts and five wins into the season, the
Stanford men have already rowed into uncharted
territory — the smooth water ahead of the field.
An undefeated run at the Windermere Regatta on
March 25-26 and its first-ever Copley Cup victory
in San Diego on Sunday have propelled Stanford
to its best season-opening in three decades.
"The races over spring break were huge for
men's crew." senior captain Jake Cornelius said.
The Cardinal bested national powerhouse
Washington for the first time in 21 years at Red
wood Shores on Mar. 26, and later topped Califor
nia and an elite field of six to capture the Copley
Cup at the San Diego Classic —their first win
there since the regatta's inception in 1974.
For the Copley, the Cardinal found themselves
lined up next to seven-time defending champion
Cal in the final.The results of the preliminaries had
dealt the Cardinal a slower lane than the Golden
Bears', and a quick start by Cal put the Stanford
boat three seats behind. But the Cardinal came
back to close the gap.
"We managed to get back even by 500 meters
and pushed hard in the second 500," Cornelius said
of the 2,000-meter race. "We got most of our mar
gin on a few critical calls by our coxswain, [junior]
Alex Garcia, in the middle 1,000."
The Cardinal never looked back and finished in
6:01.4 to Cal's 6:03.79.The Bears' second boat took
third in 6:12.63. The crowd lining the course
heaped praise on the Stanford team.
"After beating Cal we got congratulations from
almost everybody we passed, half of them wearing
California colors," Cornelius said. "It was good for
the sport of rowing to have a small crew like ours
take down two of the most dominant recruiting
powers in the country."
Washington and Cal both take full advantage of
the fact that men's rowing, which predates the
NCAA, is not regulated in the same way as other
collegiate sports. Though Stanford recruits mostly
Americans and novices, the Huskies and Golden
Bears use unrestricted financial aid packages to at
tract world-class rowers, many from Eastern Eu
rope.
"The Cardinal have not defeated perennial
Pac-lOand national powers Cal and Washington in
the same season in recent memory," head Stanford
coach Craig Amerkhanian said of his team.
Both of Stanford's women's teams also made
strong showings at the Windermere and the San
Diego Classic.
After a disappointing fourth-place preliminary
finish kept the women's openweight varsity eight
out of the San Diego grand final, the women held
off a hard-charging Northeastern to capture the
