# SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING
## Women defend national title 
### JOHN CHOCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On the second night of the national col
legiate synchronized swimming champi
onships, Stanford was starting to feel more
than just cold and wet. For the first time all
season, it was in close competition. The de
fending national champion sat just ahead
of rival Ohio State — and with nerves
frayed by two long days of competition and
a week of final examinations, the Cardinal
had started to struggle in warm-ups. Lifts
had fallen, formations had cracked and
some of the girls were forgetting to smile.
"1 was getting a little nervous," Stanford
head coach Heather Olson said.
But as the squad awaited the final event
of the night — a team program prelimi
nary that would set the tone for the crucial
final day of competition — the host Cardi
nal got a pleasant surprise. The judges an
nounced the results of the technical ele
ments portion, and nine of Stanford's

women finished in the top 10. Sophomores
Courtenay Stewart. Sara Lowe, Liz Mark
man and Samantha Bongiovanni-Duclos
swept the top four places. Buckeye All-
American Becky Kim, who finished fifth,
was the lone swimmer to prevent a Stan
ford sweep of the top nine.
"That was just what our team needed to
see," co-captain Lowe said."From then on.
everyone on the team was so excited and
ready to show everyone how hard we had
worked all year."

"You can only tell them so many times that they're great,
but [to] see the results gave them the confidence to relax
and say 'This is our home p001... we can do this.'"

"I think it gave them the boost of confi
dence that they needed," Olson added.
"You can only tell them so many times that
they're great, but [to] see the results gave
them the confidence to relax and say. This
is our home pool; we do get to show off be
fore our friends and family; we can do
this.'"
ITiat evening swim, Lowe said, perfectly
set up the host team for the next-day finals.

Stanford capped off an incredible undefeated season with a solid performance at the U.S. Collegiate Synchronized Swimming Champi
onships on March 26. The Cardinal posted a score of 96, four points more than second-place Ohio State.
And in the finals, they delivered.
Lowe captured the solo title, and
she and Stewart won the duet com
petition in which Bongiovanni-Duc
los and sophomore Poppy Carlig
finished third. Stanford's trios of
Duclos, Stewart and Markman, and
Carlig, freshman Erin Bell and
sophomore Missy Knight finished
second and third, respectively, in the
three-woman swim. Ohio State
edged Markman's trio by 0.167
points; it was the only event this sea
son Stanford did not win.
To cap the final day, the Cardinal
swam to a season-high 97.167 points
in the team program and finished
the meet with % points to Ohio
State's 92. The championship is
Stanford's fourth collegiate title,
and the ninth win of its undefeated
2006 campaign.

"It really was a great competi
tion," Lowe said. "Finals was alto
gether an amazing day where no one
on our team gave up. Even though it
was the last day of competition,
everyone had huge amounts of en
ergy in every single swim. I was real
ly proud of the way the team was
able to perform just as fresh in the
final day of competition as we had
on the very first day."
Olson agreed.
"I've known all year what this
team's been capable of, and they've
worked extremely hard," she said.
"They're the most talented athletes
in the country and they really per
formed to their potential. They had
their best swims of the season all the
way around, and the results took
care of themselves."
The team trained twice a day dur
ing Spring Break for the upcoming
U.S. Nationals, to be held April 26-
29 in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where
the Cardinal hope to become the
first collegiate team to ever win the
U.S. title.
