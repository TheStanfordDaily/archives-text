# SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING
## Women defend national title 
### JOHN CHOCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On the second night of the national col
legiate synchronized swimming champi
onships, Stanford was starting to feel more
than just cold and wet. For the first time all
season, it was in close competition. The de
fending national champion sat just ahead
of rival Ohio State — and with nerves
frayed by two long days of competition and
a week of final examinations, the Cardinal
had started to struggle in warm-ups. Lifts
had fallen, formations had cracked and
some of the girls were forgetting to smile.
"1 was getting a little nervous," Stanford
head coach Heather Olson said.
But as the squad awaited the final event
of the night — a team program prelimi
nary that would set the tone for the crucial
final day of competition — the host Cardi
nal got a pleasant surprise. The judges an
nounced the results of the technical ele
ments portion, and nine of Stanford's

women finished in the top 10. Sophomores
Courtenay Stewart. Sara Lowe, Liz Mark
man and Samantha Bongiovanni-Duclos
swept the top four places. Buckeye All-
American Becky Kim, who finished fifth,
was the lone swimmer to prevent a Stan
ford sweep of the top nine.
"That was just what our team needed to
see," co-captain Lowe said."From then on.
everyone on the team was so excited and
ready to show everyone how hard we had
worked all year."

"You can only tell them so many times that they're great,
but [to] see the results gave them the confidence to relax
and say 'This is our home p001... we can do this.'"

"I think it gave them the boost of confi
dence that they needed," Olson added.
"You can only tell them so many times that
they're great, but [to] see the results gave
them the confidence to relax and say. This
is our home pool; we do get to show off be
fore our friends and family; we can do
this.'"
ITiat evening swim, Lowe said, perfectly
set up the host team for the next-day finals.
