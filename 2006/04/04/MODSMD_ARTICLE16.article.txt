# The 						Big Letdown of Big Dance
## 
### 
Certain teams just don't have
any business in the Big
Dance.
With only 64 schools invited to
the NCAA championship tourna
ment, each squad needs to earn its
spot. Or, at least, that's how it
seems.
There's no doubting the nation's
top 25 indeed belong, along with
the mid-major institutions that
were able to collect the best records
in their respective conferences.
But long after these schools
dominate their regular-season
schedules, one thing continues to
keep it interesting —conference
tournaments. The winners of these
contests win an automatic bid into
March Madness, no matter how dis
graceful their conference records
may have been.
This past season, Oregon fin
ished its regular season 7-11 in the
Pacific-10 Conference and 13-7
overall. With such a pitiful season
showing, the Ducks had no right to
claim a spot in the NCAA tourney.
Even our own Cardinal (15-12,11-7
Pac-10) had a better argument after
an embarrassing season on The
Farm.
Yet despite its humbling record,
Oregon still had one last shot at the
NCAA by winning the Pac-lOTour
nament and the automatic bid that
comes with the tourney title. Enter
ing the 10-team tournament as the
seventh-seed, the Ducks made
quick work of conference bottom
dweller Washington State. One day
later, they upset second-seed (and
No. 12 nationally) Washington, 84-
73. Oregon would fall short of com
pleting its Cinderella run, dropping
a nail-biting double-overtime, four
point loss to California in the Pac
10's semi-finals.
What if Oregon had won that
match and then gone on to upset
top-seeded UCLA? The Ducks
would have secured a low seed in
the NCAA tournament en route to
being humiliated in the first round,
probably snatching George
Mason's debatable tournament
berth in the process.
Washington and Cal had each
defeated Oregon twice going into
the tournament (albeit in close vic
tories). That's four games — four
blown opportunities for the Ducks.
And although both the Huskies and
Bears had already proved their
dominance over Oregon during the
regular season, their final run-ins
with the Ducks unjustly ended up
owning the most weight.
Teams work hard all season to
secure their spots in the road to the
Final Four, while other squads get
pounded all season long. Yet when
the regular season is all said and
done, the latter can still secure an
NCAA berth with a lucky, buzzer
beating three-pointer.
If the NCAA is going to hand
out spots based on these tourna
ments, then schools shouldn't even
bother having a regular season.
Fans already complain that watch
ing the regular season is pointless
when March is the only month pro
viding thrills, and conference tour
naments make seasons only less
worthwhile.
The Pac-10 tournament, along
with all the other end-of-the-season
conference tourneys, serves no pur
pose other than to sell extra tickets
and to grab pointless television rat
ings. Sure, these tournaments offer
a little more excitement for fans
and make things a bit more inter
esting for supporters of schools that
otherwise wouldn't have a shot of
reaching the big tourney, but over
all these mini tournaments don't
offer much else.
George Mason accomplished a
lot for mid-major schools with its
magical run to the Final Four, but it
could all be in vain if these tourna
ments continue to give preference to
the dominant conferences. A large
conference school such as Oregon
may not belong in the NCAA tour
ney, but its place in the more popular
Pac-10 gives it many opportunities to
steal a spot. Mason, meanwhile,
owned the best record in the Colo
nial Athletic Conference —and it
barely secured an 11-seed.
