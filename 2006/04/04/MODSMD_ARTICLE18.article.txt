# FENCING
## Card do well, despite short roster 
### ANDREW SHEN 
The Stanford fencing team con
cluded its season in Houston with a
seventh place finish at the NCAA
championships. Of Stanford's six
competitors in Texas, four received
All-American honors.
Seniors and previous AU-Ameri
cans Steve Gerberman and Martin
Lee renewed their statuses earning
first-team honors. Freshman sabreist
Eva Jellison was named to the sec
ond-team All America and freshman
Teddy Levitt earned honorable men
tion.
But perhaps what was most im
pressive about Stanford was that it
achieved such a high ranking with
only six fencers. All six teams ranked
higher than Stanford had more com
petitors than the Cardinal.

"We did the best we could have
done given the number of people we
sent to NCAA championships," said
sophomore Rick Fulton, who despite
not earning All-American status lost
only to under-20 foil champion An
dras Horyani 5-4 in overtime. "We
took seventh, beating Princeton and
upsetting UPenn, who had one more
person than us, and should have been
able to beat us."
Stanford head coach Lisa Mil
gram was ecstatic with the results, es
pecially since fencing is primarily an
east coast-based sport. At Western
Regionals, Stanford finished second
only to defending champion Notre
Dame, establishing itself as the class
of the west.
"Nationals went very well for
Stanford this year," captain Steve
Gerberman said. "Everyone fenced

very well and, we did the best we
have done in a few years."
This marks the end for seniors
Gerberman and Lee, but the future is
bright for the young Stanford team.
The core of the team consists of five
freshman: Jellison. Levitt, Clark
Kenney. who also participated in na
tionals, Dan Tucker, and Brittany
Leader.
Jellison has already beaten Mariel
Zagunis, an Olympic gold-medalist;
Levitt is an Ail-American, and Ken
ney. Tlicker and Leader have all
made significant contributions to the
team this past season.
One important factor that will
need to be replaced for next year,
however, is Gerberman's leadership.
"Overall, it was a good trip, and
I'm sad to leave the team," Gerber
man said.
