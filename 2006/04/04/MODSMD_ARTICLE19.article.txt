## Mayor of Taipei speaks on party, independence Speech coincides with release of Chiang Kai-shek diaries 
### KATHERINE WANG 
Mayor of Taipei and chairman of the
Kuomintang (KMT) party Ma Ying-jeou
avoided taking a stance on Taiwanese inde
pendence as he shared his thoughts on the
future of cross-strait relations between
China and its island neighbor, as well as the
party's historical ties with Taiwan, during a
talk at the Hoover Institution on March 24.
Ma's address was part of the Institution's
unveiling of the diaries of Chiang Kai-shek,
the military and political leader of the KMT
and the Chinese during World Wa/11. Chi
ang later became Taiwan's first constitution
al president when KMT revolutionaries
were defeated by the Communists during
the .Chinese civil war and forced to retreat
to the island.
The mayor's comments on Taiwanese in
dependence were notable, as he is consid
ered the likely KMT candidate for Taiwan's
2(X)8 presidential election. His popularity in
Taiwan suggests that he may be in a position
to define key aspects of the country's rela
tionship with China in the next decade.
Despite Chiang's longstanding dream
for the KM T party to recapture the main
land. the chairman did not advocate auton
omy for Taiwan.
"We would like to improve relations [be
tween Taiwan and China], but that does not
mean unification." Ma explained. He sug
gested that unification of the "two Chinas"
was not unforeseeable in the future, al
though he emphasized that it may be
decades before the time is right. In the
meantime, he contends that the primary
goal of the KMT party on this matter is to
"negotiate a settlement that will benefit the
people of Taiwan."
But Ma also asserted the necessity for
Taiwan to be recognized by the world com
munity. It lost its official nation status in

1979 when member countries of the United
Nations — including the United States —
voted to acknowledge the People's Repub
lic of China as the official nation. Since then,
Taiwan has failed to qualify for membership
in the world's most prominent international
organizations, including the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and the World Health
Organization (WHO). According to Ma,
Taiwan's efforts to establish an internation
al identity "should not be seen as Taiwan
seeking de jure independence."
As the current leader of the KMT, Ma
said that his goal is to rebuild and reform the
party along with its new generation of mem
bers, most of whom possess less of the polit
ical baggage resulting from the Communist
takeover of China. His hope is that the party
can eventually facilitate a type of reconcili
ation between the Communist party and
Taiwan, he said.
The Chiang family provided the hand
written diaries of Chiang Kai-shek and his
son Chiang Ching-kuo to the Hoover Insti
tution in 2(X)5. This event marks the first
time large portions of the generalissimo's
memoirs will be made available for public
scholarly use. Due to the uninhibited nature
of the writing, the Chiang family has chosen
to keep some passages private, though all
redacted parts will be released by 2035.
The transfer of the Chiang diaries to
Hoover represents another step in the col
laboration between the KMT party and the
Stanford think tank. Since 2(X)3,the Hoover
Institution has assisted the KMT party in
microfilming the official historical records
of the party's archives in Taipei. Of the three
million that have been microfilmed, 500,(X)0
pages thus far are available for use at
Hoover, but the project of scanning and cat
aloguing the documents is expected to con
tinue for at least six more years.
The diaries will be on loan by the Chiang
family until a suitable repository is deter
mined on Chinese territory.The Hoover In
stitution will retain photocopies of the
archives if they are eventually relocated.
