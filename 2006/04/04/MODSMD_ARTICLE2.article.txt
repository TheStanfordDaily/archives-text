# SUSPENDED
## New Tree faces similar fate as last It remains unclear whether the University or NCAA ordered the suspension 
### CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON STAFF WRITER 
What began as typical halftime
antics at the women's NCAA Tour
nament resulted in the second disci
plinary action of the Stanford Tree in
as many months, as well as conflict
ing reports as to who exactly ordered
the suspension.
At halftime of the March 20
women's basketball game, played at
the Pepsi Center in Denver, newly
crowned Tree Tommy Leep was
asked by facility officials to stop
playing with certain objects under
neath the basket standard, including
a mop and a cameraman's chair.
Soon after, Leep was asked to move
into the tunnel by court staff after
stepping onto the court as a part of
the Band's choreography of " ITie
William Tell Overture."

Leep, a senior,continued to dance
in the tunnel, drawing the attention
of ESPN's cameras, at which point
facility officials forced him to re
move his costume and take a seat be
hind the Band.The Cardinal won the
second-round game against Florida
State, 88-70.
Leep's statements to the San Jose
Mercury News suggest he saw the in
cident as a misunderstanding and
miscommunication: "There were a
bunch of little steps involved and a
bunch of little requests. I had no
problem honoring the requests, but
they weren't very clear."
Two Athletic Department offi
cials subsequently informed the
Band that the NCAA had officially
reprimanded Stanford for the Tree's
behavior, and that the I'ree would be
suspended for the remainder of the
tournament. Band spokesperson
Sam Urmy said the band had been
given the impression that the NCAA
had ordered the suspension.

suspended for the remainder of the NCAA tournament for his actions.
