# SUSPENDED
## New Tree faces similar fate as last It remains unclear whether the University or NCAA ordered the suspension 
### CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON STAFF WRITER 
What began as typical halftime
antics at the women's NCAA Tour
nament resulted in the second disci
plinary action of the Stanford Tree in
as many months, as well as conflict
ing reports as to who exactly ordered
the suspension.
At halftime of the March 20
women's basketball game, played at
the Pepsi Center in Denver, newly
crowned Tree Tommy Leep was
asked by facility officials to stop
playing with certain objects under
neath the basket standard, including
a mop and a cameraman's chair.
Soon after, Leep was asked to move
into the tunnel by court staff after
stepping onto the court as a part of
the Band's choreography of " ITie
William Tell Overture."

Leep, a senior,continued to dance
in the tunnel, drawing the attention
of ESPN's cameras, at which point
facility officials forced him to re
move his costume and take a seat be
hind the Band.The Cardinal won the
second-round game against Florida
State, 88-70.
Leep's statements to the San Jose
Mercury News suggest he saw the in
cident as a misunderstanding and
miscommunication: "There were a
bunch of little steps involved and a
bunch of little requests. I had no
problem honoring the requests, but
they weren't very clear."
Two Athletic Department offi
cials subsequently informed the
Band that the NCAA had officially
reprimanded Stanford for the Tree's
behavior, and that the I'ree would be
suspended for the remainder of the
tournament. Band spokesperson
Sam Urmy said the band had been
given the impression that the NCAA
had ordered the suspension.


JAMES CHAN/The Stanford Daily
Senior Tommy Leep, seen here during Tree Week tryouts in White Plaza, drew
more attention than usual at the women's basketball game March 20. He was
suspended for the remainder of the NCAA tournament for his actions.
The punishment was seen as
heavy-handed by the Band, and in
what Urmy described as "arboreal
solidarity," members of the Band
wore pieces of tree foliage and shrub
bery during the team's final two
games, a Sweet 16 win over Okla
homa and an Elite Eight loss to
Louisiana State. A "Free the TVee"
banner, visible on television broad
casts, accompanied the Band's cos
tuming.
The veracity of the athletic depart
ment's explanation was brought into
question by a communique from the
NCAA's basketball office. After re
turning to campus, an associate of the
Band showed Urmy an e-mail from
Andrea Williams, the NCAA's Direc

tor of Division I Basketball. Williams'
e-mail stated twice that the decision
to suspend the Tree was made by
Stanford and not the NCAA.
While Leep lamented the distrac
tion from the team's success — the
Cardinal came close to their first Final
Four since 1997 — he reiterated his
role as a mascot to "add value to a
spectator sport."
Leep's suspension comes on the
heels of the dismissal of previous Tree
Erin Lashnits, a coterminal student
involved in a series of alcohol- and
protocol-related incidents. Lashnits
was booted from the Band after she
ran afoul of the Band's alcohol proba
tion, reportedly blowing a blood alco
hol content of 0.157 percent during a

Feb. 9 game at California. Her depar
ture left the Band unable to send
Trees to both the men's and women's
postseason contests.
Leep won the role of Tree after an
intense competition among candi
dates, involving bizarre skits, untold
amounts of various fluids including
syrup and fake blood, a chair made of
nails, a go-kart race and a bra made of
Laffy Taffy. Leep himself proved his
worth in part by streaking at the
men's game versus Arizona on Feb.
19, and being pilloried and pelted
with fruit during Tree Week.
Requests for comment sent to the
athletic department went without
reply. Leep and Lashnits also declined
comment.
