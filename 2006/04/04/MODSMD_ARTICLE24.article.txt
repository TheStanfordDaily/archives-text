# New walking tour gives glimpse into Stanford's history
## Quakes remembered University recovered from $160 million in damages in '89 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
A new walking tour showcases the signif
icance of earthquakes to the history of the
University. As the centennial of the 1906 San
Francisco trembler approaches, planners say
they hope the self-guided tour shows how al
most every part of campus has been touched
in some way by an earthquake.
"Stanford's history is strongly linked to
the 1906 earthquake," said Racquel Hagen,
an administrator in the Civil and Environ
mental Engineering (CEE) Department and
an organizer of the University's Quake '06
Centennial Alliance, the group sponsoring
the walking tour.

"The walking tour's purpose is to not only
give a glimpse into the history of Stanford,
but to also understand how that history
shaped the University, and to give a sense of
how far Stanford has progressed," she added.
"The more I researched, the more 1 real
ized how integral earthquakes are to Stan
ford's identity," said senior Laura Surma, one
of the tour's leading organizers.
She developed a passion for the project
during an internship with CEE Prof. Greg
Deierlein in the summer of 2004. The project
allowed her to combine her interest in histo
ry and architecture in a practical way.
She characterized the 7.1-magnitude
Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989 as one of her
strongest childhood memories. She remem
bers being in the bathroom at a friend's
house when the shaking began, sparking an
interest that eventually led her to help with
the Quake Alliance.

"Since I was too young to fully compre
hend the danger of earthquakes, the experi
ence was somewhat exhilarating and mar
velous because it was so dramatic and so un
expected," she said. "Although I am not an
earthquake engineer or geologist like many
of the faculty members on the committee, 1
grew up in the Bay Area and feel that earth
quakes and earthquake history are very rele
vant to my life and will continue to be rele
vant."
She used a research grant from the CEE
department last summer to work with archi
tects, archivists and engineers to select sites,
complete research and draft the text of the
signs.
Each of the 11 posters on the walk ad
dresses a key theme, including earthquake
impacts on prestige, the evolution of earth-
quake engineering methods and the
economics of earthquake recovery
efforts.
"There were originally several
other sites under consideration, but
we narrowed it down to make it eas
ier to walk and in order to focus on a
different issue at each site," Hagen
said.
Stanford's history is one of re
silience, a tradition of overcoming
obstacles. The organizers tried to
convey the deeply-ingrained institu
tional desire to persevere — one
reason why administrators believe
the University emerged stronger
after the major quakes in 1906 and
1989.
"Stanford was born from adversi
ty — the Stanford family was memo
rializing their deceased teenage son
— and similarly, Stanford has risen
from it again and again," Surma said.
"One-third of the campus was de
stroyed in 1906. I doubt anyone at
the time would have guessed that
Stanford would come back to take a
seat at the table with other world
class institutions like Harvard, Ox
ford and Cambridge."
Encina Hall, now the political sci
ence building, was the first all-male
dorm on campus. When the earth
quake rendered it uninhabitable, a
temporary tent city was erected in
the field outside.The sign outside the
building juxtaposes the developed
land of today with the makeshift
shantytown set up 1 (X) years ago.
Even with their own housing de
stroyed, this same sign at stop six tells
of extensive student mobilization to
help with recovery efforts around
the Bay Area.
"The walking tour is not just
about the science of earthquakes, but
it is a human story about the way that
Stanford handled the tumultuous
event," Surma said. "I think that stu
dents will most enjoy the display at
Encina Hall, which relates to the
theme of student life."

When the University was stuck
with more than $160 million in dam
age after the 1989 earthquake,gener
ous alumni and a healthy endow
ment, paired with federal assistance
helped get the campus back on its
feet. The Bing Wing of Green Li
brary. exhibit 7, is highlighted as a
testament to the help Stanford re
ceived in a time of true need.
Today, the University is known as
a leader in earthquake research.
Multiple stops on the tour show how
the tragedy of the quake manifested
itself in the desire to limit damage in
future disasters and to protect build
ings from seismic stress.
"Much of the vital research that
has been done on earthquakes and
earthquake engineering is a direct
result of that [1906] event," Hagen
said. "Many innovative earthquake
engineering techniques have been
used to retrofit [upgrade] the cam
pus, and Stanford has become a
leader on earthquake prepared
ness."
Analysis of the seismic data from
1906 helped Stanford geologists con
firm the Elastic Rebound Theory
and significantly broadened scientif
ic understanding of plate tectonics.
The Blume Earthquake Engineering
Center, stop 9 on the tour, recognizes
the contributions of several "pio
neering researchers" who did their
work on The Farm.
With better understanding of an
earthquake's nature, the University
has continually upgraded its archi
tectural engineering. Walking the
tour illuminates different trends in
construction over the years. The "gut
and stuff" technique used to retrofit
Building 380 is contrasted on sign 5
with the careful attention to detail in
the preservation of the Language
Corner during the 19905.
When the University concluded
that the Mitchell Earth Sciences
Building (stop 10) was not safe, it
completed a seismic retrofit in 1997.

When Memorial Church (stop 4)
lost its spire in 1906 and what is now
the Cantor Arts Center (stop 1) sus
tained heavy damage in 1989, the
University used new methods to
make both stronger than before.
Sometimes engineers conclude
that buildings should not be fixed. A
sign explains the rationale for what is
labeled post-destruction decisions'
outside the abandoned Old Chem
istry' Building (stop 2).
"On a broader level, earthquakes
force us to examine our priorities
and reanalyze the way Stanford
functions," Surma said."They help us
figure out what is important and take
us in new directions."
The 1906 quake still informs deci
sion making in preparation for the
next big quake. At stop 9, precau
tions for future disasters are out
lined.
"The unfortunate reality of living
in this beautiful area is that we are

prone to earthquakes," Hagen said.
"We have a 62 percent chance of ex
periencing a major earthquake in the
next 30 years."
The signs initially debuted in
March before the last lecture in a se
ries about the 1906 earthquake. The
signs were placed around campus on
Monday.
Organizers said this week that the
response has been positive.
"I am already surprised at how ef
fective the tour has been in increas
ing awareness," Surma said. "It's im
possible not to be curious, especially
at a site like Old Chem that is fre
quently a source of wonder."
The tour takes anywhere from
one to two hours. Maps are available
at the Visitor's Center in Memorial
Auditorium and at the Blume Earth
quake Engineering Center.
Hagen said that a few guided
tours may be offered during the
month.
