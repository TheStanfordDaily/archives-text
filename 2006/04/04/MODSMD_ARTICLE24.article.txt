# New walking tour gives glimpse into Stanford's history

A new walking tour showcases the signif
icance of earthquakes to the history of the
University. As the centennial of the 1906 San
Francisco trembler approaches, planners say
they hope the self-guided tour shows how al
most every part of campus has been touched
in some way by an earthquake.
"Stanford's history is strongly linked to
the 1906 earthquake," said Racquel Hagen,
an administrator in the Civil and Environ
mental Engineering (CEE) Department and
an organizer of the University's Quake '06
Centennial Alliance, the group sponsoring
the walking tour.

"The walking tour's purpose is to not only
give a glimpse into the history of Stanford,
but to also understand how that history
shaped the University, and to give a sense of
how far Stanford has progressed," she added.
"The more I researched, the more 1 real
ized how integral earthquakes are to Stan
ford's identity," said senior Laura Surma, one
of the tour's leading organizers.
She developed a passion for the project
during an internship with CEE Prof. Greg
Deierlein in the summer of 2004. The project
allowed her to combine her interest in histo
ry and architecture in a practical way.
She characterized the 7.1-magnitude
Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989 as one of her
strongest childhood memories. She remem
bers being in the bathroom at a friend's
house when the shaking began, sparking an
interest that eventually led her to help with
the Quake Alliance.

"Since I was too young to fully compre
hend the danger of earthquakes, the experi
ence was somewhat exhilarating and mar
velous because it was so dramatic and so un
expected," she said. "Although I am not an
earthquake engineer or geologist like many
of the faculty members on the committee, 1
grew up in the Bay Area and feel that earth
quakes and earthquake history are very rele
vant to my life and will continue to be rele
vant."
She used a research grant from the CEE
department last summer to work with archi
tects, archivists and engineers to select sites,
complete research and draft the text of the
signs.
Each of the 11 posters on the walk ad
dresses a key theme, including earthquake
impacts on prestige, the evolution of earth-
