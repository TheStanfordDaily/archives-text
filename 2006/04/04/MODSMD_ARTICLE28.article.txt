# 750 PUB QUESTIONS ALCOHOL SERVICE

### CLAY BAVINGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Management of The 750, Stanford's
popular on-campus pub, has been asking
students to sign a petition to support the
continued serving of alcohol.
"We're really just trying to see what the
students want," said Josh Stern, manager
and co-owner of The 750.
The petition was not started in response
to pressure from the University or any
other authority to stop serving alcohol,
rather it is "a personal gauge for us," Stern
said. "We want to know that we are sup

and we want to let the students know that
we appreciate them and want to serve them
as best as possible."

support the establishment's sale of alcohol.
"1 think it's nice to have a place on cam
pus where older students can hang out and
drink," said junior Kate Checchi.

pressed opposition to The 750's provision
of alcohol.
"I've been in The 750 a couple of times
and would enjoy it more and like the atmos
phere more if there wasn't any alcohol,"
said one student who wished to remain
anonymous.
But most, including those students who
choose not to drink, said they like the on
campus bar's ambience and the availability
of alcohol.
"I have no problem with The 750 serving
alcohol," said freshman Grant Escue. "as
long as they are responsible about serving it
and the students are responsible about
drinking it."
Management does not want to see the
pub become another sandwich shop. Stern
said.
"The University is fine with us serving
alcohol now," he said. "But the committees
