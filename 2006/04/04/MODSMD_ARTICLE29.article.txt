# STUDENT GOVERNMENT
## ASSU plans for spring elections 
### MICHAEL TAMKIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Undergraduate Senate met last night to debate a
proposal to place ASSU constitutional amendments on
the ballot for the upcoming spring election. The Senate
also approved funding for student groups and consid
ered how to best collect student input on priorities for
future ASSU leaders.
The meeting opened with comments from ASSU
President Melanie Kannokada, a senior, concerning the
Executive Cabinet's priorities for spring quarter and its
efforts to leave a legacy of "advocacy, professionalism
and diligence."
"We're going to be hosting an event involving a few
of the row houses the last week of spring quarter and
we're also finishing up the details on a car-share trans
portation program," Kannokada said. "There was a
need among the student body to coordinate rides
to the airport and we've been working with a de
veloper to create a site for students to coordinate
rides to the airport around the holidays."
She added that the Executive Cabinet is also
planning a benefit for Hurricane Katrina victims,
working with the Graduate Student Council
(GSC) to encourage diversity in the graduate stu
dent population. Vice President Aneto Okonkwo,
a senior, is leading a campaign to increase general
fee funding for student groups.
Kannokada ended by addressing how her cabi
net would ease the transfer of power to the new
president and vice president.
"We're establishing a document of best prac
tices, in terms of if you could start the year over
what would you do," Kannokada said. "With the
executive slate we'll be having modules about net
working with the administration,ensuring institu
tional memory, and clarifying objectives and plat
forms."
"Aneto and 1 will also be physically still work
ing spring quarter to allow the new slate to seam
lessly transition. We've put so much time into this
organization that we want to ensure they have the
opportunity to do the best job possible," Kannoka
da added.
Afterward, ASSIJ Financial Manager Justin
Fishner-Wolfson briefly notified the Senate that
the special-fee refund request process for spring
quarter is now open with an April 21 deadline.
Hie Senate then turned its attention to upcom
ing April 12 and 13 Election.
First on the docket was an advisory referendum
on student priorities, for which students would
rank their preferred goals for next year's student

government.
Senate Chair Chris Nguyen, a junior, said that
"since there's no easy way to poll the student body,
we could put it on the ballot as an advisory refer
endum."
I lowever. the Senate decided to postpone the
bill pending modifications to the design and con
tent of the survey.
'Hie undergraduate legislative body then dis
cussed a large bill embodying amendments to the
ASSIJ Constitution. It was introduced by the
Senate Deputy Chair Danny Arbeiter, a sopho
more.
"The first changes involve updates to bring the
document in the 21st century, such as reducing
hours of notice and taking into account new fac
tors such as email." Arbeiter said. "Second, we
want more flexibility, for example changing the
number of people on committees and allowing the
possibility of co-chairs."
Arbeiter then discussed several aspects of the
bill involving changes to the special-fee system
and the refund process.
"The first change would be so that joint special
fee requests would have to pass both the under
graduate and the graduate population individual
ly,[rather than simply receiving a majority over
all]" Arbeiter explained. "Right now undergrads
vote in higher numbers so they can overrun the
grad. vote, and there's less incentive for groups to
campaign to the graduate population."
While this proposal would apply to the seven
joint special-fee groups, Arbeiter argued that "this
change would make the system more representa
tive."
1 le also described a revision that would prevent

students who were able to vote, but did not, in the
previous year's election from receiving a special
fees refund. This restriction would only be imple
mented subject to the discretion of the ASSU fi
nancial manager.
Several members of the Senate expressed
reservations about the proposal.
"1 think voting should be anonymous and you
shouldn't punish people for not voting hy denying
them the ability to get refunds," senior Andrew
Hendel, chair of the Campus Advocacy Commit
tee, said.
('hair of the Senate Appropriations Committee
Paris Mohiuddin, a junior,suggested that "if every
one has to vote to get a refund, it would politicize
the election process so groups might campaign ac
tively against each other."
Due to concerns about these and other as
pects of proposed changes, the constitutional
amendment was not placed on this year's ballot
after several close votes. 1 lowever. several mem
bers of the Senate were optimistic that the work
done on the Constitution would be carried over
to next year.
"A lot of man hours have been put into this and
changes to the Constitution have been brought up
for several years and this is the farthest it's ever
come," Arbeiter said. "1 think with some minor
tweaking it has a very good chance of coming to
fruition next year, and although there were a lot of
compelling reasons for going ahead with the
changes this year, 1 hope they will still exist next
year."
'I lie Senate also approved a budget modifica
tion bill for Stanford Capoeira and a reserve trans
fer bill for Stanford in Government.
