## All Learn program shuts down 
### DENISE SOHN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If you thought all Stanford students were in
their teens or 2()s, think again.
Thanks to the Alliance for Lifelong Learning,
several hundred members of the public have
been able to take noncredit courses through
Stanford, Oxford and Yale over the last six years.
But due to recent financial complications, the
venture has been discontinued.
The Alliance for Lifelong Learning (All-
Learn) was a "nonprofit venture by Oxford.

Stanford and Yale to provide online noncredit
courses to the public," according to a recent arti
cle in The Chronicle for Higher Education.
All Learn was described as an "online learn
ing consortium" by Associate Provost for Con
tinuing Studies Charles Junkerman.
"The intention was to offer online courses
principally in the liberal arts for the extended
communities of the three universities," Junker
man said,adding that participants included most
ly alumni, but also current staff and faculty as
well as parents of current students.
Junkerman stressed that the
courses were for "personal enrich
ment and intellectual stimulation, not
for skill acquisition or professional
development."
AllLearn's central office in New
York worked to recruit faculty and
develop courses. Junkerman ex
plained that the courses were often
"very stimulating and exciting" and
emphasized the diversity of the par
ticipants— including students from
more than four different continents,
entirely different time zones and very
different walks of life.
Creative writing courses were par
ticularly popular. Junkerman ex
plained that the online structure of Al
lLearn's courses worked especially
well for these classes, which were finan
cially sustainable and quickly filled.
Many of these creative writing
classes were taught by English Prof.
Emerita Nancy Packer, who said she
enjoyed her experiences with All-
Learn.
"In a single course, I had students
from Indonesia. England. Germany
and even Palo Alto," she said. "Al

though I had some quite good writers,
I had some who were not native Hng
lish speakers and some who had
never tried to write fiction before, but
all were cheerful and eager to learn."
Packer added that the online
venue yielded one unexpected bene
fit as well: "Having to negotiate the
Web in various ways to communicate
with the students, I got over feeling
awkward."
Not all classes were so successful,
however. History Prof. David
Kennedy expressed frustration with
his AULearn classes, noting that the
"technologically quite deficient" chat
rooms were "an extremely poor sub
stitute for the live give-and-take of
classroom discussion, which they
were supposed to simulate."
With fellow History Prof. James
Sheehan. Kennedy twice taught an
AULearn course on World War 11. In
addition to online chat rooms,
Kennedy said that he and Sheehan
"used a number of videotaped lec
tures... assigned some reading, and re
lied on teaching assistants to corre
spond with students." The course also
included a film series for students
who lived locally, as well as live open
ing and closing lectures.
Hie lengths of courses varied
greatly. Some were as short as five to
six weeks, and the very short courses
— such as a forum on Iraq — were

very well received. Hundreds partici
pated in the forum, according to
Junkerman.
The program ran into financial
troubles because the "courses needed
to be priced at a certain level,"
Junkerman said. "The general con
sensus is that students will pay for an
online course if it will contribute to
professional development or has
measurable benefits."
He added that online courses in
applied fields, such as engineering or
business, were generally much more
successful, while attempts at liberal
arts courses were typically not.
Junkerman compared All Learn to
thp Continuing Studies program of
fered through Stanford. While both
programs target the same audience
and focus principally on liberal arts.
Continuing Studies has enjoyed con
siderably more success. The Continu
ing Studies program offers 90 to 1(X)
courses per quarter, and involves
7,(XK) to S,(HH) students per year.
The difference, Junkerman said,
was that the Continuing Studies
courses were on campus and included
a social and community experience.
Though All Learn has closed, there
has been some discussion of continu
ing the creative writing courses in
some way. Such measures would be
welcomed by Packer, who said that
she would "like to teach in it again."
