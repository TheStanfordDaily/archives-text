# Part I in a three-part series: Examining Immigrant Health
## Deep-seated health issues plague migrant workers

The Central Valley stretches for 400 miles of
farmland and cattle ranges north to south
across California, from Redding to Bak
ersfield. It has no Disneyland; no Golden Gate

Bridge; no Napa Valley. Yet it holds ,
five-and-a-half million people, with
over 12 percent involved in agriculture.
Many members of the Stanford commu
nity returning to campus from spring i
break zipped over miles upon miles of J

Central Valley highway, past the

countless roadside
farms grow-

crapes, alfal-

fa and just about
any other fruit or veg-

_ _
etable imaginable.Though the marvels of modern
agriculture are on vibrant display, the workers
hunched over in the fields tending to the future
meals of millions are not so obvious.
Manual labor is primarily performed by mi
grant and seasonal farm workers. Senior Alex
Rivas,a sociology co-terminal student, is writing his
thesis on the occupational hazards of farm workers.
According to Rivas, most workers in California
come from rural areas in Mexico — 95 percent of
them are foreign born, 90 percent are Latino, and
about 40 percent are undocumented.
On the farms where they work, pesticides are
necessary to produce a sizable and quality har
vest. Accordingly, farm workers have no choice
but to spend hours in fields sprayed with chemi
cals. This leads to a seemingly unavoidable and
unhealthy situation.
According to the Federal Environmental Pro
tection Agency website, "Some, such as the
organophosphates and the carbamates, affect the
nervous system. Others may irritate the skin or
eyes. Some pesticides may be carcinogens, others
may affect the hormone or endocrine system in
the body."
These adverse health effects are even more
harmful for children who are still developing.
And according to senior Jessica Lora. who as a
child traveled as a migrant worker, the number of

plex reasons,

children affected tends to be understated.
"From my experience, following my parents to
work and seeing the numbers of children, like me,
I knew that the numbers, at least in Oregon, were

higher [than what was re
ported)," she said.
Lora. who is also com-

pleting her honors re
search in pesticide rates in
Salinas County, comments
on those just some of the
difficulties migrant work-

ers face accessing
health care.

ber of com
l plex and

to report that you feel sick," Lora
pointed out. "You might believe that
you could get fired for being 'lazy' or even de

ported, which is worse."
She also noted that — from her experience
conducting research with migrant workers —
that this population has proven exceptionally dif-

Pesticide-related problems hard to solve
in a community at the edge of society

ficult to study. Not only are migrant workers
afraid of speaking freely because of firing or de
portation, they often do not understand the con
cept of doctor-patient confidentiality.
"Given these observations. I can confidently
say that pesticide toxicity levels are likely under
reported," Lora said.
Federal and state governments have respond
ed to these risks by trying to protect workers
through a number of laws and regulations. Rivas
has been investigating these efforts.
"Studies have shown that when you have the
correct equipment and training, the health and
safety risks can be drastically reduced." he said.
"However, it's hard to get people to do this."
The Federal Occupational Health Safety Act
of 1970 requires all employers provide a work
environment safe from hazards, mandating
things like potable water, handwashing and toi
let facilities within a five minute walk from
working areas. But this only applies to farms em
ploying more than 10 workers, a group compris
ing only 14 percent of the total migrant worker
population.
. However, California state laws and regula
tions tend to be stricter than the federal

ones, and their provisions extend to all
farms.

In theory, the Environmental
Protection Agency requires em
k ployers to train employees how to
use pesticides properly.

rßut according to Rivas, this is
easier said than done — the prob
lem cannot be fixed through mere
I legislation or regulations. Rules, he
' says, have little enforcement and
oversight due to migrant workers'

r lack of educational or monetary resources.
Training programs are near-impossible to im-

[ plement because the population of interest is mi
' gratory and not well-educated.
"Education is a big part," Rivas said. "Spread
ing the word among farm workers about their
safety and rights would be the easiest and most
effective way to help the situation. Go into the
community and try to spread information."
