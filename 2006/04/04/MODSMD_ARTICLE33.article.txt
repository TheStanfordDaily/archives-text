## Editorial Students want flexible, healthier dining options 
### 
With its vegan cheese and lactose
free milk alternatives, Stanford
Dining already makes great ef
forts to cater to a set of diverse student
tastes and needs. However, the current din
ing system unintentionally supports un
healthy eating habits. Stanford Dining
needs to do more to promote healthier eat
ing among students.
Most nutritionists agree that it is healthi
er to eat five small meals rather than three
large meals every day. However, because
dining halls are closed between meals, stu
dents feel the need to eat enough to last
them until the next meal. Hie pressure to
overeat also results in food wastage, since
students feel that they need to pile enough
food on their plates to last them until the
next meal.only to realize that their appetites
were smaller than they thought.
In particular, weekends constitute the
greatest threat to healthy eating patterns, be
cause dining halls only provide two meals on
weekends, brunch and dinner. Some stu
dents will eat even more during weekend
brunches than on regular weekday lunches,
because brunch often has to last over six
hours until the next meal.
On top of presenting a health issue, the
weekend two-meal policy imposes a particu
lar rhythm on students' lives, which may not
correspond to everyone's preferred lifestyle.
The fact that brunch starts at 10 at the earli
est provides incentives to stay up late the
night before and sleep in on weekend morn
ings. Students who prefer to get an early start
on weekends find themselves having to work
on an empty stomach.
Granted, there isn't sufficient student de
mand to justify paying the staff the necessary
amount to open the dining halls earlier.
However, we suggest that one or two dining
halls on campus open half an hour earlier for
brunch and gauge student interest. It is plau
sible that some students will modify their
sleeping schedules in response to this
change.
Although dining halls cannot be open 24
hours a day, they could have an open kitchen

with a limited selection of basic items such as
cereal, milk, fruits, and drinks available
throughout the day and after dinner. This
has already been proven feasible in Ricker
Dining's study hall, which opens at 9 p.m.
and provides a selection of snacks and drinks
during finals week. Given its success, this
policy should be extended to the rest of the
quarter and adopted by more dining halls.
If Stanford Dining cannot meet all the di
verse needs that students have, then they
should let other on-campus eateries and
cafes fill in the gap. In recent years, Stanford
Dining has expanded the number of dining
options available on campus through the
point system and should be commended for
it. But the University should greatly in
crease the flexibility with which students
can use Cardinal Dollars at a variety of din
ing locations. Moreover, there should be
healthy options available in most places
where points can be used. For example. Late
Nite at Stern and Lakeside are better
known for their pizza and chicken wings
than for their yogurt and fruit.That is fine, as
long as they provide a reasonable selection
of healthy options.
Although there is a great variety of
available meal plans, some students resent
being forced to purchase a meal plan, be
cause even the smallest meal plan of ten
meals is wasteful for them. Some people
can't get back to their dorm for lunch, don't
eat breakfast and aren't on campus for part
of the weekend. They rarely eat ten meals a
week but have to pay for them anyway.
Usually they are upperclassmen and feel
like the university is "babying" them by
telling them how to organize their meals. In
some cases, if they plan on eating out, they
may end up stopping by the dining hall any
way to get their money's worth by consum
ing two meals.
Stanford Dining already does a good job
offering many high-quality options in its din
ing halls. Future efforts to improve the qual
ity of students' dining experience should
concentrate on increasing the flexibility of
meal plans and dining hall schedules.
