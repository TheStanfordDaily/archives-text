# A 						proud member of the devoted cult of Apple

### 
Ijust made the big switch: PC to Mac. My
Sony laptop has been sickly for months,
so I finally made a few simple clicks with
my half-broken mouse and found myself the
proud owner of a new ißook.
I've never met a PC-user who was partic
ularly fervent about their chosen computer,
but nearly every Mac user 1 know is fervent
about his or her love of Apple. And within
just a day of owning my new computer, I sup
pose I see why. The usual blather about us
ability actually proves true. And of course,
it's just prettier.
But I've always thought that some of the
appeal of being part of the enthusiastic mi
nority of Mac users was in being a member
of the group itself. Like being a part of a sort
of exclusive club, owning a Mac makes you
different. You're not part of the ambivalent
majority of PC-people; you know a secret.
You have an intrinsic bond with everyone
else who is different and special like you. and
together you can take on the world. It's like
some little group of rebels challenging a far
greater power. Ilieir numbers may be inferi
or. but their commitment to the cause bands
them together. Or something like that.
But at what point does the "secret club"
lose its exclusivity? Ihe group of Apple-users
has grown — with the success of the iPod,
nearly everyone owns at least one Apple
product. Of course, Apple has been a main
stay in consumer electronics for years and it
was certainly never unknown, but the übiqui
tous iPod seems to have made it at least more
prominent. So if the superiority of Apple be
comes common knowledge, does member
ship in the Mac Club become less valuable?
It's the same sort of phenomenon as
when that cool indie rock band becomes
mainstream. Sure, the music may be just as
good, but once groups like Death Cab for
Cutie appear on "'lTie 0.C." and sign with a
major label, they may lose their appeal for

some longtime fans.
My friend Mike has been listening to
Death Cab for years, but when I asked what
he thought of the group now that it's so
mainstream, he said that although the music
hasn't changed, he wouldn't want to attend
one of their concerts anymore because "it
would be a mob of 12-year-old girls."
Sure, you can be happy when your fa
vorite group becomes popular, or similarly,
when the success of Mac skyrockets. But I
think there's a little part of every fan that re
sents the loss of exclusivity. You can try to re
tain some superior status by reminding
newer fans of how you've been there since
the beginning. But really, everyone ends up
in the same place — the fact that you've
been a loyal fan since last millennium does
n't necessarily make your current experi
ence any richer than mine.
So now I'm a proud Mac owner and
member of the devoted cult of Apple. Steve
Jobs may be happy to have won another con
vert, but I know there are supporters who re
sent when their best-kept secret gets out. Oh
well. We're all in this together now, whether
you like it or not.
But don't think 1 won't enjoy the same
right to be exclusive. After all, even if the se
cret club expands, membership has to retain
its perks.
