# Just hoping no bad people come

### JOEL STEIN DAILY ALUMNUS 
So from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m., my friend Ben
and I called every man, woman and child
we knew in the Bay Area, and left messages
on their answering machines.Then we went
to the Liquor Barn to purchase a keg.
Now, kegs, we were soon to discover, do
not come in traditional flavors like vanilla,
chocolate or raw cookie dough. No, they
come in flavors like Bud, Coors, Miller and
$35 special. We were told we did not want
the $35 special. We did not argue, it being
that the man was holding a 200-ton metal
canister which he coolly referred to as "a
half" of something.
"You guys gonna have girls there?"
"There most likely will be some women
attending," I responded, remembering the
well-placed phone call to my freshman ad
viser.
" Then you better get light beer. Guys
will hate it, but girls will drink it, and that
will keep the guys there."
His syllogism paused me, but I some
how sensed that my manhood was being
questioned. So I cleared my throat and
shoved my hand deeply — yet firmly —
into the back of my pants.
"Not the kind of dames we're inviting."
He didn't understand either, but it did
n't matter. Men were good, beer was good
and a half of some unknown quantity is
plenty. We all had a good laugh and he
took $158 from my wallet. He said he'd
give some of it back as long as we brought
back the tap. I told him we hadn't seen a
goon one since " The Cotton Club,"and
even that wasn't worth $158. He slapped
me on the back, laughed and threatened to

Only two types of people threw par
ties in high school. Those whose
parents didn't care and those who
wanted to be cool so badly they let people
carry out pieces of their parent's furniture.
1 never wanted to find out which one I was.
Besides, there was no reason to exploit
my own parents when there were other
equally cruel and unreasonable parents to
exploit. As a wise cannibal once said,"Why
eat your own arm, when this perfectly
good boys' soccer team just crashed into
the side of a mountain?"
Even at college I knew better. Throwing
a party was just a cheap ploy to gain
friends, impress women and run your own
little power trip.
But, I had been taking that free ride on
other peoples' fraternity dues for too long.
1 had responsibilities to own up to. "This
will be okay," 1 thought at Ip.m. last Friday
afternoon, with visions of "coolness" al
ready dancing in my head. "This is college.
All the furniture is University-owned."
It would be fine. I was a senior. I'd invite a
few friends over and we'd have a few beers,
play Pictionary and watch a movie. Probably
a foreign movie. Probably two friends.
That's not what I wanted. Ever since
high school there was this tiny, illogical,
Dan Quayle-side of me that screamed, in
my best, squeaky, 1977-state-school fresh
man voice,"Kegger!" And like most things
that don't concern women, I could quell
this urge only by acting on it.

take more money.
Feeling good about ourselves and our
genitals, Ben and I headed back home,
where we dragged the heaviest beverage
we ever encountered up a flight of stairs.
Then we circled it, stabbed it with the tap.
yelling "Kill the pig, spill the blood," and
letting the musty smell of hops fill the air.
This was our night. Women in inappropri
ate clothing were going to appear from my
closet and Ben and I were going to give
each other hi-fives.
Instead, a couple of friends came.
And they talked, and they played music
and they examined each other's garter
belts — well, one woman's garter belts, but
that's enough isn't it?
Then they left, and I cleaned up and
tried to lift what now felt like about four
fifths of Plato's ideal form of a keg. And I
had that sad. relieved feeling your mom
used to get when all the relatives left after
Thanksgiving weekend.
And 1 was happy. Because next year, 1
won't be able to surround myself with peo
ple I like whenever I want. Not even with
free beer. Not unless I can dig up those
muppet action figures from my closet at
home. And it's too damn hard to get those
garter belts up Miss Piggy's legs.
"Once, if my memory serves me well,
my life was a banquet where every heart
revealed itself, where every wine flowed."
I felt like Wayne Campbell.
