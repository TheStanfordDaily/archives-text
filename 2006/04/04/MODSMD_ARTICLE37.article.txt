## WOMEN'S TENNIS REMAINS UNDEFEATED PERFECTION PRESERVED 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's tennis team almost
saw its perfect season ruined by No. 8 Pepper
dine last Wednesday, but the squad managed
to pull out a tight 4-3 win as junior Anne
Yelsey emerged victorious in the third set of
the last singles match of the day.
The team had a much easier time in its
other two spring break matches, beating Cal
Poly 7-0 on March 26, and Oregon 6-1 on
March 31.
Against Pepperdine (16-3), the Cardinal
(18-0,5-0 Pac-10) jumped out to a formidable
lead. Stanford took the doubles point with
wins on courts one and two. Sophomore Celia
Durkin then blanked Pepperdine's Merve
Asimgil on the sixth court, 6-0, 6-0. Junior
Theresa Logar, ranked seventh by the ITA,
built Stanford's point lead to 3-0 with an easy
win at the No. 3 position, 6-2,6-2.
After that, however, the match went quick
ly downhill for the Cardinal. First, Eva Dickes
of Pepperdine beat sophomore Whitney Dea
son, 6-2,6-0 at the No. 5 spot. Seniors Amber
Liu and Alice Barnes, playing on courts one
and two, then dropped their matches, 3-6,5-7
and 6-7,3-6, respectively.
With the dual match score tied at 3-3, all
eyes were on junior Anne Yelsey, who was in
her third set after losing the first, 3-6, and win
ning the second. 6-3, against her opponent —
and friend — Natalie Braverman.
"I am good friends with Natalie, and I know
how well she can play," Yelsey said."l went out
there expecting it to be a very tough match all
the way through the line-up. When I figured
out that our team match was going to come
down to my match, I just smiled and thought,
'Well this should be fun.' I tried not to think
about the streak or the undefeated season — I
just didn't want to let my teammates down."
Braverman battled from behind in the
third set to tie things up at four games apiece.
Passionately cheered on by her coaches and
teammates, however, Yelsey took the next two
games to earn the match and clinch the win for
Stanford.
"Pepperdine had quite the crowd and a
huge cheering section, but on the court, 1 no
ticed my teammates and coaches were cheer
ing louder than all of the home-court fans
combined," Yelsey said. "Our team was ex
tremely loud, and 1 think the main reason I
was able to pull out that match was because I
knew my teammates were behind me, and that
they hadn't given up on the situation even
when it was 4-4 in the third set."
And while the match was unnerving for the
squad, the team also saw it as a valuable expe
rience.
"Pepperdine was a very scary experience,
one that I was not expecting," Logar said.
"They came out ready to play and almost
served us our first loss in a long time. We know
now that we cannot expect opponents to lie
down in our midst just because we're Stanford
— but in fact the opposite. It brought our fight
back."
Head coach Lele Forood said that academ
ics had been the team's primary concern in the
week prior to the Pepperdine match, so the
Cardinal's focus and training was not where it
should have been when facing such a strong
team.
"We were underprepared coming off of fi
nals," she said. "Pepperdine was absolutely as
good as advertised, if not better, so we were
very happy to come out with a W. Anne played
very well when it was all up to her."
Forood agreed that the match had a posi
tive element to it.

Spring break, although lacking in sun
and hunky men, was exciting.

THERESA LOGAR, junior

"Close matches are always good in terms of
preparing mentally for tough matches in the
post season," she said.
Fortunately for the team, its other two
matches last week went smoothly. Against
unranked Cal Poly (11-6, 5-0 Big West), the
Cardinal played an almost flawless match,
winning on all doubles and all singles courts.
The win marked the team's 13th shutout of
the season.

Against unranked Oregon, the Cardinal
swept doubles, though they struggled on court
two. Due to a minor neck injury, Barnes was
unable to compete in the match. Logar, who
has not played doubles lately, stepped in as
Yelseys partner. Playing at the No. 2 position
rather than the No. 1 position she is accus
tomed to this season, Yelsey showed the same
determination she displayed in singles against
Pepperdine, and together she and Logar eked

out a win in the tiebreaker.
"I knew that Anne would have to come
through when, in the first game of the match, I
sailed a sitter volley into the back fence,"
Logar said of her out-of-practice doubles
game. "I was definitely rusty, but we were able
to pull it off, which sent a message to our op
ponents and teammates that no matter what
happens, we can adjust and succeed."
With an altered lineup, Stanford won its
singles matches on courts two through six.
Logar moved up one to the No. 2 spot, Deason
and Durkin jumped up two positions each to
play on courts three and four, while sopho
more Lejla Hodzic joined the singles lineup at
No. 5 and freshman Jessica Nguyen joined in
at No. 6.
On the first court, however, the Ducks'
50th-ranked Dominika Dieskova upset 15th
ranked Liu to notch Oregon its sole point of
the match.
Despite the scares and struggles of the
week, the team reflected positively on its
spring break success.
"I think this spring break, although severe
ly lacking in sun and hunky men, was exciting
and a great learning experience for us," Logar
said.
Stanford next faces No. 10 UCLA at 1:30
p.m. on Friday and No. 4 Southern California
at noon on Saturday. Both matches will be
played at home in the Taube Tennis Center.
Tiebreaker: Due to space constraints, "Through
My Eyes," the Daily's weekly personal look at
the women's tennis team will not run this
week. It will return as normal next week.
