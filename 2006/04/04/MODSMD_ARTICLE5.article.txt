# Library space disputed
## New efforts follow law students' complaints of undergrad invasion 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"Dear undergrads, I miss the
night club atmosphere that your at
tire and boots brought to the law li
brary during finals. Love, Your
Neighborhood IL."
Motivated by Facebook.com ads
such as this one, undergraduates
held "Fetch Law Library Night" on
March 21 and started a Facebook
group — which currently has 20
members and 75 groupies — to pro
mote Stanford Law School (SLS)
students dressing more "fetch" like
the character Elle Woods from
"Legally Blonde."
This humorous reference to law
students' fashion sense came partial
ly in response to law student email
exchanges discussing concerns
about undergraduates overrunning
SLS's Robert Crown Law Library
during Dead Week and finals week.
The discussion leaked to the under
graduate community, focusing on
the shortage of work space due to
the high number of undergraduates
using laptop plugs and desk space.
In response to law student con
cerns raised in December and
echoed recently. Law Dean Larry
Kramer — working with recom
mendations from students, staff and
faculty — made four decisions. First,
Crown Library will not be available
to non-law students during SLS's
reading weeks and exam periods,
when space constraints are the
greatest. Second, tighter enforce
ment of rules forbidding cell phone
use and disruptive noise in Crown
Library will begin immediately.
Third, new student carrels will be
added. Fourth, SLS will look into
renovating the library's second floor
to create more study space.
"The Law School and law stu
dents benefit from University re
sources in myriad ways, just as stu
dents from other parts of the Uni
versity can benefit from the Law
School," Kramer said. "We're one
University and we share resources,
including the resources of all 19 of
Stanford's libraries.The Law School
only asks that people observe our
rules about noise, food, cell phones
and the like."
According to Kramer, under
graduates frequently use Crown Li
brary because of recent renovations.
"TTie Crown Library renovation
was so successful that it has made
our library an attractive place to
study," Kramer said. "We are look
ing at ways to create more space. It's
a problem, but so much better than
the former problem of having a
space that no one wanted to work
in."
Library Director J. Paul Lomio
said he welcomes all Stanford stu
dents, faculty and staff to use the
Crown.
"Other SLS librarians and I real
ly enjoy working with undergradu

ates when they come here with refer
ence questions, and my job would be
a lot less fun if I couldn't help them,"
Lomio said. "SLS needs to share re
sources with other campus libraries,
and we really need them to share
their resources with us. In terms of
book and electronic resources, we
get much more than we give. Follow
ing the 1989 Loma Prieta earth
quake, an army of undergraduate
angels came to Crown Library and
worked side-by-side with library
staff and law students to put over
90,(XX) books back on the shelves."
Although he supports the use of
Crown Library by the entire Stan
ford community, first-year law stu
dent Elliot Reed acknowledged that
there were times during winter quar
ter exams when undergraduates
using the reading room left little
space for law students to work.
"Crown Library is the only li
brary with law books and trained
legal reference librarians and is by
far the most convenient place for law
students to study between classes,"
Reed said. "Undergraduates should
be blocked from the Crown reading
room during undergraduate exams

In light of recent complaints by Stanford Law students
about undergrads in the Robert Crown Law Library:

1 Crown Library won't be available to undergraduates
9 during the Law School reading weeks and exam periods.
2 Greater enforcement of rules banning cell phones and
£ noise disruption will be begin immediately.
3 New student carrels will be built.
4 The Law School will look into renovating the second floor
9 of Crown Library to create more study space.

because they have plenty of other
places to study, and their presence
during undergrad exams is prevent
ing law students from using the
space."
Lomio agreed that law students
need quiet space to study before fi
nals and to complete take-home ex
aminations. This spring there will be
restricted library access from Friday,
May 5 through Friday. May 19.
"The restrictions only apply to
studying in the law library and use of

its conference rooms and comput
ers," Lomio said. "Our print materi
als remain available for all Stanford
students, and the reference staff will
assist any Stanford student at any
time. Our entry control will be
switched so that only law school IDs
will be recognized: all others will
have to request an exception for
entry."
Many undergraduates said they
believe that all students should be al
lowed access to law school re
sources.
"1 think the policy of limiting the
SLS library to law students during
law exams week is fine," said junior
David Gobaud, who created the
Facebook.com ads for "Fetch Law
Library Night." "Other times it
should be open to every Stanford
student."
Sophomore and ASSU Under
graduate Senate Deputy Chair
Danny Arbeiter expressed concern
that limiting the use of Crown Li
brary would discourage "mutually
beneficial interdisciplinary interac
tion.
"All schools can benefit from the
existence of each other, and I am
glad that undergraduates,graduates,
post-docs and professional school
students can all access the resources
and facilities of their own and other
schools," he added.
Arbeiter said he spoke to many
students at "Fetch Law Library
Night" and drew the conclusion that
among law students, the issue of un
dergraduates using Crown Library is
"rather exaggerated."
" l"he fact that the event focused
on how the different populations
dress shows that there is no merit to
the whole issue, and this is what the
undergrads were trying to call atten
tion to," Arbeiter continued. "Al
though at face value this seems just
to be an issue of law/undergrad rela
tions. 1 think this real issue is the lack
of common space on campus. Efforts
to create more premium study space,
or more specifically,study space with
adjustable Aeron chairs and carrels
like those available at Crown Li
brary, closer to the row houses and
west campus housing, would be ap
preciated by law students and un
dergrads alike."


JAMES CHAN/The Stanford Daily
Law students have complained recently about undergraduates' use of the
Crown Law Library, especially during exam periods. The Law School is cur
rently looking for ways to maximize space and serve both communities.
