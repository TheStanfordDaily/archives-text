## Pentagon listens in on anti-war groups ACLU launches lawsuit to recover group information 
### KATHERINE COX STAFF WRITER 
The American Civil Liberties Union
of Northern California filed a lawsuit on
March 7 demanding the immediate re
lease of information from the Pentagon
regarding members of anti-war student
groups at UC-Santa Cruz and Berkeley.
Santa Cruz's student group. Students
Against War. has been a vocal opponent

of the Iraq war since it began in 2003.The
group, which boasts the largest member
ship of all similar groups at West Coast
universities, has sponsored several rallies
and peace marches. But it was the group's
anti-recruiting efforts that set them apart
and may have prompted the Pentagon
surveillance.
On April 5 of last year, members of
Students Against War intervened be
tween military recruiting officials and ca
reer fair attendees on campus. A demon
stration nearby left one staff member
with a superficial injury. The protesters
turned out for another career fair in Oc

tober to challenge the military's presence
on a "non-discriminating" campus. Sever
al students performed a queer "kiss-in" in
front of the officers, condemning the mil
itary's "Don't Ask Don't Tell" policy.
In December 2(K)5. members of Stu
dents Against War and Berkeley's Stop
the War Coalition learned via MSNBC
that their activities had been monitored
by the Pentagon. Undisclosed informa
tion about the student activists had been
entered into a Pentagon database along
side terrorists' records.The Pentagon ear
marked the Santa Cruz student group
as a "credible threat," a label the Stu
dents Against War has now adopted
to satirize the agency's alarm.
On Feb. 1, the ACLU and The San
Francisco Bay Guardian submitted a
request under the Freedom of Infor
mation Act (FOI A) for the Pentagon
to declassify its files on the student
groups. The Department of Defense
refused to immediately release the in
formation. The ACLU sued the Pen
tagon on March 7 after this refusal be
cause it feared the government might
otherwise take up to two years to
process the release.
Stanford Law Prof. Jenny Mar
tinez explained that the FOI A allows
the public to request that the govern
ment disclose information and docu
ments from various departments.
"There are a variety of exemp
tions under the act, primarily the ex
emption of information that would
jeopardize national security," she
said. "The courts often dispute what
types of information can be re
leased."
Martinez added that the Fourth
Amendment provides the basic crite
ria for determining who or what is an
appropriate target for surveillance.
"If people are engaged in lawful
speech activities then the govern
ment cannot spy on them," she said.
"The government cannot practice
search and seizure, or surveillance un
less they have probable cause.
Students at UC-Santa Cruz and

the Berkeley campus have historical
ly been at the forefront of wartime
protests. Yet Stanford student groups
are notably absent from the Penta
gon's blacklist. In fact, there are no
explicitly "anti-war" student groups
registered with the Office of Student
Activities (OSA) at present. Junior
Nell Selander, president of the Stan
ford Democrats,attributes this dearth
to the administrative difficulties stu
dents face in forming and supporting
groups.
"Unfortunately, many student
groups on the Stanford campus are
overwhelmed by the process of sim
ply existing," Selander said. "In order
to be a student group you have to nav
igate the overly-complex OSA and
ASSU. and to gain funding you have
to prove your group serves the whole
campus community."
In Selander s opinion, the lack of
groups with anti-war agendas does
not necessarily reflect the political
sentiments or apathy of Stanford stu
dents.
"At times I wish Stanford stu
dents were more aware and politi
cally active, but in my two and a half
years at this school. I have come to
know and respect a great number of
politically aware and active individ
uals," she said. "I would not trade
these talented and ground-breaking
minds for a dozen other university
campuses. If you look carefully, you
are certain to find a vibrant, politi
cally aware student body here at
Stanford."
According to Nanci Howe, direc
tor of the OS A. a student group called
the Stanford Community for Peace
and Justice was registered with the
Office as recently as a year ago. But

the group was affiliated with an off
campus organization and did not
reapply this year. Howe said she was
n't aware of any student groups with
anti-war or pacifist objectives seeking
recognition this year.
She reiterated that, "the criteria
for recognition are not content
based. The main requirement is that
new groups don't duplicate an exist
ing group."
She recalled that in the past,
"when we had big protests at Stan
ford, they were sponsored by a num
ber of student groups together with
individual students."
On March 22. 2003, 2(X) Stanford
students and faculty gathered in
White Plaza to oppose the war. many
of whom later marched into Palo Alto
to join the community in protest.
On March 18, 2006. Santa Cruz's
Students Against War continued to
spread their message at a rally in San
Francisco protesting the nation's
third year of military engagement in
Iraq. Yet, anti-war demonstrations on
this third "anniversary" were seem
ingly nonexistent on the Stanford
campus. Selander was dubious about
the need for student participation in
these conventional outlets.
"Those who feel passionately
about the war in Iraq should have an
avenue through which to express
themselves," she said. "However, I do
not think that students should be re
quired to be demonstrative simply
because they are students. Students
today should not be held to their
predecessors' methods of protest.
Despite this, we [students] do owe it
to our society to be as informed as our
parents' generation, if only to avoid
conflict like this in the future."
