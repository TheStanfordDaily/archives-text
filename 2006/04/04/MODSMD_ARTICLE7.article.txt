## Even techie grads find taxes taxing The 						hardest thing in the world to understand is the income tax. 
### 
--ALBERT EINSTEIN

April fool's day has come and gone and
for the next two weeks all of us will be
come immersed in the mysterious and
inscrutable ritual of filing tax return forms. So
vastly captivating is the influence of this cere
mony that the chances of you getting a date for
the first weekend of April are bleaker than
during exam week.
Suddenly the entire United States starts
conversing in an arcane language of words like
1040, 1042NREZ, W2, W4, Cintax, Tbrbotax
etc. Tax attorneys become hot property; H&R
block becomes a favored hang-out; and drop
ping a piece of tax advice catches more atten
tion than the best of pick-up lines.
As a tax payer you enjoy a sense of owner
ship: You can drive your car as fast as you want
on the road you paid to build; you can call 911
for turning off the fire in your barbecue be
cause you paid for the fire department; and a
FBI inquiry is required to recover your lost
pencil because you pay for their salaries too.
Even familial relationships start changing.
Will getting married reduce my taxes? Will
having kids help? Can I donate money to my
sister's cute friend's school and discount that
from my income?
The Lying Quotient increases exponential
ly. Creativity (to avoid taxation) is at its peak.
It's like the whole U.S. is playing an elaborate
game of Chinese checkers: how to best trans
fer your income from the taxable triangle to
the tax-exempt triangle by hopping over the
tax loopholes.
And it's a fine game if you want to indulge
yourself. But.grad students are very busy indi
viduals. We can't get exemptions from home
work assignments to get our tax forms filed in
time nor is April 15 a national holiday. Our ad
visers do not consider "Well, you know for the
past week I've filing my taxes" an acceptable
excuse not presenting any research results in
group meetings. The 'Crime Scene Investiga
tion' still airs on TV and one still has to keep
oneself updated on March Madness and
Major League Baseball.
Unfortunately, unlike most busy individu
als grad students are very poor too. There is
barely an income to start with, and living in
one of the most expensive places in the world
sucks up most of it, like a cruel insulting joke
crafted for the amusement of bored tax clerks
at IRS.
Destitution doesn't save you from taxes—
deceit does. But unlike the rich, we don't even
have any avenues to explore. No income, no in
vestments. Unless I can claim depreciation of
my $69 Wal-mart bike and count paying dis
proportionate tips in state of drunken stupor
at pubs as philanthropy, there is hardly any
thing esoteric that I can do about my taxes.
So, why make us fill the forms at all? The
IRS knows what we get paid, what our tax
withholding is and which country we belong
to. Actually, that brings up another moot
point—why do international students pay
taxes in a country that was founded on the idea
of 'no taxation without representation'—but
that's another topic, another day.There proba
bly is a software program that collects this in
formation and sends 1040 or W2 forms. Why
not add simple tax filing software to it, and in
stead send us default filled tax return forms
stating what they think are the appropriate
values for all the blanks and what they think
we owe them or they owe us? If we agree with
them, then we do nothing, and if we don't
agree with them then we send them back the
changes we think are appropriate. It reduces
the work for everyone. For tax clerks at the
IRS who audit the tax forms, the problem has
changed from reviewing the whole tax form to
just reviewing the changes. It would save hun
dreds of thousands of students so much time,
which could be used in other, more productive
pursuits.
Of course, none of this will happen. I will
still have to rush to the post office in between
classes. But even philosophizing relieves some
of the pressure. I think that's what Albert Ein
stein meant when he said,"This [preparing my
tax return] is too difficult for a mathematician.
It takes a philosopher."
