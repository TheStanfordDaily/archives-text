# INTERNAL MEDICINE
## AN IN-DEPTH LOOK AT STANFORD'S RESEARCH FOCUS 
### WRITTEN BY WEENA PUN 
_ ll hen Stanford adopted Cooper Medical Col-
I lege in San Francisco as the Medical Depart-
I ment of Stanford University in 1908, the major
I role of the University's medical school was to
train physicians for general practice. In 1959,
when the School moved to new buildings and laboratories on the
Palo Alto campus, the changes went beyond location. The move
gave birth to a new kind of medical school.
Envisioned by Stanford's former president Wallace Sterling
and Provost Frederick E.Terman, the reinvented medical school
emphasized research, encompassing both clinical medicine and
the basic sciences.The school today holds a respected place in the
ranks of clinical education and scientific achievement.
The focus on research is what makes it attractive to many stu
dents. In 2003, a new curriculum was put into effect, which — ac
cording to the School's Web site — frees up time for scholarly
concentrations that permit students to pursue areas of interest.
Medical student Prasanna Ananth says she feels fortunate to

have been part of the first class
to benefit from the new cur
riculum.
"While this meant that we
were often the guinea pigs, we
had fewer class hours, far less
redundancy in our courses, and
a much more streamlined pre
clinical education," Ananth
says. "There is also a ton of
flexibility during the third and

fourth years to do away rotations, electives, etc."
Ananth was able to spend a week working at a Katrina relief
camp in Mississippi with her classmates, and another three weeks
in Guatemala with a group of renowned pediatricians.
"All of this was possible through the nied school," she says.
Under this new curriculum, the School aligned with the school
of Public Health at the UC-Berkeley allowing selected medical
students to complete a dual MD-MPH degree. Ananth, who is
currently doing rotations, says she is very appreciative of the
newly established joint MD-MPH program. She is one of the se
lected students who will be at Berkeley pursuing a public health
degree next year.
Ranking number one among U.S. medical schools in expendi
tures per faculty member conducting sponsored research, the
school is involved in more than 1,6(X) research projects under the
supervision of about S(H) distinguished faculties. One such re
search initiative Future Fertility of Pediatric Cancer Patients, was
designed and carried out by two medical students Tress Goodwin
and Li/ Oosterhuis. The project looked at knowledge and atti
tudes about the impact of cancer treatment on future fertility.The
first part of the study surveyed the pediatric oncology providers

"If we fail a test, we can retake it until we pass, so
there is less pressure. People still work hard, but
we have more leisure time than medical students
across the country."
PRASANNA ANANTH, medical student

(doctors and nurses), and a separate study of parents and cancer
patients (more than 14) receiving care. They later designed an in
formative brochure that is now handed out to every family in the
department and available on the web: www.lpch.org\pdf/fertility-
Oncßrochure.pdf. They are currently working on publishing two
papers in medical journals.
Another medical student. Ruby Wang — with her classmates
— is doing research on the SARS virus. The disease caused a
global panic three years ago but the way the virus causes disease
is still unknown."We think that perhaps SARS is an autoimmune
disease," says Wang. Currently they have been purifying the spike
protein of SARS (a possible target for vaccination). Next, she will
stain lung tissue with antibodies against the carbohydrate target
and to further implicate autoimmunity in SARS.
When asked about the role of the school in their research,
Goodwin and Oosterhuis both agree on the amazing faculty in
cluding their advisor Michaela Kiernan. "She has been nothing
short of incredible...very patient with us and guiding us through

the maze of IRB approval, re
search methodologies, statistics,
and more" Goodwin and Oost
erhuis agree.
The school's faculty in
cludes Nobel Prize winners
Arthur Kornberg, who synthe
sized DNA-like material in a
test tube, and Paul Berg, who
constructed the first molecule

containing parts of DNA from
different species. Alumni include Norman Shumway, the father
of the heart transplant.
Aside from the emphasis on research, the grading system ap
peals to prospective medical students. The school grades on a
pass-fail basis. Most students say the system is more like pass
pass.
Ananth says/if we fail a test, we can retake it until we pass, so
there is less pressure. People still work hard, but we have more
leisure time than medical students across the country."
Ananth believes that the small class size of 86 diverse students
is School's one of the greatest strengths. However, with the ac
ceptance rate hovering around 3 to 4 percent, Stanford is nearly
impossible to get in to.
The School attracts overachievers who tend not to have tasted
failure or mediocrity. Ananth would like to see a more accessible
support system to help students to address challenges without
losing perspective.
"It's a big adjustment to feel utterly clueless in the hospital, to
have a research project flop, to get a sub-par board score," she
says,"The school needs to have mentors and confidantes who
reach out to students."
