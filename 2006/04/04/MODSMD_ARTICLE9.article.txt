## Editorial Res Ed needs to recruit dynamic personalities 
### 
Stanford Residential Education is en
trusted with blending the academic
lives of students with their residential
needs, providing a place to live and to learn
within the larger and sometimes scary insti
tution. In fact, Res Ed's "essential convic
tion" is "that living and learning should be
integrated, not separate." This, in itself, is a
noble goal: informal learning is an integral
part of the undergraduate experience at
Stanford, even if it takes the form of philo
sophical debate at 3 a.m. over the merits of
Kantian moral critiques of Jack-in-the-Box.
But given the talented and interesting
collection of students sardine-canned in
Rinconada and Branner, it seems probable
that this sort of learning by osmosis would
happen naturally. So what is the real objec
tive of ResEd, the elevator abstract behind
all the rhetoric? More to the point: what
should it be?
The answer, in a word, lies with people.
With the tremendous assortment of Res Ed's
missionaries sprinkled liberally across all
Stanford dorms, you could be forgiven for
thinking that Stanford is running a daycare
instead of a college. Want to talk about your
problems? We offer three RAs, in case the
first two are occupied. Got an I HUM essay
that needs editing? We've got RWTs and
HPACs and even RCCs in case the wireless
network is down. Need greater certainty of
theme, culture or focus? No worries, there's
bound to be an ETA or an ATA or an FA or
a CAA around somewhere. Stanford has al
ways suffered from a glut of acronyms, but
nowhere more so than in the dorms.
Don't get us wrong: most residential
staffers carry out their duties admirably,
however nebulous those duties may be. Most
RAs are cool and most HPACs let you know
when to mark your calendar down for the
drop deadline. But as with anything at Stan
ford — from classes to dining halls to the
dorms themselves — there is a wide varia
tion in the quality of staff. Part of this is un
avoidable. But given the prominent role that
most staff play in defining the character of a
particular dorm, everything from its policies

to its atmosphere, we should pay greater at
tention to ways in which a better living envi
ronment for students can be achieved. That
is, after all. the mission of Res Ed.
The first and most general aim should be
greater consistency, especially among fresh
man dorms. Though ResEd obviously sub
jects potential staff to rigorous training ses
sions and outlines a set of guidelines that
should be followed, there are more crucial
dorm "attitudes" that can't be taught in a
seminar. Some RAs view themselves as rule
enforcers, while others as just "one of the
guys." Clearly, RAs need to act as discipli
narians in certain instances, but treating
freshmen like kindergartners is not the way
to establish a fun and supportive residential
experience.
Also, more thought should go into the
selection of Resident Fellows. When it
comes to quality of staff, the issue starts at
the top. RFs seem to take quite disparate
views in terms of their role in the dorm:
some make a serious effort to get to know
residents and are intimately involved with
the minutiae of dorm life; others are almost
invisible post move-in day. In our view, the
responsibility of RFs should be to place
themselves somewhere between those two
extremes, making an honest attempt to be
accessible but not interfering in the daily
lives of students.
When ResEd surveys potential RF appli
cants, the most central question should be
exactly that: "how do you see the role of RF
within the dorm experience?" Indepen
dence is a very important part of moving
away and going off to college; by the same
token, some students rely on the counsel of a
pseudo-parental figure in times of crisis.
Since RFs also determine much of the di
rection of dorm policies, the effects of a poor
RF can be wide-ranging, even if they are not
involved in the dorm on a daily basis. RFs in
terview potential house staff, and through a
natural process of mutual selection, the best
staff will pair off with the best applicants,
leaving some dorms with low-quality RFs
and subpar staff.
