Announcing Openings for
SOPHOMORE COLLEGE ASSISTANTS, ORAL COMMUNICATION TUTORS
AND RESIDENTIAL COMPUTER COORDINATORS
FOR THE 2006 SOPHOMORE COLLEGE
September 2 - September j|!§ JF S'"
Sophomore College is a set of programs for returning sophomores who live together in a student residence and work under faculty supervision in a series of small-group classes during early September, before the start
of fall quarter.
DATES: September 2, 2006 - Student staff must arrive back on campus between noon and 5:00 p.m. • September 2, 2006, evening - student staff training begins. • Staff duties will continue through September 22.
• September 4, 2006 -.Participating students must arrive back on campus between noon and 5:00 p.m. • College will remain in session through September 22.
• Sophomore College Assistants (SCAs): Each faculty member is assisted by two upper-class sophomore college assistants (SCAs). SCAs have a combination of three roles: academic advisor, residence staff, and
teaching assistant. They will live in residence with student participants, report to and collaborate with the faculty teaching the course, and collaborate and coordinate structured residential activities with the Assistant Directors. Any
student who will be a junior or senior in 2006-2007 and is in good academic standing is eligible to apply. (In some instances, one of the SCAs may be a graduate student.) Undergraduate SCAs will receive room, board, and a
stipend of $BOO ($1,175 for graduate SCAs) for full-time work during the course of the program, and for potential planning meetings with faculty at the end of this spring quarter. Note: Due to the fact that Honors College and the
training for RA, RCC, HPAC, and OV programs conflict with Sophomore College, if you are selected for both positions, you must choose between them. We will coordinate with the Peer Mentor Program and CTL Subject Tutor
Program, so these positions will not conflict.
• Residential Computer Coordinators (RCCs) and Oral Communication Thtors (OCTs):RCCs and OCTs will also live in residence and will receive room and board as part of their compensation. Only RCC appli
cants that have already completed RCC training can be considered. The stipend for RCCs will be in an amount of $750 and the OCTs will be paid an hourly wage commensurate with level of training
