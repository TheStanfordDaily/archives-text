## TIME not up with the climate change 
### Jen Graham 
Significant Figures

The debate on climate change is "over." At least,
so say the editors of Time magazine, which de
clared in its April 3,2006 issue that the earth is
now at the tipping point between sustainability and
disaster.
Never mind that the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) was created in 1988, almost
20 years ago, in response to the potential catastro
phe of global warming. Never mind that the vast ma
jority of the world's countries signed the Kyoto Pro
tocol almost a decade ago, in 1997. You can even ig
nore that in 2002 Exxon-Mobil, one of the world's
largest oil companies and thus an indirect contribu
tor to greenhouse gas emissions, pledged Stanford
$lOO million to conduct research on how to mitigate
global warming.
Only now does Time magazine say it, so only now
must it be so.
Be worried. Be very worried. And not just for the
reason Time gives on its cover, that "climate change
isn't some vague future problem it's already dam
aging the planet at an alarming pace." Be worried
that, in our society, scientists don't determine when a
phenomenon like global warming reaches a critical
juncture. Apparently the news media does and
sometimes with dubious facts.
For those who have been warning of the real dan
gers of climate change for years, seeing Time maga
zine dedicate nearly an entire issue to the topic like
ly induced euphoria. After all, it isn't often that a
magazine with about the tenth highest circulation in
the United States makes unequivocal claims like
"global warming is upon us with a vengeance"
and "from floods to fires, droughts to storms, the cli
mate is crashing."
There was no space for the lingering global warm
ing nay-sayers. No caveats that the science may re
main uncertain. Just 23 pages of photos and text on
what climate change has done, how it affects your
health and what can be done to mitigate it.
So after years of the news media's compulsion to
air both sides of the climate change controversy, why
such sudden hubris?
Time is not reporting on some grand conclave of
atmospheric scientists who have just realized that
global warming's threats are immediate. Nor is it
telling the story of converted climate change skep
tics who have recanted their criticism, thus ending
the "debate." In contrast, most in the scientific com
munity would argue that the "debate" on global
warming has been over for years. It just hasn't
seemed this way to laypeople because of the claims
of some vocal scientists and media outlets who have
framed the issue as a toss up.
If there is an ended debate that is actually news
worthy, perhaps it is the public debate. In its featured
article, Time reports the results of a poll conducted
with ABC News and Stanford showing that 85 per
cent of people think the world's temperature has
been increasing over the past 100 years, versus only
76 percent in 1997. It also shows that 80 percent of
people think this change is caused at least in part by
things people do. Still, less than half of those polled
considered global warming to be a serious problem
now. And, despite Time's claims, 64 percent of those
polled believed there to still be much debate over cli
mate change among scientists.
So, what's the big deal? According to Time re
porter Jeffrey Kluger, it's Cyclone Larry, Hurricane
Katrina, big forest fires and one scientist's claim that
"the ripple through the scientific community" over
the past 12 months' natural disasters "is palpable."
In part, Kluger is right the severity of the past
year's natural disasters have caused many scientists
to speculate about what role climate change may
have had in them. "Speculate" being the operative
phrase I don't think many scientists would argue
that "the climate is crashing, and global warming is
to blame" today if they didn't feel that way one or
two or five years ago. I think it is even less likely that
they would unequivocally state that Katrina specif
ically was definitely spawned by greenhouse gases
spinning the earth out-of-balance. Even long-time
believers in climate change are judicious in attribut
ing specific phenomena to global warming without
thorough research.
Climate change is happening, and it is a big deal,
and it is a topic where the media has generally under
served the public by failing to communicate the con
sensus among scientists: that global warming is a real
ity and there is a need for action to avert negative
consequences.
This failure makes it easy for Time to ask itself
questions like "Why did the crisis hit so soon?" It may
not seem so soon to those who have been testifying in
front of the IPCC since before some Stanford stu
dents were born.
So be worried —be very worried when the
media's coverage of scientific phenomena is not
based on the opinions and findings of scientists.
Be worried when it instead plasters alarmist cau
tions across newsstands, misrepresenting scientific
opinions.
And be very worried when Time magazine looks
to itself, not scientists, to determine how severe glob
al warming is and what risks it poses.
