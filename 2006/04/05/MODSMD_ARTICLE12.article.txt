# Pixel Advertising: Bright Start, Uncertain Future
## 
### SAM BHAGWAT DESK EDITOR 
When British student Alex
Tew had a late-night brainstorm
ing session for away to finance
his college education, he hardly
thought he would end up a mil
lionaire.
In August 2005 Tew uninten
tionally founded the industry of
pixel advertising when he put up
an image on his homepage
measuring one-thousand-by
one-thousand pixels, and by
word of mouth began selling
pixels in this image for one dol
lar each, minimum purchase 100
pixels. To Tew's surprise, he sold
his first pixel block after three
days, and after only two weeks
had enough money to pay his
first year's tuition.
A month had passed when his
quest was noted by prominent
British newspapers. He had sold

for $150,000 dollars worth of ad
vertisements. And in January, he
sold his last 1000 pixels on
e√üay for a cool $38,000.
Once people realized the nov
elty and ingenuity of Tew's idea,
copycats began to spring up, all
based on the same fundamental
idea: hosting permanent visual
advertisements, guaranteed for
five years or more, and selling
their graphic space by the pixel.
Some focused their sites on one
particular country; some had an
international target population.
Some sold their space for 10, five,
or even one cent per pixel; some
kept to $1 per pixel. Yet all stuck
to this basic idea, and many have
enjoyed success. A few sites other
than Tew's have even sold all or
most of their allotment of pixels.
Though pixel advertising's fu
ture may seem bright one new
site recently registered over
100,000 hits in their first three

days some question the indus
try's potential in the long-term.
Tew's Web site "spawned
dozens of copycat sites that will
undoubtedly do nowhere near as
well as Alex's," wrote Steve Bog
gan in the British newspaper The
Times. "The reason for that is
simple: the selling point of his
page is that it was the first."
But being the first can only
happen once. Sites such as
Wikipedia that have 'staying
power' in the fast-moving online
world, usually have content of in
terest generating continual traf
fic. Even search sites which en
able easy access to others' con
tent rather than providing their
own do so in a primarily informa
tional and non-commercial man
ner. Google, for example, places
search results front and center
and keeps its commercial, rev
enue-generating sponsored re
sults off to the side.

The primary content of pixel
advertising, in contrast, is com
mercial; there is no non-commer
cial Interest in the concept, as in
other social phenomena such as
the flash mob or clothing fads,
primarily derives from other
peoples' interest rather than
from any innate attraction. And
this, some argue, makes business
es based on it risky.
Pixel advertising "is being sold
largely on the bulk of its own
hype rather than its clear-cut sta
tistics for product sales," wrote
Daniel Harrison on Feb. 28 on
the Web site BlogCritics.org.
"[That's] typical boom-bust mar
ket behavior."
Harrison argues that it's also
reminiscent of the dot-com era.
In a trial of buying an advertise
ment on a pixel advertising site,
he noted that the result is "wor
rying for those hoping to trans
late advertising dollars to pock

eted dollars a large increase in
website hits, but no net change in
the variables that count."
How will all of this affect new
start-ups? The future, of course,
is unknown. Yet it seems fair to
say that time will tell whether
pixel advertising has long-term
viability and, if so, the multiple
new pixel advertising services
launching every day can set
themselves far enough apart
from their competitors to sur
vive. But there are positive signs.
The pixel advertising industry is
maturing, with better technology
and the development of more se
rious endeavors a Red Cross
pixel-advertising campaign to
raise funds for disaster victims,
for example.
"Once technological sophis
tication has caught up with the
conceptual pitch," Harrison
says, "[there will be] long-term
viability."
