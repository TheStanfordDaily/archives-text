Law Library should be open
to all students

I am writing to express my concern over
the recent decision to ban undergraduate
students from Crown Law Library during
the Law School's exam period. All students
must be able to access all library materials
regardless of the time of the quarter. Al
though the administration is taking purport
ed steps to integrate the Law School with the
rest of the University most notably with
the Law School's switch to the quarter sys
tem this decision would further separate
the two.
This action undermines the meaning of

Stanford as an intellectual community and
sets a chilling precedent. What would pre
vent any department from instituting a sim
ilar policy? Would it be possible for Green
Library to be only available to students in
the School of Humanities and Sciences?
Could a departmental library such as the
Art Library or the Music Library also close
its doors to non-majors? How would law
students feel if they were suddenly prevent
ed from entering other university libraries
without seeking special case-by-case per
mission?
The law library provides a valuable and
unique resource for all students and, while
undergraduates may be able to seek special

permission to use these resources, the re
strictions create an undue burden.
This decision also undermines Stanford's
claimed support for cross-disciplinary stud
ies specifically the ability of undergradu
ates to take classes offered by all depart
ments and schools and to access the re
sources required for such classes.
These restrictions will deprive undergrad
uates of Crown Library's thousands of
unique books and journals, which are impor
tant to the studies and intellectual growth of
both graduate and undergraduate students.
