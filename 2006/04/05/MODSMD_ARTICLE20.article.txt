Maybe it was the rejuvenating relief of
wrapping up a tough quarter of Hum√üio
coursework. Or perhaps it was the peace of
mind that only an all-expenses-paid trip to
Hawaii could give. Maybe it was a subcon
scious frustration about trailing a freshman
for the team scoring lead. Or perhaps it was
some mysterious set of superpowers she
came to possess for the 24 hours following
her 21st birthday celebration.
Whatever it was, junior Katie Hansen was
a one-woman offensive explosion in the Car
dinal's 12-6 victory over No. 5 Hawaii Rain
bow Wahine (11-8, 5-4 MPSF) on March 28.
On the final day of her team's three-night stay
in the Aloha State, the right-handed driver
tallied an incredible six goals to single-hand
edly match Hawaii's goal total for the game.
Hansen was hot from the opening sprint,
putting the No. 2 Cardinal (14-3, 7-1 MPSF)
up by two with a pair of goals in the first few
minutes of the game. And after netting two
more in the second period of play to help her
squad build an 8-3 lead going into the half,
Hansen put the finishing touches on her
dominant performance by recording two of

Stanford's four goals in the second half.
Freshman Lolo Silver whose 34 goals
rank just ahead of Hansen's 31 posted a
hat-trick, and junior goalie Meridith McColl
provided a typically solid performance in
cage with six saves.
But Hansen emphasized another experi
ence as the prime highlight of her team's time
in Hawaii the sunny beach barbeque on
her birthday that she, her coaches, her team
mates and their families enjoyed the day be
fore the team's showdown with the Wahine.
"The entire time we were in Hawaii it
rained," Hansen said. "But for two hours
Monday morning, the sun came out for our
barbeque and it was amazing. We finally got
to have a typical Waikiki kind of day vol
leyball games, the big water tractors you can
rent on the beach and plenty of sunburns.
Having the sun come out for those couple of
hours made our Hawaii trip complete."
The Cardinal returned to the mainland to
take on No. 6 California across the Bay in
Berkeley last Sunday. This time, though, the
Stanford offense featured a more balanced
scoring attack, but the result was still they
same as the Cardinal came away with the 8-4
win. Seven players found the back of the cage
for Stanford, with sophomore Jackie Gauthi
er capitalizing twice on scoring opportuni
ties.
It was a physical contest in which 13 ejec
tions were called, but the Cardinal defense
proved up to the challenge. The Bears were

unable to produce more than one goal in any
period of the game, and McColl once again
showed herself to be the backbone of the
Stanford backcourt with ten saves.

With the win, the Cardinal wrapped up a
perfect spring break that also featured a com
manding 12-3 win over No. 18 Princeton at
Avery Aquatic Center. Freshman driver
Koree Blyleven noted the individual per
formances of Hansen, McColl, Silver and
Gauthier as the keys to the squad's success
during this stretch.
"The key to each [of their] highlights was
patient execution of skills we learn in prac

tice," Blyleven said. "We play with not only
excitement and energy, but the confidence
that comes from knowing that we are work
ing harder and playing smarter than any
other team."
The Cardinal are now primed for the
stretch run of their 2006 campaign leading
into the MPSF conference tournament and
NCAA championships. Physically and men
tally rested, every member of the squad is
ready for the final push.
"There have been things we've been talk

ing about wanting to do all season,
and a lot of that is coming together,"
Hansen said. "More and more we're
understanding each other as players
who wants a pass where and
when, how to get the appropriate
people in the right positions at the
right times and how to help each

other get open or get the right
matchups. But, of course, we still
have a lot of room for improvement,
and we need to up our learning
curve."
Seasoned veteran junior Christi
na Hewko struck a similar cord in
her evaluation of where her team
stands.
"We are continually getting bet
ter and getting closer as a team,
which is great-," she said. "But to win
NCAAs, we are still going to have
to dig a little deeper."
