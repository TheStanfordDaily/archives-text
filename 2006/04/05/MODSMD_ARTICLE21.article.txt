# Bay Area fans'tales of lament

### Alex Gyr 
What Bonanza!

For the last fifteen years I have
lived and died with the vari
ous sports franchises around
the Bay Area. When the 49ers won
the Super Bowl back when I was
nine, I went cra2y just like the most
diehard of fans. When the Giants
lost the World Series thanks to Scott
"Bleepin" Spiezio in 2002,1 had to
hold back the tears. My friends and
family can tell whether the Giants,
Niners or Cardinal have won or lost
on any given day simply by observ
ing my mood.
Unfortunately, over the last cou
ple of years there have been a lot of
gloomy days. Since the end of 2003,
the Bay Area has had to deal with
disappointment, heartbreak and
plenty of teams that have just plain
stunk. All it takes is a look at the six
major local sports franchises to get a
sense of how rough it has been re
cently.
San Francisco Giants
After breaking my heart in
Game Six of the 2002 World Series
and, then again, a year later in the
first round against the Marlins, it
has been all downhill for the boys in ;
black and orange. The Bonds scan
dal, the devastating loss to the
Dodgers that ended the 2004 play
off run, and then the disappoint- 1
ment of last year have left Giants '
fans wondering if a World Series
title in San Francisco will ever be- •
come a reality.
Oakland A's
You know it is a bad sign when
you have to close off the upper deck
of your stadium because the fans
aren't showing up. The last two
years, the A's have been in the hunt;
down to the final weekend, only to
lose a deciding series to the hated J
Angels. Ouch.
San Ftancisco 49ers
The team wins two games •
through 14 weeks, and I'm thinking
Reggie Bush would look great in red
and gold. Then they beat the Rams
and Texans in the final two games to
win the Vernon Davis sweepstakes. I
now wake up in a cold sweat think
ing about another 4-12 season.
Oakland Raiders
No one wants to coach the
Raiders. Even fewer people want to
watch the Raiders.
Golden State Warriors
Zero playoff appearances since
1994. Need I say more?
San Jose Sharks
The Sharks made a nice playoff
run back in 2004, but after a year off,
it looks like they are going to miss
the playoffs after having a great op
portunity to make a late push. Plus,
their mascot tackles unsuspecting
fans. Not cool.

Clearly, it has been a tough year
for Bay Area sports fans. But my in
tent is not just to chronicle the losing
habits of my favorite teams.
Instead, I want to call out the
management and ownership: get it
together. Though it gets a bad wrap
nationally, the Bay Area has some of
the most devoted and passionate
fans around, and they deserve bet
ter. John York, Chris Cohan and all
you other owners —it is time to
change things for the better.
We can't complain of long-term
anguish like fans in Cleveland,
Seattle or San Diego, but recently it
has been as bad as it can get for a
market with so many teams. I can't
help but be jealous of Boston, a city
with just four major professional
sports teams, which has enjoyed
three Super Bowl titles and a
World Series victory in the last five
years.
I'll hang in there cheering for!
the Warriors when they're losing by
20 to the Clippers, and heckling Kurt
Warner even though the Cardinals
are up by 35 on the 49ers at halftime
but don't be surprised if you see
me sporting a Florida hat during the
next few days.
Everyone needs a good day once
in awhile.

Junior Alex Gyr needs a good day
once in awhile too. Make his dreams
