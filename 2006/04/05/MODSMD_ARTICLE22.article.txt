## Fast times, rain or shine 
### ISRAEL ROJAS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While the rain went nowhere this
weekend, the Stanford athletes who
qualified for the NCAA West Re
gional in the 32nd edition of the
Nike Stanford Track and Field Invi
tational will.
The two-day extravaganza fea
tured more than 4,000 high school, col
legiate and post-collegiate runners,
and some of the nation's top collegiate
programs, including 2006 NCAA in
door men's champion, Arkansas. The
Pac-10 also was in full force, as every
school in the conference attended
with the exception of Arizona, who
was hosting its own meet.
After guiding the Stanford
women's track team to their best fin
ish in 14 years, head coach Edrick Flo
real received Coach of the Year hon
ors for the West Region.
"The women are poised and ready
to take on the challenge [of the out
door season]," Floreal said.
While the men's indoor season was
not as successful, Coach Floreal was
still pleased with their performance.
"The men came together and com
peted well, even if the NCAA results
did not show it," Floreal said.
Floreal emphasized that there is
still much room for improvement a
sentiment echoed by several Cardinal
athletes.
Sophomore Wopamo Osaisai ref
erenced "the starts and beginnings of
[his] races" as the areas he will focus
upon for improvement. During this
weekend's competition, Osaisai won
the 100-meter event and qualified for
the NCAA West Regional.
Sophomore Chauntae Bayne ex
pressed a similar perspective.

"My start is what killed me in the
60-meter, and my finish is what killed
me in the 200-meter," she said.
But neither weakness was enough
to stop Bayne from winning this week
end, as she took the 200-meter race in
a regional qualifying time 0f23.27 sec
onds.
Over the past several years, Stan
ford's Cobb Track and Angell Field
has gained a reputation for being a fast
distance track. It has become the pre
mier venue for fast times in the middle
and distance events. As such, it hosts
the Distance Carnival a series of
races that includes the 1500-, 3000-,
5,000- and 10,000-meter races, as well
as the steeplechase.
Junior Arianna Lambie continued
her dominance as she ran the sixth
fastest school 5000-meter time, win
ning the event in 15:44.23 minutes
another regional qualifying time. Ear
lier this month, Lambie was named
the NCAA Division I Women's In
door Track Athlete of the Year for the
West Region. Lambie garnered three
Ail-American honors at the NCAA
Indoor Championships, and now has
10 for her Stanford career.
The list of athletes who have quali
fied to compete at the NCAA West
Regional grew quite long this week
end, as over 15 athletes hit qualifying
marks. Several of those marks came in
winning efforts, as sophomore Erica
McLain won the long jump, sopho
more Michael Garcia won in the 800,
senior Sarah Hopping won in the
hammer and sophomore Danielle
Maier won in the javelin with a school
record throw of 165-1 feet.
By the end of the invitational, it
was clear that nothing not even the
dreary weekend weather could
stop the Cardinal.
