# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Card served consecutive losses by Warriors 
### JOE KAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's volleyball team had
almost two weeks off one to recharge
their batteries, and another to prepare for
Hawaii but the No. 3 Warriors still man
aged to sweep the Cardinal in straight
games.
Last Wednesday, Hawaii won 30-20,30-
19,30-21 in Burnham Pavilion. Except for
the beginning of the third game, the War
riors never let the Cardinal get close. For
the first game, Hawaii hit an impressive
.542, and for the entire match a more
human, but nonetheless impressive, .350.
Stanford hit a measly .074 for the entire
match, which head coach Don Shaw attrib
uted to Hawaii's serving accuracy and
strength.
"Hawaii served us very effectively,"
Shaw said. "We were just never able to get
anything going offensively. That was the
whole match."
The Warriors had an amazing 11 aces in
the match, easily topping Stanford's two.
The precision of their serving was a large
factor in their dominance, as both teams
committed exactly 12 serving errors.
Senior outside hitter Ben Reddy led the
Cardinal with 10 kills, and senior middle
blocker Chris Ahlfeldt added eight. Setters
senior Jeremy Jacobs and freshman Miki
Groppi once again split the duty of dishing
out assists, totting 25 together.
With 12 kills, senior outside hitter Jose
Delgado led Hawaii. Junior Brian Beck
with picked up 21 assists for the Warriors.
The following night, Shaw mixed up his
lineup, hoping that the younger players
would bring a different and more focused
intensity to the game. Freshmen middle
blocker Brandon Williams, Groppi, libero
Jarod Keller and sophomore outside hitter
Jesse Meredith all got the start.
However, the accuracy and overall
evenhanded rounds of the Warriors
proved to be too much. Although the Car
dinal would soar to its highest point total of
this past week during the second game,
Hawaii again beat the Cardinal in straight
sets, 30-16,30-24,30-22.
Reddy again shone, this time posting a

match-high 14 kills. Meredith jumped at
the starting opportunity, pounding away 12
balls on only 20 attempts for a .450 hitting
percentage. Groppi, who played the entire
game at setter, had 31 assists.
Hawaii junior outside hitter Lauri
Hakala led the Warriors with 11 kills, and
Beckwith split his setting duties with fresh
man Sean Carney. They combined for 38
assists.
"Hawaii is a very solid team, and that's
why they are ranked [No. 3] in the nation,"
Ahlfeldt said.
However, Ahlfeldt added that the Car
dinal did improve this past week, mainly
offensively and in passing.
Stanford looks to put forth a more spir
ited effort this coming weekend in their
two final home matches of the season,
when they host UCLA and UC-Irvine.
On Friday, the Card face UCLA a
surging squad who recently beat Long
Beach State 3-0. However, the Cardinal
had an encouraging match against the Bru
ins earlier in the season. They lost 3-1, but
had a brilliant 30-22 victory in the second
game of the match.
Stanford will depend upon Reddy and
another outside hitter perhaps Mered
ithâ€” to counteract UCLA's strong out
side hitters in Paul George and Steve
Klosterman. If the Cardinal can bring the
same attitude they had going into the sec
ond game of their last face-off with UCLA
to the court, the match should be exciting.
On Saturday, they will face a seemingly
unbeatable Irvine team. The Anteaters are
on an unbelievable 17-game win streak
and are comfortably sitting atop the na
tional rankings. However, with Reddy's
arm and the team's effective passing, the
Cardinal nonetheless hope to stop the
Anteaters' run.
"This is a frustrating way for the seniors
to finish off their careers, so what we would
like to do is get at least one, or maybe two
more wins [this weekend]," Reddy said.
These games will be the final go-around
for five seniors Reddy, Ahlfeldt, Jacobs,
and outside hitters William Clayton and
Nick Manov.
"Hopefully for the seniors, we can end
on a high note," Reddy said.
