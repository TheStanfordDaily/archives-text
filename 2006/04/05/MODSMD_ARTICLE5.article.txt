# CAMPUS LIFE
## Winter parties lack energy, attendance Numbers show consistency in fall and winter parties 
### BRIA LONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Spring is historically the quarter of
fun in the sun on the Stanford campus,
thus ending what most students be
lieve to be a distinct winter quarter
slump in the party scene.
But the numbers tell a different
story. In fact, the winter proved just as
festive as the fall, rolling in with three
more registered parties for a grand
total of 131,53 of which were open to
the entire campus. Students also en
joyed the same number of invite-only
parties during both quarters.
Memorable campus-wide winter
quarter parties included the Graffiti
Party at Sigma Kai, the infamous
Foam Party at Kappa Sig, Kappa
Alpha's (KA) Olympic Party, the 80s
party at Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE)
and Sigma Nu's "Frat Party." In addi
tion, many dorms hosted their annual
screw-your-roommate rites of pas
sage, complete with dances, bowling
and roller-disco.
According to Interim Party Plan
ning Educator Ralph Castro, Stanford
is "right on track to match or exceed
[the] average" number of parties per
year 380.4."
So what makes so many students
feel that the winter party scene is lack

ing? One theory is that bashes in the
spring and fall simply pack more
punch.
According to freshman Amy Stein
berg, "There was definitely a different
dynamic at winter parties they
weren't as exciting or energetic as the
ones during fall quarter."
There is also the fact that winter
fetes tend to attract fewer weekend
partygoers which many students
agree dampens the overall experience.
Also, for freshmen, the initial
splendor of fraternity parties seems to
wear off come January. Heftier class
schedules and inclement weather also
contribute to a decline in the number
of attendees.
"I think a lot of people take heavy
course loads during the winter so they
can relax and party more during
spring quarter," freshman Ooshma
Garg said.
This winter quarter has also seen a
record number of rainy days un
paralleled since 1904 and few
choose to venture into the cold in
party attire.
"Your shoes get wet, your feet are
cold,you have to bring an umbrella...it
just never seemed that worth it and
it's freezing," freshman Jessica Fried
land said.
The rain continues today, for the
nth day in a row, which may bode
poorly for spring celebrants looking
forward to the famed Exotic Erotic
and Sigma Nu's popular Sunsplash.

onto the upcoming spring election ballot. After much debate, additions to the ballot were held.
