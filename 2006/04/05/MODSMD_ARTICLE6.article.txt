# 750 PUB QUESTIONS ALCOHOL SERVICE
## 
### CLAY BAVINGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Management of The 750, Stanford's
popular on-campus pub, has been asking
students to sign a petition to support the
continued serving of alcohol.
"We're really just trying to see what the
students want," said Josh Stern, manager
and co-owner of The 750.
The petition was not started in response
to pressure from the University or any
other authority to stop serving alcohol,
rather it is "a personal gauge for us," Stern
said. "We want to know that we are sup
ported and the students like our service,
and we want to let the students know that
we appreciate them and want to serve them
as best as possible."
When asked, most students said they
support the establishment's sale of alcohol.
"I think it's nice to have a place on cam
pus where older students can hang out and
drink," said junior Kate Checchi.

A handful of students, however, have ex
pressed opposition to The 750's provision
of alcohol.
"I've been in The 750 a couple of times
and would enjoy it more and like the atmos
phere more if there wasn't any alcohol,"
said one student who wished to remain
anonymous.
But most, including those students who
choose not to drink, said they like the on
campus bar's ambience and the availability
of alcohol.
"I have no problem with The 750 serving
alcohol," said freshman Grant Escue. "as
long as they are responsible about serving it
and the students are responsible about
drinking it."
Management does not want to see the
pub become another sandwich shop, Stern
said.
"The University is fine with us serving
alcohol now," he said. "But the committees

change and maybe somewhere
down the road they will try to ban
the alcohol. It's nice to know the stu
dents support our services in case
this ever happens."
The 750 currently serves beer
11 on tap and many others bottled
but no hard liquor. It does carry
Soju, a Korean vodka with half the
alcoholic proof of regular vodka, in
addition to Saki.
"This allows us to make some
mixed drinks," Stern said.
The 750 also hosts many pro
grams and events. Every Tuesday
night the pub hosts a live comedy
show, which runs until 11 p.m. and is
followed by an open-mic session.
Friday nights kick off with Karaoke,

and Thursdays are special grad stu
dent nights.
However, Stern emphasized that
while most students feel The 750 is a
graduate student bar, this is not the
case.
"Of course, to drink you must be
21 and so many undergrads cannot,
but anyone is welcome to eat or
shoot a game of pool," he said.
"Some undergrads do come in.
However, I don't think most under
grads are aware that they are wel
come."
Because The 750 is located be
hind Mirrielees,many of its residents
frequent the pub.
"It's nice to get a burger and
watch a little television after I finish
my work," one of the dorm's resi
dents said.
The pub's menu is fairly upscale,
and consists of more than just chips
and burgers. Stern said he likes to
think of it as a "gourmet pub."
