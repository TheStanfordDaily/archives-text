When the University was stuck
with more than $l6O million in dam
age after the 1989 earthquake, gener
ous alumni and a healthy endow
ment, paired with federal assistance
helped get the campus back on its
feet. The Bing Wing of Green Li
brary, exhibit 7, is highlighted as a
testament to the help Stanford re
ceived in a time of true need.
Today, the University is known as
a leader in earthquake research.
Multiple stops on the tour show how
the tragedy of the quake manifested
itself in the desire to limit damage in
future disasters and to protect build
ings from seismic stress.
"Much of the vital research that
has been done on earthquakes and
earthquake engineering is a direct
result of that [1906] event," Hagen
said. "Many innovative earthquake
engineering techniques have been
used to retrofit [upgrade] the cam
pus, and Stanford has become a
leader on earthquake prepared
ness."
Analysis of the seismic data from
1906 helped Stanford geologists con
firm the Elastic Rebound Theory
and significantly broadened scientif
ic understanding of plate tectonics.
The Blume Earthquake Engineering
Center, stop 9 on the tour, recognizes
the contributions of several "pio
neering researchers" who did their
work on The Farm.
With better understanding of an
earthquake's nature, the University
has continually upgraded its archi
tectural engineering. Walking the
tour illuminates different trends in
construction over the years. The "gut
and stuff' technique used to retrofit
Building 380 is contrasted on sign 5
with the careful attention to detail in
the preservation of the Language
Corner during the 19905.
When the University concluded
that the Mitchell Earth Sciences
Building (stop 10) was not safe, it
completed a seismic retrofit in 1997.

When Memorial Church (stop 4)
lost its spire in 1906 and what is now
the Cantor Arts Center (stop 1) sus
tained heavy damage in 1989, the
University used new methods to
make both stronger than before.
Sometimes engineers conclude
that buildings should not be fixed. A
sign explains the rationale for what is
labeled 'post-destruction decisions'
outside the abandoned Old Chem
istry Building (stop 2).
"On a broader level, earthquakes
force us to examine our priorities
and reanalyze the way Stanford
functions," Surma said. "They help us
figure out what is important and take
us in new directions."
The 1906 quake still informs deci
sion making in preparation for the
next big quake. At stop 9, precau
tions for future disasters are out
lined.
"The unfortunate reality of living
in this beautiful area is that we are

prone to earthquakes," Hagen said.
"We have a 62 percent chance of ex
periencing a major earthquake in the
next 30 years."
The signs initially debuted in
March before the last lecture in a se
ries about the 1906 earthquake. The
signs were placed around campus on
Monday.
Organizers said this week that the
response has been positive.
"I am already surprised at how ef
fective the tour has been in increas
ing awareness," Surma said. "It's im
possible not to be curious, especially
at a site like Old Chem that is fre
quently a source of wonder."
The tour takes anywhere from
one to two hours. Maps are available
at the Visitor's Center in Memorial
Auditorium and at the Blume Earth
quake Engineering Center.
Hagen said that a few guided
tours may be offered during the
month.
