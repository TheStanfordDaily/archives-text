OIL AND WAR: OIL-PEAK vs. OIL-PANIC
Lectures, seminar, and research often to junior and senior undergraduate and graduate students, staff,
and faculty interested in exploring the links between oil future and
future global impact including international conflict.
The course will consist of lectures by the instructor and guest speakers, seminar like discussions,
and directed studies. As a final product, we will try to put together a critical (hopefully publishable)
report of our analysis of the course's topics.
Each student will be expected to contribute a term project as a section to this report.
