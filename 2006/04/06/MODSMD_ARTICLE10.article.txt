### CAITLIN BERKA ALIYYA HAQUE 
She Student Organizing Com
nittee for the Arts (SOCA) has
>utdone itself this year in
tion for An Art Affair, a day
long celebration of the artistic commu
nity at Stanford. Touted as "the largest
student-run arts festival in Stanford
history," An Art Affair boasts a pletho
ra of creative output, from modern
dance and mariachi bands to found-ob
ject sculptures, art-house films and ex
perimental poetry.
Hie exhibition is comprised of a
main gallery and three separate stages
in White Plaza, where performances
and static pieces await the curious visi
tor. Yet this is no mere feast for the
eyes. Goodie bags include free copies
of the Creative Writing Anthology and
the Stanford Soundtrack Volume V,

which includes songs with titles like
"Genuflect" by Father Octopus —
what's not to love?
But the gravy (so to speak) is the
free gourmet dinner for 6(H) provided
by the Stanford Cooking Club. If the
thought of ITiai Chicken Satay and
Risotto Milanese makes your mouth
water, get in line at 5:30 p.m.
Several students have expressed ex
citement over this year's An Art Affair.
"I think it'll be a good event, espe
cially because there are some great stu
dent groups performing," says junior
Preeya Jayakar. "It's a good opportuni
ty to see so many different types of
groups on stage. Plus, free music and
food always draws the big crowds."
Other students praise the diversity
of the event.
"I'm definitely going to be attend
ing," says sophomore Jessica Koh. "I
think that it's a really great showcase of

many different forms of art and has a lit
tle bit of every thing, both audio and visu
al forms of art. An Art Affair is also one
of Stanford's more lively events, and it's
a great way of reflecting many student
groups' presence on Stanford's campus."
Some students say they hope that
this year's An Art Affair will surpass
that of previous years.
"I've attended An Art Affair since
my freshman year, and I've really en
joyed all the events," says junior Kopal
Kulkarni. "I hope this year's show will
be even bigger and better, and I get to
see some cool student groups per
form."
Since its debut in 2(HM), the goal of
An Art Affair has been to promote
artistic expression and to provide a
means of publicizing such artistry.
Mark your calendars for tomorrow —
April 7. An Art Affair is not to be
missed.
