## Editorial 'Tis better to be silent 
### 
While studying may be the last thing
on many students' minds at the be
ginning of a new quarter, good
study space becomes a valued commodity
during Finals Week. Of course, Stanford has
provided its students with countless libraries
and computer labs, most of which are filled
with comfortable couches, well-lit tables and
easily accessible computers. Yet even with
this abundance of study space, finding a
quiet place to work can be quite an ordeal.
Regardless of where you go, there are always
those few who just can't seem to respect
public study areas.
For many, a quiet place to study is vital for
academic success and the Editorial Board
thinks that students should show respect for
their peers in libraries and other public study
areas.To make this easier, the Board has pro
vided a short list of library dos and don'ts.
Don't talk on your cell phone. This is the
library's cardinal rule and, sadly, the one that
is most often ignored. If a friend or loved one
calls, don't pick up — no one wants to hear
about your personal affairs. Some, however,
may argue that ignoring calls on purpose is a
strict don't of social etiquette. If you are
among these individuals, answer the phone
and tell the caller that you are in the library
and will call back in a few minutes, hours or
days. If someone important, like an employ
er, calls and you must talk to him immediate
ly, go outside. If you need the use of a com
puter while talking on the phone, then you
really shouldn't be in the library. But on the
off chance that you are, try to at least speak
in a hushed tone and keep the call short.
Do put your cell phone on silent or on vi
brate. This one speaks for itself — there's
nothing more annoying than hearing a poly
phonic rendition of Britney Spears' "Hit Me
Baby One More Time," repeatedly and at
full volume. Of course, everyone — even the

most respectful — sometimes forgets. But
after you've realized your mistake, place
your phone on silent or vibrate — or maybe
even in the off mode. Unless you want to get
a room full of dirty looks, don't let it ring re
peatedly.
Don't chat with your friends. Studying
with friends is always more fun than being
alone. But there are special sections for
group study — use them. Green Library has
some wonderful, sound-proof study rooms,
and the rooms surrounding Meyer are al
ways open — they even include fun chalk
and white boards,along with some cool high
tech equipment. If you're studying alone and
see one of your good friends walk in, a quick
"hello" and "how are you?" are okay, but
(like in the case of the cell phone) use
hushed tones and keep the conversation
short. Otherwise, take the conversation out
side.
When listening to music, do use head
phones and make sure that sound isn't leak
ing out. Luckily, the majority of students are
sensitive enough to use headphones, but, for
some, that's not enough.There's always that
one person who listens to his music on full
blast, and the sound inevitably leaks through
— rendering the headphones essentially
useless. Make sure to either turn down your
music to a volume inaudible to others or use
those super, leak-proof headphones that are
all the rage.
Don't eat food that makes a lot of noise.
We all like a study snack, but those around
you may not be as enthused about your
crinkly candy wrappers, loud gum smacking
or apple crunching. Choose your food wise
ly-
As a final point of library etiquette, do re
member that the first floor of Meyer is, in
fact, a library — not just a walkway — and
that the above rules still apply.
