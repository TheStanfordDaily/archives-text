# Guilt by association
## 
### 
The March 13 lacrosse party at Duke
has deservedly sparked national
media attention.The allegations made
by one of the strippers that she was cornered
into a bathroom, gang-raped, sodomized
and choked by three members of the team
are absolutely revolting. Officials are now
investigating the incident as first-degree
forcible rape, common law robbery, first-de
gree kidnapping, first-degree sexual assault
and felonious strangulation.
According to police reports, several
pieces of evidence corroborate the dancers
story. Officers recovered the woman's make
up, cell phone and a stack of $20 dollar bills
at the site of the crime that are consistent
with the $4(M) that she claimed were stolen
the night after the attack. Furthermore, she
was treated at a hospital for vaginal and anal
injuries that would indicate a rape occurred.
No students will be charged until the re
sults of the DNA testing taken by all the
players on the team are known. Should any
of the students be convicted of all the allega
tions the woman has made, they will face a
minimum prison sentence of 16 to 20 years.
When the results of the DNA tests are in,
I believe that three of the players on the
team will be found guilty. Despite their ex
pensive lawyers and carefully crafted alibis,
they will most likely serve some serious jail
time. And 1 hope they do. If these allegations
are true, they deserve to rot in a cell — prep
school education and all.
However, the public and the media have
unfortunately labeled the entire group
guilty before seeing the results of the DNA
testing. Because the team has chosen not to
make any statements — a request, I might
add, of Duke University — the media has
been quick to label all of them as the perpe
trators of the crime.
To gain a better perspective on the situa
tion at Duke, I contacted a good friend of
mine from high school whose brother is on
the Duke lacrosse team. My friend chose to
remain anonymous to protect her brother.
Needless to say, her description of the situa
tion at Duke does not match the media's
portrayal.
According to her brother, the events at
the house didn't transpire exactly as the
media has portrayed them. She agrees that
the party was a "lacrosse party," but says
that her brother, along with many of his
teammates, left the house before the dancer
arrived. By his estimates, less than half the
team was at the house when the incident oc
curred. The media has largely ignored these
details.
The campus has been quick to blame the
team for the bad publicity now upon the uni
versity without considering the implications
for the members of the team that had noth
ing to do with the incident.
Perhaps most bothersome is that the stu
dents, like the media, have failed to wait to
get all the details of what actually happened.
"[Students] tried to abstract the incident
and discuss it without any details or facts,"
she said, "People really don't know what is
going on because the team's lawyers won't
release a statement yet."

Yet without the details, the campus and
the public have shunned the entire team
through their affiliation with the alleged per
petrators of the incident. All the members of
the team, except for the one African Ameri
can student, were forced to be DNA tested,
even students that were out of the state at
the time of the incident.
"A few of the seniors were in New York
that weekend for job interviews," she noted,
"They were still DNA tested and are being
attacked just by affiliation."
The members of the team have become
completely ostracized by the rest of the cam
pus.
"Life is living hell for the guys down
there," my friend added, "People spit on
them on the way to class, the campus food
courts won't serve them."
In the past couple days the situation has
escalated even further. Athletic busses have
been set on fire. A fire was started in a dorm
where many of the players live. Since this
week is gang initiation week in Durham,
players have received several threats of
drive-by shootings.
She also added that it isn't only the stu
dents who are reacting this way. Professors
make snide and judgmental comments with
in their lectures, even when members of the
lacrosse team are sitting right in front of
them.
"The reaction on campus is very much
about clinging to moral absolutes," my
friend said.
Even at Duke, an institution with strong
academics, students and faculty alike have
vilified all of these young men, many of
whom had nothing to do with the alleged in
cident. The country has reacted the same
way.
Don't get me wrong, should the accused
students be found guilty of these acts they
should receive the full extent of the law. But
until the facts are sorted out, the media and
the American public should remember that
these students are still innocent until proven
guilty.
Despite our instincts, we have an obliga
tion to the accused to examine all the facts
and wait until they are tried before sending
these students to the town square to be
tarred and feathered. It is their right, just as
it would be our right should we be in a simi
lar situation.
And let us not forget that incidents like
this one are not entirely foreign to Stanford,
either. I seem to recall an incident in a fresh
man dorm involving an athletic team and a
sorority just three years ago...
