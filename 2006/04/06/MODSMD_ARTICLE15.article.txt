Molweni, bafundi. Ninjani?
Good morning, teacher. We are fine. How
are you?
Ndiphilile enkosi. llena, uvelaphi. Ufunda
ntoni.
1 am from New York. I am studying public
health.
Morning Xhosa lessons take me back
to 3rd grade French class when we
would drone through a ritual of
greetings every morning at the start of class.
My resume ciaims I'm fluent in two lan
guages and "proficient" in two others, so be
fore coming here, I figured learning a new
language would be cake.
A month and a half later, 1 can't say
much beyond, "My name is llena" and"I
don't eat meat." I can, however, yell "Get
out!" to the chickens (who understand only
Xhosa) that live in the yard and like to
sneak into the house when my homestay
family isn't looking.
Part of why we're learning Xhosa is be
cause it is widely spoken throughout the
Eastern Cape, including throughout New
Brighton — the township where we're
staying.
Some of the girls came here seeking an
"authentic" experience, but when the van
reached the roundabout at the entrance to
the township and reality rather than romance
started breathing down their necks, they got
nervous. I'll admit to being a little apprehen
sive, but that was because I was expecting to
live under a dictator.
A few days before we were dropped off
with our new families, the director of my pro
gram doled out little hints as to what we
could expect. Regarding my host mother, he
acted coy and said only,"She's very strict."
Instead of a stern matron, I got a rather
large and effusive woman who grabbed me,
sat me down on her lap — though "sat" isn't
quite strong enough of a word — and pro
ceeded to bear hug me. Dissatisfied with the
Xhosa name 1 was given in class — ironically
meaning "calm and quiet" — she almost im
mediately renamed me "Lilita," meaning the
equally ironic "something sparkly."
Re-christened, newly adopted and stuffed
full of unusual yet delicious food (mostly
cooked in a delectable substance my father

outlawed from our home — butter), I felt
like an exotic pet just brought home from the
store. As soon as I became a little less enter
taining, the family reverted back to their nor
mal routine — watching television. I felt like
I was home.
Back in New York, "family time" is gen
erally spent in front of the goon tube. It all
started back in the day, when my clad would
take a break from work and watch "Clarissa
Explains it All" with me and my siblings —
he was more entertained by it than we were.
Since then my family has graduated to
shows about unstable doctors who never
seem to face legal action for their question
able activities.
After years of practice, I've become ex
ceptionally good at watching TV. Even when
all that's on is news programming in a lan
guage where the same word means thigh,
pumpkin, kraal and thong, depending on
your inflection of the vowels.
The toilets might flush in the opposite di
rection in this part of the world but family
time is no different. Each night my host fam
ily and 1 bring our plates of mngqusho and
steamed bread to the couch and tunc into
WWE Smackdown or a long-since cancelled
American sitcom, beaming down from the
past like starlight. South African program
ming includes an eclectic mix of successful
and obscure programming from America
and Britain, as well as South African soap op
eras that our host mothers watch religiously
(and we discuss obsessively on the bus ride to
school the next morning).
Despite our warm welcome into these
homes, as a group of white students we stand
out here. This has led to some negative en
counters — like when the student living next
door and I, led by my host mother's grand
daughter, tried to weave our way back home
through back alleys to avoid a group of boys
that cursed us out.
As a group, we went to see "Tsotsi" just
before it won the Academy Award. After
wards, while some girls were drying their eyes
and 1 was still trying to get over the fact that
movies cost the equivalent of two dollars, we
were approached by a reporter for a local
newspaper, who was curious as to what a
group of young white girls were doing with
several older black men (our program's ad
ministrators). She interviewed one of us and

photographed the rest for an article on the
movie. Usually the kinds of strangers that ap
proach me in movie theaters make me wish I
carried a taser.
A few days later, we visited a "health
promoting" school in a nearby town to
learn about the Life Orientation Curricu
lum implemented there. Three other girls
and I were visiting a classroom when a
school administrator motioned to us to
come outside. Urging us to follow her, she
said she wanted us to give a motivational
speech to the kids entering their last year of
high school.
Suddenly we found ourselves in front of a
large audience of 12th graders, their parents
and school administrators. We knew nothing
about these kids, their curriculum or the chal
lenges ahead of them, both in trying to grad
uate and in pursuing higher education (or if
college was even an option).The crowd burst
into applause when we said we were from
America — which was really our only quali
fication for speaking to them.
In the end, it's all about compromise —
the give and take that leads to equilibrium
(which, if you're a lorn Stoppard fan, you
know is the key to happiness). Our homestay
families have accepted us, cleared out rooms
tor us, put up with our odd hours and odder
eating habits. But, as strangers in a strange
land, the onus is on us to be flexible.
Sometimes unexpected things pose chal
lenges. Like when someone's daughter is
consistently referred to as "he." Xhosa's pro
nouns have no gender, so learning gendered
English pronouns can be difficult for native
Xhosa speakers. I 'm learning to adapt to sub
jects and objects, taking a walk on the wild
side in the middle of a conversation just as
I m learning to accept the use of sour milk in
staple Xhosa dishes. My neighbor is learning
to bathe in a bucket, as her family has no in
door plumbing.
As for the rooster who lives beneath my
window and wakes me up at three minute in
tervals between 3 and 5 am each day, I can
only say 1 'm comforted by the fact that some
day, whether it's bv humans or maggots, he
will be eaten.

Last week, I lena ( ieorge was offered a cow (is a
dowry. If you con top that, email her at icge
