## Speaker bemoans CA high school woes State Sec. of Education stresses need for teacher incentives 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
California's high schools desperately need
broad-based reform, starting with improving
teacher quality, California's Secretary of Edu
cation Alan Bersin told several hundred peo
ple at his School of Education-sponsored lec
ture in Cubberley Auditorium last night.
In an hour-long speech more morose than
optimistic, the smooth-talking Schwarzeneg
ger appointee diagnosed what he said is
wrong with the status quo and offered broad
sketches about how his boss' administration
wants to reverse the tide.
Bersin cited recent test scores at the ele
mentary and middle school levels as evidence
of "significant progress" but said that efforts
to improve student performance in high
schools have "stalled."
Drawing on a 30-slide PowerPoint presen
tation packed with charts 011 education per
formance, which each audience member also
received as a handout, the former U.S. Attor
ney made the case for significant, lasting re
form.
Bersin decried the "apartheid" of the edu
cation system before the implementation of
Brown vs. Board of Education, the 1954

Supreme Court decision he called the most
important of the last century. And with only
54.6 percent of African-American males grad
uating from high school, he called the achieve
ment gap the most crucial problem facing ed
ucation reformers.
Bersin said much of the dropout problem
stems from poor preparation in earlier grades,
when teachers pass unprepared students on to
the next grade.
"[Reform] is about how quickly we can ac
celerate the quality of the teaching profes
sion," he said. "It's about the teacher."
"We can restructure our high schools as
much as we like," he said. "But we will not see
student achievement improve without an im
provement in the quality of teaching."
Bersin also said he is worried about the
mal-distribution of quality teachers â€” who
teaches in which schools, how they get there
and how long they stay there. Unlike the pri
vate sector, he said that the newest teachers
get stuck in the most difficult jobs with the
most challenging assignments.
He criticized the state's deeply-rooted
compensation and tenure systems for teach
ers as "obstacles," echoing rhetoric used un
successfully by Schwarzenegger to lobby last
year for Proposition 74. Offering no specifics,
he called for "monetary and non-monetary in
centives to attract and retain quality teach
ers."
"We need to be careful because each of the
suggested routes for reform holds promise

but also has the risk of taking us backward,"
he said. "The answer is not to retreat from the
academic mission of high schools."
Bersin took credit for what he called suc
cessful reform efforts during his tenure as su
perintendent of San Diego schools. He
showed a three-minute video that he said
showcased the sense of energy invested in the
project to increase the number of schools in
his district.
He did not mention that his contract was
cut short by the San Diego school board under
pressure from the teacher's union. He was
criticized by the California Teacher's Associa
tion for what they called his "top-down, bu
reaucratic style [that] divided the community,
hurt teacher morale and failed to significantly
improve student learning."
Bersin sees his work as an important part of
a needed generational effort to create equal
access and opportunity for students.
"Something is happening," he said. "This is
one of those seismic periods when the old
gives way to the new."
Bersin recently became a guest lecturer at
Stanford and is teaching a course on weekends
with Education Prof. Linda Darling-Ham
mond.
In her conclusion, School of Education
Dean Deborah Stipek said Bersin has the
most important and difficult job in the sate of
California. Perhaps ironically, then, she
thanked him for his lecture with a bottle of
wine.
