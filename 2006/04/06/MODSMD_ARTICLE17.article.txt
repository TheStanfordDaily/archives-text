## Football ready for spring Coach Harris addresses concerns and rumors surrounding the team

With spring practice starting on Friday, head
football coach Walt Harris discussed several issues

program."
Harris declined to elaborate on the nature of
their conduct, stating Harrison and Traverso had
built a "challenging road" for themselves and pre

of injuries suffered last season, most notably to his
shoulder, has taken "a turn for the positive" in the

Receiver Evan Moore, who suffered a dislocat
ed hip in the season opener at Navy, was praised for

his attitude and training in recovery. Moore and
Mark Bradford are expected to be among the most
feared receiver duos in the west.
Harris was noncommittal when asked about a

linebackers, as used by the Cardinal in the recent
past; the 4-3, with four defensive linemen and three
linebackers, is a more Ã¼biquitous college defensive
scheme. He suggested the coaches would look at
both and determine which they were more comfort
able with at the end of the spring, while adding that
in the long term, depth and recruiting will deter-
