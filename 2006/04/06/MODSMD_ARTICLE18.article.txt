# AT A GLANCE
## 
### 
1. Who will be special?
Special teams saved the Cardi
nal from defeat several times
last season, thanks to the return
skills of cornerback T.J. Rushing,
the booming leg of kickoff spe
cialist Michael Sgroi and the
coaching of Tom Quinn. All
three are now gone.
2. How will the defense patch its holes?
Stanford lost many key contribu
tors from last year's defensive
unit — defensive linemen Ba
batunde Oshinowo and Julian
Jenkins, linebackers Kevin
Schimmelmann and Jon Alston,
and Rushing. The most glaring
weakness are at defensive line,
and in the secondary, where
Nick Sanchez needs to become
a lockdown cornerback.
3. Who will develop at wide receiver?
Behind Evan Moore and Mark
Bradford on the spring roster is
just one scholarship receiver,
senior Marcus McCutcheon.
The corps needs to start building
for the 2007 season now.
4. Are the quarterbacks ready to rumble?
Trent Edwards single-handedly
shouldered the offensive burden
at times last season, and he fig
ures blossom if he can finally
stay healthy for an entire sea
son. If he can't, T.C. Ostrander
must be more effective than he
was in backup duty last year.
5. Is the public buying it?
The program is banking on the
quality and novelty of the new
stadium to bring in more fans
and wow recruits. The team
needs to dramatically improve
in this season and years to come
— or squander a golden oppor
tunity.
