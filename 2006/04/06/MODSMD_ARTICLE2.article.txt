### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
Vint Cerf, a renowned co-founder of the In
ternet, delivered the opening remarks yester
day at the third Conference on Innovation
Journalism.
Cerf, who currently serves as vice president
and chief Internet evangelist for Google, co
designed the TCP/IP protocols of the Internet
and played a key role in developing its archi

partner Robert Kahn — received the U.S. Na
tional Medal of Technology from President
Bill Clinton in 1997.
Cerf became interested in innovation jour
nalism through his friend David Nordfors, the
conference's co-char, who he met through his
involvement with the Internet Society Task

big changes affecting the news industry. Sig

this megaphone," he said.
Twenty years later, the Internet adopted
the World Wide Web. and by the next decade
"everybody knows how to casually express
their opinion through weblogging," Cerf said.
"We're seeing a technological landscape
which is very different from what it was when
the Internet was first designed, transforming
the opportunities for self-expression." he said.
"The consequence of that is that people inter

a larger choice of news to choose among than
