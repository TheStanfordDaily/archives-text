## VINT CERF SPEAKS TO THE DAILY ABOUT THE INTERNET, ITS GROWTH AND FUTURE 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
Vint Cerf, a renowned co-founder of the In
ternet, delivered the opening remarks yester
day at the third Conference on Innovation
Journalism.
Cerf, who currently serves as vice president
and chief Internet evangelist for Google, co
designed the TCP/IP protocols of the Internet
and played a key role in developing its archi
tecture. For his work. Cerf — along with his
partner Robert Kahn — received the U.S. Na
tional Medal of Technology from President
Bill Clinton in 1997.
Cerf became interested in innovation jour
nalism through his friend David Nordfors, the
conference's co-char, who he met through his
involvement with the Internet Society Task
Force (ISTF), which develops Internet stan
dards and protocols.
Nordfors, co-chair of the conference, re
marked in his introduction of Cerf yesterday,
"It's the first time a news professional won't

open the conference hut it's appropriate, with
big changes affecting the news industry. Sig
nals show that the tipping point is here."
In an exclusive interview with The Daily,
Cerf spoke about how journalism has changed
with the advent of the Internet. In 1973, print
journalism, radio and television were the prin
cipal forms of mass media, and all were "con
trolled by large organizations that gave only a
few people an opportunity to speak through
this megaphone," he said.
Twenty years later, the Internet adopted
the World Wide Web. and by the next decade
"everybody knows how to casually express
their opinion through weblogging," Cerf said.
"We're seeing a technological landscape
which is very different from what it was when
the Internet was first designed, transforming
the opportunities for self-expression." he said.
"The consequence of that is that people inter
ested in what's going on in the world will have
a larger choice of news to choose among than

they have typically with the traditional media.
The side effect of that is that there will grow up
out of that people who are evaluating the var
ious voices expressing themselves and so
you'll get a kind of value system that you get
today with certain mastheads.
"This is a very fluid environment, and 1
don't think we can foresee precisely how it
evolves," he added. "But whatever it is, the
ground rules are different."
Cerf also reflected on the current status of
the Internet, which he said is not as secure as it
should be.
"Some fundamental technical steps need to
be taken to make the network more robust
and resilient and able to defend itself against
various forms of attack," he said. "But setting

that issue aside, the Net is still rapidly expand
ing its population of users, its speed and its
convenience.
"The inexpensive cost of interfacing
through the Internet means that more and
more things are going to be online," he added.
"So there'll be billions of devices, more than
there are people, in the long run. I see this re
ally interesting networked environment be
coming more and more adaptive to our re
quirements."
Cerf remarked that he never expected the
Internet to develop into what it has become
today.
"We knew that the technology was incredi
bly powerful, but the economics of it were any
thing but attractive at the time," he said.

"That's why it was a research project spon
sored by the Defense Department as opposed
to a consumer product. But as the physics of
everything unfolded, things got cheaper and
cheaper, there was a strong learning curve, so
now you have a billion people on the Net
pouring information into it, pouring informa
tion out, interacting with each other in ways
that no one could have predicted, including
me."
In addition to his work at Google, Cerf has
also been working on the interplanetary ex
tension of the Internet in a jet propulsion lab
oratory since 1998.
"More generally, I'm interested in trying to
make the Internet more accessible to every
body," he said.
