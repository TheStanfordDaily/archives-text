### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team earned a
perfect 4-0 record over spring break, including
two conference wins and a 5-2 defeat of then-
No. 5 Illinois. The No. 12 Cardinal (11-2,2-0 Pac
-10) earned the Pac-10 victories against Oregon
and Washington, in addition to beating Tulsa.
On Wednesday, the team traveled to Illinois
to take on the Fighting Illini (13-5) in a night
match. Stanford picked up No. 2 and No. 3 dou
bles to win the first point and set the tone of the
match. At the second doubles position, junior
James Pade and freshman Blake Muller pulled
off an 8-6 win against then-No. 26 Ryler De-
Heart and Ruben Gonzales.
With the return of senior captain KC Cork
ery to the lineup, the Cardinal won four of six sin
gles matches to secure the victory. Playing at the
top singles position. No. 14 freshman Matt Bruch
upset N0.3 DeHeart,6-4,6-4. N0.24 Corkeryand
junior James Wan added straight-set defeats at
the third and fourth singles positions, with Wan's
6-2, 7-5 match clinching the win for the Card.
Muller then picked up a close three-setter at the
fifth singles spot, to out the match 5-2.
"The team's been doing really well," said
Corkery about his return to the lineup following
an undisclosed injury. "I'm not 100 percent yet
but I'm glad I can contribute."
"I think [Corkery] is playing pretty well, and
he's doing what he has to do to win matches,"
Coach John Whitlinger added."l'm really happy
with the way he's recovered, and how he's won
every match he's played. He hasn't played [the
third singles spot] in a long time, but he's playing
well down there."
Before the Illinois match, the Cardinal faced
Tblsa on Monday in its first dual match after a
two-week hiatus. Due to weather constraints, the
doubles matches were not played, but Stanford
still pulled off a 4-2 victory.
Corkery picked up the first win at the third
singles position with his 6-2,6-2 defeat of Ricar
do Soriano. Bruch scored the second point for
Stanford when he collected a 6-4,6-4 win over
Ricardo's brother, Federico Soriano. Pade was
the next match off the court, earning a win with
a score identical to Bruch's. Wan's 6-4,6-0 win at
the fourth singles position again clinched the
win against the Hurricanes.
"In a few [of the recent] matches, we've start
ed with singles and haven't been able to play
doubles, and that's been hard," Whitlinger said.
"The doubles is still a work in progress. I like the

combinations right now, but I think this week
end will be a big test for [the guys] and to see
where we're at."
This past Saturday, the team returned to
Taube Tennis Center to open conference play
and promptly shut out the Huskies (13-4. 1-2)
in a big way. The Cardinal collected all three
doubles matches with scores of 8-4,8-6 and 8-7
down the board. Corkery and Bruch teamed up
to take out No. 33 Daniel Chu and Alex Slovic
while Muller and Pade paired up and won a
close 8-6. Senior Jon Wong and Wan edged out
Washington in a tiebreaker to round out the
doubles.

Bruch then went on to defeat No. 32 Slovic
with a score of 6-4,6-4 and Corkery picked up
a 6-4,6-4 win against No. 90 Jean-Noel Insausti
at the third singles position. Pade. Wan. Muller
and sophomore Phil Kao all picked up straight
set wins at the second, fourth, fifth and sixth
positions to finish the clean sweep of the
Huskies.
"I thought the Washington match was very
good," Corkery said. "We beat them 7-0 without
losing a set, and we won all three doubles match
es. They're not a bad team at all. We lost to them

Then,on Sunday, the Cardinal de
feated Oregon (6-8,0-2) to go up 2-0
in conference play. Stanford's 5-1
victory was its fourth consecutive
win. Oregon's lone point came in a
three-setter at the top singles posi
tion. Bruch lost the initial set in a
tiebreaker, bounced back to pick up
the second but ultimately lost in the
supertiebreaker for the third. Pade
improved his record to 19-5 for the
season and Corkery to 20-3. Wan
continued to be undefeated at the
fourth singles spot, and Muller and
Kao won straight-set victories as

well.

The Cardinal now prepare to hit
the road in two tough Pac-10 matches
against its southern California coun
terparts. Stanford is scheduled to take
on No. 11 UCLA on Saturday and
Southern California on Sunday. In
February, Stanford earned two tight
4-3 victories against the Bruins and
the Trojans at home.
"They're always tough, especially
down [in southern California],"
Corkery said. "We managed to get
through to them last time without
Matt Bruch, who's a very good play
er. With him back in the lineup, we've
got to go down there expecting to get
two wins. I don't think we'll be happy

he's doing what he has to do to win matches,"
Coach John Whitlinger added."l'm really happy
with the way he's recovered, and how he's won
every match he's played. He hasn't played [the
third singles spot] in a long time, but he's playing
well down there."
Before the Illinois match, the Cardinal faced
Tblsa on Monday in its first dual match after a
two-week hiatus. Due to weather constraints, the
doubles matches were not played, but Stanford
still pulled off a 4-2 victory.
Corkery picked up the first win at the third
singles position with his 6-2,6-2 defeat of Ricar
do Soriano. Bruch scored the second point for
Stanford when he collected a 6-4,6-4 win over
Ricardo's brother, Federico Soriano. Pade was
the next match off the court, earning a win with
a score identical to Bruch's. Wan's 6-4,6-0 win at
the fourth singles position again clinched the
win against the Hurricanes.
"In a few [of the recent] matches, we've start
ed with singles and haven't been able to play
doubles, and that's been hard," Whitlinger said.
"The doubles is still a work in progress. I like the

combinations right now, but I think this week
end will be a big test for [the guys] and to see
where we're at."
This past Saturday, the team returned to
Taube Tennis Center to open conference play
and promptly shut out the Huskies (13-4. 1-2)
in a big way. The Cardinal collected all three
doubles matches with scores of 8-4,8-6 and 8-7
down the board. Corkery and Bruch teamed up
to take out No. 33 Daniel Chu and Alex Slovic
while Muller and Pade paired up and won a
close 8-6. Senior Jon Wong and Wan edged out
Washington in a tiebreaker to round out the
doubles.

Bruch then went on to defeat No. 32 Slovic
with a score of 6-4,6-4 and Corkery picked up
a 6-4,6-4 win against No. 90 Jean-Noel Insausti
at the third singles position. Pade. Wan. Muller
and sophomore Phil Kao all picked up straight
set wins at the second, fourth, fifth and sixth
positions to finish the clean sweep of the
Huskies.
"I thought the Washington match was very
good," Corkery said. "We beat them 7-0 without
losing a set, and we won all three doubles match
es. They're not a bad team at all. We lost to them

The Cardinal now prepare to hit
the road in two tough Pac-10 matches
against its southern California coun
terparts. Stanford is scheduled to take
on No. 11 UCLA on Saturday and
Southern California on Sunday. In
February, Stanford earned two tight
4-3 victories against the Bruins and
the Trojans at home.
"They're always tough, especially
down [in southern California],"
Corkery said. "We managed to get
through to them last time without
Matt Bruch, who's a very good play
er. With him back in the lineup, we've
got to go down there expecting to get
two wins. I don't think we'll be happy
with anything less."
