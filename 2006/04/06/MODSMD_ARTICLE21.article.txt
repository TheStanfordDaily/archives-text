# Barry Bonds Better Beware
## 
### 
Barry Bonds needs help. Not
psychological help, not legal
help, not even public rela
tions help, although all those things
should also be high on his agenda.
Right now though, Bonds might
need help just staying alive.
The season opener for the Giants
was a largely unremarkable affair,
as the Padres and ace Jake Peavy
shut down San Francisco's offense
6-I.The baseball-related action was
unremarkable, anyway.
As Bonds left the field following
the eighth inning, an object most
media outlets describe as a "sy
ringe" was thrown at the embattled
Giants slugger. In reality, it was
probably closer to a turkey baster, a
decidedly non-lethal object.
But turkey basters, it turns out,
are more ominous than any of us
would have believed.
The latest reports out of San
Diego are that the Padres' stadium
security confiscated several such
objects prior to the game. But one
made it through. And if a fan can
smuggle in any object that stadium
officials are on the lookout for, dan
gerous or not, there's the potential
for disaster.
Think about it. In the last 10
years of sports, is anyone more
hated than Bonds? T.O. and Pete
Rose come close, but I'd say that
right now at least. Bonds' alleged
steroid abuse, his assault on the
most hallowed of records in base
ball and his acerbic nature make
him Public Enemy No. 1 in the
sports world.
If any sort of serious fan versus
player violence occurs in the near
future, Bonds is clearly the most
likely target. And this prompted
civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson
to call for beefed-up security to pro
tect Bonds this season.
In an Associated Press report on
Tuesday, Jackson was quoted as say
ing that Bonds deserves more pro
tection than the average athlete be
cause of the media furor that has
surrounded him now for years. Jack
son was adamant that while Mon
day's incident in San Diego was ulti
mately harmless, it should under no
circumstances be taken lightly.
"That object could have had a
needle in it," Jackson said. "It could
have hit him. The commissioner of
baseball must be outspoken in pro
tecting any players whose lives are
in jeopardy, whose security is at
risk."
Baseball players are, arguably,
among the most vulnerable of ath
letes in America, with numerous
recent incidents of belligerent fans
charging the field. And given the
level of animosity toward Bonds,
coupled with his relatively isolated
position in left field, he may be the
most vulnerable of all baseball
players.
So this is where you expect Com
missioner Bud Selig to ride in on his
white horse, with a Stetson hat and
shiny badge to set things in order,
right? No such luck with this com
missioner.
"I guess none of this is unexpect
ed," said Selig in the same AP re
port.
Well, at least baseball has a
leader who's good at expecting
things. Unfortunately old Bud —
creator of the first, last and only tied
All-Star Game — has never been
one for action.
Rest assured that if the worst
should happen, and Bonds is seri
ously hurt. Selig will act. But it
might not just be additional security
guards, or more stringent check
points at stadium entrances. Bonds'
high profile would likely necessitate
something more, and baseball fans
might be looking forward to perma
nent, hockey-style Plexiglas barriers
between the stands and the field.
It might be the purist in me, but I
think that would be a serious blow
to baseball's image and appeal,
though maybe better than the alter
native of more player-fan violence.
Let's hope no one makes it to a
left field bleacher seat with any
thing more dangerous than a mock
syringe or rubber chicken. Because
if they do, baseball might never be
the same.
