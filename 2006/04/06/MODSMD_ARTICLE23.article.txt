## Cardinal claim Pac-10 Conference crown 
### JUSTINA GRAYMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Predictions were abruptly contra
dicted as 12-time Pac-10 Conference
champion UCLA surrendered its
title to the upstart Stanford women's
gymnastics team Saturday evening.
No. 8 Stanford scored a whopping
197.1 to decisively defeat six teams
and earn the team's third conference
crown since 2001.
No. 9 UCLA and Oregon State
trailed in third and fourth place with
scores of l%.Band 196.4, respective
ly-
Stanford sophomore Liz Tricase
won the bars title (9.925), continuing
her undefeated status on that appa
ratus this year. Sophomore Tabitha
Yim was fourth.
In vault, Tricase claimed second
(9.9) and Yim earned fourth.
But Tricase did not dwell on her
scores.
"After you see the score, you got
to get ready to move on, no matter
what it was." she said.
Following the bars and vault rota
tions, the team as a whole was unhap
py. They knew they could perform
better.
"It was the moment the light
switch went on," Coach Kristen
Smyth said.
On beam, sophomore Lauren El
more's 9.875 start spurred the squad
to a stellar 49.5. Yim (9.975) garnered
the beam title and senior Natalie
Foley claimed second.
Yim earned the all-around title
following her solid performances in
every event.
Other top performers were No. 16
Oregon State's Tasha Smith, who
won both vault and floor, and
UCLA's Kate Richardson, who was

runner-up in the all-around.
On Saturday, Stanford will host
the NCAA West Regionals for the
first time at Maples Pavilion. No. 16
Oregon State, No. 26 Boise State, No.
31 Sacramento State and No. 35 San
Jose State will be in attendance.
Alabama and Stanford are the fa
vorites to be the top two squads at
the Regionals and advance to the
NCAA championships.

No. 5 Alabama is the one team in
the bunch that Stanford has faced
but not defeated. The Crimson Tide
is the top seed at this regional and
features Ashley Miles, an eight-time
NCAA regional champion and
three-time NCAA champion.
"We've had more depth than
we've ever had." Smyth said "Any
thing can happen."
Also in contention for champion

honors — and likely tough competi
tion for Tricase —is former
Olympian and current Alabama
gymnast Terin Humphrey, who is
the defending national champion
and a 2004 Olympic silver medalist
on bars.
"The whole year this team has
achieved consistency, depth and
unity," Smyth said. "That's going to
be our fuel."
