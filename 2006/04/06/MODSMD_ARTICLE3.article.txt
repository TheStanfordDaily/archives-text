## Panel decries 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy 
### DAVID STEINHARDT 
Around 100 members of the Stan
ford community gathered at the Law
School yesterday afternoon for the
Call of Duty Tour. Hosted by OUT
LAW, a law student group, the Call of
Duty is a national college speaking
tour intended to spread awareness
and encourage debate about the U.S.
military's "Don't Ask, Don't Tell"
policy regarding homosexuals.
The event consisted of a panel of
five young veterans, all open mem
bers of the gay and lesbian communi
ty. The panelists spoke about their
experiences in the military, specifi
cally how they eventually revealed
their homosexuality to their col
leagues and superiors. The event met
positive reviews, as the majority of
the crowd expressed strong support
for the tour and its goals.
The "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" poli
cy — instituted in 1993 — states that
homosexuals are permitted to serve
in the military provided they do not
reveal their sexual orientation. Many
of yesterday's panelists pointed out
that this policy forced them to keep
secrets from friends, other members

of their units and superiors, as well as
psychologists, psychiatrists and chap
lains.
The policy was originally estab
lished as a compromise between the
total prohibition of homosexuals in
the military and President Bill Clin
ton's attempt to allow all people into
the military regardless of sexual ori
entation. As panelist Admiral Allen
Steinman explained, the policy was,
"based on the fear that open homo
sexuality would be detrimental to
unit morale, cohesion and combat
readiness."
Steinman and the other veterans
pointed out that almost all of the
United States' allies — including
Great Britain. Germany, France,
Canada and Israel — permit homo
sexuals in their militaries without
question. Furthermore, civilians with
jobs that require similar living cir
cumstances that are inherently dan
gerous, such as policemen and fire
men. are not discriminated against
on the basis of sexual orientation.
The panelists stressed the fact
that there are currently many gay
