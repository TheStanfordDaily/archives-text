## Panel decries 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy 
### DAVID STEINHARDT 
Around 100 members of the Stan
ford community gathered at the Law
School yesterday afternoon for the
Call of Duty Tour. Hosted by OUT
LAW, a law student group, the Call of
Duty is a national college speaking
tour intended to spread awareness
and encourage debate about the U.S.
military's "Don't Ask, Don't Tell"
policy regarding homosexuals.
The event consisted of a panel of
five young veterans, all open mem
bers of the gay and lesbian communi
ty. The panelists spoke about their
experiences in the military, specifi
cally how they eventually revealed
their homosexuality to their col
leagues and superiors. The event met
positive reviews, as the majority of
the crowd expressed strong support
for the tour and its goals.
The "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" poli
cy — instituted in 1993 — states that
homosexuals are permitted to serve
in the military provided they do not
reveal their sexual orientation. Many
of yesterday's panelists pointed out
that this policy forced them to keep
secrets from friends, other members

of their units and superiors, as well as
psychologists, psychiatrists and chap
lains.
The policy was originally estab
lished as a compromise between the
total prohibition of homosexuals in
the military and President Bill Clin
ton's attempt to allow all people into
the military regardless of sexual ori
entation. As panelist Admiral Allen
Steinman explained, the policy was,
"based on the fear that open homo
sexuality would be detrimental to
unit morale, cohesion and combat
readiness."
Steinman and the other veterans
pointed out that almost all of the
United States' allies — including
Great Britain. Germany, France,
Canada and Israel — permit homo
sexuals in their militaries without
question. Furthermore, civilians with
jobs that require similar living cir
cumstances that are inherently dan
gerous, such as policemen and fire
men. are not discriminated against
on the basis of sexual orientation.
The panelists stressed the fact
that there are currently many gay

members of the military that are "out" to
their unit and commanders and suffer no
negative repercussions. Army veteran Jar
rod Chlapowski was one of four panelists
who left the military voluntarily.
"There are 65,(XX) homosexual mem
bers of the military, and less than one per
cent of that number are discharged each
year," he said.
The panelists agreed that one of the
biggest problems with the "Don't Ask,
Don't Tell" policy is the difficulty that
gays and lesbians confront having to keep
secrets from their colleagues, who they
described as families.
"You don't keep secrets from your
family," Chlapowski said.
Julianne Song, the only female on the
panel and a former member of the U.S.
Marine Corps agreed.
"I wanted to be honest with my peers,"
she said.
Alex Nicholson, director of the tour
and the only member who was actually
discharged because he was an admitted
homosexual, explained that the discharge
process is far from fair.
"For the most part they don't have
problems, but we still have the law that if
you're found out, you can be kicked out,"
he said. "You can be discharged purely
based on suspicion or rumor."
Nicholson exemplifies not only the
civil rights case against the policy, but also
an argument regarding national security.
Fluent in five languages, including Arabic,
he pointed out that according to the 9/11

Commission Report, one of the major
U.S. national security failures was the lack
of Arabic speakers to translate messages.
"It's not about being gay or straight or
whatever, it's about wanting to help your
country," Song said.
The panelists answered questions from
the audience at the end of the event, and
the crowd expressed support for the vet
erans and their cause. One student spoke
out passionately against the policy, saying,
"let's call this what it is, it's homophobia."
Other members of the crowd thanked
the veterans for their efforts. Nicholson
responded that events such as the one put
on by OUTLAW yesterday are necessary.
"Instead of one project like this, I'd
like to see a hundred," he said. "Silence is
our enemy."
Polls state that 63 to 79 percent of peo
ple think the U.S. military should not dis
criminate against homosexuals. In polls of
individuals between the ages of 18 and 29
— the group that makes up 80 percent of
the military — 91 percent of respondents
said they would like to see the "Don't
Ask, Don't Tell" policy abolished.
OUTLAW, the group that sponsored
yesterday's event, is the Law School's
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Ttansgender
(LGBT) association. The group's presi
dent, Law student Michael Angelo, said
that he was very proud to host the event.
"We are hosting the 'Call To Duty'
Tour so as to engage the law school and
greater Stanford community in discussion
around 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell,'" he said.
"But we are also lobbying the Law School
and University administrators to come
out in support of our organization and all
LGBT students at Stanford."
