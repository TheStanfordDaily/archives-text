### ADAM WIDMAN STAFF WRITER 
A recent poll released by Stanford's Woods In
stitute for the Environment revealed that a major
ity of Americans think the environment is in poor
condition and will continue to decline in the future.
Fifty-five percent of respondents said they ex
pect the environment to be in worse shape within
the next five years, while Bft percent said they want
ed a great deal to be done to improve the state of

environment within the next year.
"One of the most exciting results from this sur
vey is that it shows clearly that Americans want ac
tion on environmental issues "said Jeffrey Koseff.
director of the Woods Institute and professor of
civil and environmental engineering.
The poll, conducted in collaboration with ABC
News and Time magazine, was published in a
March 21 report entitled."America's Report Card
on the Environment."
"The term 'report card' is used to refer to the
opportunity we are giving Americans to grade the
performance of government and businesses in
terms of how they have been managing the envi
ronment," said poll designer John Krosnick.a pro

fessor in political science and communication.
The survey, conducted by telephone from
March 14, gathered opinions from 1.002 individ
uals nationwide. The age, race, gender, level of ed
ucation, political affiliation and hometown of re
spondents were also recorded.
Krosnick designed the poll with ABC News'
Gary Lunger. In an email to The Daily, Krosnick
said he designed the poll "to give Americans the
opportunity to express their views about the envi
ronment and global warning."
In addition to examining public opinion on the
state of the environment, the poll also asked for
opinions on the role of public policy and busi
ness in environmental affairs.
In general, those surveyed disapproved of
current public policy on the environment. A ma
jority of respondents said they somewhat or
strongly disapprove of how President George
W. Bush has handled environmental issues. Sim
ilarly, a majority of respondents said they some
what or strongly disapproved of how Congress
has handled issues concerning the environment.
Barton Thompson, director of the Woods
Institute for the Environment and professor of
natural resources law, said that this data will
help businesses and policymakers respond to

environmental problems.
"Solving environmental challenges re
quires not only a strong knowledge of science
but an understanding of the public's percep
tions about the environment and potential so
lutions," he said. "Finding working solutions to
complex environmental issues will require that
we have credible, annual data on Americans'
attitudes to help inform our environmental ac
tivities at Stanford and those of the policymak
ers, non-profit organizations and businesses
with which we are collaborating."
Respondents also indicated that they would
like to see groups take action to improve the
environment within the next year. In three sep
arate questions, upwards of 70 percent of re
spondents said that they would like to see
American businesses, Bush, the American
public and Congress do"a great deal" or "a lot"
to "help improve the environment."

Krosnick said these results demonstrate that
the public would like to see the government and
businesses expand their efforts in this direction.
"The poll shows that Americans want govern
ment and American businesses to do much more
to protect the environment, much more than
they have been doing in the recent past." he said.
" Ibis call for action is accompanied by wide
spread support for specific ameliorative policies,
including making more electricity from wind
power and water power and seeing to it that com
panies make appliances and vehicles that use
electricity and gasoline more efficiently."
Finally, the poll reflected public opinion
about global warming and the magnitude to
which it is a serious problem in our society. 85
percent of respondents said they believe that
global warming is occurring, and 62 percent of
respondents labeled it as a "very serious" envi
ronmental problem.
