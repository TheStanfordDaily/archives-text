## GSC addresses elections 
### NICK PARKER DESK EDITOR 
The Graduate Student Council (GSC)
convened last night to discuss strategies
aimed at increasing graduate student turnout
in next week's ASSU elections, also hearing
from two ASSU Executive slates.
Before discussing possible ways to get out
the graduate student vote in the upcoming
ASSU elections, council members discussed
and voted on a bill that would have levied a $5
general fee on all graduate students; this fee
would then have been refunded to students
who vote in the annual spring elections. The
proposed bill also called for the excess money
collected via the fee to be distributed among
voting students in an effort to encourage
more graduate student participation. ■
Some council members raised eyebrows at
the bill, fearing that students might apatheti
cally select a candidate at random simply to
get their money back.
After amending the bill by taking out the
clause that would have redistributed the extra
money to voting students and adding a clause
that would pool that excess money into a get
out-the-vote fund, the council voted on the
bill. It failed unanimously, 0-10 with one ab
stention.
The GSC then brainstormed other meth
ods to encourage voting among graduate stu
dents. Members discussed a wide array of
ideas, ranging from a laptop giveaway to
coupons for'lhe 750 to broadcasting through
the Stanford Center for Professional Devel
opment or on the Stanford Cardinal Broad
casting Network (SCBN).

Next, council members heard from two
ASSU executive slates.
Heng with Graham, composed of presi
dential candidate Elizabeth Heng and vice
presidential candidate Lauren Graham, both
juniors, spoke first.
Heng said that the slate's mission revolves
around student life.
"For the last three years, both of us have
been very involved in student life and dealing
with the administration.'' she said. "We want
to take the knowledge we've learned and
apply it to improving student life now."
The two also discussed issues pertinent to
graduate students, such as the proposed GO
Pass transportation plan, health care subsidies
and The 750.
"We realize that as undergraduates we
may have a different perspective than you as
graduate students," Graham said. "But we are
completely committed to working with you
and supporting all your initiatives with you."
ASSU presidential candidate Marc Rillera
and running mate Chris Nguyen, also both
juniors, spoke next.
The two stressed their varying perspec
tives: Nguyen is the chair of the Undergradu
ate Senate, while Rillera has no ASSU experi
ence.
"Chris offers the ASSU experience, while I
ant offering the unique student perspective
that is not tainted by the ASSU," Rillera said.
The running mates also spoke about the
grad student issues they would address,specif
ically stipends, housing and diversity among
different departments.
"We've heard criticism that certain depart
ments in grad school are very homogenous, so

we will be working with admissions to try to
rectify that," Rillera said.
Ihe council also briefly discussed pro
posed amendments to the ASSU Constitution
that were rejected by the Undergraduate Sen
ate on Tuesday night and are, as a result, effec
tively dead for this year.
"The impression I got is that part of the
issue is that there was some confusion with all
the changes happening so quickly, so I think if
we go through with this next year and start
early we can get something through," said
GSC Co-chair Tom Lee, a fourth year doctor
al candidate in electrical engineering. "I re
main optimistic."
