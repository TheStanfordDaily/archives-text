# SAT scoring mistakes rattle college applicants
## College Board admits almost 5,000 tests scored wrong 
### LAURA CARWILE STAFF WRITER 
The College Board has gotten a bad
rap lately for botching almost 5,000
scores of the October 2005 edition of the
SAT. Many students who trusted that
their scores were correct found out,
months later, that they had been short
changed. While the number of students
affected represents less than 1 percent of
the over half-million teens who took the
test, the incorrect grades made national
news â€” as seniors all over the country
were told that the most important test of
their lives had been scored wrong.
According to The New York Times, in
a recent feature on the controversy, the
majority of students were affected nega
tively by the scoring errors. The College
Board said in a March 22 statement that
4.400 tests received grades that were too
low, while 613 students received scores
higher than those they had earned.
According to ITie Times, the scoring
problems were uncovered after two stu
dents requested hand-scored re-grades.
While these tests were reevaluated, it be
came apparent that there had been a
large-scale grading mistake.
After it acknowledged the grading
errors, the College Board asked Pear
son Educational Measurement, the
company in charge of grading many of
the exams, to rescore all of the October
tests.
Pearson initially reported that 4,000
tests had been graded incorrectly, but
then announced that not all the tests had
been graded for a second time. After
grading the 27.(XX) tests that had not
been fully evaluated, Pearson found an
additional 4(X) tests with grades that
were too low.
According to Pearson, the tests had
been scored incorrectly due to electron
ic scanning problems, mostly caused by
humidity.
Chiarra Coletti, vice president for
public affairs at the College Board, said
that college admissions officers and high

school counselors were notified through
an email alert before affected students
were informed. Students whose tests
were negatively affected by the scoring
errors had their grades changed, but stu
dents who benefited from the mistake
did not have their scores changed, ac
cording to an article in The Los Angeles
Times.
According to both newspapers, no
student has had their admission re
voked: however, with test scores up to
450 points off, there are obvious prob
lems that could arise if low scores are not
remedied soon.
One Stanford student, who spoke to
The Daily on the condition of anonymi
ty due to legal issues, had a similar prob
lem with his Medical College Admis
sions Test (MCAT) score.
"Part of my MCAT got misplaced,
and I ended up having to retake the en
tire thing," he said. "It takes months to
prepare for the MCAT; I basically ended
up wasting three or four months study
ing for a test that got lost.
"I know it's a rare incident, but there
needs to be a policy to address mistakes
with the testing agencies," he added.
"Students should not be responsible for
the mistakes of the testing service."
Anyone who has ever waited anx
iously for their SAT score can sympa
thize with the thousands of students af
fected by the College Board's mistake.
"I can imagine the problems that
come with finding out you got the wrong
score," Tess Garton, a junior, said of the
scoring errors. "You have to tell colleges
that you actually did better than you
originally reported. And while that's a
good thing, it is still an unnecessary has
sle."
Other students expressed sympathy
for the students who received higher
scores than they actually earned.
"I would be really upset if I found out
I had actually done worse than I
thought," Clea Alsip, a sophomore, told
The Daily. "What if you were one of the
students who was told, 'you actually got
a lower score?' It would be devastating.
"SATs are stressful enough," she
added. "I [cannot] imagine having to get
your score a second time."
