## Spring Break. A Break From What? 
### 
Last week was the most hallowed of
college holidays: spring break.
Thousands of co-eds flee south
like migratory birds for SoCal,
Mexico, Florida and the Caribbean. It
being my senior year, I figured I deserved
to join in this collegiate revelry and
booked a cruise to Mexico with a bunch of
friends. But midway through the week, I
was left wondering, from just what do we
think we deserve a break?
It was probably somewhere in the mid
dle of the fourth night of clubbing at the
same club to the same music with the same
people that, in addition to feeling a bit
bored, I began to feel sheepishly aware of
my hedonism. Just what is it that I do that
is so stressful, so all-consuming, so labor
intensive, that I deserve a week of party
ing, clubbing, sunning and drinking with a
bunch of my friends to recuperate?
Honestly, I can't think of much. Sure,
school is occasionally stressful. We've all
pulled the all-nighters and threatened to
jump off Hoover Tower if we get a bad
grade on a midterm. But honestly, I think
almost all of us have pretty peachy-keen
lives (I'll exempt engineering majors for
obvious reasons).
I was having a discussion with a friend
of mine during spring break that highlight
ed this very fact. We were talking about
our fathers, both of whom had passed
away during our college years. She noted
that she had written in her grad school ap
plications that having gone through the
death of her father, she no longer stresses
about school, because she knows what real
stress is. Indeed.
And when I think back on it, if anyone
deserved a "Girls Gone Wild" spring
break, it certainly wouldn't be my genera
tion — it would have been my father's. At
my age, he had already — get this — lied
about his age to get into the Navy (it was
his best career prospect at the time),
served in the South Pacific during World
War 11, got married, had the first of three
kids and worked days as a mechanic while
taking night classes at the local city college
under the GI Bill. I remember him saying
he felt like he was failing as a father, hus
band and student by trying to do all these
at once.
Did he go on a wild and crazy spring
break? No. He had real responsibilities
and real stress.
A generation later, I call my mom,
histrionic about how my week is so full of
classes, extra-curriculars and parties.
Where is my world's tiniest violin?
And that is what gets me the most: it
would be one thing if we Stanford stu
dents, locked in our ivory towers of intelli
gentsia, rarely surfaced for air (and a game
of beer-pong). But it seems every day I
hear about someone's plans to go wild and
crazy that night — even if it's a Tuesday. I
am certainly not unfamiliar with the five
in-five (five nights of partying consecu
tively, for you engineering majors).
In fact, I actually partied much "hard
er" during random nights last quarter (in
cluding, I'll admit it, during finals week)
than I did this spring break, which makes
me wonder if the "break" was instead from
the bacchanalian glories of Stanford.
The icing on the cake of glorious sin and
self-indulgence is that spring break is not
so much a break for many of us lucky sen
iors because we are done with classes and
instead doing "camp Stanford" spring
quarter of senior year. Rather, it was mere
ly the kickoff to eleven more weeks of de
bauchery, Monday-night partying and
guiltless afternoons in the sun.
I guess after working our butts off in
high school to get into college, then for
eleven straight quarters in college to make
ourselves eligible to firms and graduate
schools that will be our lives in a few short
weeks, maybe we do deserve a little bit of a
break. But it's worth remembering that as
hard as the life of a Stanford undergradu
ate may sometimes seem, it beats the hell
out of the other 99.99 percent of choices
out there.
