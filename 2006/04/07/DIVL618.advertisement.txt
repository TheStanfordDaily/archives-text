Methodology in Ethics:
Translating Theory into Practice JPWT
Are you thinking about writing an honor's thesis?
Have you ever considered what role (if any) empirical data should play in
normative claims and social decision-making?
Are you interested in Stanford's Ethics in Society program?
If so, consider taking Philosophy 77,
Methodology in Ethics:
Translating Theory into Practice.
Philosophy 77 is a research-focused, seminar-style class in which we examine
the following questions:
â€”What kinds of empirical data are relevant to social decision-making, and how
should they be collected, evaluated, and integrated into normative analysis?
-- What assumptions about human nature are in play?
-- How should diverse cultural values be addressed?
Philosophy 77 is a great opportunity for undergraduates to discuss these
questions (and others), explore the relationship between empirical research and
normative decision-making, and present the results of your own research in
a classroom of your peers.
