# DIRECTOR'S CUP
## Stanford lead in jeopardy UCLA, Texas closing in, but Card will still likely eke out 12th straight Cup 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
If there's one thing Stanford Athletics has come to count
on, it is the Director's Cup. For the past 11 years, the Univer
sity has beaten every other Division-I school to win the an
nual award for the best all-around performance in athletics.
Stanford football did not qualify for a bowl game and the
basketball team could not shoot its way into a bracket that
mattered, but the Card performs well in most other sports.
The Director's Cup counts the top-10 women's and top
-10 men's sports for each school, weighing the results upon
the size of each championship tournament. The prestige of
the sport does not enter into the equation: men's basketball
and women's crew count equally.
In the updated standings released yesterday by the Na
tional Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics
(NACDA), Stanford returned to the top spot. But while
Stanford has won the Cup handily in recent years, this year
is no sure shot. Stanford jumped from second to first since
March, but Texas closed from fourth to second.
The Longhorns and UCLA are within striking distance
and look strong in their spring sports. Major-sport success
has keyed both programs' runs, with Texas' football cham
pionship and UCLA's appearance in the basketball final.
The three schools will likely be in a tight race until the
championship season ends in June. But it is impossible to
predict how the 25 remaining NCAA tournaments will end.
"Stanford will do well, but it's too soon to project
whether they'll win again," Laurie Garrison, NACDA's as
sistant executive director of communication told The Daily.
Still, if Stanford's spring squads finish as well as they did
in 2005, the Card will most likely bring home a 12th Cup.
Last year, the Cardinal finished with 1,238 points, top
ping Texas by 164 points and UCLA by 171. Stanford placed
12 teams in the top 10 and won the national championships
in women's volleyball and women's tennis.These wins, com
bined with second-place finishes in men's water polo and
men's swimming, helped give Stanford the decisive victory.
But both Texas and UCLA are more than 100 points
closer to Stanford now than they were at this time last year.
Between last April and the end of the 2005 spring season,
Stanford extended its lead over Texas by about 10 points,
while UCLA outscored Stanford by 120 points.
In 2005, Stanford scored points in men's and women's
golf, tennis and gymnastics, as well as baseball and softball,
none of which has yet finished its 2006 season.
Stanford can count the better finish of outdoor and in
door track and field toward its total. The women finished
second indoors, but the men hope to improve upon a disap
pointing winter season. Both men's and women's crew are
seem better this year than last, and may also contribute.
Athletic Department spokesman Gary Migdol, though
careful not to predict ultimate victory, said that the winter
and spring teams are looking strong.
"We certainly expect to do well with the remaining
sports this winter and spring," he said. "Many of those pro
grams will finish in the top 10."
The national champion in most sports earns 1(K) points.
The values gradually decrease so that in a 64-team bracket
last-place is worth 10.Top finishers in sports with fewer than
25 percent of Div.-I schools competing — including gym
nastics and water polo— receive only half as many points.
Stanford has traditionally performed best in the winter
and spring seasons, but given Texas and UCLA's emer
gence, anything could happen in this horserace.
