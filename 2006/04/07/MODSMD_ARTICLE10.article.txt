### 
Shiok! A Taste
of Singapore
1 137 Chestnut St.
Menlo Park, CA 94309
(650)838-9448

As I strolled through Menlo Park in
search of dinner, a red awning caught
my eye and beckoned me down a side
street. However, 1 could not have dreamed
of the surprise that I happened upon: a self
ascribed "Taste of Singapore." I had never
eaten Singaporean cuisine before, so the mix
of Chinese and Indian food described on the
menu posted outside of Shiokl's door in
trigued me. 1 was already warming to the
idea of dining at Shiok! when two men en
tered the restaurant. They assured me that
they were returning customers and credible
judges, one of them was even from Singa
pore. The deal was sealed.
Shiokl's tranquil, attractive decor wel
comed me as I brushed through two maroon
curtains to enter the dining room. An artsy,
mellow remix of a Satie piece set the mood
amid the pillowed benches and paintings of
orchids and the Buddha.The friendly server,
who remained amiable throughout the din
ner, ushered me to a table next to a promi
nent sculpture of a bamboo plant.
Luckily for those with curious palates but
on a student budget, most of Shiokl's menu
items are tapas-style "small plates"—you're
meant to order two or three per person and
share them with others to make up a meal.
The small plates provide a fun way to sample
several of the items on Shiokl's diverse
menu. The restaurant also offers some en
tree-sized plates and larger noodle and rice
dishes.
I was impressed by the extensive bever
age offerings, which included juices, Singa
porean iced coffee and several different
teas. However, my enthusiasm waned when
I heard that their coconut juice was canned.
When I opted for lime juice ($2.00) instead,
it came fresh squeezed but very watered
down.The lack of flavor also greatly dimin
ished my enjoyment of the Char Kway
Teow ($8.50). Although the noodle dish
with chives, pork, and egg was not unpleas
ant, it was far too mild to make a lasting im
pression.
The Popia Sod ($6.00) —bean sprouts,
carrots, prawns and lettuce wrapped in fresh
rice paper—came with a strong molasses
based sauce and especially nice rice paper.
By far the best dish of the evening was the
Nonya Fish ($8.00), fried snapper that came
with a delicious sauce. The Sambal String
Beans ($6.00) provided a nice side vegetable.
The Pulot Hitam desert ($5.50) was enjoy
able once I mixed the very flavorful coconut
ice cream with the surrounding, almost fla
vorless gooey black rice porridge, but not
worth the cost. 1 missed out on the roti
paratha (a traditional dish of scrumptiously
gooey bread dipped in a curry sauce), but it
was popular at surrounding tables and seems
like a must-order.
While some of Shiokl's dishes are fantas
tic, others leave something to be desired, and
it's difficult to discern which ones are win
ners. The diners around me seemed to be
regulars who had figured out the perfect
combination to order. If you have some extra
cash lying around (you'll need it) and are
willing to take a gamble, Shiok! is worth a try
for its unique dishes and the chance that you
could select an all-star array.
