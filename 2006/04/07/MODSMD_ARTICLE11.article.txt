i"l*"B|h c wa y to Half M° on Bay—its twists and turns
with tea trees and silver myrtles, looking
JL| every bit like New Zealand—wends seaward
past artichoke farms, pumpkin fields and tiny wineries.
When you arrive, stop first downtown. Historic Main
Street brims with teacup-sized bakeries, bookshops, kitsch
and American flags. The Half Moon Bay Feed & Fuel Co.,
"voted best place in town to pick up chicks," has everything
a horse could desire, and local legend Skipper Ember, the
mare who won the 1985 Quarter-Horse World Champi
onships, is enshrined.
If you prefer wine to equine, browse the Half Moon Bay
Wine & Cheese grocer in the town s Ersatz Piazza. Anyone
who stops to sip can choose from a selection of bottles, or
an array of cheeses from garrotxa to chaubier and
bocheron, or the shocking pumpkin-colored mimolette-a
nutty and sharp cow's milk cheese aged two years.
TTien, survey the land for lunch options. You could have
wild mushroom bisque and a scallop salad at the Pasta
Moon- but it's the deli sandwich that rules this town and

you'd he remiss not to do as the Half Mooners do. The city's
official best sandwich, 10 years running, is a choice of
turkey, egg or hot pastrami on incomparable house-baked
wheat bread at the San Benito Hotel.
Or buy a cold blood orange on the side of the road (39
cents at Andrietto's) and suck it down in the stiff sea winds.
Cunha's Country Store, opposite City Hall, purveys all
manner of local produce and deli meats. Owner Bev Cunha
Ashcraft. a lifelong local whose snow-white hair has been
whipped into a regal meringue, will charm you into trying
her chicken salad. You will like said salad only if you real
ly, truly love mayonnaise, but it's hard not to agree when
she whispers the truth about Half Moon Bay: "It's a town
where people always got along well."
On the third Saturday of every month, the town holds a
coastal flower market, and in April, the tiny Half Moon
Bay airport showcases vintage automobiles at the Pacific
Coast Dream Machines car show. Heavy rains and a dam
aged runway have led event organizers to cancel this year's
exhibition, but it's not too late to catch the town's other

April attraction: hot cross buns. You can't swing a stick on
Main Street right now without hitting an iced raisin.
Half Moon Bay also beckons the athletic. Bike lanes
run between Main Street and the beaches, and Kelley
Avenue has a half-pipe and a driving range a stone's
throw from the ocean. Above the coastal plain, the Santa
Cruz mountains offer hiking and camping to the woodsy
and wild.
If purple kelp and elephant seals are more your speed,
drive to the coast.The Bay cradles four beach parks, a har
bor and Mavericks, the famous surf break at Pillar Point
where winter waves reach epic proportions. For the less
daring, the cliff-top trail will show you pods of humpback
whales swimming to and from Hawaii. You can also rent
kayaks at the nearby harbor.
After the beach, towel off in the coastal hamlet of Prince
ton-by-the-Sea and let your hair dry by the fire at the Half
Moon Bay Brewing Co. Their signature Mavericks Amber
Ale, a rich and robust pint, deserves a burger and a plate of
fries as the sun starts to sink into the sea.
