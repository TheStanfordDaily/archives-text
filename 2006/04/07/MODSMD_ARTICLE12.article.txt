# Checkin' out Chi-town: the second city on a shoestring

The term Spring Break is loaded. In
evitably, it stirs up images of Can
cun, Cabo and Key West, of glisten
ing azure beaches teeming with Swimsuit
Issue cover girls, and of Sisqo music videos.
But what about those of us who will never
be tan, blond, emollient beach bunnies?
Or those of us who spend 10 minutes in the

Belmont

sun and suddenly bear a striking resem
blance to Elmo from "Sesame Street?"
Never fear, my pasty-pated friends. You
may have been sun-burnt and out of place
this Spring Break but next year you can
head north for the spring. Here are just a
few of the many, many fabulous things
about Chicago. No sunblock required.

Belmont is the artsy neighborhood, the Haight-Ashbury of Chicago. Thrift stores abound,
seedy hole-in-the-wall establishments are the gold standard in retail, and every third person is vegan.
This makes for a great day on the town. Start with brunch at Orange, a delightful, juicily-colored
restaurant on North Clark Street famous for its "frushi" (fruit sushi), mix-and-match juices (pear
grape is an excellent combination) and green eggs and ham (don't worry, it's basil). Next, head out
for some retail therapy. There are some pricier clothing boutiques like Pink Frog and Tomato, which
are worth the money for some of the original, one-of-a-kind pieces, but the penniless pauper may
have more luck at Jive Monkey, a vintage store straight out of Yellow Submarine. It's luck of the draw
for the most part, but I managed to snag a gorgeous leather jacket for $ 11.

lYlillenium Park

The Art Institute

In the spring, when it's still
freezing and the outdoor concerts
haven't begun. Millennium Park's
main attraction is Cloud Gate, a 110-
ton, 27-foot-high sculpture made en
tirely of stainless steel. Designed by
British artist Anish Kapoor, Cloud
Gate is affectionately referred to as
"The Bean" due to its shape. The
Bean is polished on a regular basis so
that its surface is perfectly reflective;
the odd contours of the sculpture
make it into somewhat of a funhouse
mirror, so you can take pictures of
yourself in all of your warped splen
dor. The Crown Fountain has a simi
larly inventive charm. It consists of
two 50-foot towers with video
screens that show a running loop of
various faces. In the summer, when
the fountains are up and running, the
mouths spit water. How charming.

Just a few blocks down from
Millennium Park sits The Art Insti
tute of < Chicago. Built in 187 ( ) in the
aftermath of the Great Chicago fire,
it is both a school and a museum
with the mission to "cultivate and
extend the arts by appropriate
means." It is simply spectacular. The
last time I went, there was a special
exhibit on Toulouse-Lautrec. There
are also original Cezannes, Chagalls,
Dalis, Van Goghs...you name it. A
definite must-see.

The American Girl Place

IJmm, no. I didn't go in. They
wouldn't let me because I didn't
have my Samantha doll. The bas
tards.

The Lakefront in Evanston

This is a little out of the way if
you're staying in Chicago proper,
but SO worth it. The natives might
try to convince you it's an actual
beach, and while there is sand and
water, the lake is almost pathetically
calm despite the gale-force winds.
However, the spectacular view of
the city from across the water and
the serene sight of Northwestern's
sailing team out on the lake might
leave you breathless. It's also appar
ently a popular place for marriage
proposals, first kisses, and, er. doing
the deed on Valentine's Day. For a
different view of the lake, the Michi
gan Avenue Bridge, which crosses
the Chicago River, is also fun at
night, and the water is dyed green
every year for St. Patrick's Day.
Yeah Irish.
