## Editorial Heng and Graham set goals they can achieve 
### 
Elizabeth Heng and Lauren Graham
are the best executive slate choice for
Stanford students. They appear well
equipped to achieve the realistic goals they
have set out for themselves.
During our interviews with all three
slates, the Editorial Board found Heng and
Graham's modest plans underwhelming at
first. Many of their proposed programs are
designed to improve random aspects of cam
pus life, and would cater primarily to under
graduates. However, their goals also seem to
be the most reasonable given the short term
they would be in office.
For instance, Heng and Graham plan to
have the revamped Undergraduate Advis
ing Program assign two advisors to each in
coming freshman to create a more consoli
dated advising system. They also intend to
foster greater interaction between student
organizations, encouraging various groups
to stretch their limited funding resources by
hosting joint events.
If elected, Heng and Graham should be
held accountable for their more populist
campaign promises, including their pledge to
make Dead Week actually dead. And while
we're on the subject, the pair should also
make good on their promise to revive the
Mausoleum Party next year.
Heng and Graham both seem to be peo
ple who know how to throw a party. Togeth
er, they plan to reinvigorate the ailing Stan
ford social scene. In addition to the Mau
soleum Party, they plan to organize a Pool
Party and a Homecoming Block Party on the
Row. As student government veterans, the
duo brings a lot of experience in event plan
ning to the table, having coordinated many
large-scale events in the past.
We hope that Heng and Graham will
grow out of their image as party organizers
extraordinaire into a team that aspires to
greater things.
On some level, we wish that they had
made bolder campaign promises similar to
their opponents Marc Rillera and Chris
on a platform targeting
betfyurfuergraduates and graduate students,
Rillera and Nguyen put together a coherent
campaign centered around reducing the cost

of living at Stanford. Their strategy involves
reverting to a multi-priced dining plan for
undergraduates, and providing more
stipends and healthcare subsidies for gradu
ate students.
Generally, we are hesitant to punish a
slate for its ambition. However, Rillera and
Nguyen have made promises that would be
hard to keep. We do not see how they could
get the funding to put their plans into ac
tion. And even if they were implemented,
we doubt that these measures would signif
icantly reduce the costs that students have
to bear.
Case in point, consider their respective
proposals to address the lack of student
space. Rillera and Nguyen plan to divert
profits from Stanford Student Enterprises
away from the ASSU endowment to a fund
for building new facilities. In contrast, Heng
and Graham modestly — and more realisti
cally — propose increasing the level of stu
dent input in the plans for the second floor of
Tresidder Union once renovations at Old
Union are complete.
Our only advice to Heng and Graham is
to dispense with the aura of professionalism.
We know that the pair have a wealth of
ASSU experience, but they should be a little
careful about name-dropping or using
ASSU jargon when talking to their voters.
They need to remember that open commu
nication is key to their success as ASSU ex
ecutives, in spite of their prior experience
with the ASSU.
We believe that Heng and Graham have
set themselves modest and realistic goals
that they are likely to achieve;they shouldn't
feel compelled to hide their ability behind a
facade of showmanship.
