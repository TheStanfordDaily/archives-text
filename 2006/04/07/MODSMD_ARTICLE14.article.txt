# Mi Crown es su Crown

In last quarter's Dead Week issue of the
Daily, co-columnist Navin Sivanandam
accused me and dating guru Marie Can
nizzaro of engaging in "self-indulgence and
self-depreciation." His implication, of
course, is that we undermine our own abili
ties and talents.
Perhaps Mssr. Sivanandam is right. Al
though I'd like to think that my parents' $84
million investment in my Stanford educa
tion is increasing my net worth as a human
being, I can't help but feel that we all self-de
preciate a little. There are a few obvious
methods of self-depreciation: Joseph Mc-
Carthy chose booze. Rick James had his
coke and Michael Jackson had his nose jobs.
But we self-depreciate in subtler ways
too.There's the fatalistic notion that "birth is
the first step on the road to death," of course,
but that's cliche. Do I look like a Danielle
Steele novel?
One way in which we depreciate our
selves is through busyness. For those of you
who left campus over spring break, you
probably felt a palpable loss when your ac
cess to Apple Calendar and your Stanford
Planner was severed. You probably got more
sleep, spent more time at meals with family
and had fewer anxiety attacks. I, for one,
stopped biting my nails.
Busyness can distract you from those
fleeting moments of beauty that are too
often missed, like catching the Crystal
Springs Reservoir along the 280 at sunset.
Worse, busyness can make you grumpy and
irritable. Just look at Stanford Law stu
dents.
As undergraduates, we all know that
business school is a joke with a six-figure
punch line and med school a torture on par
with castration sans anesthesia. (The anes
thesiologists haven't passed their licensing
exams yet.) Law school lies somewhere in
between, but probably closer to the latter.
Imagine mixing together the people that sue
you for downloading music, prosecute you
for smoking marijuana and ensure that as
sault weapons are available in our cities.
Sounds like a fun bunch, doesn't it?

No wonder they throw hissy fits whenev
er they sniff out an undergrad in their midst:
"Fact: The majority students [sic] do not
HAVE to suffer undergrads in the library for
which they pay a premium and for which
they will pay to maintain and upgrade as
alumni donors."
The author of this poorly-written e-mail
had to remove his Facebook profile after his
whiny rant was forwarded to half the Uni
versity, so 1 can't send him a Facebook mes
sage. Instead, I'll have to use this column to
make my proposition: I'll stop using Crown
if you give up the Munger dorm, which is
being built for your benefit yet wakes me up
every morning at 8 a.m.
Law students are too busy and stressed to
keep the Big Picture in mind. Mired in con
tract law and torts, they go a little stir crazy
and start dreaming of what lies beneath San
dra Day O'Connor's robe. They convince
themselves that undergraduates are a grand
pestilence, banging bass drums up and down
their sacrosanct hallways, warranting exter
mination.
Take a moment, Mr. and Mrs. Law Stu
dent. Remind yourself of all the ills of the
world, and ask yourself whether having to
look a little harder for an empty seat once
every 11 weeks is really worth all the guffaw
ing and chest-pounding. You're already
among the chummy elite of the nation; you
can be happy now.
And yes, that final sentence was just an
excuse to use the word "chummy."
