# Rain, rain go away
## 
### 
I don't like the rain. I moved 6,(XK) miles to
get away from the rain. It really upsets me.
In fact, it's not just rain that 1 don't like, it's
being wet.
On the other hand, 1 do like sunshine. Vive
la sunshine! Also on the "like" list are heavy
drinking, sand and vacations.
When 1 was in college (or "at university,"
as we say back in the home country), my
friends and I pondered the spectacle of
Spring Break from afar.
It was an alien concept, a cultural phe
nomenon as mysterious as the shrunken
heads of the Amazon basin or the popularity
of American Idol.
Needless to say, it was with heady antici
pation that I awaited the chance to explore
this iconic wonder of an American college
experience first hand and report back to the
folks back in England.
Unfortunately, I'm well past the age at
which I could participate in the full MTV ex
perience and not collapse from exhaustion.
Plus, I feel uncomfortable around children
(which, on reflection, explains the perpetual
queasiness I feel around campus).
On the other hand, even without the infa
mous "younger females who are no longer
tame," Spring Break seemed like a good idea.
A few days somewhere bright and sunny ap
peared to be a perfect idea and a chance to
take a breather before the horror of Spring
quarter. So I went to Hawaii.

Now, while I'm not optimistic enough to
expect to enjoy myself ever again, I had
hoped that four days in the islands would at
least alleviate the misery a little. Hah.
Rumor had it that Hawaii was a tropical
paradise. An island of sunshine, of splendor.
An escape from the heady pace of modern
life, blah, blah, blah.
As far as I know, the above picture of
Hawaii may be correct. However, it wasn't
quite like that while we were there. Instead, it
was raining. A lot.
When I say "a lot," I really do mean "a
lot." The streets of Waikiki turned into gush
ing rivers at night. My waterproof hiking
boots still haven't dried out. And, as I men
tioned. I hate being wet.
TUrning up to a nightclub dripping is good
for a one liner; however, it's not so great for a
wild night out. The hippest clubs we found
were both in shopping malls. I suspect I
would have found this mildly depressing
even if I was dry and not painfully aware of

how ridiculous it feels bopping away at the
"18 and over" night.
Beachside drinking is one of the great
joys of island holidays in the sun. Rain,
though, puts somewhat of, hmmm... a
damper on that sort of thing. The delight
ful seashore-perched hotel bars rapidly
lose their appeal when you sit down in a
puddle.
In all fairness to Oahu, my friends and I
were not just there for the weather. No, we
were also planning to get some diving in.
That, at least, was mostly fun; though said fun
was somewhat tempered by the grumpy
wanker who ran the dive operation. But hey,
every silver-lining has a cloud.
Speaking of friends, one more mark in
favour of EE. The only thing that prevented
me from launching myself off the 16th floor
terrace of the in-the-process-of-being-re
modelled-let's-wake-everybody-up-at-8-
with-the-obnoxious-drilling sucky hotel was
the company.
Still, while sparkling company is all very
well, it's a little distressing to spend a grand
on four days of relaxation and come back a
little ball of tightly wound frustration.
Speaking of which, I need to go and pound
a wall now. Have a good weekend.

Have a better Spring Break than me? Feel free
