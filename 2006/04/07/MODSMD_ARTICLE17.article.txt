Admiral Steinman was not associated
with U.S. Navy
I was just handed a copy of your Apr. 6
edition and was directed to the lower left
hand column on the front page entitled
"Panel decries 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' poli
cy" and the picture of Retired United States
Public Health Service and Coast Guard Rear
Admiral Alan M. Steinman. The person who
handed me the article, a former serving Ma
rine Corps Officer, wanted to know why a
Navy Admiral was publicly supporting a
stance that was counter to current Depart
ment of Defense (DoD) policy. After read

ing the article and looking at the picture and
the caption. 1 fully understood this Marine
Officer's confusion.
As a currently serving US. Navy Officer
and the senior Navy Officer at the Hoover
Institution, 1 feel it is my duty to let you know
your article is causing confusion. I was per
plexed and disappointed because the article
did not accurately reflect the fact that Rear
Admiral Steinman was not associated with
the U.S. Navy, was not on active duty, was not
a full Admiral (four stars instead of two
which Rear Admiral Steinman retired as)
and in no way was a representative of the De
partment of Defense.

It seems to me this lack of precision will
lead others to assume Rear Admiral Stein
man could have been in the U.S. Navy and by
extension, due to his rank and implied asso
ciation with the active force, lend credibility
to beliefs espoused by the OUTLAW group
which run afoul of current DoD policy.

did not state that Admiral Steinman was affiliated with
the U.S. Navy. |
