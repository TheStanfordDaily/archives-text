## Don't mess with Missy Freshman hurler is no stranger to competition 
### ANDREW LOMELI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The fourth of 10 children. Missy Penna
knows what it's like to he part of a large
group. Growing up in Miami. Penna would
compete with her siblings for everything
— from attention to a nice place to sit in a
crowded room. When not in direct compe
tition with them, she would appreciate
their company while riding bikes or mere
ly talking.
Indeed, living with a large family re
quires patience, a competitive spirit and a
little give-and-take. Nothing else could
have prepared the breakout freshman
softbail pitcher better for a smooth adjust
ment to college play — and her new fami
ly of 14.
"It's hard for everyone at first to adapt,
but everyone has a role, especially with the
team being so small," Penna said.
In her first season on The Farm. Penna
leads the team with a 16-2 record after
pitching 118 innings and collecting 119
strikeouts. ITie newcomer has had similar
success in the batter's box, notching a .287
average with 18 RBI and a pair of home
runs.
"She's taken on a huge role on the team
as a freshman," Coach John Rittman said.
"She's pitched a lot of innings in big games
and big situations while hitting in the five
, six- or seven-hole all year long. Overall,
she's done an amazing job adjusting to col
lege and the [Pac-10]."
Penna began playing softbail at a young
age with her entire family, who played to
gether in a recreational league. While soft
ball was never necessarily her priority, she
honed her skills playing with leagues in
her home state of Florida. Impressed with
her talent, one of Penna's coaches contact
ed the Dominican national team suggest
ing she be invited to join the program. The
half-Cuban, half-European Penna said she

ended up joining the squad to have fun.
"It was a little weird and difficult at first
since I didn't really speak Spanish," Penna
said. "It was hard to talk to the other play
ers— especially with the catcher, who I
really needed to communicate with. After
a while, we kind of had our own communi
cation pattern."
Rittman attributes much of Penna's
success to her constant drive to improve.
"She's definitely a perfectionist,"
Rittman said. "She puts in the hours and
works extremely hard. She has a tremen
dous determination and work ethic."
Penna does not deny her on-the-field
intensity,but said pitching is the exception
to her normally relaxed lifestyle.
"I always want to do it right," Penna
said." I'm constantly trying to change, and
I'm open to suggestions, since that's how
I've gotten better. Some people say I'm a
perfectionist, though I am not the same
with everything else. I'm always going to
want to do better while pitching."
When she is not perfecting her throw,
Penna can often be found with a book, es
pecially Harry Potter and Christian fic
tion. And her interest in religion carries
onto the field as well.
"Religion is part of who I am," said
Penna, a Baptist. "It plays an important
part in everything I do, from academics to
softbail. It leads me to have a positive atti
tude every time I go out there to pitch."
Penna's positivity and focus have
helped the freshman keep her perspective.
Despite being roughed up this past week
end at No. 14 Washington and No. 3
UCLA, Penna remains optimistic and has
high hopes for the season.
"So far I've learned how exciting and
intense teams in the Pac-10 are," Penna
said. "It's the strongest conference in
softbail. so we have to be prepared for
every batter because any of them can hit
the ball over the fence. I'm not where I
want to be right now, and I've got a long
way to go. My goal is to come in and do
my job — pitch. And if we win, hopefully
I did my job."

She's definitely a
perfectionist. She has a
tremendous determination.
