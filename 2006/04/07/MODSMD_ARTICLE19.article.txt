## Card make Team Finals Stanford team makes the cut for the first time in three years 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
On the first day of the NCAA Champi
onships in Norman, Okla., No. 2 Stanford
men's gymnastics finished atop the standings
in their qualifying session with a cushion of
more than two points over No. 6 Penn State.
"It felt good," CoachThom Glielmi said in a
press conference following the session. "The
guys were trying to be very even keel with
today's competition. Our goal was to put four
good routines up and we did that on pretty
much every event except for pommel horse.
There is definitely room for improvement, but
our goal was to get through to tomorrow. Fin
ishing first in our session is fun."
All-around winner sophomore Sho
Nakamori won two individual events — floor
exercise and pommel horse — and junior
Peter Derman tied for first in the still rings to
lead the Cardinal effort. Ohio State claimed
the remaining three events — vault, parallel
bars and high bar.
Nakamori also finished third in the high bar,
while sophomore David Sender placed fourth
in the vault and all-around and sophomore
Jason Chen and senior Nate Downs finished
fourth in parallel bars and pommel horse, re
spectively, to push the Cardinal into the lead.
The Cardinal scored 215.900 in Session
One of the Championships to take control of

the six-team field. Penn State (213.450) No. 7
lowa (212.425) rounded out the top three.
Ohio State (211.700), Minnesota (206.950)
and William and Mary (202.025) also com
peted.
The top three teams from Session One will
take the floor tonight with the qualifiers from
Session Two: No. 1 Oklahoma, No. 4 Illinois
and No. 5 California. The defending national
champion Sooners have yet to lose a meet this
season.The Cardinal finished second to Okla
homa two weeks ago at the MPSF Champi
onships. Sender was Stanford's lone winner in
that meet, taking the vault title.
"Oklahoma is not the team to beat [at the
NCAA Championships]," Sender said after
that meet. "We are. And if we can just compete
against ourselves and have a solid meet over
all, we will win."
Joining the six qualifiers in the Team Finals
will be the top three individual performers in
each event whose teams did not advance. The
top ten finishers in each event in the Team Fi
nals (with no more than three from a single
school) will advance to the Individual Event
Finals on Saturday.
The Cardinal have already improved upon
their 2005 performance where a fourth-place
finish in the Qualifier kept them out of the
Team Finals. Sender was the only Stanford
gymnast to advance to the Individual Event
Finals where he finished 10th in parallel bars.
Stanford won three team titles in 1992,1993
and 1995. but has not returned to the top of the
podium since, missing the cut for the Team Fi
nals for the last two years.
