# TIME TO TRIUMPH
## After a 2-4 conference start, Card need the W's this weekend 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
Over the last few weeks, Stanford
baseball has probably spent just as
much time worrying about the weath
er as they have about their opponents'
pitching rotations and batting orders.
After being rained out three times
in the past week, the Cardinal (13-11,
2-4 Pac-10) are hoping to finally get
back onto the field this weekend when
they visit San Jose State (22-13, 3-3
WAC) Saturday at 1 p.m.
The Cardinal are looking to return
to their winning ways. After a strong
start to the season, the team has
dropped three consecutive series. Al
though they have not been swept,
Stanford is currently sitting at the bot
tom of the Pac-10 standings at 2-4.

After putting together a late-in
ning comeback to take the series opener this past weekend against
Southern .California, the Cardinal's luck seemed to be changing. But
the Stanford bats fell silent, and the team suffered a heartbreaking 3-2
extra-inning loss before falling 6-1 in the series rubber match.
After nearly a full week of rest from competition, the squad has fo
cused its attention on San Jose State. The Spartans are coming off a 3-
3 trip to the Aloha State that featured matchups against Hawaii and
Hawaii-Hilo. Junior leftfielder Ryan Angel,junior first baseman Bran
don Fromm and freshman Brian Chase key the Spartan offense, while
the team's pitching corps sports an impressive 3.54 combined ERA.
But while history seems to stack the odds in Stanford's favor (the
Cardinal lead the all-time series 77-30), unranked opponents have
given the Cardinal a lot of trouble this year. Stanford has gone 5-1
against nationally ranked teams, but only 8-10 against all others.
The key to success for the Cardinal seems to be consistent of
fense— after putting 11 runs on the board in their first 10 innings in the
USC series, the Cardinal were held to one run over the next 21.
The Stanford lineup features an offensively formidable left side of
the infield. Senior third baseman Chris Lewis and senior shortstop
Chris Minaker have hit at a combined .287 clip, producing seven home
runs and 43 RBI. Meanwhile, the young right side of the infield —
freshman Jason Castro, J.J. Jelmini. Cord Phelps and Brett Milleville —
have hit at only a .233 mark.
Following their contest against San Jose State, the Cardinal will play
Santa Clara and San Francisco before returning to Pac-10 action April
13-15 against Oregon State.

Senior shortstop Chris Minaker, No. 41 on Baseball America's list of 2006 Top College
Prospects, leads the team with 33 hits and 27 RBI. The next highest total on the team is 16.
