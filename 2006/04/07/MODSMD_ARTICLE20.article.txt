### CHRISTIAN TORRES STAFF WRITER 
Coming off highs and lows in its last two
tournaments, the men's golf team hopes to
crawl back up the standings this weekend at
Arizona State'sThunderbird Invitational.
At the Western Intercollegiate in Santa
Cruz. March 27-28. the Cardinal took second
(289-290-579), its highest finish of the year.
The Card fell only two strokes short of
champion Duke (286-293-577).
Sophomore Rob Grube secured the top
spot.scoring a two-under 68 and an even-par
70 in the two rounds of the rain-shortened
tournament. The finish was his second indi
vidual title and the first of 2(X)6. Grube was
especially happy with the victory after strug
gling through a sophomore slump.
"I improved my putting immensely this
week," he said. "I switched to a new putter
and worked on my technique. It's paid off."
The Cardinal had three finishers in the
top 20 — Grube, freshman Daniel Lim (143,
eighth) and junior Zack Miller (145,T14th).
The Cardinal had more trouble at the fol
lowing weekend's Morris Williams Intercol
legiate in Austin,Tex. The team finished tied
for 10th (885). Leading the men once again
was Grube. who tied for 25th (71 -75-72-218).
Miller and Grube agreed that the Morris
Williams field was stronger than any they
had previously faced. No. 2 Oklahoma State
(850,14-under) won the tourney, and the top
10 included five teams in the top 25 nation
ally. Stanford tied with No. 4 Georgia Tech.
"Once again, we were very competitive

with the best teams in the country," Miller
said."lt was our last nine holes of the tourna
ment that really made us fall so far back
from contention."
Indeed, Stanford had a strong first two
rounds,scoring 287 and 292, and was tied for
sixth after the first day. But, reminiscent of
difficulties in the fall season, the team had a
poor 306,19-over par. in the final round, with
four golfers scoring a six-over-par 78.
"It's hard to say why we all of a sudden
played as poorly as we did on our last nine
holes," Miller said. "I don't think fatigue was
the issue, other than the course just got
tougher and tougher as we got further into
the tournament."
This weekend, the Cardinal will play in
the ASU Thunderbird on the Karsten Golf
Course in Phoenix. They will again have the
chance to prove themselves against top
teams such as No. 21 Texas Tech. which also
competed in Austin.
"I think the team looks at Texas' tourna
ment as a positive, not a negative," Grube
said. "We were there after two rounds with
the best teams in the country. It'd be a differ
ent story if we weren't capable of playing
with them, but we are. Our only predicament
is figuring out how to sustain that level of
competitiveness for three rounds."
Stanford is also looking to sustain its mo
mentum from the spring season, with three
top-five finishes thus far. Grube and Miller
both have top-two finishes.
"It would be nice to play well and gain
momentum heading into the late part of our
season," Miller said.
