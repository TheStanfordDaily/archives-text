Junior Lauren lodd looked forward to
her homecoming tournament, competing
mere miles from her former high school.
However, the weekend ended not with tri
umph. but rather with a costly error.
The No. 20 Stanford women's golf team
traveled to Arizona PING/ASU Invitational,
looking for momentum as the postseason
nears.The team put forth a strong effort, hut
Todd's weekend ended with a whimper.
After completing her final round, Todd
signed for a 72 instead of her 73. Sshe was dis
qualified from the tournament, nullifying an
impressive 12th place finish in a strong field.
Freshman Ki-Shui Liao finished in a tie
for 21st to lead the Cardinal to a sixth-place
finish in the three-day tournament.
"Ki-Shui has been steadily improving all
year," Coach Caroline O'Connor said. "Her
ball striking was excellent."
No. 2 UCLA took the team title, shooting
a three-round total of 903 to edge No. 3 Ari
zona State by one stroke.
Taking individual honors was Adriana

Zwanck of Arizona. The freshman phenom
shot a career-best 68 in the final round to
overtake Texas A&M's Ashley Knoll.
Stanford junior Jennifer Tangtiphaiboon
tana carded a 230 to tie for 40th in the 16-
team field. Freshman Mari Chun and senior
Kelly Husted tied for 53rd with a three-day
total of 233. Competing as an individual,
Stephanie Lue placed 88th with a 247.
"It was definitely a good tournament for
us, but to say I am satisfied with the finish
would be selling this team short," said O'-
Connor, who continues to prepare the
squad for the upcoming Pac-10 Champi
onships.
The Card will get one more chance to fine
tune their games this weekend, as Stanford
hosts the annual Peg Barnard Collegiate,
April 8-9 at the Stanford Golf Course.
"This is a great opportunity to pull our
selves together before the Pac-10 tourna
ment and gain some confidence," said Todd.
The tournament marks the second time
this year that the women's team will enjoy
the friendly confines of their home course. In
October, they finished ninth at the Stanford
Pepsi Intercollegiate.
