## Baseball, but better 
### 
Snfffffff.... Do you smell that? It's
the most beautiful smell in the
world, that strange sweet mix of
grass, dirt, leather oil and sweat. It's
the smell of baseball, and as of Sun
day night (yeah, I don't get to write
until Friday, get off my back), Ameri
ca's pastime is back. Starting with the
Chicago White Sox's handling of
Cleveland, we're in for 2,430 exciting
matchups on the road to the playoffs.
Okay, so maybe you weren't re
ceived in a catcher's mitt like I was
when 1 was born. For some people,
the game of baseball is a snooze
cruise, and, to be honest, I can't say
that I blame them. You could make
popcorn in the time it takes for some
pitchers to get the next offering to the
plate. And honestly, the Royals/Devil
Rays series in late August is going to
be less well-attended than Jack
Bauer's anger management seminar.
I love baseball, but with games
lasting an average of more than three
hours and more scoring being done in
a convent, the game could use a shot
in the arm (easy Barry, easy). Keep
ing that in mind, I've come up with a
few suggestions that may help make
the game more fast-paced and inter
esting.
Pitchers
These guys are the main culprits.
Last year, Sports Center timed some
guy at over a minute-and-a-half be
tween pitches. Surgeries can take less
time than that. New rule: If you take
longer than 30 seconds before a pitch,
automatic ball. Longer than a minute,
you throw from second base.Think of
it as baseball's equivalent of delay of
game. Honestly, you've been throw
ing the baseball since you were four.
The grip hasn't changed. And that
guy on first base that you just looked
at? He's still there. Just pitch already.
Batters
Almost as guilty as the pitchers.
Calling time and stepping out of the
box four times a pitch is ridiculous.
And Nomar Garciaparra,you adjust
ed your batting gloves more times
than you swung a bat. Just sit there
and watch the pitcher! You get one
time per at-bat. Past that, automatic
strikes are given. So you can't strike
out if it keeps happening, the third
time allows the pitcher to throw di
rectly at you without any penalty. Let
it not be said that corporal punish
ment does not serve as a deterrent.
Managers
How many times do you need to
talk to the pitcher every' time a situa
tion arises? It's not like one out with
a man on second is a new thing. Until
you can legitimately say, "Well, crap,
I've never seen that one before. What
should we do with the bases loaded
and a mermaid flopping around in
short center?" these guys have been
playing long enough to know how to
deal with whatever happens. Unless
you're taking him out of the game,
keep your unpleasantly baseball
panted ass in the dugout. More than a
single visit to the mound with any
given pitcher results in the attach
ment of a leash from the dugout to
you that automatically pulls you back
to the bench.
Bonus Suggestions
Remember when you were little
and there were ten people in the
field? That's right: Bring back the
Rover! The kid who didn't really
have the skills to play a real position
and played somewhere around short,
second, and center. So put him back
in the gamewith some him new rights.
To some, the best parts are the home
plate collisions and the bench-clear
ing brawls. So let the Rover check
baserunners. Taking second base just
became a lot harder, and hugging
third on a steal is now a must, lest the
Rover pull you off and throw you out.
Finally, in between innings is one
of the most excruciatingly long peri
ods. Not only does it allow for the
Wave — the worst sports related ac
tivity of all time—but it makes me lis
ten yet again to the latest cross-pro
motional crap from Starbucks.
Here's the deal: Pitchers, throw one
of each pitch, and then we're under
way. Anything beyond that, and
you've got to rub Icy Hot on your
jock-strap to keep yourself warm.
In the end. baseball is still a great
game. Lots of people would still
rather induce a coma than watch a
game, and hey, it might take less time.
So for the sake of marketability, let's
crack down on these Johnny waste
timers. Play ball!
