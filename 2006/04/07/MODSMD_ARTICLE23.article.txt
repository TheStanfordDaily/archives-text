### DI DANG INTERMISSION BRICK-HEAD 
Q:How did you get involved with
"Brick?"
Joseph Gordon-Levitt: I read the script,
which is how you get involved with any
thing really. But when I read this script 1
was shocked, literally so surprised, be
cause people don't write scripts like this
anymore. Even if you read a good script,
it's good because you think it'll make a
good movie, whereas this script was good
to read just for the fun of it. It was such
beautiful writing. People don't use words
like this anymore, they don't put so much
effort or care into their words anymore.
The art is now usually in the look of the
movie,or the way it's going to be cut. And
I love the look of "Brick" and the way it's
cut and everything, but it all comes back
to these words he (Rian Johnson, the di
rector) wrote, that's at what the heart of
what makes this so outstanding, and as
soon as I was done reading it, I went back
to the beginning and read it again. I
haven't ever seen a script like that, and I
haven't seen one since.
Q: What determines if you take on a role?
JGL: I look to see if the character is in
spiring. If 1 get up and just start pacing
around the room and saying the words to
myself, then that's a good sign. Also, I be
lieved that he (Johnson) believed in what
he was doing. A lot of people, in any in
dustry, especially showbiz, will do what
they do for the money or to get attention
for themselves. For me, it's the script, and
who's doing it, and why they're doing it.
INTERMISSION: While promoting "10
Things I Hate About You" in 1999, you
had an interview with "Entertainment
Weekly." In response to what it was like
to work on the film, you said, "One of the
things I took away is how important it is to
leave home for college - to get away from
your old environment and reinvent your
self' In those seven years that have
passed, how have you changed? How
have you reinvented yourself?
JGL: That's funny - what I was refer
ring to was that summer that I went away
for two months to leave in Seattle away
from my parents. But, wow, that's funny.
I'm glad you brought that up. Then I went
back and leaved in my parents' house
again and did the same show ("Third
Rock from the Sun"] again for another
year. And it wasn't until the year after
that I did move away, I went to New York
and I went to school and quit acting for

two years. And everything did change. It
changed in that, I think when I was
younger and with my parents, most of
what 1 cared about was myself and my
friends. I thought that everyone else in
the world didn't have anything to do with
me, what did I have to do with them? But
once I moved out to New York on my
own, I got the sense that "Okay, I'm a part
of all this. I have a lot to do with every
body else, and everybody else has a lot to
do with me." I started asking, "Well how,
why? What do I have to do with every
body else? And what am I going to do
about that?" That's when I started really
wanting to act again. I did "Mysterious
Skin" and then I did "Brick." 1 wasn't
thinking just about what would be fun,
but I was also thinking of what is this
movie going to be in the world, what is it
going to mean to people? Because when I
was younger, anybody that saw anything
that I did, I didn't like that. I would get
very upset, very neurotically and irra
tionally. It would ruin my day. Now when
people recognize me, if they come up to
me and say something like,"l saw 'Myste
rious Skin'." I'm honored,genuinely hon
ored, that someone would spend a few
hours to watch it, because that movie
means a lot to me, I put a lot of myself into
it. And if it actually means something to
somebody else, then that's the whole
point. I wouldn't have realized that when
I was 17 years old, I'm saying in reference
to what you said I said. I'm glad that you
found that quote.
INT, Has acting gained significance
for you as an art form or does it carry an
agenda for you? Can you explain more
what importance acting has in your life
now?
JGL: Well, agenda seems so sinister.
But at the same time, I used to think that
it didn't matter what anybody thought,
that nothing much mattered at all, and
now I really do think that a lot of things do
matter. What am I going to do that could
possibly matter? That's a question any
human being would ask, right? There's so
many people, I'm just one person, so how
could anything I do matter? 1 think it's
some sort of leap of faith to think that
what you do does matter, whether it's
making a movie or cooking a good meal
or anything else. What matters to me
most always has been movies. And so to
be a part of that exchange where if some
one else who cares about movies sees
something that I did and it matters to
them, then wow, then something matters.
INT: Was there any particular event
or story that motivated this turning point.

anything that happened-to cause this
change?
JGL: I don't think it was one thing, I
think it was just moving away from home,
living in New York. . . I mean, walking
around in New York City, it's different,
well, I guess, in San Francisco, too, but in
any big city where you can just walk
around. Because where I grew up in LA,
you don't walk, you drive. And so you're
separate from every body. But when you
walk around, 1 just feel like a part of
everybody else. Like whatever is going on
with everybody else has a pretty big effect
on what is going on with me. Like I re
member, I grew up in Southern California
and I'd hear people talk about the weath
er, and I would just think it was the most
petty and irrelevant grasp for small talk. I
mean, who cares to talk about the weath
er? But then when I moved to New York,
I remember the first day of spring, my first
spring there, I was so happy because it's
freezing fucking cold in New York. And
then the first day you can take off these
clothes and feel the sun on you, I was so
happy. And I was walking around, and 1
realized that everyone else on the street
felt the same way! And all of a sudden, 1
was fascinated to talk about the weather
with people. Movies can be the same way.
If two people have seen a movie, that's
something to connect on. And that's the
whole point, right? To try and connect
these people. Does that make any sense?
Q:"10 Things I Hate About You" and
"Brick" are both set in high school, yet
very different. The drama and stereo
types in "10 Things" are way overblown,
but the movie still depicts life-like situa
tions. Yet I have the feeling that it is much
easier to relate to "Brick" than it is "10
Things." Can you comment on this?
JGL: I think you're absolutely right. I
think that a lot of movies about high
school nowadays are made by people
looking back in hindsight at their high
school days going, "Ha ha ha, we were all
pretty silly, weren't we?" And so they
make these movies that are light and silly
and fun. There's nothing wrong with
them, but that wasn't what high school
was like for me. High school, for me, was
really serious. If the girl I liked didn't like
me, that was like dying. All the politics of
who was friends with whom, and who ate
lunch where, that wasn't flippant, even
though we can now look back on it and
say like, "Oh, we made a big deal out of
nothing." Back then, it was really serious,
and that's what "Brick" is about. "Brick"
isn't about how high school is, but how it
feels.

Q:How did you get involved with

Joseph Gordon-Levitt: I read the script,

mean, who cares to talk about the weath
er? But then when I moved to New York,
I remember the first day of spring, my first
spring there, I was so happy because it's
freezing fucking cold in New York. And
then the first day you can take off these
clothes and feel the sun on you, I was so
happy. And I was walking around, and 1
realized that everyone else on the street
felt the same way! And all of a sudden, 1
was fascinated to talk about the weather
with people. Movies can be the same way.
If two people have seen a movie, that's
something to connect on. And that's the
whole point, right? To try and connect
these people. Does that make any sense?
Q:"10 Things I Hate About You" and
"Brick" are both set in high school, yet
very different. The drama and stereo
types in "10 Things" are way overblown,
but the movie still depicts life-like situa
tions. Yet I have the feeling that it is much
easier to relate to "Brick" than it is "10
Things." Can you comment on this?
JGL: I think you're absolutely right. I
think that a lot of movies about high
school nowadays are made by people
looking back in hindsight at their high
school days going, "Ha ha ha, we were all
pretty silly, weren't we?" And so they
make these movies that are light and silly
and fun. There's nothing wrong with
them, but that wasn't what high school
was like for me. High school, for me, was
really serious. If the girl I liked didn't like
me, that was like dying. All the politics of
who was friends with whom, and who ate
lunch where, that wasn't flippant, even
though we can now look back on it and
say like, "Oh, we made a big deal out of
nothing." Back then, it was really serious,
and that's what "Brick" is about. "Brick"
isn't about how high school is, but how it
feels.

Q:How did you get involved with
"Brick?"
Joseph Gordon-Levitt: I read the script,
which is how you get involved with any
thing really. But when I read this script 1
was shocked, literally so surprised, be
cause people don't write scripts like this
anymore. Even if you read a good script,
it's good because you think it'll make a
good movie, whereas this script was good
to read just for the fun of it. It was such
beautiful writing. People don't use words
like this anymore, they don't put so much
effort or care into their words anymore.
The art is now usually in the look of the
movie,or the way it's going to be cut. And
I love the look of "Brick" and the way it's
cut and everything, but it all comes back
to these words he (Rian Johnson, the di
rector) wrote, that's at what the heart of
what makes this so outstanding, and as
soon as I was done reading it, I went back
to the beginning and read it again. I
haven't ever seen a script like that, and I
haven't seen one since.
Q: What determines if you take on a role?
JGL: I look to see if the character is in
spiring. If 1 get up and just start pacing
around the room and saying the words to
myself, then that's a good sign. Also, I be
lieved that he (Johnson) believed in what
he was doing. A lot of people, in any in
dustry, especially showbiz, will do what
they do for the money or to get attention
for themselves. For me, it's the script, and
who's doing it, and why they're doing it.
INTERMISSION: While promoting "10
Things I Hate About You" in 1999, you
had an interview with "Entertainment
Weekly." In response to what it was like
to work on the film, you said, "One of the
things I took away is how important it is to
leave home for college - to get away from
your old environment and reinvent your
self' In those seven years that have
passed, how have you changed? How
have you reinvented yourself?
JGL: That's funny - what I was refer
ring to was that summer that I went away
for two months to leave in Seattle away
from my parents. But, wow, that's funny.
I'm glad you brought that up. Then I went
back and leaved in my parents' house
again and did the same show ("Third
Rock from the Sun"] again for another
year. And it wasn't until the year after
that I did move away, I went to New York
and I went to school and quit acting for

two years. And everything did change. It
changed in that, I think when I was
younger and with my parents, most of
what 1 cared about was myself and my
friends. I thought that everyone else in
the world didn't have anything to do with
me, what did I have to do with them? But
once I moved out to New York on my
own, I got the sense that "Okay, I'm a part
of all this. I have a lot to do with every
body else, and everybody else has a lot to
do with me." I started asking, "Well how,
why? What do I have to do with every
body else? And what am I going to do
about that?" That's when I started really
wanting to act again. I did "Mysterious
Skin" and then I did "Brick." 1 wasn't
thinking just about what would be fun,
but I was also thinking of what is this
movie going to be in the world, what is it
going to mean to people? Because when I
was younger, anybody that saw anything
that I did, I didn't like that. I would get
very upset, very neurotically and irra
tionally. It would ruin my day. Now when
people recognize me, if they come up to
me and say something like,"l saw 'Myste
rious Skin'." I'm honored,genuinely hon
ored, that someone would spend a few
hours to watch it, because that movie
means a lot to me, I put a lot of myself into
it. And if it actually means something to
somebody else, then that's the whole
point. I wouldn't have realized that when
I was 17 years old, I'm saying in reference
to what you said I said. I'm glad that you
found that quote.
INT, Has acting gained significance
for you as an art form or does it carry an
agenda for you? Can you explain more
what importance acting has in your life
now?
JGL: Well, agenda seems so sinister.
But at the same time, I used to think that
it didn't matter what anybody thought,
that nothing much mattered at all, and
now I really do think that a lot of things do
matter. What am I going to do that could
possibly matter? That's a question any
human being would ask, right? There's so
many people, I'm just one person, so how
could anything I do matter? 1 think it's
some sort of leap of faith to think that
what you do does matter, whether it's
making a movie or cooking a good meal
or anything else. What matters to me
most always has been movies. And so to
be a part of that exchange where if some
one else who cares about movies sees
something that I did and it matters to
them, then wow, then something matters.
INT: Was there any particular event
or story that motivated this turning point.

anything that happened-to cause this
change?
JGL: I don't think it was one thing, I
think it was just moving away from home,
living in New York. . . I mean, walking
around in New York City, it's different,
well, I guess, in San Francisco, too, but in
any big city where you can just walk
around. Because where I grew up in LA,
you don't walk, you drive. And so you're
separate from every body. But when you
walk around, 1 just feel like a part of
everybody else. Like whatever is going on
with everybody else has a pretty big effect
on what is going on with me. Like I re
member, I grew up in Southern California
and I'd hear people talk about the weath
er, and I would just think it was the most
petty and irrelevant grasp for small talk. I
mean, who cares to talk about the weath
er? But then when I moved to New York,
I remember the first day of spring, my first
spring there, I was so happy because it's
freezing fucking cold in New York. And
