# NOT YOUR AVERAGE SWANS
## 
### MERRITT FOREST BAER INTERMISSION SWAN SCOUT 
Dark. Edgy. Sadistic. Passionate. Erot
ic I hese are not words we typically asso
! Ie with ballet. However, along with the
words "brilliant," "masterpiece" and
"< pic," they are among the few words ad-

•jtiate to describe
the breathtaking
production of
»latthew Bourne's
>wan Lake" cur
ntly playing at
> m Francisco's
t i pheum Theatre.
A complete
(interpretation of
.lie famous
Tchaikovsky bal
lct, Bourne's pro
luction trades in

he classical beautiful ballerinas in tutus
for a group of aggressive, bare-chested,
p >werful male swans The inversion is
o'ie of the many stark contrasts that
B< iume brings to his production, which
; ice its British debut a decade ago, has
1 1 come the longest-running ballet of all
time. Needless to say, its popularity Is for
reason. Taking home the Tony
Awards for Best Direction, Best Chore
"jjaphy and Best Costumes for its
bu xidway production, this "Swan Lake"
tr groundbreaking in almost every way.
From the opening moments of this vi
sual tour de force, we quickly learn that
I fume's ballet is far more grounded in
theater than it is in dance. Don't get me
w < ong: this is definitely a dance piece —
t here are no words spoken. However, the
piece draws on ballet, contemporary
c! tnce, jazz, social dance, comedy and
mime, referencing everything from pop
ci tllure to characters from the 19th Cen
u ty era and films. The focus is on the
< notional narrative, not the cold tech

nique that many ballets seem to covet.
The performers truly deliver the
goods. Led by Alan Vincent as the seduc
tive and electric Swan, the cast performs
with an unparalleled energy. Though the
technique of individual dancers may be
debated, the overall effect is superb.
When the Swan reappears as the

Stranger in the sec
ond half. Vincent
fills the role with a
gripping charisma,
exuding sexuality
andconfidence.with
seeming ease. In
fact, the entire cast
makes the dancing
look effortless.
Only once
you realize that the
bare-chested swans
are glistening in the

moonlight,covered in sweat,do you even
consider the strength iind endurance nec
essary for such an acrobatic piece. There
are moments of sloppiness, and this
group doesn't achieve perfection in pre-

cision. However, this
isn't American Ballet
Theatre (ABT) and
the goal is not to cre
ate cold, stark, perfect
dancing. kather,it is to
bring the audience on
a journey and. in this
arena, the production
soars.
While the original
ballet tells the story of
a beautiful princess
trapped under a mag
ical spell. Bourne's

"Swan" is a creation of the Prince's imag
ination. Both comradery and homoeroti
cism are at play, as the weak Prince sees
the Swan as a symbol of freedom, spon
taneity and strength (sexual or other-

wise). As a child fascinated by swans, the
pampered Prince is unsuited to the royal
lifestyle, and consistently confuses reality
and fantasy.The Swan (and the Stranger)
are presented from the Prince's perspec
tive. torn between desire and escapism.
Bourne transforms the piece from a
beautiful fairytale into a tragic battle of
the Prince's inner torment.
While the narrative is immensely
powerful, they are well aided bv the ex
ceptional ase of costumes and lighting.
Lez Brotherston's costumes are beauti
ful, yet provocative. From dressing the
male swijqs only in feathered shorts and
giving the Queen a sumptuous royal pur
ple gown to choosing modem black and
white fashion for the Prince's Ball. Broth
erston also references various eras with
subtle allusions to create three-dimen
sional characters Rick Fisher's superla
tive lighting creates a beautiful aesthetic,
often helping blur the lines between fan
tasy and reality. He elicits a gasp-inducing
coup de theatre at the Prince's Ball, at the
thrilling moment when the Prince and
the Stranger begin an aggressive and in-

nuendo-filled dance. Need
less to say, the entire piece is
a visual marathon.
Few theatrical re
vivals successfully challenge
our preconce i ved notions of
their predecessors. One
striking example would be
Sam Mendes' critically-ac
claimed Cabaret (this year's
Ram's Head Spring Musi
cal), which re-imagined the
decadent German night
club into a seedy strip bar.
So too does Bourne's

"Swan Lake," which gives the famed
Russian ballet new meaning, allowing
modern audiences an opportunity to
connect with the piece both viscerally
and artistically.
