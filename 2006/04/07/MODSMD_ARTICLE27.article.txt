# THE
						X-RATED DISNEYWORLD: VEGAS

Las Vegas these days is like Disney World (Epcot included)
but with more strippers. If you don't consider Ariel a stripper,
your bust-size radar is whack and you've forgotten that the
leggy and nubile Ariel washes ashore buck-naked in front of
the lustful Eric. Here's some reasons it should be called "Walt
Vegas."
Look at some of the facts. One word: monorail-There is a
monorail in Las Vegas. This comparison should be obvious,
and if it's not, stop smoking so much of the pot.
Four more words: The Thunder Down Under. Nemo and
the gang have nothing on this elite male strip club. And as you
walk down Las Vegas Boulevard, you can expect underage,
underpaid and (il)legal immigrants to throw fliers for strip
pers, male and female, into your eager hands. Much like you
can expect costumed trolley riders to throw joy at you as you
walk down Main Street U.S.A.

Under 21? Not a prob-

lem at all. Like Dis-

ney. the

swingin' town of Vegas is made for you! If you like 10 gamble,
they won't card you. If you like to drink, they won': card you.
Writer's note: When I say they won't card "you," I really mean
they won't card "me." A piece of advice. Bring voui fath rand
manfriend with you and the "po" will be less suspiciui> that
you're only twenty. By "po" I mean police and by "pqijee." I
mean the cast of the Thunder Down Under in police ccMume.
As a toddler, I screamed in horror at the Difeoey V,oild

characters in those scary so-called mouse suits.

Fear of people wearing animal costumes is sup-

posedly a sign of intelligence, so I'm sure many

of you can identify. Impersonators of Elvis

Presley, Frank Sinatra, and Neil Dia
mond, the Jewish Elvis Presley, want to h

take their picture with you like
Minnie did when you were
three. And it's just as scary.

There's a roller coaster in the

middle of Las Vegas Boulevard. Think
about it. Awesome.

If you go to Las Vegas, don't go because it's like D'n
ney World. That gets depressing. Go because it's closer S
than New York.There are now many fantastic shows, ircm k
Broadway and elsewhere, which play on the strip, h'tcn 5

John and his red piano are there — and are hot. S<> <s H
