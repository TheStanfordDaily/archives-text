## You're "Lucky" if you don't have to see this 
### RYAN LAMPE INTERMISSION GUN SLINGER 
Midway through "Lucky Number Slevin,"
I ucy Liu's character remarks "we're dealing

with a case of bona fide mistaken
identity. Things like that aren't sup
i vised to be real." And of course
ihey're not. Reality takes a back
scat in this picture. Not because it
n to. But because writer Jason
Smilovic believes that ignoring real
ity is a good way to misdirect an au
dience. One can only wonder what
" fhe Usual Suspects" director
Bryan Singer might have done with
litis film's material.

"Lucky Number Slevin" opens with a series
of brutal murders before introducing us to
Slevin (Josh Hartnett), a man who manages to
lose his job, catch his girlfriend in bed with an
other man, and get mugged all on the same day.
liking refuge in a friend's New York apart
ment, he is soon mistaken for its owner by rival
crime bosses (Ben Kingsley and Morgan Free
man) and forced to assist in an assassination.
While plotting the murder, Slevin rubs shoul
ders with a relentless detective (Stanley TUcci)
r>nd finds time to fall in-love with an inquisitive

neighbor (Lucy Liu).
Director Paul McGuigan and the film's
producers have certainly assembled an im- 1
pressive cast. Unfortunately, the film's

characters are frustrating- ,

names like "The Boss" S

hackneyed at best. Playing
a shadowy assassin, Bruce

rector on "Wicker Park") is

' not possess the charisma or
comic timing demanded by
much of the script.

Perhaps what is most disap-

pointing about "Lucky

Number Slevin" is its

opening act. While

the film's final

act is darkly

serious, its

first half seems focused on a series of bizarre
confrontations that make little sense because
they involve characters saying and doing things
that real people wouldn't say or do. Consider
the character of Slevin. Despite having his life
threatened on countless occasions, he seems
perfectly comfortable making the kind of glib
retorts that one might expect from Vin Diesel's
character in "xXx." Similarly, Liu's character
has no trouble instantly flirting with a half
naked stranger she meets in her neighbor's
apartment.
Oddly, in spite of her character's erratic be
havior, Liu actually manages to turn in the
film's most engaging performance. As Slevin's
love-interest, she is so charming and lively that
we almost forget we've already seen her play
this role in two "Charlie's Angels" movies.
"Lucky Number Slevin" ends with the kind
of overlapping twists that befit films of its
genre: with each twist, we learn crucial infor
mation that changes our impressions of the
lead characters. Some of the revelations are in
teresting while some of them are completely
unnecessary. The film's final reel is certainly
stronger than anything preceding it. Neverthe
less, by the time it rolls around, it's hard to care
about characters this cliched and implausible.
