## This ballroom Isn't "Hot, Hot" but Banderas is 
### NATASHA CHEN INTERMISSION FORBIDDEN DANCER 
"Take the Lead" begins with a
fast-paced, entertaining sequence,
cutting between the slums where our
beloved juvenile delinquent
character is getting dressed for thiT
school dance, and a nicer neighbor
hood of New York # where the
smooth, talented Pierre Dulaine pre-*
pares to go to a fancy ballroom
dance gala.The salsa and the jazz are

remixed with hip hop
beats, setting the tone
for one of the movie's
motifs —juxtaposing
the poor with the priv
ileged, the dirty danc
ing with the graceful
gliding.
Dulaine, played by
Antonio Banderas, is
an internationally ac
claimed ballroom

of teens serving detention at an
inner city high school. Some of the
favorite delinquents are Rock (Rob
Brown) and Laßhette (Yaya Da-
Costa), whose respective siblings
killed each other in a gang brawl.
There's also the white guy who
thinks he's black, a love triangle in
volving a couple of bad-ass know-it
alls and the white girl from Du
laine's dance studio who would
rather spend her time with the rest
of these kids instead of hanging out
with her cotillion bunch.

'Take the Lead'
Dir. Liz Friedlander

dancer who volunteers his time
teaching his craft to an unruly group

In other
words, it's a
glitzy,
dressed up
twist of the
d o | u m e ii
tary "M;id
Hot Ball
room , "
which fol
lowed a
bunch of el-

ementary school kids on their jour
ney to the inter-district ballroom

competition (and, not surprisingly,
was more successful at delivering a
realistic, emotional story).
The trailers might say that it's in
spired by a true story but of course,
anything with Antonio Banderas
mentoring teens (some oft which
border caricatures) cannot be called
a documentary. We've probably ]
seen plenty of movies where the I
misunderstood, underprivileged i
children get a shot at turning their
lives around by beating the rich
snobs at their own game. Working
around many of those prob
lems. it manages to deliver a number
of genuine moments that makes it
worth sitting through the 10K min
utes.
The best parts of "Take thelLead"
are the surprises. No, the surprises
are not going to come from the plot
— you can probably already guess
rwhat happens to the juvenile delin
quent with a big heart who hates to
dance — but there are a number of
funny lines from scriptwriter Dianne
Houston. Iliese lines are delivered

by some rookie actors guided by
some of the star presences like Ban
deras and Alfre Woodard, who plays
the principal. ITie most surprising
performance came from Yayp Da-
Costa, who plays Laßhette, a Tough,
but good-hearted, academically-dili
gent daughter of a prostitute. But
maybe I'm only impressed by the
subtle tear she shed because,the last
time I saw her Onscreen was in

"Not only were the speeches a bit

H|evably quickly for rebels of the
HP, his fellow dance teacher at the
studio switches to his sipe all of a
sullden without the audience's no
tice and the parents only need a ten
mmute meetirtg. On top of that, the
sttjklents become star dahcers in an
indescribably short amount of time.
What works in the movie's favor
is that the students are already great
hip hop dancers who essentially just

need a little push in the fox trot di
rection. The writer therefore de
serves at least a passing grade. The
acting is also decent across the
board, save for personalities like the
over-acted, snooty character Mor
gan, professionally trained princess
of the dance floor, who can be forgiv
en because of one "sex-ori-Kaftl
wood" dance sequence with Ban
deras that will just make you stop
breathing.
Of course you'll get some sort of
form for this genre of
s movies, just like ajiy other genre. But
it doesn't feel too formulaic. There
are enough distractions and smart
lines to keep you laughing from be
ginning to end (much like the adults
and their children at the screening),
and enough characters to invest in to
make the final showdown something
to anticipate. As the lady sitting next
to me whispered before the credits
rolled, "this makes me want to
dance". Exactly. Cheesy moments or
not, it's a whole lot of fun.
