## Forecast: Beavers, Ducks and rain 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
Beavers and Ducks are aqutfic animals, so the
Softball teams from Oregon and Oregon State
should feel right at home in northern California.
After having a non-conference douhleheader
with Fresno State rained out. No. 8 Stanford (27-
6,1-2 Pac-10) will take the field Friday against No.
6 OSU (29-3,2-1) and play two with Oregon (17-
12,0-2) and Saturday and Sunday.
"Any time that you need to cancel a game be
cause of weather and can't make it up is discour
aging, but the fields were pretty bad," Coach John
Rittman said. " Iliis has been one of the worst
springs we have ever had and the last thing you
want to do is go out and put your players at risk.
It's disappointing, but there are bigger concerns."
T"he unusually long rainy season has made it
hard for the Cardinal to prepare for the grueling
Pac-10 season, but they are doing what they can.
"We have had very limited practice in the last
three weeks," Rittman said.,"Since Dead Week,
had one legitimate practice where

some live situations, but it has been hard. At this
point, the field is definitely saturated."
Despite the limited practice, a strong presea
son will help the Card in conference play.
Senior outfielder Catalina Morris continues to
anchor the Stanford offense, batting .387 with 43
hits and 27 RBI. Freshman shortstop Maddy
Coon has a team-high nine homers and 31 RBI,
and sophomore Michelle Smith has plated 27.
In the circle, freshman Missy Penna (16-2) has
pitched more than half of Stanford's innings, strik
ing out 119 in 118 1/3. She has pitched six com
plete games and one no-hitter, and has also tallied
18 RBI on 29 hits as the designated player.
The Beavers, who shared last year's Pac-10 title
with the Cardinal, California and Arizona, rely
heavily on junior ace Brianne McGowan.who has

already notched 17 wins this year.
The 6-foot-2 righthander struck out 19

Cardinal batters in two games last year
— a 3-0 Stanford win and a 1-0 Beaver
victory. The Cardinal won the third
game 5-1 to take the season series.
On offense, Adrienne Alo (39 txife M

RBI) and Cambria Miranda (34 hits, 31
RBI) head a Beavers' lineup that has tal
lied six double-digit wins, including a 17-0

drubbing of Alabama-Birmingham in March

"OSU is a tremendous hitting team and they
have a lot of speed at the top of their lineup,"
Rittman said. "McGowan is very good — she
throws hard and mixes in a great changeup."
The Beavers opened conference play last
weekend with a victory over Arizona and an
extra-inning setback to Arizona State. They fol
lowed with a 2-0 win over Oregon before having a
doubleheader in Santa Clara rained out.
The Ducks finished only one game last week,
a loss to Arizona, before bad weather struck.
"They held their own against Arizona and
ASU," Rittman said. "They always play tough."
Breanne Sabol leads the squad with 28 hits and
21 RBI and is one of four players with three
homers. Amy Harris (8-4) and Melissa Rice (5-3)
head the Oregon pitching corps.
"Oregon is a scrappy team with good hitting,"
Rittman said. "They may not be ranked like some
of the teams in the Pac-10,but they are capable of
beating you if you don't > <
