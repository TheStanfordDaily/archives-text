# Roxy says: Spring is time for fling
## 
### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION SEX GODDESS 
First off, Roxy would like to begin by saying that she
is incredibly upset at not being able to advusfe you poor
children on spring break flirtation tactics It was like
throwing you to the dogs with nothing at all. Mean
while, Roxy spent her spring break in an undisclosed lo
cation in Mexico, where the sun shone everyday, and
tan, cute tourist boys — ahem men — were in abun
dance. The drunken debauchery never ended, and let
me tell you, those tourist boys sure know their stuff. On
a sidenotc. who knew that the door to the hotel rooftop
was left unlocked at night... talk about hot!
Well kiddies, for better or worse, it's that time of the
year again: spring quarter. Everybody's back from
spring break and ready to bust those newly tan, hot bod
ies out of their winter hibernation. Oh, who are we kid
dingj the rain is making this spring quarter one of the
wettest we've ever seen. But, Roxy always savs: the wet-

Tit* 7
ter the better. Seriously though, the rain just means

you'll have to spend more time indoors, trying to

stay warm. So, even though it's over, we can all
apply spring break to everyday life. Even if you

were not able to bring home that cute tourist boy or

j if you never got to have a sweet vacation fling. Roxy's

here to give you her secrets to snagging one
last fling (or two) before the year is over:

T) The hot tub. It's incredible how
j packed that place gets at night. With

the right bikini and the right pickup line

(It's your lucky night because I'm an ex-

otic woman who speaks your lan-

guage — or something to that ex-

tent), you'll have those tourists lin
ing up. But Roxy, last time I snuck
into a hot tub I had to make a run

'for it in my bikini and was lucky

not to get arrested. That may be

true, but with all the rain, you don't

need a hot tub to get it on. I mean, what guy could resist
you showing up at his door — dripping wet — while
wearing a white top... yeah. And guys, a kiss in the rain
is probably every gifl's ultimate fantasy-do it right, and
you'll definitely get more than just a kiss.
2) Tanning on the beach is another one of Roxy's fa
vorite activities. However, many girls make the rookie
mistake of tanning in huge groups, while reading their
latest Cosmo and sipping on a pina colada.That's a big
fat NO! There's nothing scarier for a guy than ap
proaching a group of hot,girls. The best way to get men
is to get moving, so get up and play a game of beach vol
leyball or jump into the water and splash around a bit.

They'll be on you like dip on a chip. Now perhaps frol
icking around Stanford in a bikini is a bit much, but tan
ning on the lawns by Cowell Cluster isn't the best way
to do it. If you're looking for a guy, then you need to get
moving. Why not ask that delicious eye candy of a man
from your beginner's water polo class to help you
"boost your skills", or invite that hunk of man-meat in
your introsem to play a game of sloshball? Hell, build a
slip'n slide and invite some of those hot Stanford swim
mers to join you! Frolicking in skimpy clothing is soooo
in right now.
3) Finally, what kind of a spring break would be com
plete without some clubbing? Ladies night at the bars
always gets Roxy's blood pumping. Maybe it's the fact
that being a lady in Mexico gets you free drinks all night
long, but Roxy loves to go south of the border — if you
know what I mean.,Ou top of that there's the killer
music, flashing lights, and thousands of bodies pressed
up against each other gyrating to the beat.
Hmm... did Roxy just describe a Irmparty 0 Yes people,
the best way to get that spring fling started is to attend
the best parties of the year. Dunk tank at SAE? Hell
yes! Sunsplash at Sigma Nu? Roxy's soooo there! Roxv , .

are. If you've been eyeing
that hottie from your

PWR class, what better
way to talk to hint
than by drunkenly \

j
tans you got over

spring break. If
that's not true love.
