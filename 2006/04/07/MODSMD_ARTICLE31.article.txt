# Mencia offends your mind... & yo mama

### VICTOR FUSTÉ INTERMISSION V-MAN 
Carlos Mencia is an equal opportu
nity racist. In the DVD of the first sea
son of his hit Comedy Central Show
"Mind of Mencia." he takes shots at
whites, blacks, Hispanics, gays, fat peo
ple, midgets. Catholics, Jews and (my
personal favorite) stupid people. Basi
cally, it's offensive to just about every
one on the planet,but that's what makes
it great. I often found myself laughing at
jokes I knew to be offensive (his bit on
the Catholic Church having brass balls
for electing a Pope who was in the Hitler
youth, for instance).but after the laugh
ter subsided I realized the tnith and
hypocrisy behind the jokes, which is an.
indicator of great satire.
Don't get me wrong, folks. 1 hate
racism as much as the next guy. but the
thing about Mencia is he isn't jiust mak
ing fun of ethnic groups for the sake ol
angering them! — he's dointit topdiii
out the stupidity that sUrrouscf the as
sumptions people make. Let% tuke im- >
migration as an example since Carlos is
so fond of pointing out the idiosyn
crasies of the Hispanic people. While it

may seem that tverv joke of las ends
with the racial punch-line of "wetback"

Wliile many people touted him as
the Mexican Dave Chappelle. Mencia
has a persona all his own, one that is an
gricr.more observant and! — dare I say
it?! — funnier than many of Chapelle's
characters. Whereas Chappelle relics
on characters he creates —I'm Rick
James, bitch!—for laughs, Mencia
sticks to basics, punctuating stupidity
with a "Deedeedee" while staying true
to his pissed off poijit of view. It's some
times cfnss and Alloying, but when he
point (Hit the double standard behind
the N-vvord. it's particularly effective in
making thoautfleik'l laugh and think at
the same time, a fieat Chappelle rarely
manager
Wnere Mencia really shines is when
he uses his racial jokes to highlight the
f\ ' . .

stupidity or laziness of some people.
When he asks Mexican workers about
what kind of work they would be willing
to do (Dig holes? Cut grass? Gay
pom?) and then compares their answer
to the lazy white people sipping coffee
at 11 a.m..you realize how just how frus
tratingly lazv someone who isn't willing
to work for a living truly is Brilliant.
Like my grandmother would say,
"those kids just need a good kick in the
ass."
Carlos Mencia is not a comedian for
everyone. Like a fine wine, or tequila in
this case, "Mind of Mencia" is an ac
quired taste. If you are easily offend
ed...hell, even if you are hard to offend.
Mencia will test your limits. Women,
gays and fat people have much to hate
in his yell-filled diatribes, but unfortu
nately for these undeirepresented mi
norities, Comedy Central has found
that offensive sells, so you can expect a
whole lot more "Mencia" to clog/grace
the airwaves in the coming months. As a
testament to his skill as a comedian —
and yes. even a satirist —vou will find
yourself hating some of the things he
says, yet laughing at them because you
know he's right.
