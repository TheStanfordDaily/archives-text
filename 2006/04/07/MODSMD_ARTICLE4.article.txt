## Review to apologize to dorms 
### CHRISTOPHER LIN STAFF WRITER 
This week, Stanford's Organization Conduct Board
(OCB) released a two-part recommendation regarding
The Stanford Review's violations of the door-to-door
distribution policy, requiring letters of apology from the
publications as well as a meeting with Nanci Howe, as
sociate dean and director of the Office of Student Ac
tivities.
The OCB held a hearing on March 10 to review the
alleged violation committed by Review members, who
distributed their publication door-to-door in Soto,
Serra, Francos and Larkin on Jan. 21 against policy. Dur
ing the hearing, an independent five-person panel —
made up of three undergraduate students, one graduate
student, one administrator and a director from Vaden
Health Center — listened to and evaluated evidence
both for and against The Review's self-described "civil
disobedience."
After the hearing, the OCB discussed the evidence
and made four recommendations to Associate Dean of
Graduate Student Life Christine Griffith on appropri
ate sanctions. Griffith revised two of the recommenda
tions and submitted them to The Review for implemen
tation.
The first required The Review to write a letter of
apology to the students, faculty and staff of the resi
dences in which they had distributed their publication
door-to-door. In a letter to the newspaper's staff, Grif
fith wrote that "although the OCB also recommended a
public apology and pre-approval of the letter by the Of
fice of Student Activities, I believe that a letter directed
specifically to the residents of the houses impacted is a

more effective means of communication."
The second recommendation required the incoming
leadership team of next year's Review staff to meet with
Howe in order to go over the Residential Education
Policy for the Distribution of Materials in Undergradu
ate Residences. However, staff of The Review ex
pressed skepticism that the meeting would create sig
nificant change in the distribution policy.
"I don't see how the meeting with Nancy will be en
tirely productive," said Editor in Chief Ryan Tracey, a
sophomore. "It's merely a formality so that she can tell
Jane Camarillo [director of Residential Education] and
the residential fellows that we've shown how we are re
sponsible."
However, Tracey said that overall, he was satisfied
with Griffith's directives.
"Chris Griffith's sanctions are fairly reasonable," he
said. "We are happy that the restrictions were fairly
light and not limiting."
The Review will continue its efforts to change the
door-to-door distribution policy through meetings with
the administration, considering a possible lawsuit as its
final option.Tracey and sophomore Navin Kadaba.The
Review's business manager, along with other members
of the Stanford publication community, plan to meet
with Dean of Student Affairs Greg Boardman next
week to discuss the University's distribution policy.
Tracey described the meeting as The Review's "last
olive branch to the administration."
"We're pretty sure that nothing is acceptable to us as
a paper unless it includes some sort of door-to-door dis
tribution," he said. "If we can't reach this, many people
have drawn up affidavits and we are certainly planning
on pressing forward and filing the lawsuit."
