# GRADUATE PANEL
## Juggling books with babies 
### ANDREA FULLER STAFF WRITER 
Curious graduate students seek
ing to understand the balance of ac
ademics and parenting filled Braun
Auditorium last night to hear per
sonal perspectives from a panel of
scientists.
The Women's Committee on
Graduate Life (WCGL), which
aims to improve the experience and
success of female graduate students
and postdoctoral scholars in chem
istry. hosted the event as part of the
quarterly Perspectives Seminar Se
ries.
"We tried to choose speakers
who represent both a wide range of
careers and a wide range of family
situations," said WCGL Secretary

Lisa Perlson, a graduate student in
Chemistry Operations. "The most
important message of the speakers
is that you do not have to choose be
tween having a family and having a
successful career. You may have to
be flexible regarding such things as
your time schedule and where you
live, but if you keep an open mind
about these issues, you can excel in
your career and have a meaningful
family life."
Perlson said that the lecture
would help students realize that
they are not alone in trying to bal
ance a career and parenting.
"It is important for students to
see that they are not breaking new
ground in trying to balance a full
time career and a family," she said.
"There are many others who have

done this before and there are many
models for students to look toward
as they think about their own fu
tures."
Ross Beyer, a NASA postdoc
toral scholar, identified with the dif
ficult decision of when to have chil
dren.
"We knew that we were getting
close to graduating," he said. "At
that time we knew we wanted to
have kids, so we did an analysis.
When is the good time to have kids?
When we graduate? When we get
that faculty position? We concluded
that no time was a good time to have
kids and that therefore all times
were equivalently good times."
Beyer's wife, Rachel Mastrapa,
also a NASA postdoctoral scholar,
said that the issue of health insur
ance was an important challenge for
her when she had a baby.
"I negotiated a job for myself
that would have health insurance,"
she said. "The fatal mistake I made
was me being the health insurance
person. When it came time to have
the baby, I ended up having to take
a month of family leave time, which
was unpaid. The real lesson 1 took
from that was to have the person
not having the baby to be the insur
ance."
Beyer discussed the challenge of
trying to fit both work and family
into her daily schedule.
"I thought being a scientist
would be great because 1 would be
able to set my own hours, but the
only time we can get work done is
when the child care center is open,"
he said. "In a lot of ways, I felt really
pressured to be productive in those
eight hours and that was not a good
mental situation to be at."
He noted that parents have to

make difficult decisions in choosing
between jobs and family time:
"The thing that 1 think is most im
portant is you decide what is impor
tant to you in your life," he said. "If
science is all that you care about, you
should do that and you should be
happy about that. For us, it was more
important to do our science jobs but
we also wanted to have a daughter
first, so we had to balance that with
daycare.
Beyer noted that the issue boils
down to compromise.
"1 may not be writing thee papers
a year, but I'm still getting work
done," he said. "There are trade-offs.

mouth discussed how — although
academia offers flexible hours — ac
ademics always have work they
could be doing.
"The hardest challenge is finding
those blocks of time when you can
really be productive," he said. "I still
haven't figured out how to do that.

But one of the advantages of being
academics is you really do set your
own hours. You can come in whenev
er. But you will always have to make
compromises. The job will take an in
finite amount of time if that's the
amount of time you want to give to
it."
Waymouth said that choosing
when to work involves making diffi
cult choices and often sacrifices.
"You have to decide what are
those times you want to be home and
what are those times you're going to
be working," he said. "Life's always a
balance. You're almost constantly
evaluating what you want to do. It's
just a question of where you want to
put the balance."
Denise Lee, a graduate student in
chemistry, said that she was motivat
ed to attend the discussion due to the
dearth of many women in scientific
professions.
"I'm interested in academia and
there are no female faculty members
in the Chemistry Department," she
said, clarifying that there is one fe
male lecturer that does not do re
search.
"So I was interested in seeing
how they balanced work and acade
mia and everything else."
