Curious graduate students seek
ing to understand the balance of ac
ademics and parenting filled Braun
Auditorium last night to hear per
sonal perspectives from a panel of
scientists.
The Women's Committee on
Graduate Life (WCGL), which
aims to improve the experience and
success of female graduate students
and postdoctoral scholars in chem
istry. hosted the event as part of the
quarterly Perspectives Seminar Se
ries.
"We tried to choose speakers
who represent both a wide range of
careers and a wide range of family
situations," said WCGL Secretary

Lisa Perlson, a graduate student in
Chemistry Operations. "The most
important message of the speakers
is that you do not have to choose be
tween having a family and having a
successful career. You may have to
be flexible regarding such things as
your time schedule and where you
live, but if you keep an open mind
about these issues, you can excel in
your career and have a meaningful
family life."
Perlson said that the lecture
would help students realize that
they are not alone in trying to bal
ance a career and parenting.
"It is important for students to
see that they are not breaking new
ground in trying to balance a full
time career and a family," she said.
"There are many others who have

done this before and there are many
models for students to look toward
as they think about their own fu
tures."
Ross Beyer, a NASA postdoc
toral scholar, identified with the dif
ficult decision of when to have chil
dren.
"We knew that we were getting
close to graduating," he said. "At
that time we knew we wanted to
have kids, so we did an analysis.
When is the good time to have kids?
When we graduate? When we get
that faculty position? We concluded
that no time was a good time to have
kids and that therefore all times
were equivalently good times."
Beyer's wife, Rachel Mastrapa,
also a NASA postdoctoral scholar,
said that the issue of health insur
ance was an important challenge for
her when she had a baby.
"I negotiated a job for myself
that would have health insurance,"
she said. "The fatal mistake I made
was me being the health insurance
person. When it came time to have
the baby, I ended up having to take
a month of family leave time, which
was unpaid. The real lesson 1 took
from that was to have the person
not having the baby to be the insur
ance."
Beyer discussed the challenge of
trying to fit both work and family
into her daily schedule.
"I thought being a scientist
would be great because 1 would be
able to set my own hours, but the
only time we can get work done is
when the child care center is open,"
he said. "In a lot of ways, I felt really
pressured to be productive in those
eight hours and that was not a good
mental situation to be at."
He noted that parents have to
