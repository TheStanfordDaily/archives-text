# SPECIAL EVENT
## Leftist speaker sparks debate 
### PATRICK LEAHY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Saturday, April 8, the non-Stanford affiliated or
ganization Friends of South Asia (FOSA) will be host
ing a panel discussion with Indian social activist Biju
Mathew on campus. The talk, however, has spurred de
bate over the appropriateness of inviting a leftist speak
er with ties to Communism to an academic campus.
FOSA was established in the Bay Area five years
ago to promote peace, tolerance and economic devel
opment in South Asia. During periods of heightened
tension between Pakistan and India they hold monthly
peace vigils in downtown Palo Alto, in conjunction
with dozens of similar vigils around the globe.
The organization has attracted some controversy,
however, with its leftist political views and its alleged
ties to Communist groups in India.
One source, a man who has protested against previ
ous FOSA events, but wished to remain anonymous,
expressed concern over what he perceives as Islamist
and Communist sympathies within the organization.
He referred specifically to a peace march organized
by FOSA "in which one of the banners claimed that
'Allah would destroy the terrorist state of India.'"
"America should not give space to Islamic terror
ists," the man said.
Mathew himself has also drawn criticism for his rad
ical political beliefs. At one time his Web page featured

a link to the Unabomber's Manifesto, although the link
is no longer active.
The same protester said that he is troubled by Math
ew's "support for the Unabomber and his association
with the Communist Party of India (Marxist)."
He also expressed unhappiness with what he felt to
be hypocrisy of Communists who. like Mathew, "made
a conscious choice to come to the U.S.A. and reap the
benefits of a market-oriented economy while demand
ing that others not benefit from a similar system.
"Stanford University is free to host anyone," he
said,"but it should not provide a platform for the prop
aganda of those who help terrorist groups like the
Communist Party of India (Marxist)."
Ashish Chadha, a Stanford graduate student and
one of FOSAs founders, arranged for the event to be
held on campus. Members of the public are not allowed
to use University facilities for an event without spon
sorship from a registered student group or academic
department within the University.
Chadha dismissed allegations about the organiza
tion's ties to Communism or terrorism, stressing that it
is simply a coalition of local South Asians, many of
whom have lived in the country for years. He said he
sees nothing controversial about the group's aims —
which it pursues, according to its mission, through
"people-to-people contacts, dialogue and other non-vi-
olent, non-exclusionary means."
"We just have progressive
ideas." he said.
Nor does Chadha see anything
controversial about Biju Mathew.
A business professor at Rider Uni
versiiy, Mathew is a founding
member of the New York Taxi
Workers Alliance and author of
"Taxi! Cabs and Capitalism in
New York City."
Chadha commended Mathew for
his work in making gains for New
York City's taxi drivers — members
of a profession legendary for its long
hours, low pay and high risks.
According to the FOSA Web site,
the talk will mainly focus on Math
ews book, while also covering sub
jects ranging from globalization to
sectarian politics in the South Asian
community. Two local organizers of
taxi driver unions will join Mathew
on the panel.
The discussion will take place in
Room 104 of the Gates Computer
Science Building at 3 p.m.
