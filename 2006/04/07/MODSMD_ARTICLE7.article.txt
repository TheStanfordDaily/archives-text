### AMIT ARORA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
HENGWITH GRAHAM
(Elizabeth Heng/Lauren Graham)
■ Experience: Heng is junior class president, Graham is
an ASSU Executive Cabinet member
■ Goals: Making Dead Week dead, strengthening Un
dergraduate Advising Programs, raising graduate health
care subsidies and creating a central Web site for room
reservations and student groups.

The Daily: What are the ASSIJ's weaknesses? What are
its strengths?
Lauren Graham: I am on the Executive Cabinet, so I've
seen what Melanie [Kannokada] and Aneto [Okonkwo]
have done this year. I feel that what we are weaker on and
trying to improve on is the level of communication be
tween the students and the ASSU. It's always an ongoing
thing that we are working on. We are working on the
newsletter, how the ASSU works, and how students who
don't have an actual position in the Cabinet, Senate or
NomCom can get involved with the ASSU.
TD: Have our current executives done a good job with
that?
Elizabeth Heng: They've done a very good job. I think
that one of the biggest problems with campus govern
ment is "re-inventing the wheel." 1 know for a fact that
Melanie and Aneto for the coming elections are going to
pass on whatever they have worked on to the coming
elect. I think that has always been one of the biggest chal
lenges — transition.
LG: 1 think that they've really strengthened their rela
tionships with their Cabinet. We were all on the same
page, we were all giving feedback to one another, and we

had more than one head on an idea... I think that was one
thing that stuck out in my mind. Organization for them
was huge; I have great respect for that.
TD: What are you looking to improve on then?
LCi: One thing is the idea of institutional memory and th
transferring of documents between leadership. In th
same way that the ASSU tries to inform the next prev
dent and vice president, we are looking to create some
type of online system that would allow the Volunteer Sci
vice Organizations to have a student database for the last
year. It would include their successes, their failures, their
events, their speakers. It would be a form of communica
tion that would save time, allow students to know what s
going on and know what works and what doesn't work
TD: It seems like student apathy is a major problem
Would your reforms address this issue?
LG: Well the student databases are geared to communi
cation within the student groups. 1 lowever, as far as corn
munication between the VSO and the ASSU. that's some
thing we are always working on. It's difficult becaus
ASSU leadership changes every year, so the focus of the
VSO coordinator might change. If you have a person with
strong leadership experience who is vocal, it gives that
student group an advantage over other groups. Whether
