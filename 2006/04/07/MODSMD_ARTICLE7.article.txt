## Heng, Graham hope event planning will come in handy to unify campus 
### AMIT ARORA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
HENGWITH GRAHAM
(Elizabeth Heng/Lauren Graham)
■ Experience: Heng is junior class president, Graham is
an ASSU Executive Cabinet member
■ Goals: Making Dead Week dead, strengthening Un
dergraduate Advising Programs, raising graduate health
care subsidies and creating a central Web site for room
reservations and student groups.

The Daily: What are the ASSIJ's weaknesses? What are
its strengths?
Lauren Graham: I am on the Executive Cabinet, so I've
seen what Melanie [Kannokada] and Aneto [Okonkwo]
have done this year. I feel that what we are weaker on and
trying to improve on is the level of communication be
tween the students and the ASSU. It's always an ongoing
thing that we are working on. We are working on the
newsletter, how the ASSU works, and how students who
don't have an actual position in the Cabinet, Senate or
NomCom can get involved with the ASSU.
TD: Have our current executives done a good job with
that?
Elizabeth Heng: They've done a very good job. I think
that one of the biggest problems with campus govern
ment is "re-inventing the wheel." 1 know for a fact that
Melanie and Aneto for the coming elections are going to
pass on whatever they have worked on to the coming
elect. I think that has always been one of the biggest chal
lenges — transition.
LG: 1 think that they've really strengthened their rela
tionships with their Cabinet. We were all on the same
page, we were all giving feedback to one another, and we

had more than one head on an idea... I think that was one
thing that stuck out in my mind. Organization for them
was huge; I have great respect for that.
TD: What are you looking to improve on then?
LCi: One thing is the idea of institutional memory and th
transferring of documents between leadership. In th
same way that the ASSU tries to inform the next prev
dent and vice president, we are looking to create some
type of online system that would allow the Volunteer Sci
vice Organizations to have a student database for the last
year. It would include their successes, their failures, their
events, their speakers. It would be a form of communica
tion that would save time, allow students to know what s
going on and know what works and what doesn't work
TD: It seems like student apathy is a major problem
Would your reforms address this issue?
LG: Well the student databases are geared to communi
cation within the student groups. 1 lowever, as far as corn
munication between the VSO and the ASSU. that's some
thing we are always working on. It's difficult becaus
ASSU leadership changes every year, so the focus of the
VSO coordinator might change. If you have a person with
strong leadership experience who is vocal, it gives that
student group an advantage over other groups. Whether


JOEL LEWENSTEIN/The Stanford Daily
you are a sophomore who's trying to
lead a political group or a co-term
student who has experience, we're
hoping both can get something from
the ASSU in understanding how to
do things.
Tl): Why are you two running to
gether?
EH: I think we are running together
because we've worked together
since freshman year.
LG: We also have a great respect for
each other's work ethic. I was look
ing for a running mate that is really
dedicated to not only the ASSU but
dedicated in her life and academics. 1
was on the Senate; we were both on
the Cabinet and Frosh Council. She
is a class president.
TD: What is your strategy to win this
election?
LG: We really want to reach as
many students as possible, and not
just reach them but actually hear

what their issues are, especially be
cause that's one of the ongoing con
cerns of the ASSU — how to reach
students.
EH: 1 have worked hard the last
quarter to talk with a number of stu
dent leaders, from The Daily's editor
in chief to the IFC'/ISC presidents.
We got all the ideas and we stream
lined it. We then approached faculty
members to see whether these things
are feasible. Some of our plans
weren't feasible. It would take 15
years to accomplish them. But we're
honest about it. 1 can't say that I'm
going to create faculty diversity I un
derstand it's an ongoing project and
I'm going to work on it. Dead Week
dead can be done. Other parts of our
platform are manageable.
LG: You won't see the fruits of the
labor, but if you come back as an
alumnus, you will be proud to see
that Stanford has changed some
thing for a positive outcome.
EH: And I think that this has hap
pened, and off the record...
TD: Sorry, we can't include anything
off the record in this context.
LG: Alright next.
