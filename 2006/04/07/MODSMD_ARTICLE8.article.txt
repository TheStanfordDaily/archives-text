THE SOUND AND THE FURY
(Allan Phillips/ Doug Kenter)
■ Experience: Phillips was the Truest Eye at the Tennessee
Marksmanship Competition, Kenter was Bounty Maga
zine's Man of the Year.
■ Beating plowshares into swords, halting the illicit
sugar trade, effectuating the dissolution of the ASSU Sen
ate, and instituting a 9 p.m. curfew for all graduate stu
dents living on campus.

The Sound and the Fury: Chaparral
The Daily: What do you think are the strengths and the
weaknesses of the ASSU, at least in the last year?
Allan Phillips: I think its greatest strength right now is
self-perpetuation; its greatest weakness is decadence.The
ASSU is something of a bloated beast; it just feeds on it
self. It's also manifested as a nightmare to the Stanford
undergraduate body.
TD: How do you plan to improve upon this?
AP: Dissolution of the Senate.
Doug Kenter: We're going to pare down the menu op
tions, in more ways than one.
TD: Menu options?
DK: Just the amount of people and the amount of excess
in student government has always been a limiting factor
in achieving certain goals.
TD: So you are going to scale back on the bureaucracy?
AP: In a broader sense, it's a crippling choice available to
undergraduates on this campus. I mean the way they have
tried to deal with it in the past is through undergraduate

advising. I don't know if you have ever been undergnulu
ately advised, but it's a disgrace. What we propose is sc;ii
ing back on choice. I'm thinking two to three majors. 1
haven't decided which yet, and similar cutbacks in all
places.
TI): In the summary of your plans, you su-*gi"' "d that you
are going to "beat plowshare* into swords" and "limit am
then halt the illicit sugar trade.''
I)K: Plowshares into swords.That's really an abstract way
of saying that we're going to scoop down the campus am
build it back up leaner, basically more self-aware asuJ
more self-sufficient than the students know. Proudei
heads held higher on every corner of every street on tlws
campus.
TD: And how do you plan on halting the illicit sugai
trade?
DK: We know the names: we're not going to say them
right now. Those who know the names will give us the
names.
TD: Does the ASSU really have that much power?
AP: 1 'm not sure about the scope of the ASSU at present
