### AMIT ARORA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
THE SOUND AND THE FURY
(Allan Phillips/ Doug Kenter)
■ Experience: Phillips was the Truest Eye at the Tennessee
Marksmanship Competition, Kenter was Bounty Maga
zine's Man of the Year.
■ Beating plowshares into swords, halting the illicit
sugar trade, effectuating the dissolution of the ASSU Sen
ate, and instituting a 9 p.m. curfew for all graduate stu
dents living on campus.

The Sound and the Fury: Chaparral
The Daily: What do you think are the strengths and the
weaknesses of the ASSU, at least in the last year?
Allan Phillips: I think its greatest strength right now is
self-perpetuation; its greatest weakness is decadence.The
ASSU is something of a bloated beast; it just feeds on it
self. It's also manifested as a nightmare to the Stanford
undergraduate body.
TD: How do you plan to improve upon this?
AP: Dissolution of the Senate.
Doug Kenter: We're going to pare down the menu op
tions, in more ways than one.
TD: Menu options?
DK: Just the amount of people and the amount of excess
in student government has always been a limiting factor
in achieving certain goals.
TD: So you are going to scale back on the bureaucracy?
AP: In a broader sense, it's a crippling choice available to
undergraduates on this campus. I mean the way they have
tried to deal with it in the past is through undergraduate

advising. I don't know if you have ever been undergnulu
ately advised, but it's a disgrace. What we propose is sc;ii
ing back on choice. I'm thinking two to three majors. 1
haven't decided which yet, and similar cutbacks in all
places.
TI): In the summary of your plans, you su-*gi"' "d that you
are going to "beat plowshare* into swords" and "limit am
then halt the illicit sugar trade.''
I)K: Plowshares into swords.That's really an abstract way
of saying that we're going to scoop down the campus am
build it back up leaner, basically more self-aware asuJ
more self-sufficient than the students know. Proudei
heads held higher on every corner of every street on tlws
campus.
TD: And how do you plan on halting the illicit sugai
trade?
DK: We know the names: we're not going to say them
right now. Those who know the names will give us the
names.
TD: Does the ASSU really have that much power?
AP: 1 'm not sure about the scope of the ASSU at present


JOEL LEWENSTEIN/The Stanford I la ly
I am an ambitious man, however. I
don't want to be backed down by the
current state of things. When the
body allows reflective change, then...
[indecipherable mumbling].
TD: What experience have you had
in leadership positions?
AP: 1 was the captain of a whaling
ship for six years. 1 have actually per
sonally thrown the harpoon that
killed an unnamed whale. It is actual
ly the largest beast ever slain by man.
I>K: Allan and I met on the coast of
Argentina a long time ago, I can't re
member when. We both roped the
same spear, and we tore the beast
asunder after hours and hours of
struggle. We feasted on it that night
along with pork, told stories, became
fast friends the fastest.
TD: Now Doug, here in your back
ground, it states that you are a lin
guistics and civil engineering major.
How does that background prepare
you for work in the ASSU?

DK: My studies aren't reflective of
my attitude or my ambition. I really
only study those because I need to.
Communications is a really impor
tant part of being a bounty hunter
and civil engineering is useful in un
derstanding different explosives.
TD: Do you feel like there have been
inadequacies in the current ASSU
leadership?
AP: Certainly not in terms of beauty,
of course. Yes, I feel failed by my rep
resentatives.
TD: Doug?
I)K: 1 agree. It's been alarmingly dis
appointing.
TD: What is your strategy for win
ning this election?
AP: Strength.
TI): You mean brute strength?
AP: No, strength of will, strength of
leadership. Our opponents are...well
one slate is a combined 9'11", not
more than that, not a terrible amount
of strength present there. We are not
big flesh-pressers, shakers of hands,
flat-handers. I think that we have an
ability to get people's respect; really
we just need to get as many people as
we can to stand within 20 feet of us.
TD: Well how do you plan on doing

that?
AP: 1 think walking around and hav
ing reasons for people to gather. I think
some combination of those.
TD: I understand that you are
friends, but how does that benefit the
Stanford community?
DK: We have had few endeavors
apart.
TD: And that will help your ability to
lead?
AP: Yes, the synergy present be
tween us is incalculable. I feel like
some of these other pairings are
those of opportunity. 1 mean when a
president picks his vice-presidential
candidate to carry his stakes, there is
a sour taste of cynicism that comes
with that.
TD: Now let's talk about your oppo
sition. Are their plans feasible?
AP:That's not important to me.
DK: We focus solely on our goals; we
don't get distracted easily. It really
doesn't matter what they're propos
ing anyway, it's the same old thing.
TD: Now suppose 1 am a freshman
and have never heard of the ASSU
before. Why should 1 vote for you?

TD: Does the ASSU really have that much power?
AP: 1 'm not sure about the scope of the ASSU at present


JOEL LEWENSTEIN/The Stanford I la ly
I am an ambitious man, however. I
don't want to be backed down by the
current state of things. When the
body allows reflective change, then...
[indecipherable mumbling].
TD: What experience have you had
in leadership positions?
AP: 1 was the captain of a whaling
ship for six years. 1 have actually per
sonally thrown the harpoon that
killed an unnamed whale. It is actual
ly the largest beast ever slain by man.
I>K: Allan and I met on the coast of
Argentina a long time ago, I can't re
member when. We both roped the
same spear, and we tore the beast
asunder after hours and hours of
struggle. We feasted on it that night
along with pork, told stories, became
fast friends the fastest.
TD: Now Doug, here in your back
ground, it states that you are a lin
guistics and civil engineering major.
How does that background prepare
you for work in the ASSU?

DK: My studies aren't reflective of
my attitude or my ambition. I really
only study those because I need to.
Communications is a really impor
tant part of being a bounty hunter
and civil engineering is useful in un
derstanding different explosives.
TD: Do you feel like there have been
inadequacies in the current ASSU
leadership?
AP: Certainly not in terms of beauty,
of course. Yes, I feel failed by my rep
resentatives.
TD: Doug?
I)K: 1 agree. It's been alarmingly dis
appointing.
TD: What is your strategy for win
ning this election?
AP: Strength.
TI): You mean brute strength?
AP: No, strength of will, strength of
leadership. Our opponents are...well
one slate is a combined 9'11", not
more than that, not a terrible amount
of strength present there. We are not
big flesh-pressers, shakers of hands,
flat-handers. I think that we have an
ability to get people's respect; really
we just need to get as many people as
we can to stand within 20 feet of us.
TD: Well how do you plan on doing

that?
AP: 1 think walking around and hav
ing reasons for people to gather. I think
some combination of those.
TD: I understand that you are
friends, but how does that benefit the
Stanford community?
DK: We have had few endeavors
apart.
TD: And that will help your ability to
lead?
AP: Yes, the synergy present be
tween us is incalculable. I feel like
some of these other pairings are
those of opportunity. 1 mean when a
president picks his vice-presidential
candidate to carry his stakes, there is
a sour taste of cynicism that comes
with that.
TD: Now let's talk about your oppo
sition. Are their plans feasible?
AP:That's not important to me.
DK: We focus solely on our goals; we
don't get distracted easily. It really
doesn't matter what they're propos
ing anyway, it's the same old thing.
TD: Now suppose 1 am a freshman
and have never heard of the ASSU
before. Why should 1 vote for you?
AP: You are standing within 20 feet
of us mainlv.
