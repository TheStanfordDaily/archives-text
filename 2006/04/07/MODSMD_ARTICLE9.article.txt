### AMIT ARORA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
RILLERA/NGUYEN
(Marc Rillera/Chris Nguyen)
■ Experience: Rillera is Admit Weekend Coordinator,
Nguyen is ASSU Undergraduate Senate Chair
■ Ensuring low-cost Munger housing for graduate
students, negotiating for cheaper Caltrain GO Passes,
assisting student groups with funding and maximizing
student space in Old Union.

The Daily: What do you see as some of the strengths and
weaknesses of the ASSU, at least in the last year?
Chris Nguyen: I think I'll start with strengths. I think this
year we worked at having graduate and undergraduate
issues treated more closely because graduate students
have often been neglected by the ASSU. This year, the
ASSU executive has worked really hard on graduate is
sues, and the ASSU Undergraduate Senate has also been
working more closely with the Graduate Student Coun
cil than it has ever before. In terms of weaknesses, I would
have to say that communication with the student body is
rather lacking, so it's often hard for students to realize
what the ASSU is doing.
Marc Rillera: Chris offers more of an insider perspective;
I have an outsider's perspective. 1 do not have any ASSU
experience, and from a normal student's perspective, we
don't know what the inner-workings of the ASSU are;
what we know are some of the major issues that are going
on, but we don't know what taking place in terms of im
plementation and basically where the funding goes.
TD: Marc, how do you feel that not being a part of the
ASSU has prepared you for the job?

MR: I feel that my being an outsider is not a disadvan
tage. As a slate, we're a team. There are a lot of things I
don't know about the ASSU, but there are a lot of things
I can learn from Chris and from the experience. 1 don't
consider it a disadvantage.
Tl>: Most students are apathetic about politics on cam
pus. We know the ASSU recognizes this. What reforms
are you looking to make to make the ASSU more trans
parent?
CN: Well, the Senate has been trying to do this with
quarterly newsletter we are publishing. One possibility is
to a hire a cabinet member for the executive whose sole
job is to inform the students of what's going on. They
would use the Stanford Student Enterprises flyer in
service; this would tell students that this is what the ASSI
is working on and this is what they are trying to accom
plish.
MR: I feel like a lot of what the ASSU accomplishes is
published through The Daily and the ASSU Web site,
both of which a lot of students don't check on a normal
basis. In addition to the quarterly newsletter, a weekly
email would be great. Most people don't know what's
happening with the Senate meetings; if I could be updat
ed more than once during the quarter, it would be help
ful. I know that in my time here. I've only checked the


JOEL LEWENSTEIN/The Stanford Daily
Web site once or twice.
TD: What other type of reforms are
you looking to initiate?
CN: Besides the communications
reform that were just outlined, an
other key reform is NomCom, the
student representatives to various
University boards which make poli
cy. NomCom currently sets which
meetings a person has and that
meeting obligation only lists the
meetings with the boards. If we were
elected, the NomCom member
would meet with the student leaders
as well on the issues.
MR: Student space and student
group funding have always been big
issues. In terms of student funding,
Chris and I have always talked
about the external resources in the
area as well as reserve funds within
SSE that could fund student groups.
A long term goal is building student
facilities for student space. From a
performing arts perspective or a
drama perspective, in terms of meet
ings, there is always a shortage.
CN:The ASSU endowment is grow
ing at a very rapid rate. Some of the
plans we have been making this year
have involved the use of these funds
for these groups. In the more imme
diate future, we could use proximity
cards to make Tressider Union a 24-
hour space.
TD: Are these reforms feasible?
MR: 1 feel like that's why for the
most part our goals are very specific.
Rather than have broad, long-term
goals that are not feasible, we are
talking about grad-student reforms,
with short-term issues such as GO
Passes. These are very feasible
things that the ASSU can take care
of. We're not saying that we're going
to construct a building. That's not
our goal.
TD: 1 am a freshman; I'm new to
Stanford; what impetus do 1 have to
vote on the executive slates?
CN: Well basically, the changes that
occur through the ASSU take a
number of years. The changes in Old
Union have been discussed for a
number of years, for example. Vot
ing for an ASSU executive now for a
freshman could have changes that
last throughout this person's career
and even beyond his time at Stan
ford.
