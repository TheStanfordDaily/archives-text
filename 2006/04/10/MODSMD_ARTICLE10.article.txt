# All gone to WASTE
## 
### PAMELA SUD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
New York artist to
collect Stanford
community's
obsolete electronic
equipment and
turn it into
outdoor sculpture

In a few weeks, the lawn in front of
the Cummings Art Building could be
home to your old batteries and obso
lete extension cords.
Along with the Cantor Center for
Visual Arts, the Stanford Art Depart
ment and the Stanford University
Panel on Outdoor Art — a group of
students that the President's Office
elects to choose and commission out
door sculptures — artist Steven Siegel
will create a sculpture that reflects the
enormous amount of digital waste that
the Stanford community generates.
Siegel lives in Red Hook, New York
but has received art commissions
throughout the nation and world.
"E-waste," or electronic waste, is a
popular, informal name for electronic
products nearing the end of their use
ful life. Computers, televisions, VCRs,
stereos, copiers, fax machines, old CDs
and broken keyboards are all types of
e-waste. According to Peninsula Sani
tary Service, Inc. and the Stanford Re
cycling Center, e-waste is one of the
fastest-growing segments of America's
waste stream. Many electronic prod
ucts can be reused, refurbished or recy
cled, but they simply are not.
"More laws are being passed that

do not allow landfills to accept e-waste,
and reusing and recycling these prod
ucts is an uphill battle," says senior
Sarah Garmisa, who is helping coordi
nate Siegel's project. "A public art
project allows us to bring this issue to
the public so people are more aware of
the problem and can help develop cre
ative solutions."
Although Cantor says it hopes
Siegel's sculpture will make students
aware of the e-waste issue, Siegel says
he is "not a message guy."
"I do not have any purpose or mes
sage other than to make an aesthetical
ly powerful object," Siegel remarks.
Any connotations that his sculpture
will carry are a bonus, but not a focus of
the project, he continues.
During the week of April 23,
Siegel's sculpture will be under con
struction on the front lawn of Cum
mings Art Building, near the big oak
tree. Many American universities have
commissioned Siegel to create sculp
tures or other pieces of art. Most re
cently, he created a piece called "Tilt"
at Kent State University.
"I have a way of working that allows
the use of almost any material," Siegel
says.
The massive sculpture will stand
alone without any information or writ
ten explanation near it.

"If anyone suggests [otherwise] I
will protest," Siegel says."Let the work
speak for itself."
How big of an e-waste problem
does Stanford actually have? Accord
ing to Julie Muir, manager of Stan
ford's Recycling Program for the last
12 years, California schools actually
have less of a problem than schools in
other states. California e-waste laws
make it easier to recycle products that
contain cathode ray tubes, like televi
sions and computer monitors.
"Consumers are required to pay an
advanced recycling fee," Muir explains.
In addition, Stanford's Environ
mental Health and Safety Department
is proactive in managing this waste in
an environmentally friendly way, ac
cording to Muir.
The problem is the lack of available
markets for e-waste products and
parts.
"This is a growing and expensive
waste stream with no slowing down in
sight," Muir says.
Students, staff, faculty or members
of the Stanford community are invited
to come by the site to help build the
piece or to donate supplies. The sculp
ture will remain on the lawn for sever
al weeks. Please contact Sarah
Garmisa (sgarmisa@stanford.edu) for
more information about volunteering.
