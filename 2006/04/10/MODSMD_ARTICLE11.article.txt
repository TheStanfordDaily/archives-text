# Students go from Cardinal red to the Red Carpet

### ANJALEE SUJANANI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While spring break gave many students the
chance to relax and recharge, for a select group
of students it provided the opportunity to look
ahead at life after the Farm and learn about ca
reers in entertainment.
For the second year running, the Stanford
in Entertainment student group, with the help
of the Los Angeles Stanford in Entertainment
alumni club, organized a four-day trip to Los
Angeles to meet with various alumni in the in
dustry.
"Stanford in Entertainment is a brand-new
student group with a dual purpose," says co
president and senior Natalie Farrell, who is ma
joring in political science. "The first is to help
show Stanford students that there are career
tracks in entertainment, and that an interest in
film, television, music or other entertainment
media can translate into a career in one of those
fields, both creatively and on the business side."
The second goal of the group is profession
al development.
"The business of entertainment is one that
is driven tremendously by networks and rela
tionships, and a strong student-alumni net
work is something that could be mutually ben
eficial," Farrell continues.
Farrell says that the spring break Holly
wood trip is the group's largest program. But
since it is a new group, it is still coming up with
programming ideas.
"For example, last quarter we held an in
ternship panel featuring students who had in
terned in various facets of the industry," she
explains. "Students on the panel had interned
at Universal Music Group, Miramax Films,
CSI, Paramount Pictures, Smallville and
Dream Works animation, to name a few."
Steven Tagle, a junior majoring in English
and Psychology, says he "likes that Stanford in

Entertainment has close ties to the alumni net
work in Hollywood." Tagle interned last sum
mer at Warner Brothers on the set of Wolfgang
Petersen's "Poseidon" and at Village Road
show Pictures as a development intern.
He continues, "I think that the club pro
vides excellent opportunities to network with
industry professionals while still in college,
and as more links are formed between the club
and the entertainment alumni.it will be an ex
cellent way to get honest career advice and
break into the industry."
T\velve students went on the L.A. trip last
year, and 11 this year. The students stayed in a
hostel while they were in L.A. and had two or
three meetings each day. Their meeting lineup
included entertainment lawyers, entertainment
agents, movie producers and television writers.
Students learned from Stanford alums such
as Lisa Nitti, an entertainment attorney at
Greenberg TVaurig; and Greg Silverman, sen
ior vice president of production at Warner
Brothers. Silverman was a producer and studio
executive of "Batman Begins,""Dukes of Haz
zard" and "Poseidon" (awaiting release).
They also met with Sam Dickerman, senior
vice president at Columbia Pictures (Sony Pic
tures), who was a producer on "Troy" and
Blake Masters, screenwriter and creator of the
new Showtime series "Brotherhood," airing in
summer 2(X)6.
"The trip taught me so much about the in
dustry," says senior and American studies
major Amy Aniobi. "Sure, it painted a rather
glamorous view of Hollywood, since we met
primarily with established and up-and-coming
success stories, but 1 learned that everyone has
to put in their dues. You can't wait for a 'big
break.' Often you have to chase it down and
grab it — before someone else does."
Other students on the trip had similar
views.
"I definitely got what it is like to work in

Hollywood as an assistant or in another entry
level job", says senior and English major Jimmy
Mosqueda, who aspires to write and produce
for television, and eventually work in film as a
writer or director. "It's a lot more cutthroat and
difficult than I imagined. But I also realized that
anything is possible and that one can achieve
their goals if one sticks to them. Every person
we met on the trip showed us that."
Stanford alum Spencer Porter gave stu
dents a tour of the "Family Guy" and "Ameri
can Dad" offices and animation rooms. Stu
dents also got to talk to some of the writers on
the shows, including alum Chris McKenna,
writer for "The Girl Next Door" and "Ameri
can Dad." Finally, Stanford and USC film
school alum Jason Moore, a director, gave the
group a tour of the USC film school.
"I had never considered writing for televi
sion", Aniobi says, "but after meeting with a
staff writer from 'Family Guy' and 'American
Dad,' I'm giving it more thought — a lot of us
were, because they seem to have a lot of fun at
their jobs."
While on the trip, students attended an in
formal meet-and-greet with Stanford alumni,
which gave them the chance to network with
accomplished and aspiring alumni in the en
tertainment field.
"The best thing about the trip was that
every person we met with was a Stanford
alum," Aniobi says."It was exhilarating to
meet Stanford alums who willingly gave up
Cardinal Recruiting for Miracle Mile and still
made it out of their 20s alive, employed and
happy."
Farrell, who grew up in L. A., says, "I've al
ways sort of been hyper-aware of 'the busi
ness,' but always kind of viewed it as some
thing that was impervious to outsiders.
Through my experience of meeting alumni
who have had immensely successful careers in
the business, my attitude about Hollywood has

changed tremendously."
Tagle says the most valuable thing he
learned from the trip is that there are many
ways to be successful in the entertainment in
dustry.
"First of all, there are more careers in enter
tainment than just being a writer or director,"
he says. "We met with entertainment lawyers,
agents, studio execs and magazine columnists.
Secondly, it was valuable for me to hear each
alumnus's personal story, and particularly to
discover that you could become successful
without following the traditional assistant
route."
He adds, "The alums we met were interest
ed in our goals and ambitions, and they ques
tioned us about what we were passionate
about and offered us specific advice about
steps we could take right now to advance our
careers."
Mosqueda says that he would definitely
recommend the trip to students aspiring to
work in Hollywood.
"If anything, it will definitely confirm their
desire to work in the industry or it will turn
them off of it,"he says."It doesn't matter what
major you are. If you're interested in working
in the industry, the trip is a great way to get an
introduction.
According to Tagle, "Many of the alums the
students met with were economics or humbio
majors at Stanford. So I'd be hesitant to limit
the trip to students just from film or English
majors."
Aniobi adds that the trip would also be use
ful for students who are not yet positive about
a future in the entertainment industry.
"You learn the ropes a bit, learn the hierar
chy and that gives you insight," she explains.
"TTiere is no major for which this trip should
be specified. It is geared toward a passion. If
you love film,you make film — you don't have
to major in it."
