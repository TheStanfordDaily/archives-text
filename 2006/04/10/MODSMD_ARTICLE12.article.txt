## Editorial Thanks, Melanie and Aneto 
### 
Faithful readers of the Stanford Daily
will realize that the Editorial Board did
not endorse the election campaign of
current ASSU executives Melanie Kannoka
da and Aneto Okonkwo. The board chose to
endorse their opponents Victoria Carr and
Fernando Castillo instead ("Carr/Castillo
best choice for ASSU," Apr. s,2(X)s).Thus, it is
not without some irony that the board returns
to review the performance of Kannokada and
Okonkwo so far.
Our main grouse with the
Kannokada/Okonkwo slate in last year's
campaign was that they looked unlikely to
achieve their ambitious goals,especially given
their heavy courseloads and extracurricular
commitments. Like many other ASSU cam
paigns, theirs was one built on promises that
were monumental and overstretched. The
board was extremely skeptical about their
ability to deliver upon those goals.
Needless to say, many of their wild cam
paign promises went unfulfilled. They did
not increase graduate student advising for
undergraduates by offering free meals to
graduate students. They did not manage to
restructure the University's general educa
tion requirements to accommodate more
classes on cultural and sexual minorities.
And they certainly did not break Stanford
Dining's monopoly on meal plans — one
still wonders if that is even possible.
But as we look back a year after their elec
tion. it's clear that Kannokada and Okonkwo
have done a fine job as ASSU executives. The
pair was crucially involved in allocating more
space for student groups on campus. By com
municating student interests to the Universi
ty administration, they made sure that stu
dent groups had greater access to campus
space with fewer restrictions and with more
flexibility. Also, they looked into ways of in
creasing storage space for student groups.
As ASSU executives, Kannokada and
Okonkwo formed the vital link between stu

dents and the administration. The University
administrators we contacted were impressed
with Kannokada and Okonkwo's availability
were during their term in office. The execu
tives were critical in ensuring open channels
of communication for both parties.
To a large extent, Kannokada and
Okonkwo's success rests largely on the
strength of their personalities. Many student
leaders who have worked with them com
mented on their teamwork and leadership
skills. These leaders added that Kannokada
and Okonkwo showed tremendous initia
tive, putting a lot of effort into researching
important issues that affected student life.
Their leadership style, at once inspirational
and involved, formed the basis for better in
tegration of the ASSU, the Undergraduate
Senate and the Graduate Student Council.
We realize that many of the contributions
that our ASSU executives make are largely
behind the scenes. A lot of work goes into the
day-to-day administration of the student
government. In the meantime, the average
student is usually too uninformed or apathet
ic to find out more about the intricate hap
penings of the ASSU. So while Kannokada
and Okonkwo have made large strides in stu
dent government at Stanford, many of their
efforts have gone unnoticed. Next year's
ASSU executives should strive to reduce the
distance between the ASSU and students.
We are not advocating that ASSU execu
tives put on a circus show to trumpet their
achievements, but more should be done to
increase their outward presence on campus.
At the same time, we are grateful for Kan
nokada and Okonkwo's efforts, despite the
fact that many of these efforts will be over
looked by the majority of Stanford students.
The job of the ASSU executives is often a
thankless one. So for all the times that Kan
nokada and Okonkwo have quietly per
formed their duties as ASSU executives, we
offer a hearty thank you.
