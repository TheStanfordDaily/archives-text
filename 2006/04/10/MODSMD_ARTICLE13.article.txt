# How to run for Senate
## 
### 
Election meetings:
Go to the mandatory meetings. Don't pay
attention when they go over campaign poli
cies though, that way you won't know you're
violating rules when you plaster every visi
ble space in a dorm with your flyers.
The Petition:
So you need 1(X) signatures to get on the
ballot. Get them. If you find yourself strug
gling with obtaining the necessary number
because your friends are too lazy to sign a
petition (or you don't have friends), take
your laptop around to random people and
ask them to sign your petition. Make sure
you don't know them, so they feel as awk
wardly pressured into signing your petition
as possible.
Endorsements:
Meet with a student group to convince
them that your platform is in line with the in
terests of their group. (This will probably be
the point when you realize that you need a
platforms.) Make it clear to the group that
you will be their mindless slave in the Sen
ate, kind of like their group's own lobbyist,
except you have voting power!
Platforms:
When choosing a platform don't get tan
gled up in trivialities like being realistic
about what you have the power to change.
Your platforms should be: impossibly vague
(I'll make Stanford a better place!);impossi
ble for the Senate to implement (I'll lower
tuition!); already implemented by the Sen
ate (I'll create an Online Draw Guide!).
The Handbook Statement:
The what? Come on, no one actually
reads these.
E-campaign:
Send out massive amounts of annoying
spam email. Don't forget to start a Facebook
group and invite everyone on your "friends"
list. (Feel free to invite friends of friends
too!)
Flyers:
This is HUGE. Wow, I really need subsec
tions for this.
Design: The flyer is composed of three el
ements. First and most impoitantly is your
name. Write it big. For instance: AARON
QAYUMI. Second is the catchy slogan. The
slogan (preferably rhyming) should be easy
to remember and as meaningless as possible.
Though catchiness is important, don't stress
out too much about it. Remember that your
slogan will be read over and over by people
in bathrooms, so it will probably get stuck in
their heads anyway. Finally, it doesn't hurt to
include your vapid platforms and endorse
ment loyalties.
Production: Make copies. A lot of
copies. Head to your local copy store and
choose the most brightly colored paper
possible. Your flyer must singe its image

into its viewers' retinas: If the paper doesn't
have warning labels saying it may cause
epilepsy and should not be viewed by preg
nant women, then it isn't bright enough.
Make 1000 copies.
Recruiting: You now have a massive
amount of eye-catching flyers to distribute.
Distribution will consist of you flyering and
your friends flyering for/with you. If your
friends seem hesitant to assist you, remind
them of all the times you've helped them
out.Then say,"l thought we were friends" or
"And you were so close to being my best
friend." If this doesn't work, start crying vio
lently. This will work even better if you're
male (trust me).
Distribution: Hopefully you managed to
recruit some friends to help you flyer all over
campus. Your friends will either flyer for you
or with you.
If your friends flyer with you, they can
hold the flyers while you tape/staple them
in every possible nook and cranny of a
dorm. Have fun taping your flyers to the
doors of random strangers — they'll appre
ciate your care and attention. Also, make
sure you hit freshman dorms the hardest.
Freshmen vote the most because they don't
know yet that candidates won't keep their
promises.
If your helper-friends are of your sex, be
prepared to enter bathrooms designated for
the other gender. If you are male, this can be
a pleasant experience, though it may evoke
some envy. If you are female, prepare to
have your sheltered, idyllic perception of the
world shattered.
Friends flyering for you is better than
with you. Not only does this leave you less
work, but it also gives you an excuse to post
flyers in restricted places. You may have at
tended the meetings that said to only flyer
on bulletin boards, bathroom stalls and uri
nals, but your friends didn't! Hey, they didn't
know any better, right?
Meet the people:
Are you sure you finished flyering?
The results:
If you lose, make the electorate regret
their decision by drinking yourself into an
uncontrollable rage of destruction. If you
win, celebrate by drinking yourself into an
uncontrollable rage of destruction.
Take down your 1000 flyers. (You may
want to still be in your uncontrollable rage of
destruction when you do this.)

ements. First and most impoitantly is your
name. Write it big. For instance: AARON
QAYUMI. Second is the catchy slogan. The
slogan (preferably rhyming) should be easy
to remember and as meaningless as possible.
Though catchiness is important, don't stress
out too much about it. Remember that your
slogan will be read over and over by people
in bathrooms, so it will probably get stuck in
their heads anyway. Finally, it doesn't hurt to
include your vapid platforms and endorse
ment loyalties.
Production: Make copies. A lot of
copies. Head to your local copy store and
choose the most brightly colored paper
possible. Your flyer must singe its image

into its viewers' retinas: If the paper doesn't
have warning labels saying it may cause
epilepsy and should not be viewed by preg
nant women, then it isn't bright enough.
Make 1000 copies.
Recruiting: You now have a massive
amount of eye-catching flyers to distribute.
Distribution will consist of you flyering and
your friends flyering for/with you. If your
friends seem hesitant to assist you, remind
them of all the times you've helped them
out.Then say,"l thought we were friends" or
"And you were so close to being my best
friend." If this doesn't work, start crying vio
lently. This will work even better if you're
male (trust me).
Distribution: Hopefully you managed to
recruit some friends to help you flyer all over
campus. Your friends will either flyer for you
or with you.
If your friends flyer with you, they can
hold the flyers while you tape/staple them
in every possible nook and cranny of a
dorm. Have fun taping your flyers to the
doors of random strangers — they'll appre
ciate your care and attention. Also, make
sure you hit freshman dorms the hardest.
Freshmen vote the most because they don't
know yet that candidates won't keep their
promises.
If your helper-friends are of your sex, be
prepared to enter bathrooms designated for
the other gender. If you are male, this can be
a pleasant experience, though it may evoke
some envy. If you are female, prepare to
have your sheltered, idyllic perception of the
world shattered.
Friends flyering for you is better than
with you. Not only does this leave you less
work, but it also gives you an excuse to post
flyers in restricted places. You may have at
tended the meetings that said to only flyer
on bulletin boards, bathroom stalls and uri
nals, but your friends didn't! Hey, they didn't
know any better, right?
Meet the people:
Are you sure you finished flyering?
The results:
If you lose, make the electorate regret
their decision by drinking yourself into an
uncontrollable rage of destruction. If you
win, celebrate by drinking yourself into an
uncontrollable rage of destruction.
Take down your 1000 flyers. (You may
want to still be in your uncontrollable rage of
destruction when you do this.)
