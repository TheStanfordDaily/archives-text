# Spring Break: FREEEEDOM!
## 
### 
I went to Scotland for my spring break. All
my friends wanted to go someplace with
sun and girls baked like lays, girls laid
while they're being baked, girl bakers eating
lays, etc. Somehow they didn't see the appeal
of stormy weather, near-freezing tempera
tures and more sheep than a Yankee fan base.
Philistines.
I, however, decided to go on a journey of
self-exploration and deep mental reflection.
This, of course, could only be accomplished
while wearing a plaid skirt thingy. Actually,
it's a kilt. And though I've made jokes about
my Scottish heritage in the past, and now
have a lot more fodder for the future, I do re
spect the kilt, the claymore, the highland
dance and even the football fanatics. The
haggis, however, is my people's skeleton in
the closet. I have no defense for it except to
distract you with a joke about how the Irish
drink a lot.
The Scots are a really open and friendly
people. If America is a pizza, topped with the
hot sausage of intolerance and fundamental
ism on a bed of cheesy patriotism, Scotland is
haggis: stuffed full of love with an open cen
ter and wrapped in, uh, cow's stomach.
Why visit Scotland you might ask? Well
I'm a big believer in imagery. So if most peo
ple picture their spring break revolving
around sipping a fruity drink and girls with
low esteem, instead I have a picture in my
mind of a newswoman speaking with a warm
brogue while wrapping up the evening's
"Highlander News," her business-suited
arms showing little effort as she tosses a tree
trunk. Caber-tossing anchorwoman â€” not
just a great band name,but what I envisioned
Scotland to hold.
Upon arriving at the old farm, my Scottish
relatives dismissed this vision. I'm a great

deal Scottish and I wanted to trace the fami
ly lines. I accomplished this (thanks Jim and
Liz) and I even got to see the old family tree.
I'll admit, though. I was a bit disappointed.
My lineage has ties to several clans and yet I
didn't see anybody named Angus the
Scourge or Caelan the Slayer King. I really
was hoping for a long history of frightening
warrior kings for me to emulate. Instead I got
Annie Lennox. Yes, my family is made up of
farmers, highlanders and gender-crossing
Eurhythmic singers. Explains a lot, doesn't
it?
It was interesting viewing another societal
system and governing body.The Scottish gov
ernment is a multi-party system. Instead of
elections, parliament members kick a sphe
roid around a grass field to score votes. Thus,
the Scots are really into politics, and their
elections are broadcast daily. The general
election takes about six months and the win
ning party is allowed to riot and ransack their
constituency. Instead of donkeys and ele
phants to denote political affiliation, each
party wears different scarves, but not the ef
feminate French kind. So really, J.K. Rowl
ing's quidditch games were a metaphor for
Scottish politics: they both don't have a
point.
With all this scarf-wearing electioneering,
people somehow don't have time to own

guns and the crime rate is comparatively
lower. People are open and courteous, at
tracting foreigners from all over the world to
their universities. Though there is still some
religious rivalry, people are generally very
tolerant of other peoples' beliefs. They are
pro-European, pro-civil unions and pro-Arc
tic Monkeys. I was talking with sheep farmers
in rural Scotland, not radical San Francisco
liberals, and I found some of the most open
people in the world. They smile and with
their cheery accent, everything sounds like
they are talking about puppies and unicorns
and fairy dust, even when they mock our sad
imitation of a world leader who they
adorably pronounce "boosh."They made me
feel like the U.S. is the most advanced back
ward country on the planet.
It should say something that if you walk
around Europe right now, it's better to wear
a maple leaf. The Scots love the Canucks.
They ask me routinely about the Canadians,
like I was some rebellious kid brother and
look how Canada was getting straight A's and
is captain of the hockey team and why can't I
be like him? They ask me what Americans
think of the Canucks, and I tell them that we
usually don't. To Europeans, Canada is actu
ally a legitimate nation, where we are right
now somewhere between Disneyland and
Greenland in terms of political respectabili
ty. 1 routinely was forced to qualify the state
ment "I'm an American" with "I'm from Cal
ifornia." They smile and they nod then and
it's like I just said the secret password. I'm
confident there are signs all over Europe that
has a list of American states that says "not
assholes."
For a minute there it felt nice to see the

world through different eyes and
breathe the Scottish air and think:
there is hope for America yet.
Maybe we should all learn to speak
with a brogue. And toss cabers.
Maybe there's something in this
haggis thing after a 11....

Chris would like to thank his extend
ed family for their generosity and their
good humour.
