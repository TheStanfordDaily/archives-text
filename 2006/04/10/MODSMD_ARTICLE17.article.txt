## An ASSU president reflects on her term 
### MELANIE KANNOKADA 
Around this time last year, I was posting
Kannokada/Okonkwo flyers all over cam
pus. fighting for my sliver of space at White
Plaza. I have vague memories of brawls
breaking out over who got first dibs on the
birdcage for their banner. This year, as 1
watched people try to tape flyers up in vain
(the Chappie had already sprayed Crisco
everywhere, foiling the efforts of candidates
campuswide), I suddenly appreciated the
benefits of being the outgoing ASSU presi
dent.
1 remember when first coming into this
office, someone asked me what "big thing" I
was going to do during my term. How would
I leave my mark? I didn't know what to say.
The truth is, even if you ask me now, I don't
think I could name one activity that defines
my term. If you really devote yourself to
supporting student issues, you have to be
satisfied with the fact that your mark is actu

ally spread out over dozens different ac
complishments.
Sometimes you're able to affect five peo
ple, sometimes 500, but however few you
help is still a few more than zero. Whether
you are raising money for Club Sports or
promoting graduate and faculty diversity,
representing every student is what this job is
all about.
To truly work for the students, an ASSU
executive can't just worry about getting
everyone on campus to remember your
name. 1 mean, you could do that, but then
how are you really helping Stanford stu
dents now and Stanford students yet to
come? Sometimes you have to sacrifice the
glory for practicality. A lot of the things we
accomplish — even some of the most sub
stantial ones — happen without much of
the campus really finding out about it.
We try to keep students posted on what's
happening, but it become tough as projects
pile up. In fact, we have so many ongoing is

sues that I almost wish we had another year
(or five) to work.
The term goes by so quickly. As soon as
you figure out how the administration
works and you start getting a feel for your
job. it's already Spring Quarter and election
season. I wish in the beginning of my term
that we could have spent less time retracing
old steps and more time building on what
others had already accomplished. Hopeful
ly, the transition for next year's slate will
provide them with that knowledge.
1 encourage you, the future ASSU execu
tives, to keep the student focus at the fore
front of your agenda. Don't stop working on
important issues just because they're long
term — if we can ever create positive
change, we should. It's also crucial to keep a
good working relationship with the Univer
sity. If we didn't have the support of admin
istrators like Jeff Wachtel or Vice Provost
