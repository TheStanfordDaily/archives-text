In his last column ("Guilt by
association," Apr. 6), Jeremy Ja
cobs states that athletic buses
and dorms at Duke University
had been set on fire. An athletic
bus did catch on fire, but it was
caused by a mechanical mal
function and no one was on
board. No dorms have been set
on fire.
In an article published last
Friday ("Juggling books with
babies," Apr. 7), a chemistry
graduate student stated that
there are no women faculty
members in the department, ex
cept for one, Professor Wray
Huestis, who no longer does re
search. There is in fact one other
woman faculty member in the
department. Professor Jennifer
Kohler.
