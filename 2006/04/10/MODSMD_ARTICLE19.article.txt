# Apology
## 
### 
We apologize for last Fri
day's article on the upcoming
event organized by Friends of
South Asia (FOSA) ("Leftist
speaker sparks debate," Apr. 7).
FOSA does not have any ties to
Communist or terrorist groups.
We should not have made such
allegations on the basis of a sin
gle anonymous source. We also
apologize to Prof. Biju Mathew
for associating him in any way
with the Unabomber and other
extremist elements.
