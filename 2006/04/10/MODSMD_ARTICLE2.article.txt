# ASSU candidates pulling all-nighters
## The 						online campaign: "Beam me up, Scotty." 
### AMIT ARORA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With ASSU and GSC elections
scheduled to begin this Wednesday,
on-campus campaigning rose to new
levels of intensity over the weekend.
As flyers cover White Plaza, dorm
lounges and bathrooms, candidates
look to attract thousands of Stanford
students to online polls over the
week.
With 36 candidates vying for 15
positions in the Undergraduate Sen
ate, publicity has been an essential
component in the race. Candidates
have applied a number of strategies
to make their platforms memorable
to students.
Sophomore Danny Arbeiter,
deputy chair of the current Under
graduate Senate, is running for re
election and has established himself
in the race with the slogan: "Don't
pull an all-nighter, vote Danny Ar
beiter."
Meanwhile freshman Anuraag
Chigurupati, frosh council president,
looks to secure a seat with the motto
"Vote Chigurupati...beam me up,
Scotty."
Some have also made references
to national politics in an effort to at
tract more students. Junior Nikhil
Sachdev quoted U.S. Senator Barack
Obama (D-Ill.) to highlight their sim
ilarities.
"Do we participate in a politics of
cynicism, or do we participate in a
politics of hope...the hope of a skinny

kid with a funny name who believes
that America has a place for him.
too." Obama said.
As in every election, dark horse
candidates look to affect the race. Al
though junior Adam Cohen has not
received backing by a major student
group on campus, his endorsement by
the American Pirate Association anil
Chuck Norris may prove consequen
tial.
Undergraduates will also vote for
their class presidents in the upcoming
election.Two slates are running in the
senior and junior class races, respec
tively, and four slates will compete for
the sophomore class presidency.
The Executive Slates continue to
fight to attract students to their cam
paigns. The Rillera/Nguyen slate has
been active in posting flyers and in
formation about their platform. Hie
juniors have also created a Web site
(www.rno6.com) to describe their
slate.
Meanwhile, juniors Elizabeth
Heng and Lauren Graham have de
veloped their own Web site
(www.ASSUExec.com) and created
campaign ads for the tables in the
dining halls.
Students across campus said they
have found the campaigning to be ex
tensive. Freshman James Vaughan
described the effect that campaigning
has had on his decision to vote.
"When considering who to vote
for. many of the platforms are re
markably similar," he said. "The ef
fectiveness of the campaigns then has
to be taken into account. The efforts
of the Heng with Graham slate have

shown a degree of professionalism
and drive that I would like to see in
my ASSU executives."
In addition to the Senate, Council,
and Executive Slate races, under
graduate students will have the op
portunity to vote on Measure A, a
proposition that would raise the Pro
gramming and Community Service
General Fee. The fee, currently
$16.40 per student per quarter,
would increase by 10 percent to ac
commodate for the increased needs
of the 122 student groups on campus.
While the undergraduate races
appear to he close, the Graduate Stu
dent Council (GSC) election is less

contested.
Few have applied for a position
on the Council, and some races have
already been decided, as only one
candidate will appear on the ballot
for the respective graduate school.
The Engineering and Law School
races each hold three candidates,
however.
With the turnout in ASSU elec
tions relatively low over the past few
years, this year's campaigns look to
increase voter turnout. To provide
students with information about the
candidates, the ASSU has created an
online elections handbook
(http://elections.stanford.edu/hand
book). The ASSU is also hosting a
special fees fair in White Plaza today
from 11-1, an executive slate debate
at the CoHo at 7:00 p.m. tonight, and
Speed Dating with the candidates at
8:30 p.m. at Stern on TUesday.
