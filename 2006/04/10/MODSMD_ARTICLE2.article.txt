## The
						online campaign: "Beam me up, Scotty." 
### AMIT ARORA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With ASSU and GSC elections
scheduled to begin this Wednesday,
on-campus campaigning rose to new
levels of intensity over the weekend.
As flyers cover White Plaza, dorm
lounges and bathrooms, candidates
look to attract thousands of Stanford
students to online polls over the
week.
With 36 candidates vying for 15
positions in the Undergraduate Sen
ate, publicity has been an essential
component in the race. Candidates
have applied a number of strategies
to make their platforms memorable
to students.
Sophomore Danny Arbeiter,
deputy chair of the current Under
graduate Senate, is running for re
election and has established himself
in the race with the slogan: "Don't
pull an all-nighter, vote Danny Ar
beiter."
Meanwhile freshman Anuraag
Chigurupati, frosh council president,
looks to secure a seat with the motto
"Vote Chigurupati...beam me up,
Scotty."
Some have also made references
to national politics in an effort to at
tract more students. Junior Nikhil
Sachdev quoted U.S. Senator Barack
Obama (D-Ill.) to highlight their sim

"Do we participate in a politics of
cynicism, or do we participate in a
politics of hope...the hope of a skinny

kid with a funny name who believes
that America has a place for him.

As in every election, dark horse

received backing by a major student
group on campus, his endorsement by
the American Pirate Association anil
Chuck Norris may prove consequen
tial.
Undergraduates will also vote for
their class presidents in the upcoming
election.Two slates are running in the
senior and junior class races, respec
tively, and four slates will compete for
the sophomore class presidency.
The Executive Slates continue to
fight to attract students to their cam
paigns. The Rillera/Nguyen slate has
been active in posting flyers and in
formation about their platform. Hie
juniors have also created a Web site
(www.rno6.com) to describe their
slate.
Meanwhile, juniors Elizabeth
Heng and Lauren Graham have de
veloped their own Web site
(www.ASSUExec.com) and created
campaign ads for the tables in the
dining halls.
Students across campus said they
have found the campaigning to be ex
tensive. Freshman James Vaughan
described the effect that campaigning
has had on his decision to vote.
"When considering who to vote
for. many of the platforms are re
markably similar," he said. "The ef
fectiveness of the campaigns then has
to be taken into account. The efforts

Seemingly every candidate has flyered White Plaza in the past few days. Both executive slates have developed their own campaign web sites to detail their plat
