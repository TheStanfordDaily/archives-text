Leftist rhetoric is misplaced
and misleading
What's up with the Cold War jar
gon? And what's up with using a
single anonymous source to dis
credit an organization? That does
n't sound like credible journalism
to me. But what do I know — I'm
just a graduate student, right?
Patrick Leahy's article ("Leftist
speaker sparks debate," Apr. 7)
slamming the Friends of South Asia
(FOSA) event on the exploitation
of taxi drivers in NYC uses terms
like "leftist" and "Communist" in a
fabulous, uninformed way that
makes me all nostalgic for the
"Rocky" movies.
Remember those?
Evil Russian communist boxers
duking it out with Sylvester Stal
lone, that paragon of glorious mar
ket capitalism, who won out in the
end because, by golly, the man had
heart. Cold War logic died when
those films were released on DVD.

The truth is, the terms "leftist"
and "Communist" have very specif
ic meanings in a contemporary
South Asian context, meanings so
different from those used during
the American Cold War that no
number of "Rocky" film viewings
will give you any clue about the
kind of politics they plug into, for
example, in India. Leahy throws the
terms around as if he were in the
ring with Rocky, sparring with a fa
miliar enemy.
Worse still, he uses the terms to
discredit an organization that he
clearly knows nothing about — be
sides, of course, that one conversa
tion with the anonymous source. If
Leahy doesn't do his research, does
he expect his readers to do it for
him? Leahy seems intent on dis
couraging readers from believing
in the credibility and integrity of
the Daily.
