## Baseball finds offense, downs San Jose State, 13-3 Domaracki proves himself worthy of starting spot with decisive HR 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
For the first time this season, Coach Mark Mar
quess decided to pencil sophomore Brendan Do
maracki into the starting lineup. When the sixth in
ning rolled around with the Cardinal (14-11,2-4 Pac
-10) leading the San Jose State Spartans (22-14) by a
score of 4-2, the move paid off.
The reserve outfielder, batting eighth in the Stan
ford order, stepped to the plate with runners on first
and third and promptly delivered a clutch three-run
homerun that broke the game wide-open for the Car
dinal. Domaracki's blast keyed the deciding rally of
the game, as Stanford plated two more runs in the in
ning to stretch its lead to a comfortable six-run margin.
"[He] has really worked hard," Marquess said of
Domaracki's approach to his role on the team. "His
home run was a huge hit for us and really gave us a
good lead."
Backed by solid pitching, the Cardinal were able
to make that lead stand up and came away with a 13-
3 victory over the Spartans on Saturday.
The team's ability to reach a double-figure run
total was particularly encouraging in the wake of last

weekend's offensive struggles. After winning the
Saturday afternoon opener against the visiting USC
Trojans, the Cardinal were limited to just one run
over the final 21 innings of the weekend in two con
secutive losses.
"It was nice that we hit," Marquess said of his
team's offensive turnaround. "We really needed
that."
Eight out of Stanford's nine starters collected at
least one hit on the day, but it was senior catcher John
Hester and senior shortstop Chris Minaker who lead
the Cardinal onslaught. Hester moved up to second
in the lineup and went 4-for-5 with a pair of doubles,
two runs scored and two RBI, while Minaker dou
bled twice, homered and drove in four. Domaracki
went 2-for-4 with three RBI before being replaced by
pinchrunner Jim Rapoport in the top of the seventh.
With their performance against the Spartans, the
Cardinal set single-game season highs in hits (18),
doubles (7), RBI (13) and total bases (33), while tying
previous highs for runs scored (13) and homeruns (2).
But the effort of the Cardinal pitching staff was
also worthy of note. Senior starter Greg Reynolds
surrendered two runs early, but he settled down to
finish his outing with four strong scoreless frames. In
six innings, the righthander scattered three hits,
while striking out six and walking just one. A trio of

underclassman — sophomores Erik
Davis and Nolan Gallagher, and
freshman Jeremy Bleich — closed
out the victory with a combined
three solid innings of relief work.
"Greg pitched well and did a
good job," Marquess said ." 11 was big
for us to get a win."
Extra Innings: Tonight's scheduled
game at Santa Clara has been can
celled while Santa Clara makes up
the final game of a WCC Confer
ence series against Gonzaga in
Spokane. Wash. Instead, the Cardi
nal will host Pacific tonight at 6:00
p.m., in a make-up of last week's
postponed game.

For the first time this season, Coach Mark Mar
quess decided to pencil sophomore Brendan Do
maracki into the starting lineup. When the sixth in
ning rolled around with the Cardinal (14-11,2-4 Pac
-10) leading the San Jose State Spartans (22-14) by a
score of 4-2, the move paid off.
The reserve outfielder, batting eighth in the Stan
ford order, stepped to the plate with runners on first
and third and promptly delivered a clutch three-run
homerun that broke the game wide-open for the Car
dinal. Domaracki's blast keyed the deciding rally of
the game, as Stanford plated two more runs in the in
ning to stretch its lead to a comfortable six-run margin.
"[He] has really worked hard," Marquess said of
Domaracki's approach to his role on the team. "His
home run was a huge hit for us and really gave us a
good lead."
Backed by solid pitching, the Cardinal were able
to make that lead stand up and came away with a 13-
3 victory over the Spartans on Saturday.
The team's ability to reach a double-figure run
total was particularly encouraging in the wake of last

weekend's offensive struggles. After winning the
Saturday afternoon opener against the visiting USC
Trojans, the Cardinal were limited to just one run
over the final 21 innings of the weekend in two con
secutive losses.
"It was nice that we hit," Marquess said of his
team's offensive turnaround. "We really needed
that."
Eight out of Stanford's nine starters collected at
least one hit on the day, but it was senior catcher John
Hester and senior shortstop Chris Minaker who lead
the Cardinal onslaught. Hester moved up to second
in the lineup and went 4-for-5 with a pair of doubles,
two runs scored and two RBI, while Minaker dou
bled twice, homered and drove in four. Domaracki
went 2-for-4 with three RBI before being replaced by
pinchrunner Jim Rapoport in the top of the seventh.
With their performance against the Spartans, the
Cardinal set single-game season highs in hits (18),
doubles (7), RBI (13) and total bases (33), while tying
previous highs for runs scored (13) and homeruns (2).
But the effort of the Cardinal pitching staff was
also worthy of note. Senior starter Greg Reynolds
surrendered two runs early, but he settled down to
finish his outing with four strong scoreless frames. In
six innings, the righthander scattered three hits,
while striking out six and walking just one. A trio of

underclassman — sophomores Erik
Davis and Nolan Gallagher, and
freshman Jeremy Bleich — closed
out the victory with a combined
three solid innings of relief work.
"Greg pitched well and did a
good job," Marquess said ." 11 was big
for us to get a win."
Extra Innings: Tonight's scheduled
game at Santa Clara has been can
celled while Santa Clara makes up
the final game of a WCC Confer
ence series against Gonzaga in
Spokane. Wash. Instead, the Cardi
nal will host Pacific tonight at 6:00
p.m., in a make-up of last week's
postponed game.
