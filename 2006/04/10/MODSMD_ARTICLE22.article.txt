# Softball splits with Oregon, beats No. 6 Oregon State
## 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
It may be cliched, but it is nonetheless true — in
Pac-10 softball, anything can happen. In the na
tion's most competitive conference. No. 8 Stanford
knocked off No. 6 Oregon State before splitting two
games with Oregon, the only Pac-10 team not in the
Top 15.
The Cardinal (29-7,3-3 Pac-10) beat the Beavers
(29-6,2-4) with a single in the bottom of the seventh
Friday and won Saturday against the Ducks (18-13,
1-3) with freshman Missy Penna's first career grand
slam, by a 7-3 margin. Stanford struggled Sunday
and Oregon took advantage with a six-run rally in
the fourth inning en route to a 9-2 win.
"1 think we played well on Friday, we played very
well on Saturday and then obviously today we did
not bring our A-game," head coach John Rittman
said. "We need to find a way to finish the weekend
strong, because the last two Sundays, we have not
played very well."
On the road a week ago, Stanford barely lost to
No. 3 UCLA and beat No. 14 Washington in a tight
game before losing 8-0 to the Huskies to close out
the weekend.This weekend, the Cardinal outscored
their opponents 10-5 in the first two games, but gave
up nine runs to the Ducks on Sunday.
Penna led the way on offense and defense
throughout the weekend, going 4-for-9 with five
RBI and striking out 10 batters in 17 and 2/3 innings
— including consecutive complete game wins on
Friday and Saturday. Penna now has a season
record of 18-3. Senior centerfielder Catalina Morris
was 4-for-8 at the plate, maintaining her team-best
.395 batting average.
Playing in wind and rain that did not let up, the
Cardinal pulled off the upset of the Beavers when a
single by sophomore first baseman Erin Howe
broke a 2-2 tie in the bottom of the seventh inning.
The Cardinal got on the board first with sopho
more rightfielder Anna Beardman's RBI triple to
score Howe. Senior Catalina Morris' sacrifice bunt
then plated Beardman when the first baseman
badly overthrew third base.
The Beavers answered in the top of the fourth
with two runs of their own on a two-RBI double by
catcher Lisa Allen.
The tie held into the seventh, but the Cardinal

batters wore down OSU's ace pitcher Brianne Mc-
Gowan (17-4,1.35 ERA) and managed to load the
bases with only one out in the bottom of the sev
enth. Howe hit a single into rightfield to score sen
ior pinch runner Shoney Hixson for the winning
run.
Howe was 2-for-3 at the plate with an RBI and a
run scored and Beardman hit l-for-2 with a run and
an RBI as well. Penna pitched a complete game,
striking out three in seven innings. McGowan
struck out four Cardinal batters and gave up two
earned runs in only her third loss of the season.
Under unfamiliarly sunny skies, the Cardinal
held off a surprisingly tenacious Oregon squad Sat
urday, putting the Ducks away with Penna's sixth
inning grand slam.
The Cardinal looked to be in control through the
fifth inning with a 2-0 advantage, but Oregon's
Lovena Chaput jumped on a Penna fastball right
over the plate and sent it out of the park for a three
runs and the lead.
Penna made up for her mistake in the sixth
though, clearing the bases with a shot to centerfield.
Coon had tied the game at three with an RBI to
score Morris and the Cardinal loaded the bases.
The Cardinal held onto their lead through the
seventh and took the 7-3 win. Penna was l-for-3 at
the plate with four RBI and struck out three batters
in her second straight complete game win.
The Ducks scored the first run Sunday when
Suzie Barnes smacked a triple to rightfield and then
came home on a sacrifice bunt in the third inning.
Kayleen Hudson led off the fourth with a solo blast
to make it 2-0 in Oregon's favor.
Senior pitcher Laura Severson came in to relieve
Penna in the fourth inning with two on base. She
gave up an RBI single to the first batter she faced
then loaded the bases. Breanne Sabol hit a two-out
bases-loaded triple and Hudson, batting for the sec
ond time in the fourth inning, singled to center for
another RBI.
Stanford picked off Hudson at first to end the in
ning, but the damage had been done, with Oregon
leading 7-0.
"Give Oregon a lot of credit," Rittman said.
"They had some kids who came up and really had
some good games. And their pitcher kept us off-bal-

ance. Early in the game, it seemed
like everything we hit was right at
somebody, and everything they 1 hit
was in a hole or a gap."
Hie Cardinal had opportunities
to catch up with the Ducks, but could
not convert, leaving at least two run
ners on base in four of the seven in
nings.
"We really need to make sure we
play good defense and then work on
timely hitting," Rittman said. "We
left nine runners on base today and
we need to do better getting those
timely hits."
