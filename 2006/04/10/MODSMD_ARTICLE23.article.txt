# Colleges teach sports and class, but life?

America loves its sports, and D-I athletes
know it.
Still, whether it is the pressure of having to
perform or the fame that accompanies per
formance, athletes crack. For some reason, if
even for just a second, some athletes feel com
pelled to disobey normal rules of conduct.
George Mason's run this season earned
them a spot in the history books. This does not
mean it is okay for star shooting guard Tony
Skinn to punch a fellow athlete in the nuts — as
he did in the semifinal game of the CAA tour
nament against Hofstra.
Skinn's assault went virtually unpunished —
he was slapped with a one-game suspension by
his team.
"In the heat of a tense game, I lost my head
and made a bad decision," Skinn said. "I'm not
making excuses for my actions and I take full
responsibility for what I did."
Apologies aside, imagine if Janet Jackson had
lost her nerve during the Super Bowl halftime
show and punched Justin Timberlake in the balls.
She would have been kicked off this planet. As it
is, parents everywhere are continually united
against her over a year later because she showed
her breast for a fraction of a second on TV.
Tony Skinn, on the other hand, is now part of
the best Cinderella story this side of "Hoosiers"
just weeks after his cheap shot. Maybe people
do not look down on such behavior, but leading
your team to the Final Four is certainly more
important in our societal ethos.
Even here on our perfect Stanford campus,
athletes seem to have issues when it comes to
respecting others.
And I'm not even talking about the scandal
earlier this year when the football team
brought recruits to strip clubs and paid for it
using Athletic-Department money.
No, I'm referring to an issue regarding a
handful of football players who allegedly sexu
ally harassed aTri-Delt in Larkin a couple years
ago.The criminal case resulted in a compromise
in which the football players got only a slap on
the wrist by being charged with serving alcohol
to minors.
Now here is the painful part: despite the fact
that the athletes were convicted of a crime (al
beit a minor one), the Assistant Athletic Direc
tor stated that the Athletic Department im
posed no penalties against the players.
Tim Morris cannot play basketball for an en
tire season because he cannot keep up with a
medical-school-driven Humßio curve, yet the
football team can break the law and not even
have to run laps for it. The "playas" probably
even got a wink and a slap on the butt.
Which brings us to the question: what is a
student-athlete?
Well, to most Division-I schools, a student
athlete is a machine recruited to perform in
sports.
To Stanford's credit, the Farm is one of far
too few places across the D-I landscape where
student-athletes are also expected to maintain
a certain academic standard.
But really, universities need to take the next
step. Amidst all the care about how athletes
fare on the playing fields and in the classroom,
we seem to have lost sight of the larger picture.
Isn't time we started caring about how our
athletes were living their lives?
