# Women's tennis runs dual-match streak to 76 straight
## 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
When the women's tennis team traveled to
southern California to play the LA schools in
February, the trip was marked by rain delays,
gripping drama and nailbitingly close matches.
It was a different story this past weekend,
when the top-ranked Cardinal (20-0,7-0 Pac
-10) convincingly crushed both No. 10 UCLA
and No. 4 Southern California, 7-0 and 6-1, re
spectively.
Despite weather concerns, the sun came
out for Friday's match against UCLA (12-4,4-
2) and Saturday's match against USC (13-3,4-
1), allowing the Cardinal to reassert their
dominance after a near-loss to Pepperdine
over spring break.
"Good thing the weather pulled through
for us, because those were important matches
to get under our belts to build more confi
dence with leading up to the big tournaments
that are coming up," sophomore Lejla Hodzic
said. "This past weekend's matches were one
of the biggest of the season, despite the lop
sided scores."
Hodzic was integrated into the singles line
up for Friday's match against UCLA, and
handily defeated Elizabeth Lumpkin at the
No. 6 spot, 6-2,6-0. Her match was the quick
est of the day.
"I was very pumped up to play and was de
termined to be the first one off the court," she
said. "I think overall everyone was much
more alert and energized playing the LA
schools at home, and we really wanted to
show what we are capable of."
Stanford won five of the six singles match

es in two sets. UCLA's Riza Zalameda took
senior Alice Barnes to three sets on the sec
ond court, but Barnes emerged with the win,
6-4,4-6,1-0(10-5).
Stanford also swept doubles to start the
match, setting the tone for the rest of the day.
It started to rain just as singles was wrapping
up and the Bruins were packing up in defeat.
There was no raining on Stanford's domi
nation of USC, however. While the Cardinal
lost the doubles point to the Women of Troy
earlier this season, the team swept on all three
courts this time around.
"1 think the doubles was key today," Barnes
said. "We lost the doubles point last time, and
to turn it around and sweep them 3-0 this time,
that must have been crushing for them."
Stanford used that momentum to claim five
of the singles matches, four of which were won
in two sets. No. 7 junior Theresa Logar lost her
first set to USCs No. 49 Luana Magnani, 3-6,
but then came back to decisively win the next
two sets, 6-1,6-1 at the No. 3 position. Anca
Anastasiu of USC beat sophomore Whitney
Deason on the fifth court, 6-7,6-3,7-6.
The matchup between Barnes and USC's
Amanda Fink drew particular attention. Fink
was forced to forfeit her match against Logar
in Feburary, on grounds of unsportsmanlike
conduct after she was overruled on four line
calls in one day. Saturday, however,she seemed
careful not to make any questionable line calls.
"I tried not to think too much about what
happened at USC," Barnes said about Fink.
"Thinking about something like that will just
take your mind off the tennis. 1 can only judge
