### ROHAN PURANIK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Tonight, the No. 19 Stanford women's lacrosse team will
face UC-Davis in a bid to capture a win in the final home game
of the season and end a three-game losing streak that has left
the squad at just 5-5.
The Cardinal's three recent losses have come against tough
competition: No. 1 Northwestern. No. 19 Dartmouth and No. 5
North Carolina.
On March 25, Stanford fell to the visiting Wildcats, 19-8.
Northwestern raced out to an early lead with Sarah Albrecht's
two goals coming in the first three minutes of the game. The
Wildcats scored five more unanswered goals, until Stanford
freshman midfield/attack Maris Perlman scored with an assist
from junior attack Michelle DeChant at the 14:33 mark.
Goals from DeChant and attack Megan Burker closed the
gap to 7-3. Albrecht and the Wildcats notched four more goals
while Stanford netted three for a halftime score of 11-6.
Northwestern's dominant play continued throughout the
second half with the Wildcats producing eight goals while
Stanford managed just two, one from Burker and one from
junior midfield Liz Piselli.
Northwestern's offense was led by an astounding seven
goals from Albrecht. Burker, Piselli and DeChant scored two
apiece for Stanford.
The squad then traveled to Dartmouth, where sophomore
Daphne Patterson and DeChant each scored a hat trick in a
13-9 loss. The squad turned in a solid performance in the first
half of the game, trailing just 6-5 at the break.
