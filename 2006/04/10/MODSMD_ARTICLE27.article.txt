## 
### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When the Stanford men's tennis team traveled to
SoCal this past weekend, it was hoping to pull a repeat
of February's double victories against UCLA and
Southern California. However, the No. 12 Cardinal
(12-3,3-1 Pac-10) were only able to snag one victory.
No. 11 UCLA (15-4,4-0) handed Stanford a 6-1
defeat at the Los Angeles Tennis Center, making the
Bruins undefeated in the Pac-10 conference. As they
did in February, the Card started the match down 0-
1 after dropping the doubles point.
This time, junior James Pade and freshman Blake
Muller were able to pick up an 8-4 win at the second
doubles position. I lowever, the Stanford losses at
No. 1 and 3 doubles were enough to give the Bruins
the first point of the match.
"I've got to give UCLA credit," head coach John
Whitlinger said. "They came out really raring to go
and never let up the whole match.They kept it going
right into the singles as well, and we couldn't quite
match it [on Friday]."
As singles play commenced, UCLA's No. 82 Chris
Surapol defeated Muller 6-0, 6-1 at the fifth singles
position to make the score 2-0 in favor of the home
team. UCLA's lead increased to 3-0 when No. 14
freshman Matt Bruch had to retire from his match.
Playing at the top singles position. Bruch was trailing
4-6,1 -4 against the nation's top-ranked player, Benjamin
Kohlloeffel, when the freshman forfeited due to injury.
UCLA made the score 4-0 and consequently won
the match at the sixth singles spot when Stanford
sophomore Phil Kao was defeated 6-4,6-2.
Stanford put itself on the scoreboard just a little
too late at the No. 3 singles with senior KC Corkery's
win. No. 24 Corkery earned a straight-set defeat of
No. 78 Mathieu Dehaine, 7-5,6-3. However, the Car
dinal were not able to earn another point on Friday
afternoon as junior James Wan and Pade both

dropped tight split-set matches.
"Our guys were ready, but [the Bruins] came out
and just took it to us," Whitlinger said. "ITiey really
kept us on defense the whole day. Hopefully we'll
play them again somewhere down the road."
Determined not to leave LA with a losing record,
Stanford bounced back on Saturday with a 4-3 defeat
of USC. Bruch's absence left the lineup slightly altered,
but strong enough to earn a win against the Trojans.
"Everybody seems to be a little bit better at
home," Whitlinger said. "It was nice that we could
winagainst USC without one of our better players."
Pade and Muller moved up to the top doubles
spot to win a decisive 8-4 victory. Corkery and Kao
teamed up to fill No. 2 doubles but were dealt an 8-3
defeat. At the finals doubles position, Wan and sen
ior Jon Wong were narrowly edged out, 8-6.
With the Cardinal trailing 0-1, Pade moved to the
top singles position and made quick work of Dejan
Cvetkovic 6-2,6-0 and tied the match count at one
apiece. Muller lost 6-1,6-4 at No. 4 singles to make
the score 2-1 in favor of the Trojans. After winning
the first set at No. 6 singles without giving up so much
as a game, Wong closed out the second set in a
tiebreaker to level the score between the two teams.
"It really helped to see (Pade and Wong's scores]
go up on the board," Whitlinger said. "1 think that
gave other guys a lot of juice. It was a great job by Jon
to step up and be ready to play and get a win at USC.
He lost to (Whit Livingston] when we played USC [in
February] so 1 was really proud of Jon on Saturday."
At the third singles spot. Wan then picked up a 7-
6.6-4 win against Kaes Van't I lof to give the Cardi
nal the lead for the first time that day. After dropping
the first set 4-6, Corkery rebounded to pick up the
second and third sets 6-1. By closing out his three
setter at No. 2 singles, the senior captain gave Stan
ford the four points it needed for the win. Southern
California's Chong Wang then defeated Kao in the
supertiebreaker for the third.
