## Students seek Israeli abroad program Stanford faces State Dept. restrictions in offering programs to certain countries 
### SHIRIN SHARIF SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Next month, the UC Board of Regents will determine
whether to restore study-abroad programs in countries, most
notably Israel, which carry travel warnings from the U.S. State
Department. The impact of the Board's decision may reverber
ate at Stanford, where students are pressing the administration
to circumvent State Dept. policy and offer an overseas seminar
in Israel.
Junior David Cohen, member of the Stanford Israel Alliance,
and ASSU senators Andrew Hendel, a senior, Danny Arbeiter,
a sophomore, met with Bing Overseas Studies Program (BOSP)
director Prof. Norman Naimark this
past fall to discuss the possibility of
the seminar in Israel. While there
was interest from the BOSP office,
University policy does not permit of
ficial travel to countries that carry
government warnings, confirmed by
BOSP executive director Irene
Kennedy.
'"There is no plan afoot for a
[BOSP] program in Israel," Naimark
said. "We continue to think about
the possibility, however."
President Hennessey recently
met with the Israeli General Consul
in San Francisco, which led to specu
lation and some false outside reports
that a Stanford program in Israel
was in the works. But Alan Acosta.
director of University communica
tions, clarified Stanford's interest in
a statement.
"Stanford University is currently
considering a pilot program in which
the University would collaborate
with institutions in other countries
where Stanford students could study
while receiving course credit at Stan
ford," Acosta said the statement. "Is
rael is one of a number of places
under consideration for such a pilot
program, however, we are unlikely to
initiate any undergraduate programs
— temporary or permanent — in
countries that are the subject of U.S.
State Department travel warnings."
Despite the University policy.
Cohen is still pursuing the possibility
of an overseas seminar in Israel, and
he called the obstacles "surmount
able."
In response to possible con
straints placed by the University's
insurance plan and liability issues,
Cohen countered that Stanford
graduate students and faculty mem
bers can travel to Israel if they sign a
waiver. Undergrads from other
schools also have been allowed to
travel to Israel, he said.
Last October, Harvard repealed
its policy of withholding funding and
credit for study, research and travel
in certain countries that the State
Department identifies as risky for
travel. In addition, both Yale and
Brandeis have their own lists of re
stricted countries drawn up by facul
ty committees.
Cohen was undeterred by the
ASSU Senate's lack of solid support

for his cause. Hendel and Arbeiter
sponsored a bill last year to pledge
support for an overseas seminar in
Israel and continued preparation
and planning for the program in the
case that the State Department
warning was repealed, in order to
offer the seminar in September 2(X)6.
Badawi Qawasmi, a graduate
student in civil engineering and
member of the Organization of
Arab Students at Stanford, spoke
against this bill at the Senate meet
ing last June. He argued that be
cause the course would be taught at
an Israeli university the teaching
would likely be one-sided and not
incorporate the Palestinian view
point. The bill was ultimately tabled
on three different occasions to give
senators the opportunity to further
research the matter.
"I think an abroad program in Is
rael is an amazing opportunity," said
junior Lyuba Wolf, also member of
the Stanford Israel Alliance, who
studied abroad in Israel through a
non-Stanford program. "No where
else can you experience such a nexus
of cultures and religions and politi
cal turmoil. Whether one is interest
ed in religion, archeology.political or
security studies, there is no better
place to do it."
The seminar in question would be
titled. "Two Peoples in One Land:
The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict in
Historical and Normative Perspec
tive," and would be taught by Jack
Rakove, professor of history and po
litical science, and earth sciences
prof. Amos Nur. It would emphasize
the origins and varieties of two na
tionalisms, paying attention to de
bates within the Jewish and Palestin
ian communities over the political,
religious and socio-economic charac
ter of the states they wished to form.
Responding to the debate over
possible bias in such a seminar loca
tion. Wolf responded. "Going to Is
rael means interacting not just with
Jews, but also Arab-Israelis. It pro
vides an opportunity see first hand
the complexity of the interaction of
these two peoples that is so often
simplified and stereotyped by cam
pus activists, most of whom have not
experienced it first hand."
Cohen also emphasized the value
of an overseas seminar in Israel.
"For an elite university like Stan
ford. we really should have a pro
gram in Israel," Cohen said. "There's
a lot to study and a lot of people that
want to study there. Hopefully, it will
happen soon."
