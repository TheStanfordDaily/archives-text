Next month, the UC Board of Regents will determine
whether to restore study-abroad programs in countries, most
notably Israel, which carry travel warnings from the U.S. State
Department. The impact of the Board's decision may reverber
ate at Stanford, where students are pressing the administration
to circumvent State Dept. policy and offer an overseas seminar
in Israel.
