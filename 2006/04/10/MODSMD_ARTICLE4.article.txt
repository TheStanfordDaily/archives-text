## CTL revamps oncampus tutoring 
### LESLIE GEORGATOS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) is revamping
its tutoring program to provide better services for students in
both introductory and higher-level classes.
Under the new system, there will be two main kinds of tu
tors. Residential tutors, housed in dorms with mostly freshmen,
will hold office hours aimed primarily at helping students with
introductory courses in popular subjects such as math, chem
istry and physics.
A second group of tutors will be available for individual ap
pointments, offering a span of hours during which students may
call or email to set up one-on-one meetings. In addition to cov
ering introductory courses, tutors will also extend services to
advanced classes targeted at upperclassmen. Among new
courses covered are statistics, engineering, human biology and
computer science.
"We looked at who uses tutoring
and which courses they get help in"
said Adina Glickman, assistant di
rector of peer and academic support
for the Center for Teaching and
Learning. "We found that frosh use a
great deal of the residential tutoring,
far more than upperclassmen. Up
perclassmen tend to go to drop-in
hours once or twice to get a specific
question answered. This is the group
that will probably benefit most from
being able to see tutors by appoint
ment in one-on-one sessions."
Originally, about forty tutors
held regular hours at residence halls.
These office hours tended to focus
on introductory courses in main
stream areas of science and math.
Language tutoring was available by
appointment in Mandarin, French
and Spanish.
Some of the forty tutors were res
idential tutors while the others were

"drop-in" tutors who did not live in
the residences where they worked.
"We found that the drop-in tutors
weren't getting as many tutees be
cause students didn't know they
were there or it was too far to go,"
said Andrea Burbank, student head
of tutor recruitment. "We're making
the program more individual. If you
want tutors, they are available by ap
pointment."
According to Glickman, over
3,(XX) students visit CTL tutors dur
ing the year. With tutoring becoming
more custom-tailored and accessible
through individualized meetings, she
said she expects that number to in
crease. In order to be responsive to
so many students' needs, CTL has
avidly incorporated student com
ments and tracked use of the pro
gram through a database.
"We listened to what students
had to say about what they liked and
didn't like about tutoring," she said.
"We tried to enhance the things they
like and change what they didn't
like.''
"The comment we got the most
was that tutoring office hours were

pretty busy," Burbank said.
The CTL hopes that the new ap
pointment system will alleviate
crowding at office hours and allow
students to get specific questions an
swered more efficiently.
The Center is currently in the
process of hiring the additional tu
tors for the new subject areas.
Despite the perks for tutees, how
ever, the new system also has some
disadvantages for current tutors.
"The downside is that there's no
guarantee that I'll be working four
hours a week,so I am not guaranteed
to make money," said David Scudder,
a junior tutor in chemistry and biolo
gy. "The advantage of the new system
is the more flexible timing. I'll only be
working when people want tutoring."
The CTL Peer TUtoring Program
is not the only resource for students
who want extra academic help be
yond TAs' and professors' office
hours. The Stanford Writing Center,
Math Department and Oral Com
munications are among the variety
of student venues for help in reading,
writing and learning skills.
"Students gravitate to and will

benefit from different kinds of tutor
ing" said Glickman. "We want to
make sure that each student has the
ability to easily connect with the best
resource for his or her needs."
"We found that the most de
mands for tutors are in math or sci
ence based classes; it can be harder
to tutor concepts in other classes,"
Burbank said. "The Writing Center
does a great job with ideas for papers
and other resources for effective
reading."
All of the CTL tutoring programs
are free.
"We feel very strongly that tutor
ing is the responsibility of the institu
tion and we don't want any student
who wants to work with a tutor im
pinged by financial issues" Glick
man said.
So far, the CTL has gotten great
reviews from students.
"The CTL tutor program gets
overwhelmingly high marks from
students in terms of the quality of tu
toring," Glickman said. "In fact,
sometimes our tutors are so popular,
some students wish they had tutors
all to themselves!"
