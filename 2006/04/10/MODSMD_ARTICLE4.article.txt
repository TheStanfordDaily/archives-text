## CTL revamps oncampus tutoring 
### LESLIE GEORGATOS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) is revamping
its tutoring program to provide better services for students in
both introductory and higher-level classes.
Under the new system, there will be two main kinds of tu
tors. Residential tutors, housed in dorms with mostly freshmen,
will hold office hours aimed primarily at helping students with
introductory courses in popular subjects such as math, chem
istry and physics.
A second group of tutors will be available for individual ap
pointments, offering a span of hours during which students may
call or email to set up one-on-one meetings. In addition to cov
ering introductory courses, tutors will also extend services to
advanced classes targeted at upperclassmen. Among new
courses covered are statistics, engineering, human biology and
computer science.
