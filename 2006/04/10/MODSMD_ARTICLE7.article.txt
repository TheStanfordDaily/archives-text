## Stanford Review seeks new policy 
### CHRIS LIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Review will continue to pursue its efforts
to change the door-to-door distribution policy this week in
a meeting with Vice Provost Greg Boardman. Along with
other members of the Stanford publication community.
The Review's Editor-in-Chief Ryan Tracey and Business
Manager Navin Kadaba plan to discuss the University's
distribution policy with Boardman and hopefully reach a
compromise.
The Review has enlisted Robert Corry. a 1994 graduate
of Stanford Law School, to assist them in their dispute
with the University. Recently, the University contacted
Corry, offering a compromise that would consist of con
structing mailboxes in the lobbies of each dorm to hold
Stanford publications. The University would also like The
Review to invest in plastic bags to place on people's door
knobs to avoid safety hazards apparently associated with
door-to-door distribution.
According toTiracey, however, "To us that isn't a solu
tion. Lots of fraternities and sororities that have mailbox
es say that it's not an effective way of getting information
because it's still basically a centralized place. We believe
that individuals should be able to opt out of distribution to
their doors, but we want nothing less than the right to go
to everyone's door and distribute, with no bigger body
than the individual deciding or prohibiting it."
