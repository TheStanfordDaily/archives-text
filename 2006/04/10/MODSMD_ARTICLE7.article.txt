## Stanford Review seeks new policy 
### CHRIS LIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Review will continue to pursue its efforts
to change the door-to-door distribution policy this week in
a meeting with Vice Provost Greg Boardman. Along with
other members of the Stanford publication community.
The Review's Editor-in-Chief Ryan Tracey and Business
Manager Navin Kadaba plan to discuss the University's
distribution policy with Boardman and hopefully reach a
compromise.
The Review has enlisted Robert Corry. a 1994 graduate
of Stanford Law School, to assist them in their dispute
with the University. Recently, the University contacted
Corry, offering a compromise that would consist of con
structing mailboxes in the lobbies of each dorm to hold
Stanford publications. The University would also like The
Review to invest in plastic bags to place on people's door
knobs to avoid safety hazards apparently associated with
door-to-door distribution.
According toTiracey, however, "To us that isn't a solu
tion. Lots of fraternities and sororities that have mailbox
es say that it's not an effective way of getting information
because it's still basically a centralized place. We believe
that individuals should be able to opt out of distribution to
their doors, but we want nothing less than the right to go
to everyone's door and distribute, with no bigger body
than the individual deciding or prohibiting it."
The meeting with Boardman
comes on the heels of the recent rul
ing by the Organization Conduct
Board (OCB). requesting an apology
from The Review to the dorms in
which they violated the University's
door-to-door distribution policy. The
March OCB hearing reviewed the
self-described "civil disobedience"
committed by members of The Re
view, who distributed their publica
tion door-to-door in Soto,Serra,Tran
cos,and Larkin on Jan. 21. Staff of The
Review expressed satisfaction with
the final hearing requirements given
by Associate Dean of Student Affairs
Chris Griffiths, calling them "fairly
light, and not limiting."
The members of The Review staff
were, however, disappointed with the
hearing process and protested sever
al times about what they perceived as
unfair procedures that biased the
hearing against them. One complaint
included the secret nature of the
hearing. Although many other organ
izations in the Stanford publications
community have an activc role in ad
vocating for the right to door-to-door
distribution, members of these organ
izations were not permitted to attend
the hearing.
"At first we thought we had filed a
official petition with Dean Morris
Graves, head of the OCB, that we
wanted this to be open hearing,"
Tracey said. "And the last time we
checked the official student charter,
there's a right to an open hearing.
Morris Graves came back saying/No
you're not guaranteed this because
the OCB is just an advisor to Dean
Griffith.' 1 thought that was kind of a

weird catch to limit our rights as stu
dents."
The Review also expressed dissat
isfaction with the hearing's proce
dure for screening questions to wit
nesses. As the defense. The Review
was required to write each question
down for approval by the chair of the
OCB before the witness could an
swer. In contrast, the hearing placed
few restrictions on what questions
and methods of inquiry members of
the panel could take when eliciting
information from witnesses, mem
bers of The Review said.
"We had a lot of questions that
were really important and really
helped our case," said Tracey. "The
hearing's procedure was blatantly un
fair. I can understand that they might
want to keep the hearing going, but
there was one point that it was really
frustrating — we couldn't ask half of
our questions."
Tracey and The Review staff
protested this procedure during the
hearing, leading to a 45-minute recess
during which the panel discussed
whether The Review should be able
to ask questions without approval.
The panel eventually decided to con
tinue with the same procedure and
continue to filter questions from the
defense.
Administrative officials, including
Griffith and Director of Residential
Education Jane Camarillo, declined
to comment on the details of the
hearing.
Griffith wrote in an email to The
Daily, "My practice, regarding in
quiries about Organization Conduct
Board (OCB) hearings.is to let repre
sentatives of the organization in
volved speak publicly if they choose
to do so. The leadership of the Stan
ford Review can determine what in
formation they want to share more
widely."
