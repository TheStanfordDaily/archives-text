## No Beer, No Pub, No Love 
### 
According to a recent article in
The Daily, there appears to be
some sort of debate over
whether or not the graduate student
pub (also known as the 750) should con
tinue to serve alcohol. Apparently, and
God help those of us who were previ
ously unaware of this situation, certain
anonymous students "would enjoy [the
pub] more and like the atmosphere
more if there wasn't any alcohol."
The article did not mention whether
or not these students would also sup
port changing the name of the pub to
"Zippy the Clown's Playground of Joy"
and having a lollipop jammed in their
retinas, but I think it's a pretty safe bet
to say that they would.
To be honest, I have a lot of difficul
ty believing that these anonymous stu
dents actually exist. I can't imagine
someone saying (or, for that matter,
thinking) something along the lines of,
"You know what this pub really needs?
No drinks." Although it does sort of re
mind me of the time I walked around
saying, "You know what I really need?
No pants" — with disastrous results.
Perhaps I am missing the point.
There is a strong possibility that 1 did
not receive the Moron Memo that says
pubs no longer function as a place for
people to congregate around beer, and
are now simply places for people to con
gregate around food. You can see how I
might be a bit confused because THIS
IS THE EXACT DEFINITION OF A
RESTAURANT So unless this memo
also stated that establishments like Mc-
Donald's will now be serving Frosty
McßeerGulps along with their Happy
Meals, I think it's time to take a step
back and reflect on the level of insanity
this debate reveals.
The solitary purpose of the 750 is to
convince grad students that they, too,
can have meaningful interactions with
other homo sapiens, particularly when
alcohol is available to lessen the sting of
awkward conversation. Take away the
beer and what you have is one fewer
reason for Stanford students to meet, to
talk and yes, to date.
I am by no means suggesting that al
cohol is necessary in order to have a
healthy social life. I know plenty of non
drinkers who are very cool, outgoing
people with lots of friends and interest
ing things to say. Unfortunately, due to a
variety of factors that include general
busyness and lack of previous social ex
perience, the students at Stanford often
need a little incentive to crawl out of
their rooms and engage in a conversa
tion beyond, "Are you having problems
with your Internet? I'm having prob
lems with my Internet."
Furthermore, the pub plays a very
important role on our campus, one that
is sure to expand as students become
more familiar with the establishment. It
is one of the few on-campus facilities
other than the CoHo or the Tteehouse
where people can meet for drinks with
out necessarily meeting for a meal. The
difference may sound trivial, but in the
land of Datingville (population: 25 stu
dents), it's huge. Meeting someone for a
chai latte is not scary. Meeting someone
for sandwiches is. Meeting someone for
a pint of Guinness is not scary. Meeting
someone for semi-upscale food with the
jukebox blasting seven AC/DC songs in
a row while drinking nothing but tepid
Diet Coke is a thought that makes me
want to join a convent. At least nuns get
to listen to good music and drink sacra
mental wine.
In fact, if this university really wanted
to remove the scarlet "A" for Awkward
from the chests of their students, it
would behoove them to create even
more beverage distribution points.
Imagine being able to meet up for a glass
of wine at the bookstore or even fre
quenting some kind of on-campus sake
bar. Stanford would be so much more
social. And hydrated. And possibly a lit
tle tipsy, but hell, we'd be doing grown
up things like talking to the opposite sex.
The bottom line is this: Take away
beer from the 750 and you take away
the tiny atom of hope that graduate stu
dents — and perhaps the undergradu
ates as well — have to develop moder
ately adequate social skills. And I will
have that many fewer incentives to not
rip the jukebox out of the wall if it dares
to play "Highway to Hell" ever again.
