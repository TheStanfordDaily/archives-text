ASSU Executive.-
Heng with Graham
Elizabeth Heng and Lauren Graham are
the best executive slate choice. They appear
well-equipped to achieve the realistic goals
they have set out for themselves.
Heng and Graham plan to have the re
vamped Undergraduate Advising Program
assign two advisers to each incoming fresh
man to create a more consolidated advising
system. They also intend to foster greater in
teraction between student organizations, en
couraging various groups to stretch their
limited funding resources by hosting joint
events.
If elected, Heng and Graham should be
held accountable for their more populist
campaign promises, including their pledge to
make Dead Week actually dead. The pair
should also make good on their promise to
revive the Mausoleum Party next year.
Senior Class Presidents:
Marvel
Both LOUD NOISES!! and MARVEL
promise to deliver everything a senior could
want — greater student input in Commence
ment, mock interviews with the Career De
velopment Center and so forth. Both slates
have members with a great deal of experi
ence in student government. But MARVEL
seems to have a more detailed plan of action,
including rescuing Senior Pub Night and re
ducing restrictions on the selection of Com
mencement speakers.
Junior Class Presidents:
40 Year Old! Juniors
Both junior class slates are running on the
strength of their credentials. The 40 Year Old
Juniors have a more developed plan. But
we're warning you: If we vote for you, we
want to see you execute some of your more
outrageous campaign promises, such as sub
sidized airport shuttles and a dunk tank with
school officials. We can't imagine that many
members of the University administration
would sign up for that event.
Sophomore Class Presidents:
The Golden Ticket
While reading through the platforms for
sophomore class presidents, we were remind
ed of the saying, "All that is necessary for the
triumph of evil is that good men do nothing."
Perhaps the lack of substance present in all of
the sophomore slates won't lead to victory
for the Dark Side, but it certainly bodes ill for
the class next year. iSlate and Tandoori
Chicken and White Bread have based nearly
their entire campaigns on unusual catch
phrases. The real choice for freshmen is be
tween The Cure and The Golden Ticket. Of
the two. The Golden Ticket has better ideas
that are better articulated. They appear to
have taken the time to plan their platform,
which means they are more likely to be dedi
cated to the job. Still, the Class of 2009 de
serves better.
Measure A:
Measure A proposes to raise the Program
ming and Community Service General Fee
by 10 percent. There needs to be more effi
cient ways to channel money into student
organizations than to increase the General
Fee. We would rather pay more in member
ship dues and entrance fees for groups we
are actually involved in. Vote for Measure
A only if you are confident that the money
will be equitably and prudently distributed
to student groups on campus.
Measure B:
AjcC
Measure B concerns the Graduate TYans
portation Fee that funds the Graduate Stu
dent Transportation Board. We see no rea
son why on-campus students should have to
pay to subsidize Caltrain tickets for stu
dents who live off-campus. But because typ
ical graduate student turnout in the ASSU
elections is so abysmally low. graduate stu
dents who commute to school can easily
swing the vote if their on-campus class
mates prove apathetic.
