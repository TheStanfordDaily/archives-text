and well-considered.

Amount requested: $13,074.00

Stanford Axe Committee
Amount requested: $7,569.00
($1.19 per student)
It's not the Axe Committee's fault that Stan

Axe Committee when we have the Dollies
and Band doing pretty much the same thing.

The Film Society deserves to be commended
for channeling most of its special fees into
events that all students can enjoy. Very little

fraction of the price of a regular movie tick
et.
