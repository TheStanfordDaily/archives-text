# SECOND OF A WEEKLY 9 PART SERIES EXAMINING THE GRADUATE PROGRAMS AT EACH OF STANFORD'S SCHOOLS
## WATCH OUT GAIETIES... HERE COMES THE LAW STUDENT MUSICAL 
### MEGAN WATKINS 
Y r ou've definitely heard of liberals and 4
conservatives, and probably even slackers, but
do you know what a gunner or a sniper is? How
about the law student musical? Many of you probably
haven't heard of the production, and while it may seem
like a foreign concept, if you've ever been to Gaieties you
probably have some idea of what it's like. In fact, several
of this year's musical writers were part of Gaieties during
their undergraduate years at Stanford. If you're still un
sure about what to expect, think biting satire, musical en
sembles and caricatures of liberals, slackers and snipers.
According to Co-producer, Co-director and third
year law student Alex Lees, this year's production is
going to be bigger and better than ever.
"Everything in terms of production is being kicked up
at least three notches this year: professional band mem
bers, choreography, set design," he says. "In the past it's
been a series of vignettes, but this year we are introduc
ing relatively new concepts like a continuous plot and
consistent lead characters."
According to Lees, Stanford Law School lore dates
the musical tradition back to the 1950s.The show goes on
every year in the spring, but writing begins as far back as
September. All told, there are 60 people involved in this
year's production and 35 in the cast.
When asked why he decided to take part in this year's
musical. Lees says,"It would be cynical of me to say this
but some would agree that law school saps your soul and
participating in theater and the arts is a way to regain
whatever part is left. And it might also be cynical of me
to say this, but everyone that goes to law school is a bit of
an attention hog."
Third-year law student Stephen Kane, the other co
producer and co-director, enjoys the social nature of the
production and thinks that the musical is important in
building a sense of community.

"Usually
we deal with
something
cathartic so it's good

for the community. Last
year we dropped to num-

ber three in the rankings and
the show was about going back in

time to change [it]," he said.
Although Lees enjoys being involved in the musical,
he's not pinning his hopes on stardom.
"In the end all lawyers are failed actors," he says.
"Whether you're puffing during a negotiation to get a
slightly better deal, or delivering the $20-million closing
arguments to a jury, you're center stage and in the spot
light. You get the rush of performing, you really get to
make an impact, and you don't have the paparazzi
hounding you at your wedding."
And in case you don't end up making it to this year's
show. Lees won't leave you scratching your head over
the term "sniper."
"The sniper is the type of kid who sits in the back â€” you
never know he's there until the one time he needs to shoot,
and he always hits his mark, whether it's on the exam or the
one time he raises his hand in class."
This year's musical will take place on Saturday, April 15
at 8 p.m. in Kresge Auditorium. The producers promise
several high-profile cameos, lots of surprises and some
thing for everyone, even those shy undergrade
