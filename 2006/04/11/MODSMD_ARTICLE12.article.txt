# Taking on the system:
## First-year seeks to change the way Mexico views legal policy 
### MEGAN WATKINS MANAGING EDITOR 
You might think that first-year law students are busy find
ing their footing, but Jorge Luis Silva Mendez has already
jumped into his research with an eye toward changing the
way his country pursues policymaking.
After finishing up his undergraduate education in Mexi
co, Silva Mendez started building a database on firing dis
putes in Mexico's federal labor courts. He plans to use this
database to gather empirical evidence for use in developing
policy and to dispel misconceptions about delays, costs and
terminations in firing disputes.
"Most of the research in Mexico is done from a doctrinal
perspective," he says. "I'm trying to approach this question
from a different perspective. I selected a random sample of
files so I can do a statistical analysis.There are a lot of propos
als that have been made without knowing what is really hap
pening in the courts."
Because he initiated the project before entering law

school, his pursuits influenced his decision about where he
would attend.
"I came to Stanford because the Stanford Program in In
ternational Legal Studies is an interdisciplinary program," he
explains. "From the beginning you can start to work on your
own research project. Most schools are for people who want
to continue as practitioners, not as researchers; that's what's
unique about Stanford."
He adds that the program's small class sizes create a posi
tive dynamic. Ultimately Silva Mendez plans to return to
Mexico in an effort to change the way people think about the
law.
"The big motivation in my studies is that a lot of people
are studying these things in the same way." he says. "There
aren't people who have tried to think about the questions in
a different way to see if what they have thought for years is
what actually happens."
Silva Mendez also notes how his nontraditional academic
path has helped him to think differently from his peers. In
Mexico, students generally enter law school immediately

after high school. Silva Mendez, on the other hand, earned
three bachelor's degrees.
"A particular area of my background is that I've studied
many things so I think 1 have a lot of analytical tools in other
disciplines," he says. "1 have a completely different perspec
tive compared to the other lawyers in my country. Here it is
completely different because people have studied something
else before studying law."
With this unique experience, he hopes to bring a new
focus to law schools in Mexico.
"Legal education in Mexico is not focused on giving you
the tools for viewing law from a different perspective," he
remarks. "Lawyers are not trained in a very analytical way.
This analytical perspective is a very important part of a
legal education. I'm going to go back to Mexico and I'm
going to try to teach some methodological courses for
lawyers. They don't have the tools to understand complex
statistical methods, but they can understand the basic ideas.
It will have a great impact in the way that public policy and
legal proposals are submitted."
