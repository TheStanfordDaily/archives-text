An apology is insufficient
The apology published by the editors of
the Daily for the blatantly racist and slander
ing article by Patrick Leahy ("Leftist speak
er sparks debate," Apr. 7) is not nearly
enough.
The discrimination towards the South
Asian community, labeling FOSA and Biju
Mathew as terrorists, communists, and fun
damentalists all at the same time presents a
complete lack of journalistic integrity. After
reading these articles, I was ashamed to call
myself a student of Stanford University. The
Daily editors and staff should be completely
ashamed at the intolerance they have
spread.
Furthermore, is it really the Daily's place
to present a one-sided argument about the
validity of a political viewpoint? The editors
need to be held accountable for printing this
article. I believe that this atrocity should
show the need for the Daily to work as an
agent for social justice rather than one for
spreading hate. 1 hope that issuing an apolo
gy will be the first step of the editors and
contributing writers of the Daily to engage
in a dialogue about cultural sensitivity. 1 sin
cerely hope that you all attend anti-racist
workshops and will understand that the pub
lic will continue to keep a watchful eye to en
sure that you are providing us with the best
possible source of news and not maligning
the community it intends to serve.

Daily should investigate allegations
I find the portrayal of Prof. Biju Matthew
in last Friday's article ("Leftist speaker

characterize FOSA as an organization that
sympathizes with "Islamist and Communist"

Any organization, no matter its politics,
has its detractors, but to defame an organiza

Article on Prof. Mathew makes
baseless allegations
I am infuriated by the recent article on
Biju Mathew ("Leftist speaker sparks de
bate," Apr. 7).The article counterposes state

ments by an "anonymous protestor" to state
ments by a graduate student who is mostly
forced to defend Mr. Mathew against base
less allegations. The fact that this protestor
refused to identify himself draws doubt on
whether a responsible journalist should pub
lish his comments. It is one thing to use
anonymous sources in order to reveal infor
mation otherwise unavailable. It is quite an
other to give an "anonymous" speaker news
paper space to use as a forum for personally
bashing someone with no evidence to back
their claims. It would be particularly trou
bling if a right-wing organization made the
comments in order to prevent the event from
taking place.
The allegations made by this "anonymous
protestor" are pure slander. The decision to
include them in your article fails any test of
journalistic integrity.The Daily should not be
a supermarket tabloid or a forum for person
al attacks and vague, unsubstantiated allega
tions. It should not be a place for red-baiting,
exploiting racist fears, or dismissing legiti

mate critiques of political economy through
rhetorical devices reminiscent of right-wing
radio talk shows.
The accusation that he is an "Islamic ter
rorist" is simply shocking to see in print.
These are serious accusations. Deciding to
include it in the article was completely irre
sponsible. Second, the statement that immi
grants have no right to voice criticisms of
the United States is baffling. I would like to
know precisely how criticism of neoliberal
economic policy makes an immigrant a
"hypocrite." I am surprised that the article
represented the opinions of right-wing ide
ologues to the exclusion of any other view
points.
The list of outrageous, unsubstantiated al
legations in the short article are long and ob
vious. A serious newspaper simply cannot
claim that a guest speaker "supports] the
Unabomber" based on the hearsay of an
"anonymous protestor."

Daily should not have validated
anonymous source
I was disappointed to read Patrick Leahy's
article ("Leftist speaker sparks debate," Apr.
7) about the planned talk by Biju Mathew, Pro
fessor of Business at Rider University
I attended Prof. Mathew's campus-spon
sored event at UC Berkeley on Wednesday
and enjoyed his talk about the political econ
omy of the New York taxi industry, and the
efforts of taxi drivers to organize. He wasn't
the controversial "leftist speaker with ties to
Communism" that Leahy reported on.
It's unfortunate that the Daily would go
out of its way to loudly trumpet the rantings of
an anonymous correspondent claiming that
Mathew holds "radical political beliefs,"
"help[s] terrorist groups," and
"support[s]...the Unabomber" and "Islamic
terrorists." I wouldn't have expected the Daily
to fall prey to these red-baiting attempts,

sympathizes with "Islamist and Communist"
forces just on the basis of one single protes
tor.
Any organization, no matter its politics,
has its detractors, but to defame an organiza
tion on the basis of unfounded allegations
without investing any time to investigate the
nature of such allegations is utterly irrespon
sible.
I hope the editors would be more judi
cious in the future when it comes to publish
ing such articles.

Article on Prof. Mathew makes
baseless allegations
I am infuriated by the recent article on
Biju Mathew ("Leftist speaker sparks de
bate," Apr. 7).The article counterposes state

ments by an "anonymous protestor" to state
ments by a graduate student who is mostly
forced to defend Mr. Mathew against base
less allegations. The fact that this protestor
refused to identify himself draws doubt on
whether a responsible journalist should pub
lish his comments. It is one thing to use
anonymous sources in order to reveal infor
mation otherwise unavailable. It is quite an
other to give an "anonymous" speaker news
paper space to use as a forum for personally
bashing someone with no evidence to back
their claims. It would be particularly trou
bling if a right-wing organization made the
comments in order to prevent the event from
taking place.
The allegations made by this "anonymous
protestor" are pure slander. The decision to
include them in your article fails any test of
journalistic integrity.The Daily should not be
a supermarket tabloid or a forum for person
al attacks and vague, unsubstantiated allega
tions. It should not be a place for red-baiting,
exploiting racist fears, or dismissing legiti

mate critiques of political economy through
rhetorical devices reminiscent of right-wing
radio talk shows.
The accusation that he is an "Islamic ter
rorist" is simply shocking to see in print.
These are serious accusations. Deciding to
include it in the article was completely irre
sponsible. Second, the statement that immi
grants have no right to voice criticisms of
the United States is baffling. I would like to
know precisely how criticism of neoliberal
economic policy makes an immigrant a
"hypocrite." I am surprised that the article
represented the opinions of right-wing ide
ologues to the exclusion of any other view
points.
The list of outrageous, unsubstantiated al
legations in the short article are long and ob
vious. A serious newspaper simply cannot
claim that a guest speaker "supports] the
Unabomber" based on the hearsay of an
"anonymous protestor."

Daily should not have validated
anonymous source
I was disappointed to read Patrick Leahy's
article ("Leftist speaker sparks debate," Apr.
7) about the planned talk by Biju Mathew, Pro
fessor of Business at Rider University
I attended Prof. Mathew's campus-spon
sored event at UC Berkeley on Wednesday
and enjoyed his talk about the political econ
omy of the New York taxi industry, and the
efforts of taxi drivers to organize. He wasn't
the controversial "leftist speaker with ties to
Communism" that Leahy reported on.
It's unfortunate that the Daily would go
out of its way to loudly trumpet the rantings of
an anonymous correspondent claiming that
Mathew holds "radical political beliefs,"
"help[s] terrorist groups," and
"support[s]...the Unabomber" and "Islamic
terrorists." I wouldn't have expected the Daily
to fall prey to these red-baiting attempts,

An apology is insufficient
The apology published by the editors of
the Daily for the blatantly racist and slander
ing article by Patrick Leahy ("Leftist speak
er sparks debate," Apr. 7) is not nearly
enough.
The discrimination towards the South
Asian community, labeling FOSA and Biju
Mathew as terrorists, communists, and fun
damentalists all at the same time presents a
complete lack of journalistic integrity. After
reading these articles, I was ashamed to call
myself a student of Stanford University. The
Daily editors and staff should be completely
ashamed at the intolerance they have
spread.
Furthermore, is it really the Daily's place
to present a one-sided argument about the
validity of a political viewpoint? The editors
need to be held accountable for printing this
article. I believe that this atrocity should
show the need for the Daily to work as an
agent for social justice rather than one for
spreading hate. 1 hope that issuing an apolo
gy will be the first step of the editors and
contributing writers of the Daily to engage
in a dialogue about cultural sensitivity. 1 sin
cerely hope that you all attend anti-racist
workshops and will understand that the pub
lic will continue to keep a watchful eye to en
sure that you are providing us with the best
possible source of news and not maligning
the community it intends to serve.

Inflammatory rhetoric
reminiscent of McCarthy
I was disgusted by the tone of the article
("Leftist speaker sparks debate," Apr. 7)
which front-loaded the opinion of an anony
mous "protester" who, in essence, equated

FOSA with a terrorist organization. It is the
McCarthy-esque flavor du jour (role-mod
eled daily by Bush and his administration) to
use inaccurate, inflammatory rhetoric to cast
individuals and organizations in a threaten
ing, unpatriotic light, and author Patrick
Leahy seems to disregard objective journal
ism in favor of this slanted tactic.
I appreciate that your reporters have in
dependence, but in the future, please make
sure the tone of your articles isn't sheer right
wing propaganda.

Daily should investigate allegations
I find the portrayal of Prof. Biju Matthew
in last Friday's article ("Leftist speaker
sparks debate," Apr. 7) as a "Leftist with ties
to Communism" appalling. I also find it very
irresponsible of the author of this article to
characterize FOSA as an organization that
sympathizes with "Islamist and Communist"
forces just on the basis of one single protes
tor.
Any organization, no matter its politics,
has its detractors, but to defame an organiza
tion on the basis of unfounded allegations
