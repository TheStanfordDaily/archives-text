## BASEBALL Prevailing over Pacific Stanford squeaks by off RBI single in the bottom of the ninth 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Through the first eight innings at Sunken
Diamond, neither team could score an
earned run - despite a handful of chances.
Stanford had been held scoreless through
the first six and Pacific wasn't able to cross
the plate after the second.
By the time a drizzling bottom-of-the
ninth rolled around, it didn't matter how the
Cardinal (15-11, 2-4 Pac-10) scored, as long
as the team could get out of the rain with a
win. With plenty of help from the Tigers (19-
12), Stanford's Chris Minaker drove in the
winning run for a 2-1 victory.The RBI single
prevented his team from going into extra in
nings the night before another match.
A throwing error by Pacific's third base
man. Justin Baum, led off the thrilling final
frame. Senior catcher John Hester made it all
the way to second on the blunder, and a wild
pitch by hard-throwing righthander Eric
Stolp moved him to third. With the winning

run only 90 feet away. Minaker came to the
plate. With two strikes and Stolp throwing in
the mid-90s, Minaker sent his RBI single
over the head of the shortstop into left field.
Both teams' pitching had been stuck in a
tight duel for most of the night. Senior
righthander Matt Manship started for the
Cardinal and gave up only one unearned run
and six hits while striking out seven. Tigers'
starter Jake Wild went five scoreless innings
before Curtis Pasma took over.
Stanford's David Stringer also posted an im
pressive three and 2/3 scoreless innings be
fore freshman southpaw Jeremy Bleich came
in for the win.
The Cardinal's frustration at the plate
with runners on base began early, and Stan
ford left the bases loaded in the first. The
Cardinal also put two on in the fourth with
no outs before a foul out and two strikeouts
ended the inning. Stanford finished with 13
runners left on the base.
However, the home team finally cracked
Pacific's pitching in the seventh, with the
score at 1-0 in favor of Pacific. With one out,
the freshmen proved their mettle against
Pasma. Second baseman Cord Phelps sin
gled up the right side and classmate Joey Au
gust moved Phelps to second with a hit to the

same location.
The Cardinal got a small break with Hes
ter at the plate, as the played ball bounced
off the leg of shortstop Alex Zanini. Phelps,
ready to go for the tying run. took full advan

tage of the error, pumped his legs, turned at
third and tied the game at 1-1.
Stanford loaded the bases in that same in-
