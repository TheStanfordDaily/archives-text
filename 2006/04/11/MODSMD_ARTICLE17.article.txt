### ANDREA AYALA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After failing to reach Nationals
last season, the No. 2 men's gymnas
tics team made a huge jump forward
by placing third at NCAAs this year.
They posted a team score of 218.375
to finish behind champion Oklahoma
and runner-up Illinois.
After Thursday's opening day of
competition, the Cardinal tallied a
team score of 215.9 to secure first
place in Session One and a qualifying
position for the team final the next
night. Stanford got off to a great start
with a win on the floor exercise, scor
ing 36.425 points as a team.The Cardi
nal proceeded to win a total of four of
the six team events on Thursday.
Sophomore Sho Nakamori posted
three season bests — on the high bar
(9.3), the floor exercise (9.5) and the
pommel horse (9.3) — and earned
the all-around title for Session One
with a score of 54.025.
By improving so much from last
season, the team had a strong sense of
camaraderie that was an essential
building block to the team's success.
"A team is only as strong as its
weakest event," Coach Thom Glielmi
said. "When it became obvious what
events were going to be problematic,
several individuals stepped up to fill
the gap."
On Friday, the second day of com
petition. the Cardinal once again
showed the dominance they had
shown on the still rings all season, with
a winning 37.7. Junior Alex Schorsch
tied for second with a 9.5, while Okla
homa's Jonathon Horton took first
with a 9.7. Junior Peter Derman, soph
omore David Sender and freshman
Bryant Madden all finished in the top
10 for the Cardinal, and qualified for
the ring finals along with Schorsch.
With none of the four qualifying gym
nasts graduating, next year's still rings
team looks to be virtually unstop
pable.
On vault, Stanford put in a solid ef
fort but still trailed Oklahoma, who
finished with a 37.85. The Cardinal
tied with Illinois for second place with
a team score of 36.775. Sender and
junior Dylan Carney were the only
Stanford gymnasts to finish in the top
10. Carney finished eighth with a 9.35,
and Sender came in ninth with a 9.325.
Stanford finished second as a team on
the floor exercise with a score of 36.9,
trailing Illinois (36.925). The Fighting
lllini's Justin Spring finished first in the
event with a 9.75. Nakamori tallied a 9.45
to finish fourth and qualify for the floor
exercise finals the next day.
The Cardinal finished third on the
high bar with a season-best team score of
37.75, as Oklahoma took first in the
event. Carney and senior Nate Downs
posted 9.625 and 9.45 scores, respective
ly, to advance to the event finals. Stan
ford also posted a season best on the par
allel bars, placing fourth in the event with
a 36.425. Illinois finished first with a
37.975. Sender qualified for finals, tally
ing a 9.35 to finish 10th.
On pommel horse, the Cardinal
placed sixth as a team with a score of
32.825. Illinois finished first in the event
with a 36.925.
Sender and Nakamori earned All-
American honors by finishing fourth and
seventh in the all-around.

On the last day of competition.
Sender posted a 9.562 to finish first on
vault, becoming the 2(X)6 NCAA vault
ing champion. Carney's near-flawless
performance on the high bar earned him
a 9.7 and the title of national high bar
champion, a distinction he shares with
Illinois' Spring.
Ilie team is already looking forward
to next year and the chance to build on
the progress and accomplishments of
this season. The Cardinal will lose two
graduating seniors, Sean Doolan and
Downs, but they will otherwise be a team
of seasoned NCAA veterans.
"Iliis competition [at NCAAs] gave
us a lot of experience," Carney said.
"Competing for a real tangible shot at a
national championship taught us how to
compete under pressure. Going into next
year's championships, we'll not only be
the strongest team out there, but we'll
also have the most seasoned veterans of
NCAA gymnastics. We've been a young
team these past couple of years, but not
so anymore."

Last year Stanford missed qualifying for the NCAAs altogether, and this year the team placed
third. With only two graduating seniors, the squad will be full of seasoned veterans next year.
