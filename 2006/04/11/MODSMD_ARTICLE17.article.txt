After failing to reach Nationals
last season, the No. 2 men's gymnas
tics team made a huge jump forward
by placing third at NCAAs this year.
They posted a team score of 218.375
to finish behind champion Oklahoma
and runner-up Illinois.
After Thursday's opening day of
competition, the Cardinal tallied a
team score of 215.9 to secure first
place in Session One and a qualifying
position for the team final the next
night. Stanford got off to a great start
with a win on the floor exercise, scor
