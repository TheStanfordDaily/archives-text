# Women's water polo sweeps three
## 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
Everything seems to he clicking right now for
Stanford women's water polo.
The No. 2 Cardinal (18-3, 9-1 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) closed out their home schedule
this weekend with an emphatic three-game sweep of
visiting UC-San Diego. San Diego State and Arizona
State. With the three victories, the women remained
undefeated at Avery Aquatic Center in conference
play. But with the postseason soon to come, the com
posure with which the Cardinal played this weekend
was perhaps of the greatest significance.
On Friday night, the Stanford women played host
to No. 14 San Diego. And the Tritons received a
rather rude welcome to Northern California, as the
Cardinal jumped out to a 5-1 first-period lead before
cruising to a 15-4 win.
Junior two-meter Christina Hewko got the Cardi
nal off to a strong start by finding the back of the net
just 12 seconds into the game. Senior driver Scotti
Shafer and junior Katie Hansen both followed suit
soon after to put the Cardinal up 3-0 early. Senior
two-meter Nancy El-Sakkary and junior two-meter
defender Alison Gregorka responded to a San Diego
goal to give Stanford the decisive 5-1 advantage.
The Cardinal offense continued to roll, and by the
end of the game, eight different members of the Stan
ford squad had recorded goals. Five of them — El-
Sakkary (four goals), Hansen, Hewko and freshmen
Koree Blyleven and Lolo Silver — contributed mul
tiple goals on the day. On the defensive end, junior
goalie Meridith McColl played a big role in shutting
down the Tritons' attack with seven saves.
On Saturday, the Cardinal took on their highest
ranked opponent of the weekend in the No. 7 San
Diego State Aztecs. Even so, the Cardinal once again
took control of the game, posting a commanding 7-2
win. After Rachel Serna gave the Aztecs the early
edge by converting a penalty shot two minutes in,
Hansen literally took matters into her own hands.
She notched two goals before the end of the opening
period, and the Cardinal never looked back.

Ilie Stanford women continued to play stifling de
fense in their half of the pool, and the Aztecs were un
able to score until midway through the third. But by that
point, the Cardinal already held a four-goal advantage.
Silver paced the Cardinal attack with a hat-trick,
and McColl stonewalled eight San Diego State
shots, including seven in the second half of play.
