## Varsity teams win, lightweights get third 
### JOHN CHOCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Fierce winds and stiff competition couldn't
stop Stanford as the lightweight women rowed
to two victories and a third-place finish Saturday
at the Lexington Reservoir in Los Gatos, Calif.
Meanwhile, the Varsity 8 crew, with junior Anna
Lee back on board for the first time this season,
finished seconds ahead of stronger heavyweight
teams from Santa Clara University and St.
Mary's.
The Santa Clara heavyweights had previous
ly defeated the lightweight Card in scrimmages.

and in a preseason regatta St. Mary's had come
close to doing the same, but neither team held a
candle to the revamped Stanford eight.
"It was good to have [Lee] back," head coach
A 1 Acosta said. "(She J is making a big difference."
Without Lee, the lightweight crew had strug
gled in the first weeks of competition to live up to
their billing as defending Pac-10 champions. The
lightweights won only one of three races?♦ the
Windermere Regatta, and fell to Wisconsin in
the grand final of the recent San Diego Classic.
"I think we were not as fast as we would have
like to have been early on," Acosta said. "But
we've been improving, and the morale is great."

The Varsity 4 boat from Stanford also won in
Los Gatos in a choppy heat, crossing the finish
line open water ahead of California and Sonoma
State.The Cardinal's Novice 4 finished third in a
field of seven.
This weekend. Stanford's heavyweight men's
team and open-weight women's team host the
Stanford Invitational at Redwood Shores. The
men s team, riding the unprecedented success of
season-opening victories over Yale, California,
Washington and Pennsylvania, have climbed to
a highest-ever No. 2 national ranking. They are
second only to Princeton, while Harvard is
ranked third and California is fourth.
