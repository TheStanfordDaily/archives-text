### AMIT ARORA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Complete with an inflatable turkey and chants of
"FLIP-FLOP," the ASSU Executive Slate Debate proved
entertaining the group of 75 students gathered at the
CoHo last night. Featuring Heng with Graham,
Rillera/Nguyen and The Sound and the Fury, the debate
gave students the opportunity to learn the candidates'
backgrounds and platforms for this week's election.
Conducted rather informally, the debate drew signifi
cant audience participation. Many attendees — predomi
nantly supporters of the Chappie slate — raised posters
with different campaign and platform catch-phrases as the
candidates spoke.
The debate began with opening statements, during
which each slate described their past experiences and
plans for office.
Heng with Graham's presidential candidate, junior
Elizabeth Heng, discussed her tenure as junior class presi
dent, while vice presidential candidate, junior Lauren Gra
ham, highlighted her work on the ASSU Executive Cabi
net. Together, the candidates outlined their goals to make

Presidential candidate, junior Marc Rillera of
Rillera/Nguyen, described his background as Admit Week
end coordinator while vice presidential candidate Chris
Nguyen, also a junior, explained how his position as ASSU
Undergraduate Senate chair would help him serve the stu
dent body. In describing their platform, the candidates
highlighted cost-of-living reform, flexibility in dining and
subsidized GO Passes for graduate students.
The Rillera/Nguyen slate questioned its opponents'
platforms. In particular, Nguyen suggested that Heng with
Graham's goals ignored long-term planning and stated
that the slate's lack of familiarly with the Undergraduate
Senate would hinder its ability to serve effectively.
The Chappie's Sound and the Fury was the last to give
an opening statement, although the slate's platform was
immediately apparent from the "this is ridiculous" sign
hanging from its table.
Presidential candidate Allan Phillips, a junior, and vice *
presidential candidate, junior Doug Kenter,described how
the specter of graduate students must be combated by the
undergraduate populace.
"We will overwhelm the graduate students as the tide

asked a series of questions by moder
ator and current ASSU Executive
President Melanie Kannokada, a
senior.
When asked about student dining
changes, the Rillera/Nguyen slate ad
vocated a multi-priced meal plan,
while The Sound and the Fury ex
pressed the need for only a single
meal option.
Concerning graduate needs, the
Heng with Graham slate under
scored the importance of open dia
logue in its campaign.
"We have met with the Graduate
Student Council to discuss the feasi
bility of our initiatives," Heng said.
The Sound and the Fury present
ed radically different ideas on the
subject. It pushed for a 9 p.m. curfew
for all graduate students, an increase
in graduate student tuition, under
graduate teaching assistants for
graduate classes, a dispossession of
graduate-owned land and the burn
ing of the new Munger Graduate
Residences, which are still under
construction.
The candidates also had the op
portunity to detail their endorse
ments. The Heng with Graham slate

highlighted its endorsements from
The Stanford Daily, the Stanford De
mocrats and the Students of Color
Coalition (SOCC). Meanwhile, the
Rillera/Nguyen slate emphasized
that it has received support from Un
dergraduate Senate members. Grad
uate Student Council (GSC) mem
bers and small student groups. The
Sound and the Fury recognized that
it had received only two endorse
ments from Wilbur Dining Hall and
Lowe's Home Improvement.
In closing, the slates were given
the chance to present a short state
ment to sum up their plans.
Rillera described his slate's plat
form as one designed to meet both
short-term and long-term goals while
considering both undergraduate and
graduate students. He also discussed
the challenge of leadership.
"We are committed to success, but
it's not going to be easy," Rillera said.
The Sound and the Fury then
highlighted the differences between
its slate and its opponents.
"The Sound and the Fury is incor
ruptible," Phillips said. "I will say this
only once: to kill a beast, you must slit
its throat."

Lastly, Heng with Graham pre
sented a summary of its platform and
stressed its dedication to the ASSU.
"We know that the ASSU job is
not glamorous, but we want people
to talk to us," Heng said. "We want
the suggestions of the undergraduate
student body"
Following the debate, the ASSU
held a raffle to thank the audience
for its attendance and participation
in election activities. With a turnout
approximately twice that of last year,
many of those at the CoHo said they
enjoyed the debate. Many yelled and
laughed through the event, and Kan
nokada attributed the high turnout
to the Chappie slate s entourage.
"I think it was great turnout, com
pared to last year," she said. "There
were many Chappie supporters and
students in general to listen to the
candidates. We gave the slates a mix
of lighthearted and serious questions
to assess their ability to lead in Stan
ford's student government."

The Stanford Daily, the Stanford De
mocrats and the Students of Color
Coalition (SOCC). Meanwhile, the
Rillera/Nguyen slate emphasized
that it has received support from Un
dergraduate Senate members. Grad

bers and small student groups. The
Sound and the Fury recognized that
it had received only two endorse

Lowe's Home Improvement.
In closing, the slates were given
the chance to present a short state
ment to sum up their plans.
Rillera described his slate's plat
form as one designed to meet both
short-term and long-term goals while
considering both undergraduate and
graduate students. He also discussed
the challenge of leadership.
"We are committed to success, but
it's not going to be easy," Rillera said.
The Sound and the Fury then
highlighted the differences between
its slate and its opponents.
"The Sound and the Fury is incor
ruptible," Phillips said. "I will say this
only once: to kill a beast, you must slit
its throat."

Lastly, Heng with Graham pre
sented a summary of its platform and
stressed its dedication to the ASSU.
"We know that the ASSU job is
not glamorous, but we want people
to talk to us," Heng said. "We want
the suggestions of the undergraduate
student body"
Following the debate, the ASSU
held a raffle to thank the audience
for its attendance and participation
in election activities. With a turnout
approximately twice that of last year,
many of those at the CoHo said they
enjoyed the debate. Many yelled and
laughed through the event, and Kan
nokada attributed the high turnout
to the Chappie slate s entourage.
"I think it was great turnout, com
pared to last year," she said. "There
were many Chappie supporters and
students in general to listen to the
candidates. We gave the slates a mix
of lighthearted and serious questions
to assess their ability to lead in Stan
ford's student government."
Students will have another oppor

Candidates" in Stern Dining at 8:30

Complete with an inflatable turkey and chants of
"FLIP-FLOP," the ASSU Executive Slate Debate proved
entertaining the group of 75 students gathered at the
CoHo last night. Featuring Heng with Graham,
Rillera/Nguyen and The Sound and the Fury, the debate
gave students the opportunity to learn the candidates'
backgrounds and platforms for this week's election.
Conducted rather informally, the debate drew signifi
cant audience participation. Many attendees — predomi
nantly supporters of the Chappie slate — raised posters
with different campaign and platform catch-phrases as the
candidates spoke.
The debate began with opening statements, during
which each slate described their past experiences and
plans for office.
Heng with Graham's presidential candidate, junior
Elizabeth Heng, discussed her tenure as junior class presi
dent, while vice presidential candidate, junior Lauren Gra
ham, highlighted her work on the ASSU Executive Cabi
net. Together, the candidates outlined their goals to make

Center for Public Service and revive the defunct Mau
soleum Party.
Presidential candidate, junior Marc Rillera of
Rillera/Nguyen, described his background as Admit Week
end coordinator while vice presidential candidate Chris
Nguyen, also a junior, explained how his position as ASSU
Undergraduate Senate chair would help him serve the stu
dent body. In describing their platform, the candidates
highlighted cost-of-living reform, flexibility in dining and
subsidized GO Passes for graduate students.
The Rillera/Nguyen slate questioned its opponents'
platforms. In particular, Nguyen suggested that Heng with
Graham's goals ignored long-term planning and stated
that the slate's lack of familiarly with the Undergraduate
Senate would hinder its ability to serve effectively.
The Chappie's Sound and the Fury was the last to give
an opening statement, although the slate's platform was
immediately apparent from the "this is ridiculous" sign
hanging from its table.
Presidential candidate Allan Phillips, a junior, and vice *
presidential candidate, junior Doug Kenter,described how
the specter of graduate students must be combated by the
undergraduate populace.
"We will overwhelm the graduate students as the tide
overcomes a sandcastle," Kenter said.
Following opening statements, the candidates were

meal option.
Concerning graduate needs, the
Heng with Graham slate under
scored the importance of open dia
logue in its campaign.
"We have met with the Graduate
Student Council to discuss the feasi
bility of our initiatives," Heng said.
The Sound and the Fury present
ed radically different ideas on the
subject. It pushed for a 9 p.m. curfew
for all graduate students, an increase
in graduate student tuition, under
graduate teaching assistants for
graduate classes, a dispossession of
graduate-owned land and the burn
ing of the new Munger Graduate
Residences, which are still under
