### ISRAEL ROJAS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Cardinal visited Austin,
Texas, and Los Angeles this weekend
as they competed at the four-day
Texas Relays and the three-day
Rafer Johnson / Jackie Joyner
Kersee Invitational, respectively.
Sophomore Josh Hustedt kicked
off a solid weekend with a fifth place
showing in the decathlon. Hustedt
improved upon his previous person
al best (5,727 points) by more than
1,300 points as he amassed a total of
7,070 — easily enough to reach the
NCAA provisional standard. In the
heptathlon, freshman Lauren Stew
art surpassed the NCAA provisional
mark by 110 points with 5,110.
As the 78th annual Texas Relay
progressed, the Cardinal's perform
ances continued to improve. Junior
Feranmi Okanlami finished second
in the triple jump with a career best
of 51 -41/2 feet that cracked the list of
top five jumps in school history.
Sophomore Chauntae Bayne-
Hackett also set a career-best mark,
running the 100 meters in 11.26 sec
onds. That time was the second best
in school history and the ninth best in
the Pac-10, but was still only good
enough for third place in the event.
Bayne-Hackett was also named the
Pac-10 Women's Track Athlete of the
Week yesterday.
During the weekend, the women
also had two relays qualify for
NCAAs. The 400- and 1600-meter
teams both exceeded the provisional
mark with times of 44.37 seconds and
3:33.23 minutes, respectively.
Other notable Stanford perform
ances included an NCAA regional
qualifying effort by freshman Donell
Hill in the pole vault (16-6 3/4 feet),
as well as a third-place finish by
sophomore Erica McLain, who
made her outdoor debut in the triple
jump with an effort of 45-5 feet.
Sophomore Graeme Hoste also
had a solid performance, breaking
the top-10 in the pole vault with a
height of more than 17 feet.
UCLA hosted the meet in Los
Angeles, and the Cardinal wasted
no time in establishing their pres
ence there either. Senior Sarah
Hopping set the tone early with a
fourth-place finish in the hammer
throw with a distance of 189-6 feet.
Freshman Mark Shughart also
achieved a fourth-place finish in the
discus competition. He threw over
162 feet, and then placed seventh in
the shot put with a distance of al
most 53 feet.
Junior Keith Avila finished third
in the men's javelin throw invite,
clearing almost 192 feet. Sophomore
Melissa Yunghans matched Avila's
third-place finish with a throw of
over 49 feet in the women's shot put
invite. In the men's discus throw in
vite, Daniel Shaerer threw for about
178 feet to finish fourth in the event.
Freshman Alana Walker also had
a successful weekend, winning the
200-meter title. She ran a season-best
24.06 seconds, and then followed up
the effort with a fourth-place finish
in the 100 meters.
