# The 						room of a sports junkie
## 
### 
It's 1 a.m. and I am exhausted.
After an all-nighter spent run
ning around the Bay Area play
ing "The Game," installing a ham
mock underneath my newly-lofted
bed and sitting through Palm Sunday
mass, I am in no mood to read for my
history class.
Sunday night. Sunday night?
There's something I should be doing
right now.
Suddenly, the heat of my desk
lamp intensifies, pulling my eyelids
apart like the jaws of life.
1 look up at my wall and see the
various posters scattered throughout
my immediate perception. Mark
Buehrle's eyes stare down at me as if
to say "Yeah, I'm going to take care
of your Angels this year, too." The
smiles on the faces of the Stanford
volleyball players offer me some
sense of comfort, but the celebratory
expressions on the faces of Matt
Leinart and Matt Hasselbeck from
two December Sports Illustrated
covers remind me that all power is
fleeting — "Beware the Ides of
March!" they proclaim.
Sunday. Sunday night. I check the
MLB and NBA Web sites and re
arrange my fantasy team roster, but
something is still missing.
My foam fingers point up toward
the ceiling, prompting me to then
focus my attention on my impressive
collection of pennants — 12 in all —
from stadiums across the country,
spanning from Anaheim to Green
Bay to both sides of Chicago.
I heave my mini-basketball across
the room and miss the miniscule
hoop by about a mile. The ball lands
just shy of the framed photo of a
friend and me at a Red Sox game last
year, just a few inches from my ticket
to the Mexico-Norway soccer game
from a few months back.
Sunday night? There is something
I should be doing.
The laundry? No, that can't be it.
Halo 2? Negative. I take a sip of
water out of my Dodger Stadium
souvenir cup, nestled in a Packers
drink warmer.
"Darn, I sure have a lot of sports
junk in my room," I think to myself.
Sports. Sports? Sports! Aww, snap!
The sports column for The Daily!
What the heck am I going to write
about this week? I quickly scurry to
ask my friend what she wants to read
about this week.
"You could talk about the NFL
cracking down on end zone celebra
tions," she replies, throwing a seduc
tive stare that draws me closer to her
gorgeous Jerry Rice jersey and 49ers
pajamas.
"Soon, Andy, soon," I think to my
self as I snap out of it and head down
stairs.
I find a few friends playing Fight
Night on the XBox 360 that our RA
"acquired" over winter break."
What do you guys want to read in
my column," I wheeze while my asth
ma-ridden lungs gasp for breath.
"Florida winning the NCAA
championship?" — too much writ
ten on that topic already.
"Barry Bonds?" — I'm sure An
drew Rogers will cover that in his
column on Friday.
"I liked that article you wrote
about Missy [Penna] last Friday." —
thanks, but that doesn't help.
"Phil Mickelson and the Mas
ters?" — nobody likes golf.
My mind races as I try to brain
storm ideas. I check MLB.com again,
just to make sure I got that one score
right. And while I'm at it, I investi
gate the Mighty Ducks' current play
off standing.
It's 2:45 a.m.. and I am exhausted.
I guess you could say my life is
pretty sad, dedicating so much effort
to a craft that doesn't even earn
much respect. After all, sports writ
ing doesn't require much more than
a brute-like admiration for athletics.
Sports journalism will never offer
the same logical and emotional ap
peal as more serious disciplines, and
the technical challenges can't com
pare either. Well, at least that's what
I've been hearing recently.
But if this really doesn't require
much skill, then I 'm left with just one
question: What are you doing still
reading this column?

Got any sports memorabilia you're
looking to dump? Clothe freshman
