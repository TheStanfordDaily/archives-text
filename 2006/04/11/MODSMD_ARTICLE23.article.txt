## Stanford profs lead CA education inquiry 
### KATHERINE COX STAFF WRITER 
Californians lead the nation on in
dustrial, technological and ideological
fronts, but when it comes to public ed
ucation the Golden State trails far be
hind. Its standing at the bottom of na
tional education rankings has
prompted a massive inquiry into the
state's school finance and governance
policies. More than 30 researchers
from think tanks and universities
across the nation will contribute to
the $2.6 million research effort, the
most extensive independent research
project to be conducted on the Cali
fornia school system to date.
The project, entitled, "Getting
Down to Facts: A Research Project
to Inform Solutions to California's
Education Problems" will, among
other things, identify which kinds of
student outcomes are probable given
a certain level of funding, and deter
mine what additional funding is re
quired to allow all students to reach
academic standards.
However, the project's director, Su
sanna Loeb, an associate professor in the
School of Education, qualified this goal.
"Just putting dollars in the system
will not guarantee that students re
ceive these resources," she said.
Another part of the study will ad
dress the funding conundrum and ex
plore how resources can be better ap
plied to maximize student perform
ance. A third branch of the work will
examine how the state's governance
and finance systems operate today.
At the end of the nine-month
long project — which is privately
funded by the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation, the William and
Flora Hewlett Foundation, the James
Irvine Foundation and the Stuart
Foundation — researchers working
on 20 different sub-studies also hope
to formulate a number of recom
mendations that will begin to help
state legislators streamline the fi
nance and governance systems.
Five studies will be devoted to
evaluating how the state finances
public education.They will track how

state, federal and local funds get to
individual districts; interpret the rel
evant legislation and compare it to
that of other states; and even look at
schools' operating expenses.
Stanford Education Prof. Michael
Kirst. who is also working on the proj
ect, described the current system as,
"so convoluted and complex that only
a handful of experts understand it.
Experts from 11 universities, in
cluding the University of Pennsyl
vania and Tufts, and six nonpartisan
think tanks will employ a variety of
data collection methods. According
to Loeb, a handful of the project's
studies will draw upon the results of
broad surveys. Others will rely on
existing records and statistical
analysis.
"One study of district business of
fices will use administrative data, as
well as information collected from a
survey, to describe the practices in
acquisition and allocation of re
sources in districts across the state
and relate these practices to district
outcomes using statistical tech
niques," Loeb said. "We also have an
overview study of governance that is
based largely on interviews across
the state. This study aims to identify
important areas in which California
could improve its use of resources."
These particular studies, intended
to root out the misuse of resources
and identify allocation methods that
yield positive academic results, re
flect the way Kirst sees the correla
tion between funding and students'
success. He believes that the gaping
disparities in the California educa
tion system are not necessarily linked
to the amount of funding at each
school, but instead to the misappro
priation of funds and other factors.
"In my view, it's not just funding that
causes these differences; it's not even
primarily funding," he said. "Some dis
tricts perform worse because schools
have not been able to overcome
through instruction the differences stu
dents bring to school like students' eco
nomic and parental backgrounds. Also,
