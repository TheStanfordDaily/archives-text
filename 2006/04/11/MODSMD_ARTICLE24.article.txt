## Group to select new leadership 
### DENISE SOHN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As ASSU and class campaigns come into full swing,
the administration has been busy selecting new leaders
as well.
Last week Provost John Etchemendy named the
committee to recommend possible successors for mate
rials science and engineering and applied physics Prof.
Arthur Bienenstock as vice provost and dean of re
search and graduate policy, as well as candidates for the
new position of vice provost for graduate education
(VPGE). This followed Bienenstock s announcement
that he would retire after three years in the position.
"The committee was selected by the president and
provost from nominations that came from the Senate
Committee on Committees — for faculty — and the
Graduate Student Council, for students," Etchemendy
said.
The committee, headed by Physics Prof. Malcolm
Beasley, includes both faculty and graduate students.
The 15-member committee has already begun work, and
Beasley said that the process would proceed as usual.
"As is typical in such searches, we will be talking to
the incumbent, the Deans and the various stakeholders,
including students, in order to understand what will be
the nature of these two jobs," he said. "We will interview
various administrators and faculty with the list of nomi
nations in mind. We then will assess all the nominations
and present a short annotated, unranked list to the
Provost."
Beasley also added that he hoped "for the two ap
pointments to be made by the end of this quarter."
Though he declined to comment on any favorites
being considered for the positions, Beasley did state that
"good academic values, administrative talent and rele
vant experience" would be considered highly.
Calling for nominations in an e-mail sent to faculty
members, Beasley also asked to "give special attention

to potential candidates who are women or members of
ethnic minority groups."
In the email, Beasley also asked his colleagues to rec
ommend what criteria should be considered, what qual
ifications should be looked for and what issues the vice
provost and dean of research and new VPGE should
tackle.
The new VPGE position "was recommended by the
Commission on Graduate Education," according to
Etchemendy.
This effort was made by the Graduate Student
Council Diversity Committee (GSC-DC). Tracy Terry, a
fifth-year graduate student in chemistry and a member
of the committee, explained that the body "first recom
mended the position of VPGE to the administration
over a year go."
Terry added that the GSC-DC has discussed "posi
tive attributes of a VPGE and the layout of the VPGE
office" and plans to "present the research we have done
and the programs we would like to see implemented by
a centralized graduate student office."
Though the duties of the new position are not yet
completely outlined, Beasley wrote in his email that the
new vice provost would "be responsible for the recom
mendation and promulgation of policies that apply to
graduate and postdoctoral study; oversight of recruit
ment for a diverse graduate student population as well
as oversight of new programs and initiatives that sup
port graduate education at Stanford."
The duties of the vice provost and dean of research,
meanwhile, are more clearly defined. These duties in
clude "research policy promulgation and oversight; rep
resentation of Stanford and its research interests to in
ternal and external constituencies; and oversight of the
programs of the independent laboratories, centers and
institutes."
The committee will be accepting nominations until
this Friday, April 14, and hopes that many faculty mem
bers will contribute input.
