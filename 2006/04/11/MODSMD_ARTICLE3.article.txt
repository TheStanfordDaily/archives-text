# STUDENT LIFE
## Protesters put up fence 
### MIMA MOHAMMED DESK EDITOR 
More than one million people nationwide
took to the streets yesterday, calling for the first
broad changes in U.S. immigration policy in
more than two decades. The issue has divided
the country and could play a major role in up
coming congressional elections. Immigrant
rights groups. Latino advocacy organizations
and labor unions and reli-

gious institutions have
backed the protests, part
of what organizers deem
the National Day of Ac
tion for Immigrant Justice.
Stanford students who
are concerned about
H.R.4437 and the current
ly stalled compromise in
the Senate joined the
protests, donning white
clothing and reciting

O o
chants such as, "We didn't cross the border, the
border crossed us." In addition, protesters con
structed a wall, using temporary plastic fencing,
stretching from Old Union to the front of the
Stanford Bookstore.
"We built a fence in order to recreate the bor
der— the physical one between the U.S. and
Mexico and the psychological one that comes
out of intolerance that many immigrants must
face," said sophomore Joshua Bogus. "The goal
was that we could make a disturbance getting
people to bother to notice the injustice resulting
from some of the proposed legislation in Wash
ington regarding immigrants' rights."
In Washington, the Senate adjourned last
week for a two-week recess after it was unable
to reach an agreement on how to deal with the
11 to 12 million people who are in the United

States illegally.
According to the proposed legislation, immi
grants residing in the U.S for more than five years
would be put on a track for citizenship after pay
ing fines, learning English and paying back taxes.
It would take six additional years to attain citi
zenship. The middle group — those in the U.S. for
between two to five years — would have to leave
the United States but would be quickly allowed
to return on temporary work visas and would

eventually be eligible for
citizenship. Those living il
legally in the United States
for less than two years
would be sent back to their
native countries where
they would compete with
those immigrants seeking
to enter legally.
Some conservatives
oppose the compromise as
a form of amnesty, arguing
that porous borders are a

national security concern.
On Dec. 6,2(X)5, House Judiciary Committee
Chair Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wisc.) introduced
the "Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Ille
gal Immigration Control Act of 2(X)5" (H.R.
4437).The bill passed in the House of Represen
tatives by a vote of 239-182 on Dec. 16.
Opponents of the bill claim it will criminalize
anyone, including religious institutions, who aids
an undocumented immigrant by providing such
things as health care, food or education. In addi
tion, the House bill proposes building 7(X) miles
of wall along the border at an estimated cost of
$2 billion.
The fate of the Senate bill remains to be seen.
Even if the bill does pass, it would have to be rec
onciled with a tougher House version that has
no provision for a guest worker program.

"We built a fence to recreate the
border...the physical one between
the U.S. and Mexico and the
psychological one."
