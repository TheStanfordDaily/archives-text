# Morris, Reveno, Batson to leave the program; A homecoming as Oliver and Robinson return
## Morris moves on 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
These past few months have already
been plenty disappointing for Stanford
men's basketball. This past season, the Car
dinal lost to UC-Davis,UC-Irvine and Mon
tana, suffered their worst home loss since
IW3 (in the regular-season finale to UCLA),
and missed the NCAA Tournament for the
first time in 12 years. This upcoming season
didn't look much brighter either, as the
team's three best players — forward Matt
Haryasz and guards Dan Grunfeld and
Chris Hernandez — graduate this June
alongside defensive specialist Jason Haas.
But two major developments in the
past 24 hours now leave Stanford basket
ball fans pouring salt on their wounds.
Due to playing-style concerns, redshirt

sophomore guard Tim Morris will transfer
from Stanford after this spring — most
likely to Notre Dame, Georgia Tech,
Georgia, North Carolina State or Florida.
Morris sent his release to those five
schools, giving them the permission to
begin recruiting him.
A redshirt during his true freshman year
(2002-03), Morris lost most of his redshirt
freshman season (2003-04) to academic in
eligibility after he failed the human biology
core. He then played steadily — if unspec
tacularly — as a redshirt sophomore this
past season. He was the best perimeter de
fender on the team, appeared in all 30 games
and averaged 21 minutes per contest.
However, the explosive Morris, easily
the team's best athlete, never seemed to

Fans will remember sophomore guard Tim Morris for his defense and flashy play. But shoot
ing inaccuracy plagued Morris throughout his career, and may have prompted the transfer.
reach his offensive potential.This past
season, he averaged just five points per
game — and not for lack of shots. I lis
39 percent overall shooting (67-of
-172),42.3 percent free-throw shooting
(11-of-26), and 17 percent three-point
shooting (4-of-23) marked some of the
lowest percentages on the squad.
Sources close to the program said
that Morris' inaccuracy threatened
his playing time at his natural posi
tion, the two, or shooting, guard.
Freshman guard Anthony Goods
came on strong late in the season,
highlighted by his game-winning tip
in at Washington State, and the
coaching staff believed Goods to be a
more accurate shot than Morris. This
evaluation likely elevated Goods
over Morris on the depth chart, be
cause the coaches' top emphasis
from its shooting guards is shooting
accuracy (witness the 47.2 percent
three-point accuracy of departing
shooting guard Chris 1 lernandez).
"I would like to find a place that is
a better fit for me," Morris said to
Scout.com.

"I wish the best for him," head
coach Trent Johnson said.
Meanwhile, top assistant coach
Eric Reveno is leaving the program
to become the head coach at Port
land University.
That the announcement was a long
time in the making — Reveno, 40, has
wanted to be a head coach for years
— will do nothing to lessen the effects
of the departure of the nine-year assis
tant. Formally an associate head
coach under Coach Johnson, Reveno
became famous in coaching circles for
his ability to coach big men, molding
posts like Mark Madsen, Jarron and
Jason Collins, Curtis Borchardt and
Matt Haryasz into All-Conference
level, NBA-caliber players.
"Not only does the University of
Portland deserve a winner, it can win,"
said Reveno, who takes over a West
Coast Conference program with just
one winning season since 1981-82.
Hie timing of Reveno's departure
stings even more because Brook and
Robin Lopez of Fresno, Calif., respec
tively the No. 2 power forward and
No. 4 center in the country according
to Scout.com, arrive at Stanford this
summer. Given the seven-foot twins'
seemingly limitless potential and
Reveno's track record, his departure
leaves Pac-10 rivals breathing a lot

easier and Stanford fans wondering
what might have been.
Stanford has hired former Idaho
State head coach Doug Oliver as an as
sistant, presumably to fill Reveno's
shoes. The hire marks a homecoming
for Oliver, who served as a Stanford as
sistant for 12 years (1986-98) under for
mer head coach Mike Montgomery.
In news not as momentous to a na
tional audience,but nonetheless heart
wrenching to the Sixth Man Club, for
mer Director of Men's Basketball Op
erations and Sixth Man Coordinator
JT Batson left the program in January
for a corporate marketing position.
Replacing Batson as director of
men's basketball operations is none
other than former Stanford forward
Nick Robinson. Robinson, 26, en
tered Stanford in 2000 after spending
two years on a Mormon mission in
Brazil. For the Cardinal, he totaled
414 points and 620 rebounds, but
made his presence most felt as a de
fensive standout. Robinson is best re
membered for his off-balance,
buzzer-beating 35-foot shot to give
Stanford an 80-77 win over Arizona
that kept Stanford's perfect 26-0 start
and No. 1 national ranking intact in
2003-04. his junior season.
