# Morris, Reveno, Batson to leave the program; A homecoming as Oliver and Robinson return
## Morris moves on 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
These past few months have already
been plenty disappointing for Stanford
men's basketball. This past season, the Car
dinal lost to UC-Davis,UC-Irvine and Mon
tana, suffered their worst home loss since
IW3 (in the regular-season finale to UCLA),
and missed the NCAA Tournament for the
first time in 12 years. This upcoming season
didn't look much brighter either, as the
team's three best players — forward Matt
Haryasz and guards Dan Grunfeld and
Chris Hernandez — graduate this June
alongside defensive specialist Jason Haas.
But two major developments in the
past 24 hours now leave Stanford basket
ball fans pouring salt on their wounds.
Due to playing-style concerns, redshirt

sophomore guard Tim Morris will transfer
from Stanford after this spring — most
likely to Notre Dame, Georgia Tech,
Georgia, North Carolina State or Florida.
Morris sent his release to those five
schools, giving them the permission to
begin recruiting him.
A redshirt during his true freshman year
(2002-03), Morris lost most of his redshirt
freshman season (2003-04) to academic in
eligibility after he failed the human biology
core. He then played steadily — if unspec
tacularly — as a redshirt sophomore this
past season. He was the best perimeter de
fender on the team, appeared in all 30 games
and averaged 21 minutes per contest.
However, the explosive Morris, easily
the team's best athlete, never seemed to

Fans will remember sophomore guard Tim Morris for his defense and flashy play. But shoot
ing inaccuracy plagued Morris throughout his career, and may have prompted the transfer.
