# RENOVATIONS
## Students share ideas on Old Union 
### JENNIFER LIU DESK EDITOR 
If the purpose of the Old Union
renovation is to provide a home for
student groups, then it should look
like home. At least that was the idea
advanced yesterday during the town
hall meeting hosted by Student Af
fairs and Capital Planning to present
and discuss preliminary suggestions
for floor plans and furnishings for the
new Old Union.
Approximately 15 students at
tended the meeting, which was mod
erated by Assistant Dean and Direc
tor of Tresidder Memorial Union
Jeanette Smith-Laws.
Future occupants of the renovated
space met with Capital Planning rep
resentatives at a March 9 brainstorm
ing session, producing the preliminary
proposals that were presented yester
day. Outgoing ASSU Vice President
Aneto Okonkwo, a senior, said that
the initial plans were wide-ranging.
Attending students were divided
into small groups and given large
maps of the suggested floor space and
exteriors of Old Union. They were
then asked to brainstorm their own
additions and modifications and eval
uate their ideas.
"A lot of the student groups were
excited about having more space,"
said Jennifer Chen, a junior. "The in
terior design consultants were really
receptive to students' ideas, even the
crazy ones. There was even a sugges
tion for a courtyard filled with trees
and hammocks. If students liked it,
planners took it seriously."
Okonkwo said that more town
hall meetings are slated for the fu
ture to refine general concepts and
plans.
"The Old Union project is part of
a multi-year effort which has in
volved students and administrators
for many years," he wrote in an
email to The Daily. "The goals of
these meetings are to collect a wide
range of opinions on the needs of
students and attempt to refine these
requests as we move forward."
