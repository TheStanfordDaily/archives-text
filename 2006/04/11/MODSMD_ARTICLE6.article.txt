The Daily would like to retract
the article "Leftist speaker
sparks debate" (April 7). The
allegations that speaker Biju
Mathew or the Friends of
South Asia are linked in any
way to communism, terrorism
or the Unabomber should not
have been based on informa
tion provided by an anony
mous source.The Daily regrets
this error and the uncorrobo
rated statements contained in
the article.
