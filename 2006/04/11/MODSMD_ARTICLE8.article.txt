## ASES holds seventh international summit 
### ADA YEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Forty students from 10 nations across the Asia-Pa
cific region will visit campus this week to learn about
global entrepreneurship and network with Stanford
students during a summit hosted by Stanford's Asia-
Pacific Entrepreneurship Society (ASES).
The delegates hail from such countries as China,
India, Thailand and Singapore, among others, where
most are members of developing or established ASES
chapters at their own universities. ASES holds two in
ternational summits each year, one in Asia and one at
Stanford. According to junior Melissa Chau, ASES
summit director, more than 150 students from chap
ters in Asia applied to attend this years conference on
campus.
Along with Stanford students and members of the
outside community — the summit has been publi
cized to local professional organizations — the dele
gates will hear from Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and
ASES alumni in a series of speeches and panels. They
will also participate in workshops and "teambuilding
activities." The ultimate goal of the summit is to edu

cate students about entrepreneurship and to bring
young entrepreneurs from around the world to a sin
gle place where they can exchange ideas, Chau said.
"1 think the summit is the pinnacle of our efforts,"
she said." It represents the best part of ASES, what it's
about and the concept behind it."
Along with the summit, ASES coordinates a
speaker series that includes lectures and networking
dinners. ASES also offers its approximately 50 mem
bers a mentorship program that pairs undergraduate
students with Graduate School of Business students,
who give them career advice on an informal basis. Stu
dents involved in ASES span a wide range of majors
but share an interest in exploring entrepreneurship
opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region.
"In the past ASES was very engineering-based, but
we're not just engineering students," Chau said.
"There are biology majors and even art majors, so it
really runs the gamut. I guess one thing students have
in common is that they're all interested in networking
and meeting international students."
ASES marketing director and sophomore Alex
Selig said, "The mission of ASES is to provide the fu
ture leaders in business, technology and the Asia-Pa

cific with the tools and network needed to become
successful entrepreneurs in the Asia-Pacific Region."
ASES was once a part of the Stanford Society of
Asian-American Engineers (SSAE),founded in 1998.
The first ever ASES summit was held at Stanford in
2(XX), followed the next year by the first international
summit, which was held in Korea. In 2001, both ASES
and another SSAE program known as the Asian Tech
nology Initiative (ATI) branched off to become sepa
rate organizations.
Stanford remains the ASES flagship. Berkeley's
ASES chapter will not be sending delegates this year;
however, there will be attendees from the University
of Toronto. Other Western hemisphere chapters are in
development, and there are currently 12 ASES chap
ters in Asia.
This week's summit will mark the event's seventh
year.The theme is "One World, One Vision: Connect
ing Young Entrepreneurs around the Globe," meant
to underline the conference's main objective.
"Every year, the theme is basically the same —
after all, our mission stays the same," Chau said. "But
