## ASES holds seventh international summit 
### ADA YEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Forty students from 10 nations across the Asia-Pa
cific region will visit campus this week to learn about
global entrepreneurship and network with Stanford
students during a summit hosted by Stanford's Asia-
Pacific Entrepreneurship Society (ASES).
The delegates hail from such countries as China,
India, Thailand and Singapore, among others, where
most are members of developing or established ASES
chapters at their own universities. ASES holds two in
ternational summits each year, one in Asia and one at
Stanford. According to junior Melissa Chau, ASES
summit director, more than 150 students from chap
ters in Asia applied to attend this years conference on
campus.
Along with Stanford students and members of the
outside community — the summit has been publi
cized to local professional organizations — the dele
gates will hear from Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and
ASES alumni in a series of speeches and panels. They
will also participate in workshops and "teambuilding
activities." The ultimate goal of the summit is to edu

cate students about entrepreneurship and to bring
young entrepreneurs from around the world to a sin
gle place where they can exchange ideas, Chau said.
"1 think the summit is the pinnacle of our efforts,"
she said." It represents the best part of ASES, what it's
about and the concept behind it."
Along with the summit, ASES coordinates a
speaker series that includes lectures and networking
dinners. ASES also offers its approximately 50 mem
bers a mentorship program that pairs undergraduate
students with Graduate School of Business students,
who give them career advice on an informal basis. Stu
dents involved in ASES span a wide range of majors
but share an interest in exploring entrepreneurship
opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region.
"In the past ASES was very engineering-based, but
we're not just engineering students," Chau said.
"There are biology majors and even art majors, so it
really runs the gamut. I guess one thing students have
in common is that they're all interested in networking
and meeting international students."
ASES marketing director and sophomore Alex
Selig said, "The mission of ASES is to provide the fu
ture leaders in business, technology and the Asia-Pa

cific with the tools and network needed to become
successful entrepreneurs in the Asia-Pacific Region."
ASES was once a part of the Stanford Society of
Asian-American Engineers (SSAE),founded in 1998.
The first ever ASES summit was held at Stanford in
2(XX), followed the next year by the first international
summit, which was held in Korea. In 2001, both ASES
and another SSAE program known as the Asian Tech
nology Initiative (ATI) branched off to become sepa
rate organizations.
Stanford remains the ASES flagship. Berkeley's
ASES chapter will not be sending delegates this year;
however, there will be attendees from the University
of Toronto. Other Western hemisphere chapters are in
development, and there are currently 12 ASES chap
ters in Asia.
This week's summit will mark the event's seventh
year.The theme is "One World, One Vision: Connect
ing Young Entrepreneurs around the Globe," meant
to underline the conference's main objective.
"Every year, the theme is basically the same —
after all, our mission stays the same," Chau said. "But

ing Tony Luh, who delivered the keynote lecture Constructing the Vi
sion" last night.
this year, we are really emphasizing
that we're connecting people from dif
ferent parts of the world. 'One World,
One Vision' emphasizes that the
world is really kind of small now."
According to Chau, the first day of
the conference is intended to provide
an introduction to entrepreneurship,
its definition and the idea of cross-cul
tural entrepreneurship. Attendees
will hear from ASES advisor electri
cal engineering and Asian languages
Prof. Richard Dasher, executive di
rector of Stanford's Center for Inte
grated Systems, as well as an alumni
panel. On the second day, students
will learn about specific skills needed
to start a business. Students will also
learn about innovation in the Silicon
Valley and global entrepreneurship.
The panels and lectures are open
to the public. Delegates and ASES
members will also participate in other
activities such the "e-pitch," in which
teams will pitch a mock business plan;
ASES summit planners cut down on
the number of lectures and panels in
favor of expanding the e-pitch, which
was introduced last year. Also for the
first time, delegates and ASES mem
bers will mingle with alumni and
keynote speakers at a networking re
ception after the final keynote speech
on Friday.
Delegates and ASES members
will also be visiting Apple and Inn
odesign, a company that has designed
products for Samsung.
"This gives students a chance to
see everything put into action." Chau
said."They've learned what entrepre
neurship is and what kind of skills you
need,and now we go into what are the
hot industries now and try to visit
companies that put it all together."
The summit will include keynote
speakers such as Peter Thiel, co
founder of Pay Pal and president of
Clarium Capital; Sanjay Subhedar,
managing partner of Storm Ventures;
and Tony Luh, managing partner of
Dragon Venture. The closing keynote
speaker will be Elon Musk, who co
founded Pay Pal and is founder of
SpaceX, a space travel company.
"I am really looking forward to
Elon Musk's keynote this Friday,"
Selig said. "He is a classic serial entre
preneur and has founded several very
successful companies."

Sophomore Zhihao Zhang organ
ized events for the last day of the con
ference and was responsible for con
tacting and inviting Musk to speak.
"He has a whole canon of different
experiences in different areas of tech
nology, so that's really, really cool,"
Zhang said of the well-known entre
preneur. "Even the dean of engineer
ing from Stanford was really excited
when he heard that Elon Musk was
coming, so the dean's assistant
emailed us and asked how to get in
contact with [Musk]. I knew Elon

Musk was big entrepreneur-wise, but I
guess 1 realized the enormity of it at
that moment."
Zhang highlighted the perks pro
vided by the summit.
"You start to realize that at Stan
ford, you're in a great position to con
tact people," Zhang said. "Once you
get in contact, these people are always
looking for interns, and if you make a
good impression, you can apply for a
job with them."
Chau stressed the opportunity to
meet students from other nations.

"I think the best thing about the
summit is the friends you make from
all over the world ," Chau said. "I still
keep in touch with the people 1 met
from last year, and if I were in China
and needed someone to show me
around, I would have someone to
show me around."
She added, "In end it's about the
relationships you make. The lectures
are cool and everything, but those
connections are pretty important."

will learn about specific skills needed
to start a business. Students will also
learn about innovation in the Silicon
Valley and global entrepreneurship.
The panels and lectures are open
to the public. Delegates and ASES
members will also participate in other
activities such the "e-pitch," in which
teams will pitch a mock business plan;
ASES summit planners cut down on
the number of lectures and panels in
favor of expanding the e-pitch, which
was introduced last year. Also for the
first time, delegates and ASES mem
bers will mingle with alumni and
keynote speakers at a networking re
ception after the final keynote speech
on Friday.
Delegates and ASES members
will also be visiting Apple and Inn
odesign, a company that has designed
products for Samsung.
"This gives students a chance to
see everything put into action." Chau
said."They've learned what entrepre
neurship is and what kind of skills you
need,and now we go into what are the
hot industries now and try to visit
companies that put it all together."
The summit will include keynote
speakers such as Peter Thiel, co
founder of Pay Pal and president of
Clarium Capital; Sanjay Subhedar,
managing partner of Storm Ventures;
and Tony Luh, managing partner of
Dragon Venture. The closing keynote
speaker will be Elon Musk, who co
founded Pay Pal and is founder of
SpaceX, a space travel company.
"I am really looking forward to
Elon Musk's keynote this Friday,"
Selig said. "He is a classic serial entre
preneur and has founded several very
successful companies."

Sophomore Zhihao Zhang organ
ized events for the last day of the con
ference and was responsible for con
tacting and inviting Musk to speak.
"He has a whole canon of different
experiences in different areas of tech
nology, so that's really, really cool,"
Zhang said of the well-known entre
preneur. "Even the dean of engineer
ing from Stanford was really excited
when he heard that Elon Musk was
coming, so the dean's assistant
emailed us and asked how to get in
contact with [Musk]. I knew Elon

Musk was big entrepreneur-wise, but I
guess 1 realized the enormity of it at
that moment."
Zhang highlighted the perks pro
vided by the summit.
"You start to realize that at Stan
ford, you're in a great position to con
tact people," Zhang said. "Once you
get in contact, these people are always
looking for interns, and if you make a
good impression, you can apply for a
job with them."
Chau stressed the opportunity to
meet students from other nations.

"I think the best thing about the
summit is the friends you make from
all over the world ," Chau said. "I still
keep in touch with the people 1 met
from last year, and if I were in China
and needed someone to show me
around, I would have someone to
show me around."
She added, "In end it's about the
relationships you make. The lectures
are cool and everything, but those
connections are pretty important."
Forty students from 10 nations across the Asia-Pa
cific region will visit campus this week to learn about
global entrepreneurship and network with Stanford
students during a summit hosted by Stanford's Asia-
Pacific Entrepreneurship Society (ASES).
The delegates hail from such countries as China,
India, Thailand and Singapore, among others, where
most are members of developing or established ASES
chapters at their own universities. ASES holds two in
ternational summits each year, one in Asia and one at
Stanford. According to junior Melissa Chau, ASES
summit director, more than 150 students from chap
ters in Asia applied to attend this years conference on
campus.
Along with Stanford students and members of the
outside community — the summit has been publi
cized to local professional organizations — the dele
gates will hear from Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and
ASES alumni in a series of speeches and panels. They
will also participate in workshops and "teambuilding
activities." The ultimate goal of the summit is to edu

cate students about entrepreneurship and to bring
young entrepreneurs from around the world to a sin
gle place where they can exchange ideas, Chau said.
"1 think the summit is the pinnacle of our efforts,"
she said." It represents the best part of ASES, what it's
about and the concept behind it."
Along with the summit, ASES coordinates a
speaker series that includes lectures and networking
dinners. ASES also offers its approximately 50 mem
bers a mentorship program that pairs undergraduate
students with Graduate School of Business students,
who give them career advice on an informal basis. Stu
dents involved in ASES span a wide range of majors
but share an interest in exploring entrepreneurship
opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region.
"In the past ASES was very engineering-based, but
we're not just engineering students," Chau said.
"There are biology majors and even art majors, so it
really runs the gamut. I guess one thing students have
in common is that they're all interested in networking
and meeting international students."
ASES marketing director and sophomore Alex
Selig said, "The mission of ASES is to provide the fu
ture leaders in business, technology and the Asia-Pa

cific with the tools and network needed to become
successful entrepreneurs in the Asia-Pacific Region."
ASES was once a part of the Stanford Society of
Asian-American Engineers (SSAE),founded in 1998.
The first ever ASES summit was held at Stanford in
2(XX), followed the next year by the first international
summit, which was held in Korea. In 2001, both ASES
and another SSAE program known as the Asian Tech
nology Initiative (ATI) branched off to become sepa
rate organizations.
Stanford remains the ASES flagship. Berkeley's
ASES chapter will not be sending delegates this year;
however, there will be attendees from the University
of Toronto. Other Western hemisphere chapters are in
development, and there are currently 12 ASES chap
ters in Asia.
This week's summit will mark the event's seventh
year.The theme is "One World, One Vision: Connect
ing Young Entrepreneurs around the Globe," meant
to underline the conference's main objective.
"Every year, the theme is basically the same —
after all, our mission stays the same," Chau said. "But

ing Tony Luh, who delivered the keynote lecture Constructing the Vi
sion" last night.
this year, we are really emphasizing
that we're connecting people from dif
ferent parts of the world. 'One World,
One Vision' emphasizes that the
world is really kind of small now."
According to Chau, the first day of
the conference is intended to provide
an introduction to entrepreneurship,
its definition and the idea of cross-cul
tural entrepreneurship. Attendees
will hear from ASES advisor electri
cal engineering and Asian languages
Prof. Richard Dasher, executive di
rector of Stanford's Center for Inte
grated Systems, as well as an alumni
panel. On the second day, students
