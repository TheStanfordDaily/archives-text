# Graduate Life
## Who moved my Old Union? 
### 
Some two-and-a-half hundred years
ago. Rev. Jonathan Mayhew pro
claimed "No taxation without repre
sentation" and the nation agreed. Isn't it
ironic that grad students studying in that
same nation today aren't as infuriated
about paying ASSU fees even though
they have no real voice on University
committees?
Every year, the Nominations Commis
sion nominates hundreds of students to
represent more than 40 University commit
tees. It's not that grad students aren't invit
ed. They just aren't interested.
There are even strict requirements try
ing to ensure grad student involvement in
these committees. But if you feel that
these bodies are filled in by inconspicuous
and inconsequential representatives
rather than by enthusiastic, charismatic,
effective and responsible candidates like
you. then the fault, my dear friend, is en
tirely yours.
Most of the organizations are heavily
populated by undergraduates because
many graduate students consider active in
volvement in University affairs too de
manding, dreadful or demeaning.
Don't you want to ensure that Stanford
responsibly invests in companies and insti
tutions that don't violate human rights?
Don't organizational violations of Univer
sity policies and practices bother you a bit?
Wouldn't you want to engage in thoughtful
discussion concerning sexual assault poli
cies and protocol at Stanford?
We, the geekv jerky lab rats that we are,
seem to be content in our own little, reclu
sive world. But how insulated are we from
the rest of the campus? Someone changed
the contracts at Tresidder Union. It wasn't
us, but they changed what we ate every day
and how much we paid for it.
Someone decided to move Old Union.
It wasn't us, but now we have to figure out
where to go to pay tuition. How can we ex
clude ourselves from decisions about on
campus voice, video, network communica
tion services, email and file services? How
can we let others decide about graduate
studies, grad housing, research and li
braries?
As one outgoing committee member
Dmitry Belogolovsky comments "Stanford
changes everyday. Committees help bring
student voice to the process and to create
visible and significant impact. Change
doesn't happen on its own; administrators
and students work side by side to help the
school continue to prosper."
We still critically analyze all of these
decisions in our labs and offices, in corri
dors and by coolers. But critics don't
count. People only make a difference if
they actually shake off the apathy and go
to work on the committees making these
influential decisions.
So, instead of merely talking about the
inefficiency and imperfection of the com
mittees, do something about it! As some
one has rightly noted. "Anyone who has
had a bull by the tail knows five or six
things more than someone who hasn't."
Moreover, these committees are not
massive organizations where you eat pizza
and drink soda and listen to someone bab
bling about incomprehensible details.
Committees are generally very small, and
students work closely with upper-level ad
ministrators. You get to talk. And unlike
many of the research meetings you attend,
you would be heard. You matter.
And you would work closely with many
others who matter. Wouldn't it be great to
be on a first-name basis with the Johns of
Stanford: Hennessy and Etchemendy and
Bravman? For reference, 1 haven't been
able to even see Bravman in my four long
years in the Materials Science Department
at Stanford. The Board of Trustees, the
Academic Council, the provost, the presi
dent, the dean of the School of Humanities
and Sciences, the dean of student affairs
and the chief information officer address a
variety of issues affecting all walks of stu
dent life. And instead of sitting in a confer
ence room and speculating about what stu
dents might like, they would much rather
have students in the room so they can sim
ply ask them.
Stanford is not just about classes; it's a
community, it's a family. And like responsi
ble family members, we all should partici
pate in family decisions.
