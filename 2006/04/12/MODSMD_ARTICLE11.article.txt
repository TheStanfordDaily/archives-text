# Birth control access, knowledge scarce in immigrant communities
## 
### FANNIE CHEN, MEGAN WATKINS MARISA HAMMONDS 
A female student walks into
Vaden, wanting to know what
to do to get rid of the hacking
cough she's had for a month. Logical
ly, then, the first question the nurse
asks her is — are you on birth con
trol? Or pregnant? Or seeking birth
control? The emphasis on birth con
trol has become a running joke on
campus. But for many women in
nearby communities, it is far from
such.
"The baseline knowledge of the
middle school girls that we work with
in East Palo Alto is incredibly low,"
says Stacey Kallem, a director of the
Stanford chapter of the national

group Women and Youth Supporting
Each Other (WYSE). "Since sexual
education is at a minimum in schools
and is not often discussed in the
home due to cultural norms, young
girls end up lacking correct informa
tion. Any program that provides
them with family planning resources
is greatly beneficial."
There are programs that do at
tempt to address this issue. WYSE,
for example, works with a group of
middle school girls in East Palo Alto,
providing mentoring and sexual
health education in order to better in
form them about their options.
Federal and state governments

have also made efforts to address the
lack of access to reproductive health
services often faced by the immigrants
and poor. Under Medicaid, states
have the option to apply to receive
higher portions of federai funding for
family planning services. In order to
receive full Medicaid benefits, a per
son must fall below a certain income
level defined by each state. In states
that have received additional funding
for family planning services, this in
come threshold is higher, allowing
more people to access these services.
California's state government has
exercised this option, using its in
creased federal funding to create a
program called Family PACT.
Through Family PACT, patients can
receive free family planning services
such as testing for sexually transmit
ted infections (STI), contraceptives
and annual exams.
Unlike programs in most other

states. Family PACT offers these
services to both men and women.
And according to Rachel Gold. Di
rector of Policy Analysis at the
Guttmacher Institute, a non-profit
organization dedicated to reproduc
tive health policy research. Califor
nia's Family PACT is unique beyond
its coverage of both genders.
"California is the only state to
have a component of their family
planning waiver that is state-funded
to provide services to people who do
not meet the requirements for feder
al funding, including those pertaining
to immigrants," she says.
While some may consider the
number of immigrants to be insignif
icant, California in 2(H)2 was home to
more than a quarter of the nation's
immigrant population, according to
the California Department of Fi
nance.
Although there niav be concerns

that Family PACT increases financial
burdens. Gold says that the program
actually saves money for both the
state and federal governments.
"Data from Family PACT show
that year after year, the program has
saved millions of dollars by helping
women avoid unintended pregnancy
money that would have otherwise
been spent on birth costs and preg
nancy-related care."
Under Family PACT, minors are
eligible to receive service subject to
the income requirement. Because
they can state their own income
rather than that of their parents,
nearly all are eligible.
At places like Planned Parent
hood, women covered by Family
PACT can receive services such as "a
birth control method, plus testing and
treatment for sexually transmitted
diseases or vaginal infections, routine
annual exams and Pap smear tests,"

according to the Planned Parenthood
website. Men "can receive condoms
and STD testing and treatment, [as
well as] vasectomy for men seeking
permanent sterilization."
Pacific Free Clinic, a free clinic
supported by Stanford that serves
California's immigrant population,
holds Women's Clinic with an OB
GYN once a month, providing con
traceptives, annual exams and STI
testing. While this increases access to
free services beyond Family PACT,
Stanford medical student and clinic
manager Lily Kao believes that im
provements in care can still be made.
"Ideally our patients would re
ceive regular follow-up (annual pap
smears) — and a small subset of our
patients do return regularly," Kao
says. "But the majority of patients
make it to clinic when they can —
that is, sporadically — so it is difficult
to optimize their care."
