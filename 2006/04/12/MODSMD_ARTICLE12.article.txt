# When you think global warming, act locally

£ £ "T" "X"onk if you're against genocide."
O
It you've had occasion to pass the inter
section of El Camino and Embarcadero over
the past several months, you're likely to have
encountered a sign calling for action against
the violence in Darfur, Sudan. It's sometimes
held by an elderly woman, once by a middle
school girl, but always by someone who
makes you feel that you're a poor user of the
First Amendment. The sign tends to spark
two reactions in me.
I"he first is that I think genocide is bad,
and I want it to stop, so I honk. The second is
that I wonder why I bothered to. A critical
mass of honking does not cause peacekeep
ers to materialize in northern Africa. Always,
I leave frustrated, feeling moved by a call to
action but left impotent to effect change.
I imagine many of the 120-odd attendees
of former Environmental Protection Agency
Administrator Carol Browner's talk on glob
al warming last night may have left feeling
the same way.
For an audience in the Graduate School
of Business, Browner came equipped with
convincing numbers, like 928 — the number
of peer-reviewed papers that the journal Sci
ence read to assess scholarly opinion on cli
mate change. Zero was the number of papers
that challenged the merits of the climate

change hypothesis.
Another convincing number: 11 — the
number of countries, including the United
States, whose national science academies
said in 2005 that the knowledge about cli
mate change is thorough enough to justify
immediate action.
Global warming is not a partisan issue,
Browner argued. Her conclusion: It's time
for Congress to pass national legislation im
plementing a cap-and-trade program for
greenhouse gas emissions. Like Time maga
zine, she's had enough of the nay-sayers and
science fiction authors like Michael Crichton
passing as expert scientific witnesses in the
U.S. Congress.
And she convinced me. But, Browner was
likely preaching to the choir — and the choir
may not have liked the chorus.
Browner acknowledged that environ
mental groups and activists have been calling
for action on climate change for years but
said that major action on environmental is
sues tends only to come when the govern
ment in successful at engaging the business
community. A constituency that craves pre
dictability and certainty, businesses dislike
inconsistent laws on carbon dioxide emis
sions and increased insurance premiums
prompted by fear of likely-catastrophic con
sequences. When the prospect of that world
approaches, they'd rather it be regulated to

ensure consistency, even if it costs a few extra
dollars.
When asked by an audience member
what individuals can do to help combat
global warming. Browner's answer was
simple: "Not all problems in society need
to focus on individual actions." That is. a
coal or aluminum plant is responsible for a
lot more greenhouse gas emissions than a
Palo Alto home.so let's focus on the forest
and not get bogged down in the trees. Busi
nesses, she claimed, are likely to act not
because of swells in public sentiment
against global warming, but because they
have to.
So whither the role of the citizen, then,
standing on the corner, urging passers by to
"Honk if you're against global warming"?
Or. more appropriately, "Honk if you're bik
ing."
In part. Browner is right — history bears
out her point that legislative action on envi
ronmental issues proceeds much more easily
when businesses are on board, or can at least
envision a technological solution to the prob
lent at hand. The private sector, for example,
was largely ahead of the government when
concerns about stratospheric ozone deple
tion caused the phase-out of chlorofluoro
carbons (CFCs).
But. just as many Palo Alto residents re
fuse to feel too small to challenge genocide,
despite what Browner says, you shouldn't
feel like too minor of a player to affect move
ments to rein in climate change.
Some of the business imperatives Brown
er credited for eventually enabling regula
tion of greenhouse gases have necessarily
been the result of local rather than national
actions. The actions of mayors and states
across the country (and of continents across
the Atlantic) to create their own greenhouse

gas regulations create some of the pesky un
predictability that Browner says businesses
abhor. One vote may not seem so powerful in
a national election, but in a city referendum
you hold greater power. Another imperative,
shareholder mandates,are the direct result of
citi/ens bringing their wishes to bear on busi
nesses.
And. there is always the issue to which
Browner devoted a large portion of her talk:
public understanding.Though this may seem
less important when action on science-relat
ed issues is delegated to businesses, it be
comes important when local communities
can encourage change.
I asked Browner, if the scientific commu
nity was so sure about global warming, and
that confidence was relayed to the public,
why did there remain such public confusion?
She replied that too many Americans
lacked an understanding of scientific
processes, making it easier for nay-sayers to
create public misunderstanding. To the aver
age citizen, a climate change skeptic's call for
more science can cause listeners to conclude
that a scientific consensus does not exist. In
reality, while there can always be more stud
ies. this doesn't undermine the existence of a
consensus based on a critical volume of good
studies.
A lack of public science literacy may be

part of the problem, but not all of it. Upon
returning from Browner's talk. I was sur
prised to hear several Stanford students say
they were skeptical about the reality of
global warming. They didn't want to simply
hear the scientists to regurgitate the same
claims — they wanted to see the proof
themselves. For example, how can we be
certain there is causation between higher
CO2 levels and higher temperatures, and
not just correlation? Without taking the
time to search out this information them
selves, they were not willing to say they
thought global warming theories were
wrong — but neither would they make the
leap to claiming the theories were right.
Laypeople may be willing to take scien
tists' claims at face value. But for especially
well-educated audiences, the scientific com
munity and media may have failed to pres
ent sufficient detail about climate change to
enable people to decide for themselves how
robust the evidence is.
While, at the end of the day.the business
community may possess the most clout on
Capitol Hill, the scales tip in the favor of citi
zens in local communities, cities and even
some states. So instead of feeling helpless or
just honking to raise awareness about global
warming, engage with your peers about the
lingering questions that exist about climate
change.
This column will do so next week. Send
questions about global warming, from
whether current warming may be a natural
fluctuation to how such bold conclusions can
be drawn from a relatively small body of
data,tojag()s@stanford.edu. Next week, with
the input of Stanford scientists, we'll print re
sponses that should give you the material to
decide for yourself whether you need to go
hybrid or go home.
