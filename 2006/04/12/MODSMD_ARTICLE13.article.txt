## Editorial Heng and Graham set goals they can achieve 
### 
Elizabeth Heng and Lauren Graham
are the best executive slate choice.
They appear well-equipped to
achieve the realistic goals they have set out
for themselves.
During our interviews with all three
slates, the Editorial Board found Heng and
Graham's modest plans underwhelming at
first. Many of their proposals are designed
to improve random aspects of campus life
and would cater primarily to undergradu
ates. However, their goals also seem to be
the most reasonable given the short term
they would be in office.
For instance, Heng and Graham plan to
have the revamped Undergraduate Advis
ing Program assign two advisers to each in
coming freshman to create a more consol
idated advising system. They also intend to
foster greater interaction between student
organizations, encouraging various groups
to stretch their limited funding resources
by hosting joint events.
If elected. Heng and Graham should be
held accountable for their more populist
campaign promises, including their pledge
to make Dead Week actually dead.The pair
should also make good on their promise to
revive the Mausoleum Party next year.
Heng and Graham both seem to be peo
ple who know how to throw a party. To
gether, they plan to reinvigorate the ailing
Stanford social scene. In addition to the
Mausoleum Party, they plan to organize a
Pool Party and a Homecoming Block Party
on the Row. As student government veter
ans. the duo brings a lot of experience in
event planning to the table, having coordi
nated many large-scale events in the past.
We hope that Heng and Graham will
grow out of their image as party organizers
extraordinaire into a team that aspires to
greater things.
On some level, we wish that they had
made bolder campaign promises similar to

their opponents Marc Rillera and Chris
Nguyen. Running on a platform targeting
both undergraduates and graduate stu
dents, Rillera and Nguyen put together a
coherent campaign centered around re
ducing the cost of living at Stanford. Their
strategy involves reverting to a multi
priced dining plan for undergraduates and
providing more stipends and healthcare
subsidies for graduate students.
Generally, we are hesitant to punish a
slate for its ambition. However, Rillera
and Nguyen have made promises that
would be hard to keep. We do not see how
they could get the funding to put their
plans into action. And even if they were
implemented, we doubt that these meas
ures would significantly reduce the costs
that students have to bear.
Case in point, consider their respective
proposals to address the lack of student
space. Rillera and Nguyen plan to divert
profits from Stanford Student Enterprises
away from the ASSU endowment to a fund
for building new facilities. In contrast,
Heng and Graham modestly — and more
realistically — propose increasing the
level of student input in the plans for the
second floor of Tresidder Union once ren
ovations at Old Union are complete.
Our only advice to Heng and Graham is
to dispense with the aura of professional
ism. We know that the pair have a wealth of
ASSU experience, but they should be care
ful about name-dropping and using ASSU
jargon when talking to their voters. They
need to remember that open communica
tion is key to their success as executives, in
spite of their prior experience with the
ASSU.
We believe that Heng and Graham have
set themselves modest and realistic goals
that they are likely to achieve; they should
n't feel compelled to hide their ability be
hind a facade of showmanship.
