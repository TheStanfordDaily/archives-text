# Memory filing cabinet
## 
### 
It hit me somewhere near the Denny's in
Union City at 5:30 a.m. I couldn't re
member the last time I saw the sun rise. I
also couldn't remember the last time that
there was so much hilarity in simply being
alive.
We just victoriously completed the
beloved Stanford rite of The Game. Unless I
appear on "The Amazing Race," I can't think
of any other reason why I would spend 24
hours with three people in a car, in a cave or
on a mountain, to the point of mental and/or
physical exhaustion. Although I lost all sense
of time immediately after our journey
ended. I felt like I could probably take on the
world, if asked.
The most memorable and the most hilar
ious moments of The Game did not center
on the big points of interest at all.The 7/11 in
Berkeley, where we worked out a clue while
leaning over the coffee counter for a half
hour and being regarded suspiciously by an
entirely confused cashier. Being mistaken
for pro-fros at Santa Clara University. Sail
ing through the deserted streets of San Fran
cisco at 4 a.m. as if we were in a theme park.
Incredible.
But now. as I sit writing a column about
events that occurred only a few hours ago, I
feel as if I have stepped into some rift in the
time-space continuum. There have been
many moments during my Stanford career
when I have been conscious of an event pass
ing out of my immediate memory and into
the warehouse of college-era stories where
they will be stored until I haul them out at
the cocktail parties of my future. But the
overwhelming excitement that accompanies
moments of college awesomeness seeps out
of me all too quickly. Events that happened
only a day or a week or a quarter ago settle
into filing cabinets that, mind you, are well
organized and accessible, but are remote
from my present consciousness.
Maybe it relates to my scrapbooking
hobby,or to my constant vigilance in looking
for subjects for these columns. I do some
times catch myself thinking about what a

nice photo spread a certain moment is going
to make in my sophomore scrapbook while I
am in the middle of something, or Ill plan an
event with the intention of writing about it
afterwards. But 1 don't think this is the issue.
It seems that during the span of college
we must make more memories than is rea
sonable given that this is only a four-year pe
riod of our lives. There's so much potential,
not only for coniing-of-age epiphanies but
also for random moments of fun or debauch
ery (or both) that will be integral in the
canon of our memories. Life moves fast — it
seems surreal that Stanford is nearly half
over for me.
I went through a five-day period last
quarter when I recorded how I spent every
minute of my days, from conversations to
class to computer games. Maybe it was an at
tempt to recapture the time that I can feel
slipping away. There's so much that happens
on a day-to-day basis in college, and what
seems pivotal today may be easily forgotten
tomorrow. Which I suppose is why I feel like
I file memories away so quickly now. But I
wish there were a better way.
Perhaps all this angsty, metaphysical
musing is self-defeating. I shouldn't mourn
how quickly life passes; I should just live it.
I'm only 19, and I'm planning on making it to
100 — I suppose this is not the time or place
to devote major energies to reflecting on the
transience of life.
I can always do that when I'm 20.

Is Marissa's column too reminiscent of an
angsty live journal this week? Tell her about it
