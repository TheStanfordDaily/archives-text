# My thoughts on RENT
## 
### 
I have been meaning to write this column
for months,but there have been a number
of ongoing "distractions" that have capti
vated my attention, for better or worse. So, if
it seems like my timing is a bit out of place,
just know that I am only making an attempt
to share my thoughts before the "RENT con
versations" of today fade out of the collective
memory of contemporary arts and entertain
ment.
RENT first came into my life by way of
compact disc while I was a lonely high school
student in rural South Dakota. Its truth of
message was what initially spoke to me and
still resounds strongly in my personal mis
sion. 1 knew at the time that its message was
relevant to my life and situation, but it
seemed so far removed and idealized (if not
idolized). Sure, people of different races, gen
ders, orientations and cultures could be
friends and love one another in New York
City, but this world was completely different
than anything I ever knew. RENT spoke to
me like a dream, a place where 1 could have
these friends, be like them and still be "ok."
Their abnormality wasn't something to lie
about â€” it was beautiful and embraced.
Even the ugly side of their humanity was ac
knowledged and accepted. It just seemed so
far away from me at the time, when 1 was in
high school student caught up in a world of
lies whose construction, maintenance and
preservation captured the majority of my en
ergy and attention.
RENT came into my life again in college
when 1 first saw a traveling production in St.

Paul, Minnesota.The message came to life in
ways that illuminated my perception of life's
possibilities, opportunities and the capacity
that I have to enjoy truthful living. It was at
this point that I memorized the majority of
the lyrics and began to feel like I could live
truthfully anywhere, even if it wasn't New
York City.
Imagine my surprise when I was accepted
to graduate school at Columbia University
and, largely by coincidence, found myself liv
ing in Manhattan as a starving student. Sud
denly I looked around and realized that my
friends, my life and my world were no differ
ent from those of my dreams. The messages
echoed anew. "No day but today! Take me
for what I am! 1 live this moment as my last!"
I didn't just sing it. I tried to live it, in my own
way.
RENT came back into my life last fall as I
eagerly awaited its release in theaters around
the country. I looked to it as a reminder of my
life and friends in New York, I nearly cried as
I watched the trailer to "Seasons of Love"
and I was first in line for popcorn when the
concession stand opened.

Only this time, I was disappointed. At the
risk of sounding like a complete snob, I did
n't really like the movie all that much. I am
sure that I could go on and on about the
shortcomings of the Hollywood version, or
the comparative strengths of other rendi
tions. but I suspect that they would only pro
vide others with bias, so I'll save them for
later.
However, the things I appreciate about
RENT are those aspects of the show that
bring people together, remind us of our
shared humanity and allow us to pursue lives
of utmost truth. My only encouragement at
this point is that we keep the songs, the peo
ple and the message(s) alive in ways that
translate into greater awareness and moti
vate action. In my opinion, the worst fate that
RENT could suffer would be that of an iso
lated Hollywood attempt to make a few
bucks, sell some tickets or add clutter to our
DVD collections.
So to the critics I say: take your pick. If the
CD speaks to you, sing along. If the show ex
cites your heart and thoughts, try to see it live.
And if the DVD does it for you, watch it
again and again! Perhaps the best thing
about RENT is that it means so many differ
ent things to so many different types of peo
ple. In the end, I hope the media of these
channels only reminds us that the song con
tinues so long as it has singers.
