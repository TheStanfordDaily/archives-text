# The 						great dragon race
## 
### 
Winter Quarter ended with the Great
Dragon Race, the Mechanical En
gineering 112 final project — a
showdown between three mechanized mon
sters. Diddy, formerly known as Puff, was the
thinnest of the bunch, inching forward on
spindly legs which, along with the insistent
squeak of his little hinges, made him seem
like a mutated meth lab tarantula. The
Nameless One. a two-headed glamour boy.
was slow but pretty, with a solid green sheen
and bright orange scales decorating his back.
And then there was Trogdor — the Strong-
Bad Email brought to horrifying life — a
Frankenstein creation with an S-shaped
body and a steroidal human arm protruding
from his hypothetical kneecaps.
The race occurred in the third floor clus
ter of the Berlin center. It was a quiet study
roost, away and above the clamor of the
lounge. The Dragons had to crawl across a
ceiling beam, leftover from the Kaiser Wil
helm era. Everyone was watching — interna
tional relations majors who came to Berlin
because one quarter abroad is required and

Berlin has no language prereq; film majors
who came for the Film Festival and the night
clubs; German studies majors who came for
obvious reasons. After the race was over and
the class requirements satisfied, the only
thing left was the Duel — a game of "Chick
en." with the Last Dragon Hanging the win
ner. The showdown was vicious, but a bit sad;
that was the last time we were all together.
We had a hell of a crew last quarter. Part
ly because of the demographics — everyone
had someone in their comfort zone, racially,
politically, sexually or major-ly.There should
be a picture of us in the admissions hand
book, giving a GI Joe thumbs-up to the cam

era: "Diversity, Yeah!" A few people I knew
before; some I never would've met (unless
they took a film class for fun or I took a me
chanical engineering class for suicide). Those
random friendships are special, the long days
and nights with people you've got nothing in
common with except a couple months of
close proximity. Like in "The Breakfast
Club,"it won't be the same back home, with
the old lives, friends, responsibilities, etc.
There are too many great and terrible
times to recount in full. There were nights of
high drama, like our visit to the East Berlin
heroin-den club, where promises were bro
ken, tears were shed, old animosities re
turned in time to welcome new animosities
to the table, lips met with striking and contro
versial frequency and a quiet man on a couch
handed out semi-legal substances with a
stone-faced nod. There was the "Night that
No One Remembers," when, following the
Bing Dinner, a few of us made our way to a
little bar called Travolta and stayed for the


Darren
Franich
Eins! Swei! Drei!
night, talking hot gossip and imperi
alist history and inventing the game
that gave this column its name. None
of us recall taking pictures; we took
more than a hundred.
There was the weekend we drove
down to Munich on the Autobahn,
hitting 2(X) km/h in the slow lane, ten
sions rising as we spent long days
wedged Tetris-style in the rental
Mercedes. That weekend we went to
the Hofbrauhaus, a legendary beer
hall with an Oompah band, serving
wenches and liter-cups of the finest
Bavarian beer. It was the second
time we met the Florence program, a
comically troublesome gang of va
grant personalities. The running joke
all quarter was that wherever they
went, problems followed — whether
in the form of awkward drunken
hookups, awkward post-hookup
breakdowns or awkward post
breakdown apologies.
There were the guys' vain at
tempts to woo German ladies. It's
hard. Besides the language gap (they
often forget their English when they
sense American boys about), women
here hate it when guys come up to
them in a club and dance — or
maybe their sneer-and-exit reaction

is a subtle come-on.
There was the ongoing story of
Walter's Sprachpartner Seduction
— the boy's daring quest to hook up
with his language partner, a blonde
with a supermodel's disinterested
pout etched permanently on her
pretty face. We were all pulling for
Walt, even after he held their first
date/meeting in the Holocaust Mu
seum.
We had our outsized personali
ties. There was Christian, doing back
flips in crowded bars; Marie, still
finding new debaucherous corners
of town six months later; Johanna,
the cantankerous Spaniard with a
heart of gold and a loveable distaste
for all things Americana; Angel, the
group Enrique, a man incapable of
looking less than stellar on camera;
and the Brothers Meier/Meyer,
Crew-playing All American Boys.
Toward the quarter's end, John got
admitted to Princeton and Cal Poly
Engineering, and the photo series
tracing his victorious massacre of a
meter of beer deserves a place in the
Smithsonian.
We had our fair share of contro
versy and conflict. Still, as Diddy
ripped into Trogdor, it was hard for
everyone not to get together one
last time, the nerdy gladiatorial
thrill uniting even the most fashion
ably nihilistic fuzzy. Diddy reversed,
his battering ram head stuck on
Trogdor's fragile face. With a pull.

Trogdor was nearly headless. "Kill
him! Kill the beast!" we all
screamed. And the only thing that
held back Diddy's killing blow was a
sudden battery drain on the remote
control. As Nathan performed com
bat surgery ("Anybody have a Dou
ble A?"), the Nameless One
swooped in from aft. pinching Trog
dor's broken body between his
awful brethren. And though his
head remained in Diddy's jaw, the
rest of him fell to the ground, slam
ming against the trap door with a
groaning, mortal WH AP.
We all clapped, took pictures of
the survivors, dispersed.The quarter
was over. We had loved each other,
hated each other. We discovered un
expected commonalities, grew to de
spise our eccentricities. We hooked
up and screwed up, studied and par
tied, slipped on the muddy slush on
the sidewalks, smoked hookah in Is
tanbul. wandered aimlessly through
chilly Dresden and drank flavored
absinthe like l l )th century French
decadents. Winter Berlin '06 were
gentlemen and bastards, sweethearts
and bitches, interesting characters
and utter bores, some of the best
people I've ever known and some of
the worst.
I miss the lot of you.

bastards and die bitches. Email him at

We had our fair share of contro
versy and conflict. Still, as Diddy
ripped into Trogdor, it was hard for
everyone not to get together one
last time, the nerdy gladiatorial
thrill uniting even the most fashion
ably nihilistic fuzzy. Diddy reversed,
his battering ram head stuck on
Trogdor's fragile face. With a pull.

Trogdor was nearly headless. "Kill
him! Kill the beast!" we all
screamed. And the only thing that
held back Diddy's killing blow was a
sudden battery drain on the remote
control. As Nathan performed com
bat surgery ("Anybody have a Dou
ble A?"), the Nameless One
swooped in from aft. pinching Trog
dor's broken body between his
awful brethren. And though his
head remained in Diddy's jaw, the
rest of him fell to the ground, slam
ming against the trap door with a
groaning, mortal WH AP.
We all clapped, took pictures of
the survivors, dispersed.The quarter
was over. We had loved each other,
hated each other. We discovered un
expected commonalities, grew to de
spise our eccentricities. We hooked
up and screwed up, studied and par
tied, slipped on the muddy slush on
the sidewalks, smoked hookah in Is
tanbul. wandered aimlessly through
chilly Dresden and drank flavored
absinthe like l l )th century French
decadents. Winter Berlin '06 were
gentlemen and bastards, sweethearts
and bitches, interesting characters
and utter bores, some of the best
people I've ever known and some of
the worst.
I miss the lot of you.

Winter Quarter ended with the Great
Dragon Race, the Mechanical En
gineering 112 final project — a
showdown between three mechanized mon
sters. Diddy, formerly known as Puff, was the
thinnest of the bunch, inching forward on
spindly legs which, along with the insistent
squeak of his little hinges, made him seem
like a mutated meth lab tarantula. The
Nameless One. a two-headed glamour boy.
was slow but pretty, with a solid green sheen
and bright orange scales decorating his back.
And then there was Trogdor — the Strong-
Bad Email brought to horrifying life — a
Frankenstein creation with an S-shaped
body and a steroidal human arm protruding
from his hypothetical kneecaps.
The race occurred in the third floor clus
ter of the Berlin center. It was a quiet study
roost, away and above the clamor of the
lounge. The Dragons had to crawl across a
ceiling beam, leftover from the Kaiser Wil
helm era. Everyone was watching — interna
tional relations majors who came to Berlin
because one quarter abroad is required and

Berlin has no language prereq; film majors
who came for the Film Festival and the night
clubs; German studies majors who came for
obvious reasons. After the race was over and
the class requirements satisfied, the only
thing left was the Duel — a game of "Chick
en." with the Last Dragon Hanging the win
ner. The showdown was vicious, but a bit sad;
that was the last time we were all together.
We had a hell of a crew last quarter. Part
ly because of the demographics — everyone
had someone in their comfort zone, racially,
politically, sexually or major-ly.There should
be a picture of us in the admissions hand
book, giving a GI Joe thumbs-up to the cam

era: "Diversity, Yeah!" A few people I knew
before; some I never would've met (unless
they took a film class for fun or I took a me
chanical engineering class for suicide). Those
random friendships are special, the long days
and nights with people you've got nothing in
common with except a couple months of
close proximity. Like in "The Breakfast
Club,"it won't be the same back home, with
the old lives, friends, responsibilities, etc.
There are too many great and terrible
times to recount in full. There were nights of
high drama, like our visit to the East Berlin
heroin-den club, where promises were bro
ken, tears were shed, old animosities re
turned in time to welcome new animosities
to the table, lips met with striking and contro
versial frequency and a quiet man on a couch
handed out semi-legal substances with a
stone-faced nod. There was the "Night that
No One Remembers," when, following the
Bing Dinner, a few of us made our way to a
little bar called Travolta and stayed for the


Darren
Franich
Eins! Swei! Drei!
night, talking hot gossip and imperi
alist history and inventing the game
that gave this column its name. None
of us recall taking pictures; we took
more than a hundred.
There was the weekend we drove
down to Munich on the Autobahn,
hitting 2(X) km/h in the slow lane, ten
sions rising as we spent long days
wedged Tetris-style in the rental
Mercedes. That weekend we went to
the Hofbrauhaus, a legendary beer
hall with an Oompah band, serving
wenches and liter-cups of the finest
Bavarian beer. It was the second
time we met the Florence program, a
comically troublesome gang of va
grant personalities. The running joke
all quarter was that wherever they
went, problems followed — whether
in the form of awkward drunken
hookups, awkward post-hookup
breakdowns or awkward post
breakdown apologies.
There were the guys' vain at
tempts to woo German ladies. It's
hard. Besides the language gap (they
often forget their English when they
sense American boys about), women
here hate it when guys come up to
them in a club and dance — or
maybe their sneer-and-exit reaction

is a subtle come-on.
There was the ongoing story of
Walter's Sprachpartner Seduction
— the boy's daring quest to hook up
with his language partner, a blonde
with a supermodel's disinterested
pout etched permanently on her
pretty face. We were all pulling for
Walt, even after he held their first
date/meeting in the Holocaust Mu
seum.
We had our outsized personali
ties. There was Christian, doing back
flips in crowded bars; Marie, still
finding new debaucherous corners
of town six months later; Johanna,
the cantankerous Spaniard with a
heart of gold and a loveable distaste
for all things Americana; Angel, the
group Enrique, a man incapable of
looking less than stellar on camera;
and the Brothers Meier/Meyer,
Crew-playing All American Boys.
Toward the quarter's end, John got
admitted to Princeton and Cal Poly
Engineering, and the photo series
tracing his victorious massacre of a
meter of beer deserves a place in the
Smithsonian.
