# The
						great dragon race

### 
Winter Quarter ended with the Great
Dragon Race, the Mechanical En
gineering 112 final project — a
showdown between three mechanized mon
sters. Diddy, formerly known as Puff, was the
thinnest of the bunch, inching forward on
spindly legs which, along with the insistent
squeak of his little hinges, made him seem
like a mutated meth lab tarantula. The
Nameless One. a two-headed glamour boy.
was slow but pretty, with a solid green sheen
and bright orange scales decorating his back.
And then there was Trogdor — the Strong-
Bad Email brought to horrifying life — a
Frankenstein creation with an S-shaped
body and a steroidal human arm protruding
from his hypothetical kneecaps.
The race occurred in the third floor clus
ter of the Berlin center. It was a quiet study
roost, away and above the clamor of the
lounge. The Dragons had to crawl across a
ceiling beam, leftover from the Kaiser Wil
helm era. Everyone was watching — interna
tional relations majors who came to Berlin
because one quarter abroad is required and

Berlin has no language prereq; film majors
who came for the Film Festival and the night
clubs; German studies majors who came for
obvious reasons. After the race was over and
the class requirements satisfied, the only
thing left was the Duel — a game of "Chick
en." with the Last Dragon Hanging the win
ner. The showdown was vicious, but a bit sad;
that was the last time we were all together.
We had a hell of a crew last quarter. Part
ly because of the demographics — everyone
had someone in their comfort zone, racially,
politically, sexually or major-ly.There should
be a picture of us in the admissions hand
book, giving a GI Joe thumbs-up to the cam

era: "Diversity, Yeah!" A few people I knew
before; some I never would've met (unless
they took a film class for fun or I took a me
chanical engineering class for suicide). Those
random friendships are special, the long days
and nights with people you've got nothing in
common with except a couple months of
close proximity. Like in "The Breakfast
Club,"it won't be the same back home, with
the old lives, friends, responsibilities, etc.
There are too many great and terrible
times to recount in full. There were nights of
high drama, like our visit to the East Berlin
heroin-den club, where promises were bro
ken, tears were shed, old animosities re
turned in time to welcome new animosities
to the table, lips met with striking and contro
versial frequency and a quiet man on a couch
handed out semi-legal substances with a
stone-faced nod. There was the "Night that
No One Remembers," when, following the
Bing Dinner, a few of us made our way to a
little bar called Travolta and stayed for the
