Daily article spreads new McCarthyism
The Apr. 7 article by Patrick Leahy on a scheduled talk
by Prof. Biju Mathew, partly organized by Friends of
South Asia (FOSA), has already been cogently criticized
in letters published on Apr. 10 and 11. Stanford senior
Neepa Acharya, graduate student Tania Ahmad, recent
graduate Owen Li and others spread out from Berkeley
to Illinois, have powerfully articulated the journalistic ir
responsibility, the racism and the weirdly archaic Mc-
Carthyite flavor of this unfortunate article.
But 1 would like to add my voice as someone who has
taught at Stanford for 10 years and as the only person in
the university whose job description is specifically to
teach about South Asia.
Smearing an individual or group, making wild insinu
ations under cover of anonymity and having the usually
excellent campus newspaper propagate the smear kindly
and obediently without so much as a little fact check —
this is utterly unacceptable.
'ITiat quaint sentence at the beginning:"The talk... has
spurred debate over the appropriateness of inviting a
leftist speaker with ties to Communism to an academic
campus."
Really! What would you say about the appropriate
ness of inviting a right-wing speaker to an academic cam
pus? What would you say about inviting someone with
ties to Neoconservatism? That might be a matter of con
cern to quite a few of us, though 1 hope that we would ex
press our concern openly, revealing to the world who we
are.
The anonymous source's faithfully reported accusa
tion that Prof. Mathew and FOSA have (in the same
breath) "Islamist and communist sympathies" is stun
ningly ignorant in one way, but makes perfect sense in an
other — if you happen to know anything about the 1950s
in this country. Something has been happening here re
cently that smacks of McCarthyism. It thrives on secret
accusers, needs a demonic enemy, promotes perpetual
war, curtails free speech, shrinks civil liberties and tries to
make spying on our own citizens look normal.
This article, wittingly or unwittingly, buys into that
kind of mentality.
I recommend that the Daily make viewing of the re
cent film Good Night and Good Luck an entry-ritual for

all aspiring reporters. It's very relevant to the problems
that have arisen in this article, and it can help inoculate
journalists, as well as the rest of us, against contributing,
even inadvertently, to the spread of a new McCarthyism.
It's also positively inspiring and a great movie.

Students should vote Yes on Mariachi
It disappoints us to see that the Daily's editorial board
did not recommend a Yes vote for Mariachi Special Fees.
Ninety-five percent of the requested money goes to fund
the class MUSIC 157: Introduction to Mariachi Ensem
ble. In yesterday?s Election Guide, the board stated,"We
believe that if the Music Department accepts this class as
part of the major, then it should support it financially." In
fact, the class is not part of the major; it is the only ensem
ble course that does not count for an ensemble unit, being
listed instead as an activity.
We pride ourselves in campaigning for a class that is
free and open to everyone, something that few, if any,
other ensemble classes offer. For many students, MUSIC
157 is their only exposure to music at Stanford, especial
ly with the competitive auditions and fees that the other
courses require. Additionally, the class is critical to the ex
istence of the group Mariachi Cardenal. Because Stan
ford students with prior mariachi experience are rare, the
class is the only place where we can recruit people for the
group. No class, no mariachi.
We only ask for the smallest amount of money that
would keep the group going, which is not much when
compared to other Special Fee requests.
Mariachi Cardenal is not only a musical group, but a
cultural group as well. We add to the diversity that Stan
ford boasts, welcoming the freshman class every year at
Faces of the Community and collaborating with such
groups as Stanford Gospel Choir and Kuumba Dance
and Drum Ensemble. We hope that when students vote
today and tomorrow, they take these contributions into
account, which have gone to benefit the entire student
body.
