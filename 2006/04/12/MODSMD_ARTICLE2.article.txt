# SPECIAL EVENT
## Talk confronts global warming Former EPA administrator stresses environmental action 
### ANNY LIN STAFF WRITER 
Thirty six cubic miles of Antarctic ice are melt
ing into the oceans each year, 27 tropical storms
formed over the Atlantic last year and 5,802 tons
of carbon dioxide are released by the United
States annually. The United States is responsible
for 20 percent of all global carbon dioxide emis
sions, while only accounting for five percent of
the world's population.
Such were some of the startling statistics pre
sented by Carol Browner, former administrator
for the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), as she delivered a lecture about the extent
of global warming yesterday evening. The event
took place at the Graduate School of Business.
Browner was appointed as the head of the
EPA in 1993 by President Bill Clinton. She held
this cabinet-level position for eight years, the
longest of any EPA administrator.
The event was supported by the Conradin von
Gugelberg Memorial Fund for the Environment,
established by the MBA Class of 1987 to honor a
deceased classmate. The fund aims to promote an
environmental ethic among the Graduate School
of Business community, according to Adam
Stern, MBA Class of 1987 and a co-chair of the
fund. Each year, the fund brings a notable envi
ronmental leader to campus.
The Stanford Woods Institute for the Environ
ment, which sponsored Vice President A 1 Gore's
lecture on global warming last year, also hosted

last night's event.
"Along with director of [Federal Emergency
Management Agency], EPA administrator is one
of the toughest jobs in Washington," Stern said.
"In her position, Browner emerged as an even
handed and forceful leader. She didn't let the sci
ence get manipulated by people with agendas."
Browner began her talk by refuting critics
skeptical of the existence of global warming and
resistant toward attempts to reduce carbon diox
ide emissions. She cited that of the 928 peer-re
viewed scientific articles published between 1993
and 2(X)3 on climate change, none challenged the
statement that human activities are warming the
earth.
"While we have been debating this issue, CO2
emissions at the country's largest power plants
have increased," Browner said. "This is not a par
tisan issue; there are many in [President George
W. Bush's] own political party that believe that
the time for change has come."
She went on to explain that while many states,
communities and businesses have taken their
own steps to address global warming. Congress
must also take action.
"Voluntary efforts by businesses will not be
enough," Browner said. "Even with the most
committed leadership from the business commu
nity, we will fail to tackle this problem. While
many businesses want to do something, there are
many who will refuse to do anything unless re
quired."
Browner emphasized that the issue of global
warming cannot be put off for much longer.
"If we leave this problem unsolved, we will be-

come the first generation that has
left to another generation a problem
that cannot be solved," Browner
said. "No generation has ever left a
permanently altered environment."
While the event attracted a num
ber of non-Stanford community
members interested in global warm
ing and environmental policy, sever
al students also attended.
"I like how she inserted her own

personal experiences," said Amy
Park, a law student. "Hearing her
talk has helped me to refine my
thoughts on environmental policy.
Seeing her perspective has helped to
solidify my views."
Browner also expressed opti
mism that humans would eventually
combat climate change.
"Everybody talks about the
weather but nobody does anything
about it," Browner said."l do believe
we can control how our actions con

lieve that we will rise to the chal
lenge. Failure is simply not an op
