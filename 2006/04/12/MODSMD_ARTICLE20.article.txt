### REBECCA HARLOW 
"[Bonds] is absurdly self- m
absorbed and as cynical M
as they come." S

With the Stanford game
rained out. baseball fans got
a special treat at the Book
store last night, where Mark Fainaru-
Wada and Lance Williams spoke and
autographed copies of their new
book "Game of Shadows: Barry
Bonds, BALCO, and the Steroids
Scandal that Rocked Professional
Sports."
The book, which documents the
discovery of steroid use of prominent
baseball players such as Barry Bonds
and the Giambi brothers, has created
international buzz and reached #13
on the Amazon bestsellers list only a
week after publication. The authors,
San Francisco Chronicle reporters,
converted a series of newspaper arti
cles into a story of corruption and
cheating.
The authors have appeared on the
Letterman and Today shows, and
made the trek to Stanford after
Williams' daughter, a Stanford grad,
encouraged her father to appear at
the Bookstore.
Sitting before a standing-room
only crowd, the authors told stories of
anonymous tips, drug cocktails and a
colorful cast of characters that almost
seemed too fantastical to be true.
"Victor Conte can only be de
scribed as a mad scientist-dope deal
er," Williams said of the founder of
the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Opera
tive. the manufacturer of nutritional
supplements based in Burlingame,
Calif., which is at the center of the
scandal.
"I think Victor Conte was the most
fascinating character involved,"
Fainaru-Wada said. "He always want
ed you to know just what he could do.
My relationship with Victor was fasci
nating, maddening, exhilarating, and
anxiety-riddled. He knew how to pull
everybody's strings — at least he
could pull my strings. He was convict

ed and served four months in prison
and when he got out, my anxiety went
through the roof."
Conte notwithstanding, the most
recognizable face in the scandal is ob
viously Bonds, the Giants slugger
who may be just a season away from
breaking Hank Aaron's career home
run record. His personal trainer Greg
Anderson admitted to giving Bonds
designer steroids from BALCO,
which helped him put on huge muscle
mass and power his way into the
record books.
"Barry Bonds is outrageously
larger than life," Williams said. "He is
absurdly self-absorbed and as cynical
as they come. It's a rare event for
Barry Bonds to do something for
someone else. It's just not how he's
wired."
Displeased by the allegations and
his portrayal in the book. Bonds sued
for a restraining order to prevent the
authors and publishers from making
profits from the book, going to court
on the publication date. The motion
was dismissed and the Hearst Corpo
ration, the parent company of Chron
icle Books, has counter-sued on the
grounds that the frivolous lawsuit had
the effect of violating its First
Amendment rights.
Barry originally said he was just
not going to read the book." Williams
said. "And then he sued us. I guess he
got madder. I am a cautious person. 1
had never been sued and I planned
never to be sued. And this suit is not
even defamation, but consumer fraud
— honestly, I'm a little insulted."
Though the BALCO scandal is the
book's focus, it is but one example of
heavy steroid use in the major
leagues. In his book last year. Jose
Canseco asserted that 80% of players
were on the juice. The authors believe
that this is an exaggeration, but guess
that the number is somewhere

around 20 or 30 percent.
"In 2003, Major League Baseball
implemented a drug-test policy which
was anonymous and. if a large num
ber of people came up positive, would
then become more strict," Fainaru-
Wada explained. "It is really an IQ
test, not a steroid test. The guys knew
what was coming and if you managed
to fail the test, there was something
wrong. Even so, five to seven percent
of players failed — that's more than
two full teams. And if that many guys
are failing this test, there must be a lot
more who are doping."
Indeed, steroid use is a wide
spread problem in professional and
even amateur sports. The BALCO
scandal centered mostly on baseball,
but football players and athletes in
track and field have also been impli
cated.The authors explained that the
ability of the drug companies to cre
ate undetectable steroids, such as
those Bonds used, allows them to dis
tribute the drugs almost with impuni
ty-
"The thing that BALCO has
shown us is that the cheaters are a
step ahead of the testers," Williams
said. "I think it's going to be that way
— at least that's my soap-boxing
opinion — until the scientific ad
vance that puts the testers ahead of
the cheaters. It's just a cat-and-mouse
game. You see, especially with the
Olympians, the ones who want to
cheat are incredibly creative. They
are very motivated."
In addition to the unfair, and ille
gal, advantage steroids give athletes,
the drugs can do serious damage to a
person's health. For several drugs, the
dangers are still unknown.
"Some of the BALCO drugs were
not designed for humans, so there
have been no tests on their effects,"

Williams explained. "They were
made to be given to cows in the feed
lot. These steroids can cause joint
problems, heart problems, tumors —
they are just not good for your
health."
"The health risk comes from the
fact that these guys are cocktailing an
array of substances which have not
been tested or approved and were
not all designed for human consump-

tion," Fainaru-Wada added. "And
they are doing it at doses beyond
medically-prescribed levels. Some of
these drugs do have medical value,
but at far lower doses."
Although BALCO has been ex
posed and Major League Baseball
has hired former Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell to investi
gate steroids, the problem has moved
well beyond the diamonds of the
MLB.
"We know it is a serious problem
in the professional sports like base
ball, football, and track and field,"
Williams said, "We know that college
players and high school players are

increasingly using it. The evidence is
mostly anecdotal, but it makes per
fect sense. Young athletes model
their behavior on these elite athletes
that they want to become. And if
Major League Baseball decides to
tolerate steroid use, kids know that.
And they do it because they think it
will make them a star."
The Mitchell investigative panel
hopes to uncover other abusers and
makers, like Bonds and BALCO are
alleged to be, but Fainaru-Wada and
Williams question the next step.
"Your home run king is a drug
cheat," Williams said. "So what do
you do now?"

ber of people came up positive, would
then become more strict," Fainaru-
Wada explained. "It is really an IQ
test, not a steroid test. The guys knew
what was coming and if you managed
to fail the test, there was something
wrong. Even so, five to seven percent
of players failed — that's more than
two full teams. And if that many guys
are failing this test, there must be a lot
more who are doping."
Indeed, steroid use is a wide
spread problem in professional and
even amateur sports. The BALCO
scandal centered mostly on baseball,
but football players and athletes in
track and field have also been impli
cated.The authors explained that the
ability of the drug companies to cre
ate undetectable steroids, such as
those Bonds used, allows them to dis
tribute the drugs almost with impuni
ty-
"The thing that BALCO has
shown us is that the cheaters are a
step ahead of the testers," Williams
said. "I think it's going to be that way
— at least that's my soap-boxing
opinion — until the scientific ad
vance that puts the testers ahead of
the cheaters. It's just a cat-and-mouse
game. You see, especially with the
Olympians, the ones who want to
cheat are incredibly creative. They
are very motivated."
In addition to the unfair, and ille
gal, advantage steroids give athletes,
the drugs can do serious damage to a
person's health. For several drugs, the
dangers are still unknown.
"Some of the BALCO drugs were
not designed for humans, so there
have been no tests on their effects,"

Williams explained. "They were
made to be given to cows in the feed
lot. These steroids can cause joint
problems, heart problems, tumors —
they are just not good for your
health."
"The health risk comes from the
fact that these guys are cocktailing an
array of substances which have not
been tested or approved and were
not all designed for human consump-

tion," Fainaru-Wada added. "And
they are doing it at doses beyond
medically-prescribed levels. Some of
these drugs do have medical value,
but at far lower doses."
Although BALCO has been ex
posed and Major League Baseball
has hired former Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell to investi
gate steroids, the problem has moved
well beyond the diamonds of the
MLB.
"We know it is a serious problem
in the professional sports like base
ball, football, and track and field,"
Williams said, "We know that college
players and high school players are

increasingly using it. The evidence is
mostly anecdotal, but it makes per
fect sense. Young athletes model
their behavior on these elite athletes
that they want to become. And if
Major League Baseball decides to
tolerate steroid use, kids know that.
And they do it because they think it
will make them a star."
The Mitchell investigative panel
hopes to uncover other abusers and
makers, like Bonds and BALCO are
alleged to be, but Fainaru-Wada and
Williams question the next step.
"Your home run king is a drug
cheat," Williams said. "So what do
you do now?"
"[Bonds] is absurdly self- m
absorbed and as cynical M
as they come." S

With the Stanford game
rained out. baseball fans got
a special treat at the Book
store last night, where Mark Fainaru-
Wada and Lance Williams spoke and
autographed copies of their new
book "Game of Shadows: Barry
Bonds, BALCO, and the Steroids
Scandal that Rocked Professional
Sports."
The book, which documents the
discovery of steroid use of prominent
baseball players such as Barry Bonds
and the Giambi brothers, has created
international buzz and reached #13
on the Amazon bestsellers list only a
week after publication. The authors,
San Francisco Chronicle reporters,
converted a series of newspaper arti
cles into a story of corruption and
cheating.
The authors have appeared on the
Letterman and Today shows, and
made the trek to Stanford after
Williams' daughter, a Stanford grad,
encouraged her father to appear at
the Bookstore.
Sitting before a standing-room
only crowd, the authors told stories of
anonymous tips, drug cocktails and a
colorful cast of characters that almost
seemed too fantastical to be true.
"Victor Conte can only be de
scribed as a mad scientist-dope deal
er," Williams said of the founder of
the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Opera
tive. the manufacturer of nutritional
supplements based in Burlingame,
Calif., which is at the center of the
scandal.
"I think Victor Conte was the most
fascinating character involved,"
Fainaru-Wada said. "He always want
ed you to know just what he could do.
My relationship with Victor was fasci
nating, maddening, exhilarating, and
anxiety-riddled. He knew how to pull
everybody's strings — at least he
could pull my strings. He was convict

ed and served four months in prison
and when he got out, my anxiety went
through the roof."
Conte notwithstanding, the most
recognizable face in the scandal is ob
viously Bonds, the Giants slugger
who may be just a season away from
breaking Hank Aaron's career home
run record. His personal trainer Greg
Anderson admitted to giving Bonds
designer steroids from BALCO,
which helped him put on huge muscle
mass and power his way into the
record books.
"Barry Bonds is outrageously
larger than life," Williams said. "He is
absurdly self-absorbed and as cynical
as they come. It's a rare event for
Barry Bonds to do something for
someone else. It's just not how he's
wired."
Displeased by the allegations and
his portrayal in the book. Bonds sued
for a restraining order to prevent the
authors and publishers from making
profits from the book, going to court
on the publication date. The motion
was dismissed and the Hearst Corpo
ration, the parent company of Chron
icle Books, has counter-sued on the
grounds that the frivolous lawsuit had
the effect of violating its First
Amendment rights.
Barry originally said he was just
not going to read the book." Williams
said. "And then he sued us. I guess he
got madder. I am a cautious person. 1
had never been sued and I planned
never to be sued. And this suit is not
even defamation, but consumer fraud
— honestly, I'm a little insulted."
Though the BALCO scandal is the
book's focus, it is but one example of
heavy steroid use in the major
leagues. In his book last year. Jose
Canseco asserted that 80% of players
were on the juice. The authors believe
that this is an exaggeration, but guess
that the number is somewhere

around 20 or 30 percent.
"In 2003, Major League Baseball
implemented a drug-test policy which
was anonymous and. if a large num
ber of people came up positive, would
then become more strict," Fainaru-
Wada explained. "It is really an IQ
