## Talk it over with Tara 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Daily sat down with women \ basketball coach
Tara VanDerveer to discuss this past season, the Elite
Eight loss to LSU and the outlook for next season.
The Stanford Daily: You've said before that this
was going to be a transitional year. 1 low did you see
this team develop over the season?
Tara VanDerveer: Wow, what a transitional year,
huh? (Chuckling) I'm really excited about how far
our team came from our first practice and our first
games to where we're one call away from the Final
Four — not even one basket, because we made the
basket. I'm proud of our team for how hard they
worked and the sacrifices they were willing to
make for each other. So I think that bodes really
well for our future.
TSI): You mentioned the call [at the end of the loss
to LSU], I fow much more frustrating was it to have
that happen at such a crucial point?
TV: You have to take it in stride because there's
nothing you can do about it. I think first of all we
had a fabulous game against Oklahoma. I thought
we were really red-hot. But in the LSU game, we
didn't give ourselves a big enough cushion and we

had breakdowns defensively on Erica White scor
ing some open lay-ups and Thomas. We tried to
avoid that situation and not put ourselves in a place
where we had to make a play and count on an offi
cial to make a call, but I just felt that we had to help
ourselves a little bit more along the way.
TSI): Hie team has been to three straight Elite
Eights, but hasn't cracked back into the Final Four
since 1997. Does getting to the next level ever be
come a mental obstacle?
TV: No, not really. 1 think that just being there is a
great accomplishment. 1 honestly didn't expect that
this year's team would do that. I think that it is just
going to give us a great springboard for next year,
so that next year's team expects this and can set
their sights higher.
We've had one-seed teams lose a lot sooner and
teams where you think "wow, how'd we get to the
I inal Four with them?" Sometimes it just happens.
But I think the experience of playing in some of
those tournament games is great for someone like
Jill or Roz. For them to gain confidence.that can re
ally be translated into higher expectations for next
year.
TSI): How have you seen Candice Wiggins and
Brooke Smith develop over the season, and where
can they go from here?
TV: Well I think that Brooke really grew up. She's
always been very talented. But I think that to go to
the next level — and for Brooke to be the kind of
center that's talked about as a first round draft-pick
it's about being physical and being a battler. I
think that's what she gave us in the Oklahoma and
LSU games;she just got mentally tough. Now I feel
like we have the whole package with her and I want
to even expand it. 1 Icr spring goal is working on her
threes. She's an excellent three-point shooter but
you'd never know it because she's never even shot
one.
As far as Candice. 1 think she did whatever our
team needed her to do. If we needed her to play the
one. she played out of position to help our team.
She has a plantar fascia problem so she's probably
going to have the orthotripsy surgery that Kristin
Newlin had. Candice is probably the player that
most needs to just rest. Then when her feet are bet
ter, to get in the gym and work on being more crafty
with the ball.
TSI): The incoming recruiting class as a whole is
very highly regarded, and you're returning almost
your entire starting five, so are the expectations
that much higher?
TV: Ibey will add a whole new dimension to the
team. First, Jayne Appel gives you a big post rota
tion with Kristin and Brooke. For instance, in the
NCAA games you had to have a big player out
against Fowles or Courtney Paris, and now you can
bring in a new one with five more fouls and a real
ly go-to block presence. I see her getting in the post
rotation immediately.


ALVIN CHOW/The Stanford Daily
Women's basketball head coach Tara VanDerveer
led the Cardinal to a third straight Elite Eight in
2006. This year, she picked up her 500 th win at
Stanford and was Pac-10 Coach of the Year.
I think JJ Hones is your classic
point guard. She's already e-mailed
me wanting me to send her the plays
so she can learn them ahead of time.
She's running track this spring, and
she's never run track before, but it's
so she can be ready. Do you see what
I mean? This girl is serious.
A lot of it is that we're going to have
more talent then we did last year, but
we need to stay healthy. We'll have
more weapons, and we're going to
need to make sure everyone works
well together and brings the fresh
men in a positive way.
TSD: You had some personal mile
stone victories during the season.
Now that you're in the off-season,
does it mean any more?
TV: I'm more of an in-the-moment
person. Sometimes it's hard, like to
lose the LSU game that way and
you're on the charter back and it's
over. But, I just really appreciate
every day being on the court with the
kids that we have. I'm thinking of the
fact that it was sad with Krista leav
ing. And then I'm thinking that I'm
going to be really sad when Brooke
and Kristin Newlin leave, so I've got
to keep hollering at them while I
have the chance. I don't want to
waste a day when I'm their coach. 1
want to do what's best for them.
That's how I think. I don't look back
at this number or that number.
What's more exciting to me is watch
ing Krista at the three-point contest
doing her thing and then cheering for
the next kid. I get my pleasure from
the little things, not from being the
focus of attention with wins or mile
stones.
