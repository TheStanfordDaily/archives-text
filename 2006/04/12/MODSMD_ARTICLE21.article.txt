## Talk it over with Tara 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Daily sat down with women \ basketball coach
Tara VanDerveer to discuss this past season, the Elite
Eight loss to LSU and the outlook for next season.
The Stanford Daily: You've said before that this
was going to be a transitional year. 1 low did you see
this team develop over the season?
Tara VanDerveer: Wow, what a transitional year,
huh? (Chuckling) I'm really excited about how far
our team came from our first practice and our first
games to where we're one call away from the Final
Four — not even one basket, because we made the
basket. I'm proud of our team for how hard they
worked and the sacrifices they were willing to
make for each other. So I think that bodes really
well for our future.
TSI): You mentioned the call [at the end of the loss
to LSU], I fow much more frustrating was it to have
that happen at such a crucial point?
TV: You have to take it in stride because there's
nothing you can do about it. I think first of all we
had a fabulous game against Oklahoma. I thought
we were really red-hot. But in the LSU game, we
didn't give ourselves a big enough cushion and we

had breakdowns defensively on Erica White scor
ing some open lay-ups and Thomas. We tried to
avoid that situation and not put ourselves in a place
where we had to make a play and count on an offi
cial to make a call, but I just felt that we had to help
ourselves a little bit more along the way.
TSI): Hie team has been to three straight Elite
Eights, but hasn't cracked back into the Final Four
since 1997. Does getting to the next level ever be
come a mental obstacle?
TV: No, not really. 1 think that just being there is a
great accomplishment. 1 honestly didn't expect that
this year's team would do that. I think that it is just
going to give us a great springboard for next year,
so that next year's team expects this and can set
their sights higher.
We've had one-seed teams lose a lot sooner and
teams where you think "wow, how'd we get to the
I inal Four with them?" Sometimes it just happens.
But I think the experience of playing in some of
those tournament games is great for someone like
Jill or Roz. For them to gain confidence.that can re
ally be translated into higher expectations for next
year.
TSI): How have you seen Candice Wiggins and
Brooke Smith develop over the season, and where
can they go from here?
TV: Well I think that Brooke really grew up. She's
always been very talented. But I think that to go to
the next level — and for Brooke to be the kind of
center that's talked about as a first round draft-pick
it's about being physical and being a battler. I
think that's what she gave us in the Oklahoma and
LSU games;she just got mentally tough. Now I feel
like we have the whole package with her and I want
to even expand it. 1 Icr spring goal is working on her
threes. She's an excellent three-point shooter but
you'd never know it because she's never even shot
one.
As far as Candice. 1 think she did whatever our
team needed her to do. If we needed her to play the
one. she played out of position to help our team.
She has a plantar fascia problem so she's probably
going to have the orthotripsy surgery that Kristin
Newlin had. Candice is probably the player that
most needs to just rest. Then when her feet are bet
ter, to get in the gym and work on being more crafty
with the ball.
TSI): The incoming recruiting class as a whole is
very highly regarded, and you're returning almost
your entire starting five, so are the expectations
that much higher?
TV: Ibey will add a whole new dimension to the
team. First, Jayne Appel gives you a big post rota
tion with Kristin and Brooke. For instance, in the
NCAA games you had to have a big player out
against Fowles or Courtney Paris, and now you can
bring in a new one with five more fouls and a real
ly go-to block presence. I see her getting in the post
rotation immediately.
