## Team misses cut, but two off to NCAAs 
### JUSTINA KAMIEL GRAYMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Saturday evening. No. 8 Stanford
made a tremendous team effort at the
NCAA West Regionals in Maples Pavil
ion. But with a third-place finish
(195.275), the team fell shy of qualifying
for the NCAA National Championships.
Alabama captured the West Regional
title, and Oregon State claimed second, as
both teams earned spots at Nationals. Al
though the Cardinal will not compete as a
team for the national title, sophomore
Tabitha Yim and senior Natalie Foley will
represent Stanford in Corvallis, Ore., in
two weeks.
The atmosphere in Maples for the
West Regional meet was far more electric
than at any of the Cardinal's dual meets
this season. With six teams competing and
the gymnasium abuzz with a loud crowd,
contagious excitement, and a champi
onship energy, the stage was set for a in
tense battle of skills and concentration.
"This was the toughest regional in the
country," said Alabama head coach Sarah
Patterson.
The early rotations were fantastic for
the Stanford women, but the end proved
to be a challenge for the Cardinal, who
scored less than 49 points on the beam
and floor exercise.

bang. And on the uneven bars, the Cardi

contributed to a stellar team perform

the crowd with her best bars performance
of the year (9.9), and Yim won the bars
title with a 9.95.
The crowd then watched in suspense
as sophomore LizTricase performed skill
