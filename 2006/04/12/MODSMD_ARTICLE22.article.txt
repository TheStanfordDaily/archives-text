## Team misses cut, but two off to NCAAs 
### JUSTINA KAMIEL GRAYMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Saturday evening. No. 8 Stanford
made a tremendous team effort at the
NCAA West Regionals in Maples Pavil
ion. But with a third-place finish
(195.275), the team fell shy of qualifying
for the NCAA National Championships.
Alabama captured the West Regional
title, and Oregon State claimed second, as
both teams earned spots at Nationals. Al
though the Cardinal will not compete as a
team for the national title, sophomore
Tabitha Yim and senior Natalie Foley will
represent Stanford in Corvallis, Ore., in
two weeks.
The atmosphere in Maples for the
West Regional meet was far more electric
than at any of the Cardinal's dual meets
this season. With six teams competing and
the gymnasium abuzz with a loud crowd,
contagious excitement, and a champi
onship energy, the stage was set for a in
tense battle of skills and concentration.
"This was the toughest regional in the
country," said Alabama head coach Sarah
Patterson.
The early rotations were fantastic for
the Stanford women, but the end proved
to be a challenge for the Cardinal, who
scored less than 49 points on the beam
and floor exercise.

Sophomore Tabitha Yim won the bars,
beam and all-around titles at the NCAA
West Regionals. Yim and teammate Na
talie Foley will represent Stanford at the
NCAA Championships in two weeks.
On vault, Stanford started off with a
bang. And on the uneven bars, the Cardi
nal's power, precision, and consistency all
contributed to a stellar team perform
ance. Freshman Nicole Ourada wowed
the crowd with her best bars performance
of the year (9.9), and Yim won the bars
title with a 9.95.
The crowd then watched in suspense
as sophomore LizTricase performed skill
after skill on bars. But the hearts of
the fans sank and gasps filled the air
when Tricase's arm slipped after a
high-to-low-bar transition. Even so,
Tricase ended the year with only one
loss in bars competition while earning
three perfect 10.0s in a single season.
On beam, the team fought for
control and consistency. Freshman
Kelly Fee and Yim exemplified this
dedication to perfection, and Yim
again took home the crown for the
event, scoring 9.9. Fee finished sixth
at 9.85.
With the meet winding down,
Stanford stepped onto the floor —
their final event of the competition.
Cheering teammates never failed in
their enthusiastic support, but minor
errors such as out-of-bounds deduc
tions added up to keep the Cardinal's
performance from being truly excep
tional. Still, there were several note
worthy individual performances in
the event — Tricase executed a dou
ble layout that sent the crowd into a
roar, and Yim showed a strikingly
stern focus in her performance.
Yim showed a remarkable consis
tency across the board. In addition to
her wins in bars and beam, she won
the all-around competition and
placed third in floor exercise. Foley
finished third in the all-around and
will join Yim at Nationals.
Several other gymnasts at the
competition turned in outstanding
performances. Oregon State's Tasha
Smith and Alabama's Ashley Miles
wowed the crowd with energy
packed hip-hop routines in the nor
mally mundane floor routine.
Smith chalked up her tremendous

energy and unique hip-hop style to a
weakness in gymnastics and a talent
in something else.
"I've been doing [hip-hop dance]
for four years now, hut I'm not very
graceful," Smith said.
Alabama's Terin Humphrey also
made a memorable appearance at
these Regionals. Her beam perform
ance and trademark "Humphrey
mount" were captivating — graceful
and fluid enough to earn her a share
of the beam title with Yim.
Despite a disappointing finish in
Regionals, three Stanford seniors will
end their collegiate careers as Pacific
-10 Conference champions and with a
successful season behind them.
"This hurts a lot.because this team
worked so hard all year," said head
coach Kristen Smyth in a statement.
"This is an amazing group of kids, and
I hurt for them. But we'll be back next
year stronger than ever."
This year twelve teams will com
pete at the NCAA Women's Nation
al Championships on April 20. The
top five teams going to Corvallis are
Georgia, Arizona State, Alabama,
Florida and Oklahoma. Yim enters
the all-around competition with the
highest qualifying score (39.5250),
with UCLA's Kate Richardson and
Arizona's Karin Wurm following
close behind. Stanford's Foley is seed
ed seventh in the all-around.
"I think Stanford has one of the
best teams in the country." Patterson
said. "At this point in the season our
sport becomes a lot like basketball.
On any given night you have to be
prepared to compete."
Yim spoke warmly of her team's
commitment and support as she pre
pares for Nationals.
"All the girls volunteered to come
in next week," said Yim. "I love the
team. It's just so unfortunate that we
couldn't go as a team."

two weeks.
The atmosphere in Maples for the
West Regional meet was far more electric
than at any of the Cardinal's dual meets
this season. With six teams competing and
the gymnasium abuzz with a loud crowd,
contagious excitement, and a champi
onship energy, the stage was set for a in
tense battle of skills and concentration.
"This was the toughest regional in the
country," said Alabama head coach Sarah
Patterson.
The early rotations were fantastic for
the Stanford women, but the end proved
to be a challenge for the Cardinal, who
scored less than 49 points on the beam
and floor exercise.

Sophomore Tabitha Yim won the bars,
beam and all-around titles at the NCAA
West Regionals. Yim and teammate Na
talie Foley will represent Stanford at the
NCAA Championships in two weeks.
On vault, Stanford started off with a
bang. And on the uneven bars, the Cardi
nal's power, precision, and consistency all
contributed to a stellar team perform
ance. Freshman Nicole Ourada wowed
the crowd with her best bars performance
of the year (9.9), and Yim won the bars
title with a 9.95.
The crowd then watched in suspense
as sophomore LizTricase performed skill
after skill on bars. But the hearts of
the fans sank and gasps filled the air
when Tricase's arm slipped after a
high-to-low-bar transition. Even so,
Tricase ended the year with only one
loss in bars competition while earning
three perfect 10.0s in a single season.
On beam, the team fought for
control and consistency. Freshman
Kelly Fee and Yim exemplified this
dedication to perfection, and Yim
again took home the crown for the
event, scoring 9.9. Fee finished sixth
at 9.85.
With the meet winding down,
Stanford stepped onto the floor —
their final event of the competition.
Cheering teammates never failed in
their enthusiastic support, but minor
errors such as out-of-bounds deduc
tions added up to keep the Cardinal's
performance from being truly excep
tional. Still, there were several note
worthy individual performances in
the event — Tricase executed a dou
ble layout that sent the crowd into a
roar, and Yim showed a strikingly
stern focus in her performance.
Yim showed a remarkable consis
tency across the board. In addition to
her wins in bars and beam, she won
the all-around competition and
placed third in floor exercise. Foley
finished third in the all-around and
will join Yim at Nationals.
Several other gymnasts at the
competition turned in outstanding
performances. Oregon State's Tasha
Smith and Alabama's Ashley Miles
wowed the crowd with energy
packed hip-hop routines in the nor
mally mundane floor routine.
Smith chalked up her tremendous

energy and unique hip-hop style to a
weakness in gymnastics and a talent
in something else.
"I've been doing [hip-hop dance]
for four years now, hut I'm not very
graceful," Smith said.
Alabama's Terin Humphrey also
made a memorable appearance at
these Regionals. Her beam perform
ance and trademark "Humphrey
mount" were captivating — graceful
and fluid enough to earn her a share
of the beam title with Yim.
Despite a disappointing finish in
Regionals, three Stanford seniors will
end their collegiate careers as Pacific
-10 Conference champions and with a
successful season behind them.
"This hurts a lot.because this team
worked so hard all year," said head
coach Kristen Smyth in a statement.
"This is an amazing group of kids, and
I hurt for them. But we'll be back next
year stronger than ever."
This year twelve teams will com
pete at the NCAA Women's Nation
al Championships on April 20. The
top five teams going to Corvallis are
Georgia, Arizona State, Alabama,
Florida and Oklahoma. Yim enters
the all-around competition with the
highest qualifying score (39.5250),
with UCLA's Kate Richardson and
Arizona's Karin Wurm following
close behind. Stanford's Foley is seed
ed seventh in the all-around.
"I think Stanford has one of the
best teams in the country." Patterson
said. "At this point in the season our
sport becomes a lot like basketball.
On any given night you have to be
prepared to compete."
Yim spoke warmly of her team's
commitment and support as she pre
pares for Nationals.
"All the girls volunteered to come
in next week," said Yim. "I love the
team. It's just so unfortunate that we
couldn't go as a team."
