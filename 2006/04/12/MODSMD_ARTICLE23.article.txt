# WOMEN'S GOLF
## Card third at home tourney 
### BY CARSON COOPER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In their annual spring tournament,
Stanford women's golf usually expects
gorgeous weather and a course in mint
condition. This past weekend though,
they instead waged battle on a soggy
home course more fit for the Pacific
Northwest.
The No. 20 Cardinal women took
third overall in the Peg Barnard Colle
giate, Stanford's lone home match of the
spring and its last regular-season tourna
ment. After shooting a 302 on Saturday,
the team bounced back well with a 290
on Sunday for a final score of 592.
"Sunday's round was much closer to
what we all expected from the team,"
Coach Caroline O'Connor said. "Our
goal for Sunday was to get out of the gate

a bit faster and improve from there; and
that's pretty much what happened."
The field had to battle an uncharac
teristically sloppy course, marked by a
high rough and extremely soft greens.
"The rough was as high as US Open
rough, so if you hit an errant shot you just
had to get the ball back into play," O'-
Connor said.
Taking the team title for the weekend
was No. 5 USC.TheTYojans finished with
a two-day total of 588, and edged No 16
California by two strokes.
The individual medal went to USC
senior Irene Cho. The soon-to-be three
time Ail-American shot a 67 on Sunday,
making her the only competitor under
par for the day. Cho finished the tourna
ment with a 5-under 137, six strokes
ahead of second-place finisher Jessica Potter of USF
The Cardinal's Jenna Seki turned in an impressive
performance, tying for fifth with a 4-over 146. Competing
as an individual, Seki took advantage of the tourna
ment's location.

"I think it's particularly special to play at home, where
family and friends can come out and support the team,"
said Seki.a junior. "We were able to play with a lot of con
fidence on our home turf and take advantage of our
knowledge of the course."
"Jenna has been playing well in practice lately â€” her
swing has been much more sound and repeatableO'-
Connor said. "She has always had an excellent short
game, so, coupled with her ball striking, her ability to
score has improved dramatically."
Freshman Mari Chun also played well, tying for sev
enth with a 147. Chun capped off a strong regular season
in which she proved one of the Card's most reliable per
formers.
Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana finished tied for 10th
with a 148. Senior Kelly Husted turned in a 149 to tie for
13th, while teammate Lauren Todd tied for 22nd with a
151.
Freshman Ki-Shui Liao carded a 152, good for 26th.
Junior Saana Rapakko, competing as in individual,
finished in 35th place. Also competing as an individual,
senior Stephanie Lue took 59th place.
The Card now turns its attention to the Pac-10 Cham
pionships, April 24-26 in TUcson. Ariz. The desert course
at Oro Valley Country Club could prove quite a chal
lenge for the Cardinal, who have no choice but to prepare
on their own rain-drenched course.
"It is going to be challenging to practice specifically
with Oro Valley in mind, particularly considering it is a
desert course and the weather here at home has been so
bad. O'Connor said. "Our golf course and practice facili
ties are water-logged right now and we're just trying to
find some time to get out to practice."
However, the Cardinal looks forward to the chal
lenge, in which they will face national heavyweights such
as No 2 UCLA and No. 3 Arizona State.
"I think the vibe on our team is especially positive
right now, and we're excited about the post-season," Seki
said.
