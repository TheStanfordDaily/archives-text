# WOMEN'S GOLF
## Card third at home tourney 
### BY CARSON COOPER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In their annual spring tournament,
Stanford women's golf usually expects
gorgeous weather and a course in mint
condition. This past weekend though,
they instead waged battle on a soggy
home course more fit for the Pacific
Northwest.
The No. 20 Cardinal women took
third overall in the Peg Barnard Colle
giate, Stanford's lone home match of the
spring and its last regular-season tourna
ment. After shooting a 302 on Saturday,
the team bounced back well with a 290
on Sunday for a final score of 592.
"Sunday's round was much closer to
what we all expected from the team,"
Coach Caroline O'Connor said. "Our
goal for Sunday was to get out of the gate

a bit faster and improve from there; and
that's pretty much what happened."
The field had to battle an uncharac
teristically sloppy course, marked by a
high rough and extremely soft greens.
"The rough was as high as US Open
rough, so if you hit an errant shot you just
had to get the ball back into play," O'-
Connor said.
Taking the team title for the weekend
was No. 5 USC.TheTYojans finished with
a two-day total of 588, and edged No 16
California by two strokes.
The individual medal went to USC
senior Irene Cho. The soon-to-be three
time Ail-American shot a 67 on Sunday,
making her the only competitor under
par for the day. Cho finished the tourna
ment with a 5-under 137, six strokes
