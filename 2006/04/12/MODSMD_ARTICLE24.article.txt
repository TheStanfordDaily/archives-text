# Competitive imbalance breaks hearts
## 
### 
We are now a little over a
week into the 2006 Major
League Baseball season,
and I couldn't be happier that base
ball is back. With the exception of the
final weeks of the season and the
playoffs, the first week or two is un
doubtedly the most exciting part of
the baseball calendar.
Why? Because it seems like any
thing can happen.
Deep down, you know that's not
true. In fact, in baseball, very little can
happen. It's not hard to eliminate half
the league from playoff contention
before the season even begins.
Yet. when the Yankees start the
season 2-4 and the Tigers open at 5-2,
it just feels good. It feels like maybe
this year will be different. Maybe the
Reds could actually make the play
offs, or the Brewers could contend for
the title.
Of course, that is why the season is
162 games long — one week of base
ball is no indication of how good any
one actually is. In all reality, the Tigers
will probably finish toward the bot
tom of the AL Central, and the Yan
kees will finish at the top of the AL
East — but for at least a week, we get
to imagine otherwise.
People complain about baseball.
The games are too long, the DH
needs to go, interleague play is a gim
mick, steroids are ruining the game,
the Dodgers suck (which they do),
and whatever else people could pos
sibly moan about.
But the bottom line is that there is
really only one major problem that
hurts the game so much that fans ac
tually tune out — inequity among
teams. The Pirates won't make the
playoffs. The Devil Rays will be the
doormats in the East. Baseball is the
only sport in which for nearly half the
teams, there is no point in even play
ing the games.
So who wants to watch a Col
orado-Kansas City game in the mid
dle of July when both teams are al
ready 20 games back in the division
