## Stanford close to traffic threshold University administrators hope more employees, students give carpooling a whirl 
### ANDREW BURMON STAFF WRITER 
The figures are beginning to come in and they do not
look good: the number of single-occupancy commuter ve
hicles on Stanford's campus during peak rush hours is ap
proaching the upper limit allowed by the Santa Clara
County General Use Permit.
In 2001, when the General Use Permit was finalized, the
University agreed to freeze the increase in the number of
trips taken each day by Stanford employees.
The General Use Permit defined this restriction as "no
increase in automobile trips during peak commute times in
the peak commute direction, as counted at a defined cor
don location around the central campus."
The peak hours the permit alludes to is actually only

The number of Stanford commuters is approaching the upper limit allowed by the Santa Clara County General Use
Permit. Stanford employees and students account for one percent of the county's traffic.
one hour, between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. As
of 1999, Stanford employees and stu
dents represented one percent of total
Santa Clara County traffic and three
percent of the traffic within a 10
square-mile radius of the University.
At that time, the University was al
ready making a significant effort to
discourage its employees from driving
to work alone; 20 percent of Stanford
employees hiked to campus.
Now, Provost John Etchemendy is
working with Parking and Transporta
tion Services to encourage more em
ployees and students to change their
method of transportation.
Etchemendy recently sent out a re
quest for department managers to
lower the number of people commut
ing between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. by 10 to
15 percent.
Stanford's Parking and Transporta

tion Services, which has won awards
for being the "Best Workplace for
Commuters," has a Commuter Club
for people looking to carpool and for
those who bike to work. Currently, the
club has about 4.700 members. This
spring, in addition to the up to $204
each member can receive each year
just for being a participant in the
group, the club will hold a raffle for its
new members.The grand prize will be
a trip to Las Vegas.
TTie Commuter Club is also spon
soring a mini-essay contest called.
"Commuter Hero' Love Stories.'" The
winning author will receive a $250
prize. Professors, facilities workers and
Graduate School of Business students
have already submitted essays.
Many of these essays have a casual
tone: Earth Systems graduate student
Stephanie Greene began her piece
with an anecdote."All right. I admit it.
My hottest date this Valentine's Day
was...me and a big metal train. You
may laugh, but let me give you the de
tails, and you'll see what I mean."
Kelly Rohfls, a civil engineer who

works at Stanford Facilities Opera
tions, calculated that she was spending
$1.-100 each month on her car. After
selling the car. she wrote,"The calcula
tor shows me that if I had begun in
vesting that $1,400 each month from
the time I was 25 until I retired at age
(>7.1 would have saved $2,395,888.13."
As Etchemendy considers chang
ing work schedules and contemplates
the possible penalties for the violation
of the General Use Permit — which
might include compulsory construc
tion of more road-space — University
administrators are hoping that em
ployees and students will take care of
the issue by themselves.
Etchemendy and President John
Hennessey have both stressed the en
vironmental benefits of alternative
commuting methods, but perhaps
Zena Meadowsong's "Commuter
Hero" essay serves as better encour
agement.
"l our years ago, I met my husband
at Caltrain in Mountain View." she
wrote."Such are the unexpected bene
fits of public transit!"
