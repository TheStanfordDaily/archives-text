# HEALTH CENTER WILL STOP OFFERING CARE TO STUDENTS' DEPENDENTS
## Vaden to cut insurance Citing rising costs as reason, Vaden will slash Dependent Health Insurance Plan in Sept. 2006 
### SHIRIN SHARIF SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Vaden Health Center will no longer offer health insurance
plans to dependents of Stanford students because of escalating
and unsustainable costs, the center announced yesterday. The
change will take effect on Sept. 1,2006 and affects just over 100
students. Cardinal Care, the student health insurance plan that
has over 8,000 enrollees, is unaffected by the change to the De
pendent Health Insurance Plan, which is a separate entity.
The high cost of the plan is a result of the low number of en
rollees and their frequent use of health care resources, including
a large number of spouses using maternity care. In addition, ris
ing hospital and physician costs, new and expensive technologies
and the increasing use of costly drugs are affecting this plan and
others nationwide. For the 2006-2007 academic year, premiums
would have increased more than 50 percent over the current rate.
The University considered combining the Cardinal Care and
Dependent Health Insurance plans, but such measures would
create "an unfair burden in terms of increased premiums for the
students in Cardinal Care," according to Vaden's Web site.
Civil and environmental engineering graduate student Mike
Dvorak signed up for Cardinal Care when he got to campus this
year, but he didn't even know about insurance options that ex
isted for his wife.
"I had no idea about the [Dependent Health Insurance] plan,"
Dvorak said.'T might have been interested if had I known."
Historically, most graduate students and their families re
ceived a generous University subsidy to help make insurance
affordable. However, current funding is inadequate to subsidize

the high increase in the plan's costs.
"The top priority of the Vaden Insurance Office is to help
each affected individual find and enroll in an another health in
surance plan," said Dr. Ira M. Friedman, director of Vaden, in a
press release. "The insurance office staff has researched various
options to ease the transition to alternative coverage and found
a number of lower cost, high-quality programs on the market,
including plans for the hard to insure."
Vaden officials have developed a resource guide and online
information at http://vaden.stanford.edu/resources, to explore
coverage options for students affected by the changes. The Web
site includes a list of insurers that offer plans for adults and chil
dren, questions to be considered in choosing a plan and expla
nations of common health insurance terminology.
"The University's decision to discontinue the Dependent
Health Insurance Plan is a difficult but necessary one," Fried
man said in the press release. "We understand the concerns that
this decision will raise among plan enrollees and are dedicated
to helping each of them identify and enroll in a plan that best
meets their needs."
Vaden has also identified options for those who are hard to
insure. The University is setting aside "a small pool of funds" to
provide need-based financial assistance for hard-to-insure stu
dent dependents for the 2006-2007 academic year.
Provost John Etchemendy and Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Greg Boardman approved the recommendation put for
ward by the Vaden administration to discontinue the plan.The
recommendation was made in consultation with the Health In
surance Advisory committee, which includes four student rep
resentatives.
The Vaden Insurance Office, located on the first floor of the
health center at 866 Campus Drive, can be reached by tele
phone at (650) 723-2135, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5
p.m., or by email at healthinsurance@stanford.edu.
