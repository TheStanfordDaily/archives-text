## STANFORD BAGS $1.2 MILLION FOR STEM-CELL RESEARCH 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD MANAGING EDITOR 
Still mired in a quagmire of legal challenges, California's stem-cell institute
announced Monday that it has begun to issue its first installment of state fund
ing for stem-cell research — including $1.2 million for Stanford. The grant, is
sued from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, is the first of
three annual installments to the University, which will total $3.7 million.
Created in 2004 when California voters approved Proposition 71 —
which proposed financing $3 billion over 10 years to fund stem cell re
search — the program has been unable to issue grants due to pending law
suits. That roadblock was temporarily averted last week, when the Prop. 71
finance committee released bond anticipation notes raising $14 million
from private philanthropists.The sale was approved by State Treasurer Phil
Angelides and Controller Steve Westly, both candidates for this year's gu
bernatorial election.
Stanford will use the grant to support 16 research scholars, mostly grad
uate students, postdoctoral fellows and medical research fellows, according
to the Palo Alto Weekly.
Proponents of stem-cell research hold that it may lead to a multitude
of treatments and cures for chronic illnesses. The Bush administration,
however, placed restrictions on the use of federal funds for embryonic
stem-cell research, concerned over the destruction of human embryos.
Stanford received one of 16 grants in the Institute's initial round of
funding, totaling $12.1 million. The grants, which range from $374,730
awarded to UC-Santa Cruz to UCLA's $1.23 million, will finance train
ing for nearly 170 students statewide.
