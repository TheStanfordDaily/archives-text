# STUDENT GROUPS
## Students face AIDS, take action Week of events planned to raise money for people with HIV/AIDS 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
Three Stanford students who took a year off
school to raise $1 million for HIV treatment in
Africa are seeing their plans blossom this
week, as their organization, FACE AIDS, is
kicking off its fundraising activities with a se
ries of events. FACE AIDS chapters are also
becoming active on 15 other California college
campuses.
The inaugural event at Stanford was a talk
on Monday by Rutendo Kashambwa, a junior
at UC-Berkeley, who spoke about her experi
ences growing up in Zimbabwe, a country
where nearly 25 percent of the population is in
fected with HIV. Kashambwa, who also
worked on various AIDS initiatives in her
home country, focused on the circumstances of
women who find themselves powerless in the
face of the epidemic.
In her half-hour talk, Kashambwa de
scribed how high unemployment and rampant
poverty force young women to rely on big dha
ras, or "sugar daddies," who often extort sexual
favors from the girls in return for food and
money needed to support the their siblings and
parents. She depicted a culture where a woman
cannot make her husband use a condom —
even if she knows he is sleeping with other
women — for fear of being branded as un
faithful herself. Everyone she knows has a fam
ily member who has died of AIDS, but many
women still refuse to speak of the disease.
The organization on Tuesday organized a
panel discussion of Stanford students involved
in fighting AIDS. Today, FACE AIDS is host
ing a dinner at the Bechtel International Cen
ter, where UC-San Francisco Prof. Diana
Havlir will speak. Havlir has been involved in
AIDS research since the early 1980s.Thursday
evening will feature performances at Bechtel
by Talisman and the Spoken Word Collective,
as well as an exhibition of photos focusing on
the AIDS epidemic in Africa.
Ihe events aim to raise money
by selling bead pins made by peo
ple receiving AIDS treatment in
Zambian refugee camps.The pins
cost $5, and various corporate
sponsors donate an additional
$15 in matching funds for each
pin sold. Of that, $1 goes to the
pin makers. This arrangement
was coordinated by FACE AIDS
co-founder Katie Bollbach, a jun
ior who is currently working in
Zambia. The rest of the money
goes to an organization called
Partners in Health and its treat
ment programs in Rwanda. The
objective is to raise $1 million in
one year.
According to co-founder of
FACE AIDS Lauren Young, a
junior, the money raised from

selling one pin, "can provide life
saving treatment for one person
for a month."
Jonny Dorsey, a junior and
another co-founder of FACE
AIDS, described the organiza
tion's progress at other schools.
"The biggest change has been
on the campus outreach side of
things," he said. "We really have
a network of schools now that
are starting to launch cam
paigns."
Dorsey went on to say that be
cause of the publicity surround
ing the campaign, including arti
cles in the San Francisco Chroni
cle and San Jose Mercury News,
"students are starting to come to
us."
Junior Justin Chung, who
heads the FACE AIDS chapter at
UC-Santa Cruz, said he became
involved by fate.
"I happened to hear a few
facts [about] the tragic epidemic
in Africa, so I wanted to start my
own campaign at my school to in

crease awareness," he said. "Lit
tle did I know that Stanford had
already created one. So I tagged
along with Stanford's FACE
AIDS and created a branch at my
school."
Sarah Scott, a junior at Santa
Clara who heads up another
chapter of FACE AIDS, was di
rected to the organization by a
faculty contact at her school.
"I learned about FACE AIDS
through Leslie Gray, a political
science professor here on cam
pus." she said. "She told me about
the project, directed me to the
Web site and I contacted Lau
ren."
Both Scott and Chung, as well
as members at chapters from the
Claremont colleges, UC-Irvine
and other colleges and universi
ties, are planning on holding their
first events in the coming weeks.
In addition to selling pins, they
are working to collect more
sponsors to match student contri
