## Students face AIDS, take action Week of events planned to raise money for people with HIV/AIDS 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
Three Stanford students who took a year off
school to raise $1 million for HIV treatment in
Africa are seeing their plans blossom this
week, as their organization, FACE AIDS, is
kicking off its fundraising activities with a se
ries of events. FACE AIDS chapters are also
becoming active on 15 other California college
campuses.
The inaugural event at Stanford was a talk
on Monday by Rutendo Kashambwa, a junior
at UC-Berkeley, who spoke about her experi
ences growing up in Zimbabwe, a country
where nearly 25 percent of the population is in
fected with HIV. Kashambwa, who also
worked on various AIDS initiatives in her
home country, focused on the circumstances of
women who find themselves powerless in the
face of the epidemic.
In her half-hour talk, Kashambwa de
scribed how high unemployment and rampant
poverty force young women to rely on big dha
ras, or "sugar daddies," who often extort sexual
favors from the girls in return for food and
money needed to support the their siblings and
parents. She depicted a culture where a woman
cannot make her husband use a condom —
even if she knows he is sleeping with other
women — for fear of being branded as un
faithful herself. Everyone she knows has a fam
ily member who has died of AIDS, but many
women still refuse to speak of the disease.
The organization on Tuesday organized a
panel discussion of Stanford students involved
in fighting AIDS. Today, FACE AIDS is host
ing a dinner at the Bechtel International Cen
ter, where UC-San Francisco Prof. Diana
Havlir will speak. Havlir has been involved in
AIDS research since the early 1980s.Thursday
evening will feature performances at Bechtel
by Talisman and the Spoken Word Collective,
as well as an exhibition of photos focusing on
