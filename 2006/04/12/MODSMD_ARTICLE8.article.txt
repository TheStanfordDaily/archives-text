a senior, concerning the selection of seven
undergraduate and graduate students for
the Nominations Commission.
"This is a very talented group of students,
and I was really impressed with all their in
terviews," she said. "The Nominations Com
mission is responsible for selecting students
to serve on University committees, and
they'll be meeting with faeulty and the ad
ministration and discussing different poli

cies for the University."
Hie primary responsibilities of the Com
mission occur during spring quarter, when
the members interview and nominate stu
dents to positions on the University's many
committees.
"This is an important role, because these
students will be taking voices at large and
having them directly influence student poli

cy," Kannokada added. "Their jobs start this
quarter, and we're going to begin soliciting
applications this quarter for the various
committees so that students can start plan

ber of the campus advocacy commit
tee, concerning the extension of
Green Library's hours.
"I met fall quarter with Cheryl
McGrath [a Green Library repre
sentative], with the concern that stu
dents wanted extended library
hours on the weekends," Clark said.

"The most valid student concern
was that Green Library closes at 6
p.m. on Friday.
"I was hoping that we could ex
tend the hours as long as possible,
and although 1 didn't think it would
happen this year, 1 received an
email on Friday confirming that the
hours of Green Library will be ex
tended to 10 p.m. on Fridays start
ing [fall] quarter of next year," she
added. "It's a big win for the Senate
and for the student body since it's
been a concern since I've been

here."
The Senate then passed funding
bills for the Organization of Arab-
American Students in Stanford
(OASIS). Charcoal Club and Stan
ford Association for Computing
Machinery.
The Senate also passed budget
modification bills for Stanford Spo
