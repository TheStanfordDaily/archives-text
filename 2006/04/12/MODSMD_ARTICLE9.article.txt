## Patents pour out of the Farm 
### DAVID STEINHARDT 
Stanford moved up to a tie for fourth
place in this year's annual United States
Patent and Trademark Office rankings
for colleges and universities.The Univer
sity received 90 patents in 2005, up from
75 in 2004.
For the 12th year in a row, the 10-cam
pus University of California system led
the nation in patents with 390, down
from 424 in 2004. The Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology was second with
136 patents, up from 132 in 2004, and the
California Institute of Technology
earned third place on the list by receiving
101 patents, down from 135 in 2004.
The top 10 also included (in order) the
University of Texas (tied with Stanford),
the University of Wisconsin, Johns Hop
kins University, the University of Michi
gan, the University of Florida and Co
lumbia University.
Stanford's Office of Technology Li
censing (OTL), the department that gov
erns the filing of patents for the Univer
sity, has existed for 35 years. Katherine
Ku, director of OTL, wrote in the group's
annual report that, "[Since its founda
tion] OTL has obtained 1,500 U.S.
patents, evaluated over 6,000 inventions.

entered into 25,000 licenses and option
agreements and brought in over $1 bil
lion in licensing revenue."
The official office mantra is, "doing
what's best for the technology."
There are many notable achievements
among Stanford's patents in 2005. Some
highlights from the Farm's list of patents
are, "the use of electro-osmotic pumps
together with wicking structures for
water management in fuel cells, the fabri
cation of multilayer nanoparticles, a
technique for sorting carbon nanotubes
and a new device for mechanically fas
tening tissue," according to the OTL an
nual report.
Stanford is one of the country's lead
ing research universities, and faculty
members are constantly receiving
patents, inventing new technology and
filing copyrights for their work.
Hundreds of hours of research and ex
perimentation occur before an original
patent is requested, and the process of
filing patents is a continuous one, as Prof.
Richard Luthy, chair of the Civil and En
vironmental Engineering Department,
explained in an email to The Daily.
"The patent process takes several
years," he said. "I know several faculty
have patents pending."
