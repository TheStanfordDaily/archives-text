## Rice defends U.S.-India agreement 
### 
WASHINGTON — Capital Hill was
bustling this past week to cram in a last bit of
work before its two-week Easter recess.
While illegal immigration and Tom DeLay's
resignation stole headlines. Congress also
dealt with more subtle and complicated is
sues such as nuclear non-proliferation.
A Passage to India
In a hearing on Wednesday, Secretary of
State Condoleezza Rice asked a skepti
cal Senate Foreign Relations committee
to pass legislation that would give the Bush
administration carte-blanche to carry out a
U.S.-India civilian nuclear cooperation deal.
Specifically, Rice requested that the Sen
ate amend the Atomic Energy Act (AEA)
of 1954 to allow the United States, to export
civilian nuclear fuel and technology to
India even though India is a not a signatory
of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty —
the international treaty that de facto gov
erns the worldwide transparent use and
spread of nuclear energy and nuclear
weapons. Under the deal, the U.S. would
provide nuclear fuel and technical help, and
India would place the nuclear reactors it
considered civilian under international
oversight by the International Atomic En
ergy Administration (lAEA) — standard
fare for signatories of the NPT. The issue
cuts to the heart of our nuclear non-prolif
eration policy, but also offers hope for a
stronger U.S.-India partnership.
In her opening statement. Rice argued
that India is a rising global power with com
mon democratic values that could act as a
pillar of stability in a troubled region. She
described the nation as a natural partner for
the United States and throughout the hear
ing emphasized the benefits of bringing
India under international oversight.
Rice's enthusiasm, however, was met
with skepticism. Although everyone pres
ent agreed that cooperating with India was
absolutely essential, committee members
worried that the deal would erode the nu
clear non-proliferation regime, possibly aid
India's nuclear weapons program or even
fuel an arms race with Pakistan, a non
democratic nuclear weapons state also out
side of the NPT that could possibly turn un
stable.
Rice in the Frying Pan
Fundamentally, senators had a hard
time understanding why the deal
would be in the United States' best in
terest. Moderate Lincoln Chafee (R-RI)
asked Rice outright, "Who approached
who?" and then later, "In whose best inter
est is this?" Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.)
questioned the logic of allowing India to
choose which reactors were classified as
civilian or military. Others openly pondered
whether the deal was a move to counter
China.
Rice floundered as she struggled to ex
plain why verification specifics were to be
hammered out with India and the lAEA at
a later date. Her stammering to explain the
odd timing was contrasted with Paul Sar
banes (D-MD), who asked her in slow and
measured confidence, "Do you want us to
pass it not knowing what the safeguards
are?"
Rice also seemed to be stepping on Con
gress's toes, a fact which visibly displeased
the Committee members. Instead of imple
menting the agreement through a presiden
tial waiver requiring yearly congressional
approval. Rice requested an amendment to
the AEA law.This would leave a future Con
gress with only the power to pass a bill re
tracting the deal — but this would still be
subject to a presidential veto. Sarbanes
pointed out that the amendment effectively
strips Congress of the program's oversight.
"So the solution to your problem," Sar
banes asked, "is to move Congress out of the
decision-making process?"
Ouch!
Chafee was also a little wary to hand his
powers over so easily.
"Most of these amendments give power
to the president and take away oversight,"
he said.
Rice's arguments ultimately amount to
the statement: "TVust me."
Everyone agrees that US-India civilian
nuclear cooperation is a good thing, but sen
ators were right to be apprehensive. In its
current form, the deal undercuts the NPT
without offering much in return for the
United States or the non-proliferation
regime in general. It's good to see that at
least someone is asking the right questions.
