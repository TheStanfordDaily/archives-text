"IHj he cast of Cabaret, which opens
Friday, is scantily clad and features
I a triple threat — performers with
fantastic acting skills, excellent dance
moves — especially tap — and amazing
musical numbers.
The show opens with the number
"Willkommen", sung by the Emcee and
other members of the Kit Kat Klub. The
Emcee then proceeds to guide the audi
ence through the experiences of Cliff, an
aspiring American novelist in 1929
Berlin. He is exposed to the frivolous and
carefree attitudes of the Kit Kat Klub and
the seductive Sally Bowles. However, the
rise of Hitler and its consequences makes
itself apparent even in the relationships
among those who live in and visit Cliffs
apartment building.
Director Alex Mallorv. a sophomore,
describes Cabaret as an examination of a
Germany in crisis, unable to solve its
problems. The musical asks the audience
whether it can accept the choices of those
who turned their backs on others in
order to survive. It vividly portrays an
inability to take action caused indi
vidual needs and desires, as ex
plained by the Emcee and the Klub.
The polished final product of

the musical Cabaret is the culmination of
the efforts of numerous people, begin
ning at the end of last year.
"I applied to produce Cabaret because
it's my senior year, and I felt it would be the
best way to complete my time at Stanford,
llie Ram's Head spring show is a big proj
ect. but one that allows us to display the
best we have," says senior and producer
Jeanette Woodburn.'i thought it would be
fun, but I had no idea 1 would enjoy every
step of it so much. Watching the first dress
rehearsal, all I can think of is that four
monthsago, I was seeing some of these peo
ple for the first time. Seeing the show grow,
and seeing the results of everyone's hard
work has been immensely rewarding."
Preparations for the show began last
June. ITie staff was hired in November
and auditions were held in January to se
lect the talented cast.
Cabaret is a production of Ram's
Head Theatrical Society. Funding for the
show comes from ticket sales of previ
ous shows, advertisements in their
programs, and funding from the
Stanford Fund. The cast and staff
stayed over spring break to build
the set, which was designed by An
drew Reid. t

The cast members — especially the
leads — have been spending a lot of time
working together, and have gotten to
know each other to the point where they
can finish each others' sentences. As
such, it's no surprise that they are so en
thusiastic about their castmates' per
formances.
"'lTie dancers in Cabinet are incredi
ble — there are no weak links in this cast.
We are really lucky we get to work in this
show and we hope as many people as pos
sible get to see it."says freshman Aman
da Gelender. in her first Ram's I lead pro
duction.
Senior Andrew Willis-Woodward
agrees.
"I think this is one of the most talent
ed casts I have been a part of. The show
has come together to form this poignant
piece." he adds.
"Cabaret is one of the most famous
and well-liked musicals, [and] the
musical we are doing is very
different from the movie." says
senior Justin Liszanckie. per
forming in his eighth Stan
ford show. "Especially for
[sophomore] Nisa | Ari ]
and I. this musical

has a lot of meaty acting parts. The entire
musical is a huge collaborative process,
[and] the show deals with serious issues
that resonate with people."
"1 think the best thing about Cabaret
is that it is not a typical musical," says Ari.
"Everything is fine in the first act, and
then in the second act. everything goes to
shit — and at the end, everything goes
back together."
The cast offers many reasons Stanford
students should see Cabaret, some more
important than others.
"We have lots of girls in fishnets," says
Liszanckie.
"And that's just plain hot," adds Ari.
