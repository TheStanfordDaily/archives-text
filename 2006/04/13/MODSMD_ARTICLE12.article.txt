### FRANCOIS JEAN-BAPTISTE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last Sunday, the "Cenar para
C6sar" kicked off Cesar Chrivez
Commemoration Week, honoring
the 13th anniversary of Chdvez's
death. Keeping with the "El
Pueblo Unido" — "The United
Town" — theme, activities com
memorating Chrivez and his work
continue with events like "Today
en El Campo: Service Learning in
Watsonville," meeting on Friday
at 12 p.m. at Tresidder, and "Orga
nizing for Power: Labor Organiz
ing Training," at Tresidder from
noon to 5 p.m. on Saturday.
The first hour of the event, fea
turing a special luncheon from 12
to 1 p.m. with legendary United
Farm Workers (UFW) co-founder
Dolores Fluerta, is not to be
missed, says Monica Henestroza,
the Interim Assistant Director of
El Centro Chicano.
"There is limited seating, so
participants must sign up in ad

vance," she adds.
In addition to her work as a
UFW co-founder, Huerta has
been honored for her work as a
tireless labor leader, organizer,
and social activist. Born in 1930 in
New Mexico, she was raised pri
marily by her mother in Stockton,
California, with additional help
from her grandfather, Herculano
Chavez.
Huerta met C6sar ChiWez
while serving as secretary-treasur
er of the AFL-ClO's Agricultural
Workers Organizing Committee.
With Chrivez, she helped create
the Farm Workers Association,
which eventually became the
UFW. She played an important
role in the national feminist
movement and lobbied for leg
islative protections for farm work
ers. She also helped to change po
lice policy on handling demon
strations after she was severely in
jured by police during peaceful
demonstrations against presiden
tial candidate George H.W. Bush
in 1988. Huerta recovered and has

since continued to champion the
workers' union.
By 1970, the UFW convinced
grape growers to accept union
contracts, and had effectively or
ganized most of that industry, at
one point claiming 50.(KM) dues
paying members. Its success can
be attributed in large part to
C£sar Chavez's tireless leader
ship and nonviolent tactics, in
cluding the Delano grape strike,
fasts that focused national atten
tion on farm workers' problems
and a 340-mile march from De
lano to Sacramento in 1%6. But
while Chavez drew wide attention
in his leadership of farm workers'
struggles for better pay and safer
work conditions, he has attracted
a fair share of criticism as well.
Chavez and the UFW, worried
that the presence of illegal immi
grants might drive down wages,
often reported them to the Immi
gration and Naturalization Ser
vice to be deported. In one report
ed incident in 1973, UFW workers
attempting to stop Mexican work

ers from crossing the border phys
ically attacked them, bloodying
some. Still, Chavez's overall lega
cy remains positive — the boy
cotts. picket lines, and strikes he
led played a crucial role in organ
izing farm workers and raising na
tional awareness of their situa
tion.
Commemoration Week organ
izer Daniel Herrera explained
that planners wanted to integrate
a historical and educational pro
gram into this week's activities.
"We decided to add some type
of event that would present a his
tory of labor organizing," Herrera
says."[We also wanted to] provide
some useful training for students
who are involved in social justice
movements and organizations. We
learned that USC Prof. Marco
Palma teaches a class that does
this and it was especially promis
ing because, Delores Huerta. co
founder of the UFW union, is co
instructor for the course."
Herrera added that — with the
help of Palma and Huerta — El

Centro Chicano is bringing an
abridged version of that course
(Political Science 334 at (JSC) to
the Stanford campus. The session
on labor organizing training will
commence at 1 p.m. Saturday,
after the noontime luncheon.
