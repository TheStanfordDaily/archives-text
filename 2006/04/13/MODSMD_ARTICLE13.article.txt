## Editorial Reconsidering tenure 
### 
Professorial tenure is a difficult beast to
tame. While it places tremendous de
mands on untenured faculty, its re
wards make it one of the most attractive in
stitutions in any field. Tenured professors
enjoy unparalleled job security and freedom
for research and intellectual discovery. But
within academia and elsewhere, a debate is
raging over the merits of tenure. Here at
Stanford, we should all be aware of the facts
and myriad implications of this debate.
Since its inception in the United States in
the early 1900s, tenure has withstood
tremendous controversy, and has drawn
much criticism. At Stanford, following the
U.S. invasion of Laos in 1971. tenured Amer
ican literature scholar 11. Bruce Franklin was
fired due to his administration-unfriendly
characterization of Stanford's role in the
Vietnam War. The conflicts surrounding the
tenure appointments of History Prof. Karen
Sawislak and Anthropology Prof. Akhil
Gupta polarized the campus in the late 1990s
and forced faculty and students alike to re
consider the tenure process.
Current Stanford professors have also
come under attack for abusing their privi
leged position. History Prof. Joel Beinin has
oft been the target of The Stanford Review,
which published an October op-ed entitled
"Joel Beinin Doesn't Deserve Tenure."
Meanwhile, University of Colorado Ethnic
Studies Prof. Ward Churchill remains the
subject of a tenure controversy after he re
ferred to Sept. 11 victims as "little Eich
manns" and was accused of plagiarism and
ethnic fraud.
Certainly, tenure can be credited for al
lowing professors the freedom to speak out
about and conduct research into unpopular
and previously unexplored issues. In this
light, we do not want professors playing the
role of populist politicians — concerned
more about being re-elected instead of en
couraging discourse. At its best, academia
both advances and counterweighs the tides
of intellectual and political opinion. To that
end, tenure provides the rationale and pro
tection for the academic freedom of our
professors.
Nevertheless, it should be clear that the
opponents of tenure have a point. Although
the majority of tenured professors — even
most at an institution such as Stanford —
maintain impeccable standards of teaching
and scholarship, the lifetime license offered
by tenure implicitly contains the risk of
"deadwood" in academia — those profes
sors who care little about research and often
less about teaching. Iliough most Stanford
students have had positive experiences with
faculty, it is a fair guess to say almost every
one has had at least a couple of extremely

negative experiences as well. That is not to
say that a single (or even several) negative
reviews should suggest the withdrawal of
tenure; instead, we note that no system of
checks and balances exists in any meaningful
form. If Stanford is faced with a tenured pro
fessor who has demonstrated consistently
poor teaching or even questionable scholar
ship. the process by which tenure is revoked
is so opaque and improbable that we are es
sentially forced to grin and bear it. As stu
dents at a prestigious (and expensive) col
lege. we should demand better.
Hie answer, likely, lies in a meaningful
commitment to post-tenure review. Profes
sors at Stanford face enormous obstacles in
achieving tenure, including numerous evalu
ations of their work by students and faculty.
Their research, teaching and involvement in
university life are scrutinized: ultimately less
than 40 percent of tenure-track professors
are actually tenured, while the rest leave vol
untarily or requested to leave. Clearly, Stan
ford's commitment to choosing superior fac
ulty for tenure, while a less than transparent
process, is laudable. But after receiving
tenure, professors are essentially left to their
own devices, with their jobs secure and revo
cation of tenure a practical impossibility.
How secure are Stanford's professors? Ac
cording to the Wall Street Journal, of the
280,000 tenured faculty members at Ameri
can universities, only 50 to 75 lose their
tenure each year.
These statistics point to a poor system (or
no system at all) of post-tenure review. As
one of the world's leading universities, Stan
ford should take steps to involve both its stu
dents and independent experts in judging
the contributions to research and teaching.
Academics have complained that they do
not like to be constantly judged; similarly,
students should complain that they have a
right to inspired, inspiring professors.
Not surprisingly, there exists little mo
mentum among professors for a popular
movement to overhaul or even reconsider
the institution of tenure. Accordingly, the re
sponsibility rests on students to hold acade
mia accountable for a questionable tradi
tion. Abandoning tenure altogether would
produce, on the aggregate, a negative effect
on the academic environment at Stanford —
not least because we would have difficulty
recruiting professors who would enjoy supe
rior job security at other colleges. Further
more, tenure ensures a consistent standard
of academic freedom and helps schools
forge lasting relationships with their best
and brightest faculty.There can be no excuse
for bad professors.The University should se
riously consider implementing a plan that
keeps tenured professors accountable.

wards make it one of the most attractive in
stitutions in any field. Tenured professors
enjoy unparalleled job security and freedom
for research and intellectual discovery. But
within academia and elsewhere, a debate is
raging over the merits of tenure. Here at
Stanford, we should all be aware of the facts
and myriad implications of this debate.
Since its inception in the United States in
the early 1900s, tenure has withstood
tremendous controversy, and has drawn
much criticism. At Stanford, following the
U.S. invasion of Laos in 1971. tenured Amer
ican literature scholar 11. Bruce Franklin was
fired due to his administration-unfriendly
characterization of Stanford's role in the
Vietnam War. The conflicts surrounding the
tenure appointments of History Prof. Karen
Sawislak and Anthropology Prof. Akhil
Gupta polarized the campus in the late 1990s
and forced faculty and students alike to re
consider the tenure process.
Current Stanford professors have also
come under attack for abusing their privi
leged position. History Prof. Joel Beinin has
oft been the target of The Stanford Review,
which published an October op-ed entitled
"Joel Beinin Doesn't Deserve Tenure."
Meanwhile, University of Colorado Ethnic
Studies Prof. Ward Churchill remains the
subject of a tenure controversy after he re
ferred to Sept. 11 victims as "little Eich
manns" and was accused of plagiarism and
ethnic fraud.
Certainly, tenure can be credited for al
lowing professors the freedom to speak out
about and conduct research into unpopular
and previously unexplored issues. In this
light, we do not want professors playing the
role of populist politicians — concerned
more about being re-elected instead of en
couraging discourse. At its best, academia
both advances and counterweighs the tides
of intellectual and political opinion. To that
end, tenure provides the rationale and pro
tection for the academic freedom of our
professors.
Nevertheless, it should be clear that the
opponents of tenure have a point. Although
the majority of tenured professors — even
most at an institution such as Stanford —
maintain impeccable standards of teaching
and scholarship, the lifetime license offered
by tenure implicitly contains the risk of
"deadwood" in academia — those profes
sors who care little about research and often
less about teaching. Iliough most Stanford
students have had positive experiences with
faculty, it is a fair guess to say almost every
one has had at least a couple of extremely

negative experiences as well. That is not to
say that a single (or even several) negative
reviews should suggest the withdrawal of
tenure; instead, we note that no system of
checks and balances exists in any meaningful
form. If Stanford is faced with a tenured pro
fessor who has demonstrated consistently
poor teaching or even questionable scholar
ship. the process by which tenure is revoked
is so opaque and improbable that we are es
sentially forced to grin and bear it. As stu
dents at a prestigious (and expensive) col
lege. we should demand better.
Hie answer, likely, lies in a meaningful
commitment to post-tenure review. Profes
sors at Stanford face enormous obstacles in
achieving tenure, including numerous evalu
ations of their work by students and faculty.
Their research, teaching and involvement in
university life are scrutinized: ultimately less
than 40 percent of tenure-track professors
are actually tenured, while the rest leave vol
untarily or requested to leave. Clearly, Stan
ford's commitment to choosing superior fac
ulty for tenure, while a less than transparent
process, is laudable. But after receiving
tenure, professors are essentially left to their
own devices, with their jobs secure and revo
cation of tenure a practical impossibility.
How secure are Stanford's professors? Ac
cording to the Wall Street Journal, of the
280,000 tenured faculty members at Ameri
can universities, only 50 to 75 lose their
tenure each year.
These statistics point to a poor system (or
no system at all) of post-tenure review. As
one of the world's leading universities, Stan
ford should take steps to involve both its stu
dents and independent experts in judging
the contributions to research and teaching.
Academics have complained that they do
not like to be constantly judged; similarly,
students should complain that they have a
right to inspired, inspiring professors.
Not surprisingly, there exists little mo
mentum among professors for a popular
movement to overhaul or even reconsider
the institution of tenure. Accordingly, the re
sponsibility rests on students to hold acade
mia accountable for a questionable tradi
tion. Abandoning tenure altogether would
produce, on the aggregate, a negative effect
on the academic environment at Stanford —
not least because we would have difficulty
recruiting professors who would enjoy supe
rior job security at other colleges. Further
more, tenure ensures a consistent standard
of academic freedom and helps schools
forge lasting relationships with their best
and brightest faculty.There can be no excuse
for bad professors.The University should se
riously consider implementing a plan that
keeps tenured professors accountable.
