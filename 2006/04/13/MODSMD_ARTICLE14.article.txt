# Mind the yap

Just for today, I want you to try some
thing new while you're reading this. You
know that little voice inside your head?
Give it an accent. Australian, Southern,
Canadian...it doesn't matter which one you
choose, so long as it sounds exotic and excit
ing. (I hear that Canadians can be quite de
lightful, eh?). Got it? Okay, now you can
keep reading.
There's something intriguing about some
one who talks differently than the average
person. Their unique lilt and quirky pronun
ciations say, "I've been places. I've seen the
world. I'm interesting and I know it." It has
always been a secret (well, maybe not-so-se
cret) desire of mine to have an accent so that
I.too, would be interesting. I like to think that
someday I will live in Australia, pick up the
accent, then come home and impress my
friends with my worldliness. Of course, I also
tried to impress them by moving across the
country for college, but all that got me is their
wrath when I try to call them at midnight —
3 a.m. back East — in order to make the most
of my unlimited nighttime minutes.
Having an accent has its advantages in
the romantic arena as well. Guys, if you're
from another land (or if you're from 20 min
utes away and just talk kind of funny), you
don't even realize how easy you have it.
Every girl (well, every American girl) is se
cretly in love with you and would take you
home in a heartbeat. It's a proven fact (all of
my friends agree) that even the sleaziest
pick-up line sounds good in a crisp British
accent ("Roses are red, violets are blue. I like
spaghetti, let's go screw"). Part of the reason
could be that the girl can never quite make
out exactly what her Englishman is saying —
but it doesn't matter, lie's foreign. He's so
phisticated. He's mysterious. What more do
you need to know?
However — and I only know this second
hand, because, despite having spent most of
my life in Maine, I manage to avoid talkin'
like a regulah Main-uh for the most paht —
having a unique accent can sometimes cause
more trouble than it's worth. Take an old
friend of mine for example. A native Lon
doner, his accent was a novelty for many peo
ple in the beginning. lime and time again, he
graciously and gentlemanly granted their re
quests to repeat certain phrases that Ameri

cans just can't do justice. Amusing though it
was at first, by the end of the summer 1 secret
ly wished that he would stop reminding peo
ple to "mind the gap" and — oops — let
them accidentally trip and fall just as the Un
derground came barreling through.
I don't blame him for going back to the
United Kingdom. Maybe I'll go visit him in
London someday and have him introduce
me to all of his friends.
Somehow, though. I don't think that Amer
ican accents are quite as alluring to foreigners
as their voices are to us. Perhaps it's because
anytime anyone wants to hear an American
talk, he can just turn on the telly and get an
earful from Paris Hilton, Ashton Kutcher or
someone equally charming. Most foreigners
already don't like us, so they sure as bloody
hell don't want to listen to us any more than is
necessary. Even we Americans, pleased with
ourselves as we are, wouldn't complain if "The
Simple Life" went off the air.
I propose that Stanford create an initiative
to attract more international students in order
to improve quality of life for all. Just think of
how much more exciting the walk to class
would be if the people who biked into you
apologized (or,more likely,cursed you out) in
a foreign tongue, or what a great start to the
morning it would be if a real, live Brit filled
your teacup at Peet's. And if the 1-Hum kid
were from Australia, going to section would be
the highlight of every freshman's day.
Okay, maybe that's a bit of a stretch. But
regardless, an atmosphere of diversity and
uniqueness adds spice to any situation. And
that's what life's all aboot, eh.

Unfortunately, email doesn 't do justice to a
beautiful accent So if you want to send
Stephanie a conn tent, address it to salessi@stan
ford.edu and wrile the accent of your choice in
the subject line so she can get the full effect.
