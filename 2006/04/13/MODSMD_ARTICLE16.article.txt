Ihave been waiting for this day for six
years. Since he was sworn into office, 1
have argued that the president and his
cronies have manipulated the public. He mis
led the public into supporting a war for the
wrong reasons. He violated the Constitution
by spying on U.S. citizens. All the while, I have
contended, the Bushworld has exuded a con
descending arrogance — promising us that it
knows what we should and should not know.
Now, finally, it seems that the country might
be beginning to agree with me. Huzzah!
The results of Monday's Washington Post-
ABC poll are staggering. Only 38 percent of
the public surveyed approve of how Bush is
doing his job — the worst he has ever fared in
a Washington Post-ABC Poll. A whopping 60
percent of respondents disapprove of his per
formance as president. His approval rating has
been below 50 percent for almost a year now
and the percentage of the public that disap
proves has consistently been over 50 percent.
Only 20 percent of respondents of the poll
"strongly approve" of Bush's presidency,
while 47 percent "strongly disapprove." Hi is
marks the second straight month in which a
larger proportion of Americans "strongly
disapprove" of the President's job than his
overall job approval rating.
Bushworld has been rocked by disaster
after disaster this year — all having a hand in
decimating Bush's approval rating. Pictures
of the president with Jack Abramoff, the rise
of civil unrest in Iraq, the public's distrust of
the government's handling of the war (nearly

50 percent of Americans say they "strongly"
feel the battle wasn't worth fighting), the
NSA wire-tapping, the Harriett Miers fiasco,
Hurricane Katrina and even Cheney's shoot
ing of 1 larry Whittington have all contributed
to a public distrust of Bush that no number of
staged press conferences can remedy.
Now I. Lewis Scooter Libby has said that
the president himself authorized the declassi
fication of intelligence reports. Again, the
president misled. He promised to search out
traitors that leaked information, but he him
self authorized leaks. As Maureen Dowd
wrote in a New York Times column on April
8:"Really, W. should fire himself. He swore to
look high and low for the scurrilous leaker
and. lo and behold, he has himself in custody."
Finally the impenetrable wall around this
administration seems to be crumbling. Final
ly Bush isn't winning. Finally people are see
ing the members of the Bush administration
for the manipulators that they are!
You can imagine my elation. The 48
moons of Jupiter have finally aligned and the
day of reckoning is upon Karl Rove. With

such dismal public approval, the president
has absolutely no mandate and will be unable
to get any bill through Congress. In the words
of a fellow pinko-liberal operative on The
West Wing: "Victory is mine! I drink from the
keg of glory!"
And so you can also imagine my dismay as
immigration debates heated up over the past
couple weeks. Why, oh, why does the one
issue on which 1 agree with Bush have to
come up now?
Early in the debates, it looked like things
were going to be alright. The McCain-
Kennedy bill seemed to be gaining momen
tum. The bill, which is closer to Bush's posi
tion on immigration, toughens border con
trol but supports a guest worker program —
a program that allows Mexican workers to
legally come to the United States. Further
more, the McCain-Kennedy Bill gives illegal
aliens that are already here — all II to 12
million of them — a way to become U.S. citi
zens after paying fines, back taxes and pass
ing civics tests.
But things changed quickly. While I rev
eled in Bush's fall to the ultimate lame duck,
a debate in Congress between Republicans
ensued. Conservative Republicans wanted to
make sure nothing that could possibly be
construed as "amnesty" — including a guest
worker program — be left on the table. In
fact, they don't want any Mexicans at all.

Tom Tancredo said at the Phoenix
Restoration Weekend on Feb. 24-26:
"Yes, many who come across the
border are workers. But among them
are people coming to kill me and you
and your children."
And why should you or 1 care
about what a lunatic backbencher
from Colorado said? Because he is a
member of the House Immigration
Reform Caucus that just passed a bill
by Wisconsin Representative James
Sensenbrenner.
If the Senate ever does pass a
bill, it will be forced to reconcile it

with the Sensenbrenner Bill, which
may be impossible. Sensenbren
ner's Bill intended to keep Con
gress from any liberalization of im
migration policy. The bill makes all
illegal aliens felons. It increases
penalties against those who aid and
counsel illegal aliens. It calls for a
700 mile wall to be built along the
border. And it carefully omits any
way for those illegal aliens to be
come citizens.
Yet hundreds of thousands of ille
gal immigrants have taken to the
streets in Los Angeles, Atlanta,
Houston, Madison, Phoenix and
most recently D.C., draped in Amer
ican flags chanting "U.S.A! U S A!"
and pleading to be allowed to stay in
this country. 'ITiese demonstrators
should remind us of why our country

is different from others and why tlicy
want to so desperately immigrate
just as our ancestors did hundreds of
years ago.
These demonstrators are push
ing the debate in congress - - forc
ing tight ass, white, elitist, xenopho
bic, conservative lawmakers to con
sider that perhaps the face of the
nation is changing. Perhaps, despite
their best efforts, they can't legislate
against these "illegals" without
committing political suicide.
Luckily for me, these demonstra
tors have become highly effective
because God knows Bush — the
lamest duck of all — can't help me
now. (I In /yah?)

overall job approval rating.
Bushworld has been rocked by disaster
after disaster this year — all having a hand in
decimating Bush's approval rating. Pictures
of the president with Jack Abramoff, the rise
of civil unrest in Iraq, the public's distrust of
the government's handling of the war (nearly

50 percent of Americans say they "strongly"
feel the battle wasn't worth fighting), the
NSA wire-tapping, the Harriett Miers fiasco,
Hurricane Katrina and even Cheney's shoot
ing of 1 larry Whittington have all contributed
to a public distrust of Bush that no number of
staged press conferences can remedy.
Now I. Lewis Scooter Libby has said that
the president himself authorized the declassi
fication of intelligence reports. Again, the
president misled. He promised to search out
traitors that leaked information, but he him
self authorized leaks. As Maureen Dowd
wrote in a New York Times column on April
8:"Really, W. should fire himself. He swore to
look high and low for the scurrilous leaker
and. lo and behold, he has himself in custody."
Finally the impenetrable wall around this
administration seems to be crumbling. Final
ly Bush isn't winning. Finally people are see
ing the members of the Bush administration
for the manipulators that they are!
You can imagine my elation. The 48
moons of Jupiter have finally aligned and the
day of reckoning is upon Karl Rove. With

such dismal public approval, the president
has absolutely no mandate and will be unable
to get any bill through Congress. In the words
of a fellow pinko-liberal operative on The
West Wing: "Victory is mine! I drink from the
keg of glory!"
And so you can also imagine my dismay as
immigration debates heated up over the past
couple weeks. Why, oh, why does the one
issue on which 1 agree with Bush have to
come up now?
Early in the debates, it looked like things
were going to be alright. The McCain-
Kennedy bill seemed to be gaining momen
tum. The bill, which is closer to Bush's posi
tion on immigration, toughens border con
trol but supports a guest worker program —
a program that allows Mexican workers to
legally come to the United States. Further
more, the McCain-Kennedy Bill gives illegal
aliens that are already here — all II to 12
million of them — a way to become U.S. citi
zens after paying fines, back taxes and pass
ing civics tests.
But things changed quickly. While I rev
eled in Bush's fall to the ultimate lame duck,
a debate in Congress between Republicans
ensued. Conservative Republicans wanted to
make sure nothing that could possibly be
construed as "amnesty" — including a guest
worker program — be left on the table. In
fact, they don't want any Mexicans at all.

Tom Tancredo said at the Phoenix
Restoration Weekend on Feb. 24-26:
"Yes, many who come across the
border are workers. But among them
are people coming to kill me and you
and your children."
And why should you or 1 care
about what a lunatic backbencher
from Colorado said? Because he is a
member of the House Immigration
Reform Caucus that just passed a bill
by Wisconsin Representative James
Sensenbrenner.
If the Senate ever does pass a
bill, it will be forced to reconcile it

with the Sensenbrenner Bill, which
may be impossible. Sensenbren
ner's Bill intended to keep Con
gress from any liberalization of im
migration policy. The bill makes all
illegal aliens felons. It increases
penalties against those who aid and
counsel illegal aliens. It calls for a
700 mile wall to be built along the
border. And it carefully omits any
way for those illegal aliens to be
come citizens.
Yet hundreds of thousands of ille
gal immigrants have taken to the
streets in Los Angeles, Atlanta,
Houston, Madison, Phoenix and
most recently D.C., draped in Amer
ican flags chanting "U.S.A! U S A!"
and pleading to be allowed to stay in
this country. 'ITiese demonstrators
should remind us of why our country

is different from others and why tlicy
want to so desperately immigrate
just as our ancestors did hundreds of
years ago.
These demonstrators are push
ing the debate in congress - - forc
ing tight ass, white, elitist, xenopho
bic, conservative lawmakers to con
sider that perhaps the face of the
nation is changing. Perhaps, despite
their best efforts, they can't legislate
against these "illegals" without
committing political suicide.
Luckily for me, these demonstra
tors have become highly effective
because God knows Bush — the
lamest duck of all — can't help me
now. (I In /yah?)

Ihave been waiting for this day for six
years. Since he was sworn into office, 1
have argued that the president and his
cronies have manipulated the public. He mis
led the public into supporting a war for the
wrong reasons. He violated the Constitution
by spying on U.S. citizens. All the while, I have
contended, the Bushworld has exuded a con
descending arrogance — promising us that it
knows what we should and should not know.
Now, finally, it seems that the country might
be beginning to agree with me. Huzzah!
The results of Monday's Washington Post-
ABC poll are staggering. Only 38 percent of
the public surveyed approve of how Bush is
doing his job — the worst he has ever fared in
a Washington Post-ABC Poll. A whopping 60
percent of respondents disapprove of his per
formance as president. His approval rating has
been below 50 percent for almost a year now
and the percentage of the public that disap
proves has consistently been over 50 percent.
Only 20 percent of respondents of the poll
"strongly approve" of Bush's presidency,
while 47 percent "strongly disapprove." Hi is
marks the second straight month in which a
larger proportion of Americans "strongly
disapprove" of the President's job than his
overall job approval rating.
