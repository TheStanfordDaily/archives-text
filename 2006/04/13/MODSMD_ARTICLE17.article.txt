# A 						Modern Fairytale
## Welcome to humpweek

rH guage" — a phrase often heard
A here, in a country with 11 official
languages. Sadly, I speak only one of them,
and even that can be a challenging medium
of communication. Even more so at this
exact moment.
Welcome to Humpweek, the midway
point between arriving here and going back
home: a week's worth of Wednesdays. The
Wednesday of Humpweek is actually the
precise middle of the semester and has been
scientifically proven to be the point at which
all those formerly charming idiosyncrasies
about people and places suddenly just make
you feel alienated. I'm not homesick exactly,
all I want is a little understanding.
I lere, traffic lights are "robots," nurses are
"sisters," corn is "mealies," car horns are "hoot
ers" and squash is "pumpkin" (except when the
vegetable in question is actually a pumpkin).
"Okay" is cheerfully pronounced as though
there were a dozen or more a s in it. People are
always ending sentences with "ne?" (roughly
meaning, "right?"). Conversations are also
ended or punctuated with "sharp sharp" (pro
nounced "shop shop") or just "sharp" ("shop")
which means everything from "it's all good" to
"sure, that sounds like a great idea" to "hurry

up" to "ok, bye." And somewhere along the line
I got the impression that referring to the Unit
ed States as anything other than "America" is
considered putting on airs.
Then there's "language" in a different
sense. I laving been rejected (or, in Stanford
lingo, "not accepted") from winter quarter's
Overseas Studies Program in Cape Town, I
opted to enroll in a similar, albeit non-Stan
ford, study abroad program, where 1 am now.
Which means if conversation with my cur
rent classmates hits a lull, I can't debate the
comparative merits of Row House chefs or
commiserate about missing Cafe Night.
With this particular group, it also happens
to mean that I am alone in my appreciation of
classic rock. Virtually no one recognized
"Bohemian Rhapsody" on the radio. While
I'm not the type that utters the words "my
music" with a kind of reverence, it still makes
me cry a little on the inside when few people
around me can name a Billy Joel song. (Sorry,
"Piano Man" doesn't count.)
The music cultural barrier works against
all of us, though;one South African girl asked
us incredulously, "You don't know Westlife?
Oh my God, where have you been?"
And, with no other New Yorkers around,
I stand on line all by myself.

Sure, this is all superficial, but when your
foreignness is worn on your skin and in
grained in your speech, it's hard not to be
sensitive to differences. Because beyond all
this there are the differences that arc much
harder to overlook. In New Brighton alone
our host families estimate there are between
20 and 50 funerals each weekend. This week
my street had six deaths — one every third
house or so. I asked my host mother what's
killing everyone off. AIDS she said, along
with a few of the usual suspects such as can
cer and heart disease. It shouldn't have been
a surprise, but it's always different when the
private tragedies of the AIDS epidemic are
unfolding only a few feet from your doorstep.
There's also the matter of unemployment.
Poverty abounds and many South Africans
struggle with the depressed job market. One
member of my host family has been trying
unsuccessfully for two years to get work. She
cried when she got a call this week that she
had landed a job — at Kentucky Fried
Chicken (KFC).
I bitch and moan about my own jobless
ness, but it's more of an act than anything; I
know I could find something if I needed to.
Here, there is often literally nothing
to fall back on — even college grad
uates have a hard time finding work.
I'm learning to be more careful
about the jokes 1 make and what 1
take for granted. While watching
commercials for a fast food restau
rant advertising burgers for 17 rand
(a little less than three dollars), my

host brother muttered that no one
would buy them because they were
too expensive. Meanwhile, it costs a
few rand more per person to get
from New Brighton into town, a rea
son my host family doesn't often go
far from home.
All this combined made Hump
week live up to its funk-promoting
reputation. liven the weather knew
it was Hunipweek — it seemed like
summer in the southern hemisphere
was quickly sliding into fall. At
least, it felt that way until the week
end, when the sun unexpectedly re

turned and the whole of l\>ri I Eliza
beth went to the beach. Families of
all races building sandcastles. older
couples strolling and little kids
training in lifeguarding skills all
helped compose a scene worthy of a
commercial. It stole a page from
Fraggle Rock's book and (tem
porarily) chased my llunipweek
cares away.

Ili'iia George would rather lough with
the sinners than cry with the saints.
