## Card bid farewell to five seniors and longtime coach Shaw, squad near finale 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
In Burnham Pavilion this weekend,
members of the men's volleyball team said
their goodbyes. While one more week of
regular season play remains, the home sea
son is over. Before the final matches, Stan
ford recognized the accomplishments and
contributions of six men who have been in
tegral to the program — retiring head
coach Don Shaw and the squad's five grad
uating seniors.
Before taking on UCLA on Friday, the
team honored Shaw, who is leaving the
Farm after 23 years—l 6 with the
women's volleyball team and seven with
the men. He led the women to the NCAA
title four times before switching to the
men's team in 2001.
Saturday was Senior Night in Burnham,
with the squad honoring its five seniors, all
regular starters this season. Chris Ahlfeldt,
Will Clayton, Jeremy Jacobs, Nick Manov
and Ben Reddy played their last home
game this weekend.
"Those five have been very solid, com
ing in every day and working hard," Shaw
said. "They have never had any problems
on or off the court. 1 genuinely like all
these guys. They all had good moments in
the program, and I know they will be suc
cessful in whatever they end up doing."
Although the Cardinal dropped both
matches this weekend and fell to 4-22 over
all and 2-18 in the MPSF, they provided an
exciting show for the home crowds. Against
No. 7 UCLA (18-12,10-10) and top-ranked
UC-Irvine (25-3, 18-2), Stanford started
strong, before faltering and being swept in
both matches.
The Cardinal stayed close with the
Bruins in the first game Friday, tying the
score at 12, but UCLA was too strong and
Stanford made too many errors down the
stretch.The Bruins took the lead and did
not relinquish it, winning the game 30-25.
"I was not very happy with how we
played," Shaw said. "If we had come out
and played well, we would have had a
chance to be competitive. I don't think any
body was happy with that performance. We
just made too many mistakes."
In game two, Stanford again challenged
and again came up short. After closing their
deficit to three at 20-17, the Cardinal could
muster only three more points, and eventu
ally fell 30-20.
Reddy notched seven of his team-high
12 kills in the third game, but the Bruins
rolled to victory, claiming the sweep with a
30-20 finish.
The Bruins never hit below .300 in a
game, while the Cardinal could barely

Those five hove been very
solid, coming in every day
and working hard... They all
had good moments in the
program, and I know they
will be successful in whatev
er they end up doing.

break the .100 barrier, hitting .103 in the
third game.
Reddy's 12 kills led the Cardinal, but he
hit only .048 with 10 errors. Sophomore
outside Jesse Meredith had seven kills and
sophomore middle Matt Ceran chipped in
six. Ceran led the Cardinal in blocks (one
solo and one assist) and digs (seven).
After Saturday's ceremony honoring
the accomplishments of the seniors, the
quintet came out firing on all cylinders.
Against the nation's top-ranked team,
Reddy recorded a match-high 18 kills on
.343 hitting. Ahlfeldt tallied six kills with
only a single error and a team-high four
blocks. Junior libero Brian Lindberg had
seven digs against Irvine.
As a team, however, the Cardinal con
tinued to struggle, with a match hitting per
centage of .101. After out-hitting the
Anteaters in a painfully close first game,
Stanford hit -.083 and.(XX) for the rest of
the match.
The Cardinal took the first point of the
match and neither team could put together
a run.The score was tied as late as 24-24, but
two kills,an ace and a Stanford error quick
ly gave Irvine a four-point advantage. The
Cardinal held off four game points, but the
Anteaters took the 30-28 win on a Stanford
service error.
"We came out with enthusiasm and pas
sion, and the guys were really fired up,"
Shaw said. "We had a couple of plays not go
our way at the end of the first game and we
lost that one, but I was feeling good about
our play."
Irvine carried its momentum into the
second game, scoring the first six points.


ALVIN CHOW/The Stanford Daily
Six-foot-four senior setter Jeremy Jacobs, seen here against CSU-Northridge early last month, played in
54 games his freshman year and 62 his junior year before becoming a regular starter this year.
Stanford did not score more than two
points in a row at any point in the
game, falling 30-18.
In game three, the Irvine front line
more than doubled the Cardinal's of
fensive output. After an early tie, the
Anteaters went on a 10-2 run to put
the game out of Stanford's reach.
Consecutive Stanford errors handed
Irvine the 30-19 win.
"When we came out to start game

two, we were just not executing well,"
Shaw said. "It wasn't that we were
passing poorly, but we had some
breakdowns. There is a reason Irvine
is number one — they played very
solid and did not make many mis
takes."
The Cardinal will play two more
games this season, heading south to
face UC-San Diego (1-26,0-20) and
No. 5 Long Beach State (19-9,12-8).
Stanford swept the Tritons in January
behind 14 kills by Reddy and five
blocks by Ahlfeldt. San Diego's sole
victory this season came against
Princeton in early February.
"Despite their record, UC-San

Diego is a very competitive team,"
Shaw said."l think they are looking at
it as a game that is winnable for them,
playing the team in conference right
next to them in the standings [and] on
their home court. But if we play well
enough, 1 hope we can come away
with a win."
Long Beach beat the Cardinal in
four games in their last meeting.
"It will be our last game, my last
game, the seniors' last game and we
just want to be able to go out feeling
good about how we did," Shaw said.
"And for the younger guys, we want
them to feel good as they start prepar
ing for next year."
