fourth with 146 points.
while the women's

team placed eighth with 210. Southern Cali
fornia won the meet with 99 points, followed
by Hawaii with 109 and UC-Irvine with 114.
Stanford co-hosted the regatta with the
St. Francis Yacht Club in San Francisco. For
tunately, the weather was much milder than
it had been during the week. Saturday was
sunny with winds at 10-15 mph,and though
it rained slightly on Sunday afternoon, winds
were low at only 5-10 mph.
In the A division, sopho
more skipper Eddie
Conrad and sen-

ior Anna Vu placed fifth with 70 points.
Ilie women's team, meanwhile, featured
junior Caroline Young, who skippered the
first five races with juniors Becca Levin and
Joanna Madsen. Liz Roundtree raced the
last five with sophomore Sara Schocknecht
as crew. Together, the women accumulated
132 points and earned 11th place.
Stanford met even more success in the B
division, taking both fifth and sixth place. Ju-

nior Emery Wager and freshman
Taylor Grimes accrued 7(i
points, just two points ahead
of sophomores Evan
Brown and Carrie
Denning, who
were racing
for

the women's team.
"This regatta reminded us of our compe
tition â€” we raced people we've seen before
and will see again in the coming weeks," said
sophomore Kimberly Korinek, who raced
on Stanford's J V team.
Next weekend, the Cardinal are sched
uled to compete in three regattas in three
different states. Some
sailors will head to Ore

women will go to Provi
