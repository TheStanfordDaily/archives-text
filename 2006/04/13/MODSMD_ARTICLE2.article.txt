# Stanford professors conduct ground-breaking research
## Understanding quakes 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
The 1906 San Francisco Earthquake marked
the birth of modern earthquake science. As the
tragedy's TUesday centennial approaches, Stan
ford engineers and seismologists continue to gen
erate groundbreaking, field-leading research.
"Someday another big one will appear again,"
said Geophysics Prof. Greg Beroza. "It is critical
to understand how earthquakes work."
Stanford professors are doing "overlapping,
complementary work," said Civil and Environ
mental Engineering Prof. Helmut Krawinkler.
Geophysics experts study earthquakes as phe
nomena, why and how they happen. Then engi
neers use the information to figure out how to
most effectively design buildings.

The greatest debate in th
field of geophysics today
concerns whether earth- J
quakes could theoretically [j
be predictable. Observa-V
tional seismologists at Stan-'
ford have been broaching
this $64,000 question in a va
ety of ways.

Geophysics Prof. Mark Zoback has been lead
ing the National Science Foundation s San An
dreas Fault Observatory at Depth project
(SAFOD) in conjunction with the U.S. Geological
Survey Scientists drilled three kilometers into the
ground at a site in central California. An observa
tory directly within the fault zone is being con
structed to monitor smaller, more frequent earth
quakes. In 2007, his team will retrieve a cylindrical

core sample to help laboratory testing.
"It's going to be really exciting to have moni
toring instruments in the hypocenter zone,"
Zoback said. "Everything is going extremely well.
We've gotten across the fault on time and on
budget. We are learning a lot."
Thirty-eight papers were presented at the
American Geophysical Union Conference in De
cember analyzing results of research from the
SAFOD project.
"We don't know whether earthquakes are in
herently predictable," he said. Even if they aren't
predictable, he explains that scientists still want to
understand earthquakes as best they can.

understand how tectonic plates in
teract.
Using the global positioning sys
tem. Geophysics Prof. Paul Segall has
been monitoring the changing forma
tion of the earth's crust.
Prof. Howard Zebker uses anoth
er satellite-based measurement sys
tem called Interferometric Synthetic
Aperture Radar (InSAR) to detect
minute changes on the surface of the
earth . The associate professor of elec
trical engineering and geophysics
hopes that noticing even subtle
movements in the earth will help pro
vide a deeper understanding of how
earthquakes work.
Beroza and Segall have reexam
ined the century-old 1906 earth
quake data to compare seismic and
geodetic methods of measurement.
They hypothesize that the earth
quake might have happened at a
much higher velocity than once
thought. This 'supershear' speed
model means the earthquake would
have been of a higher intensity with a
shorter duration.
"We have almost no data about
the 1906 earthquake," Beroza said.
"We don't know how quickly that
motion happened. Iliere's a critical
need to understand just how strong
the shaking is so we can deign struc
tures to withstand the shaking."
University scientists such as Profs.
Greg Deierlein and Eduardo Miran
da have pioneered performance
based earthquake engineering.
Buildings can never be made totally
safe from collapse in a major earth
quake. The method helps designers
evaluate structural engineering proj
ects using risk management.
"Everything in life is about cost
benefit analysis," Krawinkler said.
"In a strong earthquake, there will be
damage. We work to translate engi
neering terms into dollars and life
safety. There's only so much money to
protect property. How do we best
spend the money we have?"
Engineers are developing
stronger construction materials that
have proven more durable. For in
stance, researchers have synthesized

and tested materials like carbon fiber
as alternatives to concrete.
Stanford is also developing dis
posable fuses to help buildings with
stand intensive shaking. Professors
are experimenting with rubber bear
ings to create base isolation â€” a sep
aration of buildings from the ground.
The bearings help dissipate the ener
gy and can be replaced after the
earthquake.
Progress has been made to im
prove search-and-rescue efforts in
the aftermath of a major quake. Pro
fessors have built wireless sensor de
vices that remotely transmit informa
tion about buildings' conditions.
After a quake, disaster response
teams will know where the worst
damage has occurred.
"We have to minimize the damage
of collapse right after the earth
quake," Krawinkler said.'if the dam
age is large in Palo Alto for example,
search-and-rescue teams will go
there and not where the damage is
smaller."
At the John A. Blume Earthquake
Engineering Center, there is an effort
to simulate the shaking of earth
quakes. Scientists there have been re
searching the properties and effects
of soil liquefaction. When the water
table is high and the geography is
sandy, earthquakes can take away all
the strength and stability of soil.
Buildings can sink into the soil.
In honor of the anniversary, ap
proximately 2,50() earthquake engi
neers and seismologists are expected
to descend upon San Francisco for a
five-day conference. Many Stanford
professors are scheduled to present
research.
Earlier this week, the National
Geographic Society premiered a film
about the 1906 earthquake, highlight
ing the research Zoback has been
doing on the San Andreas Fault.
Professors say there are still many
ways to think about earthquakes that
are relatively unexplored.
"Every new earthquake holds
some new surprises," said Beroza.
"To some extent, the future of what
will be working on is as unpredictable
as earthquakes themselves."

Beroza and Segall have reexam

quake data to compare seismic and
geodetic methods of measurement.
They hypothesize that the earth
quake might have happened at a
much higher velocity than once
thought. This 'supershear' speed
model means the earthquake would
have been of a higher intensity with a
shorter duration.
"We have almost no data about
the 1906 earthquake," Beroza said.
"We don't know how quickly that
motion happened. Iliere's a critical
need to understand just how strong
the shaking is so we can deign struc
tures to withstand the shaking."

some new surprises," said Beroza.

The 1906 San Francisco Earthquake marked
the birth of modern earthquake science. As the
tragedy's TUesday centennial approaches, Stan
ford engineers and seismologists continue to gen
erate groundbreaking, field-leading research.
"Someday another big one will appear again,"
said Geophysics Prof. Greg Beroza. "It is critical
to understand how earthquakes work."
Stanford professors are doing "overlapping,
complementary work," said Civil and Environ
mental Engineering Prof. Helmut Krawinkler.
Geophysics experts study earthquakes as phe
nomena, why and how they happen. Then engi
neers use the information to figure out how to
most effectively design buildings.

The greatest debate in th
field of geophysics today
concerns whether earth- J
quakes could theoretically [j
be predictable. Observa-V
tional seismologists at Stan-'
ford have been broaching
this $64,000 question in a va
ety of ways.

Geophysics Prof. Mark Zoback has been lead
ing the National Science Foundation s San An
dreas Fault Observatory at Depth project
(SAFOD) in conjunction with the U.S. Geological
Survey Scientists drilled three kilometers into the
ground at a site in central California. An observa
tory directly within the fault zone is being con
structed to monitor smaller, more frequent earth
quakes. In 2007, his team will retrieve a cylindrical

core sample to help laboratory testing.
"It's going to be really exciting to have moni
toring instruments in the hypocenter zone,"
Zoback said. "Everything is going extremely well.
We've gotten across the fault on time and on
budget. We are learning a lot."
Thirty-eight papers were presented at the
American Geophysical Union Conference in De
cember analyzing results of research from the
SAFOD project.
"We don't know whether earthquakes are in
herently predictable," he said. Even if they aren't
predictable, he explains that scientists still want to
understand earthquakes as best they can.
Those in the field say that studying the effects
of large earthquakes, infrequent yet extremely
