# Stanford professors conduct ground-breaking research
## Understanding quakes 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
The 1906 San Francisco Earthquake marked
the birth of modern earthquake science. As the
tragedy's TUesday centennial approaches, Stan
ford engineers and seismologists continue to gen
erate groundbreaking, field-leading research.
"Someday another big one will appear again,"
said Geophysics Prof. Greg Beroza. "It is critical
to understand how earthquakes work."
Stanford professors are doing "overlapping,
complementary work," said Civil and Environ
mental Engineering Prof. Helmut Krawinkler.
Geophysics experts study earthquakes as phe
nomena, why and how they happen. Then engi
neers use the information to figure out how to
most effectively design buildings.

The greatest debate in th
field of geophysics today
concerns whether earth- J
quakes could theoretically [j
be predictable. Observa-V
tional seismologists at Stan-'
ford have been broaching
this $64,000 question in a va
ety of ways.

Geophysics Prof. Mark Zoback has been lead
ing the National Science Foundation s San An
dreas Fault Observatory at Depth project
(SAFOD) in conjunction with the U.S. Geological
Survey Scientists drilled three kilometers into the
ground at a site in central California. An observa
tory directly within the fault zone is being con
structed to monitor smaller, more frequent earth
quakes. In 2007, his team will retrieve a cylindrical

core sample to help laboratory testing.
"It's going to be really exciting to have moni
toring instruments in the hypocenter zone,"
Zoback said. "Everything is going extremely well.
We've gotten across the fault on time and on
budget. We are learning a lot."
Thirty-eight papers were presented at the
American Geophysical Union Conference in De
cember analyzing results of research from the
SAFOD project.
"We don't know whether earthquakes are in
herently predictable," he said. Even if they aren't
predictable, he explains that scientists still want to
understand earthquakes as best they can.
Those in the field say that studying the effects
of large earthquakes, infrequent yet extremely
