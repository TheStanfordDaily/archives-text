# A 						baseball story that matters
## 
### 
So, how did you know the 2006
baseball season was really un
derway?
Was it Pedro Martinez staking
his claim to the plate against Jose
Guillen of the Nationals (among
others), and inciting one of those
"baseball fights" where no punches
ever seem to be thrown?
Or maybe it was Nomar Garcia
parra's annual return to the dis
abled list.
Then again, maybe you were
partial to the chorus of boos Barry
Bonds heard in San Diego or the
cheers that greeted him in San
Francisco.
For me, it took Jim Thome of the
World Champion White Sox. With
five homeruns already this year
(only two shy of his total in an in
jury-marred 2005 with the
Phillies), Chicago's designated hit
ter is proof, without question, of
the greatest aspect of professional
sports:
Games aren't won on paper.
And from that comes all of the
popularity sports have gained over
the years. Because as much as I'm
sure that the USC team that played
Texas in the Rose Bowl was the best
team in the country, the scoreboard
said differently. And that's why we
watch.
But with stories like Thome's,
the uncertainty of sports becomes
focused on an individual. And re
gardless of any team allegiances
you might have, you can't help but
feel happy for a player who was ba
sically written off, and then proved
his doubters wrong.
The slugger was, in many ways,
an afterthought acquisition in the
offseason. Picked up by Chicago in
late November, Thome was a re
placement for Frank Thomas, "The
Big Hurt," who ironically enough
hasn't experienced an injury-free
season himself in what seems like a
decade.
But Thome's production so far
has already hinted that he could
provide a dimension of pure power
that the Sox offense was lacking last
season. And playing for a team with
perhaps the deepest starting rota
tion in the league, and alongside fel
low offensive stalwart Paul Kon
erko and speedster Scott Podsed
nik,Thome has seemingly made the
Sox an even better team than the
one that thrashed all others in last
year's postseason.
Stuff like this is why money can't
buy championships, despite all the
efforts of owners like George Stein
brenner of the "Evil Empire." It still
takes brains, chemistry (not the
BALCO kind) and a sixth sense for
judging those players looking to
turn things around, like Thome.
Really, who could have guessed
that if both Barry Bonds and
Thome had started the year
healthy, it would be the Giants slug
ger, at this early juncture, down in
nearly all statistical categories. No
one saw the young Detroit slugger
Chris Shelton coming either, and
rookie Red Sox closer Jonathan Pa
pelbon seemingly appeared from
thin air onto the national scene.
Of course, the season is still very
young. So young it's practically
nonexistent, as most stats garnered
at this point of the year will have al
most no weight when 162 games
have been played.
Except, that is, for those players
whose numbers almost scream that
the best is yet to come. Players
whose comebacks and emergence
onto the scene make sports worth
watching. The individual stories
that don't make you wince. Stories
based around the game itself.
And after a long offseason, with
seemingly nothing but talk of scan
dal (see Barry Bonds), betrayal
(see Johnny Damon) and tragedy
(see Kirby Puckett), we need that
type of story to remind us why we
fell in love with the game in the first
place.
Because when all the prognosti
cating, sermons on the sanctity of
statistics and ruminations on the
greatness of the Yankees against
those plucky Red Sox are done, you
still have to play the games.
