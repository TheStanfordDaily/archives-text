## Farm plays host to USC, UCLA Room to improve this weekend after Card finish fifth at Arizona State 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's golf team finished fifth in a diffi
cult field last weekend at the Arizona State-hostedThun
derbird Invitational. This weekend, though, the team will
have to hold its ground at home, as the Cardinal host the
U.S. Intercollegiate on the Stanford Golf Course, April
15-16.
Heading into the Thunderbird in Phoenix, Ariz., the
Cardinal were eager to bounce back after a slightly dis
appointing lOth-place tie in the Morris Williams Inter
collegiate. After facing a few of the same teams, including
No. 21 Texas Tech, the Cardinal were able to improve to
fifth (838,14 under par).
"I thought it was a good effort," head coach Conrad
Ray said. "I'm not necessarily concerned with our score,
or our place in the tournament, but rather how we shot.
We were only eight shots back from the lead, which is
competitive."
Sophomore Rob Grube led the men at the Karsten
Golf Course, as he placed fourth with a three-round total
of 206 (7 under par). Grube had an even-par 71 in the first
round and improved to 67 and 68, respectively, in the lat
ter rounds. The strong finish is one of many in Grube's
positive turnaround this spring season, which includes an
individual title at the Western Intercollegiate.
"He's real consistent and that's his strength," Ray
said. "He's really good about managing his game and his
preparation, and what he does to get ready is probably
superior to anyone I've been around. He really gets out
of his game what he puts into it."
Also stepping up for the Cardinal was junior Zack
Miller, who tied for 11th with a three-under 210 (71-70-
69). Miller has also improved in the spring season, finish

ing second at the Ashworth Invitational in February.
Nevertheless, he still has untapped potential.
"He's definitely a guy that has enough birdie op
portunities, so he needs to continue to minimize mis
takes and just look for that consistency we all enjoy,"
Ray said. "Zack's game can be a little sporadic, in
terms of his short game and specifically on the greens,
but he's definitely a guy that we need to lean on in the
postseason."
With Miller and Grube performing well, the Cardinal
are looking for greater contributions from their three,
four and five players. Among those is senior Scott Mac-
Donald, who tied for 15th (211,2 under par) last week
end, as well as the freshmen, Daniel Lim (who tied for
42nd) and Dodge Kemmer.The latter have appeared in
many tournaments but have been inconsistent.
"All those guys can contribute, it's just a matter of
who's hot on a given week or a given day," Ray said.
The team's last regular tournament is this weekend's
U.S. Intercollegiate at Stanford. Although confident in
their knowledge of the course, the men are still working
hard to live up to high expectations
"I think the main thing for us is to hit it in the fairway,"
Ray said. "The rough has been high because of the
weather, putting a premium on driving the ball straight
off the tee."
Rain could be an issue through this weekend, but the
team is comfortable as long as the downpour doesn't in
tensify. Spending time back on campus after many away
tournaments should help the team recharge in prepara
tion for the postseason stretch ahead.
"The guys are feeling good about their chances, their
confidence is high and we've worked hard, so we're just
going to see what happens," Ray said.
This weekend's field includes Pac-10 rivals No. 5
UCLA and Southern California. The field provides one
last opportunity for the Cardinal to prove themselves be
fore the Pac-10 Championships at the end of the month.
Play begins Saturday at 7:30 a.m. and Sunday at 8 am
on the Stanford Golf Course.
