### ROHAN PURANIK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford women's lacrosse routed UC Davis 20-6 in
their home-finale on Monday. On Senior Night, appro
priately enough, senior attack Megan Burker rose to
the occasion, scoring as many goals as the entire Davis
squad.
Hat tricks from sophomore attack Daphne Patter
son and senior attack Sarah Bach complemented
Burker's double-hat trick.
The Cardinal allowed no rest for the Aggies' de
fense, beginning the onslaught just three minutes into
the game. Sophomore midfield/attack Megan McClain
scored the first goal of the match, setting off a five-goal
streak for Stanford.The Card held the Aggies scoreless
until only 11 minutes were left in the half.
The Aggies performed slightly better in the final 10
minutes of the first half, but could not match Stanford's
five goals in that span. Davis managed only three goals
in the first half, two from Eri Ichikawa.
The first half ended on a Burker goal with only sec
onds left, giving Stanford a 9-3 lead as the team head
ed into the locker room.

In the first half, Stanford doubled the Aggies' shot
attempts, shooting 16 times to Davis' eight. As the first
half ended, 2005 MSPF Goalkeeper of the Year sopho
more Laura Shane had recorded four saves. Senior
goalkeeper Kate Horowitz took over keeper duties for
the Cardinal in the second half.
The second half proceeded much like the first â€”
Stanford maintained its dominance. Burker scored her
fifth goal of the day less than a minute in. And while
Davis responded with two, the visitors were unpre
pared for a powerful Stanford offensive explosion.
Stanford netted an unprecedented ten goals from
the 19th minute onwards. The final seven goals of the
match came in less than 10 minutes, with Patterson
scoring two in the final minute.
Stanford once again outshot Davis in the period,
taking 14 shots against the Aggies' nine. The Stanford
defense was in top form as well, limiting Kate McMa
hon, one of the nation's top scorers, to a single goal.
The Cardinal have now defeated Davis in 12
straight meetings.The victory boosts Stanford's record
to 6-5 overall and 3-1 in conference, bringing the squad
closer to a fourth consecutive MPSF title.
Stanford also hosted the Western States tourna
ment this past Saturday and Sunday, an event designed
to promote lacrosse as a sport as well as support the
lacrosse community in the west. In all, 23 teams partic
ipated in the event.
