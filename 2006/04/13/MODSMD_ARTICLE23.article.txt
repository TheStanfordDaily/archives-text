						Smooth Transfer
## "This school is pretty perfect, and I was definitely missing out... last year." 
### MIA LEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Celia Durkin is a sophomore
transfer from Harvard, and one of
this year's additions to the in
domitable, top-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team. This week's
Through My Eyes takes a closer look
at the outstanding player, who is
ranked No. 35 in the nation and has
not dropped a match since last Octo
ber.
"Curiosity killed the cat."
Or perhaps in this case, froze it.
Last year, 1 was deciding between
Stanford and Harvard, and my curios
ity to go far away made me choose the
latter. It was only then that 1 really
found out that I am a definite Califor
nia girl. This school is pretty perfect,
and I was definitely missing out on a
real college experience last year.

CELIA DURKIN, sophomore

I think life was a lot harder at Har
vard. Mainly. I felt a big obstacle in fit
ting in with the crowd. The culture
there was very competitive. It's hard
to describe exactly, but the atmos
phere wasn't very welcoming, and I
didn't feel like the people there were
on my side, so to speak.
And yes, it's true, I am a competi
tive athlete. But there's a big differ
ence between competition in a social
setting and competition on the tennis
courts. I actually enjoy the latter.
Thawing out
Over spring break, we traveled as
a team to two matches. First, we went
to Los Angeles and played Pepper
dine in Malibu.The weather and set
ting were idyllic. To be honest, that
was about the only fun time we got
the whole break. Next, we went up
and played Oregon. When you com
pare Oregon to a place like Malibu,

well, there really is no comparison.
On the plus side of things, we
hung out a lot as a team, and we got a
lot closer while preparing for our
spring season.
Second guessing
Don't worry, I'm not actually
complaining about how hard I've
been working for the Stanford team.
It was when I was younger that 1 had
some doubts about tennis. Individu
ally, you have to be so much more
self-motivated. In junior high and
high school, when your friends are
doing something Saturday night, and
you're in bed early because you have
a match the next day, that's when
you definitely question whether it's
worth it.
As soon as college tennis hit,
though. I found out how much I real
ly loved the sport. It's so much more
fun coming to practice and looking
forward to seeing your team every
day at practice. And going out there
and having people root for you —
people who actually want you to do
well — I certainly don't question my
game anymore!
Coaching highs and lows
It's a world of difference, the
coaching experience here at Stanford.
Lele [Forood], our head coach, was a
professional player for a number of
years. She definitely knows what she's
doing.
Including Frankie [Brennan], our
assistant coach, I feel like both of our
coaches can really relate to us. I feel re
ally comfortable talking to them; they
treat us like adults and assume that we
get done what we need to get done.
In turn, my ears perk up when
they have advice to give. I know what
they have to say is very worthwhile.
At Harvard, by contrast, I'd say
the girls and I bonded over common
problems. It was a lot more negative
experience. We bonded over the fact
that there was bad coaching, or stress
with schoolwork and other time
commitments.
C>etting comfortable
The first person who befriended
me on the team was Theresa [Logar].
As soon as I first stepped on the
courts, she reached out to me and
started asking me all these questions.
She's such a dependable person and
such a hard worker, it's a joy to be
around her.
To sum up my previous experi
ence at college: Life was harder
there; the only thing softer was my
hair. As for Stanford, I don't think I'd
change a moment of it. I love the
people here, and my game's going in
a really good direction, too.
