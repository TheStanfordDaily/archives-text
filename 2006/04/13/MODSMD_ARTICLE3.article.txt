# SPRING BREAK
## Stanford students visit China Students get firsthand view of explosive Chinese growth 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
Thirty-four Stanford students spent 11
days over spring break in China observing
the consequences of the nation's rapid
growth firsthand. Students said the trip al
lowed them to visit dozens of development
projects and helped them understand the
vast scale of expansion.
The trip, coordinated with assistance
from the Natural Resource Defense Coun
cil (NRDC), gave students access to Chi
nese environmental and development lead
ers and representatives of numerous non
governmental and governmental sources.
"The trip was a huge treat on many di-
mensions," said Jane Woodward, a
consulting civil and environmental
engineering (CEE) professor who
coordinated the trip, the culmination
of a directed reading course.
Other than the United States,
China is the largest player in the
global energy market. Reflecting on
the trip this week, students said that
the level of growth they witnessed
was striking.
"The scale of nearly everything in
China is incomprehensible by U.S.
standards," said Mike Dvorak, a
CEE master's student. "Clusters of
skyscrapers go up in months, coal
power plant smokestacks dot the
landscape, air pollution dims the sun
and high-tension transmission
power lines are being strung up
daily...The potential for change is
tremendous."
"To drive for hours on a bus
through China without leaving de
veloped land (mostly housing and
agriculture) of some sort really ham
mers this home," said Atmosphere
and Energy CEE graduate student
Tomakin Archambault.
One of the highlights, participants
said, was the ITiursday visit to the
Thiee Gorges Dam. To build the
dam. the government forcibly relo
cated between 1.5 to 2 million peo
ple. The $25 billion project is project
ed to be completed in 2009. TTie dam
has drawn concerns about pollution
buildup in the reservoir, habitat loss,
silt build-up and carbon-dioxide
emissions.
"I have never seen such an im
mense, massive concentration of

concrete, nor have I ever seen so
many cranes in one place." said jun
ior Charlotte Helvistine. "Actually
standing on the structure that en
compasses so many environmental
processes and controversies — but
that also represents incredible inge
nuity — was definitely the highlight
of the trip for me."
Students were given access to
places at Three Gorges where even
Chinese nationals are not allowed,
participants said.
"We were able to walk around the
dam as it was still being constructed
and visit the control room." said jun
ior Lakshmi Alagappan, a human bi
ology and economics major. "It was
absolutely incredible to experience a
project of such enormity."
China increases its electricity
generation each year more than Cal
ifornia uses in total, said Danny Cul
lenward. a senior in earth systems
and co-terminal student in manage
ment science and engineering. The
students visited several power plants
and saw how the Chinese produce
their energy.
The country is trying to quadru
ple their gross domestic product
(GDP) by 2020, while only increas
ing their energy use by a factor of
two, Dvorak said. Coal already pro-

vides two-thirds of China's energy.
"Using potentially twice as much
coal in the next 15 years will exacer
bate China's already miserable air
pollution and increase China's
greenhouse gas emissions substan
tially," he said.
"Coal is probably going to domi
nate China's energy future," Ar
chambault said. "To accept this is
hard, but to ignore it is naive. The fact
that 80 to 90 percent of their new
coal plants are built without desul
phurization of any sort creates po
tential for one improvement that
seems obvious."
Cullenwald said the visits to coal
plants were the highlight, since he
has studied coal technology in the
United States.
"The most useful thing I take
away is the importance of what peo
ple call the "development first' ap
proach to climate change policy," he
said.
"Air pollution is the ever present
backdrop in China," Dvorak said.
"Reading does not prepare you for
that sad reality. A worse reality is
that some people in China will never
know what a breath of fresh air feels
like or how beautiful the mountains
near the Three Gorges Dam could be
without the haze."

"The readings we had were quite
thorough, but there's something
about scale that just doesn't translate
in readings," Alagappan said. "We
knew there was air pollution from
the readings, but we didn't know we
wouldn't have single blue sky day in
Beijing. We knew that Three Gorges
was the largest dam in the world, but
seeing it in person makes you realize
why this massive structure alone has
slightly changed the orbit of the
earth."
Students found rooftop solar
thermal water heating commonplace
in urban and rural areas. Dvorak said
that California could learn from in
novative efforts to reduce natural
gas consumption in China.
" ITiere seemed to be no substi
tute for simply going to see, feel,
smell, and hear what it was like to
stand on top of the Three Gorges
Dam (the world largest hydroelectic
facility), to have extensive tours of
giant coal power plants and to see
cities of over six million people
where the majority of residences
have solar hot water installations on
their rooftops or to visit the manu
facturing facilities of Sun Tech, the
hottest technology IPO of 2005
where production volumes of photo
voltaic modules continue to dramat
ically rise," Woodward wrote in an
email to The Daily.
All in all, she said, the trip was a
success.
"It seems miraculous that we did
not lose anyone, no one got sick and
we all had a great time," Woodward
said. "As I like to say the trip in
volved many surprises — especially
with respect to what each day would
hold, but there were far more posi
tive surprises than negative ones."
She hopes to organize a similar
trip again for spring break 2(H)N.
