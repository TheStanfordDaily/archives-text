# CAMPUS LIFE
## Immigration policy changes impact campus Professors, students closely monitor Congressional debate and resulting protests 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
Congressional changes in immigration policy
could have a profound impact on workers, stu
dents and the University, protesters and profes
sors said this week.
Over the last two weeks. House and Senate
members have deliberated over various propos
als that would either relax or strengthen immi
gration rules. A tentative compromise in the Sen
ate that would have provided a path to citizen
ship for up to 12 million unraveled last Friday.
Immigration — long a third wheel in American
politics — appears to be on the agenda for Con
gress when it returns from Easter recess.
Earlier this week, hundreds of thousands
demonstrated across the country to pressure law
makers to pass a comprehensive immigration
bill. An estimated 30 students fenced off White

Political Science Prof. Luis Fraga com
mented on the issue's implications for the
University.
"We are an example of an institution that
is embedded in these larger issues of interna
tionalization and especially the migration of
people across national boundary lines," he
said. "Our position as a leader in Silicon Val
ley and in California as the gateway to Asia
as well as Latin America puts us right in the
middle not just of the study of these issues,
but of taking responsibility for understand
ing how they immediately affect our daily
lives."
According to Fraga. immigration is a com
plex issue linked with the rising level of glob
alization.
"There's a way of understanding the
perennial complexity and especially current
complexity regarding immigration as yet an
other example of how interdependent our
world economy has become and how critical
not only the mobility of capital, but the mo
bility of labor is in this continuing evolution
of interdependency across traditional na
tional boundary lines," he said.
"We greatly depend upon the labor of
Mexican workers and workers from other
Central American countries to provide im
portant services to us, whether it's in our
kitchens, in the cleaning of our offices or our
dormitories, in landscape work, or in some of
the more technical fields, like the highest lev
els of engineering and physics, where we de
pend on highly skilled graduate students and
post-docs from the developing world to have
the knowledge base for us to be able to do
the work we do," he added.
Bruce Wooley, chair of the Electrical En
gineering Department, estimated that more
than 60 percent of graduate students in elec
trical engineering are foreign-born, a pro
portion that has grown from about 50 per
cent a decade ago.
Regarding admission, Wooley said,
"We've always really been blind to issues of
nationality. We've just been fortunate that
we've been able to attract the best students
in the world, wherever they're from.
"1 think if the [negative] perception [of
immigrants] begins to impact our ability to
attract the best people, then that is a serious
problem for this department, for the Univer
sity, and for the country," he added.
Freshman Anish Mitra agreed.
"If the House's immigration reforms are
passed, it will create a hostile environment

for all foreigners in the United States, legal
or illegal," he said. "Foreign students may be
less likely to come to Stanford if they feel
like they're not wanted."
"I think we will suffer greatly in the long
term if we close doors to these people," Woo
ley said. "The leading universities have been
working on this issue in Washington to try
and keep the doors open."
Protesters at Monday's rally emphasized
the human aspect of the immigration debate.
"This is an issue that affects a lot of peo
ple's lives here," said junior Linda Lee, who
organized the demonstration Monday. "Stu
dents might have family members or friends
who are undocumented or just immigrants
themselves. A lot of students are making con
nections with that."
The protest was intended "to educate the
Stanford community about how this issue af
fects them," said organizer Frankie Preciado,
a junior.
Lee added that "the visibility [of the
issue] isn't very high on campus. I think that
there's a lot of education that needs to be
done. That's something that we're working
on."
She said she was concerned about provi
sions in some of the measures being consid
ered by Congress, such as restrictions on aid
to illegal immigrants.
"It would criminalize not only anyone
who is here without papers, but anyone who
is going to help undocumented immigrants,"
she said. "That's really where it's going to hit
Stanford students because we won't be able
to do the kind of work that we want to do."
Stanford has historically been a leader in
outreach to other international academic in
stitutions. The University has stressed the
importance of international study in a time
of globalization, most recently demonstrated
with the announcement of last year's Inter
national Initiative.
"Stanford can immediately be affected by
this issue — not just as a source of study, but
in our own lives," Fraga said.

bility of labor is in this continuing evolution
of interdependency across traditional na
tional boundary lines," he said.
"We greatly depend upon the labor of
Mexican workers and workers from other
Central American countries to provide im
portant services to us, whether it's in our
kitchens, in the cleaning of our offices or our
dormitories, in landscape work, or in some of
the more technical fields, like the highest lev
els of engineering and physics, where we de
pend on highly skilled graduate students and
post-docs from the developing world to have
the knowledge base for us to be able to do
the work we do," he added.
Bruce Wooley, chair of the Electrical En
gineering Department, estimated that more
than 60 percent of graduate students in elec
trical engineering are foreign-born, a pro
portion that has grown from about 50 per
cent a decade ago.
Regarding admission, Wooley said,
"We've always really been blind to issues of
nationality. We've just been fortunate that
we've been able to attract the best students
in the world, wherever they're from.
"1 think if the [negative] perception [of
immigrants] begins to impact our ability to
attract the best people, then that is a serious
problem for this department, for the Univer
sity, and for the country," he added.
Freshman Anish Mitra agreed.
"If the House's immigration reforms are
passed, it will create a hostile environment

for all foreigners in the United States, legal
or illegal," he said. "Foreign students may be
less likely to come to Stanford if they feel
like they're not wanted."
"I think we will suffer greatly in the long
term if we close doors to these people," Woo
ley said. "The leading universities have been
working on this issue in Washington to try
and keep the doors open."
Protesters at Monday's rally emphasized
the human aspect of the immigration debate.
"This is an issue that affects a lot of peo
ple's lives here," said junior Linda Lee, who
organized the demonstration Monday. "Stu
dents might have family members or friends
who are undocumented or just immigrants
themselves. A lot of students are making con
nections with that."
The protest was intended "to educate the
Stanford community about how this issue af
fects them," said organizer Frankie Preciado,
a junior.
Lee added that "the visibility [of the
issue] isn't very high on campus. I think that
there's a lot of education that needs to be
done. That's something that we're working
on."
She said she was concerned about provi
sions in some of the measures being consid
ered by Congress, such as restrictions on aid
to illegal immigrants.
"It would criminalize not only anyone
who is here without papers, but anyone who
is going to help undocumented immigrants,"
she said. "That's really where it's going to hit
Stanford students because we won't be able
to do the kind of work that we want to do."
Stanford has historically been a leader in
outreach to other international academic in
stitutions. The University has stressed the
importance of international study in a time
of globalization, most recently demonstrated
with the announcement of last year's Inter
national Initiative.
"Stanford can immediately be affected by
this issue — not just as a source of study, but
in our own lives," Fraga said.
