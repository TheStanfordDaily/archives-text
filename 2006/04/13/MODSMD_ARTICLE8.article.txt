# COMING EVENTS
## This week on Family Guy: Stanford 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD MANAGING EDITOR 
According to rankings on Face
book.com, "Family Guy" tops the list of
the most popular television shows on
college campuses, including Stanford. It
comes as somewhat of a surprise, then,
that Seth MacFarlane, the show's cre
ator and Emmy award-winning execu
tive producer, rarely checks in with this
fanbase.
That looks to change this weekend
when MacFarlane will speak at Stanford
Sunday at 6:15 in Memorial Auditorium.
The talk was arranged by the ASSU
Speakers Bureau, which brought activist
rapper Chuck D and former ambassador
Joseph Wilson to campus earlier this
year.
"Family Guy is one of, if not the, most

popular television shows among college
students,so we are very fortunate to have
Seth MacFarlane come to Stanford, espe
cially considering he does not make very
many appearances on college campuses,"
said Director of the ASSU Speakers Bu
reau Adam Kahn, a graduate student in
communication, in a press release. "This
is one of the biggest and most talked
about events in my time at Stanford and I
believe people are going to have a won
derful time Sunday night."
Tickets are free for students, faculty
and staff, and will be on sale today and
Friday from noon to 1 p.m. in White
Plaza. A special sale for graduate stu
dents will be held at the Graduate Com
munity Center from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m.
today. Non-Stanford students may pur
chase tickets for $ 15, while general public
tickets cost $20. Tickets will be available

online at http://speakers.stanford.edu; a
limited number of tickets will also be sold
at the door.
"I think everyone going to the event
on Sunday has a really fun evening in
store for them," said ASSU Senate
Deputy Chair Danny Arbeiter, a sopho
more, in the release. "The ASSU Speak
ers Bureau has invested a lot of time and
energy in bringing Seth MacFarlane to
campus, and I think if he is anywhere near
as entertaining in person as his show is on
TV, it will be time and energy very well
spent."
MacFarlane provides the voices of
many of the show's characters, including
Peter Griffin, Brian Griffin, Stewie Grif
fin and Glen Quagmire. Said Kahn, chan
neling his best Peter Griffin impression:
"Make sure to get your tickets early â€”
the event's going to be freakin' sweet."
