II Fornaio
520 Cowper Street, (at the
Garden Court Hotel), Palo Alto
(650) 853-3888

If your parents are in town and
they want to take you out to din
ner, if you're looking to enjoy a
special celebratory dinner with some
friends, or if you're in the minority
among Stanford students and need a
nice place to take a date, consider a
visit to II Fornaio. At II Fornaio, ami
able, professional service, a comfort
able atmosphere, and nicely prepared
food combine to create a thoroughly
enjoyable dining experience Al
though II Fornaio's prices are on the
higher end, they aren't as terrible as
they could be at a restaurant that
leans away from "casual" towards
"upscale."
I visited II Fornaio on two occa
sions; each time I was more than sat
isfied with the quality of my meal. On
my first visit, my salad with gorgonzo
la,frissee,endive, grapes, and walnuts
was lightly dressed only with olive oil,
allowing full appreciation of the deli
cious combination of these ingredi
ents. On my second visit. I tried the
insalata de la casa ($5.95) of romaine.
avocado, and tomato: it was quite en
joyable, but the gorgonzola salad is
more worthy of 11 Fornaio's salads'
steep prices.
For more reasonably priced offer
ings, look to II Fornaio's pasta dishes
made from homemade pasta. I or
dered potato and mushroom gnocchi
with gorgonzola sauce ($13.95) from
the regional specials menu that ro
tates throughout the year, and I'm
still grieving that this perfectly deca
dent dish will disappear from the
menu after a short time. The cappel
lacci di zucca ($14.95) - butternut
squash ravioli - has a permanent
home on the menu and is tasty as
well, although slightly too oily.
If you're treating yourself to a meal
at II Fornaio, you must go all out and
order one of their fabulously scrump
tious desserts. It's rare to find good za
baloine, and finding it in II Fornaio's
zabalione with fresh berries ($6.75) is
truly heaven on Earth. Delicious
apple crepes ($7.50) make for another
enticing option, served with vanilla
bean gelato and creme angliase,
caramel sauce, and whipped cream.
These desserts are truly top of the line.
Although most of what II Fornaio
offers is of very high quality, it does
have some faults. Picky observers of
the restaurant's aesthetics might no
tice an especially ugly ceiling (in con
trast to other finer aspects of the
decor). Also, I couldn't stop noticing
how condensation gathered on the
inside of the empty wine bottles on
display and wondering why they had
n't been filled with water to make
them appear full. On my first visit,
both my fork and my dining compan
ion's glass were dirty. However, I the
delicious food food allowed me to
forget these detractors. Overall, II
Fornaio certainly gets a thumbs up.
Until my budget allows me to enjoy
another full meal there, I'm tempted
to head back just to enjoy a great
dessert!
