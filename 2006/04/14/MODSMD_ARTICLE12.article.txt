"Tea Time is definitely
a reminder of a more relaxed
time in history;" kyle bruck

If you've ever wandered University Av
enue on a Friday afternoon, you may have
run into a group of Stanford students sip
ping tea and munching crumpets. Soto has
an ongoing tradition of partaking in this
tradition every Friday — for the last three
years.
"Tea Time" is the name of a small, quaint tea
shop in downtown Palo Alto, one block off
University Avenue across from the Old Pro
and Nola's.
"The Tea Time tradition started when my co-
RA Gautam Raghavan and 1 were talking be
fore staff meeting about trying out the tea
shop I had seen earlier that week," former
Soto RA Kyle Bruck explained. "Gautam
and I joked that we wanted to be pretentious,
sipping tea and eating crumpets with fake
British accents."
But Soto's tradition is anything but pre
tentious. Instead, as Bruck remarked,"lt is
a time to relax after a hard day or week,
drink tea, eat crumpets, talk and play cards.
Some kids bring their work, some kids just
come to talk and others play bridge."
Raghavan has fond memories of his
weekly Tea Time adventures.
"We got a lot of strange looks — most
of the people there are on the 'mature'
end and were surprised to see us college
students enjoying tea and a game of
bridge," he said. Raghavan is currently
working in Washington D.C., but makes a

point of partaking in the Friday afternoon break
every time he returns to Stanford.
They're rowdy, they bring good business and
they often fill the entirety of the tiny restaurant.
Owners of the Tea Time shop remember various
Stanford groups regularly coming as well, but
never as consistently as Soto.
Many now go next door to their competitor
Coupa Cafe, but Bruck says it is too crowded,
too loud and too fast-paced.
"Tea time is definitely a reminder of a more re
laxed time in history," Bruck commented.
Current Soto RA Stephanie Sud carries on
the Tea Time legacy.
"It's a great dorm event because we have al
ways gotten a group of kids to come that don't
necessarily come to the more traditional dorm
events," she explained. Bruck added that "In a
lot of dorms, when students move out, you
don't really see them again." But Soto resi
dents, past and present, still come together.
Tea Time goers like Bruck agree that the
Parisian crumpet is "the best part of the Tea
Time experience." The Parisian consists of a
crumpet toasted with brie cheese and green
apple slices on top.
Current Tea Time owner.Thao, hopes to ex
pand his quiet shop into a more happening
hangout. Its grand re-opening is today after
extensive renovation. Whether you're
looking for a quiet study spot or a relaxing
place to converse, consider Tea Time for
your destination.
