# Lagunita a surprise veggie paradise
## 
### 
Welcome hack to the fourth episode of "Desti
nation Dining", where we're following our
daring diners, Christina Liehner and David
Louk, as they scour campus eating establish
ments for a good vegetarian meal. Their standards are
high and their appetites deep, and they won't rest until
they find the perfect balance of protein, carbs, fiber and
freshness.
Desperate to resuscitate our taste buds from the
blandness of Branner and ravenous for a legitimate
source of veggie-derived protein, your courageous culi
nary compatriots loaded the covered wagon, hitched up
the oxen, and headed West. Liebner and Louk had
grown tired of the overcooked, mass-produced taste of
East Campus dining, and longed to strike out for the

fresh salad bars of Lakeside (Lagunita) Dining — hav
ing heard tell that the lentil soup flows freely over gold
plated spoons! But the journey would try even the
hardiest of souls: how many rivers would they have to
ford? Would their single-barrel shotgun take down the
wild seitan that range the Plains? And the question that
weighed heaviest on their minds: who would be the first
to succumb to typhoid as a result of missing amino acids
in their diets?
And as Liebner and Louk dragged their travel-weary
bodies into the "servery" and saw the cornucopia of op
tions before them, they knew that the journey had not
been in vain. Here, indeed, was one of the finest vegetar
ian-friendly dorm dining halls on campus. Liebner gazed
at a humble, yet well-stocked salad bar that stood stout in

the middle of the servery floor and was filled with
legumes, fruits, and vegetables. She then grazed — on
kidney and garhanzo beans, green and red bell peppers,
carrots, celery, beets, radicchio, watermelon, cantaloupe,
radish, squash, plain tofu, red cabbage and more — a ver
itable rainbow of flavors guaranteed to color your plate
and satisfy your PHE.
While Liebner was having an okra orgasm at the salad
bar, Louk turned to find a phenomenal pasta bar. It was
then that our culinary colonists realized that Lagunita
was the Destination for Italian Dining. And destination it
was: Liebner and Louk watched in awe as the chef behind
the counter lightly graced a skillet with olive oil, artfully
tossed in a pinch of this and a pinch of that, generously la
dled in pcnne and vegetables, and masterfully tossed the

concoction as it cooked. After a few minutes, he topped
off his creation with crumbled feta and basil and served it
up. It doesn't get much fresher than that, folks. And
paired with the toasted baguette slices and garlic olive oil
(real pieces of diced roasted garlic! And as the campus
vampires can no doubt attest, them's was some fresh, po
tent garlic) offered at the end of the line, the two were in
pasta paradise.


Christina Liebner
& David Louk

Destination Dining
Louk was ready to dedicate him
self entirely to the pasta, but Liebn
er's nose caught the tempting scent
of curry that led her to the other end
of the servery. Thus began bartha
eggplant, curried cauliflower, and a
savory daal simmered in trays while
tamarind, mango, cilantro mint chut
neys and cucumber raita waited in
bowls to accompany the meal. Soft
naan and crispy samosas crowded
the rapidly diminishing real estate on
our plates.Two rice cookers kept bas
mati white and brown rice warm
without clumping the grains. Appar
ently funding for Lakeside Dining is
underwritten by Sesame Street, be
cause it appeared as though Laguni
ta is sponsored by the letter "I" — or
any cuisine that starts with that let
ter. The Indian food was even more
plentiful than the Italian.
While Liebner pondered the com
peting genres of grub, Louk s jaw fell
to the floor at the sight of — get this

folks — vegetarian gravy! Who knew
such a thing would, and indeed could,
exist?! As a longtime veggie sympa
thizer, Louk had always avoided
gravy, assuming it could only ever be
made with giblets, or birds' parts, or
something that used to live and
breathe and prance peacefully across
fields of gold. As a result, Louk had
never before known the divine dress
ing that is gravy — at least not until
vegetarian-friendly Lagunita brewed
up a "look ma. no meat parts!" ver
sion. Louk spooned hearty heaps of
mashed red potatoes onto his plate
and bathed them in the smooth, rich
(and good for your karma, too) sauce.
But that was not all! With the gravy
and potatoes, Louk scooped up
small, warm, buttery cornbread
muffins with chopped red pepper
and barbecued baked tofu steaks; all
that was missing were the baconless
baked beans and we'd have our
selves a good ol' American backyard

cookout — veggie-style.
Louk and Liebner couldn't wait
to find a seat and dig in, but there
was one more place to visit: the
dessert bar. Liebner ladled up a
steamy mugful of spiced cider and
gawked at the array of sweet pud
dings and creamy yogurt. Mean
while, Louk put his culinary creativ
ity to work at the "make-your-own
crepes" bar, and keeping in mind
the First Law of Pluto's from his
dessert experience at FloMo (too
many ingredients, while delicious
on their own, can make for a pretty
unpleasant combination), crafted a
perfect chocolate sauce-caramel
strawberries-n-cream crepe. With
their trays ready to crack in half
from the full plates, and with their
stomachs and taste buds prepared
to jump ex corpus unless they got at
that food soon, Louk and Liebner
sat down to their greatest Stanford
veggie meal yet.

Any place that gets Liebner, a
sworn enemy of eggplant, to go back
for seconds deserves full marks, so
here it is (remember, the more cere
al, the less appetizing the food is;
more blocks of tofu mean more pro
tein for us):
5 out of 5 blocks of tofu
0 out of 5 bowls of cereal
And the rankings so far:
1. Lagunita: 5 tofu, 0 cereal
2. Florence Moore: 3.5 tofu, 1.5 cereal
3. Ricker: 1 tofu, 5 cereal
4. Branner: 0 tofu, 0 cereal (they did
n't even have any cereal)

Louk didn't catch typhoid, but he is
out with mono. Send him get well
wishes at dlouk@stanford.edu. Liebn
er knows her squash from her zucchi
ni, but not her squash from her rac
quetball. To teach her how to play,
