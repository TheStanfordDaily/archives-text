# Lagunita a surprise veggie paradise
## 
### 
Welcome hack to the fourth episode of "Desti
nation Dining", where we're following our
daring diners, Christina Liehner and David
Louk, as they scour campus eating establish
ments for a good vegetarian meal. Their standards are
high and their appetites deep, and they won't rest until
they find the perfect balance of protein, carbs, fiber and
freshness.
Desperate to resuscitate our taste buds from the
blandness of Branner and ravenous for a legitimate
source of veggie-derived protein, your courageous culi
nary compatriots loaded the covered wagon, hitched up
the oxen, and headed West. Liebner and Louk had
grown tired of the overcooked, mass-produced taste of
East Campus dining, and longed to strike out for the

fresh salad bars of Lakeside (Lagunita) Dining — hav
ing heard tell that the lentil soup flows freely over gold
plated spoons! But the journey would try even the
hardiest of souls: how many rivers would they have to
ford? Would their single-barrel shotgun take down the
wild seitan that range the Plains? And the question that
weighed heaviest on their minds: who would be the first
to succumb to typhoid as a result of missing amino acids
in their diets?
And as Liebner and Louk dragged their travel-weary
bodies into the "servery" and saw the cornucopia of op
tions before them, they knew that the journey had not
been in vain. Here, indeed, was one of the finest vegetar
ian-friendly dorm dining halls on campus. Liebner gazed
at a humble, yet well-stocked salad bar that stood stout in

the middle of the servery floor and was filled with
legumes, fruits, and vegetables. She then grazed — on
kidney and garhanzo beans, green and red bell peppers,
carrots, celery, beets, radicchio, watermelon, cantaloupe,
radish, squash, plain tofu, red cabbage and more — a ver
itable rainbow of flavors guaranteed to color your plate
and satisfy your PHE.
While Liebner was having an okra orgasm at the salad
bar, Louk turned to find a phenomenal pasta bar. It was
then that our culinary colonists realized that Lagunita
was the Destination for Italian Dining. And destination it
was: Liebner and Louk watched in awe as the chef behind
the counter lightly graced a skillet with olive oil, artfully
tossed in a pinch of this and a pinch of that, generously la
dled in pcnne and vegetables, and masterfully tossed the

concoction as it cooked. After a few minutes, he topped
off his creation with crumbled feta and basil and served it
up. It doesn't get much fresher than that, folks. And
paired with the toasted baguette slices and garlic olive oil
(real pieces of diced roasted garlic! And as the campus
vampires can no doubt attest, them's was some fresh, po
tent garlic) offered at the end of the line, the two were in
pasta paradise.
