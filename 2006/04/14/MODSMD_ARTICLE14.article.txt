## Editorial Our annual rant about the Stanford Bookstore 
### 
We are getting gouged on book
prices, and the Stanford Bookstore
is not doing anything about it.
Freshmen lay down $300 for the same chem
istry textbooks sitting on your shelf right
now, never to be opened again. Those books
sit right alongside all those I HUM classics
that aren't worth the 76 cents you'd get sell
ing them back to the Bookstore.
The fact that students continue to balk at
textbook prices suggests that the Bookstore
needs to be more transparent about their
pricing. We want to know why we have to
pay more for the very same books that we
buy online for much less. We want to know
why a 200-page course reader can cost over
a hundred dollars. Exactly what percent of
our money goes into paying for copyrights,
overheads and the convenience of having a
book store on campus, and how much of it is
pure profit for the Bookstore? We want to
know.
But this is not about getting ripped off; it's
about being wasteful. Some books are worth
owning; others aren't. Some books you care
if the margins are clean; others you don't.
Most books fall into the latter categories, but
we still end up shelling out a few hundred
dollars each quarter for more dead trees,
wasting money on books that we'll never
read once the quarter is over.
Something must be done, and we're not
talking about Amazon.com here, folks. In a
10-week quarter, you need to have your
books before midterms roll around. And if
you want to take advantage of the class
shopping period, you need your textbooks
within the first few weeks of the quarter.
No one should have to pay the prices dic
tated by the Stanford Bookstore when there
are so many viable alternatives. If you can af
ford to wait a few weeks, try finding a bar
gain from an online book merchant. Ask
people in your dorm for a used copy of a
course reader — most of them don't change
from year to year.
Newsgroups like su.market and su.mar

ket.textbooks are invaluable resources for
students looking to buy and sell their books
— even technophobes can easily access
these sites with the assistance of a friendly
resident computer consultant. Other Web
sites like ComeGetUsed.com and Chegg
(formerly Textopedia) provide similar op
portunities for students to trade books. It
only takes a few minutes to post an adver
tisement on these sites, but the money you
make could pay for a swanky meal in down
town Palo Alto.
Alternatively, wouldn't it be fun to band
together and create a People's Market in the
looming shadow of Hoover Tower? The
ASSU and class presidents should organize
a book fair in White Plaza where students
could barter their books — running it like a
flea market or a frat party. Serving alcohol
and other equally attractive non-alcoholic
beverages (EANABs) might also help to
take the sting out of buying expensive text
books. Besides being fun, a book fair would
also be cost-effective.
Individual departments should also coor
dinate book sales between students. These
can be integrated into existing social mixers,
where students within a department could
exchange textbooks and swap stories and
advice too. If not.departments could provide
students with a list of other students who
took the course previously and are looking
to sell their used textbooks.
Professors can also take steps to help stu
dents save money. Make it clear which books
are required and which are not. Place all
textbooks and course readers on reserve in
the library. Avoid changing course readers
from year to year, or at least make copies of
additional readings for students working off
a used copy. Better yet, post course materials
online on Coursework so students can de
cide which readings they want to print.
Meanwhile, have your teaching assistants
look into prices at Kinko's and other photo
copying services; they might offer better
deals than the pricey Bookstore.
