# Making a difference
## 
### 
Today is a very important day. A day
steeped in history. A day when the sins
of the past are finally put to rest and a
glorious vista of the future is revealed. Yes,
that's right — it's time for the ASSU elec
tion results.
Finally, the annual farce that passes for
democracy inaction around here is over. Pre
sumably the who and what of victory and de
feat is plastered all over the front page, so
you've already absorbed the outcome and
are now looking for some insightful com
mentary.
It's difficult, though, to be truly insightful
about something so utterly pointless. Still,
let's see what I can do.
There's an old pun that gets pulled out for
election season (including by me): In action
versus inaction. It's an easy way to point out
that successful democracy is often synony
mous with apathy. And apathy is generally
thought to be bad.
Of course, what's true of real elections
with actual consequences doesn't necessari
ly apply to the little games played here on
campus. Student politics is vaguely enter
taining (in much the same way that animals
dressed up like people are entertaining), but
that's no reason to encourage such behavior
by voting.
Whichever one of Heng with Graham or
Rillera/Nguyen or The Sound and the Fury
wins, your life will be completely unchanged.
Likewise, regardless of whom you vote onto
GSC, no one will ever stand out enough for
you to notice.
The enthusiasm with which the week's de
cision-making process has been covered in
this publication is indicative of general
overkill that applies whenever the veneer of
self-awareness is dropped in favor of a
slathering of self-righteous political postur
ing.
It is a constant source of amazement that
people manage to be quite so excited about
the little things in life. The sheer volume of
paper covering White Plaza would be mildly
disturbing by itself, but in combination with
the dreadful punning that passes for cam
paigning in these elections, it's deeply trou
bling.
If one were being cynical, one could point
out that the emphasis on pithy slogans and
blanket coverage is merely reflective of the
downward spiral national politics has em
braced: If style over substance was good
enough for Bush and Kerry, surely we
shouldn't be surprised to see it here. I would,
however, take a different view.
Campaigns on campus should be run even
more like their real life counterparts. Think
how much more entertaining the last few

weeks would have been if Heng with Graham
had accused Rillera/Nguyen of fathering an
illegitimate child and having gone insane
after five and half years in a POW camp?
I suppose that it could be argued that
even if the choice of people is irrelevant, the
selection of where your money goes does
matter. But really, a few dollars a piece here
and there is going to bankrupt you. In fact
you're not even going to notice any changes
in your fees.
Now, if you're one of the people who rely
on these fringe groups to provide your Sun
day morning breakfast, then perhaps you
might be justified in caring about the out
come. However, since most things manage to
slip past the scrutiny of the electorate, I don't
think you should have worried too much.
And, to be honest, anything that failed to get
funding probably didn't deserve it (in fact,
most of stuff that did get funding probably
didn't deserve it either).
Actually, if you're a graduate student
there was one measure on the ballot that is
significant. The Graduate Student Transport
Fee — or, alternatively, the "let's get the
poor saps who live on campus to subsidize
my San Francisco lifestyle" fee.
This, if it passed, would cost noticeable
amounts of cash (around $20 a quarter) and
benefit very few people. Since I'm one of
those people. I obviously voted in favor and
will be happy to see it pass. On the other
hand, even this is not going to change that
many lives.
T\venty dollars a quarter is money, but re
ally, no one will notice the difference in their
bill. And if the measure fails, well sure there
will be a few people who will take a hit, but
we're mostly a smug lot and probably de
serve a kick in the financial teeth for expect
ing everyone else to pay for our attempts at
urban living.
Well congratulations to the losers; at least
you tried to score the resume points. As for
the winners, you should remember that with
great power comes great responsibility, so
you can pretty much take it easy for next
year.
