# What really counts

The ASSU elections just passed me by.
Many diligent campaigners spent
hours taping posters to bathroom
stalls and shaking voters? hands (bringing us
one step closer to a global bird flu outbreak).
I felt a small breeze, but that was about it.
I barely noticed. Why? Maybe because
I'm not black, American Indian or Muslim.
And I don't drive or build solar cars.
This is not to say that I dislike Muslims,
American Indians or black people. I don't
even dislike solar cars. In fact, I like all of
these things. 1 also like jazz orchestras,
movies in Memorial Auditorium, engaging
speakers and free copies of The New York
Times — all activities and perks that were
voted upon this week. Yet based on the bom
bardment of posters littering my bathroom,
hallways and classrooms, I can't help but
wonder why ASSU elections have become a
yearly referendum on Stanford diversity.
Almost every April brings another heated
debate over funding for MEChA. Why? Be
cause Stanford students are racist? Because
MEChA itself is racist? Because the benefits
of a group like MEChA are too concentrated
for too small of a community? Because of the
concerted efforts of a xenophobic conserva
tive minority? Or because special fees aren't
the appropriate source of funding for such a
group?
I don't know. Maybe it's all of these things.
Maybe it's none of them.
Senate elections suffer from the same my
opia. I received a number of emails and flyers
urging me to vote for the candidates en

dorsed by the Students of Color Coalition
(SOCC), who are deemed to be those most
capable of "supporting people of color" and
"improving campus life for students of
color."
My dismay — and it's a dismay that's
bound to get me lots of hate mail, so get your
pens ready —is that there were no white
faces on their yearbook-style endorsement
sheet. It wasn't even a particularly represen
tative mix. Asians are by far the largest ethnic
group on campus, yet only a couple of
SOCC's 14 endorsements went to Asian stu
dents. The African-American and Latino
populations are roughly the same in number,
yet SOCC's endorsements are heavily
weighted towards the former.
These are endorsements, not decrees. En
dorsements indicate a slate of people that
share the same interests and objectives, and
the implication of SOCC's endorsements is
that not a single white candidate is capable of
"supporting people of color."
If that's true, it's infinitely disheartening.
If it's not, then why isn't there a little more di
versity on the endorsement list?

Maybe it's not a fair critique. After all,
who better to represent Asian students than
other Asian students? But given the power
that SOCC has in influencing election results
(which has been demonstrated time and time
again), maybe they'd do the campus good to
expand their parameters a bit and let voters
know which candidates — white, black or
otherwise — share the goals of the organiza
tion.
I can imagine all the Letters to the Editor
being mentally composed right now. Critics
will label me a Republican, a racist, a rascal
or a ridiculously big fan of alliteration. I'm
not any of these things, except the last. I
come from a homogeneously vanilla South
ern California suburb, so I'm proud that
Stanford is as diverse as it is, even more di
verse, in fact, than the nation at large.
My hope, however, is that race should not
be the singular variable upon which votes are
cast in future ASSU elections. It should be
one of many Student parking permits face an
impending price hike, residents of the Lower
Row awake with jackhammers in their ears
every morning and the administration's tee
totalers are tightening alcohol policies all the
time.
Address one of these issues on your fliers,
dear Candidates, and I'll look forward to
going to the bathroom to read it.

Oh, gosh. Do I really have to give out my email
address? Fine. It's harretts@stanford.edu. You
can also go to www.stanforddaily.com to submit
a Letter to the Editor.
