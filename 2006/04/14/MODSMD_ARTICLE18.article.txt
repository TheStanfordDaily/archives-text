## PARIS MARATHON To do in Paris: Eiffel Tower, wine, marathon? 
### SARAH DOUGLAS 
On April 9, Gashaw Melese won the 30th
Paris Marathon in two hours, eight minutes.
Russian IrinaTimofeyeva was the first woman
to finish.coming in with a time of two hours, 27
minutes and 19 seconds.
Or so I was told. I wasn't actually there to
see either of them finish, because I was still
chugging away somewhere around the half
way point, a very long 13 miles away.
For mere mortals, running the Paris
Marathon is like eating a large wheel of fa
mous French cheese: it's smelly, it takes a long
time and immediately afterward you feel sick.
But at least with the marathon, you get a
medal at the finish line and bragging rights

forever (though if I managed the cheese, I'd
still brag).
But my trip to the finish line was a lot
longer than 26.2 miles (and no, I didn't get
lost).
It all began last December when I was ad
mitted to the Spring Stanford Programme at
Oxford. Being the runner that I am. I immedi
ately began to look for a nearby marathon.
Call me crazy, but I honestly believe the best
way to explore a city is on foot and lacking glu
cose.
Unfortunately, both the London and Paris
marathons had just closed their registrations,
and there was no legitimate way I could enter
either one. Of course, there is always the odd
unregistered runner, who usually gets tackled

by security right before the
finish line — not exactly
how I'd want to be treated
after that much running.
But little did I know that
I had a little something
called the French Govern
ment on my side.
The average Stanford
student might not know
that the French Ministry of
Foreign Affairs gave our

university $1 million in 2003 to found the
France-Stanford Center for Interdisciplinary
Studies. Through a variety of means, France is
courting top American college students in
order to improve relations between our two
great countries.
1 managed to convince the Powers That Be
that running sweaty through the streets of
Paris would do just that. A well-placed word
from the French embassy in Washington D.C.
to le Directeur du Marathon de Paris, and al
lons-y! I got my registration in the mail just in
time for winter midterms and managed to
squeeze in enough mileage so that I wouldn't
embarrass myself come race time.
After all this political maneuvering, 1
thought a simple run through the streets of
Paris would be a cinch.
Lecon numero un: never underestimate
the difficulty of running 26.2 miles, even if
you've done it before. The optimism I had at
the Champs-Elysee started to fade by the Bois
de Vincennes, around mile nine, when I was
sucking air pretty hard. Which leads to lecon
numero deux: European men are smelly. Not
to perpetuate stereotypes, but the men in the
New York marathon smelled like daises com
pared to the guys that made up 85 percent of
the Paris marathon crowd. Maybe the deodor
ant makers were rioting.
Once out of the Bois de Vincennes, the
course led us through some beautiful French
neighborhoods, where bewildered locals
looked on. We ran along the Seine River for a
while, and even through the tunnel where
Princess Diana died. We were offered special
ty cheeses en route, in addition to the normal
orange and banana rest-station fair.There was

even Beajolais wine at mile 21. which more
than a few aching runners used to numb the
pain. The Eiffel Tower peeked coyly through
the skyline a few times to cheer us on, and we
finally ended in sight of the Arc de Triomphe.
After running for 4 hours, 11 minutes and
39 seconds, I felt more tired and sore than tri
umphant. But it wasn't anything that a large
meal and a little champagne didn't fix. By the
time I said au revoir to Paris. I was infinitely
grateful to the French government for the op
portunity to run, to my own sore legs for car
rying through and to the makers of Advil for
the renewed ability to walk.
Now, where's that block of cheese?
