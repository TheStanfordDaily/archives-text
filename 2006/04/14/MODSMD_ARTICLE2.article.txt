# OREGON STATE 3, STANFORD
## SHUT DOWN Hard-fought pitching duel sees Card fall to No. 11 OSU in first shutout of season 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DUSK EDITOR 
Early on Thursday night in Corvallis, Ore.
Stanford didn't look in too much trouble.
Both Stanford's Greg Reynolds and Oregon
State's Mike Stutes worked quickly through
the first half of the game, and when even they
had rocky innings, they pulled out unscathed.
So that the scoring finally came about in a
bases-loaded, no-outs fashion was a little un
expected. But the end result, a 3-0 loss for
Stanford, its first Pac-10 shutout since 2001,
was almost predictable after a key bottom
of-the-sixth inning. With each team unable to
crack through pitching for most of the night,
it seemed safe to say that whoever scored
first would likely win the game.
With zeros on the board through five-and
a-half, each team seemed to be matched up
well, despite Stanford's (15-12,2-5) position
in the conference and Oregon State's (23-9,
4-3) No. 11 ranking.
"We match up really well," said senior
catcher John Hester, who had one of Stan

ford's four hits of the night. "We matched up
last year really well too. We've played better
against teams that were ranked, earlier, than
against other teams."
Stanford's pitching held up very well,even
given a turbulent sixth inning where the
Beavers scored three runs and sent nine men
to the plate.
Reynolds worked at a quick pace the first
five innings, but the righthander ran into
trouble when he walked OSU's leadoff bats
man. Darwin Barney, batting at .360 heading
into the game, hit a high ball that fell into
shallow left field for a single. With no outs
recorded, cleanup-hitter Cole Gillespie
worked a walk to load the bases.
Bill Rowe drove in the Beaver's first run
— and winning run — with an RBI single to
shortstop. Shea McFeeley tacked on two
more with a single and the threat continued.
Reynolds, however, stayed in the game. One
out and two more runners on base later, it
looked like things were going to explode.
