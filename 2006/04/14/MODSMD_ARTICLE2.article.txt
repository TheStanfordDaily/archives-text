# OREGON STATE 3, STANFORD
## SHUT DOWN Hard-fought pitching duel sees Card fall to No. 11 OSU in first shutout of season 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DUSK EDITOR 
Early on Thursday night in Corvallis, Ore.
Stanford didn't look in too much trouble.
Both Stanford's Greg Reynolds and Oregon
State's Mike Stutes worked quickly through
the first half of the game, and when even they
had rocky innings, they pulled out unscathed.
So that the scoring finally came about in a
bases-loaded, no-outs fashion was a little un
expected. But the end result, a 3-0 loss for
Stanford, its first Pac-10 shutout since 2001,
was almost predictable after a key bottom
of-the-sixth inning. With each team unable to
crack through pitching for most of the night,
it seemed safe to say that whoever scored
first would likely win the game.
With zeros on the board through five-and
a-half, each team seemed to be matched up
well, despite Stanford's (15-12,2-5) position
in the conference and Oregon State's (23-9,
4-3) No. 11 ranking.
"We match up really well," said senior
catcher John Hester, who had one of Stan

ford's four hits of the night. "We matched up
last year really well too. We've played better
against teams that were ranked, earlier, than
against other teams."
Stanford's pitching held up very well,even
given a turbulent sixth inning where the
Beavers scored three runs and sent nine men
to the plate.
Reynolds worked at a quick pace the first
five innings, but the righthander ran into
trouble when he walked OSU's leadoff bats
man. Darwin Barney, batting at .360 heading
into the game, hit a high ball that fell into
shallow left field for a single. With no outs
recorded, cleanup-hitter Cole Gillespie
worked a walk to load the bases.
Bill Rowe drove in the Beaver's first run
— and winning run — with an RBI single to
shortstop. Shea McFeeley tacked on two
more with a single and the threat continued.
Reynolds, however, stayed in the game. One
out and two more runners on base later, it
looked like things were going to explode.

Thus, Reynolds got out of the sixth inning with relatively little
damage. 1 le struck out the next two batters and went on to pitch
seven innings with seven strikeouts and four walks.
Though Reynolds finished the inning with more than 1(X) pitch
es on the night, he outlasted Stutes. Stutes was finally driven out of
the game when he gave up back-to-back walks in the seventh in
ning. but the righty was impressive. He held Stanford scoreless
through 6 and 2/3 innings.
Mark Grbavac came in for the Beavers, but he gave up another
consecutive walk and without even notching a hit. the Cardinal had
their biggest threat of the night: the bases loaded with two outs.
Pinch hitting for junior centerfielder Jim Rappaport, junior Ryan
Seawell had a chance to pull close but he popped up in foul territo
ry, and the Cardinal missed out on their biggest scoring opportuni
ty.
Stanford also put two on in the first inning, taking advantage of
a shaky Stutes, and Oregon native Joey August managed to reach
base for the second time with his first hit of the night in the fourth,
but the Cardinal could not capitalize.
"I was a big fan," August, who lives 30 minutes away,said."l'd al
ways come here and to be here as a player is pretty awesome."
He's not a fan this weekend however, as the Cardinal attempt to
pull themselves out of the bottom half of the Pac-10 conference.
"To win this series definitely puts us back in the mix... right back
in the hunt." August said.
Hester echoed those thoughts, as a struggling Card needs to
make up ground on a season that has been plagued by fielding er
rors and a struggling offense.
"We definitely have to win the series," Hester said. "It doesn't
matter if it's against OSU or UCLA, we need to win to get in the
postseason and we expect to be in the postseason."
The second game of the series is slated for today at 5 p.m. Satur
day also gives August a chance to make something happen in front
of a crowd family and friends, though that might prove a challeng
ing feat. The Beaver's home crowd has seen OSU win 13 of 14 at
Coleman Field.

Thus, Reynolds got out of the sixth inning with relatively little
damage. 1 le struck out the next two batters and went on to pitch
seven innings with seven strikeouts and four walks.
Though Reynolds finished the inning with more than 1(X) pitch
es on the night, he outlasted Stutes. Stutes was finally driven out of
the game when he gave up back-to-back walks in the seventh in
ning. but the righty was impressive. He held Stanford scoreless
through 6 and 2/3 innings.
Mark Grbavac came in for the Beavers, but he gave up another
consecutive walk and without even notching a hit. the Cardinal had
their biggest threat of the night: the bases loaded with two outs.
Pinch hitting for junior centerfielder Jim Rappaport, junior Ryan
Seawell had a chance to pull close but he popped up in foul territo
ry, and the Cardinal missed out on their biggest scoring opportuni
ty.
Stanford also put two on in the first inning, taking advantage of
a shaky Stutes, and Oregon native Joey August managed to reach
base for the second time with his first hit of the night in the fourth,
but the Cardinal could not capitalize.
"I was a big fan," August, who lives 30 minutes away,said."l'd al
ways come here and to be here as a player is pretty awesome."
He's not a fan this weekend however, as the Cardinal attempt to
pull themselves out of the bottom half of the Pac-10 conference.
"To win this series definitely puts us back in the mix... right back
in the hunt." August said.
Hester echoed those thoughts, as a struggling Card needs to
make up ground on a season that has been plagued by fielding er
rors and a struggling offense.
"We definitely have to win the series," Hester said. "It doesn't
matter if it's against OSU or UCLA, we need to win to get in the
postseason and we expect to be in the postseason."
The second game of the series is slated for today at 5 p.m. Satur
day also gives August a chance to make something happen in front
of a crowd family and friends, though that might prove a challeng
ing feat. The Beaver's home crowd has seen OSU win 13 of 14 at
Coleman Field.

Freshman infielder Jason Castro has committed zero errors
at first base this season. Against OSU last night, however,
Stanford committed two.
Early on Thursday night in Corvallis, Ore.
Stanford didn't look in too much trouble.
Both Stanford's Greg Reynolds and Oregon
State's Mike Stutes worked quickly through
the first half of the game, and when even they
had rocky innings, they pulled out unscathed.
So that the scoring finally came about in a
bases-loaded, no-outs fashion was a little un
expected. But the end result, a 3-0 loss for
Stanford, its first Pac-10 shutout since 2001,
was almost predictable after a key bottom
of-the-sixth inning. With each team unable to
crack through pitching for most of the night,
it seemed safe to say that whoever scored
first would likely win the game.
With zeros on the board through five-and
a-half, each team seemed to be matched up
well, despite Stanford's (15-12,2-5) position
in the conference and Oregon State's (23-9,
4-3) No. 11 ranking.
"We match up really well," said senior
catcher John Hester, who had one of Stan

ford's four hits of the night. "We matched up
last year really well too. We've played better
against teams that were ranked, earlier, than
against other teams."
Stanford's pitching held up very well,even
given a turbulent sixth inning where the
Beavers scored three runs and sent nine men
to the plate.
Reynolds worked at a quick pace the first
five innings, but the righthander ran into
trouble when he walked OSU's leadoff bats
man. Darwin Barney, batting at .360 heading
into the game, hit a high ball that fell into
shallow left field for a single. With no outs
recorded, cleanup-hitter Cole Gillespie
worked a walk to load the bases.
Bill Rowe drove in the Beaver's first run
— and winning run — with an RBI single to
shortstop. Shea McFeeley tacked on two
more with a single and the threat continued.
Reynolds, however, stayed in the game. One
out and two more runners on base later, it
looked like things were going to explode.

Senior infielder Chris Lewis leads Stanford with 16 home on the season. He went hitless against OSU last night, the Card only bagged four hits.
