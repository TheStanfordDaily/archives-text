## How to be an IM champion 
### 
It's Wednesday night, and you've
got to make that push get
through the end of the week.
You've probably got a problem set
due, maybe a one page response or a
midterm on Friday. You really
should be getting to work ... but it's
been a hell of a week already. Oh,
screw it! It's time for Senior Dream
Team.
Feeling the need for a midweek
social occasion during winter quar
ter, seniors at Kappa Sigma signed
up for an IM basketball league. A
seemingly good idea for getting to
gether was further improved on by
the addition of Rocket Sauce to the
equation. For those unfamiliar with
this particular ambrosia. Rocket
Sauce is a mix of Gatorade and gin.
It's part Jordan, part Jungle Juice.
After getting "warmed up," the
team is ready to take on the compe
tition. A more imposing group of
physical specimens has never been
seen on the court.
Our starting point guard slices
through defenses like a hot knife
through butter. Two problems arise,
however: 1) The knife is very short,
as Chip "Wee Man" Hankey stands
a deceptive five-and-a-half feet tall
— in shoes. And 2), he's forgotten
that he has to dribble when in pos
session of the ball.
Joining him in the back court is
our shooting star, Alex "D'Brick
ashaw" C'hoo. What he lacks in pure
talent, he makes up for in intimida
tion and intelligence. Don't ask to
see the Nutra-Grain face.
Now for our front court. Andrew
"Ihe Worm" Davis is reminiscent of
his namesake, wiggling iip for the
hard boards just like Dennis Rod
man. While he may lack the body by
Crayola and shrapnel all over, his
trash talk is the finest in the game.
Our power forward is a power
body indeed. Derek "The K is for
Killer" Alley not only announces his
presence with authority, but can do
so in many languages, be they Eng
lish, Drunkese or dog bark. Truly a
team player. Alley is always willing
to take himself out of the game for a
refreshing drink and to give other
players some PT.
Finally, the center post of the un
dergraduate Globetrotters, Matt
"Half-Yao" Henry turns the paint
into a no-fly death zone for layups.
Ok, he may grab them after they've
been through the hoop, but it is a
moral victory for the guy who can't
find his own feet.
As if these fearsome competitors
weren't themselves enough to make
opponents cringe, we come in uni
forms. My high school football coach
used to say if you look sharp, you
play sharp. Obviously, we look sharp
in our matching ski pants, complete
with goggles and beanies. Next
week, we're coming in Hawaiian
shirts, grass skirts, and a roasting pig
on the sideline.
Our coach keeps us in peak phys
ical condition. Pat "Riley is an idiot"
Keelin will not hesitate to pull any
player not performing up to expec
tations. Generally, we found that
running set offenses, playing de
fense, dribbling, passing and shoot
ing from the right side of half court
were too easy for our advanced
skills.
As such, most of our game con
sists of cherry picking and half-court
bombs. Anyone who has a problem
with this should just get off the
court. If by chance you're able to put
together more than four points,
you're immediately benched for
conduct unbecoming of the Dream
Team.
On the season, the team was un
compromised. A perfect O-for-the
season. Not only did we not win a
single game, but we were never with
in 20 points of the victor — at the
end of the first half. But there were
moral victories along the way. Such
as being the only team to finish an
entire ten gallon jug of Rocket
Sauce in under half an hour. I don't
care who you are, that's impressive
for a group of 12 guys.
And if we played you last quarter
and you found yourself a bit frus
trated by our stifling defense,
streamlined offense or noticeable
smell, we don't apologize. Hey, at
least you got a win out of the whole
thing. Just watch out for us next year.
We're poised for a playoff run. Now
if you'll excuse me, I've got to go fill
up my Gatorade bottle.
