## Duke lacrosse team judged early, unfairly Racial tensions in N.C. explode despite DNA clearance 
### MARK KOGAN 
Innocent until proven guilty — a noble ideal
that stands as a cornerstone to the process of crim
inal prosecution in our country, and an ideal that
states that we as a people believe that everyone is
innocent until irrefutable evidence is provided
otherwise.
But apparently, the media and culture of Amer
ica have let this point slip from their minds.
On the evening of Monday, March 13, the Duke
men's varsity lacrosse team partied at the off cam
pus-home of one of the team's members, where a
pair of strippers performed. A few days after the
party, one of the dancers — a 27-year-old African-
American student at nearby North Carolina Cen
tral University — accused three members of the
team of holding her down in a bathroom, beating
her, and raping her.
In the racially tense town of Durham, N.C.,
home to Duke University, the incident exploded.
The team was immediately suspended, DNA
samples were taken from all the white team
members and an investigation was launched to
find out if the stripper's claims held any ground.
But in truth, so much more happened. The
town of Durham had finally found an excuse to
launch their assault on the social disparity found
between themselves and the University. With the
help of the ratings-hungry media, the young men

from Duke were denigrated and vilified. Within
48 hours of the alleged incident, the 47 members
of the Duke lacrosse team were called racists and
rapists, degenerates and criminals — and all
without an ounce of proof.
On April 6, the lacrosse team's head coach re
signed after 16 years and three ACC Champi
onship titles. Hi at same day, the remainder of the
team's season was cancelled, leaving seniors —
who for three years had sweat, suffered and hied
for their team — with no senior season to enjoy.
All of this, still, without an ounce of proof.
Then came the agendas, the race flags, the
social issues. Individuals and organizations
arose to take advantage of these accusations to
push to the forefront their own issues and
problems with the University. All of a sudden,
because 46 of the 47 players on the team were
white and the stripper was black, it became a
race issue, a hate crime. All of a sudden, people
assumed something had happened an that the
team was guilty simply because its members
were of a specific race.
There were protests and marches on both
campuses, ranging from demands that someone
from the team come forward and admit their
"crimes" to outrage as to why nobody had been
arrested yet.
On April 11, the long-awaited DNA tests
came back. All negative. Not a single match from
the team. And still, the blood thirsty mob claimed
wrong-doing and crime. They still claimed rape
and racism.
Do I deny that anything happened the night of

March 13 that deserves punishment? Absolutely
not. But unlike the meidia, I refuse to assume that
there was a crime committed, merely because of
the social or racial status of the accused. And I es
pecially refuse to accept accusations that are com
pletely without evidence.
What it comes down to is the use of the team as
a scapegoat for others to further their own racially
and socially-charged agendas. The fact that 47
young men who had not been proven guilty, and in
fact have had their innocence supported by DNA
evidence, were smeared and vilified has seemingly
fallen by the wayside in the feeding frenzy that this
incident has become.
These 47 men will forever be remembered as
accused rapists, even though only three were ever
accused, and all of them exonerated by DNA evi
dence. These 47 men will lose a season playing the
sport they love along with their coach and the rep
utation of their program — for little reason other
than an accusation that, to this date, has not pro
vided an iota of proof.
lliese young men have been guilty in the eyes
of the media and the community since the day
these accusations were brought to light, and all be
cause of the color of their skin, the income level of
their parents and the university they attend.
The only real criminals here are those that are
willing to sacrifice the reputation of a school, a
community and the lives of 47 innocent young men
merely to further their own agendas.
