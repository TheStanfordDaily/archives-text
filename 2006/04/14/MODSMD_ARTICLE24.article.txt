## The 						money shot for AIDS 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD MANAGING EDITOR 
"Backstage With the Porn Stars" is a
title more likely to be found in a stack of
DVDs in a dorm room instead of the list
of upcoming Stanford events. But
thanks to the ASSU Speaker's Bureau,
Queer/Straight Alliance and LGBT
CRC, two former porn stars wlft be
speaking Saturday in Cubberly Audito
rium at 7:30 p.m. to help raise money to
fight AIDS.
Richard Pacheco and Nina Hartley,
porn stars from the golden age of the in
dustry— widely considered to be 1975
to 1984 — were also in the business

when AIDS first emerged. The two first
teamed up for a similar fundraiser at the
University of Southern California.
Proceeds from the event will benefit
the Tenderloin AIDS Resource Center
in San Francisco, a non-profit that fights
the disease and homelessness in the Ten
derloin district. Organizers say they hope
the event will stimulate open discussion
on campus about sex and sexuality.
There will be information about \
AIDS provided at the door, as well as a
place for attendees to make donations.
Tickets for Stanford students are free,
with ass suggested donation.The gener
al public is asked to give $25, or whatev
er donation possible.
