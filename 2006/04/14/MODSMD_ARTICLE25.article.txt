### TAM VO INTERMISSION GEISHA 
Hey. I've been watching you.
Yes, you. No, not in that creepy
"Every Breath You Take" kind of
way, but in the "Oh no, I don't want
to see that poor puppy get run
over" kind of way. Set a good ex
ample for the ProFros that are
coming next week and heed my
words. Refrain from wearing any
of the following and you'll be
spared some awkward moments.
You want them to come to Stan
ford, don't you?

Double Popped-Collars: Jesus,
they're like the zombies that won't
die in horror flicks. Why won't
they die already? Instead, they
mate and create this phenomenon
that keeps the smug bastards that
keep Abercrombie & Fitch in busi
ness. The real horror? The man
nequins at Baby Gap are sporting
this trend, waiting for you to inflict
it upon your innocent, helpless in
fant— just in time for Easter.
Nothing says "Welcome to the res
urrection of our Lord" like dou
ble-popped collars in pastels.

Crocs: Word on the street is
that Crocs are the new Uggs. Ugly
as sin, but comfortable as hell.
They look like child-friendly, col
orful rain gutters designed by
Playskool for your feet. I'm pretty
sure those holes assist the shoes in
draining water. A testimonial from
the Crocs site goes something like
this: "Crocs like to do everything I
like to do. If only I could marry
them." Creeeeepyyyy.

Sunglasses that EAT YOUR
FACE: Continuing with the zom
bie metaphor — I'm going to as
sume that you either have hickeys
in really bizarre places, or you've
got leprosy. Have you drunkenly

fallen downstairs lately? Did
you stab yourself in the eye
with a mascara wand? Does

your face keep running into
doorknobs? The only

good reason to wear
huge sunglasses that
eat your face is 1) If
you're in the Sahara

Desert and your retinas
will burn otherwise, or 2) If

you've got pinkeye, or 3)
You lost your glass eye.

Leggings: Ankle, thigh, calf
length, whatever — they're
hideous. Tights are not the same
thing as pants! Why ruin a perfect
ly good dress with the presence of
opaque black or colored tights?
It's people like you who keep
Urban Outfitters in business. I've
said it before, and I'll say it again:
Footless leggings are one step
away from stirrup pants. Stirrup
pants with BOWS on the stirrups.
Oh, the horror.
Oversized Jewelry: We're not
playing dress-up anymore, but at
least you can't choke on those
plastic beads this time around. I
can see the police report now:
"Young female strangled by more
bling than Snoop Dogg could
ever wear.'' Fo' shizzle, my neck
is brizzle.
Rabid Furry Boots: Hey.
it's spring! Save yourself a call
| from PETA and chuck them.
4 They're probably about to molt
anyway. Basically, it looks like a
baby seal, marmot, or wombat

was having sex with your foot and
died. Choose your flavor of road
kill, now with dangling furry yo
yos made from chinchillas.

Tailored Vests: Very few people
can pull off this look without re
sembling a monkey that desper
ately needs a pair of cymbals. I
know you want to look bohemian,
but you might as well grab yourself
a Shriner's hat and go-kart and call
it a day.

Gamer Shirts: I know you pwn
nOObs like

hard, but you
won't be

seeing
boobs any
time
soon.
Boom,
head
■ shot!

► ° r
ange
skin: As
a child, I

used to
think this ef
fect was

achieved only by
eating a crapload
of carrots. I was
sadlv mistaken. This

radioactive glow is also

obtained by your soul trying to es
cape from your body, caused by
the flesh-eating powers of Mystic
Tan, numerous bleach bottles, blue

eyeliner, and a
Cosmopolitan.
You might as
well start hitting
on Rico the
Poolboy now,

because you
will die

alone.

Little '
known fact:
Did you
know that

the Pope
wears red
Pra d a
loafers?
