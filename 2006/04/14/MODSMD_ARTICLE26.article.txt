# Ani Di Franco is frankly fantastic

### CALEY ANDERSON INTERMISSION FOLKSTER 
llic word "sale" does not
come to mind when trying to ex
plain Am DiFranco's career
choices. She is one of the most
prolific folk musicians of our
time, releasing over 25 albums —
17 featuring new material —
since 1990. With every new re
lease. she gains new fans and
alienates others. While her style
of singing, guitar playing and
songwriting has evolved over the
past 15 years, what remains con
stant is DiFranco's ability to con
nect with an audience, and her lat
est live release. 'Carnegie Mall
4.6.02" is no different.
I had the good fortune to see
DiFranco during this tour, and 1 was
blown away by the sheer power this
one guitar-plaving woman in dreads
could emit. The sound on
"Carnegie" captures her live pres
ence, making it a worthwhile listen.
Live albums can be problematic;
how do you market them? Diehard
fans will buy them, but how do you
reel in casual listeners, or better yet.
fresh ears? To make the situation
more complicated. DiFranco's
album features a performance that
is four years old: most people have
trouble remembering what they did

last week,
much less
feel drawn

DiFranco has never been one to fol
low the norm or care about what is
easy ~ especially when it comes to
marketing. "Carnegie Hall'' is pow
erful CD; it captures DiFranco's
first performance in New York after
Sept II (she is from Buffalo) and
the setting brings a poignant quality
to her performance.
Not surprisingly, many of the
songs are politically charged, with
titles like "God's Country" and
"Subdivision." but the personal
songs she chose to perform con
tained elements of violence and
tragedy, including tracks like

s "Angry Anymore" and "Not So
s Soft." While DiFranco's banter with
s the audience was. at times, light and
n friendly, she checked her more up
beat and optimistic songs at the
door.
Her performance is not depress
j ing.however. Instead, the moments
Ll of discomfort feel just right. "I've
been noticing things are getting
more beautiful," DiFranco said be
s. fore one of her songs, "the deeper
t the sadness, the deeper the beauty."
e While the statement could seem
i cheesy, it is affect ing.

Trie most pow
erful moment is
not even a song;
it's a poem

iFra n c o
wrote eight
after Sept.
11 called
"Self Hvi
dent." In
interviews
since the

Carnegie show. DiFranco said
that while she was reciting it she
could hear people in the audience
crying, and while that can't be
heard, the intensity translates on
the recording.
"Self Evident" is a transcen
dent eight minutes and 25 seconds
that highlights the DiFranco's tal
ent with words. From the first
fierce and impassioned line, "yes.
ves. YJ;S. us people are just
poems." you cannot help hut lis
ten with baited breath. She
manages to capture the anger
and pain over the event, its
i

causes and the unsatisfying gov
ernment response. Unfortunately,
lines like "get our government to
pull its big click out of the sand / of
someone else's desert /put it back
in its pants / and quit the hypocrit
ical chants of / freedom forever"
are not nostalgic; they are eerily
relevant and it was in this song I
realized the relevance of releasing
an album four years after the con
cert.
"What will it take for my country
to rise / first we admit our mis
takes / then we open our eyes."
Dif ianco sings on another song,
and the message resonates. The
moral struggle, specifically alter
Sept. 11, will not ever disappear or
get easier, and whether or not
people agree with DiFranco'spol
itics. at least she is taking action for
what she believes in. a lesson that
cannot be repealed enough.
It is easy to get caught up in
Dil ranco's polities, but her ability
as a musician and songwriter cannot
be overlooked or praised enough.
She wields her guitar like weapon,
pounding on it and fiercely plucking
the strings, making herself into a
one-woman band. Sadly, she has
ceased touring due to carpel tunnel
from playing the guitar for almost
two decades. Luckily, there are

enough live albums out to
keep her fans at bay
for now.
