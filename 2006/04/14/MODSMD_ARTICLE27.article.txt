### BETSY CONGDON VICTOR FUSTE INTERMISSION EDITORS 
Whv are we at a loss for
words?
Normally, your witty In
termission I Editors would
be chomping at the bit with
any number of humorous
anecdotes or clever obser
vations, but this week we
have hit a writers' block as
big as the U.S.trade deficit.
It might be this weird new
format, it may be that we
have just interviewed a god
amongst mortals (stay
tuned next week to find out
wh0...), but we just cannot
come up anything funny to
write.
'Iliis must be how The
Review feels.
On another note, a mile

stone has been reached litis
week: Roxy Sass lias finally
taken our suggestion and
opened an email account
(roxysass(« ginail.com).
She is there for all your
smarmy comments and pe
titions to her lustful side —
as if she had a non-lustful
side, right? So if you're feel
ing lonely or just plain
horny, email good ol' Roxy
and if you're really persua
sive, she might just respond
to your letter in Intermis
sion...or in bed.
As always Intermission
is looking for your hate
m a i 1
(intermission. daily(" Stan
ford.edu)...or just plain
mail We don't get enough
and we want suggestions.
All this elecion talk has got
tne us thinking. Sometimes
we have trouble connecting

to our base...the Stanford
student body. Want do you
want out of this publica
tion? More Roxy? More
on campus events? Admit
tedly, we don't cover
enough of the on campus
events. Often we feel guilty
about their absence.
Let us know if you have
something cool that you
want publicized (intermis
sion.daily@stanford.edu).
Let us know what gets you
excited.
Ilie man who shows up
gets shot in the face! (Jon
Stewart reference there,
sorry). At Intermission, we
were proud to see our fel
low students protest against
the proposed immigration
bill in the House. We are
also troubled to see that
Iran has claimed to have
the ability to enrich urani

um.
Some people say that we
live in a "Stanford bubble."
We don't think that that is
true. The war in Iran effects
us.. Our generation is dying
over there. Immigration ef
fects us, as so many people
demenstrated in the streets
of major cities around the
country.
So all that we ask is that
you start small. Let us know
iiow we are doing (inter
mission. daily@gmail.com,
shameless plug). Maybe we
will win ASSIJ elections.
We know that none of
this was funny and,so in the
end, we let you down. Like
we said, writers' block...we
guess we spent all of our
creative energy on "Stan
ford Trivia." We're sorry if
you have read this far.
