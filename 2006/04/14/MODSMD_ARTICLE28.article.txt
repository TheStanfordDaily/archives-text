### MERYL HOLT INTERMISSION DEVIL 
"'Hie landscape of his poet
ry was still the desert, the
shifting dunes with the
plumes of white sand blowing
from their peaks. Soft moun
tains. uncompleted journeys,
the impermanence of tents.
How did one map a country
that blew into a new form
every day? It led him to create
chimeras of form, lionheaded
goatbodied serpenttailed im
possibilities whose shapes felt
obliged to change the mo
ment they were set." (Rushdie
382).
Since its publication in
1988, Salman Rushdie's
fourth novel, "The Satanic
Verses," has created quite a

stir. 'Ihe work narrates the misadventures of Gibreel Larishta
and Saladin Chaincha, Indian actors who tumble from the sky
after their jetliner explodes in midair. Ihe lone survivors of the
hijacked aircraft's explosion, Gibreel acquires a halo while Sal
adin's head spouts goat's horns, rendering the former a modern
day archangel CJabriel (hence the name Gibreel) and the later a
fallen-angel Shaitan (or Satan). Rushdie blends past with pres-

cut to examine good and evil in light of
contemporary secular and ancient reli
gious perspective. He constructs a bril
liant critique of migration in Great
Britain, juxtaposing religious belief
with fundamentalist fanaticism.
Stylistically, 'Hie Satanic Verses
brims with poetic flair and vivid ab
straction. Rushdie tailors literary form
to function, creating a whirlwind of
prose that mirrors the tale's chaotic
chain of events. The author intertwines
themes from Islam, Hinduism, and
English literary tradition to produce an
astounding variation on John Milton's
Paradise Lost. Rushdie presents a se
ries of unreliable narrators, blurring
the distinctions between illusion and
reality, politics and religion. Indeed,
the crux of the novel lies in the notion
of transformation as the characters al
ternate between hcavenly-or hellish
and human forms in accordance with

dreams and revelations. 'Ihe novel's embrace of the supernatu
ral also likens it to the magical realism of Spanish novelist
CJabriel Garcia-Marquez.
Regardless of its craft and creativity,'llie Satanic Verses is ac
tually better known for the political and religious turmoil it has
sparked throughout the Muslim world. Although the book won
the Whitbread Novel Award shortly after publication, many

Muslims declared it blasphemous due to its negative portrayal of
the fictional prophet Mahound, interpreted by many as a repre
sentation of Mohammed. 'Ihe name Mahoind has disparaging
connotations as it refers to the satanic version of Mohammed il
lustrated by Christian missionaries in the' \ yth century. Rushdie
suggests that Mahound. the supposed messenger of God, fabri
cates the divine revelations he claims to receive from the Angel
Gabriel.
Rushdie's contentious implications have sparked protests,
riots, and book-burnings by Islamist croups in Pakistan and
India. Furthermore, Iranian leader and dictator Ayatollah
Khomeini issued a Fatwa. sentencing Rushdie to death for "in
sulting Islam, the prophet Mohammed and the holy Koran."
These events had global consequences asthr.-e American book
store chains placed a provisional hold on their stock of the novel.
" r llie book that is worth killing people and burning flags for is
not the book that I wrote," Rushdie told lime Magazine.
Among the novel's more controversial segments is an
episode in which twelve prostitutes assume the identities of the
prophet Mahound's wives for the pleasure cf their clients. Ihis
incident is particularly outrageous because laithful Muslims re
gard the wives of Mohammed as the "mothers of all believers."
While this scene directly conflicts with the tenets of traditional
Islam.it is difficult to discern whether Siittnan Rushdie is mock
ing the prophet or presenting a blistering critique of Islamic cor
ruption. Ultimately. The Satanic Verse* hits awfully close to
home for many living in Muslim nations even if it is unfair to as
sume that Rushdie's satire is representative r>f his personal reli
gious beliefs.
Despite the political, religious, and cultural furor Ihe Satanic

Verses has provoked, the 576

page novel provides its a>
dience with a spell-biiu'

ing read, a paradoxi
cal blend of comedy
and tragedy. Ihe
contradictory na
tures of Rushdie's

mam characters
for instance, the \
evil thoughts of

the angelic ,
Gibreel and >
the naivete v
of the de-

monic Sal
ad in-parody the
irony and painful
hypocrisy of

everyday existence. ]
Although Ihe Sa
tanic Verses strikes a
chord that is disso
nant within the Mus
lim sphere, it is im
possible to repudiate
Rushdie's skill as an

author and the im- V
mense literary value of
his work.
