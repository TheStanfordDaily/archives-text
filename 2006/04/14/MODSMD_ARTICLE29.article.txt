plunge and buv a I)S.

I or those unlamili'ar to " letris," a quick recap. The famous
puzzler lias been in existence lor over 20 It gained lame
and lortune from its inclusion in the original Nintendo Game Boy .The
premise is simple: blocks made of several distiiu i sha|*s drop down onto
the play area. Your task is to manipulate horizontal lines,
which then capse thai line i<> disappear '.'ivingyou more j<>.>m i.> work II k
more lines you eliminate at the same time, the higher your score. And. of
course, the more lines you complete faster the game
speed becomes. Simple, fun and it only gets" better with "Tetris DS."

" letris l)S" focuses on Iwo aspects ol
gaming. Flic first is the renovated Stan
dard' mode that mimics the classic " Ictris"

zle games I've ever played!
where I've truly been dis-J
traded by the other aspects

of the title while trying to keep my lull attcn- !
lion on the puzzle at hand. Puzzle Mode is
capped off with a new ability to hold a piece j
falling on the screen for later use. I 'his allows

players to

feature is the main draw for tins version ol leli is:" free, unlimit
ed wireless play against anyone in the World. If you ever loved "'lctris" but
couldn't find a friend with another copy to play against, then I highly sug-

gest you try this out.
There are several modes
other than the classic mode
