### 
No. 1 UCLA Bruins (33-3,5-1 Pac-10)

vs. Stanford: 3/31 W 5-4,5/12 and 5/13 @ Stanford
Projected Pac-10 finish: 1
Star: senior third baseman Andrea Duran (.347, 41 hits, 25
RBI, 10 homeruns)
The Bruins regained the top spot in the national polls this
week, unseating No. 2 Texas. UCLA has won the NCAA title
10 times, including back-to-back wins in 2003 and 2004.
Last year, the Bruins lost to Michigan in a 10-inning game
three of the Women's College World Series. UCLA beat Stan
ford in their first meeting of the 2006 season, breaking a tie in
the bottom of the seventh inning. So far, only Cal has defeated
the Bruins in conference play.

No. 5 California Golden Bears (35-4,4-1)

vs. Stanford: 4/14 @ Cal, 4/15 @ Stanford
Projected Pac-10 finish: 4
Star: senior pitcher Kristina Thorson (23-2, 239 strikeouts)
The Bears have advanced to the Women's College World Series
for the past seven years in a row. The Cal lineup is far different
from last year, with eight new players joining the roster, but the
Bears have had little trouble so far this season. Their sole con
ference defeat came at the hands of the Bruins, who won 3-1 in
Los Angeles two weeks ago. The Bears and Card will face off in
a three-game series this weekend, playing in Berkeley on Friday
before a Saturday doubleheader at Stanford.

No. 7 Stanford Cardinal (29-7,3-3)

Projected Pac-10 finish: 3
Star: freshman pitcher Missy Penna (1 8-3, 1.7 ERA, 129 strike
outs; 33 hits, 23 RBI, one grand slam)

No. 10 Arizona State Sun Devils (38-5,2-2)

vs. Stanford: 4/22 and 4/23 @ Stanford, 5/5 @ ASU
Projected Pac-10 finish: 7

Senior pitcher Laura Severson has only allowed four walks this
season, while striking out 16.
Star: sophomore pitcher Katie Burkhart
Arizona State, which finished 30-26 last
year, came into the season with mostly
question marks about their new coach and
large incoming class of six transfers and
three freshmen. The changes have not
seemed to trouble ASU, as the team won
1 9 straight to open the season. The Sun
Devils dropped two games last weekend,
losing 7-4 to UCLA and falling 3-1 in an
1 1 -inning battle with Washington.

No. 4 Arizona Wildcats (31-6,2-3)

vs. Stanford: 4/21 @ Stanford, 5/6 and 5/7
@ Arizona
Projected Pac-10 finish: 2
Star: senior pitcher Alicia Hollowell (1 6-2,
0.69 ERA, 220 strikeouts)
Arizona returns many of its key players
from last year — when the team advanced
to their 1 7th Women's College World Se
ries in 1 8 years — including three Ail-
Americans. The Wildcats have not lost to a
team ranked lower than 15 and all but
one of their losses came against teams in
the Top Ten. Injuries have hampered Ari
zona slightly this season. Hollowell and
star outfielder junior Caitlin Lowe were
both injured in a single game in March
and Lowe has not played since. Arizona
has lost two in a row for the first time this
season, dropping both contests against
UCLA last weekend.

No. 8 Oregon State Beavers (29-6,2-4)

vs. Stanford: 4/7 L 3-2,4/29 and 4/30 @ OSU
Projected Pac-10 finish: 5
Star: junior pitcher Brianne McGowan (1 7-
4, 1.4 ERA, 130 strikeouts)
After its best season ever in 2005, OSU is
looking for an eighth straight postseason
berth. The Beavers struggled early on this
season, opening with two straight losses,
but did not lose another game out of con
ference, picking up 27 straight victories.

OSU is currently on a three game losing
streak-after falling to Stanford in Palo Alto
last week, and the Beavers were handed a
pair of 2-0 losses by Cal.

No. 14 Washington Huskies (28-12,2-4)

Projected Pac-10 finish: 6
Projected Pac-10 finish: 5
Star: freshman pitcher Danielle Lawrie (16-
8, 1.48 ERA, 227 strikeouts)
The Huskies, who just missed the postsea
son in 2005, graduated six seniors, but
have seven returning starters along with
seven new players. Although the Huskies
have nearly 30 wins already, they have
struggled against tough competition. On
the season, they are 7-9 against ranked
teams. Nonetheless, Washington bounced
back from a close loss to the Cardinal to
hand them their biggest loss of the season
and become only the third team to shut
Stanford out. Last weekend, the Huskies
split with ASU, winning in 1 1 innings be
fore losing in 1 3 the next day.

Oregon Ducks (18-13,1-3)

Softball Season Statistics

vs. Stanford: 4/8, L 7-3,4/9 W 9-2,4/28
@ Oregon
Projected Pac-10 finish: 8
Star: senior shortstop Breanne Sabol (.356,
32 hits, 26 RBI)
Currently the only unranked team in the
Pac-10, Oregon is still competitive on the
national scene, having gone to their first
Women's College World Series in more
than a decade last year, despite having fin
ished seventh in the league standings. In
spite of their bottom slot in the Pac-10, the
Ducks scored more runs against Stanford
than any other opponent in 2006. Oregon
has suffered more than most teams from
the bad weather this season — three of
their games have been cancelled or sus
pended so far.

vs. Stanford: 4/14 @ Cal, 4/15 @ Stanford
Projected Pac-10 finish: 4
Star: senior pitcher Kristina Thorson (23-2, 239 strikeouts)
The Bears have advanced to the Women's College World Series
for the past seven years in a row. The Cal lineup is far different
from last year, with eight new players joining the roster, but the
Bears have had little trouble so far this season. Their sole con
ference defeat came at the hands of the Bruins, who won 3-1 in
Los Angeles two weeks ago. The Bears and Card will face off in
a three-game series this weekend, playing in Berkeley on Friday
before a Saturday doubleheader at Stanford.

No. 7 Stanford Cardinal (29-7,3-3)

Projected Pac-10 finish: 3
Star: freshman pitcher Missy Penna (1 8-3, 1.7 ERA, 129 strike
outs; 33 hits, 23 RBI, one grand slam)

No. 10 Arizona State Sun Devils (38-5,2-2)

vs. Stanford: 4/22 and 4/23 @ Stanford, 5/5 @ ASU
Projected Pac-10 finish: 7

Senior pitcher Laura Severson has only allowed four walks this
season, while striking out 16.
Star: sophomore pitcher Katie Burkhart
Arizona State, which finished 30-26 last
year, came into the season with mostly
question marks about their new coach and
large incoming class of six transfers and
three freshmen. The changes have not
seemed to trouble ASU, as the team won
1 9 straight to open the season. The Sun
Devils dropped two games last weekend,
losing 7-4 to UCLA and falling 3-1 in an
1 1 -inning battle with Washington.

No. 4 Arizona Wildcats (31-6,2-3)

vs. Stanford: 4/21 @ Stanford, 5/6 and 5/7
@ Arizona
Projected Pac-10 finish: 2
Star: senior pitcher Alicia Hollowell (1 6-2,
0.69 ERA, 220 strikeouts)
Arizona returns many of its key players
from last year — when the team advanced
to their 1 7th Women's College World Se
ries in 1 8 years — including three Ail-
Americans. The Wildcats have not lost to a
team ranked lower than 15 and all but
one of their losses came against teams in
the Top Ten. Injuries have hampered Ari
zona slightly this season. Hollowell and
star outfielder junior Caitlin Lowe were
both injured in a single game in March
and Lowe has not played since. Arizona
has lost two in a row for the first time this
season, dropping both contests against
UCLA last weekend.

No. 8 Oregon State Beavers (29-6,2-4)

vs. Stanford: 4/7 L 3-2,4/29 and 4/30 @ OSU
Projected Pac-10 finish: 5
Star: junior pitcher Brianne McGowan (1 7-
4, 1.4 ERA, 130 strikeouts)
After its best season ever in 2005, OSU is
looking for an eighth straight postseason
berth. The Beavers struggled early on this
season, opening with two straight losses,
but did not lose another game out of con
ference, picking up 27 straight victories.

OSU is currently on a three game losing
streak-after falling to Stanford in Palo Alto
last week, and the Beavers were handed a
pair of 2-0 losses by Cal.

No. 14 Washington Huskies (28-12,2-4)

Projected Pac-10 finish: 6
Projected Pac-10 finish: 5
Star: freshman pitcher Danielle Lawrie (16-
8, 1.48 ERA, 227 strikeouts)
The Huskies, who just missed the postsea
son in 2005, graduated six seniors, but
have seven returning starters along with
seven new players. Although the Huskies
have nearly 30 wins already, they have
struggled against tough competition. On
the season, they are 7-9 against ranked
teams. Nonetheless, Washington bounced
back from a close loss to the Cardinal to
hand them their biggest loss of the season
and become only the third team to shut
Stanford out. Last weekend, the Huskies
split with ASU, winning in 1 1 innings be
fore losing in 1 3 the next day.

Oregon Ducks (18-13,1-3)

Softball Season Statistics

vs. Stanford: 4/8, L 7-3,4/9 W 9-2,4/28
@ Oregon
Projected Pac-10 finish: 8
Star: senior shortstop Breanne Sabol (.356,
32 hits, 26 RBI)
Currently the only unranked team in the
Pac-10, Oregon is still competitive on the
national scene, having gone to their first
Women's College World Series in more
than a decade last year, despite having fin
ished seventh in the league standings. In
spite of their bottom slot in the Pac-10, the
Ducks scored more runs against Stanford
than any other opponent in 2006. Oregon
has suffered more than most teams from
the bad weather this season — three of
their games have been cancelled or sus
pended so far.

Projected Pac-10 finish: 1
Star: senior third baseman Andrea Duran (.347, 41 hits, 25
RBI, 10 homeruns)
The Bruins regained the top spot in the national polls this
week, unseating No. 2 Texas. UCLA has won the NCAA title
10 times, including back-to-back wins in 2003 and 2004.
Last year, the Bruins lost to Michigan in a 10-inning game
three of the Women's College World Series. UCLA beat Stan
ford in their first meeting of the 2006 season, breaking a tie in
the bottom of the seventh inning. So far, only Cal has defeated
the Bruins in conference play.
