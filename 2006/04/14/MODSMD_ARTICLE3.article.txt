No. 1 UCLA Bruins (33-3,5-1 Pac-10)

vs. Stanford: 3/31 W 5-4,5/12 and 5/13 @ Stanford
Projected Pac-10 finish: 1
Star: senior third baseman Andrea Duran (.347, 41 hits, 25
RBI, 10 homeruns)
The Bruins regained the top spot in the national polls this
week, unseating No. 2 Texas. UCLA has won the NCAA title
10 times, including back-to-back wins in 2003 and 2004.
Last year, the Bruins lost to Michigan in a 10-inning game
three of the Women's College World Series. UCLA beat Stan
ford in their first meeting of the 2006 season, breaking a tie in
the bottom of the seventh inning. So far, only Cal has defeated
the Bruins in conference play.

No. 5 California Golden Bears (35-4,4-1)

vs. Stanford: 4/14 @ Cal, 4/15 @ Stanford
Projected Pac-10 finish: 4
Star: senior pitcher Kristina Thorson (23-2, 239 strikeouts)
The Bears have advanced to the Women's College World Series
for the past seven years in a row. The Cal lineup is far different
from last year, with eight new players joining the roster, but the
Bears have had little trouble so far this season. Their sole con
ference defeat came at the hands of the Bruins, who won 3-1 in
Los Angeles two weeks ago. The Bears and Card will face off in
a three-game series this weekend, playing in Berkeley on Friday
before a Saturday doubleheader at Stanford.

No. 7 Stanford Cardinal (29-7,3-3)

Projected Pac-10 finish: 3
Star: freshman pitcher Missy Penna (1 8-3, 1.7 ERA, 129 strike
outs; 33 hits, 23 RBI, one grand slam)

No. 10 Arizona State Sun Devils (38-5,2-2)

vs. Stanford: 4/22 and 4/23 @ Stanford, 5/5 @ ASU
Projected Pac-10 finish: 7
