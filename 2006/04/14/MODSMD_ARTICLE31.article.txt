INTERMISSION SEX GODDESS

I was confident that I had the
best stories of lust and debauchery
when it came time to spili all with
old high school friends over Spring
Break. I've got all the usual stuff:
uncomfortable contortions in the
backseat of a car, a romantic ren
dezvous in a dark Parisian alley, and
a serendipitous quickie in an eleva
tor (a generous 42 story continuous
drop; approximately 1 minute and 7
seconds. Admittedly, climax was not
reached in this window, however as
Speed Fuckers of the world know,
practice makes perfect. Hint: lack of
undergarments to begin with will
significantly decrease transition
time. Did I mention I was also a
triathlete at one point?).
Scandalous secrets in your par
ents' bed is a given for anyone who
claims to be a Sexpert; my standards
even require some dirty use of
Mother's Best Chocolate Mousse
on her very own kitchen floor.
Heck, I've violated every set of
linens on my dad's side of the fami
ly (those belonging to Ist wives and
distant European uncles included).
A quick jaunt in those large handi
capped showers on the first floor,
and I've got just about all my bases
covered. Literally and figuratively.
Since high school, this repertoire
had secured my reign as the Queen
of the Kinky. But lately, however,
I've been slipping in the charts. My
challenger? None other than a
Berkeley co-op girl. I should have
known. The last time my friend —
let's call her Ivanna — invited me
there, the walls and floor were cov
ered in black plastic in preparation
for a chocolate wrestling party. I
spent the evening happily rubbing
ll up against slippery half naked bod

ies in a pit of Hershey's syrup
(Imagine Exotic Erotic with a little
chocolate lubrication — then make
the dancing horizontal instead of
vertical). Tlie place reeks of sex.
Even after the group showers.
I've worked tirelessly to keep my
title but this must be one of those
situations where the deck is stacked
against me. Ivanna is currently en
rolled in a class about Female Sexu
ality (FemSex, she calls it ever so ca
sually with a taste of Stanfordian
that warms my heart.) Last semes
ter was Man Sex. Whatever hap
pened to Human Sexuality here at
Stanford, by the way? It was one of
the reasons I came to Stanford, and
I'm sure many a fuzzy was as excit
ed as me to fulfill the science re
quirement with such an appealing
subject. Ivanna gets to spend at
least 3 hours a week learning about
sex, in lecture and an intimate
group discussion section. And my
idea of a sexually charged room was
freshman hormones raging around
IHUM section.
Perhaps you see where this is
headed (if you're picturing the class
having a full on orgy as their final,
then maybe you need to tame your
imagination just a little bit. Sure
Berkeley's crazy and full of free
love hippies, but man, it's not the
70s anymore.) The TAs actually in
state a strict policy against Class
cest signed by each participant in
the name of keeping the classroom
a safe and comfortable environ
ment.
When Ivanna heard a co-op
mate's vivid and colorful comments
in class, she couldn't help being in
trigued. As the two found out more
about each other in and out of class,
their attraction simmered just
below the breaking point. A sad
story of star crossed lovers, this is
not. Over a period of several weeks,

they began to experiment casual
ly. In one class, it came out in
class that our young lover —
let's call him Romeo — was bi-

sexual. In another, Ivanna,
beaming with feminist pride,
brought in a picture painted
with her menstrual

blood.
The following week, Romeo
shared how he makes a living. In
order to fund his burgeoning The
atre career, he sought employment
on craigslist. But we're not talking
about employment, we're talking
about "employment". When Ivanna
told me the story, she winced a little
when she said "I'm hooking up with
a male prostitute." Boy, that certain
ly put me down a notch on our hier
archy of prude to risqud. As it turns
out, you can make a fortune being a
male prostitute. Our little Romeo
had almost a hundred responses to
his ad on craigslist in less than 15
minutes. From what I hear, closeted
Silicon Valley geniuses will pay
quite handsomely a secret en
counter.
If Penis Envy is a true phenome
non, then what I felt was a twisted
version of it: Even wages in the sex
trade favor men over women!
Clearly, this is an issue the national
feminist movement should be ad
dressing. (I can see the headline
now: "Global Fund for Women
Lobbies Washington for Equal Pay
for Female Sex Workers.)
Speaking of envy, apparently
Romeo has honed his professional
talents and has a mean foreplay
routine, which is all Ivanna can in
dulge in without straight-up disre
garding the class contract.
But when the semester ends, the
pledge of classmate abstinence ex
pires, and all bets are off. Summer
will be here and Ivanna will be off
frolicking around naked in her co
op with a bisexual male who is paid
for his ability to please. I'll need the
help of a willing manwhore to catch
up to that. Help Roxy get her Sass
