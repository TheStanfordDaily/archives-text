## Card look to cool No.5 Cal Offensive stability will be key in doubleheader 
### ANDREW LOMELI STAFF WRITER 
After seeing last Wednesday's game
against Sacramento State cancelled due to
rain, the No. 6 Stanford softhall team looks
to make a statement in the competitive Pac
-10 this weekend with three games against
No. 5 California.
Stanford (29-7, 3-3 Pac-10) travels to
Berkeley on Friday for an afternoon meet
ing before hosting the Golden Bears (35-4,
4-1 Pac-10) for a douhleheader Saturday at 1
p.m.
The Bears defeated No. 8 Oregon State
twice last weekend while their scheduled
match with Oregon was postponed. The
combination of sound pitching and powerful
hitting propelled Cal to two 2-0 victories.
Freshman Gina Leommiti collected a
round-tripper and junior Alex Sutton
notched a single for an RBI to edge the vis
iting Beavers in the series opener. Senior
Kristina Thorson prevented any Beaver
threat late in the game, striking out three in
the sixth and two in the seventh.
The second game of the series remained
scoreless until the bottom of the seventh,
when Sutton knocked a walk-off homer for
Cal's third hit of the day. Sutton finished 2-
for-3, while Thorson struck out 13 and
walked none in seven complete innings. The
Bears' other Pac-10 victories came against
No. 14 Washington and top-ranked UCLA.
Senior infielder Haley Woods leads Cal
in hitting with a .410 average, 28 runs and
44 RBI. Thorson has impressed in the cir
cle, nabbing a 0.79 ERA and a 25-3 record.
Last season saw the Cardinal take two of
three from the Bears, by margins of 6-4,2-
1 and 0-1.
The Cardinal enter the weekend after
having upset the Beavers and splitting a two
game series with the Ducks — the only un
ranked Pac-10 team — last week. And after
spending the previous week taking only one
win from Washington during a road trip to
Seattle and UCLA, Stanford is looking to

stabilize its rccent inconsistency in the win
loss column.
So far, the most stability has come from
the bat of senior outfielder Catalina Morris,
who leads the offense with a .395 average,27
runs, 27 RBI and six home runs. Junior out
fielder Jackie Rinehart and freshman in
fielder Maddy Coon follow closely with .371
and .364 averages, respectively. In her first
collegiate season, Coon leads the team with
nine homers.
The Cardinal's only other freshman —
Missy Penna — has made her contributions
on the mound, compiling a 1.70 ERA and a
team-leading 18-3 record in 136 innings so
far this season. Sophomore Becky McCol
lough has earned a 1.64 ERA en route to a -
4 record, while senior Laura Severson's 2.33
ERA has led to a 4-0 record.
"There's nothing we can really do about
our past games," Henna said. "We've learned
that the Pac-10 is really intense, and all we
can do now is try to learn from our mistakes
to peak at the right time."
