## ASSU election jeopardized by emails sent by Rillera/Nguyen 
### AMIT ARORA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Yesterday, at 2:53 p.m., an unsolicited email was sent by ASSU
presidential candidate Marc Rillera, a junior, to approximately 300
students in violation of campaign policies. In the email, Rillera en
couraged students to vote and described how his slate could best
serve the student body.
"Please consider the Rillera/Nguyen slate when voting for
ASSU Executive," Rillera wrote in the message. "Chris and I are
committed to short-term and long-term goals that will address un
dergraduate and graduate student needs and concerns. Hopefully
we will have the honor of serving each one of you!"
ASSU election policy explicitly forbids campaigning during the
voting period, and the Rillera/Nguyen slate's campaign emails sent
to hundreds of students yesterday may compromise the validity of
this year's ASSU election. Currently described on the ASSU Elec
tions Web Site, the University's campaign policy states that "Cam
paign Week begins on Wednesday, April 5,2006 at 12:01 a.m. and
ends when voting begins on Wednesday, April 12, 2006 at 12:01
a.m." It authorizes the use of campaign emails during this period
but not after voting begins.
Sent during this prohibited period, the email violates ASSU
Election policy, according to the rules expressed on the site. In an
interview with The Daily, ASSU Elections Commissioner and law
student Tim Sanders described the policy in question.
"In our campaign policy meeting in March, we decided that it
was all right to use email lists during campaign week," Sanders said.
"Using email lists during the voting days, however, was prohibited."
Although Sanders was hesitant to use the term "illegal cam
paigning," he did recognize that an infraction had occurred.
"I found that there was a violation of policy in terms of cam
paigning," he said.
Additionally.critics of the Rillera/Nguyen slate have questioned
how Rillera obtained the addresses on the particular email list that
was used. In the 2006 University Campaign Policies, it explicitly
states that "campaign emails sent to email lists or news groups are
allowed by University policy as long as they fall within the original
purpose of that list" and that "emails can only be sent to lists to
which any member may post."
The emails involve students interested in serving as house hosts,
or HoHos, during the upcoming Admit Weekend. Rillera, as Admit
Weekend Coordinator, obtained the email addresses of 300 stu
dents interested in serving as hosts and sent an unsolicited cam
paign email to these individuals. The list that Rillera obtained
emails from was not created for election purposes, and all students
do not have the ability to distribute emails through the list.
In an attempt to resolve the situation, Sanders sought a compro
mise between the two slates.
"I sat down with Rillera and Nguyen," he said."My first goal was
to come up with an understanding of what was going on and then to
establish a compromise between the two slates that would be fair
and, frankly, would avoid the controversy. Neither side presented
me with a proposal that would be workable, however. So I ended up
proposing a plan that would minimize the negative impact on the
Heng/Graham slate because of these emails."
First, Sanders determined which students were involved.
Rillera. during the voting period, actually sent 1,500 emails. Sanders
concluded from the information provided that 1,200 were person
al, sent to Facebook friends of the candidate. He then required the
Rillera/Nguyen slate to send an email to the other 3(H) students.
