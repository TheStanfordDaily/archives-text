## ASSU election jeopardized by emails sent by Rillera/Nguyen 
### AMIT ARORA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Yesterday, at 2:53 p.m., an unsolicited email was sent by ASSU
presidential candidate Marc Rillera, a junior, to approximately 300
students in violation of campaign policies. In the email, Rillera en
couraged students to vote and described how his slate could best
serve the student body.
"Please consider the Rillera/Nguyen slate when voting for
ASSU Executive," Rillera wrote in the message. "Chris and I are
committed to short-term and long-term goals that will address un
dergraduate and graduate student needs and concerns. Hopefully
we will have the honor of serving each one of you!"
ASSU election policy explicitly forbids campaigning during the
voting period, and the Rillera/Nguyen slate's campaign emails sent
to hundreds of students yesterday may compromise the validity of
this year's ASSU election. Currently described on the ASSU Elec
tions Web Site, the University's campaign policy states that "Cam
paign Week begins on Wednesday, April 5,2006 at 12:01 a.m. and
ends when voting begins on Wednesday, April 12, 2006 at 12:01
a.m." It authorizes the use of campaign emails during this period
but not after voting begins.
Sent during this prohibited period, the email violates ASSU
Election policy, according to the rules expressed on the site. In an
interview with The Daily, ASSU Elections Commissioner and law
student Tim Sanders described the policy in question.
"In our campaign policy meeting in March, we decided that it
was all right to use email lists during campaign week," Sanders said.
"Using email lists during the voting days, however, was prohibited."
Although Sanders was hesitant to use the term "illegal cam
paigning," he did recognize that an infraction had occurred.
"I found that there was a violation of policy in terms of cam
paigning," he said.
Additionally.critics of the Rillera/Nguyen slate have questioned
how Rillera obtained the addresses on the particular email list that
was used. In the 2006 University Campaign Policies, it explicitly
states that "campaign emails sent to email lists or news groups are
allowed by University policy as long as they fall within the original
purpose of that list" and that "emails can only be sent to lists to
which any member may post."
The emails involve students interested in serving as house hosts,
or HoHos, during the upcoming Admit Weekend. Rillera, as Admit
Weekend Coordinator, obtained the email addresses of 300 stu
dents interested in serving as hosts and sent an unsolicited cam
paign email to these individuals. The list that Rillera obtained
emails from was not created for election purposes, and all students
do not have the ability to distribute emails through the list.
In an attempt to resolve the situation, Sanders sought a compro
mise between the two slates.
"I sat down with Rillera and Nguyen," he said."My first goal was
to come up with an understanding of what was going on and then to
establish a compromise between the two slates that would be fair
and, frankly, would avoid the controversy. Neither side presented
me with a proposal that would be workable, however. So I ended up
proposing a plan that would minimize the negative impact on the
Heng/Graham slate because of these emails."
First, Sanders determined which students were involved.
Rillera. during the voting period, actually sent 1,500 emails. Sanders
concluded from the information provided that 1,200 were person
al, sent to Facebook friends of the candidate. He then required the
Rillera/Nguyen slate to send an email to the other 3(H) students.
providing them with an opportunity
to retract their vote.
In this email, Rillera does not ex
plicitly apologize for the violation of
campaign policies.
"Due to a misunderstanding,
emails were sent out at 2:53 p.m. to
some people who may not have been
expecting to receive an email about
the ASSU election," Rillera wrote.
"I apologize for the erroneous inclu
sion of these people. These people
should not have received the
emails."
The Rillera/Nguyen slate has
even questioned the constitutional
ity of these election regulations. In
an email to The Daily, vice presiden
tial candidate Chris Nguyen, a jun
ior, justified his running mate's ac
tions.
"These email policies set by the
ASSU Elections Commission have
previously been ruled unconstitu
tional by the ASSU Constitutional
Council in Mefford vs. 6th Under
graduate Senate (2(X)5), Mefford v.
sth Undergraduate Senate (2004)
and Hartke v. Young (aka Elections
Rules and Free Speech. Case 5 in
20(H))," Nguyen wrote. "Emails are
protected by the freedom of speech
requirements Article 1, Section 3.2 of
the ASSU Constitution, according to
the Constitutional Council, which
has always taken a broad interpreta
tion that exceeds even that of the U.S.
Supreme Court."
Nguyen was even more explicit in
his criticism of the current policies,
citing the previous administration's
refusals to abide by these voting pro
cedures.
"This year's Elections Commis
sion is attempting to enforce an un
constitutional policy," he wrote.
"Last year's Elections Commission
did not attempt to enforce this poli
cy because they understood the
Constitutional Council had ruled
email restrictions unconstitutional.
The policies have made it more diffi
cult to campaign. These email re

strictions simply result in higher
campaign spending as people con
tinue the arms race of fliers, signs
and other material."
Though Nguyen disagrees with
the election policies, he is familiar
with the election rules as well as the
ASSU Constitutional Council. He
served on the ASSU committee that
monitored elections and was pres
ent at the March meeting where
election rules were discussed.
Rillera was not available for com
ment on this issue.
Presidential candidate Elizabeth
Heng and vice presidential candidate
Lauren Graham, both juniors, of the
Heng with Graham slate said they
found the compromise on this issue
unsatisfactory. They added that de
spite time constraints, a proper deci
sion was not reached regarding the
Rillera/Nguyen slate's violations of
campaign policies.
"I am not happy with the compro
mise," Graham said. "I'm fine with
the retracting of emails, but if there
are no punitive damages, then I am
not happy with it. I was not even
given a timeframe to think of a fair
proposal."
Graham also described the slate's
restricted ability to contribute to a so
lution.
"Sanders first said that there was
going to be a compromise," she said.
"He said that we would have the op
portunity to introduce a compromise.
Then that offer was removed from
the table within half an hour. Sanders
expressed to me that his only con
cerns were the image or reputation of
the ASSU and that the elections were
viewed as fair."
Sanders described the factors in
fluencing his decision, but stressed
that he asked the candidates for their
input.
"1 did speak with Elizabeth and
Lauren, and they expressed to me
that they thought the policies were
unfair," he said. "They never provid
ed me with alternatives though. I

made it clear to them that I needed
something in 15 minutes. After half
an hour, 1 decided to work with Marc
and Chris on the email."
Recent graduate Mikey Lee, a
consultant to the Heng with Graham
campaign as well as a former ASSU
executive slate candidate, was critical
of Sanders' response to the viola-!
tions.
"He is obtaining opinions from
two slates," Lee said. "One of these
slates violated campaign rules and
one is innocent, played by the rules,
campaigned hard and used fair and
legal means to campaign to the stu
dents. All of this has led to a rash
decision. This rashness clearly;
points to the need to preserve the
image of the fairness of the election
process."
Ultimately, the Heng with Gra
ham slate has called into question the
nature of this compromise and thej
campaign infractions of tho
Rillera/Nguyen slate.
"We feel that the best and most
honorable solution at this time is for
the elections commission to disquali
fy the Rillera/Nguyen slate," Graham
said. "Elizabeth and I are confident
that we have run a strong, clean cam-*
paign that was focused on reaching
out to the voters. We feel we are the'
strongest candidates and more im-Â«
portantly, the most-qualified. What
we are trying to point out in this situ l -.':
ation are the principles of good faith
and fairness that were clearly not re
spected."
Controversy over the campaign
violations and the subsequent com
promise may threaten the results of
the current election. Sanders also
noted that punitive damages may be
awarded, yet he himself lacked
power to do so.
"My responsibility was to main
tain a fair election," he said."ln terms
of punitive measures, it is up to the
ASSU Senate or the University to
determine the proper course of ac
tion in terms of punishment."

refusals to abide by these voting pro
cedures.
"This year's Elections Commis
sion is attempting to enforce an un
constitutional policy," he wrote.
"Last year's Elections Commission
did not attempt to enforce this poli
cy because they understood the
Constitutional Council had ruled
email restrictions unconstitutional.
The policies have made it more diffi
cult to campaign. These email re

strictions simply result in higher
campaign spending as people con
tinue the arms race of fliers, signs
and other material."
Though Nguyen disagrees with
the election policies, he is familiar
with the election rules as well as the
ASSU Constitutional Council. He
served on the ASSU committee that
monitored elections and was pres
ent at the March meeting where
election rules were discussed.
Rillera was not available for com
ment on this issue.
Presidential candidate Elizabeth
Heng and vice presidential candidate
Lauren Graham, both juniors, of the
Heng with Graham slate said they
found the compromise on this issue
unsatisfactory. They added that de
spite time constraints, a proper deci
sion was not reached regarding the
Rillera/Nguyen slate's violations of
campaign policies.
"I am not happy with the compro
mise," Graham said. "I'm fine with
the retracting of emails, but if there
are no punitive damages, then I am
not happy with it. I was not even
given a timeframe to think of a fair
proposal."
Graham also described the slate's
restricted ability to contribute to a so
lution.
"Sanders first said that there was
going to be a compromise," she said.
"He said that we would have the op
portunity to introduce a compromise.
Then that offer was removed from
the table within half an hour. Sanders
expressed to me that his only con
cerns were the image or reputation of
the ASSU and that the elections were
viewed as fair."
Sanders described the factors in
fluencing his decision, but stressed
that he asked the candidates for their
input.
"1 did speak with Elizabeth and
Lauren, and they expressed to me
that they thought the policies were
unfair," he said. "They never provid
ed me with alternatives though. I

made it clear to them that I needed
something in 15 minutes. After half
an hour, 1 decided to work with Marc
and Chris on the email."
Recent graduate Mikey Lee, a
consultant to the Heng with Graham
campaign as well as a former ASSU
executive slate candidate, was critical
of Sanders' response to the viola-!
tions.
"He is obtaining opinions from
two slates," Lee said. "One of these
slates violated campaign rules and
one is innocent, played by the rules,
campaigned hard and used fair and
legal means to campaign to the stu
dents. All of this has led to a rash
decision. This rashness clearly;
points to the need to preserve the
image of the fairness of the election
process."
Ultimately, the Heng with Gra
ham slate has called into question the
nature of this compromise and thej
campaign infractions of tho
Rillera/Nguyen slate.
"We feel that the best and most
honorable solution at this time is for
the elections commission to disquali
fy the Rillera/Nguyen slate," Graham
said. "Elizabeth and I are confident
that we have run a strong, clean cam-*
paign that was focused on reaching
out to the voters. We feel we are the'
strongest candidates and more im-Â«
portantly, the most-qualified. What
we are trying to point out in this situ l -.':
ation are the principles of good faith
and fairness that were clearly not re
spected."
Controversy over the campaign
violations and the subsequent com
promise may threaten the results of
the current election. Sanders also
noted that punitive damages may be
awarded, yet he himself lacked
power to do so.
"My responsibility was to main
tain a fair election," he said."ln terms
of punitive measures, it is up to the
ASSU Senate or the University to
determine the proper course of ac
tion in terms of punishment."
Yesterday, at 2:53 p.m., an unsolicited email was sent by ASSU
presidential candidate Marc Rillera, a junior, to approximately 300
students in violation of campaign policies. In the email, Rillera en
couraged students to vote and described how his slate could best
serve the student body.
"Please consider the Rillera/Nguyen slate when voting for
ASSU Executive," Rillera wrote in the message. "Chris and I are
committed to short-term and long-term goals that will address un
dergraduate and graduate student needs and concerns. Hopefully
we will have the honor of serving each one of you!"
ASSU election policy explicitly forbids campaigning during the
voting period, and the Rillera/Nguyen slate's campaign emails sent
to hundreds of students yesterday may compromise the validity of
this year's ASSU election. Currently described on the ASSU Elec
tions Web Site, the University's campaign policy states that "Cam
paign Week begins on Wednesday, April 5,2006 at 12:01 a.m. and
ends when voting begins on Wednesday, April 12, 2006 at 12:01
a.m." It authorizes the use of campaign emails during this period
but not after voting begins.
Sent during this prohibited period, the email violates ASSU
Election policy, according to the rules expressed on the site. In an
interview with The Daily, ASSU Elections Commissioner and law
student Tim Sanders described the policy in question.
"In our campaign policy meeting in March, we decided that it
was all right to use email lists during campaign week," Sanders said.
"Using email lists during the voting days, however, was prohibited."
Although Sanders was hesitant to use the term "illegal cam
paigning," he did recognize that an infraction had occurred.
"I found that there was a violation of policy in terms of cam
paigning," he said.
Additionally.critics of the Rillera/Nguyen slate have questioned
how Rillera obtained the addresses on the particular email list that
was used. In the 2006 University Campaign Policies, it explicitly
states that "campaign emails sent to email lists or news groups are
allowed by University policy as long as they fall within the original
purpose of that list" and that "emails can only be sent to lists to
which any member may post."
The emails involve students interested in serving as house hosts,
or HoHos, during the upcoming Admit Weekend. Rillera, as Admit
Weekend Coordinator, obtained the email addresses of 300 stu
dents interested in serving as hosts and sent an unsolicited cam
paign email to these individuals. The list that Rillera obtained
emails from was not created for election purposes, and all students
do not have the ability to distribute emails through the list.
In an attempt to resolve the situation, Sanders sought a compro
mise between the two slates.
"I sat down with Rillera and Nguyen," he said."My first goal was
to come up with an understanding of what was going on and then to
establish a compromise between the two slates that would be fair
and, frankly, would avoid the controversy. Neither side presented
me with a proposal that would be workable, however. So I ended up
proposing a plan that would minimize the negative impact on the
Heng/Graham slate because of these emails."
First, Sanders determined which students were involved.
Rillera. during the voting period, actually sent 1,500 emails. Sanders
concluded from the information provided that 1,200 were person
al, sent to Facebook friends of the candidate. He then required the
Rillera/Nguyen slate to send an email to the other 3(H) students.
providing them with an opportunity
to retract their vote.
In this email, Rillera does not ex
plicitly apologize for the violation of
campaign policies.
"Due to a misunderstanding,
emails were sent out at 2:53 p.m. to
some people who may not have been
expecting to receive an email about
the ASSU election," Rillera wrote.
"I apologize for the erroneous inclu
sion of these people. These people
should not have received the
emails."
The Rillera/Nguyen slate has
even questioned the constitutional
ity of these election regulations. In
an email to The Daily, vice presiden
tial candidate Chris Nguyen, a jun
ior, justified his running mate's ac
tions.
"These email policies set by the
ASSU Elections Commission have
previously been ruled unconstitu
tional by the ASSU Constitutional
Council in Mefford vs. 6th Under
graduate Senate (2(X)5), Mefford v.
sth Undergraduate Senate (2004)
and Hartke v. Young (aka Elections
Rules and Free Speech. Case 5 in
20(H))," Nguyen wrote. "Emails are
protected by the freedom of speech
requirements Article 1, Section 3.2 of
the ASSU Constitution, according to
the Constitutional Council, which
has always taken a broad interpreta
tion that exceeds even that of the U.S.
Supreme Court."
Nguyen was even more explicit in
his criticism of the current policies,
citing the previous administration's
refusals to abide by these voting pro
cedures.
"This year's Elections Commis
sion is attempting to enforce an un
