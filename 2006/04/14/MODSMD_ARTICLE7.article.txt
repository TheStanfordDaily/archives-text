# Band marches into public criticism
## Alumnus expresses desire for a more serious, traditional marching band 
### ANDREA FULLER STAFF WRITER 
From Christian mockery at Notre Dame to paro
dies of polygamy at Brigham Young University, the
Stanford Band's list of outrages grows every year. It
was a first, however, that a public complaint was filed
by alumnus Eugene Danaher through the San Fran
cisco Chronicle to get rid of the Band once and for all.
Danaher has written letters to President John
Hennessy, the Alumni Association and Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Greg Boardman protesting that the
Band's sense of humor and wild antics sometimes go
too far. His notion of an ideal band follows more tra
ditional lines, like that of the University of Michigan
at Ann Arbor.
"They have clean uniforms and snappy routines,"

Danaher said. "There are plenty of examples of
bands that could be used as models that could bring
the Stanford band back into the fraternity of good
bands."
Boardman said that Danaher is not alone in his
criticism. Other alumni have also expressed disap
proval about the Band's conduct.
"The anti-Band letters outweigh the pro-Band let
ters,"he said. "However, I must admit that I don't get
very many letters on this topic. When I do get letters,
they tend to arrive soon after an event, like the BYU
game."
The University has no plans to fulfill Danaher's
request, but officials said there is a need to regulate
some of the Band's controversial public displays.
"The Band represents Stanford at many events
and. contributes to the public perception of the Uni

versity," Boardman said. "The kind of behavior that
has been described is not the impression we want to
convey."
He noted two ways the University deals with over
ly outrageous behavior. The formal process headed
by the Organization Conduct Board (OCB) reviews
violations of University policy at hearings. A more in
formal and direct approach takes place regularly be
tween Band leadership and University administra
tors.
"We continue to work closely with the Band lead
ership to model and instill in their membership the
values and principles of good citizenship," Boardman
said."To that end, the Band leadership meets regular

The Band's list of outrageous antics, like its Christian mockery at the Notre Dame game pictured above, has elicited public complaint from alumnus Danaher
sess their progress and to reinforce
conduct expectations. I share con
cerns about any behavior that
breaches the expectations of good
citizenship that we expect of all Stan
ford students."
Nanci Howe, director of the Of
fice of Student Activities, cited alco
hol issues as the most pressing con
cern in toning down Band behavior.
"The University works closely
with the Band so that it adheres to all
University policies and Athletic De
partment expectations," she said. "In
the last few years most problems
have centered on issues of misuse of
alcohol. In response to past alcohol
problems, the Band is currently on
University mandated alcohol proba
tion and will remain on probation
until June 2007. University staff also
worked closely with Band leadership
when it relieved the former TVee from
her role after alcohol problems en
countered at a women's basketball
game winter quarter in Berkeley."
Howe said she feels that commu
nication between the University and
the Band is healthy and open.
"The current Band leadership,
Michael Priest and Adam Cohen,
have proven to be collaborative and
responsive to University needs and
concerns and have helped strengthen
the Band's relationship with the Uni
versity," she said.

Cohen, a junior assistant Band
manager, joked about what he felt
was the strange nature of Danaher's
complaint.
"Actually, Eugene Danaher is the
first person we've encountered who
has expressed negative sentiments
towards the Band," he said. "That's
why the Chronicle ran a feature on it:
it was that strange. We're currently
looking into what sort of changes
we've made recently that would have
fueled such feelings. Our best guess,
at the moment, is that it has some
thing to do with the fact that Dr.
Danaher is actually an undergradu
ate alum of Cal."
Band member Ari Officer, a fresh
man, said he felt that the controversy
would actually help the Band's popu
larity and reputation.
"Controversy breeds innovation,
conflict and creativity," he said. "The
Band needs some opposition to help
guide its development as an integral
part of Stanford University."
While many students said that
Danaher's proposition was excessive,
others cited concerns of their own
about the Band.
"It is kind of embarrassing when
they make fun of majors and stuff,"
said freshman Erin Dizon.i remem
ber one when they made fun of engi
neers. It's funny but it's kind of em
barrassing."

Freshman Ricky Villarreal sympa
thized with Dizon's desire to see
more structure and organization.
"When I see a band coming from a
big university, I want it to show some
sort of talent and organization, and I
feel that the marching band doesn't
resemble that at all," he said. "I wish it
made more of an effort to try to im
prove musical skills."
While both agreed on points of
improvement, the freshmen defend
ed the legitimacy of having a band.
"In regards to banning the Band, 1
don't think that should be done just
because it's a Stanford tradition."
said Villarreal. "It's always been here
and it's always lifted the morale of the
students."
Senior Bryan Heckenlively
agreed.
"I think that the Band makes
going to a sporting event more spe
cial. It makes it the special, unique
college atmosphere."
Freshman Brandon Williams
added that the Stanford band is not
only amusing, but an essential part of
the campus atmosphere.
"I love the Stanford Band," he
said. "I think that it is kind of defining
of the Stanford mentality — wild and
crazy and absurd. A normal marching
band — that's not the Stanford
Band. The Stanford Band is part of
what defines Stanford."

The Band's list of outrageous antics, like its Christian mockery at the Notre Dame game pictured above, has elicited public complaint from alumnus Danaher
sess their progress and to reinforce
conduct expectations. I share con
cerns about any behavior that
breaches the expectations of good
citizenship that we expect of all Stan
ford students."
Nanci Howe, director of the Of
fice of Student Activities, cited alco
hol issues as the most pressing con
cern in toning down Band behavior.
"The University works closely
with the Band so that it adheres to all
University policies and Athletic De
partment expectations," she said. "In
the last few years most problems
have centered on issues of misuse of
alcohol. In response to past alcohol
problems, the Band is currently on
University mandated alcohol proba
tion and will remain on probation
until June 2007. University staff also
worked closely with Band leadership
when it relieved the former TVee from
her role after alcohol problems en
countered at a women's basketball
game winter quarter in Berkeley."
Howe said she feels that commu
nication between the University and
the Band is healthy and open.
"The current Band leadership,
Michael Priest and Adam Cohen,
have proven to be collaborative and
responsive to University needs and
concerns and have helped strengthen
the Band's relationship with the Uni
versity," she said.

Cohen, a junior assistant Band
manager, joked about what he felt
was the strange nature of Danaher's
complaint.
"Actually, Eugene Danaher is the
first person we've encountered who
has expressed negative sentiments
towards the Band," he said. "That's
why the Chronicle ran a feature on it:
it was that strange. We're currently
looking into what sort of changes
we've made recently that would have
fueled such feelings. Our best guess,
at the moment, is that it has some
thing to do with the fact that Dr.
Danaher is actually an undergradu
ate alum of Cal."
Band member Ari Officer, a fresh
man, said he felt that the controversy
would actually help the Band's popu
larity and reputation.
"Controversy breeds innovation,
conflict and creativity," he said. "The
Band needs some opposition to help
guide its development as an integral
part of Stanford University."
While many students said that
Danaher's proposition was excessive,
others cited concerns of their own
about the Band.
"It is kind of embarrassing when
they make fun of majors and stuff,"
said freshman Erin Dizon.i remem
ber one when they made fun of engi
neers. It's funny but it's kind of em
barrassing."

Freshman Ricky Villarreal sympa
thized with Dizon's desire to see
more structure and organization.
"When I see a band coming from a
big university, I want it to show some
sort of talent and organization, and I
feel that the marching band doesn't
resemble that at all," he said. "I wish it
made more of an effort to try to im
prove musical skills."
While both agreed on points of
improvement, the freshmen defend
ed the legitimacy of having a band.
"In regards to banning the Band, 1
don't think that should be done just
because it's a Stanford tradition."
said Villarreal. "It's always been here
and it's always lifted the morale of the
students."
Senior Bryan Heckenlively
agreed.
"I think that the Band makes
going to a sporting event more spe
cial. It makes it the special, unique
college atmosphere."
Freshman Brandon Williams
added that the Stanford band is not
only amusing, but an essential part of
the campus atmosphere.
"I love the Stanford Band," he
said. "I think that it is kind of defining
of the Stanford mentality — wild and
crazy and absurd. A normal marching
band — that's not the Stanford
Band. The Stanford Band is part of
what defines Stanford."
From Christian mockery at Notre Dame to paro
dies of polygamy at Brigham Young University, the
Stanford Band's list of outrages grows every year. It
was a first, however, that a public complaint was filed
by alumnus Eugene Danaher through the San Fran
cisco Chronicle to get rid of the Band once and for all.
Danaher has written letters to President John
Hennessy, the Alumni Association and Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Greg Boardman protesting that the
Band's sense of humor and wild antics sometimes go
too far. His notion of an ideal band follows more tra
ditional lines, like that of the University of Michigan
at Ann Arbor.
"They have clean uniforms and snappy routines,"

Danaher said. "There are plenty of examples of
bands that could be used as models that could bring
the Stanford band back into the fraternity of good
bands."
Boardman said that Danaher is not alone in his
criticism. Other alumni have also expressed disap
proval about the Band's conduct.
"The anti-Band letters outweigh the pro-Band let
ters,"he said. "However, I must admit that I don't get
very many letters on this topic. When I do get letters,
they tend to arrive soon after an event, like the BYU
game."
The University has no plans to fulfill Danaher's
request, but officials said there is a need to regulate
some of the Band's controversial public displays.
"The Band represents Stanford at many events
and. contributes to the public perception of the Uni

versity," Boardman said. "The kind of behavior that
has been described is not the impression we want to
convey."
He noted two ways the University deals with over
ly outrageous behavior. The formal process headed
by the Organization Conduct Board (OCB) reviews
violations of University policy at hearings. A more in
formal and direct approach takes place regularly be
tween Band leadership and University administra
tors.
"We continue to work closely with the Band lead
ership to model and instill in their membership the
values and principles of good citizenship," Boardman
said."To that end, the Band leadership meets regular
ly with one or more University administrators to as-
