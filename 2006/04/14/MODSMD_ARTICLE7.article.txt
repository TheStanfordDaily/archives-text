# Band marches into public criticism
## Alumnus expresses desire for a more serious, traditional marching band 
### ANDREA FULLER STAFF WRITER 
From Christian mockery at Notre Dame to paro
dies of polygamy at Brigham Young University, the
Stanford Band's list of outrages grows every year. It
was a first, however, that a public complaint was filed
by alumnus Eugene Danaher through the San Fran
cisco Chronicle to get rid of the Band once and for all.
Danaher has written letters to President John
Hennessy, the Alumni Association and Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Greg Boardman protesting that the
Band's sense of humor and wild antics sometimes go

Boardman said that Danaher is not alone in his
criticism. Other alumni have also expressed disap

very many letters on this topic. When I do get letters,
they tend to arrive soon after an event, like the BYU
game."

request, but officials said there is a need to regulate
some of the Band's controversial public displays.
"The Band represents Stanford at many events
and. contributes to the public perception of the Uni

versity," Boardman said. "The kind of behavior that
has been described is not the impression we want to
convey."
He noted two ways the University deals with over

by the Organization Conduct Board (OCB) reviews
violations of University policy at hearings. A more in
formal and direct approach takes place regularly be
tween Band leadership and University administra
tors.
"We continue to work closely with the Band lead

values and principles of good citizenship," Boardman
said."To that end, the Band leadership meets regular
