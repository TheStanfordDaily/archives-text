## New law building in the works Move over Munger: Law Alum Neukom donates $20 million 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Last December, William Neukom — a 1967
graduate of the Stanford Law School — made a
$20 million donation to the Law School to be used
for the construction of a new academic building.
Law School Dean Larry Kramer said that the
building will be constructed as soon as possible and
hopefully completed by 2010.
The planning process is only just beginning; the
Law School must obtain approval from the Board
of Trustees, leaving the site, architect and design
uncertain. The building will house faculty offices,
meeting rooms and open common areas with the
goal of easing and increasing interaction between
faculty and students.
Kramer discussed the influence architecture has
on communication within a community and the im
portance of openness within the new building.
"Architecture speaks and [the architecture of
the current building] doesn't," Kramer said. "I
think we have a really interactive community to
which our current architecture is an obstacle."
He cited problems such as faculty offices being
on one side of long halls on the second and third
floors, closest to the exit.
"If a student comes to visit a faculty member
and they're not there, there's no place to go but
back where you came from,"he said. "There are

very few areas in the law school for students and
faculty to just sit and talk to each other."
The new building will be designed not only to
foster interaction among the members of the law
community but also to encourage interdisciplinary
work with the rest of the University Outside of the
physical realm of buildings, the Law School is also
working toward interdisciplinary coordination
with the University by gradually transitioning
from the semester system to the quarter system.
According to second-year law student and
Graduate Student Council Co-Chair Jenny Allen,
"One of the visionary directions Stanford Univer
sity is currently pursuing is the development of in
terdisciplinary study An additional Law School
building dedicated to academic spaces and collab
oration between the Law School and the Universi
ty will be incredibly useful to faculty and students."
Kramer also mentioned interdisciplinary work
and talked about "making the Law School into a
place where law students get exposed to all of the
things outside of the narrow confine of law that are
going to be part of their professional lives but the
rest of the University which deals with lawyers in
various ways, also gets that exposure."
Features of the new building will likely include
offices on both sides of the hallways, with open
areas in between for people to naturally run into
each other, attractive waiting places, accessible
rooms for small meetings, increased openness be
tween floors an abundance of natural light.

Law School administrators are debating when to begin construction for the new law building in order to minimize inconveniences
already caused by current construction such as the one on Barnum Cener, pictured above.
graduate students from various dis
ciplines, including law, is currently
being built near the Law School and
will impact the timing of the con
struction of the new law building.
Kramer said that construction is
an inconvenience for nearby resi
dents, thus they will need to discuss
whether it will be more disruptive to
the community to build the law
building concurrently with Munger,
or whether the two should be built
sequentially.
Neukom's donation comes at an
opportune time. Already short on
space, the Law School also has plans
to expand programming, especially
clinics and research. Kramer said he
hopes Neukom will remain involved
in the building process.
"He's got a lot of experience and
good taste and good ideas so 1 hope
he's involved," Kramer said. "The
idea is to create more space and
make it a kind of space that's inviting
to the kind of conversation we think
should be going on here."
