Students Taking Action Now on Darfur
(STAND) scored a victory last week when
the California State Teachers' Retirement
System Board voted 9-0 in support of a
measure to divest the fund's holdings from
companies with ties to Sudan.
The decision was the fruit of an intercolle
giate effort, STAND being one of the con
tributors. The organization is a national
movement with branches on over 200 college
and high school campuses. Its mission is to
promote financial and political action to alle

Elberger also emphasized the strong in

ties. Members of Stanford STAND believe
CaISTRS has enormous power to affect
company behavior, with consulting firm
Conflict Securities Advisory Group estimat
ing that CaISTRS has over $5.5 billion in
companies doing business in Sudan.
"We believe that targeted divestment of

oil-sector companies can leverage that enor
mous holding to pressure oil companies to
scale back operations in Sudan — depriving
the government of necessary oil concession
revenue — or to pressure oil companies to
demand an end to the genocide from the Su
danese government," Elberger said.
"At the end, we produced a substantial re
sult," said Nikki Serapio, a junior and
STAND member. "Just recently, the Su

ment — it appears that we've struck a
nerve."
Angelides acknowledged the grassroots
student movement as one of the key contrib
utors to the successful approval of his mo

"The groundswell of support for divest

up call that American investment funds
