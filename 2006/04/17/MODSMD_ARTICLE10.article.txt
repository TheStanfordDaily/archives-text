## WHO IS NICO? Junior competes in another big-time "Jeopardy!" tourney after succeeding on the show's College Championship 
### KAT LEWIN STAFF WRITER 
Trivia aficionado junior Nico Martinez
recently competed for the $250,000 top
prize in "Jeopardy!"'s not-so-trivial
Tournament of Champions. Martinez was
invited to participate after winning a
$100,000 prize and top honors in "Jeop-
2005 College Championship last
November.
Martinez cannot reveal the results of the
competition until it airs May 8 to May 19.
The episode on which he appears will air on
May 12.
The Tournament of Champions is an an
nual two-week competition during which
15 champions from the preceding season
face off in threes over the course of five
quarter-final rounds, three semi-final
rounds and a two-day cumulative final.This
year's entrants either had to win at least
three individual shows this season or accu
mulate more than $100,000 in earnings, ac
cording to Martinez. Additionally, each
year's College Championship winner is
guaranteed an invitation to the Tourna
ment of Champions.
"It was a little bit different from doing
the college show because you had such an
eclectic mix of people," Martinez says.
"There were some people who were young
and some in their late 50s. You had guys
who had won 20 games in a row, then peo
ple like me who had just won tournaments,
so it was different in that not everybody
was about the same age. It was a little bit
more uptight in the green room [a lounge
onset in which participants relax before
taping]."
However, Martinez's girlfriend, senior
Becky Garza, says she felt he handled the
pressure well. Garza traveled to Los Ange
les along with her family, Martinez's family
and one of Martinez's close friends to
watch the taping on April 10 and 11.
"It was really fun to get to go see how
they tape it. but it was also really nerve
wracking because you have to watch
everyone else go and be totally quiet,"
Garza says."I don't think he was nervous
at all, though. I really think he just likes
to play the game so much that when he
goes up there he isn't nervous — he just
loves it."
Martinez says he found the experience
enjoyable.
"TTie contestant coordinators try to keep
a pretty loose atmosphere," Martinez ex
plains. "My feeling going into it was I'd al
ready done really well — better than 1 ex
pected in the first place — so this was just
sort of like the sugar on top of everything. I
was even less expected to win this because I
don't think a college student has ever won
the Tournament of Champions."
Although Martinez says he was relative
ly relaxed about the tournament, his
friends recall that he studied hard for the
competition. Junior Ari Neumann, Mar
tinez's roommate, helped him review trivia
before his appearance in the College

Championship.
"He studies a lot out of a trivia hook that
he has," Neumann says."He reads the book
so much that the binding is falling apart."
Martinez also took time out of his spring
break to prepare for the tournament.
"He really only heard he was going on
the show a month and a half ago, so he was
working with books and looking up differ
ent things he was weak on," Garza says.
"During spring break we went on a trip to
Cabo San Lucas and everyone teased us
because all day Nico would be studying
one of his trivia books or else I 'd be asking
him questions. Everyone teased us that
that was what Stanford kids did over
spring break."
According to Garza, Martinez's sister

helped him brush up on pop culture, which
he considers his weakest subject. Martinez
also changed the way he studied pop cul
ture for the Tournament of Champions, as
opposed to the college contest.
"The biggest difference is that I tried to
learn about pop culture that would be more
geared toward adults — older TV shows,
older movies and older music," Martinez
explains. "For the college show they'd try to
keep the pop culture pretty recent, but
when you have the Tournament of Cham
pions with 40-or-50-year-olds, they're going
to want music from the 70s and movies
from the 505."
Garza says Martinez represented him
self very well.
"I've always been impressed by how

much he knows, hut I'm proud of him most
ly because of how humble he is and how
hard he works without people noticing,"
she says. "He's the kind of person who
would never tell you how much he's study
ing or about all of his awards or achieve
ments even though he's a really successful
person. I couldn't be prouder."
Martinez says his experience with Jeop
ardy! has given him a positive taste for
game shows.
"There's always a chance I'll get to go
back on Jeopardy! if they have another ul
timate tournament, but if any other quiz
show comes around, I'll be there trying out
for sure," he says. "My mom wants me to go
on The Amazing Race, but I don't know
about that."
