# Is that a crowbar in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?
## 
### 
In preparation for Pub Night this week, I en
dured a crowbar wound to the back and was
zipped into a (clean) body bag in a room full
of cadavers. It was a bit more extreme than my
normal ritual of lavender-scented body scrub fol
lowed by careful makeup application, but the re
sults were encouraging: at Blue Chalk 1 was on
top of my game, passing out digits left and right
like it ain't no thang. When you've faced and con
quered your biggest fears — i.e. claustrophobia,
dead people and crowbars — interacting with
the opposite sex seems like small change.
The background behind this story is that the
very talented Barrett Sheridan thought my face
would look great on a morgue slab, so he asked
me to play the role of a murder victim in a film
he will submit to the Stanford Film Festival.
Needless to say 1 was extremely flattered. 1 have
several acting credits to my name, most notably
playing the role of "Girl Who Smokes Pot and
Goes Insane" in a fifth grade DARE skit, so it
felt good to have my qualifications acknowl
edged by the Stanford community. I'm even
thinking about trashing my plans to become a
writer after graduation and pursuing acting full
time, perhaps starring in commercials or
pornographies.
Anyway,everything was going fine until I was
informed on the day of filming that the majority
of my scenes would take place in a room full of
real dead people. This information was mildly
disconcerting. I am not the biggest fan of creepy
or scary things, and I may or may not have
passed out from fear the first time I saw "How
the Grinch Stole Christmas" when I was four.
But actors have to do weird things in order to get
famous, right? Charlize Theron had to gain all
that weight for "Monster." Kate Winslet had to
strip down for "Titanic." I'm sure ET had to
show Steven Spielberg his boobs or something.
So 1 decided to pay my dues — 1 sucked it up
and hopped into the body bag. It wasn't too bad
until the zipper got stuck, and at that point my
brain had such limited oxygen supply that I had
no idea what was going on.
The crowbar injury was an unexpected but
exciting reward for my work.The script called for
me to writhe on the ground while the actor who
played the murderer hit the dirt to my left. Un
fortunately, the actor got a bit carried away and
the weapon grazed my shoulder blade. It didn't
hurt as much as it surprised me. and we got some
great footage of me screaming realistically at the
murderer to stop hitting me with the crowbar.
After we finished shooting for the day, I
wiped the fake blood off my face (and the real
blood off my back) and headed out to the Night
of the Pub with my posse in tow. We had a great
time. I think it was on the Marguerite back home
that I began to appreciate the fact that the situa
tions that would have normally intimidated me
— i.e., talking to the people I'm crushing on, el
bowing my way to the front of the line, shouting
obscenities at people who have wronged me —
seemed so incredibly inconsequential in compar
ison to what I had experienced earlier that day.
It gave me hope for the rest of the Stanford stu
dent body If we can just learn to conquer our fears,
to face the things that really scare us, we can ap
proach our love lives with a powerful confidence
and a renewed sense of self. What would you do if
you weren't afraid? What are you waiting for?
The experience was so instructive for me per
sonally that I now have the desire to conquer my
other phobias, most notably my debilitating fear
of revolving doors. Also: calamari. That stuff is
disgusting. Anyone want to film a movie about a
girl who gets killed by a fried seafood appetizer?
Maybe we can grab some real food after we fin
ish shooting. Now that's what I call "action."

Marie's shoulder is fine now, thanks. Comment on
