### AMNA AZIZ 
"Mankind ought to he taught that religions
are but the varied expressions of The Reli
gion. which is Oneness, so that each may
choose the path that suits him best." These
words, thundered by Swami Vivekananda at
the 1893 World Parliament of Religions in
Chicago, paralleled the atmosphere of a
multi-faith event at Stanford on Saturday cel
ebrating his life. Swami Vivekananda is uni
versally regarded as a patriot saint of modern
India.
Saturday's event featured music, dancing
and lectures to promote awareness about
Swami Vivekananda's life. The speakers, in
cluding Swami Vedananda from the Vedanta
Society of San Francisco, focused mainly on
the concepts of detachment and unity within
faith. Religions represented include the Ba
ha'i faith. Buddhism. Islam, Christianity, Ju
daism and Hinduism.
"By bringing out the similarities and cele

brating the differences, we are doing our duty
toward bringing people of different faiths to
gether, and thus, being true to our own faith,"
says management science and engineering
graduate student Somik Raha, who is also the
co-president of the Hindu Students Council
(HSC), one of the events sponsors. "In a
world that is increasingly intolerant, we be
lieve that positive action is better than nega
tive criticism, and this is our small effort in this
direction."
Stanford alumnus and active member of
the Stanford Baha'i Association James
Threatt examined the idea of oneness within
his faith and his own spiritual journey.
"Everyone has within them the word of
God," Threatt says."I became aware that we
truly are one family. I realized that I can love
every human being because I can recognize
this higher trait in him or her."
Along these lines, Swami Vivekananda
strove to promote peace and unity between
India and the West, serving as a spiritual am

bassador between the societies.
Born Narendranath Datta in Calcutta,
India,Swami Vivekananda emerged as a lead
ing scholar on Hinduism at the World Parlia
ment of Religions and his influence spread
through both Indian and Western societies.
His cultural knowledge, spiritual insight and
eloquent language made him appealing both
in America and India.
He advocated worship in the form of serv
ice to man as the visible manifestation of the
"Godhead" to Hindus and recognized the ne
cessity of accepting a multi-faith approach.
Swami Vivekananda studied philosophy at
the Scottish Church College in Calcutta.
There, he began to question the existence and
manifestation of God. In 1881 he met his men
tor Sri Ramakrishna and began his transfor
mation from a restless and puzzled youth to a
mature man who was ready to renounce
everything in order to attain a realization of
God. After his mentor died in 1886, he decid
ed to leave the monastery and become a wan

dering monk.
"He saw the beauty of people [during his
wanderings], but he also saw a lot of problems
with the caste system and people warping the
religion with their own dogma," says Stanford
alumnus Ajay Kshatriya.
On Dec. 24, 1892, Swami Vivekananda
reached Kanyakumari — the southernmost
tip of India — where he meditated on a rock
for three days.
"[During the meditation J, he realized that
his mission in life was to bring Hindu spiritu
al life to the West and bring Western science
and technology to the East," Kshatriya ex
plains.
Swami Vedananda describes Saturday's
event with enthusiasm.
"It's so delightful for me to be in a place
where there are so many people from differ
ent faiths and to experience the wonderful en
ergy created here," he says."The one thing we
accept is that we're all conscious beings. Some
of us insist that consciousness be called God.

That idea of what we call God can he taken in
a very personal way, but the main thing that
we are talking about is a universal divine real
ity. It is the essence of everything."
The idea of a universal divine reality was
central to Swami Vedananda's lecture. He
suggested that this idea can serve as the
bridge between people of all faiths and
philosophies, and that accepting it can lead to
unity.
"The event was a success and drew the
crowds we had hoped to gather." says fresh
man and co-president of the HSC Priyanka
Sharma.'i think that the multi-faith approach
was a key aspect of our agenda, and the suc
cess of the event gave me a very positive vibe
and gave the HSC more confidence in our
ability to mobilize concerned individuals."
The HSC sponsored the event in conjunc
tion with the Muslim Students Awareness
Network, the Stanford Baha'i Association,
World Peace Buddhists and the Stanford
India Association.
