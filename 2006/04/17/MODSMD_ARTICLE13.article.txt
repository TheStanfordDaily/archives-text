## Editorial The 						SOCC: A blight on the democratic process? 
### 
Amid all of the excitement of the ASSU
elections, it is easy to overlook one de
tractor to the electoral process that
surpasses all others. The Students of Color
Coalition (SOCC). while arguably well-inten
tioned. has become an engine of discrimina
tion, racism and democratic regression. Now
that the elections are over and the political
stakes are lower, Stanford students should
take the time to carefully dissect the SOCC's
faulty logic and its veneer of inclusiveness to
uncover the demagogy beneath.
The SOCC is an umbrella organization
encompassing five of Stanford's largest eth
nic associations: the Asian American Stu
dents Association, the Black Student Union,
MEChA, the Muslim Student Awareness
Network and the Stanford American Indian
Organization. The mission of the SOCC is,
inter alia, to "promote the respect of Stan
ford's racial, cultural and ethnic groups." Ac
cordingly, in this year's ASSU elections, the
SOCC endorsed 13 candidates for Senate
and submitted a formal endorsement of an
executive slate. The criteria for these en
dorsements were predictable: the candidates
had to demonstrate or promise support for
diversity and ethnic groups on campus and
display a passion for improving the life of
Stanford's ethnic minorities.
Not surprisingly, SOCC-endorsed candi
dates fared tremendously well. Ten of the 13
candidates for Senate were among the 15
senators elected; the SOCC-endorsed candi
dates who lost came in 16th, 17th and 19th.
Incoming ASSU Executives Elizabeth Heng
and Lauren Graham were also endorsed by
the SOCC. "This is a complete victory for the
SOCC," declared Diego Martin, co-chair of
MEChA. after the results were announced.
And surely he is right. But is it a victory for
democracy? Hardly.
The SOCC targets and exploits a miscon
ception that minority groups are underrep
resented in the Senate and by the ASSU ex
ecutives. If anything, however, ethnic mi
norities are actually overrepresented in stu
dent government at Stanford. In fact — ex
cept for the Chappie slate — every single
candidate on an executive slate for the past

two years has been a minority. Minority
groups have long had a strong voice in the
undergraduate body and have established
solid links of advocacy with the administra
tion. To suggest otherwise is misleading.
Of course, special interest groups will al
ways factor in the results of an election. It
would be unfair to criticize the SOCC simply
for being exceptionally organized and effec
tive. But the way in which it picks its en
dorsements should be called into question.
Simply put, SOCC only endorsed minority
candidates, and not a single white student.
It stretches this Board's capacity for rea
son and belief that not even one non-minor
ity candidate for the Undergraduate Senate
would have effectively campaigned for di
versity, or that not a single non-minority can
didate could be considered a trusted friend
of these ethnic groups.
Nor can the SOCC be congratulated for
endorsing a representative group of ethnic
minorities: a majority of their endorsements
went to African American candidates, which
suggests that certain groups are wielding dis
proportionate influence even within the
SOCC. As such, the organization struggles to
meet its ostensible goals of increasing racial
diversity.
Not only is this approach to endorse
ments essentially racist, it also damages the
democratic process by framing the election
in terms of color rather than the issues.There
is no problem with the SOCC or a similar
group making endorsements, so long as this
support is based on issues other than race. As
it stands, SOCC endorsements distract from
the dozens of important issues that affect
Stanford students — issues that both minor
ity and non-minority candidates are working
hard to address.
Election Bill 05, which prohibited SOCC
endorsements from appearing on the ballot
— passed by both the ASSU and GSC —
marks an important first step in containing
the group's discriminatory practices. Now it
is the responsibility of students to hold the
SOCC accountable for its actions, and for
the coalition itself to listen to the voices of
reason and embrace the spirit of democracy.
