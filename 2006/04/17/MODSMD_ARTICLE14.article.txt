# Fun with ProFros
## 
### 
Rejoice, for Admit Weekend is nigh.
This coming weekend, our campus
will be overrun with prospective
freshmen. Some of you cynics may he an
noyed by their optimistic and idealistic out
looks. I, however, will not be the slightest
bit irritated by our newest visitors. Their
young minds are ripe with enthusiasm,
naivete and impressionability, which pre
dict a bountiful harvest for anyone in the
field of exploitation.
In case you have forgotten what ProFros
are like, I invite you to journey with me to a
day now dusty in the volumes of your mem
ory, to the day your fateful envelope arrived
in the mail. Can you remember your excite
ment, your expectations, your anxious pon
derings of the future?
You probably remember your excite
ment, but recall also your hazy perception of
what Stanford would be like. It is this uncer
tainty— the ProFros' readiness to accept
the new as the norm — that gives us
supreme power over them. It is this power
we must harness in order to ride the waves of
their emotions to the shores of fiscal and ma
terial plenty.
So what are ProFros good for besides
gawking and babbling about how happy
they are they got into Stanford? First, let's
focus on their ecstasy about getting into
Stanford. These kids are so Stanford-hyped
right now that they will buy anything even
remotely related to the University. Why let
the Bookstore reap all the benefits of the
Pro Fro spirit? Convince ProFros that it's
way cooler to buy a shirt from a real Stan
ford student than it is to buy an official Stan
ford shirt. I also suggest selling notes from
your old classes. (Tell them that they better
get started studying now—it's what you
did.)
Perhaps the best thing about ProFros is
that this is their first time at Stanford, so it is
easy to invent fun traditions for them to
carry out. Explain to them that it is an un
written ritual for ProFros to wait on their
RoHo masters during the weekend. And if
they forget to tuck in the corners of your
sheets after making your bed. take off the
linens and make them do it again.
Remember. ProFros are excited, but so
are their parents! Jump into the car of the
Pro Fro and his family and direct them to

your favorite University Avenue restaurant.
Make sure to order three courses consisting
of the most expensive things on the menu.
After dinner, reach for your pocket and dis
cover you've forgotten your wallet.
Many current students are annoyed by
Admit Weekend because of the Universi
ty's alcohol policy. From a purely econom
ic standpoint, this means that scarcity can
be on your side. Low supply plus high de
mand equals big profits for sellers. I know
what you're thinking, "I can't sell alcohol
to ProFros!" And you're right, that would
be a stupid idea. What would be a good
idea, however, is to sell them something
similar like...non-alcoholic beer! Make
sure you tell the ProFros it's real beer, that
way you can charge them more and they'll
feel cooler.
Finally, I point out another set of oppor
tunities that ProFros offer. Though the Uni
versity is very clear about this being a dry
weekend, it has not been as direct about
other limitations. The University discour
ages me from being too explicit here. But I
will go as far as to say that given how excited
these ProFros are to talk with you, imagine
how eager they would be to do other things
with you...
Anyway, now that I have given the Stan
ford population advice on how to behave, I
think it is only fair for me to give some ad
vice to ProFros. Since yesterday was Easter
and I was feeling mildly spiritual (probably
induced by eating massive quantities of
sugar-loaded Peeps and chocolates), I
picked this nugget of wisdom out of the
Bible to remind ProFros of the most impor
tant thing they should do while visiting Stan
ford:
"Be sober. (Peter 5:8)"
