# Writing a thesis, writing off sociability
## 
### 
This column has been written largely be
cause my mind has been fixated,
chained to the dark throne of English
literature for the last six months. It will stay
there until it thinks about what it's done and
realizes the mistake it's made. Oh crap. I just
made a Gothic image with my previous state
ment, thereby making me a successor to
Poe's legacy. I'm writing a thesis on Edgar
Allan Poe. He is my distant tormenter, and
with his big light bulb-shaped head and little
mustache, he has been — from beyond the
grave — haunting me more than any one of
his other tales. I am afraid that I will be be
come the outcast, penniless, deeply de
pressed writer that was Poe. I look terrible in
a mustache.
Let's face it: Chicks don't dig Poe. If 1 was
going to fake being intellectual, why couldn't
I have done it for a writer that is highly re
garded as being sensitive? "Oh you're writ
ing on Jane Austen, oh you sweet, sweet
man."Then I'd say something about how, yes.
I think oftentimes men in the literary com
munity write Austen off as an author of man
ners, but / know brilliance in a woman when
I see it. This would be said, of course, while I
stare at the interested party's chest.
I think even if I went with someone shitty
like whoever the hell wrote "The Notebook,"
I could have been rolling in the ladies. I could
have learned to say: "It was like, the most
moving book I've ever read. Hold me and ca
ress me, for I lack the spine necessary to
stand." But no, I went with Poe. I make dumb
life choices. This is like that time in high
school when everyone got gold class rings but
I chose one that lit up and was also a whistle.

With Poe, immediately people think I'm a
Goth. I'm not. I wear Hawaiian shirts. Do I
identify with the impotent little squirt? No. I
respect his writings.
Maybe I should have gone with one of
the sexy majors. Venture capitalism? Eco
nomics? Taxidermy? For a senior project,
working hours with the smell of formalde
hyde to stuff a dead bird at this point would
probably make me more attractive at a
party than "I'm working on proving that
Edgar Allan Poe is relevant to the average
American." I'm not the average American,
otherwise I too would walk away from the
kid with the punk T-shirt who is ranting on
about the symbolism of teeth removal and
premature burial.
I'm beginning to see the parallels that
Poe's stories have with my own life. Poe
wrote about an overly intellectualized sex
less detective who sits in his room and solves
murders in the dark. I'm an overly intellectu
alized undersexed college student who sits in
his room and murders dozens of little cyber
people in Grand Theft Auto. My detective
work is pretty simple I guess, because I also
know who has been responsible for killing
kittens after those French film classes.
Poe's detective had a partner in his misery.

and I guess I do too. He's the Watson to my
Holmes, if Watson and Holmes were bitter
senior thesis writers that go to In-N-Out
rather than actually do work. I know I cite my
roommate in this column a lot, but I have to
assure the reader that he was once cheery
and sweet. Then he had a thesis. Now 1 rou
tinely use him as my id in columns, offering
an angrier, comically belligerent counter
weight to my thinly veiled sarcasm. We play a
lot of GTA.
The problem with this whole thing is I
know that 1 am good at writing a thesis. 1 was
made for this type of work. Overanalysis of
actions made by female characters in a dark
setting is a skill I learned at Columbae par
ties. Now I get credit for it.
I'm used to talking about shit nobody
cares about, because that's what makes me
a good Daily writer. One month from now
I'll have this nice bound copy of pain, sweat,
deep reflection and brilliant analysis. I will
also have gotten farther in GTA than I will
have with a woman in a long, long time. The
sound my thesis makes as I throw it onto
the department's table will be a dull thud, a
final stake in the coffin of my social life, for
when I emerge, I will be some creature of
the night — a socially stunted outsider who
has spent most of his nights indoors — ana
lyzing the minds of people who bury their
sisters alive or murder their landlords. I will
be finally ready to run for the Undergradu
ate Senate.

Chris actually has been enjoying his thesis and
his social life couldn't he better, but saying the
opposite is a lot more fun. Send complaints to
