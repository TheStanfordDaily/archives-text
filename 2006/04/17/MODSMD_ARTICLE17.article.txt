## Baseball swept at OSU Zero runs in 18 straight innings dooms Card, now losers of nine of their last 13 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITORS 
This past Easter weekend, the Cardi
nal saw eggs for 18 straight innings —
gooseeggs on the scoreboard, that is. All
told, the weekend went from bad to ugly
to worse as Stanford dropped 3-0 and 1-
0 decisions Thursday and Friday, respec
tively, before suffering through a 12-1
blowout yesterday that was called after
seven innings due to a 10-run mercy rule.
The Oregon State series marked
Stanford's fourth straight losing series.
And. just like in the series losses to
Washington State and, twice. USC, Stan
ford's offense was the culprit. This past
weekend in Corvallis, Ore., Stanford

mustered just one run and 10 hits in their
three losses.
After an 11-5 start to the season,
Stanford (15-14,2-7 Pac-10) has now lost
nine of its last 13.
Stanford had not been shutout in Pac
-10 play since 2001. But, on a nice Thurs
day night, Oregon State (25-9, 6-3 Pac
-10) blanked the Cardinal and senior
righthander Greg Reynolds (2-3, 3.82
ERA), 3-0. Stanford managed just four
hits in the loss — and nothing longer
than a single.
It only got worse on Friday. Again,
Stanford notched only four hits. This
time though, they also blew a great out
ing from freshman lefty Jeremy Bleich
(2-2,2.08 ERA), and squandered scoring
opportunities in the first,third and ninth.
Senior catcher John Hester commit
ted the final out in both the first and
third. The first ended on a flyout to left
with runners stranded on first and sec
ond. With one out and the bases loaded
in the third. Hester hit into a 5-4-3 dou
ble play to end the inning.

It wasn't just Hester though. Men
stood on the corners with just one out in
the final frame. But junior leftfielder
Ryan Seawell hit into a contest-ending
double play.
The Beavers' sole run of the night
came off a balk from Stanford's sopho
more righty Nolan Gallagher (1.46
ERA,2-2).
Leftfielder Cole Gillespie led the
Beavers with two hits and one run on Fri
day. He singled up the middle to leadoff
his team's half of the seventh and moved
to third on a sacrifice and balk. After
walking another batter, Gallagher
balked for the second time in the inning
to send Gillespie home for the winning
run.
Kevin Gunderson notched his ninth
win of the season for Oregon State. And
in a game that took just 2:02 to complete,
Gunderson worked quickly. In fact, in a
stretch that ran from the fourth to the
ninth. Gunderson retired 17 straight bat-

ters.
Though less dramatic, Sunday's
game was just as disheartening.
Rightfielder Michael Taylor's dou
ble to left-center scored shortstop
Chris Minaker in the top of the first,
hut the Stanford lead was shortlived.
Oregon State scored six runs in

the first two innings, five off starter
Matt Manship (1-4,5.31 ERA), and
followed the explosion with two runs
apiece in the fourth, fifth and sixth
innings, roughing up sophomore
righthander David Stringer (2-2,
3.86 ERA) and freshman righty
Austin Yount (2-0,2.79 ERA).
Extra innings: Sunday's series
wrapper was postponed from Satur
day due to rain, marking the 11th
time that a game has been post
poned due to weather conditions
this year.
