### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
Stanford women's tennis clinched a
share of the Pac-10 title and set a new
NCAA record for most consecutive wins
with road victories over No. 30 Arizona and
No. 18 Arizona State this past weekend.The
top-ranked Cardinal (22-0,7-0 Pac-10) have
now won 78 straight matches and have not
lost since the 2003 NCAA team champi
onship match.
On Friday, the team faced formidable
winds gusting to 50 miles per hour, but still
easily got the win over the Wildcats (12-10,3-
4), 4-1.
"The conditions have never been tougher
than they were on Friday," Coach Lele Forood
said. "It was the worst wind I've ever seen."
The Cardinal swept on the doubles
courts. Sophomore Whitney Deason joined
sophomore Lejla Hodzic on the third court,
replacing freshman Jessica Nguyen who was
out for family reasons.The new duo won 8-6,
adding their win to the 8-3 victory by senior
Alice Barnes and junior Anne Yelsey at the
No. 1 position and the 8-4 victory by senior
Amber Liu and sophomore Celia Durkin at
the No. 2 spot.
In singles, Barnes, Yelsey and Durkin
snagged wins to secure the match.The match
was then called due to the wind. Hodzic and
Arizona's Camelia Todorova did not know
this, however, and continued to play on the
sixth court.Todorova ultimately prevailed,4-
6,4-6, denying Stanford the shutout.
On Saturday, the team guaranteed itself
at least a share of the conference crown with
its 6-1 win over the Sun Devils (12-8,3-4).
The Cardinal started the match by taking
the doubles point, but not without struggle.
Hodzic and Nguyen won 8-5 at the No. 3
spot, but Liu and Durkin were taken to a
tiebreaker on the second court. Though the
twosome were behind 1-4 in the tiebreaker,
they rallied back to take the win. 9-8 (7-5),
and secure the doubles point.
Barnes and Yelsey were not so fortunate
with their tiebreaker, however. The top
ranked doubles team in the nation took their
first loss at the hands of 43rd-ranked Kady
Pooler and Roxanne Clarke, 8-9 (5-7).
"Alice and Anne finally losing a match is
disappointing, but tiebreakers are hard,"
Forood said.
Both Barnes and Yelsey won their singles
matches, however â€” played against the very
girls they lost to in doubles. Fifth-ranked
Barnes beat 59th-ranked Clarke, 6-2, 6-2 at
the No. 2 position, while 13th-ranked Yelsey
beat Pooler in three sets, 2-6,6-3, 6-2 at the
No. 3 spot. The win was Yelsey's 20th of the
year as she remains undefeated in dual
match play.
The Sun Devils' lone point came from
Rebecca Rankin, as she defeated Deason 6-
2,1-6,6-3 in the fourth flight.
Junior Theresa Logar did not play this
weekend because of a clicking leg, so the
