# Family Guy visits Farm
## 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD MANAGING EDITOR 
Dressed in a slick leather jacket and armed with a back
pocket bottle of Jack Daniels, executive producer and creator
of the hit cartoon "Family Guy," Seth MacFarlane brought the
house down last night during his talk at Memorial Auditorium.
Speaking in front of a packed crowd of students and com
munity members — one of whom pointed out that MacFar
lane's sister used to baby sit her years ago in Connecticut —
MacFarlane touched on his show's recent rivalry with Come
dy Central's "South Park," as well as his ongoing battle with
government and network censors.
Much like the show itself, MacFarlane's amusing anec
dotes and non-sequiturs provided more humor than the cen
tral theme of the talk itself. In between the primary narrative
focusing on the show's history and his own background in car
tooning. MacFarlane weaved stories of Farrah Fawcett doing
cocaine in studio bathrooms and deliberations over whether
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) censors would
trade him "two asses and a bitch for that bastard."
For a man whose busy schedule precludes him from much
contact with his audience — this was his only appearance at a
college campus this year — MacFarlane seemed to relish the
opportunity to interact with the crowd.
Facing questions from attendees asking him to reenact
voices of popular characters, look at their prospective scripts
or hire them as summer interns, MacFarlane displayed his
comedic wit when asked by a fan simply to insult him.
"You want me to insult you?" MacFarlane quipped. "OK,
you supported the war in Iraq," he said to raucous applause.
After detailing the history of "Family Guy" and its produc
tion — each episode takes around nine months to create with
a crew of 75 people working in-studio — MacFarlane offered
insight into the show's constant tug-of-war with censorship.
