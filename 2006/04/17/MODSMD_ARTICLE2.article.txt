# Family Guy visits Farm
## 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD MANAGING EDITOR 
Dressed in a slick leather jacket and armed with a back
pocket bottle of Jack Daniels, executive producer and creator
of the hit cartoon "Family Guy," Seth MacFarlane brought the
house down last night during his talk at Memorial Auditorium.
Speaking in front of a packed crowd of students and com
munity members — one of whom pointed out that MacFar
lane's sister used to baby sit her years ago in Connecticut —
MacFarlane touched on his show's recent rivalry with Come
dy Central's "South Park," as well as his ongoing battle with
government and network censors.
Much like the show itself, MacFarlane's amusing anec
dotes and non-sequiturs provided more humor than the cen
tral theme of the talk itself. In between the primary narrative
focusing on the show's history and his own background in car
tooning. MacFarlane weaved stories of Farrah Fawcett doing
cocaine in studio bathrooms and deliberations over whether
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) censors would
trade him "two asses and a bitch for that bastard."
For a man whose busy schedule precludes him from much
contact with his audience — this was his only appearance at a
college campus this year — MacFarlane seemed to relish the
opportunity to interact with the crowd.
Facing questions from attendees asking him to reenact
voices of popular characters, look at their prospective scripts
or hire them as summer interns, MacFarlane displayed his
comedic wit when asked by a fan simply to insult him.
"You want me to insult you?" MacFarlane quipped. "OK,
you supported the war in Iraq," he said to raucous applause.
After detailing the history of "Family Guy" and its produc
tion — each episode takes around nine months to create with
a crew of 75 people working in-studio — MacFarlane offered
insight into the show's constant tug-of-war with censorship.

Family Guy Producer Seth MacFarlane left a crowd of students
laughing after his talk last night in Mem Aud.
Describing FCC regulations —
which skyrocketed after the Janet
Jackson "wardrobe malfunction"
during the 2004 Super Bowl — he
told the audience that much of the
scrutiny placed on network shows fo
cuses on the amount of inappropriate
language, as well as "shit jokes."
And for all the heat FOX took for
canceling "Family Guy" in 2002 be
fore subsequently reinstating it in
2005 following successes on Cartoon
Network and in DVD sales. MacFar
lane said that he often has the net
work's support in terms of content.
"TTiey are very much on our side,"
he said of FOX. noting that the free
speech battle against conservative
and family advocacy groups "is only

going to get worse.
As a surprise treat, MacFarlane of
fered the audience a look at an unfin
ished episode of "Family Guy" that
will air next year.
When asked about Internet piracy
during the question-and-answer ses
sion. MacFarlane neither condemned
nor condoned the downloading of
complete episodes online.
"It's a fact of life at this point," he
said, noting the show's Internet
savvy audience. "It's a good thing
and a bad thing. The moment that it
stops, we should start to worry."
The "South Park" controversy,
which came up numerous times dur
ing the talk and question-and-an
swer session, stems from two
episodes that aired earlier this
month, which lampooned "Family
Guy" and included a scene where its
writers are depicted as manatees.
Introducing MacFarlane, Direc
tor of the ASSU Speakers Bureau

Adam Kahn, a graduate student in
communication, expressed gratitude
for the fortunate timing of the event.
"Four days ago our speaker was
accused of being a manatee," he said.
"After dinner, I can assure you that
he's not a manatee."
MacFarlane took his show's crit
icism with the candor of a fellow
satirist.
"They shit on everybody like we
do," he said, adding that to cry foul
would be "hypocritical."
"It was great," said Kahn. "I've
never heard Memorial Auditorium
laugh so loud."
The ASSU Speakers Bureau con
tinues its series next Monday with
Palestinian democratic activist Dr.
Mustafa Barghouti, and Wednesday
with former U.S. Senator and vice
presidential candidate John Ed
wards. Both events will take place at
7:30 p.m. in Kresge Auditorium on
their respective dates.
