## Morris, Beardman provide the spark in Saturday's 2-1, nine-inning thriller; Cal takes series opener, 8-0 
### ANDREW LOMELI STAFF WRITER 
Senior outfielder Catalina Morris

The pressure couldn't have been
worse for Morris Saturday, facing a 0-
2 count with two outs in the bottom
the seventh and the No. 6 Stanford
softball team trailing No. 5 Califor
nia. 1-0. With the stadium's mixed
crowd holding a collective breath,
one more pitch would arrive just out
side the strike zone, making the
count 1-2.
The next hurl would arrive per
fectly for Morris, who knocked a
double to left field to score sopho
more second baseman Tricia Ag
gabao and even the score at 1-1.
And in the ninth, rightfielder
Anna Beardman stroked a single to
center field, scoring pinch runner
Shoney Hixson, and giving the Car
dinal (31-8,5-4 Pac-10) the 2-1 vic
tory.
"I just knew I had to put some
thing in play," Morris said. "The um
pire had a big strike zone all day, but
I wasn't scared. I just took it as a chal
lenge, because I knew I could do it."
Third baseman Katie Vickers
drove in second baseman Emily
Friedman in the sixth for Cal's (36-6,
5-3) only run.
Leftfielder Jackie Rinehart led off
the Cardinal half of the ninth with a

single, later advancing to second off
an Aggabao sacrifice bunt. Shortstop
Lauren Lappin struck out to end the
inning, setting the stage for Beard
man's single.
Stanford threatened in the bot
tom of the sixth with runners on sec
ond and third and only one out, but
Cal ace Kristina Thorson would
strikeout both Missy Penna and Erin
Howe to end the inning.
Stanford's Laura Severson tallied
six strikeouts, seven hits and two
walks in nine innings Thorson threw
eight and a third, surrendering ten
hits and no walks while collecting ten
strikeouts.
"I knew we could do it if we got
someone on base" Coach John
Rittman said. "We battled all day
long, and Anna Beardman and
Catalina [Morris] did a great job.
Catalina's just been such a great
clutch hitter all season."
The Cardinal then dealt a 4-2 de
feat to Cal in the second half of the
afternoons doubleheader.
The Cardinal nailed two runs in
the third and one in the fifth to go
ahead for good. The Bears offered
a major threat in the seventh with the
bases loaded, but catcher Haley
Woods lined out to short to finish the
game.
Morgon Siegel drove in Emily
Friedman in the top of the first to es
tablish an early 1-0 Cal lead, but
Stanford responded quickly, tying
the score in the bottom of the inning,
though leaving the bases loaded.
