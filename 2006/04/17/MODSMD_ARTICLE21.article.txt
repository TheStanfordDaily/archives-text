# New Orleans' tough times
## 
### 
As both the NHL and NBA
regular seasons come to a
close and the NFL draft ap
proaches, 1 have my thoughts far be
yond this year's sporting minutia.
In fact, my attention was directed
to the New Orleans Hornets, who
did not wear the traditional "New
Orleans" across their chest for their
last "home" game of the season. In
deed, they did not even wear the
more contemporary, city-neutral
"Hornets." No, for this occasion they
unveiled a brand new "Oklahoma
City" jersey.
This raises the question, what
does the future hold for sports in
New Orleans?
Well, both the Saints and the
Hornets have committed to return
ing next season to the city that was
destroyed by Hurricane Katrina
over half a year ago. Both franchise
owners agree that it would be unfair
not to give the city a chance to prove
how excited it really is about sports
after having lost everything else.
The owners do, however, agree that
after next season their teams' future
is uncertain.
The Saints are probably in the
worst shape. The team has been sell
ing less than fifty percent of the Su
perdome's seating capacity to sea
son ticket holders â€” a third less
than the record sales a couple of
years prior. And this was before the
hurricane struck.
After Katrina, any potential for a
revitalized market has virtually dis
appeared. Even if you ignore the
considerable loss in population, the
citizens of New Orleans are just not
likely to invest in season tickets in
favor of rebuilding their living room.
And speaking of rebuilding, the
Superdome is going to take $140
million to repair and another $135
million to renovate if the Saints were
to commit to a long-term deal. $275
million would be a high cost to re
coup in New York, let alone devas
tated New Orleans.
Meanwhile, during the 2005-2(X)6
season, the Saints split home games
between San Antonio and Baton
Rouge. But with the NFL looking to
try to reintroduce football into Los
Angeles for 2008, the forty-year-old
New Orleans franchise is a prime
candidate for the move.
The Hornets, who had the NBAs
worst attendance record before the
storm, are in an even tougher situa
tion.

The Turnaround
team's attendance has actually aver
aged a respectable 18,704, over a
30% increase from its pitiful show
ing in its old home, the New Orleans
Arena, which actually survived the
storm relatively unharmed.
But let's face it: neither the Saints
nor the Hornets are really what dis
tinguish the city of New Orleans in
the world of sports. It's the Super
dome's six Super Bowls, four Final
Fours and thirty-one Sugar Bowls
that remind us of New Orleans' rich
history when it comes to national
championships.
No more.
When bids for future Super
Bowls and Final Fours were handed
out this past year. New Orleans was
overlooked, leaving them in the dust

until at least 2012. This would mean
at least a ten-year gap when the city
would host neither of these events,
more than twice their previous
record of four years.
And now, a new all-encompassing
BCS Bowl likely means that even if
the city were to continue to host the
Sugar Bowl, it would never host an
NCAA football national title game
again.
The future looks bleak for this
city in the ruins, and it does not help
that the major economic boosts that
these events normally provide will
no longer saturate the city in
tourists' money.
Oh. well. We can dream that one
day New Orleans will be rebuilt into
the American sports capital it once
was. But. realistically, don't be ex
pecting to see it on ESPN anytime
soon.
