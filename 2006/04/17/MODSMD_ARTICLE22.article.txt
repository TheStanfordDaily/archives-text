# Women's water polo rallies against No. 3 UCLA, but falls 9-8 in overtime
## 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
Riding the momentum of a seven-game
winning streak, Stanford women's water
polo headed south this weekend to take on
perennial rival UCLA. It had been more
than a month since the Cardinal's last loss (a
7-6 defeat at Southern California on March
9), and the Stanford women were looking to
close out their regular season campaign with
an emphatic flourish against the 2005 na
tional champion Bruins.
But unfortunately for the No. 2 Cardinal
(18-4, 9-2 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion), the No. 3 Bruins had other plans. An
incredible Stanford second-half comeback
tied the score at 7-all, and sent the game to
overtime. There, though, the Bruins clinched
the 9-8 decision with two quick strikes to
start the extra period.
But even in the wake of their bitter defeat,
the Stanford women retained an optimistic
perspective — that although tough to swal
low, this weekend's loss would only strength
en them for bigger games still to come this
year.
"Right now. we are in the "third quarter"
of our season," junior goalie Meridith Mc-
Coll said. "Our game on Saturday was in
dicative of our trajectory in this sense — we
get better in the third quarter, and better still
in the fourth. We integrate and overcome.
And with this experience, we can learn, re
fine, and change the minutia so that at the
end of our season, we will be on top."
On Saturday against the Bruins, the Car
dinal seemed poised to win in dramatic fash
ion. The two teams played evenly at the out
set of the match, but after junior two-meter
defender Alison Gregorka opened the sec
ond period with a power-play tip-in goal that
gave Stanford a 2-1 lead, UCLA stormed
back with three unanswered scores to take a
commanding 4-2 lead into the half.
The Bruins continued their run after the
break, as freshman Anne Belden found the
back of the cage to stretch the UCLA advan

tage to three goals.
To most other teams, a three-goal deficit
against a squad featuring four Olympic ath
letes might seem insurmountable. But the
Cardinal never counted themselves out. and
they slowly managed to pull themselves
back into the game.
First senior captain Laurel Champion re
sponded to bring Stanford back within two,
and then junior driver Katie Hansen fired a
four-meter penalty shot past UCLA keeper
Emily Feher to close the gap to 5-4.The Bru
ins rebuilt their lead to two when Kristina
Kunkel recorded her second goal of the
match, but the Cardinal continued their rally
in the final period of play.

Gregorka, junior two-meter Christina
Hewko and sophomore Jacquelyn Gauthier
combined to produce three consecutive goals
that not only completed the comeback, but
also gave the Cardinal their first lead of the
day. 7-6, with 1:33 remaining.
To preserve the win, the Stanford women
needed to hold that lead for 1:33 minutes.
But against one of the premier offensive
teams in the nation, 93 seconds is an eternity
— and the Cardinal found out the hard way.
The Stanford women fell just 12.6 seconds
short of their bid to defeat the powerful Bru
ins for the second time this season.as UCLA's
Jillian Kraus knotted the score at seven apiece
on her squad's last-chance possession.

Kraus' goal not only tied the score — it
swung the momentum of the entire game as
well. The Bruins exploded for two quick
goals in the first overtime period, and the
Cardinal were only able to answer once be
fore the final buzzer sounded.
Even in the loss, though, the Cardinal
demonstrated once again their incredible
tenacity and ability to compete at the highest
level — especially in fighting from behind.
"This game against UCLA tells us a lot
about our team," McColl said."lt adds to our
repertoire. Against the best teams, we have
known what it is like to dominate a whole
game. We have also known what is like to be
ahead and fall behind. We now know what it
is like to be behind and comeback. The final
step is to finish the game off."
"We fought back hard in the third and
fourth quarters, but we made some errors
that cost us the game in the end," McColl
added. "But [this game] did show an impor
tant truth about our team — that all other
variables are irrelevant when we play our
game. [Nothing] can stop us when we focus
and play Stanford Water Polo. We need to
own this truth, and be deliberate about it.
And no matter what the clock or score says,
we know that we have the potential, the skill,
and the heart to win."
