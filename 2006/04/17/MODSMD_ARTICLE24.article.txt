# Men's tennis sweeps Arizonas
## 
### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team couldn't have
asked for a better close to its regular home season,
or a better way to send off its seniors on Senior
Day. The No. 12 Cardinal (14-3,5-1 Pac-10) went
2-0 this weekend at the Taube Family Tennis Sta
dium against the Arizona schools, and didn't give
up a single match on the weekend.
"It's nice for our guys to win matches like
that," Coach John Whitlinger said. "It just shows
that we're starting to get ready for the tournament
down the road. I was really pleased with the effort,
especially the play down at 4,5, and 6 [singles]."
Trying to avenge a loss to the Sun Devils earli
er this season in March, Stanford faced Arizona
State (8-13,2-4) on Saturday afternoon.The Card
started off strong and the Sun Devils looked like
they never stood a chance. After doubles was not
played due to weather, five of the six singles
matches started off with service breaks in favor of
Stanford, getting the home team off to a fast and
dominant start.
Freshman Blake Muller, sophomore Phil Kao
and senior Jon Wong all quickly won their first
sets, 6-1, at the final three singles spots. Mean
while, No. 24 senior KC Corkery and junior James
Pade won their first sets, 6-2, at the top two singles
positions.
As most of the singles matches were beginning
or well into the second set, junior James Wan,
playing at the third singles spot, found himself
down a break at 2-4 in the first set. Wan fought
back to even the score at 4-all and then went up 5-
4. Just as Wan claimed the first set 7-5, Muller had
blanked his opponent in the second set to com
plete his 6-1,6-0 defeat of ASU's Wes Miller.
Shortly after Muller, Wong finished his slightly
closer second set to earn a 6-1,6-4 win and the sec
ond point for the Cardinal.
"Jon stepped up and I'm really proud of him,"
Whitlinger said after Wong jumped into the sin
gles lineup in the absence of freshman Matt
Bruch. "You need guys like that, [who] at the last
second are ready to go. I can't say enough about
Jon and how he's done, especially in the last three
matches — the third one being a very important
win for us down [at USC]."
Kao picked up the third point for Stanford
with yet another straight-set victory at 6-1, 6-3.
ASU's Jonathan Kinsella managed to steal the
second set from Corkery at 6-3, so a third set
began on Court 1. At the same time, on Court 2,
Pade earned a break at the beginning of the sec
ond set and maintained the lead to eventually win
the second set and the match, sealing the win for
Stanford.
Fueled by cheering family and friends, Corkery
earned a break relatively early in the final set of
his match to go up 3-1. On Corkery's match-point,
Kinsella sliced a backhand into the net to give the
Stanford captain the win and Stanford's fifth

point of the day.
All eyes then turned to Court 3 where Wan's
match would determine whether Stanford would
score its second consecutive shutout. After giving
up the second set 4-6, Wan claimed the super
tiebreaker to finish the Cardinal's blemish-free
weekend.
Although the start to Friday's match against
Arizona (11-9,2-4) wasn't nearly as dominating as
Saturday's, the end result was equally impressive.
Friday's shutout began with singles play and the
same lineup as Saturday's. The initial games of all
six singles matches remained on serve, with Kao
earning the first break to go up 4-2 and eventual
ly win the first set 6-3. Muller soon followed suit
and earned a break as well before closing out the
first 6-4.
Leading 3-2 and on serve with No. 43 Roger
Matalonga, Corkery stretched for a drop shot vol
ley. After winning that point and a couple more,
Corkery earned the break to go up 4-2 and main
tained the lead, closing out the first set, 6-3, with a
passing shot.
Pade and Wan won their first sets 7-5, and
Wong was the only Stanford player to give up the
first set of his match, 6-7.
With a set under his belt, Kao made quick work
of his opponent in the second set, 6-1, and earned
the first point for the Card. Corkery picked up the
second win for Stanford without giving up a single
game in the second set. Muller was next off with
his 6-4,6-4 victory.
As Stanford continued to display its domi
nance, the only question left was who would win
the clinching match for the Cardinal. On adjacent
courts, Pade and Wan both won 7-5,7-5 victories.
Pade ultimately claimed the decisive point, and
Wong and Wan's victories followed. After losing
the first set, Wong came back to pick up the sec
ond and final sets to contribute to the sweep of
singles.
With the win secured, Stanford appeared at
ease in doubles and swept all three matches. No.
13 Corkery and Pade won an 8-2 victory, and the
freshman pairing of Matt Bruch and Muller won
8-6. After a neck-and-neck set, sophomore Chris
Rasmussen and junior Dave Ryan earned a 9-8
win to round out Friday's competition.
As the weekend came to a close following Sat
urday's match, a special ceremony was held to
honor the team's two seniors, Corkery and Wong.
While Saturday's match was the final regular
season match that the seniors play at home, the
whole team will face No. 24 California next Satur
day in Berkeley. Because No. 7 UCLA (16-5,5-1)
fell to No. 20 Washington (17-4,4-1) on Saturday,
Stanford now has a shot of sharing the Pac-10 title.
"Basically, on Saturday, we're playing for the
Pac-10 championship," Whitlinger said. "We're
playing over at Cal, and they're playing for the
same thing. It makes for a very exciting and inter
esting match. One of our goals was winning the
Pac-10 title, and now we have a chance for that."
The Stanford men's tennis team couldn't have

Stanford now has a shot of sharing the Pac-10 title.
"Basically, on Saturday, we're playing for the
Pac-10 championship," Whitlinger said. "We're
playing over at Cal, and they're playing for the
same thing. It makes for a very exciting and inter
esting match. One of our goals was winning the
Pac-10 title, and now we have a chance for that."
The Stanford men's tennis team couldn't have
asked for a better close to its regular home season,
or a better way to send off its seniors on Senior
Day. The No. 12 Cardinal (14-3,5-1 Pac-10) went
2-0 this weekend at the Taube Family Tennis Sta
dium against the Arizona schools, and didn't give
up a single match on the weekend.
"It's nice for our guys to win matches like
that," Coach John Whitlinger said. "It just shows
that we're starting to get ready for the tournament
down the road. I was really pleased with the effort,
especially the play down at 4,5, and 6 [singles]."
Trying to avenge a loss to the Sun Devils earli
er this season in March, Stanford faced Arizona
State (8-13,2-4) on Saturday afternoon.The Card
started off strong and the Sun Devils looked like
they never stood a chance. After doubles was not
played due to weather, five of the six singles
matches started off with service breaks in favor of
Stanford, getting the home team off to a fast and
dominant start.
Freshman Blake Muller, sophomore Phil Kao
and senior Jon Wong all quickly won their first
sets, 6-1, at the final three singles spots. Mean
while, No. 24 senior KC Corkery and junior James
Pade won their first sets, 6-2, at the top two singles
positions.
As most of the singles matches were beginning
or well into the second set, junior James Wan,
playing at the third singles spot, found himself
down a break at 2-4 in the first set. Wan fought
back to even the score at 4-all and then went up 5-
4. Just as Wan claimed the first set 7-5, Muller had
blanked his opponent in the second set to com
plete his 6-1,6-0 defeat of ASU's Wes Miller.
Shortly after Muller, Wong finished his slightly
closer second set to earn a 6-1,6-4 win and the sec
ond point for the Cardinal.
"Jon stepped up and I'm really proud of him,"
Whitlinger said after Wong jumped into the sin
gles lineup in the absence of freshman Matt
Bruch. "You need guys like that, [who] at the last
second are ready to go. I can't say enough about
Jon and how he's done, especially in the last three
matches — the third one being a very important
win for us down [at USC]."
Kao picked up the third point for Stanford
with yet another straight-set victory at 6-1, 6-3.
ASU's Jonathan Kinsella managed to steal the
second set from Corkery at 6-3, so a third set
began on Court 1. At the same time, on Court 2,
Pade earned a break at the beginning of the sec
ond set and maintained the lead to eventually win
the second set and the match, sealing the win for
Stanford.
Fueled by cheering family and friends, Corkery
earned a break relatively early in the final set of
his match to go up 3-1. On Corkery's match-point,
Kinsella sliced a backhand into the net to give the
Stanford captain the win and Stanford's fifth

point of the day.
All eyes then turned to Court 3 where Wan's
match would determine whether Stanford would
score its second consecutive shutout. After giving
up the second set 4-6, Wan claimed the super
tiebreaker to finish the Cardinal's blemish-free
weekend.
Although the start to Friday's match against
Arizona (11-9,2-4) wasn't nearly as dominating as
Saturday's, the end result was equally impressive.
Friday's shutout began with singles play and the
same lineup as Saturday's. The initial games of all
six singles matches remained on serve, with Kao
earning the first break to go up 4-2 and eventual
ly win the first set 6-3. Muller soon followed suit
and earned a break as well before closing out the
first 6-4.
Leading 3-2 and on serve with No. 43 Roger
Matalonga, Corkery stretched for a drop shot vol
ley. After winning that point and a couple more,
Corkery earned the break to go up 4-2 and main
tained the lead, closing out the first set, 6-3, with a
passing shot.
Pade and Wan won their first sets 7-5, and
Wong was the only Stanford player to give up the
first set of his match, 6-7.
With a set under his belt, Kao made quick work
of his opponent in the second set, 6-1, and earned
the first point for the Card. Corkery picked up the
second win for Stanford without giving up a single
game in the second set. Muller was next off with
his 6-4,6-4 victory.
As Stanford continued to display its domi
nance, the only question left was who would win
the clinching match for the Cardinal. On adjacent
courts, Pade and Wan both won 7-5,7-5 victories.
Pade ultimately claimed the decisive point, and
Wong and Wan's victories followed. After losing
the first set, Wong came back to pick up the sec
ond and final sets to contribute to the sweep of
singles.
With the win secured, Stanford appeared at
ease in doubles and swept all three matches. No.
13 Corkery and Pade won an 8-2 victory, and the
freshman pairing of Matt Bruch and Muller won
8-6. After a neck-and-neck set, sophomore Chris
Rasmussen and junior Dave Ryan earned a 9-8
win to round out Friday's competition.
As the weekend came to a close following Sat
urday's match, a special ceremony was held to
honor the team's two seniors, Corkery and Wong.
While Saturday's match was the final regular
season match that the seniors play at home, the
whole team will face No. 24 California next Satur
day in Berkeley. Because No. 7 UCLA (16-5,5-1)
fell to No. 20 Washington (17-4,4-1) on Saturday,
Stanford now has a shot of sharing the Pac-10 title.
"Basically, on Saturday, we're playing for the
Pac-10 championship," Whitlinger said. "We're
playing over at Cal, and they're playing for the
same thing. It makes for a very exciting and inter
esting match. One of our goals was winning the
Pac-10 title, and now we have a chance for that."
