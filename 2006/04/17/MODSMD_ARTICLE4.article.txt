## Quake Centennial tomorrow Researchers find 60 percent chance of 6.7 quake to hit Bay within 30 years 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
Those living on the Pacific coast do so at their own
risk, with the implicit understanding that earth
quakes are a fact of life. Perhaps it's a tradeoff for the
nice weather.
Earthquakes are a challenge to human existence,
a reminder of nature's power over humanity. Periods
of relative calm and serenity are interrupted by mas
sive ruptures of the Earth's crust.
A hundred years ago tomorrow, a magnitude 7.8
earthquake wreaked havoc on the San Andreas Fault.
The shakes nearly flattened the city of San Francisco
and a budding university called Stanford. Thousands
died and resulting fires only made matters worse.
Scientists have made great strides in their re
search since 1906, yet still acknowledge how much

remains unknown about the
intricacies of these phenom
ena. No one knows for sure
if earthquakes are pre
dictable. But experts i
agree: no one is complete- '
ly safe. No building can be
made earthquake-proof —
only resistant.

On the eve of the Great San
Francisco earthquake's centenni-

al, scientists told The Daily it's not a matter of
whether another cataclysmic earthquake will occur;
it's a matter of when.
A severe earthquake in the Bay Area could rival
the damage inflicted by Hurricane Katrina on New
Orleans last August. Today, there are 10 times more
people living in the Bay Area than 100 years ago.
"We are talking about a Katrina-style human
tragedy," said Earth Sciences Prof. Mark Zoback.
"It's not going to be pleasant. It's going to be hard to

get help in.
"People are going to have to sub
sist on their own in the aftermath of
an earthquake," he continued. "Their
houses might not be saved. Hun
dreds of thousands of people might
be affected."
"Big earthquakes are absolutely
unavoidable," said Geophysics Prof.
Greg Beroza. "The question is what
the probability is over what time
frame."
The US Geological Survey
(USGS) calculated a 62 percent
probability for at least one magni
tude 6.7 or greater quake between
2003 and 2032 in the Bay Area. This
is roughly the size of the 1994 North
ridge earthquake, which killed 51
and injured more than 9,000 people
in the Los Angeles area.
There are seven faults near Stan
ford — and a rupture along any one
could impact the University and its
operations.
Faults form where tectonic plates
converge, and earthquakes happen
when the strain on a faultline be
comes unsustainable. Aftershocks
occur as the two plates (Pacific and
North American) regain equilibrium:
earthquakes relieve some of that
pent-up stress. The next big quake
does not usually happen on a faultline
until the tension has built up again.
Earthquakes influence one an
other. The 1906 and 1989 quakes re
duced stress on parallel faults. The
longer a large, active fault goes with
out a major quake, the more concern
that the next one will be even more
destructive.
According to Zoback, a repeat on
the San Andreas with 1906-like mag
nitude is fairly unlikely anytime
soon.
"The fault slipped so much that it
will take more time to build up the
energy needed to cause another," he
said. "There is still ample reason for
concern and worry. The real concern
in the San Francisco Bay Area is that
there is a suite of faults."
"Loma Prieta [the 7.9 earthquake
in 1989 centered south of Stanford]
was a good wake-up call," he added.
"It showed some of the vulnerabili
ty"
The Hayward Fault, which runs
under Fremont on the other side of
the San Francisco Bay, is due for a

significant quake, according to
Mary Lou Zoback, research scien
tist with the USGS Earthquakes
Hazards Team. The last four major
earthquakes on the fault were sepa
rated by 130 to 150 years. The most
recent major event occurred 138
years ago, in 1868.
Seismologists at Lawrence Liver
more National Laboratory told The
San Jose Mercury News that the dam
age caused by a quake could cause
"over 1,000 fatalities ajid hundreds of
billions of dollars of damage."
Economic losses may exceed $ 122
billion, engineers from the Earth
quake Engineering Research Insti
tute stated in a report released this
week. Potential consequences in a
worst-case scenario for the next big
quake along the San Andreas Fault
include 3,400 dead, 12,500 seriously
injured. 10,000 commercial buildings
unusable and 245,000 households
displaced. The Mercury News re
ported yesterday that the models
used by these scientists are seen as a
scientific breakthrough.
Shelter
A repeat of a 1906-range earth
quake could create 60,000 to 150,000
displaced households in the Bay Area,
Mary Lou Zoback told a Stanford au
dience during a January' lecture.
San Francisco's building stock is
particularly vulnerable, as more than
84 percent of buildings were con
structed before 1970. She said that 65
percent of San Francisco households
are rented, meaning there is less in
centive for maintenance and capital
improvement projects.
San Francisco has a very unique
building style that is particularly bad
in an earthquake-prone region, Mark
Zoback added. Having a garage on
the first floor causes "a real high
probability of collapse," he said.
Rent control, a scheme to help
make housing more affordable in
San Francisco, could cause more
deaths when the next big one strikes.
Since landlords cannot increase
rents with the market, owners have
little reason to make costly invest
ments in seismic retrofitting.
"Rent control works against
retrofitting," Mark Zoback said. A
building owner who would be re
sponsible by way of upgrading their

building has no way to recover the
cost."
The city of San Francisco re
sponded to this unintended conse
quence with an ordinance exempting
units built after 1990 from rent con
trol. Even so. 71 percent of San Fran
cisco homes remain rent controlled.
Water
Areas with high water tables and
sandy soil are inherently at risk.
Structures built on this weak foun
dation are prone to soil liquefaction.
"Earthquakes can take away all
the strength and stability of soil,"
Civil and Environmental Engineer
ing Prof. Helmut Krawinkler said.
"Buildings can sink into the soil."
This problem raises concern
about the possible rupture of the lev
ees that bring much of the Bay
Area's water from the Hetch Hetchy
Reservoir, built in 1934. In New Or
leans, the city's problems multiplied
when the levees burst follwing the
initial hurricane. Hetch Hetchy
crosses at least five active faults and
travels just west of campus on its 167-
mile route. Most of Santa Clara
County's water comes from this sys
tem.
If strong shaking causes liquefac
tion and collapse here, Mark Zoback
predicts floods and a loss of drinking
water for 22 million Californians.
"An earthquake right now would
be devastating because of the vul
nerabilities of the levies to shaking."
he said. "There would be flooding in
the delta, which would affect lots of
people."
A 2002 report released by the Bay
Area Economic Forum found that
key structural assessments, mainte
nance and upgrades have been de
ferred for decades. There are few
contingency plans for the at-risk fa
cilities.
Remembering the danger
Krawinkler said that tomorrow's
anniversary is an important re
minder that the Bay Area is not im
mune from devastating disaster.
"Nobody talks about earth
quakes until they come," he said.
"We do have a really severe earth
quake problem in California. It's
very important to make the public
aware of the risk."
