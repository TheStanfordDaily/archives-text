Those living on the Pacific coast do so at their own
risk, with the implicit understanding that earth
quakes are a fact of life. Perhaps it's a tradeoff for the
nice weather.
Earthquakes are a challenge to human existence,
a reminder of nature's power over humanity. Periods
of relative calm and serenity are interrupted by mas
sive ruptures of the Earth's crust.
A hundred years ago tomorrow, a magnitude 7.8
earthquake wreaked havoc on the San Andreas Fault.
The shakes nearly flattened the city of San Francisco
and a budding university called Stanford. Thousands
died and resulting fires only made matters worse.
Scientists have made great strides in their re
search since 1906, yet still acknowledge how much

remains unknown about the
intricacies of these phenom
ena. No one knows for sure
if earthquakes are pre
dictable. But experts i
agree: no one is complete- '
ly safe. No building can be
made earthquake-proof â€”
only resistant.

On the eve of the Great San
Francisco earthquake's centenni-

al, scientists told The Daily it's not a matter of
whether another cataclysmic earthquake will occur;
it's a matter of when.
A severe earthquake in the Bay Area could rival
the damage inflicted by Hurricane Katrina on New
Orleans last August. Today, there are 10 times more
people living in the Bay Area than 100 years ago.
"We are talking about a Katrina-style human
tragedy," said Earth Sciences Prof. Mark Zoback.
"It's not going to be pleasant. It's going to be hard to
