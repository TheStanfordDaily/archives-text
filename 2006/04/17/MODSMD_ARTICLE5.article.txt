after hearing the results, he clapped for the
winners and walked out. Vice-presidential

students voted this year and we saw a
30 percent increase in voter turnout."
Upon hearing the news, the
Chappie's candidates became visibly
angry. Their platform had called for
mandatory curfews on the graduate
student population and the burning
of Crothers Hall.
Heng with Graham defeated
Rillera/Nguyen by more than a thou
sand second-round votes. An elated
I ieng described some of their imme
diate plans.
"1 am so surprised," she said. "I
think it's going to be a great year.
We're going to start working imme
diately on Nominations Commission
(NomCom) and all the administra
tive responsibilities."
Hie class president results also
drew much applause from the audi
ence. In the closest race, the sopho
more presidential slate Golden Tick
et beat the second-place Cure slate

by just 520 to 368 in the third round
of voting. The other two races had
wider margins of victory.
Reports of election violations
arose last night as a number of stu
dent groups campaigned during the
voting period. Most notably, the
Rillera/Nguyen slate sent an unso
licited campaign email to approxi
mately 300 house hosts (HoHos) on
Thursday.
These actions will not impact the
results or the validity of the elec
tions, Sanders remarked during his
presentation.
When asked about the
Rillera/Nguyen slate's campaign vi
olations, Heng discussed the effects
of the controversy.
"The whole compromise sur
rounding that situation happened
after the fact," she said. "It was more
about the principle than the actual
votes themselves."
Sanders touched on the issue be
fore releasing the votes with an allu
sion to the Chicago Daily Tribune's
false reporting of the presiden
tial election. After releasing the re
sults, Sanders discussed the situation

in an interview with The Daily.
"Hie main thing an election's
commissioner needs to have is a fair
election," he said. "My primary con
cern was to come up with a solution
that was fair. The Lee/Mufford inci
dent of two years ago was in the front
of my mind. That's why I came up
with a policy before the polls closed."
When asked about possible puni
tive actions to be taken against the
Rillera/Nguyen slate, Sanders said
he lacks the ability to censure the
candidates.
"That's one of the great things
about the ASSU," he said. "There is a
separation of powers."
Sanders also refused to release in
formation regarding the number of
vote retractions received following
the email dispute.
"That sort of information is confi
dential," he said. "It would be almost
like revealing their names."
Though Sanders was confident in
the fairness of the elections, others
were dissatisfied. Sound and the
Fury Presidential Candidate Allan
Phillips, a junior, expressed his dis
gust with the election process.
