All but one special-fees group on the
ballot received the minimum threshold to
attain funding. Elections Commissioner
and law student Tim Sanders told about 200
people gathered at the Coffee House
(CoHo) just after 5 p.m. Friday.
With higher than expected turnout in the
election, 35 of the 36 student groups apply
ing for special-fees funding met the 50 per
cent threshold. Innovative Student Informa
tion Services (ISIS), the group that oversees
the TV-based advertisements around cam
pus, came in just three votes shy of receiving
funding.The Axe Committee passed by only
14 votes with 50.3 percent of the vote.
The vote was also close in the race for the
Undergraduate Senate, in which the top-15

vote getters claimed a seat. The difference
between 15th and 16th place was three
votes, Sanders said.
Minority group leaders claimed victory
in the election.The Students of Color Coali
tion [SOCC] endorsed minority candidates
and mobilized members to support each
other. Ten of the candidates endorsed by
race-based coalitions were elected, includ
ing the executive slate, and each of its
groups won special-fees funding.
"This is a complete victory for the
SOCC," said Diego Martin, co-chair of the
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan
