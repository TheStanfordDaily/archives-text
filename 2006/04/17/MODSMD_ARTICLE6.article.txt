# Minority groups sweep election
## 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
All but one special-fees group on the
ballot received the minimum threshold to
attain funding. Elections Commissioner
and law student Tim Sanders told about 200
people gathered at the Coffee House
(CoHo) just after 5 p.m. Friday.
With higher than expected turnout in the
election, 35 of the 36 student groups apply
ing for special-fees funding met the 50 per
cent threshold. Innovative Student Informa
tion Services (ISIS), the group that oversees
the TV-based advertisements around cam
pus, came in just three votes shy of receiving
funding.The Axe Committee passed by only
14 votes with 50.3 percent of the vote.
The vote was also close in the race for the
Undergraduate Senate, in which the top-15

vote getters claimed a seat. The difference
between 15th and 16th place was three
votes, Sanders said.
Minority group leaders claimed victory
in the election.The Students of Color Coali
tion [SOCC] endorsed minority candidates
and mobilized members to support each
other. Ten of the candidates endorsed by
race-based coalitions were elected, includ
ing the executive slate, and each of its
groups won special-fees funding.
"This is a complete victory for the
SOCC," said Diego Martin, co-chair of the
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan
(Ml ( ha).
Funding requests from the Asian Amer
ican Student Association, the Muslim Stu
dents Awareness Network (MSAN), the
Stanford NAACP chapter, the
African Student Association, Ameri
can Indian Organization, Black Stu
dent Union, El Mariachi Cardenal De
Stanford, Jewish Students Associa
tion and MF.Cha (not all part of
SOCC, hut all associated with campus
minority groups] each passed with 61
to 68 percent of the student body's
support, indicating that a consistent
bloc of similar voters supported each.
This year's lineup of winners
means students can expect a more
progressive ASSU agenda next year,
Marin said.
"We're going to continue our pro
gramming and even expand it," said
senior Mohammad Subeh, president
of MSAN. "We will make sure every
one knows about the Muslim world
and the issues that matter. The vote
shows that the [post Sept. 11) interest
is still there."
Non-minority campus group lead
ers also trumpeted their victories as
an indication that there is a pool of
support and interest in their respec
tive activities.
Jonathan Palley of the Stanford
Shakespeare Society, which garnered
support from 66 percent of under
graduate voters, said that he hopes the
win sends a message about student in
terest and commitment to the arts.
"There is no excess of performing
arts on campus," he said. "Our goal is
to increase the arts opportunities
available to students in the form of
more performances on campus."
A majority of undergraduates
voted to leave the Programming Pub
lications Fee unchanged. Students
had 9 options and the chance to vote
for up to a 20 percent increase or de
crease in the fee.
All the special-fees groups apply
ing for joint-group status, entitling
them to funding from graduate and
undergraduate fees, received healthy
majorities. These groups included
Club Sports, the ASSU Speakers Bu
reau, Flicks, KZSU and the News
Readership Program.
The Stanford Daily received 64 per
cent approval from the combined grad
uate and undergraduate population.
Some said they are unhappy that
not all of the jointly-funded, special
fee groups passed without majority
support from graduate student voters.
"The passage of the News Reader
ship Program, Flicks, and the Daily

when less then half of grad students
voted to be taxed for them is a serious
concern," said Graduate Student
Council (GSC) Funding Committee
Chair Adam L. Beberg.
Student Initiated Courses (SIC)
was the most supported undergradu
ate special-fees group, with 85 percent
of student support. l lbe Sexual Health
Peer Resource Center (SHPRC),
Stanford Undergraduate Research
Journal, undergraduate Club Sports
and Alternative Spring Break round
ed out the top five.
Cutting it close in the undergradu
ate group vote was The Stanford Pro
gressive, which passed with only 53
percent. Ihe Martial Arts Program
received 55 percent support.
The newly-elected senators said
they were excited to start their work.
Junior Valerie Villarreai finished
first in the Senate election. Her ex
citement was obvious as she said that
all the work in the days leading up to
the election had been worth it.
"Campaign week was very stress
ful," she said. "But it was rewarding to
get out and meet with the undergrad
uate student body."
Freshman Tomi Onatunde joked
that she will celebrate her triumph by
going to Disneyland. She reiterated
her campaign agenda to have more
dining halls open on weekends and
return to point-based dining.
The GSC winners were also an
nounced at the ceremony.
Fourteen GSC members — nine
from specific schools and five at-large
— were elected. The top vote winner
for the second year was current GSC
Co-Chair Jenny Allen, a second-year
law student.
Candidates for executive office
waited impatiently as the results for
special-fees funds, ballot initiatives,
the Senate and GSC were read first.
Students hooted and hollered as
the results were read. Some candi
dates and groups elicited more vocal
responses.
All three ballot measures received
majority support but only Graduate
Measure A, an initiative to increase
student fees,secured the two-thirds of
votes needed to pass. Ihe Graduate
Student Transportation Fee failed
with 58 percent. Undergraduate Mea
sure A, which would have raised the
Programming and Community Ser
vice General Fee by 10 percent, failed

with 65 percent.
"This gives us more money to give
to student groups next year, which
means there will be more for grad stu
dents to do around campus next year,"
Beberg said of Measure A's passage.
The Transportation Fee, only nar
rowly defeated, will most likely reap
pear on the ballot next year.
"It is impressive that [the trans
portation fee] got as close to passing
as it did," said GSC Council member
Hannah Scherer, from the School of
Earth Sciences. "The Graduate Stu
dent Transportation Board will be
formed this spring.This is a group that
will continue to work towards meet
ing the transportation needs of gradu
ate students. It will be up to them to
decide what the next steps will be."
"From talking to students who
have worked tirelessly on this issue,
they are still very encouraged and
plan to reintroduce this same ballot
measure next year," added Allen. "I
would encourage those interested in
this issue to come to a GSC meeting
and get involved with the new Gradu
ate Student Transportation Board."
Many at the event said turnout
seemed to make a difference in the
outcomes of the election. While over
all turnout was high, undergraduate
participation went down from last
year. In sum, 5,307 votes were cast,
with about 60 percent coming from
undergraduates.T\vice as many fresh
men voted as did seniors — each class
year had progressively lower turnout.
"We had a much larger voter
turnout this year than last year,"
Sanders said. "As far as I can tell, we
had the largest graduate student
turnout in the history of the election."
Sophomore Danny Arbeiter, re
elected to the Senate, called the grad
uate student turnout "really conse
quential." He said he hopes the trend
of more graduate student involve
ment in the ASSU continues.
Scherer said she thinks it will like
ly be the beginning of a trend. She at
tributed part of the increased gradu
ate student turnout to the ballot
measures.
"The GSC did a lot of work to raise
voter awareness and increase voter
turnout," she said. "The Transporta
tion Fee campaign committee also did
a great job of educating voters about
the fee and I think this contributed to
the high voter turnout."
