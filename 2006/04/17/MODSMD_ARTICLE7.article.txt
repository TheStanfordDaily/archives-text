## Ex-porn stars talk sex to Cubberley 
### BEN EPPLER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It's not often that 150 students gather to hear adult film
stars talk about sex, but the Stanford-hosted event "Back
stage with the Porn Stars" did just that â€” brought X-rated
movie actors Richard Pacheco and Nina Hartley to Cubber
ley Auditorium Saturday evening.
The event, co-sponsored by the Queer Straight Alliance,
the LGBT-CRCand the ASSU Speakers Bureau, served as
a fundraiser for the Tenderloin AIDS Foundation of San
Francisco.
"The subject tonight is sex," Pacheco declared bluntly at
the beginning of the talk.
The speakers recalled their experiences in the industry
with candor and. at times, self-deprecation. Their language
was colorful and unapologetic. To
kick off the event, Pacheco led the
audience in a repetition of call-and
response, beginning with the words
"zipper," "bra" and "bosom," and
moving on to increasingly risque vo
cabulary.
"If you don't like colored lan
guage, you should probably get the
fuck out now," he said, drawing
laughter from the crowd.
Pacheco informed the audience
that porn stars aren't that different
from everyone else. He told of his
first audition and meeting with his
potential co-stars.
"I wanted some of those bad girls
I'd heard so much about," he said.
But after getting to know them, he
said he realized "there are no X
rated people. It's just us."
Hartley gave advice to the girls
seeking male attention.
"Men are visual," she said. Joking
that "the feminist police are going to
shoot me," she advised women in the
audience to learn to walk in high
heels and swing their hips.
"When it's time for sex it's okay
to act sexist," she continued.
But the stars primarily preached a
message of acceptance and safe sex.
"It's okay to like whatever it is
you like," Hartley said, cautioning:
"Negotiate your behavior... You
have to set limits and stick to them
even when you feel aroused. You
have to keep yourself safe."
After speaking for more than an
hour-and-a-half, Hartley and
Pacheco took questions dealing with
sex workers' rights, pornography's
relation to violence against women
and AIDS.
Asked about what should be
done to combat the dangers prosti
tutes face in their line of work. Hart
ley argued, "The most important
thing for sex worker rights is decrim
inalization," and noted that prosti
tutes in dangerous situations cur
rently cannot turn to the authorities
for fear of being arrested.
Hartley also took issue with anti
porn feminists who seek to regulate
adult entertainment and who argue
that pornography causes misogyny,
stating,"l don't agree with their posi
tion that porn endangers women."
"Sex begets sex, violence begets
violence," she said. "[Violence

against women] is not the fault of
porn; it is a reaction in the culture to
repression."
Hartley admitted, "There is plen
ty of distasteful stuff out there that I
wouldn't watch," but both actors ar
gued against federal content regula
tions.
The stars also described their re
spective responses to the first hetero
sexual transmission of AIDS in 1984.
Pacheco withdrew from the in
dustry after hearing the news, while
Hartley remained active, saying,
"Risk reduction was fine with me."
She explained that the modern
porn industry requires monthly
STD checks for its employees and
that actors are actually safer than
the general population despite the
fact that only 20 percent of porn
films feature condoms.
Event sponsors were pleased
with the talk, which raised about
$410 for the AIDS foundation, said
Katy Yan, president of the QSA.
Megan Kelso, a senior whose
friendship with Pacheco's daughter
prompted her to organize the event
at Stanford, said she was pleased
with the way the speakers handled
the subject matter.

"I thought that the show was very
uplifting, with little gems of wisdom
that the speakers bestowed on us oc
casionally," Kelso told the Daily. "1
was happy that Richard and Nina
didn't dwell on serious issues and yet
didn't avoid them either."
"The audience that was there
seemed to have enjoyed themselves
a great deal and got a lot out of the
evening's discussions," Yan said.
"People stayed to chat with the
speakers and left talking about the
topics raised, and that's the best re
sult that I could have expected."
"We're very happy to have spon
sored this event," agreed Adam Kahn,
a master's student in communication
and director of the Speakers Bureau.
Asked why he attended, fresh
man Michael Hudson replied, "It
was kind of a novelty thing to go to a
talk by ex-porn stars, and also it was
for a good cause.
"They were encouraging more
sexual freedom, and as porn stars, of
course they'd be saying that," Hud
son continued. "But there's some
thing to what they're saying. How
can sex be evil and why do we have
to repress it, if without it we wouldn't
exist?"
