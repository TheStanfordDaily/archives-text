### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Association for In
ternational Development (SAID)
and the Graduate School of Business
(GSB) International Development
Club (GSB-ID) hosted on Saturday
the fourth-annual conference on in
ternational development, "Delivering
Education in Developing Countries:
Challenges and Priorities." As sug
gested by the event's title, the confer
ence focused on education in develop
ing countries and included a keynote
address by UNICEF's Chief of Edu
cation Cream Wright, two moderated
panels and a development fair.
"I thought the Conference was ex
cellent because it had some premier
speakers in the field and it provided a
good balance of policy discussion with
action." said conference attendee
Aneto Okonkwo, a senior.
Wright presented an overview of
the current status of education in de
veloping countries along with an
analysis of what tools one can use to
effect change and make progress.
"Inspired young people can
change the world," he said.
The first panel, "Challenges in
Education: Developing Effective
Educational Systems," explored the
current obstacles and possible ap-

proaches to providing for better ac
cess, quality and design of education
al institutions. Panelists included
Tanzanian Ambassador to the Unit
ed Nations Augustine Mahiga;
founder of the African Leadership
Academy Chris Bradford; and a
champion of educational opportuni
ties for men and women in
Afghanistan, Budd Mackenzie.
The second panel, "Funding and
Allocation: Prioritizing Educational
Goals," centered on how policymak
ers should balance and prioritize dif
ferent education goals. Panelists in
cluded Maya Ajmera, the founder of
the Global Fund for Children, and
Robert Prouty. the acting manager of
the Fast Track Initiative, a partner
ship working to provide quality pri
mary school programs to children
worldwide by 2015.
"We selected education and de
velopment because we believe that
education is a critical and often over
looked area of international devel
opment and because of the relevance
of the topic given our current role as
students," said second-year GSB stu
dent and Co-President of GSB-ID
Peter DeYoung, who also served as
one of three conference chairs.
Pallen Chiu. a senior and fellow
conference chair from SAID, be
lieves that education was selected as

the topic because it is a "cross-cutting
issue in development that is directly
pertinent to most if not all aspects of
development."
The event's lunchtime de
velopment fair incorporated 14 Bay
Area-based non-governmental or
ganizations (NGOs) — and for the
first time—l 9 Stanford develop
ment-related student groups offer
ing approximately 275 conference
attendees job. internship and volun
teering opportunities in internation
al development. The NGOs present
included the United States Agency
for International Development
(USAID), the World Bank, the
Global Fund for Children and the
Hewlett Foundation.
"SAID exists to connect people
interested in international develop
ment." said Conference Chair Mar
ilie Coetsee, a sophomore. "Adding
development-related student groups
to the fair was important both to con
nect groups to each other and con
nect students to groups. Many of the
group leaders who showed up to rep
resent their groups ended up talking
about each others work, which is just
what we had hoped would happen."
According to Chiu, "the partner
ship with Stanford student groups in
addition to NGOs was incredibly
successful."
