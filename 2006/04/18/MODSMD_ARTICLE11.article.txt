# The 						Review is decadent and depraved
## 
### 
Studying abroad gives you a strange, ter
rible perspective on life back at Stan
ford. ITie exotic becomes everyday, all
the bratwurst begins to taste the same, then 1
suddenly remember that 1 had a life on cam
pus, once. Then 1 think about what was "'nor
mal" and what now seems bizarre, alien,
ridiculous. Here are a few revelations I've
had about our glorious university from my
Prussian roost:
1: ITic Stanford Police are puritanical fas
cists. Why are our parties, even the rare good
ones, shut down at 1 a.m.? Who exactly are
we bothering? The graduate students out late
grading their section's problem sets? The
Faculty Row families whose dinner we're
paying for? The locals who bought a house
next to a university — what did they expect,
Socratic dialogue? We're a city-state unto
ourselves: Why is our curfew earlier than
Compton's? 1 understand a lot of cops are
decent people who let you off with a warning
when you're running naked on the Loop. But
that shouldn't be the exception. Our football
games are sparsely-attended enough, with
out the fear that some underground fuzz will
crash your tailgate, ask for a beer and then hit
you with an MIP Yeah, they get inventive
when they're tackling drunk students. Re
member the groper? Or the random spate of
Row house intruders? All the semi-pederasts
at Full Moon? Good job on the coke bust,
boys, now try catching someone who's not a
student.
2: The Stanford Review is decadent and
depraved.The recent non-controversies over
the door-to-door policy and their lame, ham

handed defense of the Stanford Indian is just
the latest in a long line of blandly objection
able issues which would be hilarious in a John
Kennedy Toole novel, but which are just
plain silly, and innocuous, in real life. Listen
guys, 1 enjoy hearing young upper middle
class white suburbanites defend a horrifical
iy insensitive ethnic slur as much as the next
guy (how about calling it "Trail of Tears" in
stead of "Smoke Signals"?), but you've got
the credibility of a televangelist with a sex
tape collection (which, of course, they all
have). Don't stop, though, life would be so
much less farcical without you.
3: Could Hoover tower please be renamed
after an alumnus who didn't preside over the
Great Frigging Depression? I remember my
AP U.S. History; I know he wasn't entirely to
blame. But if we're naming important build
ings after presidents who weren't entirely to
blame for catastrophic historical cluster
fucks, than where are the Polk Towers, the
Johnson Monuments, the Harding Memorial
Toilets? Try out these fiscally responsible
alumni: Steinbeck Tower. Witherspoon
Tower, Day O'Connor Tower. 1 get tingles.
4: The Administration needs to Man Up

about alcohol. Freshmen face the Discipli
nary Board if they leave their tiny halls to
party in their spacious lounges. The Band is
on a three-year alcohol probation. Insiders
report a five-year plan for eliminating the old
school frats (no. Sigma Nu. not you).The 750
Pub, surely the most innocuous drinking es
tablishment not featured on "Saved by the
Bell," is "considering" taking away their
drinks (I smell an administrative squeeze).
The Tree, once the symbol for our schools
wild Dada eccentricity, was kicked out for
being, of all things, drunk at a sporting event.
And then they did the same thing to the new
one, and he wasn't even (legally) drunk.
When did the bastion of liberalism become
Prohibition-Era Chicago? Meanwhile, Dart
mouth's unofficial mascot is Keggy the Keg.
Yes, we have an awesome resident assistant
system, but why can't everybody just chill?
Undergraduates like drinking; our parents
know this, we know this, even the most re
mote administrator knows this. However, 1
will admit one thing...
5: Stanford kids need to stop drinking like
fifth-graders. (Also true of most Americans).
Germans have beer all the time, but they
enjoy every last drop. They luxuriate in the
healing ambrosia of a Pilsener, their tongue
tickled by every tiny swallow of Hefeweizen.
True, they also like Beck's, but you get the
point. Meanwhile, Stanford chugs away on
Coors, Natty, the Vodka you mixed with Red
Bull so you wouldn't pass out in line for Sun
splash. Hell with the freshman alcohol policy;

6: Every Stanford party is exactly
the same. Everyone knows this, es
pecially that girl who spent half of
freshman year in Sigma Chi, and
now spends her weekends in San
Francisco with the McSweeney's
crowd. Her and her ilk have the
same complaints: parties are too
packed, too loud and have too many

freshmen. Guess what kids: every
party everywhere is the same. Every
club plays pretty much the same
music (unless it's a techno club, and
music all sounds the same on E any
ways). Somewhere, that mythic club
with hot chicks everywhere (and
sensitive guys or metrosexuals or
whatever women want these days)
does exist, but you're not cool or rich
enough to go. If you are, you're a
douche bag. Face facts, kids: going
out is only as fun as you make it.The
only lame things about our parties
are people who say our parties are
lame.

report a five-year plan for eliminating the old
school frats (no. Sigma Nu. not you).The 750
Pub, surely the most innocuous drinking es
tablishment not featured on "Saved by the
Bell," is "considering" taking away their
drinks (I smell an administrative squeeze).
The Tree, once the symbol for our schools
wild Dada eccentricity, was kicked out for
being, of all things, drunk at a sporting event.
And then they did the same thing to the new
one, and he wasn't even (legally) drunk.
When did the bastion of liberalism become
Prohibition-Era Chicago? Meanwhile, Dart
mouth's unofficial mascot is Keggy the Keg.
Yes, we have an awesome resident assistant
system, but why can't everybody just chill?
Undergraduates like drinking; our parents
know this, we know this, even the most re
mote administrator knows this. However, 1
will admit one thing...
5: Stanford kids need to stop drinking like
fifth-graders. (Also true of most Americans).
Germans have beer all the time, but they
enjoy every last drop. They luxuriate in the
healing ambrosia of a Pilsener, their tongue
tickled by every tiny swallow of Hefeweizen.
True, they also like Beck's, but you get the
point. Meanwhile, Stanford chugs away on
Coors, Natty, the Vodka you mixed with Red
Bull so you wouldn't pass out in line for Sun
splash. Hell with the freshman alcohol policy;

1 recommend mandatory drinking
etiquette classes after I HUM. lest
we risk blowing our endowment on
Alumni Weekend Kegs.
6: Every Stanford party is exactly
the same. Everyone knows this, es
pecially that girl who spent half of
freshman year in Sigma Chi, and
now spends her weekends in San
Francisco with the McSweeney's
crowd. Her and her ilk have the
same complaints: parties are too
packed, too loud and have too many

freshmen. Guess what kids: every
party everywhere is the same. Every
club plays pretty much the same
music (unless it's a techno club, and
music all sounds the same on E any
ways). Somewhere, that mythic club
with hot chicks everywhere (and
sensitive guys or metrosexuals or
whatever women want these days)
does exist, but you're not cool or rich
enough to go. If you are, you're a
douche bag. Face facts, kids: going
out is only as fun as you make it.The
only lame things about our parties
are people who say our parties are
lame.
