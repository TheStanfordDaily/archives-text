Issues of race are completely
legitimate
I assume that yesterday's editori
al ("The SOCC: A blight on the dem
ocratic process?". Apr. 17) was not
meant to be taken seriously, but was
instead another plea for your readers
to submit letters.
Based on your own observations
of the candidates that the SOCC has
endorsed, you assume that the
SOCC's process for endorsing candi
dates is racist. However, you offer
absolutely no evidence in support of
this claim. Perhaps you could give
your readers an instance of a non-mi
nority group who was denied an
SOCC endorsement, and who ex
plicitly demonstrated a commitment
to the SOCC's goals of "[promoting]
the respect of Stanford's racial, cul
tural. and ethnic groups"? You can't
infer that the SOCC is choosing to
endorse candidates solely on the
basis of their race just by observing

the races of the endorsed candidates.
That big error isn't the only prob
lem with your editorial, though. You
also elliptically suggest that the
SOCC's stated goals are themselves
discriminatory, when you claim that
"[t]here is no problem with the
SOCC or a similar group making en
dorsements, so long as this support is
based on issues other than race."
First, it's shocking that you have the
temerity to suggest that the SOCC is
making endorsements based solely
on race when you haven't given a sin
gle bit of evidence to that effect. But
second, you seem to suggest that the
SOCC's goals are themselves not
real issues of the election, because
they refer in some way to race. The
SOCC's goals seem quite legitimate
to me, and they arc well within their
rights to support candidates who ex
pressly support their goals. So why,
again, do you find the SOCC's en
dorsing candidates to be "(damaging
to] the democratic process"?

Your assumption that the SOCC
must employ a discriminatory
process of endorsing candidates is
sloppy, irresponsible, and poorly rea
soned. Perhaps you should pay a bit
more attention to your own warnings
against faulty logic and demagogy?

Who's in the minority?
In reference to yesterday's edito
rial ("The SOCC: A blight on the
democratic process?", Apr. 17), I
would like to point out to the Edito
rial Board, which stated in that the
SOCC represents a minority inter
est. Inasmuch as the SOCC repre
sents students of color, they should
have a voting block of roughly 3,640
students, whereas white students
comprise only 2,732 students. How
ever. if the Board is suggesting that
the SOCC is encouraging students to

vote on skin color (or lack thereof),
then that, of course, would be racist.

SOCC endorsements are
available to all
I'm disappointed that the Daily
allowed yesterday's editorial ("The
SOCC: A blight on the democratic
process?", Apr. 17) be published
without proper research. 1 thought
the Daily prided itself on journalistic
research, but hardly any effort was
put in when writing this editorial.
I think the most important aspect
that the article missed is the fact that
candidates have to apply to receive a
SOCC endorsement. It's not like the
SOCC looks at the list of Senate can
didates and picks whoever has a cool
name. Moreover, there were actually
minority candidates who applied for
the endorsement and didn't receive

it. On the other hand, there were mi
nority candidates, Marcelo Worsley
for one, who weren't SOCC-en
dorsed and yet still won.
The reason no white candidates
were endorsed by the SOCC wasn't
because the group is "racist" as the
Editorial Board boldly claims, but
because no white candidates applied
for the endorsement. So instead of
attempting to blame the SOCC,
maybe the non-minorities should
blame themselves for not adequately
campaigning.

Democracy is about choice
After reading today's editorial
("The SOCC: A blight on the demo
cratic process?", Apr. 17), I had to
make an effort to counteract the ef
fect of such an irresponsible and
frankly, ignorant, piece of work. The
editorial criticizes the Students of

Color Coalition's practice of endors
ing candidates, hut let's he honest —
the problem is not that they do it, hut
that they do it successfully. The
Daily itself prints an annual "ASSU
Elections Guide" that, while refrain
ing from endorsing individual sena
tors, does advise voters on which
measures, special fees groups and
class/executive slates to support.
Considering the paper's unmatched
influence, circulation and resources
on campus, is this somehow an ahuse
of power? I don't think so. So why
should the SOCC's actions he any
more offensive?
The Editorial Board suggests that
SOC'C endorsements are had he
cause they are dishonest, and "ex
ploit a misconception that minority
groups are underrepresented in the
Senate and ASSU executives." The
Daily even goes so far as to accuse
the group of heing racist for endors
ing primarily black (and no white)
candidates this year.
1 won't get into discussing why I
think the SOCC's success is so trou
bling to so many students. 1 won't
even mention how unlikely it is that
an organization endorsing primarily
white candidates would ever be de
cried as racist in a Daily Editorial.
Even if these accusations were
accepted as true: what, if any, respon
sibility does the SOCC have to be
"diverse" or "fair" in their endorse
ments? What is stopping others from
forming a Students of No Color
Coalition to promote a different
agenda, and endorse its own candi
dates? If students are truly as fed up
with the SOCC as the Daily suggests,
such an effort would most likely be
quite successful and quite democrat
ic as well.
To call SOCC endorsements a
"blight on the democratic process"
demonstrates a basic ignorance of
what democracy really is. Democra
cy is about choice — about voters
choosing from an abundance of
views and opinions. To dislike the in
fluence of the SOCC is one thing, but
to suggest that the best solution is to
silence them or drastically reduce
their influence is just ridiculous. The
SOCC's endorsements were re
moved from the ballot, and yet they
were still successful — so what's
next? Why are we focused on reduc
ing their influence this way, rather
than just presenting another option?
But even beyond that: if the Daily
thinks the endorsement of candi
dates by a student group is a major
threat to democracy, you haven't
been paying attention. You want to
defend democracy? Take a look at
campaign finance reform, or felon
disenfranchisement, or the basic
structure of a two party system that

leaves too many Americans unrep
resented and uninterested with the
whole process altogether. If our
biggest problem on this campus is
the SOCC, I'd say we're doing pretty
well.

Editorial reflects poorly on
Board's credibility
In today's editorial ("The SOCC: A
blight on the democratic process?",
Apr. 17), the Editorial Board repri
manded the SOCC for being a "de
tractor to the electoral process."
Among other things, the piece
specifically criticized the organiza
tion because it "only endorsed mi
nority candidates, and not a single
white student."
Interestingly enough, however, I
saw an e-mail on The Diaspora list
that explained "candidates have to
apply to receive a SOCC endorse
ment... The reason no white candi
dates were SOCC-endorsed wasn't
because the SOCC is 'racist,' but be
cause no white candidates applied
for the endorsement."
I don't know if this is true, but 1
certainly hope it is not. After all, if it
were, that would mean the Board
was unaware that no white students
had even applied, and thus that its
members did not live up to the jour
nalistic responsibility of actually tak
ing the time to talk with the SOCC to
clarify the situation before printing
the editorial. Or worse yet, it could
entail that the Board did know this
background information yet omitted
it from the piece, making the statistic
that no white candidates received
endorsements appear far more in
dicative of prejudice on the part of
the SOCC than it might actually be.
Neither possible scenario would re
flect well on the Board's credibility.
