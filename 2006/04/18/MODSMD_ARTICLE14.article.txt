## Rain Ruins Finish GRUBE WINS INDIVIDUAL TITLE Men wish to have played cancelled third round 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES STAFF WRITER 
Before rain could dampen an al
ready water-logged course, sopho
more Rob Grube's game shone
brightly at the Stanford-hosted
U.S. Intercollegiate this past week
end. Grube led the men's golf team
with a six-under (64) second round
that paced the team in its third
place finish and earned him his sec
ond individual title within the past
month.
Sunday's third round at the
Stanford Golf course was canceled
due to rain. But in the two rounds
played on Saturday, Stanford
proved to be a strong contender to
its Pac-10 rivals. No. 5 UCLA and
No. 28 Southern California, which
placed first and second, respective
ly. The Cardinal were in the lead
after the first round with a nine
over 289. But after shooting a com
bined 291 in the second round, the
Stanford men found themselves
just two strokes behind the lead.
"Once again, we had a chance to
come out with a victory, but we fell
short," junior Zack Miller said."lt's
very frustrating that we never had
our chance to prove ourselves on
our own home turf because of poor
weather. We were looking for our
first win for [head coach Conrad

Ray], and it's disappointing that we
couldn't compete for the title after
being in such a good spot going into
the final day."
Aware of the possibility of rain
earlier in the week, Ray was also
frustrated by the anti-climactic
tournament finish.
"I wish we could have played
the final round," he said. "I think
we would've had a great chance to
get into the winner's circle. But
that's how golf goes, and you can
never predict what Mother Nature
is going to throw at you."
Grube, however, did find him
self in prime position after the sec
ond round, and earned his second
individual title this season follow
ing the Western Intercollegiate in
late March. After a one-over 71 in
the first round, Grube went on to
fire off a season-best six-under in
the second. The round left Grube in
the lead, six strokes ahead of his
nearest competitor.
"I played a nearly flawless ball
striking round," Grube said. "The
course was very difficult with the
six-inch rough, narrow fairways
and fairly windy conditions, in
order to shoot a low score on this
type of course. I needed to have
supreme command of my golf
ball."
And Grube did â€” a fact that
Ray is quite proud of. The coach
said Grube's second round will go
down in the record books of the 39-
year-old U.S. Intercollegiate. And
for Grube himself, the round will
go down in personal history.

"I was fortunate to have one of
my best ball-striking performances
of my college career," he said.
"Overall, it was really exciting to
play well on the most difficult
course we had faced all year."
Although on their home turf,
the Cardinal faced a distinctly dif
ferent Stanford Golf Course expe
rience due to the conditions. The
course was soggy and not recently
mowed.
"The rough was very difficult;
you had to hit it in the fairway," Ray
said. "That probably prevented a
few of the guys from scoring as well
as they would've liked."
While Grube drove the Cardi
nal in the second round, others had
difficulty keeping up under the
conditions. Miller finished nearest
to Grube but was still behind by 10
strokes. Miller did end up placing
well, though, tying for ninth with a
144 over the two round (70-74).The
finish is one in a string of impres
sive performances this season by
the junior.
"Zack has matured an amazing
amount since I've been at Stanford,
and I think he's realizing that he's a
major-leaguer on this team," Ray
said.
Miller also feels his game and
approach have improved, placing
him in high contention among the
team.
"The biggest difference that I've
been working hard on is my mental
approach," he said. "Throughout

my round. I've been working on
shrinking the gap between my emo
tional highs and lows. It's helped me
tremendously in keeping my energy
and focus high and being positive
throughout the tournament."
Likewise, the Cardinal are now
looking positively to the beginning
of their postseason. Stanford next
competes in the Pac-1() Champi
onship at the Big Horn Golf Club in
Palm Desert. Calif., April 24-26.
There it will once again face the
Bruins and Trojans, among others.
"We've been competitive with all
the top teams in the Pac-10,and now
it's just up to us to perform when the
time comes," Miller said. "Great
things can come out next week, so
we're excited to go down to South
ern California and compete."
