# Team leads on track, in awards
## 
### ISRAEL ROJAS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Winning awards is always nice — just ask
sophomore Chauntae Bayne-Hackett, who was
named the Pacific-10 Conference Women's
Track Athlete of the Week for her efforts at last
week's Texas Relays.
Or ask any of the 32 Stanford athletes named
to the All-MPSF Academic Team. To be eligible
for this distinction, an athlete must maintain a
minimum 3.0 GPA, be of at least sophomore
standing and compete in at least 50 percent of
his or her team's meets. But these week-long
award festivities do not happen on their own, as
the Cardinal are always busy with events almost
every weekend.
Walnut, Calif., hosted Stanford this weekend
as part of the 44th Annual Mt. SAC (San Anto
nio College) Relays.The Cardinal began Thurs
day with two freshman qualifying for the
NCAA West Regional — Alicia Follmar in the
800 meters with a time of 2:07.69 minutes, and
Garrett Heath in the 5,000 meters with a time of
14:09.33 minutes.
Junior Arianna Lambie continued her domi
nating season, debuting in the 1,500-meter run
on Friday night. Not only did she qualify for the
NCAA West Regional (With a 4:19.88 minute
time), but she also plowed through the competi
tion, beating out all other 23 opponents. She was
not the lone runner to qualify for the Regional,
however, as freshman Lauren Centrowitz fin
ished in second place, in 4:22.89 minutes.
The men also saw a similar scenario unfold,
as sophomore Russell Brown made his debut in
the 1,500 meter run. Only .39 thousandths of a
second separated Brown from first place,but his
time of 3:44 minutes was still good enough to
earn him a trip to nationals.
Up and coming sophomore Melissa Yung
hans had a strong meet, capturing the shot put
title in the final day of competition. Yunghans
won the event with a throw of 48-81/4 feet, beat
ing out eight other competitors.
But no Stanford track meet would be com
plete without a broken record, and this week
was no different. At the Pomona Pitzer Invita
tional, senior Sarah Hopping threw the hammer
a school record breaking 205-10 feet. She broke
the old record of 204-2 feet that she herself set a
year ago at the NCAA West Regional. Hopping
also competed at the Mt. SAC Relays, throwing
the hammer 203-4 feet. While her second day of
competition did not produce another record,
the consistency she demonstrated is what head
Stanford coach Edrick Floreal likes to see.
"We have a lot of talent across the board,
with potential All Americans in every event
area," Floreal said.
Over the last few weeks, various athletes
have been stepping up to set personal records
— which often sometimes translate to school
records, as in Hopping's case.
The team's sprinters and jumpers did not
compete this weekend, but they will make their
return this weekend at the Big Meet. This year
will be the 112 th Big Meet, as the Cardinal trav-
el to Berkeley.
The Golden Bears opened up
their outdoor season with a solid
performance at the Texas Relays.
The Cal women finished in the top
10 of each of their respective events.
Cal's teams resemble Stanford's, in
that both women's teams have had
more success than the men's. How
ever, both men's teams are still per
forming at a high level, and things
are set for an evenly matched com
petition.
Last year, the Stanford men lost
85-7S despite winning five races
starting at 4(H) meters and going up
to S,(KK) meters. But the Golden
Bears dominated in the hurdle
events, sweeping the 4(X)-meter hur
dles and winning first and second in
the 110-meter hurdles. Cal also con
trolled most of the field events, win
ning six of eight and leaving only the
triple jump and discus to Stanford.
The women's meet was not near
ly as closely contended, with Stan
ford pulling out a 97-66 victory en
route to its first Pac-10 Champi
onship in eight years. The Cardinal
came away with victories in 12 of 19
events last season, making it difficult
for the Bears to catch up. The Cardi
nal have lost runners Alicia Craig
and Christine Moschella — who
both scored several points last year
— to graduation, but with several
athletes showing marked improve
ment the team still looks in good
shape.
The women are hoping to make
six Big Meet victories in a row.
