# Time for Cadinal to move on
## Disappointing 2006 season ends, making way for new coach, new year 
### JOE KAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the past weekend, the men's
volleyball team knew that barring
some kind of divine intervention or
record mix up, there was no possible
way that it would make it into the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
conference playoffs. Thus, focus
shifted to the members of the volley
ball team who were saying farewell
in the final game of their Stanford
careers.
Head coach Don Shaw and five
seniors — middle blocker Chris
Ahlfeldt, setter Jeremy Jacobs, oppo
site hitter Ben Reddy and outside
hitters Nick Manov and William
Clayton — all hung up there coat
and jerseys for the last time.
In the Southern California visit,
the Cardinal played UC-San Diego
on Friday night and traveled up the
coast to play Long Beach State on
Saturday.
With the two losses — 3-1 on Fri
day and 3-0 Saturday — the Cardinal
end their season with a 4-26 regular
season record, 2-20 in the MPSF.
" ITiere were a lot of things we did
well, and some other things we didn't
do so well," associate head coach
John Kosty said, speaking of this past
weekend.

Against the Tritons (2-26. 1-20),
Stanford went 31-33,30-22,30-13,30-
24. Stanford started nut game one in
a similar fashion to the way the squad
has played in the beginning match all
season; the Card kept the game ex
tremely tight ail game long. Except
this time, the Cardinal were able to
squeeze out a win. A kill by Reddy
and UCSD attack error finished out
the game.
However, as in many of their
other matches this season, the Cardi
nal fell apart in the following games.
With a combination of UCSD's serv
ing prowess and consistent hitting,
the Tritons managed to win the next
three games handily.
Every UCSD player who at
tempted more than two kills in the
match hit .333 or better. Senior oppo
site hitter Chris Sayers had a team
high 18 kills as junior setter Brooks
Dierdorff added 48 set assists for the
Tritons.
Reddy had the match-high 22
kills to go along with three serving
aces. Sophomore middle blocker
Matt Ceran had a superb hitting
night, pounding away 12 kills, and Ja
cobs dished out 36 dimes on the
night.
Game three was the deciding
game of the match.
"(UCSD's) serving significantly
picked up." Kosty said."lt kind of put
us on our heels a little bit. We were in
a dogfight from there. They came out
and gave us a good blow."

Senior William Clayton leaves a team looking forward to a
brighter future —and one that won't include a 4-26 record.
The following night, the strug
gling Cardinal had to play their final
season match against a surging No. 5
Long Beach State (21-9, 14-8). The
49ers beat the Cardinal 30-22,30-14,
30-28 in straight games.
"[Long Beach] is one of the most
premier teams in the country," Kosty
said. "They've got a couple players
which we had a difficult time stop
ping, one being [senior outside hit
ter] Robert Tarr."
Stanford started game one with
all five seniors, junior libero Brian
Lindber, and Ceran. They played
spiritedly but still fell in two straight
games.
In the final game, Stanford start

ed four freshmen — setter Miki
Groppi, libero Jarod Keller, middle
blocker Brian Williams and convert
ed outside hitter John Ekins. Sopho
mores Jesse Meredith and Ceran,
and Reddy — the glue that holds the
team together — got the start as
well. Shaw figured that the younger
players needed to get another game
under their belt before they are
thrust into the spotlight he and the
class of 2006 had owned during their
careers.
Kosty, who takes over the pro
gram in May, spoke highly of what he
hopes the team will achieve in the fu
ture.
"I'm really excited about the new
signees," Kosty said."l think they are
going to really add a new attitude to
Stanford volleyball. It's exciting to
have five solid recruits coming in.
They're a bunch of really good guys,
really good students, and they also

have extremely good volleyball apti
tude."
"The seniors did everything we
asked of them," Kosty added. "I
think they are leaving with a good
sense of accomplishment of what
they have contributed to Stanford
volleyball."
Kosty ended with words of praise
for Shaw, whom he will replace as
head coach next year.
"Don Shaw created Stanford vol
leyball, both the men's and women's
programs," Kosty concluded. "1
think that all the alums, the coaches
who have worked with hi, and the
coaches that have competed against
him all respect him for the place he
has put volleyball in this country. He
took the [Stanford] women to four
national championships. He has set
the bar for any coach who follows in
his footsteps. 1 feel honored and
privileged to be that coach."
