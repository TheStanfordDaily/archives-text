# Time for Cadinal to move on
## Disappointing 2006 season ends, making way for new coach, new year 
### JOE KAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the past weekend, the men's
volleyball team knew that barring
some kind of divine intervention or
record mix up, there was no possible
way that it would make it into the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
conference playoffs. Thus, focus
shifted to the members of the volley
ball team who were saying farewell
in the final game of their Stanford
careers.
Head coach Don Shaw and five
seniors — middle blocker Chris
Ahlfeldt, setter Jeremy Jacobs, oppo
site hitter Ben Reddy and outside
hitters Nick Manov and William
Clayton — all hung up there coat
and jerseys for the last time.
In the Southern California visit,
the Cardinal played UC-San Diego
on Friday night and traveled up the
coast to play Long Beach State on
Saturday.
With the two losses — 3-1 on Fri
day and 3-0 Saturday — the Cardinal
end their season with a 4-26 regular
season record, 2-20 in the MPSF.
" ITiere were a lot of things we did
well, and some other things we didn't
do so well," associate head coach
John Kosty said, speaking of this past
weekend.

Against the Tritons (2-26. 1-20),
Stanford went 31-33,30-22,30-13,30-
24. Stanford started nut game one in
a similar fashion to the way the squad
has played in the beginning match all
season; the Card kept the game ex
tremely tight ail game long. Except
this time, the Cardinal were able to
squeeze out a win. A kill by Reddy
and UCSD attack error finished out
the game.
However, as in many of their
other matches this season, the Cardi
nal fell apart in the following games.
With a combination of UCSD's serv
ing prowess and consistent hitting,
the Tritons managed to win the next
three games handily.
Every UCSD player who at
tempted more than two kills in the
match hit .333 or better. Senior oppo
site hitter Chris Sayers had a team
high 18 kills as junior setter Brooks
Dierdorff added 48 set assists for the
Tritons.
Reddy had the match-high 22
kills to go along with three serving
aces. Sophomore middle blocker
Matt Ceran had a superb hitting
night, pounding away 12 kills, and Ja
cobs dished out 36 dimes on the
night.
Game three was the deciding
game of the match.
"(UCSD's) serving significantly
picked up." Kosty said."lt kind of put
us on our heels a little bit. We were in
a dogfight from there. They came out
and gave us a good blow."

Senior William Clayton leaves a team looking forward to a
brighter future —and one that won't include a 4-26 record.
