# There is such a thing as a free meal

"MVP!"
"Let's go. Lakers!"
"We want tacos!"
Yes, during the Lakers' 109-89
trouncing of the Pacific Division
leading Suns yesterday, the Staples
Center crowd loudly demanded a
free meal. As part of the arena's pro
motion. when the Lakers hold their
opponents to under 90 points, every
ticket holder receives a free taco.
And so as the clock wound down
to the final minute and a half, the sea
of purple and gold traded in its justi
fied "MVP" chants for a more hu
morous chorus. Sure enough, the
Lakers held their end of the bargain
as the good guys shut down
Phoenix's offense for the final 90
seconds to clinch a playoff spot,
avenge last year's late-season col
lapse and give their fans a free din
ner.
Phil Jackson was happy to make
the playoffs again, and it was good.
Kobe was happy to cement his argu
ment as an MVP candidate, and it
was good. The audience was happy
to go home with a full stomach, and
it was good. I was happy to see
Kobe-haters silenced, and it was
good. And on the seventh day, God
happily looked down on the score
and said it was "very good."
The Lakers joined the playoff
picture with Chicago, Washington
and cross-state rival Sacramento
(which is news to me — according to
my RA, Sacramento fans hate the
Lakers. Laker fans, meanwhile,
merely look down on Arco Arena
and laugh). Indeed, with so much tal
ent representing the league's bot
tom seeds, this year's playoffs may
offer some of the greatest postsea
son basketball match-ups fans have
seen in a while.
Barring mishaps on Wednesday,
Sacramento will most likely meet
San Antonio or Dallas in the first
round, while the Lakers will face
second-seed Phoenix. Hie Kings
should provide a tune-up for the
Spurs or Mavericks, who may need
as many as six games to handle the
new energy provided by Sacramen
to's mid-season acquisition Ron
Artest.The Lakers, coming off a po
tential five-game win streak, could
use Bryant and Lamar Odom to
dominate the paint against a weak
Suns' defense and force a huge
opening-round upset.
With the current division seeding
system, only one of the West's two
powerhouses — San Antonio or
Dallas — can advance to the confer
ence finals. The vastly underrated
Clippers will handle the Nuggets in
as many as six games to meet the
Lakers in the second round.
As much as 1 would love to see a
Los Angeles team on the NBAs
grandest stage, nothing good can re
sult from the Clippers' lack of expe
rience or the Lakers' dependence
on a man who is soon to go down as
the greatest player of all time
