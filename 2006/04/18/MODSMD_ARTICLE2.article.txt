## LOOKING BACK AT 1906 QUAKE A 						century and $300 million later; Stanford reflects on earthquake preparedness 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
The University has spent upwards of $3(X)
million and seismically retrofitted nearly 140
buildings since 1989 to prepare for the next
Big One. which — according to scientists —
could hit at any time. A concerted effort has
been made to help structures resist such a
trembler and prevent the level of damage left
in the wake of the famed 1906 disaster.
The University today is very different
from the one nearly destroyed 1(H) years ago
today by the Great San Francisco Earth
quake. Virtually all of campus has been built
or rebuilt since the magnitude 7.8 quake
wreaked havoc on the Peninsula. Behind the
adobe facade of the Quad, for example, sits
reinforced concrete and strengthened rebar.
The University made a conscious decision
to self-insure for earthquake damage. While
there will not be a fat insurance check to help
rebuild after the next quake. Stanford spends
the money it saves on premiums to pay for
projects to retrofit or renovate its buildings.
This helps limit damage because the struc
tures are made to better withstand quakes.
"Insurance gets you money after an earth
quake, but it does not give you life back," said
Civil and Environmental Engineering Prof.
Helmut Krawinkler, who said the decision
paid off in the 1989 Loma Prieta Quake.
In interviews over the past week, experts
agreed that the school has made reinforcing
its buildings a priority.
"Stanford has been fairly aggressive at
making sure our buildings are earthquake re
sistant," said Geophysics Prof. Greg Beroza.
Stanford's efforts to prepare the campus
were recognized last night by a top engineer
ing trade organization. A jury of experts from

the damage done to buildings cannot

ing trade organization. A jury of experts
from the Applied Technology Council
chose Stanford's retrofit program as one
of the Top 10 Seismic Projects of the 20th
Century. Barnes and others accepted the
award at the Westin St. Francis Hotel in
San Francisco last night.
"The award speaks for the University
in general." Krawinkler said. "Nothing
comes for free. [Renovation] needs direc
tion from faculty and the President's of
fice."
SEHINC PRIORITIES
Safety is not the only consideration in
seismic retrofitting projects. Money is just
as important a factor, and there is a limit
ed amount to spend on earthquake-relat
ed construction. Spending vast sums of
money to make every structure a heavily
reinforced fortress is not fiscally prudent.
So tradeoffs are made.
"A strength of Stanford for the last 30
years has been risk management,"
Krawinkler said.
"You have to make decisions about
what you do with your resources." said
Jean Barnes, associate director of the Uni
versity's Land and Buildings Department.
"Our priority is life safety. We don't want
to have people dying or buildings collaps
ing on us."
The age. size, structure, historical value
and importance of buildings to the
school's mission are taken into account
when deciding which will get the most at
tention and over what time period, she
said.
The Land and Buildings Office just
completed an evaluative analysis of six
buildings as part of its ongoing effort. The
structures currently under review include
Meyer Library. Crothers and Cubberley
(School of Education).
"They are continuing to study, and
something may be done eventually,"
Barnes said.
The Board of Trustees approved plans
last Monday to renovate Old Union. The
construction will begin in June and the
student center will likely be ready by the
end of the year.
The University says it tries to avoid
shortchanging some buildings at the ex
pense of higher-priority facilities.
"We want to try to spread the risk so no
single population is more vulnerable than
the other," Barnes said. "We're trying to
make the University campus safe."
This has been especially true for essen

tial service facilities. Buildings such as the
electronics and communications hubs can
achieve a higher level of performance at a
less expensive cost, officials say. Addition
ally, some structures are needed to main
tain continuity.
The University has seismic design
guidelines. A panel of administrators de
cides how sturdy a given building needs to
be. then hires an engineering firm to de
sign the structure that meets the goal. The
engineer submits a design for peer review
to ensure that the building can do what
school officials want expect of it in an
earthquake.
Peer review helps make sure a project
will not be over-engineered and unneces
sarily expensive.
"Some engineers will over-design,"
Barnes said. "It can be a cost effective
measure to get the engineers to provide
adequate seismic corrections in a building
but not go over the top."
The University also tries to protect
the research being conducted in build
ings. Bolting heavy furniture and heavy
equipment — such as refrigerators —
will ensure less damage to a room's con
tents.
Stanford tries to meet and exceed all
applicable building codes, according to
University officials.
"We have completed the seismic retro
fit of all the occupied un-reinforced ma
sonry buildings," Barnes said.
About 35 of the buildings upgraded
since 1989 had been constructed from un
reinforced masonry.
The four masonry buildings that re
main un-reinforced are unoccupied:
Tower House,the former University Press
building (next to the Storke Building), the
old Health Research and Policy building
(across from Cantor Arts Museum) and
the Old Chemistry building.
"Eventually they'll either be demol
ished or retrofitted," said Barnes.
LEARNING FROM THE PAST: LOMA PRIETA
The 1989 earthquake caused $160 mil
lion of damage and reminded University
leaders of the importance of investing
wisely in the school's infrastructure.
"Loma Prieta was a good wake-up
call," said Earth Sciences Prof. Mark
Zoback.
Each of the 85 new buildings construct
ed since 1989 was designed to meet rigor
ous new codes put in place after the last
big quake.
"Our recoverability and survivability
has improved as a result of our new build
ing construction since 1989," Barnes said.
"Fifteen-and-a-half years later, we
can still see the effects of Loma Prieta,"
Zoback added. "It took a long time for

the museum and Green Library to re
open. The only building not reopened
since is Old Chemistry, and the Univer
sity is still trying to decide what to do
with it."
The University has been working to
seismically retrofit its buildings since
more than a decade before the Loma Pri
eta quake. Stanford embarked on a mas
sive. proactive effort to strengthen build
ings against a similar threat.
"Stanford has a long history of looking
at its buildings and trying to look at the
potential implications of a major quake,"
Barnes said. "Even before Loma Prieta,
we were actively engaged."
A project to add braces in the Roble
dorm was completed just weeks before
Loma Prieta in 1989. Hallow-plate tile
from the original construction was re
placed with steel rebar.
The University highlights the Roble
renovation as an example of its strong
commitment to protecting buildings and
students. Barnes pointed out that there
was no legal directive for the school to fix
Roble.
"Roble would have been significantly
damaged if that retrofit had not been
done," Zoback said. "The University did
the right thing, and lives were saved be
cause they did. In the case of Roble, the
University went out of its way to close a
dorm and spend a lot of money retro
fitting."
"We discovered vulnerable construc
tion and took action," Barnes said. "It was
a very big step we were willing to take be
cause we were so concerned about life
safety."
MORE TO DO
At the same time, the University is ob
ligated by California state law to bring
hospital facilities up to minimum building
standards.
The San Jose Mercury News reported
last week that eight out of 22 buildings at
Stanford Hospital are at risk of collapse.
The University applied for an extension;
only two of the buildings actually house
patients.The structures are being evaluat
ed and may be eventually replaced. The
same report found that no buildings at Lu
cile Packard Children's Hospital are at
risk of collapse.
While much progress has been made,
scientists and engineers say that preparing
for an earthquake needs to be an ongoing
process.
"Stanford has been extraordinarily re
sponsive to the need to retrofit buildings,"
Zoback said. "The University has really
done a good job. But more remains to be
done. The University has plans to finish
the job."

will ensure less damage to a room's con
tents.
Stanford tries to meet and exceed all
applicable building codes, according to
University officials.
"We have completed the seismic retro
fit of all the occupied un-reinforced ma
sonry buildings," Barnes said.
About 35 of the buildings upgraded
since 1989 had been constructed from un
reinforced masonry.
The four masonry buildings that re
main un-reinforced are unoccupied:
Tower House,the former University Press
building (next to the Storke Building), the
old Health Research and Policy building
(across from Cantor Arts Museum) and
the Old Chemistry building.
"Eventually they'll either be demol
ished or retrofitted," said Barnes.
LEARNING FROM THE PAST: LOMA PRIETA
The 1989 earthquake caused $160 mil
lion of damage and reminded University
leaders of the importance of investing
wisely in the school's infrastructure.
"Loma Prieta was a good wake-up
call," said Earth Sciences Prof. Mark
Zoback.
Each of the 85 new buildings construct
ed since 1989 was designed to meet rigor
ous new codes put in place after the last
big quake.
"Our recoverability and survivability
has improved as a result of our new build
ing construction since 1989," Barnes said.
"Fifteen-and-a-half years later, we
can still see the effects of Loma Prieta,"
Zoback added. "It took a long time for

the museum and Green Library to re
open. The only building not reopened
since is Old Chemistry, and the Univer
sity is still trying to decide what to do
with it."
The University has been working to
seismically retrofit its buildings since
more than a decade before the Loma Pri
eta quake. Stanford embarked on a mas
sive. proactive effort to strengthen build
ings against a similar threat.
"Stanford has a long history of looking
at its buildings and trying to look at the
potential implications of a major quake,"
Barnes said. "Even before Loma Prieta,
we were actively engaged."
A project to add braces in the Roble
dorm was completed just weeks before
Loma Prieta in 1989. Hallow-plate tile
from the original construction was re
placed with steel rebar.
The University highlights the Roble
renovation as an example of its strong
commitment to protecting buildings and
students. Barnes pointed out that there
was no legal directive for the school to fix
Roble.
"Roble would have been significantly
damaged if that retrofit had not been
done," Zoback said. "The University did
the right thing, and lives were saved be
cause they did. In the case of Roble, the
University went out of its way to close a
dorm and spend a lot of money retro
fitting."
"We discovered vulnerable construc
tion and took action," Barnes said. "It was
a very big step we were willing to take be
cause we were so concerned about life
safety."
MORE TO DO
At the same time, the University is ob
ligated by California state law to bring
hospital facilities up to minimum building
standards.
The San Jose Mercury News reported
last week that eight out of 22 buildings at
Stanford Hospital are at risk of collapse.
The University applied for an extension;
only two of the buildings actually house
patients.The structures are being evaluat
ed and may be eventually replaced. The
same report found that no buildings at Lu
cile Packard Children's Hospital are at
risk of collapse.
While much progress has been made,
scientists and engineers say that preparing
for an earthquake needs to be an ongoing
process.
"Stanford has been extraordinarily re
sponsive to the need to retrofit buildings,"
Zoback said. "The University has really
done a good job. But more remains to be
done. The University has plans to finish
the job."
The University has spent upwards of $3(X)
million and seismically retrofitted nearly 140
buildings since 1989 to prepare for the next
Big One. which — according to scientists —
could hit at any time. A concerted effort has
been made to help structures resist such a
trembler and prevent the level of damage left
in the wake of the famed 1906 disaster.
The University today is very different
from the one nearly destroyed 1(H) years ago
today by the Great San Francisco Earth
quake. Virtually all of campus has been built
or rebuilt since the magnitude 7.8 quake
wreaked havoc on the Peninsula. Behind the
adobe facade of the Quad, for example, sits
reinforced concrete and strengthened rebar.
The University made a conscious decision
to self-insure for earthquake damage. While
there will not be a fat insurance check to help
rebuild after the next quake. Stanford spends
the money it saves on premiums to pay for
projects to retrofit or renovate its buildings.
This helps limit damage because the struc
tures are made to better withstand quakes.
"Insurance gets you money after an earth
quake, but it does not give you life back," said
Civil and Environmental Engineering Prof.
Helmut Krawinkler, who said the decision
paid off in the 1989 Loma Prieta Quake.
In interviews over the past week, experts
agreed that the school has made reinforcing
its buildings a priority.
"Stanford has been fairly aggressive at
making sure our buildings are earthquake re
sistant," said Geophysics Prof. Greg Beroza.
Stanford's efforts to prepare the campus
were recognized last night by a top engineer
ing trade organization. A jury of experts from

"Two lives were lost six injured, and
the damage done to buildings cannot
be estimated...Tlie famous Memorial
Church is practically demolished...The
new libraiy is in utter lossJhe new
Gymnasium and the great Memorial
Arch are also terribly wrecked."

ing trade organization. A jury of experts
from the Applied Technology Council
chose Stanford's retrofit program as one
of the Top 10 Seismic Projects of the 20th
Century. Barnes and others accepted the
award at the Westin St. Francis Hotel in
San Francisco last night.
"The award speaks for the University
in general." Krawinkler said. "Nothing
comes for free. [Renovation] needs direc
tion from faculty and the President's of
fice."
SEHINC PRIORITIES
Safety is not the only consideration in
seismic retrofitting projects. Money is just
as important a factor, and there is a limit
ed amount to spend on earthquake-relat
ed construction. Spending vast sums of
money to make every structure a heavily
reinforced fortress is not fiscally prudent.
So tradeoffs are made.
"A strength of Stanford for the last 30
years has been risk management,"
Krawinkler said.
"You have to make decisions about
what you do with your resources." said
Jean Barnes, associate director of the Uni
versity's Land and Buildings Department.
"Our priority is life safety. We don't want
to have people dying or buildings collaps
ing on us."
The age. size, structure, historical value
and importance of buildings to the
school's mission are taken into account
when deciding which will get the most at
tention and over what time period, she
said.
The Land and Buildings Office just
completed an evaluative analysis of six
buildings as part of its ongoing effort. The
structures currently under review include
Meyer Library. Crothers and Cubberley
(School of Education).
"They are continuing to study, and
something may be done eventually,"
Barnes said.
The Board of Trustees approved plans
last Monday to renovate Old Union. The
construction will begin in June and the
student center will likely be ready by the
end of the year.
The University says it tries to avoid
shortchanging some buildings at the ex
pense of higher-priority facilities.
"We want to try to spread the risk so no
single population is more vulnerable than
the other," Barnes said. "We're trying to
make the University campus safe."
This has been especially true for essen

tial service facilities. Buildings such as the
electronics and communications hubs can
achieve a higher level of performance at a
less expensive cost, officials say. Addition
ally, some structures are needed to main
tain continuity.
The University has seismic design
guidelines. A panel of administrators de
cides how sturdy a given building needs to
be. then hires an engineering firm to de
sign the structure that meets the goal. The
engineer submits a design for peer review
to ensure that the building can do what
school officials want expect of it in an
earthquake.
Peer review helps make sure a project
will not be over-engineered and unneces
sarily expensive.
"Some engineers will over-design,"
Barnes said. "It can be a cost effective
measure to get the engineers to provide
adequate seismic corrections in a building
but not go over the top."
The University also tries to protect
the research being conducted in build
ings. Bolting heavy furniture and heavy
equipment — such as refrigerators —
will ensure less damage to a room's con
tents.
