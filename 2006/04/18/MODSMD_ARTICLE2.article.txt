						century and $300 million later; Stanford reflects on earthquake preparedness 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
The University has spent upwards of $3(X)
million and seismically retrofitted nearly 140
buildings since 1989 to prepare for the next
Big One. which — according to scientists —
could hit at any time. A concerted effort has
been made to help structures resist such a
trembler and prevent the level of damage left
in the wake of the famed 1906 disaster.
The University today is very different
from the one nearly destroyed 1(H) years ago
today by the Great San Francisco Earth
quake. Virtually all of campus has been built
or rebuilt since the magnitude 7.8 quake
wreaked havoc on the Peninsula. Behind the
adobe facade of the Quad, for example, sits
reinforced concrete and strengthened rebar.
The University made a conscious decision
to self-insure for earthquake damage. While
there will not be a fat insurance check to help
rebuild after the next quake. Stanford spends
the money it saves on premiums to pay for
projects to retrofit or renovate its buildings.
This helps limit damage because the struc
tures are made to better withstand quakes.
"Insurance gets you money after an earth
quake, but it does not give you life back," said
Civil and Environmental Engineering Prof.
Helmut Krawinkler, who said the decision
paid off in the 1989 Loma Prieta Quake.
In interviews over the past week, experts
agreed that the school has made reinforcing
its buildings a priority.
"Stanford has been fairly aggressive at
making sure our buildings are earthquake re
sistant," said Geophysics Prof. Greg Beroza.
Stanford's efforts to prepare the campus
were recognized last night by a top engineer
ing trade organization. A jury of experts from

"Two lives were lost six injured, and
the damage done to buildings cannot
be estimated...Tlie famous Memorial
Church is practically demolished...The
new libraiy is in utter lossJhe new
Gymnasium and the great Memorial
Arch are also terribly wrecked."
