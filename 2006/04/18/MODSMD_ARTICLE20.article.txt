# AWARDS & HONORS
## Trialers All-American Team snags record number of individual awards but performs mediocre overall 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Mock Trial team re
turned from the Intercollegiate Na
tional Mock Trial Tournament in Des
Moines, lowa, last week with three
new Ail-Americans — the best record
of individual awards in the team's
seven-year history. The tournament
consisted of 64 teams in two divisions
and was held the weekend of April 7
through 9.
Ed Piper, a freshman, and Bryan
Heckenlively, a senior, were both hon
ored with Ail-American Attorney
awards.
"[Being honored] feels great,"
Piper said. "It's really bolstered my
confidence for next year."
Philip Henry, a senior, was also rec
ognized as an AU-American Witness.
"[The award] was really satisfying,"
Henry said. "After I was announced it
was a great thrill, because I have
reached the pinnacle of mock trial. I
was named an All-American at the na
tional tournament. There is no higher
honor that can be given."
The feat, which was unparalleled in
the competition, could he looked at as
the triple crown of Mock Trial.
"Well, it would have been nice to
have had all the Stanford attorneys
and all the witnesses get All-American
status, hut it is certainly impressive to
have three people on a team of eight
receive the award," said coach Frances
Lewis, Class of 2005. "Given the way
the ranking works, it's incredibly hard
for two attorneys on the same side to
both get All-Amcrican."

According to Piper, at the end of
every trial, the two scorers rank the
top four attorneys and witnesses. Each
ranking is assigned a set amount of
points, and at the end of the tourna
ment the 10 or 15 "mockers" with the
highest-ranking scores are recognized
as Ail-American.
However, the Stanford team as a
whole did not fare so well, finishing
with a record of three wins, four loss
es and one tie. The team had recent
ly come off an 8-0 undefeated streak
at the regional championships in
Portland and a 4-4 run at the UCLA
National Invitational. The team at
tributed its disappointing record to
losing points from judges on stylistic
factors.
"Mock trial is tough because the
scoring is so subjective — two local
judges or attorneys who have never
done mock trial before assign point
values to each aspect of the trial."
Lewis said. "Our record was 3-4-1,
which was a good showing but still
fairly disappointing, given that there
was nothing in any of the trials that we
could point to and say,' See, this is what
we did wrong.'"
The team attributes a large part of
its recent successes to its gifted coach.
"She is a godsend." said John
Fowler, a junior, of Lewis. "She is so
talented and so understanding, and
she deserves many, many praises for
her contributions. Without her, we
wouldn't be where we are today."
The trip, which most team members
said was relatively uneventful, was
livened briefly when they discovered
that they were staying in the same
hotel as ex-vice-presidential candidate
John Edwards, and again when Piper
was rushed to the emergency room
after an allergic reaction to prunes.
Said Henry, "After all. we were in
Des Moines."
