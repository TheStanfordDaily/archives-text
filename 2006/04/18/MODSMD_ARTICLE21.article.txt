## Activists describe West Bank violence 
### KATHERINE COX STAFF WRITER 
Two young human rights activists spoke last night about the
Palestinian population of Tel Rumeida, Hebron, a West Bank neigh
borhood that also contains some of what were considered the most
fanatical Israeli settlements. The event's sponsor, Stanford's Coali
tion for Justice in the Middle East (CJME), brought the co-founders
of a fledgling human rights project stationed in Tel Rumeida, 24-
year-old Chelli Stanley and 35-year-old John Harmer, to campus as
the group observes Palestinian Awareness Month.
The lecture, entitled "Tel Rumeida: Life Under the Occupation,"
was the first in a series of related events extending into early May.
Yesterday's lecture — which also featured footage captured by
project volunteers in the neighborhood — precedes a second lec
ture on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. by Palestine's Deputy Ambassador to
the U.N. Riyad Mansour in Cubberley Auditorium.
Stanley,originally from Maine, is a sociologist whose vision to es
tablish the first permanent international presence in the neighbor
hood coincided with that of artist John Harmer. Harmer's previous
work examined the military industrial complex through sculpture.
Yesterday's joint lecture, accompanied by a slide presentation,
enumerated the ways in which the speakers said Palestinian resi
dents of Tel Rumeida were terrorized — witnessed and document
ed by the speakers — by two bordering settler communities. The
speakers related anecdotes of torture and abuse.
"One morning, a Palestinian boy was leaving to go to school and
was surrounded by five adult male settlers, one of which put a bat
tery operated power drill to his chest," Stanley said. "This is a tactic
they've been using against the children in the neighborhood."
The boy survived and was not hospitalized, but the psychological
impact of the act, Stanley suggested, breeds fear in the neighbor
hood's dwindling Palestinian population.
Another story detailed the abuse of a small child.
"A female Israeli settler used a rock to pry open a young Pales
tinian boy's mouth. She used the rock to grind down the child's mo
lars," Stanley said.
The speakers named what they called the settlers' other staple
methods of abuse. They allegedly included stoning, arson, beatings,
destruction of property and violence inflicted by even young Israeli
children.
"Israeli settlers have found a loophole in the law that states that
no one under the age of 12 can be held responsible for their actions.
The attacks that appear in the most visible areas are often initiated
by very young boys and girls," Harmer said.
He explained that though many of the attacks are executed by
children who are exempt from the law. violence perpetrated by
adult men and women settlers is common and is in no way impeded
by the local Israeli police and military.
In fact — the speakers suggested — the oppression Palestinians
face in Tel Rumeida is exacerbated by the favoritism of the local Is
raeli military presence. The activist group reports that, though sol
diers are bound by law to protect every individual in the neighbor
hood. violence against Palestinian residents is apparently openly
tolerated.
To illustrate this point. Stanley related a tragedy in which a Pales
tinian woman lost two unborn twins during an attack by settlers. Ac
cording to Stanley, the woman shouted repeatedly for help to near

by soldiers to no avail, and finally resorted to calling the Israeli po
lice. Her son was attacked while the police refused to come to her
home. Finally, after hearing the death threats screamed over the
phone, the police arrived after a long delay.The woman later miscar
ried both of her twins and was forced to take a long detour around
hostile settlements to reach a hospital.
Harmer claimed that the Israeli police in this area — who have
come under fire from Israeli officials for their discrimination of
Palestinians — often hang up on Arabic callers before their com
plaints or emergencies are relayed.
Both speakers began visiting Tel Rumeida in 2005, where they
were immediately exposed to the daily life of local Palestinians. The
speakers believed their observations warranted documenting, so
throughout 2005 the activists filmed incidents of violence which will
be compiled into a documentary in two to three months. Many of
the clips are available on the Project's Web site, which allows view
ers to download the materially freely.
During their stay in Tel Rumeida. Stanley. Harmer and other in
ternational human rights workers acted as human shields against as
sailants, accompanying Palestinians through the streets and at
tempting to ward off attacks.
"We get in between the settler and the person being attacked. We
scream at them and videotape the attack. With these settlers we
know that we're not going to stop the violence so we just try to redi
rect the attacks on ourselves," Stanley said.
Stanford was just one stop along a circuit of destinations for
Stanley and Harmer, who are touring the United States to raise
funds for the Tel Rumeida Project and recruit new volunteers. The
project seeks to raise $20,0(X) in the United States, which will be
matched by a human rights agency. Most of the funds will go toward
buying new video cameras for the project.
