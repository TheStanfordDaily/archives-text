## Debate shines at nationals Three teams place in top 20, Stanford wins novice title 
### CHRISTOPHER LIN STAFF WRITER 
Drawing upon their quick wits and inor
dinately flexible tongues, the Stanford De
bate Society made a fantastic overall show
ing at the American Parliamentary Debate
Association National Championships,
placing three varsity teams in the tourna
ment's overall top 20 and winning the
novice division.
Senior Josh Sandberg, president of the
Stanford Debate Society, emphasized the
strength of the team's performance.
"In a league that often focuses on indi
vidual 'stars,' Stanford's performance was
unique because of our team's depth," he
said. "Nine of our 10 competitors received
at least one major award. Our veteran
teams did incredibly well — seventh and
ninth in an extremely competitive field —
and the strong performance of our novice
class — first place novice team and three
top speakers — bodes well for years to
come."
Held at Fordham University in New
York City from April 7 to 9. the APDA
national tournament drew 73 teams
from more than 30 schools around the
country, including other top-tier univer
sities like Harvard. Yale and Princeton.
Though varsity and novice debaters re
ceived separate awards, teams of both
calibers debated in the same field. In
each round, two-person teams argued
ethics, politics and social issues, with one
team presenting an advocacy for the
government and the other team repre
senting the opposition.
Junior Ray Seilie explained, "The gov
ernment team writes cases before the
round, so the opposition's only prepara
tion time is during the government's first
speech. Teams switch off during the tour
nament so that they have roughly equal
opportunities to debate as both the gov
ernment and the opposition. Parliamen
tary debate is unique because it isn't con
strained by a given topic for a given period
of time. TTie government team can force
you to debate about anything, anytime."
This format demands keen wit, a wide
base of knowledge and a solid sense of
strategy in prioritizing arguments during
the debate. According to the APDA,
"Rather than concentrating on extensive
preparation of evidence, APDA encour

ages a breadth, as well as a depth, of knowl
edge — as students can be forced to de
bate almost any topic at short notice, they
must have a working knowledge of all
manner of political, economic, social and
philosophical issues. A high premium is
placed on quick thinking and logical, rigor
ous analysis."
Added Sandberg,"Stanford Debate is a
fantastic experience.There is no better way
to develop persuasive speaking skills, con
fidence and the ability to dissect argu
ments quickly and effectively."
Stanford's squad exemplified these
skills as one of the top schools at the
APDA championships. Out of five teams
sent to the contest, three ascended to the
top ranks of the varsity tournament and
one placed first in the tournament's novice
division. Sandberg and junior Donny
Bridges made it to the varsity quarterfinal
round, placing seventh overall, while
sophomore Michael Baer and senior Si
hong Chan reached varsity octafinals and
took ninth place overall. Seilie and sopho
more Jai Krishan, a first-year debater,
combined to make a varsity/novice team,
placing 19th in the overall tournament.
Meanwhile, freshmen Anuraag Chiguru
pati and Anish Mitra beat out 27 other
teams to place first in the championship's
novice division, while also picking up two
speaker awards in recognition of their in
dividual talents. Krishnan received third
place in the novice speaker awards, and
Baer and Chan also received ninth and
thirteenth place speaker awards, respec
tively, in the varsity division.
Stanford's teams were also honored for
their overall performance throughout the
year. Baer and Chan were ranked sixth
overall in the End of the Year Standings,
while Krishan placed fourth and Chiguru
pati placed eighth in the Novice of the
Year rankings.
"The overall performance of the team
is especially striking since distance forces
us to compete far less than most other
competitive teams," Sandberg said.
"Some teams on APDA will attend 20
tournaments a year, whereas we can sel
dom make more than eight. Because of
this we get less tournament experience
and are often overlooked by mainstream
APDA. Donny and 1 were very much the
dark-horse candidate to break, much less
make it to quarterfinals — we busted
some brackets for sure. We were definite
ly underappreciated within the APDA
political structure. Nationals was a good
time to shine."
