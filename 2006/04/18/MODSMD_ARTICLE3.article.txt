# WILL STANFORD BE READY FOR THE NEXT BIG ONE?
## 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
One hundred years ago this morn
ing, a 7.8-degree earthquake rocked the
Bay Area, nearly obliterating a fledg
ling Stanford University. In the after
math that followed, 1906 Stanford mir
rored 2005 Tulane. The earthquake

killed two students, but the
damage could have been far

worse.
The question remains — is
Stanford ready?
University officials say
they are confident in their
emergency planning, and
that they take every precau
tion to prepare for a range of
disasters, including the next
major earthquake. The
caveat though, they say, is
that the University can only
be as prepared as its staff and
students.
"There has been a lot of
thought put into preparing
for this scenario around cam
pus," said Keith Perry, the
training and communica-

tions director in the Emergency Man
agement division of the University's
Environmental Health and Safety
Department. "Stanford is well-posi
tioned to be able to respond effec
tively in the event of another major
earthquake.
"Our first priority is the life safety of

students, faculty, staff and visitors on
campus," he added. "We are confident
that the basic needs of students would
be met."
An elaborate, publicly-available
emergency plan details the response
mechanism that would be put in place
after an earthquake. A central opera
tion center located at the Faculty Club

would he activated by the incident com
mander — currently the chief of police
— and 26 satellite operation centers
would come online. Each satellite cen
ter has developed its own local plan for
what to do in the event of an earth-

quake.
A contingent of volunteers on campus has
agreed to look at buildings' exteriors to get a
preliminary view of the damage.They will report
back to the satellite command centers, helping
engineers determine which buildings should be
focused on immediately.
The University emergency preparedness
system is designed around an all-hazards ap
proach, meaning that the protocol for an
earthquake response is very similar to that of
a terrorist attack. There are three categories of
events, ranging in severity from an easily-man
ageable level-one problem to a level-three
emergency.
The Situation Triage Emergency Team
(STAT) would convene via phone to decide
what resources were needed where.
"We have completed a lot of pre-planning for
an earthquake," Perry said.
He told The Daily that his staff continually
re-evaluates and re-considers the best respons
es to various disasters. Members also conduct
annual emergency exercises. A major earth
quake simulation prompted the activation of
the Emergency Operations Center the week
before last.
"It went quite well." Perry said of the run
through. "As with all exercises, our goal is to
identify areas we can improve for next year."
Perry declined to specify lessons learned in
this month's drill. But these planning efforts
have led to more preparation in the past.
For example, residential and dining services
significantly increased targets for how much
food and shelter is needed on inventory' in the af
termath of a quake as a result of such planning
efforts.
Electronics and communications hubs need
ed to keep the school running have also received
attention.
"Emergency generators have been installed
in many critical areas," Perry said.
Satellite phones have been procured so lead
ers on campus can maintain contact with others
in the event of local outages. If all else fails, emer
gency planners have designed a system for run
ners to carry messages from satellite command
posts to emergency headquarters. The school
even keeps ham radios in case all other backups
fail.
"Essential service facilities will be opera
tional," said Jean Barnes, the associate director
of the University's Land and Buildings Depart
ment.
Regular evacuation drills in the residence
halls are intended to help prepare students for
an earthquake.
Hotlines have been established for stu
dents, faculty, staff and parents in the event of
a major earthquake. These phone numbers or

Web sites could be vital tools to provide dis
persed populations with updates about the
status of recovery efforts in the aftermath of
a major disaster.
As a contingency. Stanford is partnering with
Duke University so leaders can post emergency
information online if the local systems still go
down.
A new facility that will house a state-of-the
art Emergency Operations Center is being con
structed adjacent to the current Public Safety fa
cility.
University officials say that there is only so
much they can do to plan for a quake. Ulti
mately, the ability of the University depends
on the level of preparedness of each individ
ual.
"The better prepared the individual is, the
better prepared the University is." Perry said."lf
people don't have plans, we encourage them to
get something into place so they are more pre
pared."
As a result, the University has declared
today Earthquake Safety Day. At each mobile
Housing Service Center from 11:30 a.m. until
1:30 p.m.. earthquake safety and preparedness
information will be available. Housing staff will
field student questions about how to prepare for
an earthquake and what to do when one hap
pens.
The lackluster response from authorities in
the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Or
leans last fall serves as a fresh reminder that peo
ple cannot always rely on someone else to pro
vide for them.
Government agencies, such as the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA),
recommend that people have first-aid kits,
extra blankets and 72 hours worth of food on
reserve.
Additionally, the University's response plan
will only be as strong as the people who execute
it.
"The response the University is able to pro
vide is based on individuals being available to
come to the University and support our re
sponse programs," Perry said.
Campus infrastructure personnel hope Stan
ford will be ready to start rebuilding immediate
ly after the next quake.
The school has enlisted the help of two
dozen structural engineering firms from north
ern and southern California, which will send
engineers to campus when an earthquake
greater than magnitude six occurs in the sur
rounding area.
"This provides great assurances that we will
have professional staff available to us to actu
ally help inspect our buildings in the event of a
major earthquake," Barnes said. "There's
going to be damage to buildings. Many may
have to be retrofitted again [after the next big
quake]."
