# WILL STANFORD BE READY FOR THE NEXT BIG ONE?

### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
One hundred years ago this morn
ing, a 7.8-degree earthquake rocked the
Bay Area, nearly obliterating a fledg
ling Stanford University. In the after
math that followed, 1906 Stanford mir
rored 2005 Tulane. The earthquake

killed two students, but the
damage could have been far

worse.
The question remains — is
Stanford ready?
University officials say
they are confident in their
emergency planning, and
that they take every precau
tion to prepare for a range of
disasters, including the next
major earthquake. The
caveat though, they say, is
that the University can only
be as prepared as its staff and
students.
"There has been a lot of
thought put into preparing
for this scenario around cam
pus," said Keith Perry, the
training and communica-

tions director in the Emergency Man
agement division of the University's
Environmental Health and Safety
Department. "Stanford is well-posi
tioned to be able to respond effec
tively in the event of another major
earthquake.
"Our first priority is the life safety of

students, faculty, staff and visitors on
campus," he added. "We are confident
that the basic needs of students would
be met."
An elaborate, publicly-available
emergency plan details the response
mechanism that would be put in place
after an earthquake. A central opera
tion center located at the Faculty Club

would he activated by the incident com
mander — currently the chief of police
— and 26 satellite operation centers
would come online. Each satellite cen
ter has developed its own local plan for
what to do in the event of an earth-


• Students mobilized to help the people of San Fran
cisco. President David Starr Jordan signed these cards
for safe passage in the city, which was under martial
law at the time.
