# Graduate Life
## My computer is better than yours 
### 
On average, graduate students
spend more time with their com
puters than their significant others
(if applicable at all). Thus, the choice of
computer becomes one of the most im
portant decisions a grad student may ever
make.
For eternity, most PC users have
proudly brandished their 'Intel Inside'
chips. And elitist Mac users with IBM
power PCs have sneered at every other
mortal using what seems more like a snail
inside a computer's clothing. Further
more, with Apple suddenly shifting to
Intel chips, things are more botched up
than ever before.
As for all you prospective Mac buyers
out there, here's some friendly advice: For
some applications the new Macs are bet
ter than the old ones; but for others they
are worse, and they may or may not match
the improvements promised. So for now
please just shut up and go back to whatev
er you were planning earlier — including
buying a lame duck Power-PC based
iMac).
That still leaves one question: What
could have possibly caused the breakup
between longtime sweethearts Apple and
IBM? While Apple is flush with new-love
jitters over Intel. IBM seems only too
happy to stop slapping together low
power G5 processors for the spare change
its ex was paying. After all, it has bigger
fish to fry — like gaming consoles.
The situation has left pretty much
every tech columnist and blogger on the
planet tearing his hair out to understand
the whole thing.
Did Intel make Steve an offer he
couldn't refuse? Why does Sun like AMD
when Dell likes Intel? Is one actually a
better processor than the other?
Five years ago, Intel spelled it out for
us: a higher clock speed makes for a bet
ter computer. So something with 2.4 GHz
in the advertisement is obviously better
than something with 833 MHz. But when
AMD started it's 'megahertz myth cam
paign' — telling us that 2 GHz Athlon XP
microprocessors could outperform a 3
GHz Pentium 4. Then Apple had to stir
the pot. explaining how an 866 MHz G4 is
faster than a 1.7 GHz Pentium 4 simply by
looking at the depth of the pipeline.
Why can't there be a simple perform
ance sheet that compares processors?
Why can't someone just do a simple
test — keeping the needs of the average
American consumer in mind — to assign
each one a grade, or a number between
one and 10.
If Robert Parker can rate the quality
of wine, which is far more subtle — not to
mention a function of personal opinion
— than microprocessors, then someone
can damn well score microprocessors.
AMD did, in fact, initiate a performance
ranking system for their processors, but it
was unilateral and didn't make a whole
lot of sense anyway. Things are actually
easier in the microprocessor arena.
Considering that Intel and AMD are
the only two computer processor heavy
weights on the market, why not have a
live, televised, head-to-head competi
tion? In all likelihood, it would be more
interesting and attract more viewers than
the last presidential debates. I demand a
showdown.
