For every earth-friendly poser, there's a
hip young environmentalist like
Kristina Keating actually doing some
thing to help our planet. A third-year
doctoral student in Earth. Energy and Envi
ronmental Sciences, she is tackling contami
nated water as both an environmental and
health problem.
A stylish Canadian with an engineering de
gree from the University of British Columbia,
Keating has always been an avid environmen
talist. While growing up in Vancouver, she de
veloped a passion for hiking, a pastime that
contributed to her concern for the earth's well
being.
"Even when I was in elementary school, I
helped in the school's recycling program," she
recalls.
Hoping to put her engineering degree to
good use helping the planet, she enrolled in
Stanford's School of Earth Sciences and began
researching water contamination.
Keating's studies, under the supervision of
Geophysics Prof. Rosemary Knight, focuses
on soil contamination resulting from pluto
nium and heavy metal production for nu
clear weapons in the United States.
"One of the large concerns about contami

nated ground water is that it will get into our
water sources and pollute our drinking water
as well as make the environment inhabitable
for animals that rely on natural sources of
water," she says. "Chemicals from nuclear
waste such as chromium, uranium as well as
petroleum products such as benzopyrene are
carcinogenic."
Her goal is to develop a field instrument
that the federal government and private com
panies could use to improve efforts to keep
pollution from entering drinking water
sources.
The current method used to measure
progress — drilling bore-holes and sampling
soil at various depths — is prohibitively ex
pensive because it requires disposing appro
priately of any radioactive materials uncov
ered in the samples.
Keating's proposed method to monitor the
remediation of contaminants in groundwater
employs a nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) technique that is similar to the mag
netic-based measurement used in MRI (mag
netic resonance imaging) machines.
In the past, NMR has been used to estimate
the distribution of water in the top 100 meters
of the earth and to examine the elements con-

stituting lab samples. Keating's research, how
ever, uses NMR to determine the changing
chemical compositions of groundwater.
Keating explains how it works, her brown
eyes flashing behind her thin black-rimmed
glasses. A sample of sand and ground water is
placed in a static magnetic field.The sample is
them pulsed with a smaller magnetic field and
again exposed to the original field. When the
protons are exciting upon the sample's return
to the original field, they emit a magnetic sig
nal revealing information about the sample's
chemical environment. This information can
be applied to determine whether the removal
of pollutants has been successful.
The Hanford Site in southeast Washington
State is of particular interest to Stanford re
searchers, including Keating. For at least 40
years, the site has been used for government
plutonium production, releasing chemicals
into the Columbia River.
Keating is part of the Soil Chemistry Group
on campus working with Geological and Envi
ronmental Sciences Assoc. Prof. Scott Fendorf.
She will also serve as a judge at the upcoming
School of Earth Sciences Research Review on
April 19. which will showcase the school's di
versity of projects.
