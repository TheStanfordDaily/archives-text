# Earth Sciences to share work across disciplinary borders
## 
### SINI MATIKAINEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Environmental land use planning, silent earthquakes
and their aftershocks, the changing environment of the
Arctic Ocean... Sounds like the Thursday night Discovery
Channel lineup or bullet points for an environmental pol
icy meeting. Actually, these are all topics of presentations
to be given at the Stanford School of Earth Science's
(SES) Research Review this week.
The event, which consists of oral presentations and
posters submitted by those in the School of Earth Sci
ences. provides an opportunity for students, post-doctor
al fellows, faculty, staff and research groups to communi
cate their research to the community
Earth science graduate student and committee mem
ber Rebecca Goldman says,"It gives students a chance
to communicate their research to their peers and to fac
ulty across all the departments and programs in SES. It
also gives students an opportunity to practice oral and

poster presentations, discussing their research in a suc
cinct, concise way."
Participant Hannah Scherer,a graduate student in ge
ological and environmental sciences, agrees, noting,"lt is
a great venue to gain experience communicating my re
search to a broad audience, something that I think it is
crucial for all scientists to be able to do."
When the now-annual event began three years ago, it
was a fairly casual affair. Organizer Derek Lerch, also
from geological and environmental sciences, says, "Be
fore, it was simply an informal 'open house" where people
used posters to present their research. Now. we've ex
panded it to include both poster and oral presentations. It
takes an entire afternoon, and we have judges select win
ners based on the presenter's ability to address a multi
disciplinary audience."
The event is open to many different fields, including
seismology, hydrology, tectonics, environmental policy
and any of the various topics covered by the School of
Earth Sciences. Presentations this year range from a dis

cussion on whether "impact assessments have impact" to
an investigation of geothermal fluids in Reykjanes, Ice
land. In the past, winning presentations have covered the
use of geochemistry to trace materials used in Native
American pottery and statistical uncertainties associated
with geochronology.
Some of the presentations also have a sociopolitical
bend. One such project by earth sciences graduate stu
dent Holmes Hummel examines greenhouse gas scenar
ios and how the interpretation of such scenarios could
impact public policy and private investment. Another
study investigates groundwater contamination in Cam
bodia.
There are also several posters highlighting outreach
opportunities, such as volunteer programs with elemen
tary school science field trips, a high school internship
program and a course that teaches how to effectively talk
about science with elementary school students.
Presenters say they chose to get involved for a variety
of reasons, but all agree on the value of having one's work

evaluated by the larger Stanford community.
Fourth-year geophysics doctoral candidate Kyle
Spikes, whose poster is entitled "Exhaustive Monte-
Carlo Simulation for Stochastic Petrophysical Inversion
of Seismic Data," says. "[The event) provides a way to
publicly present the research, which always helps you to
gauge the current status of your work. It's [also] a way to
share ideas with people who may not have previously
known what you are working on."
The event, scheduled for Wednesday. April 19, will
consist of two poster sessions, two oral sessions, a recep
tion. a dean's address and an award ceremony â€” during
which the best poster and presentation will be recog
nized. Judges, including faculty members, post-doctoral
students and senior graduate students, will select the best
presentation based on a combination of factors.
