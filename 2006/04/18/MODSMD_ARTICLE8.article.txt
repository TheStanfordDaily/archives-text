## Editorial Campaign promises: Made to be broken? 
### 
The ASSU elections are over. This
Board has made its recommendations
and levied its cautions. Stanford stu
dents have cast their votes — or not cast
their votes — and will live, either way, with
the consequences.
It's the nature of democracy that we are
forced to accept the results of this election or
any other.even if they didn't pan out the way
we hoped. But it is also our responsibility in
a democracy to constantly examine and re
examine the process in order to guarantee
elections that are as fair, informed and dem
ocratic as possible. Sadly, the recent ASSU
elections have confirmed that the Stanford
electoral process is severely deluded:
democracy on a bender.
There has been no shortage of dispiriting
factors in this election with which to take
issue. Voter turnout is up but still not exactly
robust. The election remained largely a con
test of name recognition rather than ideas.
How about fairness and transparency? We
would expect both to be givens in the rela
tively low-stakes battle for ASSU posts, but
the runner-up executive slate was accused of
elections infractions — damaging the in
tegrity of the process. And instead of satis
factorily resolving the dispute. Elections
Commissioner Tim Sanders came up with a
compromise that was heavily criticized by
both sides.
Even worse, the paucity of slates running
for office in this election was very discourag
ing. The discourse generated by executive
slates Rillera/Nguyen and Heng with Gra
ham was unexceptional, and Stanford stu
dents were faced with a severe lack of choice
across the board. A two-party system for a
campus as diverse and engaged as Stanford
is simply not acceptable.This Board, for one,
endorsed Hene with Graham but cautioned

that neither slate was impressive. It is our
sincere hope that there will be more quality
choices on the ballot next year.
But one of the bigger problems with the
elections process is that it doesn't hold can
didates accountable for what would be their
otherwise wild campaign promises. Candi
dates can get away with saying whatever
they want, without facing any real conse
quences if none of their plans come to
fruition. Worse yet, they don't even need to
provide any justification for their failures in
any kind of public forum. Unlike real politi
cians, elected members of Stanford's student
government never have to be afraid of their
constituents.
That is where we, as the Editorial Board,
come in. As journalistic vigilantes, we will
shake some holy fear into this year's elected
candidates by holding them personally ac
countable for their promises.
Elizabeth Heng and Lauren Graham must
make good on their talking points to make
Dead Week dead, bring back the Mausoleum
Party and increase the health care subsidy for
graduate students. All the class presidents
promise unusual and exotic off-campus loca
tions for their respective formals — we look
forward to being pleasantly surprised.
Also, we are encouraged by the level of
social awareness demonstrated by the vari
ous platforms. Junior class presidents Party
of Five have planned a charity auction for
the Ronald McDonald House, and sopho
more class presidents The Golden Ticket
have likewise promised to set up an online
retailer service where a portion of the trans
actions will go to charity. We want to see
these plans materialize.
But more importantly, we must hold the

individual senators accountable for
their campaign promises — promis
es all too quickly forgotten by the
student population. We are cau
tiously hopeful about freshman
Tomi Onatunde's sweeping plans
for dining reform — plans that in
clude having all dining halls and
both Late Nite venues open seven
days a week. Similarly, freshman
Nabill Idrisi should push forward
with his platform for Marguerite re
form —he promises to have the
shuttle stop further down Universi
ty Avenue and to reinstate the
Movie Express service.
We look forward to getting free
tickets to football games in our
mailbox if junior Marcelo Worsley
succeeds in his plans for Stanford
students to attend all sporting
events for free. We eagerly antici
pate junior Priyanka Goel's plans to
standardize the general education
requirements. We can't wait to hear
junior Valerie Villarreal's status re
port on her proposed Tresidder
Beer Pub for undergraduates. Like
wise, we wish freshman Nkemjika
Ugonabo all the best in her efforts
to increase the minority representa
tion among faculty members and
graduate students.
We hope that this editorial will
remind all recently-elected repre
sentatives that Stanford students
demand greater accountability from
them. We'd hate to be disappointed.
