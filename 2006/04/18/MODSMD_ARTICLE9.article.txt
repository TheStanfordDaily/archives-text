# Techie vs. Fuzzy
## 
### 
Somebody asked me the other day if I
was a "techie" or a "fuzzy." Now that's a
loaded question if I've ever heard one.
It is one thing to ask what a person's major is,
but the techie vs. fuzzy debate delves much
deeper into one's personality. This single
question goes far beyond simply which class
es you are taking; your answer categorizes
you into one of two distinct and rigid cate
gories: you are either analytic or contempla
tive, a realist or a dreamer. You can't have it
both ways.
Of course, a multi-faceted Stanford stu
dent at heart, I always try to straddle the line
between these two personality types and
claim the best of both worlds. "I'm an econ
major," I reply, leaving my interrogator to
infer what he will. (You have to give econ
majors props for their ability to simultane
ously scare away techies with incessant use
of "pseudo-science" and fuzzies with mathe
matical formulas galore.)
However, a better response might have
been,"I am whatever you aren't." For us
fence-sitters, it is easy to take on whichev
er persona best complements that of the
other person. Perhaps it is a sign of egocen
trism that we always try to hold onto some
thing at which we are better than our part
ner, but who doesn't like to feel smart
every once in a while? Besides, if opposites
really do attract, then nobody can blame us
for doing our best to make sure that we are
loved by everyone. So. we bust out the
mathematical reasoning during conversa
tions with English majors, and we philoso
phize to (and frustrate) all of our engineer
ing friends. It's a good life, being able to
confuse everyone.

If the world were full of people like me,
the whole techie vs. fuzzy thing wouldn't be
an issue at all. But that would be like a life
without radicals — the ultra-feminist bra
burners and hard-core Midwestern Repub
licans who make us feel pretty damn nor
mal in comparison. For that same reason,
we need computer science majors who pro
gram all day and hog all the computers in
the cluster just as much as we need English
majors who discuss Dickens all day and
hog all the tables at the CoHo. Those of us
who don't want to be forced to one ex
treme or the other have to appreciate those
who set the bar to mark the bounds of nor
malcy.
But the people who fall at the far ends of
the spectrum are often more versatile than
they get credit for. Behind those thick glass
es or beneath that corduroy jacket with the
elbow patches lie the well-rounded students
from those long-forgotten Stanford applica
tions. Hie problem is that, in choosing a sin
gle path to follow, these students have gotten
stuck within a comfort zone that they don't
want to leave. And the residents of these
comfort zones never intermingle. Think

about it — how many fuzzy-techie
couples have you seen strolling
around campus lately?
My theory is that people are
afraid of what they don't know.
Therefore, fuzzies avoid techies as if
they were physics problem sets, and
techies keep their distance for fear
that nearing a fuzzy would mean
being forced to read a Jane Austen
novel. It's not a matter of disliking
each other; rather, it is simply that
being around people who are good
at things that are foreign to you is in
timidating.
And nobody can blame them
for that — after all. who likes feel
ing stupid? Still, it would be inter
esting to see what would happen if
the civil engineering techies built a
bridge to the other side. Maybe the
fuzzies would come across and
teach them how to write romantic
poems. Could they live happily
ever after? It's hard to say — but at
any rate, they would probably give
birth to some cute future econ ma
jors.

Stephanie may be a newspaper

math team for eight years (and is
slightly embarrassed to admit to that
in print). So, whether you are a
techie or a fuzzy, she understands
