# NOT TO CARE
## Global Warming: Smackdown on the Skeptics 
### 
Don't let the biking fool you. Many of
those cycling students aren't loyal sol
diers of a green revolution. Rather,
they comprise the rank and file of the "cli
mate change ambivalent."
Though open to the conclusion that an
thropogenic global warming is a reality, the
Stanford-trained skeptic in them is coy. The
media has failed to provide them with sophis
ticated enough evidence to assuage their
doubt, so they project it onto you.TVain your
self with the facts, because if you're not care
ful, you too may be caught off-guard by their
logic games and youthful assumptions.
Let's take one hesitant student I stum
bled upon last week. Feeling confident in
the statistics training he earned as an under
graduate political science major, he looked
at me coolly and explained, "Just because
there is a correlation in the data doesn't
mean there is causation." Leaning back in
his chair with right eyebrow raised he con
tinued: "Plus, it's a violation of the scientific
method — people just realized that it's
warmer and thought up reasons to explain it
after. Someone could just as easily think up
reasons for the earth to be cooling." Not to
be outdone by the eavesdropping actual sci
ence student across the room, he quickly
added, "You know, in the 19705, they
thought the world was cooling."
In the state of today's public debate, the
latter is an enticing argument. The climatolo
gists just can't get it straight — they're flip
floppers!

In reality, though, today's consensus
among scientists — that the earth is warming
and that it's likely due to human activity — is
founded on much better- researched and un
derstood phenomena than the cooling fad
that went out of style with leisure suits.
(Rumor has it that it was the press who really
had its panties in a bunch about cooling in the
19705, anyway).
The fundamental explanation of the
earth's natural greenhouse effect — key to
understanding global warming — has been
uncontroversial for years. The gases that com
prise the earth's atmosphere don't block visi
ble light coming in. However, after this light is
absorbed by the earth, it is re-emitted as
warm infrared radiation, much of which be
comes trapped via absorption by some of
those same atmospheric gases, called green
house gases. These gases, especially water
vapor and carbon dioxide, then reemit even
warmer radiation, heating the surface of the
earth and making its climate hospitable to
life. Without this natural effect, the earth's

surface would be on average 60 degrees
Fahrenheit cooler than it is now.
So far, no debate. Even the kids in Kansas
learn this.
The claim our resident skeptics are hesi
tant to accept is that this natural greenhouse
effect has been significantly enhanced by the
emission of great volumes of gases, mainly
carbon dioxide, that trap infrared radiation
and further warm the earth's surface.
It is now generally accepted, as a point of
fact, that the surface temperature of the earth
has risen about 0.7 degrees Celsius since 1860.
Scientists say they know why — excess car
bon dioxide emissions from the combustion
of fossil fuels — and their data may convert
our lingering doubters.
Skeptic Claim #1: There's no way to prove
this isn't just a natural fluctuation.
Scientist Smackdown: Consider a prepon
derance of the evidence.
Most scientists would be quick to admit
that almost all phenomena come with some
associated uncertainty — but that doesn't
prevent them from reaching sound conclu
sions when in the presence of overwhelming
evidence.
"The rate of increase in temperature today
is greater than that during any time since the
deglaciation after the last ice age," explains
Mark Z. Jacobson, associate professor of civil
and environmental engineering. "For exam
ple, the rate of temperature increase from
1958 to 1999 was 1.1-1.4 degrees Celsius per
100 years. For comparison, the rate of increase

during the last 1 .(XX) years was about 0.052 de
grees Celsius per 100 years. At no time during
that period was the rate of change of temper
ature so great as it is today."
Using data from ice cores and ocean sedi
ments, scientists can trace historic tempera
tures from far before humans starting keep
ing records. "In sum." Jacobson added, "the
rate of temperature change today is unprece
dented for an interglacial period."
Proof beyond a reasonable doubt? If not,

Skeptic Claim #2: Atmospheric Levels of
CO2 have risen, and so have temperatures.
But we don't know that they have anything to
do with each other.
Scientist Smackdown: You clearly haven't
checked out enough hot models.
"Models show cause and effect; data show
correlation only," Jacobson said. "Numerical
models are unanimous in showing that in
creases in CO2 increase temperatures, partic
ularly over Northern Latitudes, causing melt
ing of snow and sea ice."
Models, like those that Jacobson works on,
imitate atmospheric chemistry, another topic
where researchers have a good grasp on the
science relevant to global warming. Different
gases contribute in different amounts to ra
diative forcing — the balance of radiation
coming into the atmosphere and that going
out. Carbon dioxide is the source of half of all
radiative forcing, because of its very large at
mospheric concentrations.
Other greenhouse gases like CFCs 11 and

12 — phased out because of the damage they
caused to the ozone layer — have atmospher
ic concentrations more than 400,000 times
lower than those of CO2. However, because
of their greater ability to absorb light and ten
dency to capture wavelengths of infrared ra
diation that would otherwise go unabsorbed,
these CFCs are responsible for about 20 per
cent of total radiative forcing. In other words,
emitting a given mass of CFCs would upset
the balance of radiation coming into and out
of the earth's atmosphere 6.400 times as much
as that same mass of CO2 would. In the at
mosphere, a given mass of methane, another
greenhouse gas, causes 69 times the radiative
forcing as the same mass of CO2 would.
Knowledge of this and related atmospher
ic phenomena allow scientists like Jacobson
to claim confidently that human-induced in
creases in greenhouse gases really do lead to
warming of the earth's surface temperatures.
Still holding out? Just to warn you, they say
wisdom comes with age.
Skeptic Claim #3: Well still, this isn't valid.
No one predicted this, they just made up a
theory once they realized that temperatures
were increasing.
Scientist Smackdown: Tell that to Svante
Arrhenius, who speculated in 18% that a dou
bling of CO2 levels would increase the earth's
temperature by five degrees Celsius. Or Stan
ford's own Steve Schneider, for one, who has
been working in climate change for decades.
And they say Americans lack a sense of
history.
