## Our hopes for the new Old Union 
### 
Most other universities, large or
small, rural or urban, have a decent
student union — a place where
people go to hang out, knowing that there
will be a variety of dining and entertain
ment options.Tresidder Union doesn't even
come close.
It is no mystery why so few people hang
out at Tresidder except during weekday
lunch. The food options at night and on the
weekends are extremely limited — only
Subway and Peet's stay open. The inside of
Tresidder is anything but cozy — rows upon
rows of plastic tables and chairs creating an
ambience of a high school or airport cafete
ria. And there's just nothing else to do there.
The lounge area on the second floor of
Tresidder is slightly nicer — at least it has a
few comfortable couches facing each other
and the decor is more inviting — but not
much more conducive to socializing. Seat
ing space is very limited, and food and activ
ities are scarce.The meeting rooms are fine,
but that's all they are — meeting rooms.
The only campus location that somewhat
recreates the atmosphere of a student union
is the CoHo, but it closes early on weekends.
This defeats the point of a student union,
which is supposed to provide students with
a place to meet up and relax, especially on
weekends. Anyone who's walked around
campus on a Friday or Saturday night knows
that it's absolutely dead, except for a few
Row house parties. Having a good student
union would remedy this problem.
The University is currently remodeling
Old Union to transform it into a student
hub worthy of its name. What we would like
to avoid at all costs is repeating the mis
takes that were made in the designs for
Tresidder.
In order for the new Old Union to attract
students and become the thriving hang-out
spot of choice, a few key improvements
need to be made. First, it should offer a vari
ety of late-night food options and coffee.
These eateries should be open later than the
CoHo, and stay open until 2 a.m, for exam

ple.There should also he ample, comfy study
space in close proximity to the food.
Aesthetics might not seem crucial, but
they are. No one wants to spend time in a
place resembling an airport terminal from
the 19705. Comfortable couches and chairs
would significantly enhance the space, as
would non-plastic tables. And in order to
attract students looking for something to
do besides eat and talk, there should be a
few big-screen televisions, a combination of
ping-pong, foosball and air hockey tables,
and chess boards or other board games. The
idea is to get students who may never have
met otherwise to congregate and socialize.
In particular, we firmly believe that the
remodeled Old Union should make more
student space available to ethnic communi
ties and other student organizations. This
space should be as flexible and dynamic as
possible, so as to foster greater cooperation
among groups that might then collaborate
on campus-wide events to the benefit of the
entire Stanford community.
Once the initial setup is in place, it
should be relatively easy for various stu
dent organizations to organize fun events,
including parties, mixers, performances and
movie screenings. People who like to study
with company could do so at the new Old
Union, as some already do at the CoHo.
Once the new Old Union is finished, the
biggest challenge will be to establish it as
the premiere hang-out location on campus.
If student expectations and requests have
been successfully met, that process should
occur naturally — but if they haven't, it
may never happen. So now is the time to
make your voice heard, while our new Old
Union is still in its early phases of develop
ment. Tell the administration what you
want the finished product to be.
Our hope is that the transformed build
ing will be so popular that in a couple of
years, when students want to socialize on
campus, they won't think twice about where
to go — Old Union will be the obvious an
swer.
