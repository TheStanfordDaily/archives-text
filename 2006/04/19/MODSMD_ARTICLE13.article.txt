# The
						cult of Internet video
## 
### 
Before college, the art of the Internet
video existed only on the periphery of
my consciousness. Sure, I had seen the
"Badgers" video and dabbled in "Homestar
Runner" — I even had friends who talked
incessantly about their alter egos. Teen Girl
Squad (although 1 never understood why
one of them willingly accepted the persona of
the "Ugly One.") But in any case, the Inter
net was mostly used for email or research; I
knew nothing of the vast assortment and
huge appeal of Internet videos, which would
come to dominate a substantial part of my
college life.
I think it started when someone sent the
"End of the World" video to my freshman
dorm chatlist. Everyone I knew was soon
quipping "WTF, mate?" — most impressive
were the few guys who could recite the entire
narration. William Shatner's dramatic 1978
rendition of "Rocketman" and the "Soccer
Practice" music video by Johnny McGovern
(a.k.a. The Gay Pimp) soon became much
beloved dorm favorites.
But everyone knows that the pinnacle of
Internet video-dom is "Ding Dong Song" by
Swedish pop sensation Gunther. It's a sub
lime combination of ridiculosity — the in
spired lyrics, Eurotrash techno beat,skimpily
clad backup dancers and gratuitously sexy
imagery. And above the din of the soft-core
music video rises the man himself: the charis
matic Pleasureman, Gunther in all his mul
leted, mustachioed, open-shirted glory. So
what is so appealing?
Every fan knows that — according to his
Web site (gunthernet.com) — the four most
important things in the Pleasureman's life
are "Champagne, Glamour. Sex and Re
spect!" Understand this and you're halfway
there. Even if you only enjoy Gunther's
throaty deadpans ironically, you have to
admit that "Ding Dong Song" is catchy. Play
Gunther at any Stanford party and people
are sure to dance and sing along.
For a while I liked to imagine that Stan
ford alone had tapped into the glory of Gun
ther, and I took joy in this discovery. But this
is not the case: in February, students at Yale

organized an effort to bring Gunther to the
campus, marking the Pleasureman's first
ever U.S. concert.Total cost, according toThe
Yale Daily News: Around $16,(XX), funded by
a student activities fee that was instituted last
year and by a special request to the Yale Col
lege Council. Oh, and the annual budget of
the committee that sponsored the visit:
$25,800. Gunther must have been the event
of the year.
Some students may have resented the ex
penditure for its decadence: clearly, these
naysayers just don't get it. And the entire al
lotment of 1,500 free student tickets appar
ently sold out within hours. Clearly, Yale stu
dents value their Swedish pop stars. Rumor
has it that one of Princeton's eating clubs will
be sponsoring a visit by Gunther this spring.
Senior Max Mednik has been attempting
to bring Gunther to Stanford, but due to the
cost of procuring the Pleasureman and the
lack of support from the Stanford Concert
Network, students might have to pay up
wards of $10 to see the concert. Sure, we love
our Internet-Gunther, but would we be will
ing to pay to see him sing (read: lip-sync)
live? Can the line between the cult classics of
Internet video-dom and real life actually be
blurred this blatantly? Hopefully Stanford
will eventually have the chance to find out.
And a last thought to contemplate: Be
fore Gunther embarked on his musical ca
reer in 2004, he was a club owner and former
fashion model. Awesome.

Next year, Marissa is planning to run for ASSU
Senate with a platform entirely devoted to a
Gunther-visit effort. Show your support at
