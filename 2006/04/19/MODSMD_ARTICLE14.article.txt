Over-representation is not an issue
An argument in Monday's editorial
("The SOCC: A blight on the democratic
process?", Apr. 17) was flawed.To argue that
minorities are "overrepresented" in the Un
dergraduate Senate is fine in and of itself.
However, to argue that there is a problem
with said overrepresentation is not fine. It

suggests that there is some allowable quota
of minorities in the Senate. It also implies
that the majority of the Senate should, by de
fault, be white and that minority groups
should be content with lesser roles. I find
that argument disconcerting.
