# Time for a Band-Aid
## 
### 
Roughly two weeks after I came to
Stanford, I remember walking across
campus to the "old" Stadium and feel
ing a sense of excitement about going to a
"real" college football game. As an under
graduate, 1 attended a small liberal arts col
lege with a weak athletic program, even for
Division 111 NCAA schools. I then enrolled
at Columbia for graduate school, where I
found the anti-athletic culture to be a lot
more about Ivy League status than the suc
cess of the school's athletic programs. In
truth. I ached for a true collegiate athletic ex
perience. Stanford, it seemed, was a place
where academic and athletic excellence col
lided.
As I approached the stadium, I remember
the thrill of hearing the Stanford Band blar
ing over the stands in anticipation of a colos
sal, coordinated and impressive display of
athletic support. The only problem: my sense
of participation in the event was completely
deflated by the image of the Stanford Band.
Sure, they sounded great, but I left the game
wishing that they had nothing to do with my
experience. Even if I wasn't strongly offend
ed, the role of controversial humor and anti
conformist sentiment was new to me. I didn't
necessarily expect a band that would look
like all the other college bands, but the sense
of anti-conformist chaos didn't do anything
to bring out my school spirit.
Now, before I get emails from all the
members of the Band and their allies, let me
first declare that my reaction was natural, so
I'm not really sorry for it. My idea of the role
and organization of a collegiate marching
band was challenged, and since that seems to
be one of the main goals of the Stanford
Band, I'm hardly surprised at that outcome.
However, as I began to think seriously about
what the band was doing, I concluded that
the anti-conformist approach was, in truth,
the extent of their contribution.
From there, my criticism of the Band
shifted from a difference in taste to a differ
ence in understanding. Based on my own ex

perience as a marching band member in high
school and as a participant in Drum Corps
International throughout college, I have
given a great deal of consideration to the
role of the marching band. I understood it to
be something that incorporates as many
members of the event as possible. At Stan
ford, it seems, the role of the Band is to pro
vide a space for its members to reject con
formity, not to be a unifying element of our
entire community.
Now, 1 can appreciate the way that the
Band attempts to use humor and free spirit
edness to encourage celebration and healthy
competition. And I don't want to imply that
these events should be only about the athlet
ics. But when I think of the Stanford Band,
images and thoughts of confusion are all that
come to mind. What is its intent?
I'm not going to suggest that Stanford
shifts to a more traditional, mainstream
marching band style. Apparently being dif
ferent is important to our legacy. But as a dis
senting perspective, I have to question why
my desire for a disciplined, traditional
marching band is somehow conflicting with
the tradition of Stanford athletics, music and
school spirit. Can't we compromise?
In light of recent alumni efforts to change
the Band. I think it's important that we make
room for these dissenting perspectives. Oth
erwise, the anti-conformist tradition of the
Stanford band will be so institutionalized
that it will amount to a purely reasonless tra
dition only for its own sake.
I also think that Band members should
be sensitive to the ways that they represent

the institution and the community, not just
themselves. In my view, the Stanford Band
should be just as central to our school spir
it as the football team — and music and
athletics should be appreciated equally.
Sure, I can see how controversial humor
and anti-conformist behavior should have a
place somewhere in our tradition, but I
don't see why it is the only tradition that
persists. And insofar as this tradition actu
ally alienates me, I'd like to suggest that the
band is actually more counter productive
than anything.
If the band doesn't conform, that's fine.
But it doesn't have to offend and alienate. I
think if the band explored the range of possi
ble contributions, it would become more ap
parent that innovation and distinctiveness
can be easily incorporated into their reper
toire in better ways. Furthermore, Stanford
has a reputation for excellence that is neither
common nor reproducible. Crisp design,
sharp execution, musical excellence and inte
grated school spirit can — and should — be
a central theme, even if the outcome looks
different from other models.
Finally, I'm not sure that I have a solution
to the Stanford Band problem. As a matter of
taste, I'd like to see a more traditional band.
I'd like not to be offended. I'd like to take
pride in the Stanford Band in the ways that I
take pride in other aspects of the Stanford
community. I'd like to get excited about
music and athletics taken together, fused in
separably in the pursuit of excellence
through integrity. I'd like to see a precise drill,
dazzling color guard and messages that Stan
ford does not conform to mediocrity through
the pursuit of brilliance. In sum, I'd like to
like the Band.
Do my thoughts go against the non-con
formist spirit of the Band, or support it? I
can't tell, but I'd like to encourage alterna
tives.
