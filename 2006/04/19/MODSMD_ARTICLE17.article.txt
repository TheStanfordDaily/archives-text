## The 						LSJUMB responds to allegations 
### SAM URMY 
Friday's article, "Band Marches Into
Public Criticism," has forced us, the staff of
the LSJUMB, to own up to the facts and
come clean with the Stanford Community.
The Band has kept its true motives well hid
den up until now, but under increasing
scrutiny of the press. University administra
tors and insightful alumni, we feel it is in the
best interest of everyone to lay all the cards
on the table:
Plans have been in the works for some
time to modify the water systems in Branner,
Alondra and the B-Wing of Roble to deliver

Steel Reserve High-Gravity malt beverage
through faucets, shower heads and drinking
fountains. Because let's face it, no one's going
to join the Band unless we sap and im-purify
their precious bodily fluids first.
On March 13, the new Dollies shot and
killed two law enforcement officers in Santa
Clara.
We intend to repaint Hoover Tower by
smearing the north and west faces with our
own excrement. We feel that "poop" would
be a marked improvement over the current
color scheme "urine."
The Band does not believe that Catholics
are worthy of public ridicule, we think they

are delicious. Last month our Manager, Mike
Priest, let us eat one of his kidneys, confirm
ing what was just a hunch beyond our wildest
hopes. The next time Stanford plays Notre
Dame, we will endeavor to consume as many
Irish fans as possible.*
The Incomparable Leland Stanford Ju
nior University Marching Band is a group of
musicians that categorically refuses to take it
self or anyone else too seriously. It is a
"marching" band that believes that scream
ing and contagious joy will beat "clean uni
forms and snappy routines" under almost any
circumstances. We perform in public
more frequently than any other stu
dent musical group. We let anyone
join who wants to. We will not poop
on you.
The Band has been getting public
criticism for as long as anyone can
remember. Even back in the dark
ages when we still actually marched,
Ilie Daily would periodically edito
rialize that we weren't up to the stan

dards of East Coast and Midwest
bands. A few alumni will always be
angry with us. But if we'd caved
under all those complaints, we could
have all too easily ended up like
USC's band — that is to say, wearing
capes and making you listen to the
same three songs over and over and
over and over...
The bottom line is this: the
LSJ UM B wants to support our teams
and spread joy and funk to people
who do not have these things. We wel
come constructive criticism, fan mail,
song suggestions and indecent pro
posals at any time — use our online
feedback form at http://lsjumb.stan

ford.edu/contact.html, or email me
directly at urmy@stanford.edu. Be
lieve it or not, a fair number of people
are willing to put in hard work to
make the Band as awesome as possi
ble, and we will listen to you. So don't
worry, be happy and always dance to
the music.
*The Band is not actually planning to
do these things, though it is unfortu
nately too late for those two cops.
