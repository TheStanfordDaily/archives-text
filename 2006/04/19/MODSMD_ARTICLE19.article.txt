## Baseball avoids worst losing streak in more than a decade with 12-5 win over Sacramento State SAVING FACE 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
After dropping four straight games, it
must have felt good for the members of the
Stanford baseball team to beat visiting
Sacramento State by a 12-5 final yesterday
evening at Sunken Diamond. But after
being held to just five runs in those four loss
es, it must have felt even better to see some
thing other than goose-eggs appear on the
Stanford line of the scoreboard.
Looking to avoid a fifth-straight loss and
their worst losing streak in more than a
decade, the Cardinal (16-15, 2-7 Pac-10)
came out swinging. Outfielders Ryan Sea
well and Joey August started the Stanford
rally in the bottom half of the opening
frame with back-to-back singles, and both
came around to score when senior shortstop
Chris Minaker ripped a double to left-cen
terfield.
Sophomore Michael Taylor was then hit
by a pitch, and after a sacrifice bunt and a
foul-out, third baseman Chris Lewis came
to the plate with two on, two out, and a
chance to extend the Stanford lead and give
his team a much-needed burst of offensive
energy.
The senior came through, shooting an
other double to the left-centerfield gap to
bring Minaker and Taylor home.
Those four runs were all that Cardinal
starter Matt Leva would need. The junior
righthander shut down the Hornets lineup,
surrendering only four hits and a single un
earned run in five innings of work. Stan
ford's relief unit of junior Blake Holler,
freshman Austin Yount and sophomore
I rik Davis closed out the victory, which was
effectively decided by the start of the fourth
inning when the Cardinal led 9-1.
Minaker and Lewis both went on to have
nearly identical days at the plate — both
players collected three hits, two doubles and
three RBI to pace a revitalized Stanford
lineup. Taylor and senior catcher John Hes
ter also contributed two RBI apiece.
The Cardinal hit the road this week,
looking to get back on track with a three
g;ime set against Arizona in llicson. After
being swept out of town last weekend
against a tough Oregon State squad, the
Stanford squad is looking to battle its way
out of the bottom spot in the Pac-10 confer
ence standings.
