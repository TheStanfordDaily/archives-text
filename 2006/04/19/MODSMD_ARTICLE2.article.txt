# Hennessy slams policy
## President attacks military's 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy in statement 
### DAVID STEINHARDT 
President John Hennessy and Law School
Dean Larry Kramer each issued statements last
week criticizing the United States military's
"Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy regarding homo
sexuals in the armed forces.
The controversial policy is currently a heated
subject of debate after OUTLAW, the Law
School's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender
(LGBT) association, sponsored an event on April
5 that featured a panel of military veterans — and
members of the homosexual community —
speaking to the Law School community.
Law student Michael Angelo, co-president of
OUTLAW, explained some of the reasons the
group sponsored the event.
"[We hosted the] tour, so as to engage the Law
School and greater Stanford community in discus

University administration remains silent and inac

"We believe that the military's 'Don't Ask.
Don't Tell' policy is a mistake and that it deprives

the military of many qualified candidates," Hen
nessy said in his statement. "Second, we believe the
Solomon Amendment's requirements on access of
military recruiters, although clearly supported by
the Supreme Court decision, create an unhealthy
precedent of using the government's funding of re
search and education to restrict other university
freedoms."
Kramer was similarly supportive.
"We will continue to work with students to
protest the Solomon Amendment and military re
cruitment on campus, just as we will work with stu
dents and legal scholars to devise strategies to
change current government policy and the mind
set it reflects," he said in his statement. "These
tasks will take resolve, but I am confident that the
commitment of the Law School community will
