# Hennessy slams policy
## President attacks military's 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy in statement 
### DAVID STEINHARDT 
President John Hennessy and Law School
Dean Larry Kramer each issued statements last
week criticizing the United States military's
"Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy regarding homo
sexuals in the armed forces.
The controversial policy is currently a heated
subject of debate after OUTLAW, the Law
School's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender
(LGBT) association, sponsored an event on April
5 that featured a panel of military veterans — and
members of the homosexual community —
speaking to the Law School community.
Law student Michael Angelo, co-president of
OUTLAW, explained some of the reasons the
group sponsored the event.
"[We hosted the] tour, so as to engage the Law
School and greater Stanford community in discus

sion around 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell,'" he said. "But
we are also lobbying the Law School and Univer
sity administration to come out in support of our
organization and all LGBT students at Stanford."
In an email to the Daily prior to the release of
Hennessy and Kramer's statements, Angelo ex
pressed concern that University officials were not
doing enough to speak out against the contentious
military policy.
"I must note that while the Law School admin
istration has been overwhelmingly supportive, the
University administration remains silent and inac
tive," he said.
On the heels of Angelo's criticism. Hennessy
and Kramer each issued statements that not only
condemned the policy, but also expressed support
for students protesting military discrimination.
"We believe that the military's 'Don't Ask.
Don't Tell' policy is a mistake and that it deprives

the military of many qualified candidates," Hen
nessy said in his statement. "Second, we believe the
Solomon Amendment's requirements on access of
military recruiters, although clearly supported by
the Supreme Court decision, create an unhealthy
precedent of using the government's funding of re
search and education to restrict other university
freedoms."
Kramer was similarly supportive.
"We will continue to work with students to
protest the Solomon Amendment and military re
cruitment on campus, just as we will work with stu
dents and legal scholars to devise strategies to
change current government policy and the mind
set it reflects," he said in his statement. "These
tasks will take resolve, but I am confident that the
commitment of the Law School community will
provide the energy needed to help bring about change."
Both Hennessy and Kramer touched on the importance
of speaking out against injustices such as "Don't Ask, Don't
Tell" and the Solomon Amendment.
Kramer noted that it is essential to "cast light on these is
sues," while Hennessy said that he is "hopeful that such advo
cacy will hasten the day when the military adopts a policy that
treats all individuals willing to make the supreme sacrifice for
their country with equal respect under the law."
OUTLAW members said they were pleased to see Uni
versity administrators speak out against the "Don't Ask,
Don't Tell" policy as well as the Solomon Amendment, which
was upheld in last month's FAIR vs. Rumsfeld Supreme
Court decision and protects the military's right to recruit on
Law School campuses.
"It is gratifying to have such strong statements of sup
port from President Hennessy and Dean Kramer," said law
student Spencer Jones, co-president of OUTLAW. "1 hope
to see continued backing and affirmative leadership from
them on these issues as we work to further advance equali
ty for LGBT individuals both at Stanford and in the nation
as a whole."
