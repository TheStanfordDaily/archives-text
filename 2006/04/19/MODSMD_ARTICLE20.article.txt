## Taekwondo team takes seven medals home from Japan; every competitor places 
### CALEY ANDERSON DESK EDITOR 
How good is Stanford's Taekwando team?
At the first Japan Kumamoto International
Open on April 2, seven of the eight Stanford ath
letes who attended walked away with medals: two
golds, three silvers and two bronzes. The eighth
didn't place because she broke her nose before
her fight and spent the day at the hospital.
Two of the silver medals resulted from final
matches in which the division championship came
down to Stanford versus Stanford. Considering
Stanford was only one of two U.S. teams compet
ing. and the United States was one of nine coun
tries (including Korea) attending, that's not too
shabby.
Instead of driving them apart, facing each other
in the finals brought the team closer.
"It takes the pressure off, in some ways, be
cause you're happy whoever wins," said fifth year
grad student Audrey Yap.
In Yap's final against freshman teammate
Jenssy Rojina, the coaches even refused to coach
the two of them against each other, so freshman
T.J. Leising and fourth-year grad student Paul
Twohey — who were gearing up to fight each
other next in their own final — stepped in.
"The coaches told us to have fun," Yap said.
"The refs, however, told us we needed to have
[coaches]. So we dragged the guys over in their full
gear and the refs burst out laughing."

They know how to have fun, yet still manage to
train hard and be a competitive program.
"It's the best place I've ever coached and the
best people I ve ever worked with," said head
coach Tim Ghormley, who before coming to Stan
ford six years ago was the head coach at UC-East
Bay. He was recruited to come to the Farm and has
since helped the program blossom.
"When I first got here, the program was purely
recreational in nature," Ghormley said. "But we
have expanded the class offerings and carved out
time for a purely competitive team, so we now
reach all levels of students and have grown from a
dozen members to 150."
The Taekwando program seamlessly blends
club and competitive elements, putting on classes
for those just learning how to kick and dedicating
time for the members of the intercollegiate team
to practice advanced skills for competition.
"We are a good spectrum of the whole Univer
sity," said first-year grad student Filip Paun.
"There are people from every age group, ethnic
background and grade. We have everything."
The club is open to all Stanford
students, faculty, staff and commu
nity members, adding an additional
element of diversity to the program.
"The community adds only posi
tive elements," said Twohey. "It's
the best program in the area, so you
get people interested in Taekwan
do. And the alumni stay around and
watch your matches."
With the opening of the new Ar
rillaga Recreation Center this year,
the Taekwando club gained genuine
practice space, which allowed it to
start a visiting athlete program. It
was this program that allowed Leis
ing, a freshman from Santa Clara
University, to begin practicing with
the Stanford team. Leising also just
happens to be, in his division, the sec
ond-best competitor in the nation.
"The traveling [back and forth
between Santa Clara and Stanford]
is a small price to pay for the great
training," said Leising. "I wanted to
make sure it wasn't military training
on a gym floor, and it's not.The club
and team are like a family."
The closeness of the teammates

is obvious in their interactions.They
finish each other's sentences and
flow in and out of stories, teasing
one another while laughing the en
tire time.
"The team is very close knit, but
not cliquey," said junior Sharon Cu,
the club's president.
While the team supports one an
other, they are also active members
of the community. They host an an
nual summer camp for the Taek
wando stars of tomorrow, as well as
the Stanford Taekwondo Spring
Open at Maples Pavilion that will
be held on June 3 this year.
"The Open is huge," said Cu.
"We had to cap it at 500 people. It's
an open meet, so anyone can come,
from kids to adults, and all belt col
ors. It's the biggest and best tourna
ment around."
Before then, the team will face
Cal at the annual Big Kick (like Big
Game, but with fighting that won't
get you arrested) on May 5 at
Maples. If Stanford wins, the Cardi
nal will be the best in the league. It's
a friendly rivalry, however.
"The coaches of both teams are
friends," said sophomore Parilee
Edison (whose nose was broken in
Japan). "We help out at each other's
tournaments. We're looking for
ward to the competition."
