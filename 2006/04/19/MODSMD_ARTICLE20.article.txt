## Taekwondo team takes seven medals home from Japan; every competitor places

How good is Stanford's Taekwando team?
At the first Japan Kumamoto International
Open on April 2, seven of the eight Stanford ath
letes who attended walked away with medals: two
golds, three silvers and two bronzes. The eighth
didn't place because she broke her nose before
her fight and spent the day at the hospital.
Two of the silver medals resulted from final
matches in which the division championship came
down to Stanford versus Stanford. Considering
Stanford was only one of two U.S. teams compet
ing. and the United States was one of nine coun
tries (including Korea) attending, that's not too
shabby.
Instead of driving them apart, facing each other
in the finals brought the team closer.
"It takes the pressure off, in some ways, be
cause you're happy whoever wins," said fifth year
grad student Audrey Yap.
In Yap's final against freshman teammate
Jenssy Rojina, the coaches even refused to coach
the two of them against each other, so freshman
T.J. Leising and fourth-year grad student Paul
Twohey — who were gearing up to fight each
other next in their own final — stepped in.
"The coaches told us to have fun," Yap said.
"The refs, however, told us we needed to have
[coaches]. So we dragged the guys over in their full
gear and the refs burst out laughing."

They know how to have fun, yet still manage to
train hard and be a competitive program.
"It's the best place I've ever coached and the
best people I ve ever worked with," said head
coach Tim Ghormley, who before coming to Stan
ford six years ago was the head coach at UC-East
Bay. He was recruited to come to the Farm and has
since helped the program blossom.
"When I first got here, the program was purely
recreational in nature," Ghormley said. "But we
have expanded the class offerings and carved out
time for a purely competitive team, so we now
reach all levels of students and have grown from a
dozen members to 150."
The Taekwando program seamlessly blends
club and competitive elements, putting on classes
for those just learning how to kick and dedicating
time for the members of the intercollegiate team
to practice advanced skills for competition.
"We are a good spectrum of the whole Univer
sity," said first-year grad student Filip Paun.
"There are people from every age group, ethnic
background and grade. We have everything."
