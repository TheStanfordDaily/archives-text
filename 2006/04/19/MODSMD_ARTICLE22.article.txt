## Rowers receive redemption Women's team sweeps nine races at home invitational 
### JOHN CHOCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's women took to the water Fri
day looking for resurrection in Easter Week
end racing, and were not disappointed.
"[Our last regatta] didn't go as well as we
hoped," open-weight captain Susan Beville
said of her crew's disappointing result in the
San Diego Crew Classic two weeks ago,
where the Cardinal failed to qualify for the
grand final.
Friday's Stanford Invitational at Red
wood Shores, Calif., would give the No. 17
Card a chance to shake off that disappoint
ment and move on with the season.
Their shot at redemption would come in
races against perennial challenger Clemson,
a surprisingly strong University of Central
Florida crew and the No. 15 Lady Vols of
Tennessee.
Easter's gift to the team couldn't have
been better.
The women Card swept all three schools
in the first varsity, second varsity and novice
races, tallying nine wins in as many starts.
Their victories included a come-from-be
hind win over Central Florida that show
cased Stanford's newly regained compo
sure, and a blowout upset of Tennessee.
The Central Florida Golden Knights sur
prised Stanford by jumping to an early lead

in the first 500 meters.
"We knew it was going to be very close
from the start," head coach Aimee Baker
said, "'typically, we dominate at the start,
and UCF actually led us. Our crew was able
to come back in the second and third 500s,
and really just have confidence to push
through."
The Cardinal won that race by 2.1 sec
onds, and their restored confidence carried
them into the final race with Tennessee.
Stanford shocked the Lady Vols, command
ing an early lead and finishing open water
and nine seconds ahead of the women in or
ange.
"It was great to see Stanford come out
and lead from start to finish over Ten
nessee." Baker said. "That [was] a huge win

for us."
"Tennessee is a strong crew, so we'll
hopefully see them again at NCAAs if both
teams make it," Beville said. "There are a lot
of fast crews out there this year, so the next
few weeks should be really exciting."
The coming weeks pit the open-weight
women against undefeated No. 6 Washing
ton State in Pullman, Wash, this weekend,
and against No. 2 California in the Big Row
at Redwood Shores April 29.
"We had three really good races over the
weekend and learned more about our rac
ing style with each race," Beville said of her
first varsity eight crew. "The Stanford
women's team as a whole had a great week-

The heavyweight men's varsity eight, ranked second in the nation, remained undefeated over
the weekend by beating Oregon State, UCLA and No. 1 1 Wisconsin in three separate races.
end, and I think we ll carry that mo
mentum into our next few races
leading up to Pac-lOs."
Also competing in the Stanford
Invitational, the No. 2 heavyweight
Cardinal men's varsity eight kept
their perfect record intact with wins
over Oregon State, UCLA and No.
11 Wisconsin in a weekend that saw
the Stanford men continue to push
their undefeated season to new
heights.
"We rowed well against Oregon
State, better against UCLA, and
then rowed our best against Wiscon
sin," men's head coach Craig
Amerkhanian said.
The three victories included an
almost impolite 37-second margin
over the Bruins, and a hard-fought
finish against Wisconsin for the
Cappell Cup.

Stanford had opened up a com
fortable lead at the first 1,000-meter
half, but the Badgers mounted a
thrilling chase down the stretch.
"They pushed us almost harder
than we've been pushed all year,"
junior stroke Nate Rooks said.
"They came out and were walking
back really hard in the last 300 me
ters."
"They just kept on fighting," jun
ior six-seat Kevin Baum said. "They
raced Cal yesterday and were push
ing really hard, and the fact they
came out today and did it again â€”
no matter who they're racing and no
matter where they are, they just push
really hard. We have a lot of respect
for them."
For one rower, that respect took a
very specific form: sibling rivalry.
"My older brother Jimmy was the
bow seat of the Wisconsin boat,"
freshman Mark Murphy said.
The brothers had never raced
each other before, and probably
won't race again. "It feels good, to fi
nally one-up him."
