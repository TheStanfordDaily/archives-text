# Musings on the MVP maybes
## 
### 
Everyone is weighing in on who
deserves to be this year's
NBA MVP. There are at least
10 viable and deserving candidates,
and there is no shortage of opinions
about who is the best in the league.
My ego being what it is, I can't just
stand by and watch as people make
horrible pick after horrible pick.
To open any debate over who de
serves to win an award, the definition
needs to be clear. In this case it is
"Most Valuable Player" — not
"Most Outstanding," "Most Fun to
Watch" or "Best Player on the Best
Team." The MVP is the player who
makes his team better, leads them to
team success and is capable every
night of personal brilliance.
Each of these categories alone
might produce a totally different
winner among a totally different
field. To me, hands-down, the best
player in the league is Kobe Bryant.
It pains me to say this, being a War
riors fan and a law-abiding citizen,
but I don't think there would be any
legitimate debate about Kobe if the
award were simply for the most out
standing player. The guy is leading
the league with over 35 points per
game, he dropped 81 in one night (al
beit against a horrendous Raptors
squad) and he nearly single-handed
ly took the Lakers to the playoffs.
The only issue with Kobe is that
the Lakers lost a lot of games. They
are clinging on to the seven seed with
just 44 wins. While Kobe is by far the
most important player on the Lak
ers, he hasn't carried them to the
team success required for the MVP
award.
The "Best Player on the Best
Team" title goes to Chauncey
Billups, who has led the Pistons to
the most wins in their franchise's his
tory. The problem with his case for
MVP is that if you take him off the
Pistons, they still win the Central Di
vision. He was certainly helped by
having the surrounding cast that he
did, and while it may be unfair, he
must be penalized for how good the
Pistons are.
It isn't easy, but one by one you
can eliminate the candidates.
Steve Nash — not flashy enough,
and he hasn't really stood out. Plus,
he won it last year. Dwyane Wade —
still has Shaq, and the Heat have
stumbled down the stretch. Elton
Brand and Pau Gasol — too anony
mous. Tim Duncan — the Spurs are
great, but the individual numbers
just haven't been there. Josh Chil
dress — if only the MVP were decid
ed by who had the best hair, JC
would definitely be in the running.
After sifting through the mess, the
MVP race boils down to just two can
didates:
1. Leßron James — 1 know this
may not be entirely pertinent to this
discussion, but the man (and I do em
phasize man) is six months older
than I am.
What is relevant is that King
James, at age 21, has the skills, leader
ship ability and poise that even the
best veterans dream of. He is averag
ing more than 31 points per game,
has had five triple-doubles this year
and is probably the most explosive
player in the NBA. Maybe the most
telling stat is that he is leading the
league in minutes. The Cavs have
hopped on Leßron's back, and he
has carried them all the way to the
fourth best record in the East and
their first playoff berth since 1998.
If only Leßron played some de
fense. There are few flaws with LBJ's
game, but defense is one of them.
Fortunately, ESPN has put plenty of
Cavs games on TV this year (for
good reason), and it is clear that his
defensive effort just isn't there. Le-
Bron will win plenty of awards dur
ing his career, but this just isn't his
year. There has been one player this
year who is more deserving...
2. Dirk Nowitzki — It seems un
believable that I can give Leßron a
hard time about his defense and then
talk about how Nowitzki deserves to
win, but this year is different (My fa
vorite Dirk line: They should call him
Irk Nowitizki because he doesn't
know the first thing about D). The
Mavs and Dirk are playing some of
the best defense in the league. He is
the toughest matchup in the NBA
and he has almost single-handedly
kept the Mavs in the race for the best
record. The Mavs fell just short, giv-

mm
ing the Spurs home-court advantage
in a likely meeting of the league's
best two teams in the second round.
(The NBA playoffs are ridiculous,
but that's a whole different column.)
Nowitizki does have the propen
sity to have the occasional horrible
game in which he blows up and
shoots 3-of-15 from the field. But
night in and night out, he also has the
ability to create and make circus
shots while shooting 48 percent from
the field on the season.
Leßron will get his chance, but in
2006 the MVP belongs to Dirk —
with a D.
