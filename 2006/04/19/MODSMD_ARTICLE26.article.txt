# STUDENT LEADERS DOUBT REVAMPED SDS COULD SURVIVE ON CAMPUS
## The 						changing face of college politics 
### MELISSA FUSCO STAFF WRITER 
On January 16, several chapters of Students
for a Democratic Society (SDS) announced
plans to resuscitate the national organization
due to growing discontent with the war in Iraq.
While the group now has active chapters at
many campuses across the United States, it has
yet to come to Stanford, and student political
leaders believe the organization would not sur
vive were if it does.
According to Stanford students, college pol
itics have changed. The trend points away from
the tried-and-true methods of l%os activists
and toward a politically savvy, pragmatic ap
proach that focuses on working within the sys
tem.
Junior Nellie Selander, president of the Stan
ford Democrats, explained the difference be
tween her organization and SDS.
"It's not that the Stanford Democrats avoid
SDS tactics — we have organized protests and
sent letters to Congress too," she said. "It's that
our organization serves to operate within the
framework of existing political institutions."
Selander added that political affiliation af
fects the success of any reform movement.
"I ascribe to the idea that I may have more
influence working within one of the two major
political parties than I would attempting to
make changes from outside," she said.
SDS burst into the history books and onto
the national stage in December 1%4, when its
anti-Vietnam War march on Washington drew a
surprise crowd of 20,(XX). In the next four years,
membership in the organization grew to over
1(X),(XX).
The political group became the spotlight of
the countercultural "New Left," even as central
leadership weakened and factions formed. The
organization broke apart in 1969 and its legacy

was tarnished soon afterwards by a splinter
group, the Weathermen, which became infa
mous for its campaign of bombings, jailbreaks
and violent riots.
Today, the group aims to harness a 1960s
style groundswell of dissatisfaction with the un
popular overseas war. The organization's
newly-revamped Web site features photographs
of students storming a speech given by Florida
Gov. Jeb Bush and another photo of a student
being carried away by police.
"We must reassert the continuity of the rad
ical movements in American politics," said
Alan Haber, who founded SDS in 1959 as a
graduate student at the University of Michigan.
"The new technologies of communication and
independent media make this more possible
than ever."
But students at Stanford today are increas
ingly reluctant to take part in the radical meth
ods of the 1960s and widespread inter-collegiate
coordination, which dilutes participation and
tangle efforts in red tape.
"Running an effective, coordinated national
student campaign is really, really hard." said Kai
Stinchcombe. a graduate student in political sci
ence and former president of Stanford's chapter
of the Roosevelt Institution."! don't think SDS
really quite got there in the 1960s and 1970s —
most of what they tried to do at a national level
basically failed.
"My guess is the future SDS will be based on
groups of students who were already running
things like peace protests or living wage cam
paigns or ethnic and multicultural campaigns
calling themselves SDS," he added.
Timothy Telleen-Lawton, a co-terminal stu
dent in earth systems and former president of
the Stanford Greens, agreed that SDS would
have a hard time putting down roots at Stan
ford, where politically active student groups are
abundant but student participation is often

lacking.
"1 don't think the problem is a lack of inter
esting or effective student groups, but an issue of
students' priorities and activism falling behind
academics and recreation," he said. "I don't
think a new activist group would find a lot of fer
tile ground here."
Both Telleen-Lawton and Stinchcombe ex
pressed concern that SDS, with its diffuse liber
al message, would wind up competing against
other organizations with similar goals. Accord
ing to its mission statement. SDS "seeks a socie
ty free from poverty, ignorance, war, exploita
tion, racism and sexism."
Both conservative and liberal student lead
ers noted the shift away from grassroots ac
tivism as a sign of the times — a trend most re
cently embodied by the progressive Roosevelt
Institution, which focuses on producing policy
papers written by students.
According to Megan Reiss, a junior and com
munications director for the Stanford College
Republicans, the policy strategy has long been
appealing to conservatives on campus.
"I definitely don't think Republicans on this
campus are more apathetic than liberals," she
said. "A lot of conservative students have simply
circumvented the college political scene. We use
different means to show our political passions
than older generations — we try to get involved
directly at places like the Hoover Institution, by
working for policy-makers and authors."
Telleen-Lawton agreed that the new orienta
tion of politically active students has infused
campus organizations. Stanford students, he
said, are now more likely to think they can make
a difference by flexing their academic skills.
"The Roosevelt Institution has been able to
bring lots of students out of the woodwork by
asking for their policy papers — using their
minds, rather than just bringing their bodies to
protests," he said.
