# GREEK PROFILE
## Chi-O revolution draws turnout 
### ANDREW BURMON STAFF WRITER 
In the spring of 2004, then-sophomore Tam Vo had
just become editor of Intermission, The Daily's arts
and culture magazine, and was looking for material.
As part of a series she was writing called, "Seeking
Social Acceptance in Cruel Harsh Social Worlds," Vo
decided to rush sororities to investigate their inner
workings. She admits that she did not expect to actu
ally join the Greek system; rather, she wanted to get
a first-hand look at Greek life for her series.
"I never thought I'd join a sorority," said Vo, now a
senior. "In fact, people at The Daily kept warning me
not to join one, not to be sucked in."
But she couldn't resist. She was sucked in by Chi
Omega, a small un housed sorority with a dwindling
membership. She liked the girls and felt like the
sorority stood for values she admired. According to
Vo, the chapter she entered was less about, "flouncy
miniskirts, pearls and popped collars" and more
about the academic awards it won at the Chi Omega
national convention.
Chi-O's creed included an ultimatum to be, "dem
ocratic rather than exclusive; and loveable rather
than popular." These words stayed with Vo as she
joined the sorority and subsequently became its pres
ident for academic year 2004-2005.
Last year, under Vo's leadership, Chi-O launched
a revolution. Carly Anderson, a sophomore who
joined last spring as a member of the Alpha class, did
not hesitate when asked what turned the sorority
around.
"Tam Vo sparked what we on the inside call a 'riot
that turned into a revolution,'" she said.
The success of that revolution became obvious last
week when the Beta and Gamma pledge classes ac
cepted their bids to the Nu Sigma chapter of Chi-O.
This year is the first of many in which the Stanford
chapter of the sorority has met its national quota for
new members.
Amanda Valverde, a junior and current president
of Chi-O, explained the differences between this
spring's rush period and years past.
"This year, the focus for recruitment was to try to
show all of the prospective new members exactly what
we think being in Chi Omega represents," she said.
Valverde also stressed that the sorority did not have
to make a huge effort to pique freshman interest.

The Stanford chapter of the Chi Omega sorority met its
national quota for new members for the first time in
many years this spring.
"We did that by being our
selves," she said.
But. recruitment is not a one
sided affair when your sorority sud
denly becomes popular. The Chi-Os
had to spend numerous agonizing
hours deciding which prospective
new members deserved bids.
Thirty-one bids were offered and
the majority were accepted — a
great result for a chapter that as re
cently as last year feared its dissolu
tion.
"We wanted a pledge class full of
girls that we respected and loved,"
said member Caley Anderson, a
sophomore. "It was worth all of the
time and effort."
Valverde echoed Anderson's en
thusiasm for the new pledge class,
emphasizing the responsibility she
is willing to place on the sorority's
newest members.
"[New members] will be given a

chance to take ownership of the
sorority, even as pledges," she said.
The Chi-Os are not simply con
tent with putting up impressive rush
numbers, however, and say they are
ready to become a force on campus.
Valverde is proud of her sisters and
feels assured that they will make a
difference, "both on campus and in
the world."
In the meantime, the Chi-Os will
continue to do exactly what they
have been doing: supporting a
blood drive with Sigma Nu, making
Valentine's Day cards for kids at the
Lucile Packard Children's Hospital
and working with the Make-A-
Wish Foundation.
Vo, meanwhile, has no regrets
about her original journalistic foray
into the Greek system, and speaks
highly of the sorority she joined as a
result.
"[Chi-O] is a sorority in the best
sense," she said. "[lt is] a fraternity
of women who actively are chang
ing what it means to be Greek at
Stanford and what people can do
when they come together with a
shared vision."
