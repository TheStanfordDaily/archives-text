## ASSU talks judicial affairs Senate also discusses transition and publications policy 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate con
vened last night to discuss the transition from
this year's Senators to next years incoming
members. The Senate also discussed publica
tions policy and approved an amendment to
the Student Judicial Charter.
The Board of Judicial Affairs proposed a
change that would clarify the procedures for

a student accused of a Fundamental Standard
violation. Currently, a student can be accused
of both a Fundamental Standard violation
and of breaking a specific Student Conduct
policy for the same incident.
The proposed amendment would alter
the procedure and would "require all
charges relating to a single alleged case of
misconduct to be heard in a single proceed
ing." If the panel found the student guilty of
violating both a specific Student Conduct
policy and the Fundamental Standard, it
would levy only one punishment upon the
accused party
