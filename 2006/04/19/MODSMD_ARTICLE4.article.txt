## ASSU talks judicial affairs Senate also discusses transition and publications policy 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate con
vened last night to discuss the transition from
this year's Senators to next years incoming
members. The Senate also discussed publica
tions policy and approved an amendment to
the Student Judicial Charter.
The Board of Judicial Affairs proposed a
change that would clarify the procedures for

a student accused of a Fundamental Standard
violation. Currently, a student can be accused
of both a Fundamental Standard violation
and of breaking a specific Student Conduct
policy for the same incident.
The proposed amendment would alter
the procedure and would "require all
charges relating to a single alleged case of
misconduct to be heard in a single proceed
ing." If the panel found the student guilty of
violating both a specific Student Conduct
policy and the Fundamental Standard, it
would levy only one punishment upon the
accused party
While the amendment passed
unanimously in the Senate, it could
still be vetoed by University Presi
dent John Hennessy, the Graduate
Student Council or the Faculty Sen
ate.
After voting on the change, the
Senate heard from ASSU Publica
tions Director Brendan Marten,
who is also the chief operating of
ficer for The Daily. Marten de
scribed a proposal for distributing
student publications in dining
halls.
"Basically the idea is to get [pub
lications] out into the dining halls
within a month or two," he said."lt's

going to be a good thing. It'll give a
lot of publications on campus that
don't have regular drop points a
chance to have a slot, a space for
their publications across campus."
Marten also described how the
process would work.
"In terms of how the space will
be distributed, it will probably be
some variation of a first-come, first
serve scheme or certain publica
tions that fit certain criteria will get
a permanent slot," he said. "Other
publications that publish less fre
quently will operate on a rotating
schedule."
The Senate finished its meeting
by discussing the transition be
tween the outgoing senators and the
senators-elect for the academic
year 2006-2007, many of whom
were present at the meeting.
Sophomore Andrew Barragan,

an outgoing senator, proposed
handing over full voting rights to
the new Senators right after the
election results are certified at the
Senate's next meeting, scheduled
for May 2. He argued that this
would give the new senators some
experience before next year.
However, Senate Chair Chris
Nguyen, a junior, said that Barra
gan's proposal would be unconstitu
tional, since the Senate-elect must
meet as a group at least once before
they can claim voting rights.
Nguyen also expressed concern
that if outgoing senators lost their
voting rights, they would "check
out" and be unavailable to assist in
the transition process.
The Senate closed the meeting
by deciding that next year's sena
tors would assume their positions
on May 16.
