## SLAC calls for living wage increase

"Hey Hennessy: Where's the living
wage?"
So read the subject line of an email
circulated by the Stanford Labor Ac

showed up for the demonstration,
which called on University President
John Hennessy to increase the living

"We're kicking off our living wage
campaign aiming to pressure the Univer
sity to make its living wage policy con

SLAC maintains that Stanford's liv

surrounding region. The California
Budget Project, "a nonpartisan, non
profit organization seeking fiscal re

living in Santa Clara needs an hourly
wage of $13.41 to survive.
"$11.36 isn't really a living wage for
the Bay Area, where the cost of living is
much more," said Alexandra Goldman,
a junior. "We're hoping to see a wage
that's more appropriate."
