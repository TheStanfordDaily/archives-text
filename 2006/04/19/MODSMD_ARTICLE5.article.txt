## SLAC calls for living wage increase 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD MANAGING EDITOR 
"Hey Hennessy: Where's the living
wage?"
So read the subject line of an email
circulated by the Stanford Labor Ac
tion Coalition (SLAC) drumming up
support for yesterday's protest, held at
noon in White Plaza. A dozen students
showed up for the demonstration,
which called on University President
John Hennessy to increase the living
wage for Stanford's workers.
SLAC members, who lobbied the
University on the behalf Stanford Hos

pital workers last fall during contract
negotiations, now say their primary tar
get is Stanford's living wage for work
ers, currently set at $11.35 per hour.
"We're kicking off our living wage
campaign aiming to pressure the Univer
sity to make its living wage policy con
cretc," said senior Christopher Vaughan.
SLAC maintains that Stanford's liv
ing wage is insufficient when compared
to the cost of living in Palo Alto and the
surrounding region. The California
Budget Project, "a nonpartisan, non
profit organization seeking fiscal re
forms to benefit low and moderate in
come Californians," according to its

Web site, estimates that a single adult
living in Santa Clara needs an hourly
wage of $13.41 to survive.
"$11.36 isn't really a living wage for
the Bay Area, where the cost of living is
much more," said Alexandra Goldman,
a junior. "We're hoping to see a wage
that's more appropriate."
Passing out fliers, chanting with bull
horns and animating a giant puppet,
members of SLAC circulated their
message around a White Plaza abuzz in
the noontime sun. Organizers said the
protest was a simple beginning in a con

certed effort to raise awareness about a
living wage on campus.
"We're planning on doing a lot of out
reach, letting people know that this going
on," Goldman said, adding that she ex
pected events to grow in size and stature
as the campaign continues."We're escalat
ing what we're going to do."
With a demonstrated passion for
worker's rights, Goldman hinted that any
thing less than a raise in the living wage
would be considered a failure by SLAC.
"Ultimately our goal is to get this living
wage actually implemented," she said.
"We're going to do what we have to do."
While Tuesday's demonstration tar
geted student awareness, members of
SLAC say that the campaign's list of po
tential marks begins and ends with Hen
nessy.
"We're operating under the assump
tion that Hennessy has the ultimate de

cision," Goldman said.
The most recent living wage guide
lines, released in 2003, called for compa
nies contracted by the University to pay
employees a minimum of $10.10 per
hour with health benefits, or $11.35 per
hour if health benefits are not provided.
"Stanford University recognizes the
importance of paying a living-wage to all
service workers at Stanford, whether they
are directly employed by Stanford or by
contractors," the guidelines read. "Stan
ford already pays a living wage to its em
ployees and now adopts this living-wage "
SLAC members complain that the
guidelines are overly restrictive and fail
to sufficiently encompass the campus
worker population. They also accuse
Hennessy of playing lip service to wage
reform and engaging in a "closed-door"
process, while failing to make any real
progress or openly engage in discussion
with the student body.
"Hennessy did call it a moral imper
ative [when he created the living wage
in 2003]," said SLAC member Joseles
De La Cruz, a senior. "But what he cre
ated was not a living wage."
