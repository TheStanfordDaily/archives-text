## Johnson opens up 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
The Daily sat down with men's
basketball coach Trent Johnson for
more than an hour last Thursday.
With nearly six months until next
season tips off. Coach Johnson
seemed a lot more relaxed — and
candid — than during the regular
season, and gave us so much materi
al that we can't fit it all in one article.
Here's part one, and be sure to
check out part two on Friday.
On his demeanor during the season
versus the off-season:

Trent Johnson: I've got to get better
in terms of being aMe to let a bad
play go. Win or lose, I'm so anal and
I'm so driven that when we don't
play well, regardless of [the out
come], it bothers me and it's hard
for me to let it go. I have to go back
right after games and watch tapes to
get ready for the next day. And I
don't think a lot of people realize
that.
My wife's always said this, and it's
funny: 'The only good thing about
losing for you is that nobody talks to
you and vou sort of like that.'
