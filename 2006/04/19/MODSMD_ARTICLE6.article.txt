# MEN'S BASKETBALL
## Johnson opens up 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
The Daily sat down with men's
basketball coach Trent Johnson for
more than an hour last Thursday.
With nearly six months until next
season tips off. Coach Johnson
seemed a lot more relaxed — and
candid — than during the regular
season, and gave us so much materi
al that we can't fit it all in one article.
Here's part one, and be sure to
check out part two on Friday.
On his demeanor during the season
versus the off-season:

Trent Johnson: I've got to get better
in terms of being aMe to let a bad
play go. Win or lose, I'm so anal and
I'm so driven that when we don't
play well, regardless of [the out
come], it bothers me and it's hard
for me to let it go. I have to go back
right after games and watch tapes to
get ready for the next day. And I
don't think a lot of people realize
that.
My wife's always said this, and it's
funny: 'The only good thing about
losing for you is that nobody talks to
you and vou sort of like that.'

Trent Johnson, head coach of the men's basketball team, was relaxed and
candid when he spoke with The Daily recently. He talked about his competi
tive nature, the injuries that have plagued players and the future of the team.

And I said, 'What about win
ning?'
'You don't really like that because
you don't like people telling you
good job.'
'Where's a happy medium?'
'I don't know if you've ever found
that.'
That's being competitive. And
that is the only good thing about los
ing.
The Stanford Daily: You've talked
about, [entering] last year, you felt
the expectations were too high.
You've had a couple of weeks to look
back on the season. Do you feel that
you overachieved, underachieved or
performed about as well as you
could?
TJ: I think, considering the key in
juries we had at key times, we proba
bly did as good as we expected. It was
disappointing for us, and while I'm
not making excuses — we don't
make excuses — the bottom line is
[UC-Irvine] beat us at home. But if
we had Matt Haryasz, who knows?
But still, we were playing really
good basketball, and then Matt's eye
gets injured, so, I mean, 16-14 overall
is what it is. It's not very good. But in
our conference, we went 11 -7.
We probably did as good as we

could. I know we didn't overachieve,
but I don't want to say we under
achieved because injuries were a
part of it.
TSD:You joined a team that went 30-
2 [in 2003-04], the year before you
joined. As a new coach, was it hard to
bust guys on a team that had done so
well? Did you feel like you had to go
a little bit easier and not get in the
face of Dan, Matt and Chris, and how
did that affect these past two sea
sons?
TJ: I think it's a learning situation.
I'm not going to know Danny Grun
feld in a week like he will. Respect
and trust is something that's learned
over time.
Contrary to what people believe,
I'm not a demonstrative, screaming,
attacking, in-your-face kind of guy.
But there are times when you have to
push the right button to motivate
guys, and I've always said that our re
sponsibility as coaches is to push
people out of their comfort zones so
they compete at a high level. But it's
very gradual.
I think the bottom line here is that
guys were used to a certain way, and
there was an adjustment period. In
terms of what we did on the floor, the
system was a little different at the of

fensive end because I gave them
more freedom to play a little looser.
Defensively, it's pretty much the
same.
TSD:Do you feel it's going to be a lit
tle easier this upcoming year in that
you've had a couple of years, and
these players now are all people
you've recruited and are more famil
iar with?
TJ:Well 1 do think it would be a lot
easier if the opponents would coop
erate. [Laughs.] The only thing that's
been hard, Daniel, is adjusting to the
injuries. Since I've been a head
coach, I've never been with a team
that has had as many injuries in two
years as this one. And I think that's
attributable to that we're not as deep
as we have been.
You know there's a saying that the
first year's a honeymoon, the second
year's your hardest and the third year
should be smoother. 1 don't know if 1
agree with that. I just know we'll be
younger and we'll be talented.
Being here three years is no dif
ferent than being here for two years
or one year, because I've been at
Stanford before. So I think the
biggest adjustment for me, and for
them, has been the injuries — pure,
plain and simple.
