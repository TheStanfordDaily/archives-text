## Online high school will open this fall 
### ANNY LIN STAFF WRITER 
For many, high school evokes memories of
classrooms,crowded hallways and lunch periods.
However, the Stanford Education Program for
Gifted Youth (EPC *Y) is planning to offer a dif
ferent kind of high school experience to students
around the world.
For the academic year 2(X)6-2(X)7. EPGY is
launching an online high school for gifted stu
dents. The program is directed by Patrick Suppes,
the Lucie Stern professor of philosophy emeri
tus. While there are many online high school of
ferings, such as those offered by the University of
Texas-Austin and the University of Miami,
EPGY is the first to target gifted high schoolers.
"The focus is to get a richer and deeper edu
cation," Suppes said. "We're only interested in a
rigorous academic high school experience."
EPGY, which was founded in 1992, currently
enrolls about 4,(XH) students of all ages and in
many different disciplines. Students from ele
mentary school through high school participate
in various mathematics, English, humanities,
physics, computer science and music courses.
There is a particular focus on math. English and
physics — areas traditionally targeted for gifted
education.
To ensure that the academic experience pro
vided by the school is well-rounded, and to fulfill
the basic requirements needed to be certified as
a high school, EPGY is currently expanding its
offerings in the social sciences. EPGY is also of
fering a course in AP Music Theory, a course not
commonly found at traditional high schools na
tionwide. According to Suppes. if there is a
greater demand for courses in history, economics
and music, the program will consider expansion
in the future.
EPGY would like to remain a fairly small or
ganization. Suppes said he hopes that enroll-
ment for this year will range from 50-
1(H) students. While the school's for
mal admissions forms are still being
revised, Suppes explained that ad
missions decisions will be made
based on a number of factors, such as
PSA I' scores and a record of strong
academics.
"There is no algorithm," he said.

"Rather, students will be judged
based on a portfolio of what they've
done, whey they offer and their po
tential for the futurp
He anticipates that the high school
will enroll students from all over the
United States who desire a more
challenging experience, students of
American families who are working
abroad as well as a number of stu
dents who are home-schooled.
The online high school is made
possible by a gift from the Malone
Family Foundation which has also
funded previous endeavors at EPG Y.

According to Ray Ravaglia, deputy
director of EPGY, these funds are
marked primarily to get the school up
and running. While EPGY offers lim
ited financial aid, administrators
hope to raise more funds so they can
reach out to a broader range of stu
dents who could benefit from a gifted
education.
"We still will be actively seeking
money to give for financial aid,"
Ravaglia said. "There are plenty of
qualified students that come from dis
advantaged backgrounds, and we'd
like to give them this opportunity."
