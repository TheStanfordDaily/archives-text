## Part III in a three-part series: Examining Immigrant Health TO CARE OR 
### Written By MEGAN WATKINS, RUTH STEFANOS DESI SMALL-RODRIGUEZ 
Recording to a report by the Children's Defense Fund
more than 40 percent of immigrant children lack

■ I health insurance. And by one account from the
Center for Immigration Studies, almost half of all Mexican
immigrants and one quarter of all non-Mexican immigrants
live in the state of California, making it the state with the
largest immigrant population. With such a large percentage
of the population being immigrants, and many of them
poor, it is no wonder that there are many debates over pro
grams aiming to provide government-funded care.
In 1994, California voters passed Proposition 187, deny
ing illegal immigrants access to many government services,
including public education and publicly funded health care.
While the drive for Prop. 187 was partially motivated by the

attitude that since illegal immigrants weren't
paying taxes, they shouldn't be consuming

public services, many focused on the fact
that immigrants were here illegally. .
Former House member Randall Cun- j
ningham (R-Calif.), now serving eight j
years in prison for accepting bribes, com- I
mented to PBS at the time, "We ought to ;
stop 'em at the border, and if they're ille- J
gal in this country, the only thing they de
serve is a ticket out of here."
The issue, however, was rendered
moot in 1998 when a federal court struck j
down Prop. 187 on the grounds that de
termining immigration policy was a fed- I

eral and not a state issue. Since then, the
center ground has shifted in the other direc-

tion, with most state politicians disavowing and distancing i
themselves from the initiative, and many embracing a gov- j
ernmental role in providing health care for immigrants.
In 1997, the federal government created the State Child
Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), also called Healthy
Families in California, which provides basic health insur- ;
ance for children ineligible for Medicaid. Medicaid covers
individuals with incomes up to 100 percent of the Federal
Poverty Level. Families who make between 100 percent
and 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level can enroll
their children in SCHIP. However, in order to be consid- I
ered eligible for SCHIP in much of the United States, immi
grant children must be citizens or have proper documenta
tion.

Additionally, under current legislation, even legal immigrants
are ineligible for Medicaid and SCHIP programs during their first five
years in the United States.

Michael Koch, founder and executive director of California Kids Healthcare
Foundation, a non-profit providing access to healthcare services for many of Cali
fornia's undocumented children, expresses concern about the number of immigrant
children that go uncovered.
"T\vo to three hundred thousand children in California are not eligible for Medic-

aid or the Healthy Families Program because of their
immigration status," he said.

Koch also notes that providing

coverage is often less expensive
than leaving families to seek emer
gency care when health situations

turn dire.
"We at California Kids feel it is a right

not a privilege for kids to have access to preventative
i and primary healthcare, and that it is poor public policy
for kids to be seen in the ER when they could be seen by
primary care providers at a fraction of the cost,"he said.
While many families that cannot afford coverage only

seek emergency care, others turn to free clinics like Pacific
Free Clinic and Arbor Free Clinic in the Stanford area. Both
clinics are funded by the University, providing no-cost medical
care to the lower class, including a number of immigrants.

Lily Kao, a clinic manager at Pacific Free Clinic and a
i Stanford medical student, says that despite the need for pediatric
i services among the large portion of their patients that are immi
grants, Pacific Free Clinic is not able to provide services to child im
migrants. However, they have efforts in progress that will provide

options for pediatric care.
"Pacific Free Clinic does not see pediatric patients due to the limi
tations of our services and staffing. We currently do not have a formal
referral system for pediatric patients. However, in the next two weeks
Overfelt Clinic in San Jose will start recruiting pediatric patients direct
ly from PFC during clinic hours," said Kao in a March interview.
Many California counties, including Santa Clara County, are using
public funds to implement their own form of health insurance for undoc
umented children called Healthy Kids. California Kids and others use
their non-profit funding to cover children in counties where Healthy Kids
is not in place.

A new hill proposed in both houses of Congress, the Immigrant
F Children's Health Improvement Act. would eliminate the five-year period
when legal immigrants are not allowed to receive aid. The bill was intro
duced in both the House and the Senate last spring, but only a handful of rep
resentatives and senators support it. Neither Congresswoman Anna Eshoo (D-

Palo Alto), nor either California senator are cosponsors on this bill.
Junior Veronica Ramirez, a human biology major and member of the Latino com-

munity on campus, believes that "although [SCHIP] has brought forth some improve
ment since its establishment, there is still a large population of uninsured children that
will most likely continue to increase."
Some point to this as an example of the tail wagging the dog, saying that increasing
public services for illegal immigrants will only encourage more to come. Groups like
Californians for Population Stability (CAPS) argue that "the primary cause of over-

crowded schools and health care costs is too many people overtaking our
finite resources, [something which] immigration policy doesn't take

into account," according to a statement on CAPS's website.
Others discount these arguments and point to the importance of help
|; ing the poor get access to health care. Koch, for his part, says that while
the efforts of his organization are important, they aren't a permanent
fix.
"Philanthropic support is great for models and bridges, but it is not
the answer to financing healthcare for children," he said.

"Pacific Free Clinic does not see pediatric patients due to the limi
tations of our services and staffing. We currently do not have a formal
referral system for pediatric patients. However, in the next two weeks
Overfelt Clinic in San Jose will start recruiting pediatric patients direct
ly from PFC during clinic hours," said Kao in a March interview.
Many California counties, including Santa Clara County, are using
public funds to implement their own form of health insurance for undoc
umented children called Healthy Kids. California Kids and others use
their non-profit funding to cover children in counties where Healthy Kids
is not in place.

A new hill proposed in both houses of Congress, the Immigrant
F Children's Health Improvement Act. would eliminate the five-year period
when legal immigrants are not allowed to receive aid. The bill was intro
duced in both the House and the Senate last spring, but only a handful of rep
resentatives and senators support it. Neither Congresswoman Anna Eshoo (D-

Palo Alto), nor either California senator are cosponsors on this bill.
Junior Veronica Ramirez, a human biology major and member of the Latino com-

munity on campus, believes that "although [SCHIP] has brought forth some improve
ment since its establishment, there is still a large population of uninsured children that
will most likely continue to increase."
Some point to this as an example of the tail wagging the dog, saying that increasing
public services for illegal immigrants will only encourage more to come. Groups like
Californians for Population Stability (CAPS) argue that "the primary cause of over-

crowded schools and health care costs is too many people overtaking our
finite resources, [something which] immigration policy doesn't take

into account," according to a statement on CAPS's website.
Others discount these arguments and point to the importance of help
|; ing the poor get access to health care. Koch, for his part, says that while
the efforts of his organization are important, they aren't a permanent
fix.
"Philanthropic support is great for models and bridges, but it is not
the answer to financing healthcare for children," he said.
