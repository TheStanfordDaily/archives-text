# The

## The
						new trend: Death by multitasking 
### 
After a section during fall quarter, six fellow stu
dents and 1 piled out of the classroom and got
into the elevator. As we descended three floors,
we realized that six of the seven of us already had our
earbuds in. listening to music, despite section having
ended mere seconds earlier. The seventh guy, glancing
around the elevator, chuckled and rolled his eyes.
On any given day, anywhere on campus, I bear wit
ness to similar bizarre behaviors. Walking along Escon
dido Road, I pass students biking with a beverage in one
hand and a cell phone in the other. At the gym, I see
them on the elliptical: running, listening to music and
reading all at once. When I study at the library,countless
fellow scholars are simultaneously chatting on IM,send
ing text messages, listening to music, chatting with
friends across the table, surfing the web, updating their
Facebook profiles, eating a snack and drinking coffee or
soda,and,presumably, working. In class,l've read entire
New York Times stories off the laptop screen of the stu
dent in front of me — as well as their IM conversations
and email correspondence. And I'll even admit up front
I've been guilty of nearly all of these egregious offen
sives — except that I don't bike.
We're supposedly "Generation Y", but I'm begin
ning to think we should be labeled "Generation M" —
"M" for multitaskers.
And indeed, some commentators on our "21 st centu
ry" habits have labeled us just that. As members of Gen
eration M, we're wired (or wireless?), plugged in and
ready to conquer multiple forms of media at once.
Time magazine had a cover-story last month on the
"Multitasking Generation," kids like us — and much
younger — who can't seem to concentrate on doing just
one thing at a time.Tlirns out, multitasking is something
of a myth, neurologically. According to several scientists
Time quoted, when we think we're multitasking, we're
simply rapidly toggling between tasks.
Which means that while we may think we're being ef
ficient, in most instances we're actually slowing our
selves down. This is pretty intuitive. When I need to con
centrate on a paper, I get off IM. When I'm making a se
rious phone call, I turn off the music. I can't count the
number of times I've started reading something while
watching TV and suddenly looked up five minutes later,
realizing I have no idea what's happening.
And maybe we're missing something by always
doing six things at once: fully appreciating one activity
at a time. This point was brought home to me recently
when I was diagnosed with mononucleosis. Lacking the
concentration or energy to wildly multitask, I was
forced to just read a book, or just listen to music.
Surprisingly, I enjoyed being fully focused on one ac
tivity at a time. Kevin Phillips' American Theocracy
seemed clearer and easier to understand. Fall Out Boy
and Chopin alike seemed more nuanced and subtle. For
once, I actually knew what was happening on West Wing!
Last spring quarter, I had left a final term paper to be
entirely completed in the 24-hour period before it was
due. I went to the library and — rather than drag out my
varied forms of technological paraphernalia — sat
down at one of those dusty old library computers. I had
no music. I had no IM. I had no email. Just me and this
clunky old computer.
And lo and behold, eight hours later, I had written
my 4,500-word term paper. I marveled at how much
longer it would have taken me to do this if I had been
distracted by IM, email, Facebook, NYTimes.com,
ESPN.com. Economist.com, friends, phone calls, rear
ranging my iTlmes playlists — all frequent enablers of
my procrastination.
Maybe we should all slow down, take a deep breath,
and engage ourselves more fully in one activity at a time.
The quality of everything we do is diminished as we pile
more and more on at the same time.
That seventh kid in the elevator? He was plugged
into something even better than his iPod: real life.
