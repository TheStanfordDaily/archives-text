# PALESTINIAN AWARENESS MONTH
## THE
						NAKBA Organizers bring Palestinian reformer; others to campus 
### MIMA MOHAMMED DESK EDITOR 
This month the Coalition for Justice in the Mid
dle East (CJME) will be putting on a series called
Palestine Awareness Month, cosponsored by the
Muslim Student Awareness Network and the Orga
nization of Arab Students in Stanford. The organi
zation's aim is to raise awareness on campus about
the situation in the Middle East. In the past, CJME
has been involved in organizing human-rights-re
lated events, often focusing on the situation in Israel
and Palestine.
Over the next two weeks, there will be a variety
of programs promoting information about Pales
tine. The hallmark event, sponsored by the ASSU
Speakers' Bureau, features Mustafa Bargouti, a
Palestinian presidential candidate in the 2005 elec
tions.
Barghouti is a prominent Palestinian democrat
ic activist and finished second in the 2005 Palestin
ian presidential elections, receiving approximately
20 percent of the vote. He will speak about the
Palestinian democratic process and his experiences
fighting corruption.
Though under partial occupation, Palestinian
society is one of the more democratic Arab soci
eties today. Still, controversy has arisen from
Hamas — considered a terrorist organization by
the State Department — winning the majority of
parliamentary seats elections. Barghouti will ad
dress the emerging challenges in the Palestinian
governing authority.
A medical doctor by training, Barghouti is one
of the founders of the Palestinian National Initia
tive — a reformist, democratic alternative to
Hamas and deceased Palestinian Authority leader
Yasser Arafat's party Fatah. In 1979, Barghouti

founded the Union of Palestinian Medical Relief Committees, a non-gov
ernmental organization (NGO) that provides health care and other relat
ed services in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Barghouti was recently
elected to the Palestinian parliament as the head of the Independent

Palestine list, a coalition of independents and
NGO members.
'it is not uncommon for other campuses in the
U.S. to have an event or series of events about the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict, due in part to the
American media's inadequate coverage of this
conflict," says junior Tala Al-Ramahi, who helped
organize the event. "American journalists consis
tently fail to consider the history of the conflict and
hardly ever shed light on the basic human rights
that the Palestinians deserve but are often denied.
Our goal is to educate the Stanford community
about the injustices that occur under the Israeli oc
cupations in Gaza and the West Bank."
On May 9, the campus will commemorate
Nakba Day. "Nakba" means "catastrophe" in Ara
bic. Throughout the Arab world, the word is used
to refer to the dispossession of the Palestinian peo
ple resulting from civil war before the establish
ment of the state of Israel on May 14.1 948 and the
ensuring war afterwards when surrounding Arab
states invaded.The reasons for the initial (before
May 1948) expulsions is unclear, with explanations
ranging from claims that Arab leaders called on
Palestinians to flee, to that deliberate Zionist tac
tics caused the flight, to a disintegrating Palestin
ian social structure that prompted flight to nearby
shelters. However, it seems fairly certain that much
of the second stage (after May 1948) was caused by
Israeli military forces bent on driving the Palestin
ian population out of the area.
The Nakba is also the source of the still-unre
solved Palestinian refugee problem. Today, over 4
million Palestinian refugees are scattered
throughout the world. Many live in Jordan,
Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
in poverty-stricken refugee camps.
Al-Ramahi points to United Nations Resolution
194. passed on December 11, 1948. Paragraph 11
states: "...the refugees wishing to return to their
homes and live at peace with their neighbors
should be permitted to do so at the earliest practi
cable date... compensation should be paid for the
property of those choosing not to return."
This issue is highly controversial. Manv Jews, in

Israel and elsewhere, argue that granting the right to return would be tanta
mount to declaring the destruction of Israel as a Jewish state.
