# The 						word from Washington: Stopping terrorists at the border
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C. — While sena
tors beat their chests and blow hot
air over reforms for illegal immi
grants, the agency that is responsible for ad
ministering U.S. immigration policy sits in
such a state of crisis that it puts the security of
the entire nation at risk.
In their congressional testimony,experts and
whistle-blowers exposed egregious mismanage
ment and systemic institutional flaws at the U. S.
Citizenship and Immigration Services which
continue to allow terrorists and foreign intelli
gence agencies to infiltrate the agency and
fraudulently gain entry into the United States.
They say D.C. makes you cynical. Now 1
understand why. The details I heard at the
April 6 House Foreign Relations Subcommit
tee hearing on Terrorism and Non-Prolifera
tion would shock and dismay even the most
optimistic believers in government.
The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Ser
vices or USCIS — formerly the National Im
migration Service or NlS,is the agency respon
sible for authorizing asylum and providing
visas and naturalization documents. They are
also the first line of defense to ensuring that
terrorists do not gain entry into the United

States. Before the first witnesses even spoke,
Chairman Edward Royce (R-Calif.) rattled off
a dearth of problems. USCIS employees have
not had the background checks required to ac
cess federal security databases and as a result
these employees are unable to check immi
grant applications against national terrorist
lists. Royce said that adjudicators are blindly
approving applicants. He cited a March Gov
ernment Accountability Office report stating
that USCIS is extremely backlogged and
under-resourced. Ultimately, according to
Royce, USCIS was "rigged" to approve immi
gration benefits without concern for security.
Ranking Democrat Brad Sherman (D-
Calif.) chimed in. Pointing to the fact that 40
percent of adjudicators at the agency lack ac

cess to criminal or national security databas
es, Sherman said, "We haven't even checked
the checkers."
At most House committee hearings it is
rare to find all members in attendance. This
committee hearing, however was jam-packed
and even included a guest. John Culberson
(R-Tex.), a fiery fast-talking representative
from Houston, sat in on the committee, de
claring that the border situation is so bad back
in his home state that "Osama's cousin could
walk right in" (one of his nieces did pose for
GQ a few months ago). But even Culberson's
harsh words did not seem to prepare the com
mittee for the shock they received from the
testimony to follow.
Former 9/11 Commission researcher Jan
ice Kephart was the first witness, emphasizing
the importance of USCIS for stopping terror
ists. Six of the September 11 hijackers, she
said, were found to have used immigration
fraud to aid in their terrorist activities. Exam
ples included sham marriages.student visas is
sued to non-students or fraudulent requests
for asylum later allowing them to obtain legal
documents within the United States.This was
n't illegal immigration in the usual sense/This

was legal, but fraudulent immigration.
But it was the testimony of Michael J.
Maxwell that caused the most stir. Maxwell
was a whistle-blower and former director of
the Office of Security and Investigations at
USCIS. An experienced law enforcement ex
pert, he spoke softly and gravely in measured
tones about the harsh realities of USCIS. I Ic
described how his office was undermined by a
culture that placed service and the elimina
tion of a backlog above security.
"The integrity of USCIS is corrupted,"
Maxwell said. "And at a minimum, USCIS
and Department of Homeland Security offi
cials have turned a blind eye."
USCIS offered incentives including time
off. movie tickets and cash bonuses to adjudi
cators with the fastest processing times.
"Promotions are based on the number of
affirmative adjudications," Maxwell said.
The agency considered itself a "service"
agency, not an enforcement agency.
Maxwell described how USCIS cut his in
vestigative staff levels until he had only six
specialists to conduct a backlog of 11 .(MX)
USCIS employee background checks. Fur
thermore, he said, he was authorized no more

than six staffers to investigate more than S(K)
allegations of fraud or wrongdoing — some
involving espionage or terrorism.
"The system that exists now cannot handle
the load that exists now," Maxwell said.
He claims his concerns went unheeded "all
the way up the chain of command." He alleges
that the director of USCIS acknowledged
that two foreign intelligence operatives were
working from within the agency to help illegal
aliens enter the country.
Throughout Maxwell's testimony represen
tatives expressed alarm, making multiple dis
tressed comments. One congressman literally
hit his hand to his head repeatedly. Ouch. Chair
man Royce asked if a recently announced pres
idential fraud task force would help alleviate the
problem. Maxwell replied in the negative.
"The system needs to he re-engineered
from the ground up," he said.
Before Congress tackles the problem of ille
gal immigrants in this country, first it needs to fix
the broken agency that handles the legal ones.
