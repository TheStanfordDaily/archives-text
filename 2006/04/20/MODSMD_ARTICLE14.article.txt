## Editorial ProFros: Don't say we didn't warn you 
### 
To the newly-admitted; To the Class of
2010 to-be; To the freshly-minted and
the impressionable and the optimistic;
lb the 2400's and the 4.0 unweighteds;To the
rising high school sophomores turned ad
mits — and to their parents — who posted
on College Confidential; To those armed
with red packets, wandering aimless through
the Quad.
To all of you. welcome to thee Farm!
At this point, there should be no question
whether we want you. In fact,"we" want you
very much. If that is not obvious now, it shall
soon become abundantly clear. Admit
Weekend is an orgy (though not in the tradi
tional Synergy sense, ask someone what that
means) of self-congratulation and boosted
confidence.
Acronyms will be sprinkled liberally —
RoIIo and Hollo and Pro Fro and
MemAud — these acronyms will all sound
vaguely sexual, but let us assure you — they
are not.
You will hear much of one of Stanford's
favorite acronyms this weekend. FMOTQ,
or Full Moon on the Quad, is made out to be
such an exclusive secret that your friendly
RoHos and MoHos — who are so forthcom
ing on issues like AP transfers and meal
plans — clam up when the spectacle is so
much as mentioned, muttering cryptically,
evasively,"Oh,you'll see."
All this mystery and innuendo will likely
create a semi-mystical aura around the
event, such that the question, "What hap
pens at FMOTQ?" will only be met by the
response. "What doesn't?" Let us level with
you: If this is your expectation,you will be se
riously disappointed.
What was once a celebration of lip
locked public nudity has become a total
sketchfcst. drawing more grad students than
streakers. Meanwhile, little Dixie-cup shots
of Listerine are thrust upon you by PHEs —
yet another, less-titillating acronym — in a
war of attrition against mononucleosis that
you will almost certainly lose. Fortunately,
Listerine is slightly alcoholic, so perhaps if
enough is imbibed, the whole ordeal may be

less awkward.
The same can be said of Exotic Erotic, an
other well-guarded Stanford secret where
people reveal a side of themselves you'd
rather not see.
This Admit Weekend, take the time to
manage your expectations and consider
which promises Stanford will actually
keep.
For example, advising tends to get over
sold at Admit Weekend, when in reality,
most students are extremely dissatisfied
with advising services on campus. Many aca
demic advisers are not adequately prepared
to tell freshmen what to do. So explore all
you want, but you'll be happier if you pick
out a major and commit to it right away. If
you know you want to be a lawyer, a doctor
or an engineer, it's up to you to focus all your
time and energy on choosing the best class
es, meeting the best professors and studying
for the right exams.
Don't get intimidated by the over
achievers chosen to represent the Stanford
population during the panels you attend.
Not everyone is curing cancer or seeking
solutions to the humanitarian crisis in
Africa.
Don't get caught up by the images of per
petual happiness at Stanford. Everyone ex
periences the highs and lows of life, and al
most everyone gets stressed when midterms
and finals roll around.
On the plus side, Stanford's Overseas
Studies Program is all it's cracked up to be
— even if not everyone who applies gets
their first choice of where or when they go
abroad. Also, there is a diverse wealth of or
ganizations to join and extracurricular activ
ities to explore.
On the down side, we've completely for
gotten what it feels like to win Big Game.
So welcome to Stanford. Welcome to
four years of California sunshine and unin
tentional celibacy. Welcome to at least the
promise of Exotic Erotic and Secret
Snowflake and fountain hopping and
naked hashing. But don't say we didn't
warn you.
