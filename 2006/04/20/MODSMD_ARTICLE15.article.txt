## Easter celebrations 
### 
Midnight on Easter Sunday the lights
are shut off in my church — as they
are in all Eastern Orthodox churches
and the congregation is plunged into a rev
erent darkness.The priest steps forward hold
ing a lit trio of candles and touches it to one
parishioner's unlit candle. He, in turn, lights
the candle of the person next to him and the
light is passed throughout the church, until
everyone has been touched by the Resurrec
tion. My mother, who refused to let me or my
sister cut our hair until we were in middle
school, kept an eye out to make sure we did
n't set ourselves alight as well.
Growing up. when 1 still accepted my faith
without question. I was always awed by the
hush that would fall over the church — the
sense that we were all witnessing something
miraculous together. It remains the one mo
ment of the year that I believe in God.
Though the answer is always no, every
year my grandmother still asks me if I'm com
ing home for Easter. This year was no excep
tion. Freshman year she sent me a flask of
Holy Water and told me to bless my dorm; I
felt too guilty to throw it away and too embar
rassed to use it — I hid it, like R. Kelly, in the

back of my closet.
Whether I'm there or not. Grandma boils
eggs and dyes them red. Easter Sunday, each
member of my family picks one that looks
lucky. We turn to each other, announce
"Christ is Risen" in Greek and smash one egg
on top of the other — the Greek version of
WWE Smackdown. Whoever goes the
longest without their egg looking like a bat
tered windshield wins. (Though no one really
wins in my family due to rampant cheating.)
At Stanford, 1 found new traditions. The
vibrant Greek grad student community or
ganizes Easter events — including a big pic
nic held just outside Blackwelder, featuring
the roasting of a whole lamb on a spit.
Since Eastern Orthodox Christians follow
a different calendar than the rest of Christian
ity, Greek Easter is usually celebrated after
regular Easter, when all the candy and decora
tions go on sale. This year and last, I've been
the only one around me observing the holiday
— I've missed out on Greek traditions both
new and old. in favor of other activities
Last year. Greek Easter fell on May Day.
