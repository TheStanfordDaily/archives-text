# A 						Modern Fairy Tale
## Easter celebrations 
### 
Midnight on Easter Sunday the lights
are shut off in my church — as they
are in all Eastern Orthodox churches
and the congregation is plunged into a rev
erent darkness.The priest steps forward hold
ing a lit trio of candles and touches it to one
parishioner's unlit candle. He, in turn, lights
the candle of the person next to him and the
light is passed throughout the church, until
everyone has been touched by the Resurrec
tion. My mother, who refused to let me or my
sister cut our hair until we were in middle
school, kept an eye out to make sure we did
n't set ourselves alight as well.
Growing up. when 1 still accepted my faith
without question. I was always awed by the
hush that would fall over the church — the
sense that we were all witnessing something
miraculous together. It remains the one mo
ment of the year that I believe in God.
Though the answer is always no, every
year my grandmother still asks me if I'm com
ing home for Easter. This year was no excep
tion. Freshman year she sent me a flask of
Holy Water and told me to bless my dorm; I
felt too guilty to throw it away and too embar
rassed to use it — I hid it, like R. Kelly, in the

back of my closet.
Whether I'm there or not. Grandma boils
eggs and dyes them red. Easter Sunday, each
member of my family picks one that looks
lucky. We turn to each other, announce
"Christ is Risen" in Greek and smash one egg
on top of the other — the Greek version of
WWE Smackdown. Whoever goes the
longest without their egg looking like a bat
tered windshield wins. (Though no one really
wins in my family due to rampant cheating.)
At Stanford, 1 found new traditions. The
vibrant Greek grad student community or
ganizes Easter events — including a big pic
nic held just outside Blackwelder, featuring
the roasting of a whole lamb on a spit.
Since Eastern Orthodox Christians follow
a different calendar than the rest of Christian
ity, Greek Easter is usually celebrated after
regular Easter, when all the candy and decora
tions go on sale. This year and last, I've been
the only one around me observing the holiday
— I've missed out on Greek traditions both
new and old. in favor of other activities
Last year. Greek Easter fell on May Day.
Instead of going to church, 1 followed
Oxford tradition and stayed up all
night Saturday, heard the singing
from the top of Magdalen College's
clocktower at dawn and fell asleep at
7 a.m. against a wall in the Stanford
House kitchen as a few generous
souls cooked breakfast for all of us.
Directions to Oxford's Greek Ortho
dox Church remained buried in my
bag, unused.
This year, 1 celebrated Easter this
past Sunday with my host family. 1 ex
pected a crazy African Easter experi
ence — my host family believes in os
tentatious displays of Christianity
enough to have a rug in the bathroom
featuring Leonardo da Vinci's "The
Last Supper." But the congregation,
who had attended church night after
night for the entire week, was too
burned out by Sunday to hold any
thing more than a "normal" service.
No candles, no egg hunts, no bunnies
and no toilets (vandals had stolen
them and basically everything else
the church had in it).
When my host mother and 1
showed up, the congregation was sev

eral blocks away, singing and march
ing into church. Some used sticks to
bang on what looked like thick metal
cups and plates with handles, while
others beat small leather pads to
make loud clapping sounds.
My host mother abandoned me for
her friends and I was passed around
among women in church uniform — a
black skirt, a thick white blouse with a
scalloped black and white collar and a
crown-esque white hat — until a place
was found for me next to a woman
who slapped me on the back, hard,
when 1 addressed her in Xhosa — not
an uncommon reaction.
It was the most enthusiastic reli
gious ceremony I have ever attended.
The whole congregation — my
self included — stood and sang loud
ly, the choir dancing and singing,
heading toward the door, men in
church uniform — suits and carved
walking sticks — smiling and herding
them back to their pews toward the
end of each song.
In contrast to the focus on solemn,
internal prayer in Greek Orthodoxy,
several women stood up and prayed
vigorously, shouting, as if in pain, to
Jesus.
The preacher was wildly animat
ed. The pulpit could barely hold him
for all his wild gesticulating. I caught
only random English phrases and

cliches he and others kept throwing
into their speeches before returning
to Xhosa: "There's nothing wrong
with buying convertibles," "It takes a
village to raise a child," "Behind every
successful man there is a woman,"
" Pregnancy should last 10 months." A
few times he directed the choir to get
through their "Amens" faster; they ig
nored him.
In the middle of the service, the
preacher singled me out, calling me
"Elise." He welcomed me to the
church and immediately afterwards
welcomed the entire congregation to
my house — in America.
"Now that we've invited her into
our homes, she said she will open her
home for all of us as well" he said,
stressing the first word of "as well" as
many here do.
The preacher and 1 had ex
changed no more than basic pleas
antries before the service, but 1
thought to myself, sure, why not? The
surprise on my mother's face on
opening the front door and finding a
town's worth of strangers would be
priceless.
