# Skunky Rummy

### 
As many of you may know. Professor of
Journalism William Woo died last
week in his home in Palo Alto. I
wanted to take a moment here to reflect on
my short but meaningful relationship with
him.
I contacted Professor Woo during the fall
this year when, after considering many dif
ferent careers, I thought journalism might
be interesting. It took the Professor less
than a day to get back to me, and I was in his
office the next morning. He was excited to
help me and even suggested I take an indi
vidual study with him in the winter to help
my writing.
We met almost every Monday during that
quarter to review my column before I sub
mitted it to The Daily. As the quarter went
on, our meetings were bittersweet for me be
cause while they were exciting and helpful, I
could see him physically deteriorating from
the increasingly intense chemo. Neverthe
less, Prof. Woo was always willing to meet
with me — he sent me an email just two
weeks before his death asking when was a
good time to meet this quarter. Prof. Woo's
commitment to students like me was unpar
alleled and should never be forgotten. I ded
icate this column to him:
Rummy should've known better than to
mess with five-star generals.
Last week, six retired generals called
for the termination of good 'ole boy Don
ald Rumsfeld. The officers claim that his
mismanagement of the war and manipula
tion of military personnel warrant his res

ignation.
At the end of last week, the White House
began damage control. Instead of stenciling
"scapegoat" on Rummy's forehead (think
Michael Brown with Katrina), Bush defend
ed him and the Pentagon sent a memo to the
generals detailing Rummy's achievements
and statistics.
Most recently, General Pete Pace ap
peared alongside Rummy at a press confer
ence and did his sworn duty: He sang the sec
retary of defense's praises.
"People can question my judgment or his
judgment," General Pace said. "But they
should never question the dedication, the pa
triotism and the work ethic of Secretary
Rumsfeld."
Believe me. General, we're not question
ing his patriotism; we're questioning whether
he was ever the right man for the job.
Even though recently-retired Generals
Richard B. Myers and Tommy Franks have
voiced their support for Rummy, let's not for
get that Rummy's relationship with these
men was never peachy. Franks and Myers
both publicly claimed that they didn't have
enough troops to fulfill their objectives.

Much like Bush's dismal approval rating
turned out to work against me on immigra
tion reform last week, my joy is again less
than full this week. While I'm glad these gen
erals are speaking up, I can't help but ask
what the hell took them so long?
Retired Lt. General Greg Newbald wrote
in Time magazine last week that Rummy
never fully understood the volatile situation
in Iraq and what it would take to succeed.
Rummy, whose pungent arrogance masks his
own incompetence, never took the time to re
ally listen to the generals and certainly never
realized that the mission was failing.
"My sincere view," Newbald notes,"is that
the commitment of our forces to this fight
was done with a casualness and swagger that
are the special province of those who have
never had to execute these missions — or
bury the results."
CODE: Rummy didn't know what he was
doing.
It's also not as if the war was succeeding,
well, ever. Generals have repeatedly criti
cized the insufficient number of troops that
have been deployed. Oh, and did we all for
get the time Rummy sent troops over with
out sufficient body armor and supplies?
As Tom White, the former Army secre
tary, told Michael Gordon and Bernard
Trainor in their new book on the Iraq war en
titled "Cobra II," Rummy never really nego
tiated with generals. In negotiations, after all,
both sides typically come to agree at a com
promise.

Straight from the ass's mouth
"Rumsfeld just grounds Franks
down," White said. "The nature of
Rumsfeld is that you just get tired of
arguing with him."
David Brooks noted in his New
York Times column last Sunday that
the problems with Rummy's mishan

dling of the war stem from his histo
ry of streamlining bureaucracies and
organizations. From the beginning of
his career. Rummy sought to change
the nature of wherever he worked.
In war, this nature turned into disas
ter.
"Rumsfeld the reformer never
adjusted to the circumstances of
wartime," Brooks writes. "Once the
initiator of new ideas, he now stran
gles ideas. Once the modernizer, he's
now the dinosaur. Amid the war on

terror, he has unleashed a reign of
terror on his subordinates."
By his very nature, Rummy was
n't cut out for this. The generals are
right — he should be fired. And I'm
actually surprised he hasn't been.
Then Bush could blame everything
on Rummy. Just as Katrina was all
Browny's fault, couldn't Iraq just be
Rummy's?
