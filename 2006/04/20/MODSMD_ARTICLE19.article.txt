## Response to the Board's editorial on SOCC 
### HAZELLA BOWMANI 
The following information on Stanford's un
dergraduate population comes from the
Stanford University Facts page for
prospective students:
African American: 701 (10 percent)
American Indian/Alaska Native: 147 (2 percent)
Asian American/Pacific Islander: 1.620 (24 per
cent)
White: 2,732 (41 percent)
International: 403 (6 percent)
Mexican American: 566 (8 percent)
Other I lispanic: 203 (3 percent)
Unidentified: 333 (5 percent)
Iliese numbers suggest that significantly less
than half of the student body is white — in other
words, students of color together make up the un
dergraduate majority. With that in mind, look at
the next sentence from The Daily's lament on
SOCC's effects on the democratic process of vot

ing (The SOCC: A blight on the democratic
process?" April 17):
"Of course, special interest groups will always
factor in the results of an election."
I'm black and female, but I know my num
bers well and I can see 47 is a larger number than
41 (47 excludes "international" and "unidenti
fied"). So when I see the entire Editorial Board
of The Daily agreeing with the statement that 47
percent of Stanford undergrads are "special in
terest," I ask myself, are they implicitly saying
that whiteness is the standard, and that every
thing but is "special" or a deviation of that stan
dard?
Yes. Yes they are.
I have learned that since the days of imperial
ism, people of European descent have classified
themselves as the measure of civilization, the
highest form of human existence — thanks to
my History, CAS A and CSRE courses. But I
thought that perhaps at Stanford, in this little
bubble of ours, I could pretend that the modern.
Western world doesn't continue to operate upon

this implicit, white-centric principle. After read
ing the editorial about SOCC, I realize that I was
a fool to think so. The cream of the crop — that
being smart Stanford kids — can only be as good
(or bad) as their society will permit, and this ed
itorial board has demonstrated it is no exception.
Many, not everyone, of the 47 percent of us take
the label of "special interest" and even "non
white," l< as a slap in our collective face. Figura
tively.
Many will turn and say,"But the ASSU is di
verse. So, it looks like we can be better than our
society." The response to this is yes and no. Yes,
because at last minority students are being rep
resented in seats of power in growing numbers.
But no, because for many — such as the mem
bers of The Daily Editorial Board and those
who agree with their expressed sentiments —
the idea of a growing majority-minority pres
ence is disquieting and threatening, and they
are lashing out.
If this editorial is any indication
of what the "average" Stanford stu
dent believes, we all need to work
harder to eradicate this subcon
scious, racist thinking. MSNBC has
an articulate article on the new phe
nomenon of the majority-minority:
http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9001
157/.
To continue with my analysis of
this editorial, I present two more ex
cerpts, (italics my own):
"The criteria for these endorse
ments were predictable: the candi
dates had to demonstrate or promise
support for diversity and ethnic
groups on campus and display a pas
sion for improving the life of Stan
ford 's ethnic minorities... SOCC only
endorsed minority candidates, and
not a single white student. It stretch
es this Board's capacity for reason
and belief that not even one non-mi
nority candidate for the Undergrad
uate Senate would have effectively
campaigned for diversity, or that not
a single non-minority candidate
could be considered a trusted friend
of these ethnic groups."
The information these Editorial
Board members have refused to pro
vide their readership with (or simply
did not bother to check) is that a can
didate must apply to become SOCC
endorsed. Ben Ilegbodu (Class of
'06), a fellow student of color ex
plained fellow student of color ex
plained. "It's not like they [SOCC]
look at the list of Senate candidates
and are like 'hmmm ... she looks
good ... oh yeah ... so does he.' And
correct me if I'm wrong, but there
were minority candidates who ap
plied for the endorsement and didn't
receive it. Furthermore, there were
minority candidates, Marcelo Wors
ley for one, who weren't SOCC en
dorsed and yet still won. The reason
no white candidates were SOCC en
dorsed wasn't because SOCC is
"racist," but because no white candi
dates applied for the endorsement. I
must repeat and emphasize this one
essential fact: No white candidates
applied for the endorsement. It
would seem that this group of board
members needs to exercise their "ca
pacity for reason and belief" to get it
into shape.
So here's a mental exercise. Ask
yourself (for the percentage of you
who are not white, pretend you are),
"Should I support ethnic/racial di
versity if it means minority people
can band together and become a ma
jority presence?" "Why should 1 re
ject 'colorblindness' as a way of skirt
ing today's racial inequality if it
means I have to admit my privilege
as the default position of power?"
There are more general questions
we can ask: Why would white people
care about ending today's subtle
forms of racism and racist ways of
conceptualizing the world if they di
rectly and indirectly benefit from it?
And lastly, why would (white) Amer
ica** apologize for injustices — like
slavery, which was as legal and eco
nomically beneficial in the United
States as the Holocaust was in Ger

many — if our current wealth, world
dominance, and power is based upon
the institutional oppression of peo
ple based solely on race? Do these
questions make you uncomfortable
or angry? They should, because they
point out why race is still an impor
tant issue today at Stanford and in
America.
1 am "calling out" whites so to
speak, not because I want to make
this an "us" versus "them" debate.
Whiteness needs to be brought to
the table because we continue to talk
about "minority issues" and
racial/ethnic disparity, but do not
speak of white dominance. It is a dif
ficult and uncomfortable subject to
talk about, but critical to under
standing why racial inequity contin
ues to persist in the 21st century.
Whites should not feel bad that they
have historically been the politically,
economically and socially dominant
group because guilt doesn't help
change things. Instead, they need to
be cognizant of the reality of white
privilege and not believe their rela
tive success is proof of so-called
American meritocracy. And once we
are all on the same page, construc
tive dialogue about achieving social
equality can finally begin.
I was doing my weekly browse
through history textbooks*** the
other day, and noticed that since our
first president in 1789, our nation of
equality, freedom, and democracy
has not had a single president who
was not white. And unlike the ASSU
white candidates and the SOCC en
dorsement process, minorities have
run for the presidency. See the U.S.
government's Web site for a power
ful, visual representation of Ameri
can Leadership and authority:
http://www.whitehouse.gov/histo
ry/presidents/index2.html. 1 might
venture to say that this "is essential
ly racist," to use the Editorial
Board's words. But, 1 won't. I will let
the readers judge for themselves.
Now I present the true gem of the
editorial, again, my own italics:
"Not only is this approach to en
dorsements essentially racist, it also
damages the democratic process by
framing the election in terms of color
rather than the issues. There is no
problem with the SOCC or a similar
group making endorsements, so long
as this support is based on issues
other than race. As it stands, SOCC
endorsements distract from the
dozens of important issues that af
fect Stanford students."
According to The Daily's Editori
al Board, race is not one of the issues
student votes may address if students
feel it is a real concern, nor is it an
"important" one. This board has ex
plicitly stated that addressing race in
a free choice election that is 47 per
cent non-white is anti-democratic.
Most importantly, however, this Edi
torial Board has testified, in print,
that race does not affect Stanford stu
dents. As a response, not just students
of color, but every single person who
is conscious of and against implicit,
racist ideologies — even if they ben
efit from them — must help end this
ignorance. I ask that these individuals
flood The Daily with letters describ
ing one or several acts of intolerance
that have occurred on this campus in
recent memory. And afterwards.

please check the Office for Campus
Relations Acts of Intolerance Proto
col to make sure the incidents do not
go unrecognized: http://www.stan
ford.edu/dept/ocr/intolerance.html.
To demand that the SOCC or any
student group should refrain from
highlighting the issue of race during
elections only allows racism to flour
ish in the subtle form it takes on
today.
"Election Bill 05, which prohibit
ed SOCC endorsements from ap
pearing on the ballot ... marks an
important first step in containing
the group's discriminatory prac
tices. Now it is the responsibility of
students to hold the SOCC account
able for its actions, and for the coali
tion itself to listen to the voices of
reason and embrace the spirit of
democracy."
Perhaps I am once again being
naive, but 1 cannot see how "con
taining" the voice that advocates
racial equality is in the spirit of
democracy, or freedom of speech
for that matter. Racial and ethnic
groups affiliated with SOCC that
applied for special fees passed with
between 61 and 68 percent of the
entire undergraduate student
body's support in the elections,
which marks an important first step
in addressing the University's
changing demographics. Now it is
the responsibility of all students to
hold groups such as The Daily ac
countable for their actions, and for
the paper itself to listen to the voic
es of the majority and reason, and to
embrace the spirit of equality. It is
students' right to support the
groups that address the issues im
portant to them — not The Daily's
Editorial Board — through special
fees and other ballot measures. Re
fund requests for special fees are ac
cepted from 8 a.m. of the first day of
the quarter until 5 p.m. of the third
Friday of the quarter, April 21. Visit

information.
Notes:
* Though it may be read as hypo
critical, this phrase and other white
centric references are used here in
hopes of illustrating the implicit
racism imbedded in our language
and mentality.
** Most people**** would agree
that in general usage, the parentheti
cal is assumed. Since 1492, non
whites in America have been regard
ed as "special interest groups" and
therefore cannot claim the prefix
free title of "American" like whites.
However, to appease the politically
correct in the readership, the paren
theses have been added.
***This is only partially true. I oc
casionally browse through history
textbooks, not weekly.The exaggera
tion was for comedic effect.
****The use of "people" in this
case falls in line with the historical
and contemporary use of the word
that implies whiteness is the default
or standard of human existence.
This suggests that race may. in fact,
be an issue that affects Stanford stu
dents.

Perhaps I am once again being

The following information on Stanford's un
dergraduate population comes from the
Stanford University Facts page for
prospective students:
African American: 701 (10 percent)
American Indian/Alaska Native: 147 (2 percent)
Asian American/Pacific Islander: 1.620 (24 per
cent)
White: 2,732 (41 percent)
International: 403 (6 percent)
Mexican American: 566 (8 percent)
Other I lispanic: 203 (3 percent)
Unidentified: 333 (5 percent)
Iliese numbers suggest that significantly less
than half of the student body is white — in other
words, students of color together make up the un
dergraduate majority. With that in mind, look at
the next sentence from The Daily's lament on
SOCC's effects on the democratic process of vot

ing (The SOCC: A blight on the democratic
process?" April 17):
"Of course, special interest groups will always
factor in the results of an election."
I'm black and female, but I know my num
bers well and I can see 47 is a larger number than
41 (47 excludes "international" and "unidenti
fied"). So when I see the entire Editorial Board
of The Daily agreeing with the statement that 47
percent of Stanford undergrads are "special in
terest," I ask myself, are they implicitly saying
that whiteness is the standard, and that every
thing but is "special" or a deviation of that stan
dard?
Yes. Yes they are.
I have learned that since the days of imperial
ism, people of European descent have classified
themselves as the measure of civilization, the
highest form of human existence — thanks to
my History, CAS A and CSRE courses. But I
thought that perhaps at Stanford, in this little
bubble of ours, I could pretend that the modern.
Western world doesn't continue to operate upon

this implicit, white-centric principle. After read
ing the editorial about SOCC, I realize that I was
a fool to think so. The cream of the crop — that
being smart Stanford kids — can only be as good
(or bad) as their society will permit, and this ed
itorial board has demonstrated it is no exception.
Many, not everyone, of the 47 percent of us take
the label of "special interest" and even "non
white," l< as a slap in our collective face. Figura
tively.
Many will turn and say,"But the ASSU is di
verse. So, it looks like we can be better than our
society." The response to this is yes and no. Yes,
because at last minority students are being rep
resented in seats of power in growing numbers.
But no, because for many — such as the mem
bers of The Daily Editorial Board and those
who agree with their expressed sentiments —
the idea of a growing majority-minority pres
ence is disquieting and threatening, and they
are lashing out.
If this editorial is any indication
of what the "average" Stanford stu
dent believes, we all need to work
harder to eradicate this subcon
scious, racist thinking. MSNBC has
an articulate article on the new phe
nomenon of the majority-minority:
http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9001
157/.
To continue with my analysis of
this editorial, I present two more ex
cerpts, (italics my own):
"The criteria for these endorse
ments were predictable: the candi
dates had to demonstrate or promise
support for diversity and ethnic
groups on campus and display a pas
sion for improving the life of Stan
ford 's ethnic minorities... SOCC only
endorsed minority candidates, and
not a single white student. It stretch
es this Board's capacity for reason
and belief that not even one non-mi
nority candidate for the Undergrad
uate Senate would have effectively
campaigned for diversity, or that not
a single non-minority candidate
could be considered a trusted friend
of these ethnic groups."
The information these Editorial
Board members have refused to pro
vide their readership with (or simply
did not bother to check) is that a can
didate must apply to become SOCC
endorsed. Ben Ilegbodu (Class of
'06), a fellow student of color ex
plained fellow student of color ex
plained. "It's not like they [SOCC]
look at the list of Senate candidates
and are like 'hmmm ... she looks
good ... oh yeah ... so does he.' And
correct me if I'm wrong, but there
were minority candidates who ap
plied for the endorsement and didn't
receive it. Furthermore, there were
minority candidates, Marcelo Wors
ley for one, who weren't SOCC en
dorsed and yet still won. The reason
no white candidates were SOCC en
dorsed wasn't because SOCC is
"racist," but because no white candi
dates applied for the endorsement. I
must repeat and emphasize this one
essential fact: No white candidates
applied for the endorsement. It
would seem that this group of board
members needs to exercise their "ca
pacity for reason and belief" to get it
into shape.
So here's a mental exercise. Ask
yourself (for the percentage of you
who are not white, pretend you are),
"Should I support ethnic/racial di
versity if it means minority people
can band together and become a ma
jority presence?" "Why should 1 re
ject 'colorblindness' as a way of skirt
ing today's racial inequality if it
means I have to admit my privilege
as the default position of power?"
There are more general questions
we can ask: Why would white people
care about ending today's subtle
forms of racism and racist ways of
conceptualizing the world if they di
rectly and indirectly benefit from it?
And lastly, why would (white) Amer
ica** apologize for injustices — like
slavery, which was as legal and eco
nomically beneficial in the United
States as the Holocaust was in Ger

many — if our current wealth, world
dominance, and power is based upon
the institutional oppression of peo
ple based solely on race? Do these
questions make you uncomfortable
or angry? They should, because they
point out why race is still an impor
tant issue today at Stanford and in
America.
1 am "calling out" whites so to
speak, not because I want to make
this an "us" versus "them" debate.
Whiteness needs to be brought to
the table because we continue to talk
about "minority issues" and
racial/ethnic disparity, but do not
speak of white dominance. It is a dif
ficult and uncomfortable subject to
talk about, but critical to under
standing why racial inequity contin
ues to persist in the 21st century.
Whites should not feel bad that they
have historically been the politically,
economically and socially dominant
group because guilt doesn't help
change things. Instead, they need to
be cognizant of the reality of white
privilege and not believe their rela
tive success is proof of so-called
American meritocracy. And once we
are all on the same page, construc
tive dialogue about achieving social
equality can finally begin.
I was doing my weekly browse
through history textbooks*** the
other day, and noticed that since our
first president in 1789, our nation of
equality, freedom, and democracy
has not had a single president who
was not white. And unlike the ASSU
white candidates and the SOCC en
dorsement process, minorities have
run for the presidency. See the U.S.

ence is disquieting and threatening, and they
are lashing out.
If this editorial is any indication
of what the "average" Stanford stu
dent believes, we all need to work
harder to eradicate this subcon
scious, racist thinking. MSNBC has
an articulate article on the new phe
nomenon of the majority-minority:
http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9001
157/.
To continue with my analysis of
this editorial, I present two more ex
cerpts, (italics my own):
"The criteria for these endorse
ments were predictable: the candi
dates had to demonstrate or promise
support for diversity and ethnic
groups on campus and display a pas
sion for improving the life of Stan
ford 's ethnic minorities... SOCC only
endorsed minority candidates, and
not a single white student. It stretch
es this Board's capacity for reason
and belief that not even one non-mi
nority candidate for the Undergrad
uate Senate would have effectively
campaigned for diversity, or that not
a single non-minority candidate
could be considered a trusted friend
of these ethnic groups."
The information these Editorial
Board members have refused to pro
vide their readership with (or simply
did not bother to check) is that a can
didate must apply to become SOCC
endorsed. Ben Ilegbodu (Class of
'06), a fellow student of color ex
plained fellow student of color ex
plained. "It's not like they [SOCC]
look at the list of Senate candidates
and are like 'hmmm ... she looks
good ... oh yeah ... so does he.' And
correct me if I'm wrong, but there
were minority candidates who ap
plied for the endorsement and didn't
receive it. Furthermore, there were
minority candidates, Marcelo Wors
ley for one, who weren't SOCC en
dorsed and yet still won. The reason
no white candidates were SOCC en
dorsed wasn't because SOCC is
"racist," but because no white candi
dates applied for the endorsement. I
must repeat and emphasize this one
essential fact: No white candidates
applied for the endorsement. It
would seem that this group of board
members needs to exercise their "ca
pacity for reason and belief" to get it
into shape.
So here's a mental exercise. Ask
yourself (for the percentage of you
who are not white, pretend you are),
"Should I support ethnic/racial di
versity if it means minority people
can band together and become a ma
jority presence?" "Why should 1 re
ject 'colorblindness' as a way of skirt
ing today's racial inequality if it
means I have to admit my privilege
as the default position of power?"
There are more general questions
we can ask: Why would white people
care about ending today's subtle
forms of racism and racist ways of
conceptualizing the world if they di
rectly and indirectly benefit from it?
And lastly, why would (white) Amer
ica** apologize for injustices — like
slavery, which was as legal and eco
nomically beneficial in the United
States as the Holocaust was in Ger

many — if our current wealth, world
dominance, and power is based upon
the institutional oppression of peo
ple based solely on race? Do these
questions make you uncomfortable
or angry? They should, because they
point out why race is still an impor
tant issue today at Stanford and in
America.
1 am "calling out" whites so to
speak, not because I want to make
this an "us" versus "them" debate.
Whiteness needs to be brought to
the table because we continue to talk
about "minority issues" and
racial/ethnic disparity, but do not
speak of white dominance. It is a dif
ficult and uncomfortable subject to
talk about, but critical to under
standing why racial inequity contin
ues to persist in the 21st century.
Whites should not feel bad that they
have historically been the politically,
economically and socially dominant
group because guilt doesn't help
change things. Instead, they need to
be cognizant of the reality of white
privilege and not believe their rela
tive success is proof of so-called
American meritocracy. And once we
are all on the same page, construc
tive dialogue about achieving social
equality can finally begin.
I was doing my weekly browse
through history textbooks*** the
other day, and noticed that since our
first president in 1789, our nation of
equality, freedom, and democracy
has not had a single president who
was not white. And unlike the ASSU
white candidates and the SOCC en
dorsement process, minorities have
run for the presidency. See the U.S.
government's Web site for a power
ful, visual representation of Ameri
can Leadership and authority:
http://www.whitehouse.gov/histo
ry/presidents/index2.html. 1 might
venture to say that this "is essential
ly racist," to use the Editorial
Board's words. But, 1 won't. I will let
the readers judge for themselves.
Now I present the true gem of the
editorial, again, my own italics:
"Not only is this approach to en
dorsements essentially racist, it also
damages the democratic process by
framing the election in terms of color
rather than the issues. There is no
problem with the SOCC or a similar
group making endorsements, so long
as this support is based on issues
other than race. As it stands, SOCC
endorsements distract from the
dozens of important issues that af
fect Stanford students."
According to The Daily's Editori
al Board, race is not one of the issues
student votes may address if students
feel it is a real concern, nor is it an
"important" one. This board has ex
plicitly stated that addressing race in
a free choice election that is 47 per
cent non-white is anti-democratic.
Most importantly, however, this Edi
torial Board has testified, in print,
that race does not affect Stanford stu
dents. As a response, not just students
of color, but every single person who
is conscious of and against implicit,
racist ideologies — even if they ben
efit from them — must help end this
ignorance. I ask that these individuals
flood The Daily with letters describ
ing one or several acts of intolerance
that have occurred on this campus in
recent memory. And afterwards.

please check the Office for Campus
Relations Acts of Intolerance Proto
col to make sure the incidents do not
go unrecognized: http://www.stan
ford.edu/dept/ocr/intolerance.html.
To demand that the SOCC or any
student group should refrain from
highlighting the issue of race during
elections only allows racism to flour
ish in the subtle form it takes on
today.
"Election Bill 05, which prohibit
ed SOCC endorsements from ap
pearing on the ballot ... marks an
important first step in containing
the group's discriminatory prac
tices. Now it is the responsibility of
students to hold the SOCC account
able for its actions, and for the coali
tion itself to listen to the voices of
reason and embrace the spirit of
democracy."
Perhaps I am once again being
naive, but 1 cannot see how "con
taining" the voice that advocates
racial equality is in the spirit of
democracy, or freedom of speech
for that matter. Racial and ethnic
groups affiliated with SOCC that
applied for special fees passed with
between 61 and 68 percent of the
entire undergraduate student
body's support in the elections,
which marks an important first step
in addressing the University's
changing demographics. Now it is
the responsibility of all students to
hold groups such as The Daily ac
countable for their actions, and for
the paper itself to listen to the voic
es of the majority and reason, and to
embrace the spirit of equality. It is
students' right to support the
groups that address the issues im
portant to them — not The Daily's
Editorial Board — through special
fees and other ballot measures. Re
fund requests for special fees are ac
cepted from 8 a.m. of the first day of
the quarter until 5 p.m. of the third
Friday of the quarter, April 21. Visit

Notes:
* Though it may be read as hypo
critical, this phrase and other white
centric references are used here in
hopes of illustrating the implicit
racism imbedded in our language
and mentality.
** Most people**** would agree
that in general usage, the parentheti
cal is assumed. Since 1492, non
whites in America have been regard
ed as "special interest groups" and
therefore cannot claim the prefix
free title of "American" like whites.
However, to appease the politically
correct in the readership, the paren
theses have been added.
***This is only partially true. I oc
casionally browse through history
textbooks, not weekly.The exaggera
tion was for comedic effect.
****The use of "people" in this
case falls in line with the historical
and contemporary use of the word
that implies whiteness is the default
or standard of human existence.
This suggests that race may. in fact,
be an issue that affects Stanford stu
dents.
