## Response to the Board's editorial on SOCC 
### HAZELLA BOWMANI 
The following information on Stanford's un
dergraduate population comes from the
Stanford University Facts page for
prospective students:
African American: 701 (10 percent)
American Indian/Alaska Native: 147 (2 percent)
Asian American/Pacific Islander: 1.620 (24 per
cent)
White: 2,732 (41 percent)
International: 403 (6 percent)
Mexican American: 566 (8 percent)
Other I lispanic: 203 (3 percent)
Unidentified: 333 (5 percent)
Iliese numbers suggest that significantly less
than half of the student body is white — in other
words, students of color together make up the un
dergraduate majority. With that in mind, look at
the next sentence from The Daily's lament on
SOCC's effects on the democratic process of vot

ing (The SOCC: A blight on the democratic
process?" April 17):
"Of course, special interest groups will always
factor in the results of an election."
I'm black and female, but I know my num
bers well and I can see 47 is a larger number than
41 (47 excludes "international" and "unidenti
fied"). So when I see the entire Editorial Board
of The Daily agreeing with the statement that 47
percent of Stanford undergrads are "special in
terest," I ask myself, are they implicitly saying
that whiteness is the standard, and that every
thing but is "special" or a deviation of that stan
dard?
Yes. Yes they are.
I have learned that since the days of imperial
ism, people of European descent have classified
themselves as the measure of civilization, the
highest form of human existence — thanks to
my History, CAS A and CSRE courses. But I
thought that perhaps at Stanford, in this little
bubble of ours, I could pretend that the modern.
Western world doesn't continue to operate upon

this implicit, white-centric principle. After read
ing the editorial about SOCC, I realize that I was
a fool to think so. The cream of the crop — that
being smart Stanford kids — can only be as good
(or bad) as their society will permit, and this ed
itorial board has demonstrated it is no exception.
Many, not everyone, of the 47 percent of us take
the label of "special interest" and even "non
white," l< as a slap in our collective face. Figura
tively.
Many will turn and say,"But the ASSU is di
verse. So, it looks like we can be better than our
society." The response to this is yes and no. Yes,
because at last minority students are being rep
resented in seats of power in growing numbers.
But no, because for many — such as the mem
bers of The Daily Editorial Board and those
who agree with their expressed sentiments —
the idea of a growing majority-minority pres
ence is disquieting and threatening, and they
are lashing out.
