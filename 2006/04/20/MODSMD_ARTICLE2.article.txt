Stanford rolls out the Cardinal carpet
today as the University welcomes over
1.500 prospective freshmen (ProFros) to
campus for its annual Admit Weekend,
which will run from Thursday morning to
Saturday night.
It's a record year for Stanford â€” a
record number of applicants, a record-low
admissions rate and a record-high turnout
for Admit Weekend.
Over 1(H) events have been organized for
the weekend, encompassing the various ac
ademic, residential and social aspects of the
University. Student coordinators have been
planning the programs and recruiting
House Hosts (HoHos) and Room Hosts
(RoHos) since October.

According to Admit Weekend Director
Matt Sargent, programming will include
"special lectures given by faculty members,
research presentations by students, tours
of campus attractions, informational pan
els about opportunities at Stanford, com
munity center programs, recreational ac
tivities, student performances, talks by
campus administrators, dorm-based
events, academic department open houses
and an activities fair."
"We're pleased to be able to entertain
and provide exposure to the students we've
admitted to the incoming class," said Dean
of Undergraduate Admission Richard
Shaw.
