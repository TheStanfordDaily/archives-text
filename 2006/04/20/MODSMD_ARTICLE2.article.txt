# ADMIT FEVER
## ...And the only prescription is more ProFros 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
Stanford rolls out the Cardinal carpet
today as the University welcomes over
1.500 prospective freshmen (ProFros) to
campus for its annual Admit Weekend,
which will run from Thursday morning to
Saturday night.
It's a record year for Stanford â€” a
record number of applicants, a record-low
admissions rate and a record-high turnout
for Admit Weekend.
Over 1(H) events have been organized for
the weekend, encompassing the various ac
ademic, residential and social aspects of the
University. Student coordinators have been
planning the programs and recruiting
House Hosts (HoHos) and Room Hosts
(RoHos) since October.

According to Admit Weekend Director
Matt Sargent, programming will include
"special lectures given by faculty members,
research presentations by students, tours
of campus attractions, informational pan
els about opportunities at Stanford, com
munity center programs, recreational ac
tivities, student performances, talks by
campus administrators, dorm-based
events, academic department open houses
and an activities fair."
"We're pleased to be able to entertain
and provide exposure to the students we've
admitted to the incoming class," said Dean
of Undergraduate Admission Richard
Shaw.
Stanford received a record 22,332 appli
cations for next year's freshman class, ac-

Prospective freshman are given information packets about the plethora of activities offered during Admit Weekend at Tresidder Union. A record
number of prospective students is expected at this year's event. Stanford received a record number of applicants for the Class of 2010.
cording to the Office of Undergradu
ate Admission.
Just under 11 percent of what
Shaw called a "very strong applicant
pool" were admitted, making this
year's application process the most
selective in history.
As of TUesday night. 1,498 stu
dents had registered for Admit
Weekend, a new high. Host Recruit
ment and Publicity Co-Coordinator
Marc Rillera, a junior, estimates that
about 100 more prospective fresh
men will attend events without hav
ing registered.
"We usually fluctuate between
1,100 and 1,300" prospective fresh
men, said Rillera. "This year we have
a big influx of ProFros coming to
Admit Weekend."
Rillera said that this was the
major challenge for coordinators.
"The biggest difference [from
past years] is that we have way more
ProFros coming this year, so we have
to accommodate that." he said.
Sargent spoke about other
changes that have been made to this
year's program, including the debut
of five interdisciplinary academic
expos.
In addition, the check-in location
has been moved from Tresidder
Union to the Arrillaga Alumni Cen
ter.
"Tresidder has always been very
packed." Rillera said. "Arrillaga is a
much nicer presentation for the
prospective freshmen."
Organizers say they will empha
size Stanford's energetic, positive at
mosphere during Admit Weekend.
"A lot of [students) constantly say
that they felt so welcomed because of
the environment," Rillera said. "I
hear that at other schools' admit
weekends, you just come, you regis
ter, and it's like. dead. Here at Stan
ford, from the moment ProFros step
in during registration, we like to blow
things out of proportion and make
things very flashy.
"I think that Stanford does a real
ly good job in giving the [prospec
tive] students a more comprehensive

perspective on what the University
has to offer," he added. "The pro
gramming introduces ProFros to a
lighter side of Stanford."
Rillera added that an important
part of Admit Weekend is giving
students "a chance to meet and
bond with other prospective fresh
men."
Shaw agreed, saying that "friend
ships will begin on this weekend.This
is a time for them to decide if they
like who they're talking to and if they
like the opportunities that we're
going to make available to them as
undergraduates."
In addition to meeting other
prospective students, "personal in
teraction with current students is a
high priority for many Admit Week
end attendees trying to make a col
lege choice," Sargent said.
"Students all across campus, di
rectly involved with Admit Weekend
or not, play a major role," he added.
According to Rillera, last year's
yield rate for students who attended
Admit Weekend was "somewhere
upwards of 90 percent."
"We're going to try to target
roughly around that same number
again for this year," he said.
Students have until May 1 to
make their decisions.
According to Sargent, "feedback
from past years suggests that Admit
Weekend plays a major role in the
decision-making process of our
prospective students."
Admit Weekend will "give the
students exposure to a mini-orienta
tion to what Stanford has to offer in
general," Shaw said. "They'll have
lots to do and so will their parents."
Ultimately, said Shaw, the pur
pose of Admit Weekend is to give
prospective freshmen "as much in
formation as possible so they can
make the best decision they can pos
sibly make."
Sargent added that "with the in
spiring accomplishments and poten
tial of this admitted class, we do, of
course, hope that they will choose to
spend their undergraduate years at

Stanford."
However. I lost Recruitment and
Publicity Co-coordinator Arielle
Montgomery, a sophomore, ac
knowledged that "Stanford has so
much more for its matriculated stu
dents than we can possibly promote
during Admit Weekend.
"I've told countless ProFros over
the past few weeks that they should
use Admit Weekend as one of many
tools to help them make their final
decision," she added.
Even though he has already dec
ided to come to Stanford, prospec
tive freshman Patrick Blaes said that
he is looking forward to meeting fu
ture classmates and learning more
about Stanford this weekend.
"I'm excited to check out the
campus and experience living in the
dorms firsthand." Blaes said.
Sally Hudson, another prospec
tive freshman, expressed similar
thoughts.
"When I visited Stanford last fall,
I got a general feel for the school,"
she said. "I'm hoping to delve deeper
at Admit Weekend. I'll have a chance
to focus on specifics, like housing op
tions and course offerings."
Hudson added that she is "defi
nitely pumped" to meet other mem
bers of the Class of 2010.
Concerning the Admit Weekend
programming, prospective freshman
Cristina Munoz said that "everything
sounds really cool."
Admit Weekend coordinators say
they are looking forward to the on
slaught of ProFros on campus.
"I couldn't be more excited."
Montgomery said. "I'm looking for
ward to meeting as many of them and
their parents as I can. We've been
working on this all year and I could
n't be more ready to show them what
we're all about."
Stanford will welcome its ProFros
to partly cloudy weather Thursday,
with a high of 72. Occasional showers
are possible for Friday and Saturday.
Temperatures are forecasted to be
between 50 and 65 degrees for the
weekend.
