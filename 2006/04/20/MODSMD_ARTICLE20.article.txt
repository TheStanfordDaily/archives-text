### The case for a Muslim Community Center on campus 
When I came back from a trip to
the Middle East in 2(X)4,1 was eager to
connect with Muslim and Arab organ
izations on campus. I found several
well-organized, friendly and open
Arab and Muslim organizations put
ting amazing programs together with
minimal funding aimed at all students
on the Stanford campus.
But I was surprised to find that de
spite the commitment and excellence
of the students involved, and the im
portance of their programs, they had
no permanent place on campus to call
home, store their materials or convene
meetings. They had no place of their
own to host students or create a sense
of history and continuity. They did a
phenomenal job bouncing around be
tween temporary spots and bringing
world-class speakers and programs
that reached thousands of students on
Stanford's campus.

Given their commitment, and the
importance of their work to the cam
pus, it is time to dedicate serious re
sources to these groups that rival the
resources given to similar religious,
ethnic and cultural groups on cam
pus.
A Muslim Community Center on
Stanford's campus will help support
education, tolerance and peace on our
campus and around the world as fu
ture leaders from Stanford take les
sons with them to the broader world. It
would be one of the first of such cen
ters in the United States to help bridge
the divides created by misconceptions
and stereotypes.
This way, Stanford students won't
have to wait until they've actually
taken a trip to the Middle East to get
acquainted with Arab and Muslim cul
ture and politics in a more compelling
and even-handed way.
