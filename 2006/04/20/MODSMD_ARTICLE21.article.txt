## The 						facts on Duke's rape scandal 
### MEGHAN KESTNER 
The Daily published an article entitled "Duke
lacrosse team judged early, unfairly" (April 14),
which was speculative in nature and excluded sev
eral facts regarding the alleged rape case. A 27-year old
black female student at North Carolina Central Univer
sity has claimed that on the night of March 13, three
white members of the men's lacrosse team at Duke beat
and raped her in the bathroom of an off-campus house
where she was hired to perform as an exotic dancer for
a team party.
Comments throughout the article claim that the vic
tim's accusation was "completely without evidence." But
the article failed to mention that medical records regard
ing the victim's condition after the alleged attack found
"signs, symptoms and injuries consistent with being
raped and sexually assaulted." The article also failed to
mention that the roll of money the victim claimed was
taken from her by her attackers was later found by inves
tigators in the house where the party took place, along
with fake fingernails supporting her description of claw
ing at her attackers.
According to the article, the cancellation of the
lacrosse season has left the team's "seniors — who for
three years had sweat, suffered and bled for their team —
with no senior season to enjoy. All of this, still, without an
ounce of proof." In the past year alone, 15 members of
this lacrosse team have collected 20 criminal charges,
leading us to question how seriously they were con
cerned with protecting their eligibility. In fact, team
members themselves found the accusation of rape to be
a reasonable basis for forfeiture. On March 28 the team
captains suggested the suspension of their season to
Duke President Richard Brodhead. Brodhead com
mented to the press, "Sports have their time and place,
but when an issue of this gravity is in question, it is not the
time to be playing games."
Friday's article also reported that individuals and or
ganizations took advantage of the victim's accusation to
rally support for their opinions on "social issues" and
"racial flags," which unfairly "denigrated" and "vilified"
the members of the lacrosse team. As the article incor
rectly explains, "Because 46 of the 47 members of the
team were white and the stripper was black, it became a
race issue, a hate crime... people assumed something had

happened and [sic] that the team was guilty simply be
cause its members were of a specific race." In reality, the
racial issues involved in the event were raised because of
a 911 call describing racial slurs heard in the house where
the alleged rape took place. Authorities also discovered a
sexually-vulgar and racially-discriminatory email sent by
a sophomore on the team merely two hours after the al
leged attack that alluded to "tonight's show."
The article published even went so far as to claim that
"the only real criminals here are those that are willing to
sacrifice the reputation of a school, a community and the
lives of 47 innocent young men merely to further their
own agendas."These supposed "agendas" include contro
versial issues of racial politics, sexual coercion and socio
economic disparity that already existed and continue to
exist in Durham and throughout the United States.
But it would be unfair for a community, especially an
intellectually curious, academic community, to fail to ex
plore these issues and their effects on the human condi
tion. Brodhead remarked in a statement to the Duke com
munity, "This is a deeply emotional time as well as a rare
opportunity for education — for our students, faculty, ad
ministrators and members of our community. Let's move
forward with a serious commitment to make progress on
the many complex issues that confront us now."
1 sincerely hope for the sake of the two boys who have
been charged and arrested that they will be proven inno
cent. DNA tests of the 46 white team members did, in
fact, fail to prove that any of these men raped the victim.
But the article published in The Daily was hasty in por
traying the team as the victim of socio-political "agen
das" and in so vehemently claiming the innocence of the
young men involved. Indeed, media reports include Dis
trict Attorney Mike Nifong's note that 75 to 80 percent of
rape prosecutions are carried out without DNA evi
dence. As Brodhead explained, "In this situation of in
flamed passions and painful uncertainty, I have empha
sized the importance of not rushing to judgment and al
lowing the legal system to establish the truth." While the
nation waits to learn the reality of the disputed events,
our own community at Stanford deserves to be informed
of published facts without such insensitive, unsupported
conjectures that appeared in The Daily last Friday.
