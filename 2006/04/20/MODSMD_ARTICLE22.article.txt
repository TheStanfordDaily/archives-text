## Fairway feels like home for frosh Chun 
### CARSON COOPER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A freshman student-athlete faces in
credible challenges in their first year on
the Farm. They must deal with pointless
IHUM readings while practicing their
sport for hours each day, drudge
through PWR while worrying about
their team initiation, and get along with
a new roommate while facing the pres
sures of competing at a Stanford level of
competitiveness.
All these factors make freshman
golfer Mari Chun's accomplishments
this year that much more remarkable.
The Hawaii native has had an impres
sive season, performing under heavy ex
pectations for the No. 21 Cardinal. How
ever, the year got off to a rough start.
During freshman orientation, Chun
began to suffer from tendonitis in her left
Achilles heel. To compound her misery,
she sprained her right ankle shortly after.
"Although they may seem minor, I
never had any serious injuries, especial
ly ones which directly affected my
swing," Chun said.
The ankle injury came just days be
fore the team's first tournament of the
year. Luckily, Chun had the support of
her teammates on the close-knit squad.
Having another freshman on the
team also helped Chun immensely. Ki
Shui Liao and Chun developed a close
relationship, formed in large part be
cause of Chun's lack of a car.
"I'm the only one on the team without
a car," she said. "Ki Shui has helped me so
much with my transition to Stanford."
Chun ended up playing with both feet
taped due to her injuries, a difficult task
for a golfer, who must drive with one
foot while harshly twisting the other.
After finishing in a tie for 33rd at the
Edean Ihlenfeldt Invitational, Chun
made a quick recovery. She took l()th
place at the Stanford Pepsi Intercolle
giate, including a final round 68. That 3-
under-par round marks the best round
by any Stanford competitor this year,
and showed Chun's affinity for her
home course.
"Playing on our home course is such
a great feeling," she said."Not only is the
golf course familiar, but the support
from the Stanford community really
makes the entire experience enjoyable."
Duringthe spring season, Chun's top
performance also came at the Stanford
Golf Course in the Peg Barnard Colle
giate, in which she tied for 7th place.
Junior teammate Jenna Seki echoed
Chun's sentiments about their home
course. Seki finished fifth in the Peg
Barnard Collegiate, shooting a 72 on
the final day for her top round of the
year.
"I think it's particularly special to
play at home," Seki said. "We are
able to play with a lot of confidence
on our home turf."
However, Chun will not have the
home turf advantage in her next
match. The team travels to Oro Val
ley, Ariz. Monday for the Pac-10
Championships.
In Oro Valley, the Card will face
what promises to be the toughest

field of the year, including USC's
Irene Cho, the No. 2 golfer in the na
tion, and the winner of the Peg
Barnard Collegiate.
The team title appears to be a
two-team race between No. 2 UCLA
and No. 3 Arizona State. However,
junior Lauren Todd believes that the
Card has a chance to steal the title.
"This team has enough talent to
do so," she said. "We just have to get
it going all at the same time."
Head Coach Caroline O'Connor
is taking a more moderate approach
to the tournament.
"I think we're feeling pretty good
about our last two tournaments as
we move into the post season, so
we're hoping to improve upon the
past two weeks," O'Connor said.
