The end of the road
This is so weird to be interviewed by my
roommate! Regarding the Senior Day coming
up on Saturday, I think on one hand since we
know that NCAAs are at home this year, it
doesn't really feel like the end, but on the
other hand — since I've done so many Senior
Days for all the girls who are older — it's re
ally weird that it's me now that's a senior
being honored. It's so strange to think that...
that's it.
I was just talking to Megan [Doheny] about
how we go to Ojai next weekend and that's
going to be my last tournament, most likely
ever — at least at this competitive level. That
just gets me thinking ... we've all been playing
tennis since we were like six or seven, and it
gets really intense pretty fast once you start
playing tournaments and stuff all year round. It
makes me realize, wow, tennis has been such a
huge part of my life up till now. Two months
from now. it's not going to be anymore. It's very
surreal; I can't really picture it yet.
The next step
I start work on July 5, investment banking in
New York with Citigroup. It turns out there are
lot of athletes that go into investment banking,
so tennis is a very good conversation starter.
Because I worked there over the summer, too,
I kind of have a feel, from the people I met, that
there is a good culture where people are really
into sports, whether or not they played in col
lege. In banking, you work in teams, and that's
very similar to being on an athletic team.
It's an environment that I think I'm com
fortable with and have definitely gotten used
to, so it helps me feel less anxious about next
year. In terms of dedication and balancing an
environment where people are very strong and
competitive — but hopefully not to the point
where you can't work together — I think I can
definitely take away a lot of tennis experience
and apply it to my job.
Being dirty
I have the not-very-well-known nickname
of Dirty J, which I inherited from my brother
because he would hit these net cords — which
the men have to play — at just the right time, so
he was jokingly labeled "dirty." And somehow
that got passed on to me when I came in as a
freshman. Most people don't understand the
"dirty" reference — to clarify, it's not because
I'm Asian!
• Kao coalition
As far as playing at Stanford with my broth
er [Joseph Kao, Class of'o4], it didn't seem like
a very big deal. I think it probably affected him
more than me. At initiation, and at all the
events we have, I think he kind of stepped aside

and let me have my full experience.
But there were a lot of times when I didn't
really know what was going on and it was just
very easy for me to ask him questions because
I obviously had no inhibitions around him.
Also, he'd give me advice about how to handle
things — not just tennis, but everything about
being a freshman in general. He would defi
nitely be there for me when I needed him.
Then slowly, I didn't rely on him as much.
Basically, once you are no longer a freshman,
you know the way everything works and you
feel more comfortable with everything. So I
found my own place within just the women's
team.
I think also that when he was around our
teams were a little bit closer, because there was

a brother-sister duo on the teams, so we all
hung out more — though that also has to do
with a lot of the older guys who organized
things when I was a freshman.
It is funny that there's kind of a Kao legacy
on the teams — although the Kaos on the team
now [Phil Kao and Ken Kao are on the men's
team] are not related. Like, there's no relation
whatsoever.
The benevolent dictatorship
I'd like to say that I coined the phrase
