The end of the road
This is so weird to be interviewed by my
roommate! Regarding the Senior Day coming
up on Saturday, I think on one hand since we
know that NCAAs are at home this year, it
doesn't really feel like the end, but on the
other hand — since I've done so many Senior
Days for all the girls who are older — it's re
ally weird that it's me now that's a senior
being honored. It's so strange to think that...
that's it.
I was just talking to Megan [Doheny] about
how we go to Ojai next weekend and that's
going to be my last tournament, most likely
ever — at least at this competitive level. That
just gets me thinking ... we've all been playing
tennis since we were like six or seven, and it
gets really intense pretty fast once you start
playing tournaments and stuff all year round. It
makes me realize, wow, tennis has been such a
huge part of my life up till now. Two months
from now. it's not going to be anymore. It's very
surreal; I can't really picture it yet.
The next step
I start work on July 5, investment banking in
New York with Citigroup. It turns out there are
lot of athletes that go into investment banking,
so tennis is a very good conversation starter.
Because I worked there over the summer, too,
I kind of have a feel, from the people I met, that
there is a good culture where people are really
into sports, whether or not they played in col
lege. In banking, you work in teams, and that's
very similar to being on an athletic team.
It's an environment that I think I'm com
fortable with and have definitely gotten used
to, so it helps me feel less anxious about next
year. In terms of dedication and balancing an
environment where people are very strong and
competitive — but hopefully not to the point
where you can't work together — I think I can
definitely take away a lot of tennis experience
and apply it to my job.
Being dirty
I have the not-very-well-known nickname
of Dirty J, which I inherited from my brother
because he would hit these net cords — which
the men have to play — at just the right time, so
he was jokingly labeled "dirty." And somehow
that got passed on to me when I came in as a
freshman. Most people don't understand the
"dirty" reference — to clarify, it's not because
I'm Asian!
• Kao coalition
As far as playing at Stanford with my broth
er [Joseph Kao, Class of'o4], it didn't seem like
a very big deal. I think it probably affected him
more than me. At initiation, and at all the
events we have, I think he kind of stepped aside

and let me have my full experience.
But there were a lot of times when I didn't
really know what was going on and it was just
very easy for me to ask him questions because
I obviously had no inhibitions around him.
Also, he'd give me advice about how to handle
things — not just tennis, but everything about
being a freshman in general. He would defi
nitely be there for me when I needed him.
Then slowly, I didn't rely on him as much.
Basically, once you are no longer a freshman,
you know the way everything works and you
feel more comfortable with everything. So I
found my own place within just the women's
team.
I think also that when he was around our
teams were a little bit closer, because there was

a brother-sister duo on the teams, so we all
hung out more — though that also has to do
with a lot of the older guys who organized
things when I was a freshman.
It is funny that there's kind of a Kao legacy
on the teams — although the Kaos on the team
now [Phil Kao and Ken Kao are on the men's
team] are not related. Like, there's no relation
whatsoever.
The benevolent dictatorship
I'd like to say that I coined the phrase



JOEL LEWENSTEIN/The Stanford Daily
Senior Joanna Kao is all smiles as she finishes up herfourth and final year on the court forthe Card.
Last year she went to the NCAA tournament for the first time.
"benevolent dictatorship." It's
mainly because there are four sen
iors and we're a tight group. We're a
pretty small team, so the four of us
have a strong presence within the
team.
And when you're a senior, you
know the way everything goes —
and you're allowed to have your way
with things is the way I'll put it.
You're at a certain level where you
can do things that you can't do as an
underclassman. So in that way, we
are a dictatorship because we make

up a lot of the team and we're seniors
and we like to think of ways to trick
the team.
But then we're not really a dicta
torship because we just want things
to be fun, and obviously we all want
to win and it's an important thing to
us — but we also understand that
everyone wants to win and is trying
their hardest.
So that's why I thought of benev
olent, because we're a really nice
group of seniors and all of us have a
good understanding of what we need
to do to be able to work as a cohesive
team and still keep the competitive
ness pretty high.
People have mentioned in previ
ous interviews that there's definitely
a nice unity on our team, and that's

something that's important to the
four of us seniors, something that we
really want to keep. But, I mean,
we're still seniors and we still want it
to be our way — so it has to be a dic
tatorship nonetheless!
Teammates drawmates
friends for life
I'm drawmates with Alice
[Barnes] and oh, it's lots of fun! True,
I do see her like three hours a day at
practice, but it's nice coming back to
the house and being able to hang
out. Especially since we have such
an awesome third roommate who
balances us out, it's not all tennis
based. We'll do big things like go to

Napa or small things like open gift
packages from our third room
mate's aunt, and it's just a lot of fun
for us all to live together and be so
close.
Also, I'm Alice's chauffeur, so it
helps that we live together; it's a little
bit easier on me, really. 1 think it also
really reflects us all really getting
along on the team.
Alice is not just my teammate but
a lifelong friend, and at this point —
when we have two months left —
it's really nice to know that even
though she's going to be in England
far far away, whenever we see each
other again it's going to be like we
weren't apart. It's comforting to
know that, especially at this point of
our senior year.

things when I was a freshman.
It is funny that there's kind of a Kao legacy
on the teams — although the Kaos on the team
now [Phil Kao and Ken Kao are on the men's
team] are not related. Like, there's no relation
whatsoever.

"benevolent dictatorship." It's
mainly because there are four sen
iors and we're a tight group. We're a
pretty small team, so the four of us
have a strong presence within the
team.
And when you're a senior, you
know the way everything goes —
and you're allowed to have your way
with things is the way I'll put it.
You're at a certain level where you
can do things that you can't do as an
underclassman. So in that way, we
are a dictatorship because we make

up a lot of the team and we're seniors
and we like to think of ways to trick
the team.
But then we're not really a dicta
torship because we just want things
to be fun, and obviously we all want
to win and it's an important thing to
us — but we also understand that
everyone wants to win and is trying
their hardest.
So that's why I thought of benev
olent, because we're a really nice
group of seniors and all of us have a
good understanding of what we need
to do to be able to work as a cohesive
team and still keep the competitive
ness pretty high.
People have mentioned in previ
ous interviews that there's definitely
a nice unity on our team, and that's

something that's important to the
four of us seniors, something that we
really want to keep. But, I mean,
we're still seniors and we still want it
to be our way — so it has to be a dic
tatorship nonetheless!
Teammates drawmates
friends for life
I'm drawmates with Alice
[Barnes] and oh, it's lots of fun! True,
I do see her like three hours a day at
practice, but it's nice coming back to
the house and being able to hang
out. Especially since we have such
an awesome third roommate who
balances us out, it's not all tennis
based. We'll do big things like go to

Napa or small things like open gift
packages from our third room
mate's aunt, and it's just a lot of fun
for us all to live together and be so
close.
Also, I'm Alice's chauffeur, so it
helps that we live together; it's a little
bit easier on me, really. 1 think it also
really reflects us all really getting
along on the team.
Alice is not just my teammate but
a lifelong friend, and at this point —
when we have two months left —
it's really nice to know that even
though she's going to be in England
far far away, whenever we see each
other again it's going to be like we
weren't apart. It's comforting to
know that, especially at this point of
our senior year.

The end of the road
This is so weird to be interviewed by my
roommate! Regarding the Senior Day coming
up on Saturday, I think on one hand since we
know that NCAAs are at home this year, it
doesn't really feel like the end, but on the
other hand — since I've done so many Senior
Days for all the girls who are older — it's re
ally weird that it's me now that's a senior
being honored. It's so strange to think that...
that's it.
I was just talking to Megan [Doheny] about
how we go to Ojai next weekend and that's
going to be my last tournament, most likely
ever — at least at this competitive level. That
just gets me thinking ... we've all been playing
tennis since we were like six or seven, and it
gets really intense pretty fast once you start
playing tournaments and stuff all year round. It
makes me realize, wow, tennis has been such a
huge part of my life up till now. Two months
from now. it's not going to be anymore. It's very
surreal; I can't really picture it yet.
The next step
I start work on July 5, investment banking in
New York with Citigroup. It turns out there are
lot of athletes that go into investment banking,
so tennis is a very good conversation starter.
Because I worked there over the summer, too,
I kind of have a feel, from the people I met, that
there is a good culture where people are really
into sports, whether or not they played in col
lege. In banking, you work in teams, and that's
very similar to being on an athletic team.
It's an environment that I think I'm com
fortable with and have definitely gotten used
to, so it helps me feel less anxious about next
year. In terms of dedication and balancing an
environment where people are very strong and
competitive — but hopefully not to the point
where you can't work together — I think I can
definitely take away a lot of tennis experience
and apply it to my job.
Being dirty
I have the not-very-well-known nickname
of Dirty J, which I inherited from my brother
because he would hit these net cords — which
the men have to play — at just the right time, so
he was jokingly labeled "dirty." And somehow
that got passed on to me when I came in as a
freshman. Most people don't understand the
"dirty" reference — to clarify, it's not because
I'm Asian!
• Kao coalition
As far as playing at Stanford with my broth
er [Joseph Kao, Class of'o4], it didn't seem like
a very big deal. I think it probably affected him
more than me. At initiation, and at all the
events we have, I think he kind of stepped aside

and let me have my full experience.
But there were a lot of times when I didn't
really know what was going on and it was just
very easy for me to ask him questions because
I obviously had no inhibitions around him.
Also, he'd give me advice about how to handle
things — not just tennis, but everything about
being a freshman in general. He would defi
nitely be there for me when I needed him.
Then slowly, I didn't rely on him as much.
Basically, once you are no longer a freshman,
you know the way everything works and you
feel more comfortable with everything. So I
found my own place within just the women's
team.
I think also that when he was around our
teams were a little bit closer, because there was

a brother-sister duo on the teams, so we all
hung out more — though that also has to do
with a lot of the older guys who organized
things when I was a freshman.
It is funny that there's kind of a Kao legacy
on the teams — although the Kaos on the team
now [Phil Kao and Ken Kao are on the men's
team] are not related. Like, there's no relation
whatsoever.
