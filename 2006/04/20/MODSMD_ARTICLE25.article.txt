# The
						long legacy of losing

How do you measure medioc
rity?
Or even flat out awfulness for
that matter?
Well, the good folks at ESPN
gave it a shot earlier this week with
an online poll where fans ranked the
worst franchises across the four
major sports in terms of their terri
bleness. The Kansas City Royals
wound up placing as the first among
the worst in the rankings, but I
thought it would be fun — or maybe
cathartic for some — to take a look
at the list a little more closely.
Upon closer examination, the
names at the top of the list share a
common theme — hopelessness. It's
not the records, the stats, or even the
personnel that teams like the Roy
als, Detroit Lions (3), Arizona Car
dinals (4) and Atlanta Hawks (5)
have in common. It's the longstand
ing traditions of failure. As A 1 Davis
might say, they all seem to possess a
commitment to mediocrity.
These franchises have been
struggling just to reach a level of
competitiveness for so long, that ac
tual contention for any sort of mean
ingful victory isn't even a considera
tion. They are the teams parity for
got. In practical terms, they're like
the Florida Marlins without the
World Series rings every 4-5 years.
Moreover, for some of these
teams, their predicament is not for a
lack of effort. The New York Knicks
(9) have never failed because they
were too static or too afraid to
change the face of the franchise
with new players, coaches, or per
sonnel executives. But what have
they received for all their shuffling
of talent and leadership? Stephon
Marbury, Steve Francis and a 22-59
record.
So what's the common thread be
tween the malaise that grips these
most unfortunate franchises? Well,
none so far as I can see. Whether
you're the Royals, struggling to field
a team on a small market budget in a
big market world, or the Arizona
Cardinals, handcuffed by a cheap
and inept owner, or the Detroit
Lions, who would seem to have nei
ther of these flaws and yet neverthe
less languish at the bottom of the
NFL heap year in and year out, the
effect is the same.
Yet, despite the sob stories these
organizations present, not all is
gloom and doom for the forgotten
team's faithful. Because by the sim
ple law of averages, there will come
one year where those teams are no
longer horrible, and the nightmare
