# Beardman's foul foils Saint Mary's
## RBI single in bottom of the ninth scores Lappin, ends pitcher's duel, Severson shines as starter 
### ANDREW LOMELI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Nine innings of scoreless softball came down to one contro
versial call last night, as the No. 6 Stanford softball team (31 -8,5-
4 Pac-10) edged St. Mary s (4-36,0-8 Pacific Coast Softball Con
ference), 1-0.
Senior pinch runner Lauren Lappin stole home with one out
in the bottom of the ninth, drawing a mixed reaction from the
crowd in the process. Sophomore DH Anna Beardman flied out
to right, and the Gaels' defense tried to get sophomore runner
Michelle Smith out at second. Smith returned back to first, allow
ing Lappin time to steal home.
"[St. Mary's] argued I had run outside of the baseline, but I
definitely don't think I did," Lappin said. "Heading home, I saw
that I would have been caught. But the catcher stepped out, and
I read her movement."
The umpires reviewed the call immediately after St. Mary's
challenged the decision, but ultimately let the verdict stand. Mor
ris, Coon and Beardman each went 2 for 4 for the evening. The
Gaels had only three hits in 28 at-bats.
Senior Laura Severson pitched nine complete innings for the
Card, surrendering three hits and two walks while collecting six
strikeouts.
St. Mary's Kate Albaugh hurled six and one-third innings of
relief, allowing five hits with no walks and one strikeout. The
Gaels' starter, Chelsea Loftis, nabbed two strikeouts and gave up
two hits in two innings.
"We came out here with a lot of energy and enthusiasm, but
we couldn't produce offensively," Stanford's head coach John
Rittman said. "We need to do a better job being consistent. We
had too many pop flies, and St. Mary's pitching did a great job
keeping us on our toes."
