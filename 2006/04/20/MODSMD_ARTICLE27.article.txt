# WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
## No sophomore slump for Yim 
### JUSTIN A KAMIEL GRAYMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Injuries are commonplace in sports. But
while 7-foot-1 Shaquille O'Neal can afford
to sit one of 82 regular-season games with an
injured big toe, gymnastics comes with a
shorter season and perhaps more urgency.
Maybe that's why 4-foot-9 gymnast Kerri
Strug was able to endure her leg injury to
win Olympic gold in 1996. Maybe that's why
Stanford women's gymnastics stars Tabitha
Yim and Liz TVicase came back so brilliant
ly from their own damaging injuries.
At age three, sophomore Liz Tricase's
mom felt that a change was in order. The
sight of a little toddler piling up couch
cushions and hurling herself onto them
was just not something that could continue.
And at three and a half years old, soph
omore Tabitha Yim tagged along with her
older brother into the sport that would
change her life.
Yim admits that she was bad when she
started gymnastics, but worked hard at it.
She would even playfully mimic the beam
routine of Olympian Dominique Dawes
on her kid-sized bed.
And when TVicase's coach told her she
was talented, she said "I didn't know what
that meant."
But both THcase and Yim have come
worlds from their stumbling days of begin
ner gymnastics.
Tricase and Yim were members of the
United States National Gymnastics team,
and both tried out for the 2004 US
Olympic Gymnastics Team.
Yim sustained an injury during this crit
ical time, but she definitely does not see

the injury as purely negative. It gave her a
new dimension in family life and. more ob
viously, a break.
"I don't really see my Achilles injury or
not going to the Olympics as being a bad
thing," Yim said. "I got to go on vacation
with my family for the first time."
Tricase also saw the positives in her in
juries last year. In fact, her injuries may
have made her the bar phenom that she is
today.To date, the sophomore has lost only
one meet this season on the apparatus.
"When I was injured. 1 was able to swing
bars the most." said'lVicase, who proclaimed
bars as her worst event at the outset of her
career. Floor was her favorite when she
practiced on the couch cushions,and it is her
favorite now as she practices in Ford Center.
But her forced practice time on bars
brought her something unexpected —
perfection.
"Getting a 10 was definitely one of my
goals. The harder I tried to get a 10, the
harder it was," Tricase said.
But TYicase realized her goal this year.
Three times.
The transition from high school to col
lege for this sophomore duo has proven to
be an amazing one, thanks in part to their
Cardinal teammates.
"I have a life outside gymnastics and a
lot of times I like to share that with my
teammates," TYicase said.
"1 never realized how great it would be
to be a part of a team," Yim added.
Yim,one of the top contenders in the na
tion in the all-around competition, will trav
el to Corvallis, Ore. this week with senior
teammate Natalie Foley to compete in the
NCAA Women's National Championships.
