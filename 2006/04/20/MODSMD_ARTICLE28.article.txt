# MPSFs and NCAAs beckon, but first SJSU
## Last game of season crucial after surprise loss to UCLA 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
With only one regular season
game remaining on their schedule,
the members of the women's water
polo team are gearing up for the
postseason. After being upset last
weekend in southern California by
perennial rival UCLA, the No. 3
Cardinal (18-4,9-2 MPSF) are look
ing to get back on track tomorrow
evening against No. 8 San Jose State
(11-12,5-6).
Despite enduring a heartbreaking
overtime loss to the Bruins, the Stan
ford women still returned home con
fident in the progress they are mak
ing in preparation for the MPSF and
NCAA championship tournaments.
"This game against UCLA tells us
a lot about our team and adds to our
repertoire," junior goalie Meridith
McColl said. "With this experience,
we can learn, refine and change the
minutia so that at the end of our sea
son we will be on top."
Although they trailed by two
going into the half, the Cardinal
fought back to take the lead with
under two minutes left in the final
period. The Bruins, however, coun
tered seconds later to tie the score,
sending the game into overtime.Two
quick goals in the first overtime peri
od put the UCLA women ahead to
stay, as they held off the Stanford at

tack to win 9-8.
"Against the best teams, we have
known what it is like to dominate a
whole game," McColl said. "We have
also known what is like to be ahead
and fall behind. We now know what it
is like to be behind and come back.
The final step is to finish the game off

as our game.
On the road tomorrow versus the
Spartans, the Cardinal will be look
ing to fine-tune their play in both
ends of the pool in anticipation of the
MPSF conference tournament two
weeks from now in Irvine, Calif. The
match will also likely serve as a testa

ment to the many ways in which the
Stanford women have grown as a
group over the course of their 2005
campaign.
"The team has really pulled to
gether over the past couple weeks,"
sophomore driver Megan Nesland
said. "We have found an excellent

balance between the enjoyment of
our sport and teammates, and the
hard work and sacrifices needed to
be a championship team. We have
gotten to the point where everyone
can trust everyone else â€” both in
and out of the pool."
Stanford's contest against San
Jose State will also have a statistical
significance as well. Junior driver
Katie Hansen and freshman driver
Lolo Silver are nearly deadlocked in
the race for the team scoring title.
With two goals against the Bruins
last Saturday, Hansen (40 goals) took
over the scoring lead from the rook
ie Silver (39 goals), who until that
point had paced the Stanford offen
sive.
In the defensive end, McColl (181
saves) needs 10 saves to surpass her
mark of 190 saves last season.
In the end, statistics are the last
thing the Stanford women are con
cerned about. They know that to con
tend for the NCAA title, they will
need to put together their strongest
team efforts of the season. The Car
dinal know that the goal of capturing
the 2006 championship is realistic
and very much within their reach.
But they also know that it is one that
will require every member of their
team to contribute to the best of her
ability in the coming weeks.
"We are continually getting better
and getting closer as a team which is
great," junior two-meter Christina
Hewko said. "But to win NCAAs, we
are still going to have to step it up a
notch and dig a little deeper."
