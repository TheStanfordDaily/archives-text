MASSIS Andre, Sao Paulo, BR
Was lured away from a pretty young
thing and into a heated game of
'Foos' by his good friend Carl —more
commonly known as "The Mayor of
No Women's Land." While Andre made
several attempts to step away and put
himself back into contention with the
said female, Carl's relentless pursuit for
all things that don't involve getting
some, was ultimately too much for the
young Andre. He quickly found himself
sweating it out over the air hockey table,
from where he would catch a glimpse of
his young beauty heading out the door
with another suitor. Andre's game will
be remembered by many, just not her.

NIEVES Fernando, New York, NY
His game was alive and well on its way
to a ten digit exchange with a hottie
known as Britney, but was suddenly
bushwhacked by a classic Gamekiller,
The Drama Queen. She ran into the
scene, tears streaming, and sobbed a
story of having seen her ex from four
years ago. "I, I, I just can't be alone
tonight, Brit." Still a retrievable situation
had Fernando kept his cool. But he
didn't. "Four years seems like a long
time ago," he said in all innocence. By
the time The Drama Queen was done
flipping the script, Fernando was re-cast
in the role of "the villain" in front of a
crowd of horrified on-lookers. No one
hooks up with an insensitive pig. Rest in
peace Fernando, but you sleep alone.
DANIELSON Zack, Atlanta, GA
It was early in the evening yesterday
when Zack's game left us, and while it
didn't go without a fight, Zack did have
his arse unceremoniously handed to
him. Upon returning from the bathroom,

Zack found the girl he was seeing had
been surrounded by a beefy mesomorph,
Early Man, who tried to use his abundant
muscle to strong-arm him out of the
picture. Zack did not keep his cool and
accused his young lady friend of flirting
with the first guy who came along.
His girl, no doubt disgusted by Zack's
over-the-top bravado, fled the scene
when his far from attractive jealousy
escalated into Zack throwing a punch,
which was caught in mid-air by
something that looked like a hand, but
felt like a 201b vice. By the time Zack
re-gained consciousness, he was home
alone and unable to console himself
with his dominant hand.

SHIEH Hanwey, Los Angeles, CA
Hanwey was chatting up a Latin diva at
an apartment complex barbecue and
his game was hot enough to pose a fire
hazard, that is until his friend and cocoon
of horror known as The Mess entered the
picture and snatched Hanwey up like a
flash flood of distraction. Somewhat of
a loose cannon, The Mess immediately
engaged Hanwey in the age-old male
bonding tradition of lighting one's own
farts. Sure, there's little more enticing than
the ignition of one's own combustible
human gasses, but much like riding an
electric scooter, you don't look that cool
doing it. When the laughter subsided,
Hanwey was left with nothing but a
good laugh and the faint smell of old
eggs, while his lady was snared by a
new suitor. Man, talk about blowing it.

KUMAR Bharat, Jacksonville, FL
After kicking his game to a leggy
redhead at a dorm mixer, Bharat was
interrupted by Trevor, a.k.a. British
Accent Guy. Women are drawn to men

Gkm? 2CtU?i>
with British accents, so all it took was a
single "pardon" to make his girl raise
an eyebrow toward this game killing
Redcoat. This prompted Bharat to get
riled by calling out the guy's busted grill
of yellowing bad teeth and comparing
the merits of baseball over cricket. The
British Accent Guy smiled and opened
his mouth only to offer small bits of non
confrontational banter, allowing his
accent to seep into the girl's brain like
a piece of brilliant propaganda. In the
end, the Brit would invade on Bharaf's
territory with ease, taking the girl, and
leaving Bharat's game strewn on the
road as a piece of collateral damage.
SMITH Eric, Washington, DC
His game came to its demise in the
most unlikely of circumstances. While
engaging in two of his most pleasurable
pastimes: talking about boats, with his
other passion, a beautiful girl who
seemed genuinely interested. They were
even planning to go out in his 15-foot
dinghy, only to hit unseen rocks in the
form of The One Upper, the classic
Gamekiller who lives by the motto
"Anything you can do I can do better."
Sure enough, The One Upper claimed
to not only know boats, but he also
boasted of captaining his own 40-foot
vessel. Eric tried to navigate to the
calmer waters of car talk but was
run over again by The One Upper's
supposed vintage German roadster.
The tension quickly mounted, and soon
the two were engaged in a ruthless
game of one-upmanship. On and
on they went, seeing what the other
guy just said and raising him. When
the smoke cleared, Eric had won the
gloat-fest, but the girl was nowhere
to be found. No one likes a braggart.
Eric's game was last seen drifting away
towards the vast sea of loneliness in
an undersized boat.

FOX Jon, London, UK
Jon's game, beloved to many a
cheerleader and facilitator of the
menage of 2003, was fairing well at
a Gold Coast club with a delightful
pair of sisters. That is until the playboy
predator and full time Gamekiller
simply known as Kash Munni entered
the picture. A well-endowed socialite
famous for trashing 5-star hotel rooms,
Kash had traveled in from oil rich lands
wearing expensive Italian loafers and

(Bam? 2CiUrfi
indoor sunglasses. Drinks were bought
for willing and unwilling recipients
alike with his family's fortune, which he
shamelessly flaunted in the form of an
array of high status plastic. This caused
Jon to suddenly lose his cool and go
on the defensive by opening a tab of
his own. On his debit card. After three
rounds, Jon's account was maxed.
Shortly after he was dropped off alone
would Jon learn the hard way that a
woman's affection should never be for
sale, and that many a man has gone
broke trying to prove otherwise.

UTSCH Chad, New Brunswick, NJ
His game was faring nicely at the local
coffee shop with a seemingly receptive
latte drinker called Rita and he seemed
well on his way to a little afternoon delight,
that is until the Gamekiller
known as "IQ" entered picture. This
pompous scholastic scavenger, famous
for luring men into heated debates on
subjects of which they know nothing,
over-heard the conversation turning
to art and pounced. Immediately he
steered the dialogue into an area
known as Out Of Chad's Depth where
he would dish out ever increasing
portions of intellectual emasculation.
Chad reacted as anyone with a 20
point IQ deficit facing "IQ" would: the
wrong way. No, the answer to "When
do you feel Picasso peaked?" isn't to
shove the questioner in the chest. Rita
was left to apologize emphatically for
Chad's actions and asked if she could
make up for it in some way. Chad
tried to recover, but it was too late. He
had lost his cool, and his game would
retire home, where it would begin its
own blue period.

scene, tears streaming, and sobbed a
story of having seen her ex from four
years ago. "I, I, I just can't be alone
tonight, Brit." Still a retrievable situation
had Fernando kept his cool. But he
didn't. "Four years seems like a long
time ago," he said in all innocence. By
the time The Drama Queen was done
flipping the script, Fernando was re-cast
in the role of "the villain" in front of a
crowd of horrified on-lookers. No one
hooks up with an insensitive pig. Rest in
peace Fernando, but you sleep alone.
DANIELSON Zack, Atlanta, GA
It was early in the evening yesterday
when Zack's game left us, and while it
didn't go without a fight, Zack did have
his arse unceremoniously handed to
him. Upon returning from the bathroom,

Zack found the girl he was seeing had
been surrounded by a beefy mesomorph,
Early Man, who tried to use his abundant
muscle to strong-arm him out of the
picture. Zack did not keep his cool and
accused his young lady friend of flirting
with the first guy who came along.
His girl, no doubt disgusted by Zack's
over-the-top bravado, fled the scene
when his far from attractive jealousy
escalated into Zack throwing a punch,
which was caught in mid-air by
something that looked like a hand, but
felt like a 201b vice. By the time Zack
re-gained consciousness, he was home
alone and unable to console himself
with his dominant hand.

SHIEH Hanwey, Los Angeles, CA
Hanwey was chatting up a Latin diva at
an apartment complex barbecue and
his game was hot enough to pose a fire
hazard, that is until his friend and cocoon
of horror known as The Mess entered the
picture and snatched Hanwey up like a
flash flood of distraction. Somewhat of
a loose cannon, The Mess immediately
engaged Hanwey in the age-old male
bonding tradition of lighting one's own
farts. Sure, there's little more enticing than
the ignition of one's own combustible
human gasses, but much like riding an
electric scooter, you don't look that cool
doing it. When the laughter subsided,
Hanwey was left with nothing but a
good laugh and the faint smell of old
eggs, while his lady was snared by a
new suitor. Man, talk about blowing it.

KUMAR Bharat, Jacksonville, FL
After kicking his game to a leggy
redhead at a dorm mixer, Bharat was
interrupted by Trevor, a.k.a. British
Accent Guy. Women are drawn to men

Gkm? 2CtU?i>
with British accents, so all it took was a
single "pardon" to make his girl raise
an eyebrow toward this game killing
Redcoat. This prompted Bharat to get
riled by calling out the guy's busted grill
of yellowing bad teeth and comparing
the merits of baseball over cricket. The
British Accent Guy smiled and opened
his mouth only to offer small bits of non
confrontational banter, allowing his
accent to seep into the girl's brain like
a piece of brilliant propaganda. In the
end, the Brit would invade on Bharaf's
territory with ease, taking the girl, and
leaving Bharat's game strewn on the
road as a piece of collateral damage.
SMITH Eric, Washington, DC
His game came to its demise in the
most unlikely of circumstances. While
engaging in two of his most pleasurable
pastimes: talking about boats, with his
other passion, a beautiful girl who
seemed genuinely interested. They were
even planning to go out in his 15-foot
dinghy, only to hit unseen rocks in the
form of The One Upper, the classic
Gamekiller who lives by the motto
"Anything you can do I can do better."
Sure enough, The One Upper claimed
to not only know boats, but he also
boasted of captaining his own 40-foot
vessel. Eric tried to navigate to the
calmer waters of car talk but was
run over again by The One Upper's
supposed vintage German roadster.
The tension quickly mounted, and soon
the two were engaged in a ruthless
game of one-upmanship. On and
on they went, seeing what the other
guy just said and raising him. When
the smoke cleared, Eric had won the
gloat-fest, but the girl was nowhere
to be found. No one likes a braggart.
Eric's game was last seen drifting away
towards the vast sea of loneliness in
an undersized boat.

FOX Jon, London, UK
Jon's game, beloved to many a
cheerleader and facilitator of the
menage of 2003, was fairing well at
a Gold Coast club with a delightful
pair of sisters. That is until the playboy
predator and full time Gamekiller
simply known as Kash Munni entered
the picture. A well-endowed socialite
famous for trashing 5-star hotel rooms,
Kash had traveled in from oil rich lands
wearing expensive Italian loafers and

(Bam? 2CiUrfi
indoor sunglasses. Drinks were bought
for willing and unwilling recipients
alike with his family's fortune, which he
shamelessly flaunted in the form of an
array of high status plastic. This caused
Jon to suddenly lose his cool and go
on the defensive by opening a tab of
his own. On his debit card. After three
rounds, Jon's account was maxed.
Shortly after he was dropped off alone
would Jon learn the hard way that a
woman's affection should never be for
sale, and that many a man has gone
broke trying to prove otherwise.

UTSCH Chad, New Brunswick, NJ
His game was faring nicely at the local
coffee shop with a seemingly receptive
latte drinker called Rita and he seemed
well on his way to a little afternoon delight,
that is until the Gamekiller
known as "IQ" entered picture. This
pompous scholastic scavenger, famous
for luring men into heated debates on
subjects of which they know nothing,
over-heard the conversation turning
to art and pounced. Immediately he
steered the dialogue into an area
known as Out Of Chad's Depth where
he would dish out ever increasing
portions of intellectual emasculation.
Chad reacted as anyone with a 20
point IQ deficit facing "IQ" would: the
wrong way. No, the answer to "When
do you feel Picasso peaked?" isn't to
shove the questioner in the chest. Rita
was left to apologize emphatically for
Chad's actions and asked if she could
make up for it in some way. Chad
tried to recover, but it was too late. He
had lost his cool, and his game would
retire home, where it would begin its
own blue period.

MASSIS Andre, Sao Paulo, BR
Was lured away from a pretty young
thing and into a heated game of
'Foos' by his good friend Carl —more
commonly known as "The Mayor of
No Women's Land." While Andre made
several attempts to step away and put
himself back into contention with the
said female, Carl's relentless pursuit for
all things that don't involve getting
some, was ultimately too much for the
young Andre. He quickly found himself
sweating it out over the air hockey table,
from where he would catch a glimpse of
his young beauty heading out the door
with another suitor. Andre's game will
be remembered by many, just not her.

NIEVES Fernando, New York, NY
His game was alive and well on its way
to a ten digit exchange with a hottie
known as Britney, but was suddenly
bushwhacked by a classic Gamekiller,
The Drama Queen. She ran into the
scene, tears streaming, and sobbed a
story of having seen her ex from four
years ago. "I, I, I just can't be alone
tonight, Brit." Still a retrievable situation
had Fernando kept his cool. But he
didn't. "Four years seems like a long
time ago," he said in all innocence. By
the time The Drama Queen was done

in the role of "the villain" in front of a
