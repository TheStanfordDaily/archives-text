## Dining garners prestigious Ivy Award 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Dining recently received one of
this year's Restaurants & Institutions Maga
zine's Ivy Awards, a prestigious honor in the
food service industry. Established in 1971 and
given annually, the Ivy Award recognizes op
erations that uphold excellent practices in
three categories: food, service and overall
hospitality.The awards are designed to recog
nize hotels, restaurants and other institutions
for exemplary performance, and are consid
ered by many to be the most distinguished
award in the business.
Each year, previous winners of the Ivy
Award are asked to nominate others in the in
dustry that they believe are worthy of the
honor. According to Rafi Taherian, executive
director of Stanford Dining, the program at
Stanford was nominated because it is known
regionally and nationally as an innovative,
cutting-edge and quality institution.
"Almost all of our dining facilities have
been renovated to platform exhibition-style
cooking; our in-house brands are unique and
distinguished in their identity,"Taherian said.
"We purchase high quality, well-recognized
brand products and we work to increase our
local and organic purchases â€” currently at a
very high level compared to other schools

where some don't even offer this." He added
that Stanford has increased its sustainability
initiatives.
Other Ivy Award 2006 winners include the
Commander's Palace in Las Vegas, mk the
restaurant in Chicago, Boston College, the
Peabody in Orlando and Trattoria dell'Arte
in New York City.These five, along with Stan
ford, will be recognized at an awards ceremo
ny and dinner on May 21 at Chicago's Field
Museum. The celebration coincides with the
National Restaurant Association show and is
expected to draw more than 3(H) attendees.
Once an institution has won the award, they
are inducted into the "Ivy Society" perma
nently.
Taherian also attributes Stanford's success
to co-hosting the National Association of
College and University Food Services region
al conference in 2005/1110 conference lent the
program legitimacy and support from its
peers, he said.
"We use technology to create more effi
ciencies and better use of our services for
students," Taherian explained. "We inte
grate our services with student organiza
tions and we provide support in their activi
ties. We train our staff on an ongoing basis
with the most reputable training organiza
tions such as the Culinary Institute of Amer
ica. Although the services are the same as

that of a very high-quality restaurant, the
prices, however, are not. The objective is to
ensure that students and staff have access to
high-quality food at a very reasonable
price."
Though some students share Taherian's
rosy assessment of Stanford Dining's offer
ings, others expressed differing sentiments.
"It's very hit-or-miss," said freshman
Gwen Luca. "I never kind-of-like the f< tod. 1
either love it or I hate it."
"The food is really good when alumni are
in town." added fellow freshman Chris Mc-
Carty. "If I could eat at the Treehouse every
day. i would."
Taherian answers that Stanford Dining is
weighing criticism and already planning for
the future.
"We will continue to enhance our food,
services, and overall support for sustainabili
ty and green initiatives," he said. "We will con
tinue to further integrate technology so that
our students and guests have real time access
to our menus, recipes, and nutritional infor
mation. We will launch our bio-diesel project
sometime during this summer. We will devel
op new programs to accommodate for
healthy eating habits, wider variety for late
night services, expanded hours of services on
weekends and greater participation in stu
dent activities."
