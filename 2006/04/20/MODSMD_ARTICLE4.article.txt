## Harvard poll shows more students are politically moderate 
### MARIE-JO MONT-REYNAUD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Today's college students are no longer fitting into tra
ditional political categorizations, recent research by Har
vard University's Institute of Politics (IOP) has found.
According to the study. 40 percent of students do not fall
under liberal or conservative labels.
The study — a survey of 1,200 students randomly se
lected from a national database — was composed of 74
questions about issues ranging from religious beliefs to
foreign policy, abortion to education.
Seven out of 10 college students today find religion
somewhat or very important in their lives, the study re
ported. Twenty-five percent say that they have become
more spiritual since they started college.
Dean of Religious Life Scotty McLennan said the
study's conclusions match his experiences on The Farm.
"l find it to be quite consistent
with what 1 believe to be going on at
Stanford and what I also know to be
going on nationally from a study by
the UCLA Higher Education Re
search Institute on spirituality in
higher education," he said. "They
also find that more than 70 percent
of American college students find re
ligion and spirituality to be impor
tant and are concerned about the
moral direction of the country."
Students, for their part, said that
spiritual growth was part of the
greater college experience.
"Of course, most people have be
come more spiritual, but that doesn't
mean they're involved in anything

remotely resembling organized reli
gion," said junior and religious stud
ies major Galen Thompson. "They're
being exposed to new communities
and letting go of their parents' reli
gion. But that's very different than
saying my political views are influ
enced by my religious beliefs."
According to the study, students'
feelings on religion remain firmly di
vided along party lines. Fifty-six per
cent of Republicans want politicians
to discuss religion, while only 21 per
cent of Democrats do, the study
found.
Representatives from campus po
litical groups shared varying reflec
tions on how religious beliefs relate
to politics and their activities on
campus.
Biophysics graduate student
Gilbert Martinez, board member of
the Stanford Democrats, found reli
gious beliefs to be an important fac

tor in politics.
"I think there is a false dichotomy
when there is a discussion of religion
in politics," he said. "Religion is a
means to inform moral value judg
ments. I find it absurd to suggest that
people keep their moral judgments
— religion-based or otherwise —
out of the political sphere. Asking me
to leave my values aside means that I
would have no reason to get involved
politically."
"Religion and morality are not
the same thing," said junior Marie
Jonas, another Democrat board
member. "Democrats don't want to
demonize religion — we'd like to
keep both our religion and govern
ment sacred by keeping them sepa
rate from one another."
According to Megan Reiss, com
munications director for the Stan
ford College Republicans, the trend
toward centrism in college is not sur

prising.
"As long as a person is willing to
listen to others' viewpoints, they will
find that people can make rational
and convincing liberal and conserva
tive arguments," she said.
The study's findings would in
form the College Republicans' ap
proach to politics on campus in com
ing years, Reiss said.
"The College Republicans will be
keeping in mind how many centrists
exist on the college campus," she
said. "Many of our activities will
focus on helping people see rational
ity in our ideology."
While the study seems to suggest
that political campaigns should tar
get the 25 percent of students who
can be classified as "religious cen
trists," Thompson expressed some
doubt about the ability to character
ize religious and political trends on
campus.

"There's enough diversity here
that if I were to try to say that reli
gion is a certain way on campus, I'd
certainly miss the mark," he said.
"College students' beliefs are char
acterized by variability."
While Thompson did not place
much faith in the study's results, he
was still surprised by how many stu
dents self-identified as conserva
tives.
"My father always told me that if
you're a conservative when you're
20, you have no heart," he said. "And
if you're a liberal when you're 40,
you have no head."
Students were split evenly at 40
percent for Senators Hillary Clinton
or John McCain when it came to who
they would support in the 2008 pres
idential election. Twenty percent
said they were unsure.
According to lOP Director
Jeanne Shaheen, politicians should

"take note of the significant num
ber of votes and key swing con
stituency that college students rep
resent for the 2006 and 2008 elec
tions."
The study also found that 66 per
cent of students disapprove of the
job Bush is doing — up 14 percent
from last year. Students also shifted
away from the president on Iraq.
Sixty percent said the U.S. should
begin to withdraw troops from Iraq,
20 percent more than six months ago.
"I'm impressed that college stu
dents agree that the Iraq war and the
response to hurricane Katrina are
important moral issues besides just
the hot button issues such as gay
marriage and abortion," said
McLennan.

According to lOP Director
Jeanne Shaheen, politicians should

"take note of the significant num
ber of votes and key swing con
stituency that college students rep
resent for the 2006 and 2008 elec
tions."
The study also found that 66 per
cent of students disapprove of the
job Bush is doing — up 14 percent
from last year. Students also shifted

Sixty percent said the U.S. should
begin to withdraw troops from Iraq,
20 percent more than six months ago.
"I'm impressed that college stu
dents agree that the Iraq war and the
response to hurricane Katrina are
important moral issues besides just
the hot button issues such as gay
marriage and abortion," said
McLennan.
