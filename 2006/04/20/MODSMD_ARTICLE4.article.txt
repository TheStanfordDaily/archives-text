Today's college students are no longer fitting into tra
ditional political categorizations, recent research by Har
vard University's Institute of Politics (IOP) has found.
According to the study. 40 percent of students do not fall
under liberal or conservative labels.
The study — a survey of 1,200 students randomly se
lected from a national database — was composed of 74
questions about issues ranging from religious beliefs to
foreign policy, abortion to education.
Seven out of 10 college students today find religion
somewhat or very important in their lives, the study re
ported. Twenty-five percent say that they have become
more spiritual since they started college.
Dean of Religious Life Scotty McLennan said the
study's conclusions match his experiences on The Farm.
