## Students claim victory in legal battle over forest Law students celebrate court's ruling against Forest Service 
### GERRY SHIH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Considering it is the same swath of
woodland he has intensively researched,
read and wrote about for the past two se

mesters, second-year law student Craig
Segall seemed unusually energetic as he
described Six Rivers National Forest.
"It's part of a long coast range sloping
into the Pacific," he said excitedly, as his
hand glided horizontally along an invisi
ble, midair contour. "It's wild, pristine
land, thinly settled. There are a lot of old
redwoods, cedars, big firs."
Segall described the 960,000 acres of
national forest in northwestern Califor

nia, a stretch of old conifers and grassy
glades extending from the Oregon bor
der southward for 140 miles. Even after
three 15-page briefs, a court date and sev
eral near-crises, his work has been all
worth it, and Segall has good reason to be
attached to this forest.
Two weeks ago, three Stanford law
students from the Environmental Law
Clinic — third-year student Zach Fabish,
second-year student Aidan McGlaze and

Segall — won a major victory against the
Six Rivers Forest Service in the San Fran
cisco Federal Court. The students, repre
senting the Humboldt County-based En
vironmental Protection Information
Center (EPIC), emerged triumphant in
the latest, and possibly last episode of a
series of courtroom battles between
EPIC and the Forest Service.
According to Fabish and Segall,the National Environ
mental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 requires the govern
ment to publicly disclose environmental impact state
ments and consider alternatives and public input before
any environment-related decision. In the past, a fire sup
pression policy was adopted by the Forest Service —
without public input or impact disclosure.
"Forest fires are supposed to be natural, but for the
past hundred years, they've been suppressed," Segall ex
plained. "The Forest Service's idea was that if you let the
forest go, you could burn down valuable trees that you
could log. When they keep suppressing the fires, brush
and deadwood accumulates, and then you have massive
fires that are out of control."
Fabish added, "You need to let the forest burn. The
question was: how do you get the forest back to its natu
ral state? And how do we revise a century of bad policy?"
In an attempt to force the Forest Service into consid
ering alternatives, EPIC, then represented by a different
group of Stanford law students, took the Forest Service to
court for the first time in September 2003. Although the
court ruled against the Forest Service, it "evaded and
eluded" taking action and exploited ambiguities and
loopholes in the ruling, Segall and Fabish said.
Different students have continued working on the
case since, until the work culminated in an argument in
the federal court last month.The soft-spoken yet percep
tibly confident Fabish — with his thin silver-framed
glasses and blond curtain of shoulder length hair — was
the most experienced student and de facto leader of the
group. He argued before Judge Joseph C. Spero in San
Francisco on March 10.
On April 6, Spero issued an order finding that the Six
Rivers Forest Service failed to comply with its original li
ability ruling and compelled it to release an environmen
tal impact statement for its Fire Management Plan with
in 26 months.
Fabish, Segall and clinical teaching fellow Holly Gor
don all hailed the precedent-setting win for its significant
broader implications, ensuring increased public involve
ment and clout in future policymaking.
In an email to the Law School, Associate Dean of Pub
lic Interest and Clinical Education Larry Marshall wrote
that the students constructed a "novel legal argument"
and called their achievement a "major victory."
Deborah Sivas, the director of the Environmental
Law Clinic, who guided Stanford law students to the first
victory over the Forest Service three years ago, said she
was very pleased with the result.
"Part of the government is showing itself to be anti
public, and a big NEPA victory like this is very impor
tant," she said.
Sivas added that she was proud of how the Law
School's clinical education program has progressed over
the years.
"When the clinics first started we didn't know how to
manage everything," she said. "It's now become a coher
ent program and serves in the dual function of teaching
students as well as helping clients. Our clinical program
has grown to be the finest in the nation."
The students also have come a long way since first tak

ing on the case months ago, beginning with research and
briefs. Fabish, who delivered the final argument, recount
ed the experience of preparing for the court date.
"About two weeks before the argument, it was intense
preparation," he said in his low, humble voice. "There's
nothing more important than preparation. I spent sever
al hours a day studying more cases, reading more docu
ments. I was worried pretty constantly."

In the last few days before court. Segall and McGlaze
supported Fahish as he ran the point, operating on
adrenaline and few hours of sleep a day. Despite his ef
forts to go to bed early, Fabish realized he couldn't sleep
the night of March 9, as his saturated brain hazily jug
gled last-minute review and arguments in the middle of
light slumber.
Ironically, things were easier in front of the judge, who

immediately made his stance clear.
"After the judge said about two sentences, we knew
he was completely on our side," recalled Fabish. "We
just said: 'We agree with you. Your Honor' and I knew I
just had to deliver my argument without any huge blun
ders."
Fabish. who speaks with characteristically deliberate
precision even in interviews, accomplished his task with
panache, and the team was left to wait for one suspense
ful month before the decision was made.
Since then, the students have shown no signs of relax
ing or letting up as they continue the daily grind of law
school, or what Segall called the "12-hour day job."
Fabish filed a new case regarding automobile emissions
on April 6, the day Spero ruled in his favor. ITiough
Fabish is the most experienced student of the three and
speaks with the refined vocabulary expected of a law stu
dent near graduation, he revealed his relative youth as he
reflected on Six Rivers one more time.
"Just to win a case," he started, then paused and
smiled, "feels really cool."

Members of the Environmental Law Clinic, who recently scored a victory for the environment, pose outside the Law School Tuesday. The students argued before a federal
judge in San Francisco about Six Rivers National Forest. They claimed that the federal government violated a 1969 law requiring more public input.

In the last few days before court. Segall and McGlaze
supported Fahish as he ran the point, operating on
adrenaline and few hours of sleep a day. Despite his ef
forts to go to bed early, Fabish realized he couldn't sleep
the night of March 9, as his saturated brain hazily jug
gled last-minute review and arguments in the middle of
light slumber.
Ironically, things were easier in front of the judge, who

immediately made his stance clear.
"After the judge said about two sentences, we knew
he was completely on our side," recalled Fabish. "We
just said: 'We agree with you. Your Honor' and I knew I
just had to deliver my argument without any huge blun
ders."
Fabish. who speaks with characteristically deliberate
precision even in interviews, accomplished his task with
panache, and the team was left to wait for one suspense
ful month before the decision was made.
Since then, the students have shown no signs of relax
ing or letting up as they continue the daily grind of law
school, or what Segall called the "12-hour day job."
Fabish filed a new case regarding automobile emissions
on April 6, the day Spero ruled in his favor. ITiough
Fabish is the most experienced student of the three and

reflected on Six Rivers one more time.

Members of the Environmental Law Clinic, who recently scored a victory for the environment, pose outside the Law School Tuesday. The students argued before a federal
judge in San Francisco about Six Rivers National Forest. They claimed that the federal government violated a 1969 law requiring more public input.
Considering it is the same swath of
woodland he has intensively researched,
read and wrote about for the past two se

mesters, second-year law student Craig
Segall seemed unusually energetic as he
described Six Rivers National Forest.
"It's part of a long coast range sloping
into the Pacific," he said excitedly, as his
hand glided horizontally along an invisi
ble, midair contour. "It's wild, pristine
land, thinly settled. There are a lot of old
redwoods, cedars, big firs."
Segall described the 960,000 acres of
national forest in northwestern Califor

nia, a stretch of old conifers and grassy
glades extending from the Oregon bor
der southward for 140 miles. Even after
three 15-page briefs, a court date and sev
eral near-crises, his work has been all
worth it, and Segall has good reason to be
attached to this forest.
Two weeks ago, three Stanford law
students from the Environmental Law
Clinic — third-year student Zach Fabish,
second-year student Aidan McGlaze and

Segall — won a major victory against the
Six Rivers Forest Service in the San Fran
cisco Federal Court. The students, repre
senting the Humboldt County-based En
vironmental Protection Information
Center (EPIC), emerged triumphant in
the latest, and possibly last episode of a
series of courtroom battles between
EPIC and the Forest Service.
According to Fabish and Segall,the National Environ
mental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 requires the govern
ment to publicly disclose environmental impact state
ments and consider alternatives and public input before
any environment-related decision. In the past, a fire sup
pression policy was adopted by the Forest Service —
without public input or impact disclosure.
"Forest fires are supposed to be natural, but for the
past hundred years, they've been suppressed," Segall ex
plained. "The Forest Service's idea was that if you let the
forest go, you could burn down valuable trees that you
could log. When they keep suppressing the fires, brush
and deadwood accumulates, and then you have massive
fires that are out of control."
Fabish added, "You need to let the forest burn. The
question was: how do you get the forest back to its natu
ral state? And how do we revise a century of bad policy?"
In an attempt to force the Forest Service into consid
ering alternatives, EPIC, then represented by a different
group of Stanford law students, took the Forest Service to
court for the first time in September 2003. Although the
court ruled against the Forest Service, it "evaded and
eluded" taking action and exploited ambiguities and
loopholes in the ruling, Segall and Fabish said.
Different students have continued working on the
case since, until the work culminated in an argument in
the federal court last month.The soft-spoken yet percep
tibly confident Fabish — with his thin silver-framed
glasses and blond curtain of shoulder length hair — was
the most experienced student and de facto leader of the
group. He argued before Judge Joseph C. Spero in San
Francisco on March 10.
On April 6, Spero issued an order finding that the Six
Rivers Forest Service failed to comply with its original li
ability ruling and compelled it to release an environmen
tal impact statement for its Fire Management Plan with
in 26 months.
Fabish, Segall and clinical teaching fellow Holly Gor
don all hailed the precedent-setting win for its significant
broader implications, ensuring increased public involve
ment and clout in future policymaking.
In an email to the Law School, Associate Dean of Pub
lic Interest and Clinical Education Larry Marshall wrote
that the students constructed a "novel legal argument"
and called their achievement a "major victory."
Deborah Sivas, the director of the Environmental
Law Clinic, who guided Stanford law students to the first
victory over the Forest Service three years ago, said she
was very pleased with the result.
"Part of the government is showing itself to be anti
public, and a big NEPA victory like this is very impor
tant," she said.
Sivas added that she was proud of how the Law
School's clinical education program has progressed over
the years.
"When the clinics first started we didn't know how to
manage everything," she said. "It's now become a coher
ent program and serves in the dual function of teaching
students as well as helping clients. Our clinical program
has grown to be the finest in the nation."
The students also have come a long way since first tak

ing on the case months ago, beginning with research and
briefs. Fabish, who delivered the final argument, recount
ed the experience of preparing for the court date.
"About two weeks before the argument, it was intense
preparation," he said in his low, humble voice. "There's
nothing more important than preparation. I spent sever
al hours a day studying more cases, reading more docu
ments. I was worried pretty constantly."
