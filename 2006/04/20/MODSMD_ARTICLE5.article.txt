## Students claim victory in legal battle over forest Law students celebrate court's ruling against Forest Service 
### GERRY SHIH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Considering it is the same swath of
woodland he has intensively researched,
read and wrote about for the past two se

mesters, second-year law student Craig
Segall seemed unusually energetic as he
described Six Rivers National Forest.
"It's part of a long coast range sloping
into the Pacific," he said excitedly, as his
hand glided horizontally along an invisi
ble, midair contour. "It's wild, pristine
land, thinly settled. There are a lot of old
redwoods, cedars, big firs."
Segall described the 960,000 acres of
national forest in northwestern Califor

nia, a stretch of old conifers and grassy
glades extending from the Oregon bor
der southward for 140 miles. Even after
three 15-page briefs, a court date and sev
eral near-crises, his work has been all
worth it, and Segall has good reason to be
attached to this forest.
Two weeks ago, three Stanford law
students from the Environmental Law
Clinic — third-year student Zach Fabish,
second-year student Aidan McGlaze and

Segall — won a major victory against the
Six Rivers Forest Service in the San Fran
cisco Federal Court. The students, repre
senting the Humboldt County-based En
vironmental Protection Information
Center (EPIC), emerged triumphant in
the latest, and possibly last episode of a
series of courtroom battles between
EPIC and the Forest Service.
