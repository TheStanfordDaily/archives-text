## Clinics merge, bring free local health care 
### ADAM WIDMAN STAFF WRITER 
TWo nonprofit clinics that pro
vide important services to low-in
come area residents are set to
merge. School of Medicine Dean
Philip Pizzo will announce today
the formation of the Cardinal Free
Clinics from the Arbor Free Clinic
in Menlo Park and the Pacific Free
Clinic in San Jose. Both employ
Medical School students to pro
vide uninsured and underinsured
clients with a wide array of servic
es.
The two clinics were joined so

that they could save funds by shar
ing staff and equipment, and possi
bly develop stronger fund-raising
efforts. Both clinics have faced in
creasing demand and scarce fund
ing over the past few years, said
Lars Osterberg, medical director
for the Arbor Free Clinic.
"Obtaining funding for the clin
ics became difficult in the last few
years, and Arbor Free Clinic has
been forced to scale back some of
its services," Osterberg said. "Join
ing will allow the clinics to ex
change and improve fund-raising
strategies, and conserve funds by
sharing equipment and man-power."
Osterberg said that he and others
had been planning a business strate
gy for the two clinics since the begin
ning of the academic year, and the
decision to merge the two clinics was
approved by Pizzo on Feb. 10.
He added that the merger was a
logical choice given the similarity
between the clinics and the popula
tions they serve.
"Since we approach the same
foundations and generally serve the
same patient population, we hope
that in joining forces we will not be
competing for funds, but working to
gether to be more effective in
fundraising together," Osterberg
said. "One of the things we do best is
utilize existing Stanford resources to
provide necessary services to the

community.
While the merger will provide
both clinics with an opportunity to
conserve resources, the Cardinal
Free Clinics hope to also expand the
current services offered. Osterberg
said that Arbor will soon purchase
equipment to provide patients with
orthopedic care and physical thera
py-
The two facilities currently pro
vide differing services. Osterberg
said that the Arbor Free Clinic spe
cializes in urgent care and is for
drop-in patients only. The Pacific
Free Clinic is more involved in con
tinuous care.
Bory Kea, student manager of
the Pacific Free Clinic, listed servic
es that the clinic provides outside of
drop-in care.
"In addition to providing ultra
sounds. Pacific Free Clinic also of
fers a gynecology clinic, dental
screening and referral clinic, nutri
tionist on-site, vision-screening and
diabetes management classes for
Spanish speaking patients," Kea

said.
The combined clinics will soon
exchange some of their services. For
example, the Arbor free clinic has
transferred its ultrasound service to
the Pacific Free Clinic.
Osterberg noted that the com
bined clinics should continue to help
the community while providing
medical school students with valu
able training.
"Our patients are never charged
anything when coming to the clinics,
yet the Cardinal Free Clinics are
providing care for over 2,(M)() pa
tients a year at a minimal budget by
leveraging many resources within
the Stanford Community and the
local community to provide medical
care to the underserved," he said.
"At the same time [medical] stu
dents are getting a valuable educa
tion. Both the community and the
students benefit."
Both clinics are open on week
ends only. They will have a com
bined budget ranging between
$ 1 (K).(KK) to $2()().()(H).
