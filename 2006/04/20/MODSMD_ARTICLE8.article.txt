## GSC members debate the new health benefit change 
### BEN EPPLER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Graduate Student Council
members debated the state of de
pendent healthcare, passed a Judi
cial Charter amendment and ap
proved $2,355 worth of funding for
student groups at their meeting last
night in the Graduate Community
Center.
After approving funding re
quests from the Society of Industri
al and Applied Mathematics for a
research presentation fair for $500,
the GSC also gifted $355 to the Sci
ence and Engineering Graduate
Women's Association to bring MIT

Biology Prof. Nancy Hopkins to
speak on faculty diversity. Later,
the group also approved a $1,500
request from the Graduate Stu
dent Programming Board for two
spring barbeques organized in co
operation with The 750 pub.
The GSC discussed the end of
dependent health care, which will
take effect for grad students this
September. According to Kate
Phillippo, doctoral student in Edu
cation and member of the Vaden
Student Insurance Committee,
Stanford has elected to discontinue
the program, citing high rates and
costs. The change will strip healthcare from
approximately 110 spouses and children of
graduate students.
Matt Andrews, graduate student in edu
cation, explained that costs for the plan had
risen significantly in recent years, causing
many families to seek private health insur
ance. For other families, especially those
whose dependents have health problems,
finding an affordable alternative is impossi
ble, he added.
"I don't feel so bad when it's a 22-year old
college student," he said, "but I feel terrible
when it's a kid."
A former GSC member — who declined
to identify himself for fear of retribution —
remembered when graduate students fought
a skillful public relations campaign against a
similar proposal by the University five years
ago to discontinue the program or raise rates
63 percent.
"Those of us who were on the GSC at the
time were horrified, nauseated, at this
change," he recalled.
Ultimately, the University decided to
maintain dependent health care without
raising fees dramatically, he said. However,
he acknowledged that the group that would
have been affected by those suggested
changes was at least four times the size of the
current number of dependents in the pro
gram.
GSC members discussed options for deal
ing with the current campus healthcare crisis,
noting that funding for maintaining the pro
gram needed to come from somewhere.
"In [the University's] opinion, it's not
economical," said Funding Officer Stephen

Hunt, a graduate student in the School of
Medicine, agreeing with the University's po
sition on the dependent healthcare program.
Hunt said that campus healthcare
providers are committed to helping depend
ents find other means of insurance, citing
Vaden Health Center's recommendation for
Healthy Kids, an insurance program for low
income children from birth to 18.
Regardless, the GSC acknowledged that
they needed to address the problem.
"It's the expense that's rising the fastest,"
said GSC Co-chair Tom Lee, a fourth-year
doctoral candidate in electrical engineering.
"We need to get on it."
The group then unanimously approved a
Judicial Charter amendment altering the
language of the Rights of the Accused to
clarify that a student can be accused of vio
lating the Fundamental Standard and specif
ic policies for a single crime, but if found
guilty of both, "the Panel will not issue com
pounded sanctions inconsistent with the Stu
dent Conduct Penalty Code."
The group also approved a bill commem
orating the 100 th anniversary of the San
Francisco Earthquake, pledging to promote
student awareness of earthquake safety. The
bill passed 8-1-1, despite one member's ob
jection that it was "a waste of time."
The GSC discussed the transition to next
year's council, which will take place on May
3. In the coming weeks, the outgoing body
must approve a budget for the 2006-2007
year before handing over power to the new
regime. New councilmembers must also vie
for positions such as chair, deputy chair and
GSC webmaster in the next two weeks.
