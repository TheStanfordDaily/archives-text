[58% Diversion I
The University's diversion numbers are in for 2005! Of all the solid waste
that we created 011 the campus, we were able to divert 58% of it away from
the landfill and into another beneficial use. We reduced the amount of
trash going to the landfill by 2% over last year. We are still on an upward
trend in reducing and recycling waste on campus. In all, we diverted
3900 tons of paper, glass, metal, and plastics, 5300 tons of organics
including 1100 tons of food waste, 200 tons of e-scrap, and 3100 tons of
construction waste. Thank you for participating in the recycling program
on campus. You are making a difference!
