### LESLIE GEORGATOS STAFF WRITER 
How to incorporate the arts into a 21st centu
ry curriculum was the crux of yesterday's Acade
mic Council meeting, where President John Hen
nessy gave his yearly address in Cubberley Audi
torium.
After Faculty Senate Chair Eric Roberts, pro
fessor of computer science, called the meeting to
order and delivered his report on the Faculty Sen
ate for 2(X)5-2(H)6,1 lennessy delivered his report.
The statement dealt extensively with the im
portance of the arts to Stanford and its student
body.
Hennessy quoted Stanford's first president,
David Starr Jordan, on the arts:"The imagination
needs to be cultivated and developed to assure
success in life. A man will never construct anything
he cannot conceive."
After Hennessy spoke, Profs. Eavan Boland,

David Kelley and Kris Samuelson spoke in a panel
discussion entitled "A Cultured and Useful Citi
zenry:The Role of Creativity and the Arts in a 21 st
Century Education." The professors addressed
the role of each of their concentrations in the Uni
versity community — creative writing, engineer
ing design and film, respectively.
The panelists confronted issues about the place
of their specific curricula in relation to other areas
of study.
"A University has the right to ask a Creative
Writing Program, what exactly do you do?"
Boland said. "What do you do in and for Stanford?
When we think about what we do, we think prima
rily that we stand at the entrance, in the gateway of
education itself.
"We are part of the promissory note given to a
Stanford student," she continued. "We are part of
the guarantee that they will not have to give up
their dreams of expression, their hopes for excel
lence, their determination to put their life into lan
guage when they come to a University. We stand
with the University when we advocate to them
that wherever they go — into the sciences, into
mathematics or physics, Humßio — those dreams
can follow them and become actuality."
