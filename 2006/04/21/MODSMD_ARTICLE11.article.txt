# SPEAKER EVENT
## EU. will act as uniting force in future 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
The Honorable Joschka Fischer, a renowned
German politician, addressed a full house in the
Bechtel Conference Center yesterday afternoon
with his lecture entitled "Europe's Prospects in a
Globalized World." exploring the challenges Eu
rope faces in the 21st century and the increasing
importance of the European Union.
The Freeman Spogli Institute for Internation
al Studies, directed by Coit Blacker, professor of
political science by courtesy, sponsored the lec
ture. In his introduction. Blacker summarized
Fischer's involvement in the German govern
ment, including such positions as minister for the
environment in Hessen. minister of foreign af
fairs and member of the Bundestag, the lower
German parliament.
In his lecture, Fischer advocated for the in
creasing unification of Europe and a strengthen
ing of the European Union. He stressed main
taining a good relationship between Europe and
the United States and argued that increasing
"political globalization" will be the only way to
effectively address global problems such as the
energy crisis and environmental deterioration.
Fischer divided the challenges
Europe faces into three major cate
gories: history, neighborhood and
globalization. Due to its divided
past, Fischer called the enlargement
of the E.U. one of Europe's great
success stories, stressing that this
unification has not come without a
struggle.
"We need to create a completely
new mindset," he said, deeming this

task the most challenging one for
today's Europe.
This European integration
"brings up an important question,"
Fischer said. "Where does Europe
begin and where does Europe end?"
While oceans provide obvious
borders on the north, west and
south, the eastern border is subject
to a political decision. Fischer
touched on the difficulties Europe
faces because of its location, meshed
in between Russia, Africa and the
Middle East.
Although Fischer did not appear
to think Russia should be included in
the E.U., he stressed that it is "too big

to be isolated" and warned that ig
noring the country would be "foolish
and dangerous." He seemed more
concerned about security threats
from Africa and the Middle East,
however, saying, "when Africa ex
ports its conflicts, Europe will be ad
dress number one."
In one of his more pessimistic mo
ments, Fischer expressed the urgent
need for a more unified E.U. with a
constitution, parliament and presi
dency to face the serious challenge
posed by the Middle East. He said
that the E.U. shouldn't be enlarged
without institutional reform, saying,
"maybe Europeans need another

lesson from history.
"At least theoretically, the United
States has the option to say goodbye
to the Middle East, to decide that re
gion is less important," Fischer said.
"Europe doesn't have that option."
Finally, Fischer addressed global
ization and the shift in mentality that
must accompany the increasingly in
ternational markets.
"If you look at post-iyB9 Europe,
you will see an ongoing revolution
without a single shot fired," Fischer
said. He said enlargement of the E.U.
is part of the answer because it opens
the common market, importing
economies rather than people to

stimulate healthy economic growth.
Looking out for the welfare of
everyone will be crucial in address
ing problems in the future. Fischer
said. As the global economic situa
tion shifts with the growth of the
economics of China and Indiana new
balance of power or another arms
race will not be effective in solving
global problems like the shortage of
energy sources or environmental
pollution.
Fischer said Europe today is a
good example for how to create insti
tutions to avoid conflicts and face the
challenges of this century. He said
the big question is whether these

challenges will disunite Europe and
the United States, or whether we will
have the "strategic wisdom" to work
things out and cooperate.
Dirk Balfanz, a local citizen from
Palo Alto who grew up in Germany
but has lived in the United States for
the past decade, said he enjoyed the
talk, calling Fischer an "illustrious
figure in Germany and a popular
politician."
Ursula Meier, another listener
who has disagreed with Fischer in the
past, commented on the power of his
t;ilk.
"He won me over," she said. "He
is a really convincing politician."
