Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations
Riyad Mansour to campus for a talk about the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict and also receiving
the Dean's Achievement Award for promoting
awareness about Middle Eastern politics.
Mansour's speech argued how the actions of
Israel violated international security protocol
and human rights laws as he pushed for its pos
itive cooperation. He opened by discussing his
involvement with the Israel-Palestine conflict.
"I have spent 17 years doing things related to
the UN, from the mid 70s to 1W4," he said.
"After that, I left public office and entered the
business sector and legal field, where I worked
as a consultant. During that time I also taught at
the University of Central Florida."
