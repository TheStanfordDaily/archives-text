## U.N. affiliate urges Israeli cooperation Palestinian Ambassador slams US. for pampering Israel 
### ANURADHA SIVARAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last night was a double fete for Stanford's
Coalition for Justice in the Middle East
(CJME) â€” bringing renowned Palestinian
Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations
Riyad Mansour to campus for a talk about the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict and also receiving
the Dean's Achievement Award for promoting
awareness about Middle Eastern politics.
Mansour's speech argued how the actions of
Israel violated international security protocol
and human rights laws as he pushed for its pos
itive cooperation. He opened by discussing his
involvement with the Israel-Palestine conflict.
"I have spent 17 years doing things related to
the UN, from the mid 70s to 1W4," he said.
"After that, I left public office and entered the
business sector and legal field, where I worked
as a consultant. During that time I also taught at
the University of Central Florida."
His work ultimately led him to
the position of permanent observer
of Palestine for the U.N. in Septem
ber, which he accepted.
"1 am starting the post during a
unique, possibly very difficult time,"
he explained. "1 want to share with
you how the last three weeks in
volved debates with the Security
Council."
Mansour began by detailing the
recent trail of political events that
have exacerbated tension in the
contested territory, including ag
gression by Israeli militants, exten
sive policy debates during the U.N.
open session held on March 30 and
a meeting of the Arab League in
Khartoum, Sudan, asking for the re
invigoration of the Arab Peace Ini
tiative. All of the efforts to cool off
the heat and push forward the
Palestinian agenda were unsuccess
ful, he said.
Mansour argued that Israel con
tinues to operate under a unilateral
"no partner mantra," using allegedly
illegitimate means to control disput
ed territory. He said that their tactics
will be "the end of the two-state
solution and will result in a series of
Bantustans." He extended his simile,

comparing the Palestinian struggle
for independence to the South
African movement to overthrow
apartheid, citing a litany of crimes
against Palestinians committed by
Israeli government and military
forces and arguing that Israel was
"collectively punishing" innocent
civilians, including women and chil
dren.
Mansour closed by arguing that
Israel must begin to respond posi
tively to the call for peace and end
aggression against the Palestinian
people.
"Palestinians deserve their own
independent Palestinian state with
East Jerusalem as the capital, ac
cording to 1%6 borders," he said.
Calling for the international com
munity to fully respect the "inalien
able rights" of Palestinians, Mansour
focused particularly on the United
States, which he criticized as "spoil
ing" Israel and blocking important
peace resolutions at Middle East
summits.
The ambassador was greeted by a
solid audience of students and com
munity members. Freshman
Shahrzad Zarafshar enjoyed the
speech and praised its sponsor.
"CJME brings very renowned
speakers to campus," she said. "I'm
also very interested in the questions
that students ask: sometimes they
are more interesting than the speak
ers themselves."
