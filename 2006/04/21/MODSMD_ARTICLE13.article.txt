Palo Alto doesn't offer much when it comes to
health and ecology conscious eateries. Unfor
tunately, the Bay Leaf Cafe's attempt to fill
this void doesn't quite cut it compared to the inno
vative and delicious dining experiences I have en
joyed at truly great vegan restaurants. The Bay
Leaf Cafe gets points for making the attempt (those
great vegan restaurants I've known aren't any
where nearby). Its use of fresh, organic produce is
wonderful. Although starting with these great in
gredients offers the opportunity for creating a to
die-for meal, the Bay Leaf Cafe's limited menu fails
to capture the exceptional flavors that can result
from innovative applications of organic and vegan
food.
The small, down-to-earth, white adobe-walled
restaurant suffers from an overdose of 'keeping it
simple", especially in its almost nonexistent salad de
partment. The Bay Leaf Cafe surprisingly offers only
one monotonous salad ($4.00) which consists of
nothing more than a bed of baby greens with two
teeny tomato slices. The restaurant's two soups are
yellow lentil and curried carrot ($3.80 - small, $5.60 -
large). I tried the curried carrot, which had a pleas
ant, mild flavor.
Basic vegetarian sandwiches and wraps make up
the remainder of the menu, from an avocado and
tomato sandwich to a hummus, romaine, red cab
bage, and tomato wrap. It was disappointing to find
that still in a health food restaurant, less-than
healthy white flour was a staple for much of the
menu — the wraps came in flour tortillas and the
sandwiches came on sourdough. Still. I was unex
pectedly impressed by an extensive array of non
dairy desserts. The black rice sundae ($4.50) was
quite good - I could have sworn that the whipped
cream was real! My meal would have ended on this
positive note, had not inattentive service, which was
apparent throughout the evening, required my
friend to flag down the waitperson for the check.
My feeling on is that the Bay Leaf Cafe seems to
be stuck in the health food of my mother's youth, be
fore the health food movement discovered that veg
ans could have fun with food too! If you are craving
the classic hippie experience, the Bay Leaf Cafe de
livers. In other words, if you are dying to find a place
with vegan desserts, a wall of environmentalist liter
ature, and free wireless internet access (ok, maybe
not so classic, but its definitely a plus) and you crave
only lentil soup and a hummus and veggie wrap, the
Bay Leaf Cafe is the place to be. If you want more
excitement than a hummus and veggie wrap, you
need to keep looking.
