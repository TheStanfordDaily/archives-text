## NEWS CONTINUED 
### JENNY BAER DESK EDITOR 
You may have succeeded in finding an in
ternship away from home this summer, hut if
you're like most of this campus you've also
procrastinated in planning where you're going
to live, what you're going to eat or how you're
going to get around. You might be interested
in a new website that, according to founder
Francis Larkin combines aspects of The Face
book, Craigslist and Evite to help college stu
dents connect in planning their summer lodg
ing in an unfamiliar area.

Intern Nation.com was created specifically
for interning college students seeking housing,
room-mates or other interns in the area. Ser
vices are also available for students who wish
to rent their housing out to another student
while they are completing an internship.
For example, say you find a summer intern
ship in Chicago. There's a student who goes to
Northwestern who has an internship in New
York City and someone in New York City who
is conducting research at Stanford. If you live
off campus and have housing you need to sub
let anyway, then there's potential for students
to sublet to one another.
"Interns have unique housing needs," said

Larkin. "It has to be cheap, location is impor
tant because a lot of college kids might not
have cars, and you really need furniture. Wher
ever you live, you don't want to bring all your
belongings to Chicago for three months."
Intern Nation differs from craigslist in that
future interns can search for housing organ
ized by zipcode and by whether the person at
tends their school.
"If you find housing on craigslist, it's prob
ably going to be a 35-year-old woman who has
a spare bedroom in her house." noted Larkin.
In addition to finding other students, In
tern Nation users can also search for activities
and social groups for the three or so months

they are away. If you're interning in Seattle this
summer and you're into golf, then you can reg
ister at Intern Nation.com as somebody who
will be living in Seattle and likes to play golf.
Larkin, a recent Notre Dame graduate,
came up with the idea for Intern Nation while
interning in Brussels.
"I was living in the French quarter and 1
didn't speak any French, making the first cou
ple of weeks tough. Things turned when a
friend of a friend knew another friend from
Notre Dame who was in Belgium. It turned
out that there were six Notre Dame kids in
Belgium. This is not an isolated circumstance.
You get an internship in, say, Omaha, it's going

to be frustrating in Nebraska-hut there are
going to be other Stanford kids in Omaha."
Intern Nation started last summer
solely in the Notre Dame community and
opened to 130 schools just a few weeks ago.
Right now, just under 300 students have regis
tered, but growth is expected based on Intern-
Nation's recent press and fact that 23 career
centers have recently registered to promote
the site to their students.
If successful. Intern Nation hopes to devel
op another portion of the site in which stu
dents can share their prior interning experi
ences and advice for various internships and
cities.
