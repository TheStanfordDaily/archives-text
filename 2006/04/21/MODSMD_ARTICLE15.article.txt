## Editorial Taking concrete steps to save the environment 
### 
Tomorrow is Earth Day — a day for
the conservationists among us to cel
ebrate the environment, a day for the
apathetic to question whether throwing
that soda can in the recycling bin is really
going to save the Earth. But Stanford stu
dents need to look at the issue of helping
the environment with a twofold perspec
tive. On one hand, it won't hurt to throw
that draft the printer messed up in the recy
cling bin. But on the other hand, we need to
make sure that the more substantial efforts
we make to help the environment actually
do something.
The University is certainly taking steps
to implement more environmentally friend
ly practices. It has installed low-flush toilets
and low-flow shower heads in residences, as
well as sensor-activated lights in common
areas such as the libraries. There is a recy
cling bin in each and every dorm room. And
perhaps most excitingly, the Department of
Civil Engineering is working on a Green
Dorm project that promises to push the
boundaries of sustainable living.
But students must not let an environmen
tally friendly attitude slide into a reflexive
commendation of each project aiming to im
prove it. Many efforts are much more pro
ductive than others. On a larger scale, donat
ing money to help preserve irreplaceable
Brazilian rainforest, for example, can do a lot
more to help the environment than subsidiz
ing unprofitable recycling programs, thereby
reducing incentives to plant new trees. And
while we commend Stanford Dining, for ex
ample. has purchased more organic produce
from local farms and works with students on
maintaining an organic garden, we also urge
students to find out for themselves organic
food's benefits and drawbacks, like costing
money that otherwise could have been used
for reducing meal plan costs or increasing
workers' wages.
We believe that if students learn the facts
about sustainability efforts, they can have a
more authentic appreciation of the positive
effects of environmental consciousness.
However, a large'*poftidfi of the student
body remains skeptical of the efficacy of
these efforts, and unaware of the ongoing
environmental efforts happening on cam
pus. It's difficult for most students to con
ceive of the large-scale benefits these small
scale practices can reap, because these ben
efits are dispersed. It's hard to picture how

our behaviors affect the intricate workings
of our environment.
Nevertheless, we believe that we can take
active steps to reduce our environmental
footprints. What this campus needs is a more
unified way to coordinate such efforts.
Stanford should create a more coherent
structure to implement new sustainable
measures and to support existing ones. To
that end, the Editorial Board sincerely
hopes that creating an Office of Sustainabil
ity will go a long way in coordinating and
supporting current environmental efforts.
This is not unique; Yale already has such an
office, and several other institutions are
looking to establish one. We'd hate to see
Stanford left behind.
With a central administrative body to
promote and ensure the impact of green
practices, individual students, professors
and student groups would no longer have to
fight sporadic battles to champion environ
mentally-friendly practices like recycling
paper or saving energy. Environmental
classes, lectures and events would be better
funded and publicized. However, the suc
cessful implementation of such measures
depends on the collective efforts of stu
dents, academic departments and the ad
ministration.
Also, it is important for the Stanford
community to research and develop innova
tive new ways to save the environment.
While projects like the Green Dorm may be
costly, they offer numerous opportunities to
students and form the foundation for other
creative and sustainable solutions in the fu
ture. We should not view such projects as
token environmental efforts, or support
them because they are grouped under the
label "environmentally friendly," but in
stead learn for ourselves the long-term ef
fects such projects could bring about and
make an informed decision to support
them.
To the skeptics out there, all this rhetoric
may seem empty and idealistic. This Earth
Day, we encourage you not to worry about
whether tossing that one soda can into the
recycling bin will save the world. Instead, go
to the Earth Day events on campus and
learn about practical methods and real envi
ronmental effects of sustainable living ef
forts at Stanford. And that one soda can
might not make a difference — but 10 mil
lion soda cans certainly do.
