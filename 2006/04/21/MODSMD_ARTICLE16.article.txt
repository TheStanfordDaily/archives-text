# How fast they grow

It's time for me to finally admit the truth:
My name is Nav and I am an educator.
Yes, that's right. I've been openly shaping
young minds each quarter since arriving at
Stanford — though what I've shaped them
into would probably be a point of some de
bate.
Luckily I've spent years practicing a pa
trician air and a supercilious sneer, so de
spite my general dislike of young people I
haven't found it too difficult to fall into the
teaching profession.
Mostly those benefiting from my instruc
tion have been passing through the heady
world of physics on a journey to the some
what sunnier (and better remunerated)
climes of engineering. These folks 1 rarely
see again. And, if I do bump into them, I
hope my patrician air still counts for some
thing.
However, back before I scored my cur
rent gig as the overlord of the Physics 40 se
ries I spent a quarter teaching a more ad
vanced class, aimed squarely at would be
physics majors. Now these kids, well they've
come back to haunt me.
You know that scene in Star Wars when
Vader and Obi-Wan face off? Vader's line
keeps bouncing around inside my head
every time I see the children around the de
partment:
"We meet again, at last. The circle is now
complete. When I met you I was but the
learner. Now, I am the master."
Of course none of the kids are truly Dark
Lords of the Sith (except maybe Flip). And
none of them have actually tried to strike me
down (though I can see it in their eyes). Still,
they are making me feel a little (more) inse
cure.
I always pictured graduate school as that
time in my life when I would cast off the
shackles that bind the student for the robes
that decorate the master. I foresaw a time
when I could finally feel competent; no,
more than competent, I was looking forward
to feeling superior.
This is the big draw of teaching. What
with the constant battering at the hands of
your research advisor, the struggle for su
premacy amongst your compatriots and
the ever-increasing sense of inadequacy.

teaching is about the only opportunity you
have to feel like you know more than the
other people in the room, to feel that your
years of education have actually given you
something.
All of which means that when the little
runts start to push past your boundaries of
knowledge, it's a double kick in the teeth —
not only is one more shortcoming highlight
ed, but a source of reassurance is also taken
away.
In a broader sense this is inevitable: as the
expanse of what should be known opens up
before you there will undoubtedly be patch
es that someone else gets to first. It's galling,
however, when those someone elses turn out
be the very people you've helped on their in
tellectual journey.
No longer can one steel oneself to the
taste of failure with the reassurance that per
haps it doesn't matter that you don't know
something yet, for there's always more time.
Instead, you're left desperately groping
around for every wisp of knowledge from a
subject that, rather than opening itself up to
you, is instead drifting out of reach.
The sinking feeling that you will never
command all the academic peaks you want
ed to, and that those younger and newer than
you will, is not necessarily a bad thing. After
all, if such a thing weren't true we would be
condemned to relative ignorance until all
those who came before were dead. And then
who could we impress?
What's more, the precocious undergrads
I've been complaining about are on their
way out. Seniors to a man, they're off to
graduate school in the fall; and so, even dur
ing my bitterest moments. I can still bring
forth a smile by contemplating the wonder
ful new adventure that awaits them.
