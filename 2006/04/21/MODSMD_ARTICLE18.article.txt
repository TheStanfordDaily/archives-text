# Look! Over there! A Pro Fro!
## 
### 
Shhh! Look — a Pro Fro! You can tell by
the red folder and the dewy-eyed high
school innocence. Careful: don't make
any sudden movements. You might scare it. It
might flee to an intricately planned barbecue
or Taiko performance. Marvel at them while
you can. Their arrival is a once-yearly occur
rence of great significance, like the return of
the swallows to Capistrano or the mating of
the California grunion.
I don't think I'm alone in finding ProFros
intriguing, like the mystery object in a Cu
riosity Shop. It's not just their youth, al
though the lure of a statutory rape charge is
titillating. It's not their fresh-faced admira
tion for all things Stanford, either, an admira
tion that extends outward to encapsulate
Floover Tower and the sculpture garden and,
yes, even you and me — like Kurtz in the jun
gle, we hold a great power over their mal
leable minds.
No, what's most interesting about the
ProFros is their earnestness. They are step
ping into the big, wide world, and they are ex
cited for it. Sure, there are a few hardened ap
ples in their midst, the kind of kids that spent
their high school weekends snorting lines off
the gleaming hood of Daddy's Escalade. But
by and large they are free of disillusionment.
Their lives are changing, and doors are open

ing. Who knows what lies ahead?
Warning: I'm about to quote James Joyce.
This is something I virtually forswore at the
start of my tenure as a columnist. Okay, stop
your groaning. It's not as bad as you think —
it's a quote from a letter, not one of his lofty
tomes.
"What makes most people's lives unhap
py is some disappointed romanticism, some
unrealized or misconceived ideal. In fact you
may say that idealism is the ruin of man. and
if we lived down to fact, as primitive man had
to do, we would be better off."
A tricksy truth for to-be freshmen. Grow
ing into adulthood means seeing your child
ish ideals shattered, and a lot of growing up
happens during college. I remember during
Pro Fro weekend sitting in on a how-to panel
for winning brand-name scholarships like the
Rhodes, Marshall, and Truman. I walked out

pledging myself to an undergraduate career
focused on earning my own illustrious lau
rels.
Mr. Rhodes hasn't come calling yet. (Per
haps too busy pillaging Africa?)
Don't get disheartened, though. 1 don't
mean to be the harbinger of bad news. Even
if growing up comes with a dose of cynicism,
it has its upsides. In college, many of you will
bone down and booze up for the first time.
You'll become a better thinker, learn useless
intellectual factoids about Aristotelian phi
losophy, and make some friends that will last
you your whole life. You may even walk out
with a high-paying job (if you're willing to
work 90-hour weeks on Wall Street).
But while you're here (or wherever you
end up), treat college for what it is: a four
year vacation. There are challenges and hard
work along the way, but college is absolutely
amazing. Remind yourself that it's the last
time in life you'll have your summers and
holidays off,get to sleep in past 10, and live in
a coed wonderland of post-adolescent peers.
Hopefully you'll decide to vacation here
at Camp Stanford. We even have a lake.
