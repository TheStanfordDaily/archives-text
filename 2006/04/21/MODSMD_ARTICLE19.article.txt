The SOCC replies to editorial
On Monday, the Editorial Board criticized
the Students of Color Coalition (SOCC) as a
"detractor of the electoral process" and at
worst, a "blight" ("The SOCC: A blight on the
democratic process?", Apr. 17). The argument
of the Board and Barrett Sheridan's column
("What really counts", Apr. 14) operate on a
faulty logic that is at once limited in its scope
and misinformed. It makes certain assump
tions about both the nature of the SOCC can
didate endorsement process and the motives
of our organization. This perpetuates a type of
racial logic that implicates students of color as
an undifferentiated and oppositional group re
acting against some hegemonic white majority,
angry for the sake of being angry.
Both pieces accuse the SOCC of over-rep
resenting certain groups in its endorsements,
and under-representing others, which it per
ceives to be a result of inter-group politics.
Such an accusation is based on a conceptual
ization of ethnic communities as easily sepa
rable and without overlap. It is reflective of a
logic based on the belief that people only care
about the issues that affect the communities
of which they are members. One must be
wary of drawing linear connections between

biology and belief, skin-tone and political
views. Such a view compartmentalizes indi
viduals and communities into neat categories
and also presupposes that, for example, an
Asian American must care about Asian
American issues and could not possibly care
about the concerns of other communities.
Contrary to these presuppositions, there
are many students on this campus who are
concerned about student-of-color issues, yet
do not identify as students of color. We also
feel that just because a candidate is not
SOCC-endorsed does not mean that they do
not care about these issues — after all, an en
dorsement is still merely an endorsement, and
does not create a categorical distinction be
tween those who care and those who do not.
One long-running criticism of the SOCC
is that we have actively chosen not to endorse
white candidates, implying that we believe
skin tone predicts who can best represent
certain issues and communities. The simple
truth, however, is that alt of those who ap
proached us for an endorsement this year
also identified as students of color. In previ
ous years, SOCC has endorsed those who do
not identify as students of color, revealing
the Board's critique to be misinformed and
the result of insufficient research.

There have already been numerous re
sponses to the Daily in the form of letters-to
the-editor that have come from outside of
the SOCC itself. We would like to thank
those who wrote in defense of the SOCC, and
point to the mass response of the student
body as an indicator of the continued impor
tance of the concerns of students of color.
These are not issues that can be confined to
certain groups, but extend to the entire Stan
ford community.
STUDENTS OF COLOR COALITION
In defense of the Editorial Board
Over the last few days, the Daily has print
ed a remarkable number of letters lambast
ing its own Editorial Board's position on the
Students of Color Coalition (SOCC), and has
printed very little in its own defense — per
haps no letters were sent?
A number of letters have accused the
Board of thinly veiled racism because it
noted that white students are under-rcpre
sented in the ASSU. In a climate that allows
minority groups to demand diversity and
more representation, and that is sympathetic
to their goals (as Stanford is), there will
be cases when a former majority be
comes a minority. To deny this group
the equal opportunity to advocate for
its representation is unfair and hypo
critical. For African Americans or
women at Stanford to deny Caucasian
males the equal freedom to push for
diversity and representation when
they are underrepresented is unfair
and hypocritical.
But this isn't about equal represen
tation. This is about race or gender
blind representation. And while an
ASSU whose elected officials are
overwhelmingly non-white is not an
argument for greater white represen
tation, it does suggest that the ASSU
and the campus at large are by no
means racist or hostile to minorities.
What seems so troublesome about the
SOCC and the composition of the
Senate is not that it is majority non
white, but that so many members of
the Senate are there because of their

race. The Board rightly points out that
to make race the deciding election
issue (the SOCC declared a "total vic
tory") does detract from other more
pressing issues — funding, a deaf ad
ministration. the renovation of Old
Union, problems with Dining and
ResEd — and monopolizes the politi
cal discourse. If the SOCC it is not
technically undemocratic, it certainly
violates the spirit of post-Civil Rights
democracy. White students are left in a
terrible Catch-22: we don't believe
that proportional representation
should be the goal, but we find our
selves accused of racism when we
point out that the groups like the
SOCC fly in the face of ideals of color
blindness and egalitarianism.
1 can only hope that by disagreeing
with the SOCC's party line 1 will not
find myself, too, accused of racism. I
place my trust in the maturity of Stan
ford students to engage in civil discus
sion and not resort to lowbrow and in
correct ad hominem attacks.

Let's focus on the real issues

The recent editorials about the
SOCC's endorsements have neglected
to discuss two of the most important is
sues in this ASSU election. The first is
the danger of disingenuous exploita
tion of race issues. One of the flyers 1
read announced the candidate's inten
tion to "reverse the trend of declining
minority advocacy" in the ASSU. I find
this alleged decline hard to believe; if
anything, the SOCC has had more in
fluence in recent years, not less. If it is
the case, however, that increased
SOCC representation on the ASSU
senate has not achieved results for stu
dents of color on campus, it may be
time to admit that this approach isn't
working, and goals of greater racial eq
uity cannot be achieved through our
student government.
The second is that the majority of
students, of all races, just don't care.
Voter participation was well below
half, and that includes hundreds of
votes for the Chappie slate that can
only be considered an attempt to kick
the system in the shins. 1 don't blame
them — I personally have watched
four years of candidates center their
campaigns around "bringing back the
Mausoleum party" to no avail.
Maybe it's time to listen to the real
majority. Not white students or stu
dents of color, but the huge majority of
us who just don't believe in our student
government.
