The SOCC replies to editorial
On Monday, the Editorial Board criticized
the Students of Color Coalition (SOCC) as a
"detractor of the electoral process" and at
worst, a "blight" ("The SOCC: A blight on the
democratic process?", Apr. 17). The argument
of the Board and Barrett Sheridan's column
("What really counts", Apr. 14) operate on a
faulty logic that is at once limited in its scope
and misinformed. It makes certain assump
tions about both the nature of the SOCC can
didate endorsement process and the motives
of our organization. This perpetuates a type of
racial logic that implicates students of color as
an undifferentiated and oppositional group re
acting against some hegemonic white majority,
angry for the sake of being angry.
Both pieces accuse the SOCC of over-rep
resenting certain groups in its endorsements,
and under-representing others, which it per
ceives to be a result of inter-group politics.
Such an accusation is based on a conceptual
ization of ethnic communities as easily sepa
rable and without overlap. It is reflective of a
logic based on the belief that people only care
about the issues that affect the communities
of which they are members. One must be
wary of drawing linear connections between

biology and belief, skin-tone and political
views. Such a view compartmentalizes indi
viduals and communities into neat categories
and also presupposes that, for example, an
Asian American must care about Asian
American issues and could not possibly care
about the concerns of other communities.
Contrary to these presuppositions, there
are many students on this campus who are
concerned about student-of-color issues, yet
do not identify as students of color. We also
feel that just because a candidate is not
SOCC-endorsed does not mean that they do
not care about these issues — after all, an en
dorsement is still merely an endorsement, and
does not create a categorical distinction be
tween those who care and those who do not.
One long-running criticism of the SOCC
is that we have actively chosen not to endorse
white candidates, implying that we believe
skin tone predicts who can best represent
certain issues and communities. The simple
truth, however, is that alt of those who ap
proached us for an endorsement this year
also identified as students of color. In previ
ous years, SOCC has endorsed those who do
not identify as students of color, revealing
the Board's critique to be misinformed and
the result of insufficient research.

There have already been numerous re
sponses to the Daily in the form of letters-to
the-editor that have come from outside of
the SOCC itself. We would like to thank
those who wrote in defense of the SOCC, and
point to the mass response of the student
body as an indicator of the continued impor
tance of the concerns of students of color.
These are not issues that can be confined to
certain groups, but extend to the entire Stan
ford community.
STUDENTS OF COLOR COALITION
In defense of the Editorial Board
Over the last few days, the Daily has print
ed a remarkable number of letters lambast
ing its own Editorial Board's position on the
Students of Color Coalition (SOCC), and has
printed very little in its own defense — per
haps no letters were sent?
A number of letters have accused the
Board of thinly veiled racism because it
noted that white students are under-rcpre
sented in the ASSU. In a climate that allows
minority groups to demand diversity and
more representation, and that is sympathetic
