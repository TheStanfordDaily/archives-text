# President visits Hoover
## BUSH TO MEET WITH HENNESSY, SHULTZ Sources say president will meet with fellows at conservative think tank 
### DANIEL NOVINSON JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITORS 
In his first trip to Stanford as president,
George W. Bush will arrive on campus this af
ternoon to meet privately with economic and
foreign policy fellows at the Hoover Institu
tion, the conservative-leaning think tank
headquartered in Hoover Tower.
University President John Hennessy,
Hoover Fellow George Shultz — who served
as secretary of state under President Ronald
Reagan — and Hoover Institution Director
John Raisian will be among those present at
the private meeting, which will last between
one and two hours.
At the meeting, the president is expected
to seek input from leading policy analysts,
much like he did in 1998, when he visited the
Hoover Institution as governor of Texas in
preparation for his first presidential cam
paign. More recently, Bush spoke with senior
leadership at the Hoover Institution's Board
of Overseers meeting in Washington D.C. on
Feb. 28.
Security concerns have shrouded today's
visit in a cloak of secrecy. Details of the meet
ing — its precise starting time, length, location
and participants — are not being released
publicly. One source said that many top mem
bers of the Institution were not made aware of
the president's visit until late last week or
early this week.
The White House did not officially ac

knowledge the visit until late yesterday after
noon. The meeting will be closed to both the
press and the public.
The Secret Service, in conjunction with the
Stanford Department of Public Safety and
other local law enforcement agencies, will es
tablish a secure perimeter around the Hoover
complex — Hoover Tower, the Lou Henry
Hoover Building and Herbert Hoover
Memorial Building — from shortly after
noon until 7:30 p.m., according to a source
close to the Hoover Institution.
The source added that snipers will be in
Hoover Tower and on the roofs of the com
plex's other buildings, and that employees
were told to leave all cabinets and drawers in
the Tower unlocked to facilitate searches.
Due to safety concerns, few sources would
discuss even the most basic details of the pres
ident's visit on the record. When asked who he
would be meeting with, one source's good-na
tured deflection spoke volumes of University
officials' reticence to disclose any potentially
sensitive information: "Maybe he's just going
to be watching TV by himself for an hour."
The surprise trip to Stanford comes as part
of the president's two-day California trip. He
will land at Moffett Field at the NASA Ames
Research Center in Mountain View. Before
arriving on campus, he will travel to Cisco Sys
tems headquarters in San Jose, where he will
take a plant tour, speak with Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger and sit on a panel on the
American Competitiveness Initiative, a hall
mark of his 2006 State of the Union address.
His remarks at Cisco are scheduled to begin at
2:10 p.m.
From Cisco, Bush will travel to Stanford
for his meeting with the Hoover fellows, which
will presumably start between 3 and 4 p.m. He
will then travel to St. Helena, a small town in

the Napa Valley about 70 miles north of San
Francisco, where he will stay overnight.
Because the president's next stop is in St.
Helena, more than 10() miles to the north, he is
expected to depart Stanford by helicopter, and
may arrive at the University on a helicopter as
well. A Federal Aviation Administration advi
sory earlier this week extended the airspace
use restrictions that traditionally follow the
president to include the Stanford area, as well
as San Jose. Students have observed helicop
ters practicing takeoffs and landings at Sand
Hill Field throughout the week, and parking
around Sand Hill Fields is limited today.
The visit comes amid tough times for
Bush. His historically-low 33 percent ap
proval rating puts the entire Republican
party in jeopardy for the 2006 midterm elec
tions.
Nonetheless, student leaders welcomed
the news of the president's arrival.
"To be honest, I'm just as intrigued as any
student here," said outgoing ASSU President
Melanie Kannokada, a senior. "It's an honor
for the president to make time to meet with
Hennessy and Stanford's leading scholars. I
hope it proves enlightening for President
Bush and his political agenda."
Meanwhile, as news of the visit spread
across the Stanford campus yesterday, pro
gressive group leaders encouraged protest.
While the extensive security may complicate
efforts to organize a mass demonstration
today, such groups are encouraging their
members to wear all black.
Leaders of the Stanford Democrats and
the Stanford Labor Action Coalition (SLAC)
said they were planning no direct protests, but
they said some of the members may join oth-
