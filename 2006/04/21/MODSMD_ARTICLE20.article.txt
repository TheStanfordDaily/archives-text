## SOFTBALL Mighty Maddy Freshman shortstop Coon is loving life on the Farm 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
Maddy Coon is in her element on the soft
ball diamond. The game is in her blood and
the freshman shortstop's talent shows every
time she steps up to bat or flips the ball to sec
ond for the double play.
The Chappaqua, N.Y., native was intro
duced to baseball early. Her father Randy, a
minor league player in the Baltimore Orioles
farm system, started his daughter on tee-ball
and she has been hooked ever since.
"I fell in love with the game the first time
I picked up a ball," she said."lt's a team sport
and the camaraderie you have with your
teammates is second to none. But at the same
time, you have the individual aspect. And I
think it's the hardest game to play. Hitting a
softball or a baseball is the hardest thing to
do in sports and we pride ourselves on doing
it."
Coon, it seems, hits the ball better than
most. She was the New York State Player of
the Year in 2004 and 2005 and the Gatorade
State Player of the Year as a senior at Horace
Greeley High School. Her reputation in New
York eventually attracted the attention of
the Stanford coaching staff.
"We. by word of mouth, heard that there

was a player that was academically oriented
and could hit the ball really well and was a
tremendous athlete and that we needed to
take a look at her." head coach John Rittman
said. "We took a look at her in her junior year
and decided she would be a great fit to our
program."
"I didn't have my heart set on any one
school since the beginning," Coon said. "I
was open to a lot of schools. In the end. 1
knew 1 wanted to go to the West Coast, be
cause I grew up in New York. All the snow, I
just couldn't deal with it anymore. So I came
to Cali and I 'm glad I did."
The rarity of snow on the Stanford cam
pus may have first attracted Coon, but every
thing about the Stanford softball program as
sured her that the Farm was the place for her.
"It is the team, the coaches, the facilities,
the weather — not so much recently," Coon
said. "Just everything about it is better than
any other school. Oh. and academics — I for
got about that."
Still just a freshman. Coon is blissfully un
declared and focusing her energy on her
team.
"Our potential has not even been reached
yet." Coon said. "Our team is so potent in
every aspect of the game that we could be a
very special team. And 1 just hope I can be a
part of that."
If the first half of the season is any indica
tion. Coon's role in the team's success will be
