## Clayton's missions accomplished After volleyball, thesis and a mission, Will Clayton is off to Yale 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
Six years after first setting foot
on the Farm. Will Clayton is finally
ready to take the next step. A Stan
ford student since 2000. Clayton is
graduating this spring with a de
gree in English with Honors. The
next stop? Yale Law School.
After taking time off from
Stanford to complete a Mormon
mission, Clayton, an outside hitter
on the men's volleyball team, re
turned for three more seasons,
playing his last game a week ago.
"It's been a great experience,"
he said. "To have been able to
compete at a high level in the most
competitive league in the country
and to do it with guys that I enjoy
being with. And I have had the op
portunity to play with a lot of guys
since 1 have been here."
After his freshman season,
Clayton stopped out of school and
left the team behind for his mis
sion in Baltimore, Md.
"The mission experience has
been the most satisfying of my
life," he said. "If I had to make the
decision to do it a hundred times
again, I would make the same de
cision. I experienced a lot of per
sonal growth and became more
committed to my principles. And it
helped me be able to come back
here and be disciplined and have a
work ethic that would allow me to
do my best at school and also do
my best in volleyball."
When he returned to the team,
he did so with renewed discipline
and determination, but it was an
uphill climb.
"While I was gone, I really did
n't do any weight training or play
any volleyball," Clayton said. "My
focus was on serving the people in
Baltimore. So 1 left at about 205
pounds and came back at 165
pounds. All of the muscle mass
that 1 had built up over years of
training was gone. I really had to
start over from scratch, and re
learn how to play volleyball."
"When he came back, he was

not in the best of shape," coach
Don Shaw recalled. "But he
worked very hard to catch up. Vol
leyball is not an easy sport to stop
playing and then come back to. It's
not like riding a bicycle — it does
n't just come back right away. I
think it was frustrating for him, es
pecially in that first year back, but
he worked very hard and has real
ly contributed a lot since then."
In his senior campaign. Clayton
started all but three matches for
the Cardinal and finished third on
the team with 160 kills, hitting. 197
on the season. He was second on
the team in service aces with 21
and finished with 60 digs and 26
total blocks.
As hard as he worked on the
court and in the weight room,
Clayton brought that same work
ethic to his studies. And it has paid
off. Despite the time commitment
of being on a varsity team, Clayton
is writing an honors thesis — a cri
tique of literary criticism on Hem
ingway— and spending all day
every day in the library.
"I love what 1 study," he said."l
love the English major. It's not
hard to set aside the time to read
books or write papers when you
are looking forward to doing it.
I've written papers on planes and
in hotel rooms. That was key for
me, finding a subject I really enjoy
to begin with. That makes it easy."
And as soon as the thesis is
over, Yale beckons. Having turned
down Harvard and Stanford law
schools, Clayton plans to study en
vironmental law, picking up a Mas
ters degree in environmental man
agement along the way.
"I feel like environmental is
sues are becoming more and more
a problem that our society has to
confront soon," Clayton said.
"Something like climate change is
something that my generation is
going to have to face and start to
find solutions to the problem. I
think it would be exciting to take
my law education and be part of
the solution."
"He has a lot of maturity,"
Shaw said. "He's a pretty quiet
person, not all rah-rah out there.
He's several years older than a lot
of the guys, so there's a bit of a gen
