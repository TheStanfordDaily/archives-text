## Fantasy Baseball: Fake Action, Real Waste of Time 
### 
So I spent four hours on Sunday
sitting around in my house
kitchen with about five other
guys. No group project, no deep dis
cussion, just yelling hack and forth
about the next pick. See, like millions
of Americans, I've become a fantasy
player. Much like the Jewish boy who
realizes at his Bar Mitzvah that he's
more likely to own a professional
sports team than play for one, people
have stopped actually playing sports
and instead enjoy manipulating them.
A fantasy player is the nerd who fi
nally feels like a big man because the
jock now works for him.There are lit
erally thousands of blogs, advice
columns, league information sheets
and other opinions published and up
dated daily by guys who can scarcely
bench press Barry Bonds' bat.
Here's just a few examples of the
idiotic minutia that these things can
develop into. These are all real stats:
As of April 7, Houston Astros clos
er Brad Lidge has not given up a
home run to Albert Pujols in 172 con
secutive days.
Chicago Cubs outfielder Matt
Murton has a career slugging percent
age of 1.200 when he shakes the hand
of a U.S. president before the game.
Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher
Rodrigo Lopez has a 6.39 ERA when
Anna Benson is considering divorc
ing his teammate Kris.
The worst part about it is that I've
spent time looking for these things. In
the three days since I drafted my
team, I've found myself developing a
new obsession. Instead of the face
book, I now spend two hours a day
micromanaging my players. I check
stupid stats, investigate every note
and work through every potential
lineup change, only to wind up back
where I started. The winners are still
the winners, and I'm pretty sure that
Chris Shelton will not finish the sea
son with the 104 homeruns projected
if he maintains his current pace.
But the thing is that I can't stop
myself from checking. I even bought
this stupid in-game stat tracker for the
nominal fee of $9.99! What does it let
me do, you may ask? Well, I can now
see how my players are doing as the
game progresses, as opposed to wait
ing until the next morning when
Yahoo updates it for everyone. Does
this mean I can change my players
mid-game if they're having a bad
day? Uhhhh, n0.... but I know sooner
that my team is going down in flames.
For, you see, fantasy sports is like
heroin. You know it's bad for you.
Every time you do it you get a rush,
but it inevitably ends with nothing ac
complished except a loss of time,
money and self-respect (although
you probably didn't vomit all over
yourself in the process). Seriously,
when all is said and done, what do you
have to show for it? There's no money
involved (at least that I'm aware of).
OK. maybe you derive a sense of
pride from being a manipulative, in
sanely obsessed stat weasel and win
ning your league. Anyone who would
like to gloat about their playing abili
ties is more than welcome to step
onto the diamond (the real one, with
physical dirt and grass) and play a few
games with me. Until you gap one and
stretch it into a triple or turn the 6-4-
3, shut the hell up.
Honestly, it's not healthy. Instead
of getting out and playing the games,
people are playing the players. It's the
same unhealthy obsession that has
lead to an unprecedented boom in the
sports video game market and a de
cline in the sports merchandise mar
ket.
"Hey Johnny, wanna go toss the
ball around?"
"Sorry, I can't, ESPN Insider is
about to break a story on when Ken
Griffey Jr. will be off the DL and I've
got to be the first one to jump on it."
It's not a complete waste. Since
I've joined, I've come to love baseball
more than I did before. The fantasy
world draws you in and makes you
pay attention to every team, every
player, every game. You become
more engrossed with the sport than
ever before, and learn a lot more
about how it's played. It is essentially
like being a big league manager.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to
go yell at Francisco Cordero for giv
ing up three runs in the bottom of the
ninth to blow the save and rack up my
WHIP.
