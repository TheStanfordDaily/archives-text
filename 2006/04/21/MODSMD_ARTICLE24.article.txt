# MEN'S TENNIS
## Through My Eyes: Senior Jon Wong reflects Wong waxes nostalgic before final regular season match of his career 
### BY CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In this week's "Through My Eyes," The Daily
talks with Jon Wong, a senior from Los Altos Hills,
Calif. Wong is 5-2 in dual matches this year and has
been a key figure in the Stanford men's tennis
team's 14-3 (5-1 Pac-10) season, most recently
notching victories in the team's wins over South
ern California, Arizona and Arizona State.
Taking charge and setting an example
As a senior, I think it's important to be a good
role model and show the underclassmen how to
conduct themselves in practice; as a senior, you
have to take charge. I'm not the captain and it's not
my personality to be very vocal, but I think it's still
very important to set an example on the court, be
focused and take practice seriously.
Over the last few years, our doubles hasn't been
great; I guess one of my roles [on the team] is to try

and strengthen that. I've been playing a lot of dou
bles with [junior] James Wan, and getting a win at
No. 3 is something that we really need to do.
Changes
I think I've done a good job of improving the
things that were my weaknesses in the past. For ex
ample: my return of serve. I wouldn't call it a
strength now, but I wouldn't call it one of my weak
er points anymore. Volleying too. But if 1 could
change one [aspect of my game], I'd have a really
good backhand.
Adjusting
I remember back to the first few days of fresh
man year — getting used to life at Stanford and
getting to know everyone. I remember being
aware that it was such a big life change — living on
your own and meeting people in your dorm. It was
a little bit of a shock to begin with. Now, I'm still
living with guys [from freshman year]; I've lived
with them all four years.
The what-if game
If I wasn't playing tennis, I probably would

have tried to go abroad somewhere. I took Spanish
in high school and here at Stanford, so it probably
would have been easiest to go to Chile or Spain.
Italy obviously is a pretty cool place too. I've been
there before and loved it.
I lived in Hong Kong when I was in sixth grade
and haven't been back since. I really liked the city
and being able to go downtown. We traveled a lit
tle bit around Asia, including Thailand. I've been
to a lot of cool places — it'd be hard to rank them
all. Four years with the team in Hawaii — you
can't beat that.
Life after Stanford
After I graduate, my plan right now is to take a
year off and find a job doing research. In terms of
trying to play professionally, that's not for me. I've
seen really great players from Stanford who are re
ally talented yet they're struggling to do well on
the tour now. I feel like there's more out there for
me than just trying to make it [on the Pro tour], I'm
going to move on from really competitive tennis,
but I'll still definitely try and play as much as I can
