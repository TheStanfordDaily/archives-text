### VICTOR FUSTE BETSY CONGDON INTERMISSION EDITORS 
Earlier this week, Betsy said to me,
"Don't worry Victor, we'll have sex in
this issue." I am familiar with the
workplace sexual harassment policies
— thanks to Camille — so I knew 1
had to put that statement in print. But,
taking into account that I am officially
and happily taken, and that it's Admit
Weekend, we decided to forego the in
teroffice fling and just print an issue
dedicated to the topic of sex.
For countless years running — we
actually just can't count — the "Sex
Issue" has been an Intermission Tradi
tion. simultaneously shocking parents
and convincing people to come to
Stanford, just askTam.
But this year, we have the added
bonus that this issue will come out
when our illustrious Presidente will
be gracing our campus with his pres
ence and otherwise disrupting peace
ful, previously planned activities.
Kinda sounds like the Middle East,
don't it?
Before you get on our cases for not
being patriotic, do you really think
we'd pass up an opportunity to make
fun of a guy whose last name is Bush?
In our SEX issue? That would be like
asking Roxy for a vow of celibacy. Or
Dick Cheney to not shoot someone in
the face.
I gotta give it to the man. though.
He's got some big brass cojones, and
in a world where everyone is trying to
have the biggest balls (well, except
Barry Bonds), he's managed to out
ball them all. Don't believe me? Just
read the news every freaking day.
At the beginning of his presidency,
it really was just about the foibles in
his speeches ("It's hard to put food on
your family"), but now that we're in
his second term — by the way, WTF?
— it seems like things can't go right
for W. I don't know about you, but I
expected to be living on that Mars
colony he promised.
So listen up Profros! If you want to
protest Bush, he'll be at Hoover today
in the afternoon. More importantly, if
you want to protest everything he
stands for — hell, even if you don't —
remember that one of the greatest
parts about Admit Weekend is the
consequence free tail you can get.
Take a page from Bush's book — you
can act like you've got the biggest pair
without caring about it later.
Well, at least not until she shows up
in your IHUM section. Then it's just
awkward. We suggest faking like you
have no idea what's going on. Seems to
work for Dubya.
