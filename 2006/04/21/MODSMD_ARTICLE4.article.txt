# After riding the pine, Chris Minaker looks to turn around the season — then turn pro
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS EDITOR IN CHIEF 
Senior shortstop Chris Minaker has literal
ly been playing baseball since he could walk.
His fate was sealed before age three when his
mother brought home a mini bat and ball and
— to the shock and awe of both parents — he
belted his first pitch across the living room.
Nineteen years later, Minaker is one of
Stanford's leaders, striving to provide an exam
ple for the younger players, with an eye toward
this year's draft. Undaunted by the Card's dis

mal record (16-15,2-7 Pac-10), he has a sunny
disposition and the confidence that the second
half of the season will tell a different story.
And if anyone knows about patience, it's
Minaker, who waited out his freshman year on
the bench. Since he first got the nod halfway
through his freshman year, he has made the
most of his time on the field, playing every in
ning of every game.The righthander from Lyn
nwood. Wash., has made his his mark, hitting
.331 this season — including five homeruns —
when the Cardinal need every hit they can get.
Despite his success both on defense and in
the batter's box, Minaker insists his time in the
dugout was well spent,even if he didn't fully re
alize it at the time,
"Freshman year, I admit, I was frustrated,"
he said. "I realized I'd be playing with guys like
Danny Putnam and Ryan Garko, and I wasn't

used to being the low man on the totem pole.
But I looked at the situation and was honest
with myself. I knew they were better, but I also
believed I would one day be that good, maybe
better. At practice I worked hard, and I wanted
to be the best I could be when the time came."
He's made a point of passing this lesson on
to this year's freshmen, citing his own experi
ence as a prime example. In particular, he
hopes to help outfielder Joey August with his
mental approach to hitting off southpaws and
encourage infielder Stephen Brown to stay in
shape as he waits for play time.
"It's just a big exercise in building confi
dence without being out on the field," ex
plained Minaker, who Coach Mark Marquess
said has been an invaluable addition to the
team as both a role model and leader.
"He's the number one guy leading by example with
his work ethic during practice and performance during
the games," Marquess said. "He's very accessible and
not at all intimidating to the younger guys on the team."
Minaker himself echoes these words, saying that he
tries to be "that guy everyone can talk to." In line with
this goal, he makes a point of helping his teammates
through issues both on and off the diamond. And he
also leads the Cardinal's weekly Bible study group.
"My relationship with Jesus is a big part of every
thing I do," he said.
The senior, a veritable spokesman for the power of
positive thinking, has carried over his resolve on the
field into his academic life as well, earning his bache
lor's in sociology is just three years and preparing to
pick up a co-terminal degree by June.
"The opportunity to play professional baseball is a
finite window." he said of his decision to stay at Stanford
after not being drafted last season. "Your career can
end at any point, and it doesn't work out for many. 1
wanted to be prepared for whatever life offers me."
When it comes to this year's draft, however. Minaker
is cool and collected — even though he can't help smil
ing at the idea of winning a World Series for the Seattle
Mariners someday.
"1 have my faith in the Lord, and if I use the abilities
he's given me. things will all work out for the best." he
said, unflustered by the impact the team's poor record
might have on his chances. "If we succeed, then I will
consider myself successful. I'm not a pro yet. I'm here
now, so that's where my focus is."
Marquess was also confident about Minaker's
chances at the end of the season.
"He's our most consistent player." he said. "I'm pos
itive he'll be playing pro ball by this time next year."
For now. Minaker just seems thrilled to be playing
and hopes to keep his iron-man streak alive, concentrat
ing on keeping himself prepared mentally to take on
every inning until the very end.
"Luckily for me. baseball is a marathon, not a
sprint," he said. "I just look at each day as a blessing. I
have my health.my happiness — I'm the starting short
stop for the Stanford baseball team. I'm right where 1
want to be."
After a midweek win. the Cardinal will hit the road
for a three-game series at Arizona. The Wildcats cur
rently sit one spot ahead of the Cardinal in the Pac-10.

— to the shock and awe of both parents — he
belted his first pitch across the living room.
Nineteen years later, Minaker is one of
Stanford's leaders, striving to provide an exam
ple for the younger players, with an eye toward
this year's draft. Undaunted by the Card's dis

mal record (16-15,2-7 Pac-10), he has a sunny
disposition and the confidence that the second
half of the season will tell a different story.
And if anyone knows about patience, it's
Minaker, who waited out his freshman year on
the bench. Since he first got the nod halfway
through his freshman year, he has made the
most of his time on the field, playing every in
ning of every game.The righthander from Lyn
nwood. Wash., has made his his mark, hitting
.331 this season — including five homeruns —
when the Cardinal need every hit they can get.
Despite his success both on defense and in
the batter's box, Minaker insists his time in the
dugout was well spent,even if he didn't fully re
alize it at the time,
"Freshman year, I admit, I was frustrated,"
he said. "I realized I'd be playing with guys like
Danny Putnam and Ryan Garko, and I wasn't

used to being the low man on the totem pole.
But I looked at the situation and was honest
with myself. I knew they were better, but I also
believed I would one day be that good, maybe
better. At practice I worked hard, and I wanted
to be the best I could be when the time came."
He's made a point of passing this lesson on
to this year's freshmen, citing his own experi
ence as a prime example. In particular, he
hopes to help outfielder Joey August with his
mental approach to hitting off southpaws and
encourage infielder Stephen Brown to stay in
shape as he waits for play time.
"It's just a big exercise in building confi
dence without being out on the field," ex
plained Minaker, who Coach Mark Marquess
said has been an invaluable addition to the
team as both a role model and leader.
"He's the number one guy leading by example with
his work ethic during practice and performance during
the games," Marquess said. "He's very accessible and
not at all intimidating to the younger guys on the team."
Minaker himself echoes these words, saying that he
tries to be "that guy everyone can talk to." In line with
this goal, he makes a point of helping his teammates
through issues both on and off the diamond. And he
also leads the Cardinal's weekly Bible study group.
"My relationship with Jesus is a big part of every
thing I do," he said.
The senior, a veritable spokesman for the power of
positive thinking, has carried over his resolve on the
field into his academic life as well, earning his bache
lor's in sociology is just three years and preparing to
pick up a co-terminal degree by June.
"The opportunity to play professional baseball is a
finite window." he said of his decision to stay at Stanford
after not being drafted last season. "Your career can
end at any point, and it doesn't work out for many. 1
wanted to be prepared for whatever life offers me."
When it comes to this year's draft, however. Minaker
is cool and collected — even though he can't help smil
ing at the idea of winning a World Series for the Seattle
Mariners someday.
"1 have my faith in the Lord, and if I use the abilities
he's given me. things will all work out for the best." he
said, unflustered by the impact the team's poor record
might have on his chances. "If we succeed, then I will
consider myself successful. I'm not a pro yet. I'm here
now, so that's where my focus is."
Marquess was also confident about Minaker's
chances at the end of the season.
"He's our most consistent player." he said. "I'm pos
itive he'll be playing pro ball by this time next year."
For now. Minaker just seems thrilled to be playing
and hopes to keep his iron-man streak alive, concentrat
ing on keeping himself prepared mentally to take on
every inning until the very end.
"Luckily for me. baseball is a marathon, not a
sprint," he said. "I just look at each day as a blessing. I
have my health.my happiness — I'm the starting short
stop for the Stanford baseball team. I'm right where 1
want to be."
After a midweek win. the Cardinal will hit the road
for a three-game series at Arizona. The Wildcats cur
rently sit one spot ahead of the Cardinal in the Pac-10.
