# After riding the pine, Chris Minaker looks to turn around the season — then turn pro

### CAMILLE RICKETTS EDITOR IN CHIEF 
Senior shortstop Chris Minaker has literal
ly been playing baseball since he could walk.
His fate was sealed before age three when his
mother brought home a mini bat and ball and
— to the shock and awe of both parents — he
belted his first pitch across the living room.
Nineteen years later, Minaker is one of
Stanford's leaders, striving to provide an exam
ple for the younger players, with an eye toward
this year's draft. Undaunted by the Card's dis

mal record (16-15,2-7 Pac-10), he has a sunny
disposition and the confidence that the second
half of the season will tell a different story.
And if anyone knows about patience, it's
Minaker, who waited out his freshman year on
the bench. Since he first got the nod halfway
through his freshman year, he has made the
most of his time on the field, playing every in
ning of every game.The righthander from Lyn
nwood. Wash., has made his his mark, hitting
.331 this season — including five homeruns —
when the Cardinal need every hit they can get.
Despite his success both on defense and in
the batter's box, Minaker insists his time in the
dugout was well spent,even if he didn't fully re
alize it at the time,
"Freshman year, I admit, I was frustrated,"
he said. "I realized I'd be playing with guys like
Danny Putnam and Ryan Garko, and I wasn't

used to being the low man on the totem pole.
But I looked at the situation and was honest
with myself. I knew they were better, but I also
believed I would one day be that good, maybe
better. At practice I worked hard, and I wanted
to be the best I could be when the time came."
He's made a point of passing this lesson on
to this year's freshmen, citing his own experi
ence as a prime example. In particular, he
hopes to help outfielder Joey August with his
mental approach to hitting off southpaws and
encourage infielder Stephen Brown to stay in
shape as he waits for play time.
"It's just a big exercise in building confi
dence without being out on the field," ex
plained Minaker, who Coach Mark Marquess
said has been an invaluable addition to the
