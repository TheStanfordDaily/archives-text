# MEN'S BASKETBALL
## Johnson Part II: Recruits & Hernandez Coach dishes the dirt on chemistry and expectations 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
The Daily interviewed men's basketball coach Trent Johnsonfor more than an
hour last Thursday. And, for the most part. Coach J was incredibly revealing.
He called his predecessor Mike Montgomery "one of the best college coaches
ever," while admitting that this year's unit wasn't quite as cohesive as the squads of
even a year or two ago. when players who had spent most of their Stanford careers
under Monty dominated the lineup.
"Did we have great team chemistry, like we had on that 30-2 team [2003-04], or

that team with Rob and Nick [2(X)4-05]?" Johnson
said. "No, but we had great guys."
So just when the talk was getting interesting, it
suddenly took a turn for the worse when I men
tioned that we were planning on printing ex
cerpts of the interview as our lead story.
"Scrunch it up!" Johnson demanded. "I saw
I what you ran in November, and it was too flashy.
Tara, she's been around long enough that she
deserves that. But for me and Walt, no way."
I told Johnson I couldn't promise him any
thing - men's basketball and football are the
headline sports on this campus, after all.
Then 1 got the call yesterday morning: The
President was coming. I guess that
Trent Johnson story was
not going to be running
above the fold after
all.

So, Trent Johnson
and fan alike, we
hope you enjoy our
interview, part two:
