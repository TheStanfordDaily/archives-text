# MEN'S BASKETBALL
## Johnson Part II: Recruits & Hernandez Coach dishes the dirt on chemistry and expectations 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
The Daily interviewed men's basketball coach Trent Johnsonfor more than an
hour last Thursday. And, for the most part. Coach J was incredibly revealing.
He called his predecessor Mike Montgomery "one of the best college coaches
ever," while admitting that this year's unit wasn't quite as cohesive as the squads of
even a year or two ago. when players who had spent most of their Stanford careers
under Monty dominated the lineup.
"Did we have great team chemistry, like we had on that 30-2 team [2003-04], or

that team with Rob and Nick [2(X)4-05]?" Johnson
said. "No, but we had great guys."
So just when the talk was getting interesting, it
suddenly took a turn for the worse when I men
tioned that we were planning on printing ex
cerpts of the interview as our lead story.
"Scrunch it up!" Johnson demanded. "I saw
I what you ran in November, and it was too flashy.
Tara, she's been around long enough that she
deserves that. But for me and Walt, no way."
I told Johnson I couldn't promise him any
thing - men's basketball and football are the
headline sports on this campus, after all.
Then 1 got the call yesterday morning: The
President was coming. I guess that
Trent Johnson story was
not going to be running
above the fold after
all.

So, Trent Johnson
and fan alike, we
hope you enjoy our
interview, part two:

On what made Chris Hernandez so
special:
"Chris gives up everything. I've
been in the business for 21 years and
I've never been around an individ
ual who does as much to make him
self into a good player and a good
person and gives up so much to
everybody else.
"I just hope some of these guys
who write these checks in the NBA
say, 'Hey look, he'll be a good third
guard. He's a guy who deserves to be
in this league.' A lot of the guys who
are making a lot of money, he's beat
them a lot."
On next season:
"We're going to be a very young

and a more talented team, but for us,
it's going to be a work in progress.
What I think should be exciting
for Stanford fans is that we'll have
depth. We'll have Lawrence, Taj,
Fred playing the wing. We'll have
Mitch, Carlton, Kenny Brown,
Da'veed Dildy playing the point.
Da'veed can play the two, but we'll
have Anthony, we'll have Landry
playing the two position. He can
play the two or three, but he's more
of a two. We'll have Robin, Pete,
Brook and Will playing the four and
the five and you can always push Taj
over, you can always push Lawrence
back. So if we do have [knocks on
wood] a key injury, it shouldn't hurt
us.
But also, of the returning players,
just so people are realistic, we have
one guy who's had any type of all
league honors, and that's Mitch,
Freshman All-Pac-10 Honorable
Mention. So that's exciting. We're
going to have to scrap, have to dig,

and go from there. We'll be young."
On expectations for incoming Mc-
Donald's All-American twins
Brook and Robin Lopez, respec
tively Scout.com's #2 power for
ward and #4 center in the class of
2006:
First of all, they're stepping into a
different environment academically,
which is unlike anyplace else. Our
guys deal with different standards
than anyone in the country except
for the Ivy League, I don't care what
anyone else says.
I'd like to say this: UCLA is a
perfect example. They had four
McDonald's All-Americans two
years ago: Jordan Farniar, Josh
Shipp. Aaron Afflalo and Cedric
Bozeman.They had a great run this
year, but look at the adjustment pe
riod they went through as fresh
men.
So it's going to take time for

them, but they are talented and all
they want is to get better. Will Paul,
similar situation. Landry Fields,
Da'veed Dildy, all these five guys are
going to help us. But I think the most
important thing for people to under
stand is give these guys time to be
freshmen. Give them time to blend
in.
Danny Grunfeld understands the
game, basketball lO's pretty good.
Dildy's lO's pretty good. You know
what that means, you know what
Danny was.
All five guys, the thing I like
about our incoming class is they
have a good understanding of the
game.
