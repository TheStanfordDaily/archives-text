## Students lukewarm on need for more bars PUBS ON CAMPUS 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
The 750 — the first and only pub on campus —
will celebrate its first annual anniversary in June
amid general student support. In the meantime,
however, the possibility of more on-campus pubs
and alcohol joints has faced mixed opinions.
Located in the Graduate Community Center at
Escondido and Campus Drive, the pub has enjoyed
success, although owners think it will take more
time for the business to get completely off the
ground. Co-owner Maurice Carrubba said that stu
dents aren't used to having food and drinks on that
side of campus.
"It's a matter of changing people's routines,"
Carrubba said. "But we're happy to be here and
hopefully students support the place and keep
coming."
Advocates of more alcohol options on campus
may be surprised to learn that only 35 percent of
The 750's revenue comes from alcohol. Food and

soft drink purchases make up the majority of
sales. The pub offers beer, wine and sake,
with no plans to obtain a liquor license to
serve hard alcohol.
"[Mixed drinks] were not part of the
deal," Carrubba said. "The University want
ed a beer and wine place."
Beer and wine seem to be the norm at
other alcohol-serving establishments across
campus, including the Treehouse and the
Cool Cafe at the Cantor Arts Center. The

Treehouse sells 20 to 30 pitchers of beer on an av
erage night, according to assistant manager Eduar
do Cesana. The Cool Cafe also sells 20 to 30 glass
es of wine and 60 to 70 beers a day, with students
purchasing a large majority of the beers, said man
ager Liliana Gonzalez.
Even so, businesses like the CoHo stopped serv
ing beer at the end of the summer. One employee
speculated that Stanford Dining wanted to change
the atmosphere of the establishment. And the like
lihood of one sitting down for a glass of wine at the
bookstore cafe also looks slim with Store Director
Ken Bowers citing licensing difficulties, Stanford
policy issues and lack of interest.
"I'm not so sure our hours are conducive to [al
cohol service]," Bowers said. "And 1 wonder if
there would be enough demand to warrant all the
time and effort."
While alcohol service in the new Old Union re
mains a possibility, outgoing ASSU Vice President
and senior Aneto Okonkwo predicted that there
will be many University concerns with the likeli-

hood of another campus bar. Barriers in
clude liability issues, the use of prime real
estate in the center of campus for an
other pub and the worry over stu
dents getting out of control.
"It's unclear whether this is a
good thing for students," Okonkwo
said. "Not many undergraduates are
of drinking age so who's going to be

using it? It's not very needed."
In the meantime, students still
have The 750, which may be getting
some video games and foosball ta
bles in the near future. Carrubba
said that he fought "tooth and nail"
to get a pool table in the pub, and it
has been a huge hit with the students.
"Although The 750 isn't as nice as
the other off-campus bars like Blue
Chalk, I like it because I can walk to
it and drinks are cheaper," said sen
ior Chee-Hyung Yoon.
The 750 has attempted to in
crease interest and attendance by
hosting various nightly events, the
most popular being comedy night on
TUesdays and Grad Night on Thurs
days. Attendance for the comedy
night has grown from 20 students to
80 students within a month and a
half. Grad Night offers live music

and generally attracts 100 to 150 vis
itors, according to Carrubba.
"1 think The 750 is a great asset
for the grad community," said Nahid
Harjee, a first-year doctoral student
in electrical engineering. "It's a con
venient location to meet up with
friends and just chill, something that
more grad students need to do. It's
also an ideal place to meet people
from other departments, which is
difficult through class alone."
Students are torn about having
another bar on campus.
"It would be nice to have another
bar, maybe one more directed at un
dergrads, although that gets tricky,"
said senior Mike Reding. "But to be
honest, personally, I don't care be
cause 1 drink with my drawmates in
my room."
Carrubba was also unsure about
the feasibility of another pub on
campus.
"I think there's room for other
things on this campus," Carrubba
said. "Whether they'll be successful
or not, we'll see."
