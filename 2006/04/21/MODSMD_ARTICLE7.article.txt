## Students lukewarm on need for more bars PUBS ON CAMPUS 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
The 750 — the first and only pub on campus —
will celebrate its first annual anniversary in June
amid general student support. In the meantime,
however, the possibility of more on-campus pubs
and alcohol joints has faced mixed opinions.
Located in the Graduate Community Center at
Escondido and Campus Drive, the pub has enjoyed
success, although owners think it will take more
time for the business to get completely off the
ground. Co-owner Maurice Carrubba said that stu
dents aren't used to having food and drinks on that
side of campus.
"It's a matter of changing people's routines,"
Carrubba said. "But we're happy to be here and
hopefully students support the place and keep
coming."
Advocates of more alcohol options on campus
may be surprised to learn that only 35 percent of
The 750's revenue comes from alcohol. Food and

soft drink purchases make up the majority of
sales. The pub offers beer, wine and sake,
with no plans to obtain a liquor license to
serve hard alcohol.
"[Mixed drinks] were not part of the
deal," Carrubba said. "The University want
ed a beer and wine place."
Beer and wine seem to be the norm at
other alcohol-serving establishments across
campus, including the Treehouse and the
Cool Cafe at the Cantor Arts Center. The

Treehouse sells 20 to 30 pitchers of beer on an av
erage night, according to assistant manager Eduar
do Cesana. The Cool Cafe also sells 20 to 30 glass
es of wine and 60 to 70 beers a day, with students
purchasing a large majority of the beers, said man
ager Liliana Gonzalez.
Even so, businesses like the CoHo stopped serv
ing beer at the end of the summer. One employee
speculated that Stanford Dining wanted to change
the atmosphere of the establishment. And the like
lihood of one sitting down for a glass of wine at the
bookstore cafe also looks slim with Store Director
Ken Bowers citing licensing difficulties, Stanford
policy issues and lack of interest.
"I'm not so sure our hours are conducive to [al
cohol service]," Bowers said. "And 1 wonder if
there would be enough demand to warrant all the
time and effort."
While alcohol service in the new Old Union re
mains a possibility, outgoing ASSU Vice President
and senior Aneto Okonkwo predicted that there
will be many University concerns with the likeli-

hood of another campus bar. Barriers in
clude liability issues, the use of prime real
estate in the center of campus for an
other pub and the worry over stu
dents getting out of control.
"It's unclear whether this is a
good thing for students," Okonkwo
said. "Not many undergraduates are
of drinking age so who's going to be

While students are generally positive about The 750, pictured above, enthusiasm is more muted to the question of more on-cam
pus pubs and alcohol joints.
