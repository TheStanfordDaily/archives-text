# RESEARCH GRANTS
## Stem cell funding still in limbo While the first $1.2 million is secured, will the rest follow? 
### ANDREA FULLER STAFF WRITER 
As the University moves to utilize its
$1.2 million grant for stim cell research
training from the California Institute for
Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) — the
first of three annual installments to come
— the promise of additional funding still
hangs in legal limbo.
A $3.7 million grant in total, the cur
rent fund makes up a portion of the $12.1
million CIRM will use to train 169 stu
dents at California universities studying

stem cell biology.
The Independent Citizens Oversight
Committee (ICOC), which oversees
CIRM. approved training grant applica
tions last September to graduate students
as well as post-doctoral and clinical schol
ars. The grants set up funding for training,
including mandatory courses in stem cell
biology and disease as well as the social,
legal and ethical implications of research.
"These are training grants, so the
money will be spent in training people to
do this research," Greely said. "1 believe
that applications for the fellowships for
this training will go out soon."
Associate Professor of Pediatrics and
Genetics David Magnus, the author of the
grant's ethics section, emphasized that the

grant will not fund research. "This
is not a research grant," he said. "The first
grants issued were not for research, but for
training. Before we can spend a lot of
money" on research, we need researchers to
receive the money and not many people
have been trained to do stem cell research.
Part of training would include lab tech
niques and basic science, but it would also
include some regulatory knowledge and
ethics training."
Magnus emphasized the importance of
a sold ethics background.
"It was required that ethics be included
as a component to produce the next gener
ation of stem cell researchers," he said.

Stanford plans to utilize its federal stem cell
research grant to focus on training scholars
to be holistic researchers.
Christopher Scott, executive di
rector of the Stanford Program on
Stem Cells and Society, championed
the grants' emphasis on other areas
besides science.
"The grants have provisions to
teach students and scholars in areas
of ethics, public policy and law," he
said. "I think it's important that re
searchers who learn about the sci
ence also learn about other dimen
sions of stem cell biology."
CIRM was established in 2004
with California's passing of Proposi
tion 71, which finances $3 billion
over the next 10 years for research.
According to Scott, conservative
groups are still challenging the legal
ity of the measure.
"Two original lawsuits have been
rolled into one, and that complaint is
being heard by the State Superior

Court,"he said. "One of the plain
tiffs is [a group of] religious conser
vatives who were behind the Terry
Schiavo case and the other group
are anti-tax conservatives who take
the position that the [CIRM] doesn't
have sufficient state oversight. In
other words, a state organization
with state employees should distrib
ute state funds."
According to Law School Prof.
Hank Greely.the outcome is still un
clear. "The trial of the consoli
dated lawsuits ended six weeks ago,"
he said. "We are all awaiting the
judge's ruling."
Meanwhile, CIRM has been able
to frontload the first batch of install
ments through the release of bond
anticipation notes and philanthro
pists' donations.
"Bond council won't agree to the
sale of bonds at the lower standard
rates as long as there's a risk that
Proposition 71 will be overturned."
Magnus said. "So the litigation has
essentially successfully slowed down
the ability to sell the bonds that

would fund research. The initial
hearing at the legal level has already
taken place and everyone has been
waiting weeks for the decision to
come down."
Scott said that bond notes hold
no guarantee in reimbursement.
"Robert Klein, the chair of the
ICOC has had to raise bridge fund
ing by selling bond anticipatory
notes on the hope there will be a fa
vorable ruling by the Superior
Court,"he said. "The sale notes
come with no guarantee. If the law
suit is settled in favor of the plain
tiffs. then [the purchasers are) out of
their money. If the lawsuit is settled
in favor of CI RM, then the money is
repaid as soon as the bonds are is
sued."
Despite his belief that Prop. 71
will succeed in the courts, Magnus
worried that funds may be delayed
even longer.
"Most people are optimistic
given pre-trial rulings that the deci
sion will favor Proposition 71, but
we won't know for sure until the de

cision is actually rendered. We ex
pect the opponents will file an ap
peal, but how long they will succeed
in delaying, we don't know."
Magnus said that Stanford and
CIRM have no way of knowing
when more funds will be available.
"It's possible that bond council
would say this is clearly going to fly
and that decision could come next
week," he said. "On the other hand,
bond council could say i want to
wait until it runs its course through
the California Supreme Court' —
and it could run for a round of ap
peals. It could be delayed for anoth
er 12 to 15 months."
However, Scott remained opti
mistic that Prop. 71 will succeed in
the end.
"The lawyers that I talk to say the
suit is likely to be settled in favor of
the Proposition 71 proponents," he
said. "On the basis of that predic
tion, the Institute has been success
ful in raising this bridge funding. So.
both of those things seem to work in
favor of the lawsuit being settled."

Meanwhile, CIRM has been able
to frontload the first batch of install
ments through the release of bond
anticipation notes and philanthro
pists' donations.
"Bond council won't agree to the
sale of bonds at the lower standard
rates as long as there's a risk that
Proposition 71 will be overturned."
Magnus said. "So the litigation has
essentially successfully slowed down
the ability to sell the bonds that

would fund research. The initial
hearing at the legal level has already
taken place and everyone has been
waiting weeks for the decision to
come down."
Scott said that bond notes hold
no guarantee in reimbursement.
"Robert Klein, the chair of the
ICOC has had to raise bridge fund
ing by selling bond anticipatory
notes on the hope there will be a fa
vorable ruling by the Superior
Court,"he said. "The sale notes
come with no guarantee. If the law
suit is settled in favor of the plain
tiffs. then [the purchasers are) out of
their money. If the lawsuit is settled
in favor of CI RM, then the money is
repaid as soon as the bonds are is
sued."
Despite his belief that Prop. 71
will succeed in the courts, Magnus
worried that funds may be delayed
even longer.
"Most people are optimistic
given pre-trial rulings that the deci
sion will favor Proposition 71, but
we won't know for sure until the de

cision is actually rendered. We ex
pect the opponents will file an ap
peal, but how long they will succeed
in delaying, we don't know."
Magnus said that Stanford and
CIRM have no way of knowing
when more funds will be available.
"It's possible that bond council
would say this is clearly going to fly
and that decision could come next
week," he said. "On the other hand,
bond council could say i want to
wait until it runs its course through
the California Supreme Court' —
and it could run for a round of ap
peals. It could be delayed for anoth
er 12 to 15 months."
However, Scott remained opti
mistic that Prop. 71 will succeed in
the end.
"The lawyers that I talk to say the
suit is likely to be settled in favor of
the Proposition 71 proponents," he
said. "On the basis of that predic
tion, the Institute has been success
ful in raising this bridge funding. So.
both of those things seem to work in
favor of the lawsuit being settled."
