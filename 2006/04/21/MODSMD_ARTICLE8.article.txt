## Stem cell funding still in limbo While the first $1.2 million is secured, will the rest follow? 
### ANDREA FULLER STAFF WRITER 
As the University moves to utilize its
$1.2 million grant for stim cell research
training from the California Institute for
Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) — the
first of three annual installments to come
— the promise of additional funding still
hangs in legal limbo.
A $3.7 million grant in total, the cur
rent fund makes up a portion of the $12.1
million CIRM will use to train 169 stu
dents at California universities studying

stem cell biology.
The Independent Citizens Oversight
Committee (ICOC), which oversees
CIRM. approved training grant applica
tions last September to graduate students
as well as post-doctoral and clinical schol
ars. The grants set up funding for training,
including mandatory courses in stem cell
biology and disease as well as the social,
legal and ethical implications of research.
"These are training grants, so the
money will be spent in training people to
do this research," Greely said. "1 believe
that applications for the fellowships for
this training will go out soon."
Associate Professor of Pediatrics and
Genetics David Magnus, the author of the
grant's ethics section, emphasized that the

grant will not fund research. "This
is not a research grant," he said. "The first
grants issued were not for research, but for
training. Before we can spend a lot of
money" on research, we need researchers to
receive the money and not many people
have been trained to do stem cell research.
Part of training would include lab tech
niques and basic science, but it would also
include some regulatory knowledge and
ethics training."
Magnus emphasized the importance of
a sold ethics background.
"It was required that ethics be included
as a component to produce the next gener
ation of stem cell researchers," he said.

Stanford plans to utilize its federal stem cell
research grant to focus on training scholars
to be holistic researchers.
