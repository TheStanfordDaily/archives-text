# FACULTY SENATE
## Faculty flesh out 2010 admissions 
### LESLIE GEORGATOS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Well-timed considering the thou
sands of prospective freshman on
campus for Admit Weekend, new
Dean of Admissions Rick Shaw pro
vided insight into how Stanford se
lected the Class of 2010 and shared
his vision for the future of the admis
sions process at yesterday's meeting
of the Faculty Senate.
Shaw first addressed the upward
trend in applications. Stanford re
ceived a record 22,322 applications
and has accepted 2,430 prospective
students â€” a record-low admissions
rate below 11 percent. The increased
competitiveness inherent in such a
frenzy of applications left some won
dering about what goes into the selec
tion process.
"In the past, decisions were very
individualized, with one person read
ing and passing competitive applica
tions up the line all the way to the
dean, who had a major role in the ad
missions decisions," Shaw said.
The dean said that under the new
system, territory managers play a
larger role. They are expected to un
derstand their assigned region and its
schools and forward competitive can
didates to seasonal readers. Appli
cants are scored in a variety of areas,
then sent up for committee discus
sion.
"This is a democracy," Shaw said.
"There is great opportunity for dis
cussion of relevant qualifications, for
checks and balances and for having
more eyes on the process."
Applicants are first evaluated on
their high school academic programs,
according to the rigor of their classes,
grades and class standing. Scorers
also concentrate on the candidates'
testing pattern on the SAT or ACT
and sometimes on optional SAT lis.

Further criteria based on personal
qualities involve non-academic ac
complishments, the student's self
presentation, recommendations from
teachers and counselors and personal
strengths, such as overcoming pover
ty and adversity.
Readers also look for an unquan
tifiable quality that Shaw termed "in
tellectual vitality."
"We want applicants with passion,
depth and breadth beyond the aca
demic experience, who learn and en
gage in the subject material with ma
turity," Shaw said. "Students should
demonstrate intellectual curiosity as
well as authentic and highly devel
oped thinking. They should experi
ment creatively, read deeply and cre
ate energetically."
Shaw emphasized that it is not
only a candidates' numbers that
make the cut.
"The vast majority of candidates
are competitive on quantitative
measures, but the other categories for
evaluation, in a holistic review, deter
mine the decisions we make," Shaw
said.
Shaw closed by outlining his di
versity-focused plan for next year's
admissions. He plans to travel around
the country with other colleges like
Georgetown and Harvard in the "Ex
ploring College Options" program
during the spring and fall, reach out
to alumni to build a volunteer base
corps for outreach and work to reach
low-income communities more effec
tively.
"We enjoyed a 10 percent increase
in interest in Stanford this year, but
we want to build on that," he said.
"We will carry the flag of national and
international diversity and work hard
to develop relationships among the
national alumni association, Stanford
