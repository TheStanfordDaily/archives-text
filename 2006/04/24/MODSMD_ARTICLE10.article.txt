# Dick and Jane are confused
## 
### 
Notre Dame's president has reversed his
previous denunciation of the show and
has decided to allow "The Vagina
Monologues" on campus. I write this column
while wearing a party hat. He disagrees with
some of its portrayals of sex and thinks some
of the show's content runs in direct conflict
with the Catholic mission of the University.
Feminism,homosexuality and sex before mar
riage, some may argue, also run in direct con
flict with the mission of a Catholic university.
But honestly, it is a university where stu
dents do have sex. where women are empow
ered, where homosexuality exists. I believe
that college is the best place to open up dis
cussion on such subjects. If not at a university,
where else should "The Vagina Monologues"
be performed? Personally I wasn't a big fan of
my elementary school's rendition of the show.
The fifth grade version of the dominatrix was
hardly convincing and seven-year-old Benny
Turner's declaration of "I'm your Bob" was
not commanding.
"The Vagina Monologues" was controver
sial 10 years ago. To speak out about it now is
kind of like suddenly condemning Clinton's
infidelities.
I believe colleges are supposed to promote
discussion and offer up different sides to is
sues. Therefore, you'd think Notre Dame
would be more receptive to this different
point of view. Or maybe — like say people in
Kansas — they like to pretend the other
point of view doesn't exist.
Right now, Kansas school boards are con
sidering switching to abstinence-only sexual
education programs, which they believe will
help cut down on teen pregnancy. They be
lieve that teaching kids to deny their urges
until they marry — at which point, they will
figure out that neither of them is any good at
it — will lead to happier and healthier soci
eties. After years of repression and waiting,
Dick and Jane will awkwardly watch sex-ed
videos meant for 15-year-olds and ultimately
go on Dr. Phil, claiming that they are both gay
but staying together for the kids. I feel like the
American thing to do is to stand outside absti
nence-only schools and distribute porn, lo
tion and best wishes.
I'm forever baffled by the argument
against teaching about contraceptives in
schools. I went to a public elementary and
junior high school, and starting in fifth grade,
the boys were separated and shown one video
while the girls were shown another. Ours was
called "Am I normal?" which featured a con
fused 12-year-old asking everyone in his com
munity if his penis size was normal.The movie
ended in an emotional scene involving a sen
sitive zookeeper telling him about the sizes of
various members of the animal kingdom. So
don't get me wrong, sex ed will fuck you up.
But not teaching it is even worse.
I went to a Catholic all-boys high school
for a year. Freshman year, I sat and watched

as my classmates were taught sex-ed for the
first time. They were taught abstinence,
whereas in my public school by eighth grade,
1 received good marks in my condom balloon
animal class. Contraceptives were not dis
cussed in my freshman class, but then again,
neither was a woman's right to choose. The
class was taught by a born-again Christian
who actually believed kissing before mar
riage was a sin. This, sadly, I'm not exaggerat
ing. His version of sex education revolved
around guilt and repression, throwing a cur
tain and an "it's sinful" over a whole part of
growing up. His students, not surprisingly, had
difficulty learning how to interact with
women in college.
But instead of outlawing sexual education,
what if we had more sex in schools? Think
about it, what's a better way to get kids inter
ested and ready to go to school day after day?
Sex. Lots of it. Teach it in every single class,
not just this stupid health thing. The biology
of sex. By focusing on friction issues, we have
the "physics of sex." In our language classes,
we can teach kids how to pick up drunk col
lege students in any language. Most of the
time, we will teach them words that sound
sexy but don't really mean anything and will
probably get you laid by stupid people. "Oh,
you sound so foreign."
Of course, then we have gym:"partner up."
It brings a whole new level of humiliation to
being picked last. Let's not forget math. "If
Billy takes Jean out to dinner and pays $ 1 (X).
he can expect Jean to go to base." Prob
lem solving skills our kids need.
Perhaps my solution is a bit extreme. But
then again, for an educational institution to
demonizc or ignore sex is much worse. Maybe
the students should decide how they want to
be educated. Notre Dame's president recant
ing an attack on "The Vagina Monologues" is
a step in the right direction, or perhaps mere
ly prevents a step backwards. Having Kansas
school's decide that kids are too stupid to be
offered the choice of abstinence or protected
sex is definitely a step in the wrong direction.
Yet, when one is confronted by the actions of
adult members of the Kansas school board,
maybe their offspring really is that dumb.

Chris is curious if people think the made-up el
ementary school "The Vagina Monologues"
image is scarier than the real-life "Am I nor
mal?" video Send complaints to cholt@stan

Perhaps my solution is a bit extreme. But
then again, for an educational institution to
demonizc or ignore sex is much worse. Maybe
the students should decide how they want to
be educated. Notre Dame's president recant
ing an attack on "The Vagina Monologues" is
a step in the right direction, or perhaps mere
ly prevents a step backwards. Having Kansas
school's decide that kids are too stupid to be
offered the choice of abstinence or protected
sex is definitely a step in the wrong direction.
Yet, when one is confronted by the actions of
adult members of the Kansas school board,
maybe their offspring really is that dumb.

Chris is curious if people think the made-up el
ementary school "The Vagina Monologues"
image is scarier than the real-life "Am I nor
mal?" video Send complaints to cholt@stan
