# The
						story of a protest
## 
### 
On Friday, the day of Bush's visit, hun
dreds of college students in need of a
bath and a good shave gathered to do
what they do best: whine. Protesters shouted
passionately for hours until they were con
vinced they had made a difference. Though
the protest hasn't managed to withdraw our
troops from Iraq yet, it did manage to with
draw the president from our campus —
which I feel was a battle worth winning. After
all. who is the president to invade our campus
and ruin our Admit Weekend programming?
Members of the Admit Weekend staff had
been planning events since October, and one
little whim of our commander-in-chief
screwed it all up. Bush should understand
that it's more important for ProFros to at
tend academic expos than it is for him to
meet in some room cloudy with cigar smoke
and the smell of money. If anything, I think
the protesters should have been complaining
about the inconveniencing barricades that
were placed all over campus because of his
visit. This showed that Bush really doesn't
care about the general population. 1 mean. 1
had to bike ALL the way around Encina Hall
to get to the protest. That cost me an extra
three or four minutes at least. What's next
Bush, cuts to welfare and social security?
But to play devil's advocate, I will admit

that the snipers on campus were pretty cool.
How often do you get the chance to he mor
tally threatened if you make the slightest
wrong move (besides when you hike through
the Intersection of Death)? Also, seeing the
military helicopters fly overhead was excit
ing. 1 can see why people join the Air Force
— it would he sweet to fly around in one of
those on a regular basis.
There were some who denounced the en
tire idea of protesting during Bush's visit. 1
can only wonder what kind of reception
these people would have wanted to give the
leader of our nation. Cheers? Applause? Per
haps a commemorative plaque and gift bas
ket? Come on, this guy is from Texas.
Also, I extend my deepest congratulations
to the three morons who got arrested for
blocking the fire truck on its way to Hoover
Tower. Yeah, you showed him. Bush is so

used to being protested against that your lit
tle stunt had about as much significance as
letting another illegal immigrant into Cali
fornia. I'll bet he felt really bad about having
his meeting with Shultz over dinner instead
of before dinner. Way to stick it to the man.
Really though. Bush's retreat shows just
how unqualified he is to be commander-in
chief. If he couldn't even muster the strength
and diplomacy to move three college stu
dents, how is he supposed to convert an en
tire totalitarian regime into a democracy?
Granted, he'll be useful when we're execut
ing war criminals, but winning in the Middle
East will take more than that.
Overall, the protest was a success. We may
not see any relevant political effect, but that's
beside the point. Protests aren't really about
making change so much as they are about
convincing the masses that they have the
ability to make change. Rest well, fine war
riors of our grand blue state, and sheath your
glorious picket signs that you might use them
another day. We won the battle, but we are
still at war.
