Protesters should be prosecuted
I think it is important to distinguish be
tween peaceful protest that is protected by
the First Amendment and disruptive action
designed to thwart legal activity.
When protesters block roads in order to
stop the president from arriving on campus,
their actions are no different than those of
anti-abortion zealots who block doctors and
women from entering clinics. Physically
blocking access is not speech and is not pro
tected by the First Amendment.
The net effect of a few disruptive protest
ers was that the meeting location was moved
away from central campus to protect the
safety of the president. Those that blocked
the roads should be embarrassed — and like
anti-abortion zealots who block access to
clinics — they should be prosecuted for their
actions.

Community supports protests
The Stanford and Palo Alto community
that supports peace and justice is to be con
gratulated for keeping George W. Bush off

the campus on Friday. Bush is a criminal who
belongs in prison, not on a university campus.
The Hoover Institute is an embarrassment to
anyone who believes in objective scholarship
and should be cast out as well.

Stanford should welcome all visitors
As an alumnus and neighbor of Stanford
University, I was disappointed and ashamed
of the way the University and its students
treated the president of the United States
when he was scheduled to be a guest of the
Hoover Institution on campus.
As a great university, Stanford regularly
has a variety of visitors, from whom much can
be learned. Their views may be considered
conservative, liberal, radical or even off the
charts, but the school and its students benefit
from having them come and they have a right
to express their views when here.
Some or all may disagree with the views of
a particular individual, but that does not con
done rude behavior or the blocking of some
building or portion of the campus so that the
visitor is denied entrance.
The University experience should provide

much more than just increased knowledge
and education, hut afford the opportunity to
encounter other individuals with different
backgrounds, cultures and beliefs to enable
one's views to be broadened and enriched.
Welcome ALL Stanford visitors. Give
them a chance to express themselves. Listen
to what they have to say. Thank them for tak
ing time to come. Consider what you have
heard as a part of your learning experience.
If these visitors from all walks to life are
prevented from appearing or are not allowed
to speak, they will stop coming, and both
Stanford and its students will have lost a
valuable resource.

Protesters deserve thanks
In regards to the student protest to
George W. Bush's visit: THANK YOU! I
speak for myself, but I feel like 1 speak for the
world in saying WE ARE PROUD OF YOU
for standing up to this administration and
their failed, corrupt policies.
