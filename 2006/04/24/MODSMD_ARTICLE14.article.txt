# CAMPUS EVENTS
## Economists, Westly talk energy policy 
### BEN EPPLER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As protestors rallied at Hoover Tower to
demonstrate against President George W.
Bush's visit to the Stanford campus, a more
sober discussion about national energy poli
cy took place three streets away.
Economists, California business luminar
ies and the leading Democratic gubernatori
al candidate gathered at the Schwab Center
Friday to discuss the economics of energy
solutions at the Stanford Institute for Eco
nomics Policy Research's (SIEPR) first Pol
icy Forum.
Titled "Prosperity Despite Expensive
Oil: Energy Solutions for California, Ameri
ca, and the World," the forum lasted all day
and featured talks from economics and engi
neering professors from Stanford, the Naval
Postgraduate School and UC-Davis.The ac
ademics were joined by business innovators,
including Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod
Khosla and former eßay Vice President and
state controller Steve Westly — who could
challenge Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in
the next election.
The conference emphasized both eco
nomic and environmental aspects of energy
production and use. UC-Davis Mechanical
and Aerospace Engineering Prof. Andrew
Frank noted that oil prices have doubled in
the last three years, while Stanford Environ
mental and Resource Economics Prof.
Lawrence Goulder said that 99 percent of se
rious climatologists believe that human ac
tivity is the foremost cause of the current
global temperature spike.
But speakers also emphasized that envi
ronmental and economic concerns need not
be mutually exclusive. Westly called these
forced decisions "false choices."
The talks focused on a variety of possible
approaches to the energy crisis, debating the
merits and drawbacks of nuclear, solar and
wind power generation, along with new trans
portation solutions such as ethanol, hydrogen
and electric vehicles.
"I'm very sorry President Bush hasn't
stopped by here today, because Lord knows
he needs to," said Westly, referring to per
ceived federal government inaction on ener

gy problems.
Goulder agreed, pointing out that states
like California — which recently mandated
ambitious emission reduction targets for the
coming decades — are now leading the
charge to reform energy policy.
Westly confirmed Goulder's statement
by unveiling his new Solar Success Initia
tive during his speech to the conference.
The plan would reduce restrictions on in
stalling solar panels, allow solar producers
to sell their excess power back to the grid
and compel utilities to participate in solar
programs.
"Where Washington has failed, the world
is looking to California to lead," he said.
Though optimistic about power solutions
in California, speakers emphasized the need
for a more coherent national energy policy.
Goulder noted that current legislation is full
of incentives for companies to experiment
with alternative energy sources, but lacks ac
tual goals that would force companies to re
duce their reliance on expensive, high-emis
sion fossil fuels.
"The most effective climate policy is
going to need to involve sticks as well as car
rots," he said.
Khosla wrapped up the event with an
hour-long presentation calling for govern
ment action to make ethanol a replacement
fuel for gasoline, noting that conversion to a
liquid fuel like ethanol would be far simpler
than other transportation proposals. He said
that the existing distribution infrastructure
of gas stations could be easily converted to
ethanol, adding that because ethanol is
made from biomass, its adoption as a fuel
source would be a boon to America's strug
gling agriculture industry.
"Mideast terrorism or Midwest farmers,
who do we want to give money to?" he
asked.
Khosla proposed government mandates
that 70 percent of new automobiles be Flex-
Fuel Vehicles capable of running on ethanol
and gasoline and mandating that one in 10
gas stations sell a fuel mixture with 85 per
cent ethanol.
"Alternative fuels do not have to be alter-
native," he said. "They can be main
stream."
The forum drew a fluctuating
crowd throughout the day, swelling
to upwards of 150 during Westly's

speech, despite the demonstrations
occurring at the same time.
"Even while the protests are going
on, I think that more can be done
through energy than through holding
up one more sign," said Juliet Rothen
berg, a freshman majoring in manage
ment science and engineering.
The conference was marked by a
tone of optimism despite emphasis
on the current crisis.

"If you've got a plug in car and a
solar panel on your roof, you're sud
denly a micro-PG&E," said Ward
Hansen, SIEPR forum director.
"And the good news is, it makes eco
nomic sense."
The energy policy forum was the
first of a series of SIEPR-sponsored
forums. The next will take place in
the fall and concern education,
Hansen said.
