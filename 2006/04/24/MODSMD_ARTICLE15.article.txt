# PROTEST FORCES PRESIDENT TO MOVE HOOVER MEETING
## JUST STOPPING BY 
### 
A normal afternoon was whipped into a whirlwind on Friday as
President George W. Bush paid a visit to the Stanford campus.
Protesters exchanged plesantries with police, helicopters whirred
above Hoover Tower, and ProFros anxiously looked on as the
usually subdued campus showed its political side.


FRIEND OR FOE: Before his visit to Stanford, Bush met Schwarzenegger at Cisco Systems for a discussion of America's economic future. The two have not always seen eye to eye since the governor came to power in 2003.
