## MEN'S GOLF Junior beats emotional struggles New mental approach helps Miller out of sophomore slump 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES STAFF WRITER 
In a sport where the game highs come
from the scoring lows, junior Zack Miller is
working to reconcile his own highs and lows.
Especially as he and the Cardinal men's golf
team enter the Pac-10 Championship, today
through Wednesday at the Big Horn Country
Club in Palm Desert, Calif.
Like the Stanford squad, which has
grabbed four top-five finishes in the spring
after a disappointing fall. Miller has gradually
proven himself a potent force. It would be
easy to focus on Miller's recent game highs —
including a second-place finish at the Ash
worth Intercollegiate — but after a disap
pointing sophomore year, the junior's greater
focus is on decreasing the mental lows he
faces.
In his freshman year. Miller easily made
the transition from junior to collegiate golf.
With a team-low 72.9 stroke average and five
top-10 finishes, he was a second-team All Pac
-10 selection. But in his second year. Miller en
countered a slump.
"I made the transition from junior golf
pretty successfully, but it made it that much
more frustrating because I had big expecta
tions going into sophomore year," Miller said.
"I underachieved and didn't accomplish most
of the goals I had for that year."
A 73.6 stroke average and only one top-10
finish was a step in the wrong direction for
Miller. Though slipping in his technical game,
Miller was more notably slipping in his men
tal game.
"I was very emotional on the golf course,"
he said, i would wear my emotions on my
sleeve, and use them the incorrect way. My
emotions were getting in my way, and it was
n't helpful to my golf game, nor the team."
Stroke by stroke, round by round. Miller's
play fluctuated with momentary success and
failure. After the highs of a successful fresh
man year, the smaller-scale lows he was expe
riencing among singular strokes led to larger
lows.
"It was a snowball effect," Miller said. "I'd
be upset I missed a putt on the previous hole,
but then I d carry that anger to the next.That's
an important thing on the mental side of golf:
Once something bad happens, you have to
look past it and get over it, and I wasn't doing
that."
Reliant on his mental approach to golf.
Miller's focus on his disappointments shroud
ed his efforts to simply improve.
"I was expecting too much and not just
playing," he said. "I was worrying too much
about results and not about how I'm doing
myself."
With disappointment after disappoint
ment, though. Miller knew something had to
change. I Ie and head coach Conrad Ray dis
cussed. and Miller identified his mental ap
proach as the root of his sophomore slump.
And so this past summer and fall. Miller
dedicated himself to making a positive turn
around. Constantly reminding himself that
once a shot was done, he had to move on to
the next without regret. Miller went through a
maturing process that Ray especially has no
ticed.
"His attitude's much better on the course,"
Ray said. "He's managing his anger and frus
tration after bad shots, which makes him bet
ter prepared to get the good ones."
Miller also feels he has caught on to the im
portance of his mental approach, and in a
cycle of positive feedback, it's become easier
and easier to improve.
"Once I was able to detach myself from
getting angry and upset, I started playing bet
ter." he said. "And once I started playing bet
ter, it made it easier to not get upset."
Now, for Miller, achieving success has
come down to execution. Mentally and tech
nically prepared, he said he's ready "to make
waves" along with the rest of the Cardinal in
the postseason.
The Big Horn Country Club is the first
place to do that. After placing sixth in last
year's tournament, the Cardinal look to peak,
much as they did last year around this time.
Iliey also hope to improve against teams like
No. 5 UCLA and Southern California. Stan
ford has already proven its ability to stay com
petitive with its SoCal opponents.
"The team is ready and primed for the Pac
-10," said sophomore Rob Grube, who placed
four th individually last year. "We simply need
to execute our strategy at the appropriate
time — that's the defining characteristic of all
championship teams."
ITie team woiked last week on its short
game, preparing for a course different from
those recently played on. being dry, fast and
prone to birdies. The Cardinal have been
preparing all season and with individual im
provements across the board, including those
by Miller, the team is confident it can accom
plish its championship goals.
"Every week we continue to get better and
have a better chance, so hopefully that's set
ting the stage for some great things at the Pac
-10," Ray said.
