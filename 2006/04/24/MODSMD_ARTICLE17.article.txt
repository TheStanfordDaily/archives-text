# Falling Behind
## Stanford baseball falls to last place in Pac-10 standings, 17-17 record 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Before their trip to Arizona this
past weekend, the Cardinal were dig
ging themselves into a hole. Stanford
had dropped its last four games and
was tunneling its way into the Pac-10
cellar. A 10-6 win on Friday night and
an offensive surge, however, gave the
team a breath of fresh air.
But in the seventh inning of yes
terday's game, the Cardinal (17-17,3-
9 Pac-10) found themselves in the
same hole — dug a little deeper.
A 14-4 loss forced Stanford into
the rubber match of a three-game se
ries for the fifth time this season.
And, in that rubber game, the Cardi
nal fell 12-3 to the Wildcats (17-20.5-
7) yesterday to fall to last-place in the
Pac-10.
"It's not the sort of thing we're
used to," junior centerfielder Ryan
Seawell said of the team's league cel
lar dwelling. "Last place is not Stan
ford baseball. There's not much you
can do about it except keep working
hard and hope it turns around for
you."
Arizona did the brunt of its dam
age in that key seventh inning, taking
advantage of two Cardinal fielding
errors to load the bases, send nine
men to the plate and score five runs.
It was the fifth consecutive game in
which Stanford committed an error.
"Our fielding has had a lot to do
with our success in the past," said
Seawell, adding that Stanford had
been in the top-10 in fielding per
centage in past years. "We're also
coming in to work on fielding. It'll
come around,"
The Cardinal were done in by a
season-high four errors on Sunday, a
lackluster day at the plate (including
three double-plays and just three
hits) and shaky pitching from the
bullpen.
The day was quite different from
Friday's series' opener. Six Stanford
players had multi-hit games, senior
pitcher Greg Reynolds (3-3) picked
up his third win and sophomore
righthander David Stringer (2-2) got
his first save.
For a few minutes Friday, it
looked like Stanford would continue
sliding in the wrong direction. Down
6-5 heading into the sixth, however,
freshman Brent Milleville — who
finished 3-for-5 with a homerun —
led off with a double. Seawell — 3-
for-6 with two RBI on Friday —
brought him home with a double, and

ADRIAN GAITAN/The Stanford Daily
Senior shortstop Chris Minaker had two hits in yesterday's game. Despite his five hits this
weekend, the Cardinal were easily outscored by Arizona, 26-7, Saturday and Sunday.
three singles later, the Cardinal were
on top 8-6.
Preston Guilmet (2-5) took the
loss in an outing that lasted six in
nings and saw a once-again confi
dent Cardinal offense notch 13 hits.
"We've been coming in early in
the morning trying to get extra work
in the cages," said Seawell, who had a
hit in each of this weekend's games.
"We had a couple setbacks on Satur
day."
Indeed. Arizona's Travis Peep
and David Plante each went 3-for-4
on Saturday, and teammate Bill
Rhinehart did the heaviest damage
with three RBIs. Though Stanford
had eight hits, it wasn't enough to

compete with the action all over the
Arizona lineup.
Arizona scored eight unanswered
runs over the final five innings, in
cluding a seven-run eighth. Brad
Mills (4-3) earned the win. scattering
seven hits over six innings and strik
ing out five. Freshman lefthander Je
remy Bleich took the loss in his sec
ond career start. He came off the
mound after giving up three runs in
the fifth.
The Wildcats carried their mo
mentum into Sunday. Arizona
scored one run in the third, fourth
and fifth, hut the Cardinal stayed
close, scoring two in the top of the
sixth to trail just 3-2. But Arizona
added three more runs to open the
floodgates.
Stanford starter Matt Manship
(1-5) came out after giving up a sin
gle and walk with one out in the
sixth. Then Stringer came in, only to

give up an RBI single and Colt Sed
brook's two-run triple to left field to
put Arizona up 6-3.
Stanford got a double, a walk and
an RBI single from senior shortstop
Chris Minaker in its half of the sev
enth, but that was the last hurrah for
the Stanford offense. Arizona then
exploded in the seventh behind the
bats of Rhinehart, Sedbrook, Brad
Boyer and Konrad Schmidt.
Stanford now readies itself for a
TUesday night visit to Santa Clara
(22-18). With 55 hits, 19 RBI and a
.367 average, freshman Matt Long
leads the Broncos. Meanwhile, Stan
ford's team batting average stands at
.266 — and its team ERA has
jumped to 4.60.
Even so, the Card have fared well
in weekday games, will be favored
tomorrow, and will look to use the
match to get over .500 and start their
long climb out of the Pac-10 hole.
