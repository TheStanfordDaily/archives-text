## Stanford baseball falls to last place in Pac-10 standings, 17-17 record 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Before their trip to Arizona this
past weekend, the Cardinal were dig
ging themselves into a hole. Stanford
had dropped its last four games and
was tunneling its way into the Pac-10
cellar. A 10-6 win on Friday night and
an offensive surge, however, gave the
team a breath of fresh air.
But in the seventh inning of yes
terday's game, the Cardinal (17-17,3-
9 Pac-10) found themselves in the
same hole — dug a little deeper.
A 14-4 loss forced Stanford into
the rubber match of a three-game se
ries for the fifth time this season.
And, in that rubber game, the Cardi
nal fell 12-3 to the Wildcats (17-20.5-
7) yesterday to fall to last-place in the
Pac-10.
"It's not the sort of thing we're
used to," junior centerfielder Ryan
Seawell said of the team's league cel
lar dwelling. "Last place is not Stan
ford baseball. There's not much you
can do about it except keep working
hard and hope it turns around for
you."
Arizona did the brunt of its dam
age in that key seventh inning, taking
advantage of two Cardinal fielding
errors to load the bases, send nine
men to the plate and score five runs.
It was the fifth consecutive game in
which Stanford committed an error.
"Our fielding has had a lot to do
with our success in the past," said
Seawell, adding that Stanford had
been in the top-10 in fielding per
centage in past years. "We're also
coming in to work on fielding. It'll
come around,"
The Cardinal were done in by a
season-high four errors on Sunday, a
lackluster day at the plate (including
three double-plays and just three
hits) and shaky pitching from the
bullpen.
The day was quite different from
Friday's series' opener. Six Stanford
players had multi-hit games, senior
pitcher Greg Reynolds (3-3) picked
up his third win and sophomore
righthander David Stringer (2-2) got
his first save.
For a few minutes Friday, it
looked like Stanford would continue
sliding in the wrong direction. Down
6-5 heading into the sixth, however,
freshman Brent Milleville — who
finished 3-for-5 with a homerun —
led off with a double. Seawell — 3-
for-6 with two RBI on Friday —
brought him home with a double, and
