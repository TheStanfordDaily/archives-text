# Women earn 19th league title
## 
### 
If doing something 19 times tends to
become repetitive, don't tell the Stan
ford women's tennis team. On Saturday,
the squad defeated California 7-0 to
capture its 19th Pac-10 title this past
weekend. The team also tallied its 16th
shutout of the season.
Senior Alice Barnes and junior Anne
Yelsey, who make up the top-ranked
duo in the nation, defeated Cal's No. 13
tandem of Suzi Babos and Zsuzsanna
Fodor, 8-2.
Sophomore Celia Durkin and senior
Amber Liu kept the doubles victories
for the Cardinal rolling with an 8-4 win
over Bojana Bobusic and Stephanie Ku
sano. With the third doubles pair—•
Lejla Hodzic and Jessica Nguyen —
taking the 8-2 win on court three, the
Cardinal completed the sweep.
Singles play was just as successful for
the Card, as No. 7 Barnes easily defeat
ed Babos, 6-2, 6-1. Durkin and No. 17
Liu also won their matches, with Liu
pulling an upset win over No. 8 Fodor.
Stanford swept singles play as well,
and the only big challenge a Cardinal
player faced came when No. 48 Whitney
Deason, in the No. 5 spot, took the first
set from Cristina Visico, 6-2 before
dropping the second set 4-6. Deason
took the tiebreaker 10-7.
Stanford finished a perfect 24-0 in
the regular season and 8-0 in the confer
ence. The squad has now won an
NCAA-record 80 straight overall and
96 straight at home.
Pac-10 Individuals now await the
Cardinal, April 27 to 30.
