### AMIT ARORA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Although President George W. Bush was scheduled
to meet with fellows at the Hoover Institution on Fri
day, the presence of more than 1,000 protestors forced
him to change his plans and meet with advisers and fac
ulty members at the residence of former Secretary of
State and Hoover Fellow George Shultz on the out
skirts of the Stanford campus.
More than 1(X) armed law enforcement and Secret
Service officers lined the streets outside of Encina
Commons, as students, parents, faculty members and
local residents protested Bush's anticipated arrival on
east campus. While the protest was peaceful, three
Stanford students — seniors Claire Wagenseil, Diogo
Pereira and Caroline Martin — were arrested as police
pushed the crowd out of Serra Street.
All three students were charged with two misde
meanors: failure to yield to a vehicle in a roadway; and
resisting, delaying and obstructing a peace officer. Wa

The protest began at approximately 2 p.m. in White
Plaza, where 200 students gathered to make signs and
rally against the administration. As they began march
ing toward Hoover Tower, others joined their ranks
and began to chant slogans. By the time the rally
reached the Institution at 2:30 p.m., approximately 4(H)
protesters lined the police barriers set around the
building.
People continued to join the movement, and the slo
gans for reform grew louder as time passed. The mag
nitude of the protest ultimately forced Bush to conduct
the meeting at Shultz's house located on Delores
Street.
Meanwhile, outside the Hoover Institution, the
crowd chanted, "Hey-Hey-Ho-Ho-Bush is here, he's
got to go." Another popular slogan targeted the con
flict in Iraq, as students yelled," 1 -2-3-4-We don't want
your fuckin' war-5-6-7-8-Stop the killing, Stop the
hate."


Over 1,000 demonstrators marched from White Plaza to Hoover Tower Friday to protest President Bush's visit to campus. As a result, the meeting was moved from Hoover Tower to the home of Hoover Fellow George Shultz.
