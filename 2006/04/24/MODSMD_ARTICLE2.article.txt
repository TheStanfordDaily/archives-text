# PRESIDENT'S VISIT TO HOOVER MOVED AFTER PROTESTERS BLOCK ACCESS
## FARM BUSHWHACKED 
### AMIT ARORA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Although President George W. Bush was scheduled
to meet with fellows at the Hoover Institution on Fri
day, the presence of more than 1,000 protestors forced
him to change his plans and meet with advisers and fac
ulty members at the residence of former Secretary of
State and Hoover Fellow George Shultz on the out
skirts of the Stanford campus.
More than 1(X) armed law enforcement and Secret
Service officers lined the streets outside of Encina
Commons, as students, parents, faculty members and
local residents protested Bush's anticipated arrival on
east campus. While the protest was peaceful, three
Stanford students — seniors Claire Wagenseil, Diogo
Pereira and Caroline Martin — were arrested as police
pushed the crowd out of Serra Street.
All three students were charged with two misde
meanors: failure to yield to a vehicle in a roadway; and
resisting, delaying and obstructing a peace officer. Wa
genseil was also charged with battery, according to Sgt.
Hilary Karp of the Stanford Department of Public
Safety.The three were cited at the police station and re-

really a bubble, but
seeing all the people
out here has shown me
that people are really

leased later that day. They will appear in Palo Alto
Court to answer these charges within the next several
weeks.
The protest began at approximately 2 p.m. in White
Plaza, where 200 students gathered to make signs and
rally against the administration. As they began march
ing toward Hoover Tower, others joined their ranks
and began to chant slogans. By the time the rally
reached the Institution at 2:30 p.m., approximately 4(H)
protesters lined the police barriers set around the
building.
People continued to join the movement, and the slo
gans for reform grew louder as time passed. The mag
nitude of the protest ultimately forced Bush to conduct
the meeting at Shultz's house located on Delores
Street.
Meanwhile, outside the Hoover Institution, the
crowd chanted, "Hey-Hey-Ho-Ho-Bush is here, he's
got to go." Another popular slogan targeted the con
flict in Iraq, as students yelled," 1 -2-3-4-We don't want
your fuckin' war-5-6-7-8-Stop the killing, Stop the
hate."


Over 1,000 demonstrators marched from White Plaza to Hoover Tower Friday to protest President Bush's visit to campus. As a result, the meeting was moved from Hoover Tower to the home of Hoover Fellow George Shultz.

Three students were arrested after they refused to move.
As the protest grew louder, the Sheriff's
Department attempted to clear the street to
provide the president's motorcade a safe en
trance into the complex. When the students
refused to obey these verbal commands,
more than 50 police officers in full riot gear
were called to the scene. Dressed in protec
tive helmets, the officers used their batons to
push individuals back from the Tower.
In response to the use of physical force,
students directed their chants at the per
ceived infringement of their rights.
"Whose campus — Our campus. Whose
streets — our streets," they yelled. "Tell me
what democracy looks like — this is what
democracy looks like."
The struggle between the Sheriff's De
partment and protesters reached its climax
when a fire truck attempted to drive down
the street and was blocked by the crowd. Se
curity personnel were attempting to move
those blocking the truck when three Stan
ford students sat down and refused to move.
Officers dragged them out of the road
and bound their hands with plastic ties.
Though others demanded that their peers be
released, after 15 minutes, the three students
were placed into a Sheriff's Department ve
hicle and taken away. The fire truck then re
versed and did not proceed down the street.
Sophomore Nicole Wires described the
fire truck as a ploy used by the police.
"They brought a fire truck here because
they wanted to move us out of the streets,
and they knew that they could arrest us if we
didn't move," she said. "We didn't hear any
sirens anywhere after the truck reversed. It
didn't take another route. It's absurd."
In an interview with The Daily, Pereira
gave an account of his arrest.
"After being picked up off the ground, I
was dragged and handcuffed with my pants
down," he said. "The officer pushed me on to
the ground and wrote 148 on my leg with a
black marker. I asked what 148 stood for and
he said resisting arrest."
Mocking the administration, about an
hour later, members of the San Francisco
based Global Exchange Group drove a
Hummer toward the police barrier closing
off Serra from Galvez. Using a speaker
phone and donning masks of Bush and Sec
retary of State Condoleezza Rice, they paro
died Bush's foreign policy and the level of
security on campus.
In its own investigation,The Daily discov
ered that the Hoover fellows, along with
University President John Hennessy, who
had planned to meet with Bush, were driven
from the complex to Shultz's private resi

dence. At approximately 4:30 p.m.. Bush ar
rived at the house on Delores. He departed
campus at around 7:20 p.m. bound for St. He
lena, north of the Bay Area.
Before the fellows and Hennessy were
driven to the meeting, they gathered in front
of the complex, seemingly to greet the Pres
ident's motorcade. With this delegation in
plain view,several protestors began shouting
obscenities at the small group and criticizing
them for their support of Bush's platform.
Based on this, it appears that even the
Hoover fellows invited to the meeting were
not aware that the location of the president's
visit had been changed.
A number of protesters cited specific
complaints with the current administration,
calling attention to these issues with colorful
signs and popular slogans. Some wore stick
ers with the message "We all deserve the
freedom to marry," while others held signs
stating "No one died when Clinton lied,"
"Show me freedom! Protect my rights to my
body" and "Save Darfur."
With hundreds of prospective freshmen
and their families on campus for the week
end, the movement seemed to draw support
from onlookers. Several of these prospective
freshmen participated in the movement. Par
ents took photos and applauded the protes
tors as they proceeded down Lasuen Mall.
Some students, like incoming freshman
Alejandra Aponte, said they were surprised
by the protest's high turnout.
"I thought Stanford was really a bubble,
but seeing all the people that are out here
has shown me that people really are con
cerned," she said. "I'm Latina; I'm from
Guatemala. Right now President Bush is
doing some very interesting things in Latin
America. We have a phrase 'For every pig,
there will be a Saturday.' Basically, his game
is over."
Though the protest was not formally or
ganized by any one group, residents of
Columbae and members of Students Taking
Action Now: Darfur (STAND), the Student
Labor Action Coalition (SLAC) and
Amnesty International were active in the
demonstration. The Stanford Marching
Band also performed in front of the Hoover
Institution and entertained protestors with
music and antics.
Co-terminal student and Columbae resi
dent Tim Telleen-Lawton described his ef
forts to organize the event.
"A group of us sat down together last
night at Columbae and we just started deal
ing with the details," he said. "We organized
a time, and Columbae funds helped pay for

some of our supplies. There are approxi
mately 1 ,(MX) people around and more than
half of them are protesting. This is a great
success."
In addition to students on campus, adults
from Palo Alto participated in the move
ment outside the Hoover complex. Bernice
Fischer, a member of the Raging Grannies, a
group of senior citizens that regularly
protest political issues in the local area, de
scribed her excitement.
"I'm glad to see all the students out here,"
she said. "I'm in the Peace and Justice
League and the Women's International
League for Peace and Freedom, and we
haven't had very many students work with
us before. We've been protesting even be
fore Bush entered Iraq."
Carol Brouillet, a Green Party candidate
for Congress, even brought a 15-foot-tall
cardboard cutout of the Statue of Liberty
with a sack over its head. In imitation of the
famous photograph of human rights viola
tions at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, the
sign symbolized the atrocities perpetrated
by the United States overseas.
"Today shows there is a groundswell of
opposition to Bush, the regime and its poli
cies," Brouillet said.
Several Stanford faculty members ob
served the action from afar. Director of the
Institute for International Studies and Polit
ical Science Prof. Coit Blacker, who was not
invited to meet with Bush, said, "I love
America, and I love protests."
The repercussions of the protest are al
ready being felt statewide. A number of
news organization were present to report on
the issue, and State Controller Steve Westly,
the front-running Democratic candidate in
the 2(K)6 California gubernatorial race, re
marked on the controversial nature of issues
involving immigration, energy and Iraq.
"I think there's going to be a new wave of
student activism around the country," he
said. "I'm glad to see some of that's happen
ing at Stanford. I found the protest peaceful
and well-organized."
More than a dozen calls and emails seek
ing comment from Hoover Senior Fellows
presumed to be at the Friday meeting were
unreturned over the weekend.The president
is thought to have discussed economic and
foreign policy issues with conservative
scholars who have worked in past Republi
can administrations.The Daily will continue
to investigate what was discussed at the
meeting.

SHAMS SHAIKH/The Stanford Daily
Three students were arrested after they refused to move.
As the protest grew louder, the Sheriff's
Department attempted to clear the street to
provide the president's motorcade a safe en
trance into the complex. When the students
refused to obey these verbal commands,
more than 50 police officers in full riot gear
were called to the scene. Dressed in protec
tive helmets, the officers used their batons to
push individuals back from the Tower.
In response to the use of physical force,
students directed their chants at the per
ceived infringement of their rights.
"Whose campus — Our campus. Whose
streets — our streets," they yelled. "Tell me
what democracy looks like — this is what
democracy looks like."
The struggle between the Sheriff's De
partment and protesters reached its climax
when a fire truck attempted to drive down
the street and was blocked by the crowd. Se
curity personnel were attempting to move
those blocking the truck when three Stan
ford students sat down and refused to move.
Officers dragged them out of the road
and bound their hands with plastic ties.
Though others demanded that their peers be
released, after 15 minutes, the three students
were placed into a Sheriff's Department ve
hicle and taken away. The fire truck then re
versed and did not proceed down the street.
Sophomore Nicole Wires described the
fire truck as a ploy used by the police.
"They brought a fire truck here because
they wanted to move us out of the streets,
and they knew that they could arrest us if we
didn't move," she said. "We didn't hear any
sirens anywhere after the truck reversed. It
didn't take another route. It's absurd."
In an interview with The Daily, Pereira
gave an account of his arrest.
"After being picked up off the ground, I
was dragged and handcuffed with my pants
down," he said. "The officer pushed me on to
the ground and wrote 148 on my leg with a
black marker. I asked what 148 stood for and
he said resisting arrest."
Mocking the administration, about an
hour later, members of the San Francisco
based Global Exchange Group drove a
Hummer toward the police barrier closing
off Serra from Galvez. Using a speaker
phone and donning masks of Bush and Sec
retary of State Condoleezza Rice, they paro
died Bush's foreign policy and the level of
security on campus.
In its own investigation,The Daily discov
ered that the Hoover fellows, along with
University President John Hennessy, who
had planned to meet with Bush, were driven
from the complex to Shultz's private resi

dence. At approximately 4:30 p.m.. Bush ar
rived at the house on Delores. He departed
campus at around 7:20 p.m. bound for St. He
lena, north of the Bay Area.
Before the fellows and Hennessy were
driven to the meeting, they gathered in front
of the complex, seemingly to greet the Pres
ident's motorcade. With this delegation in
plain view,several protestors began shouting
obscenities at the small group and criticizing
them for their support of Bush's platform.
Based on this, it appears that even the
Hoover fellows invited to the meeting were
not aware that the location of the president's
visit had been changed.
A number of protesters cited specific
complaints with the current administration,
calling attention to these issues with colorful
signs and popular slogans. Some wore stick
ers with the message "We all deserve the
freedom to marry," while others held signs
stating "No one died when Clinton lied,"
"Show me freedom! Protect my rights to my
body" and "Save Darfur."
With hundreds of prospective freshmen
and their families on campus for the week
end, the movement seemed to draw support
from onlookers. Several of these prospective
freshmen participated in the movement. Par
ents took photos and applauded the protes
tors as they proceeded down Lasuen Mall.
Some students, like incoming freshman
Alejandra Aponte, said they were surprised
by the protest's high turnout.
"I thought Stanford was really a bubble,
but seeing all the people that are out here
has shown me that people really are con
cerned," she said. "I'm Latina; I'm from
Guatemala. Right now President Bush is
doing some very interesting things in Latin
America. We have a phrase 'For every pig,
there will be a Saturday.' Basically, his game
is over."
Though the protest was not formally or
ganized by any one group, residents of
Columbae and members of Students Taking
Action Now: Darfur (STAND), the Student
Labor Action Coalition (SLAC) and
Amnesty International were active in the
demonstration. The Stanford Marching
Band also performed in front of the Hoover
Institution and entertained protestors with
music and antics.
Co-terminal student and Columbae resi
dent Tim Telleen-Lawton described his ef
forts to organize the event.
"A group of us sat down together last
night at Columbae and we just started deal
ing with the details," he said. "We organized
a time, and Columbae funds helped pay for

some of our supplies. There are approxi
mately 1 ,(MX) people around and more than
half of them are protesting. This is a great
success."
In addition to students on campus, adults
from Palo Alto participated in the move
ment outside the Hoover complex. Bernice
Fischer, a member of the Raging Grannies, a
group of senior citizens that regularly
protest political issues in the local area, de
scribed her excitement.
"I'm glad to see all the students out here,"
she said. "I'm in the Peace and Justice
League and the Women's International
League for Peace and Freedom, and we
haven't had very many students work with
us before. We've been protesting even be
fore Bush entered Iraq."
Carol Brouillet, a Green Party candidate
for Congress, even brought a 15-foot-tall
cardboard cutout of the Statue of Liberty
with a sack over its head. In imitation of the
famous photograph of human rights viola
tions at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, the
sign symbolized the atrocities perpetrated
by the United States overseas.
"Today shows there is a groundswell of
opposition to Bush, the regime and its poli
cies," Brouillet said.
Several Stanford faculty members ob
served the action from afar. Director of the
Institute for International Studies and Polit
ical Science Prof. Coit Blacker, who was not
invited to meet with Bush, said, "I love
America, and I love protests."
The repercussions of the protest are al
ready being felt statewide. A number of
news organization were present to report on
the issue, and State Controller Steve Westly,
the front-running Democratic candidate in
the 2(K)6 California gubernatorial race, re
marked on the controversial nature of issues
involving immigration, energy and Iraq.
"I think there's going to be a new wave of
student activism around the country," he
said. "I'm glad to see some of that's happen
ing at Stanford. I found the protest peaceful
and well-organized."
More than a dozen calls and emails seek
ing comment from Hoover Senior Fellows
presumed to be at the Friday meeting were
unreturned over the weekend.The president
is thought to have discussed economic and
foreign policy issues with conservative
scholars who have worked in past Republi
can administrations.The Daily will continue
to investigate what was discussed at the
meeting.

Although President George W. Bush was scheduled
to meet with fellows at the Hoover Institution on Fri
day, the presence of more than 1,000 protestors forced
him to change his plans and meet with advisers and fac
ulty members at the residence of former Secretary of
State and Hoover Fellow George Shultz on the out
skirts of the Stanford campus.
More than 1(X) armed law enforcement and Secret
Service officers lined the streets outside of Encina
Commons, as students, parents, faculty members and
local residents protested Bush's anticipated arrival on
east campus. While the protest was peaceful, three
Stanford students — seniors Claire Wagenseil, Diogo
Pereira and Caroline Martin — were arrested as police
pushed the crowd out of Serra Street.
All three students were charged with two misde
meanors: failure to yield to a vehicle in a roadway; and
resisting, delaying and obstructing a peace officer. Wa
genseil was also charged with battery, according to Sgt.
Hilary Karp of the Stanford Department of Public
Safety.The three were cited at the police station and re-

leased later that day. They will appear in Palo Alto
Court to answer these charges within the next several
weeks.
The protest began at approximately 2 p.m. in White
Plaza, where 200 students gathered to make signs and
rally against the administration. As they began march
ing toward Hoover Tower, others joined their ranks
and began to chant slogans. By the time the rally
reached the Institution at 2:30 p.m., approximately 4(H)
protesters lined the police barriers set around the
building.
People continued to join the movement, and the slo
gans for reform grew louder as time passed. The mag
nitude of the protest ultimately forced Bush to conduct
the meeting at Shultz's house located on Delores
Street.
Meanwhile, outside the Hoover Institution, the
crowd chanted, "Hey-Hey-Ho-Ho-Bush is here, he's
got to go." Another popular slogan targeted the con
flict in Iraq, as students yelled," 1 -2-3-4-We don't want
your fuckin' war-5-6-7-8-Stop the killing, Stop the
hate."
