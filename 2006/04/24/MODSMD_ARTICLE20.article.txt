# Campus gives in to The Man

One of the defining moments of Admit
Weekend is when the band greets the
ProFros in the fountain of MemAud
after the University Welcome. Nothing can
compare to the bewildered look on the
stunned kids' face as they think,"Can they do
that?"
After Bio 43 on Friday, I walked over to
the auditorium to witness my favorite part of
Admit Weekend only to find tons of ProFros
wandering around the fountain with that reg
ular clueless expression on their face —
meaning they have no idea where to go next.
It was not until I followed my ears around the
backside of MemAud that I found the band
playing to a smaller, and obviously not-as-im
pressed audience in the parking lot.
Now, I know that this Admit Weekend was
special, to say the least, but I think more
could have been done to ensure that the
Band's waterside tradition continued — is
the Band really a threat to national security
anyway?
Government officials set up barricades to
keep students out of the area in front of
MemAud and Hoover Tower, but ProFros
wandered in the "restricted" area without
problem. Only the Band was booted from the
blocked-off zone, which was of course set up
for nothing. The President never even came
to the Hoover complex.
More than 70 percent of the student body
voted in favor of funding for the Band in the
last election. Stanford students like to be dif
ferent. If we can't beat Cal at football, at least
we have a Tree who could dance Oski under
the table and a band who does not avoid hav
ing fun at all costs.
And speaking of the I'ree, I like the direc
tion we are going with Tommy. At least this
tree is getting suspended for the right rea
sons. While Erin got busted for blatant drink
ing and a bad "attitude to her position,"
Tommy is getting suspended for dancing too
much and giving security flack.
At the women's basketball tournament,
the Tree put the nation to shame. ESPN re
ported that Tommy Leepgot suspended for
"dancing in an undesignated area" and "not
leaving the court at halftime in a timely
manner." Sounded to me like he got kicked
out for having too much fun. What a way to
stick it to the Man by making Him look
foolish.
I think these are the ideals that Stanford
students embrace, and the administration
should reflect this attitude. So, I blame the
