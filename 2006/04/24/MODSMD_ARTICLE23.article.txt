## 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
Six of the top 10 teams in the na
tion; three of the top five, two of the
top three.
ITiat's Pac-10 softball for you.
With so many talented squads, No. 5
Stanford has to fight for every win
and, even on a good day, being the
higher seed doesn't mean much.
Stanford (33-10, 6-6 Pac-10)
played host this weekend to No. 3
Arizona (34-7, 5-4) and No. 8 Ari
zona State (41-7,5-4) and came away
with a win and two losses. The Wild
cats won 4-1 on Friday before the
Sun Devils split with the Cardinal,
winning 3-1 Saturday and losing 3-1
on Sunday.
"I am not disappointed by the
way we played or our energy out on
the field," Coach John Rittman said.
"The Pac-10 is definitely the tough
est conference in the country. You
have to bring your A-game everyday.
And in this conference, you can play
great and still get beat."
Senior shortstop Lauren Lappin
and sophomore second baseman Tri
cia Aggabao provided most of the
Cardinal's offense on the weekend.
Lappin went 3-for-7 with two of
Stanford's five RBI, while Aggabao
hit 3-for-8 with an RBI.
Against Arizona, Stanford got on
the board first. A Lappin single in the
third knocked in Aggabao, who had
singled and advanced to second on a
Catalina Morris bunt.
The Stanford lead held until the
top of the sixth inning when Ari
zona's Kristie Fox hit a three-run
blast. The Wildcats sealed the win in
the seventh with Callista Balko's

solo shot. The Cardinal put two on
base in the bottom of the seventh,
but stranded both runners.
Freshman pitcher Missy Penna
went 6 1/3 innings in just her fourth
loss of the season. She struck out five
while giving up four hits in the game.
"I thought we played pretty well."
Rittman said. "We just need to get
better about making adjustments
against good teams and not doing it
so late in games."
Stanford rebounded from the

tough loss Saturday with a 3-1 win
over the Sun Devils. The game re
mained scoreless into the fifth in
ning, when ASU's Mindy Cowles hit
a solo homerun off sophomore
hurler Becky McCullough. Senior
Laura Severson came in. and shut
down the Sun Devils the rest of the
way.
Stanford tied the game in the bot
tom of the fifth when Aggabao
scored senior pinch runner Shoney
Hixson. The Cardinal took the lead

in the sixth when sophomore first
baseman Michelle Smith and sopho
more catcher Erin Howe hit back-to
back RBI singles.
Stanford then retired the side in
the top of the seventh to end the
game.
Severson got the win in the circle,
pitching three shutout innings to im
prove to 7-0 on the season.
The Saturday rematch was anoth
er low-scoring battle for the Cardinal
and the Sun Devils, but the score re
versed.
A pitch hit Catalina Morris in the
shoulder to start off the first for Stan
ford. Lappin then cracked a double
deep into leftfield to score Morris
from first. The Cardinal could not
bring Lappin home, however, and
the score was 1 -0 at the end of the in
ning.
The Sun Devils struck back in the
third when ASU outfielder Michelle

Smith hit a two-run triple to the
rightfield fence, past diving sopho
more Anna Beardman. After walk
ing the next hatter, Penna headed for
the dugout and Severson took over
pitching duties.
With her team trailing 2-1, Beard
man led off the third inning and
grounded out. Trying to beat the
throw to first, she tripped over the
bag and went flying, staying on the
ground for several minutes before
being helped off the field. She re
turned to the outfield in the next in
ning, moving gingerly but seemingly
uninjured.
"1 think it scared her more than
anything," Rittnian said. "She heard
a pop and was feeling some pain, but
when she went back on the field her
knee was stable. So 1 think she will be
fine, but we will still reevaluate her."
The Cardinal put runners on base
in each of the next two innings but
could not get past first base. While
Stanford struggled, ASU's Smith
notched her second triple of the
game in the top of the fifth, good for
an RBI and the 3-1 lead.
ASU's pitcher Katie Burkhart,
last week's national Player of the
Week, pitched a complete game Sun
day and struck out eight Stanford
batters to improve to 20-3 on the sea
son.
Penna took the loss for Stanford,
falling to 18-5 on the season. She
struck out three and gave up two
runs. Severson struck out two pitch
ing in relief.
The Cardinal visit Oregon and
No. 9 Oregon State next weekend,
before returning home for a non
conference contest with San Jose
State on May 2.
