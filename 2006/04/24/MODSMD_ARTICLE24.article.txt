The Stanford women's gymnasts
may not have made it to the NCAA
Championships as a team, but the
squad did not miss an opportunity for
a road trip. The whole team support
ed sophomore Tabitha Yim and sen
ior Natalie Foley as they competed in
the national all-around competition.
Saturday night was the conclusion
of the NCAA Championships at
Oregon State. Yim earned third in
floor exercise (9.9125) and ninth in
uneven bar5(9.325). Foley did not
progress to event finals but did earn
fifth in uneven bars in Session II of
the Championships.
Yim competed in Session 11 of the
preliminary round and garnered sec
ond in bars, 12th in beam, second on

floor and fourth in the all-around.
Yim's performance preceded her
reception of All-American honors in
three arenas. Now the recipient of
seven All-American nods, Yim was
recognized in the all-around, bars
and floor exercise.
Foley competed in the all-around
as well, hut her shining event was
bars, where she scored a 9.85 to earn
fifth in Session II of the champi
onships.
"A lot of times I get nervous when
my team is competing," Foley said. "I
really wasn't nervous at all. I was try
ing not to think too much, focusing
on appreciating it and enjoying it."
Foley endured a fall on her first
event, beam, but the fall was "easy to
shake off" for Foley.
"That obviously wasn't the way 1
want to start," she said. "1 don't even
know why I fell."
After the fall, Foley's perform
ances improved and she ended her
career on a positive note. She missed
making finals by one spot, but re
ceived two All-American honors and

now owns the record for the most
All-American titles of any member
of the Stanford women's gymnastics
team, with 10 under her belt. She was
also one of the six seniors nominated
for the AAI American Award, given
to the top senior gymnast in the na
tion.
Alabama's Ashley Miles captured
the vault title, Georgia's Courtney
Kupets won bars and beam, while
UCLA's Kate Richardson was the
winner of floor.
The spirit of the competition was
filled with team support, non-team
support and a rare talent pool. This
may not be the season end that the
Stanford team was looking for, but it
is one that shows the legacy that one
departing gymnast leaves and anoth
er aspiring gymnast picks up.
