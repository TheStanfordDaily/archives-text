# SPECIAL EVENT
## Adoption advice for a high price 
### MIMA MOHAMMED CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last Saturday, Women's Health at Stanford and the
Northern California Chapter of RESOLVE, an organiza
tion that educates and supports women faced with infer
tility, held their annual symposium, "Pathways to Adop
tion." The event took place at Stanford Medical Center
and featured workshops and lectures given by birth par
ents, parents who have adopted and those who were
adopted themselves. The audience also received advice
from professionals on the adoption process.
Workshops held throughout the day examined sub
jects including risk factors and readiness in adoption,
open adoption, parenting through adoption, domestic
and international adoption and topics specifically tai
lored for those who have experienced the usual red tape.
The symposium cost $100 for RESOLVE members to
attend and $ 150 for nonmembers. However, event organ
izers justified the cost, saying it was worth the advice of
expert lecturers in the field of adoption.
Having been an attendee in the past. Roberta Ro
driguez-Havens. now president of the Northern Califor
nia chapter of RESOLVE, spoke about her own experi
ences adopting a child, and just how confusing the ordeal
can be.
"I remember the journey being one of loneliness and
despair," Rodriguez-Havens said, recalling the compli
cated questions that arose. "Who do I pick? How much
will it cost? We educate and we want to share our suc
cess."
The keynote address entitled "Attunement, Attach
ment and a Secure Connection," opened the daylong
symposium at 9 a.m. in Fairchild Auditorium. Nancy
Newton Verrier, a marriage and family therapist and au
thor of the book "The Primal Wound," delivered the lec
ture entitled "Understanding the Adopted Child." The
book is popular within the adoption community and was
awarded the Book of the Year Award from the Council
for Equal Rights in Adoption in 1993, as well as the
Emma Vilardi Humanitarian Award from the American
Adoption Congress in 2003.
Verrier currently practices psychotherapy with many
families that have adopted. Her lecture addressed the ex
perience of adopted children — from the initial separa
tion from their birth mother to the formation of the new
family. Both a biological mother and an adoptive mother,
she spoke openly about cultivating a relationship with

her adopted child's birth family.
Verrier said that she wished she had known more
about adoption in 1969 when she was first considering it.
"My whole life changed as the result of adopting a
child. I didn't know what was happening when she wasn't
connecting," she said.
According to Verrier, many adoption experts in the
past have encouraged giving the adopted child space
when he or she is upset. This practice is wrong, she said.
Parents need to empathize more with their adopted child
— even more so than parents raising their own children
— because adoptive parents need to understand that
their child has already suffered the devastating loss of a
birth mother.
"We have to find a different way to bond with our chil
dren, this is very different from the physical and genetic
bond that is created during pregnancy," she said. "We
have to realize that the child has suffered a loss, when we
come into the baby's life — they do not know who we
are. We can't do the best for our children until we under
stand them."
Verrier believes that adoptive parents should actively
engage in conversation with their child when they say
things such as,"l wish I looked like you, mom and dad,"
or "You don't understand me," rather than brushing the
topics aside. She recommends that families delve into
these topics openly and candidly discuss the differences,
rather than attempt to force similarities in physical fea
tures or discount what the child is saying.
According to Verrier, adopted children may be more
responsive at different ages. During adolescence, it is
often difficult for the child to relate to parents. But most
children are going through an identity stage during these
ages. Adopted children, she said, are even more confused
because they often feel there is no one at home they can
relate to.
The event also touched on international adoption,
stressing that parents who choose to adopt international
ly from China or Russia should not think they are being
purely altruistic — these children are often very scared at
first.
In conclusion, experts agreed that although the road
of parenting an adopted child can be difficult, it is well
worth it.
"Be aware and tune into the emotional life of the
child," Verrier said. "You want these kids to be connect
ed to you. You all can make such a difference in the lives
of these children."
