President George W. Bush preached to the choir at
Cisco System's corporate headquarters in San Jose Fri
day afternoon. His advance team could not have chosen
an audience more supportive of his American Competi
tiveness Initiative (ACI), a plan to bolster math and sci
ence education in public schools, make some corporate
tax breaks permanent and increase federal support for
research-and-development efforts.
At the first event of his four-day California visit. Bush
pushed Congress to embrace the ACI, a hallmark of his

2006 political agenda. About 400 Cisco employees and in
vitees watched the hour-long,seven-member panel, which
included Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.
"America intends to shape our future and not fear the
future," Bush said during his unscripted remarks."Not
only can we compete, we must compete and remain a
leader of the world."
EDUCATION
Bush and Schwarzenegger agreed that maintaining
the status quo in education will not suffice. Panelists dis
paraged the low standing of American students in com
parison to their counterparts in developing nations like
India and China.
"Mediocrity is unacceptable," Bush said. "We're not

included education, oil dependence and research and development. Bush was given a warm welcome.
going to accept the fact that children can't
read by the fourth grade anymore in
America... We don't want to be 15th in the
world; we want to be first in the world
when it comes to teaching our children
math and science."
John Chambers, Cisco's chief executive
officer, told the president that "the chal
lenge, however, is our competition global
ly is moving even faster on the math and
science. China and India graduate 10
times the number of PhDs we do."
Bush trumpeted the No Child Left Be
hind (NCLB) Act — the 2002 education
reform bill that passed with bipartisan
support — as a positive step toward nar
rowing the achievement gap between
races.
Temp Keller, the founder of the non
profit Resources for Indispensable
Schools and Educators, said the gap still
exists, adding that programs like his help
bring quality teachers to diverse schools.
"This is my generation's civil rights
issue," he said. "We've got far too many
kids who just can't read."
Bush said that math and science teach
ers are needed the most. He called for
greater accountability standards during
the high school years and investments to
support Advanced Placement (AP) pro
grams.
"One of the problems we have is not
enough teachers know how to teach AP,"
he said. "I'm going to ask the Congress to
fund enough money to help train 70,000
teachers so they can become prepared to
teach Advanced Placement."
Schwarzenegger drew laughter and ap
plause from the audience when he said
"we have the smartest people in the world
right here in California. We should pro
duce more math and science teachers."
Bush also said that there should be
more focus on preparing students for
technical, rather than humanities-based
disciplines.
"Face it, we've got to have a different
set of skills." the president, a history
major, said. "History may not cut it. Math
and science are going to be vital to make
sure that this country- educates the engi
neers, the chemists, the physicists — the
types of folks that [executives] are going
to be looking for to hire."
Panelists emphasized the role that
community colleges can play in equipping
students not pursuing a four-year degree
with the skills they need for high-tech jobs.
"Community colleges are available,
they're very flexible." Bush said. "In other
words, the curricula can adjust depending

upon the local needs. They're innovative,
iiiey're very practical. In other words, they
train people for jobs which actually exist."
Schwarzenegger, who graduated from
a community college after immigrating to
America from Austria, praised the state's
two-year schools.
"There are many kids that want to get
into different professions," he said. "They
want to be a cop or a plumber, or they
want to be a chef or a computer technician
or a nurse. Great professions with a great
future and great salaries. 1 think that com
munity colleges here in the state are really
doing an extraordinary job to prepare
them for those jobs."
One member of the panel, Arash Shok
ouh, is a San Jose State University student
studying engineering and mathematics.
The Iranian-American told the president
about his parent's immigration to the
United States in 1980 and the opportuni
ties he has been provided.
OIL DEPENDENCE
Bush addressed rising gas prices in his
opening remarks. He likened fuel costs to
a tax and pledged that "if we find any price
gouging it will be dealt with firmly."
He also connected the climbing prices
with the nation's underlying dependence
on foreign oil, which he said limits Ameri
can competitiveness. He blamed some of
the problem on expanding foreign pow
ers, namely India and China. For alterna
tives, he focused on hybrid automobiles
and ethanol fuel as ways to reduce de
pendence on these countries.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Schwarzenegger took credit for turn
ing California's economy around since ar
riving in Sacramento two-and-a-half years
ago.
"We turned the business environment
around here in California, and improved
the environment and made it easier to do
business here and also less expensive to do
business," the governor said. He pointed
to reduced worker compensation costs as
an example of his pro-business policies.
Bush said that federal support for re
search and development of new technolo
gies is a crucial factor to keep America
competitive with other countries. He men
tioned the iPod and Internet as innova
tions that may never have been realized
without government support.
To encourage further research and de
velopment, Bush said that Congress
should tinker with the tax code. He ex

plained that permanent tax credits would
allow companies to write off expenses for
the development of new products.
"To keep us on the leading edge o£
change, to make sure we're the innovative
capital of the world. Congress needs to
make the research and development tax
credit a permanent part of the tax code,"
Bush said.
He assured that progress was being 1
made to make sure "high-speed broad
band is available to nearly every Ameri
can," and that he wants to create "broad
band highways" to compete with coun
tries that have outpaced America's invest
ment in technology.
RESPONSE
The audience's reactions to his re
marks were largely positive, but some said
they are worried that Bush may not follow
through on his broader proposals.
"The president is stepping up the
plate," said Democratic San Jose Mayor
Ron Gonzalez in an interview with The
Daily. "The challenge now is if he can com
bine his efforts with the Democrats to put
partisan politics aside to get the funding
needed to implement the strategy."
Leading Democratic candidate for
California governor. Controller Steve
Westly, was also vocal about the presi
dent's initiative.
"What 1 want to see is action," he said.
"1 want to see how much he's going to
commit and how soon."
Silicon Valley Leadership Group Pres
ident Carl Guadino praised Bush's leader
ship of the discussion.
"When he leaves office, he might give
Oprah a run for her money," he said."He's
singing our tune. He still has to make sure
Congress puts money in the jukebox to
keep that tune playing."
Cisco Vice President R. Lance Perry
praised the president's "passion and
focus."
"We recognize that the core of the
issue for continuing to be competitive is to
have people graduate and enough good
teachers in place to really make this hap
pen," he said.
Air Force One landed at 1:10 p.m. on
Moffett Field in Mountain View.The pres
ident was welcomed by Schwarzenegger
on the tarmac, gave a public service award
to a San Jose man and drove to the Cisco
campus. The president arrived 30 minutes
ahead of schedule. After the 56-minute
panel, he spent 18 minutes shaking hands
before departing for Stanford in his per
sonal helicopter. Marine One.
