## Gov. seeks out funds for California levees Schwarzenegger – Bush maintain rocky relationship since re-election 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
The off-and-on dynamic between Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger and President George W. Bush
played an important role in the leader's trip to
California last weekend. The two have had a
rocky relationship and maintained tenuous ties
since Schwarzenegger was elected in the 2(X)3 re
call election.
As the governor seeks re-election in 2006, vot
ers are expected to judge Schwarzenegger on
whether he can bring home the bacon for Califor
nia. Bush's visit was mostly about just that — se
curing a federal commitment to fund repairs to
California's antiquated levee system that is at
high risk for flooding this year.
Schwarzenegger campaigned for Bush in
2004, but encouraged the president to stay in D.C.
last fall during the weeks preceding the vote on
the failed ballot initiatives. Bush has not been
popular in California, and the governor's staff has
seen him more as a liability than a political asset.
Even so, the Schwarzenegger camp has said that
the close ties between the two men help the gov
ernor lobby for more federal funding.
Democrats have pounced on Schwarzenegger,
who ran for office as "The Collectinator," for fail
ing to deliver more federal funding for California
projects since entering office. Californians con
tribute significantly more to federal coffers than is
spent on projects within the state, they say.
Since the trip was announced last week, the
governor announced publicly that he would
lobby for federal appropriations to repair the
state's damaged levees. He asked the president to
declare California a state of emergency and im
mediately contribute funding.
The president tried to meet him halfway,offer
ing a rare directive to the Army Corps of Engi
neers that would allow the project to move ahead
faster than originally planned.
The state of California argues that repairs are
urgent for the water levees along the Sacramento-
San Joaquin River Delta to limit flooding, im
prove water delivery and retrofit for earthquake
safety.The levees were built almost a century ago
in a more agrarian era. Every one's concern is that
California could be the next New Orleans —
where the levees broke, yielding devastating re
sults, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina last
fall.
The governor's office was unhappy that it did
not receive the full support it asked from the ad
ministration. But a Schwarzenegger spokesper
son still trumpeted the commitment made by the
Bush White House.
"Today's announcement is a step in the right
direction, however more work needs to be done if
we are going to rebuild our levees as quickly as
possible," said Gubernatorial Press Secretary
Margita Thompson in a Friday press release. "We

look forward to seeing the details and language of
the president's directive. The governor will con
tinue pressing the federal government to expedite
the levee repairs."
Schwarzenegger greeted the president at Mof
fett Field in Mountain View with open arms. In
the motorcade on the way to a panel on the Amer
ican Competitiveness Initiative, Schwarzenegger
is said to have pushed Bush for a larger commit
ment.
Publicly, the two agreed on a great deal during
Friday's event held at Cisco Systems. But while
the governor did not broach the levee issue at any
of the public events, differences between the two
men — both Republicans — were at times ap
parent. In his initial welcome. Bush thought care
fully before labeling —to laughter —
Schwarzenegger as "an interesting man."
"He didn't have to run for office, but chose to
do so, and I admire that in you," Bush said. "I ad
mire somebody who doesn't always take the com
fortable way in life in order to serve something
greater than himself. And I appreciate your serv
ice, I really do."
Democrats criticized the governor for failing
to come through on his promises.
Controller Steve Westly, the Democratic
front-runner in the race for governor, called
Schwarzenegger's failure to secure the levees
"shameful." He said the historic rains and anti
quated system demand an immediate investment.
"The governor promised to bring money to
Californians in need." Westly said. "He hasn't
done this. He needs to be protecting Californians
and their homes, not at political fundraisers."
On the other hand. San Jose Mayor Ron Gon
zalez, a Democrat, commended Schwarzenegger
for being "proactive" in seeking funding from the
federal government.
"I think it's extremely important that the gov
ernor advocate for the needs of California," he
told The Daily. "The levee system is so vital to the
future of our state."
State Senator Abel Maldonado.a Republican,
said the administration's commitment to move
more quickly to secure the levees was a "step in
the right direction," but he complained that no set
dollar amount had been established.
Maldonado defended Schwarzenegger from
criticism that he should not have participated in
the event at Cisco. He said that the governor
would have gone even if John Kerry was presi
dent. and that he came more to support the insti
tution of the presidency than Bush himself.
"He has to appear with him," he said. "It is re
spect for the office of the president...They can
have disagreements, but they need to be friends."
The Schwarzenegger team has made repairing
the state's levee system a legislative priority. In
Washington. D.C., the governor lobbied House
and Senate leaders to ask for federal funding. He
also pressed the issue in meetings with then-
White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card and
Department of Homeland Security Secretary
Michael Chertoff. A press statement said that his
proposed budget for 2006-2007 more than dou
bles the current flood maintenance funding.

State Senator Abel Maldonado.a Republican,
said the administration's commitment to move
more quickly to secure the levees was a "step in
the right direction," but he complained that no set
dollar amount had been established.
Maldonado defended Schwarzenegger from
criticism that he should not have participated in
the event at Cisco. He said that the governor
would have gone even if John Kerry was presi
dent. and that he came more to support the insti
tution of the presidency than Bush himself.
"He has to appear with him," he said. "It is re
spect for the office of the president...They can
have disagreements, but they need to be friends."
The Schwarzenegger team has made repairing
the state's levee system a legislative priority. In
Washington. D.C., the governor lobbied House
and Senate leaders to ask for federal funding. He
also pressed the issue in meetings with then-
White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card and
Department of Homeland Security Secretary
Michael Chertoff. A press statement said that his
proposed budget for 2006-2007 more than dou
bles the current flood maintenance funding.
