## Hello, nice to meet you, will you marry me? 
### 
Ifeel like 1 have my finger on the pulse of society. For ex
ample. dancing 'til dawn at the BBC: so last quarter.
Baking eclairs instead of going to Pub Night: really cool
right now. Canary-yellow sling-backs with a cork wedge
heel: never a good idea. Arranged marriages: definitely
"in" this year.
This last statement may come as a surprise to some of
you. Like corsets and chastity belts, arranged marriages are
experiencing a resurgence in popularity, and not just within
cultures that traditionally choose that route for their off
spring. 1 have no legitimate data to back this up. but in a re
cent game of "Would You Rather," 1 (K) percent of survey
participants chose an arranged marriage over having their
thumb removed with a dull Exacto knife. You just can't
argue with numbers like that.
I personally began to reconsider my views on the sub
ject (arranged marriage, not finger removal) several years
ago when my roommate at the time mentioned that her
family would most likely be hand-picking her spouse. I was
initially skeptical — what if her family chose someone
who was ugly, not funny or — God forbid — really into
"pleather?" The roommate patiently explained that she
would have a fair amount of say in the matter, and that for
the most part the arranged marriage process in her culture
creates partnerships that last longer than other marriages.
1 was intrigued.
We like to believe that love knows no boundaries — that
things like religion, family background and financial goals
have little to do with the success of a particular couple. This
is extremely naive. If Shamu and Phil Collins get hitched,
there will come a day when Collins can no longer croon
"Sussudio" to keep his partner from hitting him in the face
with a trout. They will have to deal with the fact that one of
them is a whale (hint: it's Collins).
Now don't misunderstand me here. I am pro inter-faith,
inter-racial, inter-state marriage, and think that future gen
erations will look on our refusal to acknowledge gay mar
riage the same way we look at opponents of the Civil Rights
Movement. But I also think that it's high time we think real
istically about what it takes to make a relationship work,
and the bottom line is that two people who do not share the
same core values and have families that hate each other
have very little reason to beat the 50 percent divorce statis
tic. There has to be something holding two people together
when everything else has gone to hell, and in the absence of
some sort of common ground, 1 imagine that that is a very
difficult thing to do.
This certainly does not mean that we should only date
people who appear to be as much like us as possible. Half-
Jewish singer-songwriters are still my men of choice, even
though I want to raise my children within the Christian
faith. I do this because I do not believe that marriage is the
only goal of dating, and because I could see myself in an
inter-faith marriage as long as we shared other values like
the importance of family and the need for a sense of humor
(also: the need to serenade me on a daily basis).
I am suddenly very afraid that I will return home for a
Memorial Day barbecue and my family will have a posse of
potential suitors lined up behind the potato salad. Actually,
that could be kind of fun. I could have them complete vari
ous challenges — reality show-style — like Pick Up My
Dry Cleaning and Try To Come Up With A Good Come
back When I Say You Look Like A Fetal Pig.Then we could
ask them about their relationship with their own families,
and when I get them alone I'll ask them which instrument
they plan to serenade me with (obscene answers to this
question are grounds for immediate disqualification). Final
ly, the winner and I could have a nice little engagement party
in the backyard next to the potato salad, and who knows, we
might even get to like each other. Either that, or I will run
away when no one is looking, because I hear that Phil
Collins just broke up with his wife. He'd probably be down
for another round of "Sussudio."
