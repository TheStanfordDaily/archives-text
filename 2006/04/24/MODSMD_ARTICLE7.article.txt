Do the most good in life while doing
the least harm." This ideal led
Richard Powers, a lecturer in the
Stanford Dance Division, to the Farm 14
years ago.
"For me, teaching dance fulfilled that
ideal better than product design or ad
vertising," he says."I received my mas
ter's degree from Stanford, with an engi
neering and art background. But soon
my avocation became my vocation."
Powers teaches Social Dance 1, a very
popular class among Stanford students.
Offered every quarter, the class usually
fills up quickly. Powers has taught the
class since he arrived on campus, and
says that the "content and style have
somewhat changed along the way."
"I was hired to teach the basic social
ballroom dances, but I soon began
adding partnering techniques and atti
tudes that would be more relevant to
Stanford students," Powers adds.
The music for the class has also
changed significantly since Powers' first
year.
"The Dance Division gave me old
ballroom dance recordings to use, but 1
soon switched to today's music, which is
not only more meaningful to students,
but is simply better music than most of
the old ballroom stuff," Powers explains.
Powers also teaches Social Dance 2,
Social Dance 3, Living Traditions of
Swing, History of the Waltz and History
of Social Dance. Nevertheless, Social
Dance 1 remains the most popular class,
despite its 8:45 a.m. start.
Senior Wataru Ebina says that he
joined the class on the advice of a dorm

mate. Ebina debated whether or not to
take the course, having never taken a
dance class. Though he signed up late
and missed the first three classes, Ebina
says he is now enjoying the class and the
new experience.
"It is a great way to start the day."he
adds. "It's so early in the morning, but it
wakes me up. Social Dance 1 — along
with Voice 2 and Music Theorv — has

been a great way to end my undergradu
ate career."
Freshman Zach Nevin agrees with
Ebina, saying he took Social Dance 1 be
cause it was a "relaxing course amidst
the science and humanities classes" as
well as a "chance to wind down." He
adds that he enjoyed the atmosphere
and is continuing to learn to social dance
in "History of the Waltz."

Powers has his own thoughts about
why students enjoy Social Dance 1.
"Some of them like finding a new way
of learning — intuitive and multi-task
ing — you might say right-brain parallel
processing of information," he says.
"Some students like the physical balance
to their more sedentary studies, helping
them develop more of themselves. Many
love the music, and enjoy being able to
move to it and express themselves
through it. Some like the views into
other cultures, which you find in these
social dances from all over the world."
Students are the reason that Powers
continues to love teaching the class.
"I love seeing students discover a new
interest or passion," Powers explains. "1
love seeing the day when it all starts to
click effortlessly for them. I love seeing
their enhanced self-confidence and self
esteem."
He also says he believes learning how
to dance is helpful in teaching important
social skills.
"We generously adjust our own danc
ing to be compatible with our various
dance partners, rather than insisting that
they conform to us," he explains. "We
enjoy the individuality of our dance
partners and continually modify our
dancing to maximize their comfort and
pleasure.Then once we discover the ben
efits of this awareness on the dance
floor, we find that it applies to our other
activities and relationships as well."
Powers says these social skills are im
portant for various careers, which fre
quently involve team-building and of
fice-group dynamics. He says he wishes
more Stanford classes taught these cru
cial social skills, but affirms that "at the
Dance Division, we're doing our part."
