# Student group builds relationships with Palo Alto's homeless
## 
### MARIE-JO MONT-REYNAUD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If you walk around University Avenue on a
Friday night, you'll probably run into hordes of
Stanford students going out to eat or catch a
movie. One group, however, passes up the ex
travagant entrance to The Cheesecake Factory
and the warm lights of the University Cafe.
Their mission is different — they are no or
dinary group of Stanford students on a week
end jaunt around town. They comprise Night
Outreach, an organization dedicated to bring
ing support to the homeless who live in down
town Palo Alto and raising awareness about the
issues of homelessness. Instead of pausing to
look at menus posted in windows. Night Out
reach members stop at the corner of Bryant
Street and University, outside the Walgreens.
Many homeless people gather at this cor
ner with shopping carts and plastic cups full of
change. Last Friday night, a middle-aged
woman in a dark grey sweatshirt and blue
warm-up pants sat quietly watching Wal
greens' automatic doors open and close. She
is someone that Night Outreach President
Paul Padovano knows well. He approached
her warmly and joined her on the bench.
Padovano, a fourth-year philosophy grad
uate student, has only been president of the
group for two months. He offered the woman,
known by all as Lindy, a hamburger that an

other student brought from her dining hall.
"It's good to bring chewy food because a
lot of the homeless have dental issues,"
Padovano instructs students who are new to
Night Outreach's weekly excursions. Though
Lindy accepts the food, she does not eat it for
another hour- and-a-half. Instead, she and
Padovano jump into an animated discussion.
While Night Outreach offers food and basic
care to dozens of homeless, these services are
not the most important aspect of the program,
according to freshman Taiei Harimoto.
"I found that it's more than just distributing
food," Harimoto says. "Most people just need
someone to talk to. It's great to be able to listen
and interact with them like they're real people
when every day they're pretty much ignored."
As the night progressed, Lindy shared
what has been going on since the students'
last visit.
"They put Ralph in jail," she says of her
boyfriend of four years. He was arrested for
urinating in public and is now being held in
the jail's psychiatric ward.
"He's in a room that he can't leave," Lindy
says. "They have to slide the tray of food in
through a little window. But at least he gets
'three hots and a cot' as they say."
It is evident that Lindy is one of Palo Alto's
homeless who is coping relatively well given
the area's difficult circumstances.
"I'm the one who always goes to do the

laundry at the coin laundry next to 7-Eleven,"
Lindy says of the time she spends with Ralph
and other friends on the street. "None of them
are allowed in there anymore because they're
drunk all the time.They let me in because I'm
nice," she says with a smile.
"But that means I'm the maid — I do the
laundry and I do all the shopping, because
they're not let into the Walgreens anymore ei
ther," Lindy adds.
Having spent several years on and off the
streets of Palo Alto, she knows the tricks to
get by.
"At the police station at City Hall, there's a
room with chairs and a television set open al
most 24 hours a day," Lindy explains. "They
provide hot coffee and tea. I sit there and
watch 'Cops' and 'FBI:The Untold Stories.'"
Lindy says she even left her belongings —
including a sleeping bag and some clothes —
there for the night, explaining that she has
been robbed before, losing important docu
ments like her social security card.
"But it's safe there," she says of the station,
"because they're not gonna take my stuff.
They're cops."
Lindy says she enjoys the interaction with
students and freely shares details about her life.
She recounts some time she spent in a
women's detention facility.
"I don't know why but for some reason the
correctional officers liked me," she recalls. In

fact, one of them asked her to help a young in
mate who was suicidal.
"I'm 50 years old so I guess they figured I
had some wisdom," she comments. "I walked
around the yard with the young girl, and we
talked until I talked her out of it. I told her I've
been there, and it's just not worth it. She was
looking forward so far, such a long time
ahead. I told her, 'You're young, you have so
much life ahead of you, there's no need to
worry about things so far ahead."'
Lindy's advice is relevant to even the
stressed-out Stanford student every once in a
while. Her outlook is optimistic despite the
difficulties of daily life on the street.
She proudly announced to the students
gathered that her birthday was March 1.
"I'm 50.but I don't have a single gray hair.
Redheads don't gray." she says, taking off her
dark blue beanie, revealing a head of knotted,
but distinctly orange hair. "That's half-a-cen
tury old, but I don't lf"2l that old."
Lindy is one of dozens of homeless people
that Night Outreach visits every week. But not
all are as talkative and open as she. Some are
affected by mental illnesses and remain very
reserved while accepting the food and other
items Night Outreach provides. One man is
very outgoing, but as a Palo Alto resident for
many years, he is a diehard Stanford football
fan and refuses to talk about anything else.
Sometimes, Night Outreach members come

across people who are already asleep in their
sleeping bags, so they leave food by their side.
Started in IWS. the organization also works
with others in the area, including the Drop-In
Center next to the Red Cross near the Caltrain
station.The group also hopes to bring more at
tention to homelessness in the area, with a
sleep-out event in downtown Palo Alto in May.
Group leaders Aaron Zagory, a sophomore,
and Anh Pham, a junior, also teach a student
initiated course on Monday nights that ex
plores the issues surrounding homelessness,
from healthcare to law and education. The
group works closely with Sociology Prof. Ron
Barr. and has homeless people come into the
class to discuss their experiences.
As the students leave University Avenue,
they say they walk away changed by their
time spent with people like Lindy.
"I came tonight to be reminded of how
lucky 1 am." says junior Irene Lau.
Padovano, too. reflects on how important
his time with homeless individuals has been.
"We need these people just as much as
they need us," he says."I am reminded of this
whenever I spend time with the homeless,
treating them like the human beings that they
are. In doing so. I feel as though I am being
made whole again."

"because they're not gonna take my stuff.
They're cops."
Lindy says she enjoys the interaction with
students and freely shares details about her life.
She recounts some time she spent in a
women's detention facility.
"I don't know why but for some reason the
correctional officers liked me," she recalls. In

fact, one of them asked her to help a young in
mate who was suicidal.
"I'm 50 years old so I guess they figured I
had some wisdom," she comments. "I walked
around the yard with the young girl, and we
talked until I talked her out of it. I told her I've
been there, and it's just not worth it. She was
looking forward so far, such a long time
ahead. I told her, 'You're young, you have so
much life ahead of you, there's no need to
worry about things so far ahead."'
Lindy's advice is relevant to even the
stressed-out Stanford student every once in a
while. Her outlook is optimistic despite the
difficulties of daily life on the street.
She proudly announced to the students
gathered that her birthday was March 1.
"I'm 50.but I don't have a single gray hair.
Redheads don't gray." she says, taking off her
dark blue beanie, revealing a head of knotted,
but distinctly orange hair. "That's half-a-cen
tury old, but I don't lf"2l that old."
Lindy is one of dozens of homeless people
that Night Outreach visits every week. But not
all are as talkative and open as she. Some are
affected by mental illnesses and remain very
reserved while accepting the food and other
items Night Outreach provides. One man is
very outgoing, but as a Palo Alto resident for
many years, he is a diehard Stanford football
fan and refuses to talk about anything else.
Sometimes, Night Outreach members come

across people who are already asleep in their
sleeping bags, so they leave food by their side.
Started in IWS. the organization also works
with others in the area, including the Drop-In
Center next to the Red Cross near the Caltrain
station.The group also hopes to bring more at
tention to homelessness in the area, with a
sleep-out event in downtown Palo Alto in May.
Group leaders Aaron Zagory, a sophomore,
and Anh Pham, a junior, also teach a student
initiated course on Monday nights that ex
plores the issues surrounding homelessness,
from healthcare to law and education. The
group works closely with Sociology Prof. Ron
Barr. and has homeless people come into the
class to discuss their experiences.
As the students leave University Avenue,
they say they walk away changed by their
time spent with people like Lindy.
"I came tonight to be reminded of how
lucky 1 am." says junior Irene Lau.
Padovano, too. reflects on how important
his time with homeless individuals has been.
"We need these people just as much as
they need us," he says."I am reminded of this
whenever I spend time with the homeless,
treating them like the human beings that they
are. In doing so. I feel as though I am being
made whole again."

homelessness in the Hay Area.
If you walk around University Avenue on a
Friday night, you'll probably run into hordes of
Stanford students going out to eat or catch a
movie. One group, however, passes up the ex
travagant entrance to The Cheesecake Factory
and the warm lights of the University Cafe.
Their mission is different — they are no or
dinary group of Stanford students on a week
end jaunt around town. They comprise Night
Outreach, an organization dedicated to bring
ing support to the homeless who live in down
town Palo Alto and raising awareness about the
issues of homelessness. Instead of pausing to
look at menus posted in windows. Night Out
reach members stop at the corner of Bryant
Street and University, outside the Walgreens.
Many homeless people gather at this cor
ner with shopping carts and plastic cups full of
change. Last Friday night, a middle-aged
woman in a dark grey sweatshirt and blue
warm-up pants sat quietly watching Wal
greens' automatic doors open and close. She
is someone that Night Outreach President
Paul Padovano knows well. He approached
her warmly and joined her on the bench.
Padovano, a fourth-year philosophy grad
uate student, has only been president of the
group for two months. He offered the woman,
known by all as Lindy, a hamburger that an

other student brought from her dining hall.
"It's good to bring chewy food because a
lot of the homeless have dental issues,"
Padovano instructs students who are new to
Night Outreach's weekly excursions. Though
Lindy accepts the food, she does not eat it for
another hour- and-a-half. Instead, she and
Padovano jump into an animated discussion.
While Night Outreach offers food and basic
care to dozens of homeless, these services are
not the most important aspect of the program,
according to freshman Taiei Harimoto.
"I found that it's more than just distributing
food," Harimoto says. "Most people just need
someone to talk to. It's great to be able to listen
and interact with them like they're real people
when every day they're pretty much ignored."
As the night progressed, Lindy shared
what has been going on since the students'
last visit.
"They put Ralph in jail," she says of her
boyfriend of four years. He was arrested for
urinating in public and is now being held in
the jail's psychiatric ward.
"He's in a room that he can't leave," Lindy
says. "They have to slide the tray of food in
through a little window. But at least he gets
'three hots and a cot' as they say."
It is evident that Lindy is one of Palo Alto's
homeless who is coping relatively well given
the area's difficult circumstances.
"I'm the one who always goes to do the

laundry at the coin laundry next to 7-Eleven,"
Lindy says of the time she spends with Ralph
and other friends on the street. "None of them
are allowed in there anymore because they're
drunk all the time.They let me in because I'm
nice," she says with a smile.
"But that means I'm the maid — I do the
laundry and I do all the shopping, because
they're not let into the Walgreens anymore ei
ther," Lindy adds.
Having spent several years on and off the
streets of Palo Alto, she knows the tricks to
get by.
"At the police station at City Hall, there's a
room with chairs and a television set open al
most 24 hours a day," Lindy explains. "They
provide hot coffee and tea. I sit there and
watch 'Cops' and 'FBI:The Untold Stories.'"
Lindy says she even left her belongings —
including a sleeping bag and some clothes —
there for the night, explaining that she has
been robbed before, losing important docu
ments like her social security card.
"But it's safe there," she says of the station,
"because they're not gonna take my stuff.
They're cops."
Lindy says she enjoys the interaction with
students and freely shares details about her life.
