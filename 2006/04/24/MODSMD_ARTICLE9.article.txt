## Editorial Revisiting the SOCC controversy 
### 
Last Monday's editorial ("The SOCC: A
blight on the democratic process?"
Apr. 17) sparked a Hurry of letters,
most in strong disagreement with the piece.
The volume and intensity of the response we
received underscore the fact that racial ten
sion persists on campus, and often goes unad
dressed.
We were fully aware that by even bring
ing up race, we would find ourselves in a
minefield of opposing, heated viewpoints.
However, we believed we had something im
portant to say, and we trusted that the Stan
ford community would evaluate the issues
for themselves.
We chose to publish a piece that was
provocative and, some might say, sensation
alistic. In doing so, our intent was to generate
discourse on campus in whatever way possi
ble, including letters to the Editor.
As expected, we have received letters im
plying that the Board is comprised of racists,
bigots and white supremacists — even
though people of color account for half of its
membership. Other letter writers argues that
the Board is blatantly hostile toward the
overrepresentation of minorities.
But at the heart of most of objections to
the editorial was the assertion that no white
candidates were endorsed by the SOCC,
when in truth no white candidates applied.
We apologize for not researching the
SOCC's endorsement process more thor
oughly. We should have consulted them
about the number of white candidates that
have applied in past years, and how many of
those they endorsed. As such, before writing
this second editorial, we took the time to
email every candidate who ran for Senate
this year, to ask them what they knew about
SOCC's process and how they found out
about it.
Based on several of their responses, it is
clear that the SOCC did not inform all candi
dates about their procedure. Consequently,
many candidates were not completely aware
of the SOCC's endorsement process. And al

though some did not apply because they
were not interested in being endorsed by the
SOCC, others chose not to apply simply be
cause they believed that they would never
get the endorsement.
This self-selection is highly problematic.
Perhaps it would come as less of a surprise if
only white senators were deterred from ap
plying to the SOCC. But what about those
who were of mixed race who thought that
they would not qualify for the endorsement?
What about those who have thought them
selves not Asian enough, for instance, to
make the cut? These are not hypothetical
cases — our limited correspondence with in
volved parties have led us to believe that this
is an accurate reflection of the situation.
Ethnic communities and the SOCC —
the umbrella organization — should strive to
include those who straddle racial lines.
Equally important, some people choose not
to identify themselves solely or exclusively
according to their race. Others may be drawn
to the cultural aspect of ethnic communities,
but are turned off by the political aspects of
the SOCC. And the fact that no white candi
dates were endorsed by the SOCC shows
that there exists a mistaken perception —
shared just as much, if not more, by white stu
dents — that only people of color are able to
truly represent ethnic communities in deci
sion-making processes.
Again, it is precarious for the Editorial
Board to ask these hard questions, especially
given our anonymity. Nevertheless, we contin
ue to hope for a world — and campus —
where we can have honest conversations
about race, regardless of skin color. We are
heartened by the fact that this editorial has
prompted such emotional responses. They
have seemingly strengthened the communities
of color on campus and prompted many mem
bers of the Stanford community to reevaluate
their attitudes toward issues of race and the
meaning of multiculturalism. We hope that this
impassioned dialogue will continue well after
these editorials are long forgotten.
