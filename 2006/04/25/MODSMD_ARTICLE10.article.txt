# CSB charity organization to host annual sports competition this weekend
## GSB FACTOIDS: 
### MEGAN WATKINS MANAGING EDITOR 
In 1984, Graduate School of Business student Dun
can O'Brien decided that his fellow MBAers needed
an opportunity to give back to the community. His
sister, a Special Olympics athlete, inspiring him to
start Challenge for Charity (C4C) — an organiza
tion intended to recruit his GSB classmates to coach these
athletes.
Since then, C4C has spread beyond Stanford to become
an annual competition between the top West Coast busi
ness schools. They compete in three categories — volun
teer hours, money raised and performance at the annual
sports competition. First prize is the coveted Golden Brief
case award. While the Special Olympics is still the group's
official charity, each school also chooses what the C4C
Web site calls "a family oriented charity." Stanford's
unique charity is the Boys and Girls Club of Menlo Park.
Students volunteer there daily for a couple of hours, help
ing out with homework and participating in activity hours.
According to Stuart Rentz, president of C4C and sec
ond-year GSB student, the organization has been an im
portant part of his experience at the school.
"For me, I grew up always volunteering for Special
Olympics events and I really admire the organization," he
said. "It was part of the reason I came to Stanford. I viewed
it as an opportunity to get involved and take a leadership
role."
This year's annual competition is scheduled for this
weekend. Rentz expects roughly a thousand students to

come to campus, about half of which will be Stanford stu
dents. Similarly, about half of Stanford's GSB students be
long to C4C.To be eligible to participate in this weekend's
face-off, students must have completed a minimum of five
hours of community service throughout the year. They will
compete in everything from basketball and bowling to
trivia and this year's newest event — dodge ball. All told,
30 different sports will be represented.
The other seven schools participating this weekend are
UCLA, USC, UC-Berkeley. UC-lrvine, UC-Davis, Univer
sity of Washington and Pepperdine. Together they volun
teered 15,(MX) hours and raised $450,000 last year, making
them the largest M BA nonprofit in the country. Rentz notes.
Michael Johnson, a competitor from UC-lrvine,
drowned playing inner-tube water polo during last year's
contest. Even though there were lifeguards present and
paramedics were able to revive him, he eventually passed
away at the hospital. According to Rentz. that event will
not be held at this year's competition in light of the
tragedy. Paramedics will also be present this year to re
spond to any emergencies that may arise.
However, this weekend's competition is not the only
event on the C4C's docket. They also hold a Charity Auc
tion, the group's largest fundraiser.This year's auction was
held on April 14.
"This year was another record breaking year," Rentz
said. "We raised over $ 12(),(MH). C4C will get approximate
ly two-thirds of that money, and the other one-third will go
to YES Reading and BUILD."
The Charity Auction is both a silent and live auction.The
majority of the items are student donations ranging from

golf and tennis lessons to a meal prepared for 12. They also
have a few big ticket items every year contributed by GSB
alums, like lunch with a big time executive.
In keeping with the Special Olympics focus, C4C holds
two sports clinics every year, during which they host Spe
cial Olympics athletes on campus to run drills and interact
with Stanford athletes. On a more regular basis, members
help out at weekly Special Olympics practices.
According to Rentz, C4C also gives students a chance
to let loose with a little friendly rivalry.
"We're pretty competitive at the Business School when
it comes to athletics," he said. "This is a chance for all of us
who have been athletes to get out there and relive our
glory days."
