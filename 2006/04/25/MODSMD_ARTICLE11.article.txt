## Editorial Admit Weekend needs more focused planning 
### 
Admit Weekend has come and gone —
freshman dorms have lost half their
population, sexually frustrated stu
dents have abandoned futile plans to hook
up with ProFros and the alcohol can be put
back in the fridge.
This year's Admit Weekend was more ex
citing than most — the sun stayed out most
of the time, and President George W. Bush
made a brief cameo — well, almost. Never
theless, we think it valuable to reflect on the
class of Oh Ten's first taste of Stanford life.
In its current form. Admit Weekend in
cludes elements that seem designed to dis
courage as many high school seniors as pos
sible from choosing Stanford. Don't get us
wrong, the Admit Weekend team bends over
backward to make ProFros feel at home on
the Farm. Yet instead of portraying the col
lege as the best four years of their lives.
Admit Weekend often depicts life here as
isolated, awkward and socially lacking.
Take for instance the campus-wide par
ties combining ProFros from GovCo to
Cedro. Throwing 1,500 high school seniors
— who at most knew one or two other peo
ple here before this weekend — together for
a party is a great recipe for awkward, uncom
fortable interaction.
The most likely scenario is this: Each
Pro Fro would probably stick with the other
ProFros they sort-of know already from
staying in the same dorm. Most conversa
tions would abound with inane questions
ranging from "What's your name?","Where
are you staying?", "How do you like Stan
ford?" and "Do you think you're going to
come here?", followed by awful silence. Per
haps. if they're lucky, they'll have somewhat
more profound conversations. But what if
they want to meet up later in the weekend?
They'll probably be staying in different
dorms halfway across campus from each
other.
Instead, consider an alternative scenario
in which more activities are centered around
individual dorms and halls. This would go a

long way to reduce awkwardness and in
crease Pro Fro participation. HoHos deserve
a pat on the back for working to coordinate
icebreakers and other social events in their
dorms — which hopefully help ProFros to
get to know the 20 or 30 other ProFros in
their dorms better. This way, ProFros would
get to know a smaller group of friends they
can count on seeing again if they came to
Stanford in the fall. But HoHos need to have
more help from the Admit Weekend coordi
nators if they are going to succeed.
Also, there are several artificial social situ
ations that distort the ProFros' picture of
Stanford and disrupt regular campus life.
We're talking about the campus-wide dry pol
icy for Admit Weekend and various restric
tions on Pro Fro drinking. Sure, these policies
can be enforced — that's not the problem.
The problem is that admitted students don't
really get a feel for what Stanford is like.
At the very least, fraternities and co-ops
should be able to hold parties that only
SUID holders are allowed to attend, so that
Stanford students who want to drink can.
Better solutions include organizing parties
with both alcohol and EANABs available.
ProFros without college drinking experi
ence should be responsible, and RoHos and
students in general should look after them
— but there is no reason why alcohol and
Admit Weekend can't be mixed responsibly.
Admit Weekend should, in many re
spects, be more similar to New Student Ori
entation. During NSO, students bond
through common activities with the students
they'll be living with for the next year. By the
end of the week, most students have formed
a group of friends who they're comfortable
with and are ready to face the new year with
confidence. How many ProFros can say the
same thing about Admit Weekend?
ProFros who come here for Admit Week
end want to know what life at Stanford is re
ally like. Let's not distort the picture by im
posing unrealistic restrictions and creating
awkward situations.
