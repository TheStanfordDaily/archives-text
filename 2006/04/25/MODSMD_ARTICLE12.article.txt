# The birth of a column
## 
### 
Monday: I decide that this will be (he
week when, for once, 1 get an early
start on my column. Then 1 realize
that last week's column hasn't even gone to
print yet. and 1 really don't want to be one of
those people who starts working on the next
assignment before the previous one is due.
This reminds me that I have a problem set
due tomorrow that I haven't even started.
Since 1 am not working on my homework, I
reason that there is no way I can justify work
ing on a column that isn't even worth a single
unit. As a compromise, 1 begin neither and go
to Late Nite instead.
Tliesday: I email myTA and tell him that I
have a column to write and won't be able to
turn my problem set in until tomorrow. I
spend the afternoon at the gym with a friend,
gossiping about the weekend's events.
Around the time we've heard and analyzed
each other's stories six or seven times, I re
member my problem set and reluctantly re
turn to my room to do work.
I finish my last equation and fourth Diet
Coke at 5 a.m., by which point I realize that I
am no longer sleepy. I decide that this is the
perfect time to start my column. 1 open up a
new document in Microsoft Word. Then, as 1
stare at the screen, I notice that if you tilt your
head just right you can make out animal
shapes in the eerie-glow of the monitor. My
eyes begin to glaze over.
Wednesday: I wake up with the imprint of
a keyboard on my face. I decide that having
letters imprinted on my forehead constitutes

enough writing for the day. Nevertheless, I
keep Word opened on my computer, hoping
that I will be inspired to type a couple of sen
tences when I come back to check my email at
lunchtime. I am not.
Thursday: 1 actually have the time and mo
tivation to work today, but, alas, writer's block
strikes. 1 re-watch the first season of The O.C.
instead.
Friday: It crosses my mind that 1 should
start writing, because my deadline is in less
than 24 hours. I then remember that tonight is
the girl down the hall's birthday party, and 1
don't have anything to wear. I deal with the
more daunting issue of the two.
Saturday: After lingering at the brunch
table for over an hour, 1 head back to my
room upstairs. My column is due in just a few
short hours, but I'm not worried. I've written
research papers in less time than this. 1 open
up my blank Word document and position my
fingertips over the keyboard. Nothing hap
pens. I open up Firefox and skim the head-
