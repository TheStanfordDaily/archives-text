# The 						birth of a column
## 
### 
Monday: I decide that this will be (he
week when, for once, 1 get an early
start on my column. Then 1 realize
that last week's column hasn't even gone to
print yet. and 1 really don't want to be one of
those people who starts working on the next
assignment before the previous one is due.
This reminds me that I have a problem set
due tomorrow that I haven't even started.
Since 1 am not working on my homework, I
reason that there is no way I can justify work
ing on a column that isn't even worth a single
unit. As a compromise, 1 begin neither and go
to Late Nite instead.
Tliesday: I email myTA and tell him that I
have a column to write and won't be able to
turn my problem set in until tomorrow. I
spend the afternoon at the gym with a friend,
gossiping about the weekend's events.
Around the time we've heard and analyzed
each other's stories six or seven times, I re
member my problem set and reluctantly re
turn to my room to do work.
I finish my last equation and fourth Diet
Coke at 5 a.m., by which point I realize that I
am no longer sleepy. I decide that this is the
perfect time to start my column. 1 open up a
new document in Microsoft Word. Then, as 1
stare at the screen, I notice that if you tilt your
head just right you can make out animal
shapes in the eerie-glow of the monitor. My
eyes begin to glaze over.
Wednesday: I wake up with the imprint of
a keyboard on my face. I decide that having
letters imprinted on my forehead constitutes

enough writing for the day. Nevertheless, I
keep Word opened on my computer, hoping
that I will be inspired to type a couple of sen
tences when I come back to check my email at
lunchtime. I am not.
Thursday: 1 actually have the time and mo
tivation to work today, but, alas, writer's block
strikes. 1 re-watch the first season of The O.C.
instead.
Friday: It crosses my mind that 1 should
start writing, because my deadline is in less
than 24 hours. I then remember that tonight is
the girl down the hall's birthday party, and 1
don't have anything to wear. I deal with the
more daunting issue of the two.
Saturday: After lingering at the brunch
table for over an hour, 1 head back to my
room upstairs. My column is due in just a few
short hours, but I'm not worried. I've written
research papers in less time than this. 1 open
up my blank Word document and position my
fingertips over the keyboard. Nothing hap
pens. I open up Firefox and skim the head-


Stephanie
Alessi
lines on CNN.com, hoping that a
word will jump out at me. I don't find
any good column ideas, but I do learn
that Leonardo DiCaprio is in Johan
nesburg recovering from an injury
that he suffered on the set of his new
movie.
Lost for inspiration, I open up the
list of story ideas that I had to send in
when I applied to be a columnist. As I
skim the list, I wonder how I got cho
sen for this position if this is what I
came up with. I close my eyes, ran
domly point to a topic and type a title
on my Word document. CTRL+S.
Saved. The hard part is done. To re
ward myself, I decide to log onto
Facebook for five minutes.
Twer.ty minutes later, I realize that
my room is not conducive to getting
work done. I also really want a vanil
la Chai. So I pack up my laptop and
trek over to the CoHo, where 1 order
a drink and set up camp. With my
wireless disabled, 1 work straight
through until closing time. By this

point, all the CoHo employees are
giving me dirty looks as they wipe
down every table but the one I am
still occupying. But it doesn't matter,
because I have just completed and
sent in my column, only an hour after
my deadline. 1 try to avoid the CoHo
people's glares on my way out, vow
ing to start next week's column as
soon as possible.
Sunday: Exhausted from yester
day's marathon writing session, I de
vote the day to anything and every
thing unrelated to writing. I spend the
majority of my waking hours waiting
in the omelet line at Stern and then
talking on the phone with my mom as
she catches me up on the latest gossip
from home. Something along the way
triggers a great column idea, but by
the time I get back to my room, I can't
remember what I was going to say
about omelets and/or small-town
gossip that I could have possibly
stretched into a 750-word column. 1
shrug, unconcerned. I have an entire
week to come up with something.
