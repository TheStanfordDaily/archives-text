# The 						German thing
## 
### 
There's no patriotism in Germany. It's not
allowed. Schools don't instill national
pride in their kids — in fact, it's just the
opposite. They sing the national anthem, but
only the third verse — the others have lines like
"Deutschland, Deutschland, über alles (over
all the others)," a hit too suggestive, too proud.
And people don't call it the fatherland any
more.
Back in early December, I was talking to my
friend Dave about Berlin — I heard the club
scene was awesome, I could drink legally, 1
probably wouldn't come back. "I'd never go to
Germany, man," he said, his chipper Chicago
accent slipping into something almost serious. 1
asked him why. He gave me a look. 1 remem
bered he was Jewish.
Germans are maddening, no-bullshit, amus
ingly self-centered, surprisingly generous, ex
tremely helpful and awkwardly straightfor
ward. Their cuisine is meat — or rather, given
their portion size, M EAT. They are very open to
foreigners — Eric Schosser noted in "Fast
F(xxl Nation" that Germany is one of the
world's most culturally Americanized nations,
with 50 Berlin McDonald's and American
music everywhere (I asked my language part
ner about German music; she laughed). They
don't take tips.Ten percent of Germans are un
employed — that's a lot of drunks sleeping on
benches, trumpeters playing subways for pen
nies, guys selling roses in restaurants for a cou
ple Euros. Most Berliners are liberal — lots of
young people, artists, foreigners and marijuana
mixing with old-timers who lived through the
Wall (and mostly didn't get married). It's differ
ent in the South, where people are older, tradi
tions are stronger and foreign kids on Spring
Break fill the beer halls that were popular with
the National Socialist party some 70 years ago.
So Germans aren't nationalistic. One girl

told me that whatever pride they do feel is for
Europe. There's something beautiful there —
you would soon wish we felt any kind of kinship
with Canada and Mexico — and something
sad.
No matter what happens, there will always
be the German thing hovering in the back
ground. The first time kids anywhere learn
about Germans — from school, parents or
movies — there's probably a swastika involved.
It's so much different from our country, with
the American Dream, Mark Twain, Uncle Sam
and apple pie obscuring the fact that we have a
lot to answer for, too. There's the Indian thing,
the Japanese internment camp thing, the slav
ery thing and the racism thing for a century
after that (or even up to today, if you're a real
ist or a "Crash" liberal). Now there's the illegal
immigrant thing. The Minutemen — those jin
goistic afterbirths firing their guns at fence
jumping illegals who just want to pick strawber
ries at slave wages — have more in common
with the Beer Hall crowds applauding Adolf, or
with the dissatisfied French who voted for the
neo-fascist Le Pen, than any Jefferson or Wash
ington I know.
We don't learn too much about America's
badness in grade school — or if we do, it's in a
hindsight-optimistic fashion. Jackson screwed
over the Indians (now he's on the 20). Jefferson
just screwed his slaves. The Emancipation

Proclamation was mostly political and, at the
time, useless. Woodrow Wilson loved "Birth of
a Nation," the movie that restarted the Ku Klux
Klan.Then there's the Bay of Pigs, Iran-Contra.
that time in the '80s when Rumsfeld shook Sad
dam's hand.
I'm not comparing the United States to the
Nazis. But consider: What is the scale of unbe
lievable tragedy that makes some things forgiv
able, or at least forgettable (when'sthe last time
you thought of Native Americans that didn't in
volve a casino), while others linger on for
decades? There haven't been any films made
about The Great Leap Forward, Pol Pot or
Ethiopia (though you can't blame Hollywood;
none of those involved white people).
Every country has a tortured history; few
choose to acknowledge it, or learn from it.
That's why Germany is a special case — histo
ry is forced on them, and rightfully so.They live
with the badness in their history — some
would call it the worst thing in history — every
day. There are posters all around Berlin for
"The Music of the Third Reich."There's a soc
cer field next to the Dachau concentration
camp.They live with it, and they keep moving.
There's very little nostalgia, no sense of na
tional perfection. Meanwhile, France, the most
patriotic country in the world, is tearing itself
apart with race riots, student demonstrations,
strikes and anti-immigration movements
(hello! ),all of which are tied into the notion that
French culture is being destroyed by globaliza
tion, foreigners, McDonald's, whatever.
The United States is a lot like France, ex
cept we just keep on growing. But cracks are
forming; our government is getting crazier and
less effective; our economy is dogshit. We're
making the same old mistakes; neo-con war

hawks (War of 1812), cronyism and
corruption (the 19205), liberals in dis
array (pick a date). Why is it so hard
for us to learn from our insatiably
nasty history? Why is our national
past draped in nostalgia, when, ever
since Shays' Rebellion, it's been a
whole lot of blood, greed and
zealotry? Why, how can we be patriot
ic when every ethnicity (except

white), every religion (except Chris
tianity) and every other country in the
world (maybe not Monaco) has beef
with us? Germans are not bad people
(except for that asshole Dresden wait
er with the fauxhawk), but the evil in
their country's history is a part of
them. They know this, and they con
front it. When will Americans start to
acknowledge the American thing?
