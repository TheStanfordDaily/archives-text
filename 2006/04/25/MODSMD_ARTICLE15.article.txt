## Faculty speak out against war 
### ROBERT POLHEMUS 
Our thanks to the hundreds of students who
sent the wake-up call on Friday. We of the
Stanford Faculty Against the War congratu
late them and others who peacefully protested the
Bush war policies in front of the Htxiver Institute.
This sudden, spontaneous demonstration is crucial
evidence of just how worried people are — not
only about the failed old war in Iraq, but about a
shaky administration that mumbles and leaks
about attacking the Iran regime and keeping its
first-strike nuclear bombing options "on the table."
American universities and colleges really do need
Stanford's good Friday lesson. If American citizens
don't work tostopit,thc menacing possibility of an
other "war of choice" and air strikes against Iran
can lead to a far-reaching reality even worse than
the Iraq disaster —one whose dire fallout for our
selves, our children and indeed for global civiliza
tion would seem to be, s<x>ner or later, inevitable.

Right now, it is urgent to avoid precipitous, rash
military action against Iran with unpredictable con
sequences. In the last year, this university has deter
mined to use new educational resources to address
and try to solve pressing international problems.
None looms larger now than relations between the
United States and Iran; none should have a more
important claim on Stanford's attention, expertise,
organizational energy and resources. All of us here
— students faculty and staff — who care about
hopes for the future, the fostering of peace and the
real interests of this nation, need to pay attention to
the Iran issue, inform ourselves about it in all ways
that we can, make it personal, understand that it
isn't going to go away soon and insist that it must be
resolved peacefully and intelligently. Thoughtful
diplomatic strategies need be devised and then very
patiently deployed.The Iran matter has the real po
tential to do to the 21st century what Europe's
needlessly stumbling into World War 1
— with its momentous, unforeseen ef
fects and its unprecedented slaughter
of populations — did to the whole
20th century.
Whatever their feelings or ideas
before the Iraq war, most people who
try to think carefully and with some
objectivity know by now that it has
been catastrophic. Despite the natu
ral, if icy, self-justification of a few
frozen egos in power that got it wrong
and can't admit it, it's obvious that the
invasion and occupation have done
very grave damage. The war has
caused an obscene and unnecessary
amount of death and ruin. It has pro
duced an unstable client state that ap
pears to be dissolving in the violent
wash of "ethnic cleansing" and the
reeking gusher of oil greed. Draining
our resources, it has set loose a gigan
tic hemorrhage of billions of bloody,
wasted dollars sinking uselessly in
devastated ground (or dirty pockets)
— money that Americans could and

should be spending positively on "life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"
(such as developing alternative ener
gy sources), it seems now to have led
only to the prospect of a semi-perpet
ual occupation by U.S. garrisons based
in semi-permanent colonial bases.
We stress that the Iraq war has
made the United States and all coun
tries less safe from violence and ter
ror. It has hardened anti-American
ism and anti-Semitism and alienated
people all over the world on whom
the information and cooperation nec
essary to expose terrorism depends. It
has been a boon for the forces of fa
natic religious militancy, intolerance
and apocalyptic extremism of all
kinds in the Middle East and every
where. It has divided our country and
sapped the broad-based political con
fidence and sense of the common
good on which a flourishing democra
cy finally depends. It has strength
ened, not lessened or controlled, the
determination and ability of war —
threatened populations and bellicose
leaders to seek and possess nuclear
weapons (because, supposedly, they
serve as the great equalizer and insur
ance policy in disputes with mightier
nations), and it has weakened the
ability to stop them.
The dogs of this irresponsible,
morally shoddy war were loosed by
axe-grinding civilian ideologues,
most of whom had no personal expe
rience of military combat or its hor
rors. They relied on misinformation
and lies (Iraq's non-existent
Weapons of Mass Destruction) and
worked hard and effectively to make
the public erroneously believe that
Sep. 11 had something to do with
Iraq. Their ill-conceived, arrogant
plans lacked both common sense and
foresight. Iraq was sold as some sort
of national response to Sep. 11 and to
the murderousness of Osama bin
Laden (who is, in fact, an ideological
enemy of Saddam Hussein). The

Bush administration launched the
war with astonishingly little serious
and informed discussion in the
media, in public forums or in repre
sentative political bodies.
We mustn't let this happen again.
The protests and analytical argu
ments by Stanford faculty and stu
dents against the Iraqi war three
years ago proved to be amazingly ac
curate — right on the money — but,
like the Iraq antiwar movements
across the nation, they came too late
to matter. Now we have a healthy new
public skepticism about this adminis
tration's competence and —let's
hope—a bit of time to make the intel
lectual case against bombing-"nuk
ing," as one contingency planner al
legedly said — or invading Iraq, and
also against the folly of keeping large
numbers of troops in the Middle East
as imperialist enforcers. The universi
ty is a great place to do this.
In the coming days and months
moving into and through the sum
mer, the Stanford Faculty Against the
War means to work with students, fac
ulty and other campus groups to
sponsor panels, facilitate debates, or
ganize discussions and Internet blogs,
give talks in the dorms, and present
many points of view in and out of
classes. In the fall we plan to help or
ganize for the campus a major confer
ence and teach-in of international im
portance on the subject of Iran and
Iraq. Our goal is to work to discuss all
facets of the Iran problem — the reli
gious, psychological, historical, ethnic
and anthropological, as well as the
geo-political, economic and military
— and to do our bit to keep it from
exploding. In democracy, which our
nation wants to promote, it is up to
the people to be the deciders.
