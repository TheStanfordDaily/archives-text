# A 						peaceful protester explains
## 
### CAROLINE PLETCHER-MARTIN 
As one of the protesters detained on
Friday afternoon. I want to clarify
some of the issues brought up in yes
terday's Daily and give people a chance to
understand the motivations for my actions a
bit more clearly. It saddens me greatly to see
some people display the same dismissive big
otry and unwillingness to accept differences
as exhibited by the current administration.
First of all, being arrested does not imply
that your protest was not peaceful. Peaceful
protest can certainly be disruptive — in fact
it is a choice to utilize disruption rather than
violence that defines the action. With the cur
rent Bush administration wielding power
based on fear, threats and misinformation,
the very least you can do as a citizen is to
stand up against blatant intimidation utiliz
ing these tactics. As an educated elite, we take

for granted having a voice other than protest,
but for many, this is the only effective way of
being heard.
A letter published in yesterday's Daily
("Stanford should welcome all visitors," Apr.
24) argued that Stanford should give all visi
tors an opportunity to express themselves.
Strangely, Bush did not arrive on campus to
speak or interact with the community. Instead,
he made every effort to avoid any interaction
with the people that a president is supposed to
represent. Bush has had ample opportunity to
express himself in the last six years and I am
fairly certain that nothing on Friday will pre
vent him from doingso in the future. I stood up
and sat down on Friday for my right to be
heard as a citizen who cannot watch quietly
while a useless war rages on and my civil liber
ties disappear.
Democracy cannot function with blind
support for positions of power.

Those positions must be contingent on
wielding them with responsibility, empathy
and justice or the power itself should not
only he questioned, but challenged. Every
citizen of a democratic nation must take re
sponsibility for the actions of their govern
ment. No human being who spreads vio
lence, desecrates the Earth, tramples on civil
liberties or disrespects my body as a woman
will ever be welcomed with open arms into
my home. Not resisting Bush out of respect
for authority is just as g<x>d as supporting his
politics.
1 do not believe in resisting power for the
sake of resistance; I feel that you can simulta
neously stand up against corrupt authority
while respecting fellow human beings at an
individual level. I respected those officers
who respected me and simply demanded my
rights from those who did not. Howev
er, I do not believe that the original in
tent of law officials was to protect the
government from its own people.
I am proud of our campus 1 am
proud of every single citizen who will
not tolerate the presence of hatred,
racism and oppression in their com
munity. I hope the younger students
recognized the sneaky nature of the
current government and the very real
threat of living in a police state. But 1
really think the ultimate revolution
lies in being happy and internally
peaceful so that fighting injustice be
comes an inherent compulsion. 1 had
two signs at the protest and one of
them read: "End Oppression. Be
Happy" My path of true resistance lies
in dancing, laughter and a joyful spirit.
I wish the same discovery for everyone
here today.
