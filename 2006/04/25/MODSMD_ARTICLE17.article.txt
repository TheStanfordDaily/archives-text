## TRACK Women take 112th Big Meet at Cal Sarah Hopping breaks her own school record in the hammer throw 
### ISRAEL ROJAS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
What makes a day good? Perhaps learning that
all of your classes were cancelled. Or maybe find
ing a $20 bill in an old pair of pants. But if your idea
of a good day includes breaking records, then you
may have more in common with the women's
track team than you think.
The Cardinal's trip across the Bay to Berkeley
ended with mixed results. While the women en
joyed victory, the 112 th Big Meet ended in disap
pointment for the men as the California men came
away with a 95 2/3 to 671/3 victory.The score ended
in fractions for the first time since 1%2, when the
Stanford men beat the Bears 88 1/3 to 42 2/3.
The men's most successful performer was soph
omore Wopamo Osaisai, who claimed victory in
the 100 meter (10.62 seconds) and the 200 meter
(21.44 seconds) events.
Other athletes who won their events included
sophomores Russell Brown in the 1500 meter
(3:47.99 minutes), Neftalem Araia in the 5000 me
ters (14:12.94 minutes) and Benjamin Dickens in
the pole vault (15-1 feet). Junior Jonathan Pierce
took first in the 3000 meter steeplechase (9:02.76
minutes), Josh Hustedt took the long jump (24-4
1/2 feet) and senior Feranmi Okanlami won in the
triple jump (47-8 1/2 feet).
In the 17th Big Meet between the women's
teams, Stanford came away with a healthy 17-point
victory over the Golden Bears, 89-72. The women
approached the meet confident in their abilities,
and it showed in their execution.
"I went out to Big Meet to win, as I do every
where I go," sophomore Chauntae Bayne-Hackett
said.
Bayne-Hackett had a strong meet, scoring sev
eral points for the Cardinal. She won the 100 me
ters (11.32 seconds) and the 2(X) meters (23.01 sec
onds) with times that set Big Meet records. Bayne-
Hackett also ran the second leg of the winning
4XIOO meter relay team, which tallied a time of
44.73 seconds — good enough for third best in
school history.
Joining Bayne-Hackett in record book-rewrit
ing was senior Sarah Hopping. Entering her final
Big Meet, Hopping demonstrated time and again
why she is one of the best hammer throwers in the
Pac-10. Her previous school record lasted just a
week, as Hopping's second throw of 210 feet was
enough to break the mark. Hopping was just get
ting warmed up, though, as she improved to 210-5
ft on her fourth throw before finally ending with
211-4 ft on her sixth and final attempt. The mark
ranks seventh-best in Pac-10 history.
Sophomore Erica McLain also joined the fun
with victories in two jumping events. McLain
jumped 20-10 feet to win the long jump and 44-0
3/4 feet — also a Big Meet record — in the triple
jump.
The Cardinal swept the 5000 meter race with
junior twins Katy and Amanda Trotter taking first
and second, and Lambie finishing third. The three
runners finished together, with about two-tenths
of a second differential between the winning and
third place times.
"My favorite part was being part of a powerful block of Stan
ford runners controlling the 5K race," Lambie said.
Other events that the Stanford women claimed were the 800
meter, 1500 meter, the javelin, the pole vault and the shot put, but
the team favorite was the 1600 meter relay.
"My favorite part of the meet was the end, when [senior]
Nashonme [Johnson] came down the homestretch in first and
raised the baton high to symbolize another victory under our
belts," Bayne-Hackett said.
"We knew we had won [the meet], but the girls still put out
everything to win [the mile relay] and they did," Lambie added.
Because it was a dual meet with rival Berkeley, the atmos
phere was a little more intense than usual, with a certain 'Beat
Cal' feeling going.The increased energy was certainly helpful, as
more than 20 athletes qualified for the NCAA regional meet.
Starting with Hopping at the beginning of the meet, athletes
stepped up all around to support each other.
"We approached the meet with the attitude, 'We're sup
posed to win this so let's just make it happen again,'" Bayne-
Hackett said.
