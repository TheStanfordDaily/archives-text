This week's Through My Eyes comes from Lejla Hodzic, a sopho
more from nearby Cupertino and a clutch doubles player for the No.
1 Stanford women's tennis team. In the team's last regular season
match against California on Saturday, Lejla and No. 3 doubles part
ner Jessica Nguyen defeated Claire Ilcinkas and Marion Ravelo
jaona,B-2,t0 help propel the Cardinal through a 7-0 shutout. Lejla has
worked hard to recover from a severe ankle sprain this year and re
gain her commanding presence on the courts:
Battling back
1 didn't really fight off the whole injury until about a month ago.
It's been a tough road, but it has made all the difference to have a lot
of patience with the injury. As I've waited for the injury to get better,
I have just been working and doing as much as possible off the courts.
I kept my conditioning up and that has helped me move a lot better
during matches.
This season, I feel like my ankle did not flair up in most of the
matches I played. Sometimes it gets swollen, but it's progress. Due in
part to my injury, I'm playing the same spot on the team as I was last
year. Next year, I hope I'll be able to make a bigger name for myself
on the courts.
Family ties
At least one member of my family shows up at almost every
match. In our big showdown against Cal on Saturday, my cousin,
uncle, grandma and great-aunt showed up.
My whole family lives within half an hour driving distance from
here. I feel like we've always been really close. I usually go home for
family dinners on Sundays, and from time to time I have lunch with
my mom at Cantor [Arts Center]. Last night, I went to my aunt's

birthday celebration and there were a whole bunch of us there, prob
ably 10 in total.
Staying close to my family wasn't initially a huge factor in my de
cision to come to Stanford. I knew right away that I wanted to stay in
California and not go too far away. In retrospect, I'm even more grate
ful for having chosen Stanford; I think it's made me even closer to my
family.
I have one brother who is 24 and currently works in San Francis
co. He used to be a big tennis player himself He played at the Univer
sity of New Mexico. As the little sister, I used to always get beaten by
