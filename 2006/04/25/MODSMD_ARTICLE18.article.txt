# THROUGH my EYES
## CLOSE TO HOME Cupertino native Lejla Hodzic has battled through an injury to become a major contributor 
### MIA LEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This week's Through My Eyes comes from Lejla Hodzic, a sopho
more from nearby Cupertino and a clutch doubles player for the No.
1 Stanford women's tennis team. In the team's last regular season
match against California on Saturday, Lejla and No. 3 doubles part
ner Jessica Nguyen defeated Claire Ilcinkas and Marion Ravelo
jaona,B-2,t0 help propel the Cardinal through a 7-0 shutout. Lejla has
worked hard to recover from a severe ankle sprain this year and re
gain her commanding presence on the courts:
Battling back
1 didn't really fight off the whole injury until about a month ago.
It's been a tough road, but it has made all the difference to have a lot
of patience with the injury. As I've waited for the injury to get better,
I have just been working and doing as much as possible off the courts.
I kept my conditioning up and that has helped me move a lot better
during matches.
This season, I feel like my ankle did not flair up in most of the
matches I played. Sometimes it gets swollen, but it's progress. Due in
part to my injury, I'm playing the same spot on the team as I was last
year. Next year, I hope I'll be able to make a bigger name for myself
on the courts.
Family ties
At least one member of my family shows up at almost every
match. In our big showdown against Cal on Saturday, my cousin,
uncle, grandma and great-aunt showed up.
My whole family lives within half an hour driving distance from
here. I feel like we've always been really close. I usually go home for
family dinners on Sundays, and from time to time I have lunch with
my mom at Cantor [Arts Center]. Last night, I went to my aunt's

birthday celebration and there were a whole bunch of us there, prob
ably 10 in total.
Staying close to my family wasn't initially a huge factor in my de
cision to come to Stanford. I knew right away that I wanted to stay in
California and not go too far away. In retrospect, I'm even more grate
ful for having chosen Stanford; I think it's made me even closer to my
family.
I have one brother who is 24 and currently works in San Francis
co. He used to be a big tennis player himself He played at the Univer
sity of New Mexico. As the little sister, I used to always get beaten by

him when we played together, and he still
claims that he'd kill me on the courts if we
faced off again. But considering he hasn't
played in over a year, I have my doubts.
There is no T in 'team'
It's been a growing experience for me to
be part of a team. As I've been able to associ
ate with the girls more, I've found that every
one is kind of on the same page and I've had
a lot more respect for the team dynamic. It
was definitely something I was grateful for
during my injury. All the girls were really

concerned and they would check in to see
how I was doing.
In terms of closeness, 1 would say that
people tend to bond along class lines. I came
in with Whitney [Deason) last year, and we
helped each other get used to the college ex
perience. Celia [Durkin] just transferred this
year, and she's also been really fun to hang
out with.
Major madness
After toying around with being a Psych
or IR major, I finally settled on Communica
tions last month. I've loved the major since 1
took a class last quarter, entitled Media
Process and Effects. Both professors were
really engaging, and made me aware of an
area of societal influence that a lot of people
overlook.

I'm not sure what specific area of commu
nications I want to pursue at this point. I'm
leaning away from journalism and towards
marketing or advertising. But I'm young, so
we'll see.
In addition to the rewarding academic ex
perience I'm having here, 1 feel strongly
about the Stanford community and how wel
coming its members are. I've met so many
new people, even this year in Toyon, and it's
nice to be able to branch out and have differ
ent groups of friends all over. I feel as though
everyone brings a fresh, new attitude to the
table. You can be yourself and totally get
along with everyone.
I don't know if there's anything I would
change about my experience here. Being a
student athlete is such an important part of
my life, especially in such a challenging en

vironment. 1 had been considering schools
that weren't as strong academically, like Cal
and UCLA, and I'm so happy with my ulti
mate decision. It's hard at times, but 1 have
no regrets â€” this place builds self-disci
pline.
Oh, but on a less serious note, Ill go ahead
and answer the "stranded on a desert island"
question. If there was only one thing 1 could
take with me, it would be an endless supply of
paper. I'm going to bend the rules and throw
in a pen with infinite ink. If I'm stranded, I'm
going to be very introspective and want to
record all my new insights.
If had to take a person to this island, I'd def
initely take [teammate] Theresa [Logar]. She
would entertain me all day long and think of
different schemes to get us off the island.
They'd all fail, but it'd be pretty hilarious.
