# A 						look inside Bush's meeting with Hoover fellows and Hennessy
## WHAT HAPPENED To be blocking streets and not allowing a meeting to take place was disappointing and discouraging. 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
President George W. Bush made a surprise visit to
support troops at a base in Iraq for Thanksgiving in 2(X)3.
Similarly, he swooped into Stanford for what was sup
posed to be a surprise visit to support the scholars in
their war of ideas at the Hoover Institution last Friday.
In both cases, the commander-in-chief visited mostly ar
dent supporters in a region that has proved anything but
welcoming. In both cases, there were vocal opponents to
his presence.
ITie Hoover Institution, long a bastion of conserva
tive and libertarian thinking in an otherwise left-leaning
University community, planned to sponsor Bush at a
meeting in a new conference room at the Lou Henry
Hoover building. Instead, the president was forced to

meet with selected fellows at the home of former Secre
tary of State George Shultz after his motorcade was
rerouted.
Thirty-five Hoover fellows and other Stanford facul
ty — including University President John Hennessy and
Provost John Etchemendy — sat with Bush for about 75
minutes.
"It was a back and forth discussion about events in the
realm of public policy," said Hoover Institution Director
John Raisian, who co-hosted the event with Shultz.
Raisian told The Daily on Monday that the discus
sion was wide-ranging and covered the "whole gamut."
But he specifically mentioned Iraq, nuclear prolifera
tion, Social Security and Medicare as issues broached
during what he called a "very friendly, very spirited" dis
cussion.
Raisian said that the discussion was casual and with

out a formal agenda.
"The president was on top of his game and per
formed well," he said.
After the discussion. Bush had a small,private dinner
with Shultz and others. Raisian declined to say how
many people were there or who was invited. Shultz had
made the invitation lists for both events.
The president boarded Marine One at 7:25 p.m. for
St. 1 lelena. 60 miles north of campus in the Napa Valley.
After a 35-minute helicopter trip. Bush spent the night at
the Meadowood Napa Valley Resort.
For decades. Hoover has been an institution leaders
turn to for advice. Reagan met with Hoover fellows
when he was running for president in 1980. Bush met
Condoleezza Rice — former Stanford provost and cur-
rent secretary' of state — while visit
ing the Institution in 1999.
Yet at this recent meeting, the fel
lows spoke with Bush about issues
the country might face.
"In this case, the president has two
to two-and-a-half years left to form a
program for what he wants to accom
plish." he said.
The meeting, he added, did not
delve into ruminations about Bush's
legacy.
"He wasn't really here to ask us for
advice." Raisian said."He was here to
be friendly and answer questions."
The Bush administration has
caused something of a brain drain.

pulling some of the best and brightest
from the Institution to fill crucial
posts. In February, Bush tapped
Hoover Fellow Edward Lazear to be
come chairman of the Council of Eco
nomic Advisers. Lazear was handily
confirmed to the post left vacant by
Ben Bernanke, who replaced Alan
Greenspan as Chairman of the Feder
al Reserve. Hoover Senior Fellow and
Economics Prof. John Taylor was
number three in the Treasury Depart
ment. Hoover Senior Fellow John
Cogan has been a prominent econom
ics adviser to Bush. Shultz was Ronald
Reagan's Secretary of State.
"If you suitably impress Hoover
fellows, you can turn to them for ad
vice," said Bill Whalen. a research fel
low at the Institution, in a phone inter
view with The Daily. "Advice you
would be hard pressed to find other
wise."

Raisian said that he was disap
pointed the protests forced the
change in venue. He said that rela
tively few were able to dictate the
change of plans and that most of the
protesters were not from campus. He
said he was proud of the student
hody in general, but upset at the
small minority who caused trouble.
"People who came to campus who
aren't from here significantly impact
ed the outcome of the event,"he said.
"We had to quickly change the venue
because we couldn't get in here at
Hoover. My own pulse on things was
that the campus was excited and in
terested that he was going to drop by.
"It's one thing to demonstrate, but
it's another to completely shut down
the meeting," he continued. "To be
