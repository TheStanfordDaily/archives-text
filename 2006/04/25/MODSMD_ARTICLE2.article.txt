# A look inside Bush's meeting with Hoover fellows and Hennessy
## WHAT HAPPENED To be blocking streets and not allowing a meeting to take place was disappointing and discouraging. 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
President George W. Bush made a surprise visit to
support troops at a base in Iraq for Thanksgiving in 2(X)3.
Similarly, he swooped into Stanford for what was sup
posed to be a surprise visit to support the scholars in
their war of ideas at the Hoover Institution last Friday.
In both cases, the commander-in-chief visited mostly ar
dent supporters in a region that has proved anything but
welcoming. In both cases, there were vocal opponents to
his presence.
ITie Hoover Institution, long a bastion of conserva
tive and libertarian thinking in an otherwise left-leaning
University community, planned to sponsor Bush at a
meeting in a new conference room at the Lou Henry
Hoover building. Instead, the president was forced to

meet with selected fellows at the home of former Secre
tary of State George Shultz after his motorcade was
rerouted.
Thirty-five Hoover fellows and other Stanford facul
ty — including University President John Hennessy and
Provost John Etchemendy — sat with Bush for about 75
minutes.
"It was a back and forth discussion about events in the
realm of public policy," said Hoover Institution Director
John Raisian, who co-hosted the event with Shultz.
Raisian told The Daily on Monday that the discus
sion was wide-ranging and covered the "whole gamut."
But he specifically mentioned Iraq, nuclear prolifera
tion, Social Security and Medicare as issues broached
during what he called a "very friendly, very spirited" dis
cussion.
Raisian said that the discussion was casual and with

out a formal agenda.
"The president was on top of his game and per
formed well," he said.
After the discussion. Bush had a small,private dinner
with Shultz and others. Raisian declined to say how
many people were there or who was invited. Shultz had
made the invitation lists for both events.
The president boarded Marine One at 7:25 p.m. for
St. 1 lelena. 60 miles north of campus in the Napa Valley.
After a 35-minute helicopter trip. Bush spent the night at
the Meadowood Napa Valley Resort.
For decades. Hoover has been an institution leaders
turn to for advice. Reagan met with Hoover fellows
when he was running for president in 1980. Bush met
