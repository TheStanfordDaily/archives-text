# WOMEN'S WATER POLO
## MPSF Tourney awaits Card No. 2 Water Polo downs San Jose State, 9-3 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
Apparently the members of the
women's water polo team didn't
feel hospitably welcomed in their
season finale at San Jose State —
so they decidcd to do something
about it.
After the Spartans' Beth Har
berts opened the game's scoring
with 4:47 remaining in the first pe
riod, the No. 2 Cardinal (19-4,10-2
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) responded. Actually, they re
sponded nine times in total before
San Jose State was able to end the
Stanford unanswered scoring
streak. By the time the Cardinal's
run came to an end, the outcome of
the game had long since been de
cided, and the Stanford women
closed out their regular season
with a 9-3 victory over the Spar
tans.
Junior two-meter Christina
Hewko tied things up with 1:30 re
maining in the period, and the Car
dinal exploded for three more in
the second. Three more unan
swered goals in the third period ef
fectively put the game out of reach
for the Spartans, who managed

only two goals in the closing min
utes of the final period.
Senior driver Scotti Shafer
paced the Cardinal offensive
with a hat trick to finish the year
with 25 goals — third best on the
team. Six other Stanford players
contributed one goal apiece in
the onslaught, helping their
squad wrap up their season on a
high note.
Particularly encouraging was
the fact that Stanford was able to
generate scoring opportunities
both inside and from the perime
ter, and that members from up
and down the lineup got into the
scoring act. Sophomore Jackie
Gauthier, who scored one goal for
the Cardinal in the game, also
spent time in net relieving starter
Meridith McColl.
"[San Jose State] is a good
team that has caused a lot of other
teams big problems," junior driver
Katie Hansen said. "So it was
great to show that we were decid
edly better than they were."
Hansen was held scoreless in
the game, and was thus unable to
close out the season in sole pos
session of the team scoring lead.
Freshman Lolo Silver tallied her
only goal of the day — and 40th
of the season — with just over a
minute remaining in the second
period to match Hansen's total

for the year.
The Cardinal head south to
morrow to UC-Irvine, the site of
this year's MPSF conference tour
nament. Although the tourna
ment likely won't impact whether
or not the Stanford women re
ceive a bid to the NCAA Champi
onships, this weekend's competi
tion will afford the Cardinal an
opportunity for mental and physi
cal preparation.
"We won't need to play per
fectly to win MPSFs, but we do
need to put together three games
of solid, consistent, smart water
polo," Hansen said."This is a dress
rehearsal to see if we can play our
game under pressure against very
strong, physical teams."
Hansen emphasized that al
though the NCAA seeding impli
cations of the MPSF tournament
would be minimal, an effective
performance this weekend could
give the Cardinal the mental edge
three weekends from now at the
NCAAs.
"It's going to be an exciting
weekend with a lot of great water
polo," Hansen said. "No matter
how well we do this weekend,
we'll still be a No. 2 or a No. 3 seed
going into NCAAs. But winning
MPSFs would be great to boost
our confidence and show every
one what we're capable of doing."
