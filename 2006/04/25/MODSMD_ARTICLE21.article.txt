# Five times the sports stories
## 
### 
Five was the magic number this
past weekend at ballparks and
arenas throughout the country.
Saturday in Milwaukee, the
Brewers tied a Major League record
with five home runs in one inning
against the Cincinnati Reds. The
fourth inning saw Bill Hall, Damian
Miller, Brady Clark, J.J. Hardy and
Prince Fielder collect round-trip
pers as the Brew Crew clobbered
the Reds 11-0. The Brewers now
share the historical distinction with
only three other teams — the
Phillies, the Giants (both in San
Francisco and New York) and the
T\vins.
The next afternoon in the Mile-
High City, five was the number of
players ejected during the Rockies'
3-2 victory over the Giants. San
Francisco's Matt Morris and coach
es Felipe Alou and Dave Righetti
were each thrown out, along with
Colorado manager Clint Hurdle and
Rockies reliever Ray King.
No fights broke out, but the
game's umpires weren't willing to
take any chances with the plethora
of hit batters, especially the day after
tensions flared 'twixt Jose Mesa and
Omar Vizquel.
Before becoming number one
this Sunday in the NFL Draft, Reg
gie Bush — who wore number five
at USC — became the subject of in
vestigation by the Pacific-10 Confer
ence. Bush and his family suddenly
left their extiavagant Southern Cal
ifornia home after the residence was
found to be linked to sports agent
Michael Michaels. NCAA regula
tions prevent student-athletes from
receiving special benefits from
agents.
Five was the number of Lakers
who actually showed up on the court
against the Suns on Sunday, but it
was one number 8 who actually car
ried the squad. Additionally, five was
the number of points by which the
Suns — complete with a healthy
Steve Nash — edged the Lakers,
107-102.
But I really wish for the number
in question to be four — as in the
digit that will soon be retired at
Lambeau field. ITie only question is
when.
In a recent Milwaukee Journal
Sentinel poll, over 82 percent of
readers said the Packers should
trade quarterback Brett Favre, a
man who over the years has grown
synonymous with Wisconsin's third
largest city. Favre, meanwhile, has
remained adamant in saying that he
will play his last season only with the
Packers.
It is amazing how much one
player can dictate the future of a
franchise. Sports fans have been
exposed to the phenomenon re
cently with the Astros eagerly an
ticipating Roger Clemens' impend
ing decision. The Hated Ones' (i.e.
the Giants') season will be com
pletely dependent on the perform
ance (enhancing) of slugger Barry
Bonds. The future of the Cleveland
Cavaliers lies on the shoulders of
the 21-year-old Chosen One Le-
Bron James. And the current Stan
ley Cup playoffs will once again re
mind us of the value of an amazing
goalie.
Athletes like Bonds, Kobe
Bryant and Terrell Owens may draw
criticism for claiming the center of
attention, but Favre remains an
anomaly. Number Four's impact in
Green Bay is unprecedented, from
restaurants to charity events — the
man is worshiped in the town.
Favre will go down as a legend in
the NFL's annals of history, no mat
ter what his final season's record
may be. The only thing that could
tarnish his image is a decision to lead
some other team to the second
round of the playoffs. Considering
all that he has accomplished so far,
Favre has no reason to help some
other franchise just to go out with a
winning record. If anything, he will
only lose the distinction shared by so
few athletes — the ability to be
identified with one team.
As far as Packers fans are con
cerned, Favre already does — and
always will — have a winning record
in Green Bay. Even if five is the
number of wins the Packers collect
in his final season.
