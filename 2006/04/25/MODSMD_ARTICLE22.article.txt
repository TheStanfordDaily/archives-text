# STANFORD ATHLETICS
## SID Raber's impact goes unseen 
### CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON STAFF WRITER 
In her first days working with the
women's basketball program, Assis
tant Director of Media Relations
Jessica Raber was nervous about dis
cussing the women's basketball
media guide with Cardinal coach
Tara VanDerveer. She quickly saw a
softer side of the legendary coach,
who was munching on peanut butter
and crackers and simply said, "You
want one?"
Raber said of the offer,"lt was the
most surreal moment of my life."
It's all in a day's work for the Stan
ford alum, who took a roundabout
route to becoming one of the most
beloved members of the media of
fice.
Sports Information Directors, as
they are known around the country,
are the link between college teams
and the press. All media coverage of
a team goes through an SID — the
person who issues press credentials;
writes the media guide and press re
leases; provides rosters and statistics;
and coordinates media hospitality,
interviews and press conferences.
Since the job revolves around game
time, working nights and weekends is
de rigueur. Raber is one of at least
seven such officers in Stanford's
media relations office — each an im
portant, but unsung, part of the Stan
ford Athletics program.

Following a year off after high
school, Raber enrolled at Foothill
College in 1999 with the intent to
transfer to a four-year school. Look
ing to get involved in sports media,
Raber went to Assistant Athletic Di
rector for Media Relations Gary
Migdol and asked him for any work
he could find for her.
He put her to work in his office,
where she kept basketball statistics,
clipped football articles, and helped
write releases. Her first feature story
was on women's volleyball player
Kerri Walsh, who played on Stan
ford's 2001 national championship
team and later won a gold medal at
the 2004 Summer Olympics in
Athens.
Raber also worked a second job
as an office manager for a Silicon
Valley software company. Her first
transfer target was UC-Berkeley.
"[Cal] told me a 3.0 GPA would
guarantee me transfer admission as a
junior," Raber said.
The famous Stanford network,
however, made sure it didn't turn out
that way — the efforts of Migdol and
her software company employer, as
well as her 3.99 GPA, resulted in her
admission to the Farm.
After graduating in 2003 with a
degree in communications, Raber
followed up her two years on campus
with a stint in sports information at
the U.S. Naval Academy — just an
hour east of her hometown of Wash

ington, D.C. After a year "on the
yard" in Annapolis, she was hired
back to Stanford in 2004 as a full
time SID.
She claims to have worked with
every varsity team in some capacity,
hut her prime assignment the past
two years has been women's basket
ball. She has traveled with the team
through their back-to-back Elite
Eight appearances.
Raber's time at Stanford is wind
ing down — she will enter the Uni
versity of Washington's School of
Public Affairs in September, with a
future career goal of working in the
federal government. Members of the
basketball team already miss her,
and have not shied from begging her
to stay. Migdol did not disagree, call
ing Raber "the best one ever."
Asked what she will miss, Raber
mentioned volleyball star Logan
Tom, basketball legend Casey Jacob
sen, former football coach Tyrone
Willingham and fellow SID Kyle
Mcßae's Prince collection.
She will reunite with old col
leagues quickly, as Stanford teams
travel to Seattle this fall for
matchups in women's volleyball and
football. Raber expects to see plenty
of Stanford in her future — "my
mother lives out here and I'm an
alum'' — but didn't rule out rooting
for conference rival UW.
"I'm a Husky now," she said with
a nervous smile.
