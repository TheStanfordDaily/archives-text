## Walsh, Harris give glimpse of the future Stadium tour and scrimmage also part of coaches' clinic 
### CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON STAFF WRITER 
This weekend, visitors to Stanford football's
two-day coaches' clinic and football alumni re
union received an update and a tour of the stadi
um, and speeches from Athletic Director Ted Le
land and Coach Walt Harris about the upcoming
season.
The clinic began on Friday afternoon with a
tour of the under-construction stadium. Associate
Athletic Director for Capital Development Dave
Schinski pointed out many intriguing aspects of
the new facility, pointing out that it was "built for
collegiate football." He pronounced the 50,000-
seat project "on schedule" and estimated the
structure would be competed by August, while
wiring, carpeting and other interior work would
be done before the official opening game on Sep
16 versus Navy.
The video scoreboard and light poles will be
moved in closer to the lip of the stadium, and a
second Jumbotron scoreboard, identical to the
one in the old stadium, will be installed.
Concessions and restrooms will be distributed
all around the concourse beyond the seating area,
maximizing accessibility for all fans. Each level of
the stadium will hold about 25,000 seats apiece.
Schinski delved into engineering issues,includ
ing today's building codes (modern code requires
more structure for a given number of seats),
earthquake safety (the new soil base and modern
materials ensures seismic integrity) and the turf
(the natural grass surface will be four feet lower
than the old surface).
In a warm but reserved Friday night address,
interim athletic director Bill Walsh reminisced
about his coaching days in high school, at Stanford
and in the NFL. Walsh emphasized teaching and
repetition as a path to winning football. He con
stantly repeated the phrase "you've got to have a
plan" and illustrated with his experiences where
planning paid off, such as when he coached the
San Francisco 49ers to a game-winning drive in
Super Bowl XIII over Cincinnati.
Walsh highlighted the importance of evaluat
ing players with on-field achievement, rather
than scouting numbers like speed and weight.
He noted that Jerry Rice, widely regarded as the
best receiver to ever play pro football,"ran a [rel
atively slow] 4.6 40-yard dash... but he was never
caught from behind on the field." In the case of
quarterback Joe Montana, Walsh similarly said
that his ability to throw catchable balls and to ex
ecute Walsh's sophisticated West Coast offense
more than compensated his average arm
strength.
Coach Walt Harris then gave a more technical
and cerebral talk regarding the Stanford offense.
He re-emphasized his belief in mistake-free,
turnover-free football, particularly in games
where the Cardinal may be physically over
matched.
Harris' emphases this season is to be more
physical (Stanford rushed for just 1015 yards last
season) and to "finish" â€” the Cardinal lost three
games in the last minute or overtime.
Harris gave insight into the team's philosophy
with the aphorism "prevent losing, then go win the
game."
Saturday's events concluded with a two-hour
full-contact scrimmage, with coaches rotating
quarterbacks and personnel groups. Some high
lights included tailback Jason Evans taking a well
blocked stretch play to the end zone while bounc
ing off several would-be tacklers,cornerback Nick
Sanchez intercepting a pass and returning it for a
touchdown, fullback Nick Frank faking out line
backer Michael Okwo and cutting upfield for
extra yardage and rising senior quarterback TYent
Edwards hitting receiver Evan Moore on a go
route for a 30-yard touchdown strike.
