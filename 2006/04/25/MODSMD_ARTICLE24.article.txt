## Menlo Park faces looming budget deficit City looks to community input for strategies to deal with problem 
### CHRISTOPHER LIN STAFF WRITER 
Budget deficits aren't only for presidents any
more.^The city of Menlo Park has an estimated $2.5
million deficit in its $29 million general fund budg
et for fiscal year 2006-2007. The City Council has
embarked on a long decision-making process that
aims to engage community input to choose strate
gies that will close the gap between revenue and
expenses.
In a series of community outreach workshops
and surveys, citizens have been asked to report on
which city services they most prefer, and which
methods they would suggest for balancing the
budget.
Menlo Park City Finance Manager Carol Au
gustine explained, "The community weighs in on
what services they prefer, whether they think
budgets should be balanced by raising fees, imple
menting taxes or cutting services or drawing from
reserves."
In a meeting on Wednesday, April 19, the Coun
cil studied community reports and consolidated in
formation and opinions gathered from citizens in
order to decide which budget strategies should be
incorporated into the proposed budget for this
next fiscal year.
Augustine reported, "There were a lot of fee
strategies — a lot of fees increased, bringing some
of community service fees closer to cost recovery.
Increased heritage tree fees on the order of
$24,000 had a lot of community support. The pro
posals to increase fees or taxes, or to cut back on
certain services were straight from the community
workshops."
The strategies chosen by the city will depend on
a combination of community preferences and ex
pert fiscal consultations. Some of the fee increases
proposed at Wednesday's meeting will wait until
further community reports provide the council
with more information. Meanwhile, the council au
thorized the city to hire a consultant to poll citizens
about a new tax measure. If poll data confirm that
a tax measure would be supported in November,
then the city may decrease the number of cuts
made to city services. Final decisions regarding
budget strategies for 2006-2007 will be made once
the council obtains this information.The municipal
fee schedule is tentatively set for a May 9 public
hearing.
Menlo Park's large deficit is a result of high ac
cumulated annual operating deficits stemming
from a lackluster economy.
"A lot of cities arc facing similar deficits. I think
Menlo Park is just trying to be proactive in ad
dressing the problem "Augustine explained. "A lot
of the sales tax loss experienced in 2001 with the
entire Silicon Valley technology bust is not going to
be soon in returning. We've also lost a lot of car
dealerships that won't be returning real quickly."
Over the past four years, Menlo Park has at
tempted to reduce its deficit by cutting over $4 mil
lion, and has drawn on its reserves twice, leaving
only $21 million in undesignated reserve funds.
Augustine expressed hopes that this year's
budget deficit can be bridged without drawing
upon reserves.
"If we continue to take revenue from reserves
until the economy improves, it might work, but
when we go into the next recession, the reserves
won't be there. It's not prudent to draw if you don't
see growth in the near future," she said.
Stanford's proposal for the construction of a
hotel-office complex on Sand Hill Road could — if
approved by the council in a few weeks — help the
city recover through a transient occupancy tax that
would increase revenue. The tax, set at 10 percent
for hotels in Menlo Park and most surrounding
cities, is expected to pull in revenues of $800,000 to
$1.2 million once the Sand Hill complex becomes
operational in 2008. The new complex may de
crease revenues collccted from other local hotels,
but the city anticipates an overall increase in rev
enue since the Sand Hill development will be a lux
ury hotel. With circumstances remaining un
changed, however, Menlo Park's revenue may not
cover the city's expenses until fiscal year 2014-
2015.
Augustine emphasized the importance of
shoring up deficits in the short run rather than de
pending on long-term prospects like the Sand Hill
complex.
"There's a lot of long-term revenue prospects
like the hotel, but there's also lots of fiscal ex
pense impacts," she said. "A new hotel would be
very welcome, but nothing's ever easy. We would
need to look long-term for expenses as well as
revenues,and try to keep numbers from bouncing
around — whether we include this or that, the
probability of this or that. We just want to find a
sustainable budget in the more immediate future.
Putting together a 2006-2007 budget first is what
we need direction on."
