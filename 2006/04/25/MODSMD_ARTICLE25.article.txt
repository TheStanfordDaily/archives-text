# CONSTRUCTION
## End in sight for campus renovation 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
The Board of Trustees has recently re
leased information on the Old Union reno
vation and the proposed Environment and
Energy Building. Both high-profile con
struction projects have been in motion for
some time — but now, according to project
managers, there is an end in sight.
Robert Reidy, vice-provost for Land and
Buildings, said that the renovation project
at Old Union is going smoothly.
"This project has been planned for a
number of years and is founded on the idea
that the Union should return to students
for their direct use," Reidy said. "To that
end, what is planned is essentially two
main uses: student community centers and
an interfaith center to foster communica
tion and dialogue among students. Cur
rently, we are in for plan-check review at
the county and have begun some selective
demolition and corresponding investiga
tive work."
The Old Union overhaul is expected to
reach completion during the first quarter of
2007 for an estimated construction cost of
$12 million.
Across campus, the new 166,302-square
foot Environment and Energy facility is
preparing to break ground, according to
Project Manager Maggie Burgett. The
building is part of a larger plan for the new
Science and Engineering Ouad, already
termed SEQ2.
"A master plan for the quad was devel
oped in 2004 and approved by the Board of

Trustees," Burgett said. "Schematic design
drawings for E&E were completed in
March and construction drawings for foun
dation and structure will be completed in
May and submitted for permit. Excavation
and shoring of the basement will begin in
June. Construction completion is targeted
for October of 2007."
According to Burgett, the project design
is right on schedule and is slated to finish up
in October of 2(X)7 with move-in complete
by the end of the year.
The new building, which will house Stan
ford's interdisciplinary Environmental Ini
tiative and the Woods Institute for the En
vironment, is intended to establish Stanford
as a world leader in environmental research

and education.
"The goal of the initiative is to promote
an environmentally sound and sustainable
world," Burgett said. "Stanford's environ
mental research is currently located in
multiple campus buildings. This condition
impedes its ability to establish an optimal
interdisciplinary environment. The vision
for the environmental initiative can be re
alized by locating, within one building, re
searchers from civil and environmental en
gineering, earth sciences, conservation bi
ology and ecology, economics and natural
resource management and environmental
policy and law."
The building will be located on what is
now the Ginzton parking lot and will be or

ganized around five focal research areas:
fresh water; marine and oceans; energy and
climate; land use and conservation and sus
tainable built systems.
"A social entry will welcome visitors to
the building and will be designed to con
vey the high-performance values of the
building and the programs housed there,"
Burgett said. "The new building is three
stories above grade with a basement. The
connective elements that will be con
structed as part of the building project
represent approximately one quarter of
the future SEQ2 Quad and will include
improvements to Via Ortega adjacent to
the building as well as to the South Ser
vice Road."
