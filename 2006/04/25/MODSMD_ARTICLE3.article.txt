## Housing overhaul gains steam 
### SHIRIN SHARIF SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It's been more than a year since Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education John
Bravman first proposed his comprehensive
housing overhaul, which included a near-elim
ination of four-class housing, moving Ujamaa
to Florence Moore Hall and converting Bran
ner into a three-class dorm. The wheels are
turning to put a plan in motion — with a price
tag of $70 to $80 million — for a new dorm to
be constructed with an anticipated comple
tion date of fall 2009.
The goal of Bravman's housing proposals
— termed the Housing Master Plan — is to
significantly increase the quality of upperclass
housing on campus. This will occur through
the "unstuffing" of current dorms on campus,
with Lagunita mini-doubles being converted
into singles, and Mirrielees and Branner
triples being changed to doubles — in addi
tion to renovating Crothers and Crothers
Memorial as undergraduate dorms.
Some new developments in the ongoing
discussions of the housing project include pre
liminary plans for the construction of a new
dorm, named Toyon 2 or Manzanita 3, which
would house approximately 125 upperclass
students in the Toyon parking lot area or the
area between Manzanita and Schwab, respec
tively. This dorm may follow the movement to
ward suites-style accommodations, which is
gaining popularity across the country — pro
viding singles for four to six students and a
common room to share.
The unstuffing of Lag. Mirrielees and
Branner is expected to create a shortage of
around 600 beds. Opening up Crothers and
Crothers Memorial dorms — after an exten
sive renovation and the addition of a new din
ing hall — should create 350 spaces. The
Green Dorm Row house project will also alle
viate the housing crunch, as the project will
house 40 to 50 students studying the impact of
the environment on daily life. With Crothers,
the new dorm and the Green Dorm, the Uni
versity will be close to meeting its unstuffing
goal, Bravman said.
In an interview with The Daily, he admitted
that there has been some difficulty raising
money for housing projects.There are a small
number of donors willing to give money to
student residences in comparison to more tra
ditionally academic causes.
"We're not feeding any new students —
there are no new bodies and no new sources of
income that can fund these proposals," Brav
man said. "That's why fundraising is of such
concern."
So far, a significant pledge from an
anonymous donor has been secured,
though it is currently smaller than the re
cent $40 million Munger donation for the
new law student residences. University
gifts will also be applied to this effort, to
the tune of "many millions of dollars," but
the majority of the hefty $70 to $80-million
price tag must still come from donors, ac
cording to Bravman.
"I don't know if [the University] could
do half [the funding] without going into
emergency mode," Bravman said.
Nevertheless. Bravman believes that
raising the large sum of money is "doable."
"I'm confident; I'm hoping not foolish
ly so," he said.
Another major part of the Housing

Master Plan is freshman clustering —
providing all-frosh housing to the esti
mated 75 percent of incoming students
who request it, as opposed to the 55 per
cent who actually get all-frosh housing
now. Part of Bravman's original proposal
was the virtual elimination of four-class
housing, with the exception of ethnic
theme dorms.
However, this part of the proposal has
been revised, and Roble will likely remain
as a four-class option for incoming stu
dents. The quads will no longer be convert
ed to doubles, as specified in the original
plan.
"I understand the appeal of four-class
dorms for a smaller number of incoming
students," Bravman said.
The current proposal would turn dorms
in Wilbur, Stern and FloMo — except for
theme dorms — into all-freshman hous
ing. Freshmen would also live in Roble and
Freshman/Sophomore College. The re
cently renovated Branner would be con
verted into upperclass doubles, as part of

the effort to escalate the quality of housing
for upperclassmen.
"I know this speaks to some cherished
traditions, but the average square feet per
room per student will go up dramatically,"
Bravman said.
One of the most controversial points in
Bravman's plan when it was introduced
last year was Ujamaa's move to Flo Mo.
But students have been generally satisfied
with the way the University has addressed
their worries.
"Ujamaa students voiced concerns that
FloMo would not provide a unifying space
similar to their current space in Lagunita,
where students' rooms, educational and
social program space configurations facili
tate community and provide a continuity
of the Ujamaa residential experience,"
said Shirley Everett, associate vice provost
for Residential & Dining Enterprises, who
created an "Ujamaa Work Group" to re
spond to student concerns.
Students objected to the proposal to
place Ujamaa in Mirlo and Loro because

the dorms were unconnected and did not
provide as many single rooms as the cur
rent building. In response, the most recent
plan is to move Ujamaa to Mirlo and Palo
ma, which are more connected, and to con
vert a large number of the doubles into sin
gles. Students also want to make changes
to the dining hall and dorm lounges to
make them more connected.
"We want to make it feel like one dorm
instead of two," said junior Macarrin Mor
ton, who has been working with Everett on
the proposals.
"Working with the administration has
been very productive," he added. "They're
on our side and they want our programs to
be successful."
This project has been made possible by
the Munger graduate residences, which
will create 6(X) new beds for mostly law stu
dents this fall.This new residence will open
up the Crothers and Crothers Memorial
dorms for undergraduate use.
"I don't know how popular an upper
class 'dorm' will be," said senior Nick
Wolfe."People generally get tired of dining
hall food, and I think that is part of what
makes Row houses and Suites so desir
able."
The proposal also aims to create more
study, seminar and music practice spaces in
residences all over campus. Another goal is
to simplify or equalize the Draw process
by creating a three-tiered system in which
students would get one year each guaran
teed numbers between 0-1,000. 1,000-
2,000 and 2,000-3,0(X). A revised draw sys
tem could be in place as early as spring of
next year.
Bravman described the housing pro
posals as a result of a push by the Univer
sity president and provost to break out of
incremental housing changes and adopt
something bold.
"The president and provost said, 'We
may not be able to afford it, but we need a
plan,"' Bravman explained.
While he described the proposals as in
terconnected — and not being able to do
one part without another — students'
opinions remain torn about the many
changes that are on the table.
"I think that Branner should stay the
way it is; all-frosh," said sophomore Alif
Khalfan, who lived in Branner last year.
"As much as those who will be upperclass
men by the time it is completed will be
thrilled, there is nothing at Stanford that
can compare to the freshman Branner ex
perience. However. I do think that Stan
ford needs better upperclass housing. I
chose to be on staff in an underclass dorm
because I think that it is better than upper
class housing as it stands."

Construction on the Munger dorm began last year. The law student dorm is part of a series of housing changes proposed last year that
would include moving Ujamaa to Florence Moore Hall and turning Branner into a three-class residence.
