## Housing overhaul gains steam 
### SHIRIN SHARIF SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It's been more than a year since Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education John
Bravman first proposed his comprehensive
housing overhaul, which included a near-elim
ination of four-class housing, moving Ujamaa
to Florence Moore Hall and converting Bran
ner into a three-class dorm. The wheels are
turning to put a plan in motion — with a price
tag of $70 to $80 million — for a new dorm to
be constructed with an anticipated comple
tion date of fall 2009.
The goal of Bravman's housing proposals
— termed the Housing Master Plan — is to
significantly increase the quality of upperclass
housing on campus. This will occur through
the "unstuffing" of current dorms on campus,
with Lagunita mini-doubles being converted
into singles, and Mirrielees and Branner
triples being changed to doubles — in addi
tion to renovating Crothers and Crothers
Memorial as undergraduate dorms.
Some new developments in the ongoing
discussions of the housing project include pre
liminary plans for the construction of a new
dorm, named Toyon 2 or Manzanita 3, which
would house approximately 125 upperclass
students in the Toyon parking lot area or the
area between Manzanita and Schwab, respec
tively. This dorm may follow the movement to
ward suites-style accommodations, which is
gaining popularity across the country — pro
viding singles for four to six students and a
common room to share.
The unstuffing of Lag. Mirrielees and
Branner is expected to create a shortage of
around 600 beds. Opening up Crothers and
Crothers Memorial dorms — after an exten
sive renovation and the addition of a new din
ing hall — should create 350 spaces. The
Green Dorm Row house project will also alle
viate the housing crunch, as the project will
house 40 to 50 students studying the impact of
the environment on daily life. With Crothers,
the new dorm and the Green Dorm, the Uni
versity will be close to meeting its unstuffing
goal, Bravman said.
In an interview with The Daily, he admitted
that there has been some difficulty raising
money for housing projects.There are a small
number of donors willing to give money to
student residences in comparison to more tra
ditionally academic causes.
"We're not feeding any new students —
there are no new bodies and no new sources of
income that can fund these proposals," Brav
man said. "That's why fundraising is of such
