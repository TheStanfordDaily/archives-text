# VOTING FOR CHANGE
## Barghouti's speech focuses on elections, Israeli occupation and peace efforts 
### JENNIFER LIU DESK EDITOR 
Palestinian democratic activist Mustafa Barghouti spoke
last night on the nascent Palestinian democratic process and
the current and future prospects for what he termed "a so
ciety closer to democracy than any other Arab country." In
his speech, titled "Democracy in Occupied Palestine,"
Barghouti argued that recent Palestinian elections consti
tuted a tremendous demographic transformation, and that
the peace process was hampered by the Israeli occupation.
The event was sponsored by the ASSU Speakers Bureau,
the Muslim Student Awareness Network (MSAN), the
Coalition for Justice in the Middle East (CJMK) and the Or
ganization of Arab Students in Stanford (OASIS).
A medical doctor by training, Barghouti finished sec
ond in the Palestinian presidential elections last year with
20 percent of the vote, and was recently elected to the
Palestinian parliament as the head of the Independent
Palestine list — a coalition of independents and non-gov
ernmental organization (NGO) members.
The first half of Barghouti's speech focused on the recent
Palestinian elections, which he claimed constituted an im
pressive demographic transformation, though he said that
the achievement had been underreported due to the spot
light on the Hamas majority in parliament. He attributed
the election process itself to several factors: misgovernment
by the Palestinian Authority, the rapid evolution of commu
nication mechanisms and — to a certain extent — the reac
tion of the Palestinian population to the Israeli occupation.
Barghouti also addressed the issue of Hamas' victory,
which has led to the withdrawal of several international
sources of aid, including the United States.

He explained that I lamas did well for two reasons: the
failure of the peace process, and the grassroots efforts of
the group. In addition, Barghouti claimed many Palestini
ans voted for Hamas to protest against previous candi
dates who they viewed as corrupt or ineffective. Regard
less of who was elected, he said, the democratic process it
self was the most important point.
I iowever, Barghouti warned that current Israeli actions could
destroy prospects for a two-state solution in the conflict-ridden
region. In the second half of his presentation, Barghouti present
ed what he characterized as exiunples of Israeli unilateral action.
"Ehud Olmcrt. the successor to Ariel Sharon, insists
that negotiations can't continue because there is no part
ner on the Palestinian side," Barghouti said.
He presented maps that showed what he said was the
diminution of Palestinian land and images of the planned Is
raeli barrier, which — according to his presentation —
showed an attempt to retain major Israeli settlements in the
West Bank and Gaza, as well as water sources. I le acknowl
edged a tlier distributed by "a group of Stanford students
hoping for peace" before the talk that disputed the numbers
and characterizations, but stood by his presentation.
"If you want tocall it a fence,call it a fence,"he said."lf
you can call this a fence, fine. It's more than eight meters
high and 750 kilometers in length. It is such a terrible struc
ture that I don't know how anyone can justify it."
Barghouti showed photographs of lines of Palestinians
blocked by a wall and linked the struggles of daily life of
Palestinians to the stalled peace talks.
However, Barghouti stressed the need for optimism
throughout his presentation.
"I still believe there is hope," he said."lt is not impossi
ble to achieve peace. It is possible. It is ending the occupa
tion, allowing negotiations to continue, the prevalence of
two-state solutions and a willingness to live and coexist.
We will not go away. Especially since we have democracy
now, you know."
