# OVERSEAS STUDIES
## An interview with Norman Naimark BOSP Director Naimark forecasts new centers, lasting experiences 
### CHRISTIAN TOM STAFF WRITER 
In a conversation with The Stanford Daily, Eastern Eu
ropean Studies Prof. Norman Naimark discussed the past,
present and future of the Bing Overseas Studies Program
(BOSP). He spoke on the new centers the BOSP hopes to
open and which programs and quarters are most popular,
and gave advice on how to get into the program of one's
choice. Naimark concluded by talking about students'
roles in promoting their experiences overseas, recent
changes in the BOSP and what makes Stanford's overseas
programs special.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Can you give us an overview
on the BOSP — where has it been in the past and where
is it going in the future?
Norman Naimark (NN):The BOSP has a long and distin
guished history at Stanford. It is now almost 50 years old
and it counts many thousands of dedicated alumni. The
program has changed over these 50
years, hut basically it has been an in
tegral and important part of Stan
ford undergraduate education for
the entire time. In 2(M)8, we will cele
brate our 50th anniversary.
It started out as a program where
Stanford students were sent some
times to quite isolated locations or
facilities in countries such as Ger
many, France and Italy, and since
then it has expanded and changed.
We have created centers now in
many of the major urban cultural

places like Bhutan, Tanzania, Brazil
and elsewhere.
TSD: If you were to give advice to
students on their best technique to
get into the program of their choice,
what would you tell them in terms of
the season to travel, what to write on
their applications or the courses and
experiences they've had?
NN: Basically, I think that students
should be aware of the application
cycles. Generally we have much
heavier applications for Fall Quar
ter. Students want to go in Fall Quar-

and political centers in the world,
and we have nine centers now up
and running. We are hoping to or
ganize one in Madrid, Spain, and we
are also thinking about longer-term
programs in South Africa. We have a
lot of things on the backburner.
Basically, we want to try to pro
vide Stanford students with really
exciting intellectual opportunities to
study abroad. We are anxious to
have more and more students go
abroad. We think, and I think most
people at Stanford believe, that it is
important for our students to be
come citizens of the world in the
course of their education and to
think about the issues and problems
that face humanity
TSD: In terms of student interest,
have you noticed a trend of students
going abroad? Which centers and
which quarters are most popular and
why?
NN: Over the past several years,
there has been a noticeable increase
of interest in studying abroad. The
most popular center right now is Ox
ford. Students really seem to be get
ting a tremendous amount out of
Oxford — they enjoy the tutorials.
They come back and spread the
word to other students. So we see
very heavy applications for Oxford
in particular.
It's not easily explainable why ap
plication rates go up and down for
certain centers. For example, during
the last round of applications, Santi
ago was a very popular destination.
We had many more applications
than we had expected. Part of it is
that the Santiago program is a very
fine program and students come
back and they talk about their expe
riences. They're interested in South
America — many of them have
Spanish language experience. So we
find that the Santiago program is
now also very popular.
Paris and Berlin have had in
creasing applications. We have an
SCTI [Stanford Center for Technol
ogy and Innovation] which is de
signed primarily for engineers in
Kyoto in the spring. That program
also had a jump in applications. So
our regular center programs have
been very popular recently and their
numbers have been going up. That's
one of the reasons why we're trying
to find more spaces for students go
to.
I should mention the seminar
program, which takes place three
weeks before fall quarter. Here, the
applications are absolutely through
the roof. It's a very, very popular pro
gram. In many cases we have 100 ap
plications for 15 spots in the semi
nar. It is very difficult to accommo
date student demand for those sem
inars but we're doing the best we
can. We want to be sure we can run
academically viable and intellectual
ly exciting seminars around the
world. We want faculty to lead the
students and provide them with the
really first-rate experience in inter
national education. And they are
and that's why we're getting so many
applications from students to go to

ter for a variety of reasons: Partly it
has to do with season issues and
their course sequences. So, for exam
ple, if a student were to be willing to
go abroad Winter Quarter or even
Spring Quarter, they would have a
much better chance at a campus like
Oxford, which operates all three
quarters, or Paris or Florence. Un
fortunately, we had waiting lists for
most of our programs next Fall
Quarter because of the rhythm of
students' choice.
The second thing is, we ask in the
application for a serious essay. Most
students take that seriously and do a
good job; some don't. The essay is
about what it is you want to do
abroad, how it fits into your academ
ic program, what kind of things you
want to accomplish, and we read
those essays very carefully. The es
says are at the core of the applica
tion procedure. The essay is read by
the director in the country where
the student is applying and by one
person in our office. For the Oxford
program, for example, we're looking
for people who know what they
want to do, who have investigated a
little in terms of the tutorials, have a
relevant set of goals and have done
reasonably well in their coursework.
In principle we would like to accom
modate all Stanford students. But if
we can't, then we have to make
choices by looking carefully at es
says and transcripts.
TSD: To switch gears a bit: It has
been said that the most effective ad
vertising for the BOSP is students
talking to their friends about it. Do
you think that's accurate?
NN: Yes, the students who return
from abroad tend to be our best ad
vertisers and advocates. These are
really excellent programs. What has
happened over the years is not only
are we able to take students abroad
and provide them with an excellent
academic program, but in part with
the help of Helen and Peter Bing we
have been able to afford them all
kinds of cultural opportunities. They
can go to the opera; they can go out
to dinner; they can take exciting
fields trips. There are all kinds of
special things that Stanford does for
our students abroad that do not
exist with other study-abroad pro
grams. So it's a really exciting expe
rience and the students who come
back want to tell their friends about
it. It is really what happens when
someone comes back and talks to
their dormmates and their friends
about what they experienced or
what they were able to do at one of
our programs that students really
get excited about the possibilities.
TSD: You mentioned the Bings,and
in fact the program was recently re
named the Bing Overseas Studies
Program. What changes have been
made possible by their and other
donors' gifts in the past few years?
NN: There have been several differ
ent things. We have been able to add
quarters in Beijing and Paris. We
have been able to add the Australia
and Beijing programs. We are able
now to open a program in Spain. We

have the financing for that; this is not
an easy thing. I talked to some of my
predecessors — in order to open
programs in the old days they had to
close others. We don't have to do
that. We're in the very fortunate po
sition that if we can identify a pro
gram we think will be strong, and we
can put it together, we are in the po
sition where we can go ahead and
open something without necessarily
closing something else. That's a very
important thing for us. It also gives
us a lot of stability, as we have an en
dowment. An endowment gives sta
bility to any organization. The Bing
gift and other gifts from the CUE
[Campaign for Undergraduate Edu
cation] have made us much more fi
nancially stable and we don't have to
worry year to year whether we have
enough funds to run our programs.
We're feeling confident we can de
liver to students what's important to
their education abroad.
TSD: What are three main things
that make Stanford's Bing Overseas
Studies Program amazing? Why do I
have to study abroad with a Stan
ford program and not some other
school's?
NN: That's a good question. One, I
think is tradition and history. It's im
portant that this program and what
it does is part and parcel of a longer
term way of thinking about under
graduate education. It means that
we are not amateurs; it means we
have had a lot of experience deliver
ing the kind of education opportuni
ties to students that other universi
ties really don't have. Our directors
abroad are generally very experi
enced. Many of them have served
generations of Stanford students.
The sheer weight and traditions of
the programs serve the needs of a
first-rate education. The nearly 50
years of experience of thinking
about how to deliver this kind of ed
ucation should not be underestimat
ed.
The second thing has to do with
the centers themselves and the di
rectors. We really do have a first-rate
group of people who work for us
abroad and any of the students who
have gone abroad will tell you the
directors are an integral part of what
goes on. They are the ones who
make sure the homestays are very
supportive and help the students in
tegrate into the culture around
them. They're the ones who hire the
local faculty. One of the things that
other schools do not do is to send
their own faculty abroad to teach.
Every quarter we send a faculty
member to every one of our centers.
So we have two distinct advan
tages: first, we send our own people,
and second, we are convinced we
hire the best of the local academics.
The students have a first-rate facul
ty abroad to teach them — that's
not necessarily true elsewhere.
Think for a second:The former pres
ident of Stanford, Gerhard Casper,
and his wife Regina Casper, are now
teaching for us in Florence. These
are great scholars and great people
who are teaching in intimate situa
tions with Stanford undergraduates

abroad.
Let me add this: We are also one
of the few schools to teach just our
own students. These are not big pro
grams; they are small programs, tai
lored to the needs of Stanford stu
dents. Other schools might not have
the tailoring we do in the sense that
you are essentially going to Stan
ford, abroad.
The third thing I would say then
goes to these special opportunities
for students: Various Bing programs
where students have incredible op
portunities having to do with local
cultural events, field trips — the
kind you just wouldn't be able to get
anywhere else. In this connection,
we also have very interesting intern
ship programs. The Krupp intern
ship program in Berlin is amazing.
We have a very good SCTI intern
ship program in Kyoto. In Paris and
Florence, we're looking to build our
internship programs. They're al

ready there, but more work needs to
be done. All those things together
make it an incredible opportunity
which students don't want to miss.
TSD: Finally, if you were to find
yourself today as an undergraduate
at Stanford, which program would
you go on?
NN: I think I would spend no time
on campus at all now, knowing what
goes on at these programs, [laughs] I
think they're all terrific, each in its
own way. And that's why I think stu
dents need to do some investigating
of what's available, think about their
own ambitions and what they want
to accomplish abroad. I would en
courage them to go not just for one
quarter but two quarters, at least.
Sometimes you can go two quarters
and change campuses if you want.
Wherever you go, I think it's just a
great experience and a really impor
tant one for undergraduate educa
tion.
