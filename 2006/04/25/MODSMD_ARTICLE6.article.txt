## Energy Bowl issues results The 						Energy Bowl and Water Derby concludes its second year; Murray, Yost and FroSoCo take top honors 
### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford uses 2.7 million gallons of potable water each
day. With this statistic and the slogan " lUrning Off TUrns
Me On" in mind, every undergraduate house and dorm
complex during winter quarter competed to save the most
energy and water in the second annual Energy Bowl and
Water Derby organized by Students for a Sustainable Stan
ford (SSS) and Stanford Housing.
Murray and Yost won the house category and Fresh
man/Sophomore College (FroSoCo) won the dorm catego
ry, based on a comparison of the percentage change in
water and energy usage between winter quarter 2005 and
winter quarter 2006.The residences were not judged on ab
solute amounts consumed since some structures are built
more efficiently than others. Both the winning dorm and


JOSEPH BERGEN/The Stanford Daily
house residents will receive 100 per
cent-organic cotton T-shirts and a
water or energy saving device for
their house, such as a solar panel.
"The purpose of the Energy Bowl
is to remind people that their every
day activities really affect the envi
ronment," said senior and SSS Presi
dent Emma Yuen, who coordinated
the Energy Bowl this year. "While
students are competing, we find real
ly interesting ways to reduce our con
sumption of energy and water and re
alize that it isn't that hard. Hopefully
after the competition, people keep

the conserving habits they started in
the Energy Bowl."
Yuen believes that the Bowl is im
portant to the Stanford community
because it raises awareness concern
ing the amount of natural resources
students consume, while also reducing
Stanford's overall environmental im
pact.
"This year the residences on aver
age cut back around 9 percent of
their energy and water usage," Yuen
said. "These statistics suggest that
residences took the competition very
seriously and were able to really con
serve a lot. I think it also shows that
we as students can do simple things to
help the environment and remind us
that our actions are very impactful.
Plus, it is really fun to do and builds
house and dorm pride."

Yuen noted that Theta Delta Chi
was especially environmentally con
scious and competitive during the
Energy Bowl.
"Theta Delt changed some
switches to turn off their outside
lights for the competition and actual
ly got fined $200 for doing that by
Stanford Housing," Yuen said.
"Columbae residents took commu
nal showers where they would soap
each other up and take turns rinsing.
Columbae also appointed 'elves' that
were designated to go into peoples
rooms and turn off the lights and
music if no one was using it."
FroSoCo Community and Con
servation Organizer Sommer
Panage, a sophomore, attributed her
dorm's win to students following con
servation techniques that were high

lighted in weekly emails, such as low
ering room heat settings, turning off
laptops when not in use and reducing
water pressure in adjustable showers.
"I think if we can keep up the
awareness that we got started this
year in FroSoCo with next year's in
coming freshman, we have a great
chance of winning the Energy Bowl
next year, especially with our new ap
pliances to help us," Panage said. "I
think this is a fantastic competition in
the sense that it increases conserva
tion around campus. However, I hope
Stanford will make sure that soon all
dorms have energy saving appliances
and utilities."
Andrew Dimock, FroSoCo Col
lege Director of Adams House, noted
that Panage's water and energy sav
ing efforts were appealing because

she never pushed them in terms of
winning the contest, but rather in
terms of doing the right thing.
"I'll never forget something a
student said in house meeting ap
proximately six years ago during the
California blackouts and market
manipulations, when Stanford's Co-
Generation plant was selling part of
its surplus capacity to the state grid
to help increase supply," Dimock re
called. "The student told everyone
that since Stanford had its own
source of power and would not be
affected by the rolling blackouts,
everyone should feel free to leave
the lights blazing and consume as
much power as they wished. The in
cident taught me how much more
we could be doing to educate peo
ple about environmental issues and

the consequences of their consumer
choices, so I am thankful that pro
grams like the Energy Bowl exist on
campus."
The Energy Bowl and Water
Derby was the brainchild of sopho
more Seth Silverman, a member of
SSS who pitched the idea to Energy
and Water Coordinator for Stanford
Housing Larry Hoffman. Silverman
was inspired by a similar event at
Oberlin College. The 2(X)5 competi
tion — themed "Do It In the Dark"
— lasted slightly over a month and
was between dorm complexes, with
Florence Moore Hall (FloMo) taking
first place.
