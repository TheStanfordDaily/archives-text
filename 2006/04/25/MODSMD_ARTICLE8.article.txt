## Great Gifts for Grads 
### 
unr hank you, it's great," I
I said to break the awk-
JL ward silence as I un
wrapped the third copy of "Seven
Habits of Highly Effective People"
given to me as a birthday present.
Throw in a few more like "Surely,
you're joking Mr. Feynman,"
"Which color is your Parachute"
and "A brief history of time" and
you've got yourself the canon of
graduate student literature.
Other common grad gifts in
clude: high-quality ink pens (which
you will probably never use); day
planners (even though you might
as well write "Research" in big
block letters for every day) and
watches (to remind us that we have
been in the same place doing the
same thing for the last 6.5 million
seconds).
So, as always, the day after party
was defined by moral dilemma.
Would I rather sell the gifts back
and buy a nice dinner or give into
morality and just say "Thank you"?
The irony is that we grads are
very simple people. We have very
basic needs and desires. Thus, a
great grad gift idea is as simple as
A,B,C.
1. Alcohol: One of the best gifts I
ever received was from my thesis
advisor — a six-pack of beer. It was
the only proof 1 needed to confirm
my two hypotheses: a) He likes me
and b) He was once a graduate stu
dent too. Don't linger in the wine
aisle. Grads rarely eat food nice
enough to merit wine. Instead, hard
alcohol like whiskey, rum, brandy
and tequila will be very well re
ceived — but they may somewhat
dampen the accuracy of any experi
ments said grads are in the middle
of conducting. This invites unwel
come consequences for both the
tippling grad and his lab mates.
Beer, however, walks the fine line
between the sobriety necessary to
actually earn your doctorate, and a
level of intoxication that will keep
you from pondering the purpose
lessness of your work.
2. Books: If you insist on giving
someone books, then at least buy
one that will help your friend navi
gate the grim realities of graduate
life. A "Piled Higher and Deeper"
compilation by Jorge Cham works
great, but chances are that the gif
tee already has several copies and
counting. If you want him to ponder
life's philosophies, however, I
would suggest the Calvin and
Hobbes anthology by Bill Watter
son. With gems like "I find my life is
a lot easier the lower I keep every
one's expectations"; and "Reality
continues to ruin my life," there are
hardly any lessons that it leaves to
be learned. A one-year subscription
to Playboy or Playgirl might also
make an appropriate gift. But by all
means, steer clear of career-related
self-help books. We have more than
enough of them lining our shelves.
3. Cash: This is the ultimate gift
in the purest of forms. It's easy for
the gift-giver; it's easy for the gift
recipient. No, I am not asking for
gift certificates to snappy apparel
stores where I could buy a shirt for
the same amount I could buy an en
tire wardrobe elsewhere. I just want
undiluted, hard, green cash. It's as
simple as that. Why would you want
to go to the trouble of thinking up a
great gift idea, going to the story,
shelling out the dough, wrapping it
and physically handing it to me only
so I will unwrap it, appreciate it and
immediately return it for cash? It's
a whole unnecessary cycle that
wastes both time and ATM fees.
Hie best way to show me how much
your care is to count on me being
mature enough to find the perfect
gift for myself. And please, no in
quiries into whether the money has
been spend on intellectually-stimu
lating experiences or otherwise.
