## Editorial New immigration plan appears pragmatic 
### 
latest attempt to a compromise in
the Senate correctly recognizes that
X. there is no one appropriate govern
ment response to illegal immigration. The
proposed tri-categorical plan recognizes that
immigrants all vary in their reasons for com
ing to the United States, their level of contri
bution to our society and their interest in be
coming an American.
Under this plan, those who have lived in
the country for at least five years — estimat
ed by The New York Times to be roughly
seven million out of 11 million illegal immi
grants — would be on the path toward guar
anteed citizenship if they agree to pay taxes
and learn English.
As for the approximately three million im
migrants who have lived in the United States
for two to five years, they would be required to
leave the country briefly and return to their
countries of origin before reporting back to
American ports of entry to be classified as
temporary workers. After being granted tem
porary worker status, immigrants would be al
lowed to apply for U.S. citizenship with no
guarantees of acceptance.
The remaining illegal immigrants who
have been in the United States for fewer than
two years would be required to leave the
country, with the possibility of applying for
temporary worker status and return, but also
with no guarantees of acceptance into the
guest worker program.
Although the majority of senators agreed
on these basic tenets of the immigration bill,
negotiations broke down when several Re
publican senators proposed a set of tougher
amendments including provisions requiring
the Department of Homeland Security to
certify that the border is secure before creat
ing a guest-worker program, and to deport il
legal immigrants with three misdemeanors,
regardless of the numbers of years they've
been in the United States Senators opposed
to the amendments argued that they were
solely intended to make the legalization

process all hut impossible.
As much as we Americans would love to
pat ourselves on the back for our ingenuity,
the proposed legislation really builds off Ger
many's guest-worker program, which has
helped the country prosper for the past 4()
years. Skeptics of Bush's immigration plan
should look at Germany's success in respond
ing to the many llirkish immigrants who
wanted to live and work in Germany. If Ger
man businesses were unable to find interest
ed workers from the existing pool of legal
German workers, they could submit a specif
ic labor request to a designated unemploy
ment agency, which would then advertise the
job at the unemployment center for a certain
amount of time to ensure that German work
ers were not interested in the positions. The
agency then gives the business written per
mission and work visas to hire from outside
the country. Hired immigrant workers can use
the visa to gain entry to the country, register
themselves at unemployment offices, register
children at school and obtain housing. The
structure of the European plan was so
straightforward and successful that there is
no reason why the United States can't adopt
a similar structure. At this point, it's certainly
worth a shot to address the national stress
caused by illegal immigration.
Some may contend that the president's
immigration plan is reminiscent of the failed
Bracero program in the 1940s to 1960s in that
both were labeled as "guest worker" pro
grams. However, the key difference is that the
recent plan is targeted toward illegal immi
grants who are already living and working in
the United States, without the intention of at
tracting more illegal immigrants. In contrast,
the Bracero program was specifically instigat
ed to entice Mexican farmworkers to aban
don their rural communities in Mexico to
work in the United States. The strength of the
recent reform proposals is that it actually at
tempts to address the illegal immigration
challenges that are already present.
