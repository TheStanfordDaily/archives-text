Don't hold your breath in antici —
I love Stanford. Even though I occasional
ly question the intelligence of some members
of our community, it's clear that there are
many bright people in our midst willing to ad
vance our collective pursuit of knowledge
and exercise their voices and spirits to reflect
their views. Accordingly, I think many of our
community members will do well on the fol
lowing pop quiz:
Which of the following statements are
true?
A) The Bush administration was correct
when it anticipated the presence of terrorist
networks planning to strike against the Unit
ed States and its citizens in September 2001
and used sound intelligence to guide its sub
sequent course of action to catch Osama Bin
Laden.
B) The Bush administration was correct
when it anticipated the presence of weapons
of mass destruction in Iraq and used sound in
telligence to guide its subsequent course of
action.
C) The Bush administration was correct
when it anticipated the presence of thousands
of impoverished and displaced families, sur
vivors and looters following the impact of a
major hurricane visible for days before it
struck... and used sound intelligence to guide
its subsequent course of action.
I» The Bush administration was correct
when it anticipated the presence of hundreds
of protesters surrounding a distinctively icon
ic building with few entrances or exits located
at a high status research university... and used
sound intelligence to guide its subsequent
course of action.
E) None of the above.
Okay, so this quiz is partially indicative of
my current thinking as I study for the LSAT,
but also a mockery of the tragically pre
dictable and embarrassing display of unintel
ligence and poor planning that might have
been avoided last Friday when the president
of the United States was scheduled to meet
with affiliated members of our community at
Hoover Tower.
Seriously, it doesn't take a terrorist with a
pilot's license to recognize that sending Pres
ident Bush into a small, distinctive building
that represents the ideologi
cal side of conservative America is a BAD
IDEA. What were they thinking?
Clearly, this isn't the first time that I've
questioned the Bush administration's ability
to anticipate with intelligence. To be clear, in
telligence itself is a homonym for information
and a sense of utilization of information, but
the two are not necessarily the same thing.
Unfortunately, all too often in the Bush ad

ministration there are times when informa
tion is correct, but utilized incorrectly, and
vice versa.
Naturally, I doubt that being the presi
dent is an easy job. But for someone who
seems to put so much emphasis on anticipa
tion of problems, it seems that solutions are
never quite fitting.They are lost through bad
information, or bad users of information. I'd
like to see a president that does a better job
of anticipating intelligently. Is that too much
to ask? I'd also like to see a president that
does a better job of understanding problems
before enacting solutions. I realize that there
are important time constraints, but if Iraq
has taught us anything, its that's hasty deci
sion making, even when used in anticipation
of the unknown, can have results that last
longer, cost more and are less efficient than
simply getting it right the first time. It bog
gles my mind how our society is so forgiving
of this administration. Anyone else in any
other job would have been fired long ago.
Hopefully when the next president visits
our campus, he or she will do more than meet
with a select group of scholars with limited
ideological perspectives. Perhaps if Bush
sought the input of our students, faculty, staff
and alumni, his visit to our campus would
have taken advantage of our rich and diverse
sources of intelligence and could have helped
him anticipate solutions more effectively.
Stanford has much to offer, but unfortunate
ly, this limited and failed visit is tragically typ
ical of everything this administration repre
sents, from uninformed anticipation to unin
telligent planning.
Finally, kudos to seniors Claire Wagenseil,
Diogo Pereira and Caroline Martin. In my
view, your educational experience of recent
days is to be envied by your peers and your
spirits emboldened. Thank you for illuminat
ing our community in ways that many of us
were unable or unwilling to do. I'm encour
aged to see you using your body wholly and
not just your voice. I wish 1 had the balls to get
arrested.
