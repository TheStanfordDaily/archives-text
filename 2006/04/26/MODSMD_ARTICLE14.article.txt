# High school redux
## 
### 
One-thousand-five-hundred high school
seniors — resplendent in their bright
eyed, nametagged glory — descended
on us last weekend. Besides,"So, where are you
from?" and "Are you set on Stanford?" my
awkward small-talk standbys included "So are
you sad about high school ending or are you
more excited to be moving on?" And as ex
pected, nearly everyone replies with some glib
variation of "Yeah, both I guess."
High school has been at the forefront of
my mind lately. Not just with the recent inva
sion of the admits, but in the worries over
A.P. tests and S.A.T.s that have plagued my
17-year-old brother, in the obsessive plan
ning for prom that has occupied the few sen
ior friends with whom I'm still in contact and
in the reminiscing prompted by the news that
yet another of my high school friends is get
ting married.
1 hail from an entirely stereotypical, huge
public school in suburban Southern Califor
nia, where Abercrombie is the uniform and
where not owning a shiny new car makes you
an exception. One of the biggest scandals of
my senior year was when the fair-haired cap
tain of the varsity cheer squad got pregnant.
And although I may have entered high
school half-expecting, half-hoping to find
best friends who would resemble the "Saved
by the Bell" set, I quickly realized that these

were not going to be the "best years of my
life." But in any case, my school bore a much
more striking resemblance to that of "Mean
Girls," and what I came to love most about
high school was the drama, in all of it's gut
wrenching, end-of-the-world grandeur.
When I bought a new computer, 1 went
through all of my documents to find which
ones I wanted to bother transferring. In the
process of this chore, I discovered a series of
vital documents that 1 had entirely forgotten
about: saved instant message conversations,
chronicling some of the intense drama of my
senior year around the time of the prom. Ap
parently, there was a time when 1 had nothing
better to do than sit for hours on end, gossip
ing with four or five people at a time.
The best of this rediscovered gossip was a
series of conversations from one particular
ly emotional night when I was IM-ing Holly
to talk about Kyle, Kyle to talk about Holly

and Mark to talk about both of them — and
we also were all in a chartroom together.
Fortunately, 1 had the foresight to copy
paste these exchanges to be preserved for all
eternity. Unfortunately, it seems that while
my memories of this period cast me as an in
nocent bystander, in reality 1 egged the ab
surdity on. Oops.
But such webs of catty intrigue are a sem
inal part of high school, and really, of growing
up. Afterall you can never get away from this
kind of drama: older people just learn to be
subtler. Gossip and cliques are everywhere
— in college, at the office, in politics — so the
lessons you learn in high school still apply.
The means and methods may change, but the
characters remain the same.
Before college, I wondered what kind of so
cial dynamics there could be in a place where I
imagined everyone would be an intellectual.
But I soon realized that there are the same
groups here as there were in high sch(x>l — the
jocks, the princesses, the artsy-types, the geeks
— but on average, everyone is just smarter.
Maybe life is just cycles of high school.
Which is fine with me: if you haven't gotten it
by now, 1 think such drama spices up life. And
if you can't beat the gossip, join in
