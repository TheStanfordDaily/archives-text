Kudos to protesters who stood
up to Fire Department
More power to the brave stu
dents who sat down in front of the
fire engine near Hoover Tower on
Friday. I have lived on the Stanford
campus for 42 years and have al
ways been proud of our Fire De
partment. On one occasion their
paramedics saved my life. But I re
sent having the Department that I
help finance with my tax dollars
used to clear the way for a law
breaking president who is under
mining our cherished Constitution.
I will be happy when President
Bush is impeached and our Fire De
partment can be returned to pro
tecting our lives and our property.
