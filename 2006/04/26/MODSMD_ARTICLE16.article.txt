# RESIDENTIAL LIFE
## Roth termites a sign of Row disrepair CIP program off-schedule, fails to respond to residents' concerns 
### ANDREW BURMON STAFF WRITER 
A month ago, sophomore Lakshmi Karra was
working at her desk in Roth, when she noticed two
tiny bugs staring back at her from the top of her
notebook. She was perturbed, but it was not until
she noticed the swarm of insects flying out of the
air vent under her desk that she realized the prob
lem might not be minor.
"The whole carpet was crawling with little
bugs," she said, "I stood on my chair and yelled for
my roommate."
No fan of bugs herself, her roommate failed to
help stem the winged flood. The tide turned when
the girls called for an exterminator who identified
the bugs as Damp Wood Termites — Rhinotermi
tidae Reticulitermes — and concluded that they
had better shut the vent.They did just that and then
set about — along with the other residents of Roth
whose rooms had been invaded — killing the in
vading horde.
Jeanette Woodburn, the house manager of
Roth recalled hearing the banging sound of resi
dents rising to their home's defense all the way in
the living room. The infestation had claimed two
floors.
The problem was a product of the rain, which
often incites Damp Wood Termites to swarm. Imo
gen Hinds, the associate director of student hous
ing for operations, is certain that there is no cause
to worry.
"We believe strongly that due to our compre
hensive pest control program, and our inspections,
we have had no cause for concern regarding in
creased pest activity here," Hinds said.
Still, Roth residents aren't exactly ready to take
their chances. Karra, for one, is keeping her vent
taped shut.
"We're cold," she said "but we're scared of
bugs."
Unfortunately the swarm was not an isolated
incident, as Roth residents complain of large flies
and bees.
"I think overall the Row may be having vermin
problems due to all the rain," Woodburn speculat
ed. "Animals are trying to find someplace dry."

Fred, the blue jay, is the newest and only male
member of the Roth residence. The bird began liv
ing in the kitchen of the self-op after the heavy rains
last month. The weather also caused insect infesta
tion in the building.
She may have a point. Many of the upper Row
residences that have not been renovated by the cap
ital improvement program — which paid for the
facelifts of 717 Dolores and Columbae — complain
of similar problems. Residents of Haus Mitteleu
ropa and Durand have both had bug problems.
The Capital Improvement Program (CIP),
which was extended from a 10-year program into
an 18-year program due to financial woes, was sup
posed to provide for the renovation of Roth two
years ago. As of now, the leaks inside Roth result in
puddles on bathroom floors whenever it rains.
Housing Services representatives say they are
doing what they can to keep the residences livable.
"There is no safety issue present at this time,
and it is under the direction of the termite inspec
tor when the work can be done to rectify the prob
lem," said Hinds, pointing out that a full fumigation
is scheduled for this summer.
Though Housing Services keeps every Row
house up to code, the ClP's delay seems to be ad
versely affecting the living situations of many stu
dents who live in those houses where renovation
has been delayed, residents say. The Damp Wood
Termites would have probably avoided Roth if the
roof hadn't been leaking — allowing rain to soak
through the boards. Hinds said that the roof may
be patched, pending investigation into its structur
al weakness.
The only upside to the bug battles at Roth is
that the dorm has finally become coed. While all
the rooms are still inhabited by female students, a
blue jay named Fred has been loitering in the
kitchen. Certainly there is a silver lining to every
swarm.
