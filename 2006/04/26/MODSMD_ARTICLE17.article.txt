## STRIKEOUT 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
1964: the Beatles were huge. President Lyndon
Johnson had just begun to fight for Civil Rights legis
lation and man was still five years away from stepping
on the moon. For Stanford baseball, most of the cur
rent players' parents had barely begun walking, and
30-year manager Mark Marquess, 59, was still three
years from arriving at Stanford — as a first baseman.
But set the time machine back 42 years, bring out
the record player and put on a "Hard Day's Night." For
after last night's 6-1,10-inning heartbreaking loss ver
sus Santa Clara, baseball now stands at just 17-18 over
all and 3-9 in the Pac-10. And, indeed, their winning
percentages of just .486 overall and .250 in conference
are the worst marks since Stanford finished the 1964
season just 20-24 (.455) overall and 4-16 (.200) in the
league.
Last night, sophomore righthanded pitcher David
Stringer (2-3) saw Santa Clara's Brady Fuerst power a
two-run double with one out in the top of the 10th.
With freshman lefty Sean Ratliff and sophomore
righty Erik Davis on the mound later in the inning, the
Broncos' Matt Long and Dustin Realini each knocked
in RBI singles to secure the win.
On a night in which Stanford managed just four hits
— in 34 at-bats — the Card could do nothing to chip
into Santa Clara's five-run lead in the bottom of the
tenth. When third baseman Randy Molina grounded
out for the final out, Stanford left Sunken Diamond as
losers of its last three straight, and its last three to
Santa Clara.
Junior righty Matt Leva notched six scoreless in
nings in a no-decision start. The Card now host Ari
zona State (28-14,7-5 Pac-10) this weekend, April 28-
30, at 6 p.m., 1 p.m. and 1 p.m., respectively.

ALVIN CHOW/The Stanford Daily
Junior pitcher Matt Leva hurled six scoreless innings and allowed only one hit. But Stanford man
aged only four hits on a night when its winning percentage dipped to its lowest since 1964.
