# CAMPUS EVENT
## World Cup draws diverse crowds 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
It was a long and thrilling day of soc
cer, replete with all the spirited rivalries,
sparkling defense and brilliant scoring
finishes that would be expected of an in
ternational competition. And when the
dust settled, it was Team Argentina that
held high the championship trophy
given to the undefeated victors of the
World Cup tournament.
The Stanford African Students Asso
ciation World Cup, that is.
Put on annually by SASA as part of
its yearly Africa Week celebration, the
day-long tournament pitted 12 teams of
varying age, skill and nationality against
each other in a battle for campus brag
ging rights. The names of the teams var
ied from Team Samoa to The Red Dev
ils to Team Deportivo Zapata.
In the end, though, it came down to
Team Argentina versus Team 30+ — a
squad supposedly composed only of
players over the age of 30 — in the tour
nament's title match.
Despite the age difference between
the two teams, the showdown was close
ly contested until the final whistle. Team
Argentina managed to eke out the nar
row 1-0 victory on the strength of a
game-winning goal from the foot of
business grad student Yemi Lawani.
While only one team left the field vic

torious, it was an enjoyable afternoon
for everyone in attendance — players
and soccer aficionados alike.
"The tournament went fabulously
well," said senior Eden Adogla, one of
the tournament's three organizers. "We
feel the tournament and the barbecue
on the side bring students together to
celebrate the uniting power of football."
For the first time in its six year histo
ry, the competition needed to be moved
from Roble Field to the IM South Field
along El Camino Real due to dramati
cally increased participation in and sup
port of the event.
"The Cup has definitely gained pop
ularity over the years," said sophomore
Eugene Adogla, who helped organize
the tournament for the first time. "Last
year we hosted six teams and about 100
guests. This year it was 12 teams and
more than 250 guests. As members of an
international community, I feel that the
World Cup brings students together to

experience this solidarity."
A further testament to the populari
ty of the World Cup was the incredible
diversity of the people who laced up
their cleats or cheered from the side
lines.
"Every nook and cranny of the Stan
ford spectrum was represented," said
junior Tapiwa Mabaye, the third organ
izer of the event. "You name it — under
grads, grads, post-grads, alumni, families
and friends of students, techies and
fuzzies, coed teams and students from all
over the world. In that regard, [the Cup]
serves as a way for community members
to mingle and have fun in the sun each
spring as we celebrate diversity and
Africa Week at Stanford."
The tournament was actually held a
week later than scheduled due to a
weather postponement. But despite the
scheduling change, 12 of the 14 original
ly registered teams were still able to
compete.
