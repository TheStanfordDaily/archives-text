## WSU, Cal challenge lightweights 
### JOHN CHOCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Cardinal oarswomen rowed to
mixed results Saturday, tallying three
wins and three losses in weekend rac
ing.
No. 7 Stanford's lightweight women
hosted open-weights from Santa Clara
and St. Mary's, as well as the California
lightweights on a windswept course at
Redwood Shores. Rowing into a strong
tide and a headwind, the heavier crews
from Santa Clara and St. Mary's set the
pace in the varsity eight while the
matchstick Card fought the chop long
enough to finish just sixty seconds off
their best 2,(XX)-meter time.
"Competing against open-weight
boats challenged us, which is always
valuable," junior captain Meredith
Coleman said. "But it wasn't the best of
races."
Undeterred and indefatigable, the
varsity eight rowers jumped into new
seats in the novice and varsity-four
boats to face the lightweight Bears. The
current persisted, but the tide had
changed for the Cardinal.
The varsity four went neck-and
neck with Cal for 400 meters before
Stanford shifted into a higher gear and
opened up a fifteen-second lead over
the Bears.
"It was everyone's second race of
the day," Coleman said. "But there was
still a consistent effort, and we kept
moving on Cal throughout the race. I
was happy with it."
The novice eight would turn in the
most exciting row of the day, fighting
back from an early deficit.
"Cal jumped out to a big lead early
on — at one point they appeared to be
up by open water," lightweight coach
A 1 Acosta said. "Again, after the crews
settled down to their base pace, we
began to move on them."
With 500 meters to go, the Stanford
novices poured on the speed and
moved out on Cal, repeating the varsity
four's feat as they finished open water
and fifteen seconds ahead of the Bears.
Also on Saturday, the No. 16 Stan
ford open-weights faced No. 7 Wash
ington State at Wawawai Landing in
Pullman, Wash.
The two Pac-10 powers brought im
pressive streaks to the starting line.
Washington State's varsity eight had
yet to drop a race in 2006, and the Car
dinal had just posted an undefeated run
in the Stanford Invitational.
Stanford started the day with a win,
claiming victory in the varsity four over
two WSU crews.
"The four had an excellent race,"
senior co-captain Sam Magee said.
"WSU was the closest competition
they've had all year."
In the varsity eight, Stanford and
WSU crossed the half in a dead heat.
The wind had stopped, and the Card
fell short in the final 1,000 meters as the
Cougars opened up a three-second
lead. It was WSU's first win over
Stanford's varsity eight in four
years.
The Cougars also won the sec
ond-varsity race, by a six-second
margin.
"We were definitely disappoint
ed not to have won," Magee said.
"But we still have a few weeks be
fore Pac-lOs to gain some more
speed."
The last race before the Pac-10
regatta is the Big Row at Redwood
Shores this Saturday. The open
weights will race the No. 2 Bears'
undefeated first- and second-varsi
ty boats, and the lightweights from
Stanford will compete against the
third-varsity Cal open-weights.
"Cal is a very tough crew,"
Magee said. "They are last year's
NCAA champions and are unde
feated so far this season. This is our
last race before Pac-10s,so it's a last
chance to check speed."
The Big Row will also feature
the highly-anticipated second clash
of the undefeated No. 2 Stanford
heavyweight men and No. 3 Cal.The
Cal heavyweights have only
dropped one race in 2006, an April 2
loss to Stanford in the final of the
San Diego Crew Classic.
