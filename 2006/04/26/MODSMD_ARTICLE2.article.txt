University President John Hennessy announced yesterday afternoon that
Robert Bowlsby, currently director of athletics at the University of lowa, has been
selected to become Stanford's next athletic director. Bowlsby will take the reins
of the Stanford athletics program this July, replacing Interim Athletic Director
Bill Walsh, who has filled the position since former Athletic Director Ted Leland's
departure in October.
"I have been offered an extraordinary opportunity to join Stanford Universi
ty," Bowlsby said. "I have admired what has gone on at that university for many,
many years, and I look forward to the challenges and the rewards that will come
with my new duties."
The 13-member search committees decision came surprisingly fast.Though
the members of the committee had been in touch with the Waterloo. lowa native
from the earliest stages of the replacement process, the initial contact was simply
part of an effort soliciting recommendations for potential candidates. It wasn't
until three weeks ago that they actually approached Bowlsby about interviewing
for the position.
"Our entire search was several months long, but we had only been talking with
[Bowlsby] for about three weeks before we asked him to come and interview,"
said Provost John Etchemendy, chair of the search committee.
The University hadn't planned to introduce Bowlsby until later this week. But
when lowa press leaked the news, Stanford had no choice but to make the official
announcement yesterday.
