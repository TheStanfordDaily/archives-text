### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
University President John Hennessy announced yesterday afternoon that
Robert Bowlsby, currently director of athletics at the University of lowa, has been
selected to become Stanford's next athletic director. Bowlsby will take the reins
of the Stanford athletics program this July, replacing Interim Athletic Director
Bill Walsh, who has filled the position since former Athletic Director Ted Leland's
departure in October.
"I have been offered an extraordinary opportunity to join Stanford Universi
ty," Bowlsby said. "I have admired what has gone on at that university for many,
many years, and I look forward to the challenges and the rewards that will come
with my new duties."
The 13-member search committees decision came surprisingly fast.Though
the members of the committee had been in touch with the Waterloo. lowa native
from the earliest stages of the replacement process, the initial contact was simply
part of an effort soliciting recommendations for potential candidates. It wasn't
until three weeks ago that they actually approached Bowlsby about interviewing
for the position.
"Our entire search was several months long, but we had only been talking with
[Bowlsby] for about three weeks before we asked him to come and interview,"
said Provost John Etchemendy, chair of the search committee.
The University hadn't planned to introduce Bowlsby until later this week. But
when lowa press leaked the news, Stanford had no choice but to make the official
announcement yesterday.

Robert Bowlsby will take over for interim AD Bill Walsh in July. Bowlsby, 54, brings a wife and
four kids to the Farm, where he sees many of the same challenges he conquered at lowa.
Bowlsby himself attested to how
rapidly and dramatically his future in
collegiate athletics has changed in
such a short period of time.
"Three weeks ago, I didn't envi
sion ever going to another institu
tion," he said. "This entire process
has transpired quite quickly."
For nearly 15 years, Bowlsby has
led an lowa athletics program that
has become a national powerhouse
in football, basketball and wrestling.
Bowlsby has also helped guide Kin
nick Stadium, the 70,000-seat home
of lowa football, through much of its
$90 million renovation, much like the
facelift Stanford Stadium is currently
undergoing.
Bowlsby has also served on the
United States Olympic Committee
and as the chair of the NCAA Divi
sion 1 Basketball Tournament Com
mittee, the group that selects and
see'ds the postseason field each
March.
He competed as a wrestler
throughout high school and during
his time at Morehead State Universi
ty in Minnesota — an experience
that has contributed to his under
standing of what it is to be a student
athlete, he said.
It comes as-no surprise, then, that
in addition to playing a large part in
the Hawkeyes' numerous athletic
successes, Bowlsby has overseen sev
eral projects intended to improve
lowa student-athletes' abilities to
train and study more effectively.
During his tenure as director of
athletics at UI, Bowlsby worked with
the development staff to create $25
million in endowed scholarships to
support Hawkeye athletes. And in
August of 2003, UI opened the $4.6
million Russell and Ann Gerdin Ath
letics Learning Center, dedicated to
benefiting the men and women of
the lowa athletic program.
According to Etchemendy, it was

Obviously you've got a smaller [ recruiting] pool
to draw from. Does that create a challenge? Sure.
But does that create an opportunity? Probably.
It's a challenge I'm looking forward to.

this commitment to the both sides of
the student-athlete's life that distin
guished Bowlsby as the right man for
the job.
"The most important things to the
committee were his values and in
tegrity," Etchemendy said. "Bob
Bowlsby represents the best profes
sional and personal values when it
comes to student-athletes. He under
stands what the student-athlete has
to do on and off the field, and he
knows that the success of an athletics
program is not simply measured in
wins and losses, but in the academic
achievements and character of the

young women and men who work so
hard on the field and in the class
room. | We] are delighted he has ac
cepted our offer."
Bowlsby expressed his eagerness
to embrace the task of maintaining
Stanford's reputation as an athletic
program of the highest academic cal
iber. While he acknowledged the ef
fect the country's highest academic
standards for athletes can have on re
cruitment, he was quick to reference
his experience at lowa — the small
est state in Big 10 country.
"Obviously you've got a smaller
pool to draw from,"he said. "Does
