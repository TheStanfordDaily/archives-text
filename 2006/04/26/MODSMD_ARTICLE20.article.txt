## Smooth sailing despite unfavorable weather 
### ELIZABETH THOMPSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This past weekend in Santa Barbara, Stanford's women's
sailing team dominated the Pacific Coast Championships and
came away with a spot at Nationals. The Card accumulated
only 79 points to secure a decisive victory over second-place
University of Hawaii, who earned 92. UC-Santa Barbara took
third with 99.
On the first day of the regatta, despite rough weather, Stan
ford came out on top. Their lead was slim, however.
"We were winning the regatta after sailing on Saturday, but
we knew that in just a few races the other teams would catch
up," sophomore Sarah Schoknecht said.
In order to qualify for nationals, the Cardinal needed to
place first or second. In the A division, junior Caroline Young
skippered with junior Becca Levin as her crew. In the B divi
sion, sophomore Evan Brown skippered with another sopho
more, Carrie Denning.
Saturday's conditions had been choppy, but Sunday
proved to be a perfect day to sail â€” and win. Both Young and
Brown took off in the water, claiming their races by a gener
ous margin. Thanks to their performance, Stanford won deci
sively.
The sailors were thrilled with their victory at the PCCs.The
win not only qualified them for Nationals, but also served as a
testament to the progress they've made this season.
"Even though we were winning the regatta, the team
showed depth of drive and character by continuing to sail ag
gressively," Schoknecht said. "Our team was really happy that
we had sailed really well and came out with a definitive victo
ry over the other teams. Looking in the future towards Na
tionals, it's good to have that decisive win at PCCs."
This weekend, the Card will host the Pacific Coast Cham
pionships for team racing in Redwood City, Calif. Cal will also
host the Fleet Race PCCs on TVeasure Island.
