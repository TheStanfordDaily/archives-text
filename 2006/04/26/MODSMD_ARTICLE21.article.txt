# No payoff in NBA playoffs
## 
### 
1 absolutely love basketball. Col
lege, pro, it doesn't matter. I love it
all. Every once and a while I'll
even make the ten-minute trek back
to my alma mater, Gunn High School,
to catch a game. So that's why I find
myself dreading the yearly debacle
that is the NBA Playoffs. Somehow,
David Stern, the owners and the play
ers have figured out a way to make
basketball nearly unbearable. The
fact is, I'm an easy sell. If I'm not
watching, the NBA has a serious
problem.
My frustration with the NBA Play
offs dates back to when I first started
following basketball, but recently
things have only gotten worse. Mak
ing the first round best of seven, split
ting each conference into three divi
sions and the continual stretching of
series to accommodate TV schedules
have all combined to make the Play
offs a joke.
No problem is more exaggerated
in the postseason than the sheer
length of the event. The Playoffs
began on Saturday, April 22. If any se
ries lasts seven games, the first round
won't end until May 7.That is 16 days
to play seven games. This is done to
maximize television coverage and to
give each of the three networks cover
ing the playoffs a chance to exploit
the opportunity to the fullest. But
while I appreciate the ability to watch
every game (if I have cable), that
doesn't justify the fact that every day
of basketball is stretched too thin.
The shift to a best-of-seven format
in the first round contributed to the
brutal lengthening of the postseason,
but it had other consequences as well.
The greatest part of the best-of-five
series is that it added a little parody to
the proceedings. Nearly every season
in the NBA the top regular-season
teams play for the championship.This
has its merits, but there is something
to be said for a little drama and excite
ment as well. In the NBA there are no
George Masons because it is too hard
for an underdog to win four games, es
pecially when they must play four
games on the favorite's home floor.
The Spurs and the Pistons may pro
vide the best basketball, but it also
takes all the spice out of the game.
The ridiculous seeding rules also
spoil what should be an exciting
event. When the NBA expanded to
three divisions per conference, it cre
ated an awkward seeding system. If
the two best teams in a conference are
in the same division they must meet in
the second round, rather than in the
conference finals.
Coincidentally, that happened this
year with the Mavs and the Spurs. As
suming they both get past their first
round opponents, the Mavericks will
then be forced to play San Antonio,
with the Spurs getting home court ad
vantage. That allows the Lakers, Suns,
Clippers and Nuggets, who play on
the other side of the bracket.an unfair
chance to get out of the Western Con
ference.
When Mark Cuban found out that
he had to play the Spurs in the second
round on the road after earning the
second-best record in the league, he
probably had a coronary — and this
time I'm with him.
The current NBA Playoff system
has also created the phenomenon of
playing to lose. Just ask the Clippers
who lost (or won?) the "Battle to See
Who Could Tank it the Most" against
the Grizzlies in the final game of the
regular season. The Clippers' reward
for losing? Home court advantage
against the Nuggets. The Grizzlies'
prize for actually winning the game?
The five seed and a road series against
Dallas. Ridiculous.
Despite all of this, I would be the
first in line to watch the games if they
were worth watching. All I ask for is
close, competitive games with a little
excitement. Instead, the NBA lets
half the league into the postseason,
setting up one-sided and uninterest
ing matchups.
This year the bottom four seeds in
the Eastern Conference have a com
bined record of 164-164. Watching the
Pistons (64-18) dismantle the Bucks
(40-42) is like watching Duke play
Monmouth — four times. Throw in
the usual problems with the NBA —
horrible officiating, bad defense, lack
of team play, et cetera —and you
have at least two rounds of terrible
basketball.

destruction of what used to be one of
the most exciting postseasons in
sports. A simple look at the NFL could
shed some light on a possible solution.
First off, cut two teams out of the
playoffs. Nobody is going to beat
the Pistons or the Spurs in a seven
game series, so give them byes in
the first round. Next, seed the
teams by records. The Mavs are

without a doubt the second best
team in the West and deserve more
than one round with home-court
advantage.
Finally, shorten the first round
again. It is unfair to go any shorter
than five games, but that change alone
will shorten the playoffs and add
some thrill to the early rounds. Those
simple alterations will make the Play
offs compelling again.
But this season —just wake me up
when it's over.
