## Judge clears way for stem-cell research Decision, facing appeal, opens $3 billion for study 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
A California judge on Friday cleared the
way for the state to fund a stem-cell re
search program approved by voters in 2(X)4.
Stanford scientists at the School of Medi
cine welcomed the court decision, saying
that it would boost their research efforts.
In the November 2004 elections, Califor
nia voters approved a ballot measure by a 59
percent margin that made $3 billion of state
money available for stem-cell research over
the next decade, $250 million annually over
12 years. The measure. Proposition 71, laid
the groundwork for the California Institute
of Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), which
approves grants for researchers and organi
zations. In the initial grant process, the
School of Medicine was chosen to be one of
nine recipients of the money.
Pro-life and anti-tax groups filed legal
challenges to hinder the research program
that the voters had approved, arguing that
the process was unconstitutional because
two opposing measures were on the same
ballot. These groups also tried to have the
program thrown out on technical grounds.

asserting that the 29-member Oversight
Committee controlling CIRM could not be
accountable under state laws.
Judge Bonnie Levvman Sabraw said that
C'IRM could now begin raising money and
writing grants. The Institute had issued
bonds on April 10 as a short-term solution
to get the ball rolling. But Friday's decision
allows state officials to fund the stem-cell
effort as originally planned.
Science-friendly groups heralded the de
cision as a step in the right direction.
"This lawsuit has not just been about a
state ballot measure or a state agency in
California," said Susan DeLaurentis, presi
dent of the Alliance for Stem Cell Re
search, in a statement. "It is also about the
hopes of millions of Americans who suffer
from disease and injuries that experts agree
could greatly benefit from stem cell re
search."
University officials said that permanent
approval by the judge was crucial, and that
the short-term solution would not have sus
tained the program,
"The training grants, while they're in
service of research by training people to
work with stem cells, would not actually
allow the research to go forward." said Irv
ing Weissman. director of the Stanford In
stitute for Stem Cell Biology and Regener
ative Medicine, in an interview with the
Pharmaceutical Business Review.

An appeal is expected. The Associated
Press reported Sunday that a final answer
on the legality of the program may not be
known for another year-and-a-half.
California took up funding stem-cell re
search after the federal government made
working with certain kinds of cell lines ille
gal in 2001. This severely hindered research
in a field that is still evolving.
Experts say that restrictive federal
guidelines have put the United States at a
competitive disadvantage.The state's meas
ure was designed to keep California on the
cutting edge of research and development.
Sahraw wrote in her opinion that the CIRM
model would help the state attract scientists
from around the world.
The debate continues within the science
community about whether privately — or
publicly — funded stem cell research is
best. Steve Peckman, associate director for
UCLA's Institute for Stem Cell Biology
and Medicine, told The Daily Bruin yester
day that private research maximizes public
gain and ensures more oversight.
"If the research is done in the private
sector, then you lose the ability to ensure
adequate dissemination of the knowledge
to benefit the most amount of people," he
said. "By giving the money, [the govern
ment has] the obligation to then see how
that money is spent and to ensure there is
regulation and law."
