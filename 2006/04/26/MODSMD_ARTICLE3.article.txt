## ASSU incumbents prepare for handoff 
### GERRY SHIH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A handful of newly-elected ASSU Undergraduate
senators joined their incumbent counterparts last night
for the second Senate meeting since the elections. Ac
cordingly, as the body focused on maintaining a smooth
handoff of power. The senators of the eighth under
graduate senate will assume their positions on May 16
under the leadership of Executive Officers Elizabeth
Heng and Lauren Graham, both juniors.

During the brief meeting, an Elections Commission
bill detailing the full ASSU election results was certi
fied by a unanimous vote of current senators. The bill
included the results for executive slates, class presi
dents, Graduate Student Council and Undergraduate
Senate elections, as well as general, special-fees and
ballot measures.
Publications Board Director Brendan Marten, who
also serves as The Daily's Chief Operating Officer, re
ported to the Senate that progress has been made in
discussions between the Board and Residential Educa

tion over Stanford's door-to-door distribution policy.
Long a subject of debate and contention between stu
dents and the administration, door-to-door distribution
is currently opt-in, allowing resident fellows (RFs) to
decide whether publications may be passed out. The
Board — representing the ASSU — firmly objects to
this system.

tion director Jane] Camarillo are against al
lowing door-to-door distribution as an indi
vidual opt-out policy, and they voiced pret
ty strong concerns," Marten said in his re
port.
Marten added, however, that ResEd is
willing to strike a compromise that would
allow each dorm to have an official vote to
decide its own distribution policy — re
moving RFs from the process altogether.
Currently, RFs have the authority to ban
publication distribution within a dorm
without input from residents.
"The administration is willing to move
forward with discussion," he said. "The
Board will be happy to see a transparent
and fair election process in place."
Marten further suggested that the
ASSU might look into the possibility of
creating an online voting model for dorms
to decide distribution policies.
ASSU President Melanie Kannokada.a
senior, also updated the assembly at the
meeting. She announced the development
of a Web site to help students arrange rides
to and from airports, as well as the forma
tion of a committee to look into a push for
more classes to begin at 9 a.m. to facilitate
athletes' schedules. Kannokada added that
there will be pilot program beginning next
winter for students who cannot go home
over winter break. She also confirmed that
there will be a Row house party during
Memorial Day weekend.
The Senate approved $3,675 this week
in funding for student groups, bringing the

total amount of funding for fiscal year 2005-
2006 to $215,205.78, or 80 percent of its
roughly $270,000 budget. United Students
for Veterans Health, the Institute of Elec
trical and Electronic Engineers, Blackstage
and Women in Computer Science were all
passed to receive additional funding.
Finally, six student groups requesting

budget modifications submitted proposals
to the Senate for consideration.The pitch
es made by the six groups, including the
Stanford Band, Club Sports, Women's
Rugby, Coalition for Justice, the Axe Com
mittee and Movimiento Estudiantil Chi
cano de Aztlan, were unanimously ap
proved.
