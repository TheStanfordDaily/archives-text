# CAMPUS SPEAKERS
## Edwards to take stage at Kresge tonight Potential presidential candidate in 2008 will address poverty Young people on college campuses have changed this country before. You can do it again. 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
When John Edwards speaks at Kresge Auditori
um tonight, it will hardly be his first — or last —
talk in front of college students. After all, Edwards,
the 2004 Democratic nominee for vice president,
has been stumping at campuses around the country
since last year — talking about his anti-poverty ef
forts and his work on a bipartisan committee to
study U.S. relations with Russia.
A former North Carolina senator who lost his
seat in 2004, Edwards publicly claims to not have
thought much about his political future. But many
political analysts see his junkets — including the
speech tonight — as part of a calculated strategy to
bolster grassroots support on college campuses,
maintain a national profile and prepare to possibly
run for the 2(X)8 Democratic Party nomination for
president.
At 7 p.m., Edwards will "talk about
his work and the importance of political
activism," according to the press release
jointly issued by co-sponsors Stanford in
Government (SIG) and the ASSU
Speakers Bureau.
"As a charming public figure and
trailblazer in the Senate, we believe that
Senator Edwards will inspire the stu
dents of our University of the great im
port that the political process holds for
our peers," said senior Aron Kirschner,
SIG chair.
Edwards has been visiting campuses
big and small to talk primarily about his
efforts to combat poverty. He has been
to the University of Michigan, UC-
Berkeley and the University of Wiscon
sin-Madison. Edwards, who became fa
mous coined the concept of T\vo Ameri
cas (the haves and have-nots), has made
poverty and economic inequality his
flagship domestic priorities His speech
will likely follow the same mold of others
he has given.
Based on his previous performances,
Edwards may address Hurricane Katri
na, advocate for a minimum wage in
crease and argue that poverty is not the
result of laziness.
"Young people on college campuses
have changed this country before," he
said in Athens, Ga., earlier this month,
according to The Banner-Herald. "You
can do it again."
Last fall, Edwards went on a 10-cam
pus tour, sponsored by the Center for
Promise and Opportunity, called "Op
portunity Rocks," also to talk about
poverty — which he deems a moral
issue. He has called for an investment on
par with President Lyndon Johnson's
War on Poverty in the 19605, which he
claims reduced the problem by half in a
decade.
Edwards helped found the Center on
Poverty, Work and Opportunity at the
University of North Carolina-Chapel
Hill last year. The center's mission state
ment says it aims to help alleviate the
poverty that afflicts 37 million Ameri
cans, according to the 2000 Census.
"Poverty has a face in this country,
and it is, though not exclusively, based on
color," he told students at Yale in Octo
ber, according to The Yale Daily News.
"If you go to a poverty center...most of
them are women and most are single
mothers. We need to raise the minimum
wage [andj it should go up to $7.50."

"There is a hunger in America, a
hunger for us to be involved in some
thing big and important," Edwards said
in a January speech at Fayetteville State
University in North Carolina, according
to The Fayetteville Observer. "They
want to be inspired about something,
and it's not the war in Iraq."
Edwards often mentions his wife,
Elizabeth, who successfully completed a
round of treatment for breast cancer,
which was discovered immediately after
the 2004 election. Accordingly, Edwards
dedicated much of his post-election
focus to caring for his wife.
The charismatic 52-year-old one
term senator is known for his rags-to
riches rise to prominence — a story
often retold during the presidential cam
paign. The son of a mill worker, he put
himself through public school before be
coming a successful trial lawyer.
"Without you, nothing will happen,"
he told Harvard students in November,
according to Harvard Law School's
newspaper.
The senator has told college students
about his childhood admiration for
Robert Kennedy Jr., the Democratic
frontrunner assassinated during the
1968 presidential campaign.
Edwards began a program called
"College for Everyone" in North Caroli
na last year. High school graduates who
agree to work 10 hours a week as college
freshmen are reimbursed for the cost of
their tuition and books. The program
was tested in only one county.
Recently, Edwards has tried to broad
en his appeal by expanding his foreign
policy repertoire, which proved to be his
greatest liability in 2004. He says he
wants to have the background and a
voice on foreign policy and national se
curity issues.
He has co-chaired a task force on
U.S.-Russia relations with former Hous
ing Secretary and 19% Republican vice
presidential nominee Jack Kemp. He has

also written opinion pieces for The New
York Times and appeared on Meet the
Press to talk about his work on the
Council on Foreign Relations taskforce.
The senator has criticized President
George W. Bush for not taking proactive
steps to relieve the genocide in Sudan, a
country with severe human rights prob
lems. There is a possibility that Stan
ford's decision to divest its assets from
companies operating in Sudan could be
referenced in his speech.
Edwards has also reached out to or
ganized labor, supporting workers on
strike in Los Angeles and Miami. Just
yesterday, he joined striking service
workers on the picket line at the Univer
sity of Miami in Coral Gables, Fla. He
joined Teamsters President Jimmy
Hoffa in protesting for the right of jani
tors at the school to form a union.
These actions are seen as a sort of lit
mus test for whether he should run in
2008. Edwards has already visited New
Hampshire and lowa multiple times,
both crucial early primary states.
Knight Ridder reported in February
that Edwards had raised nearly $5 mil
lion for Democratic candidates. An arti
cle in The State of Charleston, SC. found
that Edwards visited 34 states and three
foreign countries between January 2005
and February 2006. No other potential
Democratic candidate has traveled as
much.
Edwards' political action committee
Web site reported that he will speak on
U.S.-Russia relations at the University's
Freeman Spogli Institute for Interna
tional Studies Wednesday, in addition to
his speech at Kresge.
On Thursday, Edwards will visit Col
lege TVack, a program that his Web site
said "helps low-income students gradu
ate from high school and get into col
lege."
On Sunday, he will deliver the
keynote at a forum on transatlantic ties
in Brussels.

also written opinion pieces for The New
York Times and appeared on Meet the
Press to talk about his work on the
Council on Foreign Relations taskforce.
The senator has criticized President
George W. Bush for not taking proactive
steps to relieve the genocide in Sudan, a
country with severe human rights prob
lems. There is a possibility that Stan
ford's decision to divest its assets from
companies operating in Sudan could be
referenced in his speech.
Edwards has also reached out to or
ganized labor, supporting workers on
strike in Los Angeles and Miami. Just
yesterday, he joined striking service
workers on the picket line at the Univer
sity of Miami in Coral Gables, Fla. He
joined Teamsters President Jimmy
Hoffa in protesting for the right of jani
tors at the school to form a union.
These actions are seen as a sort of lit
mus test for whether he should run in
2008. Edwards has already visited New
Hampshire and lowa multiple times,
both crucial early primary states.
Knight Ridder reported in February
that Edwards had raised nearly $5 mil
lion for Democratic candidates. An arti
cle in The State of Charleston, SC. found
that Edwards visited 34 states and three
foreign countries between January 2005
and February 2006. No other potential
Democratic candidate has traveled as
much.
Edwards' political action committee
Web site reported that he will speak on
U.S.-Russia relations at the University's
Freeman Spogli Institute for Interna
tional Studies Wednesday, in addition to
his speech at Kresge.
On Thursday, Edwards will visit Col
lege TVack, a program that his Web site
said "helps low-income students gradu
ate from high school and get into col
lege."
On Sunday, he will deliver the
keynote at a forum on transatlantic ties
in Brussels.
When John Edwards speaks at Kresge Auditori
um tonight, it will hardly be his first — or last —
talk in front of college students. After all, Edwards,
the 2004 Democratic nominee for vice president,
has been stumping at campuses around the country
since last year — talking about his anti-poverty ef
forts and his work on a bipartisan committee to
study U.S. relations with Russia.
A former North Carolina senator who lost his
seat in 2004, Edwards publicly claims to not have
thought much about his political future. But many
political analysts see his junkets — including the
speech tonight — as part of a calculated strategy to
bolster grassroots support on college campuses,
maintain a national profile and prepare to possibly
run for the 2(X)8 Democratic Party nomination for
president.
At 7 p.m., Edwards will "talk about
his work and the importance of political
activism," according to the press release
jointly issued by co-sponsors Stanford in
Government (SIG) and the ASSU
Speakers Bureau.
"As a charming public figure and
trailblazer in the Senate, we believe that
Senator Edwards will inspire the stu
dents of our University of the great im
port that the political process holds for
our peers," said senior Aron Kirschner,
SIG chair.
Edwards has been visiting campuses
big and small to talk primarily about his
efforts to combat poverty. He has been
to the University of Michigan, UC-
Berkeley and the University of Wiscon
sin-Madison. Edwards, who became fa
mous coined the concept of T\vo Ameri
cas (the haves and have-nots), has made
poverty and economic inequality his
flagship domestic priorities His speech
will likely follow the same mold of others
he has given.
Based on his previous performances,
Edwards may address Hurricane Katri
na, advocate for a minimum wage in
crease and argue that poverty is not the
result of laziness.
"Young people on college campuses
have changed this country before," he
said in Athens, Ga., earlier this month,
according to The Banner-Herald. "You
can do it again."
Last fall, Edwards went on a 10-cam
pus tour, sponsored by the Center for
Promise and Opportunity, called "Op
portunity Rocks," also to talk about
poverty — which he deems a moral
issue. He has called for an investment on
par with President Lyndon Johnson's
War on Poverty in the 19605, which he
claims reduced the problem by half in a
decade.
Edwards helped found the Center on
Poverty, Work and Opportunity at the
University of North Carolina-Chapel
Hill last year. The center's mission state
ment says it aims to help alleviate the
poverty that afflicts 37 million Ameri
cans, according to the 2000 Census.
"Poverty has a face in this country,
and it is, though not exclusively, based on
color," he told students at Yale in Octo
ber, according to The Yale Daily News.
"If you go to a poverty center...most of
them are women and most are single
mothers. We need to raise the minimum
wage [andj it should go up to $7.50."

"There is a hunger in America, a
hunger for us to be involved in some
thing big and important," Edwards said
in a January speech at Fayetteville State
University in North Carolina, according
to The Fayetteville Observer. "They
want to be inspired about something,
and it's not the war in Iraq."
Edwards often mentions his wife,
Elizabeth, who successfully completed a
round of treatment for breast cancer,
which was discovered immediately after
the 2004 election. Accordingly, Edwards
dedicated much of his post-election
focus to caring for his wife.
The charismatic 52-year-old one
term senator is known for his rags-to
riches rise to prominence — a story
often retold during the presidential cam
paign. The son of a mill worker, he put
himself through public school before be
coming a successful trial lawyer.
"Without you, nothing will happen,"
he told Harvard students in November,
according to Harvard Law School's
newspaper.
The senator has told college students
about his childhood admiration for
Robert Kennedy Jr., the Democratic
frontrunner assassinated during the
1968 presidential campaign.
Edwards began a program called
"College for Everyone" in North Caroli
na last year. High school graduates who
agree to work 10 hours a week as college
freshmen are reimbursed for the cost of
their tuition and books. The program
was tested in only one county.
Recently, Edwards has tried to broad
en his appeal by expanding his foreign
policy repertoire, which proved to be his
greatest liability in 2004. He says he
wants to have the background and a
voice on foreign policy and national se
curity issues.
He has co-chaired a task force on
U.S.-Russia relations with former Hous
ing Secretary and 19% Republican vice
presidential nominee Jack Kemp. He has
