# MEN'S FOOTBALL
## WALT: Offense will be competitive, but defense shakier 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
On the eve of Saturday's spring game, the Daily had the
chance to sit down with head football coach Walt Harris.
Here's part one of the interview. Look for part two on Friday.
The Stanford Daily: First off, I want to ask about last year.
5-6 is obviously less than ideal, but it's better than we've
had here in awhile and there just seemed to be more fight,
even in the losses. What stands out to you most about last
season?
Walt Harris: When you're in your first year of your football
program, there's a lot of things you have to change in order
to become a winning program. 1 wish it could happen
overnight. We were

obviously close; in
about three of our
games, we had a
chance to become a
winner, but we weren't
quite ready yet.
The challenge here
is always to have
enough good football
players to play the
kind of schedule that
we have to play. We all
have to buy into the
same program and
that takes a little bit of
time. But we still have
to have enough good
football players —
you can buy in and if
you don't have enough

Those guys that
were recruited
when we weren't
doing well —
they're playing,
they're starting.
— WALT HARRIS,
Head football coach

good football players, it won't matter.
I think last year was a solid start for us. It sure would
have been nice to win six or more and go to a bowl, but
there was a reason why we didn't, so we have to live with
our results.
TSI): You talk a lot about getting enough good bodies to
play Stanford football. Do you think the talent on this team
is improving? Do you think it's still going to be a problem
this year?
WH: 1 think the challenge in recruiting is to recruit well
when you're not doing well. That's everybody's challenge.
We haven't done well in quite awhile and those guys that
were recruited in those times when we weren't doing well
— they're playing, they're starting, they're seniors, they're
juniors.

Harris addressed the talent gap Stanford is struggling to
overcome — and the need to finish strong in 2006.
