# MEN'S FOOTBALL
## WALT: Offense will be competitive, but defense shakier 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
On the eve of Saturday's spring game, the Daily had the
chance to sit down with head football coach Walt Harris.
Here's part one of the interview. Look for part two on Friday.
The Stanford Daily: First off, I want to ask about last year.
5-6 is obviously less than ideal, but it's better than we've
had here in awhile and there just seemed to be more fight,
even in the losses. What stands out to you most about last
season?
Walt Harris: When you're in your first year of your football
program, there's a lot of things you have to change in order
to become a winning program. 1 wish it could happen
overnight. We were

obviously close; in
about three of our
games, we had a
chance to become a
winner, but we weren't
quite ready yet.
The challenge here
is always to have
enough good football
players to play the
kind of schedule that
we have to play. We all
have to buy into the
same program and
that takes a little bit of
time. But we still have
to have enough good
football players —
you can buy in and if
you don't have enough

Those guys that
were recruited
when we weren't
doing well —
they're playing,
they're starting.
— WALT HARRIS,
Head football coach

good football players, it won't matter.
I think last year was a solid start for us. It sure would
have been nice to win six or more and go to a bowl, but
there was a reason why we didn't, so we have to live with
our results.
TSI): You talk a lot about getting enough good bodies to
play Stanford football. Do you think the talent on this team
is improving? Do you think it's still going to be a problem
this year?
WH: 1 think the challenge in recruiting is to recruit well
when you're not doing well. That's everybody's challenge.
We haven't done well in quite awhile and those guys that
were recruited in those times when we weren't doing well
— they're playing, they're starting, they're seniors, they're
juniors.


JOEL LEWENSTEIN?The Stanford Daily
In a sit-down interview with the Daily, football coach Walt
Harris addressed the talent gap Stanford is struggling to
overcome — and the need to finish strong in 2006.
So it's going to be a challenge. We're
going to have to play really good this
year to have a chance, because there's
some areas where we really have to im
prove. We got exposed last year in cer
tain areas and we're hopeful that this
year we can overcome them.
TSD: What are some of those areas
that you're trying to work on?
WH: We've got to run the football bet
ter, and we've got to get better in the
fourth quarter, whether it be protect
ing our passer, rushing the passer, not
giving up touchdown passes, whatever
it may be.
TSDrYou talked a lot last year about not
being able to finish, and you talk about it
now. Why do you think that was?
WH:We were up against good football
teams. Look at two of our losses —
Notre Dame and UCLA each won ten
games. So to not finish against those
two teams, 1 guess we were like a lot of
other teams.
But we did finish last year. Two
years ago, we lost five games by 22
points, while a year ago, I think we ac
tually won every game somehow in
the fourth quarter. Maybe we didn't
win on a touchdown drive, but maybe
we stopped them from getting into the
end zone, or we kept it on offense and
burnt the clock like at Arizona.
So we did finish, but we need to

find a way to finish against somebody
that is far superior to us. So then 1
think we'll gain the confidence that it
takes.
We had some chances to have a
tremendous season, but didn't get it
done, and 1 think we have to play bet
ter in the fourth quarter, because that
had a lot to do with it.
TSD: Lwking ahead to this year, on
offense, you return nearly everyone,
plus you add all the incoming fresh
men and Evan Moore's back from his
injury. You know this unit pretty well
— what are you expecting out of it?
WH: We ought to execute better than
we did last year. We have a very talent
ed quarterback in Trent Edwards and,
potentially, a couple of good receivers.
We don't have enough of them. We
can't take an injury, which happened
to us last year with Bradford and
Moore. That really hurt us. We don't
have the next set of guys like we had
last year with McCullum and Crochet.
So we'll really be praying on them
being healthy.
We ought to be pretty competi
tive on offense.'We're more mature
on offense than on defense, so the of
fense is going to have to step up and
play a big part.
TSi): Flipping it over to defense, what
do you expect there in terms of

strengths and weaknesses?
WH: Well, we're inexperienced. We're
graduating a starting nose guard [Ba
batunde Oshinowo], a defensive tack
le [Julian Jenkins], an outside line
backer [Jon Alston] who all have a
chance of being drafted on the first
day of the NFL Draft, and we lose a
corner [TJ Rushing] who was an out
standing punt returner and a starter
for us.That's a lot of losses, and we also
lose an All-Pac-10 special teams per
former in Timi Wusu.
Defensively, we're going to have to
really try to step up. We think we have
a couple of good replacements, but
only time will tell. And hopefully we'll
have more guys playing than last year,
so we can perform better in the fourth
quarter.
TSI): I want to ask you about the sec
ondary'. Last year's numbers weren't
that good whatsoever. Does anything
you.see this spring give you reason for
optimism?
WH: In terms of scheme, 1 think
we're going to do things a little bit
differently that will give those peo
ple in the back a better chance at
success. We may have put them in
harm's way last year and exposed
them. We have to not give up the big
play and we have to pressure the
quarterback better.

only time will tell. And hopefully we'll
have more guys playing than last year,
so we can perform better in the fourth
quarter.
TSI): I want to ask you about the sec
ondary'. Last year's numbers weren't
that good whatsoever. Does anything
you.see this spring give you reason for
optimism?
WH: In terms of scheme, 1 think
we're going to do things a little bit
differently that will give those peo
ple in the back a better chance at
success. We may have put them in
harm's way last year and exposed
them. We have to not give up the big
play and we have to pressure the
quarterback better.
On the eve of Saturday's spring game, the Daily had the
chance to sit down with head football coach Walt Harris.
Here's part one of the interview. Look for part two on Friday.
The Stanford Daily: First off, I want to ask about last year.
5-6 is obviously less than ideal, but it's better than we've
had here in awhile and there just seemed to be more fight,
even in the losses. What stands out to you most about last
season?
Walt Harris: When you're in your first year of your football
program, there's a lot of things you have to change in order
to become a winning program. 1 wish it could happen
overnight. We were

obviously close; in
about three of our
games, we had a
chance to become a
winner, but we weren't
quite ready yet.
The challenge here
is always to have
enough good football
players to play the
kind of schedule that
we have to play. We all
have to buy into the
same program and
that takes a little bit of
time. But we still have
to have enough good
football players —
you can buy in and if
you don't have enough

Those guys that
were recruited
when we weren't
doing well —
they're playing,
they're starting.
— WALT HARRIS,
Head football coach

good football players, it won't matter.
I think last year was a solid start for us. It sure would
have been nice to win six or more and go to a bowl, but
there was a reason why we didn't, so we have to live with
our results.
TSI): You talk a lot about getting enough good bodies to
play Stanford football. Do you think the talent on this team
is improving? Do you think it's still going to be a problem
this year?
WH: 1 think the challenge in recruiting is to recruit well
when you're not doing well. That's everybody's challenge.
We haven't done well in quite awhile and those guys that
were recruited in those times when we weren't doing well
— they're playing, they're starting, they're seniors, they're
juniors.


JOEL LEWENSTEIN?The Stanford Daily
In a sit-down interview with the Daily, football coach Walt
Harris addressed the talent gap Stanford is struggling to
overcome — and the need to finish strong in 2006.
So it's going to be a challenge. We're
going to have to play really good this
year to have a chance, because there's
some areas where we really have to im
prove. We got exposed last year in cer
tain areas and we're hopeful that this
year we can overcome them.
TSD: What are some of those areas
that you're trying to work on?
WH: We've got to run the football bet
ter, and we've got to get better in the
fourth quarter, whether it be protect
ing our passer, rushing the passer, not
giving up touchdown passes, whatever
it may be.
TSDrYou talked a lot last year about not
being able to finish, and you talk about it
now. Why do you think that was?
WH:We were up against good football
teams. Look at two of our losses —
Notre Dame and UCLA each won ten
games. So to not finish against those
two teams, 1 guess we were like a lot of
other teams.
But we did finish last year. Two
years ago, we lost five games by 22
points, while a year ago, I think we ac
tually won every game somehow in
the fourth quarter. Maybe we didn't
win on a touchdown drive, but maybe
we stopped them from getting into the
end zone, or we kept it on offense and
burnt the clock like at Arizona.
So we did finish, but we need to

find a way to finish against somebody
that is far superior to us. So then 1
think we'll gain the confidence that it
takes.
We had some chances to have a
tremendous season, but didn't get it
done, and 1 think we have to play bet
ter in the fourth quarter, because that
had a lot to do with it.
TSD: Lwking ahead to this year, on
offense, you return nearly everyone,
plus you add all the incoming fresh
men and Evan Moore's back from his
injury. You know this unit pretty well
— what are you expecting out of it?
WH: We ought to execute better than
we did last year. We have a very talent
ed quarterback in Trent Edwards and,
potentially, a couple of good receivers.
We don't have enough of them. We
can't take an injury, which happened
to us last year with Bradford and
Moore. That really hurt us. We don't
have the next set of guys like we had
last year with McCullum and Crochet.
So we'll really be praying on them
being healthy.
We ought to be pretty competi
tive on offense.'We're more mature
on offense than on defense, so the of
fense is going to have to step up and
play a big part.
TSi): Flipping it over to defense, what
do you expect there in terms of

strengths and weaknesses?
WH: Well, we're inexperienced. We're
graduating a starting nose guard [Ba
batunde Oshinowo], a defensive tack
le [Julian Jenkins], an outside line
backer [Jon Alston] who all have a
chance of being drafted on the first
day of the NFL Draft, and we lose a
corner [TJ Rushing] who was an out
standing punt returner and a starter
for us.That's a lot of losses, and we also
lose an All-Pac-10 special teams per
former in Timi Wusu.
Defensively, we're going to have to
really try to step up. We think we have
a couple of good replacements, but
only time will tell. And hopefully we'll
have more guys playing than last year,
so we can perform better in the fourth
quarter.
TSI): I want to ask you about the sec
ondary'. Last year's numbers weren't
that good whatsoever. Does anything
you.see this spring give you reason for

ple in the back a better chance at
