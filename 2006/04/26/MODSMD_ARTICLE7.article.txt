## What is plastic really? Why you should know. 
### 
Here you are, dutifully recycling your milk jug
on Earth Day, when you realize that you real
ly have no idea what plastic is.
Well, maybe not no idea. If nothing else, you know
that plastics can be separated into seven different groups
— thanks to recycling labels. You may even know that
most plastics are derived from the same materials that
we say we use too much of — oil and natural gas.
But beyond that, the wrist bracelets and walk
mans that have permeated your life since childhood
probably still hold many secrets. Looking down at
your hand before you drop the "#2 HDPE" contain
er into a green bin, you stop and eye your mysterious
bosom buddy, for the first time worriedly wondering,
"HDPE...What did I just drink out of?"
Despite its mysterious facade, plastic is really just a
type of synthetic polymer — in chemical terms, a
long chain of carbon-based molecules. When oil is re
fined, the monomers, or single molecules, used to
form plastics are separated and, through various chem
ical processes, joined together to create polymers. Poly
ethylene, the most common class of plastics, is a simple
chain of ethylene monomers — CH2 molecules.
What has made plastics so popular is their ability
to be molded into different shapes, from three-di
mensional objects to film spreads, hardening either
by cooling or by having a solvent evaporate out of
them. Ultimately, plastics are often able to replace
what we think of as more natural resources — like
paper, glass and steel — by requiring less production
material and energy to fulfill the same function.
Plastics are so commonplace that we never really
have to stop and think about them — unless we're re
cycling. Then we have to think a lot about them, or at
least which number they are. In that case, we're most
familiar with plastics number 1, PETE, and number 2,
HDPE; otherwise known as "polyethylene tereph
thalate" and "high density polyethylene," respective
ly. These two types comprise nearly 80 percent of the
plastics recovered in waste streams, largely from soda
bottles (PETE) and milk jugs (HDPE).
PETE (or PET), though also used in other applica
tions like textiles and food packaging, is primarily used
for making blow-molded soda bottles — alone ac
counting for 70 to 80 percent of all PETE consumption.
HDPE, comprised of regular linear chains of eth
ylene monomers, is the harder cousin of plastic #4,
low-density polyethylene (LDPE). In LDPE, chains
of CH2 form many branches, making the plastic soft
and pliable. HDPE's straight chains make it denser,
so it is often molded into bowls and toys, or used to
make milk jugs.
These two plastics are the most easily recycled.
PETE, for example, can be reprocessed up to five
times while maintaining its mechanical properties.
Other plastics only wish they could say the same.
Unfortunately, that's where the good news on the
recycling front tends to stop.
Plastic use has increased dramatically over the
past century, with 50 times more plastic present in the
American municipal solid waste stream in 1993 than
in 1960. Not to worry, energy security hawks — plas
tic production totals only about 4 percent of Ameri
can oil use. (gives some perspective on how much oil
we as a country use for fuel, doesn't it?)
But. don 't be fooled by Palo Alto's new recycling col
lection policies. Just because you stick all your plastics
(and other recyclables, for that matter) into the same
bin doesn't mean it's all put to new uses. An American
Plastics Council study showed that when consumers
weren't forced to separate their plastics by number, they
ended up recycled even more #1 soda bottles and #2
milk jugs. The unwanted material is simply sorted out
after pickup, usually through mechanical processes that
can separate plastics based on color and density. The
cutting edge of recycling technology uses spectroscopic
processes that can recognize plastic by type, but it's still
not uncommon for some plastics to be sorted manually.
In the end, only about 3.5 percent of all plastics are
actually recovered via recycling, thanks to the major
presence of less re-use friendly plastics like plastic #3,
polyvinyl chloride of PVC pipe fame, and plastic #6,
polystyrene. While the recycling rates for PET and
HDPE are 22 percent and 23.8 percent, respectively,
only 0.5 percent of all PVC and a miniscule 0.1 per
cent of all polystyrene (in which a benzene ring re
places some of the hydrogen molecules in our trust
worthy CH2 chain) is recycled.
Aside from bottles and jugs, other plastics aren't re
cycled because they can't be economically sorted, col
lected and cleaned. Plastics in computers and cars, for
example, currently need to be sorted manually be
cause each has so many different components: howev
er. the costs of doing so are usually greater than the
price recyclers can receive for the postconsumer mate
rial. Even the material in PETE soda bottles degrades
enough that it is ultimately put to less demanding uses
— in fibers for jackets or cushion filling. In contrast,
packaging plastics have little value after being recy
cled, so they generally aren't. For these plastics, the
only type of recycling left available is energy recycling
— burning the plastics to try to recover some of the en
ergy used to produce them. Unless done in a con
trolled setting, however, burning plastics may create
harmful toxins like dioxin or release chlorine from
plastics like PVC — not good news on Earth Day.
So as you toss your milk jug in the plastic recycling
bin, you can at least know that it won't be crushed in
vein" If nothing else, now you know what you're
drinking from and have a little more insight into life's
perennial choice — paper or plastic?

recycling front tends to stop.
Plastic use has increased dramatically over the
past century, with 50 times more plastic present in the
American municipal solid waste stream in 1993 than
in 1960. Not to worry, energy security hawks — plas
tic production totals only about 4 percent of Ameri
can oil use. (gives some perspective on how much oil
we as a country use for fuel, doesn't it?)
But. don 't be fooled by Palo Alto's new recycling col
lection policies. Just because you stick all your plastics
(and other recyclables, for that matter) into the same
bin doesn't mean it's all put to new uses. An American
Plastics Council study showed that when consumers
weren't forced to separate their plastics by number, they
ended up recycled even more #1 soda bottles and #2
milk jugs. The unwanted material is simply sorted out
after pickup, usually through mechanical processes that
can separate plastics based on color and density. The
cutting edge of recycling technology uses spectroscopic
processes that can recognize plastic by type, but it's still
not uncommon for some plastics to be sorted manually.
In the end, only about 3.5 percent of all plastics are
actually recovered via recycling, thanks to the major
presence of less re-use friendly plastics like plastic #3,
polyvinyl chloride of PVC pipe fame, and plastic #6,
polystyrene. While the recycling rates for PET and
HDPE are 22 percent and 23.8 percent, respectively,
only 0.5 percent of all PVC and a miniscule 0.1 per
cent of all polystyrene (in which a benzene ring re
places some of the hydrogen molecules in our trust
worthy CH2 chain) is recycled.
Aside from bottles and jugs, other plastics aren't re
cycled because they can't be economically sorted, col
lected and cleaned. Plastics in computers and cars, for
example, currently need to be sorted manually be
cause each has so many different components: howev
er. the costs of doing so are usually greater than the
price recyclers can receive for the postconsumer mate
rial. Even the material in PETE soda bottles degrades
enough that it is ultimately put to less demanding uses
— in fibers for jackets or cushion filling. In contrast,
packaging plastics have little value after being recy
cled, so they generally aren't. For these plastics, the
only type of recycling left available is energy recycling
— burning the plastics to try to recover some of the en
ergy used to produce them. Unless done in a con
trolled setting, however, burning plastics may create
harmful toxins like dioxin or release chlorine from
plastics like PVC — not good news on Earth Day.
So as you toss your milk jug in the plastic recycling
bin, you can at least know that it won't be crushed in
vein" If nothing else, now you know what you're
drinking from and have a little more insight into life's
perennial choice — paper or plastic?
