V ecently, phone tapping has taken center stage due to the Patriot Act
and the ongoing debate it spurred over civil liberties. Phone taps may
m be new to you, but its premise dates all the way back to the IB9o's. Its
1 J predecessor, telegraph tapping, was employed during the Civil War by
I Union generals at the battle of Vicksburg as well as on Sherman's
March to the Sea. Union soldiers would make enterprising raids into

enemy territory and relay Confederate dispatches to their com-

manders. These operations provided important information, but attract-

ing men to volunteer for the position was made rather more dif-

ficult by the slim likelihood that they would live to enjoy

their fame. A. W. Greely, a Union general in the Civil
War, wrote that there were "more than three hun-

dred casualties among the operators."
More recently, phone tapping has involved

fewer battlefield heroics and more techni
cal sophistication. A telephone can be
tapped by taking an exposed point on the
outside phone line it connects to and at
taching a device that can translate elec
tric current into a pattern of air-pressure
fluctuations that correspond to sound
waves. This could be a normal phone, if
you're willing to hang around 24/7 wait
ing for someone to place a call on a
tapped phone; more commonly, a device
is used to allow transmission of the con
versation to a remote location. This is the

bug of spy film fame.
This part is fairly simple; there are
guides on the Internet explaining how to
tap phone lines with little more than alliga
tor clips and a recording device. And official

phone tapping, which previously required
technicians, has been immensely simplified
for all phones with digital phone exchanges
(the place where phone calls are

connected).The government can complete
the phone-tapping operation and

record the conversation with
only a computer. There is

no chance of detection.
Phone tapping starts to get complicated when it conies to cell
phones. The mobile nature of cellular phones can pose a security
threat; one method for eavesdropping on a cell phone conversa
tion is to use a device called an 1 MSI-catcher, which masquerades
as the base station of the service provider, thus gaining access to
the conversation.lliis method — similar to some computer hack
ing techniques — requires knowing the location of the subject
that you want to eavesdrop on. But if the general vicinity of the
subject is determined, he or she can be "zoomed in on" by meas
uring the "timing advance," an adjustment for the distance of the
subject to a base station based on the speed of light.
But the quest for improving cell phone security is still far from

complete and always under threat from intelligence services seek-

ing to subvert these measures. Phones that use secure

encryption cannot be easily deciphered or dis-

abled. But there are still many barriers to the

spread of these phones, such as compati
bility issues and price. And one doesn't

have to wear a tin-foil hat to realize
that the tap-happy German and

Dutch governments' opposition
to shutting down the loopholes
that allow eavesdropping
means that the current system
is going to be here for a while.
