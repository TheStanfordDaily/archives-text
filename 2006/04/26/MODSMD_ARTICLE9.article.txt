# Grad student aims to overhaul public education
## 
### JANET KIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When Mike Rauta headed to Stanford
in 2003, he came not only for graduate de
grees in business and education, but to
achieve a considerably broader goal: to
change kindergarden-12th grade educa
tion in the United States. His ambition
was rooted in notably less grand begin
nings, though: helping his younger sister
with math.
"Helping her made me realize how she
hadn't learned certain topics early enough
and deep enough to help her master math
as a subject," he said. "I realized how nec
essary it is that children get more practice
and more exposure in math early on."
This inspiration prompted Rauta to
found Foundations for Education, a non
profit organization serving elementary
school students in the Menlo Park, Palo
Alto and Los Altos areas. It is an enrich
ment program that caters to a wide range
of academic abilities, so that students in
the program are able to supplement their
understanding of math, science and read
ing with additional challenges and instruc
tion that are appropriate to their respec
tive levels.
"We try to make a big difference by get
ting involved early on in the students'
lives," he said.

What began as Rauta's personal proj
ect at the Graduate School of Business has
now expanded to a full-fledged program
that offers after-school math enrichment
during the school year, and instruction in
reading, math, and science during the sum
mertime. Foundations for Education pro
vides after-school instruction for approxi
mately 1 (X) students; while Rauta project
ed that the upcoming summer program
would include about 30 students, he was
optimistic about the fact that "students are
still signing up."
Rauta attributed the impressive size of
the program to word of mouth, which was
the initial catalyst for the program's large
draw.
"When we started off with the program
in 2(K)3, we had three students sign up for
the summer program,? he said. ?By the
end of the summer, the class had expand
ed to twenty students, because the parents
of the students in the class had told their
friends about the program."
He also noted the importance of work
ing with area schools.
"We are hosted by the schools as after
school programs, and this cooperation
with the schools makes it a partnership."
Foundations for Education, while unaf
filiated with the University, has an instruc
tor pool comprised entirely of Stanford
students.

"The whole purpose of the program is
to pair a really great role model with a
small group of children, and then to get
them following a top curriculum." Rauta
said.
Danika Dukes, a senior sociology
major and a team lead for the program,
noted that Stanford students provided a
unique addition to the classroom setting.
"Since we aren't yet 'adults' in the kids'
eyes, we don't scare them so much, but we
definitely aren't peers, so we garner some
respect that way," she explained. "We are
able to forge a different relationship to
learning with the kids that can often times
be missing in the classroom."
According to Rauta, the benefits of the
system work both ways: while elementary
school kids receive top-notch instruction.
Stanford students can also use their in
volvement in the program as an experi
ence in growth and self-discovery.
"We get a lot of students who — even
though they're pre-law, pre-mcd — have
always had teaching as a dream in the back
of their minds. The program helps them
get a taste for what teaching is like," Rauta
said. Alumni from the program have con
tinued on to programs like Teach for
America and the Peace Corps, and stu
dents who graduate from Stanford often
stay on with Foundations for Education as
instructors.

In Dukes' case, she found that her ex
perience as an administrator for the pro
gram has helped her gain valuable experi
ence. Her long list of duties includes man
aging the team of instructors for the day,
communicating with parents, acting as a li
aison between the school and the program
and developing curricula for the program.
The growth of the program — Founda
tions for Education has expanded to five
schools, and is looking to add programs at
three to five schools in the next academic
year — also directly affects Dukes.
"The challenging thing in my manage
ment position is maintaining our standard
of teaching while changing certain organi
zational practices to accommodate our
growing program," she said. "Our growth
leads us to probably one of the biggest
problems we consistently face every quar
ter: a lack of instructors!"
But Rauta was optimistic about the
ability of the program to attract a large,
competent group of instructors from the
Stanford community.
"It provides great experiences and op
portunities for those involved," he said.
"Stanford students can get experience
teaching and leading."
Dukes agreed.
"I was pretty much hooked after two
quarters," she said. "This is a great pro
gram and can only get better with growth."
