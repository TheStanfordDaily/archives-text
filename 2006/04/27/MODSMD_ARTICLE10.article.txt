## GSC evaluates academic calendar changes Members speak with Registrar, certify election results 
### NICK PARKER DESK EDITOR 
University Registrar Roger Printup spoke to the
Graduate Student Council (GSC) last night about
issues relating to the academic calendar. GSC mem
bers also certified the results of this year's ASSU
elections.
Printup discussed the decision to start fall quar
ter classes on a Monday instead of a Wednesday as
well as the decision to give students a full week of
vacation at Thanksgiving. He explained that both of
these changes, which were new this year, would stay
in place for academic year 2006-2007, but would be
voted on next year by the Faculty Senate.
The choice to begin the academic year on a Mon
day ensures that the fall quarter has 10 weeks of
class with five days of class in each week â€” making
it longer than both the winter and spring quarters,
which lose multiple Mondays to national holidays.

he explained.
Printup said the change was made on the as
sumption that a full week of classes to start the
quarter would facilitate the beginning of sections
and labs.
"One of the hopes was that if we had an entire
week of classes, then discussion sections and labs
would actually meet during that first week," he said.
Tom Lee. GSC co-chair and a fourth year gradu
ate student in electrical engineering, debunked this
claim and explained that sections are not in place
during the first week of class, even with a full five
days.
"In cases where the sections are not determined
before you arrive in a class, it usually takes a week
to organize that anyway," he said.
GSC members were, however, generally in sup
port of the Monday start to fall quarter.
"As someone who is teaching or organizing a
class, losing Mondays to holidays or scheduling is
sues throws a wrench in your schedule," said Adam
Beberg, the GSC Funding Committee Chair and a
graduate student in computer science.
Members were more ambivalent on the Thanks

giving break issue.
Some students praised the full week off as a
great opportunity to visit family.
"[A week off at Thanksgiving] is nice for grad.
students in some sense because we get two chances
to see our families," Lee said.
Other GSC members, however, questioned the
timing of the vacation near the end of the quarter.
"The general consensus is that all the momen
tum is sucked out of a class," Beberg said. "The stu
dents are completely knocked out of their flow be
cause of the full week off. From a student perspec
tive it's great, but from a TA perspective, it's not so
good."
After conversing with Printup. the GSC unani
mously approved the results of the April 12-13
ASSU elections.
Members also discussed next week's meeting,
when the search committee for the newly-created
position of vice provost for graduate education and
the vice provost and dean of research will visit the
GSC. Six members volunteered to meet before next
Wednesday's meeting to discuss what questions
they want to ask the search committee.
