## PETA ORGANIZES PROTEST IN WHITE PLAZA TO RAISE AWARENESS 
### BEN EPPLER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For the last three days, a poster
exhibit about the ethics of animal ex
ploitation has dominated White
Plaza. The display, called "The Ani
mal Liberation Project," was pro
duced by People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals (PETA) and
has visited college campuses across
the nation for the last two months.
The student group Animal Rights
on the Farm (ARF) sponsored
PETA's visit to Stanford as part of its
activities for World Week for Ani
mals in Laboratories.
The exhibit consisted of five
large panels emblazoned with im
ages of humans and animals suffer
ing together with famous quota
tions from activists such as Martin
Luther King, Jr.

The objective, according to
Sangeeta Kumar, education coordi
nator for PETA, was to point out
comparisons between mistreatment
of humans and oppression of ani
mals.
"We want people to examine the
mindset of oppression," she said.
"No matter how different animals
may seem from us, they have the
same capacity to suffer."
Student reaction to the exhibit
was characterized as "overwhelm
ingly positive," by ARF President
Claire Wagenseiha senior, who also
noted that many visitors took the
available audio tour and seemed en
gaged by the material presented.
Kumar said that over 2,500 infor
mational aids, such as booklets on
factory farming and vegetarianism.
were distributed in three days.
"It was a huge success," she
added.
Students' reactions to the materi
al presented were thoughtful, said
Kumar.
"Students were very meticulous
about reading and coming back and
asking questions," she said. "I was
just impressed by their critical think
ing."
"The Animal Liberation Pro
ject" has stirred controversy at other
colleges and universities it has visit
ed because its posters contain im
ages of oppression of minority
groups,such as a picture of the hang
ing of an African American during
the Jim Crow South. At the request
of ARF, three panels were not dis
played during the exhibit's trip to
Stanford.
TWenty-seven billion animals are
killed for food every year. Accord
ing to PETA, 11 million of these
spend their lives in "factory farms,"
where they live and die in squalor
and misery.
