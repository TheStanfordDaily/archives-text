activities for World Week for Ani

mindset of oppression," she said.

may seem from us, they have the
same capacity to suffer."
Student reaction to the exhibit
was characterized as "overwhelm

Claire Wagenseiha senior, who also
noted that many visitors took the
available audio tour and seemed en
gaged by the material presented.
