## Destination Dining Sinfully Good Eats at Synergy 
### 
Wanting a break from the oppres
sive institutional qualities of Des
tination Dining, this week Liebn
er and Louk traveled to Synergy to experi
ence the bounty that is the co-op dinner.
For Liebner, who spent her sophomore
year hippydippying it up in Synergy and her
junior year in Columbae, this trip to Syner
gy was much like a Grateful Dead nostalgia
tour. For Louk, a stranger to the co-op
scene, it was probably more akin to smok
ing pot for the first time: eager with antici
pation, unsure if he would actually like it,
and continually wondering just what's
going to happen next. (At least, that's what
we speculate—the only grass we goody
goody RAs do is alfalfa on our sandwiches.)
For those who haven't had the good for
tune of experiencing a scrumptious supper
at Synergy, the food hits the table when the
chefs—fellow residents—have completed
the meal. As this does not always happen
precisely at 6 p.m., residents and guests
have time to mingle and converse.
Irony was apparently among the guests,
as Synergy was the last place Louk and
Liebner expected to see a pre-dinner game
of Risk, the no-holds-barred strategy game
that resulted in an aborted friendship for
Louk in middle school. We'll assume it was
an immersion study in the international re
lations theory of realism and not a submis
sion to the capitalist system.
Spirits were high in the house and thick
in our mugs as Liebner and Louk chatted
with residents and fellow guests while wait
ing for the meal. When the chefs finally
emerged with the food, the house gathered
near the foyer to take a moment before the
meal. Like the co-op form of a football hud
dle, we pumped ourselves up to eat, and,
amid a thunderous chant of "QUE RICO"
(a Synergy "sou-ee," if you will), we
charged (OK, communally and politely
lined up) for our dinners.
Going on a Wednesday, Louk and Lieb
ner had to forsake the wonders of Wilbur's
Wednesday brunch-for-dinner, but Louk's
nostalgia for French toast was quickly sub
sumed by the fantastic fare (shout-out to
our chef, fellow RA and former fellow
columnist Robin Pam). Said fare included
vegetarian and vegan enchilada casserole
with lots of cheese (but not on the vegan),
Mexican rice, delicious black beans, real
guacamole, two varieties of homemade
salsa, and Mexican wedding cookies.
Co-op etiquette dictates that due to lim
ited quantities of such delicious delights, it's
best to do as the community-minded hippie
locals do and take only a little of everything
to make sure that everyone gets some. If
there's anything left after all have gone
through the line, it's kosher to go back and
get seconds (though on terrific nights like
that of Louk and Liebner's visit, there's not
likely to be much).
Once everyone has a heaping plate of
vegetarian goodness, the house claps to
show appreciation for the efforts of the
night's chefs. Because we came on a
Wednesday, we were treated not just to an
amazing dinner but were also privy to a
Synergy house meeting. This particular
meeting included the assignment of "elf
jobs"—doing little chores such as washing
the bathroom hand towels to help keep the
house neat and tidy. This was something
akin to setting up a society, but one in which
residents picked roles in Smurf Village.
Louk liked the idea, and as he and Lieb
ner rolled down the hill to Wilbur full and
happy, he had a brainstorm: Why not imple
ment this system back in their freshmen
dorms? But rather than have their resi
dents do little jobs to keep their dorms tidy,
Louk and Liebner could have them keep
their RA's lives lives tidy. Louk is looking
forward to his clothes-folding elf and Lieb
ner has already been cashing in on her mas
sage elf.
In putting the co-opt in co-operative,
Louk has come to a new level of apprecia
tion for Synergy—and its cooking.
Final score: 5 humongous blocks of tofu +
1 bowl of granola (but only because it's de
licious and homemade at Synergy)
Destination Dining standings:
In the dorm dining hall division:
1. Lagunita: 5 tofu.O cereal
2. FloMo: 3.5 tofu. 1.5 cereal
3. Ricken 1 tofu, 5 cereal
4. Branner: 0 tofu, 0 cereal (what, not even
Lucky Charms??)
Synergy is the first in the "row house" divi
sion, so all we've got is:
1. Synergy: 5 tofu, -1 cereal

lem set and thesis-writing elves, respectively,
