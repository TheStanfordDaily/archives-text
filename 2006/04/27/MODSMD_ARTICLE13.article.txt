# Drinking Without the Nangover
## Scientist Proposes Alcohol Substitute 
### BY KATHERINE COX CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
magine waking up on a Sunday morning, feel
ing healthy and thinking fondly about the pre
vious night's frat party and your impeccable
behavior. Sound unlikely? A beverage that
mimics the "good" effects of alcohol may
someday take the swagger, the scuffle, the
black-outs, the bruises and the hangover out of
the college drinking scene, and allow casual

drinkers everywhere to make merry with a little more
dignity.
In the Journal of Psychopharmacology's May 2006
issue, David Nutt,a British scientist and professor of psy
chopharmacology, introduces a proposal that credits
modern-day science with the ability to easily engineer
such a drink. The drink would contain a drug that Nutt
proposes is safer than alcohol and would diminish the in
cidence of health and criminal problems associated with
alcohol consumption.
The drink would also make the recreational drinking
experience a little less bumpy. According to Nutt, it would
reduce the notorious and inevitable side-effects of exces
sive alcohol consumption, such as memory loss, nausea,
aggression and impaired coordination.These undesirable
effects result primarily from ethanol's interaction prima
rily with GABA-A receptors, which are inhibitory neuro
transmitters in the brain.
Nutt makes his pitch based on scientists' improved un
derstanding of the GABA-A receptor subtypes and their
respective functions. The ability to differentiate among
these functions could allow scientists to flag certain re
ceptors for producing undesirable effects and create com
pounds that bind only with those that lead to pleasurable
sensations.
According to Nutt, these compounds, or partial ago
nists, aren't difficult to engineer. TTie trick is to synthesize
partial agonists that won't bind to "bad" receptors but will
still attach to the molecules that help bring about social
amicability and the "fun" feeling that we associate with an
alcoholic buzz. Partial agonists of the GABA-A receptor
have already been developed as alternatives to tolerance
forming antianxiety drugs.

Trials

conducted on

animals and humans

with these substances have

produced encouraging results.

"They also show little sedation, even in overdose, and few
signs of dependence or withdrawal in animals are report
ed. Moreover, they have the additional safety benefit
over alcohol that an overdose can instantly be reversed
by administering an antagonist, e.g. flumenzil," Nutt
writes in the recent publication. Flumazenil is an antago
nist, or a blocking agent. It is currently in production and
is usually prescribed as the antidote to overdoses of Vali
um.
As part of Nutt's hypothetical super-beverage scheme,
flumazenil, or some variation of the antagonist, could elim
inate the annoying task of finding a sober driver and the
even more disagreeable chore of being one.
"Envisage the situation where, after a party where PA's
were consumed, the revelers took an antagonist, such as a
longer lasting flumazenil so allowing them to 'sober-up'
instantly and be able to drive home quite safely," he
writes.
The potential impact of this built-in safety net for col
lege students is literally sobering. According to Ralph
Castro, manager of Stanford's Substance Abuse Preven
tion Program, the program's primary concern is students'
overuse of alcohol — a substance that is meant to be
taken in moderate doses, he says. In theory, if students
consumed drinks containing PAs in place of alcohol, then
binge drinking could only lead to an immediately re
versible overdose.
Nutt's proposal registers well with Stanford stu
dents. Sophomore Kyle White is enamored with the
idea of the new drink. "It would be kind of nice to not
lose control," he says. "A lot of times when I drink I do
stuff that I don't necessarily want to do and will regret.
It would be nice to have a little more control over the
things I do when I drink."

He also says he
wouldn't mind regaining much the loss of motor control
that results from a switch from alcohol to PA consump
tion. "Considering all the times I run around the dorm in
my sleep and wake up with cuts and bruises all over, I
think this would be a great feature of the drink. Though I
might miss the stumbling home from parties with my
friends. I'd definitely like to escape the damage that I do
to my body a lot more."
Another sophomore, Mark McClure.felt that the drugs'
attributes and superiority to alcohol would be highly ap
pealing to his peers. "I think that college students are al
ways looking for personality-altering substances. If it were
legal. I'm sure everybody would try it. When you eliminate
the hangover, falling over, bruising your arms, I think alco
hol would soon fall out of favor," he says.
But he is also skeptical of Nutt's optimistic vision.
"Users could become psychologically dependent, which
is dangerous. And for teenagers, it could become a gate
way drug," McClure continues.
But at this point, any musings about the drugs' popu
larity and societal effects are premature. Castro points
out that in the United States, the drug would have to with
stand four levels of FDA approval testing.
"Even then," Castro says,"it would be regulated by the
DEA as a drug — meaning you would need a prescrip
tion to get it."
According to Castro's timeline, the days of hangover
free drinking are generations away.
"To be honest, I cannot imagine this drug gaining support
from the FDA or DEA in the current political climate
here in the U. 5.," he said. "Also, most colleges and univer
sities get direction from federal and state agencies in re
gard to laws and regulations. ITierefore, I cannot envision
a college or university taking a stand on this proposed
drug without a comprehensive review and extensive
study on human subjects."
