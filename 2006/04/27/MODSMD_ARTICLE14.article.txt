# Unmasking Myths About Mono
## 
### SINI MATIKAINEN DESK EDITOR 
It's the scourge of Full Moon on
the Quad, of chem majors in the
middle of finals and of students
with sore throats who go to Vaden
hoping for an antibiotic prescrip
tion. Mononucleosis, more affec
tionately known as the "kissing dis
ease," has quite a reputation for
waylaying people for months and
spreading quickly (much like the
plague) from person to person. But
how much of that reputation is de
served?
Its romantic nickname, for exam
ple, is a bit of a misnomer. Though
mono is spread by contact with sali
va, the idea of it being solely or
even mostly spread by kissing is ex
aggerated. A person is more likely
to come into contact with the virus
in a much less cinematic way — by
taking a bite of someone's food or
by sharing a bottle of water on a
hot day. And, surprisingly enough,
most people have already contract

ed the virus.
"A study a few years ago tested
all incoming freshmen at Yale and
found that more than 50% had al
ready had mono without even ex
hibiting symptoms," says Dr. John
Dorman, a member of the clinical
staff at Vaden Health Center. "It
seems that when the infection takes
place in a young child, it's often
much milder and passes just like a
normal cold."
The virus is actually one of the
most prevalent on the planet, and
the Center for Disease Control esti
mates that 95 percent of American
adults between 35 and 40 years old
have been infected at some point in
their lives. By the time they reach
college, many people have already
contracted the virus and developed
immunity to it.
Despite its prevalence, some
Stanford students feel that being in
fected with the virus comes with a
social stigma. Freshman Meghan
McCurdy, who was diagnosed fall
quarter, says,"I felt like a few peo

ple [in my dorm] thought I should
be committed to quarantine or
something. My RA ended up send
ing out an email to the dorm to
clear up some common myths and
that helped quite a bit."
Julia, a junior who wanted to
withhold her last name, notes, "My
mother was scandalized when I told
her I had mono and demanded,
'What have you been doing over
there at Stanford?!' I'm still not
sure whether I caught it from kiss
ing or just from sharing drinks, but
people always assume that you
have caught it from kissing and
tease you."
McCurdy agrees, "It's funny, be
cause I actually got my blood tested
the day after Full Moon on the
Quad and got the official diagnosis
two days afterwards, so everyone
assumed I got it from that night."
Full Moon on the Quad's repu
tation for spreading mono is also
probably exaggerated. The virus
has an incubation period of four to
six weeks, so anyone who con

tracts that night will not be diag
nosed until weeks later, and might
not even think of the event as the
culprit. Dorman, when asked
about the potentially dire afteref
fects of the event, said that he has
not noticed any upsurge in cases
four to six weeks after the October
full moon.
"And most people have already
been exposed to the virus anyway,"
Dorman emphasizes.
Other infamous characteristics of
the virus, including its long recovery
time and the lingering fatigue, de
scribe the disease more accurately.
Its worst symptoms, including
swollen lymph nodes, sore throat
and fever are supposed to be gone
after a week or two, but a general
feeling of malaise can persist for
months. In addition, the virus puts
great strain on the spleen, so those
infected are discouraged from in
tense exercise that could cause the
organ to rupture.This can prove dif
ficult for Stanford students trying
to balance a busy schedule of class

es and athletics. Other "extracurric
ulars" are affected, as well —
mono can enlarge the liver, making
drinking potentially dangerous.
A senior on the triathlon team
who wishes to remain anonymous
says,"The worst part of having
mono for me was the interruption
of my training and racing schedule,
and the lack of energy that I had."
Notes Julia.'T had to miss a week
of class. The teachers were under
standing. but it still killed my grade
in Chem 33 from missing so many
lectures."
"Some days I would sleep 12 or
14 hours and still feel like I'd pulled
several all-nighters in succession,"
McCurdy says."I was so tired that
even when I was asleep, sometimes
I'd dream about napping."
Still, the virus is not necessarily
all bad. As McCurdy remarks,
"There's no need to feel guilty nap
ping anytime you want. Also, mono
got my mom to stop asking me why
my romantic life was so nonexist
ent, which was aces."
