## Editorial End discrimination, honor the silence 
### 
Today, the Stanford campus celebrates
the National Day of Silence, during
which the LGBT community and its al
lies literally adopt the forced silence that
many have had imposed upon them. We re
spect queer and straight allies for their deter
mination to stay silent all day in protest what
can only be called systemic discrimination
against their LGBT peers. Whatever your
own personal views on homosexuality, we
urge you to take a principled stand against
hatred, homophobia and discrimination.
Incidentally, it has been about a week
since President John Hennessy and Law
School Dean Larry Kramer chose to break
the silence about the Solomon Amendment.
They have condemned the military's "Don't
Ask, Don't Tell" policy even though they are
forced to accept military recruiters on cam
pus. We applaud Hennessy and Kramer for
their resolve in fighting blatantly discrimina
tory practices.
All the usual arguments against the mili
tary's policy have been restated by the Uni
versity administration and LGBT groups
like OUTLAW. As they rightly point out,
discriminating against gays in the armed
forces only imposes costs on the U.S. military
that it can scarcely afford in this period of
war. Proponents of gay rights have cited the
unconstitutionality of the Solomon Amend
ment, which compels universities to accept
military recruiters. In response LGBT
groups have been extremely active in gener
ating awareness about the issue, issuing
statements to The Stanford Report and The
Stanford Daily.
To some extent, much of it is a done deal.
The Supreme Court has handed down a
unanimous opinion that upholds the consti
tutionality of the process. As such, there
seems little that the Stanford community can

do to reverse the decision. Moreover, the
current situation is a logical consequence of
the University's decision to accept federal
funding â€” and there are more fundamental
problems that need to be addressed in that
respect.
Still, the University needs to continue to
protest the military's presence on campus.
Even the same old arguments bear repeat
ing. We believe in the broader principle of
protest and Stanford's role as a leader in
shaping public opinion. Sure, nothing will
change. The University will still be com
pelled to accept military recruiters. It does
not have the power to reverse the "Don't
Ask, Don't Tell" policy. But that doesn't
mean that Stanford should not take a sym
bolic stand against discrimination.
We feel that the University administra
tion is sometimes slow to listen to student
protest because it doesn't always understand
that such action is a matter of principle. For
instance, consider the efforts of STAND to
urge the University to divest from compa
nies operating in Sudan. Few of us would be
lieve that Stanford could singlehandedly put
an end to the genocide in Darfur, but most of
us would agree that divestment is a step in
the right direction.
Indeed, it is our duty as a premier educa
tional institution to shape issues at the fore
front of public discourse, and pursue goals
and actions that will lead to the betterment
of society.
Perhaps we're all just naive. Maybe our
editorial, however well reasoned and well
argued, will never change the mind of those
in power. Maybe all of OUTLAW'S efforts
will not reverse the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell"
policy that the U.S. military has in place.

But maybe, just maybe, our voic
es can change the world. We call on
all queer and straight allies to pick
up T-shirts from a nearby communi
ty center and remain silent on
Thursday. We encourage all profes
sors and teaching assistants to be
supportive of students who choose
not to speak in class today. Maybe
on this Day of Silence, we too can
stand up and be counted.
