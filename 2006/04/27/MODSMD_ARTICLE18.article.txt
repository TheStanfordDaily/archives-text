# A 						modern day fairytale

I spend too much time on the computer.
Back when I had access to wireless, 1 con
fess I sometimes fell asleep spooning my
laptop. In an effort to reduce my incessant re
freshing of my inbox to a healthy amount, 1
checked my email on Saturday after almost
two days of restraint, only to find that basically
all hell had basted loose on campus. Highlights
from my inbox: George W. Bush visits campus!
Hummer blockades! Students Arrested!
I feel out of touch.
Now that we're in a period of independ
ent study, and not being bussed to school
every day, 1 have two options: walk half an
hour to an internet cafe where 1 will pay 20
rand an hour (which could buy six pounds of
apples or ten fast-food soft serve ice-cream
cones) or walk over an hour to use the excru
ciatingly slower-than-dialup computers on
campus that alternately refuse to let me
open either Webmail or Gmail.
Saturday I opted for the cafe and paid for
five hours of computer time, of which I
planned to use an hour. The man who took
my money neglected to inform me that 1
needed to tell the staff how much time 1
wanted to use. I was unable to do more than
skim the top news story of Friday's Daily,
looking for details of last week's anti-Bush
protest, before my baseline allotment of 15
minutes was up and one of the other vulture
like internet junkies waiting in the wings
dove in and took my spot.
It's hard to stay informed. Sometimes, life
is like a big game of telephone, or a scene out
of Don DeLillo's "White Noise."

Last week, I was in the kitchen when my
host mother told me the Xhosa news re
porter just announced that an American
singer had died in a car accident in South
Africa. When I came into the living room, a
news story about Alicia Keys doing some
thing charitable for South Africa was on;
naturally, I had no idea what the words ac
companying the images meant.
"Wow, that's so shocking," 1 said,"l can't
believe Alicia Keys died."
I got scandalized looks from my host
mother and brother.
"Alicia Keys wasn't killed.it was Ashanti."
The singer was in South Africa for a "Divas"
concert with other big-name songstresses.
I told everyone I saw the next day what my
mother told me: that Ashanti had been killed by
a 17 year old who had stolen his mother's car.
"Was he drunk?" I had asked my host
mother.
"No man," she had said, annoyed, think
ing I hadn't been listening, "he didn't know
how to drive."
That night was our farewell dinner; we
left our homestays the day after and moved
into town for the duration of our independ
ent research period. At the dinner, one of the
girls at a table full of non-believers, told me
to repeat what I had heard about Ashanti.
"She was killed in a car accident," I told
them. "My mama told me." They said they
didn't believe me; I insisted it was on the
news and must be true.
The next morning, before 1 left,
my host mother told me Ashanti
hadn't been killed. It was actually
her sister, shooting my credibility
all to hell.
When the van came to bring me
and my flatmates to town, 1 re-told
the whole story.
The driver turned to look at me.
"No man, not her sister, it was her
cousin. And the driver was drunk."
I'm usually more on top of cur
rent events, especially when I'm
away from home. When I was in
Oxford, and when 1 was working in
Honduras this fall, I made a point of
visiting The New York Times web
site every morning and reading
through all the articles on the front
page. Blame it on 9/11. 1 was four
blocks from the World Trade
Center when the towers fell; 1 like
to make sure America will still be
standing when 1 get back.
Access to The New York Times
especially gives me the warm fuzzies.
Nothing screams "home" to me like
sitting at the breakfast table with my
Dad, a cup of coffee and The Times.
Ironically, it's only at Stanford
that I'm unaware as to what's going
on in the big bad world. Stanford,
and now South Africa as well. I'm a
Times junkie, but not a very good
one. Now that The Times' Web site
has changed formats, 1 stopped
reading it. Plus, an accidental glance
at their side-bar of Associate Press
headlines a few months ago spoiled
who had been killed the night
before on "LOST." Someone else is
slated to die in May, so I'm not
reading The Times online until
June, when I'll have caught up on all
the island action I've missed (unless
my sister makes good on her threats
to erase all the episodes I forced
her toTiVo).
It's important to have one's pri
orities in order.
Besides, I'm not the only one
walking around in a fog of misinfor
mation. As one of my especially
earnest classmates asked me sever
al weeks ago, "Where do you get
your news? You're always so well
informed."

Like The Who's "Tommy,"from you,
Ilena gets the story. Keep her updated
at icgeorge@stanford.edu.
