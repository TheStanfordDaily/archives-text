# The 						absent president
## 
### 
The President wasted another two hours
of my life. As everyone on campus is
aware. President Bush bailed on his
meeting at the Hoover Institute last Friday af
ternoon. Whether because of the 1,000 pro
testors or his desire for a more private local to
check out George Shultz's notoriously placed
Princeton Tiger tattoo. Bush decided against
a public entrance to Hoover Tower and ru
ined my and many other students' afternoons.
But as my anger subsided Friday evening,
I realized 1 shouldn't be surprised that Bush
didn't show up. Hell. Bush barely shows up to
the presidency. The guy must spend less time
in D.C. than any other recent president. Let's
not forgot how long it took him to just fly
over New Orleans after Katrina on his way
back to D.C. from Crawford. National crisis?
Let's go mountain biking!
I also realized that this was just another
one in a long line of failed public appear
ances. As the Bush administration has re
cently proven, public appearances don't nec
essarily equal good publicity.
Iliis unexpected phenomenon flies in the
face of an established media politics theory
called "Going Public." In its essence, the the
ory suggests that a politician's political
power directly correlates to his or her public
approval rating. A high approval rating
grants a politician more bargaining power
because other politicians don't want to be on
the opposite side of a popular politician. With
a low approval rating, a politician has very lit
tle political bargaining power.
So. when a politician's, and especially the
president's, approval rating starts to slip,
there are certain tactics he typically uses to
rebuild his public standing. First, the presi
dent will typically begin making more pub
lic appearances. These appearances will be

as regulated as possible to make the presi
dent look good. Delivering speeches
around the country, appearing for staged
press conferences where all the questions
are planted and answers prepped in ad
vance and appearing with foreign diplo
mats are all methods presidents have uti
lized in the media age.
Over the past few months. Bush has pre
cisely followed this prescription in hopes of
boosting his sagging approval rating. He gave
speeches at various universities and econom
ic forums, as well as appearing alongside
President Hu Jintao of China.
And, most noticeably, he has given sever
al staged press conferences, hoping to show
the country that he embodies the strong,
trustworthy persona that has been the cor
nerstone of his political career.
The most recent, most emphatic and, well,
most entertaining of these press conferences
came last week in the wake of the Rummy
saga. CNN correspondent Ed Henry tossed
the president this high fastball over the mid
dle of the plate, "What would you say to crit
ics who believe that you're ignoring the ad
vice of retired generals and military com
manders who say there needs to be a
change?"
Bush wasted no time taking a huge swing.
"I hear the voices and I read the front page

and I know the speculation," he said,"But I'm
the decider, and I decide what's best."
Believe me, Mr. President, we don't doubt
that you're hearing voices, but maybe you
should read more than the front page.
What is so fascinating (and delightful)
about Bush is that the traditional approval
saving tactics just aren't working. He may
be the first president in a very long time
that only hurts his political standing when
he appears in public. A CNN poll on Mon
day had his approval rating at 32 percent. 32
percent!
I can understand it's a challenging situa
tion for this administration — how do we
show Bush to be a strong, intelligent and hon
est leader when we can't let him set foot in
public or in front of a camera?
To make matters even worse. Bush's bum
bling ways are causing nearly half the coun
try to doubt his ability to make important de
cisions. In the same CNN poll, only 47 per
cent of respondents answered that Bush is
"competent," while another 47 percent an
swered that he isn't.
The solution, however, is simple: make the
right decisions. Had Bush and his cronies lis
tened to the generals and paid attention in in
telligence briefings, he would not be experi
encing this black hole of approval ratings.
Simply put. the country would be better off
across the board. It seems that finally the
public is holding The Decider (does that
come with tights and a cape?) accountable
for his decisions and questioning whether he
is even competent to make them. And no
number of staged press conferences or ap
pearances at liberal universities is going to
change that.
