## Students Take Back the Night Annual march to combat fears to take place all over campus tonight 
### ELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
Female Students and community members alike
often feel anxious walking around the Stanford campus
late at night. Tonight's annual Take Back the Night
march aims to combat this fear by inviting the commu
nity to "reclaim our rights to be safe," according to
March Coordinator Stephanie Nguyen, a senior.
"Take Back the Night is an annual march held across
the country and internationally in protest to violence
against women, particularly at night," Nguyen said.
The first Take Back the Night march in the United
States was held in San Francisco in 1978. Stanford has
participated for the past 15 years.
The event will commence at 8:30 p.m. An opening
ceremony at White Plaza will feature a performance by
Talisman as well as community speakers such as Joanne
Sanders from the Office for Religious Life, Sally Baird
from Vaden Health Promotion Services' Sexual Assault
Prevention Program and representatives from the
YWCA Sexual Assault Center at Stanford.
Participants will then march through White Plaza,
down the Row, and around Lake Lagunita.
"[The lake is] one place I definitely would avoid if 1
were walking on my own," said Mary Anion, a sopho
more who participated in last year's march. "To me, this
march symbolizes our group's ability not to be afraid of
anything or anyone, no matter how dark or menacing
the situation would be to an individual."
The route, determined by students on the Take Back
the Night planning committee, will end at Memorial
Church, where a reception will be held until 10:30 p.m.
Coordinators have been planning the march since
the end of winter quarter.
The event was organized by Vaden Health Promo
tion Services, but theTake Back the Night planning com
mittee represents a variety of student groups, including
the peer health educators (PHEs), the Interfraternity
Council (IFC), the Intersorority Council (ISC), the
Sigma Psi Zeta sorority and the Women's Center.
Student Services Specialist Kate Bedford spoke
about the PHEs' role in helping to organize and publi
cize the event.
"PHEs as a group are very committed to ending sex
ual assault," she said.
IFC Community Service Chairs John Lee and Josh
Zloof have encouraged all fraternities on campus to par
ticipate. Lee noted that "many of the fraternities are ex
pecting a large turnout from their members."
According to Nguyen, 50 to 200 students and staff
have participated each year at Stanford.
"We arc hoping for a similar turnout this year," she said.
"This night offers the exciting opportunity to take a
stand against this violence and be a part of a community
of individuals who share this desire to end violence
against women," Nguyen added.
Amon encouraged other students to join the march.
"It reaches out to anyone who has ever felt uneasy
about walking by themselves at night," she said. "It lets
them know that there are other people who feel the
same way and, for once, won't let them walk alone."
Nguyen, who has participated in past years,called the
event "extremely powerful" and "empowering."
Amon said she shared this feeling of empowerment
while participating last year.
"We all reflect that the night is an opportunity for
bad things to happen," she said."But on this night, we
don't let that happen."
"Stanford is lucky because we have a community that
is committed to ending violence against women," Bed
ford said. "This is a chance for that community to show
its strength."
