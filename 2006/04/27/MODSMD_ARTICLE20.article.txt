## Support the Day of Silence 
### MARGO WATSON 
For the past 10 years students across the nation have
participated in the National Day of Silence. Partic
ipants take an oath of silence for the day to protest
the silencing of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and
queer people and their allies.
This will be my fourth year participating in the Day of
Silence. I have often been asked how staying silent will
change anything â€” if I am attempting to end the silence,
shouldn't I be screaming all day in protest? But for me the
Day of Silence is a time of action and of contemplation.
Every time a friend or teacher tries to talk to me and I re
spond by handing them a card explaining my protest, they
arc reminded of the silencing of the LGBTQ community.
Every time 1 want to speak, but can't, I take the time to re
flect on the silencing of my LGBTQ peers, and what ac
tions I will take to end that silence. The silence we are
protesting is hard to detect, and unless one experiences the
silence personally, it often slips by unnoticed. Even though
I am open about my identity as a queer woman, I still ex
perience the silence felt by the entire queer community.

But how are we silenced? After all, it has been almost 37
years since the Stonewall riots, and many people feel com
fortable talking openly about their sexual orientation. So
what are we protesting? We are silenced when we tell rela
tives, "No, I'm not seeing anybody" because mentioning
our same-sex relationship would disturb the family re
union. We are silenced when our language teacher corrects
us, joking that we "accidentally" said we would marry
someone of the same sex. Our straight peers are silenced,
thinking they don't know any LGBTQ people, because we
are too afraid to make our sexual identities known. We are
silenced when publicly holding hands with a loved one is
not safe. We are silenced when job applications are modi
fied so we can be accepted in the heterosexual world. We
are silenced when the homosexuality of historical figures
such as Aristotle, Oscar Wilde and Eleanor Roosevelt is ed
ited out of history textbooks. We are silenced when the chil
dren of LGBTQ parents are told they grew up in an unsta
ble household. We are silenced when LGBTQ people
around the world are murdered, forever silenced by hate.
