# The 						real racial problems

### TIMNIT GEBRU 
1 rarely see anything in The Daily about racial issues
and the first time in recent memory that I did was the
newspaper's initial editorial on the SOCC. The fol
low-up piece,"Revisiting the SOCC controversy" (April
24), claims that the Editorial Board "chose to publish a
piece that was provocative. In doing so, our intent was to
generate discourse on campus in whatever way possible,
including letters to the Editor."
What is problematic is that the Board chose this partic
ular "issue" to spark the racial discourse. Many of us "un
derrepresented minorities" agree that there is a lack of
racial discourse at Stanford, and sometimes we even avoid
talking about it with non-minorities because they seem to
be uneasy when this topic comes up. However, for us this
is not merely a topic or opinion or discourse, but our life.
If the Board chose "the SOCC controversy" to spark
a racial discussion, I have to assume that its members nei
ther know nor understand (or just do not care about) the
magnitude and seriousness of the racial problems in this
country and on this campus. I'm sure they would be sur

prised that my roommate's sister, in all seriousness, asked
her if I got into Stanford because of "affirmative action"
or because I'm "actually smart" — or maybe the Board
would ask the same question. What about professors who
say things like,"You Africans know what its like to expe
rience hardship. African Americans are spoiled, they
complain so much about their conditions here."
Many whites and Asians I have talked to think that
these people don't exist or are in the minority on campus.
Most of the underrepresented minorities, however, know
better because we have experienced these sorts of inci
dents far too many times. What about people shouting
"white power" and "kill those niggers" at Flicks during
"King Kong?"
Thinking more broadly, what about the fact that black
and Hispanic males constitute 65 percent of all prisoners
or that one in 10 black males between the ages of 25 and
29 is in prison (compared to one in 100 for white males in
the same age group). Nobody even mentions the plight of
the Native Americans who are shoved in reservations.
These statistics are not hidden —
they are published by the United
States government. Are these not
considered issues? Are people
unaware of them? Or do they just
not care?
According to the Editorial
Board, there are many white stu
dents who care enough about diver
sity and racial issues to represent
minorities in the decision-making
process. The Board claims that white
students did not apply to be SOCC
candidates because "based on sever
al of their responses, it is clear that
the SOCC did not inform all candi

dates about their procedure."
The piece concludes that white
students did not apply because
SOCC's process was deliberately
made non-transparent to those stu
dents. But the more obvious conclu
sion, especially given The Daily's
editorial, is that most whites and
Asians do not know or do not care
about the extent to which racism
exists and what condition underrep
resented minorities live in. If aware,
the white candidates would have
taken the time to research SOCC's
process, and The Daily would not
have highlighted SOCC as an out
standing example of a racial issue on
campus.
