## Walt pulls no punches [The old stadium] was really more of a home-field disadvantage. It was so quiet out there because we'd fallen off. WALT HARRIS, football coach 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
The Stanford Daily figit red who better to preview Saturday's
spring game than head football coach Walt Harris? We ran the first
half of the interview yesterday, and in today's final half, Coach Harris
discusses everything from the new stadium to coaching philosophy.
The Stanford Daily: On offense, the o-line was an issue. How do
you feel like they're coming along this spring?
Walt Harris: Well, we have 83 starts in the offensive line back.
That's the good news and that's the bad news. I think a lot of
those kids played before they were really ready to play, and 1
think that they created a lot of bad habits.
Last year, we lost a center, Brian Head, to injury, so we ended
up playing two redshirt freshmen [Allen Smith and Alex Fletch
er] in the offensive line. That's the good news and the bad news
too because they'll be back, but they're really inexperienced.
And experience in the offensive line is most important at any po
sition in football other than quarterback. So being young there
was tough on us last year and now that they're sophomores —
and they'll have the opportunity to get back into the starting
lineup — hopefully we'll have improved play from those guys.

But we have two coaches for five guys, so those guys have to
do a good job of responding to what we're asking them to do and
become much better technicians. When that happens, we'll have
an improved run game and improved pass protection.
TSD: You feel it's the technical stuff that's holding them back?
WH: No, I think it's athletically. We're not very big and we're not
real athletic. So you have to be a better technician to survive.
TSD: A lot of people look at who's returning on offense and
think TVent Edwards could have a huge breakout year. What
does he bring to the table in terms of what he does better than a
lot of other quarterbacks?
WH: I think he has a really good arm and gets rid of the ball
quick. He's smart, and he learns well what we're trying to do.
He's extremely accurate and he really can get away — he's quick
and fast. He can explode out of the pocket and he's had some
good gains for us running.

We just have to do a lot better job around him in terms of pro
tecting him, route running, getting open, staying healthy, calling
plays (points to self] and then he's got to be a more high-percentage
football player and feel the rush a little better. He's working hard in
some areas of his game to upgrade his play but as long as he makes
good decisions, he should be a real fine player for us. if we're healthy.
TSD: Last year it seemed the coaching was conservative at times. 1
don't say that as a bad thing or as a good thing — you set a record for
going three games without a turnover. Is that a design to maximize
the talent you have and give yourselves the best shot at winning?
YVH: Of course. You know, we were picked ninth in the confer
ence, and the only reason we were probably picked ninth is that
we didn't play the 1 Oth place team they picked, Washington. And
we finished the Pac-1() fourth. So I would say that was probably

Usually quite sparing in his compliments, Walt Harris had nothing but praise for rising senior quarterback Trent Edwards: "I think
he has a really good arm and gets rid of the ball quick. ... He's extremely accurate and he really can get away."
