## Walt pulls no punches [The old stadium] was really more of a home-field disadvantage. It was so quiet out there because we'd fallen off. WALT HARRIS, football coach 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
The Stanford Daily figit red who better to preview Saturday's
spring game than head football coach Walt Harris? We ran the first
half of the interview yesterday, and in today's final half, Coach Harris
discusses everything from the new stadium to coaching philosophy.
The Stanford Daily: On offense, the o-line was an issue. How do
you feel like they're coming along this spring?
Walt Harris: Well, we have 83 starts in the offensive line back.
That's the good news and that's the bad news. I think a lot of
those kids played before they were really ready to play, and 1
think that they created a lot of bad habits.
Last year, we lost a center, Brian Head, to injury, so we ended
up playing two redshirt freshmen [Allen Smith and Alex Fletch
er] in the offensive line. That's the good news and the bad news
too because they'll be back, but they're really inexperienced.
And experience in the offensive line is most important at any po
sition in football other than quarterback. So being young there
was tough on us last year and now that they're sophomores —
and they'll have the opportunity to get back into the starting
lineup — hopefully we'll have improved play from those guys.

But we have two coaches for five guys, so those guys have to
do a good job of responding to what we're asking them to do and
become much better technicians. When that happens, we'll have
an improved run game and improved pass protection.
TSD: You feel it's the technical stuff that's holding them back?
WH: No, I think it's athletically. We're not very big and we're not
real athletic. So you have to be a better technician to survive.
TSD: A lot of people look at who's returning on offense and
think TVent Edwards could have a huge breakout year. What
does he bring to the table in terms of what he does better than a
lot of other quarterbacks?
WH: I think he has a really good arm and gets rid of the ball
quick. He's smart, and he learns well what we're trying to do.
He's extremely accurate and he really can get away — he's quick
and fast. He can explode out of the pocket and he's had some
good gains for us running.

We just have to do a lot better job around him in terms of pro
tecting him, route running, getting open, staying healthy, calling
plays (points to self] and then he's got to be a more high-percentage
football player and feel the rush a little better. He's working hard in
some areas of his game to upgrade his play but as long as he makes
good decisions, he should be a real fine player for us. if we're healthy.
TSD: Last year it seemed the coaching was conservative at times. 1
don't say that as a bad thing or as a good thing — you set a record for
going three games without a turnover. Is that a design to maximize
the talent you have and give yourselves the best shot at winning?
YVH: Of course. You know, we were picked ninth in the confer
ence, and the only reason we were probably picked ninth is that
we didn't play the 1 Oth place team they picked, Washington. And
we finished the Pac-1() fourth. So I would say that was probably

a pretty successful year in the Pac-10.
Now we didn't win enough games,
and I'm not going to make excuses,
and I'm not going to say we're satis
fied, but good coaching is taking the
talent that you have and trying to
make the best of it. So the prognosti
cated the experts, picked us ninth
and we ended up fourth. I think we
proved that whatever style we used
was productive.
TSD: Do you expect more of the
same this year then, or do you think
with so many guys back on offense
you're going to let it go a little bit?
WH: I think every game we try to let
it go. It may not look like it to an ob
server, but that has to do with the ex
ecution. You can call bombs or you
can call deep passing routes, but if you
can't get the ball off, then it doesn't
look like you're executing. So you
have to do what the players allow
yourself to do.
TSD: How do you think the new sta
dium is going to help the program?
WH: First of all, I think it shows a
good commitment to wanting to be
good in football, because that's a lot
of money and it's going to be a beau
tiful place. I think it also should add to
the excitement of going to a game and

give going to a Stanford football
game a shot in the arm to the people
who go or are thinking about going.
You know, we did not have a
home-field advantage. It was really
more of a home-field disadvantage
because it is so quiet out there and
that's because of such a big stadium
and that we'd fallen off. I'm not blam
ing anybody for the crowds — that's
because Stanford football hasn't
been good enough. I was here in '75
and that place was sold out, so it's on
us, it's not on anybody else.
TSD: As far as this spring, how are
practices going? Are any guys per
forming really well?
WH: Our practices have gone solidly.
We're trying to get a lot of young guys
ready to play. We have some young
guys on defense who we're trying to get
into the lineup, and then we have some
younger offensive guys and we're try
ing to find out what they can do. We
redshirted every freshman on our
team last year,so we're trying to assim
ilate those guys into our schemes on of
fense and defense and special teams.
I don't think anybody has been real
ly spectacular yet. like Whoa, that guy's
unbelievable.' We've just had competi
tive play and scrimmages. Sometimes
the defense will do better than the of
fense and sometimes the offense will do
better. That's the way it normally goes.
My big focus is that we work hard and
get better in our fundamentals, our
technique, and that we stay healthy.

The Stanford Daily figit red who better to preview Saturday's
spring game than head football coach Walt Harris? We ran the first
half of the interview yesterday, and in today's final half, Coach Harris
discusses everything from the new stadium to coaching philosophy.
The Stanford Daily: On offense, the o-line was an issue. How do
you feel like they're coming along this spring?
Walt Harris: Well, we have 83 starts in the offensive line back.
That's the good news and that's the bad news. I think a lot of
those kids played before they were really ready to play, and 1
think that they created a lot of bad habits.
Last year, we lost a center, Brian Head, to injury, so we ended
up playing two redshirt freshmen [Allen Smith and Alex Fletch
er] in the offensive line. That's the good news and the bad news
too because they'll be back, but they're really inexperienced.
And experience in the offensive line is most important at any po
sition in football other than quarterback. So being young there
was tough on us last year and now that they're sophomores —
and they'll have the opportunity to get back into the starting
lineup — hopefully we'll have improved play from those guys.

But we have two coaches for five guys, so those guys have to
do a good job of responding to what we're asking them to do and
become much better technicians. When that happens, we'll have
an improved run game and improved pass protection.
TSD: You feel it's the technical stuff that's holding them back?
WH: No, I think it's athletically. We're not very big and we're not
real athletic. So you have to be a better technician to survive.
TSD: A lot of people look at who's returning on offense and
think TVent Edwards could have a huge breakout year. What
does he bring to the table in terms of what he does better than a
lot of other quarterbacks?
WH: I think he has a really good arm and gets rid of the ball
quick. He's smart, and he learns well what we're trying to do.
He's extremely accurate and he really can get away — he's quick
and fast. He can explode out of the pocket and he's had some
good gains for us running.

We just have to do a lot better job around him in terms of pro
tecting him, route running, getting open, staying healthy, calling
plays (points to self] and then he's got to be a more high-percentage
football player and feel the rush a little better. He's working hard in
some areas of his game to upgrade his play but as long as he makes
good decisions, he should be a real fine player for us. if we're healthy.
TSD: Last year it seemed the coaching was conservative at times. 1
don't say that as a bad thing or as a good thing — you set a record for
going three games without a turnover. Is that a design to maximize
the talent you have and give yourselves the best shot at winning?
YVH: Of course. You know, we were picked ninth in the confer
ence, and the only reason we were probably picked ninth is that
we didn't play the 1 Oth place team they picked, Washington. And
we finished the Pac-1() fourth. So I would say that was probably

Usually quite sparing in his compliments, Walt Harris had nothing but praise for rising senior quarterback Trent Edwards: "I think
he has a really good arm and gets rid of the ball quick. ... He's extremely accurate and he really can get away."
a pretty successful year in the Pac-10.
Now we didn't win enough games,
and I'm not going to make excuses,
and I'm not going to say we're satis
fied, but good coaching is taking the
talent that you have and trying to
make the best of it. So the prognosti
cated the experts, picked us ninth
and we ended up fourth. I think we
proved that whatever style we used
was productive.
TSD: Do you expect more of the
same this year then, or do you think
with so many guys back on offense
you're going to let it go a little bit?
WH: I think every game we try to let
it go. It may not look like it to an ob
server, but that has to do with the ex
ecution. You can call bombs or you
can call deep passing routes, but if you
can't get the ball off, then it doesn't
look like you're executing. So you
have to do what the players allow
yourself to do.
TSD: How do you think the new sta
dium is going to help the program?
WH: First of all, I think it shows a
good commitment to wanting to be
good in football, because that's a lot
of money and it's going to be a beau
tiful place. I think it also should add to
the excitement of going to a game and

give going to a Stanford football
game a shot in the arm to the people
who go or are thinking about going.
You know, we did not have a
home-field advantage. It was really
more of a home-field disadvantage
because it is so quiet out there and
that's because of such a big stadium
and that we'd fallen off. I'm not blam
ing anybody for the crowds — that's
because Stanford football hasn't
been good enough. I was here in '75
and that place was sold out, so it's on
us, it's not on anybody else.
TSD: As far as this spring, how are
practices going? Are any guys per
forming really well?
WH: Our practices have gone solidly.
We're trying to get a lot of young guys
ready to play. We have some young
guys on defense who we're trying to get
into the lineup, and then we have some
younger offensive guys and we're try
ing to find out what they can do. We
redshirted every freshman on our
team last year,so we're trying to assim
ilate those guys into our schemes on of
fense and defense and special teams.
I don't think anybody has been real
ly spectacular yet. like Whoa, that guy's
unbelievable.' We've just had competi
tive play and scrimmages. Sometimes
the defense will do better than the of
fense and sometimes the offense will do
better. That's the way it normally goes.
My big focus is that we work hard and
get better in our fundamentals, our
technique, and that we stay healthy.
