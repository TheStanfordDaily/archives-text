### BY CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Now that it has brought home its share
of the Pac-10 team title, the Stanford
men's tennis team looks to bring home its
share of individual accolades from the
Pac-10 individual tournament. The Cardi
nal (15-3,6-1 Pac-10) travel to Ojai, Calif,
to compete in the 106 th Ojai Valley Tour
nament, held today through Sunday.
Last Saturday, No. 14 Stanford sealed
its share of the conference title by defeat
ing No. 23 California, 5-2. The Cardinal
split the crown with UCLA (17-5. 6-1),
who also went 6-1 in Pac-10 play this sea
son, losing only to Washington.
"We're co-Pac-10 champions and
that's a major accomplishment for this
team," head coach John Whitlinger said.
"I'm very proud of the guys for it."
The main singles draw for this week
end's tournament consists of 32 of the top
players from the Pac-10 schools, while 16
pairs will compete in the doubles draw.
Eight schools send four of their top play
ers and two of their top doubles teams to
compete in this historic tournament. Play
begins today with some first-round sin
gles matches starting at 8 a.m., and the

main draw of doubles is slated to begin to
morrow morning.
"I really like where we're at right
now," Whitlinger said before the team left
for the tournament."We're really looking
forward to playing Ojai. It's a big tourna
mentâ€” the Pac-10 individual champi
onships. If you look at the names on the
trophy, they're all very impressive."
Last year, Stanford brought home both
the Pac-10 singles and doubles crowns.
Alum Sam Warburg defended the singles
title, and then teamed up with senior KC
Corkery to claim victory in the finals of
the doubles draw only a few hours later.
Juniors James Pacle and James Wan,
freshman Matt Bruch and No. 22 Corkery
will be competing in singles main draw ac
tion this weekend. Bruch is the top
ranked freshman in the nation, checking
in at No. 17.
Bruch will be hitting the court against
California's Daniel Sebescan at 8 a.m.
today in the first round of play. The next
Stanford match to go on-court will be
Wan's at 9:30 a.m.The junior faces South
ern California's Chong Wang.
Pade is scheduled to take on Oregon's
Thomas Bieri at 11 a.m. Pade defeated
Bieri in straight sets, 6-2,6-2. at the begin

ning of April. Finally, Corkery will face
off against California's Lennart Maack
this afternoon. Maack most recently gave
up a 6-2,6-3 defeat to Pade in Stanford's
win over the Golden Bears on Saturday.
Other players to keep an eye out for
include No. 4 Conor Niland from Cal. Ni
land was undefeated (19-0) until yester
day, dropping his only match of the season
to Washington's No. 53 Alex Slovic, 5-7,1 -
6. UCLA's Benjamin Kohlloeffel is the
top-ranked player in the nation but is only
entered in the doubles draw.
Corkery and Pade will also team up for
doubles action starting tomorrow, while
Bruch will enter his first Pac-10 doubles
draw with freshman Blake Muller. The
older duo were ranked 15th in the most
recent ITA poll, and face Arizona's Bruno
Alcala and Peter Zimmer in the opening
round of play.
Corkery and Pade advanced and lost
in the finals of the tournament their fresh
man and sophomore years. While Pade
redshirted last year, Corkery claimed the
title with Warburg. However, the senior
captain and Pade still have unfinished
business to take care of in Ojai, as the duo
