# THROUGH MY EYES
## Sophomore duo: Two become one Jenna Scalmanini, Megan Nesland team up to talk with The Daily 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
They may not be the ones scoring game-winning
goals or making thrilling saves in the clutch, but the
Cardinal s dynamic duo of sophomores Jenna Scal
manini and Megan Nesland contribute just as much
to the women's water polo team as any member of the
squad. With a contagious propensity for hysterical
laughter and an uncanny ability to finish up each
other's jokes, anecdotes and comments, Scalmanini
and Nesland reflected upon a number of topics —
from memorable Stanford experiences to the indivis
ible unit they have become to the greatest flaws they
see in one another.
On being identified — often inexplicably — as a
pair, and on their joint nickname as "The Twins"
JS:It happens a lot. There's really only one person,
and her name is Jenna Nesland. I'll walk into a room
and people will just say, "Hey Nesland, come here,"
and they don't recognize it until I correct it. But it's
funny because whenever our coaches talk to us, it's al
ways, "Jenna, Nesland come here! Jenna, Nesland go
in! Jenna, Nesland do this..."
MN:I guess the cat may be out of the bag now. I think
we've somehow actually convinced a lot of people that
we are twins — twins with different last names who grew
up in different places but were just separated at birth. I
think [the joke] just evolved somehow,so we just ran with
it and started telling other people who bought it."
On a recurring problem of bike misplacement
MN:So last year, we were at a team meeting at Mir
rielees in Hannah [Luber], Kelty [Luber] and Scotti
[Shafer]'s room. I parked my bike.and since it was my
first time meeting any of them, I was trying to make
friends since I didn't really know anybody on the
team yet. Well, we all got up to leave after watching a
movie, and we walked outside and I was like, "Oh my

God, my bike is gone! Someone stole my bike! School
hasn't even started yet and my bike is gone!
JS:She was like freaking out, saying "I can't believe
someone stole my bike on like, the first night when
school hasn't even started! 1 can't believe someone
would do this, this is so bad!
MN:But the moral of the story is that I didn't lose my
bike. I had just parked it at a different entrance and
came out a different way.
JS:So then I rode my bike around all of Mirrielees,
and when I found Nesland's bike, all she could say
was,"Oh... oh. Okay. Thanks." 1 thought it was just re
ally funny — especially because this year it sort of
happened again. It was Big Game weekend, and Nes
land comes home and says, "Cal stole my bike! They
must have taken it because it's red —just to steal it."
Then [teammate] Nancy [El-Sakkary] called and
says, "Megan, I found your bike! It was outside my
dorm. They left it outside of Kimball!" And Megan
goes, "Oh yeah... oh, 1 left it there — that's where I
parked it on Friday night!"
MN:I mean, I'm not a naturally suspicious person. It's
just that I have a really cool bike, and I always think
people want to take it. I just really love my bike.
On what role they strive to fill on this year's team
JS:We're good cheerers. We try to make sure that
everyone is as excited as they can be about the little
things, and that everyone's excited to go in and play
well.
MN:Yeah, both of us want to support our teammates
and make sure everyone's ready for the games, ready
for the practices, and maintaining an upbeat atmos
phere.
On the greatest weakness or flaw that
each one sees in the other
MN:I have one for Jenna — every time you try to go
anywhere with her, you can't because she talks to
everyone and talks forever. She's too friendly.
JS: "I'd say Megan's [problem] is that she's too excited
to play. So she plays with broken limbs — like fingers
and torn shoulders. It's awesome, but she's going to end
