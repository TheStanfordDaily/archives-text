# Best sports weekend of the year
## 
### 
Fear not,sports fans. Because the
most glorious weekend of the
year is upon us.
I guess you could watch playoff
basketball if you're so inclined, but
there's no real drama there, at least
not yet. And it's true that baseball is
finally in full swing, but you've got
roughly another 150 games to go, so
what are you really missing if you
skip a weekend of the national pas
time?
And of course there's playoff
hockey on the air, too. Strange how I
always come so close to forgetting
that.
But no, if you're a true sports nerd
like me, you know that this weekend
is the most entertaining of the NFL
year. Bigger than the Super Bowl for
fans of 30 teams around the league.
Bigger than the opening weekend
when roughly 12 teams a year know
deep down that their season is over
even before it starts.
The NFL draft transcends all that
because it matters for every team.
Great franchises are built through
the draft these days, and have been
for almost all of the modern era of
the NFL.
Yet there's still debate over how
large a place the draft holds in the
sports landscape. Some pundits
would have you believe that because
there are relatively few immediate
impact players taken each year, the
draft doesn't really matter.
A narrower viewpoint would be
hard to find. Aside from the major
roles played by a small number of
rookies in the NFL each year is the
fact that the rookies of today are the
stars of tomorrow. If those players
taken in the draft are worthless and
not worth following, where do all
those proven veterans who are worth
watching come from?
Moreover, I know of no better
way to learn more about the game of
football than by following the draft.
Teams can say anything they want
about the talent they have. The most
honest of them will avoid giving
straight answers, and the least will lie
through their teeth.
But when a team is on the clock,
they have to tell you what they really
think. Based on whom a team selects,
you can tell how they value the play
ers they have, the players that are
available and the kind of team
they're trying to build.

The Turnaround
For these reasons and more, I'll be
watching this weekend as the future
of the league is decided in 15-minute
increments, then 10, then five. And
this year should he more entertaining
than most.
You've got Tagliabue calling out
picks for the last time. You've got the
most unsettled top-five picks in re
cent memory, with college stars like
Reggie Bush, Matt Leinart and Vince
Young all possible picks in the top
five, but only Bush being a virtual
lock there. Speculation abounds that
because of this, there could be plenty
of trades near the top of the first
round this year.
Then there are all the new coaches
â€” a stunning 10 teams will have
someone different at the helm when
the season opens. Many will be look
ing to install new offensive or defen
sive schemes (sometimes both), and

how well they do in the draft could ei
ther propel them to success in the
near future or precipitate further
coaching changes in a few years.
Because make no mistake, more
coaches and personnel execs get fired
because of draft-day mistakes than
for any other reason. For fans, there's
no worse fear than their team draft
ing the next Ryan Lcaf,Akili Smith or
Tim Couch. And trust me. coaches
fear exactly the same thing.
So who's going to be proven right
and who's going to get fired in a few
years for their decisions? Well. I'll
probably have those opinions for you
next week. But the last great thing
about the draft is that we might not
know for certain until three years
have passed and rookies have had the
chance to become solid veterans,
leaving endless room for opinion and
debate in the meantime.
And that's the kind of environ
ment that columnists who don't have
much to say can thrive in.
