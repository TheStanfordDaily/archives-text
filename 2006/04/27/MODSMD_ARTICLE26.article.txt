# Best sports weekend of the year
## 
### 
Fear not,sports fans. Because the
most glorious weekend of the
year is upon us.
I guess you could watch playoff
basketball if you're so inclined, but
there's no real drama there, at least
not yet. And it's true that baseball is
finally in full swing, but you've got
roughly another 150 games to go, so
what are you really missing if you
skip a weekend of the national pas
time?
And of course there's playoff
hockey on the air, too. Strange how I
always come so close to forgetting
that.
But no, if you're a true sports nerd
like me, you know that this weekend
is the most entertaining of the NFL
year. Bigger than the Super Bowl for
fans of 30 teams around the league.
Bigger than the opening weekend
when roughly 12 teams a year know
deep down that their season is over
even before it starts.
The NFL draft transcends all that
because it matters for every team.
Great franchises are built through
the draft these days, and have been
for almost all of the modern era of
the NFL.
Yet there's still debate over how
large a place the draft holds in the
sports landscape. Some pundits
would have you believe that because
there are relatively few immediate
impact players taken each year, the
draft doesn't really matter.
A narrower viewpoint would be
hard to find. Aside from the major
roles played by a small number of
rookies in the NFL each year is the
fact that the rookies of today are the
stars of tomorrow. If those players
taken in the draft are worthless and
not worth following, where do all
those proven veterans who are worth
watching come from?
Moreover, I know of no better
way to learn more about the game of
football than by following the draft.
Teams can say anything they want
about the talent they have. The most
honest of them will avoid giving
straight answers, and the least will lie
through their teeth.
But when a team is on the clock,
they have to tell you what they really
think. Based on whom a team selects,
you can tell how they value the play
ers they have, the players that are
available and the kind of team
they're trying to build.
