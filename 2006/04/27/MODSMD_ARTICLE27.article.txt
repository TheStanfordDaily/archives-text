A century's rivalry and 16 years of waiting come down
to six minutes or less this Saturday, when the No. 2 Stan
ford heavyweights face the No. 3 oarsmen of California on
the narrow course at Redwood Shores. The frenzy sur

Copley Cup in Mission Bay, San Diego on April 2.That loss

"We are hoping to assert our dominance again this

however, both schools' squads have not yet been beaten.
