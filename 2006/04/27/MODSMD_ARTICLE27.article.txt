## No. 2 Card pulling to win Big Row Stanford will face No. 3 California; both crews are undefeated in dual races 
### JOHN CHOCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A century's rivalry and 16 years of waiting come down
to six minutes or less this Saturday, when the No. 2 Stan
ford heavyweights face the No. 3 oarsmen of California on
the narrow course at Redwood Shores. The frenzy sur
rounding the contest for the Schwabacher Cup, which in
any other year is just a highly-anticipated do-or-die grudge
match, has reached a new plane of excitement in an his
toric 2006 season.
"This year's Big Row will be extremely unique in that it
pits the No. 2 team against the No. 3, with huge implica
tions for the national title aspirations of each crew," junior
coxswain Alex Garcia said. "Both crews enter this race un
defeated in dual racing and at the end of the day, one of us
won't be."
No Big Row in history has featured two of the nation's
top three boats. Rarely have the teams been so closely
matched, and not in recent memory have the Cardinal held
the upper hand. Though both crews have yet to lose in a
two-boat Henley-style race this season, Stanford upset
then-No. 2 California in the six-boat grand final of the
Copley Cup in Mission Bay, San Diego on April 2.That loss
remains the only burr on the Bears' pelt — a thorn they'd
like to swat away this weekend.
"[Cal] has trained exceptionally hard in response to
San Diego, and their aggression is focused toward us be
cause we handed them that loss," senior captain Jake Cor
nelius said. "What they fail to realize, however, is that
while they have viewed us as the target for four weeks, we
have had them in our sights for four years."
"We are hoping to assert our dominance again this
weekend, and make it more difficult for them to gain
hope that they can beat us in the championship stage of
the year," continued Cornelius , whose crew could en-

counter Cal twice more at the Pac
-10 and national regattas. "We are
poised to deliver a blow to Califor
nia crew this weekend from which
they cannot recover."
The Cardinal have grown faster
and smarter in every race this sea
son.
"What's really great about this
crew is how through every piece we
do and every race we do, we just get
cleaner and better," junior Donny
Simkin said. "We've had all sorts of
different conditions that we've
raced in and all sorts of different
kinds of situations, against all sorts
of different crews, and it's a lot of
learning that's been going on."
Garcia agreed.
"The only thing that is different
from that race at Mission Bay is that
we're sharper, cleaner and faster."
Sharp and clean strokes are sig
natures of the varsity eight, whose
shark-smooth style stands in stark
contrast to the California eight's
habit of jumping and surging as they
muscle and bob down a course.
Stanford also stands apart from
the crowd in their rakish brand-new
banana-yellow skiff. The German
made Empacher boat arrived five

weeks ago, measuring 60 feet from
prow to stern and tipping the scales
at 38,000 American dollars.The tow
headed tub has a Kevlar hull, and is
starting to look like she's not just
bulletproof but impassable to all
crews.
But it's not the raft that wins the
race, insists head coach Craig
Amerkhanian.
"It's all about these guys," said
Amerkhanian, whose varsity eight
includes five walk-ons. Stanford's
men's rowing team has just 1.5
scholarships to California's 12, a dis
crepancy permissible in a sport not
regulated by the NCAA.
"Where the playing field is un
even and skewed in favor of long
time endowed programs like Cal
and Washington, the success of
the Stanford men is nothing short
of inspirational," Amerkhanian
said.
One measure of that success will
come this weekend, when the varsi
ty eight attempt to do what only 18
Stanford crews since 1902 have
done — bring the Big Row's
Schwabacher trophy back to the
Farm. Stanford last won the cup in
1990.
The Card of 2006 await that op
portunity.
"It's going to be a great race,"
Garcia said. "It's Cal. it's Stanford.
This is the rivalry I dreamed of when
I came here."
