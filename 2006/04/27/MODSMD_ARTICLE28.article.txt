# WOMEN'S LACROSSE
## Season ends this weekend 
### ROHAN PURANIK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a nail-biting 13-12 victor)'
over the Loyola Greyhounds this
past weekend, the women's lacrosse
squad is looking forward to visits to
No. 10 Cornell University and the
University of Connecticut.
"They are always tough competi
tion," Piselli said. "We beat them last
year so I see no reason as to why we
couldn't beat them again this year."
The squad is two games away from
finishing the regular season. Piselli
commented that the season has been
successful, though the team hasn't yet
achieved at the level it would like.
"The team has been really able to
capitalize well on some key mental
battles," Piselli said."But, I still think
that there is a lot of untapped poten
tial. I think the untapped potential is
really our chemistry on the field."
The squad suffered a heartbreak
ing 8-7 defeat to UConn last year. The
Huskies edged in a goal with less than
two minutes to go, giving them a two
goal lead.The Cardinal (8-5,4-1) were
unable to reclaim the deficit, though
2005 senior midfielder Nina Pantano
scored the final goal of the match at
1:54.
The Cardinal managed to defeat
Cornell 8-4 last year, with two goals
each from current sophomores
Megan McClain. a midfield/attack.
and Daphne Patterson, an attack.
Stanford managed two solid four

goal runs in each half. Sophomore
goalie Laura Shane made 10 stops, al
lowing the squad to maintain the
solid lead throughout the match.
Six seniors on the squad are grad
uating. Defense Kinsey Morrison, de
fense Thea Lorentzen, goalkeeper
Kate Horowitz, midfield Nyerr
Parham, attack Megan Burker and
attack Sarah Bach are all leaving the
team at the end of this year.
"(Bach and Burker] are key goal
scorers, and for that they will be
missed," Piselli said. "But 1 think that
there are a lot of younger players who
will be able to step up. We will defi
nitely miss the dynamic duo, though."
Piselli indicated that the team is
equally concerned about the several
defensive players leaving the squad.
"I think just as importantly, we are
going to be losing a majority of our
key defenders," Piselli added. "Their
graduation will also leave a huge gap
on our starting lineup, where younger
players will have to step up and fill in."
"The seniors are our rock, the un
derclassman are our flint — together
we're on fire," junior goalkeeper
Carly Posner said.
"The MPSF has made great
strides as a program in my three years
here," Posner said. "The improve
ment of teams such as Denver is
marked with enthusiasm, as my class
has had the opportunity to see the
growth of lacrosse in the west."
