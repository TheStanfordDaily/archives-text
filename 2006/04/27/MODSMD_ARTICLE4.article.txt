Whether to regain the democratic idealism
lost in the 2004 presidential election, or to
catch a glimpse of one of People Magazine's
"sexiest politicians "students and community
members packed into Kresge Auditorium last
night to hear former senator and vice presi
dential candidate John Edwards speak.
Co-sponsored by Stanford In Government
(SIG) and the ASSU Speakers Bureau, Ed
wards' talk focused primarily on what he
deems "the great moral issue of our time,"
namely, the roughly 37 million Americans
who wake up every day in poverty.
"There's a huge void of moral leadership
in this country," he told the audience in his
charismatic twang. "There is a hunger in
America. A hunger to be inspired again.

[Helping the poor] is not something we do for
them, it's something we do for us. It says
something about the character of America"
Highlighting his work as director of the
University of North Carolina's Center on
Poverty, Work and Opportunity, the former
senator outlined his plan for politicians in
Washington — as well as students on college
campuses — to aid the plight of the less fortu
nate.
Hurricane Katrina brought the issue of
poverty to the forefront of American dis
course, Edwards said, showing that "poverty
does have a face in this country." That face is
often a face of color, he stressed, referring to
the largely African American population of
New Orleans's Ninth Ward district decimated
by the hurricane and subsequent flooding.
