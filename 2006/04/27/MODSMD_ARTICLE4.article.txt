# HERE'S JOHNNY!

### PATRICK FITZGERALD MANAGING EDITOR 
Whether to regain the democratic idealism
lost in the 2004 presidential election, or to
catch a glimpse of one of People Magazine's
"sexiest politicians "students and community
members packed into Kresge Auditorium last
night to hear former senator and vice presi
dential candidate John Edwards speak.
Co-sponsored by Stanford In Government
(SIG) and the ASSU Speakers Bureau, Ed
wards' talk focused primarily on what he
deems "the great moral issue of our time,"
namely, the roughly 37 million Americans
who wake up every day in poverty.
"There's a huge void of moral leadership
in this country," he told the audience in his
charismatic twang. "There is a hunger in
America. A hunger to be inspired again.

[Helping the poor] is not something we do for
them, it's something we do for us. It says
something about the character of America"
Highlighting his work as director of the
University of North Carolina's Center on
Poverty, Work and Opportunity, the former
senator outlined his plan for politicians in
Washington — as well as students on college
campuses — to aid the plight of the less fortu
nate.
Hurricane Katrina brought the issue of
poverty to the forefront of American dis
course, Edwards said, showing that "poverty
does have a face in this country." That face is
often a face of color, he stressed, referring to
the largely African American population of
New Orleans's Ninth Ward district decimated
by the hurricane and subsequent flooding.
First among his proposed reme
dies for poverty in America is to end
the "embarrassment" of the current
national minimum wage. Proving
that he had not lost his knack for the
political stump speech, Edwards
proposed raising the minimum
wage to $7.50 per hour and lobby
ing the states to make his plan work
"We're going to win," he assert
ed. "We're going to win them all."
Other propositions — which
Edwards admitted ranged from
"modest" to "controversial" — in
cluded the unionization of all serv
ice jobs; the creation of work bond
accounts to remedy asset debt; en
larging the scope of housing vouch
es; and modifying the federal budg
et by removing tax cuts for the high
est brackets and subsidies for oil
and gas industries.
"I don't know about you, but I'm
not very worried about how Exxon
is doing," he said, drawing laughter
and applause from the audience.
Education was central to E:d
ward's proposal.
"If America wants to be compet
itive in the long-run, education is
the single most important thing to
do,"he said.
Finally, Edwards concluded his
talk by calling on college students
to remain active in the war against

poverty.
"We're better than this," he said.
"Now is the time for young people
to speak out. You can't wait for
someone else to lead."
In an interview with The Daily
after his speech, Edwards elaborat
ed on the role college students can
play in the political arena.
"College students are princi
pled." he said. "And they have the
courage to speak for their causes".
When asked about the protests at
Stanford last Friday when President
Bush was scheduled to visit the
Hoover Institute, Edwards simply
said, "God bless you."
"You are the heart and soul of
democracy," he added. "Account
ability makes democracy work."
In the interview, Edwards also
offered insight into the upcoming
midterm elections in November,
predicting that "the Democrats are
going to clearly make gains."
Given the tumultuous nature of
the political arena, Edwards could
not predict which issues will be pri
oritized in the fall, with the notable
exceptions of immigration reform
and Iraq. While a number of De
mocrats, including his former run
ning mate John Kerry, have offered
different strategies for winning the
war in Iraq, Edwards told The Daily
that the differences between plans
were "nuanced."
"Everyone has their own strate
gy," he said. "But they all agree that
having this many troops in Iraq
right now isn't working."
