## Univ. prepares for usual hotel shortage 
### LAURA CARWILE STAFF WRITER 
Every year family members and
close friends of graduating students
arrive in Palo Alto for a weekend
full of Commencement events.
However, there is always one
stumbling block that gets in the way
of visitors â€” the noticeable short

Stanford.
The Palo Alto community lacks
sufficient resources to house the
tens of thousands of people expect

will also be a live broadcast of the
event in Maples Pavilion. This
arrangement is unique, as gradua

tion exercises are usually held in
Stanford Stadium, which is current

people have come to Stanford's
Commencement, and while that
number will be lower this year due
to space constraints, the Farm will
nonetheless be overrun with the
families and friends of graduates.
University administrators have
begun brainstorming ideas to help
combat the weekend's housing
crunch.
According to a recent article in
The San Jose Mercury-News, one
long-term solution is the construc
tion of a 170,000-square-foot luxu
ry hotel in Menlo Park that will also
house 100,000 square feet of office
space. The proposed hotel would be
built near the intersection of Sand
Hill Road and Interstate 280.
According to the Mercury-
News, the target market for the
hotel would be the constant stream
