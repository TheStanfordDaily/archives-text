# COMMENCEMENT
## Univ. prepares for usual hotel shortage 
### LAURA CARWILE STAFF WRITER 
Every year family members and
close friends of graduating students
arrive in Palo Alto for a weekend
full of Commencement events.
However, there is always one
stumbling block that gets in the way
of visitors â€” the noticeable short
age of hotels in the area around
Stanford.
The Palo Alto community lacks
sufficient resources to house the
tens of thousands of people expect
ed to arrive for graduation, and the
recent closure of Rickey's Hyatt
House does not help matters.
This year's graduation has al
ready faced controversy as student
and parent protests forced Univer
sity administrators to move Com
mencement from Frost Amphithe
ater to the football practice field
due to concerns over space. There
will also be a live broadcast of the
event in Maples Pavilion. This
arrangement is unique, as gradua

tion exercises are usually held in
Stanford Stadium, which is current
ly under renovation.
In past years, as many as 25,000
people have come to Stanford's
Commencement, and while that
number will be lower this year due
to space constraints, the Farm will
nonetheless be overrun with the
families and friends of graduates.
University administrators have
begun brainstorming ideas to help
combat the weekend's housing
crunch.
According to a recent article in
The San Jose Mercury-News, one
long-term solution is the construc
tion of a 170,000-square-foot luxu
ry hotel in Menlo Park that will also
house 100,000 square feet of office
space. The proposed hotel would be
built near the intersection of Sand
Hill Road and Interstate 280.
According to the Mercury-
News, the target market for the
hotel would be the constant stream
of business travelers who visit the
"high-finance Sand Hill Road corri
dor."The hotel would also be a valu
able option for parents and friends
of graduating seniors on Com
mencement weekend.
Construction on this hotel could
begin by the end of the year, but this
solution will not ameliorate the
short-term issues posed by this
year's graduation.
Nearby hotels like the Stanford
Terrace Inn are already completely
booked for the weekend of June 16-
19.
"We were actually booked up
last year," said Felicia Ventura, sales
and reservations coordinator for the
Stanford Terrace Inn. "Our rooms
were fully booked by October or
November of 2005."
Even next year's graduation class
is getting a head start on hotel ac
commodations, according to Ventu
ra.
"For next year, we have sold al
most half of our rooms already," she
said. "We even have some reserva
tions already booked for 2008."
Booking in advance is a common
activity for many graduation atten
dees. That's exactly how senior
Kathryn Cooper's parents ended up
with a room at the Terrace Inn for
this year's graduation exercises.
"I think my mom made her reser
vations my sophomore year " Coop
er said. "She's one of those people
who plans far in advance."
Other seniors found that they
didn't have to be quite so efficient.
"My parents booked a hotel
reservation in January," said Emily
Boyd. "They're staying at the
[Crowne Plaza] Cabana, and they
didn't have trouble getting a reser
vation."
Other options include temporary
housing in Branner and Wilbur
Halls, as well as hotels as far away as
San Francisco.
Despite the housing issues, Stan
ford students and their parents sure
ly realize that Commencement is a
celebratory weekend, even if it is a
tight fit.
