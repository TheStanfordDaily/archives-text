## Quiz Bowl team takes home national title 
### DAVID STEINHARDT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Earlier this month, Stanford's
undergraduate Quiz Bowl team
won the national title at the NAQT
Intercollegiate Quiz Bowl Champi
onships at the University of Mary
land in College Park.
TWo Stanford teams participated
in the April 7-9 tournament that
featured two divisions — each with
32 of the top teams in North Amer
ica. In total, 256 students participat
ed in the three-day tournament.
Stanford's title came in the un
dergraduate-only Division 2 brack
et. After a preliminary round of 13
games, the teams from Stanford,
Harvard and the California Insti
tute of Technology were tied with
identical 11-2 records, so a series of
short, tiebreaker games was needed
to determine the two teams that
would face off for the champi
onship.
After Caltech was eliminated.
Stanford — led by this year's Col
lege Jeopardy! champion Nico Mar
tinez, a junior — dominated Har
vard 470-110 in the final.
In addition to Martinez, Stan
ford's Division 2 team was com
prised of sophomore Frank Guan
and freshmen Kevin Koai and Alex

Inman. Martinez explained that the
win came as somewhat of a surprise.
"The competition was a lot of
fun, and I thought we would do well,
but 1 really didn't think we would
win the whole thing," he said. "This
was my first time in this event and
we had two freshmen on the team
also. We just put it together at the
right time."
The championship was Stan
ford's first title since 1998, when the
University's Division 1 team took
home first place at the same tourna
ment.
This year's Division 1 team, led
by Eric Smith, the Quiz Bowl Club
captain and a graduate student in
computer science, tied for fifth
place with the University of Vir
ginia in their tournament. UC-
Berkeley took home the title in Di
vision 1; it was the school's second
victory in the last three years.
The weather in Maryland was
less than spectacular, but team
members said they enjoyed the re
laxed mood of the event.
"It started raining the day we got
there, but the atmosphere is gener
ally fun," Koai said in an email to
The Daily. "However there are def
initely teams that take it too seri
ously."
Martinez added that the competi
tion was more intense than he antici
pated.
"It was pretty competitive actual
ly," he said. "When I got there, they
had everybody meet in the auditori
um; it was kind of muggy and proba
bly the worst smelling place I have
ever been. I can say this because I'm
kind of a dork, but it was the biggest
group of nerds I'd ever seen in my
life."
Quiz Bowl is a trivia game played
in teams of three or four. Players
buzz in to answer questions that
cover all academic fields — in addi
tion to current events, pop culture
and sports. Each match has two nine
minute halves and a total of 24 ques
tions. Players also have the chance to
collaborate on bonus questions in
each round.
Stanford's Quiz Bowl Club prac
tices twice a week, and is open to all
students, faculty and staff.
"Practice is a good way to pick up
on general knowledge like books and

authors," Martinez said. "It's also
good for learning how to buzz in on
answers."
He added that these practices —
in combination with Stanford's well
rounded effort — were the key to
the squad's victory.
"We all sort of have different
strengths, so our balance in terms of
getting the toss-up [questions] was
probably the most important thing in
us winning," he said. "A lot of the
schools had one really good player,
but having a well-rounded team is a
huge advantage."
Martinez also explained that the
title match versus Harvard exempli
fied the well-rounded nature of the
Stanford team.
•'The last game was our best game
of the tournament," he said. "People
were watching, and they just asked
the right questions. Everything just
sort of feel into place, and it's just
kind of fun to say you won a national
championship in something."
As the reigning College Jeop
ardy! champion, Martinez competed
in the Jeopardy! Tournament of
Champions the week after the Quiz
Bowl championship. The results of
the $250,000 tournament have not
yet been released, and the episodes
will not air until next month.
