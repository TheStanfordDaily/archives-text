### DAVID STEINHARDT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Earlier this month, Stanford's
undergraduate Quiz Bowl team
won the national title at the NAQT
Intercollegiate Quiz Bowl Champi
onships at the University of Mary
land in College Park.
TWo Stanford teams participated
in the April 7-9 tournament that
featured two divisions — each with
32 of the top teams in North Amer
ica. In total, 256 students participat
ed in the three-day tournament.
Stanford's title came in the un

games, the teams from Stanford,
Harvard and the California Insti

University's Division 1 team took
home first place at the same tourna

This year's Division 1 team, led
by Eric Smith, the Quiz Bowl Club
captain and a graduate student in
computer science, tied for fifth
place with the University of Vir
ginia in their tournament. UC-
Berkeley took home the title in Di
vision 1; it was the school's second
victory in the last three years.
The weather in Maryland was
less than spectacular, but team
members said they enjoyed the re

"It started raining the day we got
