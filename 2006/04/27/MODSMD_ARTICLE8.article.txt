### ADAM WIDMAN STAFF WRITER 
Everything from hydrogen-pow
ered cars to men's hair salons was on
display at the Arrillaga Alumni Center
yesterday for the seventh annual Cool
Products Expo, where the slogan of the
day was "high-tech." The event was de
signed to expose the public to innova
tive products that have not yet hit the
shelves.
Thirty-seven companies participat
ed, making last night's event the largest
of its kind.
The event was co-sponsored by the
Graduate School of Business' Product
Design Club and the School of Engi
neering's Alliance for Innovative Man
ufacturing. Presenting companies were
not allowed to sell products to those in

attendance.
Doug Williams, a second-year stu
dent at the GSB and co-president of
the Product Design Club, explained
that event planners wanted to create an
atmosphere of innovation and creativi
ty-
"lnnovation comes from a lot of dif
ferent places," he said. "The products at
the expo have come from high-tech
companies and people's garages. We
wanted to create an atmosphere that
would inspire people to design some
thing innovative and a place that would
allow passionate innovators to commu
nicate and share their ideas."
According to Christa Glassburn, a
second-year student at the GSB and
the other co-president of the Product
Design Club, members of her group do
research on exciting products and ask

relevant companies to participate in
the expoGlassburn added that the
Business School tries to attract the en
tire student community to the expo, not
just those affiliated with the Universi
ty. She said the event was advertised
through newspapers, news broadcasts,
campus email lists and letters to local
school districts and companies.
At the expo, high-technology vehi
cles were among the more notable
products on display.The Stanford Solar
Car team brought their solar powered
car, while General Motors and Ford
brought hydrogen fuel cell powered
vehicles. A GM spokesman said his
company's vehicle, a blue minivan, was
one of seven produced and cost one
million dollars to build. Ford's vehicle,
called the Ford Focus Hydrogen
Fuel Cell Electrical Vehicle, boast
ed a 91 percent efficient motor that
could power the car to speeds up
wards of 80 miles per hour.
Toyota presented another inter
esting vehicular concept in its I
Unit and 1-Swing prototypes, fu
turesque individual passenger ve
hicles that move in response to user
hand directions. Segway demon
strated a seated, four-wheeled ma
chine similar to its standing, two
wheeled Human Transporter cur
rently on the market.
NASA's Spaceward Foundation
was also present. Representatives
spoke of plans to build a Space El

evator that would use laser light to
power people and equipment to
space.
Stanford affiliates founded
many of the companies that were
present. Meebo. Doostang, MDG
Tools and Blue Labs were among
many companies whose founders
have ties to the Business School.
Another company. Atlas Snow
shoe, had ties to the School of Engi
neering.
According to ITiom Leveque of
Cirrus aircraft, the expo benefits
both the organizers and the compa
nies who attend. He said the expo
was a unique opportunity to show
case products to an eager Stanford
audience.
"When you're working with
Stanford alumni, there's always the
opportunity to run into the right
people who could want to purchase
your product." he said.
