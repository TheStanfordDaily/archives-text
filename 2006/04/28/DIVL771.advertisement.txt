I Why have these items I
been banned from the landfill Like
used motor oil and paint, universal waste is a kind
of hazardous waste. It is illegal to dispose of haz
ardous waste in the garbage. These products contain toxic
substances such as mercury, lead, and cadmium. Mercury, released into the
environment through the improper disposal of mercury-containing products, is
a known neurotoxin. Eventually, chemicals in illegally disposed hazardous waste can be released into
the environment and contaminate our air, water, soil, and possibly the food we eat, potentially caus
ing serious health problems in humans and wildlife.
I Iff I can't throw this stuffff in the trash how do I get rid off it?
fji; You can help prevent this contamination of the environment by recycling all batteries, fluorescent
lamps, including low-mercury lamps, compact bulbs, and straight, circular, spiral and U-bent tubes,
and other universal and hazardous waste. Please do not put these items in the garbage or curbside
recycling bins. To recycle these products free of charge, call the Santa Clara County Household
Hazardous Waste Program at (408) 299-7300 or visit www.hhw.org for a list of drop off locations.
How do I know if a particular electronic device can't be thrown in the trash? A complete
list of universal waste products, and information about disposal and recycling options, is available on
the DTSC Web site at http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/HazardousWaste/UniversalWaste/index.cfm
