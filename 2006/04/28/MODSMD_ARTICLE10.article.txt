# BREAK THE SILENCE
## LGBT rallies on "National Day of Silence" 
### ANDREA FULLER STAFF WRITER 
A group of students dressed in identical T
shirts screamed aloud at the LGBT center just
after 8 p.m. yesterday as they gathered to
"break the silence" after not speaking for an en
tire day. Sponsored by the Gay, Lesbian and
Straight Education Network, the l()th annual
National Day of Silence — which attracted
more than 500,000 participants around the
country — works to underscore the silence ex
perienced by those afraid to speak about their
sexual orientation.
Organizers said that the rules regarding the
Day of Silence were flexible.
"If you can only stay silent for an hour,do it,"
said sophomore Ingrid Fox, publicist for the
LGBT-CRC."If you have a major presentation
but want to stay silent for the rest of the day, it's
your choice. If someone is about to get hit by a
car, yell out to them so they can get out of the
way. Use your judgment, in general, I believe
the norm is to pledge to stay silent for six hours
out of the day."
Stanford's participation in the Day of Si
lence included a silent lunch at noon in White
Plaza. LGBT ordered 600 shirts for participants
reading, "Today I choose to remain silent. I
choose to reflect. I choose to take a stand ...

What will you do to end the silence?"
The day culminated with the "Breaking the
Silence" event at the LGBT-CRC.The event in
cluded discussion, music and performances by
Spoken Word Collective about topics from gay
identity issues to violence against women.
During the "Breaking the Silence" event,
students gathered to discuss their experiences
during the day. Some shared the difficulty of
staying quiet, while others complained about
people who did not show sufficient respect for
participants and tried to make them talk. Some
students discussed how lonely they felt and how
they missed contributing to class; others cham
pioned how the event emphasized the solidari
ty of the LGBT community.
Participating in the Day of Silence allowed
some students to understand the feelings expe
rienced by those who cannot freely talk about
their sexuality.
"I think the moment when I realized how
difficult it was to be silent was when I was bik
ing to class this morning, listening to my iPod
and 1 couldn't sing along with the song," said
junior Dina Howard, coordinator of Cafe Q, the
weekly meeting for LGBT members — which
was replaced this week by the Day of Silence
discussion, "k really is an exercise in putting

yourself in someone else's shoes."
The day reminded others of their
own experiences before coming out.
"1 felt like 1 was a freshman in
high school again." said William
White, freshman and LGBT-CRC
intern. "I wanted to say so much. I
was really quiet freshman year in
high school because I wasn't out. I
realized 1 wasn't true to anyone.The
silence reminded me of that and it
made me really sad."
Magdalena Barrera, an IHUM
teaching fellow, had several silent
students in her classes.
"I didn't have a problem with it at
all," she said. "1 support the state
ment and I'm glad that students
bring that here."
Paz Hilfinger-Pardo, a sopho
more and LGBT-CRC staff mem
ber, said that the Day of Silence
sends a public message about how
many students do not feel they can
speak about their sexuality.
National day of silence is really
important to me," she said. "I've al
ways been a vocal member of the
queer community, but there are so
many of us who don't know who to
talk to or that anyone else is going
through what they're going through.
Letting those who can't talk know
that there are people out there like
them are incredibly important."
LGBT-CRC Visibility Events
Coordinator Nora Levinson, a jun
ior, agreed that the Day of Silence
gives the gay community important
visibility.
"LGBTQ individuals are often
forced to remain silent for fear of in
tolerance, bullying or even vio
lence," she said. "By choosing to re
main silent all day, participants in
the National Day of Silence are able
to reflect on and draw attention to
this silence that is forced upon
queer, questioning and allied people
worldwide."
Levinson felt that the success of
the day's observance reflected
LGBT students' effectiveness and
significant role on campus.
"The Stanford LGBT communi
ty is one of the most visible and well
supported LGBT communities on a
college campus in the USA," she
said. "Stanford is extremely lucky to
have such a high level of support for
student groups to create program
ming and events discussing queer is
sues."
