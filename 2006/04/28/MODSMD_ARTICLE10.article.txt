# BREAK THE SILENCE
## LGBT rallies on "National Day of Silence" 
### ANDREA FULLER STAFF WRITER 
A group of students dressed in identical T
shirts screamed aloud at the LGBT center just
after 8 p.m. yesterday as they gathered to
"break the silence" after not speaking for an en
tire day. Sponsored by the Gay, Lesbian and
Straight Education Network, the l()th annual
National Day of Silence — which attracted
more than 500,000 participants around the
country — works to underscore the silence ex
perienced by those afraid to speak about their
sexual orientation.
Organizers said that the rules regarding the
Day of Silence were flexible.
"If you can only stay silent for an hour,do it,"
said sophomore Ingrid Fox, publicist for the
LGBT-CRC."If you have a major presentation
but want to stay silent for the rest of the day, it's
your choice. If someone is about to get hit by a
car, yell out to them so they can get out of the
way. Use your judgment, in general, I believe
the norm is to pledge to stay silent for six hours
out of the day."
Stanford's participation in the Day of Si
lence included a silent lunch at noon in White
Plaza. LGBT ordered 600 shirts for participants
reading, "Today I choose to remain silent. I
choose to reflect. I choose to take a stand ...

What will you do to end the silence?"
The day culminated with the "Breaking the
Silence" event at the LGBT-CRC.The event in
cluded discussion, music and performances by
Spoken Word Collective about topics from gay
identity issues to violence against women.
During the "Breaking the Silence" event,
students gathered to discuss their experiences
during the day. Some shared the difficulty of
staying quiet, while others complained about
people who did not show sufficient respect for
participants and tried to make them talk. Some
students discussed how lonely they felt and how
they missed contributing to class; others cham
pioned how the event emphasized the solidari
ty of the LGBT community.
Participating in the Day of Silence allowed
some students to understand the feelings expe
rienced by those who cannot freely talk about
their sexuality.
"I think the moment when I realized how
difficult it was to be silent was when I was bik
ing to class this morning, listening to my iPod
and 1 couldn't sing along with the song," said
junior Dina Howard, coordinator of Cafe Q, the
weekly meeting for LGBT members — which
was replaced this week by the Day of Silence
discussion, "k really is an exercise in putting
