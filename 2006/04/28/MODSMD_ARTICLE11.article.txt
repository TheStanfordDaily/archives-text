## Editorial Protest debunks myths of student apathy 
### 
Last Friday's mass protest surrounding
President George W. Bush's visit is a
social phenomenon the likes of which
Stanford has rarely seen, at least in recent
memory. Tales of Pro Fro hookups, sunshine
and sloshball were supplanted by an activist
movement of sorts. For a brief snapshot in
time, the roads outside Hoover Tower
evoked an aura of 1960s popular resistance
— the breed of mobilization made famous
by our rivals across the Bay.
But many observers saw the visit other
wise: one particularly acidic letter to the ed
itor wrote that "those that blocked the roads
should be embarrassed — and like anti
abortion zealots who block access to clinics
— they should be prosecuted for their ac
tions" Another concerned resident agreed:
"If these visitors from all walks of life are
prevented from appearing or are not al
lowed to speak, they will stop coming, and
both Stanford and its students will have lost
a valuable resource."These letters are worth
mentioning not because they make just com
parisons or reasonable assumptions, but be
cause beneath their paranoia and hyperbole
remains an important point.
Last Friday's protest cannot be accurate
ly analogized to the popular fervor of the
1960s that swept campuses across the nation.
Granted, the demonstrators were successful
in forcing Bush to change the location of his
meeting. It was remarkable that protesters
gathered in large numbers despite the limit
ed options for peaceful protest and the ab
sence of an immediate cause.
On a deeper level, the protest was not
fully effective or fully focused, or even espe
cially prolific. But rather than cynically criti
cizing the process or the context, we should
view last Friday's action in optimistic terms
— proof that Stanford students can burst the
Bubble and meaningfully engage with the
World outside Campus Loop.
Stanford students are frequently accused
of being self-absorbed. We often exhibit a

disturbing tendency to be consumed with
our own lives and only the lives we en
counter between our dorm rooms and class.
It is exactly this sort of criticism that engen
ders a crippling sense of resignation and ac
tively discourages efforts to become en
gaged in world affairs. If we have become so
self-absorbed without even trying, is it even
possible to reverse the trend?
It would be unfair to tar the entire campus
with the brush of apathy. It is easy to forget that
most students learned about Bush's visit less
than 24 hours before Marine One landed on
Sand Hill Field; in fact, many of us heard of his
arrival only when we came across the sign
making extravaganza in White Plaza or the
march beside the Quad. Nonetheless, the ranks
of protesters included several hundred Stan
ford students, motivated enough to express
their strong beliefs about issues that they care
passionately about.
People often question the ability of stu
dents to effectively rally behind a cause. But
to decry the protest as a strictly partisan suc
cess (or failure), or even to complain that
Stanford students were mostly spectators, is
to miss the point entirely. Rather, the organ
ic, popular and grassroots nature of this
protest should be lauded, regardless of your
political orientation or activist pedigree.
Nevertheless, we would expect the general
vitriol of protests on campus to improve with
greater warning, time and practice. In order
to test this theory, we can only hope that
Bush chooses to return, or that we somehow
manage to elect an even less popular presi
dent.
As for the future, it is our own responsi
bility to ensure that this single event trans
lates into a consistent spirit of voluntarism,
collectivism and engagement. If a sense of
empowerment was gained from Bush's visit
— even if it was a little messy — then last
Friday's exercise in 1960s Berkeley was
worthwhile. 11 was only a first step, but a step
in the right direction nonetheless.
