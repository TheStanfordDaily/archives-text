# Snakes in a column!

### 
At Stanford, claiming ignorance about
the Sudanese genocide or the cam
paign to forgive Third World debt is
unforgivable. Not knowing who Natalie
Portman is? Somehow that's okay.
People like to say that Stanford is a bub
ble. It's an easy analogy, like comparing
George W. Bush to a chimpanzee or Camryn
Manheim to a water buffalo. But there are
degrees of bubbley-ness.
When people speak of the Stanford Bub
ble, they are usually referring to our myopia
towards politics and world events. We live in
a luxurious intellectual spa, where the wa
ters of half a dozen modern art fountains ca
ress our bronzed skin and the religio-politi
cal battle over creationism in schools gets
stopped at the door. Or so the logic goes.
I don't think Stanford is a bubble in that
sense. Witness last Friday's anti-Bush protes
tors, or last year's successful divestment cam
paign. Stanford may have its fair share of Vi
tamin D-deficient Trekkies who think that
Kazakhstan is the scene of the last battle in
Final Fantasy VII, but our school also has
enough activists to compensate for them.
We're more isolated when it comes to
pop culture. In my room, I have a poster for
the movie "Leon the Professional," starring
Jean Reno (in need of a shave) and a young
Natalie Portman. A visitor to my room
showed interest in the poster:
Me: Do you know who that is?
Visitor: No. Who?
Me: That's a young Natalie Portman.
Visitor Who?
Me: Natalie Portman. You know, Queen
Amidala from the new Star Wars movies.
Visitor: You mean there are old Star Wars

movies?
You can't make this stuff up. Not only
does this episode reveal my lingering patina
of nerdiness (say it ain't so!), but it reveals
that even some of the most socially-con
scious activists may be societally-unaware.
Not knowing the name of TomKat's new
baby girl (it's Suri) is a forgivable offense.
But general pop knowledge is the fabric of
our culture. It's what enables some farmer's
son from Wisconsin to sit down and have a
conversation with a Manhattan debutante.
That and alcohol.
There are signs that all is not lost at Stan
ford. A Facebook group devoted to "Snakes on
a Plane," sure to be the archetypal pop cultur
al event of our lives, has almost 200 members. I
first heard about the Sam Jackson movie from
a fellow Stanford student, before the Internet
buzz lit it afire. This is a Good Sign.
There are Bad Signs. The Facebook's
Pulse feature tells me that we share seven
out of our 10 favorite TV shows with the na
tional college population. You might think
this is a Good Sign, but if you do, you clear
ly don't know the quality of pop culture
that the nation at-large is consuming.

A whole lotta B.S.
What's next, the kid next to me in
lecture reading the Bible? We need
Good Taste, not just Taste. Granted,
our three exceptions are pinnacles
of great TV â€” Arrested Develop
ment, 24 and The Daily Show. But
the first person to list "The Note
book" as one of their favorite
movies gets a notebook-sized fist to
the jugular.
Just where will I find a notebook
sized fist? I have my ways.

To be fair, I haven't had to
worry about too many culture-less
conversations. We tend to sur
round ourselves by people like us.
Engineers sit around and chat ten
sile strengths, die-for-Darfur ac
tivists elope together to San Fran
cisco on chartered buses to
protest and people that watch
"Lost" and know that "Brick" is
more than just a rectangular
building input somehow find each
other.

tion of "Arrested Development" by
