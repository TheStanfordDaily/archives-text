# Freudenschade
## 
### 
For those of you who don't know,
Kaavya Viswanathan is one of those
precocious young things who decided
personal essays are passe and so instead
wrote a novel to get into Harvard.
I haven't read the masterpiece myself, but
1 understand it's one of those teenage-strug
gle affairs, where the protagonist has to over
come cultural restrictions and balance her
upbringing with the thrills and spills of an
American coming of age.
It's difficult to be certain without stooping
to the level of a reader, but I imagine the
"novel" provides a unique insight into multi
culturalism in the third millennium and
shows us the troubles of growing up brown in
a white girl's world, blah, blah, blah.
However, back to the real story. Writing is
hard work and our young author was so over
come with the stresses of telling her tale that
she (apparently unintentionally) channeled
29 passages of one her favorite novels onto
the pages of her own work.
While this copying is a Bad Thing, person
ally, I'm delighted. Actually, delighted does
n't go far enough; the entire episode fills me
with glee.
Since reading the story I've been able to
brighten those numerous dark moments that
frequent the life of a graduate student by con
templating the delightful downfall of youth.
Schadenfreude is a wonderful thing. No
matter how down you are, bad things hap
pening to other people can always cheer
you up.
For me, this blissful feeling invariably aris
es when success turns to failure. When those
youngsters who burn a little brighter than the
rest of us go up in flames, I rejoice.

Of the handful of people reading this, I sus
pect that some are laboring under the miscon
ception that they are too virtuous to feel such
base emotions as joy in the misfortune of oth
ers. Don't kid yourself â€” you may not resent
Kaavya and her overachieving ilk, but there's
someone, somewhere, who you want to suffer.
It may seem a little bitter of me to take
such pleasure in the floundering of talented
young folks. In my defense, however, I really
don't like them. What's more, it keeps my
natural racism in check if I can find another
outlet for the hatred.
You know, now that I think about it, bit
terness is not such a bad thing. Actually, as
life philosophies go, it's a damn sight better
than being one of those fools who insists on
"looking on the bright side." I really find
those people irritating.
Of course joy (even when of the shameful
sort) is very much a positive emotion, and so
it is, in many ways, somewhat antithetical to a
truly bitter outlook on existence. No, if you
want to join the creed of desolation you need
not to embrace Schadenfreude, but rather to
take up the mantle of Freudenschade.
German-speakers and other linguist
purists are probably complaining now.
Freudenschade isn't actually a word, and.

even if it was, it wouldn't mean what I want it
to. But we don't need to listen to those total
itarians.
If Schadenfreude is feeling joy at the mis
fortune of others, then Freudenschade is feel
ing miserable at their joy. It's a very useful
emotion to have in your arsenal.
You see, if one just sticks to the former, the
more conventional Schaden,one is restricted
to experiencing the emotion on the rare oc
casions when those successful people you be
grudge have something go wrong. Unfortu
nately, by their very nature, successful people
don't have things go wrong very often.
On the other hand, with Freudenschade at
your disposal, you have that perfect feeling
(and the perfect word for it) to complement
the everyday seething resentment one has
for those overachievers who insist on show
casing their skills rather than politely hiding
themselves in a corner. Ungrateful bastards.
Like all the good emotions (the ones that
drive you to distraction and are behind all the
best suicide stories), our new one is a jealous
beast. It will circle you warily, eyeing the sur
roundings for any hint of ecstasy. And, should
it find what it's looking for, it will pounce, fill
ing you with bile.
Even better, unlike happiness, misery
feeds off itself and off its enemies, growing
ever stronger. So once you embrace the hid
den pleasures of Freudenschade it will hold
you tight, and you can look forward to a long
and "happy" relationship together. What joy.
