## NATO to Darfur now 
### JAMES VAUGHN 
Two years ago, the Bush adminis
tration, the House and the Senate an
nounced that violence in Darfur had
reached genocidal levels. With this
designation, the crisis in Darfur be
came Rwanda revisited. Yet no pub
lic leader took action. Villages con
tinued to be burned, and women
continued to be systematically
raped. Presently, the Sudanese mili
tary and its Janjaweed militias have
murdered more than four hundred
thousand and displaced two and a
half million more. An entire people
approach eradication.
Compounding an already desper

ate situation, three million Darfuri
ans dependent on international aid
face serious shortages of food and
medicine in the coming months. UN
humanitarian chief Jan Egeland has
announced that only 18% of interna
tional pledges to Darfur have been
fulfilled â€” aid organizations will
have to confront budget shortfalls of
about 1.2 billion dollars.
Sadly. Darfurians seeking refuge
can no longer even flee to Chad,
which previously provided their only
safe haven. The Chadian govern
ment claims that the Janjaweed has
joined local rebel forces now funded
by Khartoum. The increasing mili
tary activity of this coalition has re

suited in the deaths of more than
fifty-five thousand. Recently, New
York Times editorialist Nicholas
Kristof reported that Khartoum's
role in Chad could signal the begin
ning of a full-scale invasion, which
would throw the entire region into
chaos and result in the deaths of per
haps two hundred thousand more.
Khartoum insists that ongoing ne
gotiatioas with the Darfur rebel groups
will end the suffering. The government
also states that any international ac
tion, including sanctions and UN
peacekeeping forces, would jeopardize
diplomacy and destabilize Sudan.
