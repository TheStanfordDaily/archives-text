## NATO to Darfur now 
### JAMES VAUGHN 
Two years ago, the Bush adminis
tration, the House and the Senate an
nounced that violence in Darfur had
reached genocidal levels. With this
designation, the crisis in Darfur be
came Rwanda revisited. Yet no pub
lic leader took action. Villages con
tinued to be burned, and women
continued to be systematically
raped. Presently, the Sudanese mili
tary and its Janjaweed militias have
murdered more than four hundred
thousand and displaced two and a
half million more. An entire people
approach eradication.
Compounding an already desper

ate situation, three million Darfuri
ans dependent on international aid
face serious shortages of food and
medicine in the coming months. UN
humanitarian chief Jan Egeland has
announced that only 18% of interna
tional pledges to Darfur have been
fulfilled — aid organizations will
have to confront budget shortfalls of
about 1.2 billion dollars.
Sadly. Darfurians seeking refuge
can no longer even flee to Chad,
which previously provided their only
safe haven. The Chadian govern
ment claims that the Janjaweed has
joined local rebel forces now funded
by Khartoum. The increasing mili
tary activity of this coalition has re

suited in the deaths of more than
fifty-five thousand. Recently, New
York Times editorialist Nicholas
Kristof reported that Khartoum's
role in Chad could signal the begin
ning of a full-scale invasion, which
would throw the entire region into
chaos and result in the deaths of per
haps two hundred thousand more.
Khartoum insists that ongoing ne
gotiatioas with the Darfur rebel groups
will end the suffering. The government
also states that any international ac
tion, including sanctions and UN
peacekeeping forces, would jeopardize
diplomacy and destabilize Sudan.
However, the talks appear destined for
failure. The Sudanese government has
broken agreement after agreement
and ceasefire after ceasefire, and its col
lusion in Chad's civil strife has caused
its neighbor to resign its mediating role
at the negotiating table. In any case,
who would leave it to the genocidaires
to protect a genocide's victims?
The UN has begun contingency
planning for a UN-ied Darfur mis
sion,but its own officials admit that no

boots will be on the ground until 2007
at the earliest. In the face of accelerat
ing violence, the people of Darfur can
not wait any longer. If the Bush ad
ministration does not help deploy a
multinational intervention soon, by
the end of year we will be bystanders
to over a million dead in Darfur.
We must demand that President
Bush lead the international commu
nity. We must insist on the deploy
ment of a NATO-led rapid response
force to establish civilian protection
in the Darfur region. NATO forces
are well-equipped, well-trained and
have working relationships with
African Union troops on the ground.
Congress can do its part, too.

Where have Congresswoman Eshoo,
Senator Boxer and Senator Feinstein
been? Among other things, they
need to make strong public state
ments on the floor of Congress. They
need to call on the President to help
deploy NATO and UN troops. Final
ly, they need to call on the President
to make a major policy speech about
Darfur — three years into the geno
cide, no one knows if the Bush ad
ministration has a concrete plan to
end the killing and rape.
This Sunday, Apr. 30, Stanford
STAND is providing the student
body with a unique opportunity to
join more than 3,()00 concerned cit
izens at the Golden Gate Bridge

and at the Presidio. We will stand to
gether to span the entire 1.7-mile
long bridge, and we will raise our
voices together at an afternoon
rally. Archbishop George H.
Niederauer of San Francisco, Con
gresswoman Lynn Woolsey and
other distinguished speakers will
join the call for multinational pro
tection.
The message of Apr. 30 and on
wards is this: NATO to Darfur NOW.
