PETA's comparisions were inappropriate
I find it slightly odd that the Stanford community, es
pecially its vocal minority communities, has not been
upset at PETA's display in White Plaza this past week.
While I consider myself a supporter of the "ethical treat
ment of animals," I do not support the likening of chick
ens to Jews in concentration camp or plantation slaves.
The charismatic figures who throughout history have de
manded the rights of minority groups have often made
those demands in the language of a common, universal
humanity — a humanity I find devalued when placed
solely terms of a mere "capacity for suffering." Is it ap
propriate for some white San Franciscan to tell Jews,
African Americans or the Indians who starved under
British rule that their experiences were the experiences
of a laboratory animal? A PETA member who ap
proached me tried to explain that his protest was not in
tended to "equate" people with animals. Yet the group's
posters and their direct and unqualified juxtapositions
do not echo his claim of subtlety. I realize that most ani
mals raised for meat, milk and science lead miserable

lives. But their condition is miserable in itself. PETA
should not and does not need to make their case in
human terms.

Staggering number of animals killed
Thanks for your article about Peta's animal rights ex
hibit (PETA organizes protest in White Plaza to raise
awareness, Apr. 27). You write that 11 million animals are
raised on factory farms each year, but in fact the number
is 11 billion. This represents the vast majority of the land
animals people eat — chickens, cows, pigs and so on. If
you eat meat at a restaurant or buy it in the grocery store,
you can be almost certain the animal lived in a factory
farm and died violently in a slaughterhouse. Practically
speaking, it is almost impossible in present-day America
to avoid contributing to tremendous animal suffering
without becoming a vegetarian.
