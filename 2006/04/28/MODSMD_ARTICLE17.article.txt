Having to study on a Friday night isn't
anybody's cup of tea...unless you do
your weekend cramming at Coupa
Cafe! Trading in stark, cold Meyer Library for
the cozy, attractive Coupa can transform your
attitude toward cracking the books. Nestled in
a pillowed enclave next to a fireplace, chai tea
in hand, reading Kant becomes more roman
tic than burdensome. Add a skylight and in
teresting black and white photography to the
mix, and the verdict is settled â€”Coupa Cafe
provides a great atmosphere to catch up with
some friends or cozy up to your laptop (yes,
there's free wireless). It beats Meyer any day.
The only bad thing about escaping the drab
library is that it doesn't come for free...and it's
not clear just how much it costs. There are no
dollar signs on Coupa Cafe's menu board, and
placards in the dessert case only list ingredi
ents. Some people might enjoy the suspense
of finding out how much damage they've done
to their checking account only after they are
presented with a bill to sign. I personally don't
appreciate the thrill. A menu without prices
might ensure that you order what you really
want, but as a student, my desire for a dish is
almost always influenced by how much I need
to dish out to get it. Hope for a patient barista
who won't mind responding to price inquiries.
Coffee drinks everywhere can be fairly
costly, so Coupa doesn't fare too poorly on
drinks prices. Paying $2.50 for a small chai
tea latte is pretty standard, and Coupa's chai
is quite enjoyable (and better hot than iced).
As the name implies, Coupa is a great place
to get a cup of coffee, but when it comes to a
meal, I advise eating elsewhere. My spinach
crepe ($6.95) was unappetizing, although I
must disclose that I have an aversion to the
type of cheese it contained. Despite the in
fluence of my personal taste, I still feel safe in
saying that going to a restaurant that special
izes in full meals rather than coffee will leave
you much more satisfied than most things at
Coupa Cafe. My only other advice to make
Coupa Cafe the most enjoyable experience
possible is to spare yourself an awkward mo
ment by keeping your feet off the deceiving
ly low coffee tables, because you will be told
to remove them.
