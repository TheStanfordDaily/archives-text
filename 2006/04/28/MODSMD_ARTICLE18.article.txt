mal for many of our budgets and
y y tastes, the new Mai Tai Lounge, which
recently opened ifl the Palo Alto branch, may be just
right. Catering to a more casiSnl crowd, the perfect dress
code in the Lounge (if there were one) would be a Hawai
ian shirt, according to chef and general manager George
Perezveles.
"The Mai Tai Lounge is a casual, fun place to have an
informal meal," said Perezveles, who created many of the
recipes on the Lounge's new menu. "Mix a couple of
things, have a drink and make it work."
Trader Vic's is only a couple miles down El Camino
Readjust about a 10 minute car ride and with its own large
parking lot, a nice switch from scrounging for parking
spots on University Ave. Also, the enormous light-up
tower in front of the venue makes it almost impossible to
miss.
Although the Mai Tai is obviously its specialty, the
Lounge offers a variety of non-alcoholic beverages, in
cluding "soft" versions of their signature drinks including
a Pina Coloda-type concoction and a Mai Tai.
"Many of the drinks can be made non-alcoholic," said
Perezveles. "Expect something sweeter, with a lot of Vit
amin C."

Food at the Mai Tai lounge is still a bit pricey, put it's
possible to. spend less on a lighter fare. Since gut/sts are
able to either stop by for a quick bite and a drfnk, the
Lownge i< somewhat more impressive) alternative to
theltypical "<Mfee" date. While there is no offfcial dress
rode, as there isSq the restaurant, I wouldn>recommend
showing up in your" Bigger Jiefter Branner"T
shirt.
I sampled a selection of Trader Vic's "Cosmo Tidbits."
This included two of the Lounge's new items; Crispy
Shrimp Fritters with a spicy remoulade sauce ($8.00),
Thai Shrimp Rolls (S9.(X)), as well as two of their classic
favorites; Crispy Prawns and spare ribs. The Spring Rolls
were very flavorful and presented nicely and even the
Crispy Prawns were very light — which was a pleasant
surprise when eating fried seafood. However, the Crispy
Shrimp Fritters were heavier and a little tougher to eat
neatly.
If you plan on impressing a date, then I'd recommend
the prawns. All in all the finger food lived up to its name.
For those with a simpler palette, the Lounge also offers a
selection of pizzas (served from 5 to 10pm) ranging in
price from $ 10 to $13.
Trader Vic's decided to expand their Lounge and cre
ate a new menu due to overcrowding in the existing
lounge area, and because the outer portion of the lounge
was unusable during the winter. A smaller room in the

Lounge is also available for rental by private parties.
The hosts at TVader Vic's clearly put effort into aesthet
ics. The libations are well garnished; the Mai Tai conies
with a cherry and pineapple slice through a cute plastic
skewer and a mint sprig. The inside lounge area is very
tasteful with a dark hardwood floor and a number of
small polished wood tables lit with Polynesian-style can
dles. There are also a couple of booths and higher tables
next to a wall of high windows. The walls are decorated
with Polynesian wood carvings and a red neon "Mai Tai
Lounge" sign, but nothing feels overdone or cluttered.
The view from the restaurant is as nice as possible for
a restaurant bordering busy El Camino Real. Although
the road is visible from the lounge area, it receives ab
solutely no street noise and much of the road is blocked
from view by the lush gardens outside of Dinah's Garden
Hotel. An outdoor eating area, decorated with stylish
metal tables and straw umbrellas, also looks nice except
for the fact that El Camino is more audible and visible.
Noise in the lounge is loud enough so as not to make
gaps in conversation exceedingly awkward, but quiet
enough to hear the person across from you without rais
ing your voice. However, given the acoustics of the build
ing, it may be very loud on Thursday nights from 8 to
l()pm when Trader Vic's brings in a Samba band to play a
jazz set. But, if you're not into awkward first-date conver
sations. then maybe this would be the best time to visit.
