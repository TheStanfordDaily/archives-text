# Your spring workout: Get fit and catch some rays
## 
### CAITLIN BERKA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Spring is here,spring is here,life
is skittles and life is beer. It's fi
nally sunny again, which means
that outdoor sports are once again
trendy and scotch-guarded tennis
skirts are making a comeback.
Spring is the time to burn off that
winter pudge any way you can. A
time to laze about and dream of the
promise of summer while halfheart
edly doing your bio reading. A time
when living creatures the world over
decide that procreation is awesome.
And what better place to do this

than outside in the warm sunshine?
Well, maybe you don't have sex out
doors. Unless you're into that kinda
thing. That's not the point. At any
rate, come out of hibernation, stretch
your legs and jump, dive or climb
your way over to one of the lovely
campus athletic facilities that just
scream "springtime."
Avery Pool
Avery Aquatics Center, home to all
the aquatic sports teams at Stanford,
is widely considered the finest out
door swimming and diving facility in
the United States and possibly the

world. The center boasts two l()-lane,
50-meter pools in addition to the
Maas Family Diving Facility, which
hosts both collegiate and internation
al competitions. Just be careful not to
get kicked in the head by a hardcore
diver. Or stalked by a psychopathic
swimfan. Oooh...creepy.
Roble Pool
Smaller and more accessible than the
looming behemoth that is Avery,
Roble Pool is a great alternative, es
pecially for those of us on West Cam
pus. You might be lucky enough to
catch an after-school swim class com

prised of darling little toddlers in
flowered two-pieces, screaming at
ear-splitting volumes because they're
afraid that the water will eat them. Or
you could just go during your lunch
break. Whatever.
Driving Range
Are you an old man at heart? Do you
wear visors and plaid pants? Have
you had one or more skin cancers re
moved from your face or arms in the
past year? Are you a Republican?
Congratulations! Golf is your sport.
Hie Stanford Driving Range is open
seven days a week and is equipped

with 50 driving-stations, a special area
for southpaws and ultra special high
tech doublesecret probation lights for
nighttime driving. Because daylight is
for wimps. And liberals.
Cobb Track
If running in circles is your idea of a
good time, Cobb Thick may be the
place for you. In fact, if you enjoy
beating yourself in the head with a
nine-iron, colonoscopies without
anesthesia and/or Brazilian bikini
waxes, you should DEFINITELY
take up distance running, and Cobb is
the place to start. Ignore the monu

mental, shrine-like walls bearing the
names and times of various track
and-field record holders. They will
only make you feel lazy.
The Climbing Wall
One of the great joys of going to high
school in the area is that P.E. often
consisted of "athletic field trips," i.e.,
treks over to Stanford to use the
climbing wall. When I went, back in
the day, the facilitator was a tall, wiry,
stubbly guy named Clutch who was
rather fond of mushrooms — and I
don't mean portobello. 1 wonder what
happened to him.
