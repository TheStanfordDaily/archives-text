# DOWN & DIRTY
## Stanford at the bottom of the Pac-10 looking up 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Look down. Look farther down. That's
where you'll find the Cardinal in this week's
Pac-1() standings.
Stanford (17-18, 3-y Pac-10) finds itself in
an unusual place this season, having lost five
straight series, and three straight games.
"It's disappointing for us," head coach
Mark Marquess said. "Normally, we're com
peting for the Pac-10 title and this year
we're not. We just haven't played very good
baseball. We really haven't played well for
about the last six. seven weeks."
With No. 16 Arizona State coming to
Sunken Diamond for a three-game series
starting tonight. Stanford is in the heart of
the Pac-10 season. Twelve conference
games remain on the schedule, with Califor
nia, Washington and UCLA due up after
this weekend's ASU series.

The Sun Devils' righthander Josh Satow
(3-0.3.98 ERA) goes up against the Cardi
nal's ace junior Greg Reynolds (3-3, 4.00)
tonight at 6 p.m. Tomorrow at 1 p.m., Stan
ford's freshman Jeremy Bleich (2-3, 3.23)
goes up against lefty Jeff Urlaub (5-1,3.26).
Sunday's 1 p.m. starters have yet to be an
nounced.
According to Marquess, the Sun Devils
(28-14,7-5) don't have a dominant pitcher,
but they do have several good arms in addi
tion to a solid lineup.
"They have a lot of left-handed hitters
and we're a predominantly right-handed
pitching staff, with the exception of Bleich
and [sophomore Blake] Holler," Marquess
said. "They present big-time problems be
cause they can score, they can run, they got
a little power and overall good pitching,
depth, hitting."

Senior catcher John Hester notched the Cardinal's lone RBI in a 6-1 loss to Santa Clara on Tuesday. The loss dropped Stanford below .500 for
the season and extended the current losing streak to three. The team will try to turn around their luck this weekend against No. 16 ASU.
