# DOWN & DIRTY
## Stanford at the bottom of the Pac-10 looking up 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Look down. Look farther down. That's
where you'll find the Cardinal in this week's
Pac-1() standings.
Stanford (17-18, 3-y Pac-10) finds itself in
an unusual place this season, having lost five
straight series, and three straight games.
"It's disappointing for us," head coach
Mark Marquess said. "Normally, we're com
peting for the Pac-10 title and this year
we're not. We just haven't played very good
baseball. We really haven't played well for
about the last six. seven weeks."
With No. 16 Arizona State coming to
Sunken Diamond for a three-game series
starting tonight. Stanford is in the heart of
the Pac-10 season. Twelve conference
games remain on the schedule, with Califor
nia, Washington and UCLA due up after
this weekend's ASU series.

The Sun Devils' righthander Josh Satow
(3-0.3.98 ERA) goes up against the Cardi
nal's ace junior Greg Reynolds (3-3, 4.00)
tonight at 6 p.m. Tomorrow at 1 p.m., Stan
ford's freshman Jeremy Bleich (2-3, 3.23)
goes up against lefty Jeff Urlaub (5-1,3.26).
Sunday's 1 p.m. starters have yet to be an
nounced.
According to Marquess, the Sun Devils
(28-14,7-5) don't have a dominant pitcher,
but they do have several good arms in addi
tion to a solid lineup.
"They have a lot of left-handed hitters
and we're a predominantly right-handed
pitching staff, with the exception of Bleich
and [sophomore Blake] Holler," Marquess
said. "They present big-time problems be
cause they can score, they can run, they got
a little power and overall good pitching,
depth, hitting."

Senior catcher John Hester notched the Cardinal's lone RBI in a 6-1 loss to Santa Clara on Tuesday. The loss dropped Stanford below .500 for
the season and extended the current losing streak to three. The team will try to turn around their luck this weekend against No. 16 ASU.

Final standings are hard to predict
with so much time left — Stanford could
still creep into a playoff position — but
what follows is a quick look at the Pac-10.
Oregon State (28-10,9-3, first
in Pac-10)
The No. 5 Beavers, led by Cole Gillep
sie (.376 batting average), returned sev
eral starters from last year's College
World Series team and were picked to
win the conference title. Will they stay on
top through to the end?
"It's hard to say right now, since we're
only halfway through," junior left fielder
Ryan Seawell said. "They have a good
pitching staff to get them there, so it's def
initely a possibility."
Oregon State's ace Dallas Buck has a
3.09 ERA and an 8-0 record in 11 starts.
Jonah Nickerson follows with a 7-3
record and a 2.35 ERA. The Beavers
have been dominant at home, going 15-2,
and their next seven games are scheduled
in Corvallis.
Southern California (23-20,9-6, second
in Pac-10)
The Trojans suffered an upset loss to
Loyola Marymount on TUesday, 6-5, and
they hope to use this weekend to catch up
to Oregon State. They are only 1.5 games
back of first place.
USC's offense has been explosive all
season, hurting the Cardinal along the
way, and six of their nine regulars have
batting averages over .300. The team's
collective .314 mark has been able to
keep its pitching staff (4.66 ERA) out of
too much trouble.
Arizona State (28-14,7-5, tied for third
in Pac-10)
ASU could also easily move up in the
standings to take the conference title.
"They play, after this weekend, two
of the next three at home, and they're
real tough to beat at home," Marquess
said.
Tonight's sophomore starter Satow
recorded 10 strikeouts against UCLA
last Friday.The Sun Devils are coming off

an extra-inning loss to the Bruins despite
having leads in the ninth and 10th in
nings.
"I had a chance to look at their stats
and 1 know that they're a good hitting
team," Seawell said. "They're also a
young team, a little unexperienced. It's
going to be a struggle, definitely."
UCLA (23-17,7-5, tied for third
in Pac-10)
Cracking Baseball America's rankings
this week for the first time since 2001. the
Bruins check in at No. 22. They hope to
keep the good times rolling in their series
with California this weekend. Two victo
ries would give UCLA its fourth consec
utive Pac-10 series win.
The team made a turnaround in late
February, and since Feb. 28 has gone 18-8.
The Bruins currently rank first in the con
ference and 10th in the nation in fielding.
Hector Ambriz leads the offense with
28 RBIs and four homeruns.
Washington State (27-15,5-7, fourth
in Pac-10)
After going 21-37 last season and fin
ishing 1-23 in the Pac-10, the Cougars
have been a surprise in a relatively even
conference.
"One team that I'm surprised with is
Washington State," Seawell said. "They
were supposed to be by far the worst
team in the league and they beat us two
out of three. They look like they're prob
ably on the upswing."
A 22-7 win energized the lineup last
Sunday, with every starter recording a hit
against Northern Colorado. The Cougars
broke out for 26 hits that game before
notching 14 in Tuesday's game and hope
to have similar luck against USC this
weekend.
Washington (28-15,6-6, fifth in Pac-10)
Halfway through the conference sea
son, the Huskies are headed towards a
duplicate of last season's 12-12 record.
Nevertheless, Washington can be hopeful
that home-field advantage might play a
role in their upcoming league games.
Nine of their next 12 Pac-10 games are in

Washington.
Arizona (19-20,5-7, sixth in Pac-10)
Arizona continued its recent winning
ways against the Cardinal last weekend
when Stanford visited the Wildcats. Ari
zona won its first Pac-10 series of the
year, as the offense exploded on Saturday
and Sunday for a total of 26 runs.
Bill Rhinehart has a 12-game hitting
streak going that he hopes to extend this
week against Washington. The Wildcats
are only one game back of the Huskies in
the conference standings.
California (19-21,6-9, seventh in Pac-10)
Stanford's cross-bay rivals suffered
back-to-back sweeps the past two weeks
against USC and Oregon State. Cal is bat
ting .264 as a team, though Craig Allen
has been having a superb season, swing
ing a loaded bat (.364 average,3o runs. 12
doubles, nine homeruns).
Surprisingly, in light of the team's
record, the Cal pitching staff has done
its job well. The team ERA is only at
3.81, but the Bears have run into some
bad luck this season.They have lost nine
one-run games, four of them in extra in
nings.
The Golden Bears host another tough
Pac-10 challenger. UCLA, this weekend
and look to stop a four-game skid this af
ternoon at 2:30 p.m.
Stanford (17-18,3-9 Pac-10)
Stanford has been stuck in a slump
for a few weeks now — a rarity for the
usually dominant Cardinal squad. While
the pitching was great at the beginning
of the year, the offense never quite came
alive.
Stanford is hitting .262 on the season
and its pitching staff has a 4.60 ERA.The
Cardinal have committed 49 errors this
season to their opponents' 32.
"We haven't put it together," Mar
quess said. "We've been inconsistent
[and] very sloppy defensively, which con
cerns me more than most things. We just
need to play a solid game, and hopefully
if we play a solid game, we'll get a chance
to win."
