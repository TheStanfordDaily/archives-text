## WOMEN'S GOLF Stanford 7th at Pac-10s Freshman Mari Chun paces Cardinal with tenth-place finish, UCLA wins conference crown 
### BY CARSON COOPER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Pac-10 Championship is make-or-break time. It is the point
in the season when every team must prove its mettle and ability to
perform under intense pressure. In a situation where every stroke
counts, the focus of each individual golfer is essential, throughout the
three-day event. Unfortunately, the Stanford women's team was not
able to concentrate sufficiently this week.
The No. 20 Cardinal took 7th overall in the ten-team field with a
combined score of 912. After a strong round on Monday, in which the
team shot a combined 299, Stanford succumbed to the windy Oro
Valley, Ariz., course, shooting a 312 on Hiesday. Stanford closed out
the tourney with a final-round 302.
"It was a much better day," head coach Caroline O'Connor said
of her squad's effort on Wednesday. "The scores weren't quite as
good as we would have liked given the wind conditions, but I thought
our team was resilient fighting back after (Hiesday's) round."
No. 2 UCLA won the overall team title, shooting an 879 to edge
No. 3 Arizona State by one stroke.The Bruins have now won the Pac
-10 tournament for three consecutive years.
UCLA was led by freshman Tiffany Joh, who shot an even-par
216. Joh was later named Pac-10 Newcomer of the Year.
"We were pretty optimistic," Joh said of her team's prospects en
tering the tournament. "But we knew ASU was going to come out
firing."
No. 6 USC took third with an 891, while No. 11 California nabbed
fourth with an 896.
Washington senior Paige Mackenzie capped off an illustrious ca
reer by winning the individual championship. After shooting one
under 71s in the first tvvo rounds, she fired off a 69 on Wednesday to
claim the win.
"It feels great," Mackenzie said of her accomplishment. "It's ob
viously one of the bigger tournaments of the year, and we played
against a great field. And it's the conference championship, so it feels
really great to walk away on top."
Leading the way for the Card was freshman Mari Chun. A week
after taking seventh at the Peg Barnard Collegiate, Chun took tenth
overall at the Championships. The emerging star shot a one-over 73
on the opening day en route to a three-round total of 222.
Junior Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana tied for 15th with a total of
226. Junior Lauren Todd shot a 232 to take 33rd place, and senior
Kelly Husted and freshman Ki-Shui Liao tied for 34th with three
day totals of 235.
Despite a tough week for the Card, the team received good news
with the announcement of the Pac-10 All-Conference team. Both
Husted and Tangtiphaiboontana received honorable mention for
the second consecutive year.
Irene Cho of UCLA, the No. 2 collegiate golfer in the nation, was
named Pac-10 Golfer of the Year. Joining Cho on the First Team
were Mackenzie, Bruin Jane Park, and Arizona State's Azahara
Munoz and Jennifer Osborn.
Melissa Luellen of Arizona State was named Pac-10 Coach of the
Year after leading her team to ten top-5 finishes and a No. 3 nation
al ranking.
Next up for Stanford is. most likely, the NCAA West Regional,
hosted by the University of Washington.
