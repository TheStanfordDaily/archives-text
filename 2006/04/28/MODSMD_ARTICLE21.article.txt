## Golf falls short at conference tourney Kemmer impresses, Grube falters and Stanford finishes sixth at Pac-10 championships 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES STAFF WRITER 
Running into trouble after a strong start, the men's golf team \Vas
unable to keep up with the other teams and its own expectations at the
Pac-10 Championship this week on the Bighorn Golf Course in Ran
cho Mirage, Calif. The Cardinal placed sixth, while sophomore Rob
Grube led the team, tying for sixth.
No. 5 UCLA finished in first with an even-par 1420, 12 strokes
ahead of its nearest competitor, Washington. Stanford finished 26 over
par, just a few strokes behind Arizona State, Southern California and
Arizona, third through fifth, respectively.
i think if you look at the results, certainly we can be a little disap
pointed," head coach Conrad Ray said. "But I think if you look at the
scores, we were very close to second or third place in terms of shots. 1
think we were right there."
In its first round, Stanford was off to a solid start with a three-over
par 358. good enough for third behind the Bruins and Huskies. How
ever, the Cardinal fell off from there, ending up in sixth after a 14-over
par second round.
Freshman Dodge Kemmer led the Cardinal through the first two
rounds with a pair of 71s and tied for ninth. Meanwhile, usual team
leader Grube was in 26th after a five-over 76 in the second round. Hav
ing gone in with high expectations after two individual titles this sea
son, Grube said he had difficulty with his swing and worked hard to
turn things around.
"I found a quick fix on the third day and hit the ball well the rest
of the tournament," Grube said. "I was frustrated by my second round
because it really put me behind the eight ball. I knew I needed a great
weekend and unfortunately I had only a good one."
A three-under third round and a two-under fourth pulled Grube
from 26th to sixth (70-76-68-69-283). In the process, Grube took lead
ership of the Cardinal from Kemmer, who went on to tie for tenth (71-
71 -70-73-285), his best showing of the year.
"I was definitely impressed by [Kemmer's] play," Ray said. "He
held himself well, fought his way around the course very well and
played very maturely. I think he learned a lot in the course of his fresh
man year about how to manage the course and his game."
The rest of the Cardinal men had difficulty managing their own
games, however. Senior Kyle Gentry tied for 23rd (292), freshman
Daniel Lim tied for 26th (293) and junior Zack Miller tied for 35th
(297).
"I think the guys just didn't play well," Ray said. "That's how golf
goes. It was a long hot day and the greens were pretty fast. We had a
few big numbers and some guys just didn't have their best stuff."
Having worked all season to catch up to UCLA and Southern Cal
ifornia, both of whom the Cardinal has proven competitive with, it was
a disappointment for the team to once again fall short.
Stanford will have another chance, though, when it faces both in
the NCAA Western Regional. May 18-20 at the TUcson National Golf
Club in Tucson, Ariz. The NCAA National Championship will follow.
May 31 through June 3 in Sunriver. Oregon.
For now, the Cardinal have a chance to rest after an intense few
weeks, work on keeping their games sharp and focus on their short
game. Ray said. The Pac-10 Championship only provides further mo
tivation for the team.
"We still expect to win [the NCAA regional]," Grube said. "How
ever, we understand that there's a lot to do between now and then.
We'll stick to our preparation plan and work like we have all year â€”
efficiently and effectively.The team is feeling very good about the two
tournaments coming our way."
