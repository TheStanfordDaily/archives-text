# STANFORD KAYAKING
## Canoe and kayak Now you know 
### DENIS GRIFFIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Canoe and Kayak team
might just be the best Stanford sport you've
never heard of.
Consider this: from the time the team was
formed five years ago, they've won the nation
al competition every year. How's that for a
sport that the university doesn't even really
consider to be... well, a sport.
The kayakers are currently making a bid to
become a club sport here at Stanford, having
been turning down five years ago when the
team was formed.Hie reason? It's hard to be
a kayak team when you don't have any
kayaks.
"We always felt that we should be a club
sport," said sophomore captain Chris Chap
man. "Right now we're a Student Group with
the ASSU, but we really are a sport. We're an
athletic team — we train, we compete, and we
represent Stanford across the country."
"When the team was first formed,we put in
a bid to become a club sport," Chapman ex
plained. "But we were turned down because it
was too early and we didn't have any boats."
But the team has spent the last five years
learning the management side of sports —
and of course acquiring boats, too. And now.
they're ready to be recognized by the univer
sity and the student body.
"Almost no one knows that we compete
for Stanford," said sophomore captain Rebec
ca Pass. "You couldn't find it on the Stanford
Athletics website that we exist, or that we're
winning national championships. It would be
great for those national championships to be a
part of Stanford's legacy."
And make no mistake — becoming a club
sport is absolutely crucial to the future growth
of the program, senior captain Rachel Enslow
insists.
"We've kind of reached the point where, if
we want to develop this program further, we
really need to be able to expand our opportu
nities and expand our funding," Enslow said.
"If we want to grow any further, we really
need to have a stable base for development."
Not only is the Stanford Canoe and Kayak
team simply the best nationally, they are also
among the only teams competing at such a

high level in a sport that is still growing in
leaps and bounds. There's a strange sense of
camaraderie then, even between paddlers
from rival universities like Stanford and
Georgia Tech, the two most formidable pow
ers on the national kayaking scene.
"It's a very tight-knit national community
in the sport," Pass said. "At nationals, for in
stance, even though we're competing against
Georgia Tech and care about winning, it's just
a lot of fun to get to hang out with other col
lege students who do kayak."
The Stanford paddlers race flatwater
kayaks, very different from the traditional sea
kayaks most are familiar with. Flatwater boats
are sleeker and designed for more speed, but
they are also more prone to tip and cannot be
rolled in the water like a traditional kayak.
Just learning to balance in the boats is an ac
complishment in and of itself.
Despite the difficulty of managing the one
, two- and four-person flatwater kayaks used
in competition, the team accepts new mem
bers of all skill and experience levels.
"It's such a new sport on the national level
that there's a big emphasis on introducing
new people to it and getting them excited
about kayaking," Chapman said. "We spend a
lot of our time teaching newcomers how to
balance and paddle. Even if it's their first year
paddling, they can go and compete against
students from other universities who are at
their skill level."
The team members assign much of the
credit for their success to coach Jeanna
Sanchez, who played a major role in founding
the Stanford team and remains heavily in
volved with the international competition as
pects of flatwater kayaking.
"She has a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of
support for students involved with kayaking,"
Enslow said. "She doesn't really care what
your experience level is. So long as you work
hard and are excited about it, she's happy to
work with you."
TTie best Stanford team you've just heard
of next takes to the water at nationals on May
13 in San Diego, Calif. But whether they man
age to stay perfect in national competition or
not, the Stanford paddlers have clearly
proven that they can be valuable additions to
the Stanford Club Sports scene.
