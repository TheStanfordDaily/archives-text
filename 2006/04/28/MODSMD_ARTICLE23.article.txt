## Chauntae Bayne-Hackett: Running for her life and happy about it Finally centered, sophomore dreams of pro career for her daughter's sake 
### ISRAEL ROJAS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's hard catching up with student-athletes. Stanford
keeps its students busy enough, and participating in Divi
sion I athletics certainly doesn't make it any easier. But

the Daily is perseverant, and not even the fastest woman
on campus — Chauntae Bayne-Hackett — could escape
a personal interview. And once we got her talking,
Chauntae was more than willing to talk. Here is what the
Daily learned:
It all began in Palestine, Texas. The second child of
Lorjust and Etha Bayne, Chauntae was born on April 4,
1984. From the beginning she was very social, carrying on
conversations with anyone and everyone — and some

times no one.
"My parents tell me I used to talk to the walls," Bayne
said.
When she wasn't busy befriending corners, she was
racing to them alongside her two brothers.
"We used to run in the middle of the streets, racing to
the stop signs." Bayne recalled. "Sometimes my mom
would come out and race us too."
When she turned 10, her family moved to Ft. Worth,
Texas, where she started running summer track and play
ing basketball. Her career began as a long-jumper, where
she reached junior nationals. Her success led coaches to
believe she'd be a good sprinter, and at 11, she began run
ning the KM) and 2(X) meters.
Her first trip to nationals as a sprinter resulted in a
third place showing. As she grew older, she kept going
back to nationals, winning a majority of them.
"I ran on a good summer team." Bayne explained,
smiling.
Surely she did. And it didn't hurt that both her parents
ran track. Her father, a long jumper, reached the Olympic
trials, but pulled his hamstring and was unable to com
pete.
By the time Bayne reached high school, track success
was second nature and she set her sights on running for a
Division 1 team, scholarship in tow. High school was not
the greatest for Bayne, however, as she didn't get along
with her peers, and instead made older friends that she'd
meet through her brother. Rather than making friends
with everyone she came across, Bayne focused instead on
developing close relationships with a smaller group of
people.
"As you age, reality sets in and you realize everyone
doesn't care about you," Bayne said. "In a lifetime you
only have a handful of good friends, maybe five."
Upon her arrival to Stanford, Bayne forgot about this
philosophy and got caught up in the social scene. Soon,
she lost sight of her track and academic goals. She
watched her weight go up and her grades go down.
"1 had a horrible track season," she said. "And before
Stanford, 1 had never been upset or sad about academics.
Then one quarter 1 was taking a physics final and midway
through 1 lost it. I broke down and cried and left the test."
For the first time in her life, Bayne felt alone. She was
homesick. I laving grown up an independent child. Bayne
struggled with her loneliness.
Then came sophomore year. After she was suspended

from the track team. Bayne's scholarship was revoked.
Her parents were unhappy about her academic situation
and the communication lines with them were deteriorat
ing.
But things turned around for Bayne when she met the
man who is now her husband.
Bayne was at Manzanita reuniting with her first love:
basketball. She noticed a guy wearing a Texas shirt, and
her state pride prompted a conversation.
"He tells people,'l took jumper and she blocked my
shot. That's when 1 knew I was in love.'" Bayne recalls
fondly.
With her life in disarray — Bayne wasn't taking class
es and didn't have a dorm — things moved fast. In Janu
ary' of 2005, Bayne had a baby, a little girl whom she
named Kytriana.
Life hit Chauntae all of a sudden — responsibility ar
rived, and she realized she needed to put her life back to
gether. And so, a month after giving birth, she started
training. With an improved work ethic, Bayne pushed
herself to focus on academics and track, with her family
as all the motivation she needed.
"Both [my husband and my daughter] helped me get
my life straight," she said.
Now, in the spring of 2006, Kytriana is over a year old,
and things are much improved. Bayne's social life has
slowed down and she recognizes that it has been a change
for the better. She is training as hard as ever, pursuing her
dream of running professionally. Ideally, she said, she will
make enough money running track to provide financial
security for her daughter. But if not, Bayne has a plan B.
"Young athletes these days are too concerned with
money," she said. "You have to have more than one plan,
because you could get hurt at any moment."
Bayne doesn't plan to leave Stanford without getting
her degree. Her love of designing has led her to pursue a
career in architecture, and she is currently majoring in
Civil Engineering with a minor in Urban Planning.
Juggling academics, athletics, and family life may seem
like a lot for a Stanford student-athlete. It probably is. But
Chauntae Bayne isn't worried. And it certainly hasn't
stopped her from assaulting the Stanford record books
— she now holds the school's 60 and 200 meter indoor
records, along with several others.
Having gone through some terrible lows, Bayne is
happy with where she is.
"I am very proud of myself now," she said.
