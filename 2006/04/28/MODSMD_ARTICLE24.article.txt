## Dalai-Lamania 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
The Dalai Lama, sitting cross-legged and shoeless on a
large red chair, joined religious and medical experts in a sold
out Memorial Auditorium on Saturday to discuss the Buddhist
and medical approaches to craving and suffering.
The day-long seminar on spiritual and scientific explo
rations of the human experience focused on discovering the
basis of these two impulses. The two sessions were billed by
planners as the continuation of a long dialogue between reli
gious and medical experts aimed at building a common under
standing of how the brain functions and how suffering can be
alleviated. As the 1,700 people watched in the audience, more
listened to the event on Stanford's KZSU or watched it live on
the Internet.
"We chose these two topics [craving and suffering] because
they are so central to Buddhist thought and so interesting to
our scientists," said William Mobley, moderator of the confer
ence and director of the Neuroscience Institute at Stanford.
A friendly but sometimes heated exchange among neurol
ogists, psychologists and Buddhist theorists covered a wide
ranging and mostly unscripted variety of issues. But both reli
gious and medical panelists expressed a strong desire to work
together and learn from each other.
"This is not about trying to apply scientific method to reli
gion or applying faith to science," said Philip Pizzo, dean of the
School of Medicine. "These are all parts of the human experi
ence. It's about boundaries and where they overlap and con
â–  nect."
Telling the audience that "we are a bit backwards," Tenzin
Gyatso,the 14th Dalai Lama, said Buddhists could learn from
science. "For Buddhists, it is extremely useful to learn from sci
entific findings, scientific exploration."
In the morning session, the panelists discussed why humans
crave. Much of the talk surrounded differing definitions of
craving and desire. Neurologists use craving to describe any
desire, including breathing and eating. Buddhists define crav
ing as only unhealthy desires.
