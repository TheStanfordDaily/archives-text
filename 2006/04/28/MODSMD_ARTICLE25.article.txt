# 100 years after the quake

### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
The University has spent upwards of $300 million and seismically retrofit
ted nearly 140 buildings since 1989 to prepare for the next Big One, which —
according to scientists — could hit at any time. A concerted effort has been
made to help structures resist such a trembler and prevent the level of dam
age left in the wake of the famed 1906 disaster.
The University today is very different from the one nearly destroyed 100
years ago today by the Great San Francisco Earthquake. Virtually all of cam
pus has been built or rebuilt since the magnitude 7.8 quake wreaked havoc
on the Peninsula. Behind the adobe facade of the Quad, for example, sits re
inforced concrete and strengthened rebar.
The University made a conscious decision to self-insure for earthquake
damage. While there will not be a fat insurance check to help rebuild after the
next quake, Stanford spends the money it saves on premiums to pay for proj
ects to retrofit or renovate its buildings. This helps limit damage because the
structures are made to better withstand quakes.
"Insurance gets you money after an earthquake, but it does not give you
life back," said Civil and Environmental Engineering Prof. Helmut Krawin
kler, who said the decision paid off in the 1989 Loma Prieta Quake.
In interviews over the past week, experts agreed that the school has made
reinforcing its buildings a priority.
