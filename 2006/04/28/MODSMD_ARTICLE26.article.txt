# Don't ask, don't tell

### ANDREW BURMON 
Yesterday at 11:20 a.m., two baffled looking Army recruiters
from the Judge Advocate Generals Office of the United States
Navy (JAG) stood in the courtyard of the Stanford Law School. By
11:45 a.m., the courtyard was filled with 60 protesters, some in cam
ouflage, others in collared shirts, their mouths shut with duct tape
saying "Don't Ask, Don't Tell."The protesters marched in a wide cir
cle and shouted slogans.
"What do we want?" yelled one protester.
"Equality, 1 ' responded the rest.
"When do we want it?"
"Now."
The demonstration, which was organized by OUTLAW, a group
of law students headed by two second year students. Spencer Jones
and Michael Angelo. was aimed at protesting the Army's LGBT pol
icy, the Solomon Amendment and what they perceive as the Univer
sity's failure to take a stand against the amendment.
The Solomon Amendment, which originally passed in Congress
in 1997, allows the federal government to withhold funding from
universities that do not allow the army to recruit. The situation is
complicated by the army's "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy, which dic
tates that open homosexuality can be grounds for discharge from the
service. At many institutions of higher learning, including Stanford
Law School, a non-discriminatory recruitment policy is in place
which dictates that no employer can recruit on campus if that em
ployer discriminates based on "age, religion, disability, ethnic back
ground, national origin, gender, race, sexual orientation or veteran
status."
