Although President George W. Bush was
scheduled to meet with fellows at the Hoover In
stitution on Friday, the presence of more than

and meet with advisers and faculty members at the
residence of former Secretary of S t a te and Hoover
Fellow George Shultz on the outskirts of the Stan
ford campus.
More than 100 armed law enforcement and Se
cret §ervice officers lined the streets outside of
Encifh Commons, as students, parents, faculty
members and local residents protested Bush's an
ticipated arrival on cast campus, While the protest
was peaceful, three Stanford students — seniors
Claire- Wagenseii, Diogo Pereira and Caroline
Martiu — were arrested as police pushed the
cr<)wd out of Sen a Street.
All three students were chargcd with tw*f mis
demeanors. failure to yield to a Vefiide in a road
way; and insisting, delaying and obstructing a
p t tee officer. One of the students w|s also charged

with battery, according to Sgt. Hilary Karp of the
Stanford Department of Public Safety. The three

that day.They will appear in Palo Alto Court to an

The protest began at approximately 2 p.m. in
White Plaza, where 200 students gathered to make
signs and rally against the administration. As they
began marching toward Hoover Tower, others
joined their ranks and began to chant slogans. By
the time the rally reached the Institution at 2:30
p.m., approximately 400 protesters lined the police
barriers set around the building.
People continued to join the movement, and
the slogans for reform grew louder as time passed.

crowd charged. "Hey-Hey-Ho-Ho-Bush is here,
he's got to go* Another popular slogan targeted
