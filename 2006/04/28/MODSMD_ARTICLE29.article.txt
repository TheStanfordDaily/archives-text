### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
The one-day work stoppage that more than 2.600
workers took part in on Dec. 12 could be a preview of
a longer strike to come if the University and Stanford
Hospital do not make significant concessions, union
leaders said after returning to the table for talks the
following day.
University and union representatives disputed the
success of the strike as they continue to search for
common ground.
With the facilitation of a federal mediator request
ed by Stanford, negotiators for the University and
service workers re-opened talks the day after the
strike.The meeting had no conclusive results, and both
sides reiterated their positions. They agreed to meet
again, after returning from vacations, on Jan. 4 and Jan.
11.
Negotiators mutually agreed to cancel the Jan. 4
session. Representatives from both sides do not ex
pect to reach consensus at the Jan. 11 meeting and
more meetings are expected after Wednesday.
The University has offered a more
tone in recent weeks and expressed willingness late
last week to resume discussions with union leaders.
