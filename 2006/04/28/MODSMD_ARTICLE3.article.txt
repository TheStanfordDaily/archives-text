## Stanford's big man on the mound 6-7 junior pitcher Greg Reynolds brings the heat from up high as Friday night ace 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Hitters tell him that his pitches seem to come out of the sky.
They tell him that that they can't lift up on the ball, that they can't
seem to get their barrel on it. It's almost as if Greg Reynolds' pitch
comes straight down.
Standing 6-foot-7 gives you that kind of intimidation.
Reynolds' presence on the mound — and off — is the first thing
one notices about the Cardinal's ace. The junior righthander
stands out, in more ways than one, on Stanford's roster.
"It's like looking at a giant," junior leftfielder Ryan Seawell
said.
Certainly, Reynolds' height has its advantages on the field. His
imposing frame adds to his pitching repertoire, and it's not sur
prising that he was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies out of high
school.
But what about off the field?
"It definitely has its advantages," Reynolds said. "You can

Junior righthander Greg Reynolds struggled with an adolescent
growth spurt but now takes full advantage of the imposing figure he
cuts on the pitcher's mound, leading the team in wins in 2006.
change a lightbulb without a ladder."
"He's a really down to earth guy,"
Seawell said. "He's always laughing.
As intimidated as you are by his big
size, he makes vou feel comfortable

with his personality."
But as dominant and commanding
as he is coming out of the wind up —
his fastball, changeup and curve usu
ally have led to mostly quick innings
this season, and he leads the Card
with 59 strikeouts — Reynolds' easy
going and outgoing personality could
easily be associated with his Northern
California upbringing.
The Pacifica, Calif., native is used

to being surrounded by people. He
grew up the youngest of live boys and
plays the older brother to a sister.
With four brothers five to 10 years
older than him. Reynolds practically
grew up with a ball and glove in his
crib.
Reynolds followed his brothers'
paths and played multiple sports in
high school. And just like his brothers
and 6-foot-3 father, Reynolds kept
growing and growing.
"I'm actually the tallest out of all
of them," he laughs. "I could probably
beat everybody up in my family now."
The period of time between his
freshman and junior years of high
school saw Reynolds jump from 6-
foot-2 to 6-foot-6. In his three years at
Stanford, he has added one more
inch.
"That was tough," Reynolds said
of his growth spurt. "I was real unco
ordinated and it was hard. My body
couldn't keep up with how fast 1 was
going. Eventually 1 kind of grew into
it,but 1 still think I've got a little unco
ordination in me."
Reynolds' cheerful attitude is al
most necessary for this season's Car
dinal squad, which has had trouble
finding an offensive rhythm and is last
in the Pac-10 after dropping five
straight series.
"It's tough when you're not doing
so well as a team," Reynolds said.
"No one is playing up their potential.
But as a leader, your first instinct is
to turn to yourself and ask,' What am
I doing wrong? What am I not get
ting across to the rest of the team
that is going to help us win?'"
It took Reynolds' two years to
step into that leadership role,and the
defining moment of his progression
came in a postseason start last June
against Baylor in which he pitched
II innings and recorded 10 K's.
That summer in Cape Cod,
Reynolds made sure he worked
harder than anyone else to earn the
Friday starter job. His skills and con
fidence greatly improved between
his sophomore and junior years, and
the results are visible.
Head coach Mark Marquess
commented that Reynolds (3-3,4.00
ERA) has given the Cardinal a
chance to win in all 11 of his starts
this season. In all but one of those
games. Marquess added, the Cardi
nal have had a lead. Reynolds has
given his team six solid innings in the
majority of his starts, and in two of
his losses he allowed only three
earned runs.
Reynolds' hard work has paid off,
but the Cardinal team is having a lit
tle more trouble. Reynolds said that
it's never been a question of how
hard the team has been working. He
sees his teammates putting in extra
time in the cages and in workouts,
but frustration abounds from the
team's on-field performance. Never
theless, Reynolds has done his best
to keep the Cardinal afloat.
"Without him, we'd be in trou
ble," Seawell said. "He knows what
to say at the right time to get us mo
tivated, he knows when to come over
and use some encouragement, but
also when to lay into you a little bit."
Reynolds will leave Stanford
after this season if he is drafted this
June. Wanting to start his profession
al career at as young an age as possi
ble, the junior would try to come
back and finish his degree in the off
season. Reynolds, it seems, is always
trying to reach new heights.
