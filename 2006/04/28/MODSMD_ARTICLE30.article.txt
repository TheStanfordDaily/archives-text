# Stadium's Last Stand
## 
### BY ALEX GYR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The final contest at Stanford Stadium almost
lived up to the reputation of some of the great
players, teams and coaches that have been there
throughout its 84-year history. But not quite.
Instead, it was a game that fit perfectly with
the trends of the 2005 season.
The Cardinal (5-6,4-4 Pacific 10 Conference)
took the lead in the final two minutes over No. 6
Notre Dame (9-2) but couldn't hang on late, as a
Darius Walker touchdown run with 55 seconds
to go gave the Irish a 38-31 victory.
It was the third time this season that the Car
dinal lost at home on their opponent's final drive
of the game and the second time that they lost a
lead to a top-10 team. This loss was particularly
painful given that it was Senior Day and the Car
dinal's last chance to earn their first bowl berth
since 2001.

"Being this close - it hurts, especially for the
seniors," junior receiver Mark Bradford said.
"Coming in, that had been our motivation, to get
that extra game. I didn't want this to be our last
game as a team. It is very disappointing, being so
close and not getting it done."
"This was a crazy game," Harris said. "It was
probably a lot of fun for someone who loves
football. It probably wasn't a lot of fun for some
one who loves Stanford."
With the win, Notre Dame almost certainly
assures itself a BCS Bowl berth, most likely the
Fiesta Bowl. For Stanford, the loss means the
fourth straight postseason without a bowl - and a
long winter.
"I think [this game] will do a lot to motivate this
team in the off-season," Edwards said. "I believe
these seniors have left us something tangible for
the future," he said. "1 think it is the ability to
fight back. We have a lot of work to do and a lot
of fighting to do."

Quarterback Trent Edwards, about to ba sacked by a Notre Dame defender, looks to pass in the Cardinal's heartbreaking 38-31 loss
on Nov. 26. The Cardinal failed to qualify for a bowl game for the fourth year in a row, finishing the season 5-6 and 4-4 in conference.
