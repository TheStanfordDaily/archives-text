# TENNIS: THROUGH OUR EYES
## 
### WHITNEY SADO MIA LEE SENIOR STAFF WRITERS 
Throughout the 2006 season, the Daily has run a week
ly series called "Through My Eyes," presenting the
women's tennis team in their own words. Here are
some selections:
*
Senior Amber Liu
2 Being a senior
» I think it hasn't quite set in yet that I'm a senior and
that my Stanford playing days will be over in a few
short months. I think it'll be really emotional for my
class once we start NCAAs this year — especially be
cause we are so close.
Sophomore Whitney Deason
Looking ahead to stepping up
It's going to be really different next year with the
seniors gone, because the four of them make up almost
half the team. They all bring so much and are such

strong leaders that it will definitely be an interesting
adjustment. But having been on the team with them
for two years, I've really learned from them. We all
have.
Junior Anne YeLsey
Not as easy as it looks
I think the common perception is that we go out
there and kill our opponents. They look at our 62-0
record but don't realize that we have a lot of close
matches that can come down to the last minute. When
we played Texas, the tallied score was 4-0, but we had
been losing on three courts.The truth is, we've been in
some tight match situations, and I think those in
stances will come up again.
Junior Theresa Logar
Bonding on and off the courts
We're really just a bunch of sisters. It's great at the
end of the day to hang out with your best friends on the
courts and at dinner, or at Potter watching "Grey's

Anatomy." We're actually turning into that obsessive
team that does everything together.
Sophomore transfer Celia Durkin
Curiosity killed the cat
Or perhaps in this case, froze it. Last year, I was de
ciding between Stanford and Harvard, and my curiosi
ty to go far away made me choose Harvard. It was only
then that I really found out that I am a definite Califor
nia girl. This school is pretty perfect, and I was definite
ly missing out on a real college experience last year.
Sophomore Lejla Hodzic
There is no T in 'team'
It's been a growing experience for me to be part of
a team. As I've been able to associate with the girls
more, I've found that everyone is kind of on the same
page and I've had a lot more respect for the team dy
namic. It was definitely something I was grateful for
during my injury. All the girls were really concerned
and they would check in to see how I was doing.
