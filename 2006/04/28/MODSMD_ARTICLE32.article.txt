## MASCOT SUSPENDED FOR ALCOHOL AT GAME 
### BY DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
Erin Lashnits, a coterminal student in biological sciences, has
been suspended for the remainder of her tenure as Stanford Tree.
Band Manager Mike Priest and Assistant Manager Adam
Cohen announced their decision to Lashnits on Thursday night, just
hours after UC-Berkeley Athletic Department officials Breatha
lyzed her at a .157 blood-alcohol content at halftime of the men's
basketball team's 65-62 loss at Berkeley, according to sources, in
cluding several in the band.
"I'm sad to be done," said Lashnits, who at 23-years-old, is ac
cused of violating not the law, but the Band's alcohol probation.
"It's been the best year of my life, pretty much on a daily basis."
Lashnits claimed the trouble started not over alcohol, but over
miscommunication about where on Cal's court she would be per
mitted to dance.
"I spoke with the various Cal reps, and usually there's places that
you can and can't go on the court - where I am, where Oski is, where
the Cal student section is - they want to keep these things very sep
arate," Lashnits said. "(A Cal Athletic Department employee] told
me I couldn't cross the free-throw line - I thought he meant the
other side's free-throw line, not that I was only allowed to be stand
ing under the basket. So I was out at center-court, where I wasn't al
lowed to be, having no idea."
Whatever the cause. Berkeley officials escorted the former Stan
ford varsity diver off the Haas Pavilion court and barred her from
returning. From there, the decision to suspend her for the rest of her
tenure was all but inevitable, according to Cohen.
"The decision was unanimous between myself and the Manager
Mike Priest," said Cohen, a junior. "She knew that she had been re
moved from a game. It's not like she argued. She understood."
Cohen and Band Public Relations Director Sam Urmy, a sopho
more, stressed that Lashnits' troubles at Cal were merely the last of
a laundry list of problems, many of them involving alcohol. Urmy
said Lashnits was suspended for several weeks following an alco
hol-related incident during Band Run at the start of the year, and
was unable to perform at home football games as a result.


Erin Lashnits, suspended by the Band's leadership for the remainder of her term as Tree after
the incident, speaks with police officers at UC-Berkeley. Lashnits later admitted to being drunk
during the basketball game there, but denied having a flask and drinking in the facility.
