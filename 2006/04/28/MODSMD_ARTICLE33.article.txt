# Not quite Final Four
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CHRISTIAN TORRES STAFF WRITERS 
The season came to an abrupt end for the women's basketball
team last weekend in San Antonio. Though they made it as far as
the regional final, the Cardinal lost their Final Four bid in the last
11.5 seconds against LSU.
Down 60-59, sophomore guard Candice Wiggins got the pass in
and sprinted down the court, passing to senior guard Krista Rap
pahahn in the right corner. Rappahahn made the three-pointer
and it looked like the Card were in business. The illusion only last
ed a moment as Wiggins was called for a charge into LSU senior
guard Seimone Augustus, negating the shot. Augustus sunk two
free throws, sealing the Tigers' win, 62-59, and the Cardinal's third
straight year falling just one game short of the Final Four.
For Wiggins, out of those 11.5 seconds, it came down to one.
"I knew [Augustus awaiting the charge] was coming. We run
that play all the time," she said. "It was just too late. Just one sec
ond — one second and the pass would've been there."
Head coach Tara VanDerveer and the rest of the Cardinal were
surprised by the controversial call in the final seconds, but agreed
that it was not the deciding factor in the game's outcome.
"I'm really proud of our team and how well we competed, and
the plays that we made," VanDerveer said. "It just came down to
some execution. I think we had a great last shot, and it went in, but
we need to improve on execution throughout the game."
The Cardinal had to deal with Augustus, who was named Most
Outstanding Player for the Regional All-Tournament Team. Stan
ford attempted to double-team her — a strategy that worked
against Oklahoma's Courtney Paris two days prior — but was un
successful.
In the regional semifinal, Stanford surprised the No. 2-seeded
Sooners, both offensively and defensively. The Cardinal began the
game on a 9-0 run, and led the whole way to an 88-74 victory.
Junior center Brooke Smith led the offensive charge with a ca
reer-high 35 points, besting her 26 at UCLA earlier this season. She
was 14 for 16 from the field.
"There's no other post player in the country I'd rather have on
my team than Brooke," Wiggins said. "It makes me happy to see
her playing her best, and I'm glad the whole nation got to see what
we see every day in practice and what a great player she is."
Smith was humble about her career mark, despite praise from
her teammates and VanDerveer's constant cries to "Give the ball
to Brooke."
"My teammates did a great job of finding me when I was open,
and my shots were just dropping," Smith said.
Paris, the record-breaking Oklahoma freshman, was locked up
by Stanford's tight double-teaming rotation throughout the game.
"We wanted to be a presence in there and basically make her
work for everything she gets," junior center Kristen Newlin said.
"A great player like her we're not going to shut down, but we could
contain her."
And the Cardinal did. holding Paris to just eight points in the
first half. Although the star post ended up with 26 points after a
second-round surge, Stanford was able to fend off the Sooners,
maintaining a lead of at least six points, and as many as 19.
In the previous second round of the tournament in Denver,
Florida State had its own game plan to exploit Stanford's per
ceived lack of depth, but came up short, 88-70.
The Cardinal were disappointed that their tournament run
ended as it had the previous two years, with a close match in the
Elite Eight. However, they also made it to the regional final this
year amid low expectations as the No. 3 seed.
"If someone had told me at the beginning of the year, or in De
cember, January, or February this team was going to the Elite
Eight, I would have jumped for joy," VanDerveer said. "I can't say
I'm jumping for joy right this second, but I'm proud of our team
and how everyone improved so much.
"I think this can be a stepping stone for us," she added. "We
have a lot of people coming back, and I think they'll have higher
expectations now."
