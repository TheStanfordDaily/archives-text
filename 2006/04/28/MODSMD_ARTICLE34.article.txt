# After 15 years, A.D. Ted Leland ready to leave the Farm
## 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR OF SPORTS 
Stanford Athletic Director Ted Leland announced his
resignation yesterday, after holding the position for near
ly 15 years. Under Leland's tenure, Stanford captured 50
national championships, more than any other school in
the nation, and 11 consecutive Directors' Cups, awarded
annually to the most successful collegiate athletic pro
gram in the country.
Leland will become vice president for university ad
vancement at his alma mater and hometown school, the
University of Pacific, on Jan. 1,2006, giving the Universi
ty three months time to form a search committee and find
a replacement.
"It's been a privilege to be the Athletic Director at

Stanford," Leland said. "It's been fun to work with some
incredible coaches and athletes. I can look at each and
every coach in the face and remember a great contest that
I was privileged to watch that they participated in."
Hired as Andy Geiger's successor in June 1991, Le
land ushered in a period of unrivaled athletic success at
Stanford. The University claimed 173 conference crowns
in the Leland era and won an NCAA record six national
titles in one school year (1996-1997).
Coaches report that much of the reason for Leland's
success was his willingness to trust them with their teams.
"He's not a micromanager," said women's basketball
head coach Tara VanDerveer, who won 11 conference
championships and the 1992 national title with Leland at
the helm. "In a good way, he was very hands-off. He al
lowed me to do my job and other coaches to do theirs."

Not only has Leland overseen the tremendous suc
cesses of the past 14 years, but he leaves today's Athletic
Department in arguably its best shape ever. Last year
alone, all but nine of the Cardinal's 35 varsity programs
finished in the top 25, while women's tennis and synchro
nized swimming won NCAA crowns. The department is
similarly fiscally sound, as under Leland, assets have
grown more than seven-fold to $375 million, and $185
million has been spent solely upon athletic facility up
grades and construction.
One of Leiand's last goals before his departure is to
oversee the $85 million renovation of Stanford stadium.
"I'll stay here [to ensure] that we work with the presi
dent and provost to fund the football stadium appropri
ately, that we develop a construction schedule that makes
sense, and that we figure out a way to reseat the Stadium

in a way that works," Leland said."l've got some fun tasks
to take on."
President John Hennessy and several coaches empha
sized that Leland valued the welfare of Stanford's stu
dent-athletes more highly than any award or recognition.
"His legacy is that every single person he ran across
knows how much he cares about them ," volleyball head
coach John Dunning said.
Many students said they will also remember Leland's
legacy.
"I'm really sad to hear that Leland is going," said basket
ball player Rob Little, Class of 2(M)5. "One thing is for cer
tain. whenever I needed to talk to Ted about anything, I
did not have to wait long. That says a lot for the head of
the nation's greatest athletic department."
