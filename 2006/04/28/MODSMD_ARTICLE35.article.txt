# Charlie likes his tea

### 
A fter the excitement of last week's Prom
ZA (which, incidentally, was a riot) I'm
-Z -1- feeling a little apathetic, so I'm not writ
ing a column this week. While this might seem
like a problem, I have a plan: someone else is
going to write it for me.
An old writing partner (and object of my
eternal affections) is visiting me from England
and, having arrived in San Francisco after a
coast-to-coast trip, he's going to regale you
with his impressions of your magnificent
country; well, either that or he's going to piss
you off. Anyway, without further ado, here's
Charlie.
What is it with America and tea? I've just
driven 5,000 miles across this vast, incredible
country and I was not able to get a good cup
of tea anywhere.
I can't understand it. Tea is a wonderful,
wonderful thing. It's very simple to make, it's
not bad for your health, it's soothing,comfort
ing and reassuring and it's cheap as chips. In
England, if you visit someone's house, they
give you a cup of tea. If your cat has just died,
you have a cup of tea. If you've just got home
after a tough day at work, you have a cup of
tea. If you've just been binned by your bird
(dumped by girlfriend), you hit the pub, drink
10 pints of lager, get in a fight, steal a fridge
and pass out unconscious in the street. Then,
when you wake up, you have a cup of tea.
There is no situation that cannot be improved
by tea.
So why don't you have it here? I really
think it would make you all feel better. You
could stop worrying about tropical storms,
gun control, killer bees, the situation in the
Middle East and all the other things that get
you guys wound up. You can adopt it as a na
tional pastime, wholesale. Imagine: blacks and
whites, Republicans and Democrats, rich and
poor, all enjoying a nice cup of tea at four o'
clock every afternoon. You can all just sit
back, put your feet up, inhale the steam and
enjoy the drink from the first scalding sip to
the last sweetened swig.
Look, here's what you do. First, don't
worry about china cups, teapots, saucers, etc.
â€” all that nonsense is great if your mother's
visiting, but not actually necessary for making
excellent tea. Next, find a big mug (and not a
glass, OK?). Rinse it out if you're fussy about
germs and stuff. Boil some water in a kettle.

Put a teabag (Tetley's, if you can find it) in the
mug. Pour in the boiling water. Wait for a
minute, then stir it around a bit, remove the
bag, add a slosh of milk and two sugars and
drink the damn thing. Easy, right?
It's especially strange when you consider
the quality and variety of the rest of the menu
over here. When I had breakfast this after
noon, I was offered six different bread prod
ucts, eight different varieties of cooked egg
and 12 flavors of milkshake. Why can't I
choose to have my tea the way I like it (and,
for that matter, the bacon)? The tea was weak,
lukewarm, served in a glass and disappointing
in every possible way. At least, it would have
been disappointing if I hadn't learnt to expect
primitive, substandard, epsilon-double-minus
tea from America.
It's like a huge trans-national blind spot.
It's a terrible, terrible flaw in an otherwise
marvelous country. Across 18 states, I saw
some amazing things: an Atlantic sunrise in
South Carolina, a Pacific sunset in San Diego,
limitless desert in New Mexico, a Mardi Gras
parade in New Orleans, alligators in Florida. I
played poker in Vegas, drank absinthe with
Indians in the Navajo Nation, ate a 72 oz.
steak in Texas and visited the Met in New
York. The USA is a spectacular, dazzling and
fantastically diverse country. Amid all this va
riety, there were only two things common to
all the states: i) terrifying Christian radio sta
tions and ii) piss-poor tea.
So make some decent tea, lose the whole
Jesus thing, vote a little bit more intelligently
in 2008 and declare independence for Califor
nia. Get those things sorted and everything
else will follow.

Email Charlie Rahtz diplomat@gmail.com if
you think you can offer him a decent cup of tea;
hell be here until Tuesday. Alternatively, bother
