# Writing a thesis, writing off sociability
## 
### 
This column has been written largely be
cause my mind has been fixated,
chained to the dark throne of English lit
erature for the last six months. It will stay there
until it thinks about what it's done and real
izes the mistake it's made. Oh crap. I just
made a Gothic image with my previous
statement, thereby making me a successor
to Poe's legacy. I'm writing a thesis on Edgar
Allan Poe. He is my distant tormenter, and
with his big lightbulb-shaped head and little
mustache, he has been — from beyond the
grave — haunting me more than any one of
his other tales. I am afraid that I will be be
come the outcast, penniless, deeply de
pressed writer that was Poe. I look terrible in
a mustache.
Let's face it: Chicks don't dig Poe. If I
was going to fake being intellectual, why
couldn't I have done it for a writer that is
highly regarded as being sensitive? "Oh
you're writing on Jane Austen, oh you
sweet, sweet man." Then I'd say something
about how, yes, I think oftentimes men in
the literary community write Austen off as
an author of manners, but I know brilliance
in a woman when I see it. This would be
said, of course, while I stare at the interest
ed party's chest.
I think even if I went with someone shit
ty like whoever the hell wrote "The Note
book," I could have been rolling in the
ladies. I could have learned to say: "It was
like, the most moving book I've ever read.
Hold me and caress me, for I lack the spine
necessary to stand." But no, I went with Poe.
I make dumb life choices. This is like that
time in high school when everyone got gold
class rings but I chose one that lit up and was

also a whistle. With Poe, immediately people
think I'm a Goth. I'm not. I wear Hawaiian
shirts. Do I identify with the impotent little
squirt? No. I respect his writings.
Maybe I should have gone with one of
the sexy majors. Venture capitalism? Eco
nomics? Taxidermy? For a senior project,
working hours with the smell of formalde
hyde to stuff a dead bird at this point would
probably make me more attractive at a
party than "I'm working on proving that
Edgar Allan Poe is relevant to the average
American." I'm not the average American,
otherwise I too would walk away from the
kid with the punk T-shirt who is ranting on
about the symbolism of teeth removal and
premature burial.
I'm beginning to see the parallels that
Poe's stories have with my own life. Poe
wrote about an overly intellectualized sex
less detective who sits in his room and solves
murders in the dark. I'm an overly intellec
tualized undersexed college student who
sits in his room and murders dozens of little
cyber people in Grand Theft Auto. My de
tective work is pretty simple I guess, because
I also know who has been responsible for
killing kittens after those French film class
es.

Poe's detective had a partner in his mis
ery, and I guess I do too. He's the Watson to
my Holmes, if Watson and Holmes were bit
ter senior thesis writers that go to In-N-Out
rather than actually do work. 1 know I cite
my roommate in this column a lot, but I
have to assure the reader that he was once
cheery and sweet.Then he had a thesis. Now
I routinely use him as my id in columns, of
fering an angrier, comically belligerent
counterweight to my thinly veiled sarcasm.
We play a lot of GTA.
The problem with this whole thing is I
know that I am good at writing a thesis. I was
made for this type of work. Overanalysis of
actions made by female characters in a dark
setting is a skill I learned at Columbae par
ties. Now 1 get credit for it.
I'm used to talking about shit nobody
cares about,because that's what makes me a
good Daily writer. One month from now I'll
have this nice bound copy of pain, sweat,
deep reflection and brilliant analysis. I will
also have gotten farther in GTA than I will
have with a woman in a long, long time. The
sound my thesis makes as I throw it onto the
department's table will be a dull thud, a final
stake in the coffin of my social life, for when
I emerge, I will be some creature of the night
— a socially stunted outsider who has spent
most of his nights indoors — analyzing the
minds of people who bury their sisters alive
or murder their landlords. 1 will be finally
ready to run for the Undergraduate Senate.

Chris actually has been enjoying his thesis and
his social life couldn't be better, but saying the
opposite is a lot more fun. Send complaints to
