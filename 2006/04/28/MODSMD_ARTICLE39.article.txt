# Democrats: please don't nominate Hillary
## 
### 
If the Democrats want to win in 2008,
they shouldn't nominate Hillary for the
Presidential election.
Don't get me wrong, I love Hillary 1
think she is a brilliant campaigner. She has
already raised more money than any of the
other would-be Democratic nominees. 1
agree with all of her policy positions and
think her resentment of the Bush White
House is right on. I'd vote for her.
But, as a card-carrying Democrat, I des
perately want to win in 2008 and if the De
mocrats keep up their lackluster perform
ance of this year and nominate Hillary, we'll
have no chance.
In a CBS interview two weeks ago, Presi
dent Bush called Hillary "formidable" and
discussed the odd friendship that has devel
oped between Bush Sr. and Bill. Bob Schief
fer, who conducted the interview, added that
Hillary was angling for the nomination. Even
tually, Bush Jr. noted that if Hillary gets elect
ed we'd have "Bush, Clinton, Bush, Clinton."
Republicans, wondering what the hell their
fearless leader was doing, dispatched Republi
can National Committee Chairman Ken
Mehlman to "Meet the Press" for damage con
trol. Melhman wasted no time attacking
Hillary to reassure Republicans that no Presi
dent of theirs could endorse a woman, let alone
Hillary. Mehlman called Hillary "angry" and
said that historically the United States doesn't
elect candidates with such contempt.
Mehlman is certainly right: Hillary is
angry. No one missed her head-shaking
scowl during the State of the Union. Her at
tacks on the Bush's "plantation" White
House were both articulate and well timed.
As Maureen Dowd said in one of her recent

columns, the problem is not that Hillary is
angry, it's that she's not angry enough.
I agree with Dowd, but the country isn't
ready for Hillary and I don't think the Democ
rats really want Hillary; they just think they do.
The Democrats want Bill back. We miss
Bill. Sex scandal or no sex scandal. Bill was the
oasis in the desert of Republican presidencies.
He was articulate,brilliant and was able to take
controversial stances on Republican-owned
issues because he was so popular. Does anyone
remember that Bills approval rating actually
went up during the Lewinsky scandal?
Just last week the difference between
Hillary and Bill was highlighted at Corretta
Scott King's funeral. Without using any
notes, Bill passionately addressed and ignit
ed the predominately Black audience who
remembered why they loved Bill and the
Democratic Party just six years ago. Hillary
followed with a formulaic and, well, boring
lecture on King's historical significance. >
And maybe that's what Mehlman meant
in his remarks. It isn't that Hillary4*"angry,"
it's that she is a no-nonsenlse, driven, man
eating woman and the men of our country
aren't ready her.
Even at Stanford, where the intellectu
al and Cultural elite gather to further their per

sonal and academic education, the guys aren't
ready to be challenged by a fearless woman.
Just last week. I was hanging out with
some of the guys 1 live with who were perus
ing their group on The Facebook,'The Utter
Dominators of Females."The group, which is
all male, was evidently started in jest â€”
though I don't think all of its members know
that. The group posts stories of female hu
miliation and male macho posturing evi
dently for no reason other than pure enter
tainment. The group's picture is an over
weight woman passed out drunk and naked
on a park picnic table. And while 1 admit
some of the stuff on the site is funny, it's only
in the way that the dad getting hit in the nuts
by his son with a baseball bat on "America's
Funniest Home Videos" is funny. (The group
has already been thrown off The Facebook,
so don't bother searching for it.)
But what lies beneath the stories and pic
tures is disturbing. Have the guys of Stanford
really reached the point where it is necessary
to stroke our own egos by highlighting and
discussing the humiliating stories of women?
Especially considering that the guys I know in
the group have their own humiliating stories
which put those on the Web site to shame.
If the Democrats think Hillary can cap
ture the vote of U.S. men, and especially
young U.S. men that are supposedly more
liberal than their elders, then they are dras
tically mistaken. When it comes down to it,
my fellow countrymen are too scared of
Hillary to vote for her.
