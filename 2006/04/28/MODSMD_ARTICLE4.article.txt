edged the Beavers, 3-2, in April in
the teams' only meeting thus far. A
seventh-inning rally propelled Stan
ford to victory as the squad notched
three hits— half of the Cardinal's
hit total for the game — and a walk
to collect the go-ahead run.
Parity best describes the
Beavers' lineup, with five players
hitting above the .300 mark. Cam
bria Miranda has tallied 13 homers
with 28 RBI and a .326 average. In
the circle, ace Brianne McGowan
owns an impressive 22-4 record
with 166 strikeouts and a 1.23 FIR A
in 176 innings of work. Also in Ore
gon State's arsenal is Ta'Tyana
McElroy, who has notched a 13-3
record and 79 strikeouts in 99 in
nings.
One of the Cardinal's offensive
leaders, freshman infielder Maddy
Coon practiced with her right arm
in a sling earlier this week. She has
been experiencing a nerve-problem
in her right elbow since the fall but
should be fine to play this weekend.
Coon is hitting .354 and has col
lected a team-high nine home runs
and 32 RBI. Senior outfielder
Catalina Morris ignites the offense
with a .392 average and six homers
with 28 RBI. Freshman pitcher
Missy Penna has 139 strikeouts,
having thrown 148 innings en route
to an 18-5 record. Senior Laura Sev
erson is 7-0 with 31 strikeouts in 61
innings, and sophomore Becky Mc-
Cullough leads the rotation with a
1.67 ERA.
Stanford fell to No. 3 Arizona
last Friday, 4-1, with a three-run
Wildcat homer in the fifth making
the difference. The Cardinal re
bounded to take a 3-1 decision
against No. 7 Arizona State on Sat
urday. The Sun Devils then defeated
Stanford on Sunday by a 3-1 final.
"It was a tough weekend," Mor
ris said. "All the games were really
close, and we played well. But some
times things just didn't fall in our
favor. The lesson to take from such
good competition is to stick with
what we've been doing."
"Each team in the Pac-10 is sim
ilar, and each has good pitching,"
she added. "So we just need to build
upon what we've done so far and es
pecially what we did this previous
weekend."
