### ARAM HUR DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford Women's Leadership Conference,
to be revived this Saturday as an annual tradition by
the Women's Community Center, will focus on
"Defining Success" for aspiring young professionals.
This year's event is the first time that the Stanford
community — undergraduate, graduate, faculty and
staff—will be invited to convene and synthesize
their opinions on leadership and real-life obstacles in
the professional realm.
"Women have more choices and opportunities
than ever before, but a wage gap between men and
women in various industries still exists," said Faith
Kazmi, assistant dean for the Women's Center and
co-chair of the event.
Addressing these issues, the conference will con
sist of three interactive educational sessions, an alum
nae panel and talks by its two invited speakers Miri
am Rivera, vice president of Google, and Kathy
Levinson, former president of E*TRADE. Both are
Stanford alums.
"We wanted to identify accomplished alumnae
who could connect with current students and provide
insights about their paths from Stanford to their pro
fessional endeavors," Kazmi said.
While the event was put together amid over
whelming alumnae support and funding from depart
ments, Kazmi noted the difficulty of finding male
support.
"One challenge was finding and recruiting male
speakers to address various issues of how men can be
involved as allies," said Kazmi. "This is a goal for fu
ture conferences."
As of yesterday, organizers expected approxi
mately 60 people to attend. Online registration is
open until today.
Da Pan, senior and also co-chair of the confer
ence, expressed her excitement about the upcoming
weekend.
"As a student. I personally do not have enough ex
perience in the professional world to be an expert on
the subject, but I hope to learn a lot from the speak
ers and presenters at the conference," she said. "I
would encourage any and all interested students to
do the same."
