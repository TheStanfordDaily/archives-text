### JOSHUA SMITH INTERMISSION JO-HO 
Is Robin Williams the only
actor you know in upcoming fam
ily comedy "R.V."? Clearly, you're
not part of Generation Nick
elodeon. Singer-turned-actress
Joanna "JoJo" Levesque, a 15
year-old whose debut album has
gone double platinum co-stars as
Cassie, William's brooding daugh
ter. As Intermission sat down with
JoJo, the cute-as-a-button actress
offered milk and cookies. The very
genuine, yet undoubtedly profes
sional, JoJo discussed her roots in
the entertainment industry, Robin
Williams's body hair and GOB
from "Arrested Development."
Intermission: 1 was just talking to
your mom, and she was talking
about your move to California and
her reservations. You must have
been so driven at that point. What
was your feeling when you con
vinced her to make the move?
JoJo: I have always been so
strong-willed. There's this percep
tion of kids who are in this busi
ness of their parents pushing
them, and they're just the product
of these parents who wanted to be
stars. But that could not be further
from the truth. I have always been
so feisty and so driven and so

I ready to go
out there,
that I
was
like, J

"Mom, we live in Massachusetts.
Like, nothing goes on here, like,
please let me go. Let's go." And we
had a cousin that lived there, and
we moved in with him, and we
lived there for seven months, when
I was 11, turning 12. Before the
seven months were up, I got a
record deal, and moved back to
New Jersey. So I was signed when
I just turned 12, and released the
first album when I was 13. So it was
just a whirlwind... Thankfully, my
mom gave up her career — well,
she cleaned houses and sang at
church. She gave up her life, kinda.
EVE How has the transition from
music to movies been for you?
JoJo: I've been acting since I was
six, because 1 just like to be cre
ative. And singing since I was two
— I'd listen to my dad pull out the
guitar and sing James Taylor.
When my first album came out,
scripts started coming my way. I'm
not gonna lie and say music hasn't
made it easier to come into acting,
because it really has. The transi
tion? I don't know if I could call it
a transition because I'm still ac
tively doing both, and they're both
fun.
INT What do you say motivates
you?
JoJo: I think it's because I come
from a small town, and a lot of
people doubted me, and made fun
of me because I wanted to be a
singer. School was not really fun
for me. People disliked that I
I to be a singer, so what
es me is proving people
low was it working with
in Williams? He's such
icon.
loJo: He is! He's an icon,
he's a legend. When my
agent sent me the script
and it said Robin
Williams is attached, I
vas like, "Oh my god!" I
elt like I had to read for it
;ven before I opened up
he script. I had to audi
tion like five times, and I
really had to work hard
to get the role. They'd al
ready cast a girl actually,
so I snatched it up. It also
helped that Barry [Son

nenfeldj's daughter enjoyed my
music. But working with Robin
was incredible. He's off-the-wall.
The way you see him in stand-up
and in movies, he's pretty much
that way in real life. But what's
great about him is he's also one of
the most knowledgeable people.
He can sit down and talk to you
about politics,sports, medicine, an
imals. He's a genius.

that, because AutoTUne can work
wonders. That was Cassie singing.
INT: You were so close to having
an on-screen kiss...
JoJo: Check this out! I did, and
they cut it out! So all that uncom
fortable-ness was for nothing! It
really was uncomfortable, but
Barry cut it out, probably because

it looked so awkward. I
was so embarrassed and
nervous! And Hunter,
who plays the boy, didn't
make it any easier. But
thankly they cut it out,
so I don't need to watch
that.
INTi What do you think
distinguishes you from
Hillary Duff and Lins
day Lohan, the other ac
tresses who started
young, and now they're
singing a little bit?

INT: I hear that Robin Williams is
really hairy...
JoJo: He is! And Robin gets really
hot as well. He sweats a lot. So in
between takes sometimes he
would take off his shirt, and he's
really hairy. Like really hairy. I
mean I love him to death, but...
INT: Can you describe your char
acter from "R.V."?
JoJo: Cassie is a typical angsty
teen. She 15, and being on an
"R.V." trip with her family is not
something she's looking forward
to at all. And she's a vegetarian,
very health-conscious and very so
cially aware.
INT: I was wondering about the
two times in the movie you get to
sing — the first time in that scene
where everyone's wearing head
phones, and you kind of get to re
deem yourself during the credits
when you really get to sing.
JoJo: Barry said he didn't want it
to be JoJo the singer singing; he
wanted it to be Cassie. At the end
I got to let loose a little. But when
I had the earphones in, it was em
barrassing to watch back, because
I really suck, and I just hope peo
ple don't think I really sound like

JoJo: Well, my base is in
music. And I don't want to sound
cocky when I say this, but I'm
gonna say it. I'm a singer. I can ac
tually sing. If you come to see me
in a concert, it'll sound like it does
on the record. As far as acting, I
know a lot of people are gonna
say, "Oh, she's just another singer
tuned actress." but whatever.They
can say what they want! I'm
gonna continue to do that too, so
I'm sorry. Actually, I'm not sorry!
I'm having fun, so why not?
INT: When's your next album
coming out?
JoJo: Late summer. We're still de
ciding on the single. I've been
working with some great people...
As far as writing, I've been writing
and co-writing some stuff. I'm just
really excited. 1 can't wait.
IlVft I think I would be remiss if I
didn't ask about Will Arnett and
Tony Hale; they're in "Arrested
Development." I was so excited to
see them on screen. I was wonder
ing if you'd seen the show.
JoJo: Yeah! Will was so funny. I
like "Arrested Development."
I've seen a few episodes. Will does
such a good job playing Robin's
boss, he's just so icky. But he's re
ally good at playing that kind of
character. ,

like, J

"Mom, we live in Massachusetts.
Like, nothing goes on here, like,
please let me go. Let's go." And we
had a cousin that lived there, and
we moved in with him, and we
lived there for seven months, when
I was 11, turning 12. Before the
seven months were up, I got a
record deal, and moved back to
New Jersey. So I was signed when
I just turned 12, and released the
first album when I was 13. So it was
just a whirlwind... Thankfully, my
mom gave up her career — well,
she cleaned houses and sang at
church. She gave up her life, kinda.
EVE How has the transition from
music to movies been for you?
JoJo: I've been acting since I was
six, because 1 just like to be cre
ative. And singing since I was two
— I'd listen to my dad pull out the
guitar and sing James Taylor.
When my first album came out,
scripts started coming my way. I'm
not gonna lie and say music hasn't
made it easier to come into acting,
because it really has. The transi
tion? I don't know if I could call it
a transition because I'm still ac
tively doing both, and they're both
fun.
INT What do you say motivates
you?
JoJo: I think it's because I come
from a small town, and a lot of
people doubted me, and made fun
of me because I wanted to be a
singer. School was not really fun
for me. People disliked that I
I to be a singer, so what
es me is proving people
low was it working with
in Williams? He's such
icon.
loJo: He is! He's an icon,
he's a legend. When my
agent sent me the script
and it said Robin
Williams is attached, I
vas like, "Oh my god!" I
elt like I had to read for it
;ven before I opened up
he script. I had to audi
tion like five times, and I
really had to work hard
to get the role. They'd al
ready cast a girl actually,
so I snatched it up. It also
helped that Barry [Son

nenfeldj's daughter enjoyed my
music. But working with Robin
was incredible. He's off-the-wall.
The way you see him in stand-up
and in movies, he's pretty much
that way in real life. But what's
great about him is he's also one of
the most knowledgeable people.
He can sit down and talk to you
about politics,sports, medicine, an
imals. He's a genius.

that, because AutoTUne can work
wonders. That was Cassie singing.
INT: You were so close to having
an on-screen kiss...
JoJo: Check this out! I did, and
they cut it out! So all that uncom
fortable-ness was for nothing! It
really was uncomfortable, but
Barry cut it out, probably because

it looked so awkward. I
was so embarrassed and
nervous! And Hunter,
who plays the boy, didn't
make it any easier. But
thankly they cut it out,
so I don't need to watch
that.
INTi What do you think
distinguishes you from
Hillary Duff and Lins
day Lohan, the other ac
tresses who started
young, and now they're
singing a little bit?

INT: I hear that Robin Williams is
really hairy...
JoJo: He is! And Robin gets really
hot as well. He sweats a lot. So in
between takes sometimes he
would take off his shirt, and he's
really hairy. Like really hairy. I
mean I love him to death, but...
INT: Can you describe your char
acter from "R.V."?
JoJo: Cassie is a typical angsty
teen. She 15, and being on an
"R.V." trip with her family is not
something she's looking forward
to at all. And she's a vegetarian,
very health-conscious and very so
cially aware.
INT: I was wondering about the
two times in the movie you get to
sing — the first time in that scene
where everyone's wearing head
phones, and you kind of get to re
deem yourself during the credits
when you really get to sing.
JoJo: Barry said he didn't want it
to be JoJo the singer singing; he
wanted it to be Cassie. At the end
I got to let loose a little. But when
I had the earphones in, it was em
barrassing to watch back, because
I really suck, and I just hope peo
ple don't think I really sound like

JoJo: Well, my base is in
music. And I don't want to sound
cocky when I say this, but I'm
gonna say it. I'm a singer. I can ac
tually sing. If you come to see me
in a concert, it'll sound like it does
on the record. As far as acting, I
know a lot of people are gonna
say, "Oh, she's just another singer
tuned actress." but whatever.They
can say what they want! I'm
gonna continue to do that too, so
I'm sorry. Actually, I'm not sorry!
I'm having fun, so why not?
INT: When's your next album
coming out?
JoJo: Late summer. We're still de
ciding on the single. I've been
working with some great people...
As far as writing, I've been writing
and co-writing some stuff. I'm just
really excited. 1 can't wait.
IlVft I think I would be remiss if I
didn't ask about Will Arnett and
Tony Hale; they're in "Arrested
Development." I was so excited to
see them on screen. I was wonder
ing if you'd seen the show.
JoJo: Yeah! Will was so funny. I
like "Arrested Development."
I've seen a few episodes. Will does
such a good job playing Robin's
boss, he's just so icky. But he's re
ally good at playing that kind of
character. ,

Oh my god, she skinned Kermit for a shirt!

Is Robin Williams the only
actor you know in upcoming fam
ily comedy "R.V."? Clearly, you're
not part of Generation Nick
elodeon. Singer-turned-actress
Joanna "JoJo" Levesque, a 15
year-old whose debut album has
gone double platinum co-stars as
Cassie, William's brooding daugh
ter. As Intermission sat down with
JoJo, the cute-as-a-button actress
offered milk and cookies. The very
genuine, yet undoubtedly profes
sional, JoJo discussed her roots in
the entertainment industry, Robin
Williams's body hair and GOB
from "Arrested Development."
Intermission: 1 was just talking to
your mom, and she was talking
about your move to California and
her reservations. You must have
been so driven at that point. What
was your feeling when you con
vinced her to make the move?
JoJo: I have always been so
strong-willed. There's this percep
tion of kids who are in this busi
ness of their parents pushing
them, and they're just the product
of these parents who wanted to be
stars. But that could not be further
from the truth. I have always been
so feisty and so driven and so
