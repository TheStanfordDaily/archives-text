# Not THAT bad
## 
### JOSHUA SMITH INTERMISSION HAPPY CAMPER 
The very first scene in the in
nocuous family comedy "R.V.," in
which Robin Williams performing
a typically inane puppet show for
his baby daughter, proved recent
IMDb.com posts wrong. This
movie is not "cataclysmically bad,"
as one critic who hadn't seen the
film opined, nor is Williams's ap
pearance here, as another claimed,
akin to "Jimmy Page putting on a
Barney costume." Whereas "R.V."
is no subversive comic gem, it's cer
tainly not schlock. Instead, what
we have here is an unobjectionable
Robin Williams vehicle, plain and
simple.
Like the Chevy Chase "Vaca
tion" films of yore, "R.V." is a
straightforward family-roadtrip
movie, relying on slapstick and star
power to get by — the kind of
movie where a bona fide legend
has to chase a raccoon from an
oven (Robin Williams faces a
whole herd of the brave beasts).
There's no hint of dishonesty in the
film's lowbrow ambitions.
The setup in this one sees Bob
Munro (Williams) as having be
come, in the decade or so since the
said opening scene, a subservient
yes-man to his maleficent boss,
Todd (played with utmost hilarity
by Will Arnett, otherwise known as
the dastardly idiot GOB on "Ar
rested Development"). Bob is now
decidedly un-fun: "You were funny
and charming," says his wife
(Cheryl Hines).
Unfortunately, instead of the
Hawaiian vacation Bob has prom
ised his family in order to flip this
well-earned reputation around,
Bob is ordered to attend a meeting
in Colorado to save his job. With
out telling his mystified family why,
Bob scraps the Hawaii plans and
rents a recreational vehicle to drag
the fam along with him, simultane
ously giving the movie both its dra
matic element and its less-than-in
spired title.
Understandably, the fam is
pissed, especially the too-cool-for
anywhere-but-SoCal kids, Cassie
(Joanna "JoJo" Levesque) and

Carl (Josh Hutcherson). In any
case, the roadtrip begins, and we
soon meet the Gornickes (Jeff
Daniels and others), the inevitable
happy family serving as a foil. As
soon as we hear Papa Gornicke ask
the Munros, "Wanna hear about
the time Jesus saved us from a
twister," we know they kind of peo
ple we're dealing with.
From there, "R.V." careens
down the road, which translates
into lots of poop jokes (the Munros
baptize their house on wheels the
"Rolling Tbrd," for chrissakes).
However, the movie has enough
humorous and touching moments
to turn R.V. from mildly offensive
to, well, mildly enjoyable. The best
among the comedic scenes is one in
which every member of the family
Munro puts on headphones and
sings obnoxiously along with their
MP3 player.

This gimmick is certainly a com
mentary on what modern technol
ogy have done to family unity, and
it works surprisingly well. Indeed,
"R.V.," unlike other flicks of the
same genre, is at its best when it's
preaching. Most of the movie's
conscious comes from the charac
ter of Cassie, portrayed earnestly
and approvingly by teen-sensation
JoJo. Championing her causes in
the form of bumper stickers and
lectures, she's the liberal heartbeat
that keeps this fart-joke infested
movie alive.
Though not at all the fault of a
valiant effort by Robin Williams
(or the multiple stabs at Stanford),
the ratio of poop jokes to social
commentary is less than ideal, and
what otherwise could have been a
sleeper of a cult black comedy be
comes just another popcorn family
friendly flick.
