## Coil is Cool as Metal 
### MARK SIMON KOGAN INTERMISSION METALLURGIST 
112 or fans of the female-fronted
metal genre, the last few years have
been nothing short of barren and
depressing. Poppy and successful
Evanescence has yet to announce
an official follow up to 2(H)3's "Fall
en" and international femnie
metal powerhouse Nightwish
booted out their finger shortly
after the conclusion of their 2(H)4
"Once" tour and have yet to find a
replacement. Offerings from other
female-led bands have been sub
par at best and for all but the most
faithful, the eenre

seemed on the
brink of death.
However, after
four long years of
dormancy, veterans
Lacuna Coil have
released their sixth
full-length album ti
tled 'Karmacode"
and re-established
faith in the strug
gling genre. Hailing
from Milan, Italy
(Lacuna Coil
means "Empty Spi
ral") this: six-mem
ber metal band has
served in the
trenches as one of
the forerunners of
the female metal
Generation since

A very heavily hyped and long
awaited album."Karmacode" does
not disappoint. While keeping with
their melodic metal roots, Lacuna
Coil h;is definitely taken steps in a
different direction, experimenting
with new sounds and styles. Fans of
their last release, "Comalics." will
find a much more refined and
evolved series of songs that remind
readers of old songs, while simulta
neously striding forward.
Right from the very first track,
the album reels you in with a very
catchy, driving rocker titled "Frag
ile." This song hints at their new
sound while still retaining the
trademark qualities of the older
Lacuna Coil releases. The heavily
instrumented epic chorus and the
intricate vocal melodies that made
Lacuna Coil an international
metal success are still present in
force.
The most noticeable difference
is the shifting focus from the sub
tle strings and keyboard lines of al

bums past toward a much more
rhythm-centric writing style. The
bass/drum rhythm is more pulsing
and prominent than it has ever
been, which adds a very solid sen
sation of movement and drive to
the songs.
ITie album's first single, "Our
Truth," which was featured on the
"Underworld: Evolution" sound
track. is more evocative of songs
off of and older album, "Un
leashed Memories." However, the
addition of the more aggressive
rhythm section and much tighter
production combines to make for a
very concrete and instantly catchy
song.

Throughout the album, the
haunting vocals of front-lady
Cristina Scabbia are absolutely
captivating. Moreover, the lyrical
work is much more distinct and
mature than in past albums.
Often over-looked and defi
nitely underrated is Lacuna Coil's
male vocalist Andrea Ferro. Ferro

contrast to

songs that makes them truly stand
out.
Lacuna Coil definitely experi
ments with a few songs on the
album. I'm happy to say that for

the most part, these experiments
seem to have been successful. An
acoustically-introduced power
ballad, "Within Me" is definitely a
deviation from the usual heavy
metal sound, featuring much more
string and instrumentation work,
from classical guitars to violins and
cellos.
The track "Closer" is also a very
interesting and highly catchy amal
gamation of pop and metal. With a
leading synth line and a chorus
straight out of the 80s, it stands as
one of the more innovative songs
on the album. At the other end of
the spectrum stands "What I
Taking advantage of the new hard-

lined rhythm section,
this song is the real
head-banger of the
album and my personal
favorite track.
A nice little
Easter egg, courtesy of
the band, is the final
track, a cover of De
peche Mode's "Enjoy
the Silence." It is a fit
ting choice of covers,
performed very well as
a tribute to one of their
favorite bands.
The only real
complaint with the
album is the guitar
work. It is far from
being as experimental
and complex as it has
been in the past. While!, I

the guitars sync with the new style
very well, there is still definitely
room for additional guitar work.

of a song is "To The Edge" , but
even that is minimal at best. 1 j

tained much of
what made La

genre, rest easy: With bands like

but it has suc
cessfully re
tained much of
what made La
cuna Coil
stand out so

genre, rest easy: With bands like
Lacuna Coil taking back the helm,
femme-nietal isn't going any
where but up.
