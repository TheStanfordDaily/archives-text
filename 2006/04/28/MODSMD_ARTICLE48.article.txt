### RACHEL TORRES INTERMISSION PASTRAMI 
Allegra Goodman's short story col
lection, "Total Immersion," newly re
released by Dial Press, is worth read
ing if you, like Goodman, are ob
sessed with American Conservative
Jews, effete academics, Oxford or
Hawaii. If these things, cither sepa
rately, or in combination, do not in
terest you, then you probably would
be, like myself, completely bored by
"Total Immer-

sion." That is not
to say that the
collection does
not have any
thing worth read
ing, rather, that
some of the sto
ries are good, but
the collection of
them altogether
is tedious (which
is a surprising
outcome since
Goodman is also
bitingly funny).
One of the better
examples that
suggest what
Goodman is ca
pable of is "The
Succession."
In "The Suc
cession," we see
a lot of what

Goodman must pride herself on in
her own writing, that is, creating the
believable sense of a real micro
community by packing in lots of
characters. In this story, Goodman
provides a glimpse into the com
munity of the Martin Buber Tem
ple, a Conservative Jewish syna
gogue in Hawaii that has recently
forced the retirement of the ver

bose and prideful old rabbi,
Everett Siegel, in favor of the
young, dynamic and cowed-at
home rabbi, Barry Liebowitz, who
is hired because, as all the older tra
ditionalist temple members con
cede, "he's very good with the
young people." The temple mem
bers are gossipy and petty, and get
even more so when the temple
president and shady developer,
Steven Gottlieb, skips town, jilting
his investors, one of whom is Rabbi
Barry.

Goodman
writes all of
her characters
to be incredi
bly believ
able, to be just
like real peo
ple. The only
drawback to
this is that
some of her
characters,
like some
people in real
life, are petty
and boring.
Without tin.'
weight of ex
perience or
interest in
them, they fail
to make one
want to want
to turn the

page. There are sometimes so
many characters that they lose
their distinctness from each other,
and become just a nebulous crowd
of nebbishy observant Jews, which
is one of the drawbacks in the de
piction of the myriad temple
members in "The Succession."
The very particular socio-eco
nomic cultural-religious subset

that Goodman writes about is typ
ified by the observantly-Jewish,
self-righteously liberal academic,
Terence Glueck (he studies the
English Mannerists), who also ap
pears in other stories in the collec
tion along with a confusingly
sketched Yemeni Jewish postmod
ern poet/cab driver. Tiki Sofer.
The problem with Goodman im
mersing herself in the world of this
type of Jew. a world that oscillates
between Brooklyn childhoods,
Oxford expatriation and Hawai
ian island life (which you think
would be an intriguing set of lo
cales, but the charm wears off
quickly), is that it is so specific as
to be inaccessible, even to other
types of Jews who don't eat kosher
and go to shul (synagogue) every
Saturday morning. To this end. the
collection comes with a glossary of
Hebrew. Yiddish and Hawaiian
words, which is really useful, and is
kind of a fun idea.
One does want Goodman to write
stories that are entertaining be
yond a cultural anthropology field
study concern, that depend neither
on the reader using the collection
to decipher the eccentricities of ob
servant, self-involved American ex
pat Jews, nor depend on readers
that happen to be observant, self
involved American ex-pat Jews,
and thus find a satire of themselves
to be riotous and interesting to
read. She certainly has the creative
wit and sharpness to have the po
tential to write really fun and inter
esting things. And although read
ing the whole collection might
prove tedious for most people, a
few stories in "Total Immerision"
are at least worth a casual read
while standing in the Fiction sec
tion at Borders.
