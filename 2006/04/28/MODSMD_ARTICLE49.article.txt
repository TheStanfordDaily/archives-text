# Get Hooked on Spill
## 
### SETH SHAMBLIN INTERMISSION SPILLER 
All a song needs is a hook. Open
with simple percussion, add a bass
line, throw in a guitar riff, maybe a
chorus or voila and a pleasing if
overly conservative song is born.
Built to Spill is not interested in cre
ating songs for
Top 40 radio.

Rather than pin
ning its hopes on
the top of the
Billboard chart.
Built to Spill de
sires to capture
the emotional
range and inten
sity of a guitar's
six strings
through ten
songs on their new album.
"You in Reverse." Hie end
result has had five years to
ferment, hopefully resulting
in a heady brew of rock.
When the album opens with
minimalist percussion of "Coin'
Against Your Mind." I waited for
the strings to start coming,
and come they did.
Most artists attempt to
keep their 8 to 9 minute
opuses away from the begin
ning of their albums. Many,
like the Shout Out Louds,
save t hem for the final slot on

the disc so that they won't break the
momentum of the album. Also,
these end of album ballads serve as
a coda, a moment to reflect and
comment on the forty minutes of
music which has already been
heard, an intention displayed in the
frequent mid-track breakdown
which occurs on these grand tracks.
On "You in Reverse." Built to Spill
uses their opus as a way of foreshad
owing the next forty-minutes of
music, and what "Goin' Against
Your Mind" has to say about the fu
ture may excite you or send you
searching for the eject button.
l or me, it was endurance train
ing. Its reticence to begin got my
ears warmed up and ready to move
to the song's core, where the music
tightens and condenses, rewarding
the careful listener with repeated
listening. After more than two min
utes of jogging. Built to Spill told me
to start running, but I wasn't sure
why. The lyrics are hard to discern
without outside assistance, but Built
to Spill refuses to offer any, impo
litely omitting them from the CD's
jewel case. I could make out some
thing about "goin" against your

mind" but! already knew that.
What I wanted to know was: why
is something or someone goin'
against your mind? But as soon as I
finally figured out my question, it
was time for a rest.
A minute to catch my breath, and
some sing-song lyrics about child
hood and God as an alien, and 1 was
off running again,
trying to catch up

to guitar wailing
faster than I'm
used to going. My
ears were starting

to get tired, and I was beginning to
wonder if I really wanted to try to
make it to the end of this, or any of
the songs, on "You in Reverse."
If I hadn't agreed to review it, I
would've stopped. But you should

n't stop because the best song on the
album doesn't come until the mid
dle of the album, a well-constructed
song entitled "Conventional Wis
dom." This is a great song, the kind
of song which deserves better sur
roundings than it receives. Built to
Spill calls out for "conventional wis
dom in a world which is so uncon
ventional" here, and it's something
I'd have to ask them for as well on
much of the rest of the album.
Music shouldn't be endurance
training. Built to Spill constructs
songs by throwing in as many tan
gential thoughts as possible: a jam
session here, some whispering here,
an obstacle course in the corner
for the kids. Music can be chal-
Sl lenging and melodic. It can

push the
boundaries and
"engage the
aural network,
leaving me
wanting to listen again
and again. I may not
understand where
Built to Spill is
coming from,
having spent the
past year listen
ing to the well
crafted indie-pop of
Jens Lekman, and
Andrew Bird, and the
variety of musical allu
sions offered by the Arcade

Fire. After finishing "You in
Reverse," I retreated to my comfort
zone, spinning the new Yeah Yeah
Yeahs album (which is quite good)
and applying New Order's greatest
hits as an aural salve.
