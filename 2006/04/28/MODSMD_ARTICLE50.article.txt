# LIPS ARE ON FIRE

### KELLY PETERSON INTERMISSION FIREFIGHTER 
The Flaming Lips' new CD. "At
War With The Mystics," is as psy
chedelic as its title suggests, and all
the better for it. Those familiar
with the band won't find any tracks
as catchy or kitschy as "She Don't
Use Jelly" or "Yoshimi Battles the
Pink Robots," but won't miss them.
"At War With Ibe Mystics" truly al
lowed the band to stretch their
lyric-writing muscles. The poignant
and intelligent poetry they've cre
ated. in combination with the
groovy electronic instrumental
that take you right back to the
band's beginnings, allow this album
to emerge as one of the Flaming
Lips' best albums yet.
"The Yeah Yeah Yeah Song," the
album's first track and single, starts
us off by asking the big questions:

"If you could make everybody
poor just so you could be rich,
would you do it?" But don't be de
ceived. They may appear to be
dealing in universals, but this is a
call to action for the individual lis
tener. On top of an oddly pleasing
medley of guitar riffs, synthesizers,
hand claps and drums, Mark Coyne
asks each of us, "With

all your power, what
would you do?"
Though the perpetual
YeahYeahYeah's
would be annoying
and grating in any
other song. The Flam
ing Lips have made
them endearing and
appropriate. "The
Yeah Yeah Yeah Song"

sets up the tracks that follow, which
strive to answer some of these
questions while simultaneously

asking even big
ger and more
important ones.
The
1970's tripping
on-acid vibe
that The Flam
ing Lips exude
might suggest
an escape from
the horrors of
the modern
world. Instead
of fleeing to al
ternate univers
es, however,
they embrace
today's society
and all of its
problems. Ter
rorism is just
one of these tar
geted subjects.

In 'Free Radicals (A Hallucination
of the Christmas Skeleton Pleading
with a Suicide Bomber)," they
come face to face with a would-be
terrorist, and boldly accuse them of
becoming a "poor man's Donald
Trump." Their criticism is not ex
actly scathing, but it is intriguing;
"You're not so radical. In fact.

you're fa
natical."
The
Flaming
Lips pro
ceed to
condemn
and cri
tiq u e
plastic
surgery,

Britney
Spears, stardom and the Bush ad
ministration.
Despite relentlessly pushing
current issues, the album has a cer
tain timeless quality. Even when its
subject matters turn cold, it will still
be worth listening to for the sake of
the music. I love that the album is
so seamless and cohesive, yet can
still produce gems like "Pompeii,"
which may be one of the band's
best songs ever. There is no point in
the album at which the momentum
fizzles or the quality diminishes; in
stead, we get a steady stream of
electronic love that, at least with a
few listenings, anyone will find hard
to resist.
If you're looking for a journey
through time and space without the
aid of LSD Kool-Aid, in an album
that is uniquely American, buy this
CD. Though the Flaming Lips
aren't afraid to criticize, they leave
us hopeful in their most diverse and
adventurous album yet.
