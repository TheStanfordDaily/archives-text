## "HARD CANDY? MORE LIKE "HARDCORE CANDY" 
### WEENA PUN INTERMISSION SNIPPER 
Simply put. "Hard Candy" is a
movie about a 14-year-old girl,
Hayley (Ellen Page), and a 32-
year-old man, Jeff (Patrick Wil
son), who plan to meet after an In
ternet chat. The movie takes place
within a period of less than a day
and the events seem to be taken in
a single shot.
The movie has a surprising twist
of events as it proclaims to have in
its trailers. The opening shot is a
computer screen where Hayley
and Jeff chat as lensman3l9 and
thonggrrrrll4 and decide to meet
at Jeff's favorite coffee shop. When
they meet, Jeff, with his clean suit
and full rim glasses, does not look
like someone who would hook up
with girls over Internet. Hayley,
with her innocent baby face, does
not look that way either. But when
Jeff brushes the chocolate cake
clean off Hayley's lips with his
thumb and eats it, the audience re
alizes that he knows his way with
girls. The

switch in focus
between Hay
ley and a
"Missing"
photo on a bul
letin board
heightens the
dramatic ten
sion.
The two de
cide to move to

Jeffs house — a spooky, remote
place. He apparently lives all alone
as a photographer and his models'
pictures line the walls. Jeff and
Hayley talk about his work and the
number of models he has

slept with while he
makes her a drink. She
refuses his offer, say
ing, "You shouldn't
drink what you didn't
make." She makes her
own, handing him one as
well, then begins to un
dress for a photo shoot.
As he picks up his
camera, his vision
blurs and he passes
out.
When regains con
sciousness, he finds
himself tied to a chair.
The usual shyness and
innocence has vanished
from Hayley's face, re
placed by an insidious
look. A few lines of dia
logue from the coffee
shop ("A few doctors

think I am insane") begin to take
on new meaning for the audience
as their assumptions are turned
inside out.
The audience discovers that
Hayley is on a mission to stop pe
dophiles from attacking young
girls. In an attempt to stop him
from being a pedophile, she con
siders castrating him. With the help
of a knife and a handy medical
book that she happened have, she
conducts the "surgery." To make
things worse,she calls up Jeffs girl
friend pretending to be an officer
from the NYPD. luring her to the
house. After some intense who-is
going-to-kill-whom-suspense,
Hayley blackmails Jeff into doing
something so ridiculous that you
have to the see the movie.
It doesn't take long to discover
that "Hard Candy" is not a typical
Hollywood movie, but a movie
made by an independent filmmak
er.
The role of Sandra Oh ("Side
ways" and "Grey's Anatomy") as a
neighbor seems to have been
forcibly insert-

Ed only to make
audience won
der if Hayley is
going fail in her
mission. The
movie ends on a
note of ambigu
ity as the audi
ence is left
thinking, "Who

was telling the
truth?" Hayley, of course, seems in
sane: No 14-year-old girl in her
right mind would castrate a man
alive. But then again, she says."I
am every little girl who you ever
touched, hurt, screwed."

Throughout the film. Jeff
denies being a pedophile and
denies killing a woman. How
ever, the fact that he chooses
not to call 911 in a moment
of freedom late in the movie
points toward his guilt.
The title of the movie is as
ambiguous as the story it
self. "Hard Candy" has a
double meaning and ap
plies both to Jeff and
Hayley.The "candy" part
seems to imply that Hay
ley is a sweet young girl,
but "hard" points to her
toughness in ridding
the world of pe
dophiles. Of course,
you can't overlook the
■phallic implications in a
title with the word "hard"
in it.
