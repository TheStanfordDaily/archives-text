# This "Bee's" got sting

### RYAN LAMPE INTERMISSION SPELLOLOGIST 
Ever wondered what "Rocky" or "The Karate
Kid" would be like if you replaced boxing or
karate with competitive spelling? "Akeelah and
the Bee," a well-acted, though formulaic, family
drama cheerfully addresses this question.
Keke Palmer plays the film's namesake — a
precocious 11 year-old girl from south Los Ange
les with a natural talent for words. The principal
of Akeelah's school (Curtis Armstrong, who
plays Booger from the "Revenge of the Nerds"
franchise) recognizes her talent and. sensing an
opportunity to improve the image of his rundown
school, thrusts his prodigy into the world of
spelling bees. Akeelah is aided by the forthright
Dr. Larabee (Laurence Fishburne),a friend of the
principal on sabbatical from UCI.A. Akeelah's
success unites her neighborhood and culminates
with a spot in the Scripps National Spelling Bee,
the subject of the acclaimed 2(M)4 documentary
"Spellbound."
Writer-director Doug Atchison clearly set out
to make a film patterned after "Rocky," a movie
that made a strong impression on him when he was
10 years old. " Rocky's" theme of realizing your po
tential and taking your best shot is alive and kick
ing in this film. Akeelah is initially afraid of look
ing like a nerd in front of classmates who actively

deride scholarship. Similarly, Akeelah's mother
(Angela Bassett) seeks to discourage her daugh
ter's pursuit because she doesn't want to see her
fail.
Despite its resemblance to "Rocky," "Akee
lah" has a lot fun manipulating the conventions of
its formula. It presents a training montage that in
volves I)r. Larabee pointing out the etymology of
words on a blackboard, Akeelah and her tutor
reading books together at a park and neighbor
hood residents quizzing their young champion on
the sidewalk. It's hardly as rousing as Rocky jog
ging through Philadelphia with locals in tow, but
it's fun all the same. And if you're wondering how
"wax on. wax off" translates to spelling, the an
swer is learning to spell while jumping rope.

Of course,
the film's
dogged re
liance on for
mula means a
few tiresome
subplots, lhese
include a jilted
friend, a heavy
handed treat
ment of Akee
lah's villainous

rival (complete with an overbearing lather who
yells lines like," If you can barely beat a little black

girl, how do you expect to win the state champi
onship?"), and a tough gang leader who manages
to reveal a warmer side by the film's end.
But perhaps I'm missing the point. This is after
all, a family drama. Should I really expect an edgy
representation of south Los Angeles a la"Boyz N
the Hood" or "Hustle & Flow?" Other audience
members clearly loved the film's humor and some
of its one-dimensional characters. I must confess
that these little indulgences make the film more
entertaining even though they lessen its realism.
I lowever, what makes "Akeelah and the Bee"
work so well is its performances. Palmer is utter
ly delightful in the lead.convincingly portraying a
gifted but uncertain child. I shudder to think how
quickly the film would have foundered with a less
capable actress. Fishburne and Bassett are

also effective in their roles, helping to convey
the heart of the film — the ability to spell is
more than a skill, and excellence can unite
friends and family.
While waiting for the screening to com
mence. 1 heard a film critic bemoaning the
pointlessness of spelling bees. "These kids
spend all their time learning how to spell
words that they will never use when they
could be learning physics, astronomy or bal
let," she said. One of "Akeelah and the

Bee's" greatest achievements is that it makes this
argument seem foolish.
