### LISA KERNER INTERMISSION CARMA SUTRA 
What's more frightening: the su
pernaturaL.or reality? Driven by
this question, the independent film
"Carma" launches into a disturbing
journey of sin, greed and cold
blooded murder. The title is a pun
referring to both the philosophical
idea of karma — the cosmic law
governing cause and effect — and
the actual storyline centered an
abandoned Honda (car) that is
haunted by the spirit of a psycho
pathic killerjk dead mother (ma).
The murderer is a man named
Norm Burns, who maniacally axed
his mother. Kate Burns, to death
and then stuffed her bodyparts into
various compartments ot the car.
From Kate's eerily unsettling voice
over narration, which we rely on to
uncover key plot points, wc under
stand that she; is currently "kinda
stuck" in the cen-

the deserted car on separate occa
sions and use it for their own per
sonal needs. Car jackings, car crash
es, drug deals and murders ensue as
this chain of events grows increas
ingly horrific and claims more and
more lives. Far from a typical
thriller, "Carma" delivers a reverse
timeline with a twist; instead of
■going "Memento" on us and begin
ning at the end. Director Ray
■Arthur Wang starts in the middle
and then jumps backward, provid
ing a unique perspective on the se
quence of events. jp
The film, the feature directorial
debut of Wang, a graduate of Stan
ford University, was exclusively
screened for a small audience in
Stanford's Arrillaga Alumni Center
last Friday. Fresh off international
film festival success, Wang and se

director Wong Kar-Wai ("Chungk
ing Express") as one of his strong
influences, Wang also expressed his
interest in script-less and improvi
sational filmmaking.
"Carma" boasts quite a distinct
cast; the character who plays the
psychopathic murderer is actually
Peter Kiszka, an ex-convict who
served time in the infamous San
Quentin prison, imbuing the film
with an uncanny sense of authentic
ity. While all of thefactors do a fine
job, actress Karen Black, an Acade
my Award nominee for the film
"Five Easy Pieces" secures the
film's most enduring impression by
creating the ethereal voice of Kate
Burns. In her deep, raspy tone.
Black skillfully creates a tangible!
character even without being a visi- i
ble onscreen presence. The dia-j

take a backseat to the film's imagesj
Which seem to more directly drivel
the narrative, but the interactions
between the characters definitely
showcase Wang's dark sense
humor, adding to the sly nature of
"Carma."
The film is noticeably low budg
et, but the shadowy, slightly-mud
dled images that define its visual
style enhance more than detract
from the film's overall mood,
grounding the supernatural film in
a strong sense of realism. Wang has
an interesting eye for shot composi
tion and shows skillful use of cam
era movement, experimenting with
contrasting camera positions such
as extremely low-angle and high

angle shots. The special effects are
also quite impressive within such
mohetnry [imitations.
Although the movie is entirely
engaging and suspeQseful, there are
times when the several tangential
plotlines act as a disservice to the
driving action of the|film, often
straying too far from the central
story. This creates a bit of disorien
tation, sug.ofDstiong a second view
ing of the film would help to miti
gate the confusion.
Wang istdefinitely going some
where; he is currently nominated
ior "Indie Auteur of the Year" at
the 2006 Bare Bones Film Festival,
and has even been invited to the
Sundance Film Festival next year
on account of his second screen
play. With the help of a top Holly
wood agent, Wang is now eagerly
seeking distribution oiTCarma" to
movie theaters.
"Carma" is a unique and person
al work of art that clearly embodies
originality and talent, foretelling a
bright future for both the movie
and for the filmmaker. It's the kind
of film that is puzzling enough to
keep your mind buzfcing after the
credits roll, churning through the
indelibld images ana events in an
attempt to put all the pieces togeth
er. It'sfclso remarkable just for the
fact that it makes a green Honda
Accdn seem absolutely terrifying.
As everyone filed out of Arriilaga
into their cars after the screening,
all I could think about was how
thankful 1 was to have ridden my
bike.
