# "Untold" secrets, now portable
## 
### ERIC FORD INTERMISSION DUNGEON CRAWLER 
Ever wanted to hack and slash across
the world (or for about 5 hours on a PSP
battery) with no strings attached?
Then check out "Untold Legends:
Warrior's Code," the sequel to the
"#1 bestselling action RPG on
I the PSP system for some mo
bile gaming semi-goodness.
While playing a game
like "Warrior's Code," one
should always keep an impor
tant point in mind: There is
no story. Yes, you'll listen
to some voiceovers and
watch some cut-scenes
that are little more
than those pictures
you see at novelty art
stores that look like the
water is moving, but you
won't really care what they
have to say. "Warrior's
Code" exists only to satisfy
your deepest dungeon
crawling desires
through an experi
ence-grinding-multi-
tude of weapon-collecting
button-mashing adventure.
In this regard, "War
rior's Code" does
, an okay job of sat
isfying its gamer

audience. There are tons of environments
with multitudes of weapons and armor to
collect, in addition a wide array of cus
tomizable options for both your weapons
and armor. However, anyone outside the
hard-core audience that would enjoy this
game will most likely find an uninspired
title that simple doesn't cut it.
A quick recap for the action RPCi
uninitiated. These games focus exclusive
ly on fighting in a third person perspec
tive. Controls are simple in that players
can only move around, swing their
weapon, cast spells and drink health or
magic potions on the fly when the action
gets heavy. Hie entire point of the game is
to run through all the environments; kill
all the enemies; gain experience to level
up your character; and collect new
weapons and armor that drop off the bad
dies and improve your own set. The ap
peal of these titles comes from the as
sumed randomness of weapon drops and
the pleasure of watching your character
grow and kick more ass in the later levels.
The first issue most players will notice
is the poor-quality graphics . It would ap
pear that the developers decided to play it
safe by keeping the visual quality of every
thing on screen to a minimum in order to
allow the player to be surrounded by tons
of enemies without any hardware slow
down. In the dungeon action RPCi type of
game, slowdown would be a horrible pit
fall for gamers to deal with, and it's a good
thing "Warrior's Code" doesn't suffer

from it too much. While one can under
stand why they would keep the graphics
quality low as a result, current games like
"Grand Theft Auto" for the PSP have
shown the true potential for this system as
far as graphics are concerned, so "War
rior's Code" really has no excuse.
The music and sounds are really hit
or-miss for "Warrior's Code." There are
some areas of the game where the back
ground music will make you want to
throw your $300 portable system onto a
pillow (which will thus break the sensi
tive machine), while other times the
music is just part of the game experience,
neither detracting nor adding anything to
the game world. Voice acting is standard,
but really doesn't add much to the ambi
ence on a portable system. I*hankfully,
only the cut-scenes and a few choice in
teractions with characters have
voiceovers.
The biggest issue 1 have with "War
rior's Code" is that tries too hard to be se
rious. The story, when you get around to
actually listening to the voiceovers, at
tempts to be epic in scale but falls short
due to the dialogue (a common occur
rence with most action RPGs).This is fur
ther reflected through the graphics and
music, aspects of the game that would be
acceptable by themselves, but fall short
considering how ambitious the rest of the
game is trying to be. The developers
should have just decided to create a fun
game utilizing what they had rather than

trying to make the next
big fantasy epic. In
addition, "Warrior's
Code" offers Inter
n e t
game-1
PI a y
with
gamers
across
th e
world, but
so far I
haven't been
able to con
nect with other
players —but that
just may be mv own personal
gaming hours.
Despite the issues with "War
rior's Code" anyone with an interest
in dungeon-crawling and finding the 1
next big piece of equipment for his
characters will certainly enjoy this title.
That's the beauty of these kinds of ac
tion RPGs: All you really need is the ad
dictiveness of collection and progres
sion. Look past all the flaws of "War
rior's Code" and that's exactly what
you get. Just remember one
thing — there's no point
in being the sequel to the
#1 action RPG when that
title in question was the
ONLY one of its kind for
the system.
