## Unidentified "Toyonic Plague" infects at least 14 students Outbreak in Toyon 
### RYAN TONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Ttiesday morning, several
Toyon residents were infected with
a contagious illness. Since then,
more than 14 students in. the dorm
have come down with the unidenti
fied disease. Symptoms include
nausea, drowsiness and a general
feeling of malaise. While the specif
ic nature of the disease has yet to be
determined, Toyon staff has attrib
uted the endemic to the flu and
possibly the Norwalk virus.
Confined to her room, sopho
more Rebecca Harlow was among
the first to come down with the dis
ease.
"I opened my eyes at 4 a.m. and
felt simply terrible," said Harlow, a
Daily sports editor."From then on,
I just couldn't fall back asleep." As
the day progressed, her maladies
only grew worse.
"I was completely exhausted,"
she said. "From 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. that
day, I had to run many times to the
bathroom because I puked just
about every hour."
Plagued by a constant feeling of
nausea and loss of appetite, she re
tired to her room. Academics and
social activities ceased to occupy
her time.
"I couldn't go to classes both

Wednesday and Thursday", she
said. Instead, she crept under the
covers of bed and slept. For more
than 18 hours, Harlow ate and did
little as she drifted in and out of the
blurry boundaries of wakefulness.
Finally on the third day, she
began to show signs of recupera
tion and recovery.
"I remembered actually eating
something that day, probably be
cause I was starving from not hav
ing eaten for the two days," Harlow
said.
While she rested in her room, a
flurry of activities proceeded with
in the halls of Toyon. During the
day. Peer Health Educator Nick
Jain dispatched several emails to
calm and inform residents of the
situation. Though still unclear, Jain
and the RA's have offered to ex
plain the outbreak as the symptoms
of the flu or even possibly the Nor
walk virus, an illness with more
than 180,000 annual cases in the
United States.
According to the Center for
Disease Control, the symptoms of
Norwalk include nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, abdominal pain, muscle
aches, headache, tiredness and low
grade fever. Cases typically last 24
to 48 hours and usually subside on
their own. While there seem to he no
lasting effects,Toyon staffers are tak
ing no chances.
Residents are armed with anti
bacterial sprays for use on door
knobs and surfaces. Extra janitorial
crews have been installed to ensure
cleanliness and sanitation. As an
extra precaution,open kitchen at the
dorm has been suspended for the
time being. Eating club managers
are now serving food to the students
rather than the normal practice of

students serving themselves. Most
importantly, however, residents are
encouraged to take precautions on
their own. Regular hand-washing
and personal hygiene have proven to
be powerful defenses against the dis
ease.
As the Toyon staff continue in
their fight against the illness, Harlow
is sitting in her room. Though still a
little feeble from her ailments, she
has now returned to her normal
functions. Like most people, the
symptoms subsided after 48 hours.
When asked later how she survived,
she shrugged and said."l just tried to
make myself as comfortable as pos
sible and let the sickness run its
course."
