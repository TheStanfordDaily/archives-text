## Prof, fleshes out political language Renowned Nunberg speaks to community 
### NIRAJ SHETH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At a packed Cubberley Audito
rium yesterday, Linguistics Prof.
Geoffrey Nunberg addressed stu
dents and members of the commu
nity on the development, uses and
paradoxes of political language.
His talk touched on the issues of
propaganda, euphemisms and the
L-word ("liberal") among other
topics.
According to Charles Junker
man, dean of Continuing Studies,

which hosted the event, part of the
program's mission is to make Stan
ford professors available to the
public. While the bulk of the audi
ence were from neighboring com
munities, there were also a handful
of students in attendance.
Both found Nunberg impressive
and his talk informative.
"He looks at things you don't
usually look at and gets much more
out of it," said Roy Ogus, of Palo
Alto.
Students who attended agreed.
"His talk opened my eyes to ex
actly how pervasive propaganda is
in daily life," said senior Andrew
Gradman."He makes me want to go read
Orwell's essay on political language be
fore 1 touch another newspaper."
Nunberg hoped that his talk would
make people think about the language
they hear and use in everyday life. Asked
what he wanted the audience to take
away from the evening, he said that he
hoped they would remember "that the
political language that does the most in
sidious work is the language that goes by
without our noticing it."
Nunberg began his address with a dis
cussion of the history of political lan
guage since the 18th century. In particu
lar, he focused on the rise of the term
"propaganda" since the First World War
to describe politically motivated lan
guage and how it is being eclipsed by the
now-Ã¼biquitous use of "Orwellian."
These words served as examples to illus
trate the shifting landscape of political
language.
Tlirning to the United States, Nunberg
explained the paradox that he believes
exists in American society.
"On one hand, Americans are skepti
cal of language," he said. "[But] there is
no other country as obsessed with lan
guage." He explained that attention to the
use of words can be found throughout
American society, from politics to book
titles to everyday speech.
Given the transparency of many eu
phemisms, Nunberg presented the per
plexing question as to why Americans
would still buy into them. Euphemisms,

he explained, work on two levels. Not
only are they emotionally appealing, but
they are also useful for keeping reality at
a distance. In general, euphemisms allow
things to be identified while preventing
them from being recalled in detail.
Nunberg wrapped up his talk by exam
ining the nature of political language
today. The wide and easy availability of
information, he said, has made political
language very dynamic. While it is possi
ble to influence the use of language more
than ever before through television, radio
and the Internet, it is also easier for peo
ple to find out how words are being used.
His closing note on the use of political
labels, in particular the word "liberal,"
captured the audience's attention, and
was the focus of several audience ques
tions. He traced the rise and fall of "liber
al" over the course of the 20th century
and examined its relative unpopularity
today.
Professor Nunberg has written a new
book on the subject of the use (or disuse)
of "liberal" entitled Talking Right, which
is expected to be published this June.
Among his other works, he writes regu
larly for The New York Times' Week in
Review section and can also be heard on
NPR's "Fresh Air." He is currently affili
ated with the Center for the Study of Lan
guage and Information at Stanford as a
senior researcher and taught at Stanford
until last fall, when he moved to UC-
Berkeley. He remains a consulting full
professor of linguistics at Stanford.


Professor Geoffrey Nunberg of the Center for the Study of Language and Information gives a talk at Cubberley Auditorium on the fine politics of
modern language.
