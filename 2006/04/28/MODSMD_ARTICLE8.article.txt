sault.
Fraternity and sorority members, past, current and
future Peer Health Educators (PHEs) and other in
terested students and community members con

vened in White Plaza before embarking on the

"Tonight is a chance for us to come together to
raise awareness, shout out and make our presence

Coordinator Amanda Johnson immediately before
the event.
Sally Baird, a representative from the Sexual As
sault Prevention Program at Vaden Health Promo

where the opening ceremony was held.
The ceremony featured a cappella group Talis
man, which performed two songs, as well as a variety
of speakers.
Representatives from the YWCA Sexual Assault

Center spoke about the tragic effects of sexual assault
they had observed during their time at the Center.
"Tonight is about no longer being silent," said rep
resentative Nina Iyengar. "It's about taking back the
power and taking back the night."
PHE Coordinator Kate Bedford urged partici
pants not to be passive in the presence of demeaning,
sexist comments that are often ignored or taken as
jokes.
"Looking at all of you here tonight, I feel like I
have the power to change the community," she said.
"Together, we can make an impact."

ligious Life closed the ceremony, speaking
atwut the march's symbolism for interde
pendence as well as the triumph of hope over
cynicism.
Before the march began, Johnson ad
vised participants to "soak it all in, enjoy this
walk, but also think a lot."
Participants were given small candles to
carry during the march.

Though the march began in silence,
"along the way, it grew more to be like a so
cial thing," said freshman Theresa Zhen. "We
were just chatting and laughing — which is
how it should be, walking through these
places."
The march began in White Plaza and con
tinued down the Row. Participants then
walked down Mayfield Avenue, around part
of Lake Lagunita,and down Governor's Av
enue. The route continued down Santa Tere
sa and Duena Streets, ending at Memorial
Church where a reception was held follow
ing the event.
Coordinators said they were pleased with

the event's outcome and turnout.
"I never expected so many people to be
here tonight," Johnson said.
Participants also spoke positively about
the march.
"I think it's a real good cause and I'm just
happy to lend my support," said junior Dave
Aufhauser, president of the Kappa Sigma
fraternity.
Sophomore Jessica Zhang emphasized
the seriousness of sexual assault and vio
lence.
"I think it's important to bring awareness
to the general student body," she said.
"People don't talk about sexual violence

here, but it's a huge issue," agreed junior
Anna Rafferty. "It's not talked about so
much, so I think it's good to see this many
people come out here and recognize the
issue and recognize that there is something
we can do and that Stanford is not just a bub
ble where this doesn't happen."
"Violence against women does happen
both in the Stanford community and be
yond." said Take Back the Night Coordina
tor Stephanie Nguyen, a senior. "It is my
hope that this night will allow all those in sup
port of women and the safety of women to
come together and start building the founda
tion for a supportive community."
