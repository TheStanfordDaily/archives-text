# OFF CAMPUS
## Bursting the Stanford Bubble 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Today over 200 students, faculty, staff and
alumni will reach out to the surrounding cities as
part of Stanford's first Community Partnership
Day. Organized by the Office of Public Affairs,
the event will consist of numerous projects
touching on a variety of community service op
portunities— including food drives, habitat
restoration and tutoring.
Participants will be working with organiza

tions such as Recording for the Blind & Dyslex
ic, Ecumenical Hunger Program and the Red
wood City Education Foundation, doing service
projects ranging from working with middle
school students, preparing and serving lunch to
the homeless in Palo Alto and weeding around a
lake in Mountain View.
"We tried to hit on all different types of com
munity service," said Anna Wilson, manager and
event coordinator of Community Partnership
Day.
The Office of Public Affairs has organized

Community Day, a free University open house
held in April, for the past four years and will now
hold Community Day and Community Partner
ship Day on alternating years.
"We wanted a day that was an alternative to
Community Day, which is very expensive," Wil
son said. "We started thinking about Community
Partnership Day over the summer." According
to the Community Day Web site, the alternating
events will complement each other well, as one
invites the community to Stanford
and the other sends Stanford out to
the community.
The event will host between 10
and 12 projects, most of which will
happen off-campus on Friday.
There will he a food drive for the
Second Harvest Food Bank of
Santa Clara and San Mateo coun
ties occurring at various points on
campus, for those who cannot or do
not want to leave. Additionally, on
Saturday, there will he an all-day
renovation of a local community
venue with Re-Building Together
Peninsula in honor of National Re
building Day.
Faculty and staff members who
participate in the event during
work hours may be able to receive
compensation for up to four hours.
Participants will meet at the Oval
and be transported by bus to their
project sites.
Organizers of Community Part
nership Day hope that it will help
' foster long-lasting relationships
between Stanford and its neigh
bors.
