# Read this book and die alone
## 
### 
I will begin this column with a disclaimer: I'm a huge
fan of Dr. Phil McGraw. In the comfort of my own
home, 1 watch his television show religiously.
There's something mesmerizing about his southern
drawl, his pop-psychology catchphrases and the fact
that his face looks exactly like a baboon's ass. I just
can't get enough.
That being said, his most recent book, "Love
Smart: Find the One You Want — Fix the One You
Got," is utterly useless.This is disappointing for sever
al reasons, mainly because: a) the book was a gift from
a family member b) thousands of trees died for the
sake of Dr. Phil's mental masturbation and c) I was re
ally hoping that I might actually be able to Find the
One 1 Want by reading this book. Unfortunately. I've
gotten better love advice from the back of a box of
tampons.
The main problem is that Dr. Phil makes the egre
gious assumption that he is qualified to write a book
telling women how to find and keep the man of their
dreams. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure
that Dr. Phil has never been a single woman, let alone
a single woman who has gone on to successfully land
a male partner. If all it took to thoroughly understand
the opposite sex was a social science doctorate, the
Human Biology Department would be holding Orgy
Hours from nine to five.
So you can see why 1 might have been the teensiest
bit skeptical of chapters like "Your Inner Bride" and
"Fishing with a Net" and why I refused to fill out the
personal inventories that claimed to reveal what I was
really looking for in a man. I don't need to take a mul
tiple-choice quiz to know that I just want a guy with
both testicles intact and minimal history of mental ill
ness. Anything beyond that is just icing on the cake.
I think my favorite part of the book was the handy
"How a Man Differs from a Woman" tip sheet, which
includes priceless insights like "For a man, three pairs
of shoes are more than enough" and "When watching
TV he doesn't have to stop on every show that has
someone crying." After reading this section. I couldn't
help but wonder if Dr. Phil gathered all of his informa
tion about women by reading "Cathy" comic strips,
which, in my opinion, have done more to impede gen
der equality than beauty pageants, wet T-shirt contests
and the EZ Bake Oven combined. If you actually
walk around the office saying things like "ACK! I just
ate an entire box of chocolate and now I have a date
with Irving!" this book is for you.
I would be lying if I said that the entire guide was
worthless. It's not. It's hilarious, just unintentionally
so. For example, Dr. Phil's prescription for people who
are think they are ugly: "Baloney! Who told you that?
While that face you see day in and day out may have
worn out its welcome with you. in the eyes of the right
man, it's unique, character-filled, quirky or wise."
Look, doc. If I'm convinced that I'm the Elephant
Man with boobs, your sage advice isn't going to be
very reassuring. Or even practical: "SWF with strong
hands and quirky face seeks open-minded male for
encounters in a dark room." Yum.
Compare this book to "He's Just Not That Into
You" by Greg Behrendt and the key to a successful
guy-written dating guide becomes obvious: claim to
have some inside knowledge of the male psyche and
don't write chapters with titles like "Bag 'em.Tag 'em,
and Take 'em Home." Also, it helps if you are not a fat,
bald white guy whose idea of a wild time is reading
from The Book of Revelations. Getting dating advice
from Dr. Phil is sort of like asking Dr. Seuss about for
eign policy — the question remains, why?
I'm going to try to forget that Dr. Phil wrote this
book. I'm going to tune into his very entertaining
show every day this summer and watch him do things
like tell parents that their child is probably going to
grow up to be a serial killer and convince obese peo
ple to lose weight and start living. But the moment he
tries to tell me how to find a man, I swear to God and
all that is holy I will eat an entire box of chocolate.
ACK!
