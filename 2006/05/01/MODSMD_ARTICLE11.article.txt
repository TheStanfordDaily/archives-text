## Editorial Luck of the Draw: A matter of priorities? 
### 
Last Friday's deadline for priority appli
cations only added to the general anx
iety that surrounds the Draw. The an
nual spring housing lottery already creates
enough tension and drama, and priority ap
plications further complicate the complex
decision-making process associated with the
Draw.
Granted, the University administration
should be lauded for developing a system
that guarantees four years of on-campus
housing for all undergraduates who want to
stay on campus. Nevertheless, the quality of
housing is so variable that many students
feel anxious about it. This general sense of
apprehension associated with the Draw
hurts the integrity of the priority application
process.
We suspect that the number of priority
applications a house receives is likely de
pendent more on the availability of desir
able rooms in that house rather than genuine
interest in the theme. As always, there are ex
ceptions to this, especially for some individ
uals who identify with a particular ethnic or
community theme dorm. In general, howev
er, the decision to apply for priority status in
a given house depends on many other com
plicating factors.
In addition, priority applications are too
long and involved. Most applications involve
a personal statement, a recommendation
from a current staff member, a visit to the
house or some combination of the above.
This elaborate process is ostensibly designed
to weed out those who are not genuinely in
terested in the theme and have ulterior mo
tives in applying to be a priority resident.
However, such an involved application
process only contributes to the general anxi
ety of the Draw.
Moreover, the selection process often
feels arbitrary, perhaps as a result of the dis
proportionately large number of applicants
competing for a small number of available
slots. Worse yet, the results of the priority ap

plication are released too close to the date of
the actual Draw itself. Drawmates must
make emergency plans in advance, or scram
ble to figure out what to do if one member in
their drawgroup fails to get priority status in
a house.
The problems continue even after priori
ty residents are accepted into their various
dorms and houses. On the one hand, stan
dards need to be enforced â€” residents
should be held responsible if they do not
abide by the terms of their priority applica
tion. On the other hand, should priority resi
dents really be evicted from a dorm if they
neglect to show up for weekly priority meet
ings or fail to organize the theme event they
proposed in their applications? To do so
would only lead to chaos and turmoil within
the residences.
It is unfortunate that the current system
of priority applications is so rife with prob
lems, because theme dorms and priority
houses have the potential to make a very
positive impact on the student community,
and students should have a fair chance at liv
ing with other like-minded individuals who
share their interests.
However, there are steps that can be
taken to improve the situation. Priority ap
plications could be open earlier in the year,
allowing students more flexibility to explore
their options and more time to work on their
applications. Results of the application can
then be released at least one month before
people start to form their drawgroups.
But on a more fundamental level,
changes need to be made to the Draw itself.
If the current system of assigning housing is
so arbitrary, students will feel compelled to
manipulate this system.
Clearly, the solution is not to get rid of
priority applications altogether. What is
needed, however, is a more thoughtful and
better designed process for assigning stu
dents to housing options according to their
interests.
