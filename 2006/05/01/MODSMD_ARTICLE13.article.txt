# The 						Suns Also Rise
## 
### 
I don't know how many Suns fans there are
here at Stanford, but yesterday was a sad
day for Phoenix. No, more than sad. Yester
day was horrendous. Suns lead by five with 15
seconds left. Lakers' ball. Parker hits a three.
Suns' possession, and Nash gets the ball stolen
from him. Bryant ties it to send the game to
overtime. In OT the Suns are up by one with
six seconds left, their possession. Nash gets
into a jump-ball with the much taller Walton.
Walton gets the ball to the Lakers. With the
clock ticking the ball makes it to Bryant, who
shoots the winning shot at the buzzer.The Sta
ples Center erupts in elated pandemonium as
the Lakers win 99-98. and my wonderful
friends from Southern California begin
screaming in my ears and shaking me violent
ly in their disgusting joy. This is about the time
I begin to question God's existence.
What hurts the most is that I know the Suns
had the game so painfully near their grasp.
Twice, the Suns were winning with the shot
clock turned off. Twice. last year's (and possi
bly this year's) MVP Steve Nash lost the ball
for us. Twice, that embodiment of a talented
bad person made the clutch shot. I don't know
why it is that bad people triumph over good
people. You don't believe that Kobe is a bad
person? Here are some things his own coach,
Phil Jackson.said about him in "The Last Sea
son":
"Ask Shaq to do something and he'll say.
No, I don't want to do that.' But after a little
pouting, he will do it. Ask Kobe and he'll say.

'Okay,' and then he will do whatever he
wants."
"1 won't coach this team next year if he's
still here."
"He won't listen to anyone. I've had it with
this kid."
And what makes the Suns good people?
Raja Bell visits local elementary schools to
read to children, Shawn Marion won the
NBAs Community Assist Award and during
the holidays the Suns worked with Lift Up
America to distribute approximately 35,(XK)
pounds of chicken and 12,(MX) teddy
bears to Arizona's less fortunate. Understand
ably, I was pretty down that the bad guys had
won.
1 was getting really depressed about the
game, really torn apart. Most people (includ
ing myself) thought the game was almost def
initely over when the Suns were up by five
with 15 seconds left in the fourth quarter. It
felt so terrible because the Lakers won with
such impossible odds, when their chance of
winning was practically zero. And now be

cause of this loss, the Suns are down one to
three in the series, which means their chance
of winning the series is practically zero.
But then it dawned on me that the Suns'
current situation seemed familiar. Faced with
almost certain defeat, the Lakers made a re
markably unlikely comeback. And now, after
this tragic downfall, the Suns have the oppor
tunity to amaze everyone by making their
own, even more astounding, comeback by
winning this series.
Night fell on Sunday, suffocating me and
other Phoenix fans in darkness and despair.
But after night must follow day, and so I'll
wait and watch and pray. For though the sun
sets, it also rises. Like a phoenix from its
ashes, the sun emerges from the dirt every
day to climb to its place in the sky once more.
Watching the end of that game may have
ripped out my heart and stuffed it down my
throat, but it was really just an opportunity in
disguise. Sure the Suns lost in the most horri
ble, unnecessary way possible; sure they are
now only one game away from losing the se
ries to the Lakers. But that will just make vic
tory that much more remarkable, that much
more historic and that much more painful to
Lakers fans when the Suns win the next three
games in a row and eliminate the Lakers.
Thanks for giving the Suns a chance to shine
so brightly, LA.
