# The 						Big Sleep and Dreams
## 
### 
Now that Tom Kitty's offspring has
been born, Scientology is once again
in the news. Suri, which means "rose,
princess and edible grub found in the Ama
zon" was born a couple of weeks ago. Wel
come to the news, Suri, we'll see you again in
about 20 years when you drunkenly punch a
bouncer in the face and enter rehab.
If you think about it. Scientologists would
probably not be pleased with Stanford. Stan
ford is one of the nation's leading schools in
the studies of psychology and psychiatry. Sci
entologists believe that psychiatry is evil and
have opened a museum claiming that it is an
"industry of death." They believe psychia
trists actually kill more people than they
help, kind of like medieval barbers or Dear
Abby.
I'm sure they would be appalled at a class
like Dr. Dement's Sleep and Dreams, a class
which suggests there are psychological disor
ders that can be treated by medications. I
imagine Scientologists would likely devote an
entire wing of their psychiatry museum to the
class,"The Big Sleep and Dreams" and "Sleep
and Death" are my nominees for its name.
Scientologists believe that psychiatrists
are part of a conspiracy to take over the
world, an infinitely more boring idea for a
Dan Brown novel. Scientologists also con
test that psychiatrists have no proof their
medications actually work. They would,
therefore, likely throw Jenna Elfman up on
the screen and have her argue that Dr. De
ment's examples of restless leg syndrome
patients are actually persons who can't
reach their full potential or are being dis
rupted by the disembodied souls of former
volcano victims. Treating them with med
ications would be silly, while believing that
they are being haunted by disembodied
Thetan spirits would make more sense. Isn't
she adorable?
I was so scared when I first heard that
Dr. Dement was evil that I didn't sleep for
days for fear that he could reach me in my
dreams. Now on day four of no sleep. Sci
entology is making a lot more sense. Sci
entologists believe that psychiatrists are
bent on taking over the world. At about
hour 85 of no sleep. I realized that dentists
want South America. Also, there is a ring
ing in my head where The Man is trying to
drill for grapefruit juice.
What I find so scary is that I sat through
Dement's class and actually believed his
cheery comments, funny anecdotes and
well articulated "facts." It never occurred to
me that when he said drowsiness is red
alert, he was really trying to brainwash us
into becoming part of the conspiracy. That
KFC he gave us? It was laced with some

thing, I bet. I think his T-shirt can stare into
my mind until his cadre of sleep police get
here and take away the can opener I've
been using to keep my roommate at bay.
Dement's class usually has over 7(X) peo
ple in it.Think of it. man, that's another 700
people who claim to help people get a good
night's sleep and be healthy, but are actual
ly agents of Emperor Xenu. bent on taking
over the world and killing everyone that
gets in their way! With electroshock thera
py! And narcoleptic dogs!
Holy narcoleptic Ninja! Stanford has a
psychology major! Psychology majors often
go on to become psychiatrists! We actually
have people majoring in death! We allow
people to be trained to participate in this
false science instead of reaching their full
potential, one cash payment of 30 grand at
a time.
And think of the women! They may
make noises during childbirth. Loud noises
that could upset the baby! Why aren't they
learning from Katie Holmes, that belle of
"Batman Begins" who had a "silent birth?"
I'm sure Tom was jumping for joy about
that. Until the hospital workers restrained
him. And though they tried to sedate him,
his lawyer wouldn't allow it because he
doesn't believe in drugs like that. So instead
they just humanely bashed him over the
skull with something hard and dull — like
the script to the latest "Mission Impossi
ble." Which is why he couldn't make it to
talk today, kids.
In my sleep-deprived state, maybe I. too.
will found a religion. It will include refer
ences to galactic emperors trying to blow up
human souls using volcanoes, and I'll target
something silly to be against, like carbohy
drates and zebras. Join now, folks — with
every donation you make, you'll be that
much closer to slandering progress and di
verting national attention to yourself. Sleep
well, my followers, while my madness in in
somnia makes me believe that Dr. De
ment's T-shirt is talking to me. It's telling me
that Scientology is corduroy alert.

Chris is building a religion. He's building it bigger
