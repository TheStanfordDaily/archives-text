## Rethinking immigrant rights 
### CYNTHIA LIAO MARK LIU 
When reading or watching the news on the
massive demonstrations occurring around the
country' regarding immigrant rights, the most
frequent response to the idea that illegal im
migrants are marching for their rights is,"But
they're illegal. They're criminals. They don't
have any rights." Perhaps by entering the
United States without proper documentation,
these immigrants did break the law. However,
we would argue two things. First, labeling an
undocumented worker as a "criminal" or "ille
gal" does not take into account the economic
global factors that pushed the person to mi
grate. Second, even if they did violate a flawed
law, that one act does not give others the right
to strip them of their rights as human beings.
In the current debate about immigration
reform, undocumented immigrants are treat
ed as criminals who must amend for their tru
ancy. HR 4437, the bill sponsored by Rep.
James Sensenbrenner and passed by the
House of Representatives, would criminalize
those immigrants by making their actions a
felony. Other crimes considered felonies in
clude murder, arson, burglary and rape. Un
documented immigrants will fall into this cat
egory by virtue of their existence in the Unit-

Ed States.
Even in the Senate's Frist Bill touted by
the Editorial Board ("New immigration plan
appears pragmatic," Apr. 26) as the most
pragmatic solution, undocumented workers
who admit to using false documents to secure
employment are ineligible for legalization,
guest worker status and family visa pro
grams. This clause essentially disqualifies
most undocumented workers from the natu
ralization process. As an illegal immigrant,
how does one secure employment under
these conditions without false documents?
Not only does Congress not take into ac
count the status of undocumented immi
grants already in the United States, it also
fails to discuss the global economic factors
that cause workers in developing countries to
emigrate with or without papers. After the
North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) was passed in 1994, 1.5 million
peasant farmers have lost their livelihoods
due to the flood of subsidized U.S. farm crops
onto the Mexican market. These small farm
ers, along with other victims of global policies
put in place by U.S. corporations, searched
for opportunities that would help them es
cape their dire situation. When American
companies both push them out of their coun
try and then recruit them as cheap labor, how
can we blame workers for crossing the bor
der without sanction?
Because of these conditions caused by
NAFTA, Mexicans are willing to risk rob
bery, rape and death trying to cross the U.S.-
Mexico border. The $30 billion being

pumped into border patrol agents, motion
sensors, fences and unmanned aircrafts does
not deal with the root cause of migration. In
stead. the militarization of the border has led
to more deaths of people trying to enter the
United States. Since the stringent policing of
the border began, migrants are forced to
cross through more dangerous terrain like
the desert, causing the number of deaths to
skyrocket. In the past 12 years, there have
been 4,000 deaths, which translates to nearly
one death each day.
Ultimately, we would like to see legisla
tion that deals with the issue of immigration
holistically, starting with creating policies
that will strengthen, not undermine, Mexi
co's economy. For the 12 million undocu
mented immigrants already in this country,
we must find a way to treat them compas
sionately as people. They must be afforded
the same rights as other U.S. citizens, so they
will not continue to be exploited by horrid
working conditions — conditions only creat
ed by their need to hide in fear.
Please come and support the right of
human beings to live a life above poverty and
for others to help them. No legalities should
prevent people from these rights. At White
Plaza, there will be a rally for immigrant
rights today at noon, followed by a vigil at 8
p.m. No human being is illegal.
