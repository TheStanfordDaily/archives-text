## ASSU accepting nominations for annual awards 
### CHRISTIAN TOM STAFF WRITER 
Students who have a favorite student group or
love a certain teacher currently have the opportu
nity to express their approval.
The ASSU is seeking nominations for its annu
al VSO/Teacher awards. The ASSU awards one
cash prize to a student group and one plaque to a
teacher each year.
Nominations are now being accepted and will
remain open until May 19. According to ASSU sen
ator Anita Mukherjee, a junior, students are al
lowed to nominate as many teachers and groups as
they want.

Anyone in the student body at large is allowed to
submit a nomination. According to Mukherjee, the
awards, which have existed for at least 20 years, are
the only 'completely student-run award system to
recognize excellent professors and student groups."
Mondaire Jones, a freshman who is co-leading
the Teaching Awards, said that "close to KM) nomi
nations were received" last year.
While professors receive a plaque of recogni
tion, the winning student group will be awarded a
cash prize of either $S(X) or $ 1 ,(XX), to be used at its
own discretion. In addition, there will be a joint re
ception to honor the winners. The ASSU may also
name honorable mentions, Mukherjee said.
Jones described how student groups would be

evaluated.
"Candidates will be judged based on their suc
cess at improving the Stanford experience for this
University's student community," he said. There
will be a "particular emphasis on serving needs
that would otherwise go unfulfilled in the absence
of such a group."
Jones said the winning professor will be deter
mined "according to [his or her] quality of instruc
tion as judged by students, how the instructor assists
students in and outside of the classroom, his or her
availability and any other miscellaneous attributes
that help constitute an outstanding teacher."
