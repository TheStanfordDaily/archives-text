## ASSU accepting nominations for annual awards 
### CHRISTIAN TOM STAFF WRITER 
Students who have a favorite student group or
love a certain teacher currently have the opportu
nity to express their approval.
The ASSU is seeking nominations for its annu
al VSO/Teacher awards. The ASSU awards one
cash prize to a student group and one plaque to a
teacher each year.
Nominations are now being accepted and will
remain open until May 19. According to ASSU sen
ator Anita Mukherjee, a junior, students are al
lowed to nominate as many teachers and groups as
they want.

Anyone in the student body at large is allowed to
submit a nomination. According to Mukherjee, the
awards, which have existed for at least 20 years, are
the only 'completely student-run award system to
recognize excellent professors and student groups."
Mondaire Jones, a freshman who is co-leading
the Teaching Awards, said that "close to KM) nomi
nations were received" last year.
While professors receive a plaque of recogni
tion, the winning student group will be awarded a
cash prize of either $S(X) or $ 1 ,(XX), to be used at its
own discretion. In addition, there will be a joint re
ception to honor the winners. The ASSU may also
name honorable mentions, Mukherjee said.
Jones described how student groups would be

evaluated.
"Candidates will be judged based on their suc
cess at improving the Stanford experience for this
University's student community," he said. There
will be a "particular emphasis on serving needs
that would otherwise go unfulfilled in the absence
of such a group."
Jones said the winning professor will be deter
mined "according to [his or her] quality of instruc
tion as judged by students, how the instructor assists
students in and outside of the classroom, his or her
availability and any other miscellaneous attributes
that help constitute an outstanding teacher."
Jones added that the number of
nominations received for each can
didate will not affect the outcome.
"Each candidate nominated will
be considered with equal weight
based on the quality of the nomina
tions submitted," he said.
Students can nominate profes
sors and groups via email. Teaching
assistants and lecturers are also eli
gible for an award.
When all the nominations are
collected, they will be compiled and
sent out to the board that was creat-

Ed to announce awards. The board is
comprised of 12 students including
Mukherjee, three other senators,
two former Senate associates, the
incoming ASSU president and vice
president — juniors Elizabeth Heng
and Lauren Graham — and two stu
dents at-large.
Past winners of the VSO/Teacher
awards include Human Biology
Prof. Stan Wanat and the a cappella
group.The Harmonics, which won in
2004. Last year. Human Biology
Prof. Armin Rosencranz and the
Muslim Student Awareness
Network (MSAN) took home the
prizes.
Jones and Priyanka Goel, a jun
ior, will lead this year's project. This
year's nomination board was creat-

Ed "to ensure more uniformity
among the nominations so they can
be compared easily," Mukherjee
said.
The funding for the event comes
from the Undergraduate Senate.
The nominations form includes
basic questions about the distin
guishing characteristics of the group
or individual. Another question asks
for "an anecdote or quote that will
help us see the group or person you
are nominating in the same light
that you do."
The winning professor and stu
dent group will be selected on May
20. The Senate will approve the
selections on May 23 and the win
ners will be announced in Ihe Daily
the following day.
