## Baseball claims first Pac-10 series of the year vs.ASU Greg Reynolds throws a complete game three-hitter in Friday win 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
If this weekend's results serve as any indi
cator, senior pitcher Greg Reynolds may have
single-handedly reversed the fortunes of the
struggling Stanford baseball team. With a
sparkling complete game effort on Friday
night in the Cardinal's series opener against
Arizona State, the veteran righthander held
the powerful Sun Devils offense to just one
run and three hits as Stanford went on to claim
a 7-1 victory
But Reynolds' performance also provided
a spark that the Stanford squad seems to have
lacked for nearly two months. After their late
inning comeback attempt came up just short in
an 11-7 loss Saturday afternoon, the Cardinal
rebounded to take the series rubber match
yesterday afternoon in decisive fashion. Junior
leftfielder Jim Rapoport's inside-the-park
grand slam highlighted an eight-run Stanford
fifth that emphatically set the tone of the Car
dinal's 11 -4 series-clinching victory.
"We were in an unprecedented series
drought, especially for us," said senior short
stop Chris Minaker, whose squad had dropped
five consecutive series prior to this weekend's.
"To come out today and take a series against a
top notch team like Arizona State was huge. It
does a lot for our confidence, let alone our
record."
The Cardinal (19-19,5-10 Pac-10) entered
their Sunday showdown with the No. 16 Sun
Devils (29-16,8-7) with the series tied at one
game apiece. Stanford hurler Matt Leva
pitched well from the start, holding Arizona
State scoreless for the first three frames. But in
the fourth, the Sun Devils jumped out to a 3-0
lead on the strength of a two-run homerun
from Brett Wallace and an RBI single from
Preston Paramore.
The Stanford offense responded in the bot
tom half of the inning, as Minaker and right
fielder Michael Taylor smoked back-to-back
singles through the left side of the infield be

fore coming around to score on catcher John
Hester's double off the leftfield wall.
Senior righthander Matt Manship then
came on in relief for the Cardinal, promptly
setting the Sun Devils down in order in the top
of the fifth.
The shift in momentum continued as Ari
zona State starter Jeff Urlaub issued two walks
before hitting centerfielder Ryan Seawell to
load the bases with no outs in the bottom of
the fifth. Sun Devils' manager Pat Murphy
made a call to the bullpen, bringing in sub

mariner Brett Bruneel to face Cardinal third
baseman Chris Lewis.
Bruneel got Lewis to fly out, but Minaker
and Taylor came through again with consecu
tive singles that brought home three runs and
gave the Cardinal a 5-3 lead. Freshman Jason
Castro gave Stanford another run on a pinch
hit sacrifice fly. but the Cardinal still weren't
done. Sophomore Brendan Domaracki legged
out an infield single that reloaded the bases
and set the stage for Rapoport's heroics.
The lefthanded-hitting speedster ripped a

sinking liner to center that Arizona State cen
terfielder Colin Curtis made a diving effort to
snare. But Curtis came up empty-handed, and
as the ball skipped to the wall, it was off to the
races for Rapoport.
"I saw [Curtis] dive for it, so I knew it was
going to be a triple for sure," Rapoport said. "1
knew there was a chance [of it being an inside
the-park homer], so when I got the sign [from
third base coach Dean Stotz], I just kept com-

ing around."
As he slid safely across the plate,
Rapoport pushed the Stanford lead
to 10-3.That would prove to be more
than enough cushion for Manship,
who stymied the Sun Devils' best ef
forts at a comeback over the next
four innings. It wasn't until the ninth
inning that Arizona State managed
to push another run across the
board, but it was too little too late as
the Cardinal went on to win.
"Basically when I came in, I was
just trying to keep us in the game as
much as I could," Manship said in
reference to the approach he took
coming out of the bullpen."But after
we got our lead, I shifted gears to
trying to keep them out of the
game."
The Cardinal's win on Sunday
provided a fitting close to a weekend
that started off on an equally high
note. In his nine dominant innings of
pitching, Reynolds made only one
mistake — surrendering a fifth-in
ning solo homerun to Paramore that
accounted for the Sun Devils' only
run of the day. But the significance
of Reynolds' performance was well
noted by every member of the Stan
ford squad.
"It was crucial for us because we
have to get some momentum going
in the second half [of Pac-10 ac
tion]," said Lewis.
With games today and tomorrow
before their upcoming weekend se
ries against California, the Cardinal
now need to sustain that momen
tum. When asked what his team
needed to do to meet that challenge,
Manship's reply was simple.
"Win tomorrow," he said.
