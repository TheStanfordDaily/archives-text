## Spring game showcases potent offensive unit Edwards throws for 203 yards and two IDs as offense dominates 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
Spring football practice culminated this past
weekend with Saturday's spring game and the
official release of the post-spring depth chart.
And if spring ball is any indication, Stanford's in
for a lot of high-scoring affairs this fall.
The offense shined as much as the defense
struggled, posting nine touchdowns and 401
passing yards in the Saturday morning scrim
mage. Rising senior quarterback Trent Edwards
led the way, completing 17-of-20 passes for 203
yards and three touchdowns, two to rising sen
ior receiver Mark Bradford and the other a 12-
yarder to rising senior running back Jason
Evans.
"I think Trent Edwards is a tremendous team
player, and a real good leader for our young
players," Coach Walt Harris said. "We need to
protect him better and improve our running
game, [but] I think we improved our offensive
line play during the spring, which is encourag
ing."
Sure enough, the most pleasant surprise of
the scrimmage was the offensive line. Coaches
raved all spring about the strides made on a unit
that surrendered a league-worst 42 sacks last
season, and those improvements were evident
on game day.
In addition to providing loads of time for the
quarterbacks — Edwards and co-second
stringers rising junior T.C. Ostrander and rising
sophomore Tavita Pritchard — the line made
the running game look easy.The offense racked
up over 2(H) rushing yards on the day, and the
team's top four backs — rising junior starter
Anthony Kimble, co-second stringers Ray
Jones, a rising junior, and Jason Evans, a rising
senior, and fourth string rising sophomore
Xxavier Carter all found the endzone.
In fact, the offensive line might have found it
a bit too easy. Babatunde Oshinowo and Julian
Jenkins, Stanford's top two defensive linemen
last season, both heard their names called at the
NFL Draft this weekend — and their absence
was sorely felt.
"The youth on our defense was evident,"
Harris said. "We need to continue to get better
during the off-season, be more consistent and
physically strong on defense and be able to
compete against fast teams.
Rising senior receiver Evan Moore capped a
strong spring with two catches for 53 yards Sat
urday. A starter alongside Bradford, Moore
missed last season after injuring a hip in the sea
son-opening victory at Navy.
"Coming into the spring, I didn't know if I'd
be able to handle every practice," said Moore,
who has two years of eligibility remaining, but is
considering entering the NFL Draft if he is suc
cessful this season. "I was hoping that my hip
would hold up, and it did. It's 100 percent and it
feels great."

More than any other player, Moore is per
haps the one guy Stanford needs in the offen
sive lineup. I lis 6-foot-7 frame forces opponents
into mismatches, and the Cardinal lack proven
wide receivers behind Moore and Bradford.
Meanwhile, seven players earned post-game
