## Four former Cardinal selected 
### 
This weekend's NFL Draft will be long
remembered for the Houston Texans using
their top pick on defensive end Mario
Williams of North Carolina State — and
not human highlight running back Reggie
Bush of Southern California. And while
Stanford fans are certainly glad to have
Bush out of the Pac-lO.they will remember
this draft more for the four Cardinal who
were selected in its mid-to-late rounds.
On Saturday, outside linebacker Jon Al
ston went in the third round to the St. Louis
Rams with the 77th overall pick. At 6-foot
1, 224-pounds, the Louisiana native will
have a good shot at replicating his success at
Stanford, where he earned 29 career sacks
and All-Pac-10 recognition in each of the
last two seasons.
On Sunday, three more Cardinal went in
the draft's later rounds. First, the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers claimed defensive end Julian
Jenkins in the fifth round, with the 156 th
pick overall. At Stanford, Jenkins was a two
year starter who finished with 17 sacks and
130 tackles.
In the sixth round, defensive tackle Ba
batunde Oshinowo went to the Cleveland
Browns at the 181st slot. A two-time All-Pac
-10 honoree and three-year starter and Acade
mic All-Pac-10 selection, Oshinowo posted
143 tackles and 15 sacks at Stanford. Although
he was viewed to have first-day potential,
scouts' questions about his fitness and drive
may have slid him down to the sixth round.
In the seventh and final round, the Indi
anapolis Colts chose cornerback T.J. Rush
ing with the 238 th overall pick. Rushing
ranked sixth in the nation in kickoff return
average last season, and may be more of a
kick returner than cornerback in the NFL,
especially early in his career.
Before the four defensive players
claimed in the draft this weekend, Stanford
propelled six players into the draft last sea
son, for a two-year haul of 10 players that
ranks among the tops in the nation.
Stanford may be hard-pressed to keep up
the pace next year, however, as only senior
quarterback IYent Edwards and senior receiv
er Evan Moore (if he chooses not to return for
a fifth year) appear to be surefire selections.
