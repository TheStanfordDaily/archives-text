## Bowlsby introduced as new AD Bowlsby meets the media, sets out agenda for the department 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford's Athletics Department prides itself on
striking the delicate balance between athletic and ac
ademic excellence better than any other school in
the country; eleven straight Director's Cups speak
even more loudly when coupled the nation's tough
est athletic admission standards. On Friday morning,
the University formally welcomed the man whose
job, starting.in mid-July, will be to continue what
some describe as an impossible juggling act â€” ele
vating both on- and off-field performance while sac
rificing neither.
Bob Bowlsby, welcome to Stanford.
"Bob represents the best in professionalism and
integrity in collegiate athletics," President John Hen
nessy said. "We know he will continue that great
Stanford tradition of setting the highest academic
standards."
For Bowlsby,s4, the classic tale of a Midwest man
coming west and being successful reached its happy
ending this Tliesday, when lowa press first broke the
news of the lifelong Hawkeye State native's hire.
"I have a degree from lowa, my family has 19 de
grees from lowa, we have very deep roots in the Mid
west, and the fact of the matter is I have never been
able to get a job outside of lowa," Bowlsby joked.
"So I'm very pleased to be here."
Bowlsby stressed that his first order of business
would simply be to listen to the concerns of Stanford
coaches and administrators. Upon further question
ing, however, he identified recruiting in the light of
the stringent admissions standards, the transition to
the new Stanford Stadium and the health of the foot
ball program as top priorities.
At lowa. Bowlsby became famous for his hire of
football coach Kirk Ferentz, a then-unknown who
has become one of college football's hottest coaches
by turning lowa from a 1-10 doormat into an 11-2
conference co-champion and perennial power in just
three years.
Bowlsby expressed optimism with regard to
Stanford football, noting that he sees many similari
ties between Ferentz and Stanford head coach Walt
Harris.To prove his point, Bowlsby said that he actu
ally rejected a position as athletic director at Duke 10
years ago, partly due to his lack of confidence in its
football program.
