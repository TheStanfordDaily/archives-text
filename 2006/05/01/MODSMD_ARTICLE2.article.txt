## Bowlsby introduced as new AD Bowlsby meets the media, sets out agenda for the department 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford's Athletics Department prides itself on
striking the delicate balance between athletic and ac
ademic excellence better than any other school in
the country; eleven straight Director's Cups speak
even more loudly when coupled the nation's tough
est athletic admission standards. On Friday morning,
the University formally welcomed the man whose
job, starting.in mid-July, will be to continue what
some describe as an impossible juggling act — ele
vating both on- and off-field performance while sac
rificing neither.
Bob Bowlsby, welcome to Stanford.
"Bob represents the best in professionalism and
integrity in collegiate athletics," President John Hen
nessy said. "We know he will continue that great
Stanford tradition of setting the highest academic
standards."
For Bowlsby,s4, the classic tale of a Midwest man
coming west and being successful reached its happy
ending this Tliesday, when lowa press first broke the
news of the lifelong Hawkeye State native's hire.
"I have a degree from lowa, my family has 19 de
grees from lowa, we have very deep roots in the Mid
west, and the fact of the matter is I have never been
able to get a job outside of lowa," Bowlsby joked.
"So I'm very pleased to be here."
Bowlsby stressed that his first order of business
would simply be to listen to the concerns of Stanford
coaches and administrators. Upon further question
ing, however, he identified recruiting in the light of
the stringent admissions standards, the transition to
the new Stanford Stadium and the health of the foot
ball program as top priorities.
At lowa. Bowlsby became famous for his hire of
football coach Kirk Ferentz, a then-unknown who
has become one of college football's hottest coaches
by turning lowa from a 1-10 doormat into an 11-2
conference co-champion and perennial power in just
three years.
Bowlsby expressed optimism with regard to
Stanford football, noting that he sees many similari
ties between Ferentz and Stanford head coach Walt
Harris.To prove his point, Bowlsby said that he actu
ally rejected a position as athletic director at Duke 10
years ago, partly due to his lack of confidence in its
football program.
"In all honesty, I sat in the football stadium
and wondered if I could really live with watch
ing Florida State go back and forth and back
and forth," said Bowlsby of declining Duke's
AD post. "I just wasn't at all certain that there
was a good upside for the football program,
and I just feel entirely different about this sit
uation here."
Once a college wrestler at Minnesota's
Morehead State, Bowlsby spoke at the Arrilla
ga Family Sports Center on Friday about the
process that led him to accept the Stanford
opening.
The University had initially contacted him
to ask for input on other candidates, knowing
he was happy at the helm of lowa Athletics, a
position he has held since 1992.
But as the 13-member search committee's
investigation broadened, athletic directors
and administrators kept singing praises of a
man nationally renowned in collegiate athlet
ics for chairing the NCAA Division I Basket
ball Tournament Committee and sitting on the
U.S. Olympic Committee. Above all though,
they praised Bowlsby for leading the least
populous Big Ten school to regional and na

tional prominence in major sports — most no
tably football, men's and women's basketball
and wrestling — without the scandal that has
plagued similarly successful programs.
Intrigued, Stanford offered Bowlsby an on
campus interview. And, despite rebuffing
other schools' requests over the years, Bowls
by decided to accept this offer, adding that
Stanford's location, "its extraordinary aca
demic profile, the championships that are won
every year" and the fact that he trusted news
of the interview not to leak enticed him.
"Stanford is the only place 1 would have
considered going and I say that in all sincerity,"
said Bowlsby."lt is a place that 1 have admired
for many years. It is a place where athletic ex
cellence and academic excellence are not mu
tually exclusive, and it is a model for intercol
legiate athletics for all who care to look
around the country."
Once on campus, Bowlsby demonstrated
the values that the position demands, but the
depth of his knowledge proved the distin
guishing factor in a pool of applicants that
numbered between 50 and 100, according to
Provost John Etchemendy.

Even so, Stanford might still be searching
for an AD if Bowlsby were not, in his words, an
"empty nester."The youngest of his four chil
dren starts college at lowa this fall, and he said
that made it much easier for him to decide to
move across the country. He added that he will
live on campus at Stanford because of the high
real estate prices in the area.
But Bowlsby didn't fly out just to meet and
greet the press. After the 20-minute confer
ence, he spent the rest of his day at Stanford
meeting with key coaches and University offi
cials, before flying back to lowa on Saturday.
At the press conference, interim AD Bill
Walsh sat sandwiched between Bowlsby s
wife Candice and Coach Harris in the front
row. Bowlsby met with both men later in the
day, and Walsh announced that he will stay on
at Stanford for another year as a consultant, at
Bowlsby's request.
Softball's John Dunning, baseball's Mark
Marquess and women's basketball'sTara Van-
Derveer were among the other high-profile
head coaches attending the press conference,
while outgoing AD Ted Leland sat quietly in
the back.
