## Barnes also advances to the semis in the singles draw 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
Alice Barnes and Anne Yelsey cannot
be stopped.
The duo claimed the Pac-10 doubles
crown this weekend, taking home the same
top honors they earned last year. Senior
Barnes and junior Yelsey, the top-ranked
doubles team in the country, defeated 11 th
ranked Suzi Babos and Zsuzsanna Fodor
of California, 8-4.
"It's nice to come in as the top seed,"
Barnes said. "There's a lot of expectation
there,but that's alright. We're fine with that
because we expect a lot of ourselves. We ex
pect to win. We didn't play our absolute
best tennis, but we won it so that's fine."
"It wasn't the best we played," Yelsey

concurred."We served well,but our returns
were a little bit off. It was enough to get the
job done, though."
On the way to the championship match,
the pair knocked out Elizabeth Lumpkin
and Alex McGoodwin of UCLA and No.
21 Roxanne Clarke and Kady Pooler of
Arizona State — the only doubles team
Barnes and Yelsey lost to during the regu
lar season. They had a bye in the opening
round.
"I was pretty pleased about the fact that
we beat the ASU pair in the semis," Barnes
said."You don't want people with two wins
over you, so we set the record straight."
This is actually the third time Barnes has
won the Pac-1() doubles championship; she
partnered with Erin Burdette, Class of'os,
to do so in 2004.That same pairing won the
NCAA doubles championship the follow
ing year — but individual achievement is

not what the duo are seeking.
Rather, they want to perform well
for the team.
" l"he win today was important to
get momentum for the team event,
not so much for the individual
NCAA competitions," Barnes said.
"It's really important, especially
when you get into NCAAs, to get
that doubles point.The only time the
team has lost, in my opinion, was be
cause we lost the doubles points."
Sophomore Lejla Hodzic and
Nguyen also competed in the dou
ble championship draw. ITiey beat
Sabrina Capannolo and Jessica
Leitch of ASU in the first round, but
then lost to Babos and Fodor in the
second.
In singles action, freshman Jessi
ca Nguyen was the runner-up in the
invitational draw. She dropped the
finals match to Ashley Joelson of
UCLA, 3-6,6-2,3-6.
"It was a tough tournament, but
it was nice to get to play singles
matches, since 1 didn't get to that
much this season," Nguyen said. "It
was good for experience. I played re
ally well in the semifinals, but 1 am a
little rusty. Today was just a long
match and we were both really tired.
Her style of play is that she's a de
fensive player. I was on offense the
whole time, and then she just pulled
through"
The Cardinal had less success in
the singles championship draw, de
spite their heavy representation in
the field. Three players from each of
nine Pac-1() schools get bids to the
championship draw; a coaches com
mittee selects five additional players
to round out the 32-athlete field.
ITiis year, two of those at-large bids
went to Stanford players so that the
Cardinal's second through sixth
courts were all represented in the
championship draw. Senior Amber
Liu, who plays at the No. 1 position,
did not participate at Ojai.
Barnes, ranked fourth in the ITA
rankings, advanced the furthest, but
lost 6-3, 2-6. 2-6 to lOth-ranked
Amanda l ink of USC in the semifi
nals. Barnes beat Fink three weeks
ago at Stanford and has been the
singles runner-up at Ojai the past
two years.
"One of the biggest problems
was I didn't serve that well," Barnes
said of her Saturday loss. "But she's
a good player, she played well, she
beat me, that's fine. It's . not such a
big deal that a Stanford player didn't
win it. I'm certainly not worried; it's
the team event that matters. If we
play USC in the team event, we'll
beat them. We'll be ready for
NCAAs, which is what matters."
Yelsey and junior Theresa Logar
lost in the quarterfinals round of the
singles championship draw. Sopho
more Celia Durkin lost to Fink in
the second round, and sophomore
Whitney Deason lost in the first
round but won her match in the
back draw.
Compared to last year, when all
four Cardinal players entered in the
singles championship draw ad
vanced to the quarterfinals and
three made it to the semifinals, the
overall performance of the team at
the individual competition could be
seen as somewhat of a disappoint
ment. Barnes, however, fiercely dis
puted this idea.
"It doesn't really matter," she
said. "We still won t he overall tour
nament title, based on total team
points from the weekend. It was not
such a dominant performance like
last year, but that's OK. We have a
couple people injured, and
[Nguyen] did well in the invitation
al. In general. I thought we did fine.
Barnes repeatedly emphasized
the importance of the team event at
NCAAs. which kicks off at Stanford
on May 12.
"Over the years, sometimes
we've had a good Ojai and some
times we haven't. You can't tell from
Ojai how we're going to do at
NCAAs. One thing's for sure — we
have a lot of players who are totally
completely focused on the team
event, which is what I'd much rather
have. Other schools have players
who are focused on the individual
glory of Ojai, but we care much
more about the team event."

Barnes and Yelsey lost to during the regu
lar season. They had a bye in the opening
round.
"I was pretty pleased about the fact that
we beat the ASU pair in the semis," Barnes
said."You don't want people with two wins
over you, so we set the record straight."
This is actually the third time Barnes has
won the Pac-1() doubles championship; she
partnered with Erin Burdette, Class of'os,
to do so in 2004.That same pairing won the
NCAA doubles championship the follow
ing year — but individual achievement is

Yelsey and Barnes, the No. 1 doubles team, took down the No. 1 1 Cal team for the title.
not what the duo are seeking.
Rather, they want to perform well
for the team.
" l"he win today was important to
get momentum for the team event,
not so much for the individual
NCAA competitions," Barnes said.
"It's really important, especially
when you get into NCAAs, to get
that doubles point.The only time the
team has lost, in my opinion, was be
cause we lost the doubles points."
Sophomore Lejla Hodzic and
Nguyen also competed in the dou
ble championship draw. ITiey beat
Sabrina Capannolo and Jessica
Leitch of ASU in the first round, but
then lost to Babos and Fodor in the
second.
In singles action, freshman Jessi
ca Nguyen was the runner-up in the
invitational draw. She dropped the
finals match to Ashley Joelson of
UCLA, 3-6,6-2,3-6.
"It was a tough tournament, but
it was nice to get to play singles
matches, since 1 didn't get to that
much this season," Nguyen said. "It
was good for experience. I played re
ally well in the semifinals, but 1 am a
little rusty. Today was just a long
match and we were both really tired.
Her style of play is that she's a de
fensive player. I was on offense the
whole time, and then she just pulled
through"
The Cardinal had less success in
the singles championship draw, de
spite their heavy representation in
the field. Three players from each of
nine Pac-1() schools get bids to the
championship draw; a coaches com
mittee selects five additional players
to round out the 32-athlete field.
ITiis year, two of those at-large bids
went to Stanford players so that the
Cardinal's second through sixth
courts were all represented in the
championship draw. Senior Amber
Liu, who plays at the No. 1 position,
did not participate at Ojai.
Barnes, ranked fourth in the ITA
rankings, advanced the furthest, but
lost 6-3, 2-6. 2-6 to lOth-ranked
Amanda l ink of USC in the semifi
nals. Barnes beat Fink three weeks
ago at Stanford and has been the
singles runner-up at Ojai the past
two years.
"One of the biggest problems
was I didn't serve that well," Barnes
said of her Saturday loss. "But she's
a good player, she played well, she
beat me, that's fine. It's . not such a
big deal that a Stanford player didn't
win it. I'm certainly not worried; it's
the team event that matters. If we
play USC in the team event, we'll
beat them. We'll be ready for
NCAAs, which is what matters."
Yelsey and junior Theresa Logar
lost in the quarterfinals round of the
singles championship draw. Sopho
more Celia Durkin lost to Fink in
the second round, and sophomore
Whitney Deason lost in the first
round but won her match in the
back draw.
Compared to last year, when all
four Cardinal players entered in the
singles championship draw ad
vanced to the quarterfinals and
three made it to the semifinals, the
overall performance of the team at
the individual competition could be
seen as somewhat of a disappoint
ment. Barnes, however, fiercely dis
puted this idea.
"It doesn't really matter," she
said. "We still won t he overall tour
nament title, based on total team
points from the weekend. It was not
such a dominant performance like
last year, but that's OK. We have a
couple people injured, and
[Nguyen] did well in the invitation
al. In general. I thought we did fine.
Barnes repeatedly emphasized
the importance of the team event at
NCAAs. which kicks off at Stanford
on May 12.
"Over the years, sometimes
we've had a good Ojai and some
times we haven't. You can't tell from
Ojai how we're going to do at
NCAAs. One thing's for sure — we
have a lot of players who are totally
completely focused on the team
event, which is what I'd much rather
have. Other schools have players
who are focused on the individual
glory of Ojai, but we care much
more about the team event."
