doubles team in the country, defeated 11 th
ranked Suzi Babos and Zsuzsanna Fodor
of California, 8-4.
"It's nice to come in as the top seed,"
Barnes said. "There's a lot of expectation
there,but that's alright. We're fine with that
because we expect a lot of ourselves. We ex
pect to win. We didn't play our absolute
best tennis, but we won it so that's fine."
"It wasn't the best we played," Yelsey

concurred."We served well,but our returns
were a little bit off. It was enough to get the
job done, though."
On the way to the championship match,
the pair knocked out Elizabeth Lumpkin
and Alex McGoodwin of UCLA and No.

Arizona State — the only doubles team
Barnes and Yelsey lost to during the regu

we beat the ASU pair in the semis," Barnes
said."You don't want people with two wins
over you, so we set the record straight."

won the Pac-1() doubles championship; she
partnered with Erin Burdette, Class of'os,
to do so in 2004.That same pairing won the
