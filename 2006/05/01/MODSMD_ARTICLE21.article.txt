# Stanford football: Stay tuned
## 
### 
Last year, I anticipated a
bounce-back year for basket
ball, featuring the return of
Chris Hernandez, Dan Grunfeld
and Matt Haryasz for their senior
seasons. It was going to be awesome.
But after the disappointment
that was the basketball season, I
learned one thing: Stanford sports
are unpredictable.
Having said that, I turn my atten
tion to the football team and what I
can expect for next season — a task
that will not be easy given the
amount of off-season changes.
The team has given us a look into
next season with the traditional
spring game on Saturday, shedding
light on what we can expect in the
year to come.
We learned that the return of Evan
Moore coupled with a healthy Mark
Bradford. Kelton Lynn and Michael
Miller could mean some big business
for Trent Edwards and the passing
game. On Saturday, Stanford quarter
backs went 36-of-42, throwing for
over 4(X) yards and nine touchdowns.
Even the rushing game got into it.
Anthony Kimble ran just under 100
yards with a touchdown.
This stellar offensive perform
ance could mean one of two things:
Either we will have an unstoppable
offense, or our defense which will be
unable to stop anything. In my opin
ion, it is a little of both.
Although it was exciting to watch
Edwards tear up the field. 1 can only
hope that other Pac-10 quarterbacks
do not have as easy of a time. The de
fensive unit lost six of 11 starters in
the off-season, including Jon Alston,
Julian Jenkins, T.J. Rushing and Ba
batunde Oshinowo — all key play
ers that have kept Stanford compet
itive during games in which the of
fense has struggled.
This year's inexperienced de
fense will likely prove to be the key
factor in deciding whether or not
Stanford will qualify for a bowl
game this season.
But players are only going to be
one of the many changes in store for
the Cardinal this season. The new
football stadium, for example, could
perhaps revitalize the troops.lTie $85
million project is supposed to create
a more intimate atmosphere,possibly
nursing the team to a winning record.
I also look forward to Walt Har
ris' second season as coach. I feel as
though a full year with the Cardinal
has made the players familiar with
the system, and Harris familiar with
the program. Hopefully, he can con
tinue what has already been a posi
tive trend under his reign.
In addition, a change in leadership
will dictate the prosperous Stanford
Athletics program this season.Ted Le
land is no longer the athletic director.
Instead. Bob Bowlsby. formerly of the
University of lowa, will be responsible
for Cardinal sports. Although his im
pact on next season will likely be min
imal. we will soon find out if Leland
has been putting something in Stan
ford athletes' drinks to propel them to
11 straight Director's Cups.
Finally, we must never forget the
god of injuries. Let us pray that he is
merciful this season.
There is a lot going into this foot
ball season and I cannot begin to di
vine the 2006 record.. But even if we
don't come up with the wins, hopeful
ly we will see some good football from
a solid offense. Edwards has the tools
this season,so let's see what he can do.
