## 
### ANDREW LOMELI STAFF WRITER 
The No. 6 Stanford Softball team found
itself in a place where it normally thrives
yesterday, loading the bases with no outs
and trailing by four runs in the final in
ning. Clutch hitting has been the Cardi
nal's strength this season with several wins
coming in late frames.
But the fairy tales ended abruptly for
Stanford (34-12, 7-8 Pac-10), as the
Beavers' Brianne McGowan fanned the
final three batters, leaving the bases
loaded to secure the 4-0 Oregon State (37-
8, 9-5 Pac-10) victory in Corvallis. Mc-
Gowan struck out a season-high 11 bat
ters and allowed three hits for the after
noon while her Stanford adversary Missy

Penna notched six strikeouts and surren
dered six hits in six innings.
"We've been struggling a lot lately,"
sophomore pitcher Becky McCollough
said. "We're not used to losing. It's a tough
conference. Hopefully, this is a turning
point for us in the season that we can build
on heading into the postseason."
A leadoff walk and three hits gave the
Beavers a 2-0 lead in the fourth before
Lisa Allen knocked a two-run home run in
the fifth, allowing OSU to go up for good.
4-0. Jackie Rinehart, Lauren Lappin and
Maddy Coon accounted for the Cardinal's
only three hits.
On Saturday three-run sixth-inning
rally propelled the Cardinal to a 7-5 win
over the Beavers Saturday. Senior out
fielder Catalina Morris notched her sev

enth homer of the season in the game's
first at-bat. Lisa Allen then collected a
grand slam in the bottom of the first, giving
the Beavers the 4-1 advantage after one.
Lappin knocked her first round-tripper in
the third, scoring Rinehart in the process
to bring the Cardinal within one, 4-3.
Power hitting was the trend for the af
ternoon, as the Beavers' Mia Longfellow
added a dinger of her own in the fifth to
establish the 5-3 Oregon State lead.
Sophomore Erin Howe opened the
sixth inning with a double to left field and
advanced to third on a single from sopho
more Tricia Aggabao. I\vo more singles
from Anna Beardman and Rinehart
drove in Aggabao and Howe to tie the
game at 5-5. With two outs, Lappin
and Coon each added singles to
score Beardman and Rinehart as the
Cardinal took a lead they wouldn't
relinquish, 7-5.
"Giving up a grand slam is never
an easy thing to rebound from," Mc-
Collough said. "Catalina set the
tone early with her home run, and it
was tough. It became a battle the

whole day."
McCollough threw seven innings,
fanning six and surrendering five
hits. Brianne McGowan had four
strikeouts and five hits in three in
nings, while Ta'Tyana McElroy
notched two strikeouts and gave up
four hits in four innings. Lappin went
3-3 with three RBI, and Rinehart
went 3-4 with one RBI.
Stanford dropped a devastating
9-0 decision to unranked Oregon
(21-10, 3-10 Pac-10) in five innings
on Friday. The Ducks' Alicia Cook
hurled her first no-hitter of the sea
son, nabbing just one strikeout in

five innings. Oregon collected four
runs in the third inning and added
five more in the fifth off a Joanna
Gail grand slam to end the game
early. Penna allowed five hits with
one strikeout in two and one-thirds
innings, and Severson added one and
two-thirds innings, giving up seven
hits with one strikeout.
Stanford hosts San Jose State (22-
22, 10-4 Western Athletic Confer
ence) at Smith Family Stadium this
Tbesday at 7 p.m. The Spartans rode
an eight-game winning streak before
being swept by Santa Clara in two
games last Wednesday.
