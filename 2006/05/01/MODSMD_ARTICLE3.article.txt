# STUDENTS RALLY IN S.F.
## Religious leaders, politicians speak at Day of Darfur 
### BEN EPPLER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
If we are a superpower in any meaningful sense, if we aspire to any kind of
moral authority, then shame on us if we don't do anything to end this genocide.

— Congresswoman LYNN WOOLSEY (D-CA)

An estimated 5,000 people turned out
in San Francisco yesterday to protest the
United States' and United Nations' inac
tion toward the genocide in Darfur. The
event was organized by the Stanford
branch of Students Taking Action Now:
Darfur (STAND) and sponsored by nu
merous religious, student and humanitar
ian groups.

The Day of Darfur included a vigil on
the Golden Gate Bridge and a rally at
nearby Crissy Field. Events at Crissy Field
featured speeches by religious leaders,
politicians, aid workers and Sudanese wit
nesses to the carnage. Several musical
artists, including Stanford's a cappella
group Talisman, entertained the audience
during breaks between speeches.
Demonstrators arrived early in the
morning to link hands along the Golden
Gate Bridge for five minutes of silence in
recognition of the genocide. Police esti
mated that 5,000 people participated in
the vigil. The crowd flashed peace signs at
passing cars and received honks of agree

ment from many drivers as they made
their way to Crissy Field.
"Ladies and gentlemen, you've inter
fered in a genocide that the world is
watching. Thanks for being here," said
Rabbi Henry Shrcibman, the event's mas
ter of ceremonies, citing statements by
Sudan's president that worldwide
protests are hindering his government's
activities.
Jewish. Muslim and Christian religious
leaders took the stage and emphasized
the need for all people to act against the
atrocities occurring in Sudan.

People protesting the genocide in Darfur march across the Golden Gate Bridge yesterday as part of a day-long series of events in San
Francisco that included a vigil and a rally that featured many different speakers in a nearby park.
"If it impacts a human being, it is
our issue," Executive Director of the
American Muslim Voice Samina
Faheern Sunclas said
"Let's not get into ideologies,"
boomed Reverend Cecil Williams of
the Glide Memorial United
Methodist Church. "That won't help
us at all. What will help us is reach
ing out to each other."
Other speakers, including U.S.
Congresswomen Barbara Lee (D
-CA) and Lynn Woolsey (D-CA),
as well as Muadi Mukenge, a pro
gram officer of the Global Fund
for Women, outlined a plan of
action.
Mukenge emphasized that "UN
forces should have an explicit man
date to protect the people of
Darfur" rather than act as monitors
as they do under the current man
dates.
"Africa is tired of observers to
massacre, rape and execution." she
added.
Protestors went further and
advocated immediate North
Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) intervention, marching and
chanting, "What do we want?
NATO! When do we want it? Now!"
Lee advocated divestment from
companies doing business in Sudan.
"We've got to hit Khartoum

where it hurts —in their pocket
books," she said.
She praised the California public
retirement fund for its recent deci
sion to withdraw its investments
from American multinational cor
porations with locations in Sudan.
"You're saying and we're saying,
'Not another dime to this murder
ous regime,'" she declared.
Although they advocated differ
ent methods, the speakers were
united in calling for immediate
action.
"If we are the superpower in any
meaningful sense, if we aspire to any
kind of moral authority, then shame
on us if we don't do anything to end
this genocide," Woolsey said.
Stanford students and nearby
community members traveled to the
city on buses that left campus at 7
a.m. and 8 a.m and arrived in time
for the vigil. ITiis gave many stu
dents the opportunity to join the
protest.
"For whatever reason, the con
ventional wisdom seems to be that
U.S. foreign policy and humanitari
an interventions are mutually exclu
sive," junior Zach Denibo said. "I'm
here because 1 believe that's a mis
take. and 1 hope that we can change
that."
Dembo's optimism was shared

by other students — all seemed
assured that the protest was having
an effect.
"If we get enough media atten
tion and enough people know
what's happening there, then
humanitarian intervention will be a
lot more likely," freshman Emma
Laughlin said.
STAND National Coordinator
and Stanford junior Nikki Serapio
also projected an air of confidence
as he delivered the event's closing
address.
"We know the architects of geno
cide have a plan, but so do we." he
said, calling on demonstrators to
continue the fight by writing letters
and calling members of Congress.
He praised a recent letter to
President George W. Bush that was
signed by multiple foreign policy
experts, and urged immediate
NATO deployment.
"I hope you never forget that
your job is nothing less than saving
people's lives," he added.
Darfur, a region of western
Sudan, has been the site of numer
ous atrocities perpetrated by the
Sudanese army and government
backed militias since 2003. Over
400,000 people have already been
killed, and speakers said that 500
more die each day.
If we are a superpower in any meaningful sense, if we aspire to any kind of
moral authority, then shame on us if we don't do anything to end this genocide.
