### BEN EPPLER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
If we are a superpower in any meaningful sense, if we aspire to any kind of
moral authority, then shame on us if we don't do anything to end this genocide.

â€” Congresswoman LYNN WOOLSEY (D-CA)

An estimated 5,000 people turned out
in San Francisco yesterday to protest the
United States' and United Nations' inac
tion toward the genocide in Darfur. The
event was organized by the Stanford
branch of Students Taking Action Now:
Darfur (STAND) and sponsored by nu
merous religious, student and humanitar
ian groups.

The Day of Darfur included a vigil on
the Golden Gate Bridge and a rally at
nearby Crissy Field. Events at Crissy Field
featured speeches by religious leaders,
politicians, aid workers and Sudanese wit
nesses to the carnage. Several musical
artists, including Stanford's a cappella
group Talisman, entertained the audience
during breaks between speeches.
Demonstrators arrived early in the
morning to link hands along the Golden
Gate Bridge for five minutes of silence in
recognition of the genocide. Police esti
mated that 5,000 people participated in
the vigil. The crowd flashed peace signs at
passing cars and received honks of agree

ment from many drivers as they made
their way to Crissy Field.
"Ladies and gentlemen, you've inter
fered in a genocide that the world is
watching. Thanks for being here," said
Rabbi Henry Shrcibman, the event's mas
ter of ceremonies, citing statements by
Sudan's president that worldwide
protests are hindering his government's
activities.
Jewish. Muslim and Christian religious
leaders took the stage and emphasized
the need for all people to act against the
atrocities occurring in Sudan.
