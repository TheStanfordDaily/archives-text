# THE 						COMMUNITY
## Partnership Day a huge success New biennial event introduced to complement Community Day 
### AMIT ARORA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With more 200 volunteers and 10 local
community projects, Stanford's first Com
munity Partnership Day proved to be a suc
cessful endeavor.
From assembling booklets with the Com
munity Breast Health Project to tutoring
students at Redwood City middle schools,
participating faculty, staff, students and
alumni contributed their time to a number of
different volunteer programs.
To attract staff to volunteer at the various
sites, the University qualified shifts as re
lease time, funding the 225 University volun
teers for up to four hours of work. Trans
portation was also provided in order to facil
itate volunteer needs.
Associate Director of University Com
munications Kate Chesley described the
event's success in an email to The Daily.
"We hoped to attract at least 200 volun
teers. and we met that expectation," she said.
"We also hoped to have at least 10 projects in
local communities that were substantial and
worthwhile and that represented a wide
range of interests, from education to the en
vironment to homelessness. We did that, as
well."
Organizers introduced Community Part
nership Day this year to function in coordi
nation with Community Day. an open-house
event on campus that attracted 12,000 visi
tors last year. On the event's Web site. Asso
ciate Vice President and Director of Univer
sity Communications Alan Acosta described
the motivation for the new program.
"Through Community Day, we've en
couraged our neighbors to visit us on campus
to enjoy faculty lectures, music performanc
es, art displays, a health fair, children's activ
ities and the like," he said. "We want to com
plement that open house by encouraging
faculty, staff and students to go off campus
and become more involved in the surround
ing communities."
Chesley echoed Acosta's message and de
scribed the importance of promoting active
exchange between the University and the
surrounding community.
"In order to meet its mission,
Stanford must create successful
partnerships with surrounding com
munities and the people living
there," she said. "We are not an
oasis, and we shouldn't be. We affect
the surrounding communities, and
they affect us. The best way to con
front area challenges such as traffic,
housing, economic development
and environmental sustainability is
through earnest cooperation."
Specific Community Partnership
Day events included the Ecumeni
cal Hunger Program, where volun

teers sorted and organized food, and
the Urban Ministry Lunch, where
participants served hot lunches to
the homeless. Chesley shared her
personal experiences with the activ
ities.
"I personally visited Shoreline
Park, the Community Breast Cancer
Project, the Ecumenical Hunger
Program, Community Association
for Rehabilitation and the Redwood
City Schools," she said. "Each of the
projects 1 visited went wonderfully.
For instance, when 1 visited Shore
line Park, the University volunteers
were making so much progress
weeding that the city employees had
to call for a bigger truck."
Volunteers on campus also con
tributed to the event through a food
drive program.
"Hundreds of people on campus

contributed nonperishable food
items to the campus-wide food drive
we sponsored as part of the day,"
Chesley said.
Chesley attributed the overall
success of the event to its volunteers
as well as the planning of Communi
cations Specialist Anna Wilson, the
Community Partnership Day's lead
organizer.
"If you were to ask me why the
day was successful, I would point to
the efforts of the volunteers," she
said. "You can always count on the
kindness, integrity and commitment
of Stanford people. We saw tons of
evidence of that on Friday."
The success of the 2006 Commu
nity Partnership Day has encour
aged organizers at University Com
munications to host the event bien
nially.
