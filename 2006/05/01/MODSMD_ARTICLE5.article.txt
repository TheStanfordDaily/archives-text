## Students hear from startup experts Speakers touch on the benefits, hardships of entrepreneurship 
### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
"What's cool is never profitable, unless
you're Steve Jobs" observed Om Malik,
senior writer of Business 2.0. Malik was one
of several experts who presented to a full
audience at Kresge Auditorium on Satur
day for the Startup School.
The event was hosted by Y Combinator,
a seed funding firm based in Mountain
View and Cambridge, Mass., and the Busi
ness Association of Stanford Engineering
Students (BASES). More than 620 Stan
ford students and next-generation
founders attended to learn how to start a
company.
In October 2005, the Startup School was
offered for the first time at Harvard to train
students on the best practices, including
those for incorporating, applying for
patenting, selecting co-founders and ob
taining angel and venture capital funding.

Because of its association with Silicon Val
ley entrepreneurship, Stanford was a logi
cal location to host another Startup School.
"Google. Yahoo. HP. Sun. You name it;
the most successful high tech companies
today originated within a 20-mile radius
from any Stanford dorm," said junior Dim
itri Dadiomov, co-president of BASES, a
student organization of undergraduates
and graduates from all academic back
grounds that facilitates entrepreneurship.
"BASES has long brought Stanford stu
dents the opportunity to hear from a wide
variety of speakers," Dadiomov said. "The
Startup School was designed to let people
know about the full value chain of starting
a company today, from entrepreneurs to
venture capitalists to business develop
ment folks, from Fortune 500 corporations
to legal minds. The fact is, if you start a com
pany you must know about all these fields
or else you risk a lot, and it is our responsi
bility to provide a forum for that kind of
knowledge transfer."
Like Dadiomov, Y Combinator partner
Paul Graham felt that Stanford was a
natural place to hold the Startup
School because it serves as the
"lynchpin of Silicon Valley."
"Most of the audience already
seemed convinced they were going
to start a startup," Graham said.
"There's a new Internet boom hap
pening now and attitudes have
changed just since last year. In addi

tion, Stanford students seem to be
more entrepreneurial than Har
vard and MIT students. People
graduating from college on the east
coast still assume they need to get a
job."
The one-day crash course fea
tured advice from Caterina Fake, co
founder of Flickr, Joe Kraus, co
founder of Excite and Jot Spot, Chris

Sacca, head of special initiatives at
Google and Page Mailliard and
George Willman of the law firm Wil
son Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati.
All the Startup School presenta
tions are available via podcast on the
Web site, http://www.startupschool.org,
so that anyone interested can be ex
posed to the knowledge shared at the
event. Podcasts of the Entrepreneurial
Thought Leader seminar, a weekly
class featuring speakers from the high
tech world that BASES organizes, are
also available. All podcasts are avail
able at http://etl.stanford.edu.
Beau Hartshorne was in the audi
ence at last fall's Startup School, ap
plied to Y Combinatory Winter
Founders Program, moved to Silicon
Valley and started an online picture
editing company named Pixoh in De
cember 2005.
"The energy from the speakers
and attendees at the Startup School
kept me up at nights for the next
week wondering why I hadn't al
ready started working," Hartshorne
said. "So I did and 1 only regret not
starting a year earlier."
Working in Silicon Valley was very
beneficial to Hartshorne as he start
ed his company.
"When you contact people at
other startups, big companies or
open-source projects there's a good
chance you can meet for coffee a few
minutes away," he said. "Those meet

ings are what create opportunities for
your startup down the road or for you
if your startup doesn't work out. I
don't think this is possible anywhere
else in the world."

Hartshorne's advice to entrepre
neurs is to "just start and keep going."
"Determination and optimism
stand out as personality traits that
founders seem to have in common,"

he said. "Every time someone re
minds you that nine out of 10 start
ups fail, remember that 8.9 of those
probably failed because the
founders gave up."
