"What's cool is never profitable, unless
you're Steve Jobs" observed Om Malik,
senior writer of Business 2.0. Malik was one
of several experts who presented to a full
audience at Kresge Auditorium on Satur
day for the Startup School.
The event was hosted by Y Combinator,
a seed funding firm based in Mountain
View and Cambridge, Mass., and the Busi
ness Association of Stanford Engineering
Students (BASES). More than 620 Stan
ford students and next-generation
founders attended to learn how to start a
company.
In October 2005, the Startup School was
offered for the first time at Harvard to train
students on the best practices, including
those for incorporating, applying for
patenting, selecting co-founders and ob
taining angel and venture capital funding.

Because of its association with Silicon Val
ley entrepreneurship, Stanford was a logi
cal location to host another Startup School.
"Google. Yahoo. HP. Sun. You name it;
the most successful high tech companies
today originated within a 20-mile radius
from any Stanford dorm," said junior Dim
itri Dadiomov, co-president of BASES, a
student organization of undergraduates
and graduates from all academic back
grounds that facilitates entrepreneurship.
"BASES has long brought Stanford stu
dents the opportunity to hear from a wide
variety of speakers," Dadiomov said. "The
Startup School was designed to let people
know about the full value chain of starting
a company today, from entrepreneurs to
venture capitalists to business develop
ment folks, from Fortune 500 corporations
to legal minds. The fact is, if you start a com
pany you must know about all these fields
or else you risk a lot, and it is our responsi
bility to provide a forum for that kind of
knowledge transfer."
