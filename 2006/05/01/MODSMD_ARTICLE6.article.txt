# AFTER STANFORD
## Female alumnae speak to students Conference focused on women in the workplace 
### CASSIE HARVEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Whether to learn about the spe
cific obstacles facing women in the
workplace, or to glean insight on
how to transition from education to
the workforce, nearly 70 students
settled into Ttesidder Union on Sat
urday to hear from some of Stan
ford's most illustrious female alum
nae.
Hosted by the Women's Commu
nity Center, llie Women's Leader
ship Conference was an all-day
event that featured three interactive
educational sessions, two invited
speakers and an alumnae panel. Par
ticipants at the day's events were all
affiliated with the University and
were all female. The theme of the
conference was "defining success."
No stranger to success, Miriam
Rivera, vice president of Google and

this year's keynote speaker, began
her talk by stating that she was
"struck with abject terror" when she
learned of the Conference's theme.
She questioned the clarity she could
provide to others, as she still grapples
with her own definition of success.
Rivera's talk, spanning nearly 40
minutes, was at some points tragic, at
others funny — but always candid.
Her rise to the top, emblematic
of the American rags-to-riches
story, began in Chicago. One of six
children born into a poor family in
the racially-charged atmosphere of
1960s Chicago, Rivera gave a mov
ing account of the early hardships
she endured. Her father was abu
sive and her mother struggled to
find paying work with a third-grade
education.
The family's combined income
never exceeded more than $10,000 a
year. She recalled having to move to
one of Chicago's worst neighbor
hoods after her mother lost a job.

Miriam Rivera, the vice president of Google and a Stanford alum,
speaks at The Women's Leadership Conference on Saturday. The
event was hosted by the Women's Community Center.
"We were living in the kind of
place where when you drove in, rats
just scattered," she said. "In the win
ter, when it snowed, we had to put
plastic hags under the door to prevent
the snowflakes from coming in."
The hardship bred rugged deter
minism in the young Rivera.
"In our family, the dream was to go
to college and lead a better life than
our mother could provide," she said.
"I experienced early on the low ex
pectations people had of me as to
what I could amount to. In Chicago, at
the time, it was thought my most like
ly outcome was to become pregnant
at 16.1 fueled myself a lot on anger in
those years. I wanted to show people
what I could do."
Rivera said that the tough child
hood circumstances taught her a lot of
skills that would help her later in life.
"I learned resourcefulness from
pocketing the 50 cents my mother
gave me to go to the library," Rivera

said. "I skipped the bus, walked the
three blocks to the library and I used
the money to buy ice cream."
After receiving a scholarship to at
tend boarding school on the East
Coast, Rivera moved on to Stanford,
imbued with "a sense that California
was the land of opportunity." She said
she worked hard and the results
began to pay off.
When she studied overseas, Rivera
realized just how far she'd come.
"I went to museums and saw
places I'd only ever seen in books,"
she said. "These were places I just
could have never imagined going as a
child."
Nevertheless, Rivera admitted
there were times she felt adrift. When
junior year rolled around, she had no
idea what she wanted to major in.
Drawing laughter from the crowd,
she described how she chose:
"I read Stanford's course catalog
from cover to cover, making checks
next to classes I found interesting,"
she explained. "Then I went back and
counted the number of checked
classes in each department. I found
that sociology and psychology re
ceived the most, so I resolved to focus

on social psychology."
Rivera also attended Stanford Law
School and Stanford's Graduate
School of Business before joining up
with Google, where she would eventu
ally become the company's Vice Pres
ident. In spite of Rivera's remarkable
success story, she remained guarded
when it came to defining success:
"I think definitions of success
change over time," she said. "Going
into my 4()s, I am beginning to re-assess
what is different about my life now. In
my 3()s it was about my career. I don't
know if my 4()s will be about that."
Rivera said she planned to take a
summer sabbatical to reassess "what is
most important to [her] at this stage in
[her] life," and to spend more time with
her family. She also warned listeners
about the temptation to equate suc
cess with accomplishments and mate
rial things, especially at a young age.
"We hire a lot of people [at
Google] right out of Stanford." Rivera
said. "Sometimes what I find is —
well, there's an attitude: i went to
Stanford and I expect to do the most
important,exciting things now.' Often,
there is not the sense of having to
work hard to get ahead. You have to

do well at the small things first, before
you get the big, exciting projects. But
people want excitement, the accom
plishments— the sense of success
now."
Rivera offered an alternate gauge
of success, based on how one chooses
to lead his or her life.
"Being grateful, mindful of others,
growing personally, showing grati
tude, treating people well — these are
things that are important to me," she
added. Rivera said she thought a per
son who demonstrated those qualities
would lead a successful life.
Finally, Rivera tackled more di
rectly the issues confronting women
in the workplace. Despite the enor
mous gains women have made in the
workplace, Rivera said obstacles and
double standards still exist.
"Often these visions of the 'perfect
wife' [and] the 'perfect woman' bur
den women," she said. "They are vi
sions that arc manufactured by our
media and products of our culture.
And they do not speak to the incredi
ble variation and temperament of
women as a group. The notion of
motherhood is the biggest burden
I've encountered in my professional

life, this situation where society says
"this is what a good mother is, this is
what a good mother does."'
Rivera also said there are sacri
fices that working mothers have to
make.
"You might miss the first time
your child walks, the first time your
child talks," she said. "You will miss
the everyday stuff, like seeing them
have fun in gymnastics class. That's
just the reality of working a 10-hour
day."
But speaking to the double stan
dard at work, she added,"No one ever
says to a man. 'You work 60 hours a
week. How do you manage with a
family?' But often they ask you this as
a mother. And the answer I offer is,
'You just do.'"
Conference-goers were mostly un
dergraduates, and all were female.
Many said they enjoyed the confer
ence's structure, the garden-variety
aspect of it, being able to pick and
choose which educational sessions to
attend based on individual interest.
Katrina Hazucha,a freshman, said
that what attracted her to the confer
ence was that it addressed challenges
endemic to women in the workplace.

which, she said, "most business pro
grams at Stanford fail to do."
"The family aspect is something
that is important to me, and it's not
something that I think is valued as
much at Stanford" Hazucha said.
"I've found people [here] feel that
they can't have a relationship, can't
have children until they're much older
because they need to focus on their ca
reer. I think there's a little bit of dis
connect there about what college
sometimes tells women, that kids
don't fit into the picture, that they
have to work for 1(X) hours a week.
That's not a model I want for myself."
Nina Qi. a senior, attended the con
ference for slightly different reasons. Qi
has an investment banking job lined up
for next year, but said she recognized
that it was very much what her parents
— and society — wanted her to do.
"I wanted to hear the anecdotes of
successful women and how they found
their careers," Qi said.
"The speakers talked a lot about
how a lot of it is socially constructed
and the ways you can break out of
that," she added. "It is a message that
in the future I think could be very use
ful for me."
