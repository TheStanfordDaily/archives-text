# AFTER STANFORD
## Female alumnae speak to students Conference focused on women in the workplace 
### CASSIE HARVEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Whether to learn about the spe
cific obstacles facing women in the
workplace, or to glean insight on
how to transition from education to
the workforce, nearly 70 students
settled into Ttesidder Union on Sat
urday to hear from some of Stan
ford's most illustrious female alum
nae.
Hosted by the Women's Commu
nity Center, llie Women's Leader
ship Conference was an all-day
event that featured three interactive
educational sessions, two invited
speakers and an alumnae panel. Par
ticipants at the day's events were all
affiliated with the University and
were all female. The theme of the
conference was "defining success."
No stranger to success, Miriam
Rivera, vice president of Google and

this year's keynote speaker, began
her talk by stating that she was
"struck with abject terror" when she
learned of the Conference's theme.
She questioned the clarity she could
provide to others, as she still grapples
with her own definition of success.
Rivera's talk, spanning nearly 40
minutes, was at some points tragic, at
others funny â€” but always candid.
Her rise to the top, emblematic
of the American rags-to-riches
story, began in Chicago. One of six
children born into a poor family in
the racially-charged atmosphere of
1960s Chicago, Rivera gave a mov
ing account of the early hardships
she endured. Her father was abu
sive and her mother struggled to
find paying work with a third-grade
education.
The family's combined income
never exceeded more than $10,000 a
year. She recalled having to move to
one of Chicago's worst neighbor
hoods after her mother lost a job.
