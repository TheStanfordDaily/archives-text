## Poll shows concern for children Bay Area residents care most about the safety of kids 
### CLAY BAVINGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite the media's focus on is
sues such as illegal immigration and
the war in Iraq, a recent survey
showed that the well-being of chil
dren is the major concern among
Bay Area residents.
The poll was commissioned by
the Lucile Packard Foundation for
Children's Health. In a press release
published on April 28, the Founda
tion stated that the survey was con
ducted in the hopes of determining a
"baseline of attitudes of Bay Area
residents towards children's issues."
Respondents were questioned
about many issues, including the cost
of living, the well-being of seniors
and children, health care and illegal
immigration. Among 11 such topics,
the well-being of children troubled
respondents the most. In fact, over
70 percent of those surveyed said
they were "extremely concerned"
about the issue.
The survey, which was conducted
by the Field Research Corporation,
found that three children's issues —
Internet and media influence, edu
cation and unhealthy eating — are
of greatest concern to residents.
One surprising result of the sur
vey was the consistency with which
respondents of different race, politi
cal affiliation and parental status an
swered the questions. Although the
Latino population expressed the
greatest concern for the well-being
of children, all demographic groups
cited children as their chief concern.
"Our polling continues to show
that parents and non-parents alike
place a very high priority on the
well-being of children compared to
other issues," Senior Vice President
of Field Research Corporation
Mark DiCamillo said.
However, the survey also found
that the public is not aware of some
issues w' ich should be of great con
cern.
"Thi results highlignt areas of
childre s health that are priorities

for the local public," said Andy
Krackov, director of public informa
tion and electronic media for the
Foundation. "The findings also illus
trate that some emerging issues
need greater public awareness."
Asthma and depression, for ex
ample, were found not to trouble the
respondents, although an ever-grow
ing number of children are affected
by these chronic illnesses.
According to Krackov, people
should be especially worried about
emotional problems because "re
search shows the strong connection

between emotional issues like de
pression and a child's health and
ability to succeed in school."
The most commonly cited cause
of problems was schools. In fact, 50
percent of respondents stated that
schools are the main cause of many
problems with children,such as poor
health, deficient education and in
volvement in gangs.
Many respondents strongly sup
ported the use of tax money to im
prove schools and establish benefi
cial after-school programs, such as
sports leagues and drama groups.
