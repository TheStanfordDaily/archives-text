## A 						new kind of STREET SMART Members of a Student Initiated Course converse with unhoused Bay Area residents, rethink homelessness 
### MARIE-JO MONT-REYNAUD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Have you ever seen a man drink him
self to death, a young runaway white lady
or a schizophrenic man's sudden violent
behavior?" asks one Stanford student who
wished to remain anonymous but spent
winter break in a crack den in the Tender
loins district of San Francisco. "Statistics
are one thing... seeing it for yourself is an
other."
This is one of the many experiences
that students bring to the Student Initiated
Course titled "The Man on the Street and
Other Myths: Confronting the Face of
Hornelessness," being offered for the first
time this quarter.
The course leaders, sophomore Aaron
Zagory and junior Anh Pham,lead discus
sions every Monday on topics ranging
from medical issues to the criminalization
of hornelessness.
This past week,course sponsor Dr. Lars
Osterberg spoke to the class about public
health problems surrounding horneless
ness. Osterberg, the medical director of the
Arbor Free Clinic that provides medical
services to the underinsured, says that the
biggest issue facing the Bay Area's home
less is access to medical care.
"I find it striking and I honestly don't
understand why we don't care for the most
vulnerable population that needs it the
most," he says.
The class of 20 students — seven had to
drop because it was too popular — is also
attended by a man named Norm Carroll,
who was formerly an unhoused resident of
Palo Alto himself.
There has been some discussion sur
rounding the use of the word homeless as
opposed to unhoused. "Homeless implies
that you don't have a place you call home,"
Carroll says. "That term is not accurate.
They are always members of community,
not just drifters, here today, gone tomor
row. Some of them were born in Stanford
Hospital and they graduated from Palo
Alto High School. Where else would they
go?"
Carroll adds to the variety of perspec
tives brought to bear on the class. He used
to write for a Stanford publication called
"Street Forum," offering his thoughts on
social justice issues in the Bay Area in a
column called "The View From The Curb."
An outspoken activist for the unhoused,
he has served as an advisor to the Commu
nity Working Group board and even ran
for Palo Alto City Council in 2005.
Carroll's grandparents became home
less as a result of the 1906 earthquake. Born
into hornelessness, Carroll made a move to
turn his life around about five years ago.
"I was starting to see how bad it was for
some people, and I didn't want to go that
far down," he says of his decision to be
come an advocate for the homeless. "I saw
that, inside, I had it in me to help myself
and to help other people."
Now living at the Palo Alto Hotel
thanks to supportive housing from the
"Off Ilie Streets" program, he directs his
attention to the "housed" community of
the Bay Area by participating in such pro
grams as the new hornelessness course.
In last Monday's discussion of medical
issues, Carroll offered some insight into
another challenge for the unhoused seek
ing treatment in response to one student's
question about shame.
"Sometimes, they don't want to go be
cause they smell," he says."And in a small
crowded waiting room, when the reason

everyone is going like this" — he holds his
nose — "is you. it's really hard."
Among several problems facing the
homeless, Osterberg says that they have a
higher incidence of chronic cardiovascu
lar disease and significant problems with
diabetes and high cholesterol due to their
diet.
A native of Sweden, Osterberg also
called for change in the American health
care system, advocating a more preventa
tive approach, especially when it comes to
the homeless. According to Osterberg,
paying upfront for their health care and
mental health services would cut down on
costs of later emergency room visits.
Osterberg's recommendations are in
formed by more than eight years of work
with Palo Alto's homeless. One of the
homeless people he worked with was even
a Stanford student.
"My bias has changed after hearing
their life stories," he says."It could happen
to anyone. I've met people who were very
wealthy, one man was even a professor.
Sometimes, it could be because of abuse or
illness. They are there by no fault of their
own, but rather because of a failure of the
safety net, or no safety net at all. Some
were sick and couldn't work,and health in
surance is tied to work. It is such a Catch
-22 that it is set up that way."
By sharing these experiences, Oster
berg, Carroll, Zagory and Pham are work
ing to break the stereotypes that many
have about the homeless.
"Many people don't know that the
largest growing homeless population in
the Bay Area is families," Osterberg says.
Pham adds, "I hope that [the students')

perceptions and expectations have changed
and that their criteria of who belongs to their
'community' has extended to include social
ly marginalized individuals of the homeless
population. Most of all, I want them to have
a privileged experience of being able to meet
and talk with the homeless."
Indeed, the class advocates a hands-on
approach to learning, offering, among
other opportunities, the chance to go on
walks in downtown Palo Alto with Night
Outreach, and to work with the Palo Alto
Drop-In Center.
Even in the smallest gestures, the leaders
and students seek to be agents of change.
"[We] hope to gain a better understand
ing of the issue as a whole so we can start
making some changes at the individual
level even if it means greeting the panhan
dler on University and Ramona instead of
pretending he/she doesn't exist," says jun
ior Cerisa Ignacio, a member of the Stu
dent Initiated Course.
Students and leaders alike say they real
ly appreciate the forum that a Student Initi
ated Course provides. Zagory and Pham
got together to form the course after an Al
ternative Spring Break (ASB) trip last year.
"I began seeing homelessness as a part
of and related to so many other social jus
tice issues," Zagory says of his ASB experi
ence.
"The most rewarding aspect of teach
ing the course is to discover that there are
other students who are as passionate, or
even more, as we are about the homeless
community and its issues," Pham says.
However, the course is challenging on
many levels, according to Zagory. Present
ing large amounts of information about

homelessness as an academic subject is dif
ficult to balance with looking at it as
"something that affects people on a deeply
personal and individual level."
One student who wished to remain
anonymous seemed somewhat critical of cer
tain elements of the class' approach.
1, l wanted to see how Stanford students,
ambitious students who probably had never
even seen the unhoused in a different view
than pitiful creatures while they were volun
teering, could teach a class on homelessness,"
he says.
Certainly, the leaders of the course can
not claim to be experts.
"The most frustrating part has to be
that we don't have all the answers," Pham
explains.
The course can offer some guidance,
however, regarding the situation in which
most Stanford students will encounter
homelessness.
"Just walking down University Avenue
for a coffee break, a date or a dinner, you
may pass by a dozen homeless persons or
so," Pham says."The experience inevitably
strikes, at the very least, curiosity — if not
guilt — in many Stanford students."
Osterberg advises that feelings of guilt
are not useful.
"You shouldn't look upon someone
who is homeless as someone of a lower so
cial class. The most important thing," he
says about students walking by on the
street, "is to acknowledge them, maybe
make eye contact or even say hi. Mostly,
it's about respect."

part of the Farm's Night Outreach program. Students in this quarter's Student Initiated Course "The Man on the Street and other Myths: Confronting the Face of Homelessness" can par

"Have you ever seen a man drink him
self to death, a young runaway white lady
or a schizophrenic man's sudden violent
behavior?" asks one Stanford student who
wished to remain anonymous but spent
winter break in a crack den in the Tender
loins district of San Francisco. "Statistics
are one thing... seeing it for yourself is an
other."
This is one of the many experiences
that students bring to the Student Initiated
Course titled "The Man on the Street and
Other Myths: Confronting the Face of
Hornelessness," being offered for the first
time this quarter.
The course leaders, sophomore Aaron
Zagory and junior Anh Pham,lead discus
sions every Monday on topics ranging
from medical issues to the criminalization
of hornelessness.
This past week,course sponsor Dr. Lars
Osterberg spoke to the class about public
health problems surrounding horneless
ness. Osterberg, the medical director of the
Arbor Free Clinic that provides medical
services to the underinsured, says that the
biggest issue facing the Bay Area's home
less is access to medical care.
"I find it striking and I honestly don't
understand why we don't care for the most
vulnerable population that needs it the
most," he says.
The class of 20 students — seven had to
drop because it was too popular — is also
attended by a man named Norm Carroll,
who was formerly an unhoused resident of
Palo Alto himself.
There has been some discussion sur
rounding the use of the word homeless as
opposed to unhoused. "Homeless implies
that you don't have a place you call home,"
Carroll says. "That term is not accurate.
They are always members of community,
not just drifters, here today, gone tomor
row. Some of them were born in Stanford
Hospital and they graduated from Palo
Alto High School. Where else would they
go?"
Carroll adds to the variety of perspec
tives brought to bear on the class. He used
to write for a Stanford publication called
"Street Forum," offering his thoughts on
social justice issues in the Bay Area in a
column called "The View From The Curb."
An outspoken activist for the unhoused,
he has served as an advisor to the Commu
nity Working Group board and even ran
for Palo Alto City Council in 2005.
Carroll's grandparents became home
less as a result of the 1906 earthquake. Born
into hornelessness, Carroll made a move to
turn his life around about five years ago.
"I was starting to see how bad it was for
some people, and I didn't want to go that
far down," he says of his decision to be
come an advocate for the homeless. "I saw
that, inside, I had it in me to help myself
and to help other people."
Now living at the Palo Alto Hotel
thanks to supportive housing from the
"Off Ilie Streets" program, he directs his
attention to the "housed" community of
the Bay Area by participating in such pro
grams as the new hornelessness course.
In last Monday's discussion of medical
issues, Carroll offered some insight into
another challenge for the unhoused seek
ing treatment in response to one student's
question about shame.
"Sometimes, they don't want to go be
cause they smell," he says."And in a small
crowded waiting room, when the reason

everyone is going like this" — he holds his
nose — "is you. it's really hard."
Among several problems facing the
homeless, Osterberg says that they have a
higher incidence of chronic cardiovascu
lar disease and significant problems with
diabetes and high cholesterol due to their
diet.
A native of Sweden, Osterberg also
called for change in the American health
care system, advocating a more preventa
tive approach, especially when it comes to
the homeless. According to Osterberg,
paying upfront for their health care and
mental health services would cut down on
costs of later emergency room visits.
Osterberg's recommendations are in
formed by more than eight years of work
with Palo Alto's homeless. One of the
homeless people he worked with was even
a Stanford student.
"My bias has changed after hearing
their life stories," he says."It could happen
to anyone. I've met people who were very
wealthy, one man was even a professor.
Sometimes, it could be because of abuse or
illness. They are there by no fault of their
own, but rather because of a failure of the
safety net, or no safety net at all. Some
were sick and couldn't work,and health in
surance is tied to work. It is such a Catch
-22 that it is set up that way."
By sharing these experiences, Oster
berg, Carroll, Zagory and Pham are work
ing to break the stereotypes that many
have about the homeless.
"Many people don't know that the
largest growing homeless population in
the Bay Area is families," Osterberg says.
Pham adds, "I hope that [the students')

perceptions and expectations have changed
and that their criteria of who belongs to their
'community' has extended to include social
ly marginalized individuals of the homeless
population. Most of all, I want them to have
a privileged experience of being able to meet
and talk with the homeless."
Indeed, the class advocates a hands-on
approach to learning, offering, among
other opportunities, the chance to go on
walks in downtown Palo Alto with Night
Outreach, and to work with the Palo Alto
Drop-In Center.
Even in the smallest gestures, the leaders
and students seek to be agents of change.
"[We] hope to gain a better understand
ing of the issue as a whole so we can start
making some changes at the individual
level even if it means greeting the panhan
dler on University and Ramona instead of
pretending he/she doesn't exist," says jun
ior Cerisa Ignacio, a member of the Stu
dent Initiated Course.
Students and leaders alike say they real
ly appreciate the forum that a Student Initi
ated Course provides. Zagory and Pham
got together to form the course after an Al
ternative Spring Break (ASB) trip last year.
"I began seeing homelessness as a part
of and related to so many other social jus
tice issues," Zagory says of his ASB experi
ence.
"The most rewarding aspect of teach
ing the course is to discover that there are
other students who are as passionate, or
even more, as we are about the homeless
community and its issues," Pham says.
However, the course is challenging on
many levels, according to Zagory. Present
ing large amounts of information about

homelessness as an academic subject is dif
ficult to balance with looking at it as
"something that affects people on a deeply
personal and individual level."
One student who wished to remain
anonymous seemed somewhat critical of cer
tain elements of the class' approach.
