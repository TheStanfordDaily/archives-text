# Breaking the Glass Ceiling

A yfxxly ever said being a graduate
/\ student was easy. But add a tricky
( ) / f/job market, becoming a mom and
J raising a family to the equation and
you're looking at a life infinitely harder to balance.
That may be one reason why academic posts in
the sciences are overwhelmingly populated by men.
Yes. even at Stanford.
"We call it the pipeline effect," explains fourth
year chemistry doctoral candidate Chrissy Brown.
"At the undergraduate level you've got about 50
percent of women going into the sciences. In grad
uate school, that number drops to about 35 percent.
And after graduation, the number of women facul
ty in the sciences is about 12 percent."That means a
lot of women are dropping out in the process, leav
ing school before they complete their PhDs or
abandoning their plans for an academic career alto
gether.
Take the Chemistry Department at Stanford. It
has had a grand total of three women faculty — ever.
Brown wasn't going to let that slide. In 20()4, she
and three other graduate students in chemistry —
Nahrain Kamber. Alice Lincoln and Tracy Terry —
founded the Stanford Chemistry Women's Commit
tee on Graduate Life (WCGL) to address the im
balance of women in the sciences. The University
was skeptical, as was the department, but the four
women managed to scrape together enough funding
to get the group off the ground.
One year later, WCGL brought home the Dean
of Students Outstanding Achievement Award.
"Our goal was to create an environment that's
supportive of women," Brown says. By organizing
seminars and job panels, "we hoped to contribute
to graduate student life, not just to criticize it." she
explains.
And so the group began hosting events and fo

rums that would open channels of communication
within the department, allowing graduate stu
dents and faculty to address issues of work-life
balance and the difficulties of landing a job after
graduation.
Today, WCGL sponsors quarterly seminars,
dubbed "Perspectives." Women in the field are invit
ed to speak to science graduate students, to share
advice, anecdotes and inspiration.
Limited career choices seem to contribute to
the problem of dwindling female numbers in the
sciences, and WCGL plans their seminars accord
ingly. The most recent seminars include talks on
government jobs in science, non-traditional scien
tific careers and a discussion with young faculty on
life in academia.
WCGL lobbied for Stanford's Distinguished
Women in Science Colloquia (DWIS), which later
received funding from the Chemistry Department.
At these colloquia, significant women scientists are
invited to Stanford for two days of meetings and
talks. Past guests have included Mildred Dressel
hausof the Physics Department at MIT and Cynthia
Friend, chair of the Chemistry Department at Har
vard.
'I"he idea, according to the DWIS Web site, is to
give graduate students and recent post-doctoral stu
dents the chance to "interact with prominent female
role models."
But it's not just women who are concerned about
the gender imbalance and the overall lack of female
mentors in the sciences. Two of WCGL's active
members are men. That's because we're about "di
versity in general," explains third-year PhD student
and WCGL Co-chair Meg Desko. "There are cer
tainly male graduate students and professors who
recognize the imbalance."
Prasad Ganesen is one such student. A third-

year grad-
uate student
studying biophysi-

cal chemistry, he says he

joined the group after notic
ing the disparity between the
numbers of male and female faculty

v
members in the Chemistry Department.
"I was troubled by what that might mean about
the department's culture," he says.
"1 don't think it's an acceptable situation that ir
relevant factors such as gender or race affect who
gets to be a successful scientist and who doesn't,"
Ganesen says. "There's no evidence for a difference
in innate ability, and so the scientific community
ought to be broadly representative of the diversity
of society at large."
Support for women has also trickled down from
the faculty. Last October, Chemistry Department
Chair Dick Zare penned a childbirth accommoda
tion policy for female graduate students, which
WCGL eagerly embraced. Since then, Stanford has
adopted a University-wide maternity policy, which
was unveiled in January.
Despite increasing support. WCGL is still fight
ing an uphill battle.
"There are a number of male graduate students
who don't think gender equality is a big deal, who as
sume that women get into higher-level academic
programs because of affirmative action," Desko
says.
"It's a slow-moving process," Brown agrees.
"We're not going to reverse the 'pipeline' overnight.
But people are realizing there is a problem."
And by working to improve the quality of life for
women in the department, notes Brown, "We are
not just making academic life better for women,
we're making it better for everybody."
