# Chem grad turns indecision into startup gold

### JENNIFER COLE 
Springtime has rolled around, the birds
are chirping and graduation looms near.
Many students are tossing around the idea
of graduate school, hut still haven't pinned
down what they want to do. If this sounds
familiar, you are definitely not alone.
Neal Devaraj, a doctoral candidate, is in
his last year of study in the Chemistry De
partment. Despite a double major in Biol
ogy and Chemistry from MIT. Devaraj
joined the department without specific
ideas for research.
"I came to Stanford having no idea
what I really wanted to work on," he says.
So 1 met with a lot of different kinds of
groups and was exposed to a lot of proj
ects."
Ultimately, this exposure allowed De
varaj to meet Profs. Jim Collman and
Christopher Chidsey. Within the last sever
al years, Collman has focused on synthesiz
ing and studying the properties of model
compounds that mimic the structure and
function of various enzymes. Meanwhile,
Chidsey has been focused on understand
ing how electrons travel through chemical

bonds. Devaraj's research combines both.
"This project was uniquely suited be
cause I was interested in learning more
about how electrons were transferred,"
Devaraj said. "I thought it would be inter
esting to work on a project that also in
volved some aspects of material science. I
was looking for a really rich project that I
could sink my teeth into."
In aerobic organisms—organisms that
require oxygen—9s percent of the oxygen
taken in is used for respiration and metab
olism.Through various chemical processes,
protons combine with oxygen and elec
trons from food to undergo reduction reac
tions, forming water and releasing the en
ergy used by the organism for its biological
functions.This ability to use oxygen during
metabolism is a big evolutionary step be
cause the element is abundant in nature.
Though the final water product is inert,
there are a number of different reactions
involved in this process with toxic prod
ucts. These byproducts of oxygen metabo
lism arc known as reactive oxygen species
(ROS). In order to avoid ROS and to speed
reactions, all aerobic organisms have en
zymes that catalyze this process. However,

the way these enzymes operate is still poor
ly understood.
Collman's work with model compounds
has enabled him to synthesize products
that mimic the behavior of these enzymes
quite accurately. Devaraj's research takes
these model compounds and attaches
them to electrodes, a setup that also allows
him to control the rate at which electrons
are delivered from the electrodes to the
model compounds. He studies how the rate
of electron transfer and the structure of the
model compounds affect oxygen reduction
to form water, as well as ROS.
So what does this mean for rest of us?
"In the really big picture sense," De
varaj explains, "understanding what leads
to the formation of reactive oxygen species
during metabolism is a very big question."
These ROS are related to numerous med
ical disorders such as Alzheimer's disease
and diseases of the nervous and cardiovas
cular systems.
Another important benefit is the under
standing of how to utilize oxygen for ener
gy purposes. For example, one side of fuel
cell reactions involves making water from
oxygen just as organisms do.

"Although the model compounds syn
thesized are too expensive to he useful for
fuel cells, what we learn in terms of the
basic fundamental understanding of oxy
gen reduction can be applicable for people
interested in making catalysts for fuel
cells," Davaraj says.
A third result of his research is that the
techniques his team has developed to
make these model compound electrode as
semblies can be applied elsewhere—for
making sensors. DNA arrays and molecu
lar electronics. Start-ups have even ex
pressed an interest in the technology.
"Right now we're applying for a U.S.
patent on a particular method." Devaraj
adds.
Although his research is grounded in
(Tollman's and Chidsey's, Devaraj express
es gratitude for the ability to have true
ownership of his ideas and his work.
"They pretty much let me run with my
own ideas and make my own schedule,"
he says."I feel more ownership over re
search problems and I want to come in
and work. I don't feel like I'm working for
a professor as far as I'm working for a
team and for myself."
