## Editorial Don't know much about history 
### 
As we all know, Stanford is not an Ivy
League university. But this means
much more than geographical distance
from Harvard and its ilk. Our buildings do not
merely lack the creeping vines that character
ize many of our East Coast peers; we also lack
a sense of history. Few of us know how current
campus happenings compare with what has
gone before in the last five, 10 or 20 years.
If you're a tour guide or a professor
teaching your second generation of Stanford
students, you can probably recite at com
mand a list of important names and dates. If
you're not, you probably don't know too
much beyond what you learned from that
tour guide on Admit Weekend. Stanford, not
being an Ivy League school with 3(X) years of
backstory, tends not to value its own history
that much. The only thing we know about
our past is the story of the Axe.
Take a mental journey — or, more accu
rately, a trip — back to the 1960s and 70s.
Berkeley was a symbol of the changing
times: a hippie stronghold, center of draft
card burning and the rest. But what about
Stanford? What was happening on the
Farm? Few people know the fun bits of triv
ia — the Hoover Tower, for example, once
spent $10,(XK) annually repairing windows
broken by rocks thrown by protesters. We
know that during the civil rights era, progres
sive, social justice-minded students all over
the country laid the foundations for the poli
cies we have today But how did this play out
at Stanford? How many people know?
This may not seem immediately relevant,
but how can we arrive at an informed opinion
about affirmative action, for example, if we
don't know how the campus felt about such is
sues before any policies were implemented or

even seriously considered? It is not as if simi
lar debates have never played out on campus.
In 1970, for example — in reaction to the fact
that women constituted around 22 percent of
both applicants and enrolled students —
Stanford contemplated a sort of affirmative
action for women in order to balance the gen
der ratio. But we would be exaggerating if we
said even a few people knew about this debate
— much less its results and the consequences.
And the problem with forgetting our histo
ry is, as George Santayana's famous saying
goes, that we are doomed to repeat it. We were
ignorant, for example, of the fact that Stanford
has not had a labor strike since 1980,and need
ed to be informed of that fact when another
strike seemed imminent. Thomas Kuhn's
landmark treatise "The Structure of Scientific
Revolutions" shows how science is shaped by
paradigms. When a paradigm — Newtonian
physics, for instance — is generally accepted,
it can only be replaced by a more correct the
ory. But paradigms govern political, ethical
and practical theories as well as science. The
debate over the merits of issues like gender
equality and affirmative action often hinges
on the results of the actions we take.
And Stanford is not a place where debates
are governed by wrongs done or supposedly
done to our ancestors, as in troubled regions like
Israel, Palestine or Northern Ireland. Further
awareness of what our predecessors did can only
serve to provide context for current discourse.
If this doesn't convince you, think about
how much you know about the alumni who
finance a large part of our educations. And in
the future, when we are out in the "real"
world, raising our own children, think about
who will remember our lives, our fights and
our struggles. Will we, too, be forgotten?
