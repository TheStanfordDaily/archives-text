# Art de Toilette
## 
### 
Would you think I was a total loser if I
wrote this column about the discussion
we had in I-Hum section last week?
Yeah,you probably would. But I happen to
think that it's an interesting topic, so you'll
have to bear with me. Or you can always stop
reading and decide never to invite me to an
other party, because you never know when I
may start talking about my PWR paper when
all you want to do is get a game of Kings going.
Guys: Imagine you really have to pee, so
you run into the men's room, unzip your
pants and get ready to do your business...only
to find a gorgeous woman staring back at you.
Except she's not just staring â€” she's measur
ing, photographing and doing everything in
her power to make you feel as, um, small as
possible. She stares at you from directly be
hind the urinal, waiting for you to screw up so
she and her friends can have a good laugh
about you later. And even though you have a
lifetime's worth of experience using the toilet
(not including, of course, your pre-potty
training days, camping trips to uncivilized ter
ritory and a few choice Friday nights), you zip
your jeans back up and decide you really
don't have to pee that badly after all.
If you can see yourself reacting in a similar
manner, you will probably want to avoid the
Sofitel if you ever find yourself in New Zealand
with a full bladder.The men's room at this five
star hotel in Queenstown is adorned with a
mural of beautiful women who are doing their
best to guard the urinals and make the few men
who dare to use them quite uncomfortable. (If
you don't believe that this place exists, Google
"Sofitel+bathroom" and check out the pictures
and news reports online.)
The discussion we had in section centered on
the meaning of this particular piece of artwork,
but this example brings up a broader question:
What's the deal with art in the bathroom? More
and more often,establishments are going out of
their way to impress their patrons with their
style and panache. Since they cannot ignore a
single room, it seems that public restrooms are
about to become the new generation of art mu

seums. Maybe they will even have tour guides:
"Here in stall one we see an example from Pi
casso's cubist period, and while you wash your
hands you will notice a series of Van Gogh's im
pressionistic pieces over the sinks."
Is art becoming the new bathroom reading?
Magazine racks are no longer en vogue; they
have been replaced with marble busts. Instead
of pretending to be interested in the Newsweek
that is the only reading material in sight, you
can stare at a painting and ponder its meaning
while you're in the john. Then again, people
don't need another excuse to take even more
time in public restrooms than they already do;
I would sacrifice aesthetic pleasure if it meant
that the line for the women's room would inch
forward even the slightest bit faster.
However, a restroom with an art gallery
can be a handy excuse in some cases; "Yes,
I've been in the bathroom for the past 20
minutes, but I wasn't on the toilet the whole
time. It's just that I am so incisive that I got
caught up in the artistry of the mural on the
wall and completely lost track of time."
Art is also a good conversation starter, es
pecially when you're on a date and don't know
what to say when you return from the bath
room. If you start talking about the weird stat
ue that was standing in the corner of the ladies'
room, you can avoid the awkwardness of pre
tending that you didn't just call your six best
girlfriends to dish to them about your hot date.
The moral of the story is this: Art in the
bathroom is a strange concept, but it makes
each stall a little more unique and each visit a
little more interesting. Now if you'll excuse me,
I really need to go to the art gallery.

If you have seen an interesting piece of art
work in a public restroom, share it with
