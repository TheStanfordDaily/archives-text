Objections to PETA exhibit are
problematic
In his letter, Daniel Phillips objects to
PETA's on-campus displays that compare
the suffering of animals to the suffering of
humans ("PETA's comparisons were inap
propriate," Apr. 28). Phillips claims that
PETAs casting the plight of historically op
pressed humans solely in terms of their ca
pacity for suffering "devalues" humanity.
The very fact that the display elicits reac
tions involving such notions betrays the kind
of hidden assumptions that most animal
rights advocates seek to undermine, namely,
that humans are more important than and su
perior to animals with regard to the kinds of
treatment they warrant. And this very same
"equality means devaluing" type of thinking
is the same kind of bias that has caused (and
continues to cause) so much human suffering,
exploitation and oppression.
I find nothing wrong with "equating" peo
ple with animals since people are animals.
Thie, we are special animals in many ways.
Yet, when it comes to oppressive social insti
tutions or exploitative cultural practices in
volving, for example, the mass torture and ex

ecution of sentient beings for no other pur
pose than to satisfy our palates, it is, in fact,
the ability to feel pain that makes such social
justice issues analogous across species.

Organizers of Darfur rally deserve to
be commended
Stanford students did a masterful job of or
ganizing Sunday's peaceful Darfur Rally at
Crissy Field in San Francisco. We were so proud
to be part of an academic community where
busy students made the time to draw attention
to the ongoing atrocities in Darfur.
A great way to say thanks for all their ef
forts — should you agree that another geno
cide really should happen "never again" —
would be to call your congressional represen
tatives and local media and to raise money or
donate money to help. You can contact
