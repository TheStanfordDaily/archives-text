# Bogart can't breathe
## 
### 
Ihad a sore throat. My neck glands were
swollen. It hurt to swallow if 1 didn't drop a
gram of ibuprofen per meal. My voice was
low,coarse, raspy (it actually improved my Ger
man). It had been like that for over two weeks.
The Doctor, in his Logan's Run German
medical ensemble (white T-shirt, white pants,
white shoes), had told me it was just a minor
cold. Possible reasons why it was sticking
around for the fortnight: no sleep, stress and
an Easter weekend visit to my brother, Bren
dan, in Moscow — a city with a sweet broke
down stench of young rich, cheap vodka,
seedy under lit clubs playing Morrissey and
girls who all look like Sharapova on the hunt
for a debaucherous good time (or maybe just
a rich foreigner husband).
It was a long weekend. On the third day, my
voice almost gone, we celebrated the Resur
rection with a four-hour mimosa brunch, a trip
to an Orthodox Church to thank our Lord
(and beg his forgiveness) and a marathon
viewing of Arrested Development season
two. Brendan, his girlfriend Lauren and I lay
in B's apartment (think the Fight Club house
squeezed into four rooms with two lights,
overlooking the Moscow Zoo bear habitat),
eating pizza, telling ourselves ten times that
the next episode was the last. My laugh sound
ed chalked, throaty, like the mating roar of a
giant cancerous bull spider. Maybe it was still
the Russian aftermath keeping my voice
raspy. Or. who knows, maybe the cigarettes.
I despise it when columnists talk about
their column in their column. It's lazy and nar
cissistic, and I'm not lazy. Occasionally, some
of the more ideologically inflected columnists
(i.e., not the type who mostly writes about this
awesome East Berlin club I went to last night)
will talk about their duty to their readers. I
write assuming I have no readers, because no
one reads The Daily, except for my mom. who
just loved that Amsterdam article.
But I'll pull back the curtain for a minor
revelation: all my columns have been written,
in part, with a cigarette.
It's an easy habit to pick up in Europe.

Everybody smokes here — businessmen, at
tractive women, fifth-graders. Giant cigarette
advertisements cover Berlin; there's a vending
machine on every corner: all the bars and clubs
across the continent still have that illicit tobac
co scent oozing out the walls. It's not like in Cal
ifornia. I tried cigarettes back in high school,
but always felt self-conscious, like every passing
soccer mom and gym freak dad were pointing
at me. "SHAME," hiding their children's eyes,
"SHAME." like I was Frankenstein's monsters
and they were villagers with pitchforks.
On average, I've been smoking maybe
one cigarette a day. With the exception of
some long Friday nights at bars and long
weekday afternoons at cafes. There was the
Film Festival, when the only thing keeping
me sane was a coffee and cigarette after
every movie. Not to mention the occasional
anxiety cigarette (I need to write this essay!).
Nonsmokers probably wonder: Why
smoke? We all have DARE T-shirts. We've
seen the hilariously depressing "Truth" com
mercials (old woman smoking through hole
in her throat; dead grandpa watching grand
son take his first steps). Google "Black
Lung" and a couple thousand pictures of shit
showed ex-breathing organs pop up. My high
school English teacher used to be a decent
singer — when he lectured to us about
Faulkner, he had a voice like raw concrete.
Why smoke? I don't even like cigarettes
that much.Hie smoke gets in your eye, the ash
on your clothes, the stink in your teeth. The
pleasant buzz sensation quickly descends to
dizziness and after a while fades into a crawl
ing high-pressure itch on your frontal lobe.
Why? Because, despite years of cultural
programming — or because of it — smoking
is cool. It adds a spice to life, a whiff of danger,
a touch of Bogart in this Paul Walker world.
There is a horrible, wonderful pleasure in the
thing: the click of the cheap lighter, the slow
burn, casually tapping the ash in the ash tray.
Everybody knows smoking kills (and makes
kissing taste like crude oil and cordite).
Though Europe is holding out for now, the

general smoke-free trend is obvious. Health is
good for you. Smoking is not, and that's prob
ably why it's so much fun.The other people —
the normals — the kids who take the high
ground and bug us about it,don't understand.
Not-smoking, like nice guys and Art History
majors, will never be cool.
Now that spring is finally here, I feel no
urge to smoke during the daytime. It's easy to
light up when all is gray snowy void and a lit
tle tobacco jolt actually serves a warm, func
tional purpose (same reason Russians drink
so much vodka; you would too if you lived in
a corrupt poverty-stricken iceberg). It's hard
er when the sun shines on fresh green grass,
cherry blossoms in bloom, birds chirping and
what have you. This has always been my fa
vorite mental defense against addiction anx
iety — that Stanford's nice weather (plus all
those damn Olympians wandering around
with their elitist muscles) will force me back
into the gym, and Jamba.
Or am I kidding myself? The other day I
smoked a cigarette with my Film teacher,
Christa,a no-bull journalist type with a voice that
defines chain-smoking. It's strange sharing a
smoke break with someone about to go through
throat surgery — and a bit sobering, too. John
Wayne, Walt Disney, Gary Cooper, Peter Jen
nings, a couple thousand people since I started
writing this article and even Bogart himself all
met their maker literally coughing up a lung.
But what's Bogart without cigarettes?
That romantic backlit haze of smoke that you
only get in old black and white movies —
ethereal, enthralling, ageless, fricking cool.
What's Bogart without cigarettes? Noth
ing, except probably alive.
