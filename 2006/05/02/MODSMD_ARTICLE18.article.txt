## ASSU Senate needs reform 
### ADAM BEBERG 
As the GSC liaison to the Senate, I can say
with some certainty that all the controversy
about the recent ASSU Executive and Sen
ate elections being 1(X) percent about color
are exactly right. It's all about color — green.
Next year's Special Interest Senate (they
have a two-thirds majority; they can rename
it) will have about $280,(XX) of General Fees
to spend. Congratulations to them for win
ning the spoils of war, but what about the rest
of the undergraduate groups?
Now, I'm not going to claim that the new
senators will convene in a few weeks and write
a check for the groups that endorsed them be
cause there is nothing anyone can do to stop
them — there is. And they probably won't
vote to approve $ 155,(XX) over-budget or over
turn an election like two years ago because the
bylaws have been fixed. Every undergraduate
at Stanford is a minority now — race might
have been an issue in the last decade, but it's
all about money now — as it has always been.

The outgoing ASSU government has per
formed nothing short of a miracle by making
a complete break from the tradition of hav
ing special interest groups dominate student
government.They pulled things together and
did some real advocacy for the students, re
formed the bylaws and got the administra
tion to take the Senate seriously. Meanwhile,
special interests were forced to sit in the cor
ner while we fixed the bylaws and handed out
funding more fairly. The Senate has been re
modeled more like the Graduate Student
Council, which has new studio housing, the
new Graduate Community Center and a new
Assistant Dean of Graduate Diversity
thanks to their advocacy. Imagine what the
undergrads could get with well-thought-out
plans and reasonable requests from their stu
dent representatives instead of protests.
There is nothing you can do in student
government at Stanford that will affect you
this year or even next year. Any programs
that the ASSU puts in place will tend to have
long-term effects because in the real world.

things take time, and in academia, things take
a very, very long time. Voting out all your sen
ators every term (most run only once) makes
it difficult to implement long-term projects,as
no one has time to learn what's going on and
form relationships with the administration.
How senators are chosen is the source of
the problem. Once a year you elect 15 people,
based primarily on who can put up the most
flyers and make the most unrealistic promises,
to go off and spend your money and advocate
for you. How else could you know who to vote
for given this mess except by profoundly bi
ased endorsements and Daily articles? There
are many better ways to do it, by implement
ing systems of districting and consensus voting
the GSC has in place, or allowing rolling mem
bership based on interest and participation.
My hope is that the Senate continues to
reform and move forward with student advo
cacy. It is currently at a turning point, and I
hope that you the reader will decide to hold
your senators responsible for the task of
keeping Stanford the best place on Earth.
