# IMMIGRATION IMPACT
## Stanford community rallies around cause 
### CHRISTOPHER LIN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford students, faculty and employees joined
hundreds of thousands across the nation yesterday
as they marched across campus to show their sup
port for immigrant rights and to protest legislation
proposing tighter restrictions on immigration.
Organized by the Student Coalition for Immi
grant Rights, the events of were intended to
demonstrate support for immigrant families and
opposition to legislation such as California Propo

sition 187 and the proposed Senate bill I I.R. 4437
— which, among other provisions, makes housing
illegal immigrants a felony
"Harsh anti-immigrant legislation criminalizes
undocumented immigrants and those aiming to
help them," the SCIR stated in a press release.
"Students and community members will not stand
for the criminalization of our families, friends and
co-workers. Immigrants, undocumented or not.
must be treated with respect and dignity."
At noon, students gathered for a rally in White
Plaza to stand against legislation limiting immi

grant rights. Dressed mostly in white, they cheered
to the opening tunes of Mariachi de Cardenal. Sev
eral speakers then stepped up to the stage to ex
plain the nature and purpose of the rally.
"Today is May Day, today is the traditional In
ternational Day of the Worker, today is the Interna
tional Day of Action for Human Rights," pro
claimed speaker Inmar Loboi io. "On today s day.

Members of the Stanford community supported immigrant rights in a series
of protests and demonstrations on campus yesterday. Events included a rally,
a march and a candlelight vigil, organized by the Student Coalition for Im
migrant Rights.
ty with immigrants under fundamental
belief that no human being is illegal,
that every human being has the right to
be free and to pursue happiness."
"We are on both sides of an imagi
nary line that separates the same peo
ple," added one of the three members
of the Spoken Word Collective that
performed at the rally.
After the Collective's performance,
campus worker Dorotea Garcia gave a
speech in Spanish illuminating the
plight of families forced to immigrate
to the United States to provide for
their families, Students then proceed
ed from White Plaza to Hoover Tower,
where they joined a crowd of more
than 200 chanting in both English and
Spanish. The crowd was kept from
protesting directly in front of the tower
by police officers guarding a barricade.
"When we got to Hoover Tower,
the front was barricaded and there
were police officers," said junior Linda
Lee, one of the organizers of the days
events. "There was a tent that was also
barricaded, though I'm not sure what
that was for.The barricade blocked off
the sidewalk, so instead of being right
in front of Hoover, we stood in front of
Memorial Auditorium facing Hoover.
Students kept up the energy by chant
ing and doing the toyi toyi, a chant and
dance from the South African
apartheid movement."
Students gathered again at 7 p.m. to
form a procession beginning at Uja
maa and proceeding to each of the
ethnic theme dorms before ending
with a candlelight vigil in White Plaza.
"The purpose of the vigil is to rec
ognize the deaths of so many people
trying to cross the U.S. border," Lee
explained. "We are not only speaking
about the US-Mexico border, but
other borders as well. We recognize
that people have passed away trying to
cross the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans
into the United States."
At the vigil, students gathered in a
circle, each holding a small cup with a
lit candle inside. Speakers from vari
ous ethnic and political organizations

around campus stood up and spoke
about how their organizations' mis
sions related to the immigration issue.
"As Asian-Americans, we are a
community of immigrants and the chil
dren of immigrants, said a representa
tive for the Stanford Asian-American
Activism Committee. "We support the
rights and lives of all people who have
lost their lives and those who continue
putting their hearts and souls into
making our own lives possible."
Other groups emphasized the spe
cial challenges facing immigrants who
work in the agricultural industry and
immigrant women who risk rape by
gangs and immigration officials.
The vigil concluded with a quiet
song followed by a ceremonial blow
ing out of all candles. As students gave
one last cheer and slowly left White
Plaza, the Aztec Dance group per
formed in the area formerly occupied
by the demonstrators.
Junior Laura Rodriguez, who par
ticipated in both the noon rally and
the evening vigil, praised the organiz
ers for emphasizing the unity of differ
ent groups on campus.
"It was very inspiring to see all the
different organizations on campus
come together," she said. "It didn't
feel like one organization putting an
event on — it felt like everyone came
out together to do something and
show support."
Organizers said they hoped the
event — and those like it across the
nation — will send a message to politi
cians.
"Overall, with all the people that
are coming out against H.R. 4437 and
the other bills being proposed, policy
makers are going to be more cautious
about what kind of legislation they're
promoting, and hopefully more con
scious about what message they are
sending to the people coming into the
U. 5.," Lee said." Legislators need to
put forth immigration legislation that
respects people's dignity and doesn't
deny them the right to be treated like
a person."
