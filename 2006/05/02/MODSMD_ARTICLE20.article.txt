# Bears squeeze past Cardinal
## Three Stanford relievers fail to get an out in the seventh, game decided by a walk 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
Freshman Austin Yount's career with the Stanford Car
dinal has only just begun, but California's Evans Diamond
has likely already worked its way to the top of Yount's list
of least favorite places to play.
Yesterday afternoon, the rookie righthander walked in
what proved to be the deciding run in the Bears' 4-3 non
conference victory over the Cardinal. Ironically, the fresh
man's tough-luck appearance yesterday came almost exact
ly two months after Stanford's bitter loss to California on
March 3. In that game, Yount was playing third base for
Stanford and committed a costly ninth-inning throwing
error that allowed the Bears to push across the winning run.
But in neither case could the loss be pinned on Yount
alone — in their March meeting, the Cardinal committed
three errors that led to three unearned Bears runs, and yes
terday Yount was called in to face the heart of the Califor
nia lineup with the bases loaded and no outs in the bottom
of the seventh.
The Cardinal (19-20, 5-10 Pac-10) cruised through the

first six innings, building a 3-1 lead on the strength of starter
Nolan Gallagher's brilliant six-inning outing. The sopho
more righthander scattered four hits and settled down to
hold the Bears (22-22, 8-10) scoreless after surrendering a
run in the first inning.
But head coach Mark Marquess decided not to send
Gallagher out to face the Bears in the bottom of the sev
enth. Instead. Marquess made the call to the bullpen, bring
ing in freshman righthander Max Fearnow.
The strategy didn't work out as planned, though, as
Fearnow allowed a double and a walk to start the inning be
fore giving way to sophomore David Stringer. But Stringer
didn't fare much better, as he walked California leadoff
man Rob Nesbitt to load the bases.
Hoping to put out the fire. Marquess handed the ball to
Yount. who entered the game the owner of a team-low 2.61
ERA in eight appearances.
But staring back at Yount from the batter's box was
Allen Craig — the Bears' second-leading hitter with a .363
average, nine homers and 30 RBI to his credit.
As it turned out.however, Craig didn't even need to take
the bat off his shoulder to do his damage. Yount hit Craig
with a pitch to force in California's first run of the inning,
and the Stanford cushion shrank to 3-2. Bears outfielder
Chris Errecart quickly tied the score, lacing a single to left
to bring in second baseman Kyle Spraker. Yount then
walked California cleanup hitter Brennan Boesch, giving
the Bears a lead that would ultimately prove to be insur
mountable.
Freshman Sean Ratliff relieved Yount and did a nice job
getting out of the jam. The southpaw first got California's
Josh Satin to ground into a fielder's choice, with third base
man Randy Molina throwing home to get the force. Ratliff
then induced an inning-ending 4-6-3 double play that got
Stanford back up to bat. But the damage had been done,
and the Cardinal were unable to put together any sort of a
comeback effort in either the eighth or ninth innings.
Stanford second baseman Chris Lewis reached first on
an error in the Cardinal's half of the ninth, but
would get no further because California closer Jere
my Burchett slammed the door to close out the win
and pick up his fourth save of the season.
llie loss was particularly disappointing for the
Cardinal, who entered the contest fresh off their
first series victory of the year this past weekend over
No. 16 Arizona State. Stanford will be looking to re
gain its momentum this evening, taking on San Jose
State (30-17, 9-6 WAC) at 6 p.m. in Sunken Dia
mond.
The Cardinal have faced the Spartans once be
fore this season, winning 13-3. They hope to repeat
the feat today, in preparation for this weekend's
home series against California in conference play.
