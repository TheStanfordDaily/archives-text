## Pair makes history at Nationals 
### JOHN CHOCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford sophomores Sara Lowe and
Courtenay Stewart stepped out of the pool and
into swimming history on Saturday when they
won the duet competition at the U.S. Synchro
nized Swimming Senior Nationals in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla.The Cardinal pair are the first
collegians to win a U.S. National duct since at
least 1980, and perhaps the first in the 62-year
history of the championships — the records
might not even exist.
Stanford finished second in overall team
standings, behind the Santa Clara Aquamaids.
It was the reigning champions' 15th title, and
the Cardinal's second-consecutive second
place finish.
"I was just so proud of them," Stanford
Coach Heather Olson said of her nine swim

mers. "They're one of the few teams doing it all
— rigorous college, getting a good education
and still competing at an elite level."
Many of the 160 athletes who compete at
the Senior Nationals train full-time. To win.
Lowe and Stewart had to top a field of duets
that included three pairs of identical twins and
at least as many members of the national team.
Undaunted, the two sophomores — both
Athens Olympians — made quick work of the

competition, commanding the technical por
tion of their event with singular finesse.
"They were flawlessly precise in their tech
routine," Olson said. "That's what really won it
for them. I"hey performed from their hearts
and had a great swim."
Lowe and Stewart amassed %.17 points,
barely edging out Christina Jones and Andrea
