## Pair makes history at Nationals 
### JOHN CHOCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford sophomores Sara Lowe and
Courtenay Stewart stepped out of the pool and
into swimming history on Saturday when they
won the duet competition at the U.S. Synchro
nized Swimming Senior Nationals in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla.The Cardinal pair are the first
collegians to win a U.S. National duct since at
least 1980, and perhaps the first in the 62-year
history of the championships — the records
might not even exist.
Stanford finished second in overall team
standings, behind the Santa Clara Aquamaids.
It was the reigning champions' 15th title, and
the Cardinal's second-consecutive second
place finish.
"I was just so proud of them," Stanford
Coach Heather Olson said of her nine swim

mers. "They're one of the few teams doing it all
— rigorous college, getting a good education
and still competing at an elite level."
Many of the 160 athletes who compete at
the Senior Nationals train full-time. To win.
Lowe and Stewart had to top a field of duets
that included three pairs of identical twins and
at least as many members of the national team.
Undaunted, the two sophomores — both
Athens Olympians — made quick work of the

competition, commanding the technical por
tion of their event with singular finesse.
"They were flawlessly precise in their tech
routine," Olson said. "That's what really won it
for them. I"hey performed from their hearts
and had a great swim."
Lowe and Stewart amassed %.17 points,
barely edging out Christina Jones and Andrea

In addition to its duet competition crown from sophomores Sara Lowe and Courtenay Stewart, the
synchro team also finished second overall at the U.S. Synchronized Swimming Senior Nationals.
Nott of the Aquamaids, who took
second with 96.08.The Stanford duet
of sophomore Poppy Carlig and jun
ior Samantha Bongiovanni-Duclos
swam back from a disappointing
preliminary to nab sixth place with
91.42.
In the solo event, co-captain
Lowe leapt and purled to silver with
95.33 points. Christina Jones of the
Aquamaids won the solo with 96.17.
Stanford unveiled a brand-new
technical routine in the team final,
swimming to a patriotic medley of
"Yankee Doodle Dandy" and "Jesus
Walks" in custom-made sequined
camouflage-print bathing suits. The
spirited routine earned the Cardinal
96.084 points and a silver medal.
Junior co-captain Liz Markman
explained the team's decision to pay
tribute to the American armed

forces.
"Because nearly every member
of our team has competed for the
U.S. National Team, we all know, in
some small way, what it's like to try
to win something for your country."
At the meet, U.S.A. Synchro
named Markman to the 2006 Na
tional Team 11.
The Cardinal, who went unde
feated in collegiate competition and
had hoped to become the first colle
giate team to win the meet, won the
praise of the crowd.
"Many people, including judges,
coaches and other swimmers went
out of their way to mention how en
joyable our swims were to watch,
which meant more to our team than
results," Lowe said.
All nine of the Cardinal, includ
ing six sophomores, will return next
year.
"We have nine amazing athletes
who know what it takes to win, and
the finishes we had at this competi
tion will only motivate us to work
even harder next year," Lowe said.
