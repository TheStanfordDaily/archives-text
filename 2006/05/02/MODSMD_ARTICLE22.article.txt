### NATALIE CHLADEK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford coed sailing team captured
first place at the Pacific Coast Championships
Team Race last Friday. After placing third for
the past five years, Stanford finally broke
through with a 10-2 record for the event. South
ern California took second, while UC-Irvine
finished third in the event, which Stanford
hosted in Redwood City.
By finishing in the top two, Stanford quali
fied for the Intercollegiate Sailing Association
(ICSA) Team Race Nationals in Charleston.
S.C. on May 29 and 30.

Stanford's boats consisted of junior skipper
Brian Haines and junior crew Becca Levin.jun
ior skipper Emery Wager and freshman crew
Taylor Grimes, and sophomore skipper Eddie
Conrad and senior crew Anna Vu.
Stanford started strong and remained unde
feated until the third and final round, when
they lost one race to Hawaii and one to USC.
Even so, the team's lead was wide enough that
the PCC Championship was still easily within
their reach.
"All three of our boats are very fast and
smart, so our opponents had a really hard time
finding any weaknesses to attack." assistant
coach John Pearce said.

In the team racing format, three boats from
each team race against each other, employing
strategy and boat-handling in a mad dash to
cross the finish line first.
On Saturday and Sunday, Stanford nosed
out Irvine in an exciting finish to take second in
the Fleet Race Pacific Coast Championships,
hosted by Cal at Treasure Island in San Francis
co. With the second-place finish, Stanford qual
ified for the ICSA Coed Dinghy Nationals in
Charleston on June 1-3. USC won the regatta.
After racing on Saturday, Stanford sat in
second, just one point ahead of Irvine. Hie two
teams were tied going into the last
race on Sunday, but it was Stanford
that ended up winning — by a mere
tour points, in what coach Amy
Gross-Kehoe called "a real nail
biter."
Racing for the Cardinal in the A
division were Haines with Levin and
freshman Kelly McKenna. Con
rad/Vu and Wager/Grimes split
races in the B division.
Unlike team racing, boats com
pete in individual races in the fleet
racing format. A total of 18 races
were sailed, with eight in the A divi
sion and 10 in the B division.
These two high finishes come
after a dominating performance by
the women's team at the Women's
Pacific Coast Championships last
weekend in Santa Barbara. Stanford
won the regatta by more than 20
points to earn a berth in the ICSA
Women's Dinghy Nationals May 24-
26, also held in Charleston. This
marks a momentous occasion for
the sailing team, as Stanford quali
fied for all three spring national
events for the first time since 1993.
As of April 25, the coed team is
ranked 12th and the women's team
is ranked fifth nationally.
