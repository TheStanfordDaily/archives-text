## American record set at Penn Relays 
### ISRAEL ROJAS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Track and field lacks the popularity of mainstream Ameri
can sports. Indeed, the typical fan base usually consists of for
mer athletes and the friends and family of current participants.
However fans and non-fans alike would probably agree
that relays are often the highlight of the sport, and this week
end Stanford traveled to Philadelphia to compete against
the best.
This weekend marked the 112 th running of the Penn
Relay Carnival, an annual event that hosts over 425 races in
three days. Participants in the relays have won gold medals in
every summer Olympic games (with the exception of the
boycotted 1980 Olympics), and 23 Penn Relay alumni com
peted in the 2004 Olympics. Fast races characterize the event,
collegiate track's signature meet, and a flurry of records are
set each year.
And sure enough for Stanford, the weekend began with
the Cardinal women setting a new school record in the dis
tance medley relay on Thursday night. Sophomore Katy Trot
ter and juniors Janice Davis, Ashley Freeman and Arianna
Lambie teamed up to break the six-year-old record with a
time of 10:58.72.The squad finished second of 13, losing only
to Villanova.
The Stanford women continued
to turn up the heat on Friday. Junior
Amanda Trotter joined her sister
Katy, Lambie and redshirt fresh
man Lauren Centrowitz to run the
4x1500 meter relay, breaking the
American record that Wisconsin set
in 1990. Their winning time of
17:18.63 minutes also broke the
school record, but just missed the
collegiate record of 17:18.10.
"Amanda [Trotter] pushed it in
the beginning. Lauren [Centrowitz]
ran a huge personal best and Katy
[TVotter] and 1 just held it," Lambie
said."Coach [PeterTegen] told us the
school records were within reach. I
didn't even know about the Ameri
can record. I wasn't thinking about
them. I just ran as fast as 1 could."
In an earlier interview, Lambie
expressed how much she enjoys
running in the Penn Relays â€”
mainly because of her parents' pres
ence at the meet. The Trotter sisters
and Centrowitz also hail from the
East Coast, and echoed Lambie's
sentiments.
"I really love the Penn Relays,"
Katy Trotter said.
"It's nice to come home, espe
cially with the history here at the
Penn Relays," Amanda TVotter said.
Centrowitz became the second
in her family to hold an American

record, her father Matt having set
the U.S. 5,000 meter record in 1982.
His time now ranks ninth on the
U.S. all-time performer's list.
"It's a great team to run with and
be a part of history," Centrowitz
said.
Things toned down a bit on Sat
urday, with Stanford's highest
placement coming in the 4xBoo
meter relay. Lambie, Freeman and
Amanda Trotter returned for this
race, with freshman Alicia Follmar
filling the last spot. The squad
placed third with a time of 8:36.23.
On Sunday, those who had not
competed during the Penn Relays
took part in the Payton Jordan Car
dinal Invitational, held at Stan
ford's Cobb Track and Angell Field.
There were several Stanford win
ners, with redshirt sophomore Nef
talem Araia's performance high
lighting the night. Araia ran the
school's fifth-fastest 10,000 meter,
with a time of 28:27.43 minutes. His
time qualified him for the 2006
NCAA Outdoor Championships.
Sophomore Wopamo Osaisai
won both the 100- and 200-meter
races, his time of 10.45 seconds in the
100 qualifying him for the NCAA
West Regional. Others qualifying for
Regionals included sophomore
Michael Garcia, who posted a per
sonal record time in the 800 meters,
junior Jonathan Pierce and fresh
man Hari Mix in the 5.000 meters,
sophomore Lindsay Allen in the
1,500 meters and freshman Michaela
Wallerstedt in the shot put.
