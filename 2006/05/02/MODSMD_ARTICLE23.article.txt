## American record set at Penn Relays 
### ISRAEL ROJAS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Track and field lacks the popularity of mainstream Ameri
can sports. Indeed, the typical fan base usually consists of for
mer athletes and the friends and family of current participants.
However fans and non-fans alike would probably agree
that relays are often the highlight of the sport, and this week
end Stanford traveled to Philadelphia to compete against
the best.
This weekend marked the 112 th running of the Penn
Relay Carnival, an annual event that hosts over 425 races in
three days. Participants in the relays have won gold medals in
every summer Olympic games (with the exception of the
boycotted 1980 Olympics), and 23 Penn Relay alumni com
peted in the 2004 Olympics. Fast races characterize the event,
collegiate track's signature meet, and a flurry of records are
set each year.
And sure enough for Stanford, the weekend began with
the Cardinal women setting a new school record in the dis
tance medley relay on Thursday night. Sophomore Katy Trot
ter and juniors Janice Davis, Ashley Freeman and Arianna
Lambie teamed up to break the six-year-old record with a
time of 10:58.72.The squad finished second of 13, losing only
to Villanova.
