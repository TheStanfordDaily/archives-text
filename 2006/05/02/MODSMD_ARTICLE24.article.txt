## No. 19 Card down No. 10 Cornell Team ends season on a high note, also heals Connecticut 
### ROHAN PURANIK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ihe Stanford women's lacrosse team
ended its regular season on fire, riding a
five-game winning streak that culminat
ed with a win against No. 10 Cornell on
Sunday.
The team's performance stood in
stark contrast to results from earlier this
season, when the squad had a 5-5 record
coming off of a three-game losing streak.
According to Coach Michele
Uhlfelder, those losses helped the team
redevelop its game plan.
"Some of the early losses allowed us
to refocus," Uhlfelder said. "They helped
us prioritize some of the things we want
ed to work on."
Uhlfelder added that the team's men
tal grit had aided their recent success.
"The team has shown a lot of re
silience," Uhlfelder said. "They have
been very mentally tough."
The current streak includes victories
over UC-Davis, Denver — the top
ranked seed in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation conference tourna
ment — and Loyola College, in addition
to victories over Connecticut and Cor
nell this past weekend.
The squad's first match of the week
end against Connecticut ended in suc
cess, thanks to the expert play of senior
attacks Megan Burkcr and Sarah Bach.
The Cardinal defeated the Huskies on
the road 10-7, as Bach scored four goals
for the Cardinal and Burker netted a hat

trick.
Sophomore attack Daphne Patterson scored
twice, and sophomore midfield Anna Brown
managed a goal.
Bach started the scoring in the first minute of
play. In the third minute, Patterson tallied her
first.
Connecticut slowed the offense from then
on, however, with the Cardinal picking up only
one more goal in the half, courtesy of Bach.
The first half of the contest ended with the
Huskies matching the Cardinal with three goals
apiece. Both squads had ample opportunities to
score, but failed to capitalize. Stanford took 16
shots while the Huskies attempted 10.
The second half yielded far better results for
the Cardinal. The squad scored seven more
times, with all of Burker's goals coming in the
first 20 minutes of the half. The Huskies netted
four, but it wasn't enough to stop the Cardinal
from notching another win.
Sunday's game against Cornell was far clos
er, with the Card prevailing 5-4. The squads ap
peared evenly matched, with the differentiating
goal coming for the Cardinal during the first
half.
Burker and Patterson scored two goals
apiece.
Freshman midfield Jamie Nesbitt's goal at
16:57 was the first goal of the match for Stan
ford. Earlier, the Big Red's Noelle Dowd had
scored at 20:48.
The first half ended at 3-2 Stanford, with Nes
bitt's goals followed up by a point apiece from
Burker and Patterson.
The second half began with quick goals from
Patterson and Burker as the Cardinal built a
three-goal lead. The Stanford women were un
able to capitalize on their opportunities for the
rest of the half, but they also limited the Big Red
to just two goals as they hung on for the win.
The final goal for Cornell came at 2:04, but
the Stanford defense hung on to pull off the
upset.
According to Uhlfelder, the squad has been
playing excellent defense.
"The defense has reached a level of consis
tency we have been looking for," Uhlfelder said.
"They've held two teams to 11 goals in two
games, which is excellent."
Uhlfelder added the team worked hard
against Cornell capitalizing on its opportunities.
"Our goal is to get after the draws, after the
50-50 balls and the ground balls," Uhlfelder said.
"It was a battle. We wanted to test our speed

against their speed."
Uhlfelder added that the team enjoyed the
competition and had been looking forward to
seeing how well they could play against a high
er-ranked team. She also reflected on losing sev
eral seniors at the end of the year.
"Any losses open up spaces for people to
fill," she noted. "[The seniors] will leave big
shoes to fill, but that's exciting in a way.
Turnovers can be exciting for a team. Opportu
nities open up."
Uhlfelder also added that although the team
looks forward to the upcoming MPSF tourna
ment, it plans to take each game as it comes.
"We'll be playing Cal on Saturday,"
Uhlfelder said. "That'll be a big rematch. We're
going to take Saturday's game first."
