## No. 19 Card down No. 10 Cornell Team ends season on a high note, also heals Connecticut 
### ROHAN PURANIK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ihe Stanford women's lacrosse team
ended its regular season on fire, riding a
five-game winning streak that culminat
ed with a win against No. 10 Cornell on
Sunday.
The team's performance stood in
stark contrast to results from earlier this
season, when the squad had a 5-5 record
coming off of a three-game losing streak.
According to Coach Michele
Uhlfelder, those losses helped the team
redevelop its game plan.
"Some of the early losses allowed us
to refocus," Uhlfelder said. "They helped
us prioritize some of the things we want
ed to work on."
Uhlfelder added that the team's men
tal grit had aided their recent success.
"The team has shown a lot of re
silience," Uhlfelder said. "They have
been very mentally tough."
The current streak includes victories
over UC-Davis, Denver — the top
ranked seed in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation conference tourna
ment — and Loyola College, in addition
to victories over Connecticut and Cor
nell this past weekend.
The squad's first match of the week
end against Connecticut ended in suc
cess, thanks to the expert play of senior
attacks Megan Burkcr and Sarah Bach.
The Cardinal defeated the Huskies on
the road 10-7, as Bach scored four goals
for the Cardinal and Burker netted a hat
