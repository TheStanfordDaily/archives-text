# Questioning the Draft
## 
### 
Stanford had always been my
life-long dream, but 1 must
admit Southern California's
two national football titles did a su
perb job at making me think twice
about my college choice.
Attending USC would have kept
me apart from uneducated NorCal
sports fans and closer to the vastly
superior professional teams
throughout Los Angeles. With the
holy grounds of Dodger Stadium
just a bus ride away and the majesty
of the beautiful Staples Center a
mere bike ride up Figueroa Street,
the City of Troy indeed spurred me
to lick my chops.
Eventually, academics and con
cern for my own safety weighed
more heavily than athletics in my
decision, leading me to make the
right choice. And the hell that USC
has gone through this past week has
only helped to cement my content
ment with the decision.
Mark Sanchez, next season's
probable starting quarterback for
USC, was arrested Wednesday on
rape charges, just one night after
Trojan athletes attended a work
shop on sexual assault. DNA ex
aminations will commence next
week. With this incident, Sanchez
becomes the third Trojan football
player in two years to be charged
with sexual assault.
The Trojans' 2004 National
Championship may also be in jeop
ardy, as Reggie Bush is currently
under investigation for receiving
special monetary benefits from
agent Michael Michaels. According
to Michaels' attorney. Bush's par
ents wrongfully obtained over
$100,000 from the agent and lived
free of charge in his luxurious
southern California home. In Janu
ary, the former USC running back
decided to instead sign with agent
Joe Segal.
NCAA regulations prevent
players from receiving gifts from
potential agents. If either the
NCAA or the Pac-10 conference
finds Bush ineligible due to such vi
olations, the Bowl Championship
Series may consider stripping USC
of its 2004 title.
The Los Angeles Times also re
ported that wide receiver Dwayne
Jarrett paid less than his share of
room and board fees while rooming
with Matt Leinart at USC.
Legal problems are one thing.
It's USC — they're used to it by
now. But Trojans fans can't be
blamed for shedding a tear or two
after Saturday's NFL Draft deba
cle.
First, the Houston Texans
shocked the world Friday night by
signing North Carolina State defen
sive end Mario Williams as the first
pick, snubbing Heisman Trophy
winning Bush in the process.
The case can be made that the
Texans need to work on their de
fense, which ranked 31st in the
league last season. The only prob
lem is that theTexans had a once-in
lifetime opportunity with Bush — a
future franchise player destined to
soon be a Pro-Bowler.
Take it from a Dodgers fan who
saw the Boys in Blue trade away
Pedro Martinez because of a need
for a second baseman in the early
19905: When you come across a tal
ent like Bush, you don't let it slip
away, no matter what your roster
needs may be.
New Orleans has cause to cele
brate now, between the recent
Drew Brees pickup and theTexans'
utter lack of competence. Saints
fans are indeed justified in Satur
day's chants of "Reggie, Reggie!"
Quarterback Matt Leinart was
picked up by Arizona, slipping to
the 10th overall pick just one year
after he likely would have gone first
— had he turned pro following his
Heisnian-winning season.
With the third pick, the Titans
passed over Leinart in lieu of Texas
quarterback Vince Young, a player
with great potential but also too
much of a downside.
Sure, Young steamrolled over
the TYojans in the Rose Bowl like a
construction crew in the Stern park
ing lot. But that kind of rushing
quarterback won't hold his own in
the NFL —at least not any time
soon.
After just two losses in three sea
sons, and oodles of crunch-time ex
perience, Leinart is poised to start,
and succeed, in the NFL — this sea-
