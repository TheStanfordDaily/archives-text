## Bears sweep Cardinal in all nine Big Row races 
### JOHN CHOCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Down and out with two blades
tangled against the starboard gun
wale and a thousand meters to go, the
Stanford freshman four were in a
pickle. Exactly upon rowing into full
view of the bridge spectators, they
had encountered the full brunt of a
stiff headwind and all but lost an oar.
The novice boat's mismatched
opponent, the California varsity
four, was long gone, having already
run away with the race — and all
those races before it. The Big Row
had been a sweep, and a woman in a
blue and gold jacket was clever
enough to shout, "It's over, Stan
ford," at the young men still on the
course.
But it wasn't over for the novice
boat, and the four freshmen steadied
their oars.
"We regrouped, refocused and
continued on with our race," said
freshman Ryan DuChene, who held
the wayward oar. "We were all really
frustrated, but we knew that we had
to come back and race for respect."
Looking like anything but novices,
the unfazed freshmen dug into the
chop and stroked. They finished a
staggering 47 seconds down to Cal

and an encouraging four chins up.
Courage in the face of crisis was
Stanford's saving grace in a day that
left the Card with nothing but the
hope of a rebound.
An unstoppable California fleet
won all nine races, most by gaping
margins en route to a second consec
utive sweep of Stanford in the annu
al duel. The N0.2 Cal women collect
ed their fourth-straight Big Row win,
and the N0.3 Bear men hoisted the
Schwabacher Cup for the seven
teenth year in a row.
None of the races was close. The
Cardinal women lost by 16 seconds
or more in the three eight-woman
boat races, and they came no closer
than eight seconds in either four
race. The Stanford lightweights, in a
race with Cal's third-varsity open
weights, fell by 17 seconds.
"What we have to do as a team is
take those races as a learning experi
ence," open-weight co-captain Susan
Beville said. "I don't think the mar
gins from this weekend for any of the
women's boats represent our actual
speed."
A number of the Stanford women
were out with the "Toyon flu," —
likely a stomach virus — and most
boats raced with a reshuffled crew.
"It doesn't help us to try to explain

away the losses, though." said Beville.
whose crew hopes to earn an NCAA
berth with a third-place finish or bet
ter at the upcoming Pac-10 regatta.
"We have two weeks to get ready for
Pac-lOs, so that's what we'll do."
"Now we have to be an even
stronger team, to try to rebound
from this," women's coach Aimee
Baker said. "Losing to the N0.2 team
by 16 seconds doesn't bode well, so
we've got to do something special. I
know they're capable of it."
Baker's crew is no stranger to re
bounds.
"If anything, every time this team
has a truly disappointing perform
ance, they've turned it around and
done much better the next time,"
Baker said. "When their backs are to
the wall, they get the wake-up call.
They're a good strong team. They're
not 16 seconds behind Cal."
In the most anticipated race of the
day, Stanford's second-ranked men's
varsity eight fought back from an
early deficit to come within three
seconds of Cal. The Bears, who had
lost to Stanford in the grand final of
the San Diego Crew Classic April 2,
snapped the Card's undefeated sea
son at seven wins, a fact grimly an
nounced by the airhorn at the finish.
"That's got to be one of the worst

sounds on Earth for me to hear," jun
ior coxswain Alex Garcia said. "It's
just killer to see the guys in the boat,
and they hear it and then you just see
it and you just see who lost. It's offi
cial."
The Stanford boat had moved up
two seats on Cal in the S(X) meters.
"That was very important for our
boat to know that we're going to
have it all the way down the course,
and we're never going to give up."
Garcia said. "We're going to come
back. Cal and Stanford. We're even
now."
In evening the score, the Bears
may have given the Stanford men the
only thing their season needed — a
loss.
"We're hopeful that we can build
speed off of their speed," men's
coach Craig Amerkhanian said.
DuChene shared that optimism.
"In two weeks, we have Pac-lOs,
and believe me. we will be training
harder than ever to prove to every
body that we can be a championship
crew."

NOTE: In the April 27 article, "No. 2
Card pulling to win Big Row", The
Daily incorrectly claimed that the Cal
ifornia men's crew team has 12 schol
arships. The Daily regrets the error.
