# Deadline for priority passes as Draw nears
## 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
Students looking for an inside edge in this year's
Draw had to do so before Friday, when applications for
priority status closed. Some houses on campus have a
special priority system that, according to the Stanford
Housing Web site, "allows students that are interested
in a particular theme to have a better chance of drawing
into the house." Students are only allowed to obtain a
maximum of eight special-priority classifications.
The need for a special-priority system arises from
the unique circumstances created by theme houses.
Theoretically, if such a system were not employed,
houses could be filled with students who have very lit
tle to no interest in that residence's particular theme.
To correct this problem, priority in a certain house
generally takes precedence over the randomly assigned
Draw number. Requirements for obtaining priority
vary from house to house and can entail anything from
cleaning up after a co-op meal to simply filling out an
eating-club contract. But in general they involve some
sort of exhibition of interest in a house's theme.
The priority system is complicated by the fact that an
entire draw group applying to a house must all have pri
ority in order to be considered a priority group. Any
"incomplete" groups have all members dropped from
priority status. All students who complete the priority
requirements should know that they have been granted
a priority position in the housing Draw.
Residences that feature the priority system fall into
six categories: academic theme, language theme, ex
tracurricular theme, ethnic theme, co-op and special
dining arrangement. To further obscure the matter,
some houses offer two levels of priority. Higher levels
of interest must be shown to reach first priority in these
cases. Twenty-nine houses campus-wide feature the use
of this two-level system.
This year. Synergy, a co-op on south campus, offered
a multi-layered priority system. Ap
plicants were asked to complete a
house job — which involved any
thing from cooking, working in the
residence garden — taking a 30-
minute house tour and attending an
optional "Synposium" day during
which workshops on topics ranging
from beer making to contact-im
prov dance were offered.
The processes at other houses are
less involved.
"There is only first priority in
Suites; all students do is come out to
Suites and get an eating club manag
er to sign their priority form with
their names and drawmates' names
on it." said Leah Sawyer, eating club
manager and authorized special pri
ority representative for Suites. "This
ensures that students realize what

kind of a community Suites is. what
the eatingclubs are like,and that liv
ing in Suites entails that one must
pay dues to their assigned eating
club. Suites is a unique community,
and the priority form ensures that
students realize that. It is not a mat
ter of competition; anyone who gets
a signature has priority."
Students said they think the
process is fair enough, though some
wished it were simpler. Many dislike
the complex nature of the Draw
overall and look for ways around it.
"I know nothing about priority,"
confessed freshman Chris McCarty.
Others looked elsewhere to
avoid the confusion of the housing
lottery.
"I pledged a sorority partially so
1 wouldn't have to deal with the
draw," said freshman Erika Amaya.
Complaints aside. Housing is not
planning on any major changes this
year. Draw numbers will be posted
at residential offices on May 10 and
on Axess on Mav 11.
