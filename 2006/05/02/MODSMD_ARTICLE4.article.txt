## Humanities lab promotes crossdisciplinary work Open house today will feature projects and grant information 
### JULIE KLEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Students interested in tapping an interdisciplinary
"brain trust" of various academics, museum curators and
foundations â€” or looking for a grant to do combined re
search in the arts, sciences or technologies can indulge
their interests at Stanford Humanities Lab's end-of-year
open house today. The event, which will take place from
3 to 5:30 p.m. in Wallenberg Hall, will showcase 20 of its
current projects and provide information about avail
able grants for the upcoming academic year.
According to a presentation by SHL's founder and
Director Jeffrey Schnapp, the lab is "an oxymoron. It is
neither a media lab nor a technology lab nor a tradition-
al humanities research center nor a
teaching support facility. It is a site for
experimenting."
Schnapps own diverse interests
represent what he hopes to demon
strate in his lab. He is a professor of
Italian literature, French and Italian
and comparative literature. He
speaks six different languages, and is
also a semi-professional motorcycle
racer. The lab looks for projects that
similarly combine many different ac
ademic areas.
The lab currently has four direc
tors. Besides Schnapp the leadership
includes Henry Lowood, a curator of
the History of Science and Technolo
gy Collections, the Germanic Collec
tions and Film and Media Collec
tions. Lowood teaches courses in his
tory of science and technology and
game studies at Stanford. Michael
Shanks, classics and cultural and so
cial anthropology professor, directs
the lab as well as teaches and re
searches archaeology at Stanford.
Associate Director William Cock

ayne, who oversees the day-to-day
management of the lab, holds a Phi)
in design research and degrees in
computer science and mechanical
engineering, as well as multiple
patents.
"We solicit ideas from faculty and
students for a project that could satis
fy the goals laid out by Jeffrey," Cock
ayne wrote in an email to The Daily.
"Along with money, SHL provides
support for each project. We have a
full time technology guru, and we
provide outside management sup
port. We help the projects find collab
orators across campus and within in
dustry or funding agencies, and we
help the projects get their bills paid
on time.
" ITiis is often a very important
problem for eminent academics," he
added.
A committee of six scholars from
the humanities, arts and sciences
funds a limited number of new proj
ects each year. Each is granted
$1(),(HM) in its first year, and most
projects seek outside private funding
as well.
lTie open house will showcase a
wide variety of current projects,
which include Asian American Art,
Life to the Second Power, Virtual

Mandala and Historinet. The proj
ects are led by an assortment of un
dergraduate and graduate students,
professors and library curators.
SHL has a distinct set of goals that
influence the projects the center
chooses to fund.
"SHL is exploratory and experi
mental," according to the SHL Web
site. "Collaboration is an essential
feature. Research bridges disciplines,
linking the humanities, the sciences
and technology. Projects are output
oriented, culminate in work that falls
outside the traditional boundaries of
humanities and include an outreach
dimension for non-specialist audi
ences."
While most Stanford students see
a clear division between "fuzzy" and
"techie" disciplines, Schnapp hopes
the SHL can bridge this gap. One of
the lab's slogans, "Cross-breeding
fuzzies and techies," sums up his ulti
mate goal.
"We want to bring together stu
dents and scholars from science and
technology fields with their humani
ties counterparts." he said. "We hope
to contribute to the training of a new
kind of technologically literate
'fuzzy' and a new kind of humanisti
cally literate 'techie.'"
