# Immigration protest fills San Jose streets
## 
### GERRY SHIH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
An estimated 100,000 demonstrators
flooded the San Jose streets yesterday in
the latest highly-visible rally for immigra
tion rights. Bright yellow banners, violet
parasols and American and Mexican flags
of varying sizes interrupted the slowly-ad
vancing monochrome blanket of white T
shirts that packed the major thoroughfares
of King Road and Santa Clara Street.
Concerned with the burgeoning nation
al debate over immigration rights and en
couraged by local Spanish-language radio
and TV, the predominantly Mexican-
American throng took to the streets, con
verging into one of the largest rallies in San
Jose history.
"I did this to show solidarity, to support
our culture," said Maribel Bonilla, a San
Jose native who works at Proyecto Primav
era Drug and Alcohol Rehab Center. "I
boycotted and I didn't go to work. It was
everywhere in the newspapers, radio,
everywhere,"
Bonilla added enthusiastically,'it's one
of the best rallies I've ever seen. Hopefully,
it'll be history and we'll see the change
we're fighting for."
Men waving signs, women pushing
strollers — old and young alike — joined
in chants of "Si se puede!" or "Yes we can!"
as the crowd walked the three and a half
miles from the intersection of Story and
King Roads to the San Jose City Hall be
neath an unforgiving afternoon sun. Pul
sating snare drum rhythms and the chop
ping of helicopter blades overhead accom
panied the demonstrators' boisterous voic
es as countless more watched from the
sidewalks.
Many, including children, held yellow

and black printed signs high overhead
reading: "Amnistia. Full Rights for All Im
migrants" while others displayed home
made signs such as "We came 2 work 4 u,
not steal from u" and "We Have a Dream
Too." One woman held a sign:"The Ist Im
migrants came on the Mayflower" by the
curb. A girl, no more than six years old, sat
in a wagon pulled by her father and held a
placard displaying: "I'm not a criminal!"
Near the Highway 101 overpass, a man
named Jose sat by the curb with his ten
month-old son. A US. citizen by birth liv
ing in Milpitas, Jose said he showed up to
support everybody. Jose Jr. clutched a card
board sign declaring"! am the future gen
eration" in his tiny fingers.
"I have family who are illegal here, and
what frustrates me is that there's a bunch of
racism on TV," he said. "I saw a woman on
Fox News who had more of an accent than
me, abusing immigrants. This country was
founded on the work of immigrants, and
just because they've been here for more
generations, they think they can kick
everyone else out. Junior here is a third
generation immigrant. He's the future of
this country."
The crowd stopped periodically to
watch young men in tank tops dance ani
matedly and bang their drums — com
plete with colorful stickers reading "Stop
Arnold" and "Bush Step Down" — in a
rising crescendo. Father Steven Brown of
the St. Maria Goretti Church in San Jose
looked distinctly out of place, but said he
enjoyed it all the same. Brown's diocese,
which he said is one-third Spanish-speak
ing. helped organize the rally.
"We came out here in a show of solidar
ity with the immigrants, and it's been a big
success," he said. "It's much more publi
cized, but that always provokes a back

lash."
Sixteen-year-old Alma Rios,a freshman
at San Jose's James Lick High School, said
she skipped classes yesterday with the en
couragement of her parents. Alongside her
was her brother, 11-year old Eddie, who
did attend Ryan Elementary for the day.
"There was a state pre-test today" he
said. "The teachers told us if we skipped
school and came out, the cops would come
and comb the streets and throw us back in
school."
"If we're already here, we should have
rights too," Alma added and shrugged. "We
might as well."
At the end of the march, the crowd
around City I lall grew to its maximum size
around 6 p.m., as demonstrators packed an
upper deck of the building and chanted


In a historic rally yesterday, protesters displayed signs and both American and Mexican flags in San Jose. An estimated 100,000
people took to the streets as part of a nationwide demonstration for immigrant rights.

Panfilo, a 49-year-old construc
tion worker, sat quietly in the plaza
and watched with reserved opti
mism.
"If they keep this up, then there
might be an answer...maybe for
some, not all," he said wearily. When
asked how American immigration
legislation impacts families, he spoke
with the simplicity that accompanies
experience: "When you go hack and
forth once or twice a year, there is a
lot of fear and danger — police,
wilderness, animals biting you.
"I'm old, and there's not too much
to worry about, but I think about the
youth," he said.'i think there is hope
there for the youth to live without
fear."
