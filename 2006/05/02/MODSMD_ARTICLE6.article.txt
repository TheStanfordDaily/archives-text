# Reporters say no end in sight for Iraq War
## 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
On the third anniversary of Presi
dent George W. Bush's "mission ac
complished" declaration, three battle
hardened war reporters and two Stan
ford professors told a full Kresge Au
ditorium last night that Iraq has be
come an increasingly dangerous place
for reporters.
The panelists served up sharp
tongued criticism of the administra
tion and offered an ominous view of
the future in the two-hour event spon
sored by the Communications De
partment.
In Iraq, instead of simply playing
the role of messenger, the reporters
themselves have become targets.
Journalist Jill Caroll's safe return to
the States last month placed press
members in the spotlight.
"We are hunted, and we know
we're being hunted," said Anne Gar
rels, a Baghdad correspondent for
National Public Radio (NPR). She
added that the Iraqis on her payroll
"have a price on their heads."
Reporters are far more at risk in
Iraq than they ever were in Vietnam
because the insurgents see them as
partisans, one panelist said.
"I don't think there's ever been a
place where the reporting is as dan
gerous as it is in Iraq," said George
Packer, a staff writer for The New
Yorker."ln Baghdad, we're in danger
because no one believes we're neu
tral."
Dexter Filkins, an award-winning
Baghdad correspondent for The New
York Times, said that he has been held
at gunpoint, threatened with death
and has had bricks thrown at him.
"We can't report everything that's
happening there, and it's pretty frus
trating," he said.
Filkins said that his American re
porters could not follow up on reports
that innocent civilians had died after
an American bombing raid because
traveling to the area would put him
and his team in too much danger.
The New York Times keeps two
houses where its reporters live and
work, he said. The paper has a 35-
member armed guard militia and its
own checkpoints. Often the risk-tak
ing reporters are unable to go out into
the field.
Garrels declined to offer details
about NPR's security arrangements
for her personal safety, except to say
that NPR had bought two $75,(XX) ar
mored vehicles. She worried that the
media overall has become less active
in the region because of increasing
safety risks and the high cost of main
taining a staff in the country.
"We're running out of people who
want to go," she said."lt's costing us a
fortune. The line of people waiting to
go to Iraq and follow in my footsteps
is non-existent."
Hoover Senior Fellow Larry Dia
mond said he would not take the
same risks reporters take to get their
stories. Diamond, who served as an
advisor to the Coalition Provisional
Authority (CPA), said that journal
ists' security measures pale in com
parison to the protection CPA offi
cials have at their disposal.
"Much of what [journalists] do is
completely on their own initiative, in
terms of the risks they take, the stories
they choose to write and how they go
about it,"he said. "It occurred to me
[while visiting with journalists in Iraq]
that they were really at greater per
sonal risk than probably the majority
of American servicemen and women
in the country."
The panel members said that the
risks they take have their rewards.
They also agreed that journalists are
an important check on the American
government in Iraq.
"I think we are able to add a cor
rective to what otherwise is a delu

sional picture offered by the adminis
tration," Garrels said." We give a pret
ty accurate picture of what really is
going on."
A Fourth Estate is a "vital pillar of
our democracy," Diamond said.
The panelists all blamed the ad
ministration for goading the country
into war under false pretenses.
"We all kind of assumed [before
the invasion] that when you take
down tyranny, what happens is free
dom," Filkins said. "In fact, it was an
archy."
Diamond passionately raised his
voice as he chided the administration
for what he deems deception. He said
the current American ambassador
has made some wise decisions in Iraq,
but the country has already been
beset by civil war.
"(Dr. Zalmay) Khalilzad has been
the most flexible, open and forthcom
ing of the three [American ambassa
dors]," he noted.
But it may be too late to prevent
the nation from sliding further into
chaos, said the journalists — who saw
the establishment falling apart with
their own eyes.
Khalilzad may be "a deft maneu
verer" but "it's a long way into the
game." Garrels said.
Each of the panelists firmly dis
missed the idea of a rapid, immediate

American troop pullout.
If the United States pulled its
140,000 troops out tomorrow, there
would be a "bloodbath orders of mag
nitude higher than anything we've
seen before," Filkins said. "We can't
stay here any longer, but we can't
leave either.
"Personally, I think it's probably
too late," he added.
The damned-if-you-do, damned
if-you-don't mentality defined the
discussion of Iraq's future.
"We're well into the quagmire,"
Packer said. "Whichever way you
move, it will be bad. You have to think
through the consequences of your ac
tions."
Withdrawing would be the "worst
national security nightmare" in the
post-World War II era. Diamond said.
"The problem is that the situation
is getting worse in many respects," he
said. "The growth of the Shiite militias
and Muqtada al-Sadr [the leader of
the dominant United Iraqi Alliance]
are very frightening...l'm not sure
there's an answer at this point."
The panelists debated the value of
reaching out to the United Nations
and the European Union.
Diamond suggested involving the
U.N. in peacekeeping operations.
"There's no peace to keep," Filkins
replied.

dent George W. Bush's "mission ac
complished" declaration, three battle
hardened war reporters and two Stan
ford professors told a full Kresge Au
ditorium last night that Iraq has be
come an increasingly dangerous place
for reporters.
The panelists served up sharp
tongued criticism of the administra
tion and offered an ominous view of
the future in the two-hour event spon
sored by the Communications De
partment.
In Iraq, instead of simply playing
the role of messenger, the reporters
themselves have become targets.
Journalist Jill Caroll's safe return to
the States last month placed press
members in the spotlight.
"We are hunted, and we know
we're being hunted," said Anne Gar
rels, a Baghdad correspondent for
National Public Radio (NPR). She
added that the Iraqis on her payroll
"have a price on their heads."
Reporters are far more at risk in
Iraq than they ever were in Vietnam
because the insurgents see them as
partisans, one panelist said.
"I don't think there's ever been a
place where the reporting is as dan
gerous as it is in Iraq," said George
Packer, a staff writer for The New
Yorker."ln Baghdad, we're in danger
because no one believes we're neu
tral."
Dexter Filkins, an award-winning
Baghdad correspondent for The New
York Times, said that he has been held
at gunpoint, threatened with death
and has had bricks thrown at him.
"We can't report everything that's
happening there, and it's pretty frus
trating," he said.
Filkins said that his American re
porters could not follow up on reports
that innocent civilians had died after
an American bombing raid because
traveling to the area would put him
and his team in too much danger.
The New York Times keeps two
houses where its reporters live and
work, he said. The paper has a 35-
member armed guard militia and its
own checkpoints. Often the risk-tak
ing reporters are unable to go out into
the field.
Garrels declined to offer details
about NPR's security arrangements
for her personal safety, except to say
that NPR had bought two $75,(XX) ar
mored vehicles. She worried that the
media overall has become less active
in the region because of increasing
safety risks and the high cost of main
taining a staff in the country.
"We're running out of people who
want to go," she said."lt's costing us a
fortune. The line of people waiting to
go to Iraq and follow in my footsteps
is non-existent."
Hoover Senior Fellow Larry Dia
mond said he would not take the
same risks reporters take to get their
stories. Diamond, who served as an
advisor to the Coalition Provisional
Authority (CPA), said that journal
ists' security measures pale in com
parison to the protection CPA offi
cials have at their disposal.
"Much of what [journalists] do is
completely on their own initiative, in
terms of the risks they take, the stories
they choose to write and how they go
about it,"he said. "It occurred to me
[while visiting with journalists in Iraq]
that they were really at greater per
sonal risk than probably the majority
of American servicemen and women
in the country."
The panel members said that the
risks they take have their rewards.
They also agreed that journalists are
an important check on the American
government in Iraq.
"I think we are able to add a cor
rective to what otherwise is a delu

sional picture offered by the adminis
tration," Garrels said." We give a pret
ty accurate picture of what really is
going on."
A Fourth Estate is a "vital pillar of
our democracy," Diamond said.
The panelists all blamed the ad
ministration for goading the country
into war under false pretenses.
"We all kind of assumed [before
the invasion] that when you take
down tyranny, what happens is free
dom," Filkins said. "In fact, it was an
archy."
Diamond passionately raised his
voice as he chided the administration
for what he deems deception. He said
the current American ambassador
has made some wise decisions in Iraq,
but the country has already been
beset by civil war.
"(Dr. Zalmay) Khalilzad has been
the most flexible, open and forthcom
ing of the three [American ambassa
dors]," he noted.
But it may be too late to prevent
the nation from sliding further into
chaos, said the journalists — who saw
the establishment falling apart with
their own eyes.
Khalilzad may be "a deft maneu
verer" but "it's a long way into the
game." Garrels said.
Each of the panelists firmly dis
missed the idea of a rapid, immediate

American troop pullout.
If the United States pulled its
140,000 troops out tomorrow, there
would be a "bloodbath orders of mag
nitude higher than anything we've
seen before," Filkins said. "We can't
stay here any longer, but we can't
leave either.
"Personally, I think it's probably
too late," he added.
The damned-if-you-do, damned
if-you-don't mentality defined the
discussion of Iraq's future.
"We're well into the quagmire,"
Packer said. "Whichever way you
move, it will be bad. You have to think
through the consequences of your ac
tions."
Withdrawing would be the "worst
national security nightmare" in the
post-World War II era. Diamond said.
"The problem is that the situation
is getting worse in many respects," he
said. "The growth of the Shiite militias
and Muqtada al-Sadr [the leader of
the dominant United Iraqi Alliance]
are very frightening...l'm not sure
there's an answer at this point."
The panelists debated the value of
reaching out to the United Nations
and the European Union.
Diamond suggested involving the
U.N. in peacekeeping operations.
"There's no peace to keep," Filkins
replied.
