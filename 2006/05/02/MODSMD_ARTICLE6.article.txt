# Reporters say no end in sight for Iraq War
## 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
On the third anniversary of Presi
dent George W. Bush's "mission ac
complished" declaration, three battle
hardened war reporters and two Stan
ford professors told a full Kresge Au
ditorium last night that Iraq has be
come an increasingly dangerous place
for reporters.
The panelists served up sharp
tongued criticism of the administra
tion and offered an ominous view of
the future in the two-hour event spon
sored by the Communications De
partment.
In Iraq, instead of simply playing
the role of messenger, the reporters
themselves have become targets.
Journalist Jill Caroll's safe return to
the States last month placed press
members in the spotlight.
"We are hunted, and we know
we're being hunted," said Anne Gar
rels, a Baghdad correspondent for
National Public Radio (NPR). She
added that the Iraqis on her payroll
"have a price on their heads."
Reporters are far more at risk in
Iraq than they ever were in Vietnam
because the insurgents see them as
partisans, one panelist said.
"I don't think there's ever been a
place where the reporting is as dan
gerous as it is in Iraq," said George
Packer, a staff writer for The New
Yorker."ln Baghdad, we're in danger
because no one believes we're neu

Dexter Filkins, an award-winning
Baghdad correspondent for The New
York Times, said that he has been held
at gunpoint, threatened with death
and has had bricks thrown at him.
"We can't report everything that's
happening there, and it's pretty frus
trating," he said.
Filkins said that his American re
porters could not follow up on reports
that innocent civilians had died after
an American bombing raid because
traveling to the area would put him
and his team in too much danger.
The New York Times keeps two
houses where its reporters live and
work, he said. The paper has a 35-
member armed guard militia and its
own checkpoints. Often the risk-tak
ing reporters are unable to go out into
the field.
Garrels declined to offer details
about NPR's security arrangements
for her personal safety, except to say
that NPR had bought two $75,(XX) ar
mored vehicles. She worried that the
media overall has become less active
in the region because of increasing
safety risks and the high cost of main
taining a staff in the country.
"We're running out of people who
want to go," she said."lt's costing us a
