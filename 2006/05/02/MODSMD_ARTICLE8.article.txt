## Law School lecturer addresses Senate Dan Siciliano argued for economic benefits of immigration 
### ADA YEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The recent Congressional push for new immi
gration legislation has garnered widespread
media attention, and yesterday, students and ac
tivists nationwide protested current guest worker
program proposals. Apart from students, howev
er, Stanford faculty have played a leading role in
the discussion. Last week, Dan Siciliano, execu
tive director of the Program in Law, Economics
and Business at the Law School, joined a Senate
Judiciary Committee panel to discuss the eco
nomic impacts of immigration.
Siciliano argued that immigrants have a net
positive impact on the economy. He says that a
fiscal view of immigration, which takes into ac
count tax dollars only, holds that immigrants
are a net loss to the economy However, accord
ing to Siciliano, this view fails to consider other
contributions that immigrants make to the
economy.
"The fiscal issue is about taxes — how much
you collect and how much you pay — but it
doesn't necessarily describe what economic
contributions someone makes to the economy
overall," he said. "If they are part of a business
that makes profits, then they are growing na
tional income. They may enable other individu
als to generate personal income, and those indi
viduals may in fact pay taxes which they may not
have otherwise paid."
Immigrants help the economy by filling impor
tant low-wage, unskilled jobs that are left vacant
by native-born workers in a fast-growing econo
my. These jobs are essential for supporting higher
wage jobs that require more skill, Siciliano said.
"Immigrants fill very critical jobs for which

there just aren't enough people," he said. "For
example, there is a tremendous boom in new
house building. Roofing is a critical component
of this, and roofers are having trouble finding
people to fill those jobs. We have architects, real
estate developers and advanced craftsmen who
can't get their job done unless they have some
one to roof."
Furthermore, immigrants fit the profile of such
jobs well, since many are young and less-educat
ed. Returning to the construction example, Sicil
iano explained that roofing pays good wages, but
the jobs are hard to fill because they are labor in
tensive. Increasing numbers of native born high
school graduates are unlikely to try roofing — or
analogous jobs in fields like elderly health care
and fast-food retail.
"It's kind of a young person's game," he said.
Countering Harvard economist George Bor
jas' frequently-cited statistic, that immigrants de
press unskilled workers' wages by 8 percent, Sicil
iano cited a recent paper published by Ottaviano
and Giovanni Peri. Peri and Peri assert that by fill
ing low-wage, unskilled jobs, immigrants in fact
help economic growth. According to Siciliano, the
labor provided by immigrants allows small-to
medium businesspeople — who are centers of in
novation and growth — to invest capital and cre
ate new jobs.
"Most recent studies show that immigrants en
able the economy to do things it couldn't do be
fore — they enable it to grow," he said. "Regard
less of what immigrants cost, 91 percent of people
are better off." The remaining 9 percent are vic
tims primarily of disappearing manufacturing
jobs due to globalization — not immigration, he
said.
As far as immigration policy solutions, Sicil
iano said that guest worker programs make the
same false assumptions from an exclusively fiscal
perspective — that immigrants must be bad for
the economy if they amount to a negative in tax
dollars. Thus, guest worker programs try to supply

a labor need with immigrants, but without imme
diately incorporating them as citizens.
"Guest worker programs seem like a tidy way
to have your cake and eat it too," he said. "The
guest worker programs as proposed don't really
solve a lot of the problems and have a lot of very
fundamental drawbacks."
Siciliano would support a bill that grants legal
status to undocumented immigrants already in
this country, and cites the McCain and Kennedy
proposal as the "most thoughtful" so far.
"A compromise bill that comes closest to solv
ing a lot of the problems would address the issue
of what to do with people who are already here —
they're the most important in the economic com
ponent," he said.
At the Law School, Siciliano lectures in corpo
rate governance and finance. Outside of his re
search on these topics, he is a research fellow with
the Immigration Policy Center (IPC) at the
American Immigration Law Foundation. He tes
tified before the House Committee on Education
and the Workforce as part of a similar panel last
fall.
Siciliano acknowledges that the immigration
debate transcends economic analysis.
"The politics of this issue are very complicated,
and it's difficult because it's an emotional issue,"
he said.
"The impressive thing about the proposed
legislation is that there is a pathway to legaliza
tion," said Assistant Law Prof. Jayashri Srikanti
ah."lt's a real acknowledgement of who's doing
a lot of the work here. However, there are lots of
really harsh provisions that are being over
looked — provisions that would increase num
ber of noncitizens who are detained and expand
the grounds on which they can be deported.
"We have to think about what is fair and what
is just for these people, who in many cases have
worked here for most of their lives and are just as
much a part of our national fabric as other immi
grants with legal status," Srikantiah added.
