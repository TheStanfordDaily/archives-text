## Faceoff with Facebook 
### 
The biggest obstacle to writing a column
about the Facebook is the Facebook itself.
It is sinfully distracting, even for ethically
elevated Daily columnists, stretching the limits of
necessary diligence for column writing.
Soon, the baser curiosities of the feeble mind
assume control. The columnist, hooked and hyp
notized. ignores the moral pangs telling him not to
pry into the profiles of unsuspecting unknowns.
The information he seeks devolves from the ba
sics to personal errata and finally to pictures.
Purposeless searches—like statistical varia
tion in the number of singles in different depart
ments at Stanford, which would have sounded ab
surd a few hours ago—become perfectly accept
able queries. Suddenly it is interesting to muse
about the undergrad rep of that geeky looking
psychology grad.
I tore my attention away from the cute co-eds,
and moved my attention to the plethora of groups
on the cyber hangout. The sheer number is over
whelming. They vary from intelligent and intrigu
ing to interesting and instigating. Isn't it weird that
'Stanford Students for Procrastination' has more
members than "Everyone at Stanford'?
There are claims that about 85 percent of col
lege students have accounts with the service,
while 70 percent of them visit at least once daily.
Hell, 70 percent of students don't even brush
their teeth daily.
1 slowly recognized how my generation has
embraced drive-thru relationships in the cyber
world. It's rumored that an average student
spends 51 minutes on the Facebook everyday. If
you're at Stanford, then you still have to attend
classes, write reports, submit homework and take
exams. So, where exactly do those 51 minutes
come from? They come from time you would pre
sumably have otherwise allotted for social activi
ties. Accordingly, aren't social networking sites ac
tually making us more anti-social?
Earlier, making a friend usually required a
huge investment of time. It meant spending time
together, sharing joys and sorrows, smoking that
first cigarette, and playing pranks and getting
caught together. Wonderful movies have been
made about friendship. Now being friends means
writing "what's up" on his or her Facebook wall.
Almost everyone I looked for on Facebook had
hundreds of friends. Your number of friends is a
measure of coolness and relative fame. There is a
desperate urge to convince yourself and everyone
else that you are loved and supported because
you have a big number next to your list of friends.
Well, if you are sitting in front of your computer
sending friend requests to 400 supposed friends,
then chances are that you are not actually talking
to them or spending time with them.
Back in the good old days, if a person had ro
mantic feelings for someone, he or she would
seek out small bits of information about his or
her beloved. One would secretly follow one's
sweetheart around campus to discover the iden
tity of her friends. Expensive lunches were then
bought for those friends to find out her phone
number. There would be long late-night discus
sions with roommates to discern her interests
and chose the perfect gift. The cloud of mystery
added much of romantic thrill to it. Now you just
log on to Facebook to get all that information.
And as for all the elaborate courting—now, you
just poke her.
As social networking becomes more cus
tomized, commodified and commercialized the
charm goes away. We don't have buddies any
more, just huge networks of acquaintances with
whom we rarely have time to socialize because we
are busy building our network of online friends.
Facebook, MySpace, Orkut, MSN, Yahoo!
Messenger or any and all of the networking tools
students use to maintain friendships are great.
But, shouldn't we use them to complement our in
teractions with real people, not substitute for
them? Looking at attractive members of the op
posite sex is certainly one of the best uses of a
youth's time. But instead of looking at them in
two-dimensional snapshots, it's more fun to look
at them in coffee shops and parks, in book clubs
and playgrounds, in discussion forums and public
lectures, in concerts and shopping complexes. And
of course, some of the above meetings could be
arranged in five minutes using any of the net
working sites.
How about someone at Stanford starting up a
social networking site? Not a Web site, but a phys
ical site. Maybe White Plaza will do. Everyone can
come together at some designated time to White
Plaza and just meet up with everyone else who is
interested in killing time. It won't be that difficult
to find people and get arranged into groups: those
interested in discussing politics or music or exact
ly why Colorado kicks the ass of every other state.
Maybe these can also be pre-arranged using the
Web sites. But if we've got 51 minutes a day for
networking, shouldn't we decide how to best allo
cate it online and offline?
