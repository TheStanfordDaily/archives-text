Only in California." For Mis
sourans, this sentiment used to
apply to the Golden State's
West-Coast quirks, like the Governator
or flip-flops in January. Now they use it
snidely in response to a far more sinister
oddity: lawn mowers with catalytic con
verters.
In 1998, the California Air Re
sources Board set new limits on emis
sions from "small off-road engines," or
those less than 25 horsepower. Affected
equipment ranges from your sit-and
mow John Deere to the noisiest of gas
powered leaf blowers.
To Sen. Christopher "Kit" Bond (R-
Mo.), recent moves to fully implement
new emissions limits are emblematic of
California's unhealthy regulatory ad
diction. Not coincidentally, Missouri is
home to two factories of The New York
Times-described "dominant engine
maker in the struggling lawn care equip
ment field," Briggs & Stratton.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Ca.), howev
er, has maintained that the new controls
"would be an important step forward to
cleaning our state's dirty air." Feinstein
sees California's move as more than a
regulatory craze, but as the cutting edge
in air pollution management. She's
been quoted saying, "My comment to
Briggs & Stratton is: You can learn from
the dinosaur. Mutate or you're gone."
Americans — who could be charac
terized not just by NIMBY, not in my
backyard, but also by GOOMBY (Gov
ernment Out Of My Backyard) — are
unlikely to accept policies governing
their turf without due cause. So does
regulating lawn mowers and their kin
really make a difference?
Certainly, we have seen that regulat
ing cars does. Even with stringent regu
lations and better technology, urban
areas with heavy traffic continue to
have trouble with car pollution. And
that's with carbon monoxide emissions
more than 12 times lower and hydrocar
bon emissions more than 35 times lower
per mile driven than they were before
controls were introduced. Who knows
what the state of air quality would be
without them?
The celebrated invention in comply
ing with these tighter controls has been
the catalytic converter — the device
lawn equipment manufacturers believe
they may have to add to their products
if California's regulations go into effect.
In burning fuel to power engines, one
of two scenarios is likely to occur: the
ratio of oxygen to hydrocarbons in your
fuel will be too great, leaving nitrogen
to react with oxygen to form the pollu
tant NOx; or, the ratio of oxygen to hy
drocarbons will be too low, keeping
your fuel from fully combusting and
leading to the escape of unburned gas
and carbon monoxide. As far as air pol
lution is concerned, neither of these is
good. Both NOx and reactive hydrocar
bons from unburned gasoline exacer
bate the production of urban ozone,
what we call smog. (It is important to
distinguish urban ozone, a pollutant,
from stratospheric ozone, which forms
the ozone layer and protects us from
skin-cancer causing ultraviolet radia
tion. There is a catchy rhyme to help re
member the difference, but since I can't
remember the rhyme, I'll introduce my
own: "Ozone — good up high, bad in
your eye.")
Catalytic converters run the products
of combustion over a series of catalysts
(now the name makes sense, right?) to
turn unwanted byproducts of incom
plete combustion into less-harmful en
tities. NOx is turned into molecular ni
trogen, a natural component of the at
mosphere; carbon monoxide is turned
into carbon dioxide; and unburned fuel
is turned into either carbon dioxide or
water vapor. Removing a catalytic con
verter from a newer car would lead to
more than a 400 percent increase in hy
drocarbon and carbon monoxide emis
sions.
All cars nowadays come equipped
with catalytic converters; if yours does
n't have one, good luck passing a Cali
fornia smog test. The state's proposed
reductions for small engines by 2010 —
a 67 percent reduction in hydrocarbon
emissions and a total 74 percent reduc
tion in hydrocarbon and NOx emissions
— will require either advances in en
gine efficiency or the installation of
golf-ball-sized catalytic converters,
adding somewhere between $0 to $40 to
the current cost of most equipment. As
it stands, most small engines are less ef
ficient than automobile engines.

In terms of emission benefits,
the California Air Resources
Board claims that the reductions
will be equivalent to eliminating
250,000 cars.
To convince residents that they
shouldn't look so innocently at
their personal chainsaws, the
Board showed that using a chain
saw with a two-stroke engine (less
efficient than the four-stroke en
gines used in cars and some lawn
equipment) for two hours gener
ates as many hydrocarbon emis
sions as driving a 1995 car for 2,500
miles.

It also reports that, per gallon,
lawnmowers pollute 93 times more
smog-forming emissions (e.g. NOx
and hydrocarbons) than a current
new car; for some engines, as much
as 25 percent of the exhaust is raw
fuel. Added up, all these emissions
comprise about 1 percent of Cali
fornia's total emissions, and 7 per
cent of its emissions from mobile
sources.
The manufacturers in Missouri
hoped to show that installing cat
alytic converters on small equip
ment posed a fire hazard. Howev
er, an Environmental Protection
Agency study released this March
stating that they posed no signifi
cant risk has likely put the last nail
in the coffin for these efforts.
And a recent report released by
the National Research Council

added insult to injury to Sen.
Bond, stating that "California
should continue its pioneering role
in setting mobile-source emissions
standards. The role will aid the
state's efforts to achieve air quali
ty goals and will allow it to contin
ue to be a proving ground for new
emissions-control technologies
that benefit California and the rest
of the nation."
Judge for yourself if you think
the benefits justify the costs, but
we in Palo Alto shouldn't be too
worried. After all. we're used to it
gas-powered leaf blowers are
already illegal here.

Only in California." For Mis
sourans, this sentiment used to
apply to the Golden State's
West-Coast quirks, like the Governator
or flip-flops in January. Now they use it
snidely in response to a far more sinister
oddity: lawn mowers with catalytic con
verters.
In 1998, the California Air Re
sources Board set new limits on emis
sions from "small off-road engines," or
those less than 25 horsepower. Affected
equipment ranges from your sit-and
mow John Deere to the noisiest of gas
powered leaf blowers.
To Sen. Christopher "Kit" Bond (R-
Mo.), recent moves to fully implement
new emissions limits are emblematic of
California's unhealthy regulatory ad
diction. Not coincidentally, Missouri is
home to two factories of The New York
Times-described "dominant engine
maker in the struggling lawn care equip
ment field," Briggs & Stratton.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Ca.), howev
er, has maintained that the new controls
"would be an important step forward to
cleaning our state's dirty air." Feinstein
sees California's move as more than a
regulatory craze, but as the cutting edge
in air pollution management. She's
been quoted saying, "My comment to
Briggs & Stratton is: You can learn from
the dinosaur. Mutate or you're gone."
Americans — who could be charac
terized not just by NIMBY, not in my
backyard, but also by GOOMBY (Gov
ernment Out Of My Backyard) — are
unlikely to accept policies governing
their turf without due cause. So does
regulating lawn mowers and their kin
really make a difference?
Certainly, we have seen that regulat
ing cars does. Even with stringent regu
lations and better technology, urban
areas with heavy traffic continue to
have trouble with car pollution. And
that's with carbon monoxide emissions
more than 12 times lower and hydrocar
bon emissions more than 35 times lower
per mile driven than they were before
controls were introduced. Who knows
what the state of air quality would be
without them?
The celebrated invention in comply
ing with these tighter controls has been
the catalytic converter — the device
lawn equipment manufacturers believe
they may have to add to their products
if California's regulations go into effect.
In burning fuel to power engines, one
of two scenarios is likely to occur: the
ratio of oxygen to hydrocarbons in your
fuel will be too great, leaving nitrogen
to react with oxygen to form the pollu
tant NOx; or, the ratio of oxygen to hy
drocarbons will be too low, keeping
your fuel from fully combusting and
leading to the escape of unburned gas
and carbon monoxide. As far as air pol
lution is concerned, neither of these is
good. Both NOx and reactive hydrocar
bons from unburned gasoline exacer
bate the production of urban ozone,
what we call smog. (It is important to
distinguish urban ozone, a pollutant,
from stratospheric ozone, which forms
the ozone layer and protects us from
skin-cancer causing ultraviolet radia
tion. There is a catchy rhyme to help re
member the difference, but since I can't
remember the rhyme, I'll introduce my
own: "Ozone — good up high, bad in
your eye.")
Catalytic converters run the products
of combustion over a series of catalysts
(now the name makes sense, right?) to
turn unwanted byproducts of incom
plete combustion into less-harmful en
tities. NOx is turned into molecular ni
trogen, a natural component of the at
mosphere; carbon monoxide is turned
into carbon dioxide; and unburned fuel
is turned into either carbon dioxide or
water vapor. Removing a catalytic con
verter from a newer car would lead to
more than a 400 percent increase in hy
drocarbon and carbon monoxide emis
sions.
All cars nowadays come equipped
with catalytic converters; if yours does
n't have one, good luck passing a Cali
fornia smog test. The state's proposed
reductions for small engines by 2010 —
a 67 percent reduction in hydrocarbon
emissions and a total 74 percent reduc
tion in hydrocarbon and NOx emissions
— will require either advances in en
gine efficiency or the installation of
golf-ball-sized catalytic converters,
adding somewhere between $0 to $40 to
the current cost of most equipment. As
it stands, most small engines are less ef
ficient than automobile engines.

Significant Figures
In terms of emission benefits,
the California Air Resources
Board claims that the reductions
will be equivalent to eliminating
250,000 cars.
To convince residents that they
shouldn't look so innocently at
their personal chainsaws, the
Board showed that using a chain
saw with a two-stroke engine (less
efficient than the four-stroke en
gines used in cars and some lawn
equipment) for two hours gener
ates as many hydrocarbon emis
sions as driving a 1995 car for 2,500
miles.

It also reports that, per gallon,
lawnmowers pollute 93 times more
smog-forming emissions (e.g. NOx
and hydrocarbons) than a current
new car; for some engines, as much
as 25 percent of the exhaust is raw
fuel. Added up, all these emissions
comprise about 1 percent of Cali
fornia's total emissions, and 7 per
cent of its emissions from mobile
sources.
The manufacturers in Missouri
hoped to show that installing cat
alytic converters on small equip
ment posed a fire hazard. Howev
er, an Environmental Protection
Agency study released this March
stating that they posed no signifi
cant risk has likely put the last nail
in the coffin for these efforts.
And a recent report released by
the National Research Council

added insult to injury to Sen.
Bond, stating that "California
should continue its pioneering role
in setting mobile-source emissions
standards. The role will aid the
state's efforts to achieve air quali
ty goals and will allow it to contin
ue to be a proving ground for new
emissions-control technologies
that benefit California and the rest
of the nation."
Judge for yourself if you think
the benefits justify the costs, but
we in Palo Alto shouldn't be too
worried. After all. we're used to it
gas-powered leaf blowers are
already illegal here.
