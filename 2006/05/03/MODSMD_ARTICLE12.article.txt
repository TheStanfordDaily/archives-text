Wikocracy — where Wikipedia meets the law. Its goal, as de
scribed on its Web site, is "To see what happens wh«n every
one can write and revise the law. It may seem like a
all. But that's exactly the point — to make the process of law
making free for everyone."
Though the Web site has only been up for a month, the
main page has been accessed 6,000 times, and the entire body
of federal, state and local laws has been put up for grabs. Laws
and documents under discussion include the USA Patriot
Act, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Roe v. Wade and
the Constitution itself — to which 22 amendments have been
added. In addition to editing already-existing laws, bills.
Supreme Court decisions, et cetera, one can create new legis
lation — such as a law legalizing marijuana.
Since anyone is free to edit, revise or reverse any of the
items on the wiki, the Web site could conceivably head in two
different directi6ns. One possibility is that the site could re
flect a collaborative effort and consensus of what the laws
governing this country should be. On the other hand, the wiki
could turn into a constant battle between opposing political >
ideologies, resulting in constant reverses in laws and no / \

The site encourages revisions and highlights its lack
of guidelines, stating that, "This will be as bloody or as
civil as you make it...," followed by the ominous ,

words,"This is only a test."
Proceed now from the more serious Wikocracy
to a more trivial, but no less imaginative, topic.

Many of us, in our childhood days, spent much
time compulsively trading Pogs or Beanie Ba-

bies or Magic:The Gathering cards, in a (like

if this energy was put into a more adult.

This is the idea behind Kyle Mac
Donald's blog "One Red Paperclip."

A native Vancouverian, Mac Donald
has garnered national and interna-

tional media coverage, as well as a
couple of book offers, since he

launched his blog in June 2005
In an interview with the
Chris Pirillo Show, Mac-

Donald said that his idea
for the blog stemmed
from a childhood game ,

T
he used to play called "Bigger
and Better." At the time, he had

112 wanted to buy a house, but quickly
realized that he could not afford

Pone. He began brainstorming solu
tions, and while doing so remembered
playing this game. He looked down at

r\ his desk,saw one red paperclip, and in an
Archimedes-like Eureka moment
(though without the running-through-the-

streets-naked part), came up with a brilliant
idea.

P His objective is to start with that one red pa
perclip and progressively trade-up until he ob
tains a house. His first transaction — in which he
I-j l: l• r . „ii r* t

r traded his paperclip for an obscure wooden fishpen
-took about a month to complete. He has since
gone through 10 trades, encountering items like a

W.VVU...V.U.J,
carved doorknob, a generator, and an "instant party"
e complete with a keg stand and neon sign. More recently.

Fhe acquired a recording contract, which he traded for one
year of free rent in Phoenix, which he traded for his current
holding: an afternoon with rocker Alice Cooper.

As part of any transaction, Mac-
Donald is willing to fly anywhere to
meet the trader and complete the
exchange. He said that as his project
has evolved, he's become increas
ingly interested in the sociological
process of this project and the barter
system that it involves.
