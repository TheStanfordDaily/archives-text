# Wireless Internet gaining ground across nation
## 
### SAM BHAGWAT DESK EDITOR 
When household-name businesses like
Cisco Systems and IBM submit competing
bids to provide the city of San Francisco with
wireless Internet access, it is clear that being
plugged in is becoming a thing of the past.
When the winning venture — outfitted by
Earthlink and Google — offers to provide
free wireless to both the city and its residents,
maybe it's time to wonder at how soon the fu
ture will be here.
Along with San Francisco, major cities like
Toronto and Philadelphia are moving ahead
with plans to blanket their city in wireless.
These plans take two main avenues. Some
cities, such as St. Cloud. Fla., offer services
free, with either the city government or adver
tising revenues footing the bill. Others, like
Philadelphia, provide it at monthly or per-use
costs. And other cities, like San Francisco and

Toronto, plan to combine the two options.
Google and Earthlink, in addition to their free
service, plan to provide the Bay City with a
faster, higher-quality connection at $20 per
month. Toronto plans to offer free services for
six months before switching to a paid system.
Still, various concerns have arisen over
plans to build such wireless networks. There
are inevitable technical problems with large
scale projects: Philadelphia's wi-fi won't work
in many apartments and towers, and
Google/Earthlink will have to work to avoid
similar problems due to San Francisco's hills
and high-rises. Even in smaller towns like St.
Cloud, residents complain about spotty serv
ice, often sticking to their original Internet
provider.
But other, more serious concerns have
cropped up as well. In San Francisco, the
ACLU and two San Francisco-based groups
jointly requested that the city rethink its plans,
citing privacy concerns. They claim that the

service is "non-consensual" because if users
register and log in, Google could track them;
Google argues that the requirements are nec
essary to combat spammers. At present, the
debate's outcome is unclear.
And questions over wireless Internet are
not just at the local level, but in state legisla
tures as well. Verizon lobbied successfully the
Pennyslvania state legislature for a bill that
would prohibit city governments, excluding
Philadelphia's, from providing wireless Inter
net that would compete with landline
providers. Before the bill's passage. Philadel
phia Mayor John Street blasted Verizon,
pointing to increased availability of the Inter
net to poor Philadelphians provided by wire
less, and comparing the program to public util
ities. Verizon representative Eric Rabe replied
by arguing that the situation was "possibly ex
tremely unfair...the city is taxing us. to some
degree they are regulating us. and now they're
a competitor of ours."

But though these issues are playing them
selves out across the nation, locally the future
of wireless Internet seems promising. Service
provider MetroFi, for example, provides the
cities of Santa Clara and Cupertino with limit
ed free wireless services. And the scope of cur
rent coverage is dwarfed by proposed expan
sions. The San Francisco Chronicle reported
Saturday that a consortium made up of city
governments and private firms called for the
setup of wireless Internet access across 1500
square-miles in Santa Clara, San Mateo, Santa
Cruz and Alameda Counties.
This idea is still a proposal, and its future re
mains uncertain. Still, according to Denis
Miller, communications director for Sunny
vale-based wireless hotspot provider Anchor-
Free, signs are positive.
The trend of expanding wi-fi access "defi
nitely isn't slowing down," Hiller says. "Wi-fi
has a bright future, and it's spreading across
the Bay Area and world."
