## Editorial Research for the public 
### 
Stanford is home to some of the world's
best researchers, but few students know
about the projects faculty outside their
fields are working on. Given the bewildering
array of departments, programs and insti
tutes on campus, it is nearly impossible for
students to keep up with the current state of
research across departments.
We should not have to read the national
news to find out about the discoveries Stan
ford faculty members are making right here
on the Farm. If anything, we should find out
about it before the rest of the world.
One way to bridge this gap would be to
organize research forums on a monthly
basis. These seminars or colloquia would
provide opportunities for professors to pres
ent their research and recruit new assistants.
This event series could be introduced in a
number of ways. Professors could hold con
ventional lectures summarizing the main
points of their current research in one of the
large venues on campus such as Kresge or
Cubberley Auditoriums. Alternatively, they
qould present their work "in context" — in
their labs or offices with the database they
are analyzing at hand. Of course, this would
limit the number of students per faculty
presentation. But if a lot of professors partic
ipate in the program, many students would
still be able to benefit from it.
These lectures should not be organized
by academic field, such as social sciences,en
gineering, humanities and so forth. Indeed,
one of the goals of the proposed plan is to in
form students about research at Stanford in
general. Instead, lectures could be organized
by theme, with each series addressing a dif
ferent perspective on a current issue.
Another form the event could take would
be for the faculty lecture to be followed by a
dinner with the professor.The professor's re
search assistants should also be invited to

dinner so that they can sit in on the discus
sion and talk about their research interests
in greater detail. This would give more stu
dents the chance to learn about research op
portunities on campus.
In either case, the University would have
to design a fair process to select participating
students for each faculty presentation, per
haps on a first come-first serve basis or
through a lottery.
The key to turning this idea into a popu
lar and permanent event is to make it as
prestigious as possible for the involved fac
ulty. Stanford professors are busy, successful
people — they will not want to devote time
to presenting their research to students un
less they show great interest and the Univer
sity organizes the event well. Much like First
Thursdays at the Cantor Visual Arts Center,
there should be good food, and students
should be encouraged to dress up. Ilirning
the research forum into a sophisticated so
cial and intellectual event may increase its
appeal to both students and faculty.
The important thing is that this idea be
comes a reality soon. Stanford is one of the
leading research universities in the world, and
its student body should know about the most
important discoveries made by its faculty in all
fields. Just as Stanford promotes General Ed
ucation Requirements, it should also imple
ment something like the proposed research
forums, which would encourage students to
become interested in and informed about re
search in areas unrelated to their fields.
Once we leave Stanford, we may never
again have access to such breadth and quali
ty of information, so we should make the
most of it while we can. We should turn the
discoveries made at this University into a
source of school spirit and pride — they def
initely shouldn't be ignored by the people
who stand to benefit from it most.
