# Time for a new lead

### 
Does anyone else think it's interesting
that the third installment of the Mis
sion Impossible series is being re
leased right around the third anniversary of
Bush's dubious "Mission Accomplished" mis
judgment on Iraq? How about the similarities
between Bush and Cruise? Anyone?
A comparison of "The Decider" and"The
Scientologist" is almost too easy. A simple
juxtaposition of the two reveals that both are
delusional, out of touch with their base and
often present fictitious accounts of reality
that are, ultimately,mere publicity stunts used
to advance their image, career or beliefs in
stead of the truth — much less the interests of
their respective constituencies.
Publicity Stunts
For starters. Bush and Cruise have both
become known for their wild publicity tactics.
Bush used a giant sign to proclaim, "Mission
Accomplished" as the backdrop to his speech
on the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln on May 1,
2(X)3, while Cruise opted for a less formal ap
proach, jumping on Oprah's couch while
wildly proclaiming,"l'm in love!"
I think Oprah's assessment applies to both
situations: "The boy is GONE!"
Publicity Failures
Bush can't stand up to his critics any better
than Cruise can to Matt Lauer. Bush respond
ed to retired (albeit informed) generals calling
for the replacement of Defense Secretary
Donald Rumsfeld by reminding the world
that he is "the decider." Meanwhile, Cruise re
sponded to Lauer's questions by declaring,
"You don't know the history of psychiatry. I
do." And that psychiatry is a "pseudo science."
Both of these instances represent a failed
message presented by a failed messenger.
Bush ineffectively reduced his presidency to
that of a blind decision-maker, not a collabo
rator or even an expert. Conversely, Cruise in
effectively reduced his Hollywood status to
that of a medical expert, not an action star.
In effect, neither of them was convincing
in their new role and both instances exempli
fied disastrous publicity failures. I'm not con
vinced that President Bush can make deci
sions any more than I believe Tom Cruise
knows the complete history of psychiatry.
Both are better served to stay on script.
Don't Mess with Texas, or Heterosexuality
In addition, both are vindictive. How did
Bush respond to the criticism that his inva
sion of Iraq was based on incorrect and ma
nipulated intelligence? The Valerie Plame
scandal. How did Cruise respond to the criti
cism that his invasion of Hollywood's most
eligible (and least convincing) bachelorettes
was incorrect and manipulated for the bene
fit of his career? Instead of saying, "Look, I 'm
not gay, but thanks for the compliment!" he
sued the tabloids. In fact, Cruise has repeated
ly reminded us that he is straight, claiming in
his own words that women "smell good. They
look pretty. I love women. I do."
My mom is pretty, smells good and I love
her, too. But that doesn't make me straight,
Tom. Ihe message is clear: don't mess with
these guys or criticize their delusions — and
if you do. be willing to pay the price.

Silent Spouses
Just kidding. I won't compare Laura and
Katie (excuse me, Kate) in this column.That's
a topic for another day.
War of the Worlds
Religion has had a decisive and divisive
role in both cases. Fundamentalism, be it
Christian, Muslim or Scientologist, has
reached the point of extremes.
In America. Bush has used religion as a
political tool to appeal to the values of his
Christian base. If he had integrity in his ap
proach. I might not criticize him for it. How
ever, Bush has used religion to divert public
resources into private paybacks in ways that
fraudulently benefit his most inner circle, not
America's voters, much less its Christians. His
resistance to stem cell research, the Terri Schi
avo fiasco and court appointments indicate
that he doesn't appropriately understand the
role that his faith has in his decisions. Instead,
he uses religion as a political wedge to ad
vance his agenda, with kickbacks to his tragi
cally uninformed cronies. Is it a coincidence
that Harriet Meiers was sold as a graceful
Christian instead of an informed legal schol
ar? I don't think so.
Abroad, Bush has taken religious extrem
ism and mixed it with oil, forgetting that only
a spark is needed to set off an explosion. Ihe
Arab world hates America much more than
they did before Bush took office. His solo
style has isolated America in the world com
munity and, quite unfortunately, sparked
fundamentalist religious crusades across the
world leading to death, war and famine in
stead of life, peace and prosperity. Honestly, I
blame him alone for America's sinking posi
tion, and I don't appreciate his alignment of
Christian steadfastness with stubborn self
ishness.
Cruise, on the other hand, only alienates
his fans by evangelically preaching from his
Scientologist pulpit. Many Hollywood celebs
have religious beliefs. However, the way that
he attacked Brooke Shields for using antide
pressants was not sensitive, not caring, but
very "religious." I lis cut-and-dry approach to
Scientology is fine so long as he keeps it to
himself. While his religious views might not
impact the success of his movies, they increas
ingly paint Cruise as "crazy" instead of faith
ful. Scientologists will be better served to get
a new spokesman and Hollywood would be
better served to find a sane leading player.
Bush is out of touch with the American
people and Cruise is out of touch with his
fans. In my opinion, it's time America got
some new leading actors.
