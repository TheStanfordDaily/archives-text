# Chester A.Arthur remembered
## 
### 
Most presidents of the United States
will never be in danger of being for
gotten. If you can't name the great
deeds of Abe Lincoln or Franklin Roosevelt,
then you're simply un-American. But some
great men from our country's past are not so
lucky — in fact, there are some presidents
who have been entirely swept into oblivion,
existing as little more than a footnote in histo
ry books. However, there is one such charis
matic figure of yore who deserves much better
than what history' has dealt him: our 21st pres
ident, Chester Alan Arthur.
My first contact with Chester A. Arthur, or
"Chet" as he was known to friends, came
about five years ago when I read a blurb about
him in a trivia book. Sure, I had heard the
name, but I knew nothing about the life or
times of this Gilded Age leader. I did a little re
search and liked what I found; I bought two
Chet biographies (i.e.. pretty much the only
two written), and he became my hero. Ever
since, it has been a personal goal of mine to
raise Chet out of the dustbin of history so that
he may be remembered as he should be. That,
and I kind of like having such a unique and lit
tle-known idol.
So what did Chet do? In history books you
may read about the two or three mildly no
table congressional acts that were passed dur
ing his three years in office. Three years, of
course, because he became president only
after James Garfield was assassinated. Chet
had been nominated to the vice-presidency in
1880 as part of a political game to appease Re
publican faction leaders. Despite some heroic
Civil War service, Chet was already associated
with some scandal from when he had been

fired under false suspicion of corruption from
a cushy job by the newly elected President
Hayes. Chet's greatest talents were his charis
ma and political networking skills, but every
political position he had held had been ap
pointed, so many voters were hesitant about
voting for the Republican ticket. However, a
popular newspaper published an editorial ar
guing that Garfield was a healthy man who
posed no risk of dying and therefore giving
Chet the presidency. Ah, the irony.
When Garfield was shot by a half-crazed,
disgruntled office-seeker — who hoped that
his acquaintance Chet, if president, would
award him the job he desired — Chet was
horror-struck. He lay low for the 11 weeks
that it took Garfield to die, and then was
sworn in on September 20,1881. Upon hear
ing the news, a Republican friend of Chet is
said to have exclaimed, "Chet Arthur? Presi
dent of the United States? Good God!"
Although he had once been closely associ
ated with abusers of the spoils system, once
Chet was in the White House he cut ties with
his old cronies and ran a remarkably re
spectable administration
Chet spent his days as president busy with
his social affairs. He had a near obsession with

fishing, and would at times close down the
White House so he could fish. He threw elab
orate parties regularly, and spent much of his
time off with his drinking buddies. Chet was
also nicknamed "Elegant Arthur" and"The
Gentleman Boss" for his good looks (mutton
chops were all the rage, after all) and stylish
gentility. Chet was also said to have owned
over 80 suits — which he liked to change mul
tiple times per day. Chet brought his own per
sonal touches to the White House, including
hiring a French gourmet chef and spending
$30,(XX) to completely redecorate and refur
nish the official residence.
Chet refrained from actively seeking the
Republican nomination in 1884 because he
was in ill health, and he died surrounded by his
family in 1886. Although Chet may be tragical
ly forgotten today, when he left office he was
highly respected for the integrity of his admin
istration. Mark Ttoain commented, "It would
be hard indeed to better President Arthur's
administration."
My AP U.S. History teacher and I had an
ongoing dispute about Chet's greatness. When
I went in during lunch one day to hand him a
biography I had written about my beloved
hero, my teacher commented."Oh good, 1 can
sit here and eat my greasy hamburger and
fries as I read your paper. How appropriate."
No, Chet Arthur may not be the usual stuff
of overzealous history books or patriotic trib
utes. But our 21st president deserves to be re
membered. In all of his 80-suited glory.
