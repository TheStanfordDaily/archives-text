American citizenship is not
a human right
In their op-ed ("Rethinking immigrant
rights," May 1), Cynthia Liao and Mark Liu
get it right when they recognize that "by enter
ing the United States without proper docu
mentation these immigrants did break the
law." They get it wrong, however, when they
try to argue that breaking the law is not "ille
gal" and that criminalizing the invasion of
America is "unjust."They go even further, ar
guing that illegals "must be afforded the same
rights as other U.S. citizens" on the basis that
immigration laws "strip them of their rights as
human beings."
American citizenship is not a human right,
but a privilege that many families wait
decades for.They seem to forget that NAFTA
was not a unilaterally imposed trade agree
ment, but one that was hammered out over
years between several governments. Yet, even
if NAFTA truly is a bad trade agreement, it
seems that the first step would be to pressure
the Mexican government to make better eco
nomic policies. Instead, Liao and Liu argue
that America is responsible for Mexico's econ
omy and that Congress ought to de-empha
size America's economic well-being in its de
cision making.

Furthermore, in favoring illegal immigra
tion, they ignore the broader vision of Ameri
ca as a melting pot. Indeed, America is a na
tion of immigrants. Yet 75 percent of the 1.5
million illegal immigrants that come to Amer
ica are from Mexico. They apparently ignore
the reality that America exists as a beacon of
hope not only to Mexico, but to much of the
world.
1 agree with the op-ed that the large-scale
poor and uneducated migration from Mexico
truly does create an underclass of individuals
who do not assimilate into American society.
Taking Liao and Liu's own argument a step
further, it seems America ought to adopt a
comprehensive immigration reform which
does not heavily favor a relatively monolithic
block of immigrants from Mexico. Granting
citizenship to illegal immigrants would be un
fair to the thousands of well-qualified aspiring
citizens waiting in line in other parts of the
world.

Pro-immigrant stance is hypocritical
In their op-ed ("Rethinking immigrant
rights," May 1), Cynthia Liao and Mark Liu
advocate a reassessment of hostile perspec

tives toward illegal immigrants, arguing that
HR 4437 and current border control measures
insufficiently view immigrants as humans en
titled to full rights. Good legislation, they
argue, would identify the problems endemic
to developing Latin American nations and
thereby reduce the demand for illegal entry by
improving international working conditions.
What is interesting about this argument, as
well as the prevailing pro-immigrant stance, is
that it does not address the fairness of immi
gration laws themselves. Iliis is where Liao's
and Liu's position becomes incoherent. It is
certainly reasonable that a government con
cerned about its citizens should know who is
living in the nation, and to a large degree,con
trol entry. Completely open borders would
destabilize our nation's ability to protect its
citizens and preserve domestic stability. The
ever-present threat of terrorism is an even
more important reason to sustain adequate
border control. Perhaps I am ignorant in this
respect, but I do not believe that advocates of
these alleged "immigrant rights" would as vo
ciferously support more permeable borders.
The hypocrisy lies in the fact that, while it is
hardly controversial that the government
must actively monitor and control entry, indi-
viduals who somehow avoid these
controls deserve the same status as
American citizens. Liao and Liu
argue that illegal immigrants "must
be afforded the same rights as other
US. citizens, so they will not continue
to be exploited by horrid working
conditions — conditions only creat
ed by their need to hide in fear." This
is a fairly absurd proposition. Essen
tially, this proposal would exempt
people from the law precisely when
they are successful at breaking it. If
our politicians listened to these pro
testers, they would be fatally under
mining the efficacy of any sort of bor
der control.'lTie only deterrent would
be the natural hardships endemic to
"crossing the border" stealthily. But
successfully overcoming this hard
ship does not entitle a person to
American citizenship. Rather, it enti
tles them to a fair trial under the crim
inal justice system and the likelihood
of deportation. The United States
provides ways of entering the nation
legally; affirming the pro-immigrant
protesters weakens the government's
ability to provide security.

Liao and Liu suggest that we need
to consider the economic context of
the decision to immigrate, implicitly
arguing that the United States is par
tially responsible for their condition
and therefore owes them the full
rights of American citizens. It should
be fairly obvious that any policy that
does this to a significant degree will
have the inevitable effect of relaxing
immigration restrictions and opening
up American borders substantially.
The consequences of this will in
evitably lead to decreased security
and a reduction in the government's
capacity to monitor border activity.
If Liao and Liu are so concerned
about the welfare of these people,
then they should strongly advocate
that anyone who comes from Latin
America should be granted immedi
ate full citizenship into the United
States. This would grant them the
rights to which these people are sup
posedly entitled while eliminating
the ability of the government to en
force any kind of control over entry.
This would be an untenable, if inter
esting, argument. But unless they
take their message to this extreme,
however, the nationwide protests
will remain rife with inconsistency
and incoherence.

testers, they would be fatally under
mining the efficacy of any sort of bor
der control.'lTie only deterrent would
be the natural hardships endemic to
"crossing the border" stealthily. But
successfully overcoming this hard
ship does not entitle a person to
American citizenship. Rather, it enti
tles them to a fair trial under the crim
inal justice system and the likelihood
of deportation. The United States
provides ways of entering the nation
legally; affirming the pro-immigrant
protesters weakens the government's
ability to provide security.

Liao and Liu suggest that we need
to consider the economic context of
the decision to immigrate, implicitly
arguing that the United States is par
tially responsible for their condition
and therefore owes them the full
rights of American citizens. It should
be fairly obvious that any policy that
does this to a significant degree will
have the inevitable effect of relaxing
immigration restrictions and opening
up American borders substantially.
The consequences of this will in
evitably lead to decreased security
and a reduction in the government's
capacity to monitor border activity.
If Liao and Liu are so concerned
about the welfare of these people,
then they should strongly advocate
that anyone who comes from Latin
America should be granted immedi
ate full citizenship into the United
States. This would grant them the
rights to which these people are sup
posedly entitled while eliminating
the ability of the government to en
force any kind of control over entry.
This would be an untenable, if inter
esting, argument. But unless they
take their message to this extreme,
however, the nationwide protests
will remain rife with inconsistency
and incoherence.
