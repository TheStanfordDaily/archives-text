American citizenship is not
a human right
In their op-ed ("Rethinking immigrant
rights," May 1), Cynthia Liao and Mark Liu
get it right when they recognize that "by enter
ing the United States without proper docu
mentation these immigrants did break the
law." They get it wrong, however, when they
try to argue that breaking the law is not "ille
gal" and that criminalizing the invasion of
America is "unjust."They go even further, ar
guing that illegals "must be afforded the same
rights as other U.S. citizens" on the basis that
immigration laws "strip them of their rights as
human beings."
American citizenship is not a human right,
but a privilege that many families wait
decades for.They seem to forget that NAFTA
was not a unilaterally imposed trade agree
ment, but one that was hammered out over
years between several governments. Yet, even
if NAFTA truly is a bad trade agreement, it
seems that the first step would be to pressure
the Mexican government to make better eco
nomic policies. Instead, Liao and Liu argue
that America is responsible for Mexico's econ
omy and that Congress ought to de-empha
size America's economic well-being in its de
cision making.

Furthermore, in favoring illegal immigra
tion, they ignore the broader vision of Ameri
ca as a melting pot. Indeed, America is a na
tion of immigrants. Yet 75 percent of the 1.5
million illegal immigrants that come to Amer
ica are from Mexico. They apparently ignore
the reality that America exists as a beacon of
hope not only to Mexico, but to much of the
world.
1 agree with the op-ed that the large-scale
poor and uneducated migration from Mexico
truly does create an underclass of individuals
who do not assimilate into American society.
Taking Liao and Liu's own argument a step
further, it seems America ought to adopt a
comprehensive immigration reform which
does not heavily favor a relatively monolithic
block of immigrants from Mexico. Granting
citizenship to illegal immigrants would be un
fair to the thousands of well-qualified aspiring
citizens waiting in line in other parts of the
world.

Pro-immigrant stance is hypocritical
In their op-ed ("Rethinking immigrant
rights," May 1), Cynthia Liao and Mark Liu
advocate a reassessment of hostile perspec

tives toward illegal immigrants, arguing that
HR 4437 and current border control measures
insufficiently view immigrants as humans en
titled to full rights. Good legislation, they
argue, would identify the problems endemic
to developing Latin American nations and
thereby reduce the demand for illegal entry by
improving international working conditions.
What is interesting about this argument, as
well as the prevailing pro-immigrant stance, is
that it does not address the fairness of immi
gration laws themselves. Iliis is where Liao's
and Liu's position becomes incoherent. It is
certainly reasonable that a government con
cerned about its citizens should know who is
living in the nation, and to a large degree,con
trol entry. Completely open borders would
destabilize our nation's ability to protect its
citizens and preserve domestic stability. The
ever-present threat of terrorism is an even
more important reason to sustain adequate
border control. Perhaps I am ignorant in this
respect, but I do not believe that advocates of
these alleged "immigrant rights" would as vo
ciferously support more permeable borders.
The hypocrisy lies in the fact that, while it is
hardly controversial that the government
must actively monitor and control entry, indi-
