# The
						Sopranos meet Michael Jordan
## 
### 
Last week I used this space to
rip on the NBA Playoffs. De
spite some exciting games
over the first week, 1 stand by every
thing 1 expressed. But one place
where I have to give the NBA some
serious props is the Draft.
After watching the NFL Draft
this past weekend, I have a new
found respect for the NBA version.
In fact. I have a newfound respect
for watching grass grow.
Of course, when I say watched
the draft I mean the first hour —
which I'm pretty sure is the maxi
mum anyone could watch of the
proceedings unless you were draft
ing or getting drafted. Watching
Chris Berman and Mel Kiper wax
poetic for the fifteen minutes be
tween picks is enough to drive even
the most diehard of fans away
So after the first six picks, just
enough to watch the Niners pick
Vernon Davis, I turned off the draft
and instead caught up on the sixth
season of the Sopranos in anticipa
tion for the new episode Sunday
night.
I'm convinced there are few bet
ter ways to spend some free time
than a Sopranos marathon. Hie
drama, the intrigue, watching some
one get whacked every once and a
while — it captivates like no other
show on the air.
But many of the qualities that
make the Sopranos so great are the
same ones that make sports so much
fun to watch.
For instance, in the Sopranos
there is a feud between Tony and his
uncle Junior after a senile Junior
shoots I'ony and then forgets the in
cident.
In sports you have the same
thing, just the other way around.
Jose Canseco shot his friend Mark
McGwire — with steroids, that is —
and it is McGwire that seems to
have the memory loss.
Much like the Sopranos there is
betrayal in sports. In one case Big
Pussy rats out Tony to the FBI. In
the other. Johnny Damon abandons
his crew (the Red Sox) for the
enemy (the Yankees). Hopefully for
Johnny, the end result won't be the
same.
Every story line, every conflict
and every character that makes the
Sopranos so great has a parallel in
sports. Tony Soprano — Michael
Jordan. Silvio Dante, meet Billy
Beane. 'ITie comparisons are end
less.
I think that the fact that sports
can be so readily compared to the
Sopranos is the reason why sports
are so awesome. They both provide
an entire cast of characters all
caught up in their own drama, but,
at the same time, captured for the
entire audience to see.
Watching Sports Center these
days is like watching a soap opera.
Corruption, crime, sex — all fea
