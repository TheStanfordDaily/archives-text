# ASSU SENATE
## Avula tapped for chair Heng airs strategies to soothe distribution woes 
### MICHAEL TAMKIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Seventh ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate met last night to discuss
changes to publication distribution
policy, ease the transfer of power to
recently elected ASSU leaders and
approve funding bills for various stu
dent groups. The newly elected
Eighth Undergraduate Senate, slated
to take power on May 16, elected in
cumbent Senator Hershey Avula, a
sophomore, as the future Chair of the
Eighth Senate.
The meeting opened with a com
ment from ASSU Financial Manager
Justin Fishner-Wolfson concerning
the ASSU's 2007 fiscal year budget.
According to Fishner-Wolfson, the
budget increased from $194,000 this
year to $214,000 as a result of a larger
endowment payout.
"This larger payout is based on a
larger endowment, which is a function
of business and investment returns,"
he said.
The Senate passed this budget
pending action by the Graduate Stu
dent Council (GSC).
Newly elected ASSU President
Elizabeth Heng, a junior, updated the
Senate on the Executive Committee's
progress.
"[Vice President Lauren Graham,
a junior] and 1 have spoken to the ad-
ministration and the ASSU publica
tions director to help implement a
standard democratic process for
door-to-door distribution," Heng
said. "Next year, each residence will
have an online balloting system that
will give them four options: door-to
door distribution, no door-to-door
distribution, distribution in the resi
dent mailboxes (to be installed over
the summer), and door-to-door distri
bution with distribution in mailbox
es."
In an email to The Daily, Heng also
described efforts to reform the Ab
solute Fun program and also make
"Dead Week dead."
"Instead of having Absolute Fun
as a separate programming group that
plans major events, we want to use
Absolute Fun as a way to obtain fund
ing for large scale events such as Full
Moon on the Quad, Mausoleum
Party, the Movie Express, Stanford
Idol and Erotic Hypnotist," Heng
wrote. "We want to institutionalize
these events with different student
groups and leaders on campus so that
there is a designated group who over
sees that these traditions carry on
each year."
Concerning the future of Dead
Week. Heng wrote, "We've identified
key faculty members that we have
and will be approaching to push for
this agenda. We are currently drafting
a proposal and will present it to the
Faculty Senate."
The Senate then approved a Publi
cations Funding Bill for Prism-Book
& Art Review to publish an issue
completed during winter quarter and
also an issue to be completed this
spring.
The recently-elected Eighth Un
dergraduate Senate chose by secret
ballot Avula to be chair, effective
May 16.
Avula, a sophomore and member

of the Appropriations and Campus
Advocacy Committees, described his
goals for his term as Senate Chair.
"I would like our primary goal to
be expanding our communication,"
Avula said. "Last year we had excel
lent communication with the GSC
and the Executive Committee, and I
would like to communicate effective
ly with other groups and be person
able with other groups."
Avula also outlined his personal
goals as senate chair.
"Having another year on the Sen
ate will be a whole new learning expe
rience for me," he said, "because this
year I learned the administrative
skills, for example learning how to
write bills, and next year I hope to de
velop the personal skills and relation
ships to help other Senators and stu
dent groups succeed."
One idea Avula proposed is a mo
bile Senate, which would "periodical
ly move the Senate location to resi
dences and dining halls across campus

to reach students who aren't the usual
audience for our meetings.
"This would improve the commu
nication with the student body which
would be great because I want more
students to know what the ASSU
does," he added.
In the meeting's funding bills, the
Senate approved budget modifica
tion for Muslim Student Awareness
Network, the Pilipino American Stu
dent Union, Stanford Cardinal
Broadcasting Network, Stanford
Alpine Ski Team, Stanford Cycling
Team, Student Initiated Courses,
Club Sports, Stanford Capoeira, Vol
unteers in Latin America, Stanford
Martial Arts Program, ASSU Speak
ers Bureau (pending GSC vote) and
the Stanford Band.
The legislative body also approved
reserve transfer bills to support the
Stanford Organizing Committee for
the Arts, the Muslim Student Aware
ness Network and the ASSU Concert
Network.
