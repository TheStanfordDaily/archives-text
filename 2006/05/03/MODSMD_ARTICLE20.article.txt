It's been an up-and-down type of sea
son for the Stanford bullpen, which has
produced performances ranging from
brilliant to hapless.
I"he Cardinal's last two games have
provided a perfect illustration of this
fact. On Monday, three Stanford reliev
ers failed to get a single out in the sev
enth inning, allowing rival California to
come back from a two run deficit to
claim a 4-3 victory.
Yesterday, however, it was an entirely
different story for the Cardinal relief
corps. Following starter Jeremy Bleich's
early departure after just three innings,
the outcome of the Cardinal's match up
against San Jose State was in the hands of
the Stanford bullpen.
But despite being given the unenvi
able assignment of closing out the game
with six innings of relief, junior left
hander Blake Holler and freshman
hurlers Austin Yount and Sean Ratliff

came through in the clutch. The trio
teamed up to limit the visiting Spartans
to just one run on two hits for the re
mainder of the contest, and the Stanford
hats finally came alive in the eighth in
ning to secure a 6-2 victory for the Cardi
nal.
Stanford (20-20,5-10 Pac-10) entered
their match up against San Jose State
(30-18, 9-6 WAC) looking to rebound
from their Monday afternoon loss to the
Bears. Hie Cardinal were only able to
scrape out three runs on nine hits against
California's pitchers. And in the early
going against the Spartans, it seemed
that the Cardinal offense was headed for
an equally frustrating day at the plate.
In the first three innings, San Jose
State's hurlers faced the minimum num
ber of hitters. Stanford second baseman
Chris Lewis singled through the left side
in the third but was erased when fresh
man Brent Milleville grounded into an
inning-ending double play.

extended his hitting streak to nine
games. But the Spartans rallied for a
run in the fifth to retake a one-run
lead.
In the sixth, Stanford took advan
tage of an error by San Jose State left
fielder Chris Williammee by manu
facturing a run that tied the score.
Milleville reached second via
Williammee's error before moving to
third on a sacrifice bunt by designat
ed hitter Joey August. Junior Jim

Rapoport then brought Milleville in
with the tying run with a sacrifice fly
to center.
Meanwhile, the Stanford pitch
ing was effectively dominating the
Spartan lineup. Holler worked two
innings, giving up just one run on
one hit while striking out two. Yount
then came on to throw 1.1 near
flawless innings, retiring four of the
five batters he faced. Ratliff, a
southpaw, slammed the door on San
Jose State, pitching the final 2.2 in
nings and surrendering no runs and
just one hit.
The successful set of performanc
es out of the bullpen was critical, since
the Cardinal only got around to put
ting together their game-winning

four-run rally in the eighth.
Seawell started the rally with a sin
gle and crossed the plate with the de
ciding run on a Milleville RBI single.
The Stanford hit parade continued,
culminating with Minaker's two RBI
single up the middle that gave the
Cardinal a comfortable four-run in
surance margin.
The Spartans went quietly in their
half of the ninth, and Ratliff picked
up the win to improve to 2-0 on the
year.
