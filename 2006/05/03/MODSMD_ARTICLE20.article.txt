It's been an up-and-down type of sea
son for the Stanford bullpen, which has
produced performances ranging from
brilliant to hapless.
I"he Cardinal's last two games have
provided a perfect illustration of this
fact. On Monday, three Stanford reliev
ers failed to get a single out in the sev
enth inning, allowing rival California to
come back from a two run deficit to
claim a 4-3 victory.
Yesterday, however, it was an entirely
different story for the Cardinal relief
corps. Following starter Jeremy Bleich's
early departure after just three innings,
the outcome of the Cardinal's match up
against San Jose State was in the hands of
the Stanford bullpen.
But despite being given the unenvi
able assignment of closing out the game
with six innings of relief, junior left
hander Blake Holler and freshman
hurlers Austin Yount and Sean Ratliff

came through in the clutch. The trio
teamed up to limit the visiting Spartans
to just one run on two hits for the re
mainder of the contest, and the Stanford
hats finally came alive in the eighth in
ning to secure a 6-2 victory for the Cardi

Stanford (20-20,5-10 Pac-10) entered
their match up against San Jose State
(30-18, 9-6 WAC) looking to rebound
from their Monday afternoon loss to the
Bears. Hie Cardinal were only able to
scrape out three runs on nine hits against
California's pitchers. And in the early
going against the Spartans, it seemed
that the Cardinal offense was headed for
an equally frustrating day at the plate.
In the first three innings, San Jose
State's hurlers faced the minimum num
ber of hitters. Stanford second baseman
Chris Lewis singled through the left side
in the third but was erased when fresh
man Brent Milleville grounded into an
inning-ending double play.
Senior shortstop Chris Minaker final

bottom half of the fourth, belting a solo
homer to left. The blast increased his
