# ONE STEP CLOSER
## Women's water polo take MPSF title, NCAAs next 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
One down, one to go.
That might be the mantra embraced
by the members of the women's water
polo team over the course of the next two
weeks.
On Sunday, the Cardinal (22-4) post
ed a resounding 6-3 victory over the
Rainbow Wahine of Hawaii in the cham
pionship game of the MPSF conference
tournament. With the win, the Stanford
women claimed the MPSF title for the
first time since 2003. But more impor
tantly, they earned an automatic bid to
the upcoming NCAA Championships —
proving to everyone that they will be a
force to be reckoned with two weekends
from now when the top teams in the na
tion compete for the NCAA title at UC-
Davis from May 12-14.
Hitting the road last Wednesday for
their last swing through SoCal this sea
son. the Cardinal knew that the UC-
Irvine-hosted MPSF tournament would
provide a good gauge of their team's

progress thus far. Although they knew
that their performance at the tourna
ment likely wouldn't affect their chances
of being invited to NCAAs, the Stanford
women embraced the opportunity to
show their mettle nevertheless.
"This is a dress rehearsal to see if we
can play our game under pressure and
against very strong, physical teams," jun
ior driver Katie Hansen said prior to the
weekend. "Winning would be great to
boost our confidence and show everyone
what we're capable of doing. We really
have nothing to lose."
As the No. 3 seed in the tournament,
the Cardinal received a first round bye
on Thursday. On Friday, they opened
their weekend by defeating the host
Anteaters 10-4 in convincing fashion. Se
nior driver Scotti Shafer and freshman
driver Lolo Silver teamed up to make
sure there would be no drama in the
game. Each contributed four goals on the
day to pace the Stanford offense as the
Cardinal rolled into the tournament
semifinals.
Not surprisingly, the Stanford women

found themselves slated to take on de
fending NCAA champion UCLA on
Saturday afternoon. The Bruins had en
tered MPSFs seeded second, due largely
in part to their 9-8 overtime victory over
the Cardinal on April 15.
But the Cardinal proved up to the
challenge, battling their way to a thrilling
5-4 upset of their perennial rivals.
UCLA drew first blood with a score at
3:45 in the first period, but Stanford came
roaring back with two goals and stifling
defense to take a 2-1 lead into the half.
The Cardinal stretched the margin into a
3-1 cushion midway through the third pe
riod, but the Bruins responded with a
pair of goals in quick succession to close
the gap and send the game into the final
period all tied up.
With the outcome of the game up for
grabs, the Stanford women produced two
goals to rebuild their lead with under
four minutes to play. UCLA managed to
narrow their deficit to one by finding the
back of the net with 1:50 to play.
But that was as close as they
would get as Stanford junior goalie
Meridith McColl and the Cardinal
defense shut down the Bruin attack
in the closing seconds of the match to
preserve the victory. Hansen was the
offensive star of the game for Stan
ford, stepping up with a hat trick that
propelled her squad to the upset.
But the biggest surprise of the
year came shortly afterwards when
the No. 4 seeded Rainbow Wahine
stunned undefeated No. 1 seed
Southern California in the second
semifinal match to earn a spot in the
conference title game. Despite en
tering the contest having lost 18 con
secutive games to the Women of
Troy, Hawaii took an early lead and
never looked back en route to taking
the shocking 10-9 win.
But despite falling behind early,
the Cardinal made sure that the
Rainbow Wahine did not repeat
their feat.
Trailing 2-0 midway through the
first period. Hansen, Silver, junior
two-meter defender Alison Greeor

ka and junior two-meter Christina
Hewko all tallied scores to put Stan
ford ahead, a lead that would not he
challenged for the rest of the game.
Hawaii was unable to convert a sin
gle scoring opportunity in the sec
ond half, as the Cardinal backcourt
exhibited its usual high level of play.
McColl recorded seven saves to fin
ish the weekend with 21 in three
games.
But as satisfying as it was to bring
the MPSF title back to the Farm, the
Cardinal have now set their sights on
an even bigger prize — the NCAA
title. And as far as they've come, they
know that there still remains much
work to be done in order to achieve
that goal.
"Taking the conference title was a
thrilling way to end my MPSF con
ference career," said senior defender
Laurel Champion. "We are still not
number one however, going into
NCAAs.so mentally we are not fully
satisfied — that is something that
will motivate us these next two
weeks heading into NCA As."
"We are continually getting bet
ter and getting closer as a team
which is great," Hewko said. "But to
win NCAAs we are still going to
have to step it up a notch and dig a
little deeper."
