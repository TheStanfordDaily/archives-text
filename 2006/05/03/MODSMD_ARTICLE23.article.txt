## Homerun lifts Card over SJS 
### ANDREW LOMELI STAFF WRITER 
Given the team's difficult Pac-10 Conference
schedule, the No. 8 Stanford softball team will
take any win it can muster â€” even if it means
holding their breath until the game's final at-bat.
After trailing through six innings, the Cardi
nal (35-12,7-8 Pac-10) collected a run off the bat
of junior outfielder Jackie Rinehart to tie San
Jose State, 3-3, in the seventh to force extra in
nings. In the eighth inning, sophomore outfielder
Anna Beardman knocked in the go-ahead run
with a single to left field to deal the Spartans (22-
23, 10-4 Western Athletic Conference) the 4-3
loss.
"When you get up in those situations, the
main thing is to just keep things the same and
take it one at-bat at a time," Beardman said. "We
have confidence in whoever is in that situation.
While we're focused on getting the bats going
right away, we've had some trouble doing that.
But the great thing about our team is that we stay
positive when we're in trouble, and that's crucial
in this sport."
San Jose State held the lead for most of the
evening. The Spartans cashed in a hit and a walk
early, as Jessica Guillen notched a three-run
homer to establish San Jose's 3-0 advantage in
the first. The Spartans posted another major
threat in the fourth with runners on first and sec
ond. but freshman Missy Penna struck out Char
lie Hill to end the inning.
Stanford earned a golden opportunity in the
fifth, placing runners on first and second. With
two outs. Beardman struck out to end the threat.
One inning later, Stanford would receive a
similar chance and seize it. Senior outfielder
Catalina Morris reached first on a bunt to start
the sixth inning. A Rinehart single would ad
vance Morris before freshman Maddy Coon
knocked a single of her own to third, catching
Morris out. With two outs and runners on first
and second.sophomore Michelle Smith smacked
a two-run double to deep centerfield to bring the
Cardinal within one, 3-2. Sophomore Erin Howe
died out to left in the next at-bat, ending the in
ning.
After an uneventful top of the seventh, the
bottom of the inning began with a walk to junior
Lindsey Key. Sophomore Tricia Aggabao collect
ed a double to left field, advancing Key to third
with no outs.The Spartans entered reliever Kelly
Harrison, who forced Beardman to fly out to
shallow left before intentionally walking Morris.
Rinehart then stepped up to notch the game
tying RBI.
Aggabao went 3-4 for the evening while Rine
hart was 2-4 with one RBI. Missy Penna hurled
eight innings, tallying eight strikeouts while sur
rendering three hits and three runs. Courtney
