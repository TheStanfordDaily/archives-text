## Bowlsby ready for those tough calls 
### CHRISTOPHER ANDERSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Whatever qualities Stanford's new
Athletic Director Boh Bowlsby brings
from his 15-year tenure at the University
of lowa, it cannot be said he is unaccus
tomed to pressure or that he shies away
from making tough calls.
Indeed, in recent years, Bowlsby has
had to make difficult leadership deci
sions for two of lowa's most successful
and widely-followed sports — football
and wrestling. Both times, Bowlsby's dar
ingness and willingness to fly in the face

of convention proved sagacious.
At lowa, Bowlsby's signature hire
came when he was called upon to replace
football coach Hayden Fry. One of the
best coaches of the modern era. Fry built
lowa from a doormat into a powerhouse,
taking the Hawkeyes to fourteen bowl
games in 20 years (including three Rose
Bowls).
But suffering from prostrate cancer
and coming off a 3-8 season in 1998, Fry
elected to hang it up, and Bowlsby
brought former lowa assistant Kirk Fer
entz back into the program.
At the time though, many fans felt

Bowlsby made the wrong call and should
have hired the sexier pick — lowa alum
Bob Stoops. The catcalls only grew loud
er after Stoops won a national title at Ok
lahoma in 2000 and lowa went an
abysmal 4-19 in Ferentz's first two sea
sons. But Bowlsby stayed the course.
A 7-6 campaign in 2001 did little to
quell the lowa fan base, but the program
was clearly improving in talent and game
preparation. And, finally, Bowlsby's loy
alty and sharp eye were vindicated when
the Hawkeyes ripped off a three-year
