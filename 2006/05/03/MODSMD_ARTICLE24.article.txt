## Bowlsby ready for those tough calls 
### CHRISTOPHER ANDERSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Whatever qualities Stanford's new
Athletic Director Boh Bowlsby brings
from his 15-year tenure at the University
of lowa, it cannot be said he is unaccus
tomed to pressure or that he shies away
from making tough calls.
Indeed, in recent years, Bowlsby has
had to make difficult leadership deci
sions for two of lowa's most successful
and widely-followed sports — football
and wrestling. Both times, Bowlsby's dar
ingness and willingness to fly in the face

of convention proved sagacious.
At lowa, Bowlsby's signature hire
came when he was called upon to replace
football coach Hayden Fry. One of the
best coaches of the modern era. Fry built
lowa from a doormat into a powerhouse,
taking the Hawkeyes to fourteen bowl
games in 20 years (including three Rose
Bowls).
But suffering from prostrate cancer
and coming off a 3-8 season in 1998, Fry
elected to hang it up, and Bowlsby
brought former lowa assistant Kirk Fer
entz back into the program.
At the time though, many fans felt

Bowlsby made the wrong call and should
have hired the sexier pick — lowa alum
Bob Stoops. The catcalls only grew loud
er after Stoops won a national title at Ok
lahoma in 2000 and lowa went an
abysmal 4-19 in Ferentz's first two sea
sons. But Bowlsby stayed the course.
A 7-6 campaign in 2001 did little to
quell the lowa fan base, but the program
was clearly improving in talent and game
preparation. And, finally, Bowlsby's loy
alty and sharp eye were vindicated when
the Hawkeyes ripped off a three-year

record of 31-7 from 2002 to 2004, claiming two
Big Ten titles in the run. In 2002, lowa had a
Heisman Trophy runner-up in quarterback
Brad Banks and Ferentz was named AP Na
tional Coach of the Year.
In a nod to Bowlsby's leadership, Ferentz
continues to turn down overtures from the NFL
to stay in lowa City. lowa has also renovated
Kinnick Stadium under Bowlsby's watch, keep
ing the Hawkeye state a viable player in the
ultra-competitive Big Ten.
Largely because of Ferentz, football is
lowa's most visible sport on the national level.
But in the Midwest, lowa wrestling is king —
one of the most respected dynasties in North
American sports.

The program rose to dizzying heights under
legendary coach Dan Gable, including nine
straight NCAA titles from 1978 to 1986 and 15
overall in 21 years.
Upon Gable's retirement in 1997, program
alumnus Jim Zalesky took over and won three
NCAA titles in his first three years. But the
Hawkeyes finished a shocking sixth at the 2006
Big Ten Championships, and failed to have an
individual title at the Big Ten or NCAA Cham
pionships the past two seasons.
With a year left on his contract and predic
tions of a banner year in 2006-2007, Bowlsby
fired Zalesky on March 29, citing declining per
formance and declaring it was "time for new
leadership."
Shortly thereafter, the university announced
that former lowa wrestler Tom Brands would
become the head man in lowa City. Brands had
been an assistant to Zalesky before becoming
the head coach at Virginia Tech. Gable will re
turn to the coaching staff as Brands' assistant.
