## Peaking in time for Nationals Three teams expected to compete for national titles at end of the month 
### ELIZABETH THOMPSON 
Stanford sailing has about one month to
prepare for three National Championships:
women's dinghy, team race and co-ed dinghy.
This is the first time in over a decade that the
Card have qualified for all three competitions.
Nationals will take place in Charleston,
S.C.. hosted by the College of Charleston. The
women's races begin on May 24 and continue
for four consecutive days. Next, the team races
start May 29 and conclude May 31. The co-ed
dinghy competition is last, running from June
1 to 3.
Stanford's co-ed team, which competes in
both the dinghy and team races, is ranked
twelfth, behind schools such as Hobart and
William Smith, Harvard and St. Mary's of
Maryland. Junior Brian Haines, junior Emery
Wager and sophomore Edward Conrad will
skipper for the Card. Crewing will be senior
Anna Vu, freshman Taylor Grimes, freshman
Kelly McKenna and junior Becca Levin.

In the women's division, the Cardinal will be
looking to defeat the College of Charleston,
Yale and the Naval Academy. Junior Caroline
Young and sophomore Evan Brown will skip
per for the women, with Levin, sophomore
Carrie Denning and sophomore Sarah
Schoknecht as their crews.
Stanford's women have been doing notably
well this season, and are currently ranked fifth
in the nation. Coming into Nationals, they also
have an advantage over some other teams â€”
they've competed in Charleston before. They
performed well at a regatta there in February
despite severe weather, and are now familiar
with the course.
"We're very optimistic about our chances to
do well," Brown said. "The women's team as a
whole has peaked in the last few weeks and that
should only continue as we train for Nationals."
May will be an intense month for the sailors
as they prepare for Charleston. It will not be
much of a change of pace for the Cardinal, how
ever, who say they have trained with high inten
sity all season.
"Caroline and I have been working hard all
year, so the next few weeks will just be an ex
tension of the effort we and the entire team
have put in since September," Brown said.
