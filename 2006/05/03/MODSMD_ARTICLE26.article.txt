## Rugby ready for repeat of nat'l title 
### DENIS GRIFFIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
So what are you doing this Saturday? Probably sleeping, work
ing and reveling — though maybe not in that order.
Well, while you're doing all that, the women's rugby team might
just be winning their third national championship since 1999.
And despite the temptation to get caught up in focusing solely
on results, the team is as much about community as it is about
sports.
"One of the reasons I came to rugby is because I knew I want
ed to play a sport, and 1 knew how amazing this team was and how
amazing the coaches are." freshman Ono Nseyo said. "But 1 think
for me it's not the hours of sweat and toil — it's the people on this
team that make it so great."
Senior captain Bailey Sherlin agreed.
"It's fun to go out there and win, but it's great to be with those
people as well,"Sherlin said."l'm sure that those are the people I'll
see even after I graduate. And the more you continue to win, the
longer your season is. We're just hoping to extend our season as
long as possible."
Coach Jonathan Griffin points to his team's dedication to the
sport and self-motivated efforts as the reason for the program's re
cent success, including last year's national championship. He also
pointed out that the program's strong history has set the bar high
for this year's squad.
"I think the profile that goes along with athletics here, and the
expectations are reflected in the success of club sports." Griffin
said. "Our club sports here have a history of meeting the expecta
tions of the students and the athletic department, and our athletes
are willing to put the extra work in to be the best. From that per
spective it's actually very easy to coach athletes here."

And surprisingly for a team so dominant, most of Stanford's
players never played the game before arriving at the Farm.
"Right now we have one girl who actually played in high
schooljunior Jennifer Hernandez said. "Everyone else came
from practically every other sport."
"All of us obviously didn't play rugby in high school, but we all
played so many different sports," added senior Dena Acosta, one
of the team's presidents. "It worked out that somehow all of our
skills from all of those different sports could be incorporated into
rugby."
The lack of experience isn't as large of a negative as one might
think, according to assistant coach Josh Sutcliffe.
"1 think the thing is that when you describe rugby, it's an easy
game to get the concept of." Sutcliffe said. "You run from one end
to the other and put the ball in."
And experience isn't the only obstacle that some of these
women overcome.
"You don't have to be the superstar athlete to be a great com
petitor in rugby," Sutcliffe added. "I think one thing that sets it
apart from other sports is that we have girls who are 4-foot-8 who
can compete on the same field with girls who are over six feet tall."
As for the challenge at hand, the team will take on a physical
Navy team 10 a.m. this Friday. Coach Griffin hopes to counter the
physicality with speed and a unique home-field advantage.
"I do believe that man-for-man we've got the better players,"
Griffin said. "We know how to score points and it's on our field, a
bigger field than most teams are used to. So in terms of being able
to spread the defense, I think that that will be key."
If Stanford is victorious against Navy, they'll advance to Satur
day's noon final, where they'll face the winner of Friday's Penn
State/Ohio State semifinal. All contests will be played in Steuber
Stadium at Stanford.
