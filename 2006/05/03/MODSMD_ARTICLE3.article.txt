# Stanford, Cal to clash in 'Great Debate on nuclear tonight
## DEBATERS READY 
### CASSIE HARVEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It may not he as hyped as Big Game,
nor as trendy as Exotic Erotic, hut if
Sunday's practice round is any predic
tor, tonight's "Great Debate" will be a
lively affair. The Stanford debate team,
led by seniors Sihong Chan and Josh
Sandberg and junior Faris Mohiuddin
will square off against their UC-Berke
ley cohorts in tonight's annual contest.
"The Great Debate" began seven
years ago in the tradition of Big Game,
Big Swim and later such non-academic
competitions as Big Sing. Currently,

Stanford leads Cal 4-3 and 12-9 in indi
vidual ballot counts. It is the only time
the two teams compete against one an
other.
"There are multiple types of debate
at the college level," sophomore Sarah
Victoria member of the Stanford debate
team explained. "Berkeley competes in
the policy debate circuit, which is more
research-based. Stanford competes on
the parliamentary debate circuit which
emphasizes persuasiveness."
"The Great Debate" is a hybrid of
the two styles.
"It is a public-style debate," Victor
said, adding that "the tone is more con

versational to keep the general public
engaged. And the format levels the play
ing field."
A three-judge panel will preside over
tonight's contest. They will cast their
votes based on the content and persua
siveness of each team's argument.
Ihis year's debate topic is " Resolved:
That the United States federal govern
ment should substantially increase re
liance on nuclear energy for production
of electricity in the United States." Stan
ford will argue the opposing side. Victor
said debate topics are decided each year
