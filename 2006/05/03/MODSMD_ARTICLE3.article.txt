# Stanford, Cal to clash in 'Great Debate on nuclear tonight
## DEBATERS READY 
### CASSIE HARVEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It may not he as hyped as Big Game,
nor as trendy as Exotic Erotic, hut if
Sunday's practice round is any predic
tor, tonight's "Great Debate" will be a
lively affair. The Stanford debate team,
led by seniors Sihong Chan and Josh
Sandberg and junior Faris Mohiuddin
will square off against their UC-Berke
ley cohorts in tonight's annual contest.
"The Great Debate" began seven
years ago in the tradition of Big Game,
Big Swim and later such non-academic
competitions as Big Sing. Currently,

Stanford leads Cal 4-3 and 12-9 in indi
vidual ballot counts. It is the only time
the two teams compete against one an
other.
"There are multiple types of debate
at the college level," sophomore Sarah
Victoria member of the Stanford debate
team explained. "Berkeley competes in
the policy debate circuit, which is more
research-based. Stanford competes on
the parliamentary debate circuit which
emphasizes persuasiveness."
"The Great Debate" is a hybrid of
the two styles.
"It is a public-style debate," Victor
said, adding that "the tone is more con

versational to keep the general public
engaged. And the format levels the play
ing field."
A three-judge panel will preside over
tonight's contest. They will cast their
votes based on the content and persua
siveness of each team's argument.
Ihis year's debate topic is " Resolved:
That the United States federal govern
ment should substantially increase re
liance on nuclear energy for production
of electricity in the United States." Stan
ford will argue the opposing side. Victor
said debate topics are decided each year

about whether the federal government should substantially increase reliance on nuclear energy. The Cardinal will negate.
by a panel of people affiliated with the
Stanford and Berkeley debate programs.
"They try to choose something that's
topical and interesting," Mohiuddin
added, noting that recent topics have in
cluded the genocide in Darfur and the
Patriot Act.
A coin toss determines which side
each team will argue. But Stanford has
had a run of bad luck with the toss, losing
all of the last seven. Victor said Berkeley
agreed this year to forego the toss and let

Stanford chose which side they wanted to
argue.
"Last year, we had to defend why the
U.S. should not intervene to stop the
genocide in Darfur," Victor said. "That
was especially unfortunate. But we still
won. And we're convinced we'll domi
nate again this year."
The debate conforms to a strict for
mat, with time allotted for opening and
closing statements, three sets of argu
ments, three cross-examinations and con
cludes with questions from judges. The
whole event lasts approximately an hour.
Young, who will argue in this year's
debate, said preparation for the match
up can take months. Team members re
search tediously for weeks before draft

ing their arguments. A separate group is
assigned to role-play the Berkeley side.
They compile counter-arguments, antici
pating what the other team might say
When asked what would happen if
blind-sided by a question, Mohiuddin an
swered: "In a situation where they ask an
immensely specific question drawing on
some obscure University of Chicago
study...there are diplomatic ways to
brush the question aside. Also, the judges
are reasonable.They don't expect us to be
human databases."
Though Cal consistently puts up
strong contenders, the Stanford squad
said they feel confident in victory. Hie de
bate will begin at 7:30 p.m. in Tresidder's
Oak Lounge.
