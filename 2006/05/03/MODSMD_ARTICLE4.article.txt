## Exiled alum vies for presidency in Maldives 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
Last night in the Math Building, a
Stanford graduate detailed his return
to the Maldives — his homeland — to
oppose a regime that has been in place
for 28 years. But one of his main chal
lenges, he said, is his disagreement
with fellow opposition members, who
favor a more militant approach to top
pling the regime.
Mohammed Waheen, a former
member of the Maldivan Parliament,
lived in exile for the past decade and
favors nonviolent reform. He has re
turned home to join a newly formed
opposition party.

The Maldives is a Sunni Muslim na
tion in the Indian Ocean, composed of
more than 1,000 islands with approxi
mately 350,000 inhabitants. Mau
moom Abdul Gayoom has been the is
land nation's president since 1978.
Opponents such as Waheen claim
that even though he is an elected presi
dent,Gayoom has created a dictatorship.
"There is no separation of powers,"
Waheen said. " The president appoints
all judges and he fires them. He sets
the punishment for all political prison
ers. He rigs every single presidential
election. lie appoints eight members
of the 15-member parliament."

Stanford alum and former Member of Parliament Mohammed Waheen speaks last night about the
state of freedom in his country and his hopes to one day win the presidency of Maldives.
Waheen has experienced the ef
fects of repression firsthand. His
brother, an artist, was sentenced to
15-years in prison for giving infor
mation to Amnesty International, he
said. Members of his family and cam
paign staff were arrested during his
last term in Parliament.
But after the 2004 tsunami, which
devastated parts of the Maldives,
there has been increased interna
tional presence there. Waheen claims
that pressure from the United Na
tions, which created a commission to
study human rights in the nation,
forced the government to allow the
creation of opposition political par
ties for the first time in the current
regime's history.
This prompted Waheen to leave
his job at the U.N. and plan to run in
the 2008 elections.
"People are tired of having one
government for 28 years," he said.
"The opposition is in a position to
present policies that will benefit
more people than the current poli

cies of the government."
Waheen is a former high school
principal who went on to earn a PhD
in international education from
Stanford. He was elected to the Mal
divan Parliament by the largest ma
jority in its history. However, his re
formist views eventually led to per
secution and exile. He then pursued
a career in the United Nations,
where he was director of the U.N.
Children's Fund in Tanzania and
Afghanistan, following the U.S. inva
sion. After the government allowed
opposition parties to form, he re
turned to his homeland and joined
the Maldivan Democratic Party.
However, not even his party is a
united front. In December,he lost his
bid to lead the MDP
"I lost by a few votes," Waheen
said,"Partly because of my moderate
stance. There is so much frustration
among the youth right now. They
would like to see this resolved in the
streets. And 1 didn't favor that. The
presidency and chairmanship of the
party has fallen to others who sup
port a more militant approach."
In his years working for the U.N.,
Waheen has seen the effects of civil
strife.
"I've been to Nepal, and you're

reading about what's happening
there," he said. "I did three years in
Afghanistan. I don't wish any coun
try to go that route. It causes too
much damage and suffering. And it
can be avoided. We need leaders who
can communicate. We need leader
ship that will create a peaceful path
towards transition."
Waheen strongly opposed vio
lence even if the government refused
to honor an election outcome that
could result in a win for the opposi
tion.
"There are many options," he
said. "One option is to fight for your
rights. But you can fight in many
ways. 1 think it is a conscious choice
people make. And people [don't al
ways] take arms and fight because
that is the best thing to do.
"Sometimes they do it because it
is the easiest," he added. "Arms are
available and there are interests that
promote the sale of arms. It is possi
ble to buy AK-47s on the street. But
there are options. Now we are seeing
cases where the international com
munity forces the government to let
go. And the international communi
ty prevailed."
Waheen remains a part of the
MDP, but he is considering another

run for the leadership or attempting
to form his own party. He believes
that he has a broad base of support.
"I have the support of more than
a third of the party," he said in an in
terview with The Daily. "I believe
that most of them joined the party
because of me. It's a small country,so
most people know me or know about
me. lliey know of my history as a
politician and because of my interna
tional experience, they see me as a
future leader of the country."
Waheen's talk was sponsored by a
variety of organizations, including
the Muslim Students Awareness
Network (MSAN), the African Stu
dents Association and the Freeman-
Spogli Institute for International
Studies.
Sophomore Ahmed Maani, a
member of MSAN who helped to or
ganize the talk, hoped students
would learn about less well-known
parts of the world.
"We want to raise awareness of
developing countries that people
don't know much about," he said.
"When you ask people about the
Maldives, people just don't know
what it's about. Our mission is to
raise awareness about the diversity
of the Muslim world."

creation of opposition political par
ties for the first time in the current
regime's history.
This prompted Waheen to leave
his job at the U.N. and plan to run in
the 2008 elections.
"People are tired of having one
government for 28 years," he said.
"The opposition is in a position to
present policies that will benefit
more people than the current poli

cies of the government."
Waheen is a former high school
principal who went on to earn a PhD
in international education from
Stanford. He was elected to the Mal
divan Parliament by the largest ma
jority in its history. However, his re
formist views eventually led to per
secution and exile. He then pursued
a career in the United Nations,
where he was director of the U.N.
Children's Fund in Tanzania and
Afghanistan, following the U.S. inva
sion. After the government allowed
opposition parties to form, he re
turned to his homeland and joined
the Maldivan Democratic Party.
However, not even his party is a
united front. In December,he lost his
bid to lead the MDP
"I lost by a few votes," Waheen
said,"Partly because of my moderate
stance. There is so much frustration
among the youth right now. They
would like to see this resolved in the
streets. And 1 didn't favor that. The
presidency and chairmanship of the
party has fallen to others who sup
port a more militant approach."
In his years working for the U.N.,
Waheen has seen the effects of civil
strife.
"I've been to Nepal, and you're

reading about what's happening
there," he said. "I did three years in
Afghanistan. I don't wish any coun
try to go that route. It causes too
much damage and suffering. And it
can be avoided. We need leaders who
can communicate. We need leader
ship that will create a peaceful path
towards transition."
Waheen strongly opposed vio
lence even if the government refused
to honor an election outcome that
could result in a win for the opposi
tion.
"There are many options," he
said. "One option is to fight for your
rights. But you can fight in many
ways. 1 think it is a conscious choice
people make. And people [don't al
ways] take arms and fight because
that is the best thing to do.
"Sometimes they do it because it
is the easiest," he added. "Arms are
available and there are interests that
promote the sale of arms. It is possi
ble to buy AK-47s on the street. But
there are options. Now we are seeing
cases where the international com
munity forces the government to let
go. And the international communi
ty prevailed."
Waheen remains a part of the
MDP, but he is considering another

run for the leadership or attempting
to form his own party. He believes
that he has a broad base of support.
"I have the support of more than
a third of the party," he said in an in
terview with The Daily. "I believe
that most of them joined the party
because of me. It's a small country,so
most people know me or know about
me. lliey know of my history as a
politician and because of my interna
tional experience, they see me as a
future leader of the country."
Waheen's talk was sponsored by a
variety of organizations, including
the Muslim Students Awareness
Network (MSAN), the African Stu
dents Association and the Freeman-
Spogli Institute for International
Studies.
Sophomore Ahmed Maani, a
member of MSAN who helped to or
ganize the talk, hoped students
would learn about less well-known
parts of the world.
"We want to raise awareness of
developing countries that people
don't know much about," he said.
"When you ask people about the
Maldives, people just don't know
what it's about. Our mission is to
raise awareness about the diversity
of the Muslim world."
