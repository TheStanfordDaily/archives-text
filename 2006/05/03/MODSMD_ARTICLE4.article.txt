## Exiled alum vies for presidency in Maldives 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
Last night in the Math Building, a
Stanford graduate detailed his return
to the Maldives — his homeland — to
oppose a regime that has been in place
for 28 years. But one of his main chal
lenges, he said, is his disagreement
with fellow opposition members, who
favor a more militant approach to top
pling the regime.
Mohammed Waheen, a former
member of the Maldivan Parliament,
lived in exile for the past decade and
favors nonviolent reform. He has re
turned home to join a newly formed
opposition party.

The Maldives is a Sunni Muslim na
tion in the Indian Ocean, composed of
more than 1,000 islands with approxi
mately 350,000 inhabitants. Mau
moom Abdul Gayoom has been the is
land nation's president since 1978.
Opponents such as Waheen claim
that even though he is an elected presi
dent,Gayoom has created a dictatorship.
"There is no separation of powers,"
Waheen said. " The president appoints
all judges and he fires them. He sets
the punishment for all political prison
ers. He rigs every single presidential
election. lie appoints eight members
of the 15-member parliament."
