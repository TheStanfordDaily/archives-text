### JULIE KLEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's reputation for excellence in
teaching and research was reinforced last
month with the announcement of the 2006
Sloan Fellowship grants. Five Stanford fac
ulty members received Sloan Research Fel
lowships, making them among the elite
group of 116 researchers in the United
States and Canada to gain annual recogni
tion.
The winners receive $45,(XX) each over a

two-year period in for research in their re
spective fields. The Alfred P. Sloan Founda
tion has been granting the fellowships since
1955, when it granted $235,(XX) annually.
Today, the foundation gives out $5.22 mil
lion each year for scientific research across
North America.
Winners must have a PhD in one of
seven academic fields â€” chemistry, compu
tational and evolutionary molecular biolo
gy. computer science, mathematics, neuro
science and physics. They must work at a
college or university in the United States or

Canada, and they must be a current mem
ber of the regular faculty. In addition, recip
ients must have earned their most recent
doctorate or equivalent in the past six years.
According to the Sloan Foundation Web
site,"'lliese awards are intended to enhance
the careers of the very best young faculty
members in specified fields of science."
'Hie fellowship program is the oldest
program of the Sloan Foundation's initia
tives, but the recipients of the award are
among the youngest scientists the founda
tion aids. Sloan has specific reasons for

working with young researchers.
"Financial assistance at this crucial
point, even in modest amounts, often pays
handsome dividends later to society," reads
the foundation's Web site. "I"he selection
procedures for the Sloan Research Fellow
ships arc designed to identify those who
show the most outstanding promise of mak
ing fundamental contributions to new
knowledge."
