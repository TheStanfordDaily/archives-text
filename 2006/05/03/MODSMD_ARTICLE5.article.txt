# AWARDS & HONORS
## Five researchers, teachers receive Sloan grants 
### JULIE KLEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's reputation for excellence in
teaching and research was reinforced last
month with the announcement of the 2006
Sloan Fellowship grants. Five Stanford fac
ulty members received Sloan Research Fel
lowships, making them among the elite
group of 116 researchers in the United
States and Canada to gain annual recogni
tion.
The winners receive $45,(XX) each over a

two-year period in for research in their re
spective fields. The Alfred P. Sloan Founda
tion has been granting the fellowships since
1955, when it granted $235,(XX) annually.
Today, the foundation gives out $5.22 mil
lion each year for scientific research across
North America.
Winners must have a PhD in one of
seven academic fields â€” chemistry, compu
tational and evolutionary molecular biolo
gy. computer science, mathematics, neuro
science and physics. They must work at a
college or university in the United States or

Canada, and they must be a current mem
ber of the regular faculty. In addition, recip
ients must have earned their most recent
doctorate or equivalent in the past six years.
According to the Sloan Foundation Web
site,"'lliese awards are intended to enhance
the careers of the very best young faculty
members in specified fields of science."
'Hie fellowship program is the oldest
program of the Sloan Foundation's initia
tives, but the recipients of the award are
among the youngest scientists the founda
tion aids. Sloan has specific reasons for

working with young researchers.
"Financial assistance at this crucial
point, even in modest amounts, often pays
handsome dividends later to society," reads
the foundation's Web site. "I"he selection
procedures for the Sloan Research Fellow
ships arc designed to identify those who
show the most outstanding promise of mak
ing fundamental contributions to new
knowledge."
Many similar research grants come with
a set of restrictive criteria, limiting
the extent to which researchers can
explore their interests. However, the
Sloan Fellowship is unique in that its
use is completely unbounded, allow
ing winners to apply it to whatever
areas of study they wish to pursue.
Five different Stanford academic
departments are represented this
year among the awardees, including
chemical engineering, mathematics,
genetics, economics and computer
science.
Zhenan Bao, an associate profes
sor in the Chemical Engineering De
partment, studies synthesis and self
assembly of nano- and microstruc
tures with novel electronic and pho
tonic properties. She has already
been awarded 16 U.S. patents for her
work, and also won the American
Chemical Society Team Innovation
Award, among several others.
Asst. Prof. Simon Brendle of the
Mathematics Department special
izes in differential geometry. His
work focuses on the long-term be
havior of non-linear differential
equations, as well as the problem of
portfolio optimization.
Anne Brunet, an assistant profes
sor in the Genetics Department, pri
marily investigates the molecular
basis of longevity and the molecular
processes of aging. She works with
mammals, focusing on how they re
spond to external factors like calorie
restriction and oxidative stress.

Economics Asst. Prof. Muriel
Niederle studies how labor markets
work, and why they have different
effects and purposes for men and
women. She also studies why women
are so underrepresented in many of
today's top professional positions.
Her most recent paper, titled "Do
Women Shy Away from Competi
tion? Do Men Compete Too Much?"
centers around this issue. She plans
to use her grant to study the effects
of affirmative action.
Tim Roughgarden, an assistant
professor in the Computer Science
Department, studies theories of net
work optimization. He designs algo
rithms for centralized network con
trol that could potentially reduce the
cost of selfish routing. He wrote a
book titled "Selfish Routing and the
Price of Anarchy," which highlights
his research interests.
All of the winners are enthusias
tic about their recent awards. They
said the grant will give them the
means to do more extensive research
than they could with the basic re
sources available at Stanford.
"1 am honored to be one of the re
cipients," Bao said.
Niederle sums up the feelings of
her recipient peers when she com
ments on what she plans to do with
her grant.
"As work builds on previous
work, I understand more and more,"
she wrote in an email to The Daily.
"As I understand new things, I can
get other people interested in these
new ideas and insights. It's great to
have fun and do what 1 enjoy, and on
top of that, it's great to win big
prizes."
