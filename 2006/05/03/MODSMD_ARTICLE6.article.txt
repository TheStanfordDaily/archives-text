# CAMPUS LIFE
## Snow trip perks raise questions Lucrative ski trip business steered toward company with cozy ties to staffer 
### ANDREW BURMON STAFF WRITER 
For undergraduates heading to snowy Lake Tahoe, ski trip
is a chance to get off campus, relax and throw a few snowballs.
But to the companies that rent the cabins where Stanford stu
dents spend the weekend, busloads of undergraduates repre
sent big business, a business they are forced to compete for.
One company seems to have developed close ties with Assis
tant Director of Student Management Augie Galvan to get an
edge in the competition.
No company has been more successful attracting that busi
ness than Michelsens Rental, a small outfit out of Stateline,
Nev. Over the last several years, Michelsens Rental has been
booked by many a house social manager, the people ultimate
ly responsible for ski trip reservations. A great number of
those social managers who chose to book their houses
through Michelsens were making reservations on behalf of
Row Houses. Invariably, Michelsens was recommended to
these social managers by Galvan.
This year, at Social Manager Orientation, Galvan an
nounced that he had pre-booked rental homes for Ski TVip, an
act beyond his normal job description. The homes were
booked for Martin Luther King Jr. weekend. Galvan told the
social managers that all they had to do was confirm their
reservations.
"No alternative companies were provided as sources of
houses," said one Row Social Manager who wished to remain
anonymous. "But there was no requirement that you had to
book your house through Michelsens."
Another social manager, who also asked to remain un
named, recalled that Galvan really pushed for Michelsens,
"almost making them seem like the only option."
Social managers who asked for Galvan's help while book
ing homes were given the Michelsens phone number and told
to "talk to Julie."
