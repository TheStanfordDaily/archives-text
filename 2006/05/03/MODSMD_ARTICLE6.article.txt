# CAMPUS LIFE
## Snow trip perks raise questions Lucrative ski trip business steered toward company with cozy ties to staffer 
### ANDREW BURMON STAFF WRITER 
For undergraduates heading to snowy Lake Tahoe, ski trip
is a chance to get off campus, relax and throw a few snowballs.
But to the companies that rent the cabins where Stanford stu
dents spend the weekend, busloads of undergraduates repre
sent big business, a business they are forced to compete for.
One company seems to have developed close ties with Assis
tant Director of Student Management Augie Galvan to get an
edge in the competition.
No company has been more successful attracting that busi
ness than Michelsens Rental, a small outfit out of Stateline,
Nev. Over the last several years, Michelsens Rental has been
booked by many a house social manager, the people ultimate
ly responsible for ski trip reservations. A great number of
those social managers who chose to book their houses
through Michelsens were making reservations on behalf of
Row Houses. Invariably, Michelsens was recommended to
these social managers by Galvan.
This year, at Social Manager Orientation, Galvan an
nounced that he had pre-booked rental homes for Ski TVip, an
act beyond his normal job description. The homes were
booked for Martin Luther King Jr. weekend. Galvan told the
social managers that all they had to do was confirm their
reservations.
"No alternative companies were provided as sources of
houses," said one Row Social Manager who wished to remain
anonymous. "But there was no requirement that you had to
book your house through Michelsens."
Another social manager, who also asked to remain un
named, recalled that Galvan really pushed for Michelsens,
"almost making them seem like the only option."
Social managers who asked for Galvan's help while book
ing homes were given the Michelsens phone number and told
to "talk to Julie."
Julie is Julie Holzhauer, the man
ager of Michelsens Properties who
has been working at the Stateline of
fice since August when she was hired
by Gary Michelsen, the owner of the
company and of most of the proper
ties themselves. Gary's relationship
with Galvan went back for many
years. For quite some time,
Michelsens Rental had been offering
Galvan two free weekends a year in
one of his large properties by the
lake.
"It was something they had al
ways done," Galvan said. "They real
ly appreciate the business."
"We have a working relationship
with Augie," Holzhauer said.
The working relationship is two
sided, according to Galvan, who used
one of the free weekends to go up
with ski trippers.
"Gary likes for me to be up there
because when we first worked with
them in the past there were some
problems." Galvan said.
This year was no exception. Gal
van used the free weekend while ski
trips were in progress. When one stu
dent broke his arm, Galvan was

nearby to help manage the situation.
He was staying in a Michelsen house
with his two godchildren who he'd
invited up for the weekend.
As for the other weekend that
Michelsen offers Galvan, he insists
that he rarely uses it.
"I use it every once in a while but
not very often," Galvan said,"l think
I have only used it twice."
But it still comes in handy.
"This year Mars said they had a
date and Michelsens said they had a
date and the dates weren't the
same," Galvan said. "I was willing to
say why not give Mars the perk
Michelsens had given me."
The misunderstanding between
Mars and Michelsens was not the
first confusion between the compa
ny and a Row social manager. A sim
ilar mishap with the company oc
curred last year when the Stanford
Risk Management Department can
celled ski trips for all the dorms
planning to head to Tahoe for the
Jan. 7 weekend. Galvan told the stu
dents who still planned to go to the
rental homes that they had booked
through Michelsens Rental that the
houses would be closed to them. Six
Row houses were forced to cancel
their trips, losing thousands in rental
costs.
Galvan is still sticking by
Michelsens.

"They are one of our many re
sources," he said. "They are pretty
flexible.They turn their heads a little
bit. Having a relationship like that is
really wonderful."
Galvan maintains that the rela
tionship between himself and
Michelsens is in the best interest of
the students for whom he says he
feels a parental responsibility.
"I don't think of it as a kickback,"
Galvan said. "They offered it to me,
and it is a good business practice for
them."
But that good business relation
ship may be severed. When The
Daily contacted Julie Hanzhauer she
reported that Michelsens would no
longer be offering Galvan his two
free weekends.
"It was the owner's decision," she
said before refusing to give out Gary
Michelsen's contact information.
Galvan had not yet been in
formed of this decision by
Michelsen, the man he says "likes
having him up theref." Still, he took
the news in stride.
"If they were to say that it's not
going to happen any more than it's
not going to — whatever — I will
make every effort out of my own
pocket to get up there," he said.

dential Education, declined to com
