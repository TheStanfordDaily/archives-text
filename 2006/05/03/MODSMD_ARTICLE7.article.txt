## Study shows boycotts do make change

As millions showed their support for immi
grant rights through consumer boycotts Mon
day.two Graduate School of Business (GSB) re
searchers have concluded that boycotts really
can work. In the run-up to the Iraq war three
years ago, the grassroots effort encouraging
Americans to not purchase French wine caused
a 26 percent reduction in wine sales at the peak
of the boycott, a new study finds
Phillip Leslie, assistant professor of strategic
management, and Larry Chavis, a PhD student
at the GSB, have been researching the US. con
sumer boycott of French wine that began in
early 2(K)3 as a response to France's opposition
to the war in Iraq.They found that at the peak of
the boycott, French wine sales were down by 26
percent.
"Ibe boycott of French wine struck us as an
especially interesting high profile example."
Leslie said. "First, for many wine consumers
there are close substitutes to French wine, so
participation in the boycott may involve little
sacrifice. Second, we could explore the mecha
nism. Did participation vary across cities in the
U.S. in a way that is related to political prefer
ences? Did the effects differ by price segment?"
ITicre have been previous studies of boycotts
against specific companies, such as Nike. How
ever, these projects looked at stock prices —
which could be affected by factors other than
the boycott and are not entirely in
dicative of consumer participation.
According to Leslie, these studies in
dicate no significant effect. In the new
investigation, the researchers con
trolled for such confounding factors
by strictly looking at actual wine sales.
Leslie noted that this boycott was
different than most because it was
prompted by a government policy and
impacted the entire French wine in
dustry. Therefore, this study also
showed how a government's interna
tional policy could impact the foreign
earned profits of its domestic firms.
The two researchers observed
weekly sales of wine in Boston, Hous
ton, Los Angeles and San Diego from
December 2(H) 1 to November 2(X)3.
Their data encompassed 14 months
before the start of the Iraq war and 10
months after the invasion. TTie sales
figures included wine from all coun
tries with special focus on French
wines. The six-month boycott caused
French wine sales to drop 13 percent
over the course of the boycott. Leslie
and Chavis extrapolated the data
from the four cities to estimate that
the boycott caused $122 million in
forgone sales from the United States.
"The main implication is that man
agers should indeed take seriously the
consequences of potential consumer
boycotts," Leslie said. "For the eco
nomics literature, our findings suggest
the need for a more refined view of
voluntary consumer boycotts."
While the findings have not yet
been published, a summary article
has been submitted to multiple eco
nomics journals.
