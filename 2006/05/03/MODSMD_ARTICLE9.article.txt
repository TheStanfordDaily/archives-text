# AMUSEMENTS
## Students play The Game Dorms and residences hold team building exercises, competitions 
### KATHERINE COX STAFF WRITER 
Think pulling an all-nighter means locking your
self in Meyer with a textbook and gallons of a ra
dioactive green energy drink? Think again. This
spring, carloads of Stanford students will go noctur
nal to puzzle their way from one Bay Area destina
tion to another in various editions of a heefed-up
treasure hunt called The Game.
While renditions of The Game — which cover
an area as small as campus or the entire Bay Area
itself — are most often organized by staff of fresh
man dorms, enthusiasts in upperclassman resi
dences often design their own versions. Smaller
dorms or houses are more likely to co-sponsor
Games with other residences.
Some Games are more rigorous than others, but
the nuts and bolts of each are similar. Students em
bark from residences in "teams" whose numbers
are determined by the size of the team's car. Partic
ipants must unscramble a set of common clues in
order to gain the coordinates of the next destina
tion from"The Game Control" unit back on cam
pus. The team with the most brain power, the keen
est navigation skills and the most energy will crack
the final code and log the fastest time.
A few dorms and residences have already
launched their Games. East House
held theirs two weekends ago while Roble's oc
curred this Friday and Saturday. Roble's RCC,
Jesse Young, a grad student studying electrical engi
neering and computer science, designed one of the
more popular and successful Games this year.
"Out of 22 teams that started, 21 finished, which
I think is a very, very large success rate," Young said.
Roble opened registration to teams in other dorms,
while the turnout from the four-class dorm was still
remarkably high. "Eight teams were of current
residents, which is about 40 out of the 3(X) hundred
students at Roble," Young said.
Among fellow clue-writers. Young's work is well
known.
"Jesse's game is orders of magnitude better than
others," said Joel Lewenstein. a sophomore in Du
rand — who will co-produce a Game with sopho
more Sam Shrank for May 28 and 29."What's most
impressive about his game is the complete experi
ence. It's both the complexity of the clues and the
whole story line that he's set up to go with it."
While Lewenstein clutched tightly to his folder
of top-secret Game clues, the Roble Game guru
shared some of the mind-benders that his team
members faced last weekend.
"My favorite clue was a Sudoku puzzle that in
stead of having numbers from 1 to 9 on the grid,
there were letters," Young said. "All of the grid's

squares were one of nine different colors — some
blank and some with letters on them," Young said.
He continued to describe how various trivia cate
gories, in which the elements correspond to a num
ber or ranking — for example, US presidents and
digits in French — lined the sides of the grid. The
team members were expected to convert the grid
letters in to numbers using these hints.
"For instance, the letter T in a square would cor
respond to the French number three (trois)," he
continued. Finally, the numbered grid would be
converted back to letters which ultimately spelled
the last name of Stanford's tenth president.
But participants didn't have the answer yet.The
location of the next clue was obscured by yet anoth
er layer of The Game's procedures.
"In our game, the way players would determine
locations is by calling an automated phone line that
we set up and which would ask for the answer to a
clue as a password." Young said. "When they typed
that in it would tell them their next destination."
Curiously, Stanford students seem to relish such
puzzles — logic problems others might avoid at all
costs, or at least until they have to take the L-SAT.
FroSoCo's RA and Game organizer Wataru Ebina,
a senior, even compared this aspect of the game to
taking an exam.
"The Game is like a take-home midterm in a
class you love," Ebina said. "You squeeze your
brain for all it's got to search for ways to make sense
out of the problem and after a moment of eureka
— often coupled with frustration — you have to
quickly move on because the next clue is waiting.
And once it's finally over, you take your still-jittery
body to bed." According to Ebina, however,
the camaraderie, the shenanigans and the sight-see
ing opportunities of the activity more than compen
sate for the stress of the mental acrobatics.
For Lewenstein, who reminisced about his expe
rience participating in Larkin's Game last year, the
structure of the race facilitates new discoveries and
singular experiences.
"Last year, it was 5 a.m. and we were parked at a
pier eating croissants and coffee and we saw the sun
rise over the Bay Bridge," Lewenstein recalled.
"The Game takes you to places you wouldn't nor
mally go and gives you experiences you wouldn't
otherwise have."
To obtain one of Young's clues, the faint of heart
were certainly required to step outside their com
fort zone.
"One of the destinations was the Point Bonita
Light House.so participants had to walk in the dark
at 1 or 2 a.m. on this narrow cliffside path that was
about a quarter and half of a mile long in order to
get the next clue-packet," he said.
Rave reviews by peers have convinced Lindsay
Mecca, a senior living in Durand, to participate in
Lewenstein's and Shrank's rendition at the end of
May.
"A bunch of people in my fresh
man dorm played the Game and re
turned exhausted with fantastic sto
ries," Mecca said. "The getting lost in
San Francisco, the punchiness that
sets in as sleep depravation creeps
over everyone, the glory of finally
figuring out an impossible clue —
that in and of itself sounds awesome,
but the bonding experience that it
provides for the team makes it that
much more appealing."
The Game, now an established
Stanford tradition, was conceived in
Florida and later refined on the
Farm by Joe Belfiore, a freshman in
1986.The maiden voyages to the Bay
Area were first christened BARF —
the Bay Area Race Fantastique —
by Belfiore and dormmates. Today,
alums and new converts play more
extensive Games in the Bay Area.
An annual official Game takes place
in Seattle, where Belfiore eventually
settled to work at Microsoft.
