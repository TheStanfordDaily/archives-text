# It's Not Easy
## BEING GREEN Stanford Hosts Conference on building Green and your Health 
### MEGHAN McCURDY 
etween work, home and
| J transportation, the modern
individual rarely steps out-
the confines of man
made buildings and artificial
structures. Climate control,
urban sprawl and ever-increasing amounts
of construction only add to concerns about
the relationship between exponential man
made growth and public health. A propor
tionately small amount of research and
public attention has been focused on the
impact these built environments have on
long-term health and chronic disease. For
this reason, the Stanford Prevention Re
search Center is holding a one-day confer
ence on Thursday, March 11, titled "The
Built Environment and Your Health: How
Buildings, Urban Form and Man-Made De
vices Shape Health Across the Lifespan."
The first of its kind held at Stanford, the
conference will feature experts on engi
neering, medicine, epidemiology, anthro
pology, history and urban planning, among
other disciplines. The founders of the con
ference hope to mobilize awareness, train
ing and research in multiple fields.
Abby King, a researcher at the Stanford
Prevention Research Center and a founder
of the conference, says, "We are very inter
ested in better understanding the interface
between the individual and his/her envi
ronment, with respect to promoting
healthful lifestyle."
To accomplish this goal, the conference
will feature presentations and panels on

such varied topics as the impact of built en
vironments on youth, population levels and
modern research challenges. The confer
ence will also present initiatives to address
these issues with environmentally-con
scious engineering and construction — in
cluding Stanford's own Green Dorm Pro
ject.
John Haymaker, a professor of civil and
environmental engineering and a member
of the Green Dorm Building Committee,
will be presenting the research and feasibil
ity studies centered around the project,
now known as the Living Laboratory.
Haymaker told the Daily,"Our goal is to
invite research and teaching about human
health and how to integrate it with other di
mensions of sustainability, using the Living

Laboratory as a case study."
Senior Emma Yuen notes
that Stanford has a high
number of students interest
ed in such sustainability is
sues. Accordingly, the con
ference should appeal to
many.
"I think that there are
many people who are inter
ested in architecture [at]
Stanford... this conference
presents important informa
tion for builders that affect
Stanford as well as the entire
world," Yuen says.
The conference isn't,
geared to only those future^

civil and environmental engineering ma
jors, either. Those with an interest in medi
cine and public health may find it interest
ing as well.
Lauren Finzer, a freshman interested in
public health, says, "Combining disciplines
to explore the influence of man-made envi
ronment on health sounds interesting and
innovative."
Panels focused specifically on issues of
medicine and health will tackle such gar
gantuan topics as the relationship between
urbanization and infectious disease in the
developing world; the effect of the home
environment on children's respiratory
health; and the connection between global
ization, politics and disease in Western
India.
Discussions of historical development
of cities and suburbs as well as

behavioral patterns and health
will prove interesting for those
curious about the related psy
chology, sociology, history and
urban studies. Conference atten
dees will have a chance to inter
act with presenters on issues ad
dressed throughout the day, with

a moderated audience discussion in the
morning and informal roundtable discus
sions with experts on varying topics over
lunch.
Finzer praises the multi-disciplinary ap
proach of the conference, explaining,"[This
conference] promotes not only collabora
tion among faculty, students and the public,
but also emphasizes interdisciplinary think
ing, which is how 1 think we can make im
portant advances."
Lynn Hildemann, one of the presenters,
agrees.
"This conference represents a unique
opportunity for an environmental engineer
like me to interact with and learn from ex
perts in the health care field," she says.
As for the long-term effects of the event.
King is hopeful that it will raise awareness
and galvanize further collaboration be
tween institutes and universities to contin
ue research.
She adds, "The goal of this
conference...is to highlight current research
that is being undertaken in the school of
medicine as well as several other schools
around campus as a first step toward build
ing collaborations on this topic across cam
pus and with other scientific groups in the
Bay Area."
The conference will be held at the
Schwab Center on May 11 and will last all
day. Space is limited, but those interested in
attending or finding out piore can visit the
