# No More Frankenfruit: Organic dining picks up at Stanford
## 
### WEENA PUN 
With growing awareness and de
mand for organic food from con
sumers, Stanford Dining is one of
the pioneers in United States to in
corporate organic and sustainable
dining programs in the school's din
ing services system. Organic food is
grown without the use of genetic en
gineering, chemical fertilizers, pesti
cides, hormones, irradiation, animal
drugs or intensive confinement of
farm animals.
A few years ago, Stanford creat
ed an agreement with California's
Central Coast region with a cooper
ative of about 17 farms. California's
Central Coast is home to a range of
organic farms, farmer's markets.
Community Supported Agriculture
(CSA) projects, research on organic
production, and other alternative
programs. With the agreement came
the massive challenge of changing
the misconceptions about the or
ganic food and raising awareness

about it. The winning of 2(X)6 Ivy
Award for dining excellence and the
growth of the organic herbs garden
on campus under the Stanford Stu
dent Community Garden shows the
success of this program.
"The Community Garden is defi
nitely to educate students about sus
tenance and organic farming," says
freshman Martin Duncan who is in
charge of the community garden in
Flomo dining hall. After being asked
whether he prefers organic to regu
lar food, Duncan voted in favor of
organic.
"It tastes better," Duncan reasons.
But Martin is not satisfied with the se
lection of the organic food in the din
ing hall. Duncan wishes there were
more organic food in the servery.
However, Nikhil V. Kamat, a
freshman at Flomo, although prefers
organic food to regular but does not
want it to be expanded. He acknowl
edges that non-organic food is com
mercially dominated by big indus
tries advocating a genetically modi

fied monoculture. But he points out
that organic food is generally expen
sive and the expansion would mean
the rise in meal prices. "The meal
plans are already very expensive," he
showed his dissatisfaction.
In general,students think that the
organic food is healthier but when it
comes to expansion,some hesitate to
vote for its expansion because of the
danger of increment in meal-prices.
Stanford Dining is also aware of
both the benefits of the organic food
and the challenge of cost. The offi
cial Stanford Dining website says
that it is constantly increasing or
ganic produce purchases at the resi
dential dining locations and it nego
tiates with local farmers to keep the
costs down while still providing high
quality organic produce.
"We are continuing to increase
our purchasing in this area. We pur
chase our organic produce when it is
in season," says Rafi Taherian. Exec
utive Director for Stanford Dining.
"By purchasing items when they are

in season, the difference in price be
tween organic and conventional
items is not significant. We also try
to purchase our items locally
(ALBA), which cuts transportation
and shipping costs," Taherian adds.
11owever,Taherian emphasizes that
conventional produce should not be
compared to organic produce as the
two are significantly different in re
gards to taste, texture, water content
and overall quality.Taherian,but as
serts that the ingredients used in
preparing meals in the dining halls
are organic whenever possible. "The
'organic' items labeled as such are
completely organic, including the in
gredients," Taherian says.
Currently, 25% of the food purchas
ing is organic. Approximately 25-
30% of the proteins are free-range
and/or non-hormone fed. 1(K)% of
the burgers are made with grass-fed
patties from Marin Sun Farms. All of
the whole and rotisserie chickens
are organic and free-range from
Petaluma Poultry. Lamb legs are

also organic and free-range. Stan
ford Dining hall is looking to expand
and increase the purchasing.
The first U.S University to have a
peanut sensitive dining hall in re
sponse to the probable food allergy
in the students, Stanford Dining, un
doubtedly, wants the best for the stu
dents. Taherian notifies that they are
responding to student requests to
feature more of the organic items
but does not comment on whether
he believes organic food is healthier.
Taherian agrees that there has been
an increase in demand from stu
dents in regards to organic options.
In addition to these, Stanford
Dining is piloting a composting pro
gram at The Marketplace at Wilbur.
According to the Stanford Dining
website, it separates food waste and
delivers this compost to local farm
ers. Through 01ives@Bldg.160, Stan
ford Dining provides compost to the
Stanford Farm. In return, it receives
their organic fruits and vegetables
and uses them in the food it serves us.
