## Editorial What's wrong with Stanford's body image? 
### 
Day or night, rain or shine, you can al
ways count on one thing — there will
always be someone exercising on
campus. Whether its weight training at Arril
laga, jogging around Lake Lag or the occa
sional yoga or kickboxing class, most Stan
ford students try to take time each day to
stay healthy and in shape. In fact, when it
comes to exercise, the general attitude on
campus is that there can never be too much
of a good thing.
But in reality, over-exercising can be a sign
of the dangerous eating disorder exercise bu
limia. Characterized by compulsive exercise,
the disorder is usually attached to feelings of
guilt over eating. The exercise bulimic works
out to purge what he or she has eaten, much
like other bulimics vomit after eating.
A relatively new phenomenon, according
to CNN, exercise bulimia is predicted to be
come more threatening than both anorexia
and bulimia. The disorder is particularly dan
gerous because those who suffer from it tend
to give the illusion of health. Because most
people are under the impression that any
amount of exercise is healthy, the problem
can easily be confused with a healthy exercise
regime and is almost impossible to detect.
Body image is extremely important in col
lege, especially since we are located in a par
ticularly health-conscious state, on a campus
that emphasizes athletics. This body-con
scious environment — combined with the
competitive nature of the average Stanford
student — puts us at particularly high risk for
eating disorders.
But intervention training on campus is
sparse and poorly publicized. Apart from the
few skits and dorm sessions during New Stu
dent Orientation, most students receive no
guidance on how to deal with eating disor
ders. The current intervention system is

based on students encouraging their friends
to get help, but most don't know how to spot
an eating disorder — especially one as unno
ticeable as exercise bulimia — let alone how
to approach the situation or who to turn to
for help.
The University could help alleviate this
problem by implementing intervention
training for eating disorders and providing
students with accessible counselors who can
help them cope with these difficult issues. The
University should also allow dorm staff to
step in and persuade students suffering from
disorders to seek medical help, rather than
wait for the student to come to terms with the
disease and voluntarily seek assistance.
While greater staff involvement may seem
paternalistic, in extreme cases, such preemp
tive policies may be necessary for the welfare
of a student.
However, students must also take the ini
tiative to find out more about how to spot
and deal with eating disorders. If a friend,
dormmate or classmate is exhibiting possible
symptoms of an eating disorder — such as
dramatic weight loss in a short period of time,
compulsive exercise or frequent trips to the
bathroom immediately following meals —
students should take the initiative to talk to
these individuals, even at the risk of being
wrong. Students who feel themselves falling
into these habits should find someone — a
friend, a peer health educator, a resident as
sistant or a professional counselor — to talk
to before the problem gets out of hand.
But even in the absence of serious eating
disorders, Stanford students' obsession with
healthy eating, exercise and general body
image should raise concern about the trend's
underlying issues — our insecurity with our
body shapes and our general dissatisfaction
with ourselves.
