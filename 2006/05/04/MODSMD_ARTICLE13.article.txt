# Our country's gas problem
## 
### 
So we've finally learned what pisses this
country off. It's not the war. It's not
criminal incompetence, as The Boss
would say. It's not a corrupt government.
And it's not the second highest office in the
land shooting a man in the face.
It's simple really: it?s the cost of toting lit
tle Johnny and his friends to soccer practice
in the family's Ford Excursion.
On Monday the average cost of regular
unleaded gasoline was $2.90 per gallon, al
most a dollar more than it was two years ago.
The same day. Senate Republicans pro
posed a bill in response to the growing con
cern over the rising gasoline prices. The pro
posal called for $ 1 (K) checks to be sent later
this summer to approximately 1 (X) million
taxpayers, whether they drive a car or not.
And why only $1(X) dollars, which, let's be
honest, you probably won't spend on gaso
line anyway? Because Senate majority
leader Bill Frist's office calculates that that
the average driver pays $11 per month in
federal gas taxes. Oh, and by the way, the
proposal also calls for drilling in Alaska.
What Frist and Senate Republicans did
n't foresee was just how transparent this
pandering ploy really was. Even Conserva
tive talk show host Rush Limbaugh asked,
"What kind of insult is this? Instead of buy
ing us off and treating us like we're a bunch
of whores, just solve the problem." Brit
Hume called the proposal "silly" on Fox
News Sunday.
On Hiesday, Frist and the Senate Repub
licans pulled the proposal off the floor. In
stead of pandering to voters, the Republi
cans decided they would rather pander to
big corporations, who had a problem with
the additional tax the bill called for (big sur
prise). For some reason. Republicans are
worried about alienating their corporate
base even though gas prices are soaring to
wards four dollars a gallon. Let's not forget
that last quarter Exxon recorded the fifth
largest quarterly profits in corporation his
tory. Not to mention the $36 billion in profits
they recorded last year.
Even after watching the "experts" on
"Meet The Press" last Sunday, I still don't
understand how the rising cost of crude oil
justifies the Exxon's record profits. I under
stand there is a strong demand for gas, but
don't increased profits mean oil companies
are simply charging more?
Yet in response to the gas "crisis," as En
ergy Secretary Samuel Bodman called it,
government officials and big oil companies
spout off justifications that most people
don't understand or don't have any control
over:
China and India have entered into the oil
market, driving the price of oil up. Great,
nothing the government or any of us can do
about that.
There has yet to he an inexpensive method
of synthesizing the corn-based and emis

sions-reducing Ethanol into oil refining. I
don't know how to do that, but 1 like the
sound of that emissions-reducing stuff.
The rise in gas prices has been developing
for several years and there is nothing we can
do in the short term to stop it. We're screwed.
But what government officials and big oil
companies fail to say is that there actually is
something we as consumers and the govern
ment can do to bring gas prices down: Stop
buying gasoline and actually make it a major
government priority to develop alternative
energy sources.
In his column last Friday in The New
York Times, Thomas Friedman said the only
way to fix the energy crisis is to take seem
ingly drastic measures to reduce our de
pendency on oil, including raising gas prices.
"We need a tax on gasoline at the pump
that will keep prices around four dollars a
gallon (still roughly one dollar less than most
Europeans pay)," he writes, "or we need a
tax on vehicles that will make gas guzzlers
prohibitively costly and hybrids and smaller
cars enormously attractive."
We need to make a concerted effort to re
duce the amount of gasoline we buy. We
should also start holding politicians who
claim to care about the rising gas prices ac
countable for their consumption of gas.
Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert held a
press conference at a local gas station last
TUesday to address the rising cost of gas. To
prove he is an environmentally concerned
Republican, he left the press conference in a
fuel-efficient hybrid van. But once he was
out of sight of the cameras (or so he
thought), he jumped out of the van and into
his usual gas-guzzling SUV. Check the Asso
ciated Press picture out on Yahoo news.
Some citizens are trying to take action. In
Bee County Texas, the governing board
called for a boycott of ExxonMobil gas. Ac
cording to a local survey, 72 percent of the
county is going to participate.The goal of the
boycott is to force gas prices to drop to $1.30
a gallon. While economists say this tactic
won't work, it's a noble attempt at making a
point and should get our attention.
The problem is we are all too much like
Rush Limbaugh — we don't want to change
our lives; we just want the government to
solve the problem. And this may be one prob
lem that a pro-corporation government will
be unable to fix without alienating its base.
