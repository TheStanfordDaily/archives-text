# A 						Modern Day Fairytale
## A 						glimpse of life in the village 
### 
A screaming goat sounds human. Our
neighbors across the street cornered
the animal and one girl hefted it onto
her back, piggy-back style, with its front legs
sticking straight out over her shoulders.
"He didn't want to go home!" she shouted
to us.
For a week we stayed with families in
Keiskammahoek, a rural area consisting of
34 different small villages. We were split into
pairs and sent to different villages, not know
ing what we were getting ourselves into. Part
of the point of this excursion was to get a feel
for the life and the people here. Without run
ning water, we learned to bathe in buckets,
use outhouses and collect water from a com
munal tap.
We learned about the present through
water and the past through corn. During the
five days we stayed in her home, our host
mother cooked half a dozen classic Xhosa
dishes for us. The dishes she didn't prepare,
she described for us in detail.
"Inkobe. That is cooked mealies. In the
olden days we would eat this at funerals with
roasted cookies."
Despite the beautiful setting of green hills
in the foreground, mountains in the distance
and small colorful villages of mud and cow
manure houses nestled in the creases of the
landscape, our host mother's recipes painted
a picture of a childhood of hardship. Her fa
ther abandoned the family when she was
young, leaving her mother to take care of
four boys and two girls on her own. Our host
mother grew up into a fiercely independent
woman who chose to raise her own children
by herself.
"Umfino. Near the house there is a kind of
plant — irhabe — a weed that you cook with
mealie meal and some mealie rice and a little
bit of fat and that is Umfino. Now you can
cook Umfino with spinach and cabbage and

that is Umfuno."
As a retired teacher, she still had sway
over the kids in the village. Accordingly, she
told three small boys to bring us some of the
irhabe that grew in the hills beyond the
house.
My roommate Debi was dead-set on hav
ing a host family with a cow she could milk.
Instead of farm animals, we got a village
worth of children. As soon as we arrived,
three girls showed up at the doorstep, with a
well-used tennis ball and a few words in Eng
lish.
Wherever we went, groups of children fol
lowed us. Debi and I had brought candy, a
Frisbee and digital cameras, instantly making
us the most popular girls in town. We let the
kids use the cameras and we were manipulat
ed and posed with as if we were cardboard
cut-outs of celebrities. The kids taught us
hand games and we taught them some classic
dance moves: the Lawnmower.the Shopping
Cart and the Sprinkler.
We were a kind of spectacle and an inno
cent running joke. Our first day, we went
through the village and greeted everyone in
sight. A toothless old man, with coke-bottle
glasses and a ferocious grip, stopped us in the
street and told me he loved me. Every semes
ter he picks a "girlfriend" out of the Ameri
can students — his selection was our official
welcome.
My host mother found us especially amus
ing. At dinner one night, a moth the size of my
face landed on the table, startling Debi and
me. My host mother laughed at us for a long
time, saying, "Don't be afraid, it's only a but
terfly." She shut the kitchen door, "to keep
the butterflies out."
"Ingxangxa. You take mealies and you
add the sour milk." Fresh milk wasn't always
available, she explained, so foods were made
using sour milk. We've come across this par

ticular dish before in New Brighton — it has
the consistency of cottage cheese and is in
nocuously known as "African Salad." Those
brave enough to try it have warned everyone
else — it is as bad as it sounds.
Learning to eat food with sour milk is
hardly half the hardship for the people in the
village. Beneath the veneer of the peaceful
and beautiful valley, everyone has a hard luck
story. Our host mother filled us in on village
gossip — how one little girl had witnessed
her father stab her mother to death in a
drunken rage, how another girl is in a wheel
chair because of injuries inflicted by her sis
ter, how the area is caught in a cycle of pover
ty where education is prohibitively expensive
and employment scarce.
Ironically, many villagers thought we
faced bigger challenges as Americans.
"Aren't you scared of Osama?" someone
asked me.
We went to church and one woman gave
loud thanks to God for her niece's safe return
from London where there is war, fighting and
violence.
One afternoon, while sitting on benches in
the back of a pick-up truck (the area's ver
sion of a taxi), the four of us Americans stay
ing in the village, pre-meds to the last, talked
of our plans for the future. I participated
guiltily, thinking that in America we may
have fear of being blind-sided by catastrophe
while at work or on the way to school, but so
many of us have choices — the luxury of
stressing about graduate school or what kind
of career to pursue, unheard of to the people
around us.
Keiskammahoek is beautiful. I was fortu
nate to have the chance to stay there and
even more privileged to be able to leave. For
many there is no escape.
