## Pride in the family name Tangtiphaiboontana's success on the Farm can be traced back to the influence of an older brother 
### CARSON COOPER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Growing up, Thomas and Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana
fought as much as any brother and sister. At least they had
two things in common: an innate love of golf and a ridicu
lously long last name.
Sibling rivalry was at its strongest in the Tangtiphaiboon
tana family, with Jennifer constantly tagging along as her older
brother developed as a junior golfer, but it was the death of
their parents and their shared love of golf that helped bring
them closer together.
Three years Jennifer's elder, Thomas decided to ply his trade
at Yale, a school that isn't known much for its athletic prowess,
even in golf. Meanwhile, the younger Tangtiphaiboontana was
quickly developing into an outstanding golfer herself, despite
having her older brother away at school.
After finishing as the runner-up in the 2002 U.S. Girls Ama
teur Championship, Tangtiphaiboontana had her choice of
scholarships to elite women's golf schools throughout the nation.
Nevertheless, she thought about following behind her older
brother yet again.
"He specifically told me not to come to Yale" Tangtiphai
boontana said. "He was always a Stanford fan,so he encouraged
me to come here."
After she received her acceptance.Tangtiphaiboontana visit
ed the Farm and quickly realized that her other top choices.
Southern California and UCLA, were no comparison to the op
portunities presented at Stanford.
The junior is certainly taking advantage of the opportunities
here, despite the needling of her teammates.
"Oh. I definitely hear it about my name," says Tangtiphai
boontana (Tang-two-pie-boon-ta-na). "They call me tang,
pie, boon, basically every permutation of my name they can
think of."
The longest name in NCAA sports also gets her noticed on
the golf course, where she has had a successful three-year run in
the Pac-10.
"I've had announcers ask if they can just call me Jenny in
stead of Tangtiphaiboontana," she said. "At the U.S. Amateurs,
all the caddies hassled my caddie for having a huge name on
his back."
Soon, her moniker will become even longer when she adds
the title Doctor.The biology major is looking forward to medical
school with the ultimate goal of becoming a pediatrician. Still,
she isn't ready to give up on the family trade yet.
"I want to take a year off after 1 graduate, see if 1 can play in
some tournaments, or work for some sort of non-profit organiza
tion," said Tangtiphaiboontana, whose brother works for a non
profit junior golf group.
Tangtiphaiboontana recently received All-Pac-10 Honorable
Mention for the second consecutive year, capping another im
pressive season which was highlighted by a third-place finish at
the Peg Barnard Collegiate.
"I was a little surprised [to receive Honorable Mention], so
it's just a great feeling," she said. "It's nice to be rewarded, and it
reminds me that I'm really not doing that bad."
Part of her humble outlook on her game can be traced to her
brother, who still keeps a close eye on his sis from afar.
"He knows so much about the game; he is always keeping an
eye on my stats and ranking,"Tangtiphaiboontana said."He is al
ways reminding me about little things like my greens in regula
tion percentage."
Tangtiphaiboontana is scheduled to compete in the West Re
gional Championships, beginning May 11. Junior Lauren Todd,
senior Kelly Husted and freshmen Ki-Shui Liao and Mari Chun
fill out the rest of the Stanford tourney team.

Junior Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana often has announcers ask if they can call her by a dif
ferent name. The All-Pac-l 0 Honorable's teammates provide plenty of suggestions.
The Cardinal face tough opposi
tion in the three-day tournament.
Stanford is the seven-seed in a tourna
ment that features No. 2 UCLA, the

recent winner of the Pac-10 champi
onship. Also placed in the bracket is
No. 5 Georgia, as well as the Big-10
champion No. 8 Purdue. ITie tourna
ment is set to take place at the Wash
ington National Golf Club in Auburn,
Wash., May 11-13.
The team will prepare for its
biggest tournament of the year in a
unique fashion — instead of a fine

tuning their game on the Stanford
course, the women will travel to Peb
ble Beach for a practice tournament
with California.
"We were all a little surprised
when coach O'Connor told us we
would be practicing with Cal,"
Tangtiphaiboontana said. "We are
friendly and all. but when it comes
down to it, they are our bingest rivals."
