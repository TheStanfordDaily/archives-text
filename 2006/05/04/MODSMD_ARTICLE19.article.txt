### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At 9-8 in the tiebreaker of the third set against
Washington's Alex Slovic, junior James Wan was
on the verge of victory. As he ripped one of his bet
ter serves of the match, Slovic popped up the re
turn as Wan came into the net.
Slovic, ranked No. 44 in the nation, attempted a
lob over Wan's head but Wan took the overhead

and finished out the point to win Friday's quarter
final match of the Pac-10 singles draw.
"It was the best tennis I've ever seen him play
at Stanford," Coach John Whitlinger said. "He was
a warrior on the court and was prepared to play
each match. [In the spring],you've got to play pret
ty darn well to beat the guy â€” this is his time of
year."
No. 66 Wan's record reflects Whitlinger's senti
ments, as the junior is 16-2 this season in dual
matches.
Wan's performance last weekend in Ojai, Calif,
was only a sliver of the overall impressive effort
from the Stanford men's tennis team. The No. 13

Cardinal (15-3,6-1 Pac-10) claimed first and sec
ond place in the mens singles division and won the
invitational singles and doubles draws as well.
In addition to finishing runner-up for the Pac
-10 singles title, Wan partnered with senior Jon
Wong to claim the doubles crown.
Reflecting on the weekend. Wan felt that his
underdog status likely played to his advantage.
"The majority of the matches 1 played were to
people 1 was supposed to lose to so I felt no pres
sure on the court,"he said. "I just really hit my
shots."
