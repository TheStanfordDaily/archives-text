## Junior pulls through exhausting match James Wan lakes tiebreaker; finishes runner-up to Pac-10 title 
### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At 9-8 in the tiebreaker of the third set against
Washington's Alex Slovic, junior James Wan was
on the verge of victory. As he ripped one of his bet
ter serves of the match, Slovic popped up the re
turn as Wan came into the net.
Slovic, ranked No. 44 in the nation, attempted a
lob over Wan's head but Wan took the overhead

and finished out the point to win Friday's quarter
final match of the Pac-10 singles draw.
"It was the best tennis I've ever seen him play
at Stanford," Coach John Whitlinger said. "He was
a warrior on the court and was prepared to play
each match. [In the spring],you've got to play pret
ty darn well to beat the guy — this is his time of
year."
No. 66 Wan's record reflects Whitlinger's senti
ments, as the junior is 16-2 this season in dual
matches.
Wan's performance last weekend in Ojai, Calif,
was only a sliver of the overall impressive effort
from the Stanford men's tennis team. The No. 13

Cardinal (15-3,6-1 Pac-10) claimed first and sec
ond place in the mens singles division and won the
invitational singles and doubles draws as well.
In addition to finishing runner-up for the Pac
-10 singles title, Wan partnered with senior Jon
Wong to claim the doubles crown.
Reflecting on the weekend. Wan felt that his
underdog status likely played to his advantage.
"The majority of the matches 1 played were to
people 1 was supposed to lose to so I felt no pres
sure on the court,"he said. "I just really hit my
shots."
In what Whitlinger referred to as
the match of the tournament, Wan
defeated Slovic, 5-7,6-4,7-6 (8). The
junior from Stanford grabbed a cou
ple early breaks in the first set to go
up 4-1, but Slovic, a lefty, rallied back
win 7-5.
"I knew if was going to win the
match. I was going to have to make
my shots," Wan said. "So I started
going for it, and in the second set,
they started [going] in."
Wan picked up that set, 6-4. As
the third and final set began, the
Woodbury, N.Y. native found him
self leading by two breaks once
again, 4-1.
"I was actually thinking to myself,
'if I repeat [what happened in] the
first set, I'm going to kill myself,"'
Wan said.
He almost did, losing four
straight games to fall behind 4-5, and
then 5-6. But both times, Wan held
his serve and relied on his skills to
stay in the match.
"James' serve has gotten better,
and his volley is better than he thinks
it is," Whitlinger said. "His return is
one of the best in college tennis
when it's on.
Then, though, the fatigue started
to set in. With Wan up 6-5 in the
tiebreak, the pair had a marathon
rally that resulted in Slovic winning
the point, only to collapse on the
court. Finally, the tiebreak score
reached 8-all and Wan closed out the
match.
"(Against Slovic], James was just
covering the court so well, and count
er-punching," Whitlinger said. "But
he was doing more than just counter
punching, he was hitting the ball. He
was going for shots. He was trying to
figure out how to win points instead
of just hoping the other guy missed.
Wan went on to defeat teammate
KC Corkery in the semifinals on Sat
urday, 6-3.6-3. before falling to Stan
ford freshman Matt Bruch.
"Slovic was probably the hardest
match, physically," Wan recalled.
"Mentally, it was probably harder
playing KC. He's my teammate, one
of my good friends and one of my
brothers in the [SAE] house. Hon

estly, I walked into that match more
nervous about us getting into a fight
as opposed to playing the match."
After Wan's marathon match
with Slovic, the junior had to fight
cramps just five minutes before tak
ing the court with Wong.
The Stanford pair has had its
share of successes this season. In ad
dition to claiming the invitational
doubles draw in Ojai, the pair ad
vanced to the semifinals of the Pacif
ic Coast Doubles Championships in
March.The duo also won its match at
No. 3 doubles to help claim the dou
bles point and eventual victory at
then-No. 5 Illinois.
"I don't think he played a ton of
doubles growing up. but he does
some things pretty well in doubles
that I don't think he realizes he
does," Whitlinger continued. "It's
been sort of a pleasant surprise with
some of the results that [he and Jon
have] had."
Stanford hopes that the momen
tum from the Pac-10 tournament
will carry over to the NCAATourna
ment, with regional play starting on
May 13 against Quinnipiac. Confi
dent that this year's team is the best
since he's been at Stanford. Wan is
excited about the opportunity to
compete with a home-court advan
tage as the No. 13 seed — and a po
tential second-round match with
Cal.
Coming from a tennis family that
includes French Open winner
Michael Chang. Wan knew from a
young age that he wanted to play for
Stanford.
"I've wanted to come here since I
was a kid," he recalled. "Stanford's
tennis program has been legendary
for a long time now. I didn't even
know it was a great school when I
was a kid, I just knew it was No. 1 in
tennis. As soon as I came to visit, I
knew that I was going to come here."
Despite the rigors of balancing
academics with athletics. Wan says
that he still wouldn't give it up to be
a normal student.
"I've thought about it a lot," he
said.'i think it's something that goes
through every athlete's mind. But
there are just certain moments that
every athlete goes through where
you know that there's nothing else in
the world that you could be doing to
feel that way. And those are the mo
ments every athlete lives for."
