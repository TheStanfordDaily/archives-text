# TENNIS UPDATE
## Women near century mark 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
As any third grader who ever accd his geography quiz can tell
you, 100 represents perfection. And for the women's tennis
team, a seven-year chase for a perfect 100 all their own is just
weeks away from its conclusion.
Add one more achievement to the top-ranked team's ready
arsenal of intimidating numbers and statistics: Stanford has not
lost a home match since 1999.
Keep it up and home win number 100 will come at the
NCAA quarterfinal match on May 19.
Yet this record seems to mean more to the Athletic Depart
ment's PR department than to the team itself.
"What are we at now? 95?" senior co-captain Alice Barnes
asked. 96. Alice.
"Yeah, I mean that's pretty cool I suppose," Barnes said. "We
don't really think about it all, though."
"It doesn't matter so much for us because it goes back to be
fore we were here," senior Joanna Kao added. "It's not wholly
our record. And we're seniors — for the younger players, they

Senior Amber Liu and the Stanford women's tennis squad will likely reach 100 consecutive home wins this
month. Yet these women aren't even keeping count.
really haven't been so much a part
of it."
Kao makes a good point. When
the run first started, the current crop
of seniors were freshmen — in high
school.
The squad's two freshmen were
sixth graders. Heck, they were prob
ably still taking those geography
quizzes.
"Since I'm a freshman, the wins
only go back to Hawaii in January,"
said Jessica Nguyen, one of those
freshmen.
Okay, forget 100 for a moment.
These women have also won 80 con
secutive dual-match victories —
home and away — last losing in the
2003 NCAA team championship
match.
Last month, the team broke its
own record of 76 straight wins set in
1988-1991 last month. And by the
way, that streak was an NCAA
record.
Finally, a record the team will take
a little pride in.
"I'm probably not as big on the
home-wins record as on consecutive
wins," coach Lele Forood said. "That
one is much harder to do because
you're all over the place."
So what's the secret to building an

NCAA-record streak? Apparently,
it's pretending it doesn't exist— lest
you lose your concentration.
"We don't really think about our
winning streak that much," sopho
more Whitney Deason said. "It's def
initely not our focus. Our team goes
out wanting to win every match, and
the wins have piled up, but we don't
really keep tabs."
To Forood, the streaks take a
backseat come gameday. Winning is
all that matters.
"When we've had close matches
and won them, we're like 'Oh good,'
but I can't say [keeping the streak
alive] is the motivation," Forood
said. "Definitely not."
No matter what they say publicly,
surely this year's squad must feel ad
ditional pressure in a tight match
having won 80 straight.
And players say perhaps that's
one reason the team downplays its
run.
"Our team never talks about our
winning streak so I don't think about
it at all," she said. "I'm sure it's a con
scious effort on [the older players']
part."
If that's so, Barnes, the senior
leader, certainly sets an appropriate
tone.

"It just really doesn't matter to
us," she said, shaking her head em
phatically.
What does matter to the team are
NCAAs, which start at the end of
next week. For Stanford, the No. 1
seed in the field, the first round
brings Quinnipiac on May 12 at 3
p.m. With a victory, the Card will host
the No. 28 BYU/No. 38 Arizona win
ner in the second round. May 13 at 3
p.m.
As the top seed and the preselect
ed host for the NCAA Finals, Stan
ford will play its entire tournament
in the friendly confines of Taube Ten
nis Center.
Win them all, and not only does
the team shatter the impressive 1 (K)
home wins barrier — they'll also
claim a third-straight NCAA Cham
pionship.
"[The streak] is pretty cool to
think about but our biggest chal
lenge is coming up. and that is our
only concern right now," Nguyen
said.The only time it really hits me
is when 1 tell someone I'm on the
tennis team and they're like, 'Wow,
haven't you guys won like a million
matches in a row?'"
Not yet. But check back in a cou
ple more years.
