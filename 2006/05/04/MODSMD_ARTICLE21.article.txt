# Texans foul-up on biggest no-brainer
## 
### 
Welcome to the league,
rookie. In recent years
that phrase has made its
way into everyday use. But Satur
day, Reggie Bush learned what it
really meant.
As Monday's columnist Andrew
Lomeli pointed out, this year's draft
was a cruel one for nearly every
USC player selected. But it was
Reggie Bush who was in for the rud
est of awakenings.
Imagine being the most highly
touted college star since a guy
named Barry Sanders set an NCAA
scoring record at Oklahoma State.
Imagine being a running back at the
school that has churned out such
past Heisman-winning greats as
Marcus Allen and OJ Simpson.
Pretty cool company.
Imagine playing for your second
(or perhaps third, depending on
who's counting) straight national
championship.
But you lose the national title in
a classic.
No worries, right? You're still
bound for the pros, and that's
where you'll really shine. Fans of
terrible teams nationwide are pray
ing for their favored franchises to
lose even more games, just for the
shot at drafting you. And when the
Week 17 results shake out, you're
looking pretty.
Sure, theTexans are bad. But you
don't have the feeling they're
doomed to the cellar for years, un
like, say, Buffalo or San Francisco.
You've got top-notch facilities, a
modern stadium and a fan base
craving excitement — the one thing
you know you can deliver.
And then they pass on you and
guess what? Your consolation prize
is the New Orleans Saints.
Forget D'Brickashaw Ferguson.
Reggie should have been the
grown man crying his eyes out on

Saturday.
The worst part is that Reggie
Bush might never know exactly
why the Texans passed on him. By
their account, money wasn't an
issue, and it's tough to see why it
would be. Owner Boh McNair is re
puted to be one of the most free
loading in the league.
The Houston brass also claimed
it wasn't the recent off-field scandal
that could develop into the biggest
black eye a college athlete has faced
since Chris Webber and the Fab
Five nearly went to jail. That one's a
little tougher to believe, but consid
ering the fact that any conse
quences will likely hit (JSC, and not
Bush or the team that drafted him,
it is possible.
Could it really have been, as Tex
ans GM Charlie Casserly claims, a
strictly football decision?
Texans fans had better hope it
wasn't. If they chose Williams for
any other reason —be it off-field
concerns, economics or even a
magic eight ball — there's hope
that the future could lead to better
decisions when the right player isn't
so risky or expensive. Or when the
eight ball eventually gets it right.
But if their decision was moti
vated by football considerations,
this organization under its current
administration is as good as dead.
If Bush was the biggest no-brain
er in a decade, then the Texans have
shown themselves to be the fran


Denis
Griffin
Rants and Raves
chise most lacking a brain in a decade.
There were other dumb draft-day
moves, to he sure. There are every
year. Most of them we won't know
about for the next three years.
On this pick though, the backlash
was intense and immediate, just as it
should have been. Every fan of the
game, from the most respected of
pundits to the newest fan. knew that
the right pick was Bush. Well, every
one except Houston.

So Bush will play out his years in
New Orleans, with the longest-suffer
ing franchise in the NFL short of the
Cardinals (see Leinart, Matt). And
maybe if he's lucky and even better
than we think. Bush might get a
chance to change all that.
Of course, the challenges facing
Bush are: the most hated owner in
sports, a city rebuilding from one of
the greatest disasters in U.S. history
and a possibly cursed stadium built
on a Native American burial ground.
But there may be one glimmer of
hope for the most amazing college
star in years. That same cheap owner
could just decide to look for greener
pastures than New Orleans. And

what pastures are greener than the
untapped NFL market in Los Ange
les? New Orleans's loss could be Reg
gie's gain. Maybe in a few years. Bush
will be back in California and his saga
will have a happier ending.
Or maybe, for the rest of his life,
he'll be haunted by nightmares of
Paul Tagliabue walking to the podium
at Radio City Music Hall and uttering
those most dreaded of words.
"The New Orleans Saints select
Reggie Bush, running back from
Southern California."
