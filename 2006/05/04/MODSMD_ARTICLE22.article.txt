## Pac-10 play picks up with six games to go Stanford constantly playing catch up in competitive conference 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
In the decade since it became a
varsity program, Stanford softball
has established a presence on the
national scene, perennially ranked
in the top 10 and contending for
dominance in the stacked Pac-10
Conference. This year is no differ
ent.
"Our expectations are always
high," coach John Rittman said.
"The standard has been set to al
ways try to achieve our ultimate
goal of winning a national champi
onship."
But with two weeks to go in
the conference season, reality has
yet to live up to its expectations.
No. 8 Stanford sits in the middle
of the Pac-10 standings with a
record at just 7-8 in conference

and 34-12 overall.
After dropping two out of three
in Oregon last weekend, one each
against the Ducks and Beavers, the
Cardinal notched a come-from-be
hind eight-inning victory over San
Jose State on TUesday. It was Stan
ford's final non-conference
matchup — six more Pac-10 games
and the national championship are
all that remain in the 2006 season.
The Cardinal started the season
on a roll, heading into Pac-10 play
with a record of 26-4. Those four
losses came against No. 18 Baylor.
UC-Santa Barbara and twice to
No. 2 Texas.
But since the league season
began, the Cardinal have had a
harder time. Perhaps that's
no surprise in the Pac-10. Of the
eight teams in the conference, only
Oregon is not ranked in the Top 20
nationally. Defending national
champion UCLA sits atop the
polls, followed by No. 3 Arizona,
No. 5 Oregon State, No. 6 Arizona
State, Na 7 California and Stanford.
Washington checks in this week at
No. 16 in the poll to round out the
Pac-10 presence.
"Just looking at the polls will tell
you [how strong the Pac-10 is],"
Rittman said. "And there is so much
parity in the conference — anybody
can beat anybody else on a given day.
There is so much strength top to bot
tom. It is really phenomenal."
On the level playing field of the
Pac-10, Stanford has notched at least
one victory over each conference op

ponent but has swept none. If the
Card can win at least one of two
against Arizona this weekend and
one of two against UCLA next
week, they will complete the season
without sweeping or being swept.
It has not been easy, but Rittman
is pleased with his team's perform
ance.
"We are playing in the toughest
conference in the country and our
schedule can be grueling at times,"
he said. "But for the most part we
have had a successful year to this
point. We have had to deal with some
adversity and some injuries and we
have held our own really well."
The injury bug bit the Card at the
beginning of the conference season
but they have nonetheless stayed

with the Pac-10 leaders.
"A couple of people have been
pretty banged up," Rittman said.
"[Freshman pitcher] Missy (Penna]
got her thumb smashed and [sopho
more pitcher] Becky [McCullough]
has been having some arm problems.
Then there are some more chronic
things that people are playing
through. But that's not an excuse, it's
just the facts. It's not unlike any
other team in the country so we just
have to try to adapt."
Even with the sub-.500 league
record, Stanford has remained en
trenched as one of the nation's top
programs. Never once has it dropped
of the top 10.
"Defense has been our strongest
point this season," Rittman said. "We
are one of the best teams in the coun
try statistically. And in terms of hit
ting, we went into the conference
season strong, one of the strongest in
the country and I think we still are."
On offense, senior centerfielder
Catalina Morris has led the way
throughout the season. Her .377 bat
ting average is tops on the team and
the ninth highest mark in the Pac-10.
Her 58 hits on the season also lead
the Cardinal and put her fourth on
the conference list.
Freshman infielder Maddy Coon
has become Stanford's biggest slug
ger, leading the team in doubles (11,
fourth in the Pac-10), homeruns (9,
eighth) and RBI (33, eighth). Sopho
more rightfielder Anna Beardman's
five triples are the most by a Pac-10
player this season.
In the circle, Penna leads the Car
dinal with a 19-7 record and has
pitched 10 complete games. She has
struck out 154 batters en route to a
2.13 ERA. McCullough (9-4) has a
team-best 1.95 ERA and senior
Laura Severson has yet to lose a
game in seven decisions.
"When you have a freshman and
a sophomore who are pitching for
you, they are still young and learning
as they go, always trying to improve
and make adjustments," Rittman
said. "Severson as a senior has
stepped in and thrown some big in
nings for us."
The Cardinal will most likely not
repeat as conference champions, an
honor they shared with three other
teams last year, but still hope to
make a run deep into the postseason.
The 2005 team entered the NCAA
Tournament as the fourth seed and
fell to No. 11 Tennessee in the Super
Regional.
But before the Cardinal look to
ward the Women's College World
Series in June, they must close out
the conference season with a few
more wins. Six more wins, including
in the postseason, would give Stan
ford its 10th straight 40-win season.
