## Pac-10 play picks up with six games to go Stanford constantly playing catch up in competitive conference 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
In the decade since it became a
varsity program, Stanford softball
has established a presence on the
national scene, perennially ranked
in the top 10 and contending for
dominance in the stacked Pac-10
Conference. This year is no differ
ent.
"Our expectations are always
high," coach John Rittman said.
"The standard has been set to al
ways try to achieve our ultimate
goal of winning a national champi
onship."
But with two weeks to go in
the conference season, reality has
yet to live up to its expectations.
No. 8 Stanford sits in the middle
of the Pac-10 standings with a
record at just 7-8 in conference

and 34-12 overall.
After dropping two out of three
in Oregon last weekend, one each
against the Ducks and Beavers, the
Cardinal notched a come-from-be
hind eight-inning victory over San
Jose State on TUesday. It was Stan
ford's final non-conference
matchup â€” six more Pac-10 games
and the national championship are
all that remain in the 2006 season.
The Cardinal started the season
on a roll, heading into Pac-10 play
with a record of 26-4. Those four
losses came against No. 18 Baylor.
UC-Santa Barbara and twice to
No. 2 Texas.
But since the league season
began, the Cardinal have had a
harder time. Perhaps that's
no surprise in the Pac-10. Of the
eight teams in the conference, only
Oregon is not ranked in the Top 20
nationally. Defending national
champion UCLA sits atop the
polls, followed by No. 3 Arizona,
No. 5 Oregon State, No. 6 Arizona
