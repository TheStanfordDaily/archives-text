## Olympian helps win table tennis title 
### CALEY ANDERSON DESK EDITOR 
You may not realize it. hut that girl sitting next to you in
IHUM? She could be an Olympian. Though only 18 at the
time, freshman Whitney Ping still managed to make the U.S.
roster for the Athens Games — appropriately enough in
table tennis.
And after Stanford's women's table tennis team won the
NCTTA tournament from April 8-10, you can add National
Champion to Ping's resume.
Not too shabby for a player on a team in its first year of
existence.
In years past, Stanford table tennis was just a co-ed
league, and one dominated by that. But this year, their first as
a team, Stanford quickly made up for lost time.
Ping, Fong and senior Pat Leung comprise the women's
team, and they were the three that brought home the hard
ware from the NCTTA National Championships in Fort
Worth, Tex.
"We knew we could beat any team," Fong said. "But we
weren't expecting to win."
Seeded fourth, Stanford faced No. 5 seed Ohio State in
the first round, sixth-seeded Southern California in the final
four and the University of Toronto
in the finals.
As defending national champ,
host and the only school in the field
that recruits table tennis players,
top-seed Texas Wesleyan entered
the tournament a heavy favorite.
Then, though, Toronto pulled off
the biggest upset of the tournament
to catapult them to the finals. But,
unfazed, the Cardinal managed to
hold off red-hot Toronto for the title.
"We were lucky in the finals,"
Fong said.
It was a bit more than luck.
Stanford won the whole tourna
ment battling three players against
other squads' four. The women had
to forfeit a game every match, so
they were already down 0-1 before
they even lost a point.
Fong, Ping and Leung, therefore,
had to battle in every match to come
away with a 3-1 victory or pull off a
2-2 tie and force a decisive doubles
game.
In addition to playing shorthand
ed. Stanford's route to the Finals
was also more difficult than most of
their foes'. To earn a spot at nation
als, the girls had to first win region-
and the Northern California re
gion is one of the most competitive
in the nation.
But the schedule could not hold
these women down, and a victory
over California secured the Card a
finals berth.
Now, with the victory under their
belt, the girls are looking to boost
table tennis's image, both at Stan
ford and throughout the rest of the
U.S.
"Women's table tennis is an
emerging sport," Fong said. "Get
ting the college title is great because
it gives the Athletic Department an
idea we've got good players.
Women's table tennis is also trying
to become an NCAA sport, which
would definitely raise interest in it in
the U.S."
The new facilities in Ford Center
are what allowed the club team to
move from just a recreational co-ed
event to competitive teams for both
men and women. Stanford does
have a men's team, which placed
third in regionals, missing out at na
tionals.
"We really want to make people
aware that we have a facility that is
open where they can come to play,
both for the club and the team,"
Fong said. "We encourage all levels
to come out. especially if you want
to learn more about table tennis."
For now there is no formal coach,
but most members of the team said
they were eager and willing to teach
new members.
"Kyna's really the team's
coach/manager/president," said
Ping, eliciting an embarrassed glare
from Fong.
"We're still trying to figure it
out," Fong said. "We're hoping for a
formal coach."
Either way, if you join the table
tennis club, you may find yourself
being taught spin and serves by a na
tional champion — or even an
Olympian.
Open play runs Tuesdays and Thurs
days 6-8 p.m. and the squad will run
a school-wide tournament on Sun
day May 21.
