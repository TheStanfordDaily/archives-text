Stanford Israel Alliance and Hillel at Stan
ford celebrated Israeli Independence Day
with much festivity yesterday.
Approximately 2(X) students, staff and
visitors gathered in White Plaza to mark the
noontime proceedings. While many were

active in the celebration, some 25 students
associated with the Coalition for Justice in
the Middle East (CJME) and the Muslim
Student Awareness Network (MSAN)
protested the event, citing the displacement
of the Palestinian population from the re
gion.
With a number of student speakers and
singers, Israeli Independence Day provided
students with an opportunity to share their
feelings about Israel and commemorate its

creation in 1948. One of several events
scheduled during Israel Pride Week, the cel
ebration attracted many from the local Jew
ish community.
Among the student speakers was Co-
President of the Stanford Israel Alliance
Adi Jakubovits, a senior, who described her
relationship with Israel while growing up in
the United States. In an interview with The

Students dance to traditional Israeli folk music yesterday in White Plaza as part of a celebration in honor of Israel's Independence Day. In
addition to the celebrants, two student groups protested the festivities due to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine.
