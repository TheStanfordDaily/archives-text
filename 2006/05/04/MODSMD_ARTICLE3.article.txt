### AMIT ARORA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Adorning trees with Israeli flags and
providing free falafel to spectators, the
Stanford Israel Alliance and Hillel at Stan
ford celebrated Israeli Independence Day
with much festivity yesterday.
Approximately 2(X) students, staff and
visitors gathered in White Plaza to mark the
noontime proceedings. While many were

active in the celebration, some 25 students
associated with the Coalition for Justice in
the Middle East (CJME) and the Muslim
Student Awareness Network (MSAN)
protested the event, citing the displacement
of the Palestinian population from the re
gion.
With a number of student speakers and
singers, Israeli Independence Day provided
students with an opportunity to share their
feelings about Israel and commemorate its

creation in 1948. One of several events
scheduled during Israel Pride Week, the cel
ebration attracted many from the local Jew
ish community.
Among the student speakers was Co-
President of the Stanford Israel Alliance
Adi Jakubovits, a senior, who described her
relationship with Israel while growing up in
the United States. In an interview with The


SHAMS SHAIKH/The Stanford Daily
Students dance to traditional Israeli folk music yesterday in White Plaza as part of a celebration in honor of Israel's Independence Day. In
addition to the celebrants, two student groups protested the festivities due to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine.
"Most people out there don't know much about the other side of the story.
We want people to think twice before they swallow their falafel. We want
them to think twice about the over four million displaced Palestinians."

Daily, Jakubovits discussed the organization's in
terest in sponsoring the event.
"It is a tradition on campus," she said. "We do it
every year here in White Plaza. It gives the Stan
ford community the opportunity to see and hear
what Israel's contributions have been to the
world."
This year's ASSU Executive President Melanie
Kannokada, a senior, also spoke to the crowd, de
scribing her childhood in Chicago and relating her
experience with Jewish Americans.
After several short speeches, four students per
formed a traditional Israeli dance, and audience
members soon joined in.
Meanwhile, students from the CJME and
MSAN stood between the Quad and White Plaza
with pictures and banners documenting the dis
placement of the Palestinian population from the
Israeli state. The students remained quiet and re
spectful of the celebration but did distribute fliers
regarding the refugee situation and Israeli human
rights violations.
Two University security officials were also
present and stood directly between the group of
protesters and the celebration.
In an interview with The Daily,Tanya Haj-Has
san. a senior, shared her reasons for protesting the
event.
"Most people out there don't know much
about the other side of the story," she said. "We
want people to think twice before they swallow
their falafel. We want them to think twice about
the over four million displaced Palestinians."
Haj-Hassan also described the need for in
creased awareness about the Palestinian condi
tion.
"This is a tragic day for millions of Palestini
ans," she said. "While Israelis are celebrating, the
suffering from 1948 still continues."
Fellow protester Ali Faghfuri, a graduate stu
dent in electrical engineering, echoed these con
cerns.
"They are having a celebration over there," he
said. "Every history has two sides. There are a lot

of problems in the conflict that they should be
talking about."
While the group of protesters pushed for in
creased recognition of the human rights violations
involving Palestinian displacement, many cele
brating Israeli Independence Day described their
awareness of the crisis. Jakubovits expressed un
derstanding of the protesters' claims.
"I think we have always been good about hav
ing conversations and engaging in dialogue," she
said. "It doesn't really bother me that they're
protesting. It's actually part of the tragedy of the
situation, in that protest is needed."
Roosevelt Institution President Kai Stinch
combe, a graduate student in political science,
voiced a similar opinion. While enjoying the cele
bration, Stinchcombe described the necessity of
protest.
"I agree with most of the Israeli public when 1
say that there are things that the Israeli govern
ment could be doing that it's not doing." he said."lf
you're not protesting, you're not paying attention.
On the fourth of July, I am proud to be an Ameri
can, but I don't agree with everything America is
doing. Israeli Independence Day gives us a chance
to think about the values on which Israel was
founded and what those values mean in the world
today."
Some students, however, found the protest ill
timed. Dan Kaganovich, a doctoral student in bio
logical sciences, criticized the decision to hold a
demonstration on Israeli Independence Day.
"I think it's very inappropriate," he said. "I

think it's indicative of the people who are protest
ing. They define their movement in opposition to
something. I see them only when they protest Is
rael's independence."
While a few students were critical of the
protest, most recognized the complaints and ap
preciated the manner in which they were deliv
ered. Joseph Haimovich, a professor of immunol
ogy at Tel Aviv University, attended the celebra
tion and described his reaction to the protest.
"It's okay the way they protest quietly," he
said. "I would do if there were some sort of cele
bration I disagreed with. I would protest, for ex
ample, nuclear weapons in Iran on Iran's Inde
pendence Day. I agree with quiet and peaceful
protest."
Executive Director of Hillel Adina Danzig sim
ilarly stressed the importance of peaceful dialogue
and discussion.
"Having been at Stanford for a number of
years, 1 am pleased with what I perceive as improv
ing relations between the Muslim and Jewish com
munities on campus," she said. "Last year, leader
ship of the two communities began a dialogue
about how each community can continue to bring
programs and events to campus while we open up
the lines of communication. It is important that we
treat one another with respect and dignity as mem
bers of the same campus community."
Israeli Pride Week will continue through Satur
day with events at the Ziff Center for Jewish Cam
pus Life and an Israel disco party over the week
end.
