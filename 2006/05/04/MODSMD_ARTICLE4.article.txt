## Graduation pledge at risk this year Oath urges grads to consider social, environmental issues 
### KAITLIN WOOD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Each June, graduating seniors across the na
tion sign the Graduation Pledge of Social and
Environmental Responsibility, but this year's
Stanford graduates will likely miss out on the
opportunity.
The voluntary pledge encourages students to
make more socially-responsible decisions in the
working world, which will ultimately lead to the
betterment of the globe at large.
"I pledge to explore and take into account
the social and environmental consequences of
any job I consider and will try to improve these
aspects of any organizations for which I work,"
it states.
As Stanford's Commencement ceremonies
approach, however, no student group has volun
teered to support the pledge. Students for a Sus
tainable Stanford, an environmental group that
has supported the pledge in the past, has other
projects this year that prevent the organization
from being able to devote the time and re
sources necessary to promote it.
Matt Nicodemus, Class of 1986, recently
wrote to ASSU representatives and undergrad
uate class presidents to emphasize the pledge's
importance.
"Consider placing the ASSU squarely be
hind the Graduation Pledge, serving as a focal
point for student involvement with the pledge
this spring, publicizing the pledge option before
June Commencement and supporting the ef
forts of future Stanford pledge promoters to
make the University both a place where ques
tions of social and environmental responsibility
are more regularly addressed and a leader in the
growing network of schools with pledge pro
grams," he wrote.
Nicodemus co-authored the orig
inal pledge and helped form the
Graduation Pledge Alliance, which
has popularized the pledge at col
leges and universities across the
country.
While many student organiza
tions and members of the Stanford
community — including President
John Hennessy — support the
pledge, there remains no student or
ganization willing to endorse the
cause.
The ASSU has currently made
no formal endorsement either,
though Paris Mohiuddin, a junior
and one of next year's senior class
presidents, said he was supportive of
the idea of the ASSU backing the
annual oath.
"1 will certainly bring up the idea
to the rest of the slate to see if it's
something they want to really push
for," he said.
While the pledge has yet to find a
sponsor, there are still six weeks left
for a group to step up.
In the meantime, Mohiuddin said
he agrees with the pledge in princi
ple.
"Few people would really argue
against the goals of the pledge —
they're things that most anyone
would ideally achieve," he said.
"Even if the pledge has no verifica
tion method, I do believe the act of
consciously signing onto the pledge
prior to leaving Stanford is better
than nothing."
