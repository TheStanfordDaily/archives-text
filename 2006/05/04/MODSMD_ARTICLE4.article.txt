## Graduation pledge at risk this year Oath urges grads to consider social, environmental issues 
### KAITLIN WOOD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Each June, graduating seniors across the na
tion sign the Graduation Pledge of Social and
Environmental Responsibility, but this year's
Stanford graduates will likely miss out on the
opportunity.
The voluntary pledge encourages students to
make more socially-responsible decisions in the
working world, which will ultimately lead to the
betterment of the globe at large.
"I pledge to explore and take into account
the social and environmental consequences of
any job I consider and will try to improve these
aspects of any organizations for which I work,"
it states.
As Stanford's Commencement ceremonies
approach, however, no student group has volun
teered to support the pledge. Students for a Sus
tainable Stanford, an environmental group that
has supported the pledge in the past, has other
projects this year that prevent the organization
from being able to devote the time and re
sources necessary to promote it.
Matt Nicodemus, Class of 1986, recently
wrote to ASSU representatives and undergrad
uate class presidents to emphasize the pledge's
importance.
"Consider placing the ASSU squarely be
hind the Graduation Pledge, serving as a focal
point for student involvement with the pledge
this spring, publicizing the pledge option before
June Commencement and supporting the ef
forts of future Stanford pledge promoters to
make the University both a place where ques
tions of social and environmental responsibility
are more regularly addressed and a leader in the
growing network of schools with pledge pro
grams," he wrote.
