# STUDENT HOUSING
## Stern doubles to become singles 26 rooms in Casa Zapata and Serra will be converted into singles next year 
### BEN EPPLER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The ongoing construction of the Munger Graduate
Residences directly behind Stern Hall has brought 8 a.m.
noise to residences in Stern and on the Row, the loss of
choice parking spaces, "eyesore" fences and the reloca
tion of important student services such as the Bridge
Counseling Center and the Campus Bike Shop. For lucky
upperclassmen living in Serra and Casa Zapata next year,
however, the construction will convert 26 double-occu
pant rooms in each dorm into singles.
The rooms that will be converted face out the back of

the Stern complex, directly toward the construction.
Rooms across the hall, facing away from the construction,
will remain doubles, but will be occupied by freshmen. All
upperclassmen in Serra and Zapata will live in singles.
Not surprisingly, demand for these singles is expected
to be high, much greater than normal for Stern, which
usually accommodates anyone who draws alone.
In Zapata, the Latino theme dorm, students can apply
for priority to get in to the house regardless of their Draw
number. However, all spots not reserved for freshmen are
already filled. Ethnic Theme Associate Bernard Fraga, a
sophomore, told The Daily.
"We found the interest by the student population was
incredible," Fraga said. "In fact, we received three times
more applications than spots available. This is the first
time Zapata will be completely filled with priority appli-

Rooms in Casa Zapata and Serra that face toward the Munger construction will become singles next year. All the affected
rooms in Zapata have already been filled by students who applied for priority housing in the Latino theme dorm.
cants, frosh and staff."
Fraga said that the news that all
upperclassmen would receive sin
gles contributed to the volume of
applications.
Students applying for priority
had to write a theme essay express
ing their interest in Latino culture
and language.
In Serra, where all upperclass
men will be assigned normally via
the Draw, Executive Director of
Housing Services Rodger Whitney
said he expects to see the residence
rise in applicants' preferences.
"More upperclassmen may se
lect this location as one of their

preferences due to the increased
number of singles," he said.
However, the noise generated
by the construction will last all year
and should not be discounted,
Whitney cautioned.
"The construction noise factor
also needs to be considered as a
mitigating factor for some stu
dents, even in a single room." he
said.
Fifty-two students that would
have lived in converted doubles in
Serra and Zapata will live in other
residences. Whitney does not antic
ipate problems housing the dis
placed students.
"We generally have a large
number of autumn quarter vacan
cies, and we will simply not have
them next year," he said. "In other
words, rather than operate with va
cancies, the housing system will be

closer to full throughout the year
as it absorbs these students from
Stern around the system."
If there is a housing crunch.
Whitney predicted it will most like
ly occur during winter quarter,
when the fewest undergraduates
are abroad.
"But we do not anticipate a
problem at this point," he said.
Because of the Munger project's
long-term impact on students' lives
and sleeping schedules, Whitney
said that Housing Services arrived
at the double-to-single conversion
solution after consultation with
student groups, staff and resident
fellows in the two dorms.
He noted that windows in the
new singles will be upgraded from
single to double panes over the
summer for "noise mitigation."
Although the construction noise

will be inconvenient for upper
classmen residents in Zapata and
Serra, Fraga said he felt that the
change will be beneficial.
"I feel the single will be worth
the noise, as Zapata has worked
hard to create new, quiet study
spaces away from the construc
tion," he said.
Judging from the number of pri
ority applications Zapata received
last week, many students share
Fraga's sentiments.
The Munger Project is a two
year endeavor that began in Febru
ary and is expected to be complet
ed by spring 2008. The centerpiece
of the project is the construction of
a graduate residence complex ca
pable of housing 600 students. The
plan also calls for the construction
of a four-level subterranean park
ing garage beneath Wilbur Field.
