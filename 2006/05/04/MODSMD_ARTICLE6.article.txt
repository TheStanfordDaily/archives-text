## UC-Berkeley takes home 'Great Debate' 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
In last night's eighth annual Great Debate, the only
head-to-head competition between Stanford and UC-
Berkeley debaters, the Cal team edged the Stanford
squad by a 2-1 vote. Their victory knots the all-time se
ries in a 4-4 tie.
ITiis year's topic, chosen by a panel associated with
teams from both schools, read: "Resolved: That the
United States federal government should substantially

increase reliance on
nuclear energy for
production of elec
tricity in the United
States."
Berkeley argued
the affirmative side,
while Stanford took
the negative stance.
The debate for
mat was three-on
three, with alternat
ing affirmative and
negative speeches
and cross-examina
tions. Toward the
end of the debate,
team members re
sponded to ques
tions posed by the
panel of judges.

"The primary reason
that we have this is to
entertain and spread
awareness about
debate, and I think
both sides would agree
that that was ultimately
accomplished."
FARIS MOHIUDDIN,
junior debate team member

ior Faris Mohiuddin comprised the Stanford team.The
Cal debaters were seniors Craig Wickersham and Nick
Lin, as well as junior Mike Burshteyn.
The event was coordinated by Stanford sopho
mores Sarah Victor and Michael Baer.
The judging panel included Herbert Silber, a nu
clear scientist from San Jose State's Chemistry Depart
ment; Prof. Kimo Ah Yun, of the Department of Com
munication Studies at CSU-Sacramento; and Sean
Snaith, associate professor of economics at the Univer-
sity of the Pacific.
Snaith served as the chair of the
panel and sided with Stanford —
casting the debate's sole dissenting
vote.
In their speeches, the Berkeley
team members highlighted the vari
ous environmental and economic
benefits of using nuclear power,
dubbed "the perfect technology" by
Wickersham.
"It is time for the United States to
bust all the myths [about the dangers
of nuclear energy] because nuclear
power is the way to go," Lin said.
The Stanford debaters, mean
while, emphasized alternative ener
gy sources, including wind and solar
power.
"Every dollar spent on nuclear
energy could be better spent on
more feasible alternatives," Mohi
uddin said.
Chan addressed the dangers of
proliferation and technology that
could arise, and Sandberg pointed to
the safety and environmental
threats posed by increased nuclear
reliance.
"When was the last time a wind
mill gave someone cancer?" he
asked. "Nuclear power is not a neces
sity— it's a choice, and it's a bad
choice."
Judges commended both teams
at the debate's conclusion.
"This was a very, very difficult de
cision," Silber said. "If I could have
voted for a tie, I would have. Both
sides are to be congratulated."
"The debate this year was very
close, and the split decision definite
ly illustrates that," Wickersham said
after the event. "I'm excited that we

won. obviously, because we are ri
vals, but I think Stanford did a real
ly good job in this debate."
According to Victor, the Stanford
team prepared by researching relat
ed topics, including the position of
the other side. In addition, the team
of three practiced debating against
other Stanford team members who
had researched Berkeley's position.
Freshman KiatChuan Tan, who
attended the debate, said he did not
think the Berkeley team's case was
organized very well.
"I think both teams made some
mistakes, but in general I thought
the Stanford debaters were a lot bet
ter," he said.
"1 think some of members of the
panel were predisposed against our
side, particularly the nuclear scien
tist," Mark Linsey, a junior, said.
"That's not insurmountable, but it's
hard to predict from year from
year."
"The problem with this debate is
that you never know what the
judges are going to vote on," Chan
said. "We thought we did a better
job on the board."
Mohiuddin also commented on
the result of the debate.
"Although we would have pre
ferred the outcome to be different,
the primary reason that we have this
is to entertain and spread awareness
about debate, and I think both sides
would agree that that was ultimate
ly accomplished," he said.
"The fact that we at least made it
moderately entertaining, we hope,
to the other people, I think, as cliche
as it sounds, is a victory for all," he
added. "Apparently, more so for
them than for us, but that's okay. I
think we did everything that we set
out to do, short of the outcome, and
in the end, that's everything that we
have control over, so we can't expect
anything else."
