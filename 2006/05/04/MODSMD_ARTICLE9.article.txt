## A
						world of standing room only? 
### 
A lot of metaphors have been
used to describe our country
— an eagle, a melting pot, a
mosaic. 1 want to propose a new one:
an airplane.
The New York Times recently re
ported that airlines are going to new
extremes to squish more passengers
into "economy." First came plans for
many airlines to reduce the thick
ness of their seats to fit in more rows.
Now, The Times reports that Airbus
is trying to talk airlines into in
stalling standing-room only "seats"
at the back of the plane.
According to the article, "Passen
gers in the standing section would be
propped against a padded backboard,
held in place with a harness." In first
class, seats are getting so comfortable,
passengers can push their seats com
pletely horizontal while sleeping.
It almost seems like a joke.
Stay with me here. In Washington,
House Republicans are trying to pass
an immigration bill that would make it
a felony not only to be in this country
illegally, but also to help someone who
is. The "softer" Senate proposal would
implement a guest-worker program
that would allow illegal aliens to stay
in the country to work — but without
the benefits of citizenship.
Yesterday, President Bush an
nounced that the tax cuts — primarily
benefiting the wealthiest Americans
— should be made permanent. This,
despite an enormous budget deficit
and a bill passed by congressional Re
publicans last December slashing $13
billion in spending for college aid.
Even on campus I see this effect:
some of my friends drive fancy cars
and can afford to go out to nice restau
rants several nights a week; others
struggle to fit in as many as 20 hours of
work a week while having to prioritize
their remaining time to make room
for papers and tests. The former have
plenty of time to go to a talk by a
world-renowned guest lecturer, can
afford the additional costs associated
with going abroad, and pay for every
advantage — a wireless laptop, a cell
phone, a nice car — to facilitate their
life as students. Let's not even talk
about the trips toTahoe for ski week
ends or Cabo for spring break.
It's hard to stomach watching
spoiled rotten children on MTV's
"My Super Sweet Sixteen" whine
about their $150,000 birthday par
ties when 46 million Americans can't
even afford health insurance.
The final straw? Lee Raymond,
the recently-retired chairman and
chief executive of Exxon, was paid
more than $686 million for his 12
years of work at the company — or
$144,573 a day. That $686 million
would buy $4,000 Pell Grants for
171,500 college students — the
equivalent of 24 undergraduate stu
dent bodies the size of Stanford's.
I have a hard time believing these
are all coincidences. Our country
seems to be flying in a direction that
benefits the few at the expense of the
many. I'm not a liberal pinko commie
— far from it. But it worries me that
as middle-class America takes out
second mortgages, the economic
elite are buying second homes.
Our American airline seems to be
pushing more and more people into
tinier seats while making life cushier
and cushier for the lucky few up
front. Worse, we're considering creat
ing standing room only. Sure you can
get on the plane, but don't expect a
drink or a pack of peanuts, let alone a
seat. And of course, those piloting
our airline aren't too concerned
about anyone not stretching out in
first class.
I'm not going to pretend I have a
perfect solution. But it saddens me
that our society has lost its sense of
enlightened self interest, knowing
that taking care of the worst-off, even
at the expense of a little conspicuous
consumption, makes our society as a
whole better-off.
At the very least, we can start by
halting plans for implementing
standing room only — both for
American Airlines and for our Amer
ican airline.
