# The
						fuzzy menace
## Record caterpillar population riles students 
### ANDREA FULLER STAFF WRITER 
Though the squirrels have long kept their title as Stan
ford's most infamous furry animal, a new fuzzy menace
has appeared as prime challenger â€” the caterpillar. Ac
cording to grounds keeping officials, Stanford's caterpil
lar presence has reached an unusual height this year.
"There are a lot more this year than there have been
in the last eight years," said Bruce Aizawa, a grounds su
pervisor for Facilities Operations. "They're cyclical, their
life cycles. No one really knows what affects that cycle."
Karen Stidd, horticultural support supervisor for Fa
cilities Operations, said that natural cycles usually keep
the caterpillars in check.
"Usually in the natural environment there are plenty
of naturally occurring predators and parasites that keep
them in check,"she said."For some reason, there is an un
usually high outbreak this year on the campus, and we
aren't sure why.
"There are natural cycles in insect populations, and
this may be the main reason," she added. "Another possi
bility is that all the construction on campus has caused
populations of natural controls, such as birds and benefi
cial insects, to decline."
The creatures seen around campus are larvae that will
eventually become moths, most commonly the tussock
moth. Their eggs hatch in February, when they move to
trees to find food. Soon, the caterpillars will form cocoons
and are expected to hatch by June.

On a weekly basis, employees have been monitoring
oak trees, the most common habitat for these particular
caterpillars. However, employees said they not support
taking chemical action against the insects.
"Our philosophy here is not to use harmful pesticides
for a couple of reasons," Aizawa said. "We don't want to
put those into the environment and the types available
will also kill any beneficial insects that will help us with
this problem. We'll only address specific issues as they
come up."
Manager of Facilities Operations Herbert Fong said
that a number of people have expressed concern about
the caterpillar presence, and that the University is using
alternative options to pesticide.
"[We've received] several complaints and we have
been monitoring and working to remove them from
structures when they migrate onto buildings and trees
trunks to pupate," said Fong. "We have practiced an inte
grated pest management program on campus for over
twelve years,during which we do not apply pesticides but
rather use alternative measures such as washing off and
reducing egg masses."
The University plans to destroy the cocoons before
they hatch, workers said.
"What we try to do afterward, when they're in their
cocoon stage in the winter is we try to power wash them
off with a hose," Aizawa said. "By doing this, we've killed
them and they won't be able to go into the moth stage."

Both students and University Facilities Operations alike have struggled with what exactly to do with The Farm's seemingly
overwhelming population of caterpillars.
