# The 						fuzzy menace
## Record caterpillar population riles students 
### ANDREA FULLER STAFF WRITER 
Though the squirrels have long kept their title as Stan
ford's most infamous furry animal, a new fuzzy menace
has appeared as prime challenger — the caterpillar. Ac
cording to grounds keeping officials, Stanford's caterpil
lar presence has reached an unusual height this year.
"There are a lot more this year than there have been
in the last eight years," said Bruce Aizawa, a grounds su
pervisor for Facilities Operations. "They're cyclical, their
life cycles. No one really knows what affects that cycle."
Karen Stidd, horticultural support supervisor for Fa
cilities Operations, said that natural cycles usually keep
the caterpillars in check.
"Usually in the natural environment there are plenty
of naturally occurring predators and parasites that keep
them in check,"she said."For some reason, there is an un
usually high outbreak this year on the campus, and we
aren't sure why.
"There are natural cycles in insect populations, and
this may be the main reason," she added. "Another possi
bility is that all the construction on campus has caused
populations of natural controls, such as birds and benefi
cial insects, to decline."
The creatures seen around campus are larvae that will
eventually become moths, most commonly the tussock
moth. Their eggs hatch in February, when they move to
trees to find food. Soon, the caterpillars will form cocoons
and are expected to hatch by June.

On a weekly basis, employees have been monitoring
oak trees, the most common habitat for these particular
caterpillars. However, employees said they not support
taking chemical action against the insects.
"Our philosophy here is not to use harmful pesticides
for a couple of reasons," Aizawa said. "We don't want to
put those into the environment and the types available
will also kill any beneficial insects that will help us with
this problem. We'll only address specific issues as they
come up."
Manager of Facilities Operations Herbert Fong said
that a number of people have expressed concern about
the caterpillar presence, and that the University is using
alternative options to pesticide.
"[We've received] several complaints and we have
been monitoring and working to remove them from
structures when they migrate onto buildings and trees
trunks to pupate," said Fong. "We have practiced an inte
grated pest management program on campus for over
twelve years,during which we do not apply pesticides but
rather use alternative measures such as washing off and
reducing egg masses."
The University plans to destroy the cocoons before
they hatch, workers said.
"What we try to do afterward, when they're in their
cocoon stage in the winter is we try to power wash them
off with a hose," Aizawa said. "By doing this, we've killed
them and they won't be able to go into the moth stage."

Both students and University Facilities Operations alike have struggled with what exactly to do with The Farm's seemingly
overwhelming population of caterpillars.
Stidd said that soon, the caterpil
lars will no longer be a problem.
"The good news is that the cater
pillars are beginning to pupate," she
said. "In a few weeks they will be
gone. Moths will emerge from the co
coons and lay eggs which will not
hatch until next spring."
Students have largely expressed
overwhelming disgust with the cater
pillars on campus, noting that the
problem is especially conspicuous
this year.
"This is my senior year, and the
caterpillars have never been this
bad," said David Lofton. "I had been
getting annoyed about running into
them around campus on my way to
class, but the last straw was when I saw
one crawling up my wall in my off
campus apartment, about two hours
after I had gotten home. I try to stomp
on as many as I can, because there are
so many this year."
A number of students have even cre
ated Facebook groups to express their
disdain for the insects. Freshman Ryan
Noon said that he created his group be
cause of a series of unfortunate person
al experiences with the caterpillars.
"I understand they're necessary
for our amazing northern California
forest ecosystem, but if you get in my
hair and you're going to become a
moth, then don't expect warm rela
tions with me," he said."l think we can
respect these caterpillars' right to live,
while at the same time cursing their
existence in a public forum. Pretty
much the worst experience of my life
was biking around and having a cater
pillar go in my mouth when I wasn't
looking."
Freshman Betty Pham said that
she started her group because of the
impossibility to go near trees without
being attacked by caterpillars.
"I started the group after I got
caterpillared from above for the third
time," she said. "It was a beautiful day,
and I had been biking merrily along
after a great chem lecture when disas
ter struck — I ran into one of the hairy
Stanford tree ornaments. In class, the
TA in front of me had two crawling
around on his collar, and after I ran
into one, that was the last straw."
Other students, however, felt that
the growth in anti-caterpillar Face
book groups was excessive.
"I don't see why it's such a big deal
and why all of these Stanford kids are
so afraid of the natural world," said
freshman Alex Coley, creator of a
rival "Save the Caterpillars!" group.
"We pride ourselves in environmen
tal consciousness and progressive
green technology but apparently
most of the student body is afraid of
the natural things around us. Are you
serious — Stanford isn't that much of
a bubble is it?"

Freshman Javier Oliver said that
he didn't like the caterpillars, which
he referred to as "stealth ninjas," but
felt that students should just wait out
their presence.

"They are annoying, but they are
also part of nature," he said. "Just be
cause we sit on them and they get on
our clothes doesn't mean Grounds
Services needs to exterminate them.
They're not poisonous, they don't
bite, in fact, they are kind of cool look
ing. They'll be gone on their own soon
enough."

twelve years,during which we do not apply pesticides but
rather use alternative measures such as washing off and
reducing egg masses."
The University plans to destroy the cocoons before
they hatch, workers said.
"What we try to do afterward, when they're in their
cocoon stage in the winter is we try to power wash them
off with a hose," Aizawa said. "By doing this, we've killed
them and they won't be able to go into the moth stage."

Both students and University Facilities Operations alike have struggled with what exactly to do with The Farm's seemingly
overwhelming population of caterpillars.
Stidd said that soon, the caterpil
lars will no longer be a problem.
"The good news is that the cater
pillars are beginning to pupate," she
said. "In a few weeks they will be
gone. Moths will emerge from the co
coons and lay eggs which will not
hatch until next spring."
Students have largely expressed
overwhelming disgust with the cater
pillars on campus, noting that the
problem is especially conspicuous
this year.
"This is my senior year, and the
caterpillars have never been this
bad," said David Lofton. "I had been
getting annoyed about running into
them around campus on my way to
class, but the last straw was when I saw
one crawling up my wall in my off
campus apartment, about two hours
after I had gotten home. I try to stomp
on as many as I can, because there are
so many this year."
A number of students have even cre
ated Facebook groups to express their
disdain for the insects. Freshman Ryan
Noon said that he created his group be
cause of a series of unfortunate person
al experiences with the caterpillars.
"I understand they're necessary
for our amazing northern California
forest ecosystem, but if you get in my
hair and you're going to become a
moth, then don't expect warm rela
tions with me," he said."l think we can
respect these caterpillars' right to live,
while at the same time cursing their
existence in a public forum. Pretty
much the worst experience of my life
was biking around and having a cater
pillar go in my mouth when I wasn't
looking."
Freshman Betty Pham said that
she started her group because of the
impossibility to go near trees without
being attacked by caterpillars.
"I started the group after I got
caterpillared from above for the third
time," she said. "It was a beautiful day,
and I had been biking merrily along
after a great chem lecture when disas
ter struck — I ran into one of the hairy
Stanford tree ornaments. In class, the
TA in front of me had two crawling
around on his collar, and after I ran
into one, that was the last straw."
Other students, however, felt that
the growth in anti-caterpillar Face
book groups was excessive.
"I don't see why it's such a big deal
and why all of these Stanford kids are
so afraid of the natural world," said
freshman Alex Coley, creator of a
rival "Save the Caterpillars!" group.
"We pride ourselves in environmen
tal consciousness and progressive
green technology but apparently
most of the student body is afraid of
the natural things around us. Are you
serious — Stanford isn't that much of
a bubble is it?"

Freshman Javier Oliver said that
he didn't like the caterpillars, which
he referred to as "stealth ninjas," but
felt that students should just wait out
their presence.

"They are annoying, but they are
also part of nature," he said. "Just be
cause we sit on them and they get on
our clothes doesn't mean Grounds
Services needs to exterminate them.
They're not poisonous, they don't
bite, in fact, they are kind of cool look
ing. They'll be gone on their own soon
enough."
