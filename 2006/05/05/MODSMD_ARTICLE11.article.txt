## Editorial Cardinal must continue to attract top talent 
### 
The Stanford athlete is an oft maligned
creature. Sure, they get more than
their fair share of fame and glamour.
But at the same time, athletes here are
blamed for sporting defeats, ridiculed at Gai
eties and ostracized in 1-Hum sections. What
gives?
When thinking about the state of athlet
ics in this University, it is often easy to over
look the fact that our great athletics program
exists in harmony with impeccable academ
ic standards.
Athletes are subjected to the same aca
demic rigor as their peers; muscle tone and
motor coordination count for little in Stan
ford's halls of learning. Unlike other schools,
which may lower their admissions standards
for rising athletic stars, Stanford makes the
same intellectual demands on all its students,
athlete or not.
Athletics contribute to the school in ways
that often go unnoticed. Our sports teams
serve as a huge source of school spirit, even
in spite of the fact that we haven't won Big
Game in a while. Visitors to the school —
and some graduate students who earned
their undergraduate degrees elsewhere —
often comment on how much attention is
paid to sports here at Stanford. This fact is
clear even in the pages of The Daily, where a
large portion of newsprint is devoted to
sports coverage.
More noticeably, athletics also serve as a
significant source of income for the school. It
is to the Athletics Department's credit that it
is able to find its independent funding for its
own scholarships. The campus sports scene
also attracts donations from alumni mem
bers, whether directly or indirectly — the
spanking new Arrillaga Center for Sports
and Recreation is proof of this.

While it may be fashionable to bash the
athletically inclined among us, we ought to
reflect more seriously on their dedication
and commitment. Many of them get up early
each day to start their training. Their packed
schedules and traveling commitments often
intrude upon their personal lives. Some
times, they might find it hard to devote as
much time as they might like to on their
schoolwork — even though many of them
apply their sense of discipline equally to ath
letics and academics Few of us non-athletes
realize that being an athlete is similar to a
full-time job
Then again, excellence in any field makes
tremendous demands on its practitioners.
Prodigious musicians have to spend just as
much time practicing their instruments, just
as prolific writers spend hours honing their
craft. Members of amateur performance
groups on campus devote a lot of time and
energy to their respective activities. Would
Stanford make certain exceptions for a tal
ented cellist as it would for a promising foot
ball player? Would the community provide
as much institutional support for an a cap
pella group as it would a varsity team?
Nevertheless, we feel that it is important
for the University to continue to support our
athletics programs while maintaining high
standards of academic rigor. We believe that
Stanford offers a dynamic experience —
both intellectually and athletically — that
can continue to attract the best and the
brightest in the sporting field.
Meanwhile, while reflecting on how ath
letics contribute to the University's larger
goals, we can also think clearly about how
each of our individual contributions add to
the overall Stanford experience, instead of
labeling each other as jocks and geeks.
