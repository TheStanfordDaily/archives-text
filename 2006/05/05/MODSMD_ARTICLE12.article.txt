# Tomfoolery: Fame and the Public
## 
### 
Does this sound familiar? "I'm really
excited for Mission: Impossible 111,
despite Tom Cruise being in it."
Poor Tom. He might make $20 million per
picture and be one of Hollywood's few re
maining certifiable action stars, but some
time over the last year the public decided he
was just certifiable.
His list of transgressions is borderline in
nocuous. Sure, he denounced pharmaceuti
cals and acted foolishly on Oprah, but so did
James Frey. He got Katie Holmes pregnant
and verbally abused a heckler — two items
on my List of Things To Do Before I Die. He
practices Scientology, a religion that believes
Man is descended from the Clams and that
all our problems stem from two battling
"hinges," one yearning to be open, the other
striving to close. Admittedly strange. But
Christians believe that two navel-less nudes
sprang into being at the beginning of Time.
Who are we to judge?
We know about his religion, his relation
ships and his work. In Tom Cruise, the de
marcation line between public and private
personas has eroded: a real-life embodiment
of a Philip K. Dick novel. We the Enquiring
Public have watched him since "Risky Busi
ness." We speculated on his sexuality and de
manded to know his vacationing spots and
the names of his children. For decades he re
sisted. but over the last year, it seems, the
weaker hinge finally gave in.Tom Cruise has
offered himself to us.
We created this monster. And now, like
Dr. Frankenstein before us, we deny our un
gainly offspring. We accuse him of psychosis.
During our years of Tom Worship, what
were we asking for if not an endless string of
amusing charades by one of the world's most
recognizable faces? We don't want happy
marriages and choreographed talk show ap
pearances. If Brangelina — all the rage at
the moment — were to marry, buy a big
house in Malibu and raise three well-adjust
ed Cambodian refugee orphans, they'd
quickly fade from the public eye. No, we
want a movie star that performs not just on
screen, but all the time. A larger-than-life

being of unpredictable energy, willed into
existence by the all-seeing Public Eye.
Tom Cruise has consented. He has be
come our 24-hour movie star. All the world
is his stage, and he struts it for our benefit.
Histrionics about Holmes, fist-pumping dec
larations of love, white-toothed smiles for
the ever-present paparazzi. And the thanks
we give him? Video mock-ups on
youtube.com portraying TC as Emperor
Palpatine, electrifying Oprah. Squirting
flowers from a red carpet ruffian, directed at
Tom's face. Defamation of his religion. We
should be ashamed of ourselves.
There are alternatives to Tom Cruise
style celebrity. What if every star emulated
do-gooder George Clooney, who champi
oned Hollywood in his Oscar acceptance
speech: "We're the ones who talked about
AIDS when it was just being whispered, and
we talked about civil rights when it wasn't
really popular. We're the ones that donate
our fabulous fur coats to warm the bodies of
oil-covered seals, and we flew our private
airplanes into Afghani caves and personally
bit bin Laden's ring finger off. What have
you done today?"
Then he spat in the direction of the tele
vision audience and went home to have sex
with supermodels in a multi-mirrored wing
of his Beverly Hills mansion.
We the Enquiring Public judge the do
gooders as harshly as the ne'er-do-wells.
Fame is a fickle lover in our era.
Me? I'll take semi-sanity over smugness
any day.
