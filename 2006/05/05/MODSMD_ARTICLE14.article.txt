# The 						seven habits of highly successful grad students
## 
### 
When you first arrive in graduate
school, it's all about the work. The
dream of scholastic glory is still
alive, so you're ready to focus on your studies
and finally become the expert on the sexual
fantasies of 17th century Russian peasants
that you've always wanted to be.
For those of us who are commencing the
long, arduous trek to a doctorate — and all
the respect it commands — we know why
we're here. We are here to immerse ourselves
in knowledge. To bathe in obscure facts until
their musty odor suffuses our ever-so slightly
ill-fitting clothes.
The ill-fitting clothes are, of course, the
natural corollary to such youthful obsessions
with work. We arrive having rejected the
strictures of convention (good dress-sense,
happiness,success,etc.) in order to more fully
embrace the joys of learning.
To fully immerse oneself in academic
struggle, one has to sacrifice certain things;
for example, dignity and self-respect.
This is not quite the price it seems; after
all, if everything goes according to plan, glory
(of a sort) awaits you at the end. Which is to
say that if you put in the time, a lifetime of
success is within your grasp, or something
like that.
Unfortunately, it's all a lie. No one bothers
to point out that, actually, very few of us
achieve what we set out to. A willingness to
give up the instant gratification of living
above the poverty line is not enough. (Yes,
yes I know we don't really live below the
poverty line, but given I can no longer afford
to pay the masseuse for the happy ending, I

feel impoverished.)
In all probability, whatever your goals are,
whatever you hope to leverage your P and h
and D into, it ain't gonna happen.
Eventually the realization of this deep
truth will hit. Typically, this takes place after
you've invested slightly too much time to
consciously acknowledge what a terrible mis
take you've made. So instead, we embrace
sophistry.
Ah. sophistry. Such a delightful word —
big shout out to dictionary.com's "word of the
day"it —it lies at the heart of how we deal. We
lie. We lie to each other and we lie to ourselves.
Now, before I dwell on details, it would
only be fair to point out that there are some
brave souls out there who. on realizing that
this graduate school business is mostly a
sham, leave. I salute you.
Sadly, though, not all of us have such
strength of character, so we subtly shift our
goals instead. Work no longer has primacy.
Rather, we look at these five (or six or seven
or eight or nine or 10 or 11 or 12) years as a
chance to Improve Ourselves.
We stop and take stock of our meager
lives. We decide that we are grown-ups now

and we'll goddamn behave like it. We'll learn
to drink wine. We'll flock to those social dance
classes. We'll stop hooking up (as if we ever
did) and start going on Dates. How mature.
Then there are the attempts to build the
body beautiful. Looking in the mirror one
day, you may decide that the developing adi
pose belt is really not that attractive.
Or perhaps as you are flossing one morn
ing (incidentally, flossing, a big conspiracy on
the part of the military-industrial-dental
complex, doesn't do anything) you will
glance in the mirror, and it will finally hit
home that geek chic doesn't exist: You need
to work out.
And so, we launch ourselves into pro
grams to turn our pasty, scrawny, ill-shaped
bodies into those Adonis-like (or female
equivalent) figures that grace the pages of
glossy magazines.
Like our abortive attempts to reach intel
lectual heights, these attempts at Improve
ment are doomed. If you haven't become the
person you're going to be by now,you may as
well give up on any hope of getting there.
Instead, I suggest bitching continually.
Perhaps in a column for The Daily.

So, I noticed that in last Friday's paper. The
Daily selected a bunch of columns (presum
ably representing the best we have to offer) for
the pre-commencement issue. I would be flat
tered that they chose one of mine, except they
picked the only one of the year that I didn't ac
tually write. All of which means that my ex
traordinarily delicate ego is in need of a mas
sage. So email me at navins@stanford.edu.
