## Lambie at home on the Farm Junior star has led Cardinal to team championship, American record 
### ISRAEL ROJAS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It was only natural for junior Arianna Lambie
to come to Stanford for college. After all, she was
practically born here.
Born just minutes away in Redwood City. Calif.,
Lambie lived in Menlo Park, Calif, for two years
while her father Fred finished up his graduate
work at Stanford and her mother Trudy raised Ar
ianna and her older brother Noah.
But when Fred finished grad school, the Lam
bies decided to move to Massachusetts, attracted
by the superior school system.
Growing up in Harvard, Mass.. a town of about
6,000, Arianna participated in all sorts of activities
as a child including playing soccer on a team
coached by her father.
"My parents encouraged me to try everything,
but they were careful not to force anything," Lam
bie said.
Growing up an active child in a small town. Ar
ianna knew practically everybody. There were 76
students in her graduating class, and most of them
had been together since kindergarten.
One of two students from her high school ad
mitted to Stanford, Lambie has lost contact with
her classmate on the Farm, but is still in touch with
a few friends from home.
By the time Arianna heard from Stanford, she
was ready to move on. While it was hard to leave
her family, the decision was easier because
and uncle live about three miles from campus.
Lambie is close with her family and enjoys spend
ing time with her younger cousins: 12 year-old
Peter and nine-year old Eric.
"I go to their baseball and soccer games," Lam
bie said. "They play baseball with me,although I'm
terrible. Sometimes we just hang out at the house

and I have dinner with the family."
Running for the eross-country team also helped
ease Arianna's transition away from home. Before
every school year, the team gets together for gruel
ing pre-season workouts and forge strong bonds.
"Coach Dina and the upperclassmen were
great." Lambie said.
Now a junior, Lambie has taken the lead on a
team facing the challenges of losing valuable sen
iors and bringing in a new head coach. However,
none of these challenges seem to have slowed Ari
anna, who led the team to a national championship
last fall with an eighth-place finish overall.
"I was so proud of the team and how we dealt
with adversity," Lambie said. "Everyone was 1(X)
percent there."
ITie top-10 finish at nationals was nothing new
to Lambie, though. Since her arrival at Stanford,
Arianna has been breaking records and accumu
lating awards. Asked about the source of all her
success. Arianna credits her family.
"My dad is really supportive of running," Lam
bie said. "He tries to learn what running means to
me and comes to my meets with my mom."
And the support has paid off. Lambie has re
ceived All-America honors several times, but her
most treasured achievements are the ones she has
accomplished with her teammates. She particular
ly loves the Penn Relays and has run some of her
best times there, including on the anchor leg of a
recent American record-setting 4x1500 meter
relay.
"I love it and feel like I have some potential,"
Lambie said.
When Arianna's competitive running days are
over, she plans to return to the East and raise a
family in New England. She plans on plenty of
travel and hopes to volunteer or partake in envi
ronmental activism.
Suffice it to say, the glamour hasn't gone to
Lambie, and she remains humble.
"I'm pretty quiet," Lambie said.
But on the track, actions speak louder than
words and Lambie's running speaks volumes.
