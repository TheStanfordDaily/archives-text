## A 						Day at the Races 
### 
If you've followed my column
since its meager origins last
summer (yeah, all three of you),
you've heard me talk about my
brother. For the rest of you, I've got
a brother who's a first-year at the
University of Virginia. For those
who don't speak Wahoo, he's a
freshman. Last weekend, I got a
chance to go check up on little
brother.
Every April, UVA plays host to
a day-long series of horse races
called the Foxfields. Essentially, the
entire undergraduate population
migrates about 10 miles to a large
farm (called Foxfield, appropriate
ly enough) to enjoy a day of fun
and sun. It's more than just the Vir
ginia kids though; college students
from all over the state attend this
thing. I met a group from George
town, which is a good 200 miles
away.
Anyway, this thing is the Ken
tucky Derby on Keystone Light.
Everyone comes out dressed to the
nines: seersucker suits (look it up if
you're not from the South), sun
dresses and the biggest, goofiest
hats you can find. People start ar
riving for a 1:00 p.m. post time at
around 9 a.m. By 11 a.m., the in
field is full of tailgaters. What fol
lows here is my account of the day:
11 a.m.: I arrive on the grounds,
ready to start the day. In prepara
tion, I've started drinking mimosas
and popped my collar.
1:00 p.m.: The horns blare the
fanfare.The horses are on their way
for the first races. There are six
scheduled runners in this first stee
plechase race, but only five come
out for the runout. Apparently, the
sixth horse pulled out at the last
minuter-unsatisfied with his morn
ing oats.
1:15 p.m.: In the first of many
losing bets on the day, I've chosen
Okey Dokey Smokey as my winner
in round one. On a slight side note,
never make bets with a person who
rides horses for a living. Just from
watching the runouts, my brother
ended up five-for-six picking win
ners on the day.
1:30 p.m.: Race number one be
gins.
1:33 p.m.:The first race ends. My
horse finishes third of five. This
would be the highest place of my
day.
2:00 p.m.: The second runout. 1
pick a lovely white horse because 1
like the color. My brother makes
his pick based on some good look
ing "extension," whatever the hell
that means.
2:30 p.m.: Race number two be
gins.
2:34 p.m.: A little longer than the
last one, but the same result. My
horse was nice enough to let all the
other horses finish in front of him,
including my brother's, who again
won the race.
3:00 p.m.: Another runout. Feel
ing like I'm getting the hang of this,
I go double or nothing with whoev
er will give me action.This time I go
with the biggest horse I can find.
"He's got good extension, right?" I
ask. "Sure sure, but I like..." an
swers my brother.
3:30 p.m.:The third race begins.
3:31 p.m.: My horse's race is
over. No no, not a winner. He's just
decided that doing a front flip over
one of the jumps and watching the
other horses run is a better plan.
Again, my brother's horse wins.
4:00 p.m.: Here comes the next
runout. This time, my brother
makes his pick and I choose the
same horse. Hell, he's three-for
three at this point in time.
4:30 p.m.: The fourth race be
gins.
4:33 p.m.: My brother's horse
loses his only race of the day.
5:00 p.m.: Like Charles Barkley
trying to break the house, I bet
double or nothing on the entire
day. Studying long and hard, 1
choose a horse named With A
Vengeance.
5:30 p.m.: The fifth race begins.
5:33 p.m.: My horse wins the
race! Only problem is that the rider
isn't with him, having been tossed
like oh-so-many meals earlier that
day. "Does that still count as a
win?" I ask. "Not a chance in hell,"
says my brother.
6:30 p.m.: Down to the last race
(and out of money), I pick a horse
on a whim. Sure enough, he's a
scratch. My brother would win the
race though.
Grand Total for the day: six
races, one third place, one fourth,
one sixth, two forfeits, and a
scratch. Money lost: undisclosed.
Brother buying the next round:
priceless.
The way I see it though, I only
have room to improve the next
time 1 visit the tracks. Oh, and I'm
always betting on my brother's
horse.
