# 'Cats, Devils await Card in the desert
## Stanford faces tough home stretch with three Top 10 teams on the schedule in the final two weeks of Pac-1 play 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
AT A GLANCE

The softball season is one of the longest in
college sports. With 47 games under its belt,
No. 8 Stanford has been playing as many as
five games in a weekend since mid-February.
Three months later, the end is in sight.
Six games remain in the Pac-10 season be
fore the official beginning of the road to the
Women's World Series. Hiose six games will
be no cakewalk though, as the Cardinal's
lowliest opponent is ranked No. 16 in the na
tion.
This weekend, Stanford (35-12, 7-8 Pac
-10) hits the road to play No. 6 Arizona State
(42-9,6-6) and No. 3 Arizona (36-9,7-6).
The Cardinal will face the Sun Devils
tonight and then pay a visit to the Wildcats
Saturday and Sunday. When they take the
field, the Card will face the top two hitters in
the nation's strongest conference. ASU's
Kaitlin Cochran and Arizona's Caitlin Lowe
boast the highest batting averages in the con
ference, both around .450, and have played
major roles in their teams' successes so far
this season.
Cochran is a slugger, with 12 homers on
the season and more than 50 RBI, while
Lowe likes the short ball â€” she only has 14
extra-base hits. Hie Cardinal have an arsenal
of big hitters of their own and a tough
bullpen, so this weekend's matchups are
guaranteed to be battles.
The last time these teams came together,
the pitchers got the better of the batters, with
no one scoring more than four runs in a

game. When the Arizona teams visited the
Farm two weeks ago, the Cardinal split with
ASU, with each team winning 3-1. In their
one meeting, Arizona claimed the 4-1 victory.
"The key is for us to bring our A-game."
Coach John Rittinan said. "We will need to
play at the top of our game to beat those
teams: good pitching, defense, and timely hit
ting."
Since its visit to Stanford, Arizona has
won four of six games, including victories
over No. 7 California, No. 16 Washington and
Arizona State. Cal took one win from the
Wildcats, and Arizona also fell to top-ranked
UCLA.
On Wednesday, Arizona's Callista Balko
ended the rivalry game with the Sun Devils
when she sent the ball out of the park for a
grandslam and a 10-run lead. Her nine
homers on the season put her second on the
team behind the Wildcats' slugger Kristie
Fox.
ASU has had a harder time in the last few
weeks, beating Washington but then losing
their last three in a row.

After Cochran. Mindy Cowles has been
swinging the hottest bat for ASU. 1 ler 40 RBI
and 37 hits are second on the team and she
has notched a team-high 14 four-baggers.
Stanford's offense is led, as it has been all
year, by the tandem of senior centerficlder
Catalina Morris and freshman Maddy Coon.
One of them leads the team in every offen
sive category but triples, where sophomore
rightfielder Anna Beardman tops the list.
Stanford's young bullpen has been tested,
but stood up well. Freshman Missy Penna
and sophomore Becky McCullough have

gotten the majority of the starts, with senior
Laura Severson providing able backup. The
pitching corps boasts a combined 2.17 ERA
and Penna is closing in on the 20th win of her
freshman campaign.
Ihere have been ups and downs for the
Cardinal throughout the season, but the
team looks poised to finish strong against the
nation's best.
"Obviously I think we could have won
some of the games we lost and probably
should have lost some that we won," Rittman
said. "The biggest thing for us is to focus on

the future and learn from the past."
After the trip to Arizona, the Cardinal will
close out the season at home with Washing
ton and defending national champion and
top-ranked UCLA. And after that, it'll he
tournament time. Rittman says his team will
be ready.
"We don't prepare [for the postseason]
any differently from any other weekend of
the season," he said. "At this time of year, the
biggest thing is staying mentally fresh and
avoiding injuries so that we can get ready for
some tough competition."

Sophmore rightfielder Anna Beardman and sophomore second baseman Tricia Aggabao nearly collide in a loss to Arizona State two weeks
ago. Stanford will face the Sun Devils again this weekend, this time in Tempe, Ariz. The Cardinal have only six Pac-10 games remaining in 2006.
