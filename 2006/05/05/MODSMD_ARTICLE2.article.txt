## High stakes against familiar Cal squad 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Sizing up the Bears
The Cardinal can't be too happy
about their 4-3 loss to California
four days ago, but at least they know
what's coming their way.
The Golden Bears (23-22, 8-10
Pac-10) visit the Cardinal (20-20, 5-
10) tonight for the first of three con
ference games. It'll be the teams'
fourth official game of 2006, but Cal
and Stanford have seen each other
plenty of times this season. Cal
Coach David Esquer, a former Stan
ford player, often brought his team
across the Bay for weekday practice
games earlier this year.
"We see Cal frequently," senior
shortstop Chris Minaker said. "We
played them more than any other
team in the Pac-10 or the country.
It's always a battle and it's going to
come down to who can execute and
who wants it more."
That the teams know each other
well helps create close, competitive
games. Stanford dropped the first
meeting in March, 7-6, only to then
pull out a 6-5 win in 11 innings.
The Card then out-hit the Bears
Monday night in Berkeley, nine to
six, but fell 4-3 thanks to three Cal
runs in the seventh inning. Alex
Rollin notched five hits off a Cardi
nal pitching staff whose ERA is now
a mediocre 4.48, sixth in the confer
ence. Those previous three games all
counted as non-conference contests.
At 6 p.m. tonight, senior
righthander Greg Reynolds (4-3,

Brandon Morrow (7-2,1.59). Anoth
er righty, Tyson Ross (4-4, 3.70
ERA) is slated to start for the Bears
on Saturday. Other starters have yet
to be announced.
"Their Friday night guy Morrow
is a fireballer," senior second base
man Chris Lewis said. "He's proba
bly a top prospect. It's tough any
time you face a guy like that. You're
in trouble, and you got to do what
you can to scrap for runs."
Last weekend, the Bears took
two of three from No. 22 UCLA, and
they come into tonight's game with
four straight wins. Craig Allen leads
the Bears at the plate, batting .357,
with 65 hits, 13 doubles and nine
homeruns.The team as a whole has a
.264 mark.
"They don't have a lot of power
but they put the ball in play and they
run okay so you have to watch out
for that," Lewis said.
Stanford, meanwhile, has some
streaks of its own going. Senior
shortstop and offensive leader Chris
Minaker looks to extend his 10-
