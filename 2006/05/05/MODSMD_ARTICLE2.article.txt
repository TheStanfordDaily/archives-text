# CRUNCH TIME
## High stakes against familiar Cal squad 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Sizing up the Bears
The Cardinal can't be too happy
about their 4-3 loss to California
four days ago, but at least they know
what's coming their way.
The Golden Bears (23-22, 8-10
Pac-10) visit the Cardinal (20-20, 5-
10) tonight for the first of three con
ference games. It'll be the teams'
fourth official game of 2006, but Cal
and Stanford have seen each other
plenty of times this season. Cal
Coach David Esquer, a former Stan
ford player, often brought his team
across the Bay for weekday practice
games earlier this year.
"We see Cal frequently," senior
shortstop Chris Minaker said. "We
played them more than any other
team in the Pac-10 or the country.
It's always a battle and it's going to
come down to who can execute and
who wants it more."
That the teams know each other
well helps create close, competitive
games. Stanford dropped the first
meeting in March, 7-6, only to then
pull out a 6-5 win in 11 innings.
The Card then out-hit the Bears
Monday night in Berkeley, nine to
six, but fell 4-3 thanks to three Cal
runs in the seventh inning. Alex
Rollin notched five hits off a Cardi
nal pitching staff whose ERA is now
a mediocre 4.48, sixth in the confer
ence. Those previous three games all
counted as non-conference contests.
At 6 p.m. tonight, senior
righthander Greg Reynolds (4-3,

3.66 ERA) goes up against Cal's
Brandon Morrow (7-2,1.59). Anoth
er righty, Tyson Ross (4-4, 3.70
ERA) is slated to start for the Bears
on Saturday. Other starters have yet
to be announced.
"Their Friday night guy Morrow
is a fireballer," senior second base
man Chris Lewis said. "He's proba
bly a top prospect. It's tough any
time you face a guy like that. You're
in trouble, and you got to do what
you can to scrap for runs."
Last weekend, the Bears took
two of three from No. 22 UCLA, and
they come into tonight's game with
four straight wins. Craig Allen leads
the Bears at the plate, batting .357,
with 65 hits, 13 doubles and nine
homeruns.The team as a whole has a
.264 mark.
"They don't have a lot of power
but they put the ball in play and they
run okay so you have to watch out
for that," Lewis said.
Stanford, meanwhile, has some
streaks of its own going. Senior
shortstop and offensive leader Chris
Minaker looks to extend his 10-
I game hit streak.
Stanford's .264 team batting average ranks last in the
league while their 3.75 conference ERA is second.
California currently stands seventh in the Pac-10
while Stanford remains the last of the nine squads, so a
series win is a must if either team hopes to participate in
NCAAs.
"It's crucial to come away with a victory," Lewis said.
"We've got to at least win two. A sweep would be great,
but to give ourselves a chance to be in the postseason, we
need to get two out of three."
Seniors' last stand
Lewis is the vocal one, Minaker said, always handing
out praise and pushing someone when its due. John Hes
ter leads by example on the field, while Matt Manship
handles a young pitching staff. And Minaker admits he's
the one teammates turn to for advice on anything about
the life of a student-athlete.
Together, the four seniors lead a young Cardinal
team. And after witnessing three successful seasons in
which Stanford reached NCAA Regionals each June,
the Class of 2006 is now facing an uphill climb if it wants
to see the postseason one final time.
"It's been frustrating because we've really won so
much and got used to winning," Minaker said. "We ex
pect winning,our fans expect it. It's really what Stanford
represents."
The team has improved as of late, finally winning its
first Pac-10 series against No. 16 Arizona State at home
last weekend.Then, Stanford lost a close one against Cal
on Monday before finding a breath of fresh air against
San Jose State Hiesday night.The Cardinal put together
four hits for four runs in the bottom of the eighth to de

feat the Spartans, 6-2.
Whether it's enough to give the Cardinal a postsea
son push remains to be seen. Still, the future looks bright
to this year's graduating seniors. Four pitchers, three of
them freshmen (starter Jeremy Bleich and relievers
Austin Yount and Sean Ratliffe),helped the Cardinal se
cure the win at homelliesday night.
"We have a lot of freshman who play." Minaker said.
"They're getting better, they work hard and they're
going to be good, so I think you're going to see us finish
this year strong. But it's just been a struggle, getting
everybody on the same page with performance."
The final three-game home-stand
As June play approaches, the end of regular-season
home games nears faster than the end of the regular-sea
son. The Cardinal have five more games at Sunken Dia
mond this season, starting today.
"It's in the back of your mind because you've spent so
much time here and so much of the last four years have
been spent on this field in front of these fans," Minaker
said. "You want to leave them with a lasting impression.
You want your legacy here to be a strong one."
Once the series is over, only two of Stanford's re
maining 10 games will be played at home. Stanford is 14
10 in Sunken Diamond this year.
A major league visit
T\vo Houston Astros representatives were present at
Sunken Diamond on Wednesday afternoon. After
speaking briefly to Minaker and Lewis, the pair was seen
speaking with Reynolds, this week's Pac-10 Pitcher of
the Week, who has mentioned he is considering leaving
the Farm after the end of this season.

said. "You want to leave them with a lasting impression.
You want your legacy here to be a strong one."
Once the series is over, only two of Stanford's re
maining 10 games will be played at home. Stanford is 14
10 in Sunken Diamond this year.
A major league visit
T\vo Houston Astros representatives were present at
Sunken Diamond on Wednesday afternoon. After
speaking briefly to Minaker and Lewis, the pair was seen
speaking with Reynolds, this week's Pac-10 Pitcher of
the Week, who has mentioned he is considering leaving
the Farm after the end of this season.
Sizing up the Bears
The Cardinal can't be too happy
about their 4-3 loss to California
four days ago, but at least they know
what's coming their way.
The Golden Bears (23-22, 8-10
Pac-10) visit the Cardinal (20-20, 5-
10) tonight for the first of three con
ference games. It'll be the teams'
fourth official game of 2006, but Cal
and Stanford have seen each other
plenty of times this season. Cal
Coach David Esquer, a former Stan
ford player, often brought his team
across the Bay for weekday practice
games earlier this year.
"We see Cal frequently," senior
shortstop Chris Minaker said. "We
played them more than any other
team in the Pac-10 or the country.
It's always a battle and it's going to
come down to who can execute and
who wants it more."
That the teams know each other
well helps create close, competitive
games. Stanford dropped the first
meeting in March, 7-6, only to then
pull out a 6-5 win in 11 innings.
The Card then out-hit the Bears
Monday night in Berkeley, nine to
six, but fell 4-3 thanks to three Cal
runs in the seventh inning. Alex
Rollin notched five hits off a Cardi
nal pitching staff whose ERA is now
a mediocre 4.48, sixth in the confer
ence. Those previous three games all
counted as non-conference contests.
At 6 p.m. tonight, senior
righthander Greg Reynolds (4-3,

3.66 ERA) goes up against Cal's
Brandon Morrow (7-2,1.59). Anoth
er righty, Tyson Ross (4-4, 3.70
ERA) is slated to start for the Bears
on Saturday. Other starters have yet
to be announced.
"Their Friday night guy Morrow
is a fireballer," senior second base
man Chris Lewis said. "He's proba
bly a top prospect. It's tough any
time you face a guy like that. You're
in trouble, and you got to do what
you can to scrap for runs."
Last weekend, the Bears took
two of three from No. 22 UCLA, and
they come into tonight's game with
four straight wins. Craig Allen leads
the Bears at the plate, batting .357,
with 65 hits, 13 doubles and nine
homeruns.The team as a whole has a
.264 mark.
"They don't have a lot of power
but they put the ball in play and they
run okay so you have to watch out
for that," Lewis said.
Stanford, meanwhile, has some
streaks of its own going. Senior
shortstop and offensive leader Chris
Minaker looks to extend his 10-
I game hit streak.
Stanford's .264 team batting average ranks last in the
league while their 3.75 conference ERA is second.
California currently stands seventh in the Pac-10
while Stanford remains the last of the nine squads, so a
series win is a must if either team hopes to participate in
NCAAs.
"It's crucial to come away with a victory," Lewis said.
"We've got to at least win two. A sweep would be great,
but to give ourselves a chance to be in the postseason, we
need to get two out of three."
Seniors' last stand
Lewis is the vocal one, Minaker said, always handing
out praise and pushing someone when its due. John Hes
ter leads by example on the field, while Matt Manship
handles a young pitching staff. And Minaker admits he's
the one teammates turn to for advice on anything about
the life of a student-athlete.
Together, the four seniors lead a young Cardinal
team. And after witnessing three successful seasons in
which Stanford reached NCAA Regionals each June,
the Class of 2006 is now facing an uphill climb if it wants
to see the postseason one final time.
"It's been frustrating because we've really won so
much and got used to winning," Minaker said. "We ex
pect winning,our fans expect it. It's really what Stanford
represents."
The team has improved as of late, finally winning its
first Pac-10 series against No. 16 Arizona State at home
last weekend.Then, Stanford lost a close one against Cal
on Monday before finding a breath of fresh air against
San Jose State Hiesday night.The Cardinal put together
four hits for four runs in the bottom of the eighth to de

feat the Spartans, 6-2.
Whether it's enough to give the Cardinal a postsea
son push remains to be seen. Still, the future looks bright
to this year's graduating seniors. Four pitchers, three of
them freshmen (starter Jeremy Bleich and relievers
Austin Yount and Sean Ratliffe),helped the Cardinal se
cure the win at homelliesday night.
"We have a lot of freshman who play." Minaker said.
"They're getting better, they work hard and they're
going to be good, so I think you're going to see us finish
this year strong. But it's just been a struggle, getting
everybody on the same page with performance."
The final three-game home-stand
As June play approaches, the end of regular-season
home games nears faster than the end of the regular-sea
son. The Cardinal have five more games at Sunken Dia
mond this season, starting today.
"It's in the back of your mind because you've spent so
much time here and so much of the last four years have
been spent on this field in front of these fans," Minaker
said. "You want to leave them with a lasting impression.
You want your legacy here to be a strong one."
Once the series is over, only two of Stanford's re
maining 10 games will be played at home. Stanford is 14
10 in Sunken Diamond this year.
