## Sun Spots: 8 great steps to catch some rays 
### JENNY BAER DESK EDITOR 
o the clouds over Palo Alto are finally clearing up *knock on wood*.
Whether they are working on a summer tan, or just trying to work on a
problem set outside of Meyer Library, bikini and board short-clad stu-
B dents all over campus are flocking to nearby fields for a chance to catch

some rays before heading home for the summer. While the closest

j _ _ -
patch of sun to your dorm or Row house may seem enticing, I ad-

vise you to give The Farm's other fields a chance.

If you want the quintessential Stanford sunbathing experience, then the Oval is
the place for you. It may be a bit of a trek, but with a perfectly symmetrical
view of The Quad. Memorial Church and the Rodin sculptures and Hoover

Tower in the periphery, this is probably the most picturesque sunbathing
spot. Make sure you're covered up — you never know when you'll be cap
ured in the lens of a tourist's camera.

While the narrow and sloping lawn adjacent to the recreation pool at the Avery
Aquatic Center may not look like the most enticing spot to spend an afternoon.

it attracts a number of students on sunny weekend afternoons. The appeal of the
Avery lawn is clearly its proximity to the pool.There isn't a play pool at Avery (all

lanes at the recreation pool require lap swimming), but reading on this lawn is an
excellent way to catch your breath and let the sun dry you off from your intensive
(or not so intensive) swim workout.

112 If you consider construction noise relaxing, or at least tolerable, then the
field between Wilbur and Stern may be your ideal spot. Its proximity to the

two residences makes it easy enough to drag out a lawn chair or carry a couple

towels and pillows with you. Another nice aspect of Stern is that parts of it lie in the

shade, giving protection to those of us who tend to burn rather than tan

Mayfield Playfield, as upper-row residents affectonately call it, is probably the best field on
campus for studying. Aside from the noise of electric leaf blowers manicuring the lawns of
the surrounding faculty ghetto, or the rowdiness from the occasional game of slosh ball, the
Playfield is quite relaxing. If you're lucky, Durand might leave a moldy couch out there for
you to sit, leaving you to wonder why they no longer want it inside their house. But be care
ful, if you're a freshman wandering over from East campus. Row residents might give you

the evil eye.

Was MuFuUnSun (possibly the lamest Stanford acronym) during Freshman
Orientation the last time you've been to Roble Field? Well, maybe you'll feel

differently about Roble when you're not making awkward "so where are
you from? Oh cool, what's your major?" conversation with other new

freshmen. Roble is a larger, less intimate field than some of the oth-

ers, but it's a convenient location to visit if you live on West Cam
pus. A number of club sports teams hold practice on the field, so

be sure to watch out for renegade Frisbees or soccer balls.

If your sun bathing philosophy revolves around seeing and being seen, then you'll likely
find your favorite spot at the field between Dinkelspiel and Old Union. Entertainment is

frequently provided by jugglers, slack liners and musicians showcasing their skills on this tiny,
shaded field. In addition, everyone on campus rides through White Plaza at least once each day,
so you're guaranteed to see a few familiar faces.

If you've taken I HUM with a cool TF, then you've likely held a discussion section on the field next to Meyer Li
brary (on the side opposite Green Library). While the enormous trees make for excellent shade, they drop rather
prickly leaves so it's a good idea to bring a towel or even a lawn chair. Also because of the shade, the grass may
be damp enough to soak through whatever towel you bring. Despite these drawbacks, the field outside of Meyer
is a good location to enjoy your Moonbeans latte. And it certainly beats IHUM section in the Meyer Forum
room.

Although Lagunita's "lake" status is debatable, the patch of grass by the trail entrance may be perfect for those
of you who like to pretend that we go to a school with a true lake on campus. While this lawn isn't always a pop
ular one, it has its strong points. For example if you look up from your reading and squint your eyes really hard,
it might look like we still have a lake on campus! But don't get carried away and jump in, it's not that deep.
