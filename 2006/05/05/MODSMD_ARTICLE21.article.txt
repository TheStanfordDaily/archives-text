# Olivia Puerta's Best Bites
## Out for Sushi?

While the mini-garden and fountain outside Fuki-
Sushi's door offer a pleasant greeting, the
slightly upscale atmosphere is somewhat un
friendly toward the student crowd. After walking into a
carefully (and stuffily) decorated dining room dotted
with dining business partners, my friend mentioned that
she felt "like there's a dress code."
While the restaurant's mood might not make the av
erage student feel at home, any patron, student or not,
would be repelled by the terribly pungent odor of bath

room cleaner that accosted my senses as my friend and I
sat at our table. We tried to make the best of it by switch
ing to a table farther away from the offensive restroom's
entrance, but the smell was somewhat inescapable.
Clearly, Fuki-Sushi's atmosphere doesn't garner
much support for its favorable 3.5 overall star rating.
Fuki-Sushi also lost points on service; the food took an in
credibly long time to arrive considering the small size of
the order and the number of patrons in the restaurant at
the time.

So where did Fuki-Sushi go right? My miso soup ($3),
side salad ($3), and futo maki ($9.85) were all delicious. I
especially enjoyed the futo maki â€” it had been a long
time since I had ordered that particular roll and 1 had for
gotten how good it could be! As an additional plus, the
serving size was much larger than I expected, with enough

very large pieces to make for a complete meal. Fuki-Sushi
also serves a nice blend of green tea, so make sure you ask
for your complementary pot!
All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed what 1 ate at Fuki
Sushi.even if I was somewhat turned off by the sights and
didn't at all relish the smells. If you want to treat yourself
to tasty sushi, Fuki Sushi is definitely worth a try, espe
cially if you have a visiting parent in town to ease the bill's
blow. A parent might even make you feel like you fit in
more with the restaurant's apparent target demographic.
Although I'm on a mission to find a sushi restaurant
that's a little more student-friendly in terms of style and
budget, I must give Fuki Sushi credit for their high quali
ty food. The memory of the truly scrumptious futo maki
is definitely enough to make me to dine there again.
