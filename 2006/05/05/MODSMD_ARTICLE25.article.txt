# Survivor: Art School

### RYAN LAMPE INTERMISSION VAN GOGH 
For a film that begins like an off-kilter retread
of "American Pie," "Art School Confidential" is a
very dark comedy. Those of you who felt that

"American Dreamz" wasn't tough
enough on its subjects will
be right at home here. Though the
movie has fewer targets than
"Dreamz," it has a ruthlessness that
seldom flags. A trait that, unfortu
nately, proves to be a huge liability in
its final act.
"Art School Confidential" centers
around talented young artist Jerome
Platz (Max Minghella, son of direc
tor Anthony) who enrolls in a tiny

East Coast art school, hoping to become the
world's greatest artist. Unfortunately, Jerome's
talents go under-appreciated. And to make mat
ters worse, his dream girl, Audrey (Sophia Myles),
begins showing interest in the school's latest art
star. In desperation, Jerome formulates a crazy
plan to gain notoriety and win her back. If this
sounds too conventional, I should add two things.
First, the campus grounds are being stalked by a vi
cious serial killer. Second, the movie was directed
by Terry Zwigoff ("Bad Santa") and based on a
comic story by Daniel Clowes.
The is actually Zwigoff s second collaboration
with Clowes. Like their first film, "Ghost World,"
"Art School Confidential" deals with sensitive
teenagers who feel alienated by the phony world
around them. And like the (very) short comic
story it is based on, the film enjoys lampooning the

highly pretentious art world. A world in which a
student's random scribbling is celebrated for its
humanity and another's childlike drawing of a car
is revered for its artlessness. Thankfully my fa
vorite panel from the comic, in which students re
spond to the information that only one in a hun-

dred will find work in
their chosen field, also
finds its way into the
movie.
The first half of "Art
School Confidential" is
cynical but spirited. The
film has a great time
mocking the bulk of its
characters. When Jerome
visits the home of Profes
sor Sandiford (John

Malkovich) and inquires about the simple trian
gles he paints, his teacher responds that he's been
doing them for twenty-five years and that he "was
one of the first." In an earlier scene, a successful
graduate from the school returns to give a Q&A
session and claims that being an asshole is every
one's true nature and that artistic ability is not
something that can be taught.
Nevertheless the film is very cautious in its por
trayal of Jerome and Audrey. Their relationship is
never forced and remains intriguing throughout
even though we never understand Audrey as well
as we'd like to. Jerome's relationship with a failed
artist, Jimmy (Jim Broadbent), is also effective
and reminds us of Thora Birch's relationship with
Steve Buscemi in "Ghost World." Indeed "Art
School Confidential" works best when it's concen
trating on some of its supporting characters which

include Angelica Huston
and Steve Buscemi, In
them we see what the fu
ture might bring for
Jerome.
Sadly, this theme is
largely abandoned in the
film's final act. Jerome's
relationships with Jimmy
and Audrey are neglected
in favor of an ending too
contrived and too self
conscious to be satisfying.
In "Ghost World," we wit
nessed the turning point
in two character's lives. In
"Art School Confiden
tial," we witness a missed
opportunity on the part of
Zwigoff and Clowes. Of
course, many will laud the
bitter cynicism of the
film'sending. But be wary
of these people. It's possi
ble they're as pretentious
as the very characters the
film sends up.
