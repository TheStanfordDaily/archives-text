# EDITORS' NOTE
## 
### BETSY CONGDON VICTOR FUSTE INTERMISSION EDITORS 
We freakin' hate editors notes.
What the hell do we have to say that
people will actually want to read?
We know we don't read it and we
write the damn things. On a side
note, we don't read The Daily either
or read at all for that matter since
we're illiterate — well, at least Vic
tor is. He just points at things and
grunts. Oh well, seems to work.
As a result, we've decided to try
and expand our reading vocabulary
by holding our very own fiction
writing contest in the hopes of

learnin' Victor some words. Wc
even convinced ITie Daily to pitch
in some prize money for the best
stories, and believe us when we say
it was like trying to get blood from
a stone. Or your money back from a
hooker.
Now that we have Betsy's weekend
activities covered, let's get down to
some rules. We want your original,
unpublished stories to grace our
pages. They should be 1000 words
or lcss.THl: DEADLINE IS MAY
19th —we thought that should be
in capital letters so it sounded like
we were yelling. Which is how Vic
tor usually communicates since he's
illiterate.

Wc will publish the top three
stories in our May 26th issue. The
third place story gets $25 in cold
hard cash and a chance to see Betsy
retell Leviticus through interpre
tive dance. 'Ihe second place story
gets $25 and an album of your
choosing. The first place story gets
$50 to spend as you wish.
Send your submissions to inter-
and you
can do your part to repair the dam
age the public school system has
caused. Also, if you have any ques
tions. shoot us a line. More impor
tantly. if you have hate mail, send
your scathing remarks because we
love you so much.
