### RACHEL TORRES INTERMISSION COYOTE 
"All the Roadrunning," the
new album of duets from Mark
Knopfler (from Dire Straits) and
Emmylou Harris (a legendary
singer-songwriter) is the type of
CD that you'll find yourself bor
rowing from vour narents' CD

collection. It's
different
enough from
the college
indie rock you
usually listen to,
so you're will
ing to rip it onto
your computer
— but you
wouldn't want

to spend the
money buying it yourself.
i"Times Music Store charac
terizes this album as country;
even so, it bears no resemblance
to the pop-y nasal stuff that
makes you cringe when the TV
surfs onto Country Music Televi
sion (CMT). Instead, the album
attempts a more folksy, slight
rock and roll shading. Harris has
a delicate, feminine and iconic
voice that blends well with
Knopfler's very manly baritone.
The album is nice to listen to and
a few of the songs are catchy, par
ticularly the single. "This Is Us,"
an homage, unbelievably, to a
stable monogamous relation
ship. Instead of the usual con
flict, cheating or asymmetric
love that inspires so much music
(who doesn't love a good
breakup song?), "This Is Us,"
celebrates a couple looking
back at the fun times they
had together. Harris
and Knopfler

sing, "This is us down at the
Marcli Gras/ this is us in your
daddy's car/...y0u and me and
our memories/ this is us."
Music about happy people is
refreshing. The problem is that
this happy music is so slickly pro
duced, and neither Harris nor
Knopfler really push their voic
es. 'Hie result is that, without anv

emotional or
musical
striving-for
something-
more, the
album is just
too plain,
like generic
brand lite
vanilla ice
cream. The

lyrics are
evocative of the love between
two people, such as on the song
"Belle Starr," where Harris
croons that "I'll be your Belle
Starr/ you can be my Jesse
James." But given the power that
Harris and Knopfler's voices are
capable of, evocative lyrics are
unsatisfying when the music
arrangements are so nonde
script.
Ultimately,"All the Roadrun
ning" is best where it belongs —
in your parents CD collection,
and not on your iHmes. It's per
fect for Baby Boomers reconcil
ing their mid-life crises, and
wanting a to rock out country
style — but not wanting to rock
out too hard, they might throw
their backs out. Still, we won't
tell anybody if you keep "This Is
Us" to play when you're day
dreaming about your (monoga
mous) romance with a certain
cowboy or cowgirl. j
