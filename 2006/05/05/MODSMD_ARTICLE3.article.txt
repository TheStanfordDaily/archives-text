"Baseb&ll is a two-sided game. I do what I can to get my
hitsJeffi and there, but I'm going to play good defense
for tßis team because I need to keep us in ballgames."
— CHRIS LEWIS, senior

On Wednesday afternoon, after a brief team
meeting, senior Chris Lewis picked up a foot
hall in the shade of Sunken Diamond's oak
trees. Drawing his right arm back. Lewis let it
fly, sending a perfect spiral down to shallow right field.
Whether in football or baseball, the second baseman
has learned: a perfect throw takes work.
At the start of the season, Lewis' oft-wild throw from
second base usually elicited winces from the stands.
Coach Mark Marquess soon shifted him to third.
"I think he wanted to lengthen out the throw for me so
I could just let it fly and not have to worry about the short
throw." said Lewis, insisting that the problem has been
fixed.
The change in throwing hasn't been the biggest obsta
cle Lewis has had to overcome this season, however.
Mired in an offensive slump for the first five series of the
year, Lewis could not get his batting average to crack .200.
He knew the hitting would come. Slowly, but it would
come, just as it had throughout his first three years on the
Farm. So he focused a little more on his throw and work
in the infield.
"Baseball is a two-sided game," Lewis said. "If you're
doing crappy at the plate, you better make up for it on the
field. That's kind of the way I was looking at it for awhile:
'I'm going to keep working at the plate, try to do what I
can to get my hits here and there, but I'm going to play
good defense for this team because I need to keep us in
ballgames."'
