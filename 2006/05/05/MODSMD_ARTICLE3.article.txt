# Senior Chris Lewis
## ARMED AND READY 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
"Baseb&ll is a two-sided game. I do what I can to get my
hitsJeffi and there, but I'm going to play good defense
for tßis team because I need to keep us in ballgames."
— CHRIS LEWIS, senior

On Wednesday afternoon, after a brief team
meeting, senior Chris Lewis picked up a foot
hall in the shade of Sunken Diamond's oak
trees. Drawing his right arm back. Lewis let it
fly, sending a perfect spiral down to shallow right field.
Whether in football or baseball, the second baseman
has learned: a perfect throw takes work.
At the start of the season, Lewis' oft-wild throw from
second base usually elicited winces from the stands.
Coach Mark Marquess soon shifted him to third.
"I think he wanted to lengthen out the throw for me so
I could just let it fly and not have to worry about the short
throw." said Lewis, insisting that the problem has been
fixed.
The change in throwing hasn't been the biggest obsta
cle Lewis has had to overcome this season, however.
Mired in an offensive slump for the first five series of the
year, Lewis could not get his batting average to crack .200.
He knew the hitting would come. Slowly, but it would
come, just as it had throughout his first three years on the
Farm. So he focused a little more on his throw and work
in the infield.
"Baseball is a two-sided game," Lewis said. "If you're
doing crappy at the plate, you better make up for it on the
field. That's kind of the way I was looking at it for awhile:
'I'm going to keep working at the plate, try to do what I
can to get my hits here and there, but I'm going to play
good defense for this team because I need to keep us in
ballgames."'

After playing 30 games in his
freshman year (.159 batting average),
and then playing 22 in an up-and
down sophomore season, I,ewis has
learned to be patient with his hitting.
Sure enough, when March 10 rolled
around, so did the Santa Margarita,
Calif., native's offense. Lewis' right
handed swing tallied three hits and
three RBIs against Southern Califor
nia to give Stanford a 7-6 victory.
Since then Lewis has had seven
multi-hit games this season and has
pushed his batting average from .ISO
to .259. He recorded four hits against
Arizona State last Friday and went
two-for-five in this week's two games.
The biggest difference from two
months ago? According to Lewis, he
just relaxed and tried to maximize the
amount of time the ball hit the barrel.
"I climbed up on the plate a little
bit. tried to take the outside pitch
away," Lewis said."l'm trying to be on
time as much as I possibly can anil not
get fooled on pitches. 1 try to hit ball as
hard as I can every time. I don't care if
I hit in on the ground or in the air, but
if I can hit it on the barrel as many
times in the game as I can, I'm going to
get more hits."
And as far as the defense goes, he

never gave up. While the Cardinal's
regular second baseman has 11 errors
on the season, Lewis has currently
gone 13 games without a mistake.
For a body that has started 99 con
secutive games, that's quite a feat. He,
close friend and teammate Chris Mi
naker, and sophomore rightfielder
Michael Taylor have all started 99
straight games and should notch No.
100 today against California.
According to Lewis, he doesn't get
tired. 1 le's just thankful to have a con
sistent start. But what keeps him
going every day? It's simple.
"The game," Lewis said. "1 love
this game — I've been playing it all
my life and I look forward to playing
it every day. When I can't play it any
more it's going to be a sad day. I won't
know what to do with myself because
it's all I ever really think about.
"My teammates keep me going.
Playing in this park keeps me going.
Anil the thrill of competition; I love
competing against people — I love
winning."
Minakercan attest to that.The two
have known each other since they
were 14 years old in Washington.
Lewis even played for Minaker's dad
on a Little League team that reached

the World Series with Minaker at
short and Lewis at third.
"Chris and I have been best friends
since seventh grade," Minaker said.
"We played middle school basketball,
baseball and wrestling together. He's
a very loyal person and a loyal friend.
He works hard to push his teammates
and himself to be the best. He's a kid
who really wants to succeed and he
wants everyone else to succeed
around him. He's very good about
picking you up and piaying a vocal
role when something needs to be
said."
But while Minaker may think he
knows everything about his friend,
left-side defensive partner and 6-4-3
double-play man, there is at least one
thing that the vocal hopes to
keep quiet. And it involves those
throwing hands again.
"That's my secret: 1 play the
piano," Lewis said. "I can play just
about anything you put in my hands if
you give me half an hour to mess
around with it, and I usually just play
by ear."
"1 used to sing a little when I was
younger," Lewis added, laughing.
"But I try to stay away from that as
much as I can."
"Baseb&ll is a two-sided game. I do what I can to get my

gone 13 games without a mistake.
For a body that has started 99 con
secutive games, that's quite a feat. He,
close friend and teammate Chris Mi
naker, and sophomore rightfielder
Michael Taylor have all started 99
straight games and should notch No.
100 today against California.
According to Lewis, he doesn't get
tired. 1 le's just thankful to have a con
sistent start. But what keeps him
going every day? It's simple.
"The game," Lewis said. "1 love
this game — I've been playing it all
my life and I look forward to playing
it every day. When I can't play it any
more it's going to be a sad day. I won't
know what to do with myself because
it's all I ever really think about.
"My teammates keep me going.
Playing in this park keeps me going.
Anil the thrill of competition; I love
competing against people — I love
winning."
Minakercan attest to that.The two
have known each other since they
were 14 years old in Washington.
Lewis even played for Minaker's dad
on a Little League team that reached

the World Series with Minaker at
short and Lewis at third.
"Chris and I have been best friends
since seventh grade," Minaker said.
"We played middle school basketball,
baseball and wrestling together. He's
a very loyal person and a loyal friend.
He works hard to push his teammates
and himself to be the best. He's a kid
who really wants to succeed and he
wants everyone else to succeed
around him. He's very good about
picking you up and piaying a vocal
role when something needs to be
said."
But while Minaker may think he
knows everything about his friend,
left-side defensive partner and 6-4-3
double-play man, there is at least one
thing that the vocal hopes to
keep quiet. And it involves those
throwing hands again.
"That's my secret: 1 play the
piano," Lewis said. "I can play just
about anything you put in my hands if
you give me half an hour to mess
around with it, and I usually just play
by ear."
"1 used to sing a little when I was
younger," Lewis added, laughing.
"But I try to stay away from that as
much as I can."
