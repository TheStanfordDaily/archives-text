### COSMIN DEACQNU INTERMISSION SILVER MEDALIST 
I'VE

The Secret
Machines.
More con
cretely, if
you're famil
iar with Por
cupine Tree
(and, if
you're a prog
fan, you
should he),
they sound

something like them. It that
doesn't ring a bell, think Pink
Floyd, but more indie.
The two singles from this
album "Lightning Blue Eyes"
and "Alone, Unaware and
Stoned" are catchy enough,
and. indeed, there is certainly

v.; i
no shortage of hooks on "Ten g
Silver Drops." But the bril
liance of this album becomes '
apparent after several listens, g
llie Secret Machines are not
exactly complex, but there is *
more to the music than there -
seems to be at first glance. I've
listened to this album at least .
six times over the last few days
and each time it gets better. 1
The songs are short by prog
standards: two are under five
minutes, and only one exceeds
eight. The longest, "Daddy in
the Doldrums," is the true '
standout. A single five-note j
bass riff propels the majority of
the song. Spacey guitars and <
sinister-sounding vocals build
on top of that. Then suddenly,
after five minutes, a crescendo
appears only to be subdued
moments afterward. I have a *
feeling this song will enter
heavy rotation on my playlists.
The lyrical theme of this
album is almost exclusively
lost love. It's not a very happy
album. However, while pretty $
personal, it's not whiny or
something you'd only want to
listen to when depressed. The
lyricist is no Bob Dylan or
Roger Waters, but he gets the
job done.
Overall. I strongly recom
mend this album. It may not be 4
for everybody, if you like im
mediately catchy, cookie-cut- I
ter pop, this might not be the -

oesi cnoice.
If. however,
your music
taste is a hit
more re- m
fined, 1
would!Â®
suggest you
check out >
this album.
Al-*

ment). you can go see The Se
cret Machines perform at the 31
