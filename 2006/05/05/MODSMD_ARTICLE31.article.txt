### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION SEX GODDESS 
Dear Roxy.
1 just started dating a guy after a long
courtship. 1 usually don't go down on a
guy until he has gone down on me but we
had been flirting for so long. Now we are
in a pattern of me only pleasing him. 1 "'I
don't want to be too forward, but I think
I deserve some as well. Also, he has been
shying away from having sex with me.
I'm worried that he isn't interested in me
in that way. How do I bring up my sexu
al needs without seeming overly pre
sumptuous?

Dear Hopelessly Horny-
As Roxy has tried to tell everyone, the
first thing you have to know about your
sexual needs is that YOU always come
first. Don't be ashamed that you want
some too. Roxy sometimes bring up that
touchy subject while in bed. sometimes
playing it off with a little laugh. But it
needs to happen. There are many ways
for him to please you if he is a little
squeamish about using his tongue —
Roxy has met many a man who is skilled
with his fingers.
Sex, on the other hand, is a topic that
you and your partner need to talk about
frankly. He could be shying away from
sex because he isn't sure how you feel.
He, also, could just have a different con
cept than you about the role of sex in
your relationship. This is something to

consider as you go down the road.
Best of Luck,
Roxy Sass
Dear Roxy,
Now that spring is in full swing, I can't
help but notice all the ladies on campus
who are sunbathing in — well, nothing.
There are so many parties during spring
quarter with so many opportunities to
get a little action. J was wondering
whether you think it is better to take a
sampling of Stanford women through a
few one-night stands or to stick to one
girl as the quarter winds down.
Testing the Waters
Dear Testing the Waters-
Roxy knows how you feel. She can't
tell you how many times she's caused
some biker to veer off the road into some
rocks because they're staring at her gor
geous bikini-clad body. Anyways, what
Roxy is trying to say is that spring is the
perfect time for a fling with the girl down
the hallway — all the convenience of
dormcest and you don't have to see them
again after the quarter ends. If you don't
have that special someone lined up. use
the quarter to explore options — college
is one of the only times in your life when
you will have so many opportunities to
get so much ass.
Happy Hunting,
Roxy Sass
