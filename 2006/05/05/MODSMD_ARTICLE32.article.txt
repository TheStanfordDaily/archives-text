# YOU WON'T BE AS 'DIZZY'
## 
### BRIA LONG INTERMISSION DOLL 
It's been a solid four years since
" we've heard from the Goo Goo
Dolls, a band wa band that has been
putting out albums for 20 years.
However, their last album,"Gutter
flower," didn't even come close to
matching the old power of the
' Goos. Their previous effort, "Dizzy
! Up the Girl," remains an un-

I matched classic
with tracks such
as "Black Bal
loon."
With the re
lease of their
, tenth album "Let
_ Love In," the
j Goos have made
somewhat of a
return. While it's
definitely not of

the same caliber as their old al-
I bums, it has the potential to bring
them back for a bit. With catchy
chorus, a less rocked-out feel, more
musical effects and sentimental
- lyrics, a number of these songs feel
like they could be on the radio, even
if they don't stick with you after the
| first play.
While "Stay With You" and
! "Better Days" are advertised as sin
gles, I wouldn't consider them the
best songs on the album. "Better
Days" was actually adopted as a
single for CNN news coverage fol

lowing Hurricane Katrina, express
ing hope in humanity with lyrics,
"And the one poor child who saved
this world /There's 10 million more
who probably c0u1d...1 wish every
one was loved tonight."
"Let Love In," the title track, has
a mellow, sentimental, minor mood
— the kind of song you listen to and
feel like you should connect with it
more than you do. But it's pretty
good — I'd consider it one of the

better tracks on
the album and, at
the very least, it
is worth listening
to.
Like
"Let Love In,"
most of the songs
on this album
have a rather
emotional feel to
them. John

Rzeznik, the lead singer/guitarist,
returned to his hometown of Buffa
lo, N.Y., fleeing what he considered
the strangling, disingenuous atmos
phere of LA to write this album.
For Rzeznik. being home was in
credibly inspirational — this 're
turn to his roots' finally gave him
the push to write new songs. As
Rzeznick himself commented, the
"whole experience of [being home]
opened up my heart... It was good to
feel again. I don't need to feel good
all the time, I just want to be able to
feel." However, Rzeznik and

Rohby Takac, vocalist/bassist,
wrote all 11 tracks together, a
change from their past albums.
The album art features Melanie
Nissin in mostly black and white
photography with blurred effects,
giving it a captivating, subtle and
slightly haunting feel. But for some
reason the music just doesn't do the
same thing. The artwork seems
more reminiscent of their old songs
than these new. more radio-orient- ;
ed ones.
Besides their singles, check out
"Without You Here" and "Can't
Let it Go." "Strange Love" is prob
ably the least accomplished song on
the album; it just doesn't seem to
mesh with the rest of the songs, and
the vocals are scratchier than they i
should be. Hie whole CD is not as
acoustic or as rock oriented as the
Goo Goo Dolls used to be — the
huge power choruses lend it a more
pop feel.
There was something about
songs like "Iris" and "Black Bal
loon" that just grabbed me. made
me stop and hold my breath. Even
now I'm tempted to turn on my old
Goo Goo Dolls songs instead of
their new album. Don't get me
Wrong."Let Love In" is a good step
forward, and when you hear the
new songs on the radio you'll prob
ably think they're okay. But it's just
not the same they don't leave
me "dizzy" like they used to.
