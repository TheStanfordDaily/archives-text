# Live out your Fantasy

### ERIC FORD INTERMISSION CRUSADER 
Looking for the king of pro
crastination during those long
hours of nothingness before writ
ing your paper last minute? Squa
reEnix has the answer for all you
console lovers with the Xbox 360
version of "Final Fantasy XI," one
of the premier massively multi
player online role-playing games
(MMORPG) on the scene before
the advent of "World of Warcraft."
Don't let that title fool you, how
ever, as "FFXI" offers an experi
ence unlike anything "WoW"
could ever impart — with unique
game-play, a beautiful world and a
stunning experience that remains
amazingly well preserved after
several years on the market.
A quick recap for both the
"FF" and MMORPG uninitiated:
The Final Fantasy series, began in
the late 80s. Ever since "Final Fan
tasy VII" was released in the late
90s it has been one of the most
talked about role-playing games
(RPGs) on the market. A combi
nation of a dramatic story, involv
ing game-play and a wonderful
meld of graphics, music and char
acters have made the series the
premiere example of interactive
storytelling through gaming. This
reputation makes its into the
MMO market somewhat of a mys
tery, since these types of games are
usually player driven with less of
an emphasis on story and more on
the actions of actual players in a
dynamic group setting. Also, in
most cases graphics, music and
game-play are sacrificed to attract
and captivate a wider audience

and keep them enthralled.
"Final Fantasy XI" throws this
stereotype out, creating a rich
world that you'll notice immedi
ately notice when you create a new
game. Cities are vast, with so many
non-essential background charac
ters that the city feels alive. They
are part of this fabricated world
and will share their knowledge of
it. There is an amazing array of
game-play options for your char
acter; it's possible to switch to any
job class almost instantaneously,
and to pick up a whole new set of
skills and abilities while storing
everything you earned previously
for later usage. All this, combined
with a great soundtrack that won't
make you want to mute the TV in
frustration.
However, everything is not per
fect in "FFXI" land. TTie game is
notoriously difficult after the first
couple of class levels, meaning
you'll need to find a party and do
your leveling up with people when
possible to prevent a sole tough
enemy from easily kicking your
ass (join my "FFXI" Facebook
group and hopefully we can find
some Stanford players on the
same server). The ability to create
items in game is an arduous task,
especially when combined with
the out of control economy caused
by money traders outside the
game (SquareEnix claims they're
working on this). In addition, the
whole concept of losing some ex
perience (and yes, even the poten
tial to go down a level) when you
die might turn off some players,
but "FFXI" adheres very much to
the Japanese style of video gam
ing; very hard and challenging, but

rewarding in more ways than just
the in-game experience and the
items you acquire when you suc
ceed.
The new Xbox 360 version
looks a lot better than some (not
all) of the PCs out there that can
run this title. Also, the controller is
very well suited to the game-play
of "FFXI " making the experience
pretty easy to get a hang of. How
ever, a keyboard is a must for com
municating in-game so if you have
a spare USB keyboard around,
plug that into the USB port and
you'll be set. Voice-chat support
can only take place within the
Xbox Live voice channels, so there
isn't any special in-game chatting,
but it can still work through Live if
you need it. Other than that, the
game plays exactly like its PC
counterpart, and folks already
playing on the PC version can use
their account on the Xbox (and
vice versa, I just installed it on my
Macßook with Windows to check
it out).
If you're looking for a break from
"World of Warcraft" (like me) or
you just want to try a unique
MMO with a foundation rich in
gaming history, then check out
"Final Fantasy XI." It'll enthrall
you, awe you, and occasionally
frustrate you, but if you stick with
it, a strong character is something
to be proud of in this game.
"Final Fantasy XI" for the 360 is
$49.99 retail and comes with a free
month of game-play ($l3/month
afterwards). The PC versions are
currently $20 for the game and
first two expansion packs and $30
for the new one (the 360 version
comes with all three already).
