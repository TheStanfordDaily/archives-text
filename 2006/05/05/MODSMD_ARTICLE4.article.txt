"I have my own routines that others on the team pick up anc'
tease me for," Rinehart said. "They joke about me always wearing
my jacket. Sometimes it can get really hot and I can be pretty mis
erable, but I won't take it off."
In her three years at Stanford, Rinehart has picked up sever
al other habits, including extra ball tosses in the field and a
unique batter's box warm-up she has owned since her freshman
year. She said such routines keep her relaxed on the field.
Indeed, the superstitions have paid off for Rinehart so far. In
her third season on The Farm, Rinehart s .363 batting average
ranks second on the team and she has notched 11 RBI. Last week

Rinehart began playing ball at an
early age with her dad and brother
— both avid baseball fans and play
ers. It was only natural that the Yan
kees fan would soon pick up a soft
ball.
"I was always on the field watch
ing my older brother's games," Rine
hart said. "I'd toss the ball with him
and my dad, and I always tried to
play with my brother and his friends.
It all led me to learn a lot about life
— commitment, dedication, hard
work. Everything people always talk
about, it's all true."
Rinehart has been constantly ac
tive throughout her lifetime, playing

on as many as five teams at one time.
In high school, she devoted her time
mostly to softhall, volleyball and
basketball.
As for her role on this year's
Stanford squad, Rinehart said she
tries to keep her teammates tough in
stressful situations.
"At this point in the season,every
team is beat-up." she said. "Some
times we'll have a bad game, and I'll
try to keep everyone up by talking
with them. We come out here every
day knowing exactly what we need
to work on and try to be perfect with
everything we do."
Like most athletes at Stanford,
Rinehart said she spends most of her
time with her teammates and is
thankful for the lessons they've
taught her.
"We've had some amazing stu
dents on the team that I've learned a
lot from." Rinehart said. "They
come out here and they're in some

of the hardest majors, and some of
them haven't gotten below an 'A-'
their whole time here.
"Other girls come out here hurt.
Just watching them work as hard as
they do and give more than a hun
dred percent every day is something
that I've looked up to and tried to
emulate in a way," she said.
With Stanford's season winding
down. Rinehart is still looking to im
prove her own skills, determined to
help the team in any way she can.
And with the Cardinal relying so
much on last-second victories lately,
it's her patience that is truly getting
a workout.
"The win is definitely tops each
day," Rinehart said. "It's stressful
when it comes down to the end, but
we stay confident. It's tough to come
back against such amazing pitchers,
and it'll take us a couple of at-bats,
but we try to stay up there the entire
time."
