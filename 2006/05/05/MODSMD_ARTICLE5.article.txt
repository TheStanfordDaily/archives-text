## Jessica Nguyen: STANFORD'S MINI-SENIOR Winning, bonding, and getting punked by the seniors 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
The Daily continues its "Through My
Eyes" series on the women's tennis team
with freshman Jessica Nguyen, fresh off of
her finish as the singles runner-up in the Pac
-10 Invitational last Sunday
Why Stanford?
Obviously everyone has this idea of
Stanford being the all-around greatest
school ever. I had a great time on my re
cruiting trip, and I'd only heard the best
things about the girls on the team, which is
so important with the camaraderie and
everything. I'd also heard great things
about the coaches and the academics, of
course. It was apparent that the girls on the
team were really close, and I talked to girls

on other teams and they said the Stanford
team seems really close. At most schools,
there's a problem with a teammate, and that
really hurts a team because you spend so
much time together. That's one of the great
est things now — I just always have the girls
on the team to be there.
Having a mentor
At the very beginning of the year, Jess
Leek] and Amber [Liu] came up to Megan
Doheny] and me and said/We've decided to
make you our 'minis' because you two are ex
actly like us when we were freshmen.' And
omigod, we really are. A lot of the things
we've done are super-similar — even our
areas of study. It's so great to have someone
like Amber that I can really talk to about
problems I'm running into or anything. A
mentor, almost.
And Megan and Jess are so alikei too.
Their families are really good friends, actual
ly. When they were younger, the three-year
age difference was kind of a big deal, so
they'd see each other and knew each other a
ton but wouldn't really hang out. But now they
are such good friends, really close. It helps that
they're both amazingly nice people!
FVosh bonding
Prior to Stanford, Megan and I had never
run into each other at tournaments and stuff,
even though we're from the same region. But
on the first day of athlete orientation, she came
up and was like, 'Jessica!' and 1 was like,
'Aaaahhh! Megan!' and we just immediately
bonded.
We're always kind of out of it, because as
freshmen we don't really know what's going
on. Like today, Megan had a complete mental
lapse and forgot to go to workout, but I was just
like, 'Ohhh freshmen, you know how it goes.'
We get along so well; she's definitely one of my
best friends here.
Senior pranks
The seniors do play pranks on us. Like for
our flight to Hawaii, the seniors were like. Try
to dress nice because there might be some
alumni there; don't wear jeans.' So our flight is
at like 7 a.m., and I wake up early to get all
dressed up. I'm wearing these wool trouser
pants and nice jacket. And I'm on the Super
Shuttle and we're picking up Jess, and she
comes out with her sweatpants on and I'm like,
'Omigod what is going on.' And they're all like.
'Hahaha,you look so cute.'And then it kills me
because when we get to Hawaii, it's steaming
hot and I'm wearing wool! Oh, and they make
the freshmen carry the ball hoppers, and we
have to check it as our luggage...l can't wait to
do this stuff to the freshmen next year.
My first NCA As
It's pretty intense to be going through my
first NCAAs. I didn't realize what a big deal it
really is until I watched the draw on Wednes
day. I'm really excited. I've kind of experienced
it through my brother, because he's three years
ahead of me and plays for UCLA — and they
won it last year. I didn't get to see it, because I
was in Asia for a tournament at the time, but I
checked the results on the Internet in the lobby
of our hotel and just started screaming with ex
citement for him. Everyone was just looking at
me like.'WTiar are you doing?'
This year, since the men's and women's
tournaments are both here, my brother will be
playing here, too, which will be great. I'll get to
see him and all my friends from juniors who
play for other schools.
The woman behind it all
It's ridiculous. You think coming to Stan
ford, the No. 1 team in the country, things are
going to be run strictly, like this-this-this and
then this every day. But Lele [Forood j is so laid
back and just goes with the flow. Anything
comes at her and she's just like 'Ohhh... okay.' I
think Frankie [Brennan, assistant coach] gets a
little pissed off about it sometimes, but I'd so
much rather have someone like Lele than
someone who's super-anal about things. Al
though now, right before NCAAs, she is getting
a little frantic, which I guess is completely un
derstandable.
