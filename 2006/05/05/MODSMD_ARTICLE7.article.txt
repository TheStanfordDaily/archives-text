## Housing and Dining join Vaden in campus-wide prevention effort Virus spreads to West Campus 
### REVTI GUPTA 
Twenty residents in Lagunita
Court and 25 in Roble Hall have
fallen ill to gastroenteritis, popular
ly known as the stomach flu, about
a week after 14 cases were first re
ported in Toyon Hall. Housing and
dining services have teamed up
with Vaden Health Center in a con
certed effort to control the spread
of infection.
Students reported symptoms in
cluding general malaise, cramps,
vomiting, nausea and diarrhea. One
victim, Lagunita freshman Lauren
Rosas, shared her experience with
The Daily.
"I felt nauseous Friday morning,
and I thought I was getting sick, so 1
had soup and crackers for lunch,"
said Rosas. "Didn't stay down very
long. I couldn't keep down any
thing, not even water. All 1 had was
toast and cereal for three days."
The flu subsides within 24 hours,
with full recovery within a few days.
Vaden advises students to seek
medical advice if the vomiting lasts
longer than six to eight hours, or in
the case of diarrhea, for more than
three days. The infection is usually
not serious, although dehydration
can occur as a result of the loss of
liquids.
"The infection is likely a
Norovirus," said Dr. Robyn Tepper,
director of Medical Services at
Vaden. "It can be spread in several

ways: person to person, infected
droplets in the air and from inani
mate objects.
"Control of the infection has
taken the efforts of many campus
resources," Tepper continued.
"They include Student Housing,
Stanford Dining Services and eat
ing clubs. Health Promotion (in
cluding PHEs), Residential educa
tion (including RAs/RFs) and
Vaden administration. It is a great
example of the power of interdisci
plinary teamwork."
Last Friday, The Daily reported
thatToyon's open kitchen had been
shut down and kitchen staff had
served students instead of the usual
student self-service.
"We have very specific protocols
in such situations," said Rafi Taher
ian, executive director of Stanford
Dining. "All the surfaces of the din
ing halls are being cleaned on an
hourly basis with disinfectant. The
staff and servers sanitize their
hands every half-hour. Disposables
are being used in every dining loca
tion."
The servers have been instruct
ed to squirt hand-sanitizer onto the
hands of every student. Flyers at en
trances list tips for containing the
infection.The dining halls also offer
"sick trays" for students to take
back to friends in the dorm who
have contracted the infection.

Freshman Daryl Zalan checks out Housing and Dining Services' latest addition to Wilbur Dining. The Univer
sity has placed hand sanitizers in dining halls to stem the highly contagious flu spreading on,campus.
Dining services has also replaced
the regular reusable dishes and sil
verware with plastic disposables to
avoid spreading the infection
through contaminated dishes. These
measures have drawn criticism from
environmental activists on campus.
"I have issues with [the dispos
ables]," said one student who wished
to remain anonymous. "The regular
dishes go through the Hobart, which
is about 170 degrees anyway."
The Housing Service Centers are
also working overtime to ensure san
itary conditions in the bathrooms,
which are currently being disinfected
multiple times a day.
"Custodians... are staying until 7
p.m. cleaning bathrooms," wrote Lori
Fuller, Student Housing associate, in
an email sent to residents of Lagunita
earlier this week. Fuller also request
ed that every student use the anti
bacterial sprays and clean-up kits
that have been placed in the bath
rooms.
The Peer Health Educators are
also taking part in the effort, working
with Vaden at the individual dorm
level.
"We've been instructed to inform
Vaden of every case in our respective
dorms," said Anh Pham,a PHE in La
gunita. "We've been following up
with the individual students, making
sure that everything is okay."
The PHEs have also posted in
struction sheets in bathroom stalls
featuring tips on how to avoid and
cure the infection.The suggestions in
clude regular hand-washing, disinfec
tion and avoidance of shared utensils.
So far, the outreach efforts have
met mixed student opinion.
"Posters on diarrhea and vomit
make for a really great read" said jun

ior Marissa Osterkamp.
As for the virus, medical staff says
the effort has proven to be largely
successful
"It appears that these efforts have
made a real impact on the overall
spread of the illness — which is high
ly contagious," said Tepper. "The
number of cases has been decreasing.
Of note to students is that diligent hy

giene is a good practice year round
and also helps prevent the spread of
other infections."
But for sick students, the only ef
fective remedy seemed to be bed rest.
"I felt like I couldn't do anything, I
just felt so useless," said Rosas. "I
couldn't do any homework; I had to
miss classes and work. I just hope no
body else gets sick."
