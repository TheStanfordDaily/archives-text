## Housing and Dining join Vaden in campus-wide prevention effort Virus spreads to West Campus 
### REVTI GUPTA 
Twenty residents in Lagunita
Court and 25 in Roble Hall have
fallen ill to gastroenteritis, popular
ly known as the stomach flu, about
a week after 14 cases were first re
ported in Toyon Hall. Housing and
dining services have teamed up
with Vaden Health Center in a con
certed effort to control the spread
of infection.
Students reported symptoms in
cluding general malaise, cramps,
vomiting, nausea and diarrhea. One
victim, Lagunita freshman Lauren
Rosas, shared her experience with
The Daily.
"I felt nauseous Friday morning,
and I thought I was getting sick, so 1
had soup and crackers for lunch,"
said Rosas. "Didn't stay down very
long. I couldn't keep down any
thing, not even water. All 1 had was
toast and cereal for three days."
The flu subsides within 24 hours,
with full recovery within a few days.
Vaden advises students to seek
medical advice if the vomiting lasts
longer than six to eight hours, or in
the case of diarrhea, for more than
three days. The infection is usually
not serious, although dehydration
can occur as a result of the loss of
liquids.
"The infection is likely a
Norovirus," said Dr. Robyn Tepper,
director of Medical Services at
Vaden. "It can be spread in several

ways: person to person, infected
droplets in the air and from inani
mate objects.
"Control of the infection has
taken the efforts of many campus
resources," Tepper continued.
"They include Student Housing,
Stanford Dining Services and eat
ing clubs. Health Promotion (in
cluding PHEs), Residential educa
tion (including RAs/RFs) and
Vaden administration. It is a great
example of the power of interdisci
plinary teamwork."
Last Friday, The Daily reported
thatToyon's open kitchen had been
shut down and kitchen staff had
served students instead of the usual
student self-service.
"We have very specific protocols
in such situations," said Rafi Taher
ian, executive director of Stanford
Dining. "All the surfaces of the din
ing halls are being cleaned on an
hourly basis with disinfectant. The
staff and servers sanitize their
hands every half-hour. Disposables
are being used in every dining loca
tion."
The servers have been instruct
ed to squirt hand-sanitizer onto the
hands of every student. Flyers at en
trances list tips for containing the
infection.The dining halls also offer
"sick trays" for students to take
back to friends in the dorm who
have contracted the infection.
