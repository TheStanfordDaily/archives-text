## Prof, keeps the beat alive, during surgery Beating heart procedure aims to ditch heart-lung machine 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
At Stanford Hospital, higher-risk pa
tients can reap the benefits of "beating
heart" surgery, an unusual technique that al
lows the heart to keep beating during open
surgery. Kai Ihnken, a clinical assistant pro
fessor of cardiothoracic surgery at the hospi
tal, is one of the few cardiac surgeons capa
ble of performing this surgery without the
aid of a heart-lung machine — known as the
pump — which stops the heart. He has now
successfully performed over 140 bypass sur
geries off-pump and says he plans to never
go back to using it.

Most surgeons still opt for the heart-lung
machine as it makes surgery easier on their
part. The pump artificially sends blood
throughout the body and stops the patients
heart, allowing the surgeon to more conve
niently concentrate on the delicate bypass
surgery. Ihnken, however, has abandoned
the machine and taken on the challenge of
operating on a moving heart for the benefits
of his patients.
The technique of beating heart surgery
places extremely technical demands on sur
geons, but Ihnken said he has been "pleased
with the results and the benefits."
The perks of the technology include re
duced mortality and reduced risk of stroke,
kidney failure and lung damage. Additional
ly, patients often experience improvements
in bleeding, blood transfusion, ventilation
time and a shorter stay in the intensive care
unit. These benefits are especially pro-

For the surgeon, it is more stressful"

nounced in high-risk patients.
"The higher risk the patient is. the more
they benefit." Ihnken said, noting that
women tend to be at higher risk during by
pass surgery than men, for reasons not fully
understood.
Beating heart surgery first appeared
about 40 years ago in small cases until the de
velopment of the heart-lung machine caused

it to fall out of favor among surgeons. It
resurfaced about 10 years ago in South
America, especially in parts of Argentina
and Brazil where doctors lacked sufficient
resources for heart-lung machines. Ihnken
said that the last five years have experienced
a real push for off-pump surgery, and that
about 20 percent of bypass surgeries
are now done off-pump.
"It hasn't really taken off because it
is very technically demanding for the
surgeon," he said.'i don't think the es
tablished generation of surgeons will
adopt it but we will train upcoming
doctors to do it so it will increase."
Ihnken taught himself to do off
pump bypass surgery about a year
and a half ago when he was working
at UC-San Diego. Asked about the
difficulty of learning such a challeng
ing technique, he said, "If you are
committed and really want it and
take the time, it is not too bad. You
have to be really committed and not
get frustrated or impatient."
Ihnken said he couldn't think of

any patients who would suffer from
off-pump surgery.
"For patients, off-pump surgery
has only benefits," he said. "For the
surgeon, it is more stressful."
When doing bypass surgeries,
Ihnken has the heart-lung machine
and room available in case he needs
it. which happens about three per
cent of the time, he said.
Ihnken is a big proponent of the
off-pump process and would like to
see it become more prevalent, and is
pushing Stanford as an off-pump
center. He said that few other hospi
tals have a real off-pump program
and that most just do occasional off
pump surgeries on the side, approxi
mately for 5-10 percent of their total
bypass surgeries.
"We want people to know that it is
available here and that we are com
mitted to it, that we don't just do it on
the side," he said. "We want to attract
more high-risk patients.
