## Prof, keeps the beat alive, during surgery Beating heart procedure aims to ditch heart-lung machine 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
At Stanford Hospital, higher-risk pa
tients can reap the benefits of "beating
heart" surgery, an unusual technique that al
lows the heart to keep beating during open
surgery. Kai Ihnken, a clinical assistant pro
fessor of cardiothoracic surgery at the hospi
tal, is one of the few cardiac surgeons capa
ble of performing this surgery without the
aid of a heart-lung machine — known as the
pump — which stops the heart. He has now
successfully performed over 140 bypass sur
geries off-pump and says he plans to never
go back to using it.

Most surgeons still opt for the heart-lung
machine as it makes surgery easier on their
part. The pump artificially sends blood
throughout the body and stops the patients
heart, allowing the surgeon to more conve
niently concentrate on the delicate bypass
surgery. Ihnken, however, has abandoned
the machine and taken on the challenge of
operating on a moving heart for the benefits
of his patients.
The technique of beating heart surgery
places extremely technical demands on sur
geons, but Ihnken said he has been "pleased
with the results and the benefits."
The perks of the technology include re
duced mortality and reduced risk of stroke,
kidney failure and lung damage. Additional
ly, patients often experience improvements
in bleeding, blood transfusion, ventilation
time and a shorter stay in the intensive care
unit. These benefits are especially pro-

For the surgeon, it is more stressful"

"The higher risk the patient is. the more
they benefit." Ihnken said, noting that
women tend to be at higher risk during by
pass surgery than men, for reasons not fully
understood.
Beating heart surgery first appeared
about 40 years ago in small cases until the de
velopment of the heart-lung machine caused

it to fall out of favor among surgeons. It
resurfaced about 10 years ago in South
America, especially in parts of Argentina
and Brazil where doctors lacked sufficient
resources for heart-lung machines. Ihnken
said that the last five years have experienced
a real push for off-pump surgery, and that
