# FELLOWSHIPS
## Ten tapped for Stegner Fellowships Candidates chosen from a pool of over 1,000 
### JENNIFER CHIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After surviving an acceptance rate that
would make even Stanford students cringe,
the winners of the 2006-2007 Wallace Steg
ner Fellowships were announced last week
by the University's Creative Writing De
partment. This year, 1,308 writers from 16
countries applied for ten fellowship posi
tions — an acceptance rate of less than 1
percent. All decisions were made by Cre
ative Writing faculty.
Fellows chosen for fiction writing in
cluded Molly Antopol-Johnson (Brooklyn,
NY), Bruce "Skip" Horack (Baton Rouge,
LA), Stacey Swann (Austin, TX), Joshua
Tyree (Brooklyn, NY) and Abigail Ulman
(Melbourne, Australia).
The fellows named for poetry were
Kirsten Anderson (New York, NY), An
drew Grace (TUcson, AZ), Jill McDonough
(NY), Michael McGriff (Coos Bay, OR)
and Alexandra Teague (San Francisco,
CA).
"Every year [the number] goes up a bit,"
said Eavan Boland, director of the Creative
Writing Program and a member of the se
lection committee. "In both fiction and po
etry, it was a very strong pool. We were
struck by that."
The Wallace Stegner Fellowship was
founded in the 1940s and is named after the
founder of the Stanford Writing Program.
According to the program office, past Steg
ner Fellows include renowned authors such
as Larry McMurtry, Julie Orringer and To
bias Wolff. Wolff now teaches at Stanford
and also facilitates Stegner workshops.
Fellows come to Stanford with plans to
complete one major project, and this year's
fellows have expressed a variety of goals.
Antopol-Johnson, for example, plans to
arrange a short story collection set in the
Middle East, Eastern Europe and the U.S.
Swann, on the other hand, is set to begin a
historical novel about a Texas Ranger.
Most of the poets expect to begin work on
a book-length poetry manuscript.
During each week of their two-year stay,
fellows attend a poetry or fiction workshop
where they share and receive criticism on
their work from their colleagues and a fac
ulty member.
Fellows also receive a $22,000 yearly
stipend. Administrative Assistant Ryan Ja
cobs said he thinks this stipend is one of the
factors that makes the Stegner Fellowship
so competitive and sets it apart from others.
"I'm pretty sure it's the largest [writing]
stipend in the country," he said. "And as a
result, the fellowship is very selective. The
quality of writing we accept is so high. And
our faculty is great too; they're all practi
tioners [and] are well respected in their
communities. The quality of the program
on both sides of the coin makes it so
unique."
The competitive nature of the fellow
ship forces the faculty selection committee
to focus on two key elements in ap
plications.
"We always look for the quality of
the writing of the work itself and how
it speaks to us," Boland said. "It's
someone's voice, it's their experience,
it's their intensity. Then we have to
think, how will [the applicant] do
here? What can we do for them?"
As a result, faculty members look
for writers who have already estab
lished their own voice and have
reached a point of independence.
"We don't have a locked-in or nar
row sense of what [fellows] should be
writing or how they should write,"
Boland said. "We want them to be in

dependent, be strong in their choices.
This program just gives shelter and
time to people in the most critical
time of developing a project."
Added Jacobs, "We want [fel
lows] to be writing all the time and
honing their ideas."
Time is an important concept not
only for administrators, but also for
the fellows themselves. Tom Kealey,
a Stegner Fellow from 2001 to 2003,
called it the "greatest of gifts" for
writers to "write, read, work and be
around other writers and artists.
"It's not the easiest thing, being a
writer, and the Stegner Fellowship
creates a valuable community to en

courage us to keep writing and
learning," he wrote in an email to
The Daily.
Kealey, who has had his short sto
ries printed in a variety of publica
tions and is now a Jones Lecturer in
the Creative Writing Program — an
opportunity available to completed
fellows — is just one example of
how a Stegner Fellow can make use
of their time on campus to develop
and succeed as a writer.
As the Creative Writing Program's
director. Boland has similar hopes of
success for this year's fellows.
"We're very proud of this com
munity of young writers," she said.
