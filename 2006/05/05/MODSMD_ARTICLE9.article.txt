# FELLOWSHIPS
## Ten tapped for Stegner Fellowships Candidates chosen from a pool of over 1,000 
### JENNIFER CHIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After surviving an acceptance rate that
would make even Stanford students cringe,
the winners of the 2006-2007 Wallace Steg
ner Fellowships were announced last week
by the University's Creative Writing De
partment. This year, 1,308 writers from 16
countries applied for ten fellowship posi
tions â€” an acceptance rate of less than 1
percent. All decisions were made by Cre
ative Writing faculty.
Fellows chosen for fiction writing in
cluded Molly Antopol-Johnson (Brooklyn,
NY), Bruce "Skip" Horack (Baton Rouge,
LA), Stacey Swann (Austin, TX), Joshua
Tyree (Brooklyn, NY) and Abigail Ulman
(Melbourne, Australia).
The fellows named for poetry were
Kirsten Anderson (New York, NY), An
drew Grace (TUcson, AZ), Jill McDonough
(NY), Michael McGriff (Coos Bay, OR)
and Alexandra Teague (San Francisco,
CA).
"Every year [the number] goes up a bit,"
said Eavan Boland, director of the Creative
Writing Program and a member of the se
lection committee. "In both fiction and po
etry, it was a very strong pool. We were
struck by that."
The Wallace Stegner Fellowship was
founded in the 1940s and is named after the
founder of the Stanford Writing Program.
According to the program office, past Steg
ner Fellows include renowned authors such
as Larry McMurtry, Julie Orringer and To
bias Wolff. Wolff now teaches at Stanford
and also facilitates Stegner workshops.
Fellows come to Stanford with plans to
complete one major project, and this year's
fellows have expressed a variety of goals.
Antopol-Johnson, for example, plans to
arrange a short story collection set in the
Middle East, Eastern Europe and the U.S.
Swann, on the other hand, is set to begin a
historical novel about a Texas Ranger.
Most of the poets expect to begin work on
a book-length poetry manuscript.
During each week of their two-year stay,
fellows attend a poetry or fiction workshop
where they share and receive criticism on
their work from their colleagues and a fac
ulty member.
Fellows also receive a $22,000 yearly
stipend. Administrative Assistant Ryan Ja
cobs said he thinks this stipend is one of the
factors that makes the Stegner Fellowship
so competitive and sets it apart from others.
"I'm pretty sure it's the largest [writing]
stipend in the country," he said. "And as a
result, the fellowship is very selective. The
quality of writing we accept is so high. And
our faculty is great too; they're all practi
tioners [and] are well respected in their
communities. The quality of the program
on both sides of the coin makes it so
unique."
