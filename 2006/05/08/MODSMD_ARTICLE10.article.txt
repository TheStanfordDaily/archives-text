# Greek Myth REMADE
## Cast of "Phedre" has worked to create an action-packed, standout production 
### DEBORAH SOHN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A queen falls in love with her stepson while her
husband is thought to he dead. Drama unfolds when
it is revealed that he is actually alive.
This twist is the premise of Jean Racine's play

"Phedre," which the Drama Department will per
form May 10 to 13 in Memorial Hall's Pigott The
ater. Racine, a 17th-century French dramatist, wrote
the play in French Alexandrine verse and based part
of it on Euripides' "Hippolytys."

The Drama Department's Web site describes
the work as "Racine's version of the Greek myth:

a study in obsession, betrayal, power and honor."
Though the play is more than 3()0 years old, this
performance promises to be unique and origi
nal in many ways.

For one, the cast will use a blank verse trans
lation in place of an Alexandrine one. Second
\ year drama graduate student lleana Drino
.l van says it was difficult to translate the origi
i nal Alexandrine verse into easily under
-1 standable English. She also explains that the
\ translation they are using is shorter than the
original text, as well as "more action-orient-
J ed, instead of speech-oriented."
Drinovan says she hopes these changes
W will make the play more exciting and com
prehensible for the audience.
Aside from the new translation. Drinovan
says Stanford's production is special because
of its original soundtrack, made specifically for
this performance by Lance Herrington. a pro
fessional sound designer in New York. Music
from the soundtrack will play throughout the
performance.

Eight actors make up the cast of"Phedre"
— five undergraduate students, two graduate

students and one professional outsider. One
of these cast members is senior Sarah Wil
son, a drama major who will be playing the
role of Aricia. Wilson says the cast for
"Phedre" is fairly small, and emphasizes
that getting to know everyone and be
\ coming comfortable with everyone was
\ very important.
\ Drinovan says she agrees, adding
r that the play "depends on very strong
ensemble work" and requires an "ex-
I tremely tight-knit group." Throughout
I the process, she says she has tried to
I bring together a very coherent cast
F group.
In addition to the actors, there are sev
eral crew members who are crucial to the
production of the show. Some of them give
the cast members voice coaching and move
ment workshops, which Wilson says are par
ticularly helpful because the play consists of
a lot of "unique movements" — something
really "unusual for a classical play."
Drinovan also highlights the significance
of these coaches and says they were instru
mental in allowing "the poetry to come out
through the actions of the cast."
Wilson says that it is very important to
communicate with the audience and de
scribes the show as "pretty simplistic, with a
bare set and plain costumes. [This is to en
sure that] nothing is in the way between
m the actors and the audience."
The cast and crew have been work
ing on this production since the begin
ning of April, and put in an average of
four hours of rehearsal time each day, ac
cording to Drinovan.

Wilson, who has been very involved
in theater for many years, says that
she particularly appreciates plays

at Stanford because of the "un
orthodox takes on different
plays." For example, she dis
cusses the "unusual styles of di
rection and unusual costumes"
that are common at Stanford.

The production of Racine's
"Phedre" this week will surely be
no exception.
