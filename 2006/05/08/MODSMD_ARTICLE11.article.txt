# Dorm life plays crucial role in transfer students' adjustment to the Farm
## 
### PAM SUD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the class of 2010 arrives next fall, so will
a small contingent of sophomores and juniors
admitted to fill Stanford's few transfer spots.
Next year, the new crop of transfers will have
different homes at Stanford due to a few
housing assignment changes.
This year, transfers — who make up any
where from 20 to 65 members of the new stu
dent population — were split between Ar
royo and Twain, both four-class houses on
East Campus. Next year, Soto and TYancos
will receive transfers instead of Arroyo, and
Arroyo will be an upper-class only house. Ac
cording to Director of Residential Education
and Student Affairs Jane Camarillo, ResEd
wants to ensure that transfers are in a dorm
with the same staff makeup as in previous
years — resident assistants (RAs), a head
peer academic coordinator (HPAC) and a
peer health educator (PHE).
Junior Kenneth Shaw, who will be an RA
in Soto next year,says he's looking forward to

having transfers in his house.
"I think transfers will add great diversity to
the dorm ," Shaw explains. "Transfers have
valuable experiences from other colleges they
can share with the dorm. I'm very excited."
Aaron Kabaker, a junior who transferred
to Stanford in 2(X)3, was placed in Twain.
"My first year here is very difficult to sum
up in one all-encompassing motif" Kabaker
says. "For transfers, you feel torn between
wanting to fit in at this new school with all
these new traditions and not wanting to be
like a freshman all over again."
The University tries hard to accommodate
both freshmen and transfers during the New
Student Orientation (NSO) — yet some
transfers say they feel that NSO simply isn't
built for them.
"When speakers address the NSO popula
tion with. 'Welcome freshmen and transfers,'
it feels odd being accorded that much recog
nition since we comprise such a small fraction
of the incoming class," Kabaker explains.
For Kabaker. the tension regarding
whether to join in with the freshmen or re

main aloof was at its highest when T\vain went
fountain-hopping during NSO.
"1 felt awkward engaging in the reckless en
deavor at the time but looking back that is
what helped ease the transition." Kabaker
says.
When senior Regan Johnson transferred
from Yale, she was placed in Freshman /
Sophomore College (FroSoCo).
"It was a really bad place to live as a trans
fer because it is isolated and had very few
sophomores," Johnson explains. "1 moved to
Toyon in January, which I loved."
Stanford received much constructive criti
cism from transfer students, and decided not
to place transfers in FroSoCo the following
years.
In past years, Toyon and Kimball housed
transfers. Kabaker views these residences as
ideal transfer housing.
"Kimball was a welcome breather for trans
fers who enjoyed larger rooms and a quieter
transition," Kabaker says. "Also, some of the
best stories I've heard [about adjusting to
Stanford) came from the transfers who began

Stanford in Toyon."
Kabaker says he encourages ResEd to put
transfers there.
Every transfer has a different set of reasons
for deciding to come to the Farm. Kabaker
says he wanted to broaden his academic and
social options. For Johnson, it was for current
senior Brian Bergmark. her high school
boyfriend who started his college career at
Stanford.
"After our freshman years in college. Brian
applied to Yale and I applied to Stanford in an
effort to be together," Johnson explains. "Three
years later. Brian and I are still together."
Johnson also says Stanford was a good
choice because she found her niche in the
Human Biology Program. She realized she
could couple studies in Human Biology with
research in global health and studying abroad
— something that would have been signifi
cantly more difficult at Yale.
"The best part about Stanford is its progres
sive mindset, whether it is offering interdisci
plinary programs, encouraging international
study or pushing students to contribute to re

search." Johnson says. "Stanford does not
have 300-year-old traditions that exist at a
place like Yale, which can he a good thing."
Still, Kabaker says that at times,he has found
it difficult to get on track with his peers that
have been on the Farm since freshman year.
"I've always been playing catch-up,"
Kabaker explains. "Especially if you switch
majors, you're constantly having to fulfill
lower requirements before getting up to pace
with your class year."
'I\vain was especially important for Kabak
er because it was the part of Stanford where
he felt most included and adjusted.
"My RAs — not to mention my resident
fellows — took a very active role in learning
who I was and what made me tick," Kabaker
says. His experiences led him to return to
Twain as an RA this year.
According to ResEd, next year's transfers
will get the same perks as transfers in previ
ous years have — extra time to declare a
major, two or three full years of preferred
housing, no I HUM and no Program in Writ
ing and Rhetoric 2.
