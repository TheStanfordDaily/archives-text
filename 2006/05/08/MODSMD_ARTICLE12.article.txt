## Editorial Housing's master plan 
### 
The University's plan for revamping the
housing system — named the Housing
Master Plan — finally seems to be un
derway ("Housing overhaul gains steam,"
April 25). The plan, which will focus on creat
ing better housing for upperclassmen, has had
many improvements since it was first pro
posed last year.
One of the most laudable aspects of the
plan (and probably the only one current un
dergraduates will actually see implemented)
is the reworking of the Draw process. The Ed
itorial Board was thrilled to learn that the
University plans to create a three-tiered
Draw system — 0-1,000, 1,000-2,000 and
2,000-3,000 — guaranteeing students one
year in each tier. The difference between
housing that generally falls in the first tier ver
sus that which falls in the second tier is sub
stantial. This new system will eliminate the
possibility of receiving a number in the 1900s
during both preferred years.
The Board is also excited about the plan to
"unstufT Lagunita, Mirrielees and Branner.
The Lagunita mini-doubles will be converted
into singles, while triples in Mirrieless and
Branner will become doubles. This change
will give upperclassmen a better chance of
obtaining a single, which most students list as
a top priority.
To further alleviate the housing crunch,
the plan includes proposals for the transfor
mation of Crothers and Crothers Memorial
dormitories into undergraduate housing, and
Branner into an upperclass residence. Some
— believing that upperclass dormitories are
unattractive options to most students, who
prefer to live either on the Row or in Suites to
avoid dining halls — have complained that
this change is unnecessary. The Board, how
ever, feels that enough students would be
willing to get stuck with a meal plan in ex
change for a single that the conversion of
these dorms is warranted.
Furthermore, students who do prefer
Row houses or Suites to the dorm environ

ment will still have those options available to
them. The Master Plan even includes a pro
posal for a new Row house — the Green
Dorm — and another Suites type residence
on East campus, giving these students even
more of what they want. Likewise, those who
prefer the quiet atmosphere of a Manzanita
type upperclass dormitories will also have
more options.
Other students have objected to breaking
the tradition of having Branner be the fresh
man dorm. But the freshmen who will actual
ly be affected by this change will have likely
never even heard of this tradition, and will not
mourn its loss. Also, with the University's plan
to cluster all freshman housing together — all
residences in Wilbur, Stern and FloMo (with
the exception of theme dormitories) will be
turned into all-freshman housing — the
Branner experience will likely be recreated
by the large gatherings of freshmen within
these three locales.
The Board is also enthusiastic about the
University's decision to keep Roble a four
class dormitority giving incoming freshmen
the chance to choose which housing option
will suit them best. Roble, because of its large
size and number of freshman, seems the obvi
ous choice to remain four-class housing.
The most controversial aspect of the Mas
ter Plan seems to be Ujamaa's proposed
move to Flo Mo. While the Board does not see
any particular problems with the move —
apart from the fact that the previously unified
residence will now be separated in two — we
also fail to see any benefit it will have. We do,
however, commend the University for listen
ing to and taking into consideration student
opinion on this issue.
While Stanford's housing system will still
have many drawbacks (to be covered in to
morrow's edit), the Housing Master Plan
seems to be a step in the right direction. We
applaud the University's proposal and only
hope that this plan will actually become a
reality.
