# Working out the Draw-ma
## 
### 
It's here. For those of us who didn't end up
in a fraternity or sorority, the most impor
tant number we will ever have is just a cou
ple days away
Thankfully, we've made it past the Draw
group-forming stage, which felt a bit like sen
ior prom. The awkward questions everyone
wondered: "Sure we're friends, but can we be
something more? How do I ask? And what if
they say no!?" Believe it or not, that heart
wrenching drama of choosing which friends
you liked most was only the beginning of the
Draw process. Now comes the part that really
matters — the assignment of the Draw num
ber. The less informed among you probably
believe that this can just be left to chance, and
that is why you will be drawing near 2,(XX), de
spite using your preferred year.
Only a loser would leave the determining
factor of where he lives next year up to chance.
In the next few days, you must do everything
possible to increase your luck. I personally
have taken it upon myself to make a concert
ed effort to eat Lucky Charms every morning,
raid banks looking for heads-up pennies, steal
horseshoes from the Equestrian Team and cut
off the feet of any rabbits I spot. I've made
pretty good progress so far, but since there are
eight people in my draw group, we're going to
need extra luck. The rest of my group is cur
rently on a plane to Ireland to scour the hills
and valleys for four-leaf clovers and lep
rechauns.
I've also instructed them to search for pots
of gold at the end of rainbows in case we do get
a bad number, because we'll need something
with which to bribe school officials. If you're
concerned about bribery violating the Funda
mental Standard, remember that our Univer
sity was founded on profits reaped by exploit
ing Chinese rail workers. Contributions to the
pockets of our housing administrators will cer
tainly not raise as many moral qualms as Stan
ford's history does.
But as confident as I am in my ability to
garner luck, I am just as confident that most
of you will fail to do so (we can't all draw
number one like my group will). If only all
housing were created equal. However, some
of us will end up in Bob while others will
waste away in Stern. But perhaps that's part

of the sick appeal of the Draw process. No
matter who you are — varsity athlete, ingen
ious mathematician or Prince of Saudi Ara
bia— you get a number and you're stuck
with it. It's like Stanford's subtle way of re
minding all of us that no matter how hard we
work and how unique we think we are, the
world does not give a damn.
But once you get your number, the draw is
still not done. Now you need to make the
housing rankings that determine where you'll
live. Most people regard this step as easy and
straightforward, making decisions based on
the cutoff rates from previous years. Though
these low numbers may reflect that some Row
houses are better than others because of loca
tion, accommodations or certain chefs, we
should realize that each year it's mainly a
bunch of random kids who live in the house.
This means that what is a good house this year
could be a bad house next year in terms of per
sonality. It's up to you to make wherever you
live so fun that everyone will want to live there
next year. Then you can make people endure
backbreaking tasks by telling them you'll give
them priority for your house. This is even
more fun to do when you live in a house that
doesn't actually offer anyone priority.
All I can say to whomever draws 1,999 is to
celebrate as if that was what you had wanted
all along. At least you're still with the friends
you have in your draw group (unless you drew
alone and got 1,999, then wow, that just sucks).
And even though Mirrielees is by Escondido
Village, at least you've got a kitchen and your
own bathroom — and you can look forward
to staying in touch with your friends in nicer
housing so that you can visit them often.

If you draw number one, make fun of Aaron Q
