# At the CIA company picnic
## 
### 
Porter Goss, director of the CIA, re
signed Friday. Initially, there was no of
ficial reason given for his departure. He
joins a growing list of top administrative of
ficials who have resigned in recent months.
But Goss' resignation points out something
more troubling: There are problems with the
CIA. We just can't know about them.
But hey, I'm an optimist. With the ClA's
tradition of secrecy, can we even assume
there are problems? Maybe everything is
spiffy, the company softball team just beat
the Department of Transportation at the an
nual staff barbeque, little Johnny Smith was
there with his loving parents John and Jane
in an isolated field at a nondescript location.
I imagine CIA company BBQs are just like
every other company BBQ except every car
in the lot is black and for security purposes
everyone wears a paper bag over their head.
Karl Rove is not invited.
At this year's company picnic, maybe
Goss announced that he wanted to spend
more time pursuing his hobby of and
bonding with his children and .
Maybe it's like former EPA Administrator
Christie Whitman, who wanted to spend
time with her kids. Hopefully it's not like
EPA Administrator Christie Whitman who
resigned because this administration would
n't let her do her job.
Maybe Goss got into a little altercation at
the picnic. Intelligence Czar John Negro
ponte thought that there were too many wild
drinkers during the potato sack race and,
being a bit of a sour-puss, wanted some of
them to be moved to the FBI or NSA. Goss
was against the change, jokingly saying he
didn't want any analysts "outsourced," be
cause although Agent Thompson can seem
like an ass when he gets booze in him, he re
ally is a top-notch analyst when it comes to
Iraq. He was only a little off on the WMD
thing. And while Agent Johnson hasn't been

able to locate bin Laden, he's been going
through some troubled times and he'll get on
it after he comes back from vacation. I think
Goss was saying that after so many recent
failures, reducing the CIA staff might not be
the best idea.
Maybe the CIA company picnic was a
happy affair because nothing really changed
administratively and Goss came across as
just a bit more paranoid than Tenet, their
previous boss. So it was business as usual for
the CIA — even if President George W.
Bush had been saying the CIA would be
completely overhauled and it seems a bit pe
culiar that the president who is supposed to
be keeping us safe can't keep a steady leader
at the helm of one of our security agencies.
See, we never get to see the CIA company
picnic. We have no idea what problems plague
the CIA. If Goss was an incompetent leader,
why was he there at all? What were the things
he failed to do? Why hasn't anything changed
since Tenet resigned? Is it mere coincidence
that the caterpillars showed up on campus
right before Bush arrived?
While the American public demands an
swers for why the Brad Pitt / Jennifer Anis
ton marriage ended, it doesn't seem to care
that administrators in our government are
dropping faster than my popularity with Pi
Phis (see "To Chuck and Hunter with love,"
Feb. 13).
The CIA, rightfully so, is cloaked in se
crecy. But we are never given the real rea

sons for why these people, whether CIA or
upper-tier administrators, are leaving. I
mean, aside from one of the Kennedys,
when "checking into rehab" is actually
probably "checking into rehab."
Maybe they need more team-building
exercises. Imagine the progress our politi
cians and CIA spooks will undergo when
they go on holiday together for some exer
cises in listening. They know how to listen to
the secret codes of our nation's enemies, but
have they listened to their hearts? I think if
they try some falling-backward-into-each
other's-arms exercises, they could really
begin to trust one another. I mean, it's their
job not to trust people, but you should trust
your co-workers enough so you can work
with them while still knowing how to kill
them if they leak secrets. If it works for to
bacco companies, it can work for the CIA.
Perhaps in the ClA's line of work, you
can't trust anyone — so why should they
trust the big guy in charge? The problem
arises when the rest of the American public
reflects the same cloak-and-dagger attitude
of our secretive organization. If we aren't
secure in trusting our government, why
should we expect our administrators to do
the same? And while Bush is likely to ap
point General Michael Hayden, the most
visible supporter of the illegal wiretapping
program, do we really think Americans are
going to become more or less trustful in the
future? Shouldn't we worry that the military
mindset is now in charge of the CIA, a tradi
tionally civilian-lead organization? Maybe
this entire country needs some team-build
ing exercises. I'll be calling in sick that day,
though. The government lost my trust fall
long ago.

Chris hoped beltane would take some of the
edge off his sarcasm. Nope. Send complaints to
