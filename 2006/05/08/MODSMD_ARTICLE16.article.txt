## Rugby wins national title Card defend title against Penn State, 15-12, on winning try in injury time 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
For Stanford women's rugby, the night
mare was coming true. Just seconds separated
the Cardinal from a heartbreaking 12-10 na
tional title loss to archrival Penn State, and the
Lions were running those final ticks off the
clock.
"I was already crying because I thought we
had lost, "junior Jennifer Hernandez said.
Even after a Penn State penalty, Stanford
still looked to be on its deathbed. A sudden
gusty wind made attempting a kick too risky,
so the Cardinal had no choice but to turn to
senior Victoria Folayan, who was facing the
teeth of the Penn State defense.
But in her last moments as a Stanford
rugby player, Folayan made a run for the ages.

"The minute it got in her hands, everyone
knew she was going to score," Hernandez
said. "She just ran straight past the defense."
For Folayan though, the final try wasn't so
much predestined as it was a dizzying combi
nation of fear and blind luck.
"There was no hole and 1 got really
scared," Folayan said. "When I get scared I
run a lot faster, so 1 bounced to the outside
and started sprinting. I didn't even know what
happened but then all my teammates jumped
me. It was really magical."
And when fans and the band wasted no
time storming Stueber Field to celebrate the
15-12 victory that clinched a second straight
Stanford national title, the team simply could
n't believe its eyes.
"We're still in shock that it happened," said
Folayan of the championship. "That 1 made
the last try, that whole last moment — it's still
cloudy in my mind. I still kind of dream about
it."
Even for a national title game, this victory
was especially sweet. En route to the 2(X)4
championship, Penn State eliminated Stan

ford in the Sweet 16, and the Card repaid the
favor with a 52-6 shellacking in last year's title
game.
So this year, the Lions hung the photo of
Stanford celebrating last year's title in its
locker room, and spent the entire season
preparing for Stanford, according to Hernan
dez.
"They actually trained all year to play us
and to stop our game," Hernandez said. "TTiey
did an amazing job blocking our passes and
that made the difference because they knew
our game inside and out."
But after freshman Mae Ryan set the stage
with two early tries, Penn State could only
watch helplessly as Folayan ran away from the
defense — and into Stanford lore.
"I'm so happy for the team, and I don't be
lieve it was me," Folayan said. "I just had to
wait for my moment and trust that my mo
ment would come."
Extra:\n Friday's semifinal, Stanford
knocked off Navy 45-12 to reach Saturday's
championship match. Senior Angela Steele
earned MVP honors for the Final Four.
