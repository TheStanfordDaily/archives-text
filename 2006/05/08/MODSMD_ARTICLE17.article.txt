# This column is not about hockey

### 
Okay, so this article might be about
hockey, but that does not mean you
have to turn the page so soon! I
have been strongly advised not to write,
speak or even think about the NHL here at
the Daily because nobody cares.
Well, I care. And I know that there is at
least one Canadian in my dorm who cares
too. So, for those of you who turn your nose
at America's other, other, other, other fa
vorite pastime, here is your chance to get
caught up because here is where 1 put my
foot down and give up the opportunity to
write about Lakers/Suns or Wizards/Cavs.
Forget the Kentucky Derby and Bush
bashing (no, I'm not talking about the Pres
ident, but rather I'm talking about the
other stupid Texans). Yes, that's right folks:
it's hockey time.
Let's start with the Stanford Ice Hockey
season. Actually, let's not.The team's strug
gles are only indicative of how much sup
port they get from the student body.
Yet, if performance in hockey depended
on community support, how is it that the
Tampa Bay Lightning are the Cup's de
fending champions?
One place that you might be getting
caught up on hockey is the Merc. Complete
coverage of San Jose's largest sports team
is well deserved for the Sharks, who are
looking like strong Cup contenders. The
team has won four straight coming into the
second round series against Edmonton,
and 12 of its last 14 since the start of April.
As the fifth seed, the Sharks are actual
ly the highest seeded team in the West as
the 5-8 seeds knocked out the top four
seeds in a shockingly spectacular first
round.
But the first round is done and we are
moving on. And all of those who say hock
ey is no fun did not see the first game of the
Buffalo/Ottawa second round series.
Down 5-4 with three minutes left in the
game, Buffalo knotted things up on a mira
cle shorthanded goal, only to lose the lead
seconds later on the same Ottawa power
play. Buffalo tied it again with 11 seconds
left in regulation, and went on to win 7-6
with a sudden-death goal 18 seconds into
overtime.
That's almost as high scoring as the
NBA.
But if defense is your fancy, then the
Anaheim Mighty Ducks are your team.
They have not allowed a goal in three
games — that is almost an entire playoff
series. Personally, I am hoping for a Cali
fornia Western Conference showdown —
Ducks vs. Sharks. Maybe I will even find
someone on this campus who will be will
ing to go with me to a game, or maybe I am
better off just waiting for the Sharks to
make the finals.
Playoffs are not the only thing going on
in hockey right now either.The NHL has a
heated MVP race of its own. Old-timer
Jaromir Jagr — the New York Ranger's
leading scorer by 44 points — is up against
Joe Thorton who, after being traded to San
Jose from Boston in an absolutely shocking
exchange, has been an invaluable leader to
the red-hot Sharks as they work their way
down the stretch.
But the most exciting thing you have
missed out on this year if you have not been
following hockey is the fabulous rookie tal
ent. Alexander Ovechkin's 52 goals and
106 points have left him in an elite scoring
category for rookies, joining only Teemu

The Turnaround
Selanne in the 50/50 club. Besides
Ovechkin, the rookie class of 2006
includes the famous Sidney Crosby,
defender Dion Phaneuf and goal
tender of the year finalist Henrik
Lundqvist.
Although hockey is just heating
up, I am disappointed not to see
more enthusiasm from the Stanford
community.
Of course, besides my editor, my
mommy and the Canadian upstairs,
I doubt anyone has even read this
far into my column. But if you are
one of the few, let's see you give the
NHL some love! Go Sharks!
