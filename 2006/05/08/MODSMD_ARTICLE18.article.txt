# Baseball takes two from Bears
## Reynolds throws his second-straight complete game in Friday night's win 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
'Hie groundball. That's all sopho
more pitcher Erik Davis was thinking
about with a bases-loaded, one-out
situation yesterday. The groundball
double-play.
California had already come one
run closer to the Cardinal, 6-4, in that
ninth inning, the Bears' best hitter
Allen Craig had just singled to load
the bases and their No. 3 hitter Chris
Errecart was at the plate. Adding to
the drama was the importance of a
Pac-10 series for the Cardinal, a must
win on Sunday.
But, suddenly. Davis 1 thoughts
came to fruition. Errecart hit Davis'
fastball to third baseman Randy
Molina, who threw the runner out at
home. A quick turn and throw by
catcher Brian Juhl and Errecart was
out at first.
"I knew I could get a ground ball
for a double play," said Davis, who
threw his cap to the ground and
pumped his chest before being
mobbed by a slew of Cardinal players
along the first-base line. "Without
that we would have gotten one out
and who knows what the next guy
[junior centerfielder Brennan
Boesch] would have done, because
he's a good hitter too."
The Cardinal's postseason hopes
stayed alive with the 6-4 win, as they
took the series from Cal. They have
two remaining conference series this
season — next week at Washington
and the following weekend at UCLA.
Stanford got out of the dramatic
jam in the ninth, but it wasn't the only
time the double play saved the Cardi
nal.
In the fifth inning, with Stanford
up 4-2, Craig led off the inning with a
homerun off of starter Matt Manship
(2-5). Errecart and Boesch picked up
consecutive hits with no outs to put
runners at second and third.
But with Josh Satin, the go-ahead
run, at the plate, freshman Jeremy
Bleich managed to get the second of
three Stanford double plays of the
day.
Smart defense by the Cardinal re
sulted in two run-downs, along the
third-base line and between second
and third.
Molina saw Errecart break out of
the corner of his eye and immediately

Stanford win. The righty outdueled Cal's Brandon Morrow for the win.
threw to the plate. Juhl ran up the
line to get the tag, keeping his ears
open for senior second baseman
Chris Lewis who was calling out for
him. With a long dive towards third
base, Lewis finished the play by tag
ging Boesch out.
"That was huge spot," said Lewis,
who finished 2-for-4 with one run
and three RBI. "That was a real
heads-up play by Molina to go home
with that.That could have been a dis
astrous inning for us. I knew the im
portance of getting a double play
there. It was kind of an instinct thing
and just dove after him and was for
tunate enough to get him before he
got there."
Lewis also helped the Cardinal
out with the bat. With Molina on
after a base hit, and the score tied 2-2
in the bottom of the fourth, Lewis hit
a 2-2 pitch deep for a homerun, just
left of the huge wall in centerfield.
"I think he was kind of betting on
me not swinging," said Lewis of relief
pitcher Chris Petrini. "I don't think
he meant it to be that high, but I got
just enough of it to get it over the
fence. I was thinking.'Hit this ball as
hard as 1 can.'"
Stanford got on the board in the
second, with runs by freshman desig
nated hitter Brent Milleville and
Juhl. Stanford played small ball to
add one run in each the sixth and
eighth, with sophomore rightfielder
Michael Taylor scoring both runs,
and Lewis adding another RBI.
Bleich got the win in his 4 1/3 in
nings of work while Cal's starter
Alex Rollin received the loss. Davis
recoded his second save of the sea
son, after pulling out a very similar
situation at Southern California ear
lier this year.
"We have a lot of confidence in
our bullpen," Lewis said. "They've
done a lot of good things for us this
year. Bleich — I have all the confi-

dence in the world in that guy. I think
he got a little bit ahead of himself and
tried to do a little too much on the
mound, if I had to critique him a little
bit, but for the most part he's a bat
tler. He's a bulldog. He kept us right
there."
Stanford won 3-2 on Friday night
in one of the squad's best games of
the year. Senior shortstop Chris Mi
naker hit two solo home runs and
scored the winning run in the ninth,
accounting for all of Stanford's runs.
Molina had the game-winning one
out RBI single in the ninth.
Senior righthander Greg
Reynolds pitched a complete game
to move his record to 5-3, providing
some great defense of his own in the
top-of-ninth with two Bears' on base.
Brandon Morrow took the loss de
spite striking dut 11 and going the
distance as well.
The Cardinal lost a bit of that mo
mentum on Saturday, watching the
Golden Bears slowly tack on a run in
each of the final four innings. Tyson
Ross (5-3) got the win for Cal, as he
held Stanford to one run on six hits.
Stanford had the bases loaded in the
final frame but a groundout from
Taylor ended the game.
The series win keeps the Cardinal
in contention for a postseason spot,
but perhaps its importance is better
attributed to the confidence the play
ers displayed after the game.
"We've lost close games this year
but this really catapults us into a late
season stretch," Davis said. "I think
this will show everybody, we've won
two series in a row, we're for real —
we're going to make the playoffs."
Extra innings: Senior catcher John
Hester missed all three games
against Cal with a knee infection. He
is listed as day-to-day and is expected
to be ready for next weekend's
games at Washington.

each of the final four innings. Tyson
Ross (5-3) got the win for Cal, as he
held Stanford to one run on six hits.
Stanford had the bases loaded in the
final frame but a groundout from
Taylor ended the game.
The series win keeps the Cardinal
in contention for a postseason spot,
but perhaps its importance is better
attributed to the confidence the play
ers displayed after the game.
"We've lost close games this year
but this really catapults us into a late
season stretch," Davis said. "I think
this will show everybody, we've won
two series in a row, we're for real —
we're going to make the playoffs."
Extra innings: Senior catcher John
Hester missed all three games
against Cal with a knee infection. He
is listed as day-to-day and is expected
to be ready for next weekend's
games at Washington.

'Hie groundball. That's all sopho
more pitcher Erik Davis was thinking
about with a bases-loaded, one-out
situation yesterday. The groundball
double-play.
California had already come one
run closer to the Cardinal, 6-4, in that
ninth inning, the Bears' best hitter
Allen Craig had just singled to load
the bases and their No. 3 hitter Chris
Errecart was at the plate. Adding to
the drama was the importance of a
Pac-10 series for the Cardinal, a must
win on Sunday.
But, suddenly. Davis 1 thoughts
came to fruition. Errecart hit Davis'
fastball to third baseman Randy
Molina, who threw the runner out at
home. A quick turn and throw by
catcher Brian Juhl and Errecart was
out at first.
"I knew I could get a ground ball
for a double play," said Davis, who
threw his cap to the ground and
pumped his chest before being
mobbed by a slew of Cardinal players
along the first-base line. "Without
that we would have gotten one out
and who knows what the next guy
[junior centerfielder Brennan
Boesch] would have done, because
he's a good hitter too."
The Cardinal's postseason hopes
stayed alive with the 6-4 win, as they
took the series from Cal. They have
two remaining conference series this
season — next week at Washington
and the following weekend at UCLA.
Stanford got out of the dramatic
jam in the ninth, but it wasn't the only
time the double play saved the Cardi
nal.
In the fifth inning, with Stanford
up 4-2, Craig led off the inning with a
homerun off of starter Matt Manship
(2-5). Errecart and Boesch picked up
consecutive hits with no outs to put
runners at second and third.
But with Josh Satin, the go-ahead
run, at the plate, freshman Jeremy
Bleich managed to get the second of
three Stanford double plays of the
day.
Smart defense by the Cardinal re
sulted in two run-downs, along the
third-base line and between second
and third.
Molina saw Errecart break out of
the corner of his eye and immediately

Junior starting pitcher Greg Reynolds threw his second complete game en route to a 3-2
Stanford win. The righty outdueled Cal's Brandon Morrow for the win.
threw to the plate. Juhl ran up the
line to get the tag, keeping his ears
open for senior second baseman
Chris Lewis who was calling out for
him. With a long dive towards third
base, Lewis finished the play by tag
ging Boesch out.
"That was huge spot," said Lewis,
who finished 2-for-4 with one run
and three RBI. "That was a real
heads-up play by Molina to go home
with that.That could have been a dis
astrous inning for us. I knew the im
portance of getting a double play
there. It was kind of an instinct thing
and just dove after him and was for
tunate enough to get him before he
got there."
Lewis also helped the Cardinal
out with the bat. With Molina on
after a base hit, and the score tied 2-2
in the bottom of the fourth, Lewis hit
a 2-2 pitch deep for a homerun, just
left of the huge wall in centerfield.
"I think he was kind of betting on
me not swinging," said Lewis of relief
pitcher Chris Petrini. "I don't think
he meant it to be that high, but I got
just enough of it to get it over the
fence. I was thinking.'Hit this ball as
hard as 1 can.'"
Stanford got on the board in the
second, with runs by freshman desig
nated hitter Brent Milleville and
Juhl. Stanford played small ball to
add one run in each the sixth and
eighth, with sophomore rightfielder
Michael Taylor scoring both runs,
and Lewis adding another RBI.
Bleich got the win in his 4 1/3 in
nings of work while Cal's starter
Alex Rollin received the loss. Davis
recoded his second save of the sea
son, after pulling out a very similar
situation at Southern California ear
lier this year.
"We have a lot of confidence in
our bullpen," Lewis said. "They've
done a lot of good things for us this
year. Bleich — I have all the confi-

dence in the world in that guy. I think
he got a little bit ahead of himself and
tried to do a little too much on the
mound, if I had to critique him a little
bit, but for the most part he's a bat
tler. He's a bulldog. He kept us right
there."
Stanford won 3-2 on Friday night
in one of the squad's best games of
the year. Senior shortstop Chris Mi
naker hit two solo home runs and
scored the winning run in the ninth,
accounting for all of Stanford's runs.
Molina had the game-winning one
out RBI single in the ninth.
Senior righthander Greg
Reynolds pitched a complete game
to move his record to 5-3, providing
some great defense of his own in the
top-of-ninth with two Bears' on base.
Brandon Morrow took the loss de
spite striking dut 11 and going the
distance as well.
The Cardinal lost a bit of that mo
mentum on Saturday, watching the
Golden Bears slowly tack on a run in
each of the final four innings. Tyson
Ross (5-3) got the win for Cal, as he
held Stanford to one run on six hits.
Stanford had the bases loaded in the
final frame but a groundout from
Taylor ended the game.
The series win keeps the Cardinal
in contention for a postseason spot,
but perhaps its importance is better
attributed to the confidence the play
ers displayed after the game.

but this really catapults us into a late
season stretch," Davis said. "I think

we're going to make the playoffs."
Extra innings: Senior catcher John
Hester missed all three games
against Cal with a knee infection. He
is listed as day-to-day and is expected
to be ready for next weekend's
games at Washington.

'Hie groundball. That's all sopho
more pitcher Erik Davis was thinking
about with a bases-loaded, one-out
situation yesterday. The groundball
double-play.
California had already come one
run closer to the Cardinal, 6-4, in that
ninth inning, the Bears' best hitter
Allen Craig had just singled to load
the bases and their No. 3 hitter Chris
Errecart was at the plate. Adding to
the drama was the importance of a
Pac-10 series for the Cardinal, a must
win on Sunday.
But, suddenly. Davis 1 thoughts
came to fruition. Errecart hit Davis'
fastball to third baseman Randy
Molina, who threw the runner out at
home. A quick turn and throw by
catcher Brian Juhl and Errecart was
out at first.
"I knew I could get a ground ball
for a double play," said Davis, who
threw his cap to the ground and
pumped his chest before being
mobbed by a slew of Cardinal players
along the first-base line. "Without
that we would have gotten one out
and who knows what the next guy
[junior centerfielder Brennan
Boesch] would have done, because
he's a good hitter too."
The Cardinal's postseason hopes
stayed alive with the 6-4 win, as they
took the series from Cal. They have
two remaining conference series this
season — next week at Washington
and the following weekend at UCLA.
Stanford got out of the dramatic
jam in the ninth, but it wasn't the only
time the double play saved the Cardi
nal.
In the fifth inning, with Stanford
up 4-2, Craig led off the inning with a
homerun off of starter Matt Manship
(2-5). Errecart and Boesch picked up
consecutive hits with no outs to put
runners at second and third.
But with Josh Satin, the go-ahead
run, at the plate, freshman Jeremy
Bleich managed to get the second of
three Stanford double plays of the
day.
Smart defense by the Cardinal re
sulted in two run-downs, along the
third-base line and between second
and third.
Molina saw Errecart break out of
the corner of his eye and immediately

Junior starting pitcher Greg Reynolds threw his second complete game en route to a 3-2
Stanford win. The righty outdueled Cal's Brandon Morrow for the win.
threw to the plate. Juhl ran up the
line to get the tag, keeping his ears
open for senior second baseman
Chris Lewis who was calling out for
him. With a long dive towards third
base, Lewis finished the play by tag
ging Boesch out.
"That was huge spot," said Lewis,
who finished 2-for-4 with one run
and three RBI. "That was a real
heads-up play by Molina to go home
with that.That could have been a dis
astrous inning for us. I knew the im
portance of getting a double play
there. It was kind of an instinct thing
and just dove after him and was for
tunate enough to get him before he
got there."
Lewis also helped the Cardinal
out with the bat. With Molina on
after a base hit, and the score tied 2-2
in the bottom of the fourth, Lewis hit
a 2-2 pitch deep for a homerun, just
left of the huge wall in centerfield.
"I think he was kind of betting on
me not swinging," said Lewis of relief
pitcher Chris Petrini. "I don't think
he meant it to be that high, but I got
just enough of it to get it over the
fence. I was thinking.'Hit this ball as
hard as 1 can.'"
Stanford got on the board in the
second, with runs by freshman desig
nated hitter Brent Milleville and
Juhl. Stanford played small ball to
add one run in each the sixth and
eighth, with sophomore rightfielder
Michael Taylor scoring both runs,
and Lewis adding another RBI.
Bleich got the win in his 4 1/3 in
nings of work while Cal's starter
Alex Rollin received the loss. Davis
recoded his second save of the sea
son, after pulling out a very similar
situation at Southern California ear
lier this year.
"We have a lot of confidence in
our bullpen," Lewis said. "They've
done a lot of good things for us this
year. Bleich — I have all the confi-

dence in the world in that guy. I think
he got a little bit ahead of himself and
tried to do a little too much on the
mound, if I had to critique him a little
bit, but for the most part he's a bat
tler. He's a bulldog. He kept us right
there."
Stanford won 3-2 on Friday night
in one of the squad's best games of
the year. Senior shortstop Chris Mi
naker hit two solo home runs and
scored the winning run in the ninth,
accounting for all of Stanford's runs.
Molina had the game-winning one
out RBI single in the ninth.
Senior righthander Greg
Reynolds pitched a complete game
to move his record to 5-3, providing
some great defense of his own in the
top-of-ninth with two Bears' on base.
Brandon Morrow took the loss de
spite striking dut 11 and going the
distance as well.
The Cardinal lost a bit of that mo
mentum on Saturday, watching the
Golden Bears slowly tack on a run in
each of the final four innings. Tyson
Ross (5-3) got the win for Cal, as he
held Stanford to one run on six hits.
Stanford had the bases loaded in the
final frame but a groundout from
Taylor ended the game.
The series win keeps the Cardinal
in contention for a postseason spot,
but perhaps its importance is better
attributed to the confidence the play
ers displayed after the game.
"We've lost close games this year
but this really catapults us into a late
season stretch," Davis said. "I think
this will show everybody, we've won
two series in a row, we're for real —
we're going to make the playoffs."
Extra innings: Senior catcher John
Hester missed all three games
against Cal with a knee infection. He
is listed as day-to-day and is expected
to be ready for next weekend's
games at Washington.
