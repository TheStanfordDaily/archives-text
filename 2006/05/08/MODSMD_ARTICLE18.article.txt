# Baseball takes two from Bears
## Reynolds throws his second-straight complete game in Friday night's win 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
'Hie groundball. That's all sopho
more pitcher Erik Davis was thinking
about with a bases-loaded, one-out
situation yesterday. The groundball
double-play.
California had already come one
run closer to the Cardinal, 6-4, in that
ninth inning, the Bears' best hitter
Allen Craig had just singled to load
the bases and their No. 3 hitter Chris
Errecart was at the plate. Adding to
the drama was the importance of a
Pac-10 series for the Cardinal, a must
win on Sunday.
But, suddenly. Davis 1 thoughts
came to fruition. Errecart hit Davis'
fastball to third baseman Randy
Molina, who threw the runner out at
home. A quick turn and throw by
catcher Brian Juhl and Errecart was
out at first.
"I knew I could get a ground ball
for a double play," said Davis, who
threw his cap to the ground and
pumped his chest before being
mobbed by a slew of Cardinal players
along the first-base line. "Without
that we would have gotten one out
and who knows what the next guy
[junior centerfielder Brennan
Boesch] would have done, because
he's a good hitter too."
The Cardinal's postseason hopes
stayed alive with the 6-4 win, as they
took the series from Cal. They have
two remaining conference series this
season â€” next week at Washington
and the following weekend at UCLA.
Stanford got out of the dramatic
jam in the ninth, but it wasn't the only
time the double play saved the Cardi
nal.
In the fifth inning, with Stanford
up 4-2, Craig led off the inning with a
homerun off of starter Matt Manship
(2-5). Errecart and Boesch picked up
consecutive hits with no outs to put
runners at second and third.
But with Josh Satin, the go-ahead
run, at the plate, freshman Jeremy
Bleich managed to get the second of
three Stanford double plays of the
day.
Smart defense by the Cardinal re
sulted in two run-downs, along the
third-base line and between second
and third.
Molina saw Errecart break out of
the corner of his eye and immediately
