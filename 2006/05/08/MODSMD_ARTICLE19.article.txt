# SOFTBALL
## Rough trip to the desert for No. 8 Softball 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
It was a weekend of firsts for Stanford
softball, but not in a good way.
It was the first time the No. 8 Cardinal
dropped all three games in a weekend, and
the first Arizona sweep of Stanford. And
Friday marked the first time freshman ace
Missy Penna threw a complete game with
out a single strikeout.
The Cardinal (35-15,7-11 Pac-10) knew
they would face some tough competition
against the No. 3 Wildcats (40-9,11-6) and
No. 6 Arizona State (43-12,7-9) on the road
this weekend, but the three losses are
nonetheless hard to stomach.
"It's disappointing," Coach John
Rittman said. "But at the same time, we
know what problems we need to figure out
and what we need to do to get better. Right
now, we're making some mistakes and not
getting the timely hits. And against top
teams, you need to bring your A-game and
we are just not quite executing like we need
to."
Stanford's defense played tough
throughout the weekend, but when there
were breakdowns, the opponents took ad
vantage. And when opponents found them
selves struggling, the Cardinal bats went
quiet as well — Stanford was outscored 15-
3 this weekend and gave up the first run in
all three games.
The only lead the Cardinal had all week
end came for three innings in the middle of
Saturday's contest with Arizona.
"In two of the games we got down early,
but we fought hard," Rittman said. "We
were walking people early and then had to
face their big hitters early in the game. And
then we got some opportunities that we did
not cash in on."
The Cardinal got off to a slow start in
Tempe and they could not make up the
first-inning deficit, losing 6-0. ASU loaded
the bases with no outs in the bottom of the
first and Penna walked in the first run. The
Sun Devils brought two more across the
plate before the Cardinal could escape the
inning, and notched three insurance runs in
the third while shutting out the Stanford
offense
"It was a bit of a fluke really, with some
walks and a checked swing and a seeing
eye hit," Rittman said. "And suddenly we
were down by three runs and they never hit
it out of the infield."
The Cardinal defense held strong after
the third frame, hut the bats could not gener
ate any offense and ASU took the 6-0 victo
ry. The Cardinal dropped the season series to
ASU, 2-1, after splitting a pair in California a
few weeks ago.
Senior Catalina Morris went 2-for-3 and
sophomore Erin Howe went l-for-3, but
those were the only hits Stanford could man
age. Penna, who is averaging nearly a strike
out per inning, came up empty, scattering
seven hits with no strikeouts. Katie Burkhart
threw a three-hit shutout for the Sun Devils,
striking out 10 and improving to 22-5 on the
season. Penna fell to 19-8.
Saturday, the Cardinal again found them
selves on the wrong end of a hard-fought
back-and-forth game. Stanford led going into
the bottom of the seventh but the Wildcats
scored two to end the game with a 3-2 victory.
"It was a heartbreaker," Rittman said.
"They got a rally together and got the win
ning run on a bang-bang play at the plate. We
need to keep working hard and not let the
adversity ruin our spirits."
Arizona got on the board first with a run
in the bottom of the third inning. Stanford
came back to take the lead when junior des
ignated hitter Lindsay Key sent the ball out
of the park, knocking in Coon. The Cardinal
lead held into the seventh, but the Wildcats
tied with a double and two sacrifices. With
the score tied and two outs, Arizona slugger
Kristie Fox hit a deep double for an RBI and
the victory.
Coon was 2-for-2 at the plate with a run
scored and Key hit l-for-3 with two RBI.
Sophomore Becky McCullough (9-5) took
the loss in the circle for Stanford, allowing 10
hits over 6 2/3 innings while striking out five.
Arizona ace Alicia Hollowell improved
to 21-4 with the victory, giving up seven hits
and tallying six strikeouts.
And against Arizona on Sunday, the Car
dinal dug themselves a three-run first inning
hole for the second time in three days. T\vo
walks and a wild pitch in the first put two
runners in scoring position with Callista
Balko coming to the plate. Balko, who hit a
game-winning grand slam against ASU last
week, knocked it out of the park to put three
on the board.

The Cardinal scored a run of their own in
the fourth when sophomore Michelle Smith
sent a solo blast to left for her fourth homer
of the year. The run gave the Cardinal a
boost, but the Wildcats answered with three
runs in the fifth to put the game out of reach.
Arizona put two runners on base and, just as
Balko had in the first inning, Chelsie Mesa
hit a three-run blast.
Five players tallied hits for the Cardinal,
but they could not string them together. Penna
took her second loss of the weekend, giving up
three runs in the first before handing over
pitching duties to senior Laura Severson.
The Cardinal have one more weekend of
Pac-10 play remaining. They will host No. 17
Washington next Friday and then close out
the conference season with two games
against top-ranked UCLA.
"Right now, we need to make sure that
we have purpose in practice and that we are
working on our weaknesses, turning them
into strengths," Rittman said. "Hopefully, we
can build up some momentum down the
stretch and keep positive energy We need to
realize that we are still a postseason team
and we are still one of the top teams in the
country and we can get on a roll like any
body else."
