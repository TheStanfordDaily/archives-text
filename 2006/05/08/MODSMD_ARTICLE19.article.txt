## Rough trip to the desert for No. 8 Softball 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
It was a weekend of firsts for Stanford
softball, but not in a good way.
It was the first time the No. 8 Cardinal
dropped all three games in a weekend, and
the first Arizona sweep of Stanford. And
Friday marked the first time freshman ace
Missy Penna threw a complete game with
out a single strikeout.
The Cardinal (35-15,7-11 Pac-10) knew
they would face some tough competition
against the No. 3 Wildcats (40-9,11-6) and
No. 6 Arizona State (43-12,7-9) on the road
this weekend, but the three losses are
nonetheless hard to stomach.
"It's disappointing," Coach John
Rittman said. "But at the same time, we
know what problems we need to figure out
and what we need to do to get better. Right
now, we're making some mistakes and not
getting the timely hits. And against top
teams, you need to bring your A-game and
we are just not quite executing like we need
to."
Stanford's defense played tough
throughout the weekend, but when there
were breakdowns, the opponents took ad
vantage. And when opponents found them
selves struggling, the Cardinal bats went
quiet as well â€” Stanford was outscored 15-
3 this weekend and gave up the first run in
all three games.
The only lead the Cardinal had all week
end came for three innings in the middle of
Saturday's contest with Arizona.
"In two of the games we got down early,
but we fought hard," Rittman said. "We
were walking people early and then had to
face their big hitters early in the game. And
then we got some opportunities that we did
not cash in on."
The Cardinal got off to a slow start in
Tempe and they could not make up the
first-inning deficit, losing 6-0. ASU loaded
the bases with no outs in the bottom of the
first and Penna walked in the first run. The
Sun Devils brought two more across the
plate before the Cardinal could escape the
inning, and notched three insurance runs in
the third while shutting out the Stanford
offense
"It was a bit of a fluke really, with some
walks and a checked swing and a seeing
eye hit," Rittman said. "And suddenly we
were down by three runs and they never hit
