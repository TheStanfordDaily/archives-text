## GSC looks at two vacant positions Committees discuss nature, role of open administrative jobs 
### LESLIE GEORGATOS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the ongoing construction of the
Munger dorm, physical changes to grad
uate student life are readily apparent
around campus. But important changes
may be in store for graduate students on
a less superficial level as well.
Last Wednesday, a committee of fac
ulty, staff and graduate students met
with the Graduate Student Council
(GSC) to discuss two important, and
currently vacant, administrative posi
tions in graduate student education.
The vice provost and dean of re
search (VP-DOR) will represent Stan
ford's research interests both within the
University and to outside institutions,
coordinate Stanford's independent labs
and oversee Stanford's research poli
cies. The vice provost for graduate edu
cation (VPGE) will work to improve
graduate education at Stanford and to
recruit a diverse graduate student popu
lation.
Applied Physics Prof. Malcolm
Beasley, a member of the search com
mittee, consulted council members
about their vision for the VP-DOR role.
"Stanford is a research institution
and the [dean of research] is responsible
for helping maintain Stanford's excel
lence," said Cullen Buie, a graduate stu
dent in mechanical engineering. "This
includes managing internal issues and
interacting with Washington on a policy
level."
GSC members said they hoped the
VP-DOR would help protect students
in cases of scientific misconduct, raise
research funding, help students get bet
ter lab hours and facilitate interdiscipli
nary research.
Beasley said that Applied
Physics Prof. Arthur Bienenstock,
who currently holds the VP-DOR
position, will retain the role for two
more years. Bienenstock's role will
focus primarily on developing Stan
ford's communication on research
with the federal government.
'lTie search committee also asked
the GSC to name qualities to look
for in VPGE candidates and to list
issues students hope the new VPGE
will address. Council members ex
pressed concern about the rising
costs of housing, as well as the qual
ity of student-advisor mentoring re
lationships. Most of the concerns re
flected broad-based issues in gradu
ate life.
"I don't think we want a VPGE
who is happy with Stanford gradu
ate life," said Alex Ene, a graduate
student in aeronautics and astro
nautics. "We want someone who is
deeply unsatisfied."
Some GSC members expressed
concern that the VPGE's role as a
diversity overseer might be over
looked.
"I don't think you need someone
lying awake at night worrying about
developing interdisciplinary work at
Stanford. ITiis is going to happen,"
said Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Tom Kenny. "But I think someone
needs to be lying awake at night
worrying about diversity at Stan
ford."
All parties agreed that organiz
ing so many concerns under one of
fice would be difficult as well as re
warding.
"The VPGE needs to be so inter
ested in the grad student education
al experience that they know what
issues exist, so that when the strings
do become available, they can take
advantage of it,"said Maria Spletter,
a graduate student in biological sci
ences. "There are many different as
pects of grad life, and the VPGE
needs to keep track of them all and
their impact on the students."
"The VPGE is going to get very
different opinions from each grad
student," said Josh Lippman, a stu
dent in the Graduate School of
Business. "There is almost a mis
nomer of'a graduate student experi
ence.' There is not a lot of cross-com
munication, and breaking the com
munication barrier down is the first
thing that needs to occur."
Overall, students were apprecia
tive of the committee's effort to so
licit their concerns.
"1 thought it was great that the
search committee came to consult
the GSC about what graduate stu
dents' priorities are for these jobs,"
said Paul Gurney, a graduate stu
dent in electrical engineering and
one of next year's (JSC co-chairs.
"It's very important that the new
VPGE have a passion for all aspects
of graduate student life, especially
diversity, housing, quality advising
and health care. We also made it
clear that we want the new position
to have the power to make changes,
and should have a significant budget
to make those changes."
Graduate students are hoping
the VPGE position will be as well
funded as that of the vice provost for
undergraduate education, and hope
it will confront numerous aspects of
graduate life.
"The creation of the VPGE sym
bolizes the University's desire to im
prove the graduate student experi
ence," Buie said. " Typically the is
sues of graduate students are ad
dressed on an as-needed basis, but
this position will allow Stanford to
take a more proactive approach to
improving graduate life."
Ihe committee's recommenda
tions, which will be sent to President
John Hennessy and Provost John
Etchemendy after additional meet
ings, will include a list of names, a list
of qualities and a description of the
scope of each post.
"We need people with proven ex
perience at making things happen at
Stanford," Kenny said. "We're look
ing for awareness that not all pro
grams or students have the same
balance of issues. One of the stu
dents suggested that good candi
dates for the VPGE should be un
happy with the current state of af
fairs for graduate students. We take
this to mean that the VPGE should
be eager to make small and large
changes to improve graduate educa
tion and graduate life at Stanford,
and 1 think we agree."

one of next year's (JSC co-chairs.
"It's very important that the new
VPGE have a passion for all aspects
of graduate student life, especially
diversity, housing, quality advising
and health care. We also made it
clear that we want the new position
to have the power to make changes,
and should have a significant budget
to make those changes."
Graduate students are hoping
the VPGE position will be as well
funded as that of the vice provost for
undergraduate education, and hope
it will confront numerous aspects of
graduate life.
"The creation of the VPGE sym
bolizes the University's desire to im
prove the graduate student experi
ence," Buie said. " Typically the is
sues of graduate students are ad
dressed on an as-needed basis, but
this position will allow Stanford to
take a more proactive approach to
improving graduate life."
Ihe committee's recommenda
tions, which will be sent to President
John Hennessy and Provost John
Etchemendy after additional meet
ings, will include a list of names, a list
of qualities and a description of the
scope of each post.
"We need people with proven ex
perience at making things happen at
Stanford," Kenny said. "We're look
ing for awareness that not all pro
grams or students have the same
balance of issues. One of the stu
dents suggested that good candi
dates for the VPGE should be un
happy with the current state of af
fairs for graduate students. We take
this to mean that the VPGE should
be eager to make small and large
changes to improve graduate educa
tion and graduate life at Stanford,
and 1 think we agree."
