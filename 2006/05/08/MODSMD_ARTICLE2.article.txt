## GSC looks at two vacant positions Committees discuss nature, role of open administrative jobs 
### LESLIE GEORGATOS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the ongoing construction of the
Munger dorm, physical changes to grad
uate student life are readily apparent
around campus. But important changes
may be in store for graduate students on
a less superficial level as well.
Last Wednesday, a committee of fac
ulty, staff and graduate students met
with the Graduate Student Council
(GSC) to discuss two important, and
currently vacant, administrative posi
tions in graduate student education.
The vice provost and dean of re
search (VP-DOR) will represent Stan
ford's research interests both within the
University and to outside institutions,
coordinate Stanford's independent labs
and oversee Stanford's research poli
cies. The vice provost for graduate edu
cation (VPGE) will work to improve
graduate education at Stanford and to
recruit a diverse graduate student popu
lation.
Applied Physics Prof. Malcolm
Beasley, a member of the search com
mittee, consulted council members
about their vision for the VP-DOR role.
"Stanford is a research institution
and the [dean of research] is responsible
for helping maintain Stanford's excel
lence," said Cullen Buie, a graduate stu
dent in mechanical engineering. "This
includes managing internal issues and
interacting with Washington on a policy
level."
GSC members said they hoped the
VP-DOR would help protect students
in cases of scientific misconduct, raise
research funding, help students get bet
ter lab hours and facilitate interdiscipli
nary research.
