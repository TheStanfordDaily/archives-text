### ROHAN PURANIK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's lacrosse team routed the
Cal Bears 17-6 and defeated the top-seeded Denver
Pioneers 12-6 to extend their winning streak to seven
straight games and capture the MPSF Conference
title.
The squad's first game of the tournament was
against the Bears. Stanford had previously lost to Cal
9-6, just the second time the Cardinal ever fell to
Berkeley.
This time, however, Stanford entered on a five
game winning streak and dominated Cal. Most of
Stanford's goals came in the second half, when the
Cardinal women outscored Cal 10-1.
Sophomore goalkeeper Laura Shane played well
under fire, making eight saves in the second half
alone en route to 12 total stops.
Stanford showed the depth of its offensive line-up
with seven players scoring against Cal. Sophomore

and freshman midfield Jamie Nes

Stanford.
The first half of the game was
played at a slower pace, with the
Stanford netting seven goals and
Cal managing five. The Bears took
15 shots while the Cardinal attempt
ed 14.
The second half had an entirely
different dynamic, however, as the
Cardinal offense fired up to produce
eight straight goals after the 20th
minute. Of these, Patterson scored
four.
In the conference final against
Denver, Stanford played consistent
offensive and produced a solid de
fensive performance to capture its
second straight conference title.
Stanford outscored the Pioneers
in both halves, but the Stanford de
fense seemed particularly motivat

Strong performances from Bach
and Burker carried Stanford offen
sively. Each scored four goals. All of
Bach's came in the first half, while
three of Burker's came in the second
half. The balance provided for a con
sistent offense that bore through
Denver's defense.
The squads traded goals until the
last two minutes of the first half, at
which point sophomore Megan Mc-
Clain netted an unassisted goal.
Burker scored the final goal of the
first half with just seconds left on the
clock.
The second half was slow until
the last eight minutes of the half,
when Burker started off a streak of
five goals to capture the win.
Burker, Bach and sophomore de
fense Bri Ned were all named to the
All-Tournament team.
The squad now has a 12-5 record,
and ranks 16th in the nation. The
Cardinal waits for tomorrow's
NCAA Tournament field release to
see whether it will qualify for the na
tional championships.
