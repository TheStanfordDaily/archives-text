The Stanford women's lacrosse team routed the
Cal Bears 17-6 and defeated the top-seeded Denver
Pioneers 12-6 to extend their winning streak to seven
straight games and capture the MPSF Conference
title.
The squad's first game of the tournament was
against the Bears. Stanford had previously lost to Cal
9-6, just the second time the Cardinal ever fell to
Berkeley.

Stanford's goals came in the second half, when the
