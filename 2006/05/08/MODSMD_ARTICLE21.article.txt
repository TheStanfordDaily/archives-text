# Senior attacker Burker filling the record books
## 
### ROHAN PURANIK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After her four years at Stanford, senior attack Megan
Burker leaves with proof of her extraordinary experience.
The Baltimore native is only one of three Stanford
women's lacrosse players who has had entries in every cat
egory of the record book.
A modest star. Burker indicated that she didn't even
know that she had such a record, adding that she started out
just hoping that she'd make an impact on the program.
"I certainly wanted to make a big impact on this pro
gram when I committed to come out here." Burker said. "I
think that includes getting your name in the record books.
Hopefully. I've raised the bar so that other players will con
tinue to test the limits on how high those numbers can go."
Burker currently has 42 goals and 17 assists on the season.
Burker's lacrosse career started in sixth grade, with
Burker starting because of friends, but became a serious
passion over a year into her high school career.
"I played on my first lacrosse team in sixth grade." Burk-
er said. "I joined a local rec team be
cause most of my friends played, but
I didn't become really serious until
my sophomore year in high school."
Burker admitted that her early
start in sport sparked a need to com
pete. She began finding her weak
nesses and fixing them so that she
could become a serious player.
She found inspiration in her high
school coach, Wendy Kreidel. Accord
ing to Burker. Kreidel sparked Burk
er's competitive interest in the sport.

"I really respected her for her
knowledge of the game, and she has
been someone who 1 can talk to
about any issues with my game,"
Burker said.
Burker also found inspiration in
former Stanford coach Quinn Car
ney.
"I also remember in high school,
watching the college game, and my
favorite player to watch was always
Quinn Carney," Burker added." Well,
as it turned out, she started coaching
at Stanford just before I came here. 1
was fortunate to play for her for my
first two years, and now to play with
her at the U.S. level."
At Stanford, Burker has seen the
improvement in her game.

"Mostly my fitness has improved,
allowing me to play more of a mid
field role this year, but also I think
I've learned to be more consistent
and learned how to overcome
slumps," Burker said.
But it's not just her game that's
improved — the women's team has
helped Burker build a strong group
of friends while becoming more of a
leader.
"This team has been a rock
throughout my time at Stanford. My
class of seniors has been particularly
close, and they are the people that will
inevitably define my college years.
Being a captain during my junior year
also really helped me as a senior to be
come a stronger voice on the team."

Being a leader on the team has
not been without its pressures. But
instead of crumbling, Burker has
learned to prosper under adversity.
"There have definitely been times
where I've put a lot of pressure on
myself, and most of the time that just
backfires," Burker said."l've certain
ly learned that the hard way. My best
games come when I'm relaxed be
fore the game. I usually try to focus
on one thing that 1 have more control
over on the field, such as getting
ground balls or draws."
Burker credits a number of posi
tive experiences to her coach.
Michele Uhlfelder, recently named
U.S. Lacrosse Coach of the Week.
"Michele was an attacker who

played at the highest level for a fe
male lacrosse player " Burker noted.
"She has given me invaluable knowl
edge about being a leader and has
helped create ways to challenge me
on the field every single day."
And under Uhlfelder's watch, the
future of Stanford lacrosse looks lim
itless to Burker.
"I think the future of Stanford
Lacrosse is very bright. We have
some amazing returnees coming
back " Burker said. "Our team is
very deep this year with a lot of peo
ple coming off the bench. I think
many of those girls could be step
ping into starting positions next year
with valuable minutes under their
belts."
