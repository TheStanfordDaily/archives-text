## Students participate in moot court Competitors argue Doe vs. Miller; a law that imposes statutes on sex offenders 
### KAT LEWIN STAFF WRITER 
The court may have been moot, but at Saturday's final
round of the Marion Rice Kirkwood Moot Court Com
petition, the legal know-how was very real. Third-year
Stanford Law School students Julia Lipez and Alex Lees
faced off against fellow third years Nat Garrett and Jason
Tarricone in front of a large audience in the Stanford Law
School Moot Court Room.
After the two-hour competition, the judges awarded
Best Brief and Best Overall Team to Garrett and Tarri
cone, while Lipez took honors for Best Individual Oral
ist.
Moot Court is a competition in which law students are
presented with actual legal cases that have gone through
the Federal Court of Appeals. They then prepare briefs
for a side of the case, and argue it as though they are be
fore the Supreme Court.
Moot Court is offered as a course in the Law School.
According to Lipez, the first semester concentrates on
preparing briefs, while the second semester focuses on
oral argumentation.
This year's case was Doe vs. Miller (Eighth Circuit
2(X)5), centered around an lowa statute barring those
convicted of sexual offenses with children from living
within 2,(XX) feet of a school or child care facility. The par
ticipants found the case particularly compelling because
of its relevance to current policy questions in California.
" Ibis is especially interesting because California's ac
tually going to be considering this law in a referendum
this fall," Garrett said.
Lipez and Lees argued on the behalf of the petition
ers, saying that the law should be ruled unconstitutional
because it imposes ex post facto punishment and violates
substantive due process. Garrett and Tarricone argued on
behalf of the respondents, arguing for the court to uphold

the state's right to pass the law.
Ttoenty teams participated in the competition's pre
liminary event, each arguing first on one side of the case,
then the other.
"It's challenging because you only write the briefs
for one side, so one side becomes your main side, and
you live it and breathe it for the entire semester," Lees
said. "However, for anyone who's crafted a brief well
enough and thought about it thoroughly enough, it's al
most second nature to be able to argue both sides. The
trouble is, it's difficult to switch your brain almost in
stantly. During the preliminary rounds, there's a 10-
minute break, then you have to go back and argue the
other side."
From there, the competition narrowed into an eight
team quarterfinal round and a four-team semifinal round
before the two-team final.The final round of the compe
tition was scored by Judge Frank Easterbrook of the
United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit,
Judge Mary Schroeder of the United States Court of Ap
peals for the Ninth Circuit and Justice Carlos Moreno,
Stanford Law School Class of '75, of the California
Supreme Court.
The competitors spoke highly of the judges.
" Ihey didn't really treat us like students in terms of
keeping their gloves on." Garrett said. "They were pretty
active with us, which is the best learning condition. It was
probably a good show for the audience, because the
judges were lively."
Both teams said they felt the experience was a positive
one.
"It was an incredible experience,"Lipezsaid."lt's a lot
of work, but it really forced us to come up with creative
arguments and come up with the best way to attack this
law. It's part of the seminal law school experience, so my
partner and I were very glad to be involved in it. It's
something we'll probably remember most from our law
school years."
Lees agreed with his partner.
"It was a wonderful opportunity to role-play," he said.
"Rarely do we get to pretend that we're real lawyers."
