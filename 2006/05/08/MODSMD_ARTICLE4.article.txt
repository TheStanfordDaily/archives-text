# ON CAMPUS
## Increasing traffic may lead to fines 
### CLAY BAVINGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The amount of on-campus traffic is
close to surpassing the limit set by Santa
Clara County in 2001. and if that cap is
exceeded, the University would have to
pay the county to support roadway miti
gations, according to Director of Com
munity Relations Jean McCown. But
proposed remedies prescribed by one ad
ministrator have come under fire for
evading traffic counts rather than cutting

down on traffic itself.
Five years ago. Santa Clara County is
sued Stanford a General Use Permit that
stipulated that the number of cars enter
ing and leaving campus must not rise
above a certain baseline level.
To avoid paying the fine, school offi
cials have tried to reduce the number of
cars arriving on campus each day. Ad
ministrators encourage faculty to bike or
take the Marguerite to work, and
Provost John Etchemendy has sent out a
memo asking employees to carpool to

campus.
Some administrators have gone fur
ther in trying to limit traffic on campus.
Hilary Beech, a senior associate dean
for administration at the School of Engi
neering. has asked employees and stu
dents to avoid arriving to or leaving from
campus during peak traffic hours. While
trips between 7:30 and 9 a.m. and 4:30
and 6 p.m. are designated as peak hour
trips. Beech suggested that drivers avoid
a specific one-hour period when actual
measurements take place.
"What this means is that if it's 4:50
p.m. and you're heading out and think
that you've missed the chance to avoid
the peak hour window, this is not the
case," Beech wrote in a statement.
"Rather than have a 10-minute chat in
the hallway, if you can hustle and get
through the cordon before 5 p.m., your
trip will not count."
Others regard this policy as dishonest
and believe that it bends the rules be
cause it does not actually decrease the
number of cars that enter and exit cam
pus each day.
"[Beech's suggestion) is not correct,"
McCown said. "[lt] is not the University's
policy."
McCown does support the program
enacted by Philip Pizzo, dean of the
School of Medicine, who recently asked
employees not to leave between 4 p.m.
and 6:30 p.m. one day each week. Pizzo's
request may seem similar to Beech's, but
McCown said that it "is part of the strat
egy to introduce flex time [and] is consis
tent with the ideas we're working with"

pus traffic soon, it will have to pay a hefty fine to Santa Clara County for overuse violations.
To clarify the difference between
the two policies, McCown said that
the University encourages depart
ments to avoid congestion by having
their employees work different
shifts.
"There has been no hiding of
that," she said.
Because this policy involves
making schedules more flexible, Mc-
Cown added that the University is

trying to accommodate its employ
ees' needs as well.
"The University administration is
actively encouraging schools and de
partments to have their employees
change their travel patterns via
whichever means works the best for
them and to do so on an on-going
basis," she said.
The University has also made ef
forts to increase the availability of
carpools and public transportation.
Administrators have encouraged
faculty to carpool by offering mone
tary incentives to those who do so.
Stanford has also devoted millions of
dollars improving the free Mar

guerite shuttle bus.
Another factor which exacer
bates the already congested traffic is
the amount of construction on cam
pus. Near both the School of Medi
cine's Beckman Center and Stern
and Wilbur Halls, construction has
reduced Campus Drive to two lanes,
making the road more crowded than
usual.
While the increased traffic on
campus puts the University at risk of
paying heavy fines, it has also irritat
ed students and faculty.
"It's frustrating that it takes so
long to drive through campus," said
Kat Hoffman, a junior.
