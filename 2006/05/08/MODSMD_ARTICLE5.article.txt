## LAW SCHOOL WORKER DIES Law Cafe employee hit by car on El Camino Real 
### NICK PARKER DESK EDITOR 
Sandra de Anda,a University em
ployee who worked at the Stanford
Law School Cafe, passed away on
Sunday, April 30 as a result of injuries
she sustained in a car accident two
days earlier.
De Anda was walking home from
work on April 28 when she was struck
by a car on El Camino Real. The re
sulting trauma landed her in the hospi
tal, where she remained for two days
before succumbing to her injuries.
De Anda was a single mother of

two small children, aged eight and 10.
Her family is working to bring her
body back to Mexico so she can be
buried there, but is overwhelmed by
the price of shipping a body, which
can cost more than $ 15,(KK). As a re
sult, the Stanford Latino Law Stu
dent Association (SLLSA) is coordi
nating an effort among students, fac
ulty and staff to collect money to pay
for these expenses.
Donations are currently being ac
cepted in the Law School lounge.
SLLSA is also accepting checks,
which can be slipped under the
group's door in the Law School.
More extensive coverage of the
tragedy and subsequent fundraising
efforts will appear in The Daily later
this week.
