## Eateries celebrate Cinco de Mayo 
### CHRISTIAN TOM STFF WRITER 
Stanford Dining pulled out all the stops — and
all the food — at various eateries on campus on
Friday to commemorate Cinco de Mayo, a holiday
that celebrates the anniversary of Mexico's tri
umph over France at the Battle of Puebla on May
5,1862.
According to Rafi Taherian, executive director
of Stanford Dining, dining halls and retail locations
were "festively transformed" for the day.
Among the treats were chicken and vegetable
chilaquiles, carnitas, chicken and vegetable
tamales, bunuelos, chili verde and cheese soup.
"It was wonderful." said Alina Syunkova, a
sophomore who ate dinner at Stern Hall on Friday
night. "It's really cool how they served dishes I've

never even tried before."
Jesus Bojorquez, known as "the Masa Man "
worked all week with the dining staff at Stern to
produce his signature tamales and a variety of spe
cialty Mexican dishes,Taherian said.
"Over the years, [ Bojorquez] has been assisting
us in developing menus, recipes and special events
so we can better promote and feature authentic
Mexican cuisine and customs," Taherian said.
ITie extra effort certainly showed.
In total, the team produced 3,(KK) tamales, 200
pounds of nopales, 200 pounds of carnitas, 150
pounds of ceviche, 150 pounds of guacamole, 400
pounds of tomatoes for salsa and 2(H) pounds of
beef brisket for tamale pie.
With such massive quantities of food, however,
come certain challenges.
"It is really hard to cook for hun
dreds and hundreds of people," said
Tammy Luo, a freshman. "It is tough
to make the same quality as a restau
rant or Hispanic home cooking."
Overall, Luo saluted the staff at
Stern for what she called a "good ef
fort."
The Mexican cuisine was concen
trated at Stern, because it is, in the
words of Taherian, the "destination
dining for this type of cuisine." The
other dining facilities focused on indi
vidual preparations for Cinco de
Mayo.
TYesidder Union and the Linx
cafe, for example, offered Mexican
cuisine at lunchtime only.
Bill Anderegg, a sophomore lunch
diner at Tresidder, was happy with the
food and said he enjoyed the cultural
activities.
"It is always good to seeculturally
themed food," he said.
Junior Tim Su, another Tresidder
patron at lunch on Friday, agreed.
"It's good food — better than the
usual food [at Tresidder]," he said.
Su also complimented the service
at Tresidder, calling the servers "din
ing hall all-stars."
Many dining locations also fea
tured festive decorations, with Mexi
can flags, pinatas and balloons.

"The balloons, flags and signs
made the experience more than
about just food," Luo said. "It was a
cultural experience, with lots of pride
and a display table [in the dining
hall]. It makes you think about it
more. You appreciate it more, rather
than just eating the food and then
leaving."
Friday's lunch atTresidder also in
cluded items and giveaways, and cus
tomers who purchased a Mexican en
tree at Linx got free churros.
Stanford Dining tried to accom
modate all dietary needs on Friday, by
serving a number of alternatives, in
cluding vegetarian versions of the
Mexican dishes.
Overall, judging from student
feedback, the hard work paid off for
the Stanford Dining team. The em
phasis on culture resonated among
student diners.
"1 really appreciate their incorpo
rating more cultural awareness," Luo
said.
"Stanford is all about diversity,"
Taherian said. "And we would like to
celebrate that diversity in the cuisines
of the world as well."
"I can find out about other cul
tures," Syunkova added. "It's great."
A number of student groups also
hosted events on Friday to commem
orate the holiday. According to senior
Diego Martin, MEChA co-spon
sored Oro Solido, a merengue group
from New York, and La Internacional
Sonora Show (formerly La Sonora
Dinamita), a cumbia group from
Colombia.
