## It's time for your digital exam 
### 
Most people would agree that the Internet is
a good thing. We can buy airplane tickets,
seek medical advice and watch porn, all
with the click of a button.
But the world of digital dating is a significantly
bleaker prospect. First of all, there's no way to tell
whether or not CoolGuy44 from TUlsa is the devil
ishly handsome firefighter he says he is, or if he's ac
tually a 12-year-old stripper named Sunshine who
cuts babies for fun. And even if technology allows
you to find the love of your life, how are you going to
explain to your friends that you met your wife by
searching profiles for the keyword "Star Trek?"
But desperate times call for desperate measures,
and occasionally people have successful encounters
with people they meet online. I, unfortunately, am
not one of them. About a year ago, I was feeling par
ticularly bored, and so 1 posted a simple personal ad
on Craigs List just to gauge the response.
The results were not encouraging. One man wrote
extensively about the fact that he had a boat and a
car and a pickup â€” I guess this is usually all it takes
to get a woman in bed with him. Another respondent
told me that he thought I was very pretty, which was
nice, but confusing because I did not post a picture
with the ad. The cream of the crop was the man who
said he wanted to be my "temporary passageway to
sexual discovery. Maybe we have one night of lust or
maybe we have 20." Or maybe we have none be
cause the mere thought of responding to your email
is giving me herpes.
But I'd hate to ruin your chances at a cyber-happy
ending just because I attract child molesters, so I re
searched some other dating sites out there. Here's
what I came up with:
Perfectniati-h.com: I am pretty sure that this was
the site featured in the movie "Must Love Dogs," but
I'm not certain because five minutes into the film I
lost the will to live. According to the site description,
you fill out a compatibility test and then the site sug
gests matching profiles, but I didn't get that far. Evi
dently the test was developed by a Dr. Pepper
Schwartz, and as a rule I do not follow the advice of
people with porn star names.
eHarmony.com: This site markets itself as the
choice for singles looking to get married, and accord
ing to their press kit, 90 eHarmony members get
married every day. After taking a good half hour to
fill out their sadistically comprehensive question
naire, I was informed that not one of their 10 million
users appeared to be compatible with my personali
ty profile. I was slightly irritated until I realized that
even if I did have any matches, I would have to pay
$60 a month to communicate with these individuals.
There's no explanation as to why their members
need to be sent letters made of gold, but I go for the
starving artist type anyway,so screw you,eHarmony.
LittlePeoplelVleet.com: Are you single? Are you
looking for love? Do you have difficulty reaching
things more than four feet above the ground? If you
answered "yes" to any of these questions or dream of
Vern Troyer in the nude, then this is the site for you.
Avoid the urge to laugh hysterically at the main
image on the home page, even though there cannot
be a logical reason to include this particular picture
anywhere on the Web site.
OatelVlyPet.com: Pet lovers.rejoice! There is now
a dating site that will allow you to do the following:
a) set up dates for your pets with other pets and b)
set up dates for yourself with other pet owners. I
have a feeling there are probably several people on
this site looking for c) a date with a pet, which is dis
turbing in ways that Rover can feel but cannot de
scribe. Also, what does a date between two gerbils
look like? Do they run on a little wheel together and
discuss their favorite brand of wood chips? Who the
hell are these people?
