# IEEE brings engineering students together to meet and mingle
## 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
When one thinks of major student organizations on
campus, the Stanford chapter of the Institute of Electri
cal and Electronics Engineers (lEEE, pronounced "I
-triple-E") may not leap to mind. Yet lEEE, Stanford's
main organization for electrical engineering and com
puter science, boasts full turnout at its events and a 500-
member mailing list.
President Dmitry Belogolovsky, a co-terminal student
in computational and mathematical engineering, calls the
lEEE "a social pre-professional group for people with
common interests to mingle and meet each other."
The lEEE is an international organization with more
than 365.000 members. In addition to student members,
most of the computer science and electrical engineering
professors at Stanford are also members of the lEEE, ac
cording to Belogolovsky.
Stanford lEEE organizes mixers, faculty and industry
dinners and community service projects, as well as activi
ties like broomball games and study breaks. A few of these

events are held each quarter.
In addition, the group is responsible for publishing The
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Journal.
"lEEE is like a club for people who want to hang out
outside of the lab," says Belogoiovsky.'Tn electrical engi
neering, students have a lot of work and tend to hang out
inside labs a lot. This gets people together."
On April 20, lEEE hosted a student/faculty mixer
featuring a presentation by Marc Pawlingcr, senior di
rector of engineering at Adobe. About 130 students and
faculty members attended the event.
"Tilings really came together at the Adobe presenta
tion last month." says Belogolovsky. "It was very satisfy
ing."
"After a great keynote speech, students and faculty en
joyed a good dinner among good company." says Vice
President of lEEE Yuriy Teslyar. a senior. "The main goals
of the event were to encourage interaction among the
EE/CS engineering community as well as to introduce
them to the inner workings of a tremendous technology
and company, and we accomplished both."

"I think people were really happy just mingling there,"
comments Belogolovsky. "When we tried to start the
event, actually, we couldn't, because people were still talk
ing for a while. There was a lot of energy in the room —the
atmosphere was great and it was great to see everyone
come together.
"Everyone had a great time, and we are looking for
ward to maintaining this tradition,"Teslyar adds.
Belogolovsky said that Stanford lEEE is thinking
about holding one more event this quarter, possibly fea
turing a representative from Advanced Micro Devices.
"Leading companies actually contact us because
they've heard about lEEE," Belogolovsky says. "It's actu
ally not a problem to get speakers."
Recently, Stanford lEEE has hosted speakers repre
senting Nvidia. IBM. Broadcom and Digital Chocolate.
Belogolovsky remarked that lEEE aims for variety in
speakers.
"Our objective is to have different people from dif
ferent walks of life. Of course the focus is on technolo
gy, but we try to reach out to different types of audi

ences," he says.
"This year we've tried to focus on big companies and
startups, computer science and electrical engineering,
hardware and software, because we have that kind of du
ality." Belogolovsky adds. "We have both electrical engi
neers and computer scientists as well as other people who
are interested in electronics."
Belogolovsky emphasizes the social aspect of the
group, which aims to connect students with similar in
terests.
"It's fun to hear speakers, but it's also great to have
people mingle, and that's the main purpose of Stanford
lEEE," he said. "It also gives students a way to interact
with faculty outside of the academic environment."
All lEEE events —funded by the ASSU and the
GSC —are free of charge and advertised through posters
and emails.
"A lot of people show up to our events," says Belo
golovsky, citing the Adobe mixer as an example. "We
usually have overflow. We're a major student group on
campus."
