## Editorial Luck of the Draw: What are its drawbacks? 
### 
In yesterday's editorial, the Editorial
Board evaluated the proposed Housing
Master Plan that University administra
tors have developed. We are glad to see that
the University is making some substantial
efforts to improve housing on the Farm.
After all, these changes could benefit the
large proportion of students who live on
campus. But there are still plenty of prob
lems plaguing the current housing assign
ment system.
Don't get us wrong, living on campus has
its perks such as guaranteed housing, the fix
it guy, no leases and no pressure. On the other
hand, the annual spring housing lottery cre
ates its own share of stress and anxiety. Most
upperclassmen have had more time to nego
tiate the innerworkings of the Draw. Howev
er. we feel that it is our duty to warn freshmen
about the problems associated with the Draw
and with residential life in general.
Freshmen, you may think that getting
split up from your friends is not such a big
deal. After all, everybody lives everywhere
anyway. It will be fun to visit your friends in
other dorms. And besides, the possibilities
for making new friends in your new dorms
are endless. Well, not quite.
The social life at Stanford is extremely
residential. Upperclassmen have already re
alized that they will never see their friends in
Synergy if they choose to live in Mirrielees.
People are too lazy to visit their friends on
the other side of campus. And while you can
party with everyone, but you can only live
with the best of friends.
All this emphasizes the point that draw
groups are incredibly important. Your draw
group will shape your social life for years to
come. Draw alone or with just your room
mate if you dare, but don't count on making
new friends with people from other draw
groups. Members of these large cliquish
drawgroups do everything together and are
virtually impossible to infiltrate.

But even if you decide to draw in a large
group, your problems aren't over. Besides
the fact that you will have to be friends in
groups of no more than eight people, you
will find yourselves embroiled in petty argu
ments over inconsequential matters. Draw
groups will argue over the decision to live in
Kimball or Kairos. Certain members will
think it's okay to let someone tag along who
will make all your lives miserable. Friend
ships will end and relationships will turn
sour on the basis of silly things like whether
you want a meal plan.
And if the draw-ma of forming a draw
group wasn't enough, then you have to
worry about getting a good Draw number.
Little do you realize while you debate the
merits of Jerry over 680 that you will draw a
1968. This is when the panic sets in. If you
end up on the wrong end of the Draw, you
may have preferences, but you really don't
have a choice. You may be the wildest party
animal on campus, but a bad Draw number
will banish you to the freshmen ghettos of
Wilbur and Stern.
While Row houses may be in high de
mand. the number of rooms in such houses is
in short supply. Houses like Bob, Xanadu,
Jerry and 680 consistently draw under 200,
while many of other residences on the Row
are reserved for fraternities and people who
speak foreign languages.
Worse yet, because of the randomness of
the Draw, many Stanford residences don't
develop distinct personalities. The turnover
is too unpredictable. The atmosphere, the
vibe and the environment of each residence
changes year by year depending on the va
garies of the Draw.
In the end, students don't really have that
much control over their social lives or their
housing situations.The current system of the
Draw — a system designed to give students
control over where they live — turns out to
create only an illusion of choice.
