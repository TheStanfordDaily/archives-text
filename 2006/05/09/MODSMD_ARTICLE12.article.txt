This column is dedicated to everyone
who has asked me to give them props
since I first started writing for the
paper. [Your name here] has been my inspi
ration and guiding light, the thought that cir
culates through my mind every time I sit
down at my computer to write. Though I
never explicitly mentioned your name, you
have been the implied thesis statement of
every column. The world could use more
people like you.
No, I'm serious. There is a reason that
there is a cabinet full of advisors for only one
president — can anyone really expect one
man (especially this man in particular) to do
all that thinking on his own? Or take Bill
Gates, for example. If there were Oscars for
computer science, his acceptance speech
would go on for hours as he thanked all
those who helped him climb to success,
everyone from his college CS professors to
the interns who first tested out his programs
to his wife for putting up with his incessant
talk about computers over dinner.
So I'm writing this for all the behind-the
scenes people, the ones who never get the
recognition they deserve. For the people
who play defense on championship sports
teams, who start every game but never get
their pictures in the paper because they
aren't the ones scoring the goals. For the
people who set up all of their friends on
amazing dates, but like the defenders, never
get to score for themselves.
Many overlook the value of the unwaver
ing support that these people have to offer.
But where would you be on Saturday night
without the help of your valiant wingman?
I'll tell you one thing: You sure won't be in
the apartment of that hot girl at the bar who
is currently ignoring you and your (slightly
pathetic) advances.
Or. if you happen to be that hot girl at the
bar, be thankful that you brought your girl
friends along with you to save you from Mr.
Sketchball as your third martini of the night
starts to kick in.
Nobody likes to go it alone. I mean, have
you ever seen a woman go to the restroom
without an army of X-chromosomes flanking

either side? It's not just a coincidence that fe
male bladders are all on the same schedule.
Life is uncomfortable without company.
It's not merely a matter of inability, because
every single person I know is perfectly capa
ble of asking someone out on their own —
or whatever it is that they are trying to gar
ner the strength to do. The problem is that it
is hard to feel comfortable running up the
field to shoot a goal when you have no de
fenders to back you up in case things go hor
ribly wrong. (This is why I never played
goalie; I can't deal with the pressure of being
the very last line of defense. Plus, getting hit
with the ball hurts ... a lot.)
It is too bad that these people aren't
praised nearly as often as they should be —
because they are behind most, if not all, vic
tories in life. You aced your chemistry
exam? Thank your eighth grade science
teacher for making you memorize the peri
odic table of the elements. You finally
dumped your jerk of a boyfriend? Kudos to
your friend who first noticed the Facebook
album of him and another girl in compro
mising photo after photo.
Likewise, I appreciate the people who
not only read my column but also care
enough to ask me to mention their names or
use their ideas. Maybe you just want your 15
minutes of fame (although, if that is the
case, I would advise that you set your sights
someplace besides page 4 of The Stanford
Daily), but I, like everyone else, enjoy feel
ing like I have lots of people backing me up.
And so, [your name here], I thank you for
your support.

If you need moral support or have some to
offer, e-mail Stephanie at salessi@stanford. edu.
