# The
						discreet charm of the bullshit T-shirt
## 
### 
We were in Prague last weekend, fi
nally, a long-discussed vacation to
the hot Old World city getaway of
the moment. Everybody who's anybody says
go to Prague — it's beautiful, majestic,
cheap. Unlike Paris, London, Berlin and all
the other big-time European metropolises,
Prague never had the living hell bombed out
of it. Dark Age architecture spreads out to
the hills, mixing with Soviet Cube-chic and
ultra-modern craziness (e.g. the TV tower, a
hypodermic needle injected in the hillside,
with giant black faceless baby sculptures
climbing up the outside).
But the Others have found Prague. These
are people who wear flip-flops and college T
shirts to the Jewish cemetery, and snap pho
tos of street performers begging for cash.
People who crowd in Old Town Square every
hour to watch the massively anticlimactic As
tronomical Clock go off. In other words:
Tourists. Worse, American tourists. You can
even smell them — they're the only ones
wearing cologne.
It's easy for the young college student
with a Eurail pass, a fleet of button-up col
lared shirts and a fashionable disinterest in
everything to look down on our embarrass
ingly American fellow Americans. (Though
I should note it's not just Americans that are
filling Prague's tourist coffers: a Czech dude
holding a Long Island Iced Tea told me that
the sheer number of Englishmen who came
for weekend travel benders has increased
the average annual national beer consump
tion by several liters). But I do have a cer
tain weakness for souvenirs — shot glasses,
Soviet-era posters, "Depeche Mode" ma
tryoshka dolls.
But there's nothing like a Bullshit T-shirt.
Prague is drowning in them. There's Cul
tural Bull: postcard pictures of town, or the
eerie silhouette of a man walking down a
bleak cobblestone street with "Kafka" writ
ten in bold; Jokey Bull: the Bohemian Lion

from the Czech flag next to slogans like
"Czech Mate" and "Czech Me Out;" and
Shameless American-baiting Bull: a poorly
drawn Calvin (as in, "...and Hobbes") chug
ging booze or smoking cigarettes, and the
only indication that you didn't buy the shirt
at Venice Beach is a non-sequitur "Prague"
printed in black.
I love Bullshit T-shirts. You could argue
that ever since college kids started wearing
bright-colored shirts with Stewie, Mario and
Che Guevara, the best T-shirts are, paradoxi
cally, the worst, the cheesiest and the ones
that only a 2nd-grade idiot savant Halo
Champion with Coke bottle glasses would
think is cool.
But there is something extra special, or
extra horrifying, about travel shirts. We were
in TUrkey last quarter for the Will Field Trip,
and I will always have my memories, my pic
tures and my column about a night of lurid
university-sponsored drunkenness (which
supposedly caused Stanford-in-Berlin to
change its alcohol policy, proving once and
for all that someone does read The Daily).
But mostly, 1 have a T-shirt, bought cheap in
the Covered Bazaar, which shows every
one's favorite androgynous French cartoon
character walking past the Blue mosque,
with "Tintin in Istanbul" written under
neath.
Too many people take traveling too se
riously to enjoy the simple pleasures. Walk
ing back to our hostel, we found a poster
advertising "CATS" in Prague at a local

theater. Most people only know CATS
from that memorable "Team America"
aside ("1 tried to escape, but Rumpleteaser
held me down.") These people are uncul
tured sodomitic plebes who probably
haven't even seen "Starlight Express." We
figured, what the hell, we can spend one
night in ageless Prague watching an An
drew Lloyd Webber musical. When you're
not a tourist, you're allowed to do the occa
sional tourist thing.
It turned out that "CATS" in Prague was
actually "Cats in Prague." It was a Black
Light theater production (meaning most of
the show was performed under a black neon
light), and the majority of the play consisted
of performers, dressed all in black and al
most invisible, with a Cat's puppet head on
their right hand and their glowing white
gloved left imitating the cat's body. The
hand-puppet Cats danced, flew, ice-skated,
screwed, committed suicide and got behead
ed. There was also a human actress, dressed
head-to-toe in a white jumpsuit tight enough
to count her pretty little ribs. Suffice it to say,
there was no Macavity.
As Lauren said after our great Czech
mindfuck was finished, "I guess I know
where Kafka was coming from." The Czechs
love this kind of thing — puppet theaters are
the big thing in town. That's part of the rea
son I recommend Prague, it's still got an un
dercurrent of distinct weirdness that's miss
ing from globalized London and Berlin. But
it was too much for us. We needed to decom
press, so we went to McDonald's and had a
milkshake. It tasted like home.
Hie next day. I got a "Czech Mate" and a
Calvin. My goal is to have a wardrobe made
entirely of Bullshit T-shirts by the time I
repatriate in September. I also got a sling
shot. because hey, it's cultural.

Darren hranich also really likes Bullshit hats.
