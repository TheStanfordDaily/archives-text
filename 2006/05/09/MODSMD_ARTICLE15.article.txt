Stanford committed to reduce
commute traffic
Clay Bavinger's story ("Increasing traffic
may lead to fines," May 8) misstates Stan
ford's approach to — and reasons for — re
ducing commute traffic.
Stanford's aggressive alternative trans
portation programs are designed to reduce
commute traffic to campus. Although mitiga
tion payments (not fines) could be required if

commute traffic during peak periods exceeds
the General Use Permit objectives, the rea
sons to reduce auto trips are to minimize
parking woes and traffic congestion on cam
pus and in our neighboring communities, not
to avoid a financial payment.
Provost John Etchemendy has encour
aged faculty and staff to consider a range of
alternative transportation programs and
work schedules, not just carpooling. In fact,
the provost either rides his bike to campus or

uses the Marguerite.
There are not multiple commute-reduc
tion policies at Stanford. There is only one,
with a variety of options on how best to im
plement it. A recent email in the School of
Engineering simply interpreted the policy in
correctly.
