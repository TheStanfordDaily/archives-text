## THROUGH MY EYES Freshman Living the Dream The 						only downside? "Random" comments leave Megan Doheny dubbed "Dodo" by her teammates 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
The Daily continues its "Through My
Eyes" series on the women's tennis team
with freshman Megan Doheny.
Being a "mini"
Like Nuge [Jessica Nguyen] said ("Jessi
ca Nguyen: Stanford's mini-senior," May 5),
she and I are Amber [Liu]'s and Jess [Leckj's
"minis." Nuge and Amber sort of look alike,
both obviously have great work ethics and
are really nice people.They're really focused
and get along really well together.
Jess and I have been pretty close because
we've known each other since 1 was in ninth
grade and she was in 12th. Like Nuge said,
with the age gap it was hard for us to connect
and really get to know each other well. But
being on the team together now, all of our
similarities started coming out. I think it was
Alice [Barnes] who first said,"Dodo, you are

exactly like Jess."
We both have our little blond ponytails;
we have similar ways of talking and ways of
acting; we went to similar schools and grew
up in the same area of L.A. Our moms are
really good friends, and we're both really
close with our moms, so we'll probably both
be just like our moms. I love the humanities,
and that's definitely something else Jess and
1 have in common, which kinda freaks me
out — I swear I'm following my own path!
It's just really coincidental that we happen to
be doing the same things.
Who's a dodo?
I think that in her interview with you.
Amber said my nickname, "Dodo," was for
my "brilliant comments" and laughed. I tend
to have some random comments every now
and again. I like to think they entertain the
team in times of need — though Theresa is

also there for that. Dodo obviously comes from my last
name, "Doheny." But Anne [Yelsey] told me she was
studying the dodo bird one day in class and that it's a stu
pid bird, and so I was just a little bit taken aback by them
giving me that nickname! But they actually just think
I'm entertaining. Now it's just a term of endearment, so
1 embrace my "dodoism." The team actually even calls
them "dodo comments" if somebody says something
random, or funny but a little out of left field.
Freshmen friendship
Nuge is one of my best friends. 1 mean, it's really easy
to bond immediately when you're two freshmen who
don't really know what's going on. Being a freshman, it's
a little hard to get your grounding and know what's
going on all the time. Our team is on the older side and
the other girls have been through it all before. As Nuge
said, sometimes we just don't really know what's going
on. We would call each other at the beginning and ask
each other, "Do you know what's happening?" More
often than not, it would be some surprise from the team,
and they would take us out or something. But as the year
has gone on, we've gotten a lot more comfortable and I
think that by next year, it'll just be a lot easier.
But Nuge and 1 have been close right from the begin
ning. When 1 first saw her at some athlete dinner, we just
ran to each other and embraced. And as the year has
gone on, we've just gotten closer and closer, hang out all
the time and have a lot of similar friends.
Why Stanford? Well, where else?
Stanford was pretty much my hands-down first
choice. I didn't really want to go anywhere else. You
have to make the most of your experience wherever you
go, but I love the campus, 1 love the fact that it's on the
West Coast, because I'm from Southern California, and
I know a good place when I see it. I've always been real
ly into academics and taken my work really seriously.
Plus, we have the best tennis program in the country, and
it's such an amazing thing to be a part of that.
And the people. Everyone always says the people,
but it's so true. Everybody you know that goes here is
going to be just so motivated and love to do a lot of
things, and that's what I love to do.
NCAAs: A dream come true
We're the closest team in the country, 1 can say with
out a doubt. Everybody gets along so well. A big part of
that is that it's Stanford, and Stanford takes the type of
person who is nice and motivated and going to want to
make the most of her experience. All of us always — no
matter how busy we are — make time to be together. I
really love it. It's so hard to talk about it and put it into
words.
When I first got here, I was so unsure of things, and
was just walking around feeling anxious all the time.
Having the team just made it so easy for me to get into
the swing of things. They did a lot more events, definite
ly, in the fall, to do that, and now it's really just that —
well, we're looking ahead to NCAAs.
There's so much uncertainty for me as freshman that
I'm not aware of how big this tournament is even going
to be. I just feel so lucky that it's actually at Stanford this
year, because it's going to be such a huge event and
everyone needs to go. It's just too perfect to be coming in
as a freshman and to have the NCAAs right on campus.
It's like a dream come true.
