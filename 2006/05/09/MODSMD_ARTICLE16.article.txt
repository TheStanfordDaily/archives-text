## THROUGH MY EYES Freshman Living the Dream The
						only downside? "Random" comments leave Megan Doheny dubbed "Dodo" by her teammates 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
The Daily continues its "Through My
Eyes" series on the women's tennis team
with freshman Megan Doheny.
Being a "mini"
Like Nuge [Jessica Nguyen] said ("Jessi
ca Nguyen: Stanford's mini-senior," May 5),
she and I are Amber [Liu]'s and Jess [Leckj's
"minis." Nuge and Amber sort of look alike,
both obviously have great work ethics and
are really nice people.They're really focused
and get along really well together.
Jess and I have been pretty close because
we've known each other since 1 was in ninth
grade and she was in 12th. Like Nuge said,
with the age gap it was hard for us to connect
and really get to know each other well. But
being on the team together now, all of our
similarities started coming out. I think it was
Alice [Barnes] who first said,"Dodo, you are

exactly like Jess."
We both have our little blond ponytails;
we have similar ways of talking and ways of
acting; we went to similar schools and grew
up in the same area of L.A. Our moms are
really good friends, and we're both really
close with our moms, so we'll probably both
be just like our moms. I love the humanities,
and that's definitely something else Jess and
1 have in common, which kinda freaks me
out — I swear I'm following my own path!
It's just really coincidental that we happen to
be doing the same things.
Who's a dodo?
I think that in her interview with you.
Amber said my nickname, "Dodo," was for
my "brilliant comments" and laughed. I tend
to have some random comments every now
and again. I like to think they entertain the
team in times of need — though Theresa is
