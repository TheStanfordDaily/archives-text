Basketball â€” it's what I live
for. This past weekend
marked several crucial
matches in the NBA playoffs' first
round: game six of the San Antonio-
Sacramento series and the Cleve
land-Washington series, and the de
ciding game seven between the Lak
ers and the Suns.
I could just imagine the sheer
bliss that I would have enjoyed chill
ing in the RA's room with a cold
Pepsi in one hand and a bag of Chee
tos in the other, yelling toward the
TV screen at the top of my lungs.
Just one problem. My dorm.Casa
Zapata, had planned a trip to
Yosemite for this particular week
end, and as dorm president I had no
choice but to go. I sucked it up and
asked some friends to call me as
soon as some final scores were avail
able, so that I could at least be in
formed of the results as soon as pos
sible.
So the dorm's residents packed
into a couple of rented vans Friday
afternoon in hopes of reaching
Yosemite Park's Camp Curry in one
piece. The six-hour drive itself was
quite enjoyable, offering loud sing
alongs to "Rent" and the riveting
challenge of seeing who could fall
asleep quickest. The game kind of
lost its enjoyment, however, once
