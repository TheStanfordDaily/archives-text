# Wonders outside the sports world

Basketball — it's what I live
for. This past weekend
marked several crucial
matches in the NBA playoffs' first
round: game six of the San Antonio-
Sacramento series and the Cleve
land-Washington series, and the de
ciding game seven between the Lak
ers and the Suns.
I could just imagine the sheer
bliss that I would have enjoyed chill
ing in the RA's room with a cold
Pepsi in one hand and a bag of Chee
tos in the other, yelling toward the
TV screen at the top of my lungs.
Just one problem. My dorm.Casa
Zapata, had planned a trip to
Yosemite for this particular week
end, and as dorm president I had no
choice but to go. I sucked it up and
asked some friends to call me as
soon as some final scores were avail
able, so that I could at least be in
formed of the results as soon as pos
sible.
So the dorm's residents packed
into a couple of rented vans Friday
afternoon in hopes of reaching
Yosemite Park's Camp Curry in one
piece. The six-hour drive itself was
quite enjoyable, offering loud sing
alongs to "Rent" and the riveting
challenge of seeing who could fall
asleep quickest. The game kind of
lost its enjoyment, however, once

our driver came close to winning.
We arrived at Yosemite at around 11 p.m.
Friday and rapidly retired to our cabins,
where most fell asleep upon hitting the bed.
I, on the other hand, chose to walk around
the campsite for a while and stare up at the
stars — something I can't really do back
home in Los Angeles, or here at Stanford, for
that matter.
The next day we headed out for an ardu
ous hike that quickly reminded me of my
asthma. As we climbed up a very rocky ter
rain, the combination of nature's green and
brown overwhelmed me. I looked down to
where we had started our climb and saw
human beings resembling ants. I closed my
eyes for a second and could hear the remark
able sound of water falling thousands of feet
before crashing upon jagged rocks to form a
river.
We walked some more, and I really started
to think about the significance of this outing. I
realized that throughout this journey 1 had
completely forgotten about the worries that
would normally plague my day — work.

school, relationships, etc. At no point during
the weekend did 1 really feel stressed about
anything, a condition I welcomed with open
arms.
Then 1 wondered exactly why 1 felt so dif
ferent. Suddenly, it clicked. The beauty of
Yosemite had completely transformed my
mentality, and it was because 1 had finally re
turned to what God had given me in the first
place.
I apologize to certain readers for bringing
religion into this sports column, but it's pretty
vital for my point. By being there in Yosemite,
I had been stripped of man-made institutions,
which I now understood to be the ultimate
source of all of my worries. The problems that
cause me so much strife I bring onto myself;
nature puts no pressure on me, as it is merely
there to appreciate.
Saturday night arrived, and I had com
pletely forgotten about the basketball games.
1 started to flirt with worrying about my Lak
ers' chances of winning, but then I merely
shrugged it off.
Instead, I lied down in a clearing and
looked up at the stars, basketball the last thing
on my mind.
