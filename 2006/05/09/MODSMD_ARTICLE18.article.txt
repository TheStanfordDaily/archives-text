### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
The last time Stanford baseball squared off
against Santa Clara, the Cardinal left the field with
the bitter taste of defeat in their mouths.
After nine innings of a brilliant pitchers' duel,
Stanford's bullpen cracked when the game went
into extra innings tied at 1-I.The Broncos explod
ed for five runs in the top of the 10th, and the Car
dinal proved unable to respond in their half of the
inning, falling 6-1.
At the time of that meeting two weeks ago,
Stanford wasn't catching any breaks â€” the Cardi
nal were mired in a 6-12 slump and had lost each
of their last five series.

the Cardinal's favor once again, as Stanford (22-
21, 7-11 Pac-10) has gone 4-2 in conference play
over the last two weekends to regain some mo
mentum heading into the final month of its regu
lar season schedule. The Cardinal still find them
selves stuck at the bottom of the Pac-10 standings,
but they have moved to within a half-game of
eighth-place Arizona (6-9).
Coming off a resounding 6-4 win in Sunday's
rubber match against visiting California, Stanford
seems to be firing on all cylinders heading into to
morrow evening's rematch against the Broncos
(26-22,7-11 WCC). Senior ace Greg Reynolds has
