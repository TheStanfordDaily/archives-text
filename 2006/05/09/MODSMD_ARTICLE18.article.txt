## Win tonight would keep Card on track Men hope to keep momentum going against Santa Clara 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
The last time Stanford baseball squared off
against Santa Clara, the Cardinal left the field with
the bitter taste of defeat in their mouths.
After nine innings of a brilliant pitchers' duel,
Stanford's bullpen cracked when the game went
into extra innings tied at 1-I.The Broncos explod
ed for five runs in the top of the 10th, and the Car
dinal proved unable to respond in their half of the
inning, falling 6-1.
At the time of that meeting two weeks ago,
Stanford wasn't catching any breaks — the Cardi
nal were mired in a 6-12 slump and had lost each
of their last five series.
But the winds of fortune have begun to blow in
the Cardinal's favor once again, as Stanford (22-
21, 7-11 Pac-10) has gone 4-2 in conference play
over the last two weekends to regain some mo
mentum heading into the final month of its regu
lar season schedule. The Cardinal still find them
selves stuck at the bottom of the Pac-10 standings,
but they have moved to within a half-game of
eighth-place Arizona (6-9).
Coming off a resounding 6-4 win in Sunday's
rubber match against visiting California, Stanford
seems to be firing on all cylinders heading into to
morrow evening's rematch against the Broncos
(26-22,7-11 WCC). Senior ace Greg Reynolds has

tossed two consecutive complete
game victories, and the bullpen post
ed a solid 3.96 ERA in 9.1 innings of
relief versus the Bears this weekend.
Senior shortstop Chris Minaker,
despite having his 12-game hitting
streak snapped on Sunday, has paced
the Stanford offense. Even with his 0-
for-4 in the series finale against Cal,
Minaker still went 5-for-ll on the
weekend with a pair of homers.
Senior third baseman Chris Lewis
picked up the slack for Stanford on
Sunday, propelling the Cardinal to
the win with a two-run homer in the
bottom of the fourth that put his
squad ahead to stay. Lewis has now
hit safely in five consecutive games,
and has hit at a .400 clip with five RBI
during that period.
Still, the Cardinal have much to
prove tonight as they travel to Santa
Clara's Stephen Schott Stadium.
Dating back to last season, the Bron
cos have taken three straight from
Stanford — the first time since 1995
that the Santa Clara squad has post
ed such a streak.
The Broncos enter the contest
with a 6-4 record in their last 10
games, but they will be trying to re
cover from a three-game sweep at
the hands of San Diego this past
weekend.
