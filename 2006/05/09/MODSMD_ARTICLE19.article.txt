## Women rowing for fifth-straight title Varsity eight has yet to lose to lightweight Pacific Coast foe 
### JOHN CHOCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
League titles, postseason berths and a
shot at the history books await Stanford row
ers this weekend. Three Stanford teams are
scheduled to race the best in the West for the
Pac-10 and Pacific Coast Rowing Champi
onship titles on Lake Natoma in Sacramen
to, Calif.
Stanford's lightweight women will at

tempt a fifth-straight PCRC crown against
an expanded field that includes newcomer
Central Florida, whom the Cardinal have not
faced this year.
"[UCF] has started building a solid light
weight program over the past few years "jun
ior lightweight captain Meredith Coleman
said. "We're definitely looking forward to a
good race."
Coleman's crew spent most of the season
competing against open-weight boats, and
the varsity eight has not lost to a lightweight
Pacific Coast opponent.
"We're feeling confident, our boat is mov
ing well and we're beginning to flesh out our
race plan," Coleman said.

The open-weight women's crew will vie
for a NCAA team bid, a berth awarded to the
top 12 Division I programs in the nation.The
Cardinal narrowly missed that invitation last
year and sent only a varsity eight boat to the
national regatta.
"In my opinion, all boats need to race to
medal in order to gain a team berth for
NCA As," Coach Aimee Baker said.
Baker's three boats are currently ranked
second, fourth and sixth in the Pac-10.
"This will require a season's-best per
formance, which is what we have been
preparing for all year," Baker said.
The open-weight boats will have
to be prepared for a challenge as
they. They must apply the lessons
learned in a rollercoaster season — a
season that saw Stanford finish on
both sides of a sweep.
"Each of the Stanford [open
weight] boats has had both great per
formances and disappointing per
formances that will give them both
confidence and a healthy respect for
the competition that they will face at

the championship," Baker said. "It
should be very exciting. Stanford is
prepared to be at its season's best."
Stanford's heavyweight men
enter the league regatta sandwiched
between top-seed California and
third-seed Washington.The Cardinal
men attempt to add a first-ever Pac
-10 title to a season of many firsts; the
men won the Copley Cup and had
victories over Yale, Penn, Washing
ton and Cal.
"The Pac-10 Championships rep
resent a tremendous opportunity for
Stanford," men's head coach Craig
Amerkhanian said. "Our hope is to
race with Cal and Washington all the
way down the course."
