## d.school aims to promote hip hop 
### DENISE SOHN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A design school class called "Creating Infec
tious Action" is doing just that on campus today.
From chalking White Plaza to distributing fliers,
class members have been hard at work on their lat
est project. At noon today, a flash "concert" will
showcase just what they've been up to. The class is
offered by The Hasso Plattner Institute of Design,
commonly known as the d.school.
"What we've been doing all quarter is finding
ways to motivate people to do stuff," explained
Jason Fang, a co-terminal student in manage
ment science and engineering (MS&E).
This week, the class is working to promote a
hip-hop concert that will take place Wednesday
night at 8 p.m. at the CoHo. Four performers
from Conduit Records — a label started by
Stanford students — are scheduled to appear.
Among the four scheduled performers is
Chane Morrow, co-founder of Conduit Records
and a Stanford alumnus from the class of 2001.
Morrow, who goes by the stage name "Epiphany,"
first began rapping as a student at Stanford.
Huey Kwik, a co-terminal student in comput
er science and another member of the class, elab
orated on the unique nature of the concert.
"One side of hip-hop tends to get the most at
tention: the bling, the violence, the offensive
lyrics," Kwik said. "But there is another side to
hip-hop, exemplified by the artists visiting Stan
ford this week. At its core, hip-hop is poetry: lyri
cal wordplay with a story to tell."
Liz Gerber, a doctoral student in MS&E, is a
member of the four-person teaching team, which
also includes MS&E Prof. Robert Sutton, con
sulting Prof. Diego Rodriguez and Institute of
Design fellow Susie Hosking.
Gerber explained that the students have been
assigned "to use the design process to create in
fectious action around hip-hop. We hope they will
learn about the interplay between production
and consumption in the business of hip-hop."
Each group was assigned one artist around
whom to "create infectious action." For help in
the process, each group was also given Myspace
accounts and artist biographies, opportunities
for artist interviews and 50 CDs of the artists'
single.
"We've distributed fliers in dorms and parties
and chalked White Plaza," Kwik explained.
"We've also created different Web sites for our
artists, such as http://www.bigpiph.com, and have
talked to people at Stanford as well as within the
Palo Alto and East Palo Alto communities. Sell
ing CDs out of our cars, auctioning memorabilia
on eßay and conducting a flash mob are just a
sample of the other methods we're going to be
using in the coming days. We've also acquired
sponsorships from several businesses in the Palo
Alto area."
Fang added that the flash mob will take place
at noon today in White Plaza next to Old Union.
This "flash concert" will feature artist 607 stand
ing on a car roof.
