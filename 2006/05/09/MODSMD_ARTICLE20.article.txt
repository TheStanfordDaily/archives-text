# TRACK & FIELD
## Despite small group, Card set records at Open 
### ISRAEL ROJAS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the Pac-10 Championships just
around the corner, Stanford track and field
toned their tempo down this past weekend.
Many athletes took a break from competi
tion and the Cardinal sent only a few partic
ipants to the Hornet Open in Sacramento,
Calif., this past Friday.
Of the athletes that did compete, junior
sprinter Janice Davis turned in the best per
formance. Davis set personal records in
both the 100- and 200-meter races, running
times of 11.42 seconds and 23.48 seconds, re
spectively. Her 100-meter time places her
third all-time in the school's record books,
and her 200-meter time was good enough
for fourth. Both times were under the
NCAA West Regional qualifying marks.
Redshirt junior Keith Avila also set ca
reer-best marks in the javelin. His throw of
198-2 feet easily erased his previous best of
194-11 feet, and placed him fifth in the
school record books.
The Cardinal enjoyed success in several
other events. Sophomore Daniel Schaerer
won the discus with a throw of 178-6 feet.
On the women's team,senior Sarah Hop
ping and sophomore Melissa Yunghans also
tasted victory. Hopping won the hammer
with a throw of 210 feet, and Yunghans won
the shot put with a throw of 50-11 feet.

The Hornet Open was followed by the
Pac-10 Multi-Event Championships on Sat
urday, where two Cardinal athletes per
formed well â€” sophomore Josh Hustedt
and freshman Lauren Stewart.
Hustedt tallied 6,992 points to place
fourth overall among a field of 13 decath
letes. His best scores came in the 110-meter
hurdles and in the pole vault, but he fell shy
of his career best of 7,070 points.
Stewart enjoyed similar success, beating
out eight others for a fifth-place showing in
the heptathlon. Stewart narrowly topped
her previous best of 5,110 points with a final
two-day score of 5,141 points. Her best
event was the 800 meters, in which she
earned 711 points.
The regular portion of Pac-lOs will take
place this weekend at Oregon. Last season,
the women's team ended UCLA's eight
year grip on the championship. With many
returning members, the Cardinal look
primed to defend their title and finish on
top.
The men, however, are hoping to im
prove upon their sixth-place showing last
year. Last season's success was due largely
in part to then-senior Michael Robertson,
who placed first at Pac-lOs on his way to a
national championship. But without the star
power of any individual participants, the
men will need to work as a team to do well
this time around.
