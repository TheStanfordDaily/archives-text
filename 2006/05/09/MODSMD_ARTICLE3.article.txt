## Students undecided on Westly 
### GERRY SHIH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last Saturday, California State Treasurer Phil An
gelides received a crucial — though somewhat expect
ed — boost in the gubernatorial primary race when
delegates at the California Democratic Party conven
tion voted overwhelmingly in favor oi endorsing his
lagging campaign. Angelides got the tip at the expense
of opponent Steve Westly, the state's controller, leaving
some Stanford students wondering whether or not the
move was beneficial to the greater progress of the Cal

Westly's roots at Stanford are, without doubt, firmly
entrenched. After receiving two degrees ('7B, MBA
'83), he returned to the University and lectured in the

"All I can say is: what a mistake," he wrote on the Stan
ford Democrats weblog shortly after returning from Sacra

Zimmerman told The Daily that he thought it was a
mistake for the Democrats to make an endorsement at all.
"The point of a party primary is to allow Democrats
across the state to decide who the nominee should be,
not 1,800 delegates gathered in a convention hall," he
said. "Every poll shows Westly leading Angelides in the
primary race, and shows him leading Arnold by a signif
icant margin in a potential head-to-head match up. An
gelides, on the other hand, does not beat Arnold ac
cording to current polls."
President of the College Republicans Donald
Stevens, a junior, observed the Democrats' movements
with confidence.
"Westly is higher in the polls, and I wouldn't be sur
prised if he wins the primary," he said. "I think the De-
