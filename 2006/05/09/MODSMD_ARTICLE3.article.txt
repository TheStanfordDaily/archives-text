## Students undecided on Westly 
### GERRY SHIH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last Saturday, California State Treasurer Phil An
gelides received a crucial — though somewhat expect
ed — boost in the gubernatorial primary race when
delegates at the California Democratic Party conven
tion voted overwhelmingly in favor oi endorsing his
lagging campaign. Angelides got the tip at the expense
of opponent Steve Westly, the state's controller, leaving
some Stanford students wondering whether or not the
move was beneficial to the greater progress of the Cal
ifornia Democratic Party.
Westly's roots at Stanford are, without doubt, firmly
entrenched. After receiving two degrees ('7B, MBA
'83), he returned to the University and lectured in the
Public Management Program at the Graduate School
of Business from 1991 to 1996. According to members
of the Stanford Democrats, Westly also has not shied
away from selecting Stanford graduates to fill his per
sonal staff since entering the political arena.
"Steve Westly is basically Stanford's favorite son
when it comes to California politics," said sophomore

Eric Zimmerman, a board member of the Stanford De
mocrats and a staunch Westly supporter who was pres
ent at the convention with the Westly team.
"All I can say is: what a mistake," he wrote on the Stan
ford Democrats weblog shortly after returning from Sacra
mento. "I don't think this endorsement is going to matter."
Zimmerman told The Daily that he thought it was a
mistake for the Democrats to make an endorsement at all.
"The point of a party primary is to allow Democrats
across the state to decide who the nominee should be,
not 1,800 delegates gathered in a convention hall," he
said. "Every poll shows Westly leading Angelides in the
primary race, and shows him leading Arnold by a signif
icant margin in a potential head-to-head match up. An
gelides, on the other hand, does not beat Arnold ac
cording to current polls."
President of the College Republicans Donald
Stevens, a junior, observed the Democrats' movements
with confidence.
"Westly is higher in the polls, and I wouldn't be sur
prised if he wins the primary," he said. "I think the De-

mocrats are taking a large risk in [en
dorsing a candidate)."
Stevens broached the last time the
Democrats endorsed a gubernatorial
candidate, when the party picked the
relatively liberal John Van de Kamp
over the more moderate Dianne Fein
stein in 1990. The female ex-mayor of
San Francisco won the primary regard
less, but lost the general election to
then-Republican Senator Pete Wilson.
President of the Stanford Democ
rats Nellie Selander, a junior, was also
at the convention, working for vice gu
bernatorial candidate Jackie Speier.
Selander, who has tipped Westly to win
the primary but personally remains
undecided between the two Democ
rats, revealed that it was obvious to
party insiders who would get the nod.
"At last year's convention we all
knew Angelides would get the en
dorsement and it was clear this year as
well "she told The Daily. "Westly had
tons of volunteers, a great set up, and
sounded a lot more composed than a
year ago. However, 112 was not surprised
that he was not endorsed by the party.
The Democratic base, those who vote
in primaries, love Angelides."
Zimmerman explained that An
gelides "has the backing of a large
part of the party establishment, and
the endorsement was simply con
firmed Angelides' status as the politi

cal insider in the race."
Graduate student Gilbert Mar
tinez, also a Dems member, expressed
a different take on the endorsement.
"I happen to think that Phil An
gelides will be the best governor of the
three — and Westly a strong second,"
Martinez said. "What is most striking
about Angelides' endorsements over
all is the breadth of his support. He is
endorsed by both the more liberal and
conservative Democratic leaders. 1
think this reflects his record of demon
strated leadership and pragmatism as
well as his effectiveness."
Martinez has judged Angelides's
campaign so far as "mediocre," point
ing out that if an early lack of money
had not let Westly gain the upper hand
through aggressive advertising and
name recognition, the primary would
already be settled in Angelides' favor.
"Angelides has had the grassroots
advantage for quite a while — and is
constantly increasing it — but his
campaign failed to take the early ini
tiative in advertising and the recent
polls reflect that," Martinez said. Fur
thermore, he added that Westly's ties
to Stanford and the close proximity of
his office in Palo Alto make it easier
for students to join his campaign.
"At the convention, there definitely
appeared to be more Stanford Democ
rats volunteering for Westly than An
gelides,"he recalled."! didn't volunteer
for Phil and am not aware of other
Stanford Democrats who did. Howev
er. 1 know of many [Stanford students|
who are strongly behind Angelides."
One GSB professor, who wished

to remain anonymous, said Westly's
extensive network at Stanford had
both advantages and disadvantages
for his campaign.
"The truth is there are a lot of
Stanford lovers and a lot of Stanford
haters," the professor said. "Haters
typically see us as a bastion of privi
lege, exclusiveness and separateness,
and to be affiliated with that image
could be damaging. Westly has tried
to play [his Stanford connections]
down...he has tried to play down the
Stanford brand. He's sensitive to the
fact that there are a number of people
who feel antipathy toward Stanford."
Furthermore, after receiving his
Stanford MBA. Westly went on to a
successful career in investment and fi
nance. He eventually made millions
as an early executive at eßay, achiev
ing success within a business commu
nity typically identified firmly with
the Republican Party. GSB Professor
George Parker, the former associate
dean for academic affairs and the di
rector of the MBA program who
taught Westly during the early 80s, re
flected on the candidate's position.
"1 think having an understanding
and experience in big business is a
good thing in the political arena, it's a
good thing especially in the Democ
ratic Party because it lends balance,"
Parker said. "There is a dimension of
fiscal and economic discipline that
comes from the business world that
carries over very well into the govern
ment, and at this point in time, that
may be needed at the state level.
"It's a wonderful thing if some

one from the business community is
fully engaged in the Democratic
Party as well." he added. "1 would
like to think that our two-party sys
tem includes all points of view with
in each party, and there's room in
their tent for people of all persua
sions. People don't want both parties
to represent total about-faces in the
way in government is run."
Martinez, meanwhile, sees little in
common between the Democratic
candidates and Schwarzenegger when
it comes to being able to run the state.
"Most Stanford Dems believe both
Westly and Phil Angelides will make
better governors than Schwarzeneg
ger," Martinez said. "We all share a
common concern for the future of Cal
ifornia. Both candidates provide a re
freshing, distinct and positive vision of
California and the country. We're all
tired of attacks on our committed
teachers, our brave firefighters and po
lice officers and women's rights. Phil
Angelides and Steve Westly both
share our core values."
Stevens, though, isn't too worried.
"The poll numbers may look very
close right now, but remember that
Schwarzenegger hasn't been cam
paigning as actively as the other two,"
he said. "Once he's in full swing, his
numbers will probably go up. He must
treat the voters as partners in the po
litical process — as he did in 2003 —
and carefully explain his proposals to
them instead of relying on theatrics.
Some excitement and showmanship
is a plus, but it shouldn't be the
bedrock of the campaign."
