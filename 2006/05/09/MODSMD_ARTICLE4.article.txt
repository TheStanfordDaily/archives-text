# LIVING WAGE INCREASED
## Hennessy announces 10 percent increase of living wage for subcontractors 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
President John Hennessy announced yesterday that the Uni
versity will increase the so-called living wage paid to subcontract
ed workers by 10 percent starting in September.
The announcement comes as the Stanford Labor Action
Coalition (SLAC) prepared for a TUesday protest to demand an
acceptable living wage for workers. The University said the in
crease followed a human resources study that found Stanford fell
short compared to nearby cities with a living wage and did not
provide enough to account for the local cost of living.
The announcement will raise the minimum wage for subcon
tractors working on campus and receiving employer-provided
health coverage to $11.15 per hour, a 10.4 percent increase. Cam
pus workers without health benefits will earn a minimum wage of
$12.59 per hour, a 10.9 percent increase. The policy also requires
that eligible employees be offered 10 days of paid vacation annu-
ally.
University Human Resources
Executive Director Diane Peck
praised Hennessy's announcement
and said that the wage increases
make the University an even more
attractive place to work.
"I am pleased our recommenda
tion to adjust our living wage rates
has been accepted," she said in a
statement.'i believe this adjustment
is consistent with Stanford's long his
tory of concern for all people who
are part of the University communi
ty. It is a commitment that is a critical
part of Stanford's desire to achieve
its mission of excellence in teaching

and research."
In April 2003, the University es
tablished the living wage rules for
contracting companies. The policy
was implemented as new contracts
were signed and existing contracts
were renewed. The University
agreed to conduct a regular review of
salaries in comparison to nearby mu
nicipalities and other employers as
part of the living wage plan.
Stanford completed its first re
view and wage comparison this year.
The Human Resources Department
will now begin annual reassessments
of the living wage.
University officials did not an
nounce the increase as part of any
kind of compromise or negotiation
with workers, their representatives
or officials. In fact, the change does
not apply to workers represented by
the Service Employees International

Union (SEIU).
SLAC Spokesman Matt Seriff-
Cullick, a sophomore, called the an
nouncement a step in the right direc
tion, but said that more needs to be
done by the University to protect its
workers.
"It's a well-timed PR move that's
not insubstantial," he said.
Seriff-Cullick added that, even
with the increase, some workers will
still earn less than a report from the
California Budget Project, a non
partisan left-leaning think tank, said
was necessary to live in this area.
He also criticized the living wage
policy for its exemptions.
"One of the main problems with
the living wage is how heavily it is re
stricted, and that hasn't really
changed with this announcement,"
he said. "The living wage policy ap
plies to contracted workers, whose

contracts last for more than one year,
who aren't unionized and who are
part of a contract of over $100,000
with the University.
"It only applies to workers on the
core campus, which means that Hos
pital and Stanford Linear Accelera
tor workers are excluded," he added.
"It also only includes those who
work more than 30 hours a week."
Seriff-Cullick said recent efforts
by SLAC to draw attention to the liv
ing wage issue — including a rally
last week and a banner unveiled at
an event Hennessy spoke at during
Admit Weekend — "absolutely"

played a part in driving the Universi
ty to make the announcement.
"The timing definitely reflects
that the University was paying atten
tion to what we were doing," he said.
The demonstration scheduled for
today has been postponed. SLAC
leadership planned to discuss the
University's announcement and de
cide on further action this week.
Peck did not return a message left
last night. The spokesman for Stan
ford's unionized workers, Zev
Kvitky, and SEIU 715 Spokesman
John Vellardita did not return calls
for comment.
