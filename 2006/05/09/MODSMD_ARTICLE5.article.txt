## Journalists discuss anonymity,leaks 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
Two Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists potentially facing jail
time for protecting anonymous sources in high-profile national
security cases spoke to a half-full Annenberg Auditorium yester
day afternoon about leaks, accountability and the First Amend
ment.
The Supreme Court will announce next Monday whether it
will consider the appeals of The Los Angeles Times' Robert Dro
gin and The Washington Post's Walter Pincus, who have been held
in contempt for refusing to name government sources quoted
anonymously in 1999 about the alleged leak of classified informa
tion by Wen Ho Lee. Lee, the Los Alamos National Laboratory
scientist, is accused of leaking highly-classified nuclear informa
tion to the Taiwanese government.
Lee's lawyers have sued the federal government for violating
his privacy by releasing classified information about the case to
these reporters. The former government scientist has demanded
— and courts thus far have agreed — that Pincus and Drogin re
veal who in the government provided the private information
they used in their stories.
Drogin said he fears "copycat lawsuits" if the precedent set by
the U.S. Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit, stands.
"The Privacy Act is now being
turned upside down," he said. "The
danger is if these cases take off. It's
going to make covering these stories
that much more difficult."
The case, Drogin et. al. vs. Lee,
could become a landmark legal
precedent for journalism if the
Supreme Court decides to issue cer
tiorari. Attorney generals from 18
states and 34 news organizations
have filed amicus — friend of the
court — briefs arguing that the jus
tices should hear the case.
The Lee case is only one of many
in which journalists have been tar
geted. Using new legal techniques,
attorneys and federal prosecutors
have zealously pushed journalists to
reveal the names of anonymous
sources. High profile cases — in
cluding Valerie Plame's — have un
settled newsrooms at every level of
the media totem pole.
"In recent months, more and
more reporters are being prosecuted
for sheltering their sources," said
moderator Ann Grimes, a visiting
professor in the Communication
Department. "Many worry they
could be next."
The panelists agreed that a long
standing "gentleman's agreement,"
the tacit understanding journalists
had with federal prosecutors in the
wake of Watergate and the release of
the Pentagon Papers that they would
not be prosecuted for reporting clas
sified material, has been broken in
recent years.
"We're going through a period
where the administration, unlike
others, has broken whatever gentle
man's agreement existed," Pincus
said.
The ambiguity in the current
legal precedent and lack of a federal
shield law causes confusion as dis
trict courts take up confidential
source cases.
"I've discovered belatedly that
rights I thought I had were a result of
customs," Drogin said. "There needs
to be a clarification. Right now, it is
just all over the map.
"Where we're likely to end up is
that the courts have to step in and
create a common law privilege," he
added.
Law Prof. Kathleen Sullivan, who
also sat on the hour-and-a-half-long

panel, attacked the Bush administra
tion for excessively classifying docu
ments as secret and then selectively
leaking documents for political ad
vantage. She said a legal balance
should be struck where extenuating
circumstances, the type of case and
the nature of the leak are considered
by grand juries before they issue
subpoenas.
"I think a balance would be able
to take into account the external fac
tors," she said. "This is not an area
that seems easily susceptible to
bright line rules.
"Both sides should avoid violat
ing the gentleman's agreement —
the press shouldn't overuse it and
the government shouldn't over press
it," she added.
Sullivan said that there has not
been a constitutional guarantee for
reporters to shield sources from fed
eral prosecutors. Over the last centu
ry, prosecutors have used the Espi
onage Act of 1917 and other laws in
an attempt to force journalists to
talk. The Supreme Court has not
ruled on journalistic privilege since
Branzburg vs. Hayes in 1972.
"The court held in 1972 that the
First Amendment confers no special
privilege for journalists, at least
against grand jury subpoenas," she
said. Laws "generally apply to the
press as they do to anyone else," she
added.
Sullivan said courts have been re
luctant to create legal protection for
reporters because judges worry
about defining who constitutes the
"press," doubt that threats of sub
poenas will cause a chilling effect on
the media and believe that informal
safeguards protect journalists who
need it.
States have acted to protect re
porters by passing Press Shield Laws
on their own. Thirty-one states have
explicit laws protecting reporters
from being compelled to testify, and
every state but Wyoming has a com
mon law privilege allowing journal
ists to protect anonymous sources.
But federal prosecutors do not fall
under the scope of these laws.
Congress could pass a national
Press Shield Law, which would cre
ate special immunities for the media.
But Sullivan said she doubts that it
will ever pass a bill that makes it
harder for their committees to issue
subpoenas and conduct investiga
tions.
"It's not clear that Congress has
the political will to pass a federal
press shield law," she said.
