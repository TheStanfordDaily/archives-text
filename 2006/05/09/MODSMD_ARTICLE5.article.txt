## Journalists discuss anonymity,leaks 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
Two Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists potentially facing jail
time for protecting anonymous sources in high-profile national
security cases spoke to a half-full Annenberg Auditorium yester
day afternoon about leaks, accountability and the First Amend
ment.
The Supreme Court will announce next Monday whether it
will consider the appeals of The Los Angeles Times' Robert Dro
gin and The Washington Post's Walter Pincus, who have been held
in contempt for refusing to name government sources quoted
anonymously in 1999 about the alleged leak of classified informa
tion by Wen Ho Lee. Lee, the Los Alamos National Laboratory
scientist, is accused of leaking highly-classified nuclear informa
tion to the Taiwanese government.
Lee's lawyers have sued the federal government for violating
his privacy by releasing classified information about the case to
these reporters. The former government scientist has demanded
— and courts thus far have agreed — that Pincus and Drogin re
veal who in the government provided the private information
they used in their stories.
Drogin said he fears "copycat lawsuits" if the precedent set by
the U.S. Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit, stands.
