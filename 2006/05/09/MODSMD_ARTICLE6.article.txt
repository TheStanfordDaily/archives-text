## DARPA preparing for streets 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
Last October, Stanley, a Volkswagen Touareg R5
modified by the Stanford Racing team to drive au
tonomously, became the first robot ever to complete
the 131-mile Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency (DARPA) Grand Challenge. DARPA,the cen
tral research and development agency for the U.S. De
partment of Defense, began hosting the robotic race in
2(X)4 in an effort to push private researchers to develop
robotic technologies.
Now that the Grand Desert Challenge has been con
quered, DARPA announced a new Urban Challenge on May
l.The Stanford Racing Team said it plans to defend its title.
"This race is about urban driving. The types of prob
lems are merging into traffic, behavior at a four way
stop and interacting with pedestrians and other moving
vehicles," said David Stavens,a PhD student in comput
er science who was a key figure on last year's team. "It's
very different from the first grand challenge, which was
held entirely in the desert."
Urban environments provide a whole host of new challenges

for developing a robot that can successfully navi
gate an area.
"The biggest technological problem is being able to
see moving obstacles," Stavens said. "Previous percep
tion technologies only allowed us to see stationary
things. You have to be able to make a prediction about
where the obstacle is going to go."
The team plans on using one of three Volkswagen Pas
sat sedans donated to the project by Volkswagen. Stanley
— the robot who won last year's challenge — is sched
uled to be retired after a grueling year of desert testing.
"It will be outfitted very similarly to Stanley, but
with some new twists," Stavens said. "You'll see actuat
ed [moving] lasers on the car this time. Also, to drive at
high speeds, you need to see farther, so there will be
higher-powered lasers on the car. We're partnering with
APPLANIX.They build completely integrated naviga
tion systems for cars — like GPS but a lot better and at
a higher resolution."
ITiough early press releases from DARPA indicate that
a city of some kind will be used for the race, team members

Stanley, the Volkswagen robot that won last year's DARPA Grand Desert Challenge, will be retired for three Volkswa
gen Passats. The new vehicles will be prepared for an urban version of the race.
