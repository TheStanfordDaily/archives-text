## DARPA preparing for streets 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
Last October, Stanley, a Volkswagen Touareg R5
modified by the Stanford Racing team to drive au
tonomously, became the first robot ever to complete
the 131-mile Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency (DARPA) Grand Challenge. DARPA,the cen
tral research and development agency for the U.S. De
partment of Defense, began hosting the robotic race in
2(X)4 in an effort to push private researchers to develop
robotic technologies.
Now that the Grand Desert Challenge has been con
quered, DARPA announced a new Urban Challenge on May
l.The Stanford Racing Team said it plans to defend its title.
"This race is about urban driving. The types of prob
lems are merging into traffic, behavior at a four way
stop and interacting with pedestrians and other moving
vehicles," said David Stavens,a PhD student in comput
er science who was a key figure on last year's team. "It's
very different from the first grand challenge, which was
held entirely in the desert."
Urban environments provide a whole host of new challenges

for developing a robot that can successfully navi
gate an area.
"The biggest technological problem is being able to
see moving obstacles," Stavens said. "Previous percep
tion technologies only allowed us to see stationary
things. You have to be able to make a prediction about
where the obstacle is going to go."
The team plans on using one of three Volkswagen Pas
sat sedans donated to the project by Volkswagen. Stanley
— the robot who won last year's challenge — is sched
uled to be retired after a grueling year of desert testing.
"It will be outfitted very similarly to Stanley, but
with some new twists," Stavens said. "You'll see actuat
ed [moving] lasers on the car this time. Also, to drive at
high speeds, you need to see farther, so there will be
higher-powered lasers on the car. We're partnering with
APPLANIX.They build completely integrated naviga
tion systems for cars — like GPS but a lot better and at
a higher resolution."
ITiough early press releases from DARPA indicate that
a city of some kind will be used for the race, team members

were skeptical of the plausibility of running a hundred
driverless cars through a real city.
"We don't know for sure what city will be used
for the race," Stavens said. "I would be surprised to
see it in a real city,just because of the liability issues."
Computer Science and Electrical Engineering
Prof. Sebastian Thrun, director of the 150-person
Stanford A.l. Lab, will once again head the group.
A press release from DARPA describes the
Urban Challenge as a "simulated military supply
mission in a mock urban area" which will be 60
miles long.Teams will be expected to complete the
course in less than 6 hours. The race, like last year,
features a top prize of $2 million with a $500,000
second place award and $250,000 for third.
The challenge has practical applications as well.
According to Stavens, 43,000 people die per year on
America's roadways,due in large part to driver error.
"We hope that a smarter vehicle, one that is
more aware of its surroundings, can warn the driv
er or take some kind of action to save lives," he

said. "DARPA obviously has military applications
for this technology, and they will pursue that. But
we're participating in the challenge for the human
itarian component of it."
There are two tracks for competitors to take in
next year's grand challenge. One is very similar to
last year's procedure, which involves primarily pri
vate funding; the other track provides an opportu
nity for teams for apply for up to $1 million in re
search grants from the government. The Stanford
team intends to apply for the research grants to
fund their car in the upcoming challenge.
"In the past, a lot of schools were hesitant to
jump in full force and participate because it's a big
risk, you have to raise a lot of money and there's no
money up front," said Stavens. "This year, with the
grants, more strong robot-builders will compete
who may not have in the past."
Last year 195 teams competed in the desert.
Stavens predicts a jump in entrants due to the
availability of research grants. The Stanford team

is currently gearing up for the long trial.
"We're just getting started. DARPA has an
nounced the challenge; we're trying to read through
the rules to get a sense of what the challenge is and
what we're going to have to build," Stavens said.
The team's Volkswagen Passats will arrive in
June or July, two for testing only, and one for the
race. By July or August the team will be ready to
start working on the computer algorithms in the
car. Stavens said the team hopes to be doing au
tonomous city driving by the end of 2006, using the
next year to clean up loose ends.
There will be a national qualifying event in late Octo
ber 2007 and the final race is scheduled for Nov. 3,2007.
"This is much harder than the first Grand Chal
lenge," Stavens said. "The city is much harder sci
entifically. It's a little more nerve-wracking, but
we're scientists and we are excited about attacking
a really hard, state-of-the-art problem. We will be
strong. It's hard to say if we're the favorite, but
we're optimistic."

vate funding; the other track provides an opportu
nity for teams for apply for up to $1 million in re
search grants from the government. The Stanford
team intends to apply for the research grants to
fund their car in the upcoming challenge.
"In the past, a lot of schools were hesitant to
jump in full force and participate because it's a big
risk, you have to raise a lot of money and there's no
money up front," said Stavens. "This year, with the
grants, more strong robot-builders will compete
who may not have in the past."
Last year 195 teams competed in the desert.
Stavens predicts a jump in entrants due to the
availability of research grants. The Stanford team

is currently gearing up for the long trial.
"We're just getting started. DARPA has an
nounced the challenge; we're trying to read through
the rules to get a sense of what the challenge is and
what we're going to have to build," Stavens said.
The team's Volkswagen Passats will arrive in
June or July, two for testing only, and one for the
race. By July or August the team will be ready to
start working on the computer algorithms in the
car. Stavens said the team hopes to be doing au
tonomous city driving by the end of 2006, using the
next year to clean up loose ends.
There will be a national qualifying event in late Octo
ber 2007 and the final race is scheduled for Nov. 3,2007.
"This is much harder than the first Grand Chal
lenge," Stavens said. "The city is much harder sci
entifically. It's a little more nerve-wracking, but
we're scientists and we are excited about attacking
a really hard, state-of-the-art problem. We will be
strong. It's hard to say if we're the favorite, but
we're optimistic."
