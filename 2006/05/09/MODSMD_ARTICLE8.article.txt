## Procrastinators are people too 
### 
The hour between 4:30 and 5:30 last Fri
day will go down in Stanford history as
one of the least productive hours ever.
Bright young grad students, who have been
relentlessly advancing the frontier of science
and technology for years, abandoned their in
tellectual endeavors and swarmed the Clark
Center Auditorium to listen to the great pro
crastination-educator, Jorge Cham.
The author of the famed comic strip "Piled
higher and Deeper," like the Pied Piper of
Hamelin, used his charm to lure the Stanford
lab rats from their cultures and centrifuges.
The auditorium, full of grads sitting and
standing in every space available, listened with
rapt attention as Cham explained that it is okay
to not do research. Yes, most of us went for the
free food and a reason not to do work, but he
was actually very funny and useful (Needless to
say, this did not count toward our regular quota
of procrastination-able hours). With his razor
sharp logic and wit, he proved that procrastina
tion is not the same as laziness; hence, the stig
ma associated with the former is unwarranted.
If my notes are correct,'laziness' is not wanting
to do things at all, whereas 'procrastination' is
not wanting to do things right now.
Procrastinators do lots of stuff all the time;
they just don't do the things they should be
doing. Philosophy Prof. John Perry, in his im
mensely insightful and refreshingly readable
essay "Structured Procrastination," argues that
procrastinators can be motivated to do diffi
cult, timely and important tasks —as long as
these tasks are a way of avoiding something
more important. With self-deception, inflated
importance and fake deadlines, procrastinators
are ultimately useful citizens.
Douglas Adams, author of the classic
"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" series, also
condoned, commended and embraced procras
tination. Known to miss deadlines set by pub
lishers for months, he once said, "I love dead
lines; 1 like the whooshing sound they make
when they fly by." Isn't it unfortunate that many
of us well-educated grad students don't know
what the six-year-old Calvin knows: "I am
learning skills that 1 can use throughout the rest
of my life...procrastinating and rationalizing."
If anything is sufficiently important, it
should be done. If it needs to be done, it will get
done. If it's not being done, then probably it
doesn't have to be done. At least not for now.
Understand, however, that the prophets of
procrastination are selfless souls working for
the benefit of society. If you ever hear of any
one promoting the pros of procrastination,
chances are they are doing so to avoid doing
something else important. Consequently, they
are procrastinating by talking about procrasti
nation. Second, they have a selfish motive to en
courage numerous people to proclaim them
selves procrastinators—building a community
of procrastinators to gain acceptance in society.
Third, there is guilt and shame associated with
procrastination, which can be eliminated by
knowing that you are not alone. And most im
portantly, by writing (or talking) about procras
tination, the author also prevents readers from
doing anything else, curbing potential competi
tion from other procrastinators.

"Research papers due, home works few.
And a whole load of laundry to do;
Late in wishing the belated wishes,
When will I ever clean up the dishes;
Roommate is annoyed and advisor is dis
turbed.
But, my resolve to procrastinate is never
perturbed."
