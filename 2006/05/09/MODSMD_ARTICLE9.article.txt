# NANOWIRES: THE NEXT BIG LITTLE THING
## 
### Written By DAVID STEINHARDT 
Shuhong Li, a third-year graduate student in chemical engineering, is
tackling two major projects: nanowire self-assembly and semi-con
ductor patterning. Li has been working on these projects directly with
her academic advisor. Assoc. Prof. Zhenan Bao, who specializes in
nanostructures and microstructures with unknown electronic and photonic
properties.Together, Li and Bao have been working on the projects for near
ly two years. They recently published a paper on nanowire self-assembly and
are working on extending that research as well as continuing their investiga
tion into semi-conductor patterning.
For the average Stanford student, the mere topics of these projects sound
like gibberish, but Li explains them easily simply.
While Li's disposition is friendly and personable, nanowire assembly is
the exact opposite. Her project's aim is to discover a method to control the
assembly and alignment of nanowires—which, due to their size, is very dif
ficult. Nanowires—l(M) nanometers in length—are much too small to be
tested using current methods. If they could be controlled, however, they
offer an efficient and potentially cheap way to generate energy.
The set-up of Li and Bao's project begins with a porus aluminus, a plat
form on which the wires grow. Once the wires form in their pores, the porus
aluminus can be dissolved, isolating the wires. Li and Bao created silver mid
sections in the wires—as narrow as 20 nanometers —with gold ends because
gold is inert and highly conductive in order to test their electrical and chem
ical properties
Li and Bao then placed these nanowires in a solution and. once heated.

research in nanowire self-assembly

some of the wires bridged the gaps in the midsection, creating an electrical
connection.The same process with a different solution creates transistors in
the wires. As a continuation of the project, the duo is working on aligning the
wires so they can be even further controlled.
"When you have something very small and you want to know the electri
cal current going through it, you need to form a gap. then test particles in
that gap," Li says. The team has a pending patent for their work, which will
take two years to process.
Li and Bao have been working with nanowires in conjunction with Jef
ferey B.H.Tok from the Chemistry and Materials Science Directorate in
Livermore, Calif. They are also working with a German company called
Baden Aniline and Soda Factory (BASF), which provides them with organ
ic crystals for their ongoing semi-conductor project.
Li's experience at Stanford has urged her to continue contributing to the
chemical engineering field for years to come.
'Til probably be here for two more years, and then I hope to either work
in the [chemical engineering] industry or in a professor position." she says.
"All of the professors here have been amazing, especially my advisor."
Bao shared Li's positive sentiments for both the Chemical Engineering
Department and her fellow faculty.
"1 enjoy the collegial atmosphere of this department," Bao says. "My col
leagues are considerate and supportive. It's exciting that we are growing
into a larger department. We will be able to offer a broader range of research
projects and new courses to our students."
