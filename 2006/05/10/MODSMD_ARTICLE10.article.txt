The University announced a seven-person Dean's
List last month, rewarding coterminal student Adam
Coates and seniors Kiyome Burchill, Jonathan Chou,
Max Etchemendy. Jonathan Fetter-Vorm, Albert
Keung and Jason Ross with the Dean's Award for
Academic Accomplishment for the 2(X)5-2(X)b school
year. The honorees, including a philosophers cancer
researcher, a budding neurologist and a scholar of
multiracial movements, are recognized for exception
al intellectual achievement in scholarly research and
contributions to the Stanford community.
Kiyome Burchill, a double-major in comparative
studies in race and ethnicity (CSRE) and political sci
ence, was recognized for her work on her honors the
sis, "Beyond the Box: The Post-Census Politics of the
Multiracial Movement," focusing on the political di
mensions of the national multiracial movement. Dur
ing her sophomore year, Burchill also taught a course

on political and media representations of mixed race
people in the United States.
Biology student Jonathan Chou has worked for
three years with Neurology Prof. Yanming Yang on
understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying
neurodegenerative disease. Last year, Chou's work
on the protein gigaxonin and its role in early-onset
neurodegenerative disease was published in Nature
magazine. He is a previous recipient of fellowships
from the American Heart Association and Pfizer. He
plans to pursue a joint MD-PhD at the UC-San Fran
cisco next year.
Computer Science coterminal student Adam
Coates was recognized for his work with Artificial In
telligence Prof. Andrew Ng in developing an au
tonomous control system for piloting helicopters.
Coates' current work involves training helicopters to
do increasingly complicated maneuvers, including in
verted flight. Next year, he will begin PhD studies at
Stanford.
Philosophy and symbolic systems double-major
Max Etchemendy was recognized for his work on
Richard Rufus of Cornwall, a 13th century scholastic
philosopher, with Philosophy Prof. Rega Wood.
Etchemendy's translation of Rufus' Speculum Ani
mae has been adopted as a course text at Princeton
University.
Next year Etchemendy will be working for Over
stock.com on analytics.
History student Jonathan Fetter-Vorni. who stud
ies books and bookmaking, has completed a transla
tion and hand illustration of Beowulf, as well as and
an honors thesis on the literary and political contexts
of Guisto Gateppi.a 17th-century Florentine writer.
Biologist Jason Ross worked with Oncology Prof.

Irving Weissman on the identification of ovarian can
cer stem cells, and is writing an honors thesis based on
his research. In 2(X)4, he received a Dean's Award for
his work on bacterial pathogens with Biological Sci
ences Prof. Mary Beth Mudgett. Ross plans to contin
ue his work at the Weissman lab. Eventually he plans
to pursue a career in medical research.
Chemical engineering student Albert Keung was
recognized for his work on the use of organic mole
cules in geranium semiconductors. He will be pursu
ing a PhD in chemical engineering in the fall at UC-
Berkeley.
The honorees were enthusiastic about the re
search opportunities Stanford provides.
"Stanford is an exceptional place for doing under
graduate research," said Keung, who worked closely
with Chemical Engineering Prof. Stacey Bent on in
frared spectroscopy "Not only were professors and
graduate students supportive in giving so much of
their time and attention, but they created a culture of
open dialogue, discussion and learning.
"My undergraduate experience really cemented
my desire to pursue a career in research," he said.
The Dean's Award, which is given to anywhere be
tween five and 10 undergraduates each year, was es
tablished in 1988 by Tom Wasow, dean of undergrad
uate studies. Students are nominated by professors,
and then selected by a committee of deans from the
Schools of Humanities and Sciences, Earth Sciences
and Engineering.
"The deans thoroughly enjoy this process because
it allows them to see dimensions of student achieve
ment that cannot be conveyed by transcripts alone,"
said Renee Courey, associate director of Undergrad
uate Research Programs.
