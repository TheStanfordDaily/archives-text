# Boot Camp bridges divide between Windows and Mac

In March, hardcore geeks praying for a way to run their fa
vorite arcane role-playing game, available only for Windows, on
their Mac received their salvation from Jesus. Jesus Lopez, that
is — a San Francisco programmer who won a $13,(XX) prize by
writing a patch enabling the Windows operating system to run
on Macintosh computers. Even better, Apple jumped on board
and in April released a beta version of Boot Camp, a simpler
program designed for the same function, enabling software de
signed for Windows to be run on a Macintosh.
In addition to enabling Macs to run programs written for
Windows, Boot Camp also allows people using the Windows op
erating system on their Macintosh to use the Mac's hardware
devices — with a few exceptions, like the Bluetooth device in
stalled on newer Macs.
Boot Camp takes users through a step-by-step process of
partitioning their hard drive and making a boot disk to install
Windows XP. When installation is complete, a screen appears on
startup giving the user the option of starting their computer in
Mac mode or Windows mode. In the end. Boot Camp creates
separate hard drive space for each operating system, a fact that
accounts for its unusually-high free hard disk space require
ment of 10 gigabytes.
"We think Boot Camp makes the Mac even more appealing
to Windows users considering making the switch," Philip
Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of Worldwide Product
Marketing, said in an Apple press release. The release also said
that, while Boot Camp is only in a beta version now, future ver
sions of OSX will carry it.
And initial reviews have been positive. Walter Mossberg, in
the Wall Street Journal, reported that "in Windows mode, the
iMac was blazingly fast — far faster than my two-year-old H-P
Windows computer. Every function of Windows I tested, includ
ing Web browsing, email and music playback, ran flawlessly"
There are some caveats. A few instances of problems have
been reported. Some computers, after Boot Camp is installed,
freeze when the user chooses to work on the Mac operating sys
tem. This leaves them only able to use Windows without com
pletely wiping their computer's memory and starting anew.
On the financial side. Boot Camp may be free, but to run it
you still need a copy of Windows — which runs $199 for the
Home version or $299 for the Pro version. Of course, you could
theoretically also borrow a PC-owning friend's copy. And it
only works on newer Macs made since January, which run on
the same Intel chips that power PCs. The other option for run
ning PC software on such a Mac is through a program sold by
software company Parallels, which runs at $49 not counting the
cost of Windows. And according to Mossberg, it's slower than
Boot Camp anyway. For older Macs, the only solution is Virtual
PC — software published by Microsoft that costs $2(X) and is.
also according to Mossberg, "painfully slow ..[it] can't handle
some demanding programs, like games."
Still, the increased compatibility promised by this device
may hold great promise. Perhaps it will be a step towards recon
ciling eternally divided PC- and Mac-lovers.
