## Editorial Luck of the Draw: Trading spaces? 
### 
Recently, the Editorial Board has writ
ten several pieces on the spring hous
ing lottery. We questioned the system
of priority applications ("Luck of the Draw:
A matter of priorities?," May 1), applauded
most of the proposed changes to the housing
system ("Housing's master plan," May 8)
and highlighted the biggest problems with
the Draw ("Luck of the Draw: What are its
drawbacks?" May 9).
In our final editorial on the Draw, we'd
like to put forward a radical idea for improv
ing the system. We propose that students be
allowed to trade rooms with each other after
they have been assigned.
The logic behind our proposal is quite
simple. People's preferences change
throughout the course of the Draw, even
after housing assignments have been pub
lished. Perhaps your group was split up and
you decide you're willing to accept less desir
able housing so you can all live in the same
dorm. Or perhaps you and your drawmates
get assigned to a co-op, but change your
minds about wanting to cook and clean on a
regular basis. If students were allowed to
communicate their preferences with each
other — via online postings on the Residen
tial Education Web site, for example — and
trade housing assignments, all involved par
ties would be better off.
These trades should not be restricted to
the end of spring quarter after Draw results
are made known. Rather, they should be al
lowed to take place on a rolling basis every
quarter. After all, our needs and living situa
tions change quarterly. Many students leave
for and return from overseas programs each
quarter. Under the current system, reassign
ment can be a lengthy and uncertain process.
But under our proposal, we would be able to
swap rooms with each other and make the

most of our living arrangements.
There are many other reasons in favor of
trading rooms on a quarterly basis. Perhaps
your financial situation has changed unex
pectedly and you want the option of moving
to a co-op to avoid having to pay for a meal
plan. Maybe you recently discovered that
you and your roommate have incompatible
sleeping habits. Why stick it out for a quarter
or two when someone might be happy to
switch places with you?
The major problem with this solution is
that some students could abuse the system by
paying for more desirable housing. If a group
of drawmates was desperate to get into a Row
house and knew people who got assigned to
the Row, they may be tempted to offer some
form of monetary compensation in exchange
for better rooms. Taken to an extreme, this
system could result in wealthy students living
on the Row, while less affluent students get
stuck in Wilbur or Stern. The University
would have to impose severe penalties to pro
hibit such monetary transactions.
Clearly, our proposal to improve the
Draw is not perfect. There are many techni
cal difficulties that stand in the way of its suc
cessful implementation. But in putting
forward this revolutionary idea, the Board
hopes to encourage more creative thought
about the Draw. Too often, students and
University administrators are limited by a
lack of imagination. Meanwhile, we have al
lowed our housing assignment system to be
come confusing and inflexible.
In principal, introducing greater flexibili
ty into the Draw is the key to improving the
state of student housing on campus. Coming
up with new ideas for the lottery system —
however bizarre and outlandish they may
seem at first — is crucial to making our ail
ing housing system more responsive.
