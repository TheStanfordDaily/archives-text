# Return of ninjas v. pirates
## 
### 
This column was originally published
May 17,2005. In light of recent events,
the author feels it is still pertinent to
life on campus — it's not just because he's
being lazy.
Alright, that does it. I'm tired of these
ceaseless "debates" that are nothing more
than one group talking at the other, spewing
venom without making any head way. Our
campus has been in an uproar over this last
week; things have been tenser than a
Newsweek editors' meeting.
I'm talking, of course, about the annoy
ing debate between the Ninjas and the Pi
rates. Last week was the beginning of Ninja
Respect Month and also Pirate Pride Week,
a scheduling conflict that is equivalent to
hosting a presidential address the same
night as the World Series.
Although The Daily reported about
Ninja Pride Week, the Pirates were remark
ably absent in the press. When I went to
White Plaza, though, all I saw was Pro-Pi
rate demonstrations. The Pirates had
planned a"Blackpearl Remembrance Day"
that happened to coincide with Ninja Week.
Both groups held rallies peacefully, but their
sentiments were about as peaceful as an A's
fan-base.
It all centers on what happened several
decades ago.The Pirates and the Ninjas had
an altercation that they to this day, are still
fighting about. Something about a pirate
wench they both claimed, I dunno. She's
pretty old now, bruised and rough. But they
are still fighting over her.
No, instead of flipping out and killing
everyone as an unstoppable partnership
that would leave robots, chickens, and robot
chickens in fear, they remain divided.
Unfortunately, despite our progressive
minded university's best intentions, no one
has curbed this hatred. While both groups
speak of "pride" for their group and claim
that they want "peace," such statements al
ways prelude bashing the other group.
Being pro-Ninja means that you condone
Ninja killings of Pirates, or that you are
Anti-Piratical. It's them or us. You can't
show pride in being a Pirate or a Ninja with
out then saying how "the Ninjas are yellow
bellied bastards" or "the Pirates lack honor
or good hygiene."
I'm tired of the scare tactics, too. Both
sides try to play to our sympathies by depict
ing the horror of the other side. Posters and
ads about ritualistic seppuku and walking
the plank get grim after a while. As I walked
around campus this last week, I felt really ir
ritated. Both were claiming the others were
saying hate-speech, but they turned a blind
eye, or eye-patch, to their own group's hate
ful words.
Captain Bluebeard of the Piratical Pride

group spoke last week, giving a keynote
speech in White Plaza: "Yarr, a pirate's life
for me." The crowds of Pirates in the audi
ence, wooden-legged, swash-buckling and
parroted, all cheered. The comment was
shortly followed by, "The Ninjas are mur
derous, treacherous bastards." This too re
ceived cheers, and the hisses of disagree
ment from the black-clad forms of the Nin
jas.
The Ninjas, for their part, were doing tra
ditional Ninja demonstrations: guitar solos.
But when asked about the anti-Ninja state
ments made by the Pirate Captain. Black
Death Shadow said: "Honestly. I'm hurt.
We're trying to celebrate the first great gui
tar solo of our forefathers and here they are
picking a fight with us. Not cool." He then
executed a triple flip before disappearing
into the shadows.
While violence between the two groups
has not occurred as of yet, tensions are on
the rise. Every year the campus becomes di
vided over the issue, and every year the stu
dent population forgets about it for the
other 11 months out of the year. Some pes
simists (and visual effects artists) just want
to see them have at it in a fantastical display
of martial arts, swordplay and nun-chucks.
But personally, 1 think the two groups can
settle their differences through peaceful
means.
This will start with each group agreeing
to stop hiring outside speakers to incite near
riots every other week. Why, during Ninja
Pride Week, do the Ninjas feel the need to
bring in a former Pirate Wench who now
hates Pirates? How does that aide the dia
logue? It shouldn't then be a surprise when
the Pirates hire an equally vehement anti-
Ninja speaker who considers Ninja "war
mongers" and "wack guitar players."
I think both groups have valid concerns.
I also think both will probably want me
dead after writing this column. I just think
that at a certain point they should be able to
talk to each other, stop making broad
sweeping statements about the other groups
and realize they both have things in com
mon: they are total bad-asses and can pick
up babes like dude, you don't even know.

Chris should probably say something bad
about The Review because this is Adam Had
Wound's column. Send complaints to
