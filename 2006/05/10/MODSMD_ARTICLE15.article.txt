# Sunshine and Sweeps
## 
### 
Sunshine and flowers may be what most
people associate with the month of May.
For me. however. May is an epic time of
agony and ecstasy, for this is the crucial peri
od of television Sweeps. What does this mean
in practical terms? Season finales, majorly
dramatic TV happenings and critical net
work announcements of what's in store for
next year.
TV. of course, is a business. Advertisers
want to spend their top dollars when they
know the most people will be watching; net
works want to create popular shows that will
draw the largest audiences and thus bring in
the most advertising money. Advertisers de
cide how they to structure their budgets in
November. February and May — the months
known as Sweeps periods. So that's when the
networks break out their special mini-series
events, and individual shows air their most
dramatic and/or "very special" episodes. And
because May is also finale time, it's the most
important, and theoretically exciting, TV
time of the year.
At this point, it's pretty clear that I'm
quite the TV aficionado. Sometimes, when
making this admission at a place like Stan
ford. I'll encounter the haughty oh-no-I'm
too-intellectual-for-television responses.
There's nothing incompatible in intellectual
i/.ing and enjoying TV. But in any case, a de
fense of the cultural importance of television
is not the subject at hand.
Today's take-home point is that this May
is even more notable than usual because of
the dissolution of the WB and UPN. which
will merge into the awkwardly-named new
station, "The CW" (apparently, the "C"
stands for CBS and the "W" is for Warner

Bros.) They say they'll be combining the best
thematically-matched programming from
both networks with new shows; when they
announce their fall programming during next
week's "Upfronts," their master plan will be
revealed.
But for now, we have graduations (what
will become of "The OC" if the central char
acters leave Newport?), weddings, births and
deaths, with plenty of cliffhangers thrown in
for good measure. TV movies like the "Dy
nasty" reunion probably aren't aimed at our
age group, but still the fashion statements
alone are unbeatable.
This week is pretty action-packed.
Monday was the (sob!) series finale of "7th
Heaven." Yes, I know that it is quite possi
bly the worst show on TV (keep in mind
that in the pilot episode of this wholesome
family drama 10 long years ago, Mary tried
to convince her brother Matt to practice
kissing with her — and it was only down
hill from there). But it's so mockable that
it's always been amusing. TUesday was the
finale of "Gilmore Girls," and the second
season end of my favorite show, "Veronica
Mars."
There's something comforting about hav
ing an hour-long break every week to indulge

in a favorite TV show. Sadly, this will soon be
over. May Sweeps usually turn out some of
the best programming of the year, but it ends
all too quickly and we're left in the four
month summer drought.
Often the quality of programming that ap
pears during summer is barely an improve
ment over static or infomercials. This year,
there will be the usual mix of reality shows
and new series that networks don't have
much faith in (now who's excited about
"TUesday Night Book Club" on CBS? Any
one?). And since many of us have oodles
more time to devote to couch-potato-ing
during the summer than we have during the
school year, this is particularly tragic. In
stead, we have to entertain ourselves with re
runs, or perhaps DVDs of previous seasons
of shows that we may have missed.
But fortunately, when summer is getting
stale and the Stanford move-in begins, there
will be a whole new season of TV just begin
ning. We'll learn what occurs in the moments
following all those May cliffhangers —
though we may have forgotten what hap
pened four long months ago. And we'll see
whether the CW will sink or float. Thrilling,
I know.
And speculation aside, there's nothing to
be done now but to take an hour or two off of
midterms or paper-writing to enjoy the high
drama that May brings. And once you've
done that, you can get back outside to enjoy
the sunshine and flowers. Or whatever you're
supposed to do in May.
Marissa is trying to deal with the fact that she'll
he abroad next fall and won t have access to her
TV. Console her at marissak@stanford.edu.
