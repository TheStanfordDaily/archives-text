Holt's harangue is not based on fact
Chris Holt makes two unfounded assertions in his latest column
("At the CIA company picnic," May 8).
First, the suggestion that President Bush "can't keep a steady
leader at the helm" of the CIA is groundless. Porter Goss' 18-
month tenure as director of Central Intelligence (DCI) exceeded
that of half a dozen previous DCIs. By reappointing George Tenet
after his election in 2000. Bush made him one of the longest-serv
ing DCIs in the agency's history. General Hayden.if confirmed, will
be the third CIA director under Bush. There were also three DCIs
under Clinton.
Second, the suggestion that General Hayden would overturn
CIA tradition by bringing in a "military mindset" is misguided. Of
the 19 former DCIs, all but three had prior military experience.They
included four admirals, two generals and two deputy secretaries of
defense (a civilian position within the Pentagon). Of the 20 former
deputy directors, all but four had prior military experience.They in
cluded five generals of the Air Force, Murine Corps and Army, one
Navy admiral and a deputy secretary of defense. The agency some
how has managed to endure.
