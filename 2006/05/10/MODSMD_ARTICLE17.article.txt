## Judas'gospel reconsidered 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
Two religious studies professors painted a
fantastic picture of the Gospel of Judas and the
early Christians who wrote it — now labeled
heretics by some — at the Stanford Humani
ties Center last night. Using examples from the
text itself, they outlined some of the Gospel's
more outrageous claims; including the notion
that Judas is destined to ascend to the kingdom
of heaven and return one day to rule the Earth.
The heavily attended talk was conducted by
Emeritus Religious Studies Prof. Robert Greg
gand and Wabash College Prof. Robert Royal
ty, who was a professor of religion at Stanford
from 1993 to 1999.
According to Royalty, the Gospel of Judas
was only recently translated from a handful of
fragments written in Coptic — an ancient

Egyptian language — which languished in a
bank vault for thirty years. It has been dated to
approximately the second century after the
birth of Christ.This text was among many doc
uments, including the Gospels of Thomas.
Peter and Mary, which were written by a splin
ter sect of Christianity called Gnosticism.
Gregg and Royalty described the central
contention of the Gospel—that the God of the
Israelites, and by extension the Christian Bible,
is a lesser celestial being named Saklas. In the
Gospel, it is this being who created humanity in
his own image. Because of this, humanity is a
lesser, material race whose soul is on loan from
Saklas and is not immortal.
According to their reading of the Gospel.
Jesus is not the son of the Israelite God. In
stead, he is an emissary who has been sent by
an even higher being to deliver the truth to hu
manity. In the Gospel, Judas is the only disciple
capable of recognizing Jesus' true nature. For
this he is one of the only humans who can as
cend to heaven, and the Gospel states that
Judas "will come to rule over them.''
Royalty remarked on the science-fictional
aspects of the Gospel.
"When I talk about Gnosticism I talk about
each element of the myth with a clip from the
Matrix," he said. "There are a lot of similarities.
The idea is that there is something wrong with
this world. And you really want to escape from

this world. But there are enforcers to keep you
here. And there's a messenger who has been
sent to guide you."
Royalty described why there is so much in
terest in the (iospel of Judas.
"This is a very religious country," he said in
an interview with Hie Daily. "It's a very Chris
tian and a very post Christian country. And
there are a lot of people who are still interest
ed in orthodox, mainstream Christianity, but
ate not quite happy with it. And they are look
ing for something that they can sort of fit in.
"And if there is a rejected vision from early
Christianity that fixes it, that's just great," he
continued."And that's what's feeding the pop
ular interest. Christianity took a wrong turn
somewhere, Ihat's been said since the second
century. The history of Christianity is reform
ers saying that you took a wrong turn some
where.'lhis is just one more version of that."
Gregg added that the purpose of the semi
nar was to delve into what the Gospel actually
says.
"We advertised the event as something
where we expected people to read the text and
try to understand what the text said." he said.
" You cann< »t adopt a spiritual sensitivity on the
basis of a document not yet accepted as canon
ical. I don't see how its possible to endorse this
Christian writing that did not make the cut un
less you read and understand it."
