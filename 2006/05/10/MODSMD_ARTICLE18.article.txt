## Five-hour battle ends in victory Phelps drives in the winning run with a single in the 15th; Marquess’ lineup card looking like something from preschool art class 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
Stanford baseball fans probably aren't very familiar
with freshman Grant Escue — but if the rookie infield
er out of Washington. 111., keeps up his current pace, he
might soon find himself penciled into the lineup as an
everyday starter.
In a five-hour marathon of a baseball game, Escue's
two-run double in the 12th set the stage for senior Chris
Lewis' double in the 15th to clinch an 8-4 victory for
Stanford.
Heading into last evening, Escue had just one colle
giate at-bat — a pinch-hitting assignment nearly two
months ago in a 16-7 blowout loss to Southern Califor
nia. But Escue made the most of the opportunity, driv
ing in fellow freshman Brent Milleville with a two-out
RBI single in the top of the ninth inning.
So when yesterday's contest between the Cardinal
and the Broncos reached the 12th inning with the score
tied at 2-2, Stanford head coach Mark Marquess decid
ed to give Escue another shot.
Marquess sent the righty up to bat in place of fresh
man Austin Yount with runners on second and third,
and once again Escue came through in the pinch.
The freshman ripped a double to left-centerfield
that brought two runs around to score and put the Car
dinal up 4-2. But although the hit preserved Escue's
perfect 1 .(XX) batting average, it wasn't enough to clinch
the win for Stanford, as the Broncos came back with
two runs of their own in the bottom of the 12th.

But Stanford kept fighting, and with one out in the
top of the 15th, freshman Cord Phelps singled through
the right side to bring home leftfielder Joey August.
Lewis then provided the crushing blow with a two-run
double to left that plated Phelps and senior shortstop
Chris Minaker. Lewis later scored on a wild pitch to ac
count for the Cardinal's eighth and final run.
But the team didn't breathe its final sigh of relief
until freshman righthander Max Fearnow got Broncos
shortstop Michael Lange to ground into a game-ending
fielder's choice in the bottom of the 15th. With his four
inning effort, Fearnow earned the win to improve to 2-
0 on the year.
The marathon affair was easily the Cardinal's
longest contest of the year — and by the time all was
said and done. Marquess' lineup card likely looked like
something a preschooler would bring home from art
class. Twenty-two Stanford players appeared in the
game, and only five of the team's starters remained in
the lineup for the duration of the game.
Lewis had the most productive evening for the Car
dinal, collecting three hits in seven at-bats while driving
in two and scoring twice. Phelps, Escue and third base
man Randy Molina also drove in runs for Stanford. Mi
naker, who yesterday was named Pac-10 Player of the
Week after hitting .467 with three homers and five RBI
from May 1-8, went just l-for-7 against the Broncos.

the Cardinal. Starter Nolan Gallagher opened by toss
ing three scoreless innings before giving way to fresh
man southpaw Sean Ratliff, who then pitched the next
three innings while allowing just one earned run.
With the game a stalemate, sophomore Erik Davis
entered in the bottom of the seventh. He probably
pitched more than he had bargained for, but the
righthander stepped up admirably by limiting the Santa
Clara offense to just one hit in five scoreless innings.
Fearnow was unable to hold the two-run lead in the
bottom of the 12th after coming on in relief of Davis, but
the Broncos couldn't muster anything else over the final
three innings of the contest.
But there will be no rest for the Cardinal, who hit the
