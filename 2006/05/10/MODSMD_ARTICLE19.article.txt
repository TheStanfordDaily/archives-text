# Cal rivalry is the best in the west
## 
### 
Last weekend Stanford and Cal
played a three game series at
Sunken Diamond. Unsurpris
ingly, the series provided some of the
most exciting and competitive base
ball that the Cardinal have played all
year. Sunday's game brought the
largest crowd of the season to the
ballpark and the fans were not disap
pointed, as Stanford took a dramatic
6-4 victory to claim the series win.
Last weekend's match up just so
lidified why Stanford-Cal is a great ri
valry. While it may not be football
season and Big Game is still months
away, I think it is as good a time as any
to look at what makes this rivalry as
good as any west of the Mississippi.
I.They hate us: To illustrate this one,
just imagine strolling down Tele
graph Avenue wearing your red Stan
ford sweatshirt. It might not be as bad
as that time I wore my Bonds jersey
to Dodger Stadium, but there is no
doubt you will catch some abuse.
Whether it is because they didn't get
in, are jealous of our sunny days or
the color red just irritates them, near
ly every Cal student resents Stanford
for something.
2. We kind of hate them: The feeling
here is much less passionate, but we
still have some general disdain of Cal
students. I'm not sure what fuels it —
maybe it is the lack of showering on
their part. But mostly, it's just the fact
that they hate us that rubs us the
wrong way.
3. The rivalry covers sports and be
yond: Our rivalry with Cal extends
well beyond the football field. We
have the Big Meet, the Big Swim, the
Big Splash, the Big Debate and, of
course, the Big Race to build a new
stadium first (which we are about to
win, by the way), just to name a few.
Every time we play Cal at anything
— be it Quiz Bowl,soccer or baseball
— it is the biggest event of the year.
4. The rivalry is evenly matched:
Stanford and Cal have two of the best
athletic programs in the country.
While it may not feel like now, for the
most part, we win some and they win
some. A rivalry needs two worthy
sides to last.
5. The rivalry has its defining mo
ments: While we may not like to re-

What Bonanza!
member back to "The Play," that one
moment captures the rivalry between
Stanford and Cal. Because that one
play happened over twenty years ago,
Stanford and Cal will always be rivals.
We've had ours (see: 54 Big Game
wins), but that moment solidified that
the Big Game will always be the most
meaningful on the schedule.
6. There's a cool trophy: What would
a rivalry be without something you
can taunt your opponent with? The
Axe has been around since 1899 and
has been the trophy for the winner of
the Big Game ever since. You throw
in the Immortal Twenty-One and the
rest of the Axe's great history, and
you have a meaningful token. Now if
only we had the Axe ...

6. Berkeley and Palo Alto —so
close, yet worlds apart: One is urban.
One couldn't be more suburban.
They see us as elite snobs. We see
them as dirty hippies. It's all about
where you live.
7. The rivalry never dies: Once a Stan
ford fan, always a Stanford fan. The
same can be said for Cal. My mom, a
Stanford alum, still comes to football
games. I love to see the diehard base
ball, basketball, football or whatever
fans who are in their fiftieth year of
coming to games. I'm pumped that I
am part of a rivalry that will still be
with me when I'm 75.
It may be spring,but that's the cool
thing. There is always some sport,
some event, something that will bring
out the competition between us and
the weenies from across the Bay.
