## Bush, fellows plan library and legacy 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
During his visit to campus last month.
President George W. Bush asked senior
Hoover Institution fellows for advice re
garding his legacy and presidential library.
The New York Times reported Monday.
At an early reception, Bush spoke for
over an hour with Hoover fellows about a
whole gamut of policy issues facing his ad
ministration — namely nuclear prolifera
tion, Iraq, Social Security and Medicare.
Hoover Director John Raisian told The
Daily that Bush spoke candidly for about
75 minutes with an estimated 35 invited
guests at the home of former Secretary of
State and Hoover Fellow George Shultz.
After the reception. Bush stayed for din
ner at Shultz's home with an estimated
dozen invited guests. Elisabeth Bumiller
wrote in her White House Letter that Bush
grilled Raisian "about the pros and cons of
having an organization like Hoover within
the confines of an institution like Stanford."
Bush has already created a selection
committee, chaired by former Commerce
Secretary Don Evans, to choose a site for
his presidential library. As part of this li
brary, Bush has said publicly that he wants
to incorporate a special policy center.
The New York Times reported that
Evans visited Stanford several months ago
to meet with Raisian about policy centers.
In a January interview. Bush told Bob
Schieffer of CBS News that he wanted the
center to research democracy — a central
part of the president's foreign policy agenda.
"I would like to leave behind a legacy or
a think tank, a place for people to talk
about freedom and liberty, and the de Toc
queville model," he said in the interview.
The Times reported that guests at the din
ner recommended the library "have a
strong affiliation with a university, with
joint appointments of scholars. But they
said he should make a deal that would es
tablish his institutional identity."
Stanford University has maintained a
rocky relationship with the Hoover Institu
tion at times. TTie Institution provided
much of the intellectual heft in the Reagan
administration and several senior Bush ad
visers have been culled from the Tower.
The University's more liberal professors
balked in the 1980s when Stanford was
considered to serve as the home of the
Reagan Presidential Library. In response,
the site was changed to Simi Valley, Calif.
— a more conservative enclave than the
predominately liberal Bay Area.
Bush has purportedly narrowed his list
of potential library sites to Southern
Methodist University (SMU), the Univer
sity of Dallas and Baylor University in
Waco, Tex.
The Times reported that SMU is best
positioned as both the alma mater of First
Lady Laura Bush and the home of some of
the president's most ardent and wealthy
supporters.
