# MEN'S TENNIS
## Card ready for NCAA tourney 
### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The week has started off well for Stanford
men's tennis, as the squad was well-represent
ed in the All-Pac-10 selections released Mon
day. However, don't count on the No. 13 Cardi
nal (15-3, 6-1 Pac-10) to rest on their laurels.
Stanford looks to finish out the week strong,
hosting the first and second rounds of the up
coming NCAA tournament.
Just like the women, the men are slated to
take on Quinnipiac in the first round, with the
women playing on Friday at 3 p.m. and the men
playing on Saturday at noon. Under Coach
Mike Quitko, both Bobcat teams won their
third straight Northeast Conference titles in
April.
"We don't know much about them and we
don't really know what to expect," junior
James Pade said. "But I know we'll be ready to
play."
Because of their standing in the Pac-10, the
Cardinal earned the privilege of hosting the
first and second-rounds. The Stanford men are
11-1 at Taube Family Tennis Stadium this sea
son, with their lone loss coming to Baylor in

February.
On Sunday at 11 a.m., the winner of the
Stanford-Quinnipiac match will then take on
the winner of the Saturday 9 a.m. match be
tween UC-Santa Barbara (14-10) and No. 20
California (15-6,5-2).
"If we survive [the first-round] and keep

going, we're going to be excited to play our
next opponent and we're looking forward to
that challenge," Coach John Whitlinger said.
"If we can get by Quinnipiac, then it's either
UCSB or Cal. If it's Cal, we know them pretty

well and they know us pretty well
too."
However. Whitlinger refused to
look any further than his squad's
first-round match up.
"1 don't want to look too far
ahead, because if you start doing
that, you get yourself in trouble," he
said. "We're taking it one at a time.
We just want to get the four points
before the other team and get onto
the next round."

While a match up between Bay
Area rivals would result in a com
petitive contest that would draw a
large crowd, the Cardinal know the
Bobcats have had recent success
under Sitko. In addition to the
three straight conference titles, this
year's trip to the Tournament
marks Quinnipiac's third in as
many years.
"We don't know a lot about
[Quinnipiac], but it's the NCAA
tournament," Whitlinger said.
"We're taking everybody very seri
ously and that's just as important of
a match as the next one we play."
But should the seeding hold,
Stanford will face Cal on Sunday
morning in what would be the third
match up between to the two teams
this season. Stanford picked up Feb
ruary's contest at home, 6-1, and
dominated on the road, winning 5-2
at Berkeley in April.
"The team's really excited about
that match," Pade said. "It should be
a very tough match. We've already
played two good matches with Cal.
but it would be nice to come back
and play them here at home."

The Bears have two ranked play
ers: No. 6 Conor Niland and No. 89
Tyler Browne. Niland entered the
Pac-10 individual tournament with
an impressive 19-1 record, including
wins over top-ranked Benjamin
Kohlloeffel of UCLA and No. 4 Lars
Poerschke of Baylor. However,
down in Ojai. Calif, two weekends
ago, Stanford freshman Matt Bruch
handed Niland his second loss of the
season.
Bruch checked into the most re
cent rankings at No. 16, and senior
KC Corkery made the top 25 as well.
Junior James Wan, recent Pac-10 sin
gles runner-up, jumped into the
rankings at No. 66. In doubles,Cork
ery teamed with Pade to earn the
No. 16 ranking in the nation.
These same four players earned
All-Pac-10 honors on Monday.
Bruch and Corkery were named
First-Team All-Pac-10, while Pade
and Wan were elected Second-
Team. Bruch was also chosen as
Newcomer of the Year, and
Whitlinger was named as the Pac-10
Men's Coach of the Year.
Stanford proved to he the domi

nant team on Monday, as only three
players from No. 10 UCLA and just
two from Cal earned honors.
"[Pac-10 Coach of the Year is] a
nice honor, hut there are a lot of
people that were involved to be able
to get an honor like that," Whitlinger
said. "I had a lot of help with it, from
[assistant coaches] Dave Hodge and
JJ [Whitlinger] and the team, obvi
ously. I'm proud of all those guys
and all their honors — First-Team
for Matt and KC and Second-Team
for James and James — very well
deserved. It reflects the sort of year
we've had: it was a very, very good
year but we want to make it an even
better year."
Pade echoed similar sentiments.
"We've had a great season," the
junior said. "We've had a couple
slipups throughout the season, but
that's mainly because we've been
missing guys due to injuries. So I re
ally do think that we can make a se
rious dent in the tournament. Every
body's just got to play their best.
We've been building towards May
all year, so I'm hoping we'll perform
the way we should."

California (15-6,5-2).
"If we survive [the first-round] and keep

going, we're going to be excited to play our
next opponent and we're looking forward to
that challenge," Coach John Whitlinger said.
"If we can get by Quinnipiac, then it's either
UCSB or Cal. If it's Cal, we know them pretty

well and they know us pretty well
too."
However. Whitlinger refused to
look any further than his squad's
first-round match up.
"1 don't want to look too far
ahead, because if you start doing
that, you get yourself in trouble," he
said. "We're taking it one at a time.
We just want to get the four points
before the other team and get onto
the next round."

While a match up between Bay
Area rivals would result in a com
petitive contest that would draw a
large crowd, the Cardinal know the
Bobcats have had recent success
under Sitko. In addition to the
three straight conference titles, this
year's trip to the Tournament
marks Quinnipiac's third in as
many years.
"We don't know a lot about
[Quinnipiac], but it's the NCAA
tournament," Whitlinger said.
"We're taking everybody very seri
ously and that's just as important of
a match as the next one we play."
But should the seeding hold,
Stanford will face Cal on Sunday
morning in what would be the third
match up between to the two teams
this season. Stanford picked up Feb
ruary's contest at home, 6-1, and
dominated on the road, winning 5-2
at Berkeley in April.
"The team's really excited about
that match," Pade said. "It should be
a very tough match. We've already
played two good matches with Cal.
but it would be nice to come back
and play them here at home."

The Bears have two ranked play
ers: No. 6 Conor Niland and No. 89
Tyler Browne. Niland entered the
Pac-10 individual tournament with
an impressive 19-1 record, including
wins over top-ranked Benjamin
Kohlloeffel of UCLA and No. 4 Lars
Poerschke of Baylor. However,
down in Ojai. Calif, two weekends
ago, Stanford freshman Matt Bruch
handed Niland his second loss of the
season.
Bruch checked into the most re
cent rankings at No. 16, and senior
KC Corkery made the top 25 as well.
Junior James Wan, recent Pac-10 sin
gles runner-up, jumped into the
rankings at No. 66. In doubles,Cork
ery teamed with Pade to earn the
No. 16 ranking in the nation.
These same four players earned
All-Pac-10 honors on Monday.
Bruch and Corkery were named
First-Team All-Pac-10, while Pade
and Wan were elected Second-
Team. Bruch was also chosen as
Newcomer of the Year, and
Whitlinger was named as the Pac-10
Men's Coach of the Year.
Stanford proved to he the domi

nant team on Monday, as only three
players from No. 10 UCLA and just
two from Cal earned honors.
"[Pac-10 Coach of the Year is] a
nice honor, hut there are a lot of
people that were involved to be able
to get an honor like that," Whitlinger
said. "I had a lot of help with it, from
[assistant coaches] Dave Hodge and
JJ [Whitlinger] and the team, obvi
ously. I'm proud of all those guys
and all their honors — First-Team
for Matt and KC and Second-Team
for James and James — very well
deserved. It reflects the sort of year
we've had: it was a very, very good
year but we want to make it an even
better year."
Pade echoed similar sentiments.
"We've had a great season," the
junior said. "We've had a couple
slipups throughout the season, but
that's mainly because we've been
missing guys due to injuries. So I re
ally do think that we can make a se
rious dent in the tournament. Every
body's just got to play their best.
We've been building towards May
all year, so I'm hoping we'll perform
the way we should."
