## Card ready for NCAA tourney 
### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The week has started off well for Stanford
men's tennis, as the squad was well-represent
ed in the All-Pac-10 selections released Mon
day. However, don't count on the No. 13 Cardi
nal (15-3, 6-1 Pac-10) to rest on their laurels.
Stanford looks to finish out the week strong,
hosting the first and second rounds of the up
coming NCAA tournament.
Just like the women, the men are slated to
take on Quinnipiac in the first round, with the
women playing on Friday at 3 p.m. and the men
playing on Saturday at noon. Under Coach
Mike Quitko, both Bobcat teams won their
third straight Northeast Conference titles in
April.
"We don't know much about them and we
don't really know what to expect," junior
James Pade said. "But I know we'll be ready to
play."
Because of their standing in the Pac-10, the
Cardinal earned the privilege of hosting the
first and second-rounds. The Stanford men are
11-1 at Taube Family Tennis Stadium this sea
son, with their lone loss coming to Baylor in

February.
On Sunday at 11 a.m., the winner of the
Stanford-Quinnipiac match will then take on
the winner of the Saturday 9 a.m. match be
tween UC-Santa Barbara (14-10) and No. 20
California (15-6,5-2).
"If we survive [the first-round] and keep

going, we're going to be excited to play our
next opponent and we're looking forward to
that challenge," Coach John Whitlinger said.
"If we can get by Quinnipiac, then it's either
UCSB or Cal. If it's Cal, we know them pretty
