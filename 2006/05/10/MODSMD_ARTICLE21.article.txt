# MEN'S GOLF
## Freshmen out to prove themselves 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES STAFF WRITER 
It took freshman Dodge Kemmer
one whole year to get back to where he
felt most comfortable — in contention
for a tournament title. Competing in
the Pac-10 Championship in Rancho
Mirage, Calif.. April 24-26, Kemmer
was in a tie for fifth after three rounds.
"It's the first time I've been there
since I've been out of [high] school," he
said. "I've been in that position a lot
during my junior career, and it felt
good to be back in contention. I wasn't
nervous or anything; I was just going to
try to win. And it was a great feeling,
knowing I had the possibility."
Kemmer's performance was a long
time in the making after a year of
adapting to collegiate golf. After tying
for 60th at his first college event, the
Gopher Invitational, and suffering
through other disappointing finishes in
the fall. Kemmer quickly faced the im
portance of consistency at the colle
giate level.
"The biggest difference was the
more challenging courses, especially at
the Gopher," he said. "When you hit a
bad shot on a harder course, it costs
more because it's harder to make up
for it. This past summer, and in junior
tournaments, I probably hit as many
poor shots, but it was easier to recover.
As a result I would shoot a couple over,
instead of seven or eight over."
But Kemmer learned: he needed to
work on reducing his poor shots and
improving his course management.
And under the guidance of Coach Con
rad Ray and his experienced team
mates, Kemmer did just that.
The effort paid off as his results
steadily improved. Kemmer cracked
the top 30 at the University of Hawaii-
Hilo Waikoloa and placed in the top 20
at the U.S. Intercollegiate in the spring.
"I definitely feel that I've pro
gressed, not so much in the technical
parts of my game as in getting used to
playing at the college level." he said.
"[l've been better] able to manage
these harder courses, and to eliminate
the bigger numbers that cause bad
rounds."
So after earning his spot on Stan
ford's Pac-10 Championship roster,
Kemmer was ready to prove himself in
his first postseason event. Confident in
his knowledge of the course and his
game, Kemmer said he was "less con
cerned with trying to score well and
play better" than "with just trying to
enjoy it."
"The intimidation of playing col
lege golf had pretty much passed by
then," Kemmer said. "1 was excited
to get back on the team, and 1 was
ready to help them out again."
After two even-par (71) rounds,
Kemmer was in ninth, and after a
one-under third round finish he
moved up to a tie for fifth. While he
slid back with a two-over final
round to finish tied for tenth, the
tournament was the perfect excla
mation point on a year of hard
work.
"I feel like I've been able to play
like that all year," Kemmer said.
"There have been individual
rounds where I have, but I just
haven't put a whole tournament to
gether — that was the big step."
This off season, Kemmer knows
he'll have to work on his consisten
cy to make sure he can take that
"big step" again and again.
"Just because 1 was able to put a
few rounds together at the Pac-10
[tournament], it doesn't mean my
course management work is done,"
he said. "I have to continue working
on that, and there's always room for
improvement everywhere, in all as
pects of my game. I'm just trying to
sharpen everything, and if it can
save me a stroke or two here and
there, then that's the goal."
But meanwhile. Kemmer is
shooting to make Stanford's squad
at the NCAA Western Regional in
Tucson, Ariz.. May 18-20.
"I think we feel really good
about our chances at the regional,"
he said. "There are a bunch of guys
that are playing really well right
now. We've been ready for a break
through tournament all year, and
there's no better time than now."
And just like his team, Kemmer
is ready to move on to greater suc
cess. He hopes that his finish at the
Pac-10 Championships was only a
stepping stone to even greater suc
cess.
"To date, it is [the highlight of my
year]," Kemmer said. "Hopefully,
though, I can make the regional and
the NCAA Championship the high
light."

Sophomore Rob Grube was named the Pac-10 Co-Golfer of the Year. He finished
in the top 10 in eight of his 11 tournaments this season. The honors are nothing
new to Grube, who was crowned the Pac-10 Freshman of the Year in 2005.
