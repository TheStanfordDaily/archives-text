## Freshmen out to prove themselves 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES STAFF WRITER 
It took freshman Dodge Kemmer
one whole year to get back to where he
felt most comfortable â€” in contention
for a tournament title. Competing in
the Pac-10 Championship in Rancho
Mirage, Calif.. April 24-26, Kemmer
was in a tie for fifth after three rounds.
"It's the first time I've been there
since I've been out of [high] school," he
said. "I've been in that position a lot
during my junior career, and it felt
good to be back in contention. I wasn't
nervous or anything; I was just going to
try to win. And it was a great feeling,
knowing I had the possibility."
Kemmer's performance was a long
time in the making after a year of
adapting to collegiate golf. After tying
for 60th at his first college event, the
Gopher Invitational, and suffering
through other disappointing finishes in
the fall. Kemmer quickly faced the im
portance of consistency at the colle
giate level.
"The biggest difference was the
more challenging courses, especially at
the Gopher," he said. "When you hit a
bad shot on a harder course, it costs
more because it's harder to make up
for it. This past summer, and in junior
tournaments, I probably hit as many
poor shots, but it was easier to recover.
As a result I would shoot a couple over,
instead of seven or eight over."
But Kemmer learned: he needed to
work on reducing his poor shots and
improving his course management.
And under the guidance of Coach Con
rad Ray and his experienced team
mates, Kemmer did just that.
The effort paid off as his results
steadily improved. Kemmer cracked
the top 30 at the University of Hawaii-
Hilo Waikoloa and placed in the top 20
at the U.S. Intercollegiate in the spring.
"I definitely feel that I've pro
gressed, not so much in the technical
parts of my game as in getting used to
playing at the college level." he said.
"[l've been better] able to manage
these harder courses, and to eliminate
the bigger numbers that cause bad
rounds."
So after earning his spot on Stan
ford's Pac-10 Championship roster,
Kemmer was ready to prove himself in
his first postseason event. Confident in
his knowledge of the course and his
game, Kemmer said he was "less con
cerned with trying to score well and
