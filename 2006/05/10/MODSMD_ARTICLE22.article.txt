# WOMEN'S TENNIS
## Taking it one match at a time at the NCAAs 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
Six matches stand between women's tennis
and its third-straight national title.The Cardinal
only have to win six more — which seems like
nothing compared to the 80 consecutive victo
ries they have notched since they last lost, to
Florida in the 2(X)3 NCAA Championship.
Plus, Stanford hasn't lost a match at home
since 1999 — and the next six matches will all
be held here, at Taube Tennis Center, as Stan
ford hosts the first-ever combined NCAA tour
ney, with the best men's and women's teams all
converging on the Farm for the next few weeks.
However, Stanford refuses to rest on its lau
rels.
"Complacency is not something we do," sen
ior co-captain Alice Barnes said. "We don't
practice three-and-a-half hours a day to get
complacent at NCAAs, because we know that
one slipup and you can be out. We may lose, but
another team will have to beat us. We're not
going to beat ourselves."
The first order of business will be to dispatch
Quinnipiac (11-10) of Hamden, Conn., which
secured a spot in the 64-team draw by eking out
a 4-3 win over Long Island State in the North
east Conference tournament title match. The
Bobcats finished their regular season below
.500, with an 8-10 record,but have earned auto
matic bids to the last two NCAA tournaments

In addition to the team championships starting this weekend, sophomore Celia Durkin will compete
in the NCAA Singles Championship, after being awarded an un-seeded berth last Thursday.
as well. They lost to Stanford in the
first round of their first-ever NCAA
appearance in 2004.
"We're not underestimating
Quinnipiac," Barnes said. "They
practice just as much as we do, and it's
not like they're just coming out here
for a holiday.They want to win, too."
Stanford's first-round match
against the Bobcats will take place
Friday at 3 p.m. If the Cardinal ad
vance to the second round, they will
confront either No. 28 Brigham
Young (20-7) of the Mountain West
Conference or No. 38 Arizona (12-
11) at 3 p.m. on Saturday.
Both those squads downed Den
ver, Oklahoma, Oregon, Washington
and Washington State during the reg
ular season this year, but never faced
each other.
Despite Brigham Young's
stronger record and seeding, Arizona
has a very real chance of defeating
the Cougars Friday at noon. Arizona
faced very tough competition in the
Pac-10, with five conference teams
finishing the season in the top 25.
Stanford has not played Brigham
Young this year, but beat Arizona
during both of this season's match
ups, 7-0 at home and 4-1 on the road.
"We've played Quinnipiac before,
so we'll be delighted to see them back

out here. If we get past that, we have a
known opponent if Arizona wins and
more of an unknown if BYU does.
Still, we're not so concerned with the
competition this weekend as we are
just excited to get back on the courts
in team mode."
Players have not played a dual
match since defeating California on
April 22 and have not competed at all
since the Pac-10 Individuals April 27-
30. Nervousness might be a factor, as
the expectations of NCAAs com
pound the anticipation of competing
after a several-week wait.
"Especially since it's NCAAs, we
can't wait to start playing again," sen
ior Joanna Kao said."We're ready for
the break to be over."
"I'm so excited for my fourth and
final NCAAs," senior Jessica Leek
agreed. "We have a great team, but
most importantly, we always have a
great time — it's honestly my fa
vorite time of year."
And though Stanford has won it
all the last two seasons, Barnes insists
the team is very focused on Friday's
match — and nothing else.
"Yes, a championship is six match
es away, but all we're thinking about
is Quinnipiac because that's what we
have in front of us now," she said.
"Everyone on the team is looking re
ally good right now, and we're pre
pared."
Following this weekend's first
and second-round matches, the six
teen teams that remain will face off at
Stanford starting on May 18.
