# WOMEN'S TENNIS
## Taking it one match at a time at the NCAAs 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
Six matches stand between women's tennis
and its third-straight national title.The Cardinal
only have to win six more — which seems like
nothing compared to the 80 consecutive victo
ries they have notched since they last lost, to
Florida in the 2(X)3 NCAA Championship.
Plus, Stanford hasn't lost a match at home
since 1999 — and the next six matches will all
be held here, at Taube Tennis Center, as Stan
ford hosts the first-ever combined NCAA tour
ney, with the best men's and women's teams all
converging on the Farm for the next few weeks.
However, Stanford refuses to rest on its lau
rels.
"Complacency is not something we do," sen
ior co-captain Alice Barnes said. "We don't
practice three-and-a-half hours a day to get
complacent at NCAAs, because we know that
one slipup and you can be out. We may lose, but
another team will have to beat us. We're not
going to beat ourselves."
The first order of business will be to dispatch
Quinnipiac (11-10) of Hamden, Conn., which
secured a spot in the 64-team draw by eking out
a 4-3 win over Long Island State in the North
east Conference tournament title match. The
Bobcats finished their regular season below
.500, with an 8-10 record,but have earned auto
matic bids to the last two NCAA tournaments
