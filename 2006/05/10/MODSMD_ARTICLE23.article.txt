## Tough regional tournament ahead for Card Pebble Beach practice an unorthodox way to prepare; top eight of 21 advance to NCAA Finals 
### BY CARSON COOPER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Errant drives and blown putts are no longer acceptable, as each
stroke will be critical this week — it's the postseason.
The Stanford women's golf team travels today to Washington for
the NCAA West Regional, set to begin tomorrow morning. Com
peting for the Cardinal will be senior Kelly Husted, juniors Lauren
Todd and Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana, and freshmen Ki-Shui Liao
and Mari Chun.
The Cardinal will face tough opposition in the three-day tourna
ment at the Washington National Golf Club in Auburn. Wash., run
ning through Saturday. Stanford is seeded seventh in a field head
lined by No. 2 UCLA, who recently claimed the Pac-10 Champi
onship.
Stanford aims to finish in the top eight of the 21 teams in Wash
ington to earn an automatic bid to the NCAA Championships.
"We would like to take first,"Tangtiphaiboontana said. "But re
alistically, we're just trying to make sure we finish in the top eight."
The Card are coming off a seventh place finish in the Pac-10
Championships. Chun took eleventh overall, but it was Husted and
Tangtiphaiboontana who were named Honorable-Mention All-
Pac-10 golfers.
No. 5 Georgia and Big-10 champions No. 8 Purdue are also in
Stanford's western bracket this weekend. Other Pac-10 rivals in the
regional include No. 19 Arizona and No. 24 Washington, as well as
unranked Oregon State and Washington State.
The team has prepared for their biggest tournament of the year
in a unique fashion. Instead of fine-tuning their games on the Stan
ford course, the team traveled to Pebble Beach for a practice-tour
nament with California, who will not be participating in the West
Regional.
"We were all a little surprised when Coach O'Connor told us
we would be practicing with Cal," said Tangtiphaiboontana. "We
are friendly and all, but when it comes down to it, they are our
biggest rivals."
