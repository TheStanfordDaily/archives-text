# Destination: Yosemite
## Low turnout common for Spring trips; dorms try a variety of outings

For resident assistants (RAs) across campus, shoring
up dorm enthusiasm for a weekend trip during mid-quar
ter mayhem can be daunting. Yet, for those who brave the
challenge and plan a trip, resident attendees say they are
overwhelmingly grateful.
Last weekend, dorms including Kimball and Roble
made their annual treks to Yosemite National Park, a place

where students are free to hike, play catch, take photos, tell
canipfire stories, make s'mores and otherwise frolic in the
natural beauty of the park's picturesque landscape.
Picking an ideal location for Yosemite camping can be
difficult, and reservations must be made months in ad
vance, said senior Roble RA Chris Kanand. Many opt to
stay in Yosemite Valley, located near cliffs and waterfalls
and a prime spot for hiking.
Other dorms plan a wide variety of weekend outings
ranging from Santa Cruz beach trips to rafting excur
sions. Some smaller dorms, like francos, avoided the
stress of a weekend-long Yosemite venture and planned
an overnight trip to Beyond Limits Adventures, where
residents rafted river waters northeast of Sacramento.
