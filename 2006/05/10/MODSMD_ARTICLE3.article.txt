# Destination: Yosemite
## Low turnout common for Spring trips; dorms try a variety of outings 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For resident assistants (RAs) across campus, shoring
up dorm enthusiasm for a weekend trip during mid-quar
ter mayhem can be daunting. Yet, for those who brave the
challenge and plan a trip, resident attendees say they are
overwhelmingly grateful.
Last weekend, dorms including Kimball and Roble
made their annual treks to Yosemite National Park, a place

where students are free to hike, play catch, take photos, tell
canipfire stories, make s'mores and otherwise frolic in the
natural beauty of the park's picturesque landscape.
Picking an ideal location for Yosemite camping can be
difficult, and reservations must be made months in ad
vance, said senior Roble RA Chris Kanand. Many opt to
stay in Yosemite Valley, located near cliffs and waterfalls
and a prime spot for hiking.
Other dorms plan a wide variety of weekend outings
ranging from Santa Cruz beach trips to rafting excur
sions. Some smaller dorms, like francos, avoided the
stress of a weekend-long Yosemite venture and planned
an overnight trip to Beyond Limits Adventures, where
residents rafted river waters northeast of Sacramento.
"We had some epic moments on the river, including water

fights and pirate raids on the other
boats where we tried to board and
throw members off," said junior Lind
say Rand, a resident inTrancos."lt was
just a really good time with a good
group of people."
The downside of these rafting
trips is that they are expensive, which
forces organizers to take on the

sometimes difficult task of convinc
ing the dorm to subsidize the trip,
said junior Drew Jacoby-Singhor.
Staff members are often exhausted
from organizing ski trips, so non-staff
who want an outdoors outing are
often left to shoulder the planning.
"I don't think a lot of dorms go
rafting because there are a lot of lo
gistics in the planning," Rand said.
"The most frustrating thing was get
ting people to come because the
RAs didn't help us organize."
Despite their appeal, spring trips
often suffer from low attendance be

cause of their timing. For instance,
only 13 percent of Trancos residents
attended the rafting trip, while Roble
boasted a small turnout of only 27 res
idents.
Many dorms choose not to sched
ule Yosemite trips in early spring be
cause of lingering winter ice, which
forces planners to push excursions
back to the fifth and sixth weeks of
the quarter — a busy time for most
residents, said senior College Assis
tant Dana Ung from
Freshman/Sophomore College.
Some, like Kanand, said that alco

hol was not a concern because
Yosemite does not provide a party
friendly atmosphere.
"It is hard to party because there
are quiet hours that are generally en
forced by park rangers, and people
are too exhausted from hiking all
day to rage," Kanand said.
Aside from the logistical hurdles
and inconvenient timing, many resi
dents said they enjoyed the experi
ence. For some, these trips are more
than just another Yosemite outing —
they are memorable, first-time
camping experiences.
