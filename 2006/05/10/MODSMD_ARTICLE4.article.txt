## Crown Library off limits Undergrads barred from Law Library during Reading and Finals Week 
### SHIRIN SHARIF SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Undergrads looking for a quiet study spot in the Robert
Crown Law Library to survive the midterm crunch are out of
luck — their SUID cards won't get them access to the library
until May 19, during the Law School's reading and examination
period.
The new policy went into effect on Friday after law students
complained about undergraduates taking over their turf during
Dead Week and finals week last quarter. On March 19, for ex
ample, there were SOS undergraduate visits and 295 law student
visits to the Law Library. The mere 120 seats in the first floor
reading room filled quickly, mainly with undergraduates, said
Library Director J. Paul Lomio.
Despite undergraduate efforts, which included a "Fetch Law
Library Night" and a Facebook group championing their cause.
Law Dean Larry Kramer announced the policy last month. It is

even once is likely to
impugn a reputation for
years if not longer, and
reputation is incredibly
important to budding
lawyers."

rules will solve the prob

19, which was the night
before finals began for
undergraduates and a
time when they will still

Library.
Undergraduates are
being asked to take their
studying elsewhere dur
ing reading and examina
tion periods due to the
specialized resources
available only in the Law
Library for law students
— who often have to
complete comprehensive
take-home finals that, in
some courses, solely ac
count for their final

grades. These resources include access to the legal materials at
the reserve desk, materials reserved by professors and use of
dedicated legal printers provided by Lexis and Westlaw.
Many law students complained about the disruptive behav
ior of undergraduates in the Law Library. Law students said
they could identify the undergrads as the root of the noise
problems because of the Law School's small size and their abil
ity to recognize their graduate peers. Some said that under
graduates were more likely to be using cell phones in the first
floor study area as well.
"I have no problem giving a friend a dirty look, sending an
IM or sending an email, if they are being disruptive," said sec
ond-year law student Dana Powers. "Mostly this is unnecessary,
however, because law students are already accustomed to exist
ing social norms. Acting like a jackass even once is likely to im
pugn a reputation for years if not longer, and reputation is in
credibly important to budding lawyers."
