## Crown Library off limits Undergrads barred from Law Library during Reading and Finals Week 
### SHIRIN SHARIF SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Undergrads looking for a quiet study spot in the Robert
Crown Law Library to survive the midterm crunch are out of
luck — their SUID cards won't get them access to the library
until May 19, during the Law School's reading and examination
period.
The new policy went into effect on Friday after law students
complained about undergraduates taking over their turf during
Dead Week and finals week last quarter. On March 19, for ex
ample, there were SOS undergraduate visits and 295 law student
visits to the Law Library. The mere 120 seats in the first floor
reading room filled quickly, mainly with undergraduates, said
Library Director J. Paul Lomio.
Despite undergraduate efforts, which included a "Fetch Law
Library Night" and a Facebook group championing their cause.
Law Dean Larry Kramer announced the policy last month. It is

"Acting like a jackass
even once is likely to
impugn a reputation for
years if not longer, and
reputation is incredibly
important to budding
lawyers."

unclear how the new
rules will solve the prob
lem for days like March
19, which was the night
before finals began for
undergraduates and a
time when they will still
have access to the Law
Library.
Undergraduates are
being asked to take their
studying elsewhere dur
ing reading and examina
tion periods due to the
specialized resources
available only in the Law
Library for law students
— who often have to
complete comprehensive
take-home finals that, in
some courses, solely ac
count for their final

grades. These resources include access to the legal materials at
the reserve desk, materials reserved by professors and use of
dedicated legal printers provided by Lexis and Westlaw.
Many law students complained about the disruptive behav
ior of undergraduates in the Law Library. Law students said
they could identify the undergrads as the root of the noise
problems because of the Law School's small size and their abil
ity to recognize their graduate peers. Some said that under
graduates were more likely to be using cell phones in the first
floor study area as well.
"I have no problem giving a friend a dirty look, sending an
IM or sending an email, if they are being disruptive," said sec
ond-year law student Dana Powers. "Mostly this is unnecessary,
however, because law students are already accustomed to exist
ing social norms. Acting like a jackass even once is likely to im
pugn a reputation for years if not longer, and reputation is in
credibly important to budding lawyers."
Law students have noticed a difference in the library's at-
Law students have noticed a differ
ence in the library's atmosphere since
Friday, when it was closed to all other
students.
Powers said the library was "less
crowded and less noisy."
Second-year law student Ryan
Clark emphasized the competitive
and stressful nature of final exams, in
which students are often graded
against each other.
"To allow the marginal utility of
the Law Library that undergrads
would get out of access to trump the
potential impact on our ability to
study or write would be unfair to those
who pay to attend the Law School,"
Clark said.
In addition to closing the library to
non-law students during Law School

reading and examination weeks,
Kramer worked with students, staff
and faculty to make three other deci
sions about the future of the Law Li
brary. Rules forbidding cell-phone use
and disruptive noise in the library will
be strongly enforced, new student car
rels would be added and the Law
School would look into renovating the
library's second floor to create more
study space.
"We have plans to expand and im
prove study areas in the library,"
Lomio said. "But until we are able to
expand capacity, if there is serious
overcrowding then the policy will
most likely remain in effect for read
ing and examination periods, at least
in the short-term."
Some undergraduates questioned
whether closing off the Law Library
was unfair.
"I think Stanford is a community,
and that enrolled students should be
allowed to use all of the facilities of
the University," said senior Matt

Stolzar. "Just as law students are al
lowed to use Green Library, under
graduates should he allowed to use
the Law Library and its resources."
Law students were not united in
agreement on the new policy as well.
First-year student Tyler Anderson
said there were roughly 15 people on
the entire first floor to the Law Li
brary on Sunday night at 10 p.m.
Meanwhile, people who wanted to
study were being turned away because
they were not law students.
"I do not think it is fair to restrict
Law Library access to undergrads,"
Anderson said. "Yes, it's annoying
when 1 can't find a seat 1 want at the li
brary. However, it's also annoying
when my favorite table at Starbucks is
taken or the movie I want to rent is
checked out. This doesn't mean that 1
should ban other people from access
ing them. Restricting access among
members of the same community is a
bad policy. I think that overcrowding
in the Law Library is an issue that

could be better addressed by either
expanding the existing space here or
making improvements to other study
areas on campus."
Other law students pointed out
that the restriction will last only two
short weeks.
"Considering that our finals only
come around twice per year, I don't
think that it is unfair to restrict access
to law students for those brief periods,
and to the undergrads who are upset,
we'll just buy them a drink (milk for
the under-age ones)," said second
year law student Ryan Brumberg.
Many other law schools restrict li
brary access to their students during
exam periods, and many others do not
allow any undergraduate access to the
libraries, except for checking out ref
erence materials, law students said.
Harvard, New York University, the
University of Pennsylvania, Columbia
and Duke also have restrictions on ac
cess during study periods, according to
the schools' Web sites.
