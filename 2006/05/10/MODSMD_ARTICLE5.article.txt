### MARIE-JO MONT-REYNAUD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A crowd of approximately 60 students
and community members gathered in
White Plaza at noon yesterday to eat im
sakhan — Palestinian chicken wraps —
and commemorate Nakha Day. Nakba. or
"the Palestinian Catastrophe," marks the
58th anniversary' of the Arab-Israeli War,
during which 7(X),(XX) Palestinians left Is
rael between 1947 and 1948.
As part of the Palestine Awareness
Month sponsored by The Coalition for
Justice in the Middle East (CJME), Mus
lim Students Awareness Network

(MSAN) and the Outreach to Asian Im
migrant Students (OASIS), organizers set
up 6-foot-tall mock wall structures. Ac
cording to senior Tanya Haj-Hassan, a co
founder of CJME, the structures repre
sented the real 25-foot-tall and 220-mile
long fence along the Green Line, the truce
border from the end of the 1948 War of In
dependence.

tor Tala al-Ramahi, a junior, opened the
event with a poem. It was followed by a
presentation from Naura Erakat of the
U.S. Campaign to End the Occupation. Er
akat,of Palestinian descent,painted a vivid
picture of the current Palestinian state as
an issue of indigenous and human rights,
which she compared to the struggles of
South Africans under Nelson Mandela,
African Americans in the Black Panther

party and Native Americans.
TTiat hundreds of thousands of Pales
tinians fled was not "collateral damage,"
she said hut rather Israelis "program of ex
pulsion of indigenous people."
Mandela was once called a terrorist, Er
akat said, though he is now revered as a
freedom fighter.
"Give me a few more years and no one
will be able to say that Palestinians are not
freedom fighters," she said.
Erakat derided House of Representa
tives Resolution 4681 — a proposal to re
strict United States humanitarian aid to
the Palestinian Authority. The resolution
would designate the Palestinian territory
as a "terrorist sanctuary" in response to the
recent Palestinian election where the

themselves up.

Hamas party won a decisive and unex
pected victory, she said.
A number of the speakers, including
Erakat, argued against H.R. 4681, saying
it was the result of the powerful Jewish
lobby and groups such as the American-
Israeli Political Action Committee
(APAC).
"It's APAC's baby," she said.
To chants of "no justice, no peace,"
Palestinian rappers Iron Sheik and Ex
centrik performed songs — one dedicat
ed to Condoleezza Rice entitled "Neo
con love song" — criticizing the Bush ad
ministration on the issue of democracy
promotion.
In Sheik's view, the administration's
actions have been hypocritical — initially
claiming to support democracy in the
Middle East and among Palestinians, and
then turning around and condemning the
Palestinians when they chose "the wrong
candidate." he said.
English Prof. Hilton Obenzinger, who
introduced himself as someone whose
family was murdered by the Nazis, ex
pressed solidarity with the Palestinian
people and argued strongly for the Pales
tinian refugees' right of return.
Originally estimated around 400 thou
sand in 1948, the number of Palestinians
who consider themselves refugees has
grown to 4.6 million over the past 50 years.
Obenzinger illustrated his point about
Israeli settlements being segregationist
by encouraging listeners to "imagine an
all-white community created in I larlem."
Throughout the presentations, criti
cisms of Israel and the United States were
strong and often inflammatory, with sev
eral references to Israel as an apartheid
state.
"Most of their events are inciting
against Israel," said sophomore Roei
Kashi, "rather than building their own
communities."
Kashi, who spent three years in the Is
raeli army, sees the current conflict as a
story of two refugee communities. In the
19505, his grandmother was forced to
leave Kurdistan where her father was one
of the most successful merchants, while
his grandfather was kicked out of Persia
because he was Jewish. Both sought safe
ty in Israel. At the same time, Jewish
refugees from World War II were enter
ing Israel and Palestinians were being
kicked out.
At that point, he said, there were two
refugee communities that had to build

"We could say, no we won't do any
thing until we get back what we lost," he
said, referring to his ancestors' wealth in
Kurdistan and Persia, and the Palestini
ans' land in Israel. "Or we can say 'we are
here now, let's build up our countries.'
"From this situation, from desert, Is
rael became one of the leaders in agricul
ture and high tech," Kashi said. "The
Palestinians, however, call it a catastro
phe because they choose to make it a ca
tastrophe. They could educate their chil
dren differently and invest in education.
But instead they choose to incite and
blame Israel, which doesn't contribute
anything. Last week we had Israeli Inde
pendence Day and it was a celebration.
This one is called The Catastrophe' be
cause what they choose to do is lament."
Sophomore Avishai Weiss of the Stan
ford-Israel Alliance disagreed strongly
with the negative portrayal of an
"apartheid state" protected by a "wall."
"It is a fence not a wall," he said."Only
small parts of it around Palestinian cities
are walls because snipers in high apart
ment buildings were shooting people
driving along on the highway that runs
along the Green Line."
He defended the fence as a passive
and proven mechanism of defense
against terrorism, saying that it has effec
tively stopped terrorist attacks on coastal
cities originating in the West Bank.
Al-Ramahi maintained that the Jew
ish state is discriminatory.
"The apartheid system is not merely
associated with Israel's wall," al-Ramahi
said. "The system of Israel being an exclu
sive Jewish homeland where there are
separate laws for non-Jews is another ex
ample of Apartheid."
Jon Katz, an administrator at Hillel,
disagreed with the speakers' arguments,
particularly about the resolution in the
House. By electing Hamas, Palestinians
were choosing a party that, in its charter,
directly called for the destruction of Is
rael.
"Let's be honest, if someone is saying
"I want you dead,' would you really think
they're interested in negotiating?" Katz
said. He agreed with Weiss that the meas
ures proposed were legitimated by the
fact that the Palestinian territories are
now governed by terrorists.
The Palestinian organizers said that
celebrations like Nakba are important to
remember culture and their political
plight.
"To keep the Palestinian culture
alive, we must call for justice to the
Palestinian people and demand equal
human rights that every nation de
serves," Al-Ramahi said.

Throughout the presentations, criti
cisms of Israel and the United States were
strong and often inflammatory, with sev
eral references to Israel as an apartheid
state.
"Most of their events are inciting
against Israel," said sophomore Roei
Kashi, "rather than building their own
communities."
Kashi, who spent three years in the Is
raeli army, sees the current conflict as a
story of two refugee communities. In the
19505, his grandmother was forced to
leave Kurdistan where her father was one
of the most successful merchants, while
his grandfather was kicked out of Persia
because he was Jewish. Both sought safe
ty in Israel. At the same time, Jewish
refugees from World War II were enter
ing Israel and Palestinians were being
kicked out.
At that point, he said, there were two
refugee communities that had to build

"We could say, no we won't do any
thing until we get back what we lost," he
said, referring to his ancestors' wealth in
Kurdistan and Persia, and the Palestini
ans' land in Israel. "Or we can say 'we are
here now, let's build up our countries.'
"From this situation, from desert, Is
rael became one of the leaders in agricul
ture and high tech," Kashi said. "The
Palestinians, however, call it a catastro
phe because they choose to make it a ca
tastrophe. They could educate their chil
dren differently and invest in education.
But instead they choose to incite and
blame Israel, which doesn't contribute
anything. Last week we had Israeli Inde
pendence Day and it was a celebration.

cause what they choose to do is lament."
Sophomore Avishai Weiss of the Stan
ford-Israel Alliance disagreed strongly
with the negative portrayal of an
"apartheid state" protected by a "wall."
"It is a fence not a wall," he said."Only
small parts of it around Palestinian cities
are walls because snipers in high apart
ment buildings were shooting people
driving along on the highway that runs
along the Green Line."
He defended the fence as a passive
and proven mechanism of defense
against terrorism, saying that it has effec
tively stopped terrorist attacks on coastal
cities originating in the West Bank.
Al-Ramahi maintained that the Jew
ish state is discriminatory.
"The apartheid system is not merely
associated with Israel's wall," al-Ramahi
said. "The system of Israel being an exclu
sive Jewish homeland where there are
separate laws for non-Jews is another ex
ample of Apartheid."
Jon Katz, an administrator at Hillel,
disagreed with the speakers' arguments,
particularly about the resolution in the
House. By electing Hamas, Palestinians
were choosing a party that, in its charter,
directly called for the destruction of Is
rael.
"Let's be honest, if someone is saying
"I want you dead,' would you really think
they're interested in negotiating?" Katz
said. He agreed with Weiss that the meas
ures proposed were legitimated by the
fact that the Palestinian territories are
now governed by terrorists.
The Palestinian organizers said that
celebrations like Nakba are important to
remember culture and their political
plight.
"To keep the Palestinian culture
alive, we must call for justice to the
Palestinian people and demand equal
human rights that every nation de
serves," Al-Ramahi said.
A crowd of approximately 60 students
and community members gathered in
White Plaza at noon yesterday to eat im
sakhan — Palestinian chicken wraps —
and commemorate Nakha Day. Nakba. or
"the Palestinian Catastrophe," marks the
58th anniversary' of the Arab-Israeli War,
during which 7(X),(XX) Palestinians left Is
rael between 1947 and 1948.
As part of the Palestine Awareness
Month sponsored by The Coalition for
Justice in the Middle East (CJME), Mus
lim Students Awareness Network

(MSAN) and the Outreach to Asian Im
migrant Students (OASIS), organizers set
up 6-foot-tall mock wall structures. Ac
cording to senior Tanya Haj-Hassan, a co
founder of CJME, the structures repre
sented the real 25-foot-tall and 220-mile
long fence along the Green Line, the truce
border from the end of the 1948 War of In
dependence.
Palestine Awareness Month Coordina
tor Tala al-Ramahi, a junior, opened the
event with a poem. It was followed by a
presentation from Naura Erakat of the
U.S. Campaign to End the Occupation. Er
akat,of Palestinian descent,painted a vivid
picture of the current Palestinian state as
an issue of indigenous and human rights,
which she compared to the struggles of
South Africans under Nelson Mandela,
African Americans in the Black Panther

party and Native Americans.
TTiat hundreds of thousands of Pales
tinians fled was not "collateral damage,"
she said hut rather Israelis "program of ex
pulsion of indigenous people."
Mandela was once called a terrorist, Er
akat said, though he is now revered as a
freedom fighter.
"Give me a few more years and no one
will be able to say that Palestinians are not
freedom fighters," she said.
Erakat derided House of Representa
tives Resolution 4681 — a proposal to re
strict United States humanitarian aid to
the Palestinian Authority. The resolution
would designate the Palestinian territory
as a "terrorist sanctuary" in response to the
recent Palestinian election where the

themselves up.

Hamas party won a decisive and unex
pected victory, she said.
A number of the speakers, including
Erakat, argued against H.R. 4681, saying
it was the result of the powerful Jewish
lobby and groups such as the American-
Israeli Political Action Committee
(APAC).
"It's APAC's baby," she said.
To chants of "no justice, no peace,"
Palestinian rappers Iron Sheik and Ex
centrik performed songs — one dedicat
ed to Condoleezza Rice entitled "Neo
con love song" — criticizing the Bush ad
ministration on the issue of democracy
promotion.
In Sheik's view, the administration's
actions have been hypocritical — initially
claiming to support democracy in the
Middle East and among Palestinians, and
then turning around and condemning the
Palestinians when they chose "the wrong
candidate." he said.
English Prof. Hilton Obenzinger, who
introduced himself as someone whose
family was murdered by the Nazis, ex
pressed solidarity with the Palestinian
people and argued strongly for the Pales
tinian refugees' right of return.
Originally estimated around 400 thou
sand in 1948, the number of Palestinians
who consider themselves refugees has
grown to 4.6 million over the past 50 years.
Obenzinger illustrated his point about
Israeli settlements being segregationist
by encouraging listeners to "imagine an
all-white community created in I larlem."
