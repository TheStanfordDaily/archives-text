## RADICAL ISLAM CRITICIZED Controversial writer Hitchens talks terror 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
The West needs to take the threat
of fundamentalist, militant Islam
more seriously, controversial British
commentator Christopher Hitchens
told a predominately older audience
at the Geology Corner auditorium
last night. In an hour-and-a-half pro
gram, the liberal-socialist contrarian
with a wry British wit and a sharp
English tongue offered up barbs
against Osama bin Laden, Muslims,
liberals and Jacques Chirac. In an at
times rambling, back-and-forth ex
change with audience members,
Hitchens also denounced organized
religion.
"You don't have to be paranoid,
racist or a bigot to take alarm," he
said. "There is a civil war within Islam.
We are not in a war on terror. We can
not be at war with an expression."
Hitchens, an editor for Vanity Fair,
described himself as an atheist and is
sued a sharp rebuke of the Muslim
prophet Muhammad.
"Of course, he's not a prophet," he
said. "He's an epileptic plagiarist."
He said the Quran — Islam's holi
est book — was full of "evil fairly
tales" that were "unimaginably recy
cled."
"It's a boring plagiarism of the
worst parts of Christianity and Ju
daism," he added.

Hitchens said he has personally
expressed concern to British Prime
Minister Tony Blair about Europe's
accommodation of radical Islam. He
said that some Muslim leaders have
said their growing population means
they will eventually take control of
Europe.
He said that the continent was
more cognizant of the threat posed by
fundamentalism in the past. But since
the 19605, he said, the United States
has become the more mindful of the
two.
"It was more widely, institutionally
believed in Europe first that an ac
commodation with Islam was desir
able because it forms a contiguous so
cial and political block within Eu
rope." Hitchens said."lt's now the Eu
ropeans who want to forget the long
struggle against Islam, and the United
States is relearning it."
Hitchens criticized leftists who
claim that the Bush administration is
beholden to Middle Eastern oil-rich
countries such as Saudi Arabia. He
said that Bush went against the wish
es of the Saudi royal family with the
invasions of both Afghanistan and
Iraq.
"If you can just pronounce the
words blood and oil, people will ap
plaud," he said.
Hitchens, who was and remains an
ardent supporter of the war in Iraq,
defended the Bush administration's
decision, adding that Saddam Hus
sein had been making the country less
secular and reaching out to religious
extremists. He said the criticisms of
the "riff-raff calling itself the anti-war

movement" are misplaced and reiter
ated that the American homeland re
mains at grave risk to terrorists.
Hitchens told the audience about
recent meetings with European schol
ars concerned about the increasing
pervasiveness of Islam on the conti
nent. He said he has met with the edi
tors of the Dutch newspapers who de
cided to print cartoons of the Muslim
prophet Muhammad. In the Islamic
faith, visually depicting the prophet is
considered blasphemy. Some who
subscribe to Sharia — Islamic law —
believe it should be punished by
death.
After the Dutch government de
clined to crack down on the freedom
of the press, radical Muslim clerics
sent their followers rioting in several
Middle Eastern countries and
through Europe. The conflagration
event sent some shockwaves through
the United States. Hitchens said that
news editors were intimidated by
threats from Muslims, even though
they said they were not.
The speaker tried to assuage fears
of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons.
While in no way apologetic for the
regime, he noted that the Iranian
president has no power compared to
the religious theocratic leadership.
"The situation has been let to rot
until there are almost no good choic
es," he said. "They have no interest in
using their weapons for a preemptive
strike because it would literally be the
last thing they did."
Through most of his speech, the
zaftig Hitchens gripped onto his
sports coat as a child would a blan

ket. He gulped down two full bottles
of water. At the beginning of the
event, he warned that it could not go
too late because he did not want to
miss cocktail hour. As he became
restless toward the end of a long
question-and-answer session, he
pulled out and began chomping on a
cigarette.
He invited the audience to join
him at the corner of the Quad for a
smoke. More than a dozen people fol
lowed him outside and spent more
than 15 minutes criticizing, verbally
prodding and questioning him.
"I can simmer down and have a
smoke outside," he told the audience
before exiting. "And anyone can say
what they'd like."
