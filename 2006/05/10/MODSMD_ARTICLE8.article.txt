## ASSU deliberates budget changes Senate clashes over funding requests from student groups 
### CASSIE HARVEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate convened last night to discuss
the transition from this year's sena
tors to next year's incoming mem
bers, approve special-fee umbrella
groups and elect a new deputy
chair. Budget modifications were
also discussed at length.
The meeting began with reports
from various ASSU Senate repre
sentatives. Vice President Lauren
Graham, a junior, announced
progress on a rotating art display
project, which she hopes will show
case the work of Stanford artists on
a rotating display in dining halls.
Graham said she had received pos
itive feedback on the project from
Rafi Taherian, the executive direc
tor of Stanford Dining.
The Senate then voted on re
placements for a new deputy chair
and financial manager for the 2006-
2007 school year. Freshman
Nkemjika Ugonabo was elected
deputy chair following a unani
mous decision. She was the only
candidate in the race. Matt McDon
ald received a 12-0-1 vote for the fi
nancial manager nomination, but
awaits a separate vote from the
Graduate Student Council (GSC)
before he can take office.
Finally, budget modification
procedures were held up after
sophomore Valerie Ross, the finan
cial officer for Stanford Anthology
for Youth (SAY) requested an ad
ditional $ 1,800 in funding. SAY had
been slated to receive $3,000 in
funding, but Ross said it was not
enough to cover the cost of the
group's upcoming convention.
Her request for additional fund

ing triggered a lengthy debate over
the appropriate "soft-cap" amount.
Appropriations Chair Faris Mohi
uddin, a junior, said he did not feel
comfortable allocating more than
$3,000, which had already been
flexed 50 percent to accommodate
community service groups.
"This isn't any normative state
ment against what SAY does," he
said. "I'm sure SAY provides a
valuable service. But the real con
cern is that we'd be abandoning our
policy and we need to consider
what precedent that would set."
But some, like Administration
and Rules Chair Kai Lukoff, a
sophomore, argued the policy was
unfair.
"If we recognize the policy is un
fair, we shouldn't just continue the
policy on a basis of consistency," he
said.
After a 15-minute recess, the
Appropriations Committee decid
ed to give SAY the already agreed
upon $3,000 in funding and said
that they would consider providing
the group the additional funding
Ross requested at next week's
meeting.
The Senate also approved fund
ing for the Stanford Undergradu
ate Psychology Association
(SUPA), Music 4 All and Jewish
Queers. The approvals brought the
total amount of funding for fiscal
year 2005-2006 to $224,157.78, or
83 percent of its roughly $270,(XX)
budget.
As for the other budget modifi
cation bills, the ASSU approved
additional requests for the
Caribbean Student Association,
Stanford Badminton, Jewish
Queers, Stanford Band, Stanford
Students Environmental Consult
ing and the Student Organizing
Committee for the Arts (SOCA).
The SOCA request for budget
modification will be taken up by
the GSC for final approval.
A bill to approve special fee um
brella groups was also passed.
