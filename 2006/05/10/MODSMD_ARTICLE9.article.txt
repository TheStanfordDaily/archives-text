## A 						WHOLE NEW WORLD: WILL WRIGHT'S SPORE RELIES ON TRADITION TO INVENT NEW GENRE OF COMPUTER GAMING 
### SAM BHAGWAT DESK EDITOR 
The online gaming world is dominated by "mas
sive multiplayer online role-playing games"
(MMORPG)'s — worlds where vast numbers
of players' characters interact, fighting each
other and computerized monsters, going on
quests and practicing crafts like smithing and
wizardry. For those who desire the broad, interactive ex
perience MMORPG's provide, yet tire of fighting mon
sters and prefer their own space, an alternative may be
forthcoming.
As a designer of games like Sim City and The Sims, Will
Wright knows a lot about providing a personal gaming
playground and giving players room to create and design.
His latest creation is a game called Spore, currently in de
velopment. With Spore, Wright seeks to provide players
with both personal space and a grand scope through pro
cedural generation and a new genre of games, which he
calls "massively single player online gaming."
Procedural generation refers to a process where con
tent is generated by algorithms, rather than through im
ported graphical and audio files. Proce-

r — d***i —
dural generation was popular in the
early, menvory-scare days of gaming,
when games had to be packed onto flop
py disks. Today, with CDs and vastly en
larged hard drives and computer pro
cessing power, procedural generation is
much more rare; popular computer
games like Civilization and Age of Em-

pires are non-procedurally generated and often require
hundreds of megabytes of memory for extensive graphics
and data files.
. . Wright sees a problem with this model.
a March presentation to the annual Game
|| Developers Conference, he explained: "We're
■(seeing a trend towards more open-ended
■Igames [because] players hate boundaries, es-
Blpecially unnatural boundaries. [ ITiey hate]
U P a B a * nst invisible walls."
H But at the same time, he said,"lt seems like
the next generation of titles will be incredibly expensive,
we're going to have to build mountains of content, and it's
going to drive most of the smaller players out of the mar
ket. I'm going to offer an alternative vision to that."
His plan to fulfill this ambitious goal revolves around
gamers' enthusiasm.
"Players love making content," Wright pointed out.
"Every time we've given them an opportunity to make
content, they've gone crazy with it. [And] players like
ownership over content — player's [created] stories are
more meaningful than scripted stories."
Wright illustrated the point with a personal anecdote.
He described to the around-twelve-thousand person au
dience his Grand Theft Auto character Moe, who spends
his time biking around with "cute underwear and a Barbie
watch," and how he takes pride in and often tells his wife

about Moe's unique exploits.
Players will have an opportunity to create similarly
bizarre content in Spore. Spore is comprised of seven lev
els; from the beginning to the end of the game the player
turns "from a bacteria to a galactic god."The player starts
as a lowly microbe in a Pac-Man type game, moves
through a creature stage, similar to Diablo, through city
and civilization stages similar to Risk, Sim City and Civi
lization, to a final galactic "sandbox" level where he or she
can play with worlds at any stage of the game, creating
alien hybrids or making first contact and interacting with
alien civilizations.This sandbox level, according to Wright,
puts the "player not in the role of Luke Skywalker or
Frodo Baggins, but George Lucas or J. R R.Tolkien."
What is so revolutionary about Wrights concept is that
at every stage, players can create or import content. In
contrast, games like Civilization and Age of Empires have
fixed scenarios, non-scenario play, and play editors, but
lack a real capacity to utilize shared content. If playing
against a fixed computer player bores you, you have to
find other players, either online or in person.
Spore, on the other hand, is based on a massive amount
of content-sharing but retains the single-player aspect.
Procedural generation drives the process, making

BBSSpossible miniscule object files (around one kilo-
Mbyte) that are easily transmitted between players
■ ■lor from a central database. At lower levels,shared
■content is restricted to characters; you can load
■IH| characters other players created, and creatures
B created, but not controlled, by other players pop
■■ulate the environment. At higher levels, this
■■IHBi 1 A. i....A. 1 - 1!1. I! 1 J!

shared content extends to objects like buildings,
vehicles and spaceships — the game, when operational,
will even import whole civilizations created by fellow
players.
"One of the things we want to do is to make it a toy,"
says Wright. "We want to burn tools into the gameplay, to
make the portability transparent."
Content creation via procedural generation has some
interesting side effects in Spore. There is procedural ritu
al dancing, based on how whether the player's civilization
resembles Leonard McCoy or Spock. There are procedu
rally determined eating habits — the particular structure
of a creature determines its predators and prey. There is
even procedural mating.
Whether this will attract a base of enthusiastic gamers
is unclear. It is not scheduled for release until April 2007

at the earliest. But it has al
ready garnered kudos from j
the game development com-i
munity: at the 2(X)5 Electronic®.
Entertainment Expo (E3), it|'
won multiple awards: Best of
Show, Best Original Game,
Best PC Game and Best Sim-|j
ulation Game. Wright is re-

vealing more at this year's E3. held this week in Los An
geles. Hopefully, gamers will soon he able to see whether
Spore's revolutionary promises pan out.
