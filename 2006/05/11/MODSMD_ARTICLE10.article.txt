## Hennessy proposes cross-disciplinary art program Art History students find ups and downs with small major 
### LAURA CARWILE STAFF WRITER 
In his annual address to the Academic
Counsel last Thursday, President John Hen
nessy spoke about the role of the arts at Stan
ford, expressing hope for improvement soon.
But students and faculty have expressed

mixed opinions on the current state of the arts
at Stanford, as well as prospects for progress.
Hennessy's speech, titled "A Cultured and
Useful Citizenry: The Role of Creativity and
the Arts in a 21st Century Education" fo
cused on the role that arts should play in the
Stanford community.
"I believe the arts offer an expanded tool
set for learning and understanding," Hen
nessy said, "which can enhance creative
thinking skills.
"But this will also require facilitating more
cross-disciplinary collaboration between the

arts and other fields," he added.
Hennessy said he believes that although
the arts and humanities have been an essen
tial part of the University since its opening,
there is a lot of work to be done to create the
kind of program that a university like Stan
ford should offer. Specifically, he recognized
the need for a multidisciplinary approach to
the art program.
Last spring, Hennessy announced the start
of an arts initiative that would "serve as a cat
alyst for multidisciplinary collaborations cen
tered on the arts."

In order to continue with this goal, the
Stanford Institute for Creativity and the Arts
(SICA) was formed, serving as "the initia
tive's hub." SICA has spearheaded programs
that will enhance the art programs at Stan
ford, as well as bring a multidisciplinary ap
proach to the arts.
One such program, "Creative Risks,"
brings modern artists to collaborate with stu
dents from different academic backgrounds,
and also assisting in bringing global artists to
Stanford.
But not all art professors agree that
a multidisciplinary approach to the
arts is the best way to proceed in the
future.
"It might be true that working in
three-dimensions, as a sculptor, for ex
ample, can help an engineer or a doc
tor better visualize her specialized ac
tivity," said Art History Prof. Michael
Marrinan. "It might be true that paint
ing can heighten one's powers of ab
stract thinking. It might be true that
throwing pots can increase one's sen
sitivity to materials. But none of this is
direct and depends entirely upon the
individual."
Marrinan said he believes that the
most important part of the arts is to
help students express their creativity
to the best of their abilities.
"To my mind," he said,"making the
arts an important part of a Stanford
education is much more about helping
students find the courage and the
means to express thoughts using a vo
cabulary and materials rather unlike
words, equations, or computer graph
ics."
So far, students have expressed di
vergent reviews of the art program
currently in place.
"I think it has a lot of great profes

sors who have great experience in the
classes they teach," said junior Caro
line Young, a product design major
who has taken several art courses for
her major. Another great thing about
the Art Department, Young said, is
that there is "lots of individualized at
tention because it is such a small de
partment."
Catalina Vejo, an art history major
with an emphasis in Chinese art, ex
pressed concern about the size of the
department.
"One of the main problems with
the art department is that there are
very few classes each quarter," Vejo
said. "Also the faculty is small, so if you
are interested in a specific period or
school, you might not find a faculty
member with that specialty."
Marrinan agreed that the size of
the program was one of its major
weaknesses.
"Historically, our department has
not been large and certainly not very
well funded," he said. "So there is a lot
of frustration amongst my colleagues
who want very much to play a larger
role at Stanford, but are unable to in
crease that role for lack of essential re
sources."
However, Vejo said the size could
work to the department's advantage.
"The departments small size has
its benefits," she said. "They care a lot
about their students, and you get to
know everyone in the department â€”
the majors, minors, faculty, adminis
tration, etc."

The Cantor Visual Arts Center is a
well-known campus landmark, al
though many students wonder
whether it is used to its full potential.
Its limited collection and under
whelming ability to bring major works
to campus may dissuade students
from taking advantage of its re

sources.
"The museum plays a limited role
in teaching what 1 know best: art histo
ry," Marrinan said.
Thankfully, for those in the Art and
Art History Departments at Stanford,
Hennessy and others are working to
change Stanford arts for the better. In

the future, the University plans to cre
ate new faculty billets and add student
fellowships.
This will be necessary. Hennessy
said, because the quality and depth of
the art programs available "are not up
to the level of a great university like
Stanford."

The Cantor Arts Center is a well-known campus landmark. Some professors in the Art History Department feel this cen
ter is not used to its full potential. President Hennessy is seeking to incorporate cross-disciplinary studies into the arts.
