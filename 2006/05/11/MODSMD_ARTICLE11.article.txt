## Kennedy tells tale of the West 
### BEN EPPLER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Members of the Stanford Historical Society
(SHS) gathered in the Bishop Auditorium of the
Graduate School of Business yesterday afternoon
for the organization's annual meeting. The event
featured a speech by History Prof, and Pulitzer
Prize winner David M. Kennedy about Stanford
and the development of the North American West.
Kennedy's speech wove together Robert Louis
Stevenson's description of his train journey to Cal
ifornia with an outline of several defining events in
the region's history. He coupled Stevenson's prose
with his own eloquent oratory to paint a tapestry
of the West's evolution from frontier wilderness to
a bustling center of commerce, industry and tech
nology — with Stanford playing a major role
throughout.
Central to the development of the land west of
the Mississippi was the railroad, Kennedy noted.
The rapid transit made possible by the locomotive,
he said,"for the people of the 19th century,
ied progress."
He emphasized the effort that went into the
construction of the transcontinental railroad, re
calling both the white-collar investors who fi
nanced the effort and the inhabitants of the
ephemeral work-towns that sprang up and died out
as work continued along its route.
Quoting Stevenson to highlight the epic nature
of the project, Kennedy asked, "What was Troy
town to this?"

Drawing connections to Stanford, the professor
pointed out that it was the Central Pacific Railroad
that made Leland Stanford Sr. the fortune that he
would later use to found the University.
Kennedy focused on the unique characteristics
of the West that make it an interesting subject of
study He spoke of the region's diversity and said
that Stanford was among the first universities to
admit Native Americans.
The political character of the West was another
issue Kennedy deemed worthy of study. He cited
the West's proportionally large population — one
in three Americans lives in the west — and Califor
nia's 53 seats in the House of Representatives as
examples of the region's political heft. He said that
the former frontier has been a focal point for envi
ronmental policy economic development and con
troversial direct democracy issues such as recalls
and referendums.
Stanford, Kennedy stated, has been at the center
of the region's growth. If Leland Stanford were
alive today, he said, "He might note with pride that
his university was the creature, as well as the cre
ator, of the region."
Kennedy noted several of Stanford's recent ini
tiatives to study its surrounding area, mentioning
last year's founding of the Bill Lane Center for the
Study of the North American West, for which he
serves as the director. He also cited University
hosted conferences about forestry, fisheries, direct
democracy and Mexican immigration.

History Prof, and Pulitzer Prize winner Daivd M. Kennedy discussed Stanford's role in the shaping of Amer
ican western history. Kennedy is also the author of popular high school textbook, "The American Pageant."
Before Kennedy's speech, four
new SHS board members were
elected unanimously by voice vote, a
prize for volunteer service was
awarded to board member Marian
Adams and Society President Susan
Schofield delivered a statement on
the organization's status and activi
ties.
Schofield thanked SHS volun
teers and donors. She reported that
the society debuted three books on
Stanford history and hosted six pop
ular on-campus programs last year.
According to board member
Dave Mitchell, the SHS board pub
lishes a journal on Stanford history,
gives tours of and works to preserve
historic houses and recruits mem
bers.
"It's been a lot of fun to be in
volved in it,"he said. Asked why the
area interests him, Mitchell said he
is an alumnus and longtime Palo
Alto resident.
"The whole existence of Silicon
Valley basically started here. It's the
technology center of the world," he
added.
Gary Trimble, the spouse of a law
student and SHS member, said he
was disappointed that more under
graduates have not taken part in the
historical society.
"More young people should be
taking advantage of the fact that this
resource exists," he said.
"We generally have an older
membership, generally alumni, re
tired faculty and staff," Schofield ac
knowledged. She pointed to recent
student outreach programs, such as
a student essay contest and current
student board member Bernard
Fraga, a sophomore.
"We're not going to get 5,000 stu
dent members," conceded Bob
Hamrdla, a board member and for
mer president of the SHS. "But if we
get some students whose interest in
Stanford history will be carried be
yond their time here, we've accom
plished our goal."
