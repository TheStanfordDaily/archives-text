## Two students raise issues with GSC 
### ADA YEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last night, the Graduate Student Council (GSC) heard the
concerns from two cultural and social anthropology (CASA)
students about changes in graduate life. Issues discussed includ
ed transportation, health care for dependents, terminal graduate
registration fees and cuts to humanities and sciences program
funds made earlier this year.
Robert Samet, a second-year CASA graduate student, and
Austin Ziederman, a first-year student, said that their depart
mental graduate student organization has been dissatisfied
with financial resources and overall quality of life for graduate
students. Listed among their concerns were transportation
costs for students who live off-campus and the elimination of
the Dependent Health Insurance Plan announced by Vaden
Health Center in April.
"Speaking from the perspective of a person with a family, I'm
very concerned about it," Ziederman said, adding that he was
particularly worried about options for dependents in the "hard
to-insure" category.
"Other universities have at least the same plan for depend
ents as they have for students and faculty," he added.
"I've been told that the problem is that healthy people keep
opting out,called the 'health care plan death spiral,'" Ziederman
said. "This indicates that there wasn't a good plan to begin with,
or else people would not have been opting out."
Samet and Ziederman also expressed dissatisfaction with ter-
minal graduate registration (TGR)
fees — a "reduced tuition" that
graduate students pay if they have
fulfilled course requirements but
are still conducting departmental
research. Currently,TGß fees stand
at $2,760 per quarter, amounting to
at least $7,500 a year for most grad
uate students.
"At most universities this is nom
inal, around $1,000," Samet said.
"$7,500 per student per year is as
tronomical and absurd, especially
for someone not even taking class
es."
Samet noted that high TGR fees
are especially hard on anthropology
students, who are expected to com
plete one to two years of fieldwork
after their third year of graduate
schooling. According to Samet, a
CASA student might need to stay
for six or seven years before gradu
ating, after which he or she might
not immediately find a job. If a fel
lowship covers only five years, one
to two years of TGR fees must be
paid out of pocket.
Samet and Ziederman also took
issue with funds for the humanities

and sciences program, which were
halved this year. The money, given
to each department to serve their
graduate students, can be used at
their discretion for speaker events
and conferences.
Samet recognized that these are
commonplace issues at GSC meet
ings, but stressed their importance
nonetheless.
"I've been made to understand
that these are cyclical issues, but
graduate life is precarious." he said.
"Something like transportation can
amount to $2,000 a year in costs for
students living in San Francisco.The
health care cuts are just shameful.
Worrying about these issues —
food, rent, clothing and funds-takes
away from our studies.
"Program cuts hurt our ability to
recruit good anthropologists to our
department," he added.
GSC members said that these on
going issues pose problems for grad
uate students in the humanities, who
approach the council with fresh
complaints from time to time.
"Humanities students may re
quire longer to obtain their de
grees," said Adam Beberg, the GSC
funding committee chair and a grad
uate student in computer science.
"They may have more financial con
cerns than students of professional
school."
