### MITALI THAKOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Institute for Research on
Women and Gender was recently renamed
the Michelle R. Clayman Institute for Gender
Research to acknowledge the $3 million dona
tion from alumna Michelle Clayman.
"We are delighted to recognize Michelle's
leadership through the new name," remarked
Sharon Long, the Vernon R. and Lysbeth
Warren Anderson Dean of Humanities and
Sciences. "She has provided strong leader
ship and tireless enthusiasm as she helped
the Stanford faculty move forward in the
larger goals of the Institute to advance our
understanding of gender as it relates to key
social issues."
Clayman, who earned her master's in busi
ness administration in 1979 from the Gradu
ate School of Business, is also chair of the Na
tional Advisory Panel to the Institute for Re
search on Women and Gender.
Michelle Cale, the associate director of the
Institute, said that Clayman "has a strong in
terest in the equality of women and a belief in
their ability to prospect. She was looking for a
place in the University that shared these be
liefs."
dayman's $3 million gift was matched by
the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation's
donation to the School of Humanities and Sci
ences, as well as nine other anonymous
donors, to reach the Institute's $10 million en
dowment goal.
According to Long, the recent influx of do
nations "will ensure the long-term viability of
this program by providing an ongoing and sta
ble base of financial support for the institute's
core needs," which include gender-based re
search, a graduate dissertation program and
research fellowships. The Institute is an inde
pendent, research-focused University organi
zation that does not include undergraduate or
PhD programs.
The Institute was founded in 1974 as the
Center for Research on Women. In 1996, it
was renamed the Institute for Research on
Women and Gender to reflect the inclusion of
issues of masculinity.
The Institute's focus also corresponds to
the background and goals of its acting direc
tor. The current director. History of Science
Prof. Londa Schiebinger, focuses the current
research interests of the Institute on the role
of women in science, technology and engi
neering, in addition to relationships between
men and women in the workplace.
Cale commented that the most recent
change in the name of the Institute indicates
that "many of the issues we deal with now are
both women's and men's issues," citing the ex
ample of a current hot topic — division of
labor in the household.
"The institute has produced groundbreak
ing work over the last 30 years, enhancing the
lives of women all over the globe," Clayman
stated in a press release. "I hope that this gift
will strengthen the institute and allow it to
continue its tradition of excellence in re
search."
