## Grove gets no veggie love 
### 
After a month of mono misery (and fevered
thesis writing), Louk returns triumphant
to join Liebner on another Destination
Dining expedition and to rescue her from the ter
ror of the Toyonic Plague. This gastrointestinal
dysfunction is devastating dining halls across cam
pus, and while there has been no word of an actu
al infection in Wilbur, the place is positively pesti
lent with plastic and paperware: flimsy cardboard
bowls that grow soggy before the Cinnamon Toast
Crunch, individually wrapped forks that snap
while spearing celery, knives that flex while tear
ing through tofu and daily mountains of unrecy
clable plastic plates that make every self-respect
ing vegetarian treehugger pinko commie liberal
shrivel up and die a little on the inside.
You just want a spoon for your froyo? Sorry,
kiddo, we don't just give spoons away; you gotta
take a fork, a knife, a single-ply napkin rough
enough to sand an ME 203 project, and some
packets of salt and pepper, too. And while you're
at it, go ahead and slather yourself in this "hand
sanitizer" we provide for "your convenience,"
since we can't trust you dirty dorm dwellers to
wash regularly (not that the veggie set has any
right to complain about that).
Aaah, but on to the food. The fateful day Louk
and Liebner rejoined forces to seek out The Truth
of vegetarian campus eats, the "Destinations" of
Stanford Dining, Inc. joined their forces and con
verged on White Plaza (since the traditional locale,
Wilbur Field, has been devoured by the Pit of
Doom that will one day house Munger-branded
law students' Benzes, BMWs and Bentleys) for the
annual Spring Faire. Passing up the opportunity to
review all delicious destinations at once and there
by maximize the opportunity to pick up Roblebo
la from any or all of the dining destinations at once,
Louk and Liebner broke on through to the other
side of White Plaza to the glory of the Row.
Louk had the hook up at the Grove Houses
and with just a little help from some friends,
scored a pair of guest meals. Liebner looked for
ward to an evening of sophisticated intellectual
discussion among upperclassmen and appreciated
the quaint architecture of a real house as com
pared to her own concrete cut-out in Wilbur.
The evening started promisingly enough, as the
menu announced "lasagna" as the plat du jour,
and everyone knows it's nearly impossible to
make an unappetizing vegetarian pasta platter. In
deed, the veggie version of the lasagna was appro
priately cloaked in cheese (cheddar, not mozzarel
la, interestingly enough) and filled with delights
such as potatoes, carrots, mushrooms, bell peppers
and squash. This was no ordinary veggie lasagna
that merely replaced meat with limp spinach or —
Liebner shudders at the thought — soggy egg
plant, and it scored major points with these re
viewers. Louk noted a small side dish of lasagna
that stood naked of cheese and wondered aloud if
it was the vegan offering. His heart leapt at the
thought that the toques at Grove would take such
considerations, but a native dashed his hopes and
told him it was the lactose-intolerant tolerant
lasagna, stuffed with a plentiful bounty of
butchered bovines (still sound good, carnivores?).
Unfortunately, the good news ended there.
Carbs dominated the scene, with pasta, mashed
potatoes, baguette slices and minute rice (which
Liebner thought was tasty, but Louk suspected
had been cooked in chicken broth, thus destroying
the sanctity of rice as a veggie-friendly food),
while nutrient-leached steamed broccoli repped
that crucial wedge of the food pyramid. The mea
ger Denny's style salad bar offered eggs and beans
as consolation protein prizes but didn't do much
for Liebner's appetite.
Aspirations for intellectual upperclassman
conversation were as hopeless as getting all 18
amino acids — conversation quickly turned to
how few times a week a couple has to hook up to
constitute moving into "that phase" of a relation
ship. But hey, at least by senior year we're talking
about relationships in addition to hookups!
Worst of all, the mosquitoes also apparently
scored guest passes, as they constituted the majority
of the table's diners. As Liebner was busy being
eaten alive, Louk celebrated being bite free by
doing the Rocky victory dance, thusly proving that
he's the bigger vegetarian. After all, everyone
knows that old wives' tale about mosquitoes liking
blood with meat in it is absolutely, scientifically true.
Filled with pasta, rice and broc, and feeling
guilty there wasn't a marathon the next day, Louk
and Liebner abandoned hopes of a well-balanced
meal and savaged thick, sweet, and just-gooey
enough rice krispie treats offered for dessert like
starving cannibals airdropped into a freshman
IHUM class.
Say what you will about the a healthy balanced
diet — as of this writing, Louk and Liebner are
still fit as fiddles and free of Toyonorhea. And if
rice krispie treats are the prescription to stay
healthy, Louk, at least, is OK with that.
Destination Dining standings:
In the dorm dining hall division:
1. Lagunita: 5 tofu, 0 cereal
2. F10M0:3.5 tofu, 1.5 cereal
3. Ricken 1 tofu, 5 cereal

about relationships in addition to hookups!
Worst of all, the mosquitoes also apparently
scored guest passes, as they constituted the majority
of the table's diners. As Liebner was busy being
eaten alive, Louk celebrated being bite free by
doing the Rocky victory dance, thusly proving that
he's the bigger vegetarian. After all, everyone
knows that old wives' tale about mosquitoes liking
blood with meat in it is absolutely, scientifically true.
Filled with pasta, rice and broc, and feeling
guilty there wasn't a marathon the next day, Louk
and Liebner abandoned hopes of a well-balanced
meal and savaged thick, sweet, and just-gooey
enough rice krispie treats offered for dessert like
starving cannibals airdropped into a freshman
IHUM class.
Say what you will about the a healthy balanced
diet — as of this writing, Louk and Liebner are
still fit as fiddles and free of Toyonorhea. And if
rice krispie treats are the prescription to stay
healthy, Louk, at least, is OK with that.
