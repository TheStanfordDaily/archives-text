# This is Your Brain, STANFORD RESEARCH CONFERENCE INVESTIGATES THE LINK BETWEEN MUSIC & MOOD

the allure of salsa at a dance club to the digni
aJLty of the wedding march, we count on music to pro-
the soundtrack for our lives. But what if the
music were more than just a reflection of our moods —
what if the soundtrack changed the course of the movie
itself?
A group of interdisciplinary presenters wants to ex
amine just that in an upcoming conference hosted by
Stanford's Center for Computer Research in Music and
Acoustics. The conference, titled "Brainwave Entrap
ment to External Rhythmic Stimuli" unites presenters
under the common interest of how music affects the
brain — and, more specifically, how music can alter our
brainwaves, and by extension, alertness, mood and even
certain disorders.
"It seems that if you focus your attention intensely
enough on any rhythmic stimulus in your environment,
your brainwaves will begin to synchronize to that rhythm
and become more and more synchronized the longer
that you pay attention to it," explains Symposium Coor
dinator and visiting scholar Gabe Tlirow.
TUrow continues, "Given that your EEG rhythms —
the electromagnetic pules coming from the cortex — are
tied closely to your state of arousal and attention, brain
wave entrainment seems to represent a way of systemat
ically altering your brainwave state for short periods of
time, eliciting a different state of arousal or attention in
the process," he continues.
Though this phenomenon is observable in everyday
life — TUrow gives examples such as the rhythmic move
ment of cars lulling people to sleep and the calming influ
ence of playing an instrument — it also has possible med
ical applications. Disorders such as insomnia, ADD, de-

pression and
anxiety have
linked to specific brain

wave patterns, suggesting
that treatment for these disorders could
come from music rather than drug therapy. People with
ADD, for example, could listen to fast electronic music in
order to speed up the slower-than-average brainwaves in
the frontal cortex.
The use of music for therapy is one of the major top
ics of discussion at Saturday's conference, which will fea
ture 30-minute presentations from fields as diverse as
psychology, computer science and philosophy.
Judith Becker, a professor of musicology at the Uni
versity of Michigan, will give a presentation that exam
ines how music is used for healing in rituals in Sri Lanka
and Indonesia.
She writes in the online description of her project, "I
will present some video footage of two rituals that involve
intense, repetitive music in rituals of healing and trance.
The first example is of a Buddhist healing ritual from Sri
Lanka in which the drummers successfully attempt to in
duce trance in the sick person.The second example is a rit
ual from Bali, Indonesia, that involves neutralizing the
negative power of a magnificent witch...An essential part
of the ceremony is the trance induction of a group of vil
lage volunteers...who after initially attacking the witch,
turn their daggers upon themselves, but are seldom
harmed."
Another presentation by Thomas Budzynski, Affili
ate professor of psychology at the University of Wash
ington, will examine how light and music together can af
fect brainwave patterns and even improve cognitive per-

rormance in senior citizens.
The conference is not just

limited to clinical or scientific re
m search; it will also feature a performance by
Italian music group, Musicantica. The ensemble, which
performs a style of trance music called tarantella, features
two ethnomusicologists who will follow the performance
with a discussion of how tarantella relates to the topics
discussed at the conference.
This academic breadth is one of the highlights of the
conference, says organizer and Department of Music
Chair Jonathan Berger. "This conference brings togeth
er neuroscientists, psychiatrists, psychologists, computer
scientists and ethnomusicologists all working on pieces
of this large puzzle. It is the first of its kind and an excit
ing moment for Stanford and for the research communi
ty at large," he explains.
TUrow agrees about the wealth of information avail
able at the conference and adds that it should have far
reaching appeal.
"I think there's something for just about everyone in
this conference. Everyone has emotional experiences
that seem out of their control-this conference suggests a
non-invasive means to find a way to deal with them "says
TUrow. "And for those who play or listen to music, this
should start to give them some clues as to why they are
affected in certain ways by certain pieces and maybe it'll
encourage them to pay more attention to those effects
and possibly even cultivate them."
