# Dark side of the sun: Is laying out upping your cancer risk?
## 
### FRANCESCA WODTKE 
After a winter that seemed to last forev
er, spring is finally here. Off come the
fleeces, the sweatpants, the raincoats. On go
the bikinis, the tank tops, the swim trunks
and T-shirts. Every last inch of skin that can
be decently exposed is put on display. And
the feeling is glorious.
On a lazy Sunday afternoon, the grassy
bank stretching along the length of the Avery
Aquatic Center is thick with Stanford stu
dents enjoying the first few days of sun and
hoping to catch the makings of a tan.
"There's this trend in America that the
browner you are, the hotter you are," says
Melissa Morales, a freshman relaxing by the
pool with her girlfriends. She giggles. "I
might as well capitalize on it."
A tan may bring on that summery glow,
but invisible UVB rays are also at work,
causing painful burns and peeling or blister
ing skin. This sun exposure is what puts the
body at risk for skin cancer.
Susan Swetter, a dermatology professor
and director of the Pigmented Lesion and
Cutaneous Melanoma Center at the Stan
ford University Medical Clinic, says,
"There's a clearly-established link between
long-term sun exposure pre-cancers and
skin cancer."
She explains that there are three main

types of skin cancer: melanoma, basal cell
carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.
Basal cell cancers are the most common
type of skin cancer. These non-melanoma
cancers arise from chronic sun exposure and
are not uncommon in younger individuals.
They're "absolutely curable," says Swet
ter, "but they can cause local disfiguration,
since they may bleed and ulcerate."
Other types of non-melanoma skin can
cer include squamous skin cancer, which is
also caused by chronic sun exposure but can
spread throughout the body, increasing the
patient's risk of serious illness.
Most risky are melanomas themselves, the
result of "intermittent blistering sun burns."
Melanoma is one of the most common types
of cancer for both men and women and usual
ly shows up on the back of both sexes or the
legs of women. If caught early, however,
melanomas have a good prognosis.
"The vast majority of melanomas are
thin and curable," Swetter explains. But left
alone, they can spread down into the skin,
then to the body's lymph nodes and the
lymphatic system, and thus become "poten
tially deadly."
The average age for skin cancer develop
ment is over 40, but younger individuals are
susceptible to pre-cancers. And, Swetter
notes, "Melanoma is certainly not unheard
of in individuals in their late 20s and 30s. In

fact, the rates appear to be on the rise in
children."
Fair-skinned individuals with an abun
dance of moles and a family history of skin
cancer are the most at risk, although fair
skin in itself is a risk factor for non
melanoma skin cancer.
Of course, skin cancer of all types can be
avoided by minimizing risky behavior. That
means covering up with long sleeves, hats
and pants, and slathering plenty of sun
screen on skin that remains exposed. Swet
ter recommends SPF 15 as a baseline, but
advises SPF 30 since most individuals don't
use nearly enough product.
"You need an entire palm-full for the
body and about a teaspoonful for the face to
provide adequate protection," she insists.
Meanwhile, over by the swimming pool,
Stanford students are getting tanner by the
minute. But not all of them are wearing sun
screen.
Kevin lori is a senior who's bypassed the
sunscreen. "I haven't gotten around to get
ting any," he says, "but I would wear it if I
had it." lori already knows a thing or two
about pre-cancers. He had a "iffy" mole re
moved a few years ago.
Francois Conti, a doctoral student in com
puter science says that he's wearing SPF 8.
"My fiancee gave me SPF 30," he admits,
"but I'm out of it."

As for sophomore Beth Thompson, she's
wearing SPF 15.
"I'm concerned about burning," she
says. "But I sit in the sun because it makes
me happy."
While it may not be possible to resist the
lure of the sun, individuals should be vigilant
about watching for suspicious lesions. Swet
ter advises keeping an eye on unusual-look
ing moles that are asymmetrical in shape,
dark in color (even red or blue) with irregu
lar borders, a diameter larger than 6 millime
ters or have changed shape over time.
For concerned individuals, the Stanford
Comprehensive Cancer Center is hosting a
morning of free skin cancer screenings. The
event will take place this Saturday, May 13
from 9 a.m. to noon. Physicians will be on
hand to take histories and examine patients
for irregularities and skin blemishes. The
entire exam takes less than five minutes and
is entirely non-invasive.
"We like to host this event in May since
it's the start of the sunny season," says Erika
Smith, marketing manager for skin cancer
screening.
"It's also an easy way to get checked
out," Smith says. "Even if you have to wait
in line for a few minutes, it's worth it to
know that you're fine."
After all, she says, "Catching skin cancer
in time can seriously save a life."
