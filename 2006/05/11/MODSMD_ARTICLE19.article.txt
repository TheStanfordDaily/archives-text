## Editorial Transparency needed in admissions process 
### 
Why are we here? We don't mean this
in a metaphorical sense. Rather,
why did the admissions office de
cide that we should be admitted to Stanford?
Perhaps we'll never really know.
A few of us might be able to point to an
amazing science fair project or a monumen
tal globe-spanning humanitarian effort in
high school. The rest of us, however, are
mostly left in the dark. Was it the summer in
ternship at an investment bank? Or the rec
ommendation letter written by a history
teacher who'd never seen a more enthusias
tic student in a generation and a half?
Because college admissions are holistic,
they are intended to focus on more than just
your GPA and SAT scores. However, as a
consequence, it's nearly impossible to know
exactly why we accepted to Stanford — or
any other university, for that matter.
On the flip side, this makes it equally
challenging for the people in admissions to
have a clear idea of who they are admitting
to Stanford. After all, it is just as difficult for
them to evaluate candidates based solely on
a few essays they write or other similarly
vague criteria that a holistic admissions
process demands.
Yet this does not mean that there is not
some standard by which the University cannot
set, with the broad goal of emphasizing certain
characteristics and de-emphasizing others. In
fact, the very nature of the admissions process
would make it more important for us to think
more clearly about the sort of applicants we
would like to attract to the Farm.
In the face of mounting pressure to im
prove our rankings, we should remember
that any changes we might make to the ad
missions process should not come at the cost
of student quality. Rather, Stanford should
continue implementing policies that have
given the University its unique character.
One path that we feel the University ad
missions should take is to ensure that Stan
ford continues to differentiate itself from

other universities of its caliber. At first, this
may seem like an idle pronouncement, with
no possible method by which it could be car
ried out or its results measured. And of
course, two of Stanford's primary means of
differentiation — good location and great
weather — are quite beyond the Universi
ty's control. Perhaps it is because of location
and weather that Stanford consistently
ranks near the top in student happiness.
And due to the opacity of the admissions
process, it is hard to measure the success of
the admissions process until several years
after a class is admitted.
But we should remember that admissions
is one of the most important processes that
determine the essence of the University,
even if its effects are not directly felt in our
day-to-day lives.
Why should Stanford try to continue to
differentiate itself? The reason is neither
mere worship of tradition, nor an ill-will to
wards similar-caliber Ivy League universi
ties. Rather, by differentiating ourselves, we
are making an effort to attract students who
would thrive at Stanford. Students who de
sire an environment like Stanford's will end
up in a place where they can be happy. Simi
larly, students who, for whatever incompre
hensible reason, know they wouldn't be
happy at Stanford will know that they should
enroll in a university more suited to them.
More importantly, however, the student
body should ask questions about the sort of
qualities we would like to see in incoming
freshmen classes of the future. As we create
a diverse student body, what forms of diver
sity do we value? Do we want the academic
environment at Stanford to be more scholar
ly or more laidback? Would we like students
to be more athletically inclined, political ac
tive or socially involved? Together, we have
a responsibility as a community to work col
lectively toward articulating our vision for
what future generations of Stanford stu
dents should look like.
