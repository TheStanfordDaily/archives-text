After more than five hours of
baseball the night before thanks to
Tuesday's 15-inning win over Santa
Clara, Stanford baseball traveled
north yesterday to play in 90-degree
weather. No cool rest for this team,
but maybe it's for the better.
Stanford (24-21,7-11 Pac-10) re
mained hot at Sacramento State, de
feating the Hornets 5-4 and extend
ing its win streak to three games.
With the second-to-last Pac-10 se
ries of the season coming up this
weekend, the Cardinal want to cap
ture every last bit of heat and mo
mentum for the trip to Washington.
But while 90 degrees may bother
some in California, it apparently
doesn't affect Texans all too much.
Katy, Tex. resident and sophomore
catcher Brian Juhl had the game
winning homer in the sixth, hitting a
two-out moonshot over the right
field fence to put the Cardinal ahead
in a game where the Hornets kept

swarming back.
"(Today's win] was definitely im
portant because our backs are
against the wall," Juhl said.
"Anything helps in getting mo
mentum. It's important to get that
win and it helps keep Nine off our
back," Juhl added with a laugh.
It was Juhl's first career homerun.
He went 2-4 with two RBI and also
had the hit which broke a 3-3 tie in
the third.
Stanford quickly put three runs
on the scoreboard in the first, but
Sacramento State (20-29,8-10 WAC)
did the same in its bottom half. Sacra
mento State had four consecutive
hits, a single and a triple, to even the
score at 3-all.
In the third, the Cardinal added to
their lead, but missed out on an op
portunity to do more damage. Senior
second baseman Chris Lewis was
walked by Mel Cuckovich, who re
placed lefty starter John Schlager
after two innings. A hit by sopho

Senior shortstop Chris Minaker had one hit — and was hit by one pitch — in last night's 5-4
win at Sacramento State. The team hopes it has built momentum from its three-game win streak.
