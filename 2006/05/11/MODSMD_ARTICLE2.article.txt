After more than five hours of
baseball the night before thanks to
Tuesday's 15-inning win over Santa
Clara, Stanford baseball traveled
north yesterday to play in 90-degree
weather. No cool rest for this team,
but maybe it's for the better.
Stanford (24-21,7-11 Pac-10) re
mained hot at Sacramento State, de
feating the Hornets 5-4 and extend
ing its win streak to three games.
With the second-to-last Pac-10 se
ries of the season coming up this
weekend, the Cardinal want to cap
ture every last bit of heat and mo
mentum for the trip to Washington.
But while 90 degrees may bother
some in California, it apparently
doesn't affect Texans all too much.
Katy, Tex. resident and sophomore
catcher Brian Juhl had the game
winning homer in the sixth, hitting a
two-out moonshot over the right
field fence to put the Cardinal ahead
in a game where the Hornets kept

swarming back.
"(Today's win] was definitely im
portant because our backs are
against the wall," Juhl said.
"Anything helps in getting mo
mentum. It's important to get that
win and it helps keep Nine off our
back," Juhl added with a laugh.
It was Juhl's first career homerun.
He went 2-4 with two RBI and also
had the hit which broke a 3-3 tie in
the third.
Stanford quickly put three runs
on the scoreboard in the first, but
Sacramento State (20-29,8-10 WAC)
did the same in its bottom half. Sacra
mento State had four consecutive
hits, a single and a triple, to even the
score at 3-all.
In the third, the Cardinal added to
their lead, but missed out on an op
portunity to do more damage. Senior
second baseman Chris Lewis was
walked by Mel Cuckovich, who re
placed lefty starter John Schlager
after two innings. A hit by sopho

Senior shortstop Chris Minaker had one hit — and was hit by one pitch — in last night's 5-4
win at Sacramento State. The team hopes it has built momentum from its three-game win streak.
more third baseman Randy Molina and
a hit batsman — freshman DH Brent
Milleville — later, Juhl stepped up.
He hit the ball to left field, and Lewis
came in from third to score. Molina fol
lowed behind and thought he scored the
second run of the inning before
Milleville was tagged out trying to go
from first to third. However, the umpires
thought otherwise and Molina's run did
not count.
"I was trying to score the whole
time; the whole time I was going hard,"
Molina said, adding that he turned to
give Lewis a high five at home plate. "It
halted the momentum.That call kind of
stopped [the rally]. We could have got
ten an insurance run that would have
helped out our pitching the next in
ning."
Again, the Hornets repeated what
the Cardinal had done in the top of the
inning by scoring themselves in the bot
tom of the third. Buddy Morales, com
ing in to the game with .296 batting av
erage, doubled off of relief pitcher
David Stringer — Stanford starting
pitcher Blake Holler was also pulled
out after two innings of work. A sacri
fice bunt moved him over a base and
David Flores, batting at .326, hit an RBI
double.
Sacramento State could have extend
ed the scoring, moving Flores to third
with a sacrifice fly, but instead left him
on base. Stanford, meanwhile, had many
opportunities in the ninth inning, but the
team was unable to extend its lead any
further.
The team looks to extend its streak in
a crucial Pac-10 series that starts tomor
row at 6 p.m. in Seattle. Stanford has
won five of its last six to pull itself out of
a rut that lasted much of the season. In
this winning stretch, Stanford pitching
has performed greatly. The pitching will
need to continue its top performance,
especially tonight.
Senior ace Greg Reynolds (5-3, 3.49

ERA) takes the mound for Stanford
against the Huskies (32-20,9-9 Pac-10).
Reynolds has tossed back-to-back com
plete game wins over Arizona State and
California, allowing only one and two
runs, respectively. Tim Lincecum, who is
going for his twelfth win of the season,
pitches for Washington State. The
righthander, recently named Pac-10
Pitcher of the Week, holds the confer
ence record for strikeouts (461).
"We expect a really good pitchers'
show," Juhl said. "We know [Lincecum]
walks a lot, so we hope to get some guys
on base."
Also slated to start for Washington
are Kyle Parker and Elliot Cribby. Wash
ington is currently fifth in the confer
ence.
"Winning this game, especially going
in to face a pitcher like Lincecum, gives
us more confidence, more confidence in
our hitters," Molina said. "It's important
that we got these last two wins, especial
ly going against Washington pitching."
Stanford's postseason chances are
once again on the line this weekend, as it
hopes to pull itself out of ninth-place in
the Pac-10.
