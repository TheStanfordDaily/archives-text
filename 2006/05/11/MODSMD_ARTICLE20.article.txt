If you don't watch Stephen Colbert, you
should. He is the blowhard host of Com
edy Central's The Colbert Report every
weeknight at 11 p.m. A long time "reporter"
on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, Col
bert presents his interpretation of the news,
often mocking the "liberal" media along the
way. Colbert, who reams the Bush adminis
tration by pretending to be its biggest sup
porter, has created an on-screen persona
that is (sarcastically) stubborn, ignorant and
hilarious.
So it came as a surprise when Colbert was
asked to give the keynote speech at the White
House Press Correspondents Dinner, where
his two victims — Bush and the media —
would be his captive audience. Needless to
say, Colbert didn't disappoint. Check out the
speech at http://www.ThankYouStephenCol
bert.org.
He wasted no time going after Bush in,
well, a rather roundabout way. Regarding
his dismal approval rating. Colbert sought
to encourage the president. "Sir, pay no at
tention to the people who say the glass is
half empty," he said, "because 32 percent
means its two-thirds empty. There's still
some liquid in that glass is my point. But I
wouldn't drink it..."
He also attacked the media ("I am ap
palled to be surrounded by the liberal media

that is destroying America, with the excep
tion of Fox News") and criticized their re
porting over the course of Bush's time in the
White House ("Over the past five years you
people were so good. Over tax cuts, WMD
intelligence, the effect of global warming.
We as Americans didn't want to know and
you had the courtesy not to try and find out.
Those were good times, as far as we knew").
He sarcastically advised reporters in the
room how to do their jobs: Write down what
the Press Secretary tells you and do not crit
icize the administration.
His point, of course, is that the media does
exactly that and, in so doing, fails to fulfill its
role in our democracy. Perhaps the most im
portant function of the media is to take an
adversarial position against the government.
In a democracy, it is the media's responsibil-

ity to challenge government officials
and ensure that they are acting in the
best interest of the country.
The mainstream media didn't re
spond well to Colbert's instructions.
In fact, by the time he finished, hard
ly anyone was laughing.
Richard Cohen, a columnist at
The Washington Post, railed Colbert
for his speech. Cohen begins his col
umn ("So Not Funny," May 4) by
stating "I am a funny guy."
Good disclaimer — at least we
know he's credible.
He goes on to criticize Colbert
for not being funny, but rude. "Self
mockery can be funny," he writes.
"Mockery that is insulting is not.The
sort of stuff that would get you

punched in a bar can be said on a
dais with impunity. This is why Col
bert was more than rude. He was a
bully."
What "Funny Man" Cohen sim
ply doesn't get is that Colbert in
tends to be a bully. An eerie parody
of Bill O'Reilly, Colbert's persona
represents the media, particularly
O'Reilly, forcing their information
down the throats of American citi
zens. In fact, Colbert's take on
O'Reilly and Fox News has turned
the conservative commentator into a
parody of himself. I can't watch
O'Reilly without thinking of Col
bert's impression. That, paired with
the drivel that typically comes out of
O'Reilly's mouth, puts me into hys
terics.
But the point is simple, and
Cohen actually touches upon it (al
though I'm sure he didn't mean to).
Colbert's speech only became fun
nier as the audience grew quieter

because it proved his point: The re
lationship between the White
House and the press is too cozy. Re
porters are not as critical of the
White House — especially this
White House — as they should be.
As Cohen wrote, "He
was...telling like-minded people
what they already know and alien
ating all the others." Cohen is right
here, but he doesn't mean to be. The
problem is that those "like-minded"
people should have been the press,
and the only person alienated, the
president. The fact that the entire
room was offended just proves Col
bert's point.
Not to mention the fact that the
press can't take a joke — let alone
any criticism.

Jeremy loves criticism...almost as
