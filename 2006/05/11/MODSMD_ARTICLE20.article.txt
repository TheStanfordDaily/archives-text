If you don't watch Stephen Colbert, you
should. He is the blowhard host of Com
edy Central's The Colbert Report every
weeknight at 11 p.m. A long time "reporter"
on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, Col
bert presents his interpretation of the news,
often mocking the "liberal" media along the
way. Colbert, who reams the Bush adminis
tration by pretending to be its biggest sup
porter, has created an on-screen persona
that is (sarcastically) stubborn, ignorant and
hilarious.
So it came as a surprise when Colbert was
asked to give the keynote speech at the White
House Press Correspondents Dinner, where
his two victims — Bush and the media —
would be his captive audience. Needless to
say, Colbert didn't disappoint. Check out the
speech at http://www.ThankYouStephenCol
bert.org.
He wasted no time going after Bush in,
well, a rather roundabout way. Regarding
his dismal approval rating. Colbert sought
to encourage the president. "Sir, pay no at
tention to the people who say the glass is
half empty," he said, "because 32 percent
means its two-thirds empty. There's still
some liquid in that glass is my point. But I
wouldn't drink it..."
He also attacked the media ("I am ap
palled to be surrounded by the liberal media

that is destroying America, with the excep
tion of Fox News") and criticized their re
porting over the course of Bush's time in the
White House ("Over the past five years you
people were so good. Over tax cuts, WMD
intelligence, the effect of global warming.
We as Americans didn't want to know and
you had the courtesy not to try and find out.
Those were good times, as far as we knew").
He sarcastically advised reporters in the
room how to do their jobs: Write down what
the Press Secretary tells you and do not crit
icize the administration.
His point, of course, is that the media does
exactly that and, in so doing, fails to fulfill its
role in our democracy. Perhaps the most im
portant function of the media is to take an
adversarial position against the government.
In a democracy, it is the media's responsibil-
