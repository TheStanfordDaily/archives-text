# A 						modern day fairytale
## Saying goodbye to South Africa 
### 
Fall dropped its suitcases by the door
and took residence as my seventh flat
mate. Suddenly, it's the end of May and
even the university's computer lab (kept at a
steamy 15 C) is warmer than outside.
It's time to go home.
While I'm looking forward to the Califor
nia sunshine, I don't know if I'm ready to no
longer be a foreigner. I'll miss the attention I
get here for simply not belonging. When I go
home, it'll be my turn to stop strangers in the
street when 1 hear them speaking with a
South African accent and over-enthusiasti
cally pry into their lives.
With only a few days left in Port Elizabeth,
suddenly small details take on new signifi
cance: the small bones people throw away in
the street after meals, the fact that chicken,
beef and biltong are common potato chip and
popcorn flavors here, the übiquitous and con
stant (albeit creative) low-grade sexual ha
rassment that has become only as noticeable
as spell-check telling me flavor is spelled in
correctly without the "u." When I get back to
America, will it be odd that men don't line up
alongside the road, relieving themselves in
plain sight? Or that cars change lanes to pass,
rather than edging next to the car in front of
them? How long before I start to forget the
women selling sheep heads — called "smi
ley" — or the Xhosa radio station that we lis
ten to more than any English-speaking one?

The other girls and I, predominantly
white and middle-class, now subconsciously
count ourselves as part of our families in the
township. We make fun of Afrikaners, their
80s clothing and hairstyles and their tenden
cy to let their kids run around barefoot; we
don't go out for food or drinks because 50
rand (seven dollard) for a meal is too expen
sive; we still make time for the soap opera we
all watched in New Brighton. What will hap
pen to that perspective when I get back to the
States? On a scale from one to wrong, how
terrible will it be that one of the first things I
do when I get back to America will probably
be to pay four dollars for a drink at Star
bucks? Will I turn a blind eye or will 1 now be
more attuned to the widespread inequality at
home? It's not enough just to acknowledge it
— what am I going to do about it?
My flatmates and I went to karaoke night
at a local bar; it was full of white people, en
thusiastically singing terrible Afrikaans pop
songs. We joked that we should go up there
and sing "Tshotsholoza" (a traditional Xhosa
song about a railroad) as a way of flipping off
the rest of the bar. But the thing is, no one
would get it but us. We're no less white than
when we first got here, despite perhaps hav
ing a deeper appreciation for the many chal
lenges faced by black South Africans both
then and now.
At times, I wish I could go back obviously

different. I have an urge to hack off my hair
or drastically change my wardrobe, to make
an internal change manifest itself externally.
Most likely the only thing noticeable differ
ence will the verbal quirks I've picked up
from the other girls, including vigorously
shrugging, bobbing from side to side and say
ing excitedly, "Yeah. It's pretty great," at the
end of every other sentence.
Ttoo things people commonly drop into
conversation have stuck with me. The first is
that, after asking how long I'll be staying,
many people ask, "When will you be back?"
I say I'll come back in 2010, the year my flat
mate Ann invited us all to witness the birth of
her first child, timed to coincide with the
World Cup.
The other came from the mouths of
health workers in rural areas, who would
take us around their clinics and hospitals.
They would show us their understaffed facil
ities and overfull wards, paint alternately sad
and optimistic pictures of people and com
munities struggling to cope and answer our
questions about catchment areas and adher
ence to drug regimes. Then they would ask us
only to remember what we had seen and
learned; to carry it with us in some undis
turbed corner of our minds. Remember this.
I will. I promise.
