## Daily's event coverage misleading 
### SAM DUBAL 
The Daily's coverage of yesterday's Nakba Day Commemora
tion was grossly distorted and misleading to its readers. First of
all,"Muslims protest Palestinian anniversary" poorly character
izes the nature of the event.The event was a commemoration of Nakba
Day not a protest, and sought to raise awareness about the plight of
Palestinians in the occupied territories. Furthermore, the group of
community members and students cannot be lumped together as
Muslims. Many of the organizers and participants, the author included,
were not Muslim. Those at the event were there to rally in the name of
justice, truth and peace, not in the name of religion. Categorizing the
participants as Muslims contributes to the non-productive, broad gen
eralization of groups of people who are supposedly committed to a sin
gle purpose. The reality is that Muslims, like Jews, are a diverse com
munity with many different interests and viewpoints.
Second, while the article discussed Weiss' preference to call the
apartheid wall a "fence," it neglects to mention that Israel's wall vio
lates United Nation resolutions. These resolutions, which specifical
ly refer to the wall as a "wall" and not a "fence," condemn the build
ing of the wall and demand that it be dissembled. The International
Court of Justice has also declared the wall, which is twice the height
and three times the width of the former Berlin Wall, illegal.
Third, Roei Kashi's suggestion that Nakba Day was "inciting
against Israel" is inaccurate. Nakba Day commemorates Palestinian

history and displaced Palestinians. It is a day to celebrate peace, jus
tice and hope. By no means does it coincide with Israeli independ
ence, which historically took place following displacement. Kashi
also fails to present both sides of the issue when he insists that "we"
(Muslims? Palestinians? American peace activists?) should be
"building [our] own communities." Instead, perhaps Kashi should be
asking Zionist American Jews (many of whom are culturally and lin
guistically disparate from Israelis) why they are more concerned
with the Israeli state rather than their American homes.
Finally, a point on the use of the word "terrorists," which was em
ployed by The Daily to describe members of Hamas. "Terrorism" is,
of course, a subjective term employed by those in power. While we
accept that Hamas has used violence to further its political aims, we
point out that the Israeli Defense Forces also uses violence, murder
ing innocent Palestinian civilians through raids and bombings.
Overall, the poorly researched and written article did not do jus
tice to the event. Far from a homogeneous protest, yesterday's com
memoration was the congregation and unification of a very diverse
group of people around a central cause of peace and justice in order
to raise awareness about human rights violations that began on
Nakba Day in 1948 and continue today. It was, above all, a celebration
of the culture, livelihood and steadfastness of an occupied people.
