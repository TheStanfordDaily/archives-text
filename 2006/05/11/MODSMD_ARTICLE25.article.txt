# Nakba Day article troubling
## 
### TALA AL-RAMAHI 
The Nakba Day coverage that appeared in
yesterday's paper ("Muslims protest
Palestinian anniversary") was very trou
bling, misleading and, most importantly, did not
address the most crucial point of the event.
First of all, the event is not a "Muslim
protest" but rather a commemoration of a trag
ic day for all people who truly care about justice
in the world. Muslims, together with Christians
and Jews, were all present at the event to stand
in solidarity with the Palestinians' plight for
self-determination and freedom.
As a CJME and OASIS representative, 1
would like to clarify that our event was not an
incitement against Israel but a call for people to
realize the injustices that the Palestinians have
been living through every day under the Israeli
occupation. Many people do not realize how
hard it is for Palestinians to "build [their] com
munities" when their homes are constantly de
molished to make way for new Israeli settle
ments, harsh economic restrictions are imposed
on Palestinians that force them to live on less

than three dollars a day and even the very free
dom of movement to go to work and schools is
controlled by the Israeli army.
Just as Stanford students care about elimi
nating injustices in the world, CJME believes
that it is our duty to stand against a harsh occu
pation that has lasted for over 45 years and has
subsequently created a refugee population of
over four and a half million â€” Palestinian
refugees that are denied the right of return to
their homes even though United Nations Reso
lution 194 clearly states that it is the right of the
refugees to return or compensated for the loss
of their property. There are over 64 United Na
tion resolutions targeting Israel and its tactics
and attacks on the Palestinian population. Until
the occupation ends and Palestinians have their
own self-governing and independent state,
CJME and human rights activists cannot remain
silent and accept the Israeli occupation as an un
fortunate fact because "Peace is not the absence
of war but rather the presence of justice."
