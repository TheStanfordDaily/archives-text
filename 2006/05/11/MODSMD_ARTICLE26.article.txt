## Cafe worker death sparks fundraising campaign for burial 
### LAURA CHANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On the morning of Wednesday, April 26, the
Stanford community lost one of its most
beloved members to a tragic car accident near
El Camino Real. Sandra de Anda was hit by a
car on her way to work at the Law School. After
the accident, she was rushed to the hospital,
where she died the following weekend due to
severe head injuries. Her colleagues and friends

are finding the loss immeasurable; as an em
ployee of the University's Law Cafe, de Anda
was known to many as a loving single mother of
two young children still in grade school.
"Sandra was just a very lovely person," said
Rob Blatman, manager of the Stanford Law
Cafe. "She was kind of quiet, but very pleasant,
hardworking and well-liked by everybody."
Upon hearing of the accident, Blatman was
"totally blown away," he said.
Students at Stanford Law School, too, were

shocked to hear of the tragedy, and soon turned
their grief into action. While no sum of money
could begin to replace de Anda's role on cam
pus, the Stanford Latino Law Student Associa
tion (SLLSA) and other concerned students,
faculty and staff organized a project to fund the
$15,000-plus expense of shipping de Anda's
body to Mexico for burial. Funeral expenses,
too, contributed to the overwhelming cost that
de Anda's family must bear on top of the al
ready devastating tragedy.

"It is really the students who deserve the
credit for undertaking the effort to help San
dra," said Cathy Glaze, Stanford Law School's
associate dean for Student Affairs, who helped
publicize the campaign. "Members of the
SLLSA started organizing as soon as they
heard."
"1 thought it was really remarkable that the
Law School was so very sensitive to the situa-
tion," Blatman said. "It was a very
nice thing to see."
A donation box at the Law Cafe,
too, managed to collect over $2,000
from a number of generous contrib
utors. The Mexican consulate of
fered an additional financial contri
bution. The SLLSA alone has raised
more than $3,000.
The effort was only one of sever
al ways the University community
honored de Anda's memory. Over

100 family and friends, in fact, paid
their respects last Saturday at her
wake in Mountain View. De Anda's
mother flew in from Mexico to join
her grieving family.
In a recent note to the Stanford
Law Community, the SLLSA articu
lated the family's desire to "thank
everyone at the Law School for their
help in this difficult time."Thanks to
the successful fundraising campaign
and a joint community collection ef
fort, de Anda will be buried in Na
yarit, Mexico this coming Wednes
day. It seems that no day would be
more appropriate to honor her and
the family she left behind â€” May 10
is Mother's Day in Mexico.
