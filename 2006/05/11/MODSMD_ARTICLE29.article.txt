# Betting on Barbaro, not Bonds
## 
### 
While watching Juan Pierre
temporarily halt Barry's
assault on history and
Babe Ruth last night, I was struck by
the inevitable disappointment of the
whole situation.
If we witness history and Bonds
eventually passes Hank Aaron
(which seems very unlikely at this
point), then the steroid allegations
will haunt the record until it's bro
ken again. But if he doesn't, this
baseball season loses a lot of drama.
So 1 think to myself, wouldn't it
be great if there were a sports figure
who could accomplish great things
and yet not be haunted by contro
versy? Because from Kobe Bryant
to Barry Bonds, there just don't
seem to be many of those athletes
left.
Except, of course, for America's
newest sports hero... Barbaro!
That's right, it's a horse racing
column. Well, sort of.
There's never been a better time
for a horse to capture our collective
heart. A horse unlike any other. A
horse for children to look up to.
A Triple Crown for Barbaro after
his decisive win in the 132 nd running
of the Kentucky Derby couldn't
come at a better time for the sports
world. And there are some who
would argue that this horse has the
best shot at going on to win the
Preakness and Belmont of any re
cent Derby winner. Barbaro was
bred for distance, and it's the un
commonly long Belmont Stakes at 1
1/2 miles that's tripped up so many
recent contenders for the Crown.
If Barbaro can in fact win the re
maining two legs of the most cele
brated horseracing title ever, he's in
stantly a giant on the national stage.
As the first horse since Affirmed in
1978 to capture the Triple Crown, his
achievement would have all the leg
endary qualities of the most hal
lowed of sports records.
But best of all is Barbaro's fantas
tic modern example of character in
sports.
Where are the fans screaming
about the ridiculously high wages of
the equine athlete? Where are the
cries of outrage at the highlight cul
ture's influences on horses? Where
are the steroid allegations that
plague so many baseball players?
Barbaro has remained above it
all.
Content with his meager salary
and promises of a fine retirement
when he's put out to stud, there have
never been even the faintest rumors
of a possible hold-out for more. And
horses don't watch ESPN. And per
haps most importantly, if steroids
were found in Barbaro's locker, we
could be absolutely sure that he real
ly didn't know what they were or
that they were illegal.
There will be no media snafus in
which Barbaro claims that if only his
jockey were Brett Favre, then he'd
have beat Bluegrass Cat by more
than six-and-a-half lengths at the
Derby. And any impromptu work
outs will have nothing to do with his
contract status.
No one will rant upon seeing Bar
baro's name in lights. There will be
no doubt as to whether or not he be
longs on a Wheaties box. Even being
a great one in a sport synonymous
with gambling, Barbaro's reputation
remains clean as a whistle.
He's never pulled an Allen Iver
son and claimed to just be "talkin'
about practice, man." He's never
faced criminal charges and squan
dered his talent like Maurice Clarett,
Marcus Vick and possibly Sean Tay
lor in the near future. Motorcycle ac
cidents a la Jeff Kent or Kellen
Winslow, Jr. are equally improbable.
And this is one athlete who definite
ly won't be dating Paris Hilton.
I don't know much about
horseracing. I've been to maybe half
a dozen events in my lifetime, and
watched about as many on televi
sion. But I do know one thing: Bar
baro? He's one of the good guys.
Has there ever been such a
paragon of virtue in modern athlet
ics? Will we ever see the like of Bar
baro again?
Of course we will. He's a horse.

Denis Griffin likes to think he's one of
the good guys. Set him straight at dj
