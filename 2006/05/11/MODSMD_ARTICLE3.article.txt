# Missing Val Riss
## Injury may have done in her labrum and rotator cuff, but her heart and soul fight on with her teammates—and best friends 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
Considering she personifies the heart and soul of
Stanford women's water polo as much as anyone, it's
ironic that senior Val Riss doesn't even have her name
listed on this year's roster.
For three seasons from 2003 to 2005, Riss battled against
some of the nation's toughest two-meter players as a stand
out on the Stanford defense. She would likely still be doing
just that, had a devastating shoulder injury not cost Riss her
senior season and one last shot at an NCAA title.
After a junior campaign in which she established her
self as one of the most dependable defenders in the Car

dinal backcourt, Riss tore her labrum and rotator cuff,
forcing her into surgery. The tears were simply the result
of years of water polo-related stress on her shoulder, and
Riss' doctors hoped that they could repair the damage
enough that she could play pain-free in her final year on
the Farm.
But Riss' condition didn't improve as much as the
doctors projected, forcing her into a difficult decision.
"Everything was good until mid-July, but then things
kind of fell apart," Riss said. "I was really worried about
starting the season but then not being able to finish it. We
had a lot of people quit midway through the year [during

Senior Val Riss has had to forego her final season due to a debilitating shoulder injury that did not heal as it was
supposed to. Nonetheless, she continues to play an important role on the team as one of its most devoted fans.
my time] playing, and it's pretty devastating to the
team when that happens. So I really didn't want to
do that to the team."
Even when the extent of her injury became
clear. Riss still had to force herself to accept her lim
itations.
"In September, 1 had already kind of come to
terms with the fact that there was a possibility that I
wouldn't be able to play," she said. "But when I ac
tually had to [resign my spot on the team], it was
probably the hardest decision I've ever made."
Thus, the women's water polo team lost one of its
most dedicated and motivational members.
"Val really did a lot to keep our team together
having fun and keeping a presence on campus," fel
low senior Laurel Champion said."[She] did a good
job keeping everyone's spirits up — she knew how
to make every person on the team smile, even dur
ing the most grueling workout. That is a quality that
most athletes don't have. She was an invaluable part
of our team."
Riss said her role as the team's "social coordina
tor" and her commitment to team camaraderie had
an early inspiration — the example set by Stanford
water polo legend Brenda Villa and the team's
other senior leaders three years ago.
"What I really liked coming in freshman year
was that the team was really a unit," Riss said. "And
the seniors would come to the TVeehouse with us
every Monday night and we'd hang out a lot. So I
think that that was what they gave to me that I tried
to carry on — that we were a cohesive unit both in
side and outside the pool, and that it was important
to hang out with each other."
Champion attested to Riss' ability to lend a lis
tening ear or provide the perfect words of advice.
"She's very approachable, so no matter what was
going on, she was always the first person people
would go to when they had a problem or if they had a
bad day," Champion said. "And she was really good at
sensing that stuff, too, so a lot of time she would make
the first contact, which was also really valuable."
The members of the Cardinal squad also re
spected Riss for the intensity that she demanded of
both herself and others.
"I really admired how she always went all the way
for everything," junior two-meter defender Alison
Gregorka said. "She never did anything half-heart
edly — if she was going to do it, she was going to it to
the best of her ability. That's something I definitely

learned from her, that even if you're just working on
a drill or something, you always do it all the way."
"A lot of people sometimes are afraid to be real
ly aggressive in practices,because of injuries, getting
hurt, offending teammates and that kind of thing,"
Champion added. "But Val would always say,' Play
harder on me, don't let me grab your suit,punch me,
kick me.' She made everyone practice like they
played."
Riss credited that attitude — not only for water
polo, but for life in general — to her older sister and
to her high school water polo coach.
"My big sister was for sure the biggest motivator
for me to play water polo," she said. "I followed her
everywhere as a kid. so when she started water polo,
I did too. But the biggest thing was that she never
shied away from really working out hard."
That strong work ethic manifests itself not only
in Riss' collegiate water polo career, but also in her
academic studies and plans of becoming a doctor. A
human biology major, Riss is currently putting the
finishing touches on her senior thesis — a compar
ative study of the pesticide exposure of migrant
farm laborers in Oregon and California — and is
awaiting the results of her first shot at the MCATs.
Following graduation, she plans to travel around
Europe before volunteering at a Mexican hospital
for at least two years.
Still, Stanford water polo will always hold a spe
cial place in Riss' heart. And her everlasting memo
ries, experiences and relationships have moved Riss
to remain one of the Cardinal's most active and de
voted fans, even with all her other commitments.
"The thing that I miss most about water polo is
the collective excitement," she said. "When all of
your best friends and you are getting ready for a
game, or you're all huddled up during a timeout,
you can just feel energy and excitement radiating
from everyone — it's unreal. I think that it's the
only time where you can feel just as elated when
other people succeed as when you do yourself.
"Stanford is the only team I've played on where
I've really felt like that. That is something that I
know I will never have again, but I'm so glad that I
got to be part of it at least once."
And should the women's water polo team
emerge victorious from this weekend's NCAA
Championship at UC-Davis, there will be one per
son whose smile shines brighter than all the others
in the stands — and that person will be Val Riss.
