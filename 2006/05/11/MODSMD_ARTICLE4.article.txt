# WOMEN'S WATER POLO
## Season on the line as women head to NCAAs Second-seeded Card's likely path: No 7 Marist, No. 3 UCLA, No. 1 USC 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
It's the middle of May, and for the members of
the women's water polo team, that means only one
thing — it's time for the NCAA title hunt to begin.
The Stanford women depart today for UC-Davis,
the site of this year's NCAA Championship tourna
ment, knowing full well that their performance this
weekend will determined how their entire season is
remembered. Unsurprisingly though, each player
professes full faith that this year's squad has what it
takes to go all the way.
"We are prepared so well by our coaches that we
simply need to go out there, play our game plan and
be confident and energetic," sophomore driver
Jackie Gauthier said.
The Cardinal (22-4) enter this weekend's compe
tition as the No. 2 seed in the tournament.
They earned their bid to NCAAs two weeks ago
by claiming the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
title. After upsetting UCLA by a 5-4 margin in the
semifinals of the conference tournament, Stanford
proceeded to knock off Hawaii, 6-3, in the MPSF
championship match.
In doing so, the Cardinal clinched an automatic
berth in this weekend's NCAA bracket. But more
importantly, their win over the Rainbow Wahine in
the MPSF title game reminded the Cardinal women
of the sweet taste of victory.
"Winning [MPSFsJ got us past the second-place
slump we've been in for a while," junior driver Katie
Hansen said, referring to her team's slew of runner
up tournament finishes in recent years. "We're often
in championship games, but it's been a while since
we've been champions. It's a great feeling, and one
we're planning on getting used to."
But an NCAA title is orders of magnitude
greater than a conference title, and the members of
the Stanford squad agree that the
real test awaits them this weekend.
"Taking the conference title was a
thrilling way to end my MPSF con
ference career," senior captain Lau
rel Champion said. "We're still not
number one, however, going into
NCAAs,so mentally we are not fully
satisfied."
To be number one, the Cardinal
will need to run the table this week
end and win all three games in which
they play. The tournament will fea
ture an elite field of eight teams from
across the nation. Five of these
squads — Marist (23-12), Davis (20-
11), Claremont Mudd-Scripps (15-
9), Hartwick (27-9) and Stanford —
earned spots at NCAAs by merit of
winning their respective conference
tournaments. The remaining three
teams competing — Hawaii (17-10),

UCLA (26-4) and top-seeded
Southern California (25-2) — round
out the field as the recipients of the
three at-large bids to the tourna
ment.
The Stanford women's weekend
begins tomorrow at 3 p.m., when
they take on seventh-seeded Marist.
The Red Foxes enter the tourna
ment fresh off an upset victory over
Wagner that captured the Metro At
lantic Athletic Conference title.
But although the Cardinal recog
nize the danger of looking past any
opponent, the perennial challenges
posed by southern California rivals
UCLA and USC still loom. Should
they get past Marist, Stanford would
likely face the defending NCAA
champion Bruins in a semifinal re
match on Saturday evening.
Owning a 2-1 record against
UCLA this season, the Cardinal
would love the chance to deny the
Bruins a chance at an NCAA repeat.
The UCLA women dealt Stanford a
crushing defeat in last season's
NCAA title game,claiming a narrow

3-2 victory. None of the three meet
ings between the two teams this year
has been decided by more than two
goals, and the Cardinal know that
they will need to be in top shape to
compete with the Bruins.
The same could easily be said for
the favorite of this weekend's tour
nament — USC. Despite being
upset by Hawaii in the semifinals at
MPSFs, the Women of Troy still pose
a formidable threat. They have lost
only twice this season, and have de
feated the Cardinal in all three of the
teams' showdowns this season.
But none of that is enough to
dampen the optimism the Stanford
women will carry with them to Davis
— every member of the squad
knows that claiming this year's
NCAA title is a daunting but realis
tic goal.
"Practice during the last week has
really shown how much we want this,"
Gauthier said in reference to her
team's will to win. "Our team has the
drive, and we are ready to go out and
prove ourselves as the team to beat."
