## Armed robbery stuns campus 
### DAVID GAUVEY HERBERT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Two armed men robbed a senior at gunpoint last
night in the Toyon Hall parking lot just after 10 p.m., a
crime that sent ripples of fear through campus email
chatlists in its wake.
The victim left Green Library and was walking toward
her car when two young men approached and asked for
directions to the gym. One of the men then produced a
handgun from under his shirt and ordered her into her
car. The victim got into the driver's seat, and the suspects
demanded cash. She handed over $20, but the suspects,
dissatisfied, pressed for more. When it became clear that
$20 was all she had, they turned and left.
The suspects subsequently walked away on Escondi
do Road in the direction of Mirrielees. The victim, shak
en, drove out of the lot and onto Escondido, passing the
two men as she drove back to her residence. The crime
was reported shortly thereafter.
News of the armed robbery began to flood campus
email inboxes less than half an hour after the hold-up
took place. Forwarded messages detailing the incident
crisscrossed dorm and student group chatlists urging cau
tion. The Diaspora email chatlist also buzzed with activi
ty last night as members expressed concern about possi
ble racial profiling in downtown Palo Alto, where two
black men matching similar physical descriptions later
robbed a man at gunpoint.
In that case, two men wielding
pistols held up a man and took his
wallet in Johnson Park in Palo
Alto—just 45 minutes after the
Stanford robbery, according to Sgt.
Hilary Karp of the Stanford De
partment of Public Safety. Police
believe the two incidents may have
been related. Stanford officers
have alerted departments in neigh
boring towns, Karp added. At press
time the suspects remained at
large.
The suspects in the campus
hold-up are described as two black
men about 18 years of age. One had
a goatee, and both were wearing
black, baggy pants. One suspect
was described as wearing a white T
shirt, and the other a black T-shirt
with white horizontal stripes.
