# SOFTBALL
## Switch hits, and paints to boot 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
When she steps up to bat, Anna Beardman is just as com
fortable hitting from the left side of the batters' box as she is
the right. But that's not all that helps the switch-hitting sopho
more outfielder stand out from a crowd.
For when there's no bat in her hands. Beardman may well
be holding a paintbrush.
"I paint on my off-time — summers and Christmastime,for
my family," she said. "I'll get requests and give them out. I do a
lot of flowers, a lot of landscape scenes and I did a picture of
my dog. I do all different things."
The Perris, Calif, native has never had much time off,
though; an active child, she picked up sports early. Like many
of her teammates, Beardman has baseball in her blood, so soft
ball was an easy choice.
"My dad played baseball," she said. "I went through a

bunch of different sports when I was
about four or five and that was the
one that he taught me the best and
that I picked up the best. I was kind
of a tough kid so it was the best sport
for me."
And years later, after visiting
four schools as a high school junior,
Beardman chose Stanford.
"I chose Stanford because it was
just the best place for me," she said.
"I love school and I love my sport,
and it was the best place for both of
those."
Beardman knows she's not head
ing to medical school — despite the
human biology major — but she is
keeping her options open.
"I haven't thought really serious
ly about my plans after Stanford,"
Beardman said. "But eventually I
want to own my own gym."
But for now, she is just enjoying
her life at Stanford, splitting her time
between classes, softball and relax
ing with her teammates.
"We all live together," she said.
"So some of the best moments have
been when we're together at our
dorms and we're just hanging out
and watching our TV shows or bak
ing — we're really big on baking —
or making dinner together."
"Anna has a great personality,"
Coach John Rittman said. "She has
lots of energy and spunk, and she fits
right in with our program. We have a
bunch of great kids and they get
along great, and Anna is a big part of
that."
She has been a big part of Stan
ford's success on the field as well. As
a freshman, Beardman played in 49
of the Cardinal's 59 games, with 39
starts. This year, she is one of five
players to have started every game,
helping Stanford to a 35-15 record
to-date.
Last season, Beardman tallied 17
RBI and 19 hits on just a.lBl batting
average, but this year has brought
marked offensive improvement.
Her average has jumped to .295 and
she already has 39 hits. She currently
leads the Pac-10 with five triples, in
cluding two in a single game against
Drake in February.
"Offensively, she is more consis
tent now [than last year]," Rittman
said. "And she adds great versatility
to our hitting because she can hit
left- and right-handed — short
game on the left and hit away on the
right. She has had some huge hits for
us, some game-winning hits."
Beardman has also emerged as
one of Stanford's most consistent
fielders, with only a single error in
her Stanford career.
"She had to make the transition
from playing in the infield in high
school and travel ball, and now she's
playing in the outfield at the Pac-10
level," Rittman said. "And she is
doing a tremendous job of it."
It wasn't the easiest of transitions,
though.
"Coming out of high school and
travel ball, she had an arm surgery
and pretty much had to relearn

throwing mechanics and work hard
to get that flexibility back," Rittman
said. "It was a long process and it was
frustrating for her, but she perse
vered."
"Transitioning into college itself
was a big learning experience,"
Beardman recalled. "This year I am
more comfortable and just working
on the things 1 need to do on a daily
basis, trying to get better every
game."
With two more years at Stanford,
Beardman has a bright future with
the team.
"She started quite a few games
for us last year and she has really im
proved her game all around,"
Rittman said. "And she is just going
to keep getting better through the
rest of her career at Stanford."
