## Stanford in Washington program renamed in honor of Bing's continual support D.C. program to expand after $10 mil gift 
### MANDY KOVACH DESK EDITOR 
Stanford in Washington, recent
ly renamed after University bene
factors Helen and Peter Bing, will
have the opportunity to expand its
program in the coming years. The
Bings, who reside in Southern Cal
ifornia, donated — with matching
funds from the William and Flora
Hewlett Foundation —$10 mil
lion to the endowment for the
Stanford in Washington program,
offered by the School of Humani
ties and Sciences.
According to Adrienne
Jamieson, the Mary Lou and
George Boone Centennial Direc
tor for Stanford in Washington, the
Bing's have shown constant sup
port for the program from the
start.
"Stanford in Washington came
into being in 1988," Jamieson said.
"Dr. and Mrs. Bing have been sup
porters from the beginning, con
tributing in a wide variety of ways
from assistance with the design of
the center—including art work
and gardens — cultural events and
field trips for students and support
for the academic program."
Unique and central to the Stan
ford in Washington program is its
internship program. Students are
given the opportunity to work at
renowned agencies such as the
Smithsonian Institution, the na
tional departments of Education,
State, Commerce, Justice, Health
and Human Services, the Senate,
the House of Representatives and
the Office of Management and
Budget.
Students are not only immersed

in the political culture of D.C.
through the program's internship,
but also through its policy-driven
coursework.The Bing program of
fers seminars taught by Stanford
faculty and small tutorials led by
policy experts.
With matching donations from
the $4(X) million fund established
in 2001 by the William and Flora
Hewlett Foundation for continu
ing education in the School of Hu
manities and Sciences, this most re
cent gift will allow for expansion of
the tutorial program. Among other
additions is a new building with an
art gallery, an increase in the num
ber of courses and humanities in
ternships offered and a distance
learning facility. The latter will
help facilitate participation in
classes offered on either the main
campus or in D.C., for students at
both locations.
"The gift will also allow stu
dents at the DC campus to stay
better connected to the home cam
pus and involve faculty in Palo
Alto in the academic activities in
D.C.," wrote Senior Vice President
for University Resources John
Ford in an email to The Daily. "The
gift also will ensure that the very
best Stanford faculty can come to
D.C. and teach our undergraduates
in that environment."
Jamieson expects to see a rise in
the number of students applying to
participate, with the possibility of
opening the program to graduate
students.
"Because the Bass Center in
D.C. is expanding, there will be
more room for more students to
