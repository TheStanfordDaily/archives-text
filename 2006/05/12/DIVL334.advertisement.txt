UNCLE MORTY.
Bathrooms clean enough for Aunt Sylvia. When demanding
guests arrive, send them to our place. We'll cater to their every
whim. After all, it's our job, not yours. Such a nice place to visit,
you'll want to send all your out-of-towners here. Next time
Uncle Morty and Aunt Sylvia stop by, tell 'em where to go.
