The Composting Councils of the United States and Canada have declared the first week of
May to be the annual International Composting Awareness Week. Organic materials suitable
for composting represent up to 70% of materials landfilled each year and composting them
has proven an effective form of utilizing this resource. Organics represents 25% of what
Stanford's Recycling Program diverts from the landfill.
