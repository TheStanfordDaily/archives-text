Palestinian anniversary" contained errors
that may have been misleading. The

CJME's diverse membership. The article
also mistakenly identified the Organiza-

(OASIS) as Outreach to Asian Immigrant
Students.

"Goodbye, baseball" incorrectly stated
that pitcher David Stringer came into the
third inning and gave up a double. He
came in with one out and a runner on third
and secured two outs to end the inning.
