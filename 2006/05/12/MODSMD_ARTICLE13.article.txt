The visit last month of your esteemed
and revered leader caused somewhat
of a stir amongst the graduate student
community (by which 1 mean, of course, a
couple of my friends).
To he rather more accurate, the stir was
not so much a consequence of the visit, hut
was, instead, a result of the exuberant
protests.
That the apocryphally spineless and spoilt
undergraduate community at Stanford
would rise up against the oppressive tyranny
of the Bush administration seemed to be a
positive thing for many of my peers.
(Personally, I disagree. I suspect that the
posturing of protest is just that: A posture.
It's an excuse to wave around signs, shake a
tambourine and show the cute girl who sits
behind you in Math 51 that you're, like, polit
ical. But that's just me.)
Apparently, we all think that you're apa
thetic about the political process.That you're
rich, you're privileged and that you only care
about what's going on in your bubble world
of Trees, Bands and Facebooks.
And so, the little petulant (almost toddler
tantrum-like) spark that you showed the other
week was greeted with a mumble of solidarity
and several expressions of pride. Go Stanford.
Along with a mild disapproval of your
anti-Bush antics (the sharper of you may
have spotted this from some between-the
lines reading of the above). I have to confess
that I'm not really a fan of the whole spoilt-
Stanford-brat meme.
There are a couple of reasons for this. First
off. I really don't see how anyone could argue
that you lot are disconnected from the world
around you. It's terrifying just how much you

all seem to care both about the people of the
world and about the padding of your resumes.
On any given day it's virtually impossible
to navigate your way through White Plaza
without being accosted either by someone
trying to serenade you with an awful a cap
pella remix or by someone attempting to get
your support for the local leper colony.
I admire this dedication. I really do. It
adds a twist of gut-wrenching guilt to the
everyday misery of life. Plus, you know, it
helps the children.
Leaving aside the wholesome goodness of
your average Farm-dweller, one can object to
the Stanford brat theory on other grounds:
You're just not that good at being privileged.
Any thoughts held by a casual visitor that
she was entering a bastion of the upper eche
lons of society as she stepped past the Oval
into the Quad would be swiftly dispelled on
noticing how its denizens dress. Quite frankly,
none of you clothe yourselves in a manner be
fitting your ostensible status — flip flops and
hoodies are just a little declasse, darling.
What 's more,you people have no idea what
the arrogance of privilege can really look like.
When it comes to affectation, your (former)
colonial overloads are real champions.
I am out of the country at the moment,

hack in England for a Cambridge reunion.
Well, it's not so much a reunion as a frighten
ing perpetuation of an air of superiority. To
morrow afternoon I'm getting my degree up
graded. For free.
Since time immemorial, Oxbridge (= Ox
ford + Cambridge) has been promoting
Bachelors degrees to a Masters seven years
after matriculation. And what do you have to
do for this honor? Nothing.
By virtue of the fact that I've stayed alive
since graduating, I will be the proud owner of
an M.A. by 12(H) GMT on Saturday.
When I combine this sort of nonsense
with our incredible fondness for dressing up
in dinner jackets and evening gowns and
swanning around sipping cheap sparkling
wine like it's Bollinger '88. it's hard for any
where else to appear more pretentious.
Now, don't get me wrong, I have nothing
against pretension. In fact, one of the reasons
I came to Stanford (along with the fact that
nowhere else let me in) is that I was hoping to
seamlessly transition from one set of rich kids
to another.
But, alas, Stanford: Just not posh enough.
Instead of swanky pretension, one has to
deal with earnestness and appalling taste.
The former is considerably more irritating
than the latter (can't stand people who care),
though I really fucking hate flip flops.
Still, I suppose it could be worse; when it
comes to bad taste and sincerity, no one holds
a candle to Berkeley.

dress up in evening wear and celebrate the
birthday of some long dead Lady with obscure
toasts and bizarre rituals.
