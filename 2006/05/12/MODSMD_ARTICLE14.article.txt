Stanford in Washington owes much
to Bings' generosity
Kudos to Helen and Peter Bing for their
generous gift to the Stanford in Washington
Program, another instance of their un
matched legacy of contributions to Stanford
University ("SIW set to expand after $10 mil
gift." May 11). Much like the perhaps better
known Overseas Studies Program (of which
the Bings are also primary benefactors), the
Stanford in Washington Program offers a
unique opportunity for students to get out
side the Stanford Bubble, while getting to
work and interact with many of this country's
most important statesmen, lawmakers and
businessmen. Program director Adrienne
Jamieson docs an unparalleled job working
with District locals and contacts to arrange
internships for students based on their inter
ests and goals, as well as coordinate events
like meetings with Supreme Court justices or
trips to see the National Opera — subsidized
by the Bings, of course. In addition to full
time internships, dedicated students also im
merse themselves in classes several nights a
week taught by visiting professors and Wash
ington elite.
It is difficult to call SIW a secret because
of its obvious popularity, but the fact that the
program will be able to expand and offer
more opportunities for more students should

be of tremendous excitement to the Stanford
undergraduate community, as it is to SIW
alumni like myself. Thanks to Helen and
Peter Bing for helping to make this possible!

Protesters didn't diss free speech
In Columbae, where several of us worked
to organize and advertise last month's Bush
protest. I hear debates to this day about the
appropriateness of our actions. The resolu
tion of this debate is important to future
campus activism, so I believe it's important
to understand that the protest was not in
tended to prevent Bush from speaking,
which would have presumably violated his
right to express himself.
While there were probably some people
that would have preferred Bush not visit the
campus, the organizers and protesters I
spoke with were excited Bush was coming
and were protesting his policies, not his pres
ence. Reporters falsely projected Bush's fail
ure to arrive at Hoover onto the intention of
the protest, likely because that was the
protest's biggest direct consequence. In real
ity, the purpose was to show the extent to
which people are saddened by Bush and his
administration, in as big a way as possible.
During the protest, a few of us worked to

bring activists together at the spacious and
photogenic intersection of Serra and Galvez
despite complaints that the motorcade was
n't likely to pass by there.TTiere was no fric
tion with officials until riot police were
brought in to clear the road. They succeeded
in clearing the intersection, but when they
tried to extend the barricade through the
heart of the group, splitting it in two. many
people resisted by sitting down. No one ever
tried to cross the barricade.
If there were students trying to prevent
Bush from getting to Hoover, they neither
made themselves heard nor succeeded in
creating a blockade. With the intersection
clear, all three entrances to Hoover were
passable, as demonstrated by cars that drove
in and out of the institution and on either
side of the sitting protesters.
So why did Bush decide to talk about his
presidential library' at Shultz's house instead
of Hoover? Did he not want to be discour
aged by the sight of protesters, was he eager
to check out Shultz's house, or was it bad
memories of his inauguration? My best guess
is that he didn't want the media publishing
photographs of his motorcade flanked by
protesters. Whatever it was, the headlines
that read "Protesters Block Bush" should
have read "Bush Avoids Protest".
