## YOUNG MEN'S TEAM STRUGGLES THROUGH FALL 
### 
Men's Soccer:
4-11-3,1-7-2 Pac-10

That the players who scored 11 of Stanford's 12
goals in 2005 return next fall might be the lone
speck of bright news in a trying season for head
coach Bret Simon and the men's soccer squad.
While less than ideal, the 3-4-2 start to the season
was at least respectable — but once the schedule
shifted to Pac-10 play and the opponents grew
tougher, the Cardinal's need for experience and
offensive firepower became all the more pro
nounced.
Just one goal in the last four games contributed
to a 1-7-1 conclusion to the season, with both non
losses coming in overtime squeakers. After taking
its lumps last fall, a squad used to contending on
the national scale headed into a difficult offseason,
perhaps one with more questions than answers.
For next year though, new hires Jon Pascale and
Rob Becerra will attempt to spark the coaching staff
as assistants, while rising senior goalie Andrew Kar
tunen — who has trained with the U.S. Under-20
National team — will provide the defense with a
solid backbone, and six returners received Pac-10
honorable mention nods last season. Santa Clara
visits for the season opener Aug. 25.

STALLED: In a season with just 12 Card goals, senior Cooper McKee managed just
one goal and no assists in 14 starts at midfield.

JUST FOR KICKS: Sophomore Kyle Hency creates space in a 1 -0 win over UAB.
But once league play started, wins became few and far between for Stanford.
