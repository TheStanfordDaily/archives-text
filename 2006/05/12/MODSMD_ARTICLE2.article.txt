# Med School faces diversity complaints
## Minority students point out dearth of University support 
### NIRAJ SHETH 
Last month, the Silicon Valley/San Jose
Business Journal praised Stanford Medical
School's success in attracting a diverse ap
plicant pool. At the same time, several mi
nority students have challenged this claim,
accusing the University of being overly
concerned with numbers and not providing
appropriate support for minorities once ac
cepted.
Statistically, about 20 percent of the
Medical School student body is comprised
of traditionally underrepresented minori
ties (Native Americans, African Americans
and Latino Americans) every year.This is a
significantly higher percentage than the
15.3 percent average for minority enroll
ment in medical schools nationwide, as re
ported by the Association of American
Medical Colleges.
The Medical School's admission office
prides itself in what Prof. Fernando Men
doza called a "very positive" experience by
minority students.
"Over the past 35 years, 98 percent plus
of our minority students have graduated
and have become successful physicians,"
said Mendoza. "This is one of the highest

retention rates in the country."
According to Albert Chavez, associate
director of Medical School admission, the
notion of diversity embraces all aspects,
ranging from academic interests to cultural
origins, sexual orientation and socioeco
nomic background. Despite differences,
"What they all have in common is that they
all have the skills and attitudes that will
promote their success in the medical pro
fession," he said.
Stanford's unique perks for minorities
include the prevalence of several minority
student organizations, including the Latino
Medical Students Association, the Student
National Medical Association (predomi
nantly African American) and the Stanford
American Indigenous Medical Students. In
addition, the Medical School has a branch
of Stanford's LGBT community, called
LGBT-Meds.
Another incentive to promote econom
ic diversity is the Medical School's strong fi
nancial aid program. According to Abera
Mentaferia, financial aid counselor at the
school, about 75 percent of students qualify
for some type of grant, with Stanford offer
ing to cover 1(X) percent of the demonstrat
ed need for students whose families earn
$90,(XX) or less a year.
The Center for Excellence in Diversity,
established at the Medical School in 1993,
aims to promote minority health issues
while addressing the specific concerns of
minority and disadvantaged medical stu

dents. According to its online mission state
ment, the purpose of the COE is to "in
crease the number of underrepresented mi
nority leaders in academic and clinical
medicine and to expand Stanford's capaci
ty to offer information, research and train
ing on minority health care issues."
However, there is much concern among
certain students and faculty members that
Stanford has not adequately met the needs
of students with disadvantaged back

grounds. Last year. The Daily reported on
one such student, who was called to a hear
ing to determine whether he should be dis
missed from the Medical School for irre
sponsible conduct. In defense, the student
accused the University of not being as open
to students from poorer backgrounds as it
advertises.

The quality of diversity of the Medical School, considered a model minority education in
the profession, has recently been brought under question.
