## New venture to update Chinese medicine 
### KATHERINE COX STAFF WRITER 
The School of Medicine has recently committed to
power a business venture that will provide researchers,
consumers and physicians in China with information
about advances in Western medicine.
Along with Texas A&M Health Science Center, the
Medical School will supply information updates for
Bridgetech Holdings International's Web site, which
aims to streamline the transfer of medical develop
ments to China. The project will operate under the aus
pices of the Wu Jieping Medical Foundation, a charita
ble organization within China's Ministry of Health that
seeks to advance the quality of healthcare for its citi
zens. Bridgetech, an informational technology firm,spe
cializes in making clinical trial data available to compa
nies and organizations looking to develop new tech
nologies in oncology and women's health.
According to Bridgetech, the Web site will be up and
running this summer, and the company expects it will
amass 100 million hits within the first 18 months. For
China, the site will constitute its largest Web portal de
voted to health care.
Stanford joined forces with Bridgetech in late April,
according to Paul Costello, the Medical School's execu
tive director of communications and public affairs.
"Hopefully our actions will be another step towards
promoting a free exchange of ideas," he said.
Medical School officials will post materials from the
Medical Center Report, a section that appears weekly in
the Stanford Report. In addition, Costello said content
from Stanford Medicine magazine will be used on the
site. Fortunately, according to Costello, these articles are
not so rife with medical jargon that they are inaccessible
to the average consumer.
"These publications are written for medical and sci
entific professionals as well as the lay public," he said.
The Web site will not publicize texts and publications
that are not already available online internationally; it
will merely consolidate these resources into a central re

source. According to Costello, international readers al
ready peruse these Stanford publications through Web
searches.
"Each year we receive hundreds of thousands of hits
online from consumers and medical professionals from
around the globe accessing the School of Medicine's
press releases and publications produced by the office
of communication and public affairs," he said. "Readers
learn about everything from novel treatments for
leukemia to basic developments in the understanding of
stem cell biology."
Assoc. Prof, of Health Research and Policy Laurence
Baker likened the Bridgetech model to other compre
hensive information sites that have emerged recently in
the health care Web community.
"I think this would continue a pattern that has been
developing for a while in the world of the Internet â€”
collecting available information and packaging it in
ways that are more easily accessible to those who could
use it," Baker said. "We do that with a lot of medical in
formation now with sites like WebMD, some NIH Web
sites and things like that. In many ways, this new venture
seems like an extension of that idea."
Though the site's content may be redundant with re
spect to other resources, its exhaustive nature may serve
Chinese consumers and health care professionals better
than the existing method of random searches.
"Most new information that gets published makes it
around the world to at least some people relatively ex
pediently, but perhaps a Web site like this could make
information flow faster or get to more people," Baker
said.
According to Costello, the development of this new
mechanism for the exchange of medical information
comes at an opportune moment in China's political evo
lution.
"It's undergoing an information revolution unparal
leled in its history," he said. Asked about possible expan
sion, he commented that "there are no plans to expand
the Web site or create more sites that target other na
tional audiences" for the time being.
