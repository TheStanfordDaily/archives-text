### NATASHA CHEN 
May is here, bring
ing good weather
and good music to
campus. Almost every
music group puts on a spring
show to share what they've worked
on during the year. The groups have been
together for at least an entire academic year, and at this
stage in the game, they're at their best. Here are some high
lights to look out for:
STANFORD JAZZ ORCHESTRA
Vaughan TUohy, a sophomore who plays alto sax for the
Stanford Jazz Orchestra, is preparing the group's concert
next week along with his 16 fellow orchestra members.
The group consists of five saxophones, four trombones,
five trumpets, piano, bass and drums. Their Wednesday,
May 17 show is free for Stanford students. Their guest
artists for the performance will be Wayne Wallace and
"The Fourth Dimension," which TUohy highlights as "four
of the best trombonists in the jazz tradition. "TUohy is ex
cited about their repertoire, which should be chalk full of
upbeat and technically challenging pieces. The Stanford
Jazz Orchestra will be touring next summer in Europe.
THE SPINS
Founded by senior David Baron in 2002,The Spins are
one of the most recognizable bands on campus. With Gabe
Davis on bass guitar, Ben Grant on drums, Jacke Conte on
keyboard, background vocals, and rhythm guitar and
Baron on piano, acoustic guitar, and lead vocals, this star
studded class 0f2006 bunch has been in existence since the
first week of their freshman year. In these last tour years,
they have performed over 2(X) times, including their two
winning performances at Battle of the Bands in 2003 and
2004. About to graduate, they will be taking their original
pieces (written by Baron) to San Francisco, where Baron
says "We're pretty much playing shows from here on out
every week...we're going for as big as possible. With their

recent critically-acclaimed demo CD
out and an award-winning music video,
they're looking for a manager and agent to
start touring the country. Baron has faith that
their success at Stanford will catapult them into
bigger venus across the United States, especially
with the help of online networks like MySpace.com.
Baron is excited to take the band to a new level, but says
that "Stanford will always be our home."
STANFORD TAIKO
The Japanese American ensemble drumming, linked
to Japanese-American political activism in the late
19605, focuses on visual presentation as well as rhyth
mic melodies. Although it draws from traditions of
Japanese festivals, it is also fused with jazz, Cuban and
Latin rhythms. Stanford Taiko, currently with 19 active
members, performs about once or twice a week during
spring quarter. This summer, the group will travel to
TTiailand to perform and Japan to learn from master
Taiko players.
STANFORD MIXED COMPANY
Mixed Company is Stanford's oldest co-ed a cappella
group and sings pop. roc, and alternative music. Last Octo
ber, they celebrated twenty years of existence. The group
acquired six Best of Collegiate A Cappella (BOCA)
awards from its nine albums, and traveled the nation nine
times on tour. This year is made up of three seniors, three
juniors,five sophomores and five freshmen. Senior Robert
Pronovost admits that "the best part about Mixed Compa
ny is how close you become with people of different class
years and how you become a family connected through
music."These close friends have sung all over campus and
the Bay Area this year in their attire of black, white and a
splash of red, all the while recording in the studio for their
upcoming tenth album. Their 159 alumni continue to sup
port the current Mixed Company, making this group rep
resentative of strong Stanford traditions even as it pushes
the envelope of contemporary a cappella.
