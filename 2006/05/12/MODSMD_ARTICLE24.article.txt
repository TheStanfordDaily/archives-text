It was easy to find Cafe Renaissance — its located
only one block over from University Avenue. That's
one plus. A beneficent staffer, interesting salad dress
ing and nice classical piano music are also among Cafe
Renaissance's "pros." Detracting from these positive
characteristics is the pricing which is not in line with what
the restaurant offers. At Cafe Renaissance, 1 ordered at
the counter, ate off an ugly plate and got water from a
stand with pitchers. Don't get me wrong — I mno snob.
Normally I'd have no qualms with such a set-up. But, I
expect a higher quality experience when my entree costs
$16.95. Cafe Renaissance's ambiance and food are cer
tainly acceptable, but don't embody the quality necessary
to warrant the price.
My lamb kebab platter ($16.95) came with salad, bas
mati rice, mint-flavored yogurt and a roasted tomato.
The salad featured a surprisingly Japanese-like dressing
that bursted with the flavor of fresh ginger. I loved the
dressing but was sorry to encounter a few slightly droopy
lettuce leaves. The lamb had a nice flavor although the
portion was not exceptionally plentiful. 1 was also disap
pointed by the basmati rice, which lacked the rich flavor
and aroma of basmati rice done at its best. The flavor of
the Persian tea also lacked intensity and richness.
Given that the friendly server told me the lamb kebab

was the best of all the platter dinners, I wouldn't recom
mend any of the kebab platters. But, I'm not ready to
completely discount Cafe Renaissance. If I were to visit
it again, I'd like to see whether my experience would im
prove by ordering a different meal. A less expensive se
lection might prove worthy of its cost. The $6.95 balsam
ic gorgonzola salad sounded quite good, and appetizers
such as dolmas, hummus, and falafel are only $2.50. Cafe
Renaissance also serves a variety of reasonably priced
wraps. It's probable that the Cafe better serves cus
tomers looking for a quick sandwich for lunch than those
hankering for a memorable lamb dinner.
