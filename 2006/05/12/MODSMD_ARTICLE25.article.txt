### VICTOR FUSTE BETSY CONGDON INTERMISSION EDITORS 
Hello, faithful readers. Alas, the subjugation of
Intermission continues as we continue in our
shameful broadsheet format. But fear not! We are
not negative people and we won't let this get us
down. We love being crazy fun, even if it means we
have oh, so little space.
But then again, some of us don't like being as pos
itive as us.
As you all know, nothing makes us happier than
hate mail. Why? Because it means that people are
reading us and that we're causing some kind of emo
tional reaction. Even if its an angry one. We've run
dirty articles. We've run smutty articles. We've run an
article making fun of the vice-president (nice shot
gun Dick) and we've even run an article on Chuck
Norris — and that's just asking for an ass whuppin'!
So of all things to get hate mail for, we get it for
an article on COACHELLA?! Seriously? C'mon
people. Of all the things to hate on, our coverage
of Coachella? Really? Of course, the best part is
that the hate mailer asked if we would like to run
his piece instead — after making fun of us!

For that, we award the hate mailer the first ever
Intermission "Brass Balls Award." We hope that
this person proudly displays their award all over
campus, slapping it in everyone's face as they make
fun of them for eating "overpriced teriyaki bowls."
We kid, ladies and germs, we absolutely loved
the hate mail and all its glory. Please keep sending
your hate and rage filled comments to intermis
sion.daily@stanford.edu so we can continue to
laugh and revel in your delicious words.
Unfortunately, we ran out of space to print the
darn thing, so the world at large can't bask in the let
ter's beauty. So instead, we decided to take the high
road and promote something everyone should be
excited about: THE INTERMISSION FICTION
WRITING CONTEST! We even scrounged up
some money, digging deep into the couch cushions of
the impoverish Daily to offer cash prizes. I bet you
didn't know this, but cash can be exchanged for
goods and services! How about that?
And, on top of it all, we've even given you a
list of great summer reading material so you
won't get bored this summer. But then again,
we probably won't have good enough coverage
because we suck, apparently.
