## Frosh compete for first Mr. Cardinal The 						first-time event boosts dorm spirit and showcases amusing talents 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Acts including a ribbon dance to "I'm a Barbie Girl"
and an original song praising toast earned freshman
Roble resident Austin Lyon the title last night in the first
ever Mr. Cardinal competition. Crowned with a tiara and
a pink sash, Lyon's victory earned Roble residents tick
ets to the opening night of "The Da Vinci Code."
The Mr. Cardinal competition was organized by the
Frosh Council as a spring event for the freshman class.
Male representatives from 17 freshman dorms compet
ed for the title, dancing, singing and showing their school
spirit. Dean Julie Lythcott-Haims of the Freshman
Dean's Office, the 2006-2007 Dollies and three male
members of the Simps acted as judges.
Despite midterms, students filled Kresge with dorm
cheers and shout-outs for their favorite contestant.
"It was awesome," said Lythcott-Haims. "I was total
ly thrilled by the turnout. I think we just established a
freshman tradition at Stanford."
The competition began with all 17 contestants per
forming a choreographed dance, followed by a fashion
show to demonstrate their school spirit. For the fashion
show, contestants abandoned their black Mr. Cardinal T
shirts and donned costumes including Hoover Tower, a
punching tree hat, a butterfly skirt and wings and cheer
leader outfits.
The field was narrowed during a second round of
questions and answers, where candidates had to come up
with on-the-spot responses to such questions as "What is
Victoria's Secret and why won't she tell?" and""What is
the most embarrassing thing you have said to someone
you liked?" All contestants managed to include "world
peace" in their answers.
Contestants were then asked to spin the "Wheel of
Challenges," performing tasks such as impersonating a
Dollie,doing an interpretive ribbon dance and lip-synch
ing to popular songs like "I Will Survive." Most contest
ants made use of props, including red feather boas, white
fairy wings and huge green sunglasses.
Following the "Wheel Challenges," the stage was nar
rowed to the final five and the prepared talent session.
The announcement caused contestant two to rip off his
shirt and a contingent of Larkin audience members to
exit loudly due to the omission of their contestant.
Though most of the night was light-hearted and hu
morous, with a dance from Napoleon Dynamite, a per
formance art piece entitled "The Final Interview for the
Default Font" and an anti-Cal song with a guitar and
kazoo, there were the occasional serious moments. For

his prepared talent, contestant nine read a poem about
the lack of gay marriage rights, saying, "I am waiting for
respect" and "waiting for acceptance."
Audience members and contestants said they enjoyed
the evening. Lyon remarked that the best part was meet
ing people from other dorms and learning the dance.

Mr. Larkin, freshman Isaac Johnson, shows off his skills
last night at the Mr. Cardinal pageant at the first ever event
hosted by the Frosh Council.
"I'm glad I brought honor to
Roble," Lyon said when asked about
his new title. "I think everyone had
an excellent show."
The event was co-chaired by
Frosh Council members Andrew
Ehrich and Jessica Lu, who said the
idea was based on events some mem
bers had coordinated in high school.
"It was intriguing and we decid-

Ed to go for it," Ehrich said. "We
wanted to give each contestant
more time onstage but we had to
eliminate them for the sake of the
show."
Ehrich and Lu said they left it up
to each individual dorm to choose a
representative. Some dorms did not
choose a contestant and others
dropped out because of the time
commitment, resulting in 17 contest
ants from 30 freshman dorms.
Freshman/Sophomore College's
freshman contestant Adam Cole
said he was chosen by a nomination
and vote at a house meeting.

"I didn't really know what I was get
ting into and still don't know,"he
said on Wednesday.
Asked about the event, he said he
thought the creation of the event
was good "to inject the class of 09
with spirit," though he found the
event "a bit self-indulgent."
Roble residents seemed happy
with the outcome. Freshman Sam
Kohrman said, "Austin is revolution
izing the concept of what a true
Stanford man should be," and Mon
ica Mueller, also a freshman, de
scribed her feelings as "jubilant and
victorious."
