### ANDREA FULLER STAFF WRITER 
Dancing and drums will fill the Eucalyptus Grove
tonight as the Stanford Powwow kicks off its 35th annual
event. Sponsored by the Stanford American Indian Orga
nization, the Powwow will bring approximately 30,(MX) vis
itors throughout the weekend, making it Stanford's
largest student-run event.
Powwow Co-chair Michelle Kauahquo, a senior, said
that the event will showcase Native American cultural tra
ditions from a diverse group of tribes.
"Most of the native community comes out for the
event," she said. "They say about 10,0(H) a day. We have
dancers coming from all different tribes throughout the
United States. We even have dancers from Canada. We
have a big arts and crafts display and food booths as well,
and we have 110 booths."
Kauahquo added that dancing and dance competitions
will be a major part of the ceremonies, as the Powwow will
give away over $32,000 in prize money.
"The contest dancing is a big part of the weekend."
Kauahquo said. "Basically, the whole
time after grand entry until closing
on Sunday around 5 p.m., there's
something going on the whole time."
This year, the Powwow will revive
old traditions like the Fun Run and
the wearing of shawls.
"After a couple years' absence,
our 10th annual 5k Fun Run will take
place this Saturday at 8 a.m.," said
sophomore Katie Jones, publicity
committee chair. "Also, our Stanford
Native women are getting shawls. We
apparently haven't had shawls in
years.The purpose is to get more peo
ple involved and to dance in our own
powwows."
Kauahquo said that the event re
quires yearlong planning.
"We've spent all year planning it,
and when we come back in Septem
ber we have to start it all over again,"
she said. "It's a never-ending
process."
Jones said the event is very per
sonal for many Stanford students.
"I'm part Cherokee and the Na
tive American Community here at
Stanford has been a central part of
my experience since I stepped foot
on campus," she said. "Since Powwow
is our community's centerpiece
event, it was just natural to get in
volved. Last year I volunteered dur
ing the actual Powwow and this year
I wanted a larger role."
Kauahquo said that the gathering
serves to unite the Native American
community at Stanford.
"I think the most important goal is

that it increases Native American
awareness on campus and it brings
the community together because we
all work so hard with one big even
throughout the year," she said. "It
gives everyone a chance to come to
gether and we all share our own
knowledge from each of our tribes.
The success is mainly due to the stu
dents because everyone works so
hard. We have about 70 or so students
contributing to the planning."
Roble Cultural Awareness Asso
ciate Rosemary Ndubuizu, a senior,
also encouraged non-Native Ameri
can students to learn about their
peers' cultures.
"It offers Stanford students a
wonderful opportunity to witness
amazing, beautiful cultural aspects of
American Indians' various cultures,"
she said. "Hopefully, attending spec
tacular events such as this will inspire
students to continually and proac
tively step outside of their cultural
comfort zone and witness and experi
ence the beauty of other people's
lifestyles and worldviews, which I
hope will inspire a more diverse and
culturally accepting society and en
compassing worldview."
Powwow organizers also ex
pressed hope that the event will
reach out to the larger Bay Area
community.
"Our continuing theme through
out the years for Powwow has been
'empowerment through education,"'
Jones said. "We also emphasize Indi
an sobriety. For the larger Stanford

and Bay Area community, Powwow
represents a celebration of Native
American culture. It is still alive and
vibrant."
The Powwow will be held from Fri
day, May 12 at 5 p.m. to Sunday, May
14 at 6 p.m. The event is free and open
to the public, though donations are
welcome. See http://powwow.stan
