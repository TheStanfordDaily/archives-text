event," she said. "They say about 10,0(H) a day. We have
dancers coming from all different tribes throughout the
United States. We even have dancers from Canada. We
have a big arts and crafts display and food booths as well,
and we have 110 booths."
Kauahquo added that dancing and dance competitions
will be a major part of the ceremonies, as the Powwow will
give away over $32,000 in prize money.
"The contest dancing is a big part of the weekend."
