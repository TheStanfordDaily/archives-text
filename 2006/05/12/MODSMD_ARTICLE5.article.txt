# SLAC Questions: Wage for whom?
## THE
						10 PERCENT INCREASE UNDER CURRENT POLICY APPLIES TO ALMOST NONE 
### ARAM HUR DESK EDITOR 
Despite President John Hennessy's announce
ment on Monday about the wage increase for sub
contracted workers by 10 percent, Stanford Labor
Action Coalition (SLAC) rallied once again yes
terday — pointing out that the policy still contains
restrictions that they say effectively exclude most
of the workers it is intended to benefit.
The rally, which attracted approximately 40 stu
dents, activists and workers, is part of an escalating
series of actions organized by SLAC to pressure
the University for what sophomore Matt Seriff-
Cullick calls "substantive and sincere" labor policy
reform. According to the Presidential Advisory
Committee, the current living wage policy applies
to almost no one, rendering the 10 percent increase
close to meaningless.
"What's 10.9 percent of zero?" said Zev Kvitky,
president of workers' union SEIU Local 715 and a
speaker at the rally.
The rally featured several speakers, including
Religious Studies Prof. Thomas Sheehan, labor
union representatives and students from SLAC.
Unified under the mantra "the people united will
never be divided," participants marched from
White Plaza to the front of Hennessy's office in an
attempt to start a dialogue.
"Obviously he hasn't really spoken to any
workers about it," said Alexandra Goldman, a jun
ior and member of SLAC. "If he had, he would
know that none of the workers at our rally are cov
ered by his 'living wage' policy and that many are
very angry about this lack of justice."
Furthermore, Goldman noted that even with
the 10 percent increase, workers are still under the
$13.41 wage that the California Budget Project es
timates is required for a single adult in Santa Clara
to live.
"$11.15 or $12.59 is not enough money to sup
port a single adult in the Bay Area, never mind an
adult who is trying to support a family," Goldman
said.
"The biggest fault of the administration is per
haps its insincerity," said Seriff-Cullick, referring to
Hennessy's Monday announcement. "Hennessy's
increase to the living wage was little more than a
PR maneuver."
Quite timely, the announcement was made one
day before SLAC's scheduled rally for Hiesday,
which had to be postponed. According to Seriff-
Cullick. Human Resources — the branch that was
supposed to have addressed the issue by earlier
this year — has not announced any progress and
ignores SLAC's request for information.
"The Stanford community deserves better,"
Seriff-Cullick said. "We deserve transparency, ac
countability, and a full, meaningful living wage pol
icy backed up by guarantees for the right to organ
ize and wage parity for all workers."
"We are going to do what it takes to get Stan
ford to implement a meaningful and real living
wage policy," Goldman said.
