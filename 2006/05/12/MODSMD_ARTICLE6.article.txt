### LESLIE GEORGATOS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This Mother's Day weekend, more than 100 vendors
will converge in White Plaza to participate in Spring
Faire, the annual fine arts and crafts festival benefiting
the Bridge Peer Counseling Center. The nonprofit pro
vides the Stanford Community with a 24-hour counsel
ing hotline, as well as information services and work
shops.
Fine arts displays will include pottery, glasswork,
painting, photography, jewelry and sculpture. Crafts
will include woodwork, clothing, soap, skin care and
handbags. Local musicians and dancers will provide en

tertainment as 12 food stands will provide fairgoers'
staples such as cotton candy and hot dogs.
"This fair is outside, it has entertainment — it's a de
lightful show to do in comparison to many street fairs,"
said Allen Burgi, a Stanford alumnus and five-time re
turning vendor at the Faire. "It's very enjoyable. We
have the whole plaza, we have the entertainment, and
we have the places to eat. Everything is right there."
"Many of the artists come because they enjoy the
venue and the campus," said Shirin Golkar, head coor
dinator for this year's Spring Faire and a live-in coun
selor at the Bridge. "A good number of them are Stan
ford alumni and they support the Bridge and enjoy the
laid-back atmosphere of the Faire."
Burgi and his collaborators make candles and soaps
of olive oil, palm oil. coconut oil and plant oils like
lavender.The handmade soaps are packaged in old fruit
boxes and sell for $3.75 each. His
products are typical of the crafts at
the Spring Faire, which only show
cases handcrafted goods made by
the vendors themselves.
"The Faire has grown into a well
respected fine arts and crafts gather
ing, and it is competitive to get into,"
said Golkar. "We have a jury who re
views photos of the artists' work in
order to determine who gets into the
fair. The more creative and labor-in

tensive the artist's work is, the more
likely it is for the vendor to get into
the Faire."
Arts and crafts vendors pay $270
for a 10-by-10-foot booth. Food ven
dors must shell out $320 for the same
space, and chairs and tables are
available at additional cost.
According to Golkar, the Stan
ford Spring Faire is one of the West
Coast's longest-running fine arts and
crafts fairs. The arts and the Bridge
Peer Counseling Center have been
connected for decades, he said.
"When it was founded in 1971, the
Bridge fostered a counter-cultural
community, and it attracted hippies
and artists," Golkar said. "The Faire

started as a festival for people to ex
press their creativity; it was a celebra
tion of the community and of art.
Gradually the Faire developed and
built itself a reputation, so subsequent
generations have been able to use this
momentum to continue the Faire as a
successful fundraising endeavor."
In the months leading up to the
Faire, selected Bridge staff work hard
to generate publicity and attract ven
dors. A letter sent out to prospective
vendors states that the Faire's public
ity budget was increased by 50 per
cent this year, allowing for extensive
local flyering, posters, banners, news
paper ads and postcards for every
Stanford faculty and staff member.
