This Mother's Day weekend, more than 100 vendors
will converge in White Plaza to participate in Spring
Faire, the annual fine arts and crafts festival benefiting
the Bridge Peer Counseling Center. The nonprofit pro
vides the Stanford Community with a 24-hour counsel
ing hotline, as well as information services and work
shops.
Fine arts displays will include pottery, glasswork,
painting, photography, jewelry and sculpture. Crafts
will include woodwork, clothing, soap, skin care and
handbags. Local musicians and dancers will provide en

tertainment as 12 food stands will provide fairgoers'
staples such as cotton candy and hot dogs.
"This fair is outside, it has entertainment â€” it's a de
lightful show to do in comparison to many street fairs,"
said Allen Burgi, a Stanford alumnus and five-time re
turning vendor at the Faire. "It's very enjoyable. We
have the whole plaza, we have the entertainment, and
we have the places to eat. Everything is right there."
"Many of the artists come because they enjoy the
venue and the campus," said Shirin Golkar, head coor
dinator for this year's Spring Faire and a live-in coun
selor at the Bridge. "A good number of them are Stan
ford alumni and they support the Bridge and enjoy the
laid-back atmosphere of the Faire."
Burgi and his collaborators make candles and soaps
of olive oil, palm oil. coconut oil and plant oils like
lavender.The handmade soaps are packaged in old fruit
