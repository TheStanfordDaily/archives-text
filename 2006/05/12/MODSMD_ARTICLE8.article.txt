## Editorial Thanks for everything, Mom 
### 
This Sunday is Mother's Day. If you are
reading this and realize that you forgot
to get something for your mom, it's not
too late to send a Mother's Day card or call
over the weekend.
We remember our mothers as caregivers
who helped us with our homework, cooked
our meals and took us to school. Many of us
would never be who we are if not for our
mothers. It was their strength of character
that shaped our own. It was their beliefs that
transformed ours. For better or worse, many
of them left an indelible impression on our
early development.
In light of the tremendous sacrifices that
our mothers have made, it would be criminal
to restrict our gratitude to one day out of the
entire year. But Mother's Day gives us an
opportunity to reflect on how our mothers
have influenced our lives.
Admittedly, Mother's Day is one of those
heart warming holidays that you thought we
would never editorialize. But the Editorial
Board has chosen to examine the deeper so
cial issues involved.
All over the nation, people are celebrat
ing mothers for their love and self-sacrifice.
At times, the holiday has been reduced to
kitsch and commercialism — children make
cards and adults buy meaningless trinkets as
tokens of appreciation. Meanwhile, mothers
are elevated to the status of noble, superhu
man creatures whose value is marked by
their boundless capacity to give.
But should we really swallow the rhetoric
of the holiday unquestioningly? After all,
there is danger in believing that the role of
the mother is defined by self-sacrifice. Such
views only reinforce stereotypical gender

roles in today's society.
As young working mothers enter the pro
fessional world, they are still pressured to
conform to certain restrictive societal expec
tations. Though much progress has been
made, and women are beginning to bridge
the gender gap in many areas of society, they
are continually limited by their sex. Their
roles are still largely bound up in childbear
ing and childrearing. As such, it becomes
problematic for us to list selflessness and self
sacrifice as requirements for motherhood.
In celebrating Mother's Day, we should
not only honor the sacrifices that our moth
ers have made, but also recognize the
amount of pressure that still forces women
to become martyrs for their families — al
ways putting her needs second to those of
her children. But it is not necessary for
women to be enslaved to their children. It
should not be painted as a virtue imposed on
the entire gender.
Yet at the same time, we must remember
and respect that there are women who willing
ly and happily choose to make sacrifices for
their children — mothers who have chosen to
give up their careers and mothers who have
taken more than one job to support their fam
ilies. We must honor these noble and selfless
mothers for the sacrifices they have made.
We should celebrate our mothers and
everything that they have done for us, but we
must learn not to demand or expect such
selflessness. So besides thanking your moth
er, recognize that everything she has done
was a choice, not a requirement of mother
hood. Thank her for the choices she made,
but also affirm the right of future genera
tions of women to choose for themselves.
