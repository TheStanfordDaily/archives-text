# The
						real Sleep and Dreams

### 
I've become concerned that if you were
to read my column on a regular basis
(unlikely). I would come off as a stodgy
septuagenarian who pines for the "good ol'
days" of corporal punishment in schools
and tables made of real oak. not that com
posite wood crap. A real complainer.The re
ality is that I have a fun side, too, and am, in
the ineffable words of Al Purdy. a Sensitive
Man.
As Facebook will tell you, dreams are a
central interest of mine. For a few years now
I've kept a dream journal.To help you get to
know me. Sensitive Man Barrett, a little bet
ter and dispel those septuagenarian fan
tasies (ewww!) of yours. I've decided to
share selected entries from my dream jour
nal. The dreams are all mine, but the inter
pretation. dear reader, is all yours.

1 am rushing Kappa Sigma. TTie Kappa
Sigma guys are the usual collection of frat
boy assholes. Illey start the hazing by mak
ing us drink a large glass of beer, followed by
a large glass of beer tainted with ammonia.
For those of us who finish it.it effs us up pret
ty good.
Later I find out that Jake Gyllenhal and
his older sister are rushing, too. None of us
receive a bid.

I'm in a high school library. It's an im
mense. unbroken room with lots of comfy
chairs and computers. The walls are stark
white. Beck is sitting on a couch, guitar in
hand, playing songs. A couple of kids sit
around him and listen, but everyone else is
concentrating on their work. Iliey don't
mind the noise, however, and take the time
to applaud after he finishes each song.
1 don't want to play the groupie, but I
slowly inch my way closer. Eventually we're
sitting next to each other, on the same couch.
Beck and I start chatting. He says he is giv
ing a concert with Phish and Reel Big Fish
soon, and implies he might be able to get me
tickets. As he is leaving, I tell him I recently
saw a Ben Folds show. He corrects me and
tells me the proper term is "concert."

In a Hobbit-esque world. I find a single
leather shoe with a blade on the bottom,

much like an ice skate. I use it to travel along
a system of roadside cables, propelling my
self along by pushing with my back foot. I am
running from something. Eventually I catch
up with my mentor, who has made it to the
end of the cable system. I think my mentor
was John McCain.

In a packed auditorium, a hefty Republi
can sitting in the seat directly in front of me
begins to mock me. using big words I don't
understand. I try to play it off cool, but he is
unfazed. I, however, am very fazed, and at a
loss for an adequate rebuttal. I feel defeated.

I lost all my teeth. One decayed tooth
goes up my nose â€” apparently the source of
my recent sinus problems.
A creative writing teacher I know
records his dreams daily. At one point, after
having done this for years, he realized he had
amassed S(K) typewritten pages worth of
dream notations. He read through them all
and discovered that, despite the massive
number of bizarre and original dream sce
narios, each one fell into one of six cate
gories.
While reviewing my dream journal for
this column, I started looking for reoccurring
themes. I realized that, as in real life, girls are
usually my best dream friends, but my neme
ses and my heroes are almost always men.
Guilt and shame are frequent emotions, but
so are wonderment and awe. In dangerous
situations, I become the protector.
Now. protector that I am. I'll protect you
from further boring analysis by ending here.
Hopefully my dreams were more interesting
than reading about a conversation someone
had in IHUM section.
