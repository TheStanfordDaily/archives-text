## Editorial Follow your heart this summer 
### 
As spring quarter comes to a close,
most students are finalizing their
summer plans. In high school, sum
mer signified no homework and no worries,
but its meaning is drastically different for
college students. At Stanford, summer is the
time to set yourself above the rest and pad
your resume with an impressive internship.
At times, the pressure to secure the best
internship with the most prestigious compa
ny can be overwhelming. Some of us have al
ready found these positions, others are still
scrambling, and still others have decided
upon an entirely different course for the
summer involving nothing similar to either
investment banking or consulting. But those
who've secured their spots at the top tend to
look down upon the rest.
In all of this frenzy, many lose sight of
what should really matter in an internship
and just apply for what's in vogue at the mo
ment. For those who actually find invest
ment banking or consulting interesting, an
internship in one of these fields can be re
warding. For those who are trying a little bit
of everything to find their true calling, taking
on one of these internships may also be a
good idea. But for the rest of us who could
n't care less about either investment banking
or consulting, we should remember that
there are other equally important and possi
bly more rewarding things we can spend our
summers doing.
The general Stanford culture seems to
suggest that anyone who hasn't secured a
top internship in New York or Los Angeles is
wasting their time. Volunteering at a local
community center, working full-time to help
pay for next year's tuition or traveling with
friends and family are often looked down
upon as being less prestigious and, conse
quently, less worth while. However, these ac
tivities are a much better fit than any con
sulting internship for many people and can
provide more fulfilling, and perhaps truer

to-reality, life experiences.
While the Editorial Board does not con
done becoming a couch-potato for three
months, we do encourage students to pursue
their genuine interests during the summer,
whatever those interests may be. The real
purpose of those three months of summer
should be to help you explore your interests
and decide what path your life will take.
Prestige is, of course, important, but if what is
considered prestigious at the moment does
n't match your interests, then it is not neces
sarily the best choice.
If your true passion is art, filing paper
and bringing coffee to top-executives may
not be your most beneficial option. If
you're concerned with environmental is
sues, there's nothing wrong with staying in
your home town and taking small steps to
ward a cleaner world rather polluting the
air from a high-rise office. If your financial
situation forces you to slave away at your
local grocery store or restaurant, then you
should be applauded for your determina
tion and work ethic rather than censured
for your "demeaning" choice of job. Even if
your current passion is just traveling
around the world with your friends, the ex
periences you will have and the things you
will see will make up for not spending the
summer in a suit.
We understand that hip internships like
consulting and investment banking have
their pluses â€” fat pay checks, important
connections and maybe even a guaranteed
job after graduation. But regardless of how
tempting these perks may be, they are not
sufficient reasons in and of themselves to get
an internship in these fields. Rather, your
passion and character should take prece
dence over other considerations. In the end,
putting aside your true interests for money
or prestige will not only equal a miserable
summer, but will also set possibly disastrous
precedents for your entire life.
