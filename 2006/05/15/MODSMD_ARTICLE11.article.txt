# There aren't enough Republicans to argue with
## 
### 
Coming from good old Gilbert, Ari
zona (ranked as America's seventh
most conservative city), I may just be
getting homesick, but I really miss hearing
the conservative viewpoint. Sure you can
say The Review is distributed, but what re
ally matters are the people you live with,
and here at Stanford our colors are blind
ingly blue.
I'm not saying that I want equal propor
tions of left- and right-wingers, or even near
proportions (look how that worked out in
the presidential election). I'm just saying
that for the sake of debate and maintenance
of my liberal beliefs it would be nice if some
one else was willing to voice the other side
once in awhile. When I Facebook search
"very liberal" I get over 500 hits. When I
search "very conservative," I get 67.
This debate 1 desire isn't something ful
filled by glancing at Review articles, and not
just because these articles are as intelligent
as SLE life is exciting. Debate should hap
pen in person, not in print. After all, any sort
of debate requires two parties to be present
so that they can take turns making argu
ments. Though an incisive article might
make you question some of your beliefs (or
in the case of reading The Review, strength
en your liberal beliefs), this effect doesn't
mean much if the only people you have to
discuss the article with are of the same mind
set as you.True, there are conservatives scat
tered about, but it is rare that they have
enough numbers to mount a respectable ar
gument (not that their arguments are ever
very respectable).
I remember when one of my friends tried
(bless his God-and-country heart) criticizing
the student protest of Bush's visit. My liber
al friends descended upon him with the
speed and vigor of vultures attacking fresh
roadkill, tearing at him from all sides with
bellowing arguments about free speech and
the incompetence of our president. Though
for the most part I agreed with them, I was
disappointed that he could not give his opin
ion without being pounced on by a mob of
self-righteous liberals.
I miss hearing about the importance of
two words added to our Pledge of Alle
giance to combat communism. I miss listen
ing to why letting certain people wed would
destroy the institution of marriage. I miss the
concern for the lives of innocent fetuses, but
not innocent adults in other countries. This

super-liberal atmosphere is not only boring,
but also dangerous because of how unrealis
tic it is.
For instance, I cite a recent event: In a tal
ent show, a male student wanted to ask for a
"female" volunteer to demonstrate his se
duction skills; but he was not permitted to
specify the gender of the volunteer because
it would be deemed "hetero-normative" to
even vaguely imply that men normally se
duce women. It is bowel-shakingly ridicu
lous that any group would enact such a limi
tation.
But, sadly, it is the tendency of liberals to
become so concerned with majority beliefs
offending someone that they make policies
which reflect a (rather ironic) tyranny of the
minority. How can something be decried for
being "hetero-normative" when the wide
majority of the population is heterosexual?
Understand, I in no way mean that it is un
natural, wrong or embarrassing to be homo
sexual, but it is no insult to the homosexual
population for heterosexuals to behave as
they usually do. Maybe some red seeped into
me back home, but I've been more offended
by profuse swearing in slam poetry at Stan
ford than I have by men wanting to seduce
women.
In communities outside the Stanford
bubble (and some of Northern California),
such intense political correctness does not
exist. To be prepared for the real world it
would be better to live in a place similar to it.
Perhaps this is the purpose evangelicals
and conservatives serve besides cutting wel
fare, starting wars and prohibiting science.
Republicans keep the liberal population's
tendency to pander to minorities in check,
while also giving Democrats the ability to
strengthen their beliefs through discussion. I
may not like what they have to say, but it's
still useful to have right-wingers around.
