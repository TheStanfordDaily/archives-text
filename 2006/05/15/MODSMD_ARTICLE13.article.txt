# That's not a housing solution?

It's the Death Star! The Editorial Board,
who routinely makes such hard-hitting
claims as: "We don't understand the ad
missions process," discussed the hot-button
topic of housing's master plan last week. Are
they for or against it? Their answer: Yes.
Thank you for your candor Editorial Board,
now go back to advising us on what we
should do with our summer.
As the Draw is wrapping up, let's talk
about Emperor Bravman's latest schemes to
build an empire of academic theme houses.
Recently the University has unveiled two
new academic theme initiatives. Bravman
announced them to The Daily last month,
saying: "We're adding new themes to two
houses; we'll put together some catch phras
es and more ways to make the Draw difficult
later." This has come as no surprise to some,
for the University has been spearheading dy
namic and well-defined projects like this for
years.
Devised by the resident fellows of dorms
who think that what students really crave is
more priority hassle and academic work in
addition to their own course loads, the
themes will aim to attract upper-class stu
dents who further want to isolate themselves
from real people to spend more "quality
time" with their books and Myspace.com ac
counts. The freshmen who draw into these
houses, I'm certain, will be really excited
about such a community.
The fact is:The University needs more ac
ademic theme houses.
Without seminars, lectures, approachable
faculty and hundreds of clubs. Stanford stu
dents are in danger of not having enough ac
ademic focus. Thus, academic theme houses
are essential to this campus. Students ab
solutely love perusing the housing list look
ing for which dynamic words and majors are
housed where. Many students have stated
they are "excited to learn" and "can't wait" to
have that smelly guy down the hall lecture
them about his Peruvian stamp collection.
For a theme point.
Some Daily staff members have ques
tioned why the University has not instituted
an English theme house, as English is one of
the most popular majors on campus and be
cause the people who generally major in the

subject are friendly, clean and social.
The University will likely decline the
offer because the "English theme" is not
convoluted or forgettable enough a name to
meet the strict criteria for selection of a
theme house. The University is firmly com
mitted to its policy of combining buzz words
into a catch phrase to make a name that is
about as pleasing to the ear as a gopher get
ting stuck in a vacuum cleaner. TTiis formula
has worked for the "Community Advocacy
in a Global Environment" themed house, as
well as the "Mind and Intelligence" house
and the "Community Educational Commu
nity" dorm. Bravman believes these names
"roll off the tongue."
Arroyo, one of the new theme houses, has
academic programming that looks pretty in
teresting. As The Daily previously reported,
the seminar topics include "AI in the movies,
computer game interfaces... how to solve
puzzles." Yes, the resident can look forward
to watching the movie Artificial Intelligence,
talking about it on World of Warcraft and
having very fulfilling conversations about
Sudoku.
The University currently offers four eth
nic theme houses, and some have wondered
why Stanford has not elected to have an Irish,
Portuguese or Middle-Eastern theme house.
A number of students have wondered why
we have selected four groups as worthy of a
theme and others as not. Others have theo
rized we may be isolating some students by
placing incoming students in all-freshmen
housing except for those placed in four class
ethnic theme communities.
I'm personally a big fan of a Scottish
house. For theme points, people drink a lot
and go disrupt soccer games. At the dinner
language tables, we'll have signs that say "no
comprehensible English spoken."

Others have rallied for religiously-orient
ed theme houses. If Stanford believes that
ethnic communities create diverse cultural
experiences ripe for dialogue, many would
argue religious groups do as well. Therefore,
perhaps Stanford should have religious
themed houses. The Scientology house must
be located by an area with lots of fields for
UFO landings, however.
Some believe the University should cre
ate more houses around specific ideals or dis
cussion topics. So far Stanford has only felt
community service worthy of a house, and
thus the administration has rejected plans for
an "Evolution vs. Creationism" house, as well
as an "Israel-Palestine" themed house. Still
no word yet on its "Yankees vs. Red Sox"
themed house.
Some sources have questioned the need
for another theme house, as it just creates
more hassle for priority in the already diffi
cult Draw. Others wonder why we even have
theme houses because (with the exception of
the language theme houses) the theme is
never integrated into the house. A few have
even declared that theme houses further iso
late, label and separate this campus, rather
than bringing it together. Some fringe mem
bers of this campus believe that college is
about getting to know different people and
cultures, and living among peoples of all in
terests, cultures and beliefs could only fur
ther our education.
To these people I say, our university is a
place to learn and we must force this down
the throats of our students at every hour of
the day. Further, themes need not be inte
grated into the dorm to be effective. They
merely must appear to exist so students
seem to be engaging in discourse on the sub
ject. And last, isolating, labeling and separat
ing students is a recent trend in American
politics, and the patriotic thing to do. Allow
ing students of all backgrounds and interests
to mix is a residential program of treason.
Hooray for the new Housing Master plan.
Hail to the emperor.

Chris thinks Stanford without theme houses is
a had idea, hut having too many is ridiculous.
So where's the middle ground? Send com
