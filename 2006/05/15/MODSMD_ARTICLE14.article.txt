## Filipino dance event sees long prep, huge hit Stanford's Filipino community lacks presence, group struggles 
### JULIE KLEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Though Stanford's Filipino student popula
tion may be small, the Kayumanggi Filipino
Dance Troupe calls its spring show a rousing
success. The group has struggled to establish a
foothold due to the minimal Filipino student
presence at Stanford, but it finally held its first
ever spring performance, titled "Epic Quality,"
Friday night in Kresge Auditorium.
The Kayumanggi troupe, in collaboration
with the Pilipino American Student Union
(PASU), had been working on the show since
the end of last quarter, said graduate student
Jason Sinocruz, chair of Kayumanggi and co
executive producer of Epic Quality. The group
held weekly practices throughout spring quar
ter to learn the dance routine.
Unlike groups at schools with bigger Fil
ipino populations, many of Kayumanggi's
dancers are "volunteer dancers" with no prior
dance experience. Any interested dancers may
participate as long as they attend practices.
"Sometimes this makes things difficult be
cause we don't really have a structure in place
to hold people accountable," Sinocruz said.
"Nevertheless, the system seems to work, and
anyone can join our group."
The majority of the dancers are members of
the Stanford Filipino community, but non-Fil
ipinos who are interested in the culture and
dance are also welcome to join.
"We'd like to share the various aspects of the
Filipino culture with the Stanford community
and the community at large, and the show is the
perfect vehicle to do that," Sinocruz said. "The
show has also been a tremendous way to build
and strengthen our own Filipino community
on-campus and for the performers themselves
to learn more about Filipino dance and cul
ture."
Senior Mark Marzona expressed similar
sentiments.
"The show made me proud to be a part of
the Filipino community," he said.
Stanford's Filipino community is much
smaller than that of other schools. Many col
leges, such as UC-Davis, Santa Clara and UC-
Berkeley, frequently have Pilipino Cultural
Nights (PCN). At these events, Filipino organi
zations perform elaborate dances, routines and
skits. Stanford currently does not have the re
sources to arrange such large-scale perform
ances, but Kayumanggi has hopes for the fu
ture.
"Together, we simply do not have the man
power or resources to dedicate all our time to
putting on a production comparable to these
other shows," Sinocruz said. "Hopefully, one
day the number of Filipinos on campus will
reach a point such that we will be able to put on
a bigger, better production."
For the present time, Kayumanggi invited
several different campus organizations to par
ticipate in Epic Quality. Along with Kayumang
gi. Talisman, Eskrima, Cardinal Calypso,
Hawaii Club, DvB, Swingtime and Everyday
People all made appearances.
The group also performed a collaboration
cha-cha dance with the adult Filipino commu
nity.
"We had a lot of fun with that," said fresh
man Victor Cruz, one of the PASU dancers.
Overall, the group expressed satisfaction
with the outcome of its first show. Enthusiasm
and excitement rippled through the crowd, and
participants said that the show exceeded expec
tations.
"It was simply amazing," Marzona said.
"The audience was great, and the performanc
es were spectacular."
"It was truly a show of Epic Quality,"
Sinocruz said, in a clear demonstration that
Kayumanggi had accomplished its original
goals.
