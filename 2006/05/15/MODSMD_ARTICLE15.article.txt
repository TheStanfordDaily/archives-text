## 'From farm to farm' seeks solar Zambia The 						Woods Institute for the Environment funds student sustainable energy projects and plans to expand with $30M gift 
### BEN EPPLER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A solar-powered computer complex for refugees in
Zambia. A "From Farm to Farm" initiative on sustainable
agriculture. A tutoring program that will help East Palo
Alto teens design a renewable-energy golf cart. Yes, big
things are going on in Encina Modular C.
These three projects are all designed by students and
funded by grants from the Woods Institute for the Environ
ment, located in the squat building on Arguello Way. Next
year it will relocate to its new home in the Environment and
Energy Building.
"One of the institute's most important roles on the cam
pus is to support and encourage students' interest in ad
dressing real-world environmental issues in a multidiscipli
nary way." Law School Prof. Barton H. "Buzz" Thompson
Jr., Woods Institute co-director, said in a statement. "The
student-project funding provides a terrific way to do that."
Several students have taken advantage of the available
cash, which is funding five projects this year.
"Once 1 discovered that [The Woods Institute] was eager
to engage in student work related to environmental projects
on and off campus. I was really eager to get involved," said
Seth Silverman, a sophomore who is designing his own
major."Sustainable and Just Communities."
Silverman is currently involved in the"From Farm to
Farm" program as well as a Woods-funded effort to recycle
used vegetable oil from dining facilities into biodiesel fuel
for campus vehicles.
"I think they're doing a really good job of actively reach
ing out to the student community, which is why more and
more students are becoming aware of what they do in their
programs," he added.
The Institute does not limit itself to undergraduate stu
dent participation. Nikhil Anand, a doctoral student in cul
tural and social anthropology (CASA), also received a
grant. He plans to coordinate a series of workshops to
"bring social science scholars of environmental governance
to Stanford."
This year, the Institute has approved funding up to
$10,000 for five student-initiated projects. Last year it
helped pay for internships in the Andaman Islands — off
the coast of Sri Lanka — where students helped tsunami
victims rebuild using sustainable methods.
Additionally, the Institute fronted $670,024 in two-year
grants for more than a dozen Stanford faculty as part of
the Institute's Environmental Venture Program, which
provides seed money for environmental and conservation
research.
In a multidisciplinary fashion,the Woods Institute works
to confront environmental challenges in a variety of fields.
"Environmental issues are complex — and often not just
a matter of science, but of culture, human behavior and eco
nomics," said Katharine Neal, the Institute's communica
tion's director."lt's not enough to tell farmers in Costa Rica
not to cut down trees for more farmland because the trees
provide an important environmental benefit. You have to
demonstrate clearly...that leaving the trees is the better eco
nomic option."
She added that a team led by Woods Institute Senior Fel
low Gretchen Daily had done just that by showing that trees
provide a habitat for bees, which pollinate coffee.
"More trees mean more bees, which means more and
healthier coffee beans and, ultimately, more profit for the
farmers," Neal concluded.
Renewable energy and assistance for refugees come to
gether in one of the Woods-funded student projects, involv
ing a solar-powered computer lab for Congolese refugees in
Mwange, Zambia.
"[Hie project] plans for the computer literacy programs
to be a long-term benefit to the Mwange community," said
John Mulrow, a sophomore who is heading the project as
part of his involvement with the refugee-aiding nonprofit
FORGE. "We expect that as a result of these programs,
many refugees will return to their home communities with
skills that allow them to get jobs and be leaders in their com
munities."
"Woods Institute for the Environment is funding a por
tion of our photovoltaic [solar] panel budget." added Jolie
Glaser, the other FORGE project leader. She expressed
gratitude toward generous private donors for their assis
tance, but added that further fundraising is necessary.
The Woods Institute, formerly known as the Stanford In
stitute for the Environment, was gifted $30 million by Stan
ford alumnus and trustee Ward W. Woods and his wife
Priscilla in February.The donation will enable the Institute
to expand its ability to fund environmental research and ac
tivism.
