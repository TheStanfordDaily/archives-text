## UCLA leaves water polo high and dry Cardinal fall 8-5 to Bruins in NCAA semifinal match, but beat Hawaii, 8-5, to claim third place 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
Entering their semifinal matchup
against UCLA in this weekend's NCAA
Championship at UC-Davis, Stanford
women's water polo knew they needed to
be on top of their game. Although they
owned a 2-1 season record against the Bru
ins coming into the game, the Cardinal
were well aware of the challenges the de
fending national champions presented.
It was the moment the Stanford women
had been waiting for all season long — a
chance not only to advance to the NCAA
Tournament's title match, but also an op
portunity to avenge their heartbreaking
loss to the Bruins in last year's champi
onship game. But an ineffective first-peri
od performance doomed the Cardinal in
the Saturday evening showdown, as the
Bruins claimed an 8-5 victory. Despite hav
ing their championship aspirations
dashed, the women rallied to defeat
Hawaii 8-5 yesterday to bring home third
place in the tournament.
The second-seeded Cardinal got their
weekend started by crushing seventh-seed
ed Marist, 17-2, in the first round of play.
Senior driver Scotti Shafer and sophomore
driver Megan May paced the Stanford on
slaught with four goals apiece, while junior
two-meter Christina Hewko followed with
a hat-trick of her own. Five other players
netted goals for the Cardinal, who effec
tively decided the outcome of the game by
building a 10-0 lead prior to the half.
The stage was set for Stanford and
UCLA to square off for a spot in the tour
nament's championship match. From the
outset, however, things didn't go the Cardi
nal's way. UCLA's Gabrielle Dominic gave
her squad the lead just 22 seconds into the

game, and less than two minutes later, sen
ior utility Thalia Munro found the left side
of the cage to extend the Bruins' lead to
two. UCLA tallied one more goal before
the first period concluded, and the Cardi
nal were forced to fight an uphill battle the
rest of the way.
"I was disappointed because I didn't
think we stuck to our game plan at all,"
Coach John Tanner said. "We didn't go with
what has worked for us, so UCLA didn't re
ally have to stop us."
Tanner also said the Bruins' perform
ance in the offensive end prevented the
Cardinal from finding counterattack scor
ing opportunities. While the Stanford
women were finally able to generate some
offensive production in the second period,
the key to the game likely lay in the differ
ence between the two teams' efforts in the
opening minutes of play.
"What it came down to was that they ex
ecuted and we didn't," junior goalie
Meridith McColl said.
The Cardinal battled back to within one
on the strength of a Shafer score from the
perimeter and power-play goals from jun
ior driver Katie Hansen and freshman driv
er Lolo Silver.
But that was as close as Stanford would
come. UCLA leading scorer Kelly Rulon
answered back with a cross-cage lob before
converting a four-meter penalty shot to re
build the Bruins' lead to 6-3.The two teams
battled evenly heading into the half, but the
Cardinal were unable to establish the mo
mentum needed to mount another serious
comeback charge.
The Bruin defense became even more
dominant in the second half of play, and
UCLA goalie Emily Feher almost seemed
to read Stanford's plays a half-sec
ond before they happened.
Playing for pride Sunday after
noon, the Cardinal showed their
grit. McColl, the unheralded anchor
of the Stanford defense, made ten
brilliant saves on the day, but it was
the team's three outgoing seniors
— Shafer, defender Laurel Cham
pion and two-meter Nancy El-
Sakkary — who fittingly led the
way in Stanford's victory over the
Rainbow Wahine.
Shafer recorded two goals on the
day, one on a fast break and the
other from eight meters out, to fin
ish as the Cardinal's leading scorer
for the weekend. El-Sakkary pro
vided a strong effort at set, high
lighting her afternoon with a beau
tiful skip-shot past three Hawaii de
fenders into the back of the cage.
Champion concluded her collegiate
career by playing the same stilling
defense that has come to define her
contribution to the team.
Tanner lamented the fact that
the Cardinal's coordinated offen
sive and defensive efforts versus
Hawaii had come a day late.
"It was sort of bittersweet to win
[today| when we had hoped to be
playing in the [championship
game]," he said. "But finishing with
a win is preferable to the alternative
— it's just unfortunate we had it
clicking today and not last night."
With their Sunday win. the Car
dinal extended to nine their streak
of seasons in which they have fin
ished third or better. Rut that won't
be the standard the Stanford
women hold for themselves —as
they look ahead to their 2007 cam
paign, they know that they will be
satisfied with nothing less than the
NCAA title that has eluded them
since 2(X)2.
