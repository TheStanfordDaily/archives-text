# MEN'S TENNIS
## Quinnipiac, Cal cave to Cardinal Team advances to meet Duke in the Sweet 16 of NCAAs, held at Stanford on Saturday 
### BY CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As theTaube Family Tennis Center is set to
host the NCAA Championships from the
Round of 16 on, it would have been quite a
shame had Stanford men's tennis missed the
opportunity to compete. However, the Cardi
nal eliminated that possibility this weekend,
handily defeating Quinnipiac and California.
4-0, to reach the Sweet 16.
Sunday's contest against California had it
all â€” a crowd-pleasing matchup, top-quality
play and pride on the line. Having already
beaten Cal twice in the regular season, Stan
ford was not about to take a loss to the Bears,

especially not at home and especially not in
the second round of NCAAs. And so the No.
13 Cardinal (17-3) sent the No. 20 Golden
Bears (16-7) packing yesterday before the
cross-Bay rivals could even jump on the
scoreboard.
To say that Stanford was pumped for the
match would be an understatement. The Card
hit the court for doubles on a high and never
looked back.
Especially impressive were senior Jon
Wong and junior James Wan at the third dou
bles position. Having lost to Lennart Maack
and Dean Wallace in April at Berkeley, the
duo never let their opponents in the match
this time. Keeping up their aggressive play
throughout, the pair was the first to finish with
an 8-0 victory.
"They're a good team," Wong said. "We
wanted a little revenge. Last time they
played well, but [on Sunday] we definitely
stepped it up."

On Court 2, freshmen Matt Bruch and
Blake Muller started off even with their Cal
counterparts, but soon jumped to a 6-2 lead.
Eventually the freshmen clinched the doubles
point for Stanford with their 8-4 win, halting
play on Court 1. where No. 16 senior KC
Corkery and junior James Pade trailed 4-7.
"It's the NCAA Tournament," Wong said.
"It could be our last match of the season at
any point, so you've got to go out playing like
it. The doubles point is just one point, but it's
really important because it sets the tone of the
match. We wanted to go out there from the
first point and get really fired up,"
After the doubles, the Card hit the court
for singles, ready to grab the three points they
needed to clinch the win over the Bears. While
it was the top of the lineup that got off to a
quick and dominant start, the second half of
the lineup slowly eased their way into the
