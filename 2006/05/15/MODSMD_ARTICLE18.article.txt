# MEN'S TENNIS
## Quinnipiac, Cal cave to Cardinal Team advances to meet Duke in the Sweet 16 of NCAAs, held at Stanford on Saturday 
### BY CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As theTaube Family Tennis Center is set to
host the NCAA Championships from the
Round of 16 on, it would have been quite a
shame had Stanford men's tennis missed the
opportunity to compete. However, the Cardi
nal eliminated that possibility this weekend,
handily defeating Quinnipiac and California.
4-0, to reach the Sweet 16.
Sunday's contest against California had it
all — a crowd-pleasing matchup, top-quality
play and pride on the line. Having already
beaten Cal twice in the regular season, Stan
ford was not about to take a loss to the Bears,

especially not at home and especially not in
the second round of NCAAs. And so the No.
13 Cardinal (17-3) sent the No. 20 Golden
Bears (16-7) packing yesterday before the
cross-Bay rivals could even jump on the
scoreboard.
To say that Stanford was pumped for the
match would be an understatement. The Card
hit the court for doubles on a high and never
looked back.
Especially impressive were senior Jon
Wong and junior James Wan at the third dou
bles position. Having lost to Lennart Maack
and Dean Wallace in April at Berkeley, the
duo never let their opponents in the match
this time. Keeping up their aggressive play
throughout, the pair was the first to finish with
an 8-0 victory.
"They're a good team," Wong said. "We
wanted a little revenge. Last time they
played well, but [on Sunday] we definitely
stepped it up."

On Court 2, freshmen Matt Bruch and
Blake Muller started off even with their Cal
counterparts, but soon jumped to a 6-2 lead.
Eventually the freshmen clinched the doubles
point for Stanford with their 8-4 win, halting
play on Court 1. where No. 16 senior KC
Corkery and junior James Pade trailed 4-7.
"It's the NCAA Tournament," Wong said.
"It could be our last match of the season at
any point, so you've got to go out playing like
it. The doubles point is just one point, but it's
really important because it sets the tone of the
match. We wanted to go out there from the
first point and get really fired up,"
After the doubles, the Card hit the court
for singles, ready to grab the three points they
needed to clinch the win over the Bears. While
it was the top of the lineup that got off to a
quick and dominant start, the second half of
the lineup slowly eased their way into the

match and eventually stuck it to
their opponents.

At the top three singles posi
tions, No. 25 Corkery, No. 16 Bruch
and Pade got off to identical 3-1
leads over their opponents. Howev
er, at the other half of the lineup.
Wan and Muller both found them
selves down 0-3 and sophomore
Phil Kao remained on serve at the
final singles spot. The top three sin
gles positions finished off their re
spective first sets, with each player
giving up no more than three
games. Kao followed suit, claiming
the first set 6-2.
Despite being down 0-3 and then
1-4, Muller came back to win the
next five games to claim the first set,
6-4. After lots of lengthy rallies. Wan
also started to ease his way into the
first set, winning two games in a row
to trim his opponent's lead to 2-3.
Once Bruch had the first set
under his belt, he rolled with the mo
mentum and blanked No. 89 Tyler
Browne in the second set to give
Stanford the 2-0 lead.
In the remaining matches, some
of the second sets appeared a little
tighter, but Kao put the crowd at
ease with his aggressive forehands
— and eventual victory. Despite
missing one opportunity on a match
point in the previous game, Kao hit a
big serve at 5-4, and Wallace's long
return gave Stanford its third point.
"1 changed up my serve three
days ago, so 1 was serving well,"

Kao said.
In addition to his serve, Kao at
tributed some of his success to his
support.
"All of my buddies came out and
were cheering me on, and I was real
ly getting into the match," he said."lt
was great."
Now it was only a matter of who
would win the clinching match for
the Card.
Muller and Pade were neck and
neck at the finish line, and Muller
even had a matchpoint at 5-3. How
ever, it was Pade that eventually
sealed Stanford's victory at the third
singles position with his 6-2,6-4 win.
Corkery trailed 3-4 in the second
and Wan had pulled even at 5-all in
the first.
Although Saturday's match with
Quinnipiac was a 4-0 victory as well,
the disparity between the opponents
was much more apparent than in
Sunday's match. The Cardinal's
dominance over the Bobcats was re
flected in the scoreboard, and Satur
day's match was a combination of a
massacre and a race to see who could
finish his match first.
While Pade, Bruch and Wan were
the first players to complete their
singles matches, the three remaining
courts were looking to score similar
wins as well. The Bobcats were only
able to earn one game per singles
match.
The Cardinal will now take on
fourth-seeded Duke Saturday at 3
p.m.
"Duke's a pretty strong team,"
Kao said. "But it's definitely a lot
better at home. (These are] our
courts, our house — we know how
these courts play."

Especially impressive were senior Jon
Wong and junior James Wan at the third dou
bles position. Having lost to Lennart Maack
and Dean Wallace in April at Berkeley, the
duo never let their opponents in the match
this time. Keeping up their aggressive play
throughout, the pair was the first to finish with
an 8-0 victory.
"They're a good team," Wong said. "We
wanted a little revenge. Last time they
played well, but [on Sunday] we definitely
stepped it up."

On Court 2, freshmen Matt Bruch and
Blake Muller started off even with their Cal
counterparts, but soon jumped to a 6-2 lead.
Eventually the freshmen clinched the doubles
point for Stanford with their 8-4 win, halting
play on Court 1. where No. 16 senior KC
Corkery and junior James Pade trailed 4-7.
"It's the NCAA Tournament," Wong said.
"It could be our last match of the season at
any point, so you've got to go out playing like
it. The doubles point is just one point, but it's
really important because it sets the tone of the
match. We wanted to go out there from the
first point and get really fired up,"
After the doubles, the Card hit the court
for singles, ready to grab the three points they
needed to clinch the win over the Bears. While
it was the top of the lineup that got off to a
quick and dominant start, the second half of
the lineup slowly eased their way into the

match and eventually stuck it to
their opponents.

At the top three singles posi
tions, No. 25 Corkery, No. 16 Bruch
and Pade got off to identical 3-1
leads over their opponents. Howev
er, at the other half of the lineup.
Wan and Muller both found them
selves down 0-3 and sophomore
Phil Kao remained on serve at the
final singles spot. The top three sin
gles positions finished off their re
spective first sets, with each player
giving up no more than three
games. Kao followed suit, claiming
the first set 6-2.
Despite being down 0-3 and then
1-4, Muller came back to win the
next five games to claim the first set,
6-4. After lots of lengthy rallies. Wan
also started to ease his way into the
first set, winning two games in a row
to trim his opponent's lead to 2-3.
Once Bruch had the first set
under his belt, he rolled with the mo
mentum and blanked No. 89 Tyler
Browne in the second set to give
Stanford the 2-0 lead.
In the remaining matches, some
of the second sets appeared a little
tighter, but Kao put the crowd at
ease with his aggressive forehands
— and eventual victory. Despite
missing one opportunity on a match
point in the previous game, Kao hit a
big serve at 5-4, and Wallace's long
return gave Stanford its third point.
"1 changed up my serve three
days ago, so 1 was serving well,"

Kao said.
In addition to his serve, Kao at
tributed some of his success to his
support.
"All of my buddies came out and
were cheering me on, and I was real

was great."
Now it was only a matter of who
would win the clinching match for
the Card.
Muller and Pade were neck and
neck at the finish line, and Muller
even had a matchpoint at 5-3. How
ever, it was Pade that eventually
sealed Stanford's victory at the third
singles position with his 6-2,6-4 win.
Corkery trailed 3-4 in the second
and Wan had pulled even at 5-all in
the first.
Although Saturday's match with
Quinnipiac was a 4-0 victory as well,
the disparity between the opponents
was much more apparent than in
Sunday's match. The Cardinal's
dominance over the Bobcats was re
flected in the scoreboard, and Satur
day's match was a combination of a
massacre and a race to see who could
finish his match first.
While Pade, Bruch and Wan were
the first players to complete their
singles matches, the three remaining
courts were looking to score similar
wins as well. The Bobcats were only
able to earn one game per singles
match.
The Cardinal will now take on
fourth-seeded Duke Saturday at 3
p.m.
"Duke's a pretty strong team,"
Kao said. "But it's definitely a lot
better at home. (These are] our
courts, our house — we know how
these courts play."
