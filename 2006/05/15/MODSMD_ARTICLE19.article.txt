## Six straight victories: baseball on the upswing Team takes all three games in weekend's series at Washington 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Stanford finally pulled itself out of the Pac-10
cellar with a solid performance at Washington
this past weekend. The Cardinal swept the
Huskies in three games as pitching and offense fi
nally came together to move Stanford up four
spots into fifth place in the conference.
Friday: Stanford 5, Washington 0
Heading into the three-game road trip, play
ers said that while their backs were up against the
wall, their momentum and confidence had been
building over the last three weeks. Their confi
dence got a tremendous push on Friday night
with a 5-0 win over Washington pitcher Tim
Lincecum (Pac-10 record holder in strikeouts).

who was denied his 12th win.
Senior righthander Greg Reynolds (6-3,3.17
ERA) bested Lincecum in the pitchers' duel.
Like in his last two starts against Arizona State
and California, Reynolds went nine innings, but
this time he spread eight hits and struck out nine
to shutout the Huskies (32-23,9-12).
ITie Cardinal offense held up its end of the
bargain. Senior shortstop Chris Minaker and
sophomore rightfielder Michael Taylor had two
hits each, while Minaker added two runs and Tay
lor two RBls.
Both had crucial singles in the fifth, when
Stanford scored three runs to go ahead 4-0. Left
fielder Jim Rapoport and centerfielder Ryan
Seawell notched back-to-back hits. One out later,
Minaker singled and Taylor's RBI hit followed.
Stanford (27-21,10-11) added one more in the in
ning with a sacrifice fly.
Washington did pose a few threats, putting
runners on second and third with two out in the

fifth, but a Reynolds strikeout ended
the inning. Lincecum (11-3) pitched
seven innings, but the Cardinal
roughed him up for 10 hits and four
runs.
Saturday: Stanford 14, Washington 6
Saturday, the Cardinal offense
took the spotlight. Stanford scored
nine runs in the top of the second,
with six alone coming off of home
runs. Minaker, playing in his home
state, and senior Chris Lewis, playing
where he was raised as a child, both
had three-run round-trippers in the
frame.
At first, it looked like Stanford
would be climbing uphill for the rest
of the game, as the Huskies took a 4-0
lead in the first. Matt Lane had a
three-run home run and a sacrifice tly
also brought in a run. Stanford starter
Matt Leva had a rocky first inning,
and got out of a bases-loaded jam
with a strikeout.
Lewis got the rally started with a
double to centerfield. I Tie Cardinal
played small ball, took a couple of
walks and used a Husky fielding error
to their advantage to pull within 4-3.
Ilien, Minaker's home run to right
field put Stanford ahead 6-4 ,and
I .ewis' homer to leftfield made it 9-4.
Washington starter Kyle Parker
was pulled out as the Cardinal were
loading the bases for I.ewis. He fin
ished with six hits, eight runs and
three walks. Nolan Gallagher got the
win in relief for Stanford, scattering
nine hits over seven innings for only
one run.
Five Cardinal had multi-hit games
— Seawell went 3-for-5, Minaker 3-
for-6 with four RBI and Lewis was 2-
for-5 with three RBI.

Lincecum (Pac-10 record holder in strikeouts).

who was denied his 12th win.
Senior righthander Greg Reynolds (6-3,3.17
ERA) bested Lincecum in the pitchers' duel.
Like in his last two starts against Arizona State
and California, Reynolds went nine innings, but
this time he spread eight hits and struck out nine
to shutout the Huskies (32-23,9-12).
ITie Cardinal offense held up its end of the
bargain. Senior shortstop Chris Minaker and
sophomore rightfielder Michael Taylor had two
hits each, while Minaker added two runs and Tay
lor two RBls.

Stanford scored three runs to go ahead 4-0. Left

runs.
Saturday: Stanford 14, Washington 6
Saturday, the Cardinal offense
took the spotlight. Stanford scored
nine runs in the top of the second,
with six alone coming off of home
runs. Minaker, playing in his home
state, and senior Chris Lewis, playing
where he was raised as a child, both
had three-run round-trippers in the
frame.
At first, it looked like Stanford
would be climbing uphill for the rest
of the game, as the Huskies took a 4-0
lead in the first. Matt Lane had a
three-run home run and a sacrifice tly
also brought in a run. Stanford starter
Matt Leva had a rocky first inning,
and got out of a bases-loaded jam
with a strikeout.
Lewis got the rally started with a
double to centerfield. I Tie Cardinal
played small ball, took a couple of
walks and used a Husky fielding error
to their advantage to pull within 4-3.
Ilien, Minaker's home run to right
field put Stanford ahead 6-4 ,and
I .ewis' homer to leftfield made it 9-4.
Washington starter Kyle Parker
was pulled out as the Cardinal were
loading the bases for I.ewis. He fin
ished with six hits, eight runs and
three walks. Nolan Gallagher got the
win in relief for Stanford, scattering
nine hits over seven innings for only
one run.
Five Cardinal had multi-hit games
