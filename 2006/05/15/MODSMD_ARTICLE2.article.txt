# Powwow HITS CAMPUS
## Eucalyptus Grove hosts largest student-run event in the nation to celebrate Native American heritage 
### CASSIE HARVEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This weekend. Eucalyptus Grove
became a sea of sound and color as
tens of thousands flocked to take part
in the 35th annual Stanford Powwow, a
three-day celebration of Native Amer
ican history and culture sponsored by
the Stanford American Indian Organi
zation (S AIO). Featuring music, dance
and art from hundreds of Native
American tribes, the Powwow is the
largest student-run event of this type
in the nation.
Planning the event is a tedious un
dertaking, said Spring Golden, a junior
volunteer chair on the planning com
mittee. While organizing each pow
wow begins almost directly after the
previous year's event ends. Golden be
lieves the time commitment and sacri
fice are well worth it.
"It's an incredible time where
everyone can gather as a community
and share their culture," Golden said.
"I'm not Native American myself, I'm
actually Native Hawaiian. But this
event is so welcoming, and it makes me
want to do more for my culture."
Golden's sentiments were echoed
by a number of non-Native American
attendees, who reveled in the rich his
tory and culture on display. Michael
Jobs, who has attended the Stanford
Powwow for the past five years, said he
fell in love with the event immediately.
"I came here today to honor the
Native American people," Jobs said."l
am of European ancestry, but this
event makes me wish 1 were Native
American. What do we [of European
ancestry] have? We've lost all tradi
tion. To come here and see the intri
cate Native American regalia, to real
ize the colors and history in it. is to feel
at least in spirit part of an age-old tra
dition."
Active encouragement of partici
pants from all backgrounds lends to
the event's enormous popularity. To
date, the Stanford Powwow is by far
the best-attended multicultural event
hosted on campus each year.
For the second year, the event's
programmers chose the theme "Em
powerment through Education." Ac

cording to Edward Morillo, a Chu
mash/Mutsun Indian, the theme was
meant to honor the work of current
and past Stanford students who
helped plan the event as well as to "ed
ucate, and thus empower" participants
who know little about Native Ameri
cans.
"The Native American community
is small, but we're very inclusive," Mo
rillo said. "For us, this is a spiritual ex
perience, a celebration of our family
and culture. At the same time, we want
to share it with others. We want to ed
ucate others about things they proba
bly didn't read in history books."
The Powwow kicked-off Friday
night and ended late Sunday after
noon, boasting a non-stop, wide-rang
ing itinerary. Dance competitions
were held throughout the weekend. A
panel of judges awarded cash prizes to
the best performers in a variety of jun
ior, women's and men's dance cate
gories. Singing and drum competitions
were also held, while old traditions
such as the Fun Run and the wearing
of shawls were revived.
The weekend also provided ample
opportunities for the hungry and
shopping-prone. Food booths dotted
the Grove, offering up everything
from lemonade to pad thai. Over 100
tented booths were filled staffed ven
dors selling wares such as woven rugs
and handcrafted jewelry.
"Vendors view the Stanford Pow
wow as a very successful venue to sell
wares," said Jesse Salcedo, who sells
tipi materials. "For a lot of vendors, this
is their livelihood. They come from all
over the U.S. to be here."
For some, this event marked the
start of a fun-filled summer powwow
season:
"I've been coming to the Stanford
Powwow for 23 years. This is the begin
ning of powwow season for me," said
Joe Corvan,as he smoked a pipe under
a Eucalyptus tree. "I kind of hop
scotch from one to the next during the
summer. It's the best way to reconnect
with old acquaintances and enter into
the spirit of brotherhood and cama
raderie. But this powwow is premiere
of all powwows, as far as I'm con
cerned."
