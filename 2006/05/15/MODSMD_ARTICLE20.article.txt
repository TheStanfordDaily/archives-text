## Card beat Washington, No. 1 UCLA to end regular season 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
Stanford softball's senior class wanted to
make their last homestand a weekend to re
member. And they did.
The No. 9 Cardinal (38-15, 10-11 Pac-10)
finished the conference season on a high note,
sweeping the weekend with a victory over No.
17 Washington (32-23,6-15) and two in a row
over top-ranked UCLA (43-7,15-5).
"It was amazing," senior Megan Bordelon
said. "We needed to do everything we could
to win and we did. Every inning, we were on
top of them and we just kept pushing and

pushing."
None of the victories came easy for the
Cardinal, who won each by only a single run,
but the results were welcome for a team that
has been struggling with consistency lately.
"The team has gone through a lot of ups on
and then some downs recently, but we're ready
to go when it counts," senior pitcher Laura
Severson said.
"You want to get hot at the right time and
right now we're playing well and going into
the postseason on a roll," Coach John Rittman
said. "We just need to make sure to keep that
going. We won some games ugly
this weekend, hut we'll take an ugly
win over a pretty loss any day."
Stanford came from behind to
beat Washington 3-2 on Thursday,
but beat UCLA without ever trail
ing, 3-2 Saturday and 5-4 Sunday.
Thursday: Stanford 3, Washington 2
Against Washington, Senior
shortstop Lauren Lappin scored
the game-winning run when Wash
ington's pitcher was called for an il
legal pitch in the bottom of the
fifth.
Washington put a run on the
board in the first inning and ex
tended its lead to 2-0 in the top of
the fourth.
But freshman pitcher Missy
Penna kept the Cardinal in the
game with a solo blast in the bot
tom of the fourth and, in the bot
tom of the fifth, Lappin stretched a
double into a triple and brought
home junior leftfielder Jackie
Rinehart to tie the game, setting
the stage for her game-winning run.
Penna and Lappin each went 1 -
for-2 with an RBI and a run scored
and Rinehart also notched a hit and
a run.
In her six innings in the circle,
Penna struck out six and gave up six
hits and two runs, boosting her
record in her first season on the
Farm to 20- 1 ).
Friday: Stanford 3, UCLA 2
The Cardinal carried the mo
mentum into Friday's contest and a
clutch catch at the fence sealed the
3-2 win over the No. 1 Bruins.
Stanford took the lead for good
with back-to-back doubles in the
sixth. Morris smacked the ball to
the leftfield fence for a stand-up
double and came home on Rine
hart's double to center. The throw
to home was in-time but off-target
and Morris slid around the catcher
to put Stanford ahead 3-2.
Stanford came out swinging in
the bottom of the first inning. After
Morris walked to lead off and then
stole second, freshman third base
man Maddy Coon knocked a single
to no man's land in shallow left
center to bring Morris home. Stan
ford went on to load the bases, but
stranded all three runners at the
end of the inning.
The Cardinal made it two in the
bottom of the third when Penna hit
a sacrifice fly to left field to score
Lappin. Once again the Cardinal
loaded the bases, but once again
they stranded all three.
UCLA finally broke through in
the fourth inning, notching a pair of
runs to tie the game. But the Bruins
could score no more, so Morris'
score would prove the game-win
ner.
Morris hit 2-for-3 in the game
with two runs scored. Rinehart
notched two hits to go with her RBI
and Penna and Coon each hit 1-for
-2 with an RBI. Sophomore hurler
Becky McCullough improved to
10-5 on the season, pitching the full
seven innings and notching four
strikeouts.
Sunday: Stanford 5, UCLA 4
In the last home game of their
Stanford careers, the seniors led the
Cardinal to the 5-4 win to take the
season series from the Bruins.
Morris and L-appin each scored
a run and Severson stayed perfect
in the circle in the win.
The Cardinal scoring started in

Michelle Smith sent a line drive
down the leftfield line for a two-
RBI double, plating Rinehart and
Lappin.
Stanford pushed its lead to three
in the second inning when Rinehart
notched an RBI single to bring
home Morris from third. Morris got
on base with a hit to deep left-cen
ter and reached third on an error in
the outfield-the first of six total er
rors in the game. •
The Bruins came roaring back in
the third inning, taking advantage
of consecutive Cardinal errors to
notch three runs and tie the game.
The tie did not last long, howev
er, as the Cardinal scored once
again in the third. Senior pinch run
ner Shoney Hixson stole second
base, advanced to third on a throw
ing error by UCLA catcher Emily
Zaplatosch — her first error in
nearly three years — and then
came home on a sacrifice fly by
Smith.
Stanford tallied one more run in
the bottom of the fourth inning
when Aggabao took advantage of a
wild pitch by UCLA ace Anjelica
Selden to hustle home from third
base.
The Cardinal saw their two-run
lead threatened in the next inning
when the Bruins, aided by two
more Stanford errors, loaded the
bases with only one out. UCLA
scored one on a sacrifice fly, but the
Cardinal defense got the last out
before the Bruins could tie.
Neither team would move a run
ner past first base for the rest of the
game, and the Cardinal celebrated
their second straight upset of the
nation's top team.
Smith led the way at the plate
for Stanford with 1-for-2 hitting
and three RBI. Morris and Lappin
each notched a hit and a run and
Aggabao went 2-for-3 with a run as
well.
Severson (8-0) pitched six com
plete innings with no strikeouts but
no earned runs either — all four
Bruins scores came off fielding er
rors.
"Obviously, a lot of emotion
went into it. but the bottom line was
that we needed to win for the post
season," Severson said. "To sweep
the whole weekend was great for
our team. The win was obviously
very symbolic, beating UCLA."
Despite the two losses this
weekend. UCLA held onto their
top seed when the NCAA bracket
was announced Sunday. The Cardi
nal received the 12th seed overall
and will start play in the Fresno Re
gional with Tulsa. Cal State Fuller
ton and host Fresno State Friday.
"There is a lot of buildup to the
selection, but once the selection
show is over, you have to go play
ball," Rittman said. "If you don't

Smith led the way at the plate
for Stanford with 1-for-2 hitting
and three RBI. Morris and Lappin
each notched a hit and a run and
Aggabao went 2-for-3 with a run as
well.
Severson (8-0) pitched six com
plete innings with no strikeouts but
no earned runs either — all four
Bruins scores came off fielding er
rors.
"Obviously, a lot of emotion
went into it. but the bottom line was
that we needed to win for the post
season," Severson said. "To sweep
the whole weekend was great for
our team. The win was obviously
very symbolic, beating UCLA."
Despite the two losses this
weekend. UCLA held onto their
top seed when the NCAA bracket
was announced Sunday. The Cardi
nal received the 12th seed overall
and will start play in the Fresno Re
gional with Tulsa. Cal State Fuller
ton and host Fresno State Friday.
"There is a lot of buildup to the
selection, but once the selection
show is over, you have to go play
ball," Rittman said. "If you don't
bring your A-game now, you're
going home."
Stanford softball's senior class wanted to
make their last homestand a weekend to re
member. And they did.
The No. 9 Cardinal (38-15, 10-11 Pac-10)
finished the conference season on a high note,
sweeping the weekend with a victory over No.
17 Washington (32-23,6-15) and two in a row
over top-ranked UCLA (43-7,15-5).
"It was amazing," senior Megan Bordelon
said. "We needed to do everything we could
to win and we did. Every inning, we were on
top of them and we just kept pushing and

pushing."
None of the victories came easy for the
Cardinal, who won each by only a single run,
but the results were welcome for a team that
has been struggling with consistency lately.
"The team has gone through a lot of ups on
and then some downs recently, but we're ready
to go when it counts," senior pitcher Laura
Severson said.
"You want to get hot at the right time and
right now we're playing well and going into
the postseason on a roll," Coach John Rittman
said. "We just need to make sure to keep that
going. We won some games ugly
this weekend, hut we'll take an ugly
win over a pretty loss any day."
Stanford came from behind to
beat Washington 3-2 on Thursday,
but beat UCLA without ever trail
ing, 3-2 Saturday and 5-4 Sunday.

Against Washington, Senior

tended its lead to 2-0 in the top of
the fourth.

The Cardinal carried the mo

Stanford took the lead for good
with back-to-back doubles in the
sixth. Morris smacked the ball to

to home was in-time but off-target
and Morris slid around the catcher
to put Stanford ahead 3-2.
Stanford came out swinging in
the bottom of the first inning. After
Morris walked to lead off and then
stole second, freshman third base
man Maddy Coon knocked a single
to no man's land in shallow left
center to bring Morris home. Stan
ford went on to load the bases, but
stranded all three runners at the
end of the inning.
The Cardinal made it two in the

Lappin. Once again the Cardinal
loaded the bases, but once again
they stranded all three.

notched two hits to go with her RBI
and Penna and Coon each hit 1-for
-2 with an RBI. Sophomore hurler
