## 'Worst role models' showdown 
### 
In the past few years, we've seen
some fantastic examples of men
behaving badly in the sports
realm. While many athletes main
tain that they are not to be consid
ered role models simply because of
their physical prowess, a select few
who have gone above and beyond
the call of duty to make sure that
parents tell their children not to be
like them.
Some examples are a team effort:
the Minnesota Vikings and the Love
Boat, the University of Miami's Sev
enth Floor Crew, the Duke Lacrosti
tute (or Lacostitute) Scandal
(though the rape allegations look in
creasingly shaky, it's nonetheless a
bad situation).
However, since it's a bit difficult
for a single person to emulate a
whole team, in the interest of this
column we'll be focusing on the
biggest individual "do as I say, not as
they do" losers in each of the four
major sports, with the ultimate ass
hole being decided in a battle royale.
First, representing the NHL, hit
man Todd Bertuzzi. You'll have to
go back two seasons to remember
this incident (as with any incident in
the NHL... badaboom!). Bertuzzi,
an All-Star forward for the Vancou
ver Canucks, took it upon himself to
suckerpunch Colorado Avalanche
center Steve Moore. The catch?
Bertuzzi's punch landed on the back
of Moore's neck, breaking it, lead
ing to a concussion and other minor
injuries.
Next, representing the NFL, Ter
rell "it's never my fault" Owens.
Owens has a colorful history of
clashes with opponents, teammates
and management. Owens has pre
tended to dump on the star in the
middle of Texas Stadium, and called
out former teammates Jeff Garcia as
gay and Donovan McNabb as re
sponsible for the Eagles losing the
Superbowl. Last season, after being
unable to settle a contract dispute on
a year-old contract. Owens sat out
the season for the Eagles (partly at
the behest of the Eagles).
Honorable Mention: Randy
Moss, the Vick Family — Marcus
and Ron Mexico
From the NBA (and a disputed
call, I'm sure), we're going with
Kobe Bryant. A quick note on off
court activities: Even if the charges
are dropped, you were clearly still
there, and in an inappropriate situa
tion. Lucky for Bryant, a rock the
size of a golf ball heals all marital ills.
Secondly, trying to deflect the blame
by insinuating that all players (in
cluding your teammate Shaquille
O'Neal) do it does not absolve your
sin. In fact, it makes you worse.
Moving back to basketball. Kobe's
massive ego was one of the biggest
contributing factors to the break-up
of one the dynasties of the last
decade. Yes, Jerry Bus is partially to
blame, and perhaps Shaq as well —
but in the end, the Lakers were left
without Phil Jackson, Shaq or a play
off seed. Hope you enjoy that scor
ing title.
Honorable Mention: Latrell
Sprewell, Shawn Kemp, Stephon
Marbury
Finally, MLB. Here's where I'm
sure to get the most hate mail, but
Barry Bonds is my hands-down win
ner. I've haven't seen a circus this big
since PT Barnum. The man ignores
teammates, cheats on his wife, uses
steroids, skips every third game now
that he can't, lies to grand juries and
has the cajones to host a reality show
depicting his pursuit of the most hal
lowed record in sports. Yeah, I watch
it, but it only infuriates me more as 1
think about such a scumbag taking
the title from a wonderful ambassa
dor of baseball like Hank Aaron.
Don't get me wrong — he's good,
great, legendary even. But then
again, you don't get hated if you're a
nobody.
Honorable Mention: Albert Belle
and, to reach way back, Ty Cobb
On to the semi-finals. Bertuzzi v.
Owens, it's no contest. Bertuzzi was
sorry immediately following his iso
lated incident. He apologized pro
fusely for his actions, bawling like a
baby on national TV. You ever seen
an asshole cry? Todd's ultimately
not a bad guy. just a man who made
a very bad decision. Owens, on the
other hand, has a rap sheet reaching
epic proportions. He's pissed off the
Bay Area, Philadelphia and Dallas,
which consequently now owns him.
Get ready for another b00m...
Kobe v. Barry is a bit tougher, but
you gotta go with Barry as the win
ner here. Kobe's gotten back to the
playoffs, and done quite well when
he incorporates his teammates. He's
made up with Phil Jackson, and
while he and Shaq may never see
eye-to-eye, they've at least put it be
hind them. Barry, on the other hand,
looks worse than ever. The wear
and-tear is clearly showing, and he's
not even hitting well.The Giants are
languishing in the basement, and
there are rumors in the clubhouse
that the circus is driving his team
mates crazy. He's a detriment all
around right now.
The final showdown: Barry vs.
Terrell. In a tight race, you gotta go
T.O. as the official Biggest Asshole
in Sports. At least Barry still has the
unwavering and ignorant support of
his hometown fans. T.O has left a
trail of destruction. Barry continues
to play (at least eight innings every
two of three games), while T.O. is
just wasting everyone's time. The
icing on the cake?
"I left a lot, and 1 mean a lot, of
touchdowns on the field over the
past two to three years." - Terrell
Owens
Way to be.T.O., way to be.

the season for the Eagles (partly at
the behest of the Eagles).
Honorable Mention: Randy
Moss, the Vick Family — Marcus
and Ron Mexico
From the NBA (and a disputed
call, I'm sure), we're going with
Kobe Bryant. A quick note on off
court activities: Even if the charges
are dropped, you were clearly still
there, and in an inappropriate situa
tion. Lucky for Bryant, a rock the
size of a golf ball heals all marital ills.
Secondly, trying to deflect the blame
by insinuating that all players (in
cluding your teammate Shaquille
O'Neal) do it does not absolve your
sin. In fact, it makes you worse.
Moving back to basketball. Kobe's
massive ego was one of the biggest
contributing factors to the break-up
of one the dynasties of the last
decade. Yes, Jerry Bus is partially to
blame, and perhaps Shaq as well —
but in the end, the Lakers were left
without Phil Jackson, Shaq or a play
off seed. Hope you enjoy that scor
ing title.
Honorable Mention: Latrell
Sprewell, Shawn Kemp, Stephon
Marbury
Finally, MLB. Here's where I'm
sure to get the most hate mail, but
Barry Bonds is my hands-down win
ner. I've haven't seen a circus this big
since PT Barnum. The man ignores
teammates, cheats on his wife, uses
steroids, skips every third game now
that he can't, lies to grand juries and
has the cajones to host a reality show
depicting his pursuit of the most hal
lowed record in sports. Yeah, I watch
it, but it only infuriates me more as 1
think about such a scumbag taking
the title from a wonderful ambassa
dor of baseball like Hank Aaron.
Don't get me wrong — he's good,
great, legendary even. But then
again, you don't get hated if you're a
nobody.
Honorable Mention: Albert Belle
and, to reach way back, Ty Cobb
On to the semi-finals. Bertuzzi v.
Owens, it's no contest. Bertuzzi was
sorry immediately following his iso
lated incident. He apologized pro
fusely for his actions, bawling like a
baby on national TV. You ever seen
an asshole cry? Todd's ultimately
not a bad guy. just a man who made
a very bad decision. Owens, on the
other hand, has a rap sheet reaching
epic proportions. He's pissed off the
Bay Area, Philadelphia and Dallas,
which consequently now owns him.
Get ready for another b00m...
Kobe v. Barry is a bit tougher, but
you gotta go with Barry as the win
ner here. Kobe's gotten back to the
playoffs, and done quite well when
he incorporates his teammates. He's
made up with Phil Jackson, and
while he and Shaq may never see
eye-to-eye, they've at least put it be
hind them. Barry, on the other hand,
looks worse than ever. The wear
and-tear is clearly showing, and he's
not even hitting well.The Giants are
languishing in the basement, and
there are rumors in the clubhouse
that the circus is driving his team
mates crazy. He's a detriment all
around right now.
The final showdown: Barry vs.
Terrell. In a tight race, you gotta go
T.O. as the official Biggest Asshole
in Sports. At least Barry still has the
unwavering and ignorant support of
his hometown fans. T.O has left a
trail of destruction. Barry continues
to play (at least eight innings every
two of three games), while T.O. is
just wasting everyone's time. The
icing on the cake?
"I left a lot, and 1 mean a lot, of
touchdowns on the field over the
past two to three years." - Terrell
Owens
Way to be.T.O., way to be.

Tell senior Andrew Rogers why he's
the biggest asshole of the Daily's
sports columnists at arogers@stan
ford.edu.
