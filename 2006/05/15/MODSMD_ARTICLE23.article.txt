# WOMEN'S TENNIS
## Card eliminate Quinnipiac, Arizona 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
To nobody's surprise, undefeated Stan
ford women's tennis easily dispatched both
Quinnipiac and No. 38 Arizona in the NCAA
first and second rounds over the weekend.
Both matches were quickly won, 4-0, and ap
peared effortless for Stanford's players.
Friday's first-round match against Quin
nipiac (11-11) took only an hour and 39 min
utes total, a marked contrast to the protract
ed four-hour match between Brigham Young
(20-8) and Arizona (13-12) that took place
immediately prior. The length of that match,
which Arizona won 4-1 to send BYU back
home, delayed Stanford's start by an hour.
Sophomore Lejla Hodzic and freshman
Jessica Nguyen finished their doubles match
first, winning 8-0 on the third court. ITien
senior Amber Liu and sophomore Celia
Durkin clinched the doubles point with an 8
1 win on the second. Senior Alice Barnes'
and junior Anne Yelsey's first-court match
was then suspended — though they were
preparing to serve match point.
The singles matches also breezed by. At
the No. 4 position, Yelsey blanked Quinnipi
ac's Jackie Visinski,6-0,6-0, to finish first. Qn
the sixth court, Nguyen also blanked her op
ponent, Danielle Rodriguez, to finish next.
Barnes then secured the match with a 6-1.6-
0 victory over Tina Hoang on the second
court and play halted.
"I thought they were not a bad team,"
Barnes said."lt was a good first round match

for us. Everything went pretty much as
planned, and we just got the job done — nice
and uneventful."
Saturday's match, though about 20 min
utes longer than Friday's, was still brief as
Arizona quickly fell. The doubles point was
decided with an 8-1 win by Barnes and
Yelsey and an 8-4 win by Hodzic and
Nguyen.
Barnes was the first to finish her singles
match this time, with a 6-2,6-0 victory over
Stephanie Balzert at the No. 2 spot. Sopho
more Whitney Deason then beat Camelia
Todorova, 6-0,6-1 on court five, and Durkin
defeated Jessie Rochefort 6-1, 6-1 on court
six to seal the deal.
"Arizona is actually a very strong team,"
Barnes said. "Their record doesn't look that
good because they play in the Pac-10 and
have to play us twice, the LA schools twice,
Cal twice. But they are very good,so I'm real
ly pleased with how everyone responded. It's
nice when everyone who is left on court when
the match is decided and play is suspended is
also winning. It sets the tone within the team
pretty well. And another 10 minutes or so of
play and everyone would have won."
"I'm very happy with our performances
this weekend, both as far as how we're play
ing and how focused we are on what we need
to do this week," Coach Lele Forood said.
"We showed a very good Arizona team that
we are all business."
With the weekend's wins, the team ad
vances to the Round of 16, held Thursday at
Stanford.
