## First-round exit for Card Team falls to perennial powerhouse Northwestern in its first-ever NCAA tournament 
### ROHAN PURANIK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The chilly, cloudy Evanston sky
proved an apt background for the
final contest of the season for Stan
ford women's lacrosse. The Cardinal
lost 17-9 to top-ranked Northwest
ern yesterday in the first round of the
NCAA Championships.
After a Wildcat offensive on
slaught in the first half, Stanford re
bounded with great energy in the
second.
"We came here saying we were
going to play to the very end," senior
attack Megan Burker said. "1 was re
ally proud how our team pushed
them to the finish."
Stanford managed to score only
two goals in the first half in response
to Northwestern's seven. In the sec
ond half, the squad rallied to tally
seven, though Northwestern did add
another ten scores.
Sophomore attack Daphne Pat
terson and Burker each finished with
hat tricks for the Cardinal while sen
ior attack Sarah Bach, sophomore
midfield/attack Megan McClain and
junior attack Michelle DeChant
each scored a goal.
The game started with a speedy
goal from the Wildcats less than two
minutes into the game, but Patterson
quickly responded to knot the con
test at 1-all.
The Wildcats scored again, only
for Patterson to penetrate through
the strong Northwestern defense
and score another goal to tie the
game in the 22nd minute.
But then things fell apart for the
Cardinal as Northwestern strung to
gether a five-goal streak that all but
took the Card out of their first-ever
NCAA appearance.
The second half started more

smoothly, however, with Stanford
matching Northwestern's efforts for
the first 13 minutes.
But again the Stanford defense
could not stop the depth of the Wild
cats' offense. Led by Kristen Kjell
man and Sarah Albrecht, the Wild
cats tallied a six-goal streak.
The Cardinal attempted to sal
vage the half by producing a flurry of
goals in the last four minutes of the
match.
Burker scored two. both assisted
by junior midfield Liz Piselli, and
Bach and McClain scored their sin
gle goals from 3:40 to 0:13.
The Wildcats, defending NCAA
champions, netted the last goal of the
match to seal their spot in the second
round of the tournament.
Sophomore goalkeeper Laura
Shane provided an exceptional per
formance, as expected from 2005's
MPSF Goalkeeper of the Year.
Shane made 13 saves for the Cardi
nal, with six in the first half and seven
in the second.
Shane gained a reputation as one
of the top goalies in the country
with her stunning performance last
year as a freshman. Shane led the
Cardinal to a 13-5 season last year,
and a 12-6 season this year with a
berth in the NCAA Champi
onships.
Stanford improved its perform
ance slightly from its last game
against the Wildcats. The squad had
lost to Northwestern 19-8 earlier this
year, but managed to reduce the
deficit this time around.
The Cardinal also limited North
western's star attack, Sarah Al
brecht. Albrecht had netted seven
goals previously, but this time
around, Stanford held Albrecht to
four.
With players like junior midfield
Kristen Kjellman, a consensus first
team All-American, the Wildcats
have traditionally been a women's
lacrosse powerhouse.
Burker scored her 143 rd career
goal in the match, pulling her into
first in the Cardinal record books for
goals scored.
