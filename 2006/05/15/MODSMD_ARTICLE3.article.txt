## Draw's lucky number one stumped for best choice Three juniors, all abroad, receive number one, 680 and Jerry are their top choices 
### BY KAITLIN WOOD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Draw has struck fear into the
hearts of generations of Stanford stu
dents for years, and this spring was no
different. But for a lucky trio of rising
seniors, their worst fears gave way to the
unexpected.
As the signup deadline for groups to
enter the Draw neared, many students
scrambled to form groups ranging from
one to eight. Dorm panels were held to
discuss the logistics of the Draw and
provide information for inexperienced
freshmen, while students flocked to
Row houses to inspect living conditions.
Drama ensued as friends gathered to
decide groups and preferences.
As a first-time subject to the Draw,
freshman Bernadette Cay's biggest fear
was, "Getting screwed â€” living in a
dorm. Even worse, living in Wilbur.
Again," said the current Cedro resident.
Once students submitted their
groups, they had nothing to do but sit
and wait for four days.
Last Wednesday, May 7 at 5 p.m.,
Draw numbers were available and stu
dents rushed to housing offices to see
what fate had in store.
As students ran their fingers down
the list of numbers,some jumped up and
down in delight, as others merely saun
tered back to their rooms.
"I was happy but I wasn't ecstatic,be
cause after I saw our draw number, I
knew we probably wouldn't be getting
our first choice," said Mary Alfred, a
freshman whose group drew 903. "But I
think a random draw is probably the
fairest procedure you can have. It still
would have been neat to draw number
one though."
The lucky holders of this year's top
number are Melody Alonzo, Jen Beich
man and Jess Hara, all rising seniors of
the Class of 2(K)7, an especially unique
group because Beichman and Hara are
studying abroad. Both girls found out
about their number through an email
from Alonzo.
