## Draw's lucky number one stumped for best choice Three juniors, all abroad, receive number one, 680 and Jerry are their top choices 
### BY KAITLIN WOOD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Draw has struck fear into the
hearts of generations of Stanford stu
dents for years, and this spring was no
different. But for a lucky trio of rising
seniors, their worst fears gave way to the
unexpected.
As the signup deadline for groups to
enter the Draw neared, many students
scrambled to form groups ranging from
one to eight. Dorm panels were held to
discuss the logistics of the Draw and
provide information for inexperienced
freshmen, while students flocked to
Row houses to inspect living conditions.
Drama ensued as friends gathered to
decide groups and preferences.
As a first-time subject to the Draw,
freshman Bernadette Cay's biggest fear
was, "Getting screwed — living in a
dorm. Even worse, living in Wilbur.
Again," said the current Cedro resident.
Once students submitted their
groups, they had nothing to do but sit
and wait for four days.
Last Wednesday, May 7 at 5 p.m.,
Draw numbers were available and stu
dents rushed to housing offices to see
what fate had in store.
As students ran their fingers down
the list of numbers,some jumped up and
down in delight, as others merely saun
tered back to their rooms.
"I was happy but I wasn't ecstatic,be
cause after I saw our draw number, I
knew we probably wouldn't be getting
our first choice," said Mary Alfred, a
freshman whose group drew 903. "But I
think a random draw is probably the
fairest procedure you can have. It still
would have been neat to draw number
one though."
The lucky holders of this year's top
number are Melody Alonzo, Jen Beich
man and Jess Hara, all rising seniors of
the Class of 2(K)7, an especially unique
group because Beichman and Hara are
studying abroad. Both girls found out
about their number through an email
from Alonzo.
"Once I found out, the thought run
ning through my head was. 'Wow. We
could live anywhere and it's guaran
teed that we will get in,"' said Beich
man. "This was followed by complete
shock, because I was so certain we
would get something awful: something
bigger than 1,500."
Now the only question remaining is
where to live.
"Right now, our top choices are
Jerry and 680," Beichman said. "We are
currently debating how we want to split
up, and the room configuration in Jerry
and 680 gives us the best choices: two
room doubles and some triples. Also,
we have friends on staff in Jerry, which
means the environment should be
great."
However, with Beichman at Ox
ford and Hara in Florence, arranging
housing has not proceeded smoothly
for the three girls, despite their envied

number.
"Talking about Draw stuff has been
very difficult," Alonzo said. "There is
an ocean between the girls and I and
we're always on opposite ends of our
days."
Not everyone receives their top
choices, so students must seek alterna
tives.
"My friends and I would like to get
into a house, but we also have to keep in
mind that this could be unlikely," Al
fred said. "One option that my group
and I are looking at is Roble. Roble has

— MELODY ALONZO, senior

singles and they're remodeling every
thing, so we're hoping that we can get a
bunch of newly renovated rooms."
As many students face the next bout
of anticipation waiting to receive their
housing assignment result, others can
rest assured that they will reside at their
top choice.
"Getting the one is outrageous, it
just doesn't happen, not to you," Alon
zo said. "But it did happen and it is now
definitely one of my most memorable
college moments, which I think is pret
ty neat."
