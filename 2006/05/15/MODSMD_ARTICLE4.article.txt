### GARY CHANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
More than 200 students from colleges across the United
States and Canada gathered in Jordan Hall this past Saturday for
the sixth-annual Stanford Undergraduate Psychology Confer
ence. Sponsored by the Stanford Undergraduate Psychology As
sociation (SUPA) and the Stanford chapter of Psi Chi National
Honor Society of Psychology, the student-run conference was an
opportunity for students to share and discuss their current re
search with fellow peers and leading researchers.
Many participants considered this year's conference — with
more than 120 student presentations, representing 42 universi
ties and 17 states — the largest and most successful, organizers
said.
The day-long conference featured oral and poster presenta
tions, where participants verbally articulated and defended their
research findings to fellow psychologists. Senior Eva Chen, a
psychology major who plans to become a professor in the field,
said that giving an oral presentation this year allowed her to dis
cover "how thrilling it can be to stand in front of other like-mind
ed people to talk about your own research."
