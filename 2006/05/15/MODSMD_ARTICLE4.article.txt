### GARY CHANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
More than 200 students from colleges across the United
States and Canada gathered in Jordan Hall this past Saturday for
the sixth-annual Stanford Undergraduate Psychology Confer
ence. Sponsored by the Stanford Undergraduate Psychology As
sociation (SUPA) and the Stanford chapter of Psi Chi National
Honor Society of Psychology, the student-run conference was an
opportunity for students to share and discuss their current re
search with fellow peers and leading researchers.
Many participants considered this year's conference — with
more than 120 student presentations, representing 42 universi
ties and 17 states — the largest and most successful, organizers
said.
The day-long conference featured oral and poster presenta
tions, where participants verbally articulated and defended their
research findings to fellow psychologists. Senior Eva Chen, a
psychology major who plans to become a professor in the field,
said that giving an oral presentation this year allowed her to dis
cover "how thrilling it can be to stand in front of other like-mind
ed people to talk about your own research."
"Seeing all of the students' projects really opened my
eyes to the breadth of fields that are influenced by psy
chology," said Carolina Sofia Gutierrez, a master's stu
dent in psychology, executive director of this year's con
ference and a three-year veteran.
In addition to showcasing undergraduate research,
eminent speakers from the faculty of Stanford's Psychol
ogy Department were on hand. Faculty members, such as
Prof. Gordon Bower and Prof. Philip G. Zimbardo — who
is known for conducting the famous Prison Experiment
— were invited to attend the conference as well. In addi
tion, an informal luncheon was provided during which
participants were paired up with professors or graduate
students in their field of interest. This provided a valuable
venue for students to meet and talk with campus re
searchers.
The conference is a reaffirmation of the definitive as
pect of psychology at Stanford — research.
According to Zimbardo, "[The department's] reputa
tion is earned by the creative and prolific contributions to
basic knowledge in psychology that our faculty has gener
ated through its pioneering research and original theo
ries."
For most participants, the presented research is the end
product of years of work. Many will pursue a career in re
search and graduate degrees in psychology. In fact, the
conference concluded with a talk discussing the prospects

of graduate schooling in psychology.
Despite the heavy research emphasis,the organizers of
SUPC hope to impact the broader community. All the
proceeds of the conference were donated to the South
San Francisco High School as a part of the Stanford Psy
chology Education Program (SPEP), also organized by
the Stanford Undergraduate Psychology Association. The
program aims to promote psychology education in high
schools from underprivileged areas by providing these
schools with the means to purchase textbooks and other
teaching materials. In this way, the conference aims to pro
mote interest in psychology at an even earlier stage.
Eva Chen, who was the executive director of last year's
conference and an associate director of this year's event,
emphasized the success of the conference, and praised the
hard work of those involved.
"SUPC, for me, represents a culmination of hard work
on everyone's side," Chen said. "Whether you're directing
the conference or aiding with its creation, or whether you
have a Powerpoint or poster to present to others, at the
end of the day, you just feel so immensely rewarded with
the intensely academic experience."
Gutierrez, who plans to further her education in public
health after completing her masters in psychology, agreed.
"The conference has given me a lot of inspiration to
continue pursuing, and promoting, research and educa
tion in psychology," she said.
