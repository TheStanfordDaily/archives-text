# Beinin chosen as face of terrorism for book cover, sues publishing company
## David Horowitz picks Beinin for cover of "Campus support for terrorism" 
### AMIT ARORA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For the cover of his new booklet "Campus Support for
Terrorism," nationally-known conservative author David
Horowitz has chosen the face of Stanford History Prof.
Joel Beinin. In response, Beinin has filed a lawsuit against
the book's publishers. *
In an interview with The Stanford Daily, Beinin cited
copyright violation as the reason for the lawsuit.
"Isn't it ironic that someone who claims to be a great
defender of capitalism, the free market, and private prop
erty would steal my intellectual property?" he said.
"Don't I have the same property rights as others?"
While many liberal professors have faced attacks by
conservative groups in recent years, Beinin is one of the
first to respond with legal action. According to The San
Jose Mercury News, his suit does not address libel or free
speech issues, but rather the publisher's use of his photo
without permission.
Specializing in Egypt, Israel and Palestine, Beinin has

published a number of books and journal articles over his
academic career. In advocating a peaceful, international
response to the human rights problems spurred by Israel's
occupation of the West Bank, Beinin has been viewed by
conservatives in the United States as a radical liberal.
The conservative group "Campus Watch," for exam
ple, has criticized Beinin and suggested that his pro-
Palestinian outlook compromises his teaching. Horowitz
also targeted Beinin in a previous book "ITie Professors:
The 101 Most Dangerous Academics in America."
Beinin commented on Horowitz's publication of the
latest book and the intentions of its author.
"The booklet on which my photo illegally appears
seems to be part of a concentrated campaign to vilify and
discredit academics who disagree with the views of the
Bush administration, especially on Middle East policy
matters," he said. "Campus Watch, Martin Kramer's
book. Ivory Towers on Sand, the writings of Daniel Pipes
and Hoover Institution fellow Stanley Kurtz all adopt
similar approaches. They invent claims out of whole
cloth, or lift quotes out of context, or distort the meaning
of people's words or make arguments by innuendo. On
the whole they viciously attack professors for doing

things (teaching and writing) that
are perfectly legitimate but that do
not accord with their ultra-right
wing agenda."
Beinin also responded to Campus
Watch's claims of an "anti-Israel
bias" at Stanford.
"The notion that there is an 'anti-
Israel bias' at Stanford is ridiculous,"
he said. "What it seems to mean, in
fact, that there is a debate about
Palestinian-Israeli issues on campus.
In my opinion that is entirely proper
and a good thing. Iliere are plenty of
faculty members, courses, student
groups, and extra-curricular activi
ties at Stanford that are supportive
of Israel."
President of the conservative
Center for the Study of Popular Cul
ture, Horowitz has published a num
ber of books, articles and journal en
tries over the last forty years. Origi
nally a leftist postgraduate student
at UC-Berkeley during the l%os,
Horowitz has become a leading con
servative speaker in the last two
decades, with publications such as
"Left Illusions" and"The Anti-

Chomsky Reader."
In his introduction to "Campus
Support for Terrorism," Horowitz
described the support for Nazi
Fuhrer Adolf Hitler by German aca
demic institutions in the 1930s and
then compared the advocacy of
Nazism to liberal faculty support of
radical Islam in the current political
climate.
While Beinin's lawsuit limits itself
to the picture on the book's cover,
Beinin looked to achieve an ideolog
ical victory with legal action.
"I'm hoping to win the suit, pro
tect my copyright, and send a mes
sage to Horowitz that he can not
steal my picture and use it to make
inflammatory and untrue claims
about me," he said. "He can't, and in
fact, does not even try, to prove that
I am a 'campus collaborator with ter
rorism.' But putting my picture on
the book falsely asserts that I am."
Despite criticism from conserva
tive thinkers, Beinin has achieved
significant recognition for his aca
demic work in the Middle East. A
tenured professor at Stanford, he
has served on the University's Facul
ty Advisory Committee on Islamic
Studies since 2002 and was the pres
ident of the Middle East Studies As
sociation of North America from
2001 to 2002.
