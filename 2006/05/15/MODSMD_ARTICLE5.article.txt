# Beinin chosen as face of terrorism for book cover, sues publishing company
## David Horowitz picks Beinin for cover of "Campus support for terrorism" 
### AMIT ARORA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For the cover of his new booklet "Campus Support for
Terrorism," nationally-known conservative author David
Horowitz has chosen the face of Stanford History Prof.
Joel Beinin. In response, Beinin has filed a lawsuit against
the book's publishers. *
In an interview with The Stanford Daily, Beinin cited
copyright violation as the reason for the lawsuit.
"Isn't it ironic that someone who claims to be a great
defender of capitalism, the free market, and private prop

"Don't I have the same property rights as others?"

conservative groups in recent years, Beinin is one of the
first to respond with legal action. According to The San

conservatives in the United States as a radical liberal.
The conservative group "Campus Watch," for exam

Palestinian outlook compromises his teaching. Horowitz
also targeted Beinin in a previous book "ITie Professors:
The 101 Most Dangerous Academics in America."
Beinin commented on Horowitz's publication of the
latest book and the intentions of its author.
"The booklet on which my photo illegally appears
seems to be part of a concentrated campaign to vilify and
discredit academics who disagree with the views of the
Bush administration, especially on Middle East policy
matters," he said. "Campus Watch, Martin Kramer's
book. Ivory Towers on Sand, the writings of Daniel Pipes
and Hoover Institution fellow Stanley Kurtz all adopt
similar approaches. They invent claims out of whole
cloth, or lift quotes out of context, or distort the meaning
of people's words or make arguments by innuendo. On
the whole they viciously attack professors for doing
