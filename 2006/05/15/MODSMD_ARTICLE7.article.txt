## Here's to you, Mrs. Cannizzaro 
### 
Happy belated Mother's Day, Mom!
In lieu of compensation for endur
ing years of my three-hour-long
ballet recitals (not to mention rent for the
nine months I spent in your womb), 1
thought I'd dedicate a column to you and
all of the important things you've taught
me about life and love. Die following is a
small sample of some of my favorite les
sons. Enjoy!
The people you choose to date should be
kind, decent, human beings. It seems intu
itive, but you wouldn't believe how many
times I've realized that my flavor-of-the
week is actually an unkind, indecent, rac
coon. They tricked me with their hypnotic
raccoon-song and ability to wash food in
the river, but once I remembered your
words of wisdom I said goodbye to disre
spectful significant others and hello to a
furry new hat.
A sense of humor will get you through
anything. Remember when you used to
blow up latex gloves in the doctor's of
fice before I had to get a shot? Or the
time we were eating ice cream at Baskin-
Robbins while talking about putting my
dog to sleep? I began to cry, so you start
ed banging your head against the wall in
order to make me laugh, even though the
Baskin-Robbins employees freaked out
and hid behind the counter. I'll never
forget that (and neither will they).
Things didn't go as well when my
friend's dog died and I started slapping
myself without explanation, but hell, I
thought it was funny.
Occasionally it is necessary to threaten
the lives of those who wrong you or your
loved ones. The only way I got through
middle school was with the knowledge
that if things got really bad, you promised
to set fire to anyone who made me cry. Al
though our neighbors may not have un
derstood our brand of vigilante justice,
being in touch with my anger in a humor
ous way has allowed me to channel my
emotions into productive activities. My
roommate and I play this game where we
make a list of people that deserve to be
punched for causing us some level of irri
tation or trauma. My current hit-list in
cludes various exes, people who eat
wasabi thinking that it is guacamole, Lind
say Lohan and whoever decided that
using a jackhammer is an acceptable ac
tivity at 7 a.m. I don't care if Sigma Chi is
building a frickin' orphanage in its front
yard â€” I need my sleep boys, so prepare
to fight.
There are very few things that cannot be
fixed with constant prayer, a cup of coffee
and/or a trip to Nordstrom's. For the ulti
mate pick-me-up, recite the Lord's Prayer
while sipping espresso during a semiannu
al sale.
There's always an excuse to throw a
rockin' party. I've seen you put together an
awesome celebration with nothing but a
frozen chicken breast and a roll of duct
tape. Sure, at first people were skeptical
about "duct tape-chicken risotto," but
once they took that first bite of sticky, deli
cious goodness, everyone was ready to
party. I can still vividly recall my birthday
parties from the age of three onwards be
cause you always made me feel special.
You also organized intricate games involv
ing dress-up clothes and makeup, which
may or may not have something to do with
the fact that most of my male childhood
friends turned out to be gay. The bottom
line is this: everyone and every occasion
deserve to be celebrated, so celebrate
them well.
To thine own self be true. You have always
been your own woman, and a strong, inde
pendent, beautiful one at that. You gave
me the strength to follow my dreams, to
risk everything to be happy even when
that made you afraid. "To my children I
give these things, one is love and the other
is wings." Thank you for living by that
mantra, and for pouring your heart and
soul into one of the most underappreciat
ed jobs on earth.
I love you so much and would not be the
person I am today without you. Happy
Mother's Day!
