Ever wish you could master the skill
of Irish folk dancing? Or learn
more about Japanese tea culture?

At the Bechtel International Center this
month, you can. Throughout May and
into early June, Bechtel will hold spe-

cial events as part of International
Month 2(M)6 — all events showcase
different world cultures. Many activi
ties already took place last week,
such as the Indonesian film festival,
the nightclub salsa class and the

Caribbean cultural extravaganza.
But there iire still many left to check
out, and admission is free.
Most of the events will be
held at the Bechtel Center at the
corner of Mayfield Avenue and
Lomita Drive. Through different so
cial and cultural programs such as In-

ternational Month, the Bechtel Cen
ter attempts to help international stu
dents spend more time with one an
other, as well as with other American

students. By organizing events ana ac
tivities that many people can enjoy and
learn from, Bechtel hopes to create a more
cohesive student body. International Month
is a perfect example of the center's mission.

Due to the nature ot publicity, we
have managed to attract mostly members of
the Stanford community to attend our
events, although we do not have any strict
admission criteria," says Junyang Yoon, a
student coordinator at the Bechtel Inter
national Center and a graduate student in
management science and engineering.
Yoon adds that many people attended
previous weeks' International Month ac
tivities.

"Events like the potluck and music
night, Caribbean cultural night and In
donesian film festival have been very
popular," Yoon says. "TUrnout has been
more than a hundred people for each
event last week. Students — both Ameri
can and international — and faculty mem
bers have attended our past events."
The goal of the month-long event is to
provide opportunities for the members of the
Stanford community to experience different
cultures' dance and food. Organizers of the
event hope to promote mutual understanding of
the diverse cultures and nationalities in
Stanford community. More informa
