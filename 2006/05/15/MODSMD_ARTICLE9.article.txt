# 'Deianeira' to address gender politics and geopolitics
## 
### MARISSA KLEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Love, betrayal and violence will take the
stage this week on campus in the world pre
miere of "Deianeira." Prof. Rush Rehm of the
Drama and Classics Departments wrote the
play, adapted from Sophocles' "Women of
Trachis." Choreographer and Drama Lectur
er Aleta Hayes will be the only performer, as
"Deianeira" is a solo piece.
The play opens Wednesday, May 17 and
runs through Saturday, May 20 in the Pross
er Studio Theater in Memorial Auditorium.
It will reopen in the same location on
Wednesday, May 24 and run through Satur
day, May 27.
Rehm, who will also direct the play, says
that he regularly works with Greek tragedy.
"Usually I do more publishable transla
tions, but this is more reworked, so I've felt
freer to take the artistic liberties you need to
be able to par it down into a one-person
show," Rehm explains.
In the spirit of ancient Greek theater,
"Deianeira" combines music, song and dance
with modern multimedia elements like video
art and new LED lighting technologies. New

York composer and visiting artist Michael
Keck wrote the original score, which has Mid
dle Eastern and North African influences.
"Greek tragedy was an interactive, multi
media event, so the material itself suggested
it," Rehm says.
"Deianeira" is a focused version of the
heroine's story in "Women of Trachis." She
hopes to restore the affections of her philan
dering husband — the mythical Heracles —
hut she inadvertently causes his death in
stead. Despite the play's ancient origins, the
text's themes and the title character's pas
sions lend the production a modern rele
vance.
"In 'Women of Trachis,' which is rarely
performed, there are feminist and anti-war
elements in the lead character Deianeira,"
Rehm says. "So the show is thematically rele
vant in terms of contemporary situations of
gender politics and geopolitics. It has an im
plicit critique of war from the domestic per
spective and against wars of aggression. Since
we're engaged in such wars today, it's inter
esting."
Rehm and Hayes say they conceived the
piece as a team effort that would appeal to
their individual strengths.

"We wanted to collaborate on classical
theater, and we talked about it being some
thing we could tour, using my dancing, singing
and acting all together to create a perform
ance piece," Hayes explains. "As a dancer, I
don't start from a script, and usually when I'm
a collaborator I approach it from a physical
place. So it's been interesting to combine
what I know with starting from the text in
stead. It's a very layered process."
Hayes, who has spent much time in New
York, has toured Europe in Robert Wilson
and Bernice Johnson Reagan's "The Tempta
tion of Saint Anthony" She currently teaches
a drama course at Stanford titled "Being a
Performer, Creating a Performance." The
class introduces students to interdisciplinary
approaches to performance.
But "Deianeira" marks the first time
Hayes has undertaken such an intense solo
performance piece.
"It's total surrender — you can't think
ahead at all, you can only be where you are in
the moment you're in," Hayes says. "When
you don't have anybody but yourself, you
have to create the obstacle while you're fight
ing it. You have to push against yourself.
Every single movement counts."

"Deianeira" is the product of Creative Al
chemies Initiative, a three-year Drama De
partment project that brings professional
artists to Stanford to develop their new
works. The program focuses on interdiscipli
nary performances that go beyond the scope
of normal "think tank" models of explo
ration and brings visiting artists and scholars
together with Stanford faculty, students and
artists to create innovative, collaborative
works. The "Deianeira" production team
plans to take the piece to Nfiw York and tour
Europe next year.
"It's a very contemporary moment for hy
brid forms of performance," Hayes says.
"This piece addresses so many different
forms — dance, music, acting, Greek — and
it's so high tech. It's so much of what our
world is about — different disciplines in dia
logue and different conversations being in
terwoven into art."
All performances of "Deianeira" are at 8
p.m. and all seating is general admission.Tick
ets are $10 for students and $15 for general ad
mission. They can be purchased at the door or
may be reserved in advance by calling (650)
