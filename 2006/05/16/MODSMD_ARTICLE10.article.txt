# 'Wipe that smirk off your face'
## English doctoral student draws links between breeds of irony, thanks H&S for literary sensibility 
### WEENA PUN 
The youngest of the schools at Stan
ford, the School of Humanities and Sci
ences today is — as the Web site claims —
the heart of the University and a primary
locus of its liberal education. Fifty-eight
years after its inception, it is now the
largest school on campus, with about
2,100 graduate students, 42 percent of
whom are women. H&S is also responsi
ble for more than 80 percent of under
graduate education and awards the
largest number of PhDs.
The school has more than 500 faculty
members, 28 departments, 19 interdiscipli
nary degree programs and 20 research
centers and teaching resources. The school
is proud to offer a distinctive academic en
vironment combining undergraduate and
graduate education and training and re
search led by internationally acclaimed
faculty.

Lee Konstantinou is an H&S graduate
student who is grateful for these resources.
After completing his honors thesis at Cor
nell in 2000, he joined the English Depart
ment. He notes, "I have had the good for
tune to work with a number of very sup
portive and insightful advisers."
Kontantinou's advisers include Ramon
Saldivar, Ursula Heise and Sianne Ngai.
Saldivar is the chair of Stanford's English
Department, one of the nation's top five hu
manities programs. Sixteen other H&S de
partments ranked in the top 10.
Konstantinou is currently working on
his dissertation called "Wipe That Smirk off
Your Face. Postironic Fiction and the Public
Sphere." His dissertation diagrams the rela
tionships between hip irony, the opposition
al sensibility of the counterculture aijd liter
ary postirony.
"My approach to the authors that I am
looking at tries to be both historically in
formed and analytical. In terms of histori

cal period. I look at fiction written between
the 1950s and today, with a special focus on
the fiction of the 19905," Konstantinou says,
shedding light on his work.
Some key authors mentioned in his dis
sertation include Ralph Ellison, Thomas
Pynchon, William Gibson, David Foster
Wallace and Dave Eggers.
H&S recently launched the Graduate
Research Opportunities initiative to award
its students grants of up to $S.(KX) for re
search expenses directly related to their dis
sertations.
Kontantinou acknowledges Stanford's
generosity in helping with his research ef
forts.
He says, "Stanford's helped me with my
dissertation by generously providing me
with a stipend and other financial support
as I've done my research."
Expenses eligible for GRO funding in
clude travel for archival or field research,
purchase of data sets and special analytical

software, human-subject costs, and survey
expenses.
"1 think the intellectual life of the cam
pus is quite vibrant," Kontantinou adds.
"The Cantor Arts Center. Digital Humani
ties Lab, Humanities Center. Center for the
Study of the Novel and other organizations
have been very good about spearheading
innovative projects, organizing confer
ences, and bringing cutting-edge scholars to
the campus."
Despite these facilities and various out
side donations — totaling $307 million last
year — Kontantinou believes more can be
done.
"More funding would allow for more
programs of the sorts mentioned above,"
Kontantinou explains.
More importantly, he hopes for further
departmental integration within H&S, sug
gesting, "We might also increase our focus
on interdisciplinary both within the human
ities and outside of it."
