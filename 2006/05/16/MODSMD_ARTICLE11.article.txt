## Editorial ResEd's policies fall short of the mark 
### 
At many other universities,resident as
sistants serve more as hall monitors
who serve citations and keep to
themselves. But at Stanford, we have RAs
who are our friends. And thanks to Residen
tial Education, we also have RTs, HPACs
and PHEs who are all our friends.
Yes, we have a variety of resources within
our dorms who, with smiling faces, try their
best to help us with everything from drop
deadlines to relationship problems. But not
everyone subscribes to this notion of "resi
dential education" to begin with. Many
freshmen come to Stanford already quite
mature and independent. Their transition
from high school to college does not need fa
cilitation. The unspoken premise of Res Ed's
program is that Stanford students are not
ready to be adults. Needless to say, such a
premise can be rather patronizing.
For instance, if two freshman roommates
have incompatible living habits, they still
have to jump through Res Ed's administra
tive hoops to change rooms, even if they
have come up with a solution themselves.
Why can't freshmen have a greater say in
their own situation?
In this light, Res Ed's policies are support
ive but stifling. After leaving our parents to
come to college, some of us are flabbergasted
to find another set of parents the size of an
administrative branch of the University. But
instead of being caring parents who take the
trouble to get to know us personally, ResEd
functions as a taskmaster who lays down
rules and sends us for counseling sessions.
As we progress through Stanford, some
upperclassmen become less enthusiastic
about Res Ed's efforts. Mandatory meal plans
— the bane of many a senior's existence —
are meant to compel us to eat in dining halls
with our "communities," when all some of us
want to do is check out the restaurants in

downtown Mountain View. Meanwhile,
ResEd persists in strengthening our commu
nities through multiple staff members and ex
tensive but vapid programming. Is it any sur
prise then that most of Res Ed's programming
becomes wearisome and ineffectual?
To make matters worse, ResEd does a
poor job at creating community for those
who would really benefit from having a good
support system. For all its empty rhetoric,
ResEd creates a bunch of fast friends who
never meet up with each other once they
move across campus. Res Ed's programs
warn us of the dangers of date rape and eat
ing disorders, but fail to reach out to students
who do get date-raped and develop eating
disorders and are reluctant to talk about
their problems. ResEd also emphasizes the
beauty of diversity, but there has yet to be an
honest discussion about race on this campus.
We are not condemning the wonderful
people who work in ResEd — as we said,
many of them are our friends. Nor are we try
ing to get rid of Res Ed. Rather, we are say
ing that it should seriously reexamine its
policies. We acknowledge that there will al
ways be a number of freshmen who delight
in the obsessive amount of handholding that
ResEd provides. But don't blame us for
being less than enthusiastic about a system
that treats us as children rather than adults.
ResEd thinks that it is on the right track:
They have good intentions, but we all know
where that leads. We challenge the appropri
ateness of formal teaching in a residential
setting. We question Res Ed's notion that
"living and learning should be integrated,
not separate," especially given Res Ed's
overbearing didactic methods. We encour
age ResEd to stop imposing its ideas of com
munity on Stanford students. We look for
ward to the day when ResEd will implement
better policies to meet its professed goals.
