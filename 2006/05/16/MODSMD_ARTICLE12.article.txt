# Drawing 1,000
## 
### 
For all the fuss about it, the housing
Draw really isn't that bad. (Look at
that, I just made everyone who drew
over 1,200 hate me).
Really, though, what's the worst that
could happen — you'll end up in Serra,
sandwiched between 8 a.m. construction and
Stern Dining? Okay, so it's not the Hilton,
but it's still better than where your state
school friends are stuck living. Besides, you
(supposedly) drew with a group of people
whom you like, so at least you'll have some
company when those jacichammers wake
you up at the crack of dawn on Saturday
mornings.
The thing that makes the Draw so stress
ful is the 'fact that everybody at Stanford
hates to lose. Yet it is designed so that rough
ly 98 percent of the student population will
come out feeling less than victorious. Con
sidering how ceaselessly people here work
toward intangible goals like degrees and
"knowledge," it is not difficult to imagine the
craze that would overtake campus if the
Draw were merit-based rather than com
pletely random.
I can see it now: Special review sessions
designed to improve your chances of draw
ing a low number would fill MemAud to ca
pacity. Private Draw tutors would flood cam
pus. GPAs would drop as getting into med
school suddenly didn't seem nearly as im
portant as securing that two-room double in
Bob.
If you draw one, you win. Every man
wants to be you, and every woman wants to
be with you. (No, seriously — if it means I
get to hang out in Jerry everyday, I'm all
yours).
On the other hand, if you manage to draw
3,000, you're in a league of your own. (I am,
of course, ignoring those who use their un
preferred year, since their battle for a spot
on the Row is about as irrelevant as a Yan
kees-Devil Rays game).
The person who draws 3,500 has a great
claim to fame. For weeks, draw groups have
been having hypothetical conversations:
"Which number do you like better, 680 or
717?"
"I don't know,but my favorite is the num
ber one, because that's what we're going to
get, because we are just that awesome."
"I know, right? I feel sorry for the poor
chump who gets stuck with 3,500. It must
suck to be that bad at life."
"Yeah," you can tell them. "It does suck."

Then you smirk and walk back home to West
Lag as they marvel at how such a cool person
could draw so horribly — yet somehow
manage to maintain said coolness, despite
the three extra minutes it takes to bike to
class in the morning. Everyone will have the
utmost respect for you — it's the same con
cept as when college admissions officers fall
in love with applicants who write their essays
about overcoming adversity.
This was the gist of my Draw group's con
versation in the minutes immediately before
we found out our number and fate for next
year.
"It'll be so exciting if we draw really well,
and it's quite a feat to draw 3,500, but I won't
know how to respond if we get somewhere
in the middle," 1 told my drawmates.
We got 928. Needless to say, I had no
words at that point.
We couldn't complain, because at least
we knew we would have enough options to
fill up the eight spots on the form. But at the
same time, none of those eight spots would
contain the residences we listed in our initial
optimism. We consoled ourselves by heck
ling our friends who got lower numbers than
we did and subsequently made fun of those
who drew worse.
Drawing a middle number is rarely
talked about. Nobody wants to think that it
could happen to them, because it creates
quite a conundrum. But in some ways it is a
blessing in disguise; were it not for our real
ization that the most talked-about resi
dences were out of our league, we never
would have taken the time to discover the
lesser-known spots on campus.
But, no matter how happy I am with
where I end up, that doesn't mean I'm giving
up on those Jerry guys.

If you drew one, email Stephanie at
salessi@stanford.edu so she can get advice from
you for next year (and/or come visit you). If you
drew 3,500, it sucks to he you.
