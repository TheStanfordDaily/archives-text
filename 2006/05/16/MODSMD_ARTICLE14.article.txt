# My casually indifferent lover
## 
### 
I'm in love with my sprachpartner (speech
partner). It's the purest kind of love, be
cause nobody knows, except everybody
but her. It was love at first sight. It was the
language partner get-together in January,
where Stanford-in-Berliners meet with an
array of local students. I could tell she was in
terested by her profound disinterest. She ar
rived late and made a point of not noticing
me notice her. I played hard-to-get by talking
to the girl I'd just fallen in love with five min
utes earlier. That one was a high schooler
who liked Jennifer Love Hewitt and had a
boyfriend who didn't understand her the way
I did. Stan and I both fell for her, but since he
sat closer, he got to be her partner.
Fortunately She was there. Beautiful,
beautifully bored — like a Marlene Dietrich
Barbie. She was so intrigued by my awkward
manner and awful German that she didn't
say a word to me and partnered up with one
of my buddies for the quarter.
I was soon in a relationship, so I offered to
help said buddy hook up. I was like Cyrano de
Bergerac, except instead of writing love poetry,
I offered helpful advice like:"Dude! Hit that!"
There aren't many options for young men
looking for young women here in the Father
land. When Freud died asking what women
want, he was asking specifically what Ger
man women want. God answered with an
apologetic shake of his head, as if to say,
"What have I wrought?" There's abroadcest,
but that's a double-edged sword with a nu
clear megabomb attached. Hook-ups will
happen, what with the all-night-clubs, trains
that don't start running until 5:30 a.m. and my
place is just down the way, you can crash on
my couch! It's bad enough when they're in
your IHUM section and their opening move
is a Facebook poke. In a small group of 25, the
risk of a whole awkward quarter — the girls
whispering in the bathroom while the guys
shake their heads and offer a pity beer — can

be tough.
That's why I'm lucky She was at the meet
ing this quarter. 1 got her number under the
guise of becoming her new sprachpartner.
She's so cute with her way of hiding her burn
ing passion for me behind that platinum blond
mask of casual indifference. But I can tell she's
not pouting at me. She's pouting to me.
Last week, I was walking out of a midnight
showing of "Mission Impossible III," meditat
ing on the similarity between Ethan Hunt's
love for his hottie nurse fiancee and my unbri
dled, unspoken passion for my sprachpartner.
"For her," I mused,"l would bungee jump off a
building, fly helicopters through a field of wind
mills or star in the worst three-quel since "Guns
of the Magnificent Seven."' And then, like out
of an episode of "The OC," I saw this girl Sonja,
who's friends with my sprachpartner.
"Hey," I said, projecting the noble air of a
gentleman knight who's way into your best
friend.
"Hey," she said.
This was getting too close to flirting for
me. I didn't want my sprachpartner to think I
was cheating on her. We made small talk. She
had just seen a film, though I can't be sure
which because I wasn't listening.
"Say," I said cunningly, "we should all go
out sometime. You, Antonia, me, Antonia."
We shared a nod.
I've been in love before, of course. In our
first grade musical theater production of "The
Three Piggy Opera," I was the big Bad Wolf and

Alison was the Mama Pig. Though we shared
no scenes, you could cut the emotional tension
with a knife. 1 loved her so completely that the
only time we ever spoke was under the veneer
of Dodgeball, where I communicated my in
communicably intense feelings for her by
throwing her out every time I got the ball.
"You hit me in the head!" she said.
"I was aiming for your heart," I whispered.
But that was just puppy love, like the girl
my mom set me up with for junior prom who
laughed awkwardly when I said she was real
ly talkative after she hadn't talked in two
hours. Or the girl at debate camp who flirta
tiously asked me if the elevator was going up
(it wasn't.) Or the girl in my freshman semi
nar who made her designs on me clear by dat
ing a guy who was exactly like me, except
muscular and self-confident. That coy minx!
But what my sprachpartner and I have is
different. It's real. I'm not worried about the
competition. Sure, some of the other guys in
the program are handsomer, better dancers,
better German speakers, possess actual real
world skills, know how to flirt and generally
put me to shame in every department except
"Simpsons" trivia and perfect hair. But
whenever I worry that my love — like
Romeo and Juliet or Jack Twist and Ennis
Del Mar — will be forever unrequited, I just
think about Colin Farrell. Others can act a lot
better than Colin Farrell. But no one can
Colin Farrell as well as Colin Farrell. And no
one can carry on an unspoken sprachpartner
love affair with such desperate yearning (and
text messages that take half an hour to type)
like this humble, little, All-American award
winning, everyman columnist right here.
Ah, sprachpartner. Ah, humanity.
