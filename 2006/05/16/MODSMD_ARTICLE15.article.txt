## The 						only way to Middle East Peace 
### ROEI KASHI 
The only way to Middle East peace is to
understand that 700,(XX) Palestinian
refugees and millions of their descen
dants cannot and will not go back to Israel. All
other disagreements in the conflict are trivial
— at least for most Israelis like myself, who are
willing to accept far-reaching concessions for a
long-desired peace. Sadly, some campus ac
tivists and Palestinian politicians don't seem to
recognize this.
I know what it means to let go of an ances
tor's homelands and possessions. I know what
it means to live with angry grandparents. I am
the grandson of Persian and Kurdistani
refugees. Since I was a child, I have heard of my
grandmother's misfortunes — the massacres,
the humiliation, the looting of her family's
wealth, the deportation from her father's
house to a harsh, barren land of refugee camps.
But I also know how to forgive, forget, rec
ognize reality and move on. It is not a coinci
dence; I have been taught to do so. Rather
than being manipulated into proclaiming

what is rightfully theirs, my parents have been
educated to accept reality and to build their
new lives. And it is not just Israelis like us that
have moved on; millions of other 20th centu
ry refugees from Czechoslovakia, India, Pak
istan and Russia have done the same.
If peace is what MSAN and CJME at
Stanford are really fighting for, then they too
have to let go of the past and think about the
future. The "right of return" is widely recog
nized as a ploy to create a demographic ma
jority of Palestinians in both Israel and the
Palestinian territories, leading to a "one state
solution" and erasing Israel. Promoting the
"right of return" to four-year-olds in the
Palestinian territories, as well as to students
on campus fuels hatred and leads us one step
farther away from peace.
In his op-ed ("Daily's event coverage mis
leading," May 11), Sam Dubai claims that the
organizers of Palestine Awareness Month are
not inciting against Israel in their recent
events. In reality, the opposite is true. At the
recent screening of "Paradise Now" and the
discussion that followed, Israeli soldiers were

portrayed as monsters who seek to kill poor
Palestinian children. A woman told a mainly
Muslim audience that "you never know when
an Israeli soldier will enter your living room
and shoot your children." When I, as a former
Israeli soldier, responded to her claim, I was
subjected to hateful looks from the audience.
Then, a man stood up and said "be honest
with yourself and remember what they really
teach you in the Israeli army." Nothing could
be further from the truth. Israeli soldiers are
not told to kill innocent children.
The organizers of Palestine Awareness
Month probably believe that their events
help their Palestinian brethren. But they do
not. Rather, they are giving them false hopes
and increasing their anger, creating obstacles
to peace. It is time to understand the mistakes
that have been made in the last 50 years. If
you truly want to help the Palestinians, it is
time to let go of the past and shape the future.
