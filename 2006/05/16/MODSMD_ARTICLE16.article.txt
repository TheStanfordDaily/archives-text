## TENNISTIME Through My Eyes: JESSICA LECK For Leck, it's in the genes. Her father played on the men's team and playing Stanford tennis has been Leck's dream.

The penultimate Through My Eyes
brings you the seasoned perspective of sen
ior Jessica Leek. The No. 1 Stanford
women's tennis team's most renowned
"cheerleader," an effervescent Leek calls
NCAA tennis her "favorite time of the
year." She is even more excited about the in
augural NCAA Men's and Women's Tennis
Championships, with the women's Round of
16 kicking off this Thursday:
Love means something
If it isn't completely obvious by now, we're
a really close team. My teammates are some
of my best friends, and 1 have a feeling they
will be friends for life. I was lucky to be intro
duced to such an amazing group of people;
being on a team bonds you in a way that other
friendships don't. There's something monu
mental about working every day towards the
same, shared goal, with each of you knowing
that you represent more than just yourself.
A family affair
A few years ago when I began looking at
schools, my chances at Stanford seemed slim.
I really wanted to play in college and it just
didn't seem like it was going to work out here.
But when 1 talked to Lele [Forood], the
women's head coach, she said she'd have a
spot on the team for me.
In addition, Stanford offered everything I
wanted from college: being in California,
blending strong academics with competitive
athletics, and a great group of students I want
ed to surround myself with.
When Lele made that spot available to
me, 1 knew that I wouldn't be part of the start
ing lineup. But I also knew that I was going to

be part of the best tennis program in the
country, a program with a reputation for hav
ing a great group of girls. I think more than
most schools, we're incredibly team-oriented.
The Stanford team doesn't tend to attract the
prima-donna personality. Instead, we've all
worked really hard, in both academics and
athletics.
Plus, my dad was on the Stanford men's
team. In fact, he was part of [Director of Ten
nis] Dick Gould's first team. So as a little girl,
my dream had been to go to Stanford and be
on the team, just like him.
Soaring spirits
It's really exhausting, mentally and phys
ically, to be playing matches and be on the
road so often. We started a number of fun
traditions to keep up the group morale. At
first, they don't seem like a big deal, but the
more I reflect on it, the more I've realized
that this time you spend with your team
mates is priceless.
We like to play pranks on each other. TWo
years ago, the trend was to find a teammate's
bike and throw it into the highest tree you
could find. Anne and I also put toilet paper all
over [former teammate] Erin Burdette's
room, and we then had a silly string war.
I'm really going to miss this, the feeling
that I can kick back and be carefree. It's a nice
change of pace to have a really good time that
has nothing to do with going out â€” it's just
good, old-fashioned fun.
Looking back
There was a lot of sacrifice inherent to my
experience at Stanford, always juggling aca
demics and athletics. But I feel like there's
nothing I would change. I joined a sorority

Senior Jessica Leek wasn't around to see her father play for Stanford tennis in the mid
60s, but the 5-foot-8 Los Angeles native is trying to make a little history of her own.
