# WOMEN'S TENNIS
## Defending national champs face TCU next Duke, Florida, UNC also on Card's radar 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
Thirty-two men's and women's tennis
teams are about to descend upon The Farm

for the first-ever combined men's and
women's NCAA Tennis Championship.
Among those 32 teams is the next obstacle
standing between the Cardinal women and
their third-straight NCAA title — No. 16
Texas Christian University.
The two teams will meet at 6 p.m. Thurs
day, when the women's round of 16 kicks off
11 days of women's tennis at Taube Stadium.
The home team has been building to

ward this event since last fall when the
pieces were first put into play: two-time de
fending champion Stanford, with four sen
iors on a team of 11, would be hosting the
NCAA Championships.
"We're definitely excited and anxious for
NCAAs to finally be here," senior co-cap
tain Amber Liu said."We've worked so hard
all year and hope it really pays off."
The team, however, is cautious not to

look too far down the road. After all, the
women must still win four matches to take
home the title and could easily face such
perennial powerhouses as No. 8 Duke and
No. 4 Florida — the last team Stanford lost
to,in the 2(X)3 NCAA Championship match.
"We will definitely take this tournament
one match at a time because it doesn't do
any good to dwell on the next round if you
don't make it there," junior Anne Yelsey
said.
Liu agreed.
"We've made sure all year to not take any
team for granted, and we're not about to do
that at NCA As either," she said.
And so the team hunkers down for a few
more days of serious practice before facing
off against TCU (23-6). The Horned Frogs
are making their first Sweet 16 appearance
this year after blanking No. 18 Texas, 4-0 on
Saturday.
"They really handed it to Texas," Stan
ford Coach Lele Forood said. "They're a
very good group of players and we have to
be really ready. We know a little about them
because Nicole Leimbach [TCU's No. 1 sin
gles player, ranked 17th in the ITA rankings]
played for Southern California last year.
We're familiar with how good of a player she
is."
Can the Horned Frogs cause the Card to
croak on Thursday? It would be quite the
feat, especially if Stanford produces the kind
of focused play that has won it the past 82
matches.
"We're prepared for TCU," Yelsey said.
"A few of us have played some of their top
players in the fall and winter tournaments
but at this point, it doesn't matter who's on
the TCU team or what the match-ups are;
we just have to play within ourselves. We
know what to do."
If Stanford advances, it will face either
Duke (19-1) or No. 9 North Carolina (26-6)
on Friday at 6 p.m. The winner of Friday's
match will get Saturday off while the men's
teams play their round of 16 matches, before
playing the semifinal match at noon on Sun
day. If all goes smoothly for the Cardinal
women, they will be taking court in the cool
I evening air on Monday at 6:30 p.m for
i the Finals.
\ "We're obviously really excited
| going into this week," Yelsey said. "I
i think we all feel really well prepared,
| and after last weekend, we're all feel
ing on top of our games. Right now is
that ideal time to peak. Nothing else
matters."
