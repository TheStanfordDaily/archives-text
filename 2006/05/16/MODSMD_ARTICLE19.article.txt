Home sweet home-court advantage
It's massive. You know your surroundings, your
warmup routine, you know where everything is â€”
everything is very simple. With the fans, too, it should be
great. People are very excited about this. 1 know Coach
Gould has made an amazing effort to make this the
biggest event possible.
Pressure
You always feel pressure to perform well. You don't
remember the teams that get to the finals or semifinals.

even if they were great teams. You remember the teams
that won the NCAA Finals, and that's our goal. We
won't be happy with anything else, and that's what
we've been working towards all year.
The coaching staff
Last year was pretty tough on the coaches during
their first year. I remember going in to tell Coach
Whitjlinger] that 1 wasn't going to play this year and
he said. 'This is going to be really tough on me this
year.'
But I had to convince him that in the long run it
would work out better for him, and it seems to have
worked out this year. He's done a great job of dealing
with all the injuries. It's been really tough, as we've
played very good teams without a full lineup.
Losing to Arizona State without a full lineup was re
ally rough and something that's never happened since
he's been here,but everybody dealt with it well.They've
done a great job.
