# Through My Eyes:
## JAMES PADE Pade, one half ot Stanford's NCAA No. 16 doubles team, says he won't be happy with anything other than winning the national title 
### BEN BACKES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This week's Through My Eyes features James Pade,
a junior from Woodside, Calif. He was recently named
Second-Team All-Pac-1() and selected to compete in
the NCAA Doubles Championships witli teammate
KC Corkery. Pade played No. 1 doubles and No. 2 sin
gles for most of the year while helping the Card earn a
share of the Pac-10 title and a berth in this weekend's
Sweet 16.
Home sweet home-court advantage
It's massive. You know your surroundings, your
warmup routine, you know where everything is —
everything is very simple. With the fans, too, it should be
great. People are very excited about this. 1 know Coach
Gould has made an amazing effort to make this the
biggest event possible.
Pressure
You always feel pressure to perform well. You don't
remember the teams that get to the finals or semifinals.

even if they were great teams. You remember the teams
that won the NCAA Finals, and that's our goal. We
won't be happy with anything else, and that's what
we've been working towards all year.
The coaching staff
Last year was pretty tough on the coaches during
their first year. I remember going in to tell Coach
Whitjlinger] that 1 wasn't going to play this year and
he said. 'This is going to be really tough on me this
year.'
But I had to convince him that in the long run it
would work out better for him, and it seems to have
worked out this year. He's done a great job of dealing
with all the injuries. It's been really tough, as we've
played very good teams without a full lineup.
Losing to Arizona State without a full lineup was re
ally rough and something that's never happened since
he's been here,but everybody dealt with it well.They've
done a great job.

Senior co-captain Amber Liu has seen the Cardinal take the last two NCAA team titles. Last season, she was one win
away from taking a doubles title too, but fell to teammates Alice Barnes and Erin Burdette in the championships.

After redshirting last season, junior James Pade returned to play No. 1 doubles and N0.2 singles this season. The
6-foot-3 sociology major remembers his match against UCLA as one of the most exciting this year.
From redshirt to riches
A whole bunch of things came to
gether. I wasn't really enjoying tennis
and 1 knew that if I kept going on that
path, 1 probably would have quit. I
knew that after 15 years of playing
tennis that I wanted to keep going.
I'm here now and want to make a
career out of it after 1 play here, and
my team could be on a better path
than it was before. This year has
been the best I can ask out of college
tennis. I have a better attitude about
things.
Doubling up
KC and I have finally made it [to
the NCAA Doubles Champi
onships]. Our freshman year, we lost
in the finals of the Pac-1() [Tourna
ment] when we should have won it.
My sophomore year we lost in the fi

nals of the Pac-10. Both of those
times [if we had won] we would have
gotten in.
So we finally have made it. We're
hoping to put a serious dent in the
draw and we're excited about it.
We've played a lot together and
we've won a lot of tournaments to
gether. It should be good, especially
at home.
West coast bias?
It's funny thinking about it, be
cause I've played No. 2 most of the
year and if you look at the past No. 2
guys for Stanford, those guys have all
been ranked in the top 20 or top 30
and I'm not even ranked.
I don't mind — the college rank
ing system is confusing and that's the
way it goes. [Pac-10 players] are not
ranked as high as they should be. The

teams are also ranked lower than
they should be, but I think the Pac-10
will have an impressive showing in
the tournament.
Memories and moments
Beating Illinois was a lot of fun but
the time I remember most was when
we played UCLA this year. I've never
been in a match where it's come down
to the last match so quickly. I've never
been in an environment like that.
Chris [Rasmussen. a sophomore]
won that match because he felt he
should win that match.
We finally got those new stands in
the back [behind courts 4-6], and it
showed how powerful they are.
That's what we're really hoping for
in NCAAs — fans in tennis really
get your adrenaline and excitement
going.
