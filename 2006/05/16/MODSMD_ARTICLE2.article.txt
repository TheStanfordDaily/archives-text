## Futurist sees world changed by technology 
### KATHERINE COX STAFF WRITER 
Falling under such titles as inventor, entrepreneur, writer,
scientist, filmmaker and computer engineer, Ray Kurzweil is
a veritable renaissance man, envisioning a future trans
formed by artificial intelligence. Sponsored by the ASSU
Speakers Bureau, Kurzweil gave a talk titled "The Coming
Merger of Human and Machine: the Radical Expansion of
Human Longevity and Intelligence" last night in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium.
Kurzweil is the founder of nine businesses, many of which
employ artificial intelligence technologies of his own design.
His more notable inventions include an optical character
recognition device (OCR) that allows the blind to read any
print text; the first musical synthesizer to successfully repro
duce sounds from virtually any acoustic instrument; and
software that enables personal computers to recognize and
record human speech with great accuracy and speed.
Kurzweil is also a futurist, considered a leading authority
on the evolution and development of artificial intelligence
and information technologies. He has penned four books
and a number of articles dealing in large part with patterns
of technological evolution and forecasts on the nature and
capabilities of future advances. His latest book, "The Singu
larity is Near, When Humans Transcend Biology," deals with
innovation potentialities in fields of computer science, ge
netic engineering and nano-technology.
Adam Kahn, president of the ASSU Speakers Bureau
and a graduate student in communication, enumerated
Kurzweil's collection of honors â€” namely his induction into
the national inventor's hall of fame and his receipt of the
$500,000 Lemelson-MIT Prize for innovation and national
honors from three different U.S. presidents.
Moments later, Kurzweil took the stage and launched
headlong into his theory on the exponential growth of infor
mation technologies. He began by posing and answering,
"How can we make accurate predictions overall when any
specific project is completely unpredictable?"
The answer, he said, lies in the identification of trends in
large populations of such projects.
"The classic example is thermodynamics," he said, draw
ing the analogy between the unpredictable and predictable
behaviors of particles and the gases they make up, and the
random, chaotic behavior of individual humans and the
largely foreseeable overall results of these movements.

night about the rate of technological development and how
artificial intelligence will play an increasing role in daily life.
