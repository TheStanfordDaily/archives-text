## Futurist sees world changed by technology 
### KATHERINE COX STAFF WRITER 
Falling under such titles as inventor, entrepreneur, writer,
scientist, filmmaker and computer engineer, Ray Kurzweil is
a veritable renaissance man, envisioning a future trans
formed by artificial intelligence. Sponsored by the ASSU
Speakers Bureau, Kurzweil gave a talk titled "The Coming
Merger of Human and Machine: the Radical Expansion of
Human Longevity and Intelligence" last night in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium.
Kurzweil is the founder of nine businesses, many of which
employ artificial intelligence technologies of his own design.
His more notable inventions include an optical character
recognition device (OCR) that allows the blind to read any
print text; the first musical synthesizer to successfully repro
duce sounds from virtually any acoustic instrument; and
software that enables personal computers to recognize and
record human speech with great accuracy and speed.
Kurzweil is also a futurist, considered a leading authority
on the evolution and development of artificial intelligence
and information technologies. He has penned four books
and a number of articles dealing in large part with patterns
of technological evolution and forecasts on the nature and
capabilities of future advances. His latest book, "The Singu
larity is Near, When Humans Transcend Biology," deals with
innovation potentialities in fields of computer science, ge
netic engineering and nano-technology.
Adam Kahn, president of the ASSU Speakers Bureau
and a graduate student in communication, enumerated
Kurzweil's collection of honors — namely his induction into
the national inventor's hall of fame and his receipt of the
$500,000 Lemelson-MIT Prize for innovation and national
honors from three different U.S. presidents.
Moments later, Kurzweil took the stage and launched
headlong into his theory on the exponential growth of infor
mation technologies. He began by posing and answering,
"How can we make accurate predictions overall when any
specific project is completely unpredictable?"
The answer, he said, lies in the identification of trends in
large populations of such projects.
"The classic example is thermodynamics," he said, draw
ing the analogy between the unpredictable and predictable
behaviors of particles and the gases they make up, and the
random, chaotic behavior of individual humans and the
largely foreseeable overall results of these movements.

Ray Kurzweil, entrepreneur, inventor and futurist, spoke last
night about the rate of technological development and how
artificial intelligence will play an increasing role in daily life.
Kurzweil produced a series of graphs to
illustrate his analysis of the growth of tech
nologies in informational industries. Many
examples displayed a linear, increasing
graph, indicating that the technologies' in
fluence and advancements grew exponen
tially. Kurzweil showed how supercomput
ing power, the number of transistors per
microprocessor, random access memory
(RAM), Internet data traffic and a number
of other measures of information techno
logical improvements grow, over time, in
the same manner.
Kurzweil's second assertion dealt with
what he termed the paradigm shift rate. He
claimed that the rate at which paradigms —
or life-altering changes in the history of the
Earth — occur, is also deceasing at an ex
ponential rate.
"The reason that evolution accelerates
is that it uses new tools to help bring about
the next development," Kurzweil ex
plained. "Half a century ago, the first com
puters were designed on pen and paper.
Today, computers are used to design other
computers, which quickens the process."
According to Kurzweil, analysts' ten
dencies to evaluate human progress in con
stant terms leads to conservative estimates
about the future.
A final observation credited modern bi

ology with the attributes of an information
al process. According to Kurzweil, the
progress of the Human Genome Project
conforms to the exponential growth trend
model of other similar technologies.
"The amount of genetic data sequenced
doubled every year." he said.
Kurzweil's forecasts for the artificial
modeling of human intelligence were de
pendent on these rapid advancements in bi
ology and the current and predicted capa
bilities of nanotechnologies. He said he was
confident that "the hardware needed to
create a human level of intelligences will be
available in the 20205."
Gary Wolf, an audience member and
contributing editor at San Francisco-based
magazine Wired, said he was thoroughly
impressed by the talk.
"If you hear about [Kurzweil] second
hand he sounds like an extremist, but his
presentation is so rational and well sup
ported by evidence that it really makes you
question your own conservatism and cau
tion," Wolf said.
Bryan Ellis, a first-year graduate student
in electrical engineering added, "It was
hard to believe that supercomputers could
overtake human intelligence in a few
decades, but I guess the data seems to indi
cate that it is a possibility."
