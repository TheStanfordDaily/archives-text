## No. 5 Blue Devils up first in team championships Duke's Ludovic Walter could be an on-court threat 
### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As Stanford moves on to the Sweet 16. ex
pect its next opposition to fall somewhere in
between the squads from California and Quin
nipiac in terms of familiarity, but above both
teams in terms of skill. No. 5 Duke isn't nearly
as familiar to Stanford as No. 20 Cal, nor as ob
scure as Quinnipiac, but the No. 13 Cardinal
(17-3) know that the fourth-seeded Blue Dev
ils will be a tough match.
"Duke's had a very good year, and we have
a lot of respect for them," Coach John
Whitlinger said. "They're the No. 4 seed in the
tournament, and they've earned that high
seeding. There's a formidable path in sight for
us, but it's a match we're looking forward to
playing."
The Stanford men's tennis team took out
Quinnipiac and Cal in the first two rounds
of NCAA play this past weekend, and will
host Duke (22-6) on Saturday at 3 p.m. The
Blue Devils advanced to the Round of 16 by
defeating Winthrop. 4-0. and then No. 26

Boise St., 4-2.
The Cardinal have not faced the Devils this
season in dual-match play, but have had some
encounters in individual tournaments. Both
senior KC Corkery and freshman Matt Bruch
have faced Duke's top player. No. 5 Ludovic
Walter, in singles tournaments this year.
The two Cardinal split against the senior
from France.
No. 25 Corkery faced Walter in November's
semifinals of the Indoor Championships and
fell in two tight sets, 7-6 (3), 6-4. This match saw
21 games pass before there either player broke
serve. In 2(X)4, both seniors also met in the same
tournament and neither broke serve, as Walter
claimed victory in two tiebreakers.
Earlier this season, at the All-American in
Ililsa, Okla., Bruch upset Walter in the second
round of the tournament. After jumping to 4-2
leads in both the first and second sets, Bruch
closed out the match 6-4,6-2 in his first colle
giate tournament.
But before Stanford can worry about po
tential singles matchups, it must first focus on
doubles. In the past, Stanford has struggled to
win two of the three doubles matches for the
critical doubles point.
While junior James Pade and
Corkery are the No. 16 doubles team
in the country, the Cardinal need two
matches to snag the doubles point. In
addition, Whitlinger does not want
the team to always rely on the top
doubles pair.
"The team counts on KC and
James to win, but they're not invinci
ble either," Whitlinger said. "We can't
just think they're going to win all the
time. Two and three are going to have
to step up and win, and they did that
[on Sunday]. [The match against Cal
was] a good example â€” [KC and
James] were down 4-7, but the other
two teams stepped up big time. We
have to keep that mindset going in the
tournament."
Whitlinger gave Sunday's match as
an example of what the second and
third doubles positions are capable of.
"I can't say enough about what
number three doubles did,"
Whitlinger said of junior James Wan
and senior Jon Wong. "They played as
good a match as I've ever seen them
play, and that was a tone-setter for the
match. When you put an 8-0 up on the
board, that's pretty good, and it gave
the whole team a bounce. [As for
number two doubles], it's nice to see
Blake [Muller] and Matt win another
match and keep getting better and
better and more comfortable playing
with each other."

The winner of the Stanford-Duke
match will then face the winner of No.
4 Baylor and No. 21 Washington. Bay
lor earned a 4-0 win in the second
round over Tlilsa, and the Huskies
scored a 4-0 upset over No. 12 Virginia
Commonwealth.
Stanford is taking the tournament
one match at a time, though, and is fo
cusing its efforts on Saturday's match
against the Blue Devils.
"This is the do-or-die situation
now, and people tend to raise their
games," Whitlinger said. "Our guys
are really competing well. They're
working hard in the matches and not
letting little things bother them.
"That's what you need at this time
of year," he continued. "You hope you
can play your best tennis but a lot of
times, that doesn't happen. But if you
compete hard and stay positive, a lot
of good things can happen."
Ad-in: In addition to the two wins
this past weekend, Stanford received
more good news, as the ITA an
nounced its regional award winners.
Bruch was named ITA West Region
Rookie of the Year, and assistant
coach Dave Hodge was named West
Region Assistant Coach of the Year.
Bruch has posted an impressive 27-8
record this year, consistently playing
at the first and second singles posi
tions. He also recently won the Pac-10
singles title.
