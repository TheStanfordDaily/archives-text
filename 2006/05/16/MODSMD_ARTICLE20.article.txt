## No. 5 Blue Devils up first in team championships Duke's Ludovic Walter could be an on-court threat

As Stanford moves on to the Sweet 16. ex
pect its next opposition to fall somewhere in
between the squads from California and Quin
nipiac in terms of familiarity, but above both
teams in terms of skill. No. 5 Duke isn't nearly
as familiar to Stanford as No. 20 Cal, nor as ob
scure as Quinnipiac, but the No. 13 Cardinal
(17-3) know that the fourth-seeded Blue Dev
ils will be a tough match.
"Duke's had a very good year, and we have
a lot of respect for them," Coach John
Whitlinger said. "They're the No. 4 seed in the
tournament, and they've earned that high
seeding. There's a formidable path in sight for
us, but it's a match we're looking forward to
playing."
The Stanford men's tennis team took out
Quinnipiac and Cal in the first two rounds
of NCAA play this past weekend, and will
host Duke (22-6) on Saturday at 3 p.m. The
Blue Devils advanced to the Round of 16 by
defeating Winthrop. 4-0. and then No. 26

Boise St., 4-2.
The Cardinal have not faced the Devils this
season in dual-match play, but have had some
encounters in individual tournaments. Both
senior KC Corkery and freshman Matt Bruch
have faced Duke's top player. No. 5 Ludovic
Walter, in singles tournaments this year.
The two Cardinal split against the senior
from France.
No. 25 Corkery faced Walter in November's
semifinals of the Indoor Championships and
fell in two tight sets, 7-6 (3), 6-4. This match saw
21 games pass before there either player broke
serve. In 2(X)4, both seniors also met in the same
tournament and neither broke serve, as Walter
claimed victory in two tiebreakers.
Earlier this season, at the All-American in
Ililsa, Okla., Bruch upset Walter in the second
round of the tournament. After jumping to 4-2
leads in both the first and second sets, Bruch
closed out the match 6-4,6-2 in his first colle
giate tournament.
But before Stanford can worry about po
tential singles matchups, it must first focus on
doubles. In the past, Stanford has struggled to
win two of the three doubles matches for the
critical doubles point.
