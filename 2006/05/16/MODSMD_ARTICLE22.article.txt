## Crowd of 200 packs in to see top-ranked squash player 
### ANDREW BURMON STAFF WRITER 
The crowd in the Arrillaga Family Recre
ation Center went quiet last night as
Jonathon Power, who was the number one
ranked squash player in the world as of
March, and Martin Heath, the ex-number
four player in the world, stepped on the
squash court. The two had come to the Bay
Area to play in a San Francisco doubles
tournament, but accepted Stanford Coach
Mark Talbott's invitation to play an exhibi
tion match to benefit "Giving on the T," a fi

nancial outreach program spearheaded by
Tennyson West, a San Francisco Consulting
firm. The philanthropy program provides
money for such charities as the East Bay
College Fund, Joy of Sports Foundation,
New Leaders for New Schools, and Save the
Children literacy programs in the Central
Valley
Talbott, a former world number one him
self, was incredibly pleased to have the two
great players visit Stanford.
"It is a great occasion when we can offer
an exhibition of this type of talent," said Tal
bott, adding that the money raised for chari

ty, "only served to make the night all the
more exciting."
The crowd of around two hundred packed
into the squash courts and stood rapt as
Power and Heath, from Canada and Scotland
respectively, played four games of a best-of
five match, with Power winning 3-1. As the
points when on and the shots grew tougher,
the impression the skill level made on the au
dience became all the more obvious.
One Stanford Squash player could be
overheard commenting that Power's shots
didn't look "physically possible."
At the end of the match. Power addressed

the crowd and urged them to "support the
game of squash on the West Coast," a mes
sage that certainly hit home for the Stanford
Squash Teams. The women went varsity last
fall and the men hope to follow.
Heath too urged the crowd to make a con
tribution.
"Giving from the T is a great cause," he
said,"and should be enthusiastically support
ed by all of us."
As the Stanford teams took pictures with
Heath and Power.Talbott surveyed the scene
contentedly.
"That was really something," he said.
