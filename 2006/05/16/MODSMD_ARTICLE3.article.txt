# New site forges advising ties
## The
						Stanford Alumni Mentoring program aims to build closer relationships online 
### CHRISTOPHER LIN STAFF WRITER 
Yesterday evening, the Stanford
Alumni Mentoring program (SAM)
held a dessert reception to launch ef
forts to bring students and alumni to
gether for career planning and advice.
Held in the Fisher Conference Room
at the Arillaga Alumni Center, the re
ception attracted a large gathering of
working alumni and both undergradu
ate and graduate students interested
in pursuing mentoring partnerships.
SAM is the first online mentoring
program that offers students the abili
ty to receive career advice from alum
ni in close, long-lasting one-on-one re
lationships. The program's directors
expressed hope that alumni will be
able to offer students insight into the
working world.
"The CDC believes strongly in con
necting students with people in world
of work," said Marlene Scherer Stern,
student affairs officer at the Career
Development Center. "The Stanford
Career Network is a great way to con
tact alumni who say they're available
for career advice, but it's more static in
that students have to look through a
database. When students contact
someone, it's only meant to be ques
tion-and-answer.and that relationship
may not be ongoing. The idea of the
SAM program is to supplement that

with a more long-term matching, with
the idea that a mentoring relationship
would last at least six months."
SAM operates through an online
Web site at http://mentoring.stan
ford.edu that allows both students and
alumni to register. Alumni provide in
formation about their academic, in
dustry and personal background, and
are then entered into a database that
students can access. Students, in turn,
register with their own personal and
academic information, along with po
tential career interests and mentor
preferences. The SAM Web site then
recommends several alumni as match
es for each student, who can then con
tact them directly.
The idea for a mentoring program
was born out of Class of 2002 alumnus
Eric Wong's experience searching for
a job and receiving help from Jon
Blum, Class of 1984.
"In 2001,1 was desperately looking
for a job, but it was a really bad time,"
Wong said in his opening remarks at
the launch. "The tech bubble had just
burst, and September 11 had just oc
curred, so no one was hiring. 1 had a
chance in an interview to meet an
alum who was very encouraging, and
even though I didn't get the job at the
end. he turned out to be a mentor to
me. I remember it was really amazing
