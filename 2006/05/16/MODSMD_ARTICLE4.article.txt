## Off-label drugs often prescribed, study shows The
						practice may mean less safety and drug-testing precautions 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM STAFF WRITER 
Anyone who's been prescribed a drug at a doctor's
office has wondered, "But why this particular medi
cine?"
According to a recent study led by Randall S.
Stafford of the Stanford School of Medicine, doctors
often select medications without adequate research on
their effectiveness and safety.

When the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approves a medication, it approves it for specific indica
tions and uses.
However, "It is well-known that medications are
often used for conditions or diseases not covered by the
FDA indication," Stafford said in an interview with The
Daily. "We term that use 'off-label.'"
In an analysis of the top 1(X) drugs prescribed and 60
other commonly-used, randomly-selected drugs,
Stafford found that 21 percent of prescriptions were
off-label.
Off-label prescribing — while offering doctors
flexibility and innovation in treating patients — may
carry unknown risks. Furthermore, Stafford ex
plained that there are several different types of off

label prescribing.
"Some of these uses are virtually standard practice
but for one reason or another, the FDA has not ap
proved them for a secondary indication," he said. "On
the other hand, there are other off-label uses which
often are based oft scant information, where we have
concerns about the safety and efficacy of these drugs."
In these cases, Stafford determined that three-quar
ters of the off-label uses lacked substantial scientific
data to support the drug's use.
This means that the vast majority of prescribing
physicians lacked strong scientific evidence to justify
the medicine's use for that specific purpose, he said.
