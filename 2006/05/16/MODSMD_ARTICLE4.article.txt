## Off-label drugs often prescribed, study shows The 						practice may mean less safety and drug-testing precautions 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM STAFF WRITER 
Anyone who's been prescribed a drug at a doctor's
office has wondered, "But why this particular medi
cine?"
According to a recent study led by Randall S.
Stafford of the Stanford School of Medicine, doctors
often select medications without adequate research on
their effectiveness and safety.

When the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approves a medication, it approves it for specific indica
tions and uses.
However, "It is well-known that medications are
often used for conditions or diseases not covered by the
FDA indication," Stafford said in an interview with The
Daily. "We term that use 'off-label.'"
In an analysis of the top 1(X) drugs prescribed and 60
other commonly-used, randomly-selected drugs,
Stafford found that 21 percent of prescriptions were
off-label.
Off-label prescribing — while offering doctors
flexibility and innovation in treating patients — may
carry unknown risks. Furthermore, Stafford ex
plained that there are several different types of off

label prescribing.
"Some of these uses are virtually standard practice
but for one reason or another, the FDA has not ap
proved them for a secondary indication," he said. "On
the other hand, there are other off-label uses which
often are based oft scant information, where we have
concerns about the safety and efficacy of these drugs."
In these cases, Stafford determined that three-quar
ters of the off-label uses lacked substantial scientific
data to support the drug's use.
This means that the vast majority of prescribing
physicians lacked strong scientific evidence to justify
the medicine's use for that specific purpose, he said.
Stafford is quick to point out, however,
that FDA approval is not the be-all-end-all
on the appropriateness of a drug's prescrip
tion. Sometimes, drug companies are reluc
tant to undergo the expensive process of
gaining FDA approval for secondary uses
of a drug — particularly if its use for such
purposes is already prevalent. In addition, if
a drug has gone to generic production, it
lacks a "corporate advocate" who has the
resources to go back to the FDA for addi
tional approval.
According to Stafford, this means that
both physicians and patients are now "prac
ticing in an area where they have less data
to provide reassurance that the drugs are
safe and effective."
In recent years, there have been signifi
cant problems even with FDA-approved
drugs. For example, in 2004 the administra
tion recalled the prescription drug Vioxx

due to safety concerns.
Stafford pointed out that in such cases,
there had been "rigorous review" because
of the need for FDA approval. But in con
sidering off-label prescriptions, even less in
formation exists, and the same concerns
about effectiveness and safety persist.
Stafford added that there is a "mispercep
tion that the newest drug is the best drug."
Stafford emphasized that his study does
not discourage off-label prescribing alto
gether. He said he believes that if physicians
have tried standard therapy first and the pa
tient seems unresponsive, then off-label
prescribing can be a reasonable and innova
tive solution to the problem.
"Some types of off-label uses are benefi
cial, giving physicians the opportunity to in
novate and solve difficult clinical prob
lems," he added.
Stafford's study appeared on May 8 in
the Archives of Internal Medicine and was
conducted in collaboration with David C.
Radley of Dartmouth Medical School's
Center for Evaluative Clinical Sciences and
Stan N. Finkelstein of the Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology.
