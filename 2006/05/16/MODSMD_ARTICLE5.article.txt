## Hoyt delivers Knight talk D.C. Bureau chief forecasts bleak future for newsprint 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
Clark Hoyt, the Washington, D.C. Bureau
chief for the Knight Ridder newspaper chain,
painted a dim picture of the state of American
journalism during his talk last night, asserting
that the mainstream media must be vigilant to
remain relevant in the increasingly competitive
industry of information.
"TWenty-first century American journalism is
at a crisis," said Hoyt, the keynote speaker for
the annual John S. Knight lecture, held at Kresge
Auditorium. "We've got to be that defined voice
of reason that people can use."
The growth of the Internet has forced a de
cline in circulation and advertising revenue for
newspapers.The business model that guaranteed

independence in the past is "running out of
steam," said Hoyt. a Pulitzer Prize winner.
Also, today fewer Americans trust the main
stream media to objectively present the facts.
Hoyt faulted the Bush administration for curtail
ing access and punishing journalists who dare
question spoon-fed conservative talking points.
"Washington is at war with itself," he said.
"The mainstream media is caught in the cross
fire.
"Not since Vietnam and Watergate have rela
tions between the government and the press
been as strained as they are now," he added.
"Powerful forces are very much against our get
ting the truth and printing it."
Hoyt praised his bureau for its skepticism of
the administration's claims about Iraq's posses
sion of weapons of mass destruction even as
other elite news outlets accepted what White
House officials told them.
