## Hoyt delivers Knight talk D.C. Bureau chief forecasts bleak future for newsprint 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
Clark Hoyt, the Washington, D.C. Bureau
chief for the Knight Ridder newspaper chain,
painted a dim picture of the state of American
journalism during his talk last night, asserting
that the mainstream media must be vigilant to
remain relevant in the increasingly competitive
industry of information.
"TWenty-first century American journalism is
at a crisis," said Hoyt, the keynote speaker for
the annual John S. Knight lecture, held at Kresge
Auditorium. "We've got to be that defined voice
of reason that people can use."
The growth of the Internet has forced a de
cline in circulation and advertising revenue for
newspapers.The business model that guaranteed

independence in the past is "running out of
steam," said Hoyt. a Pulitzer Prize winner.
Also, today fewer Americans trust the main
stream media to objectively present the facts.
Hoyt faulted the Bush administration for curtail
ing access and punishing journalists who dare
question spoon-fed conservative talking points.
"Washington is at war with itself," he said.
"The mainstream media is caught in the cross
fire.
"Not since Vietnam and Watergate have rela
tions between the government and the press
been as strained as they are now," he added.
"Powerful forces are very much against our get
ting the truth and printing it."
Hoyt praised his bureau for its skepticism of
the administration's claims about Iraq's posses
sion of weapons of mass destruction even as
other elite news outlets accepted what White
House officials told them.

Clark Hoyt, the Washington, D.C. Bureau chief for Knight Ridder,
delivered the annual John S. Knight lecture. He spoke about the
relevance of print media in the twenty-first century.
"People at the top of the adminis
tration were of one mind," he said.
"We had to dig elsewhere to find in
formation."
Knight Fellowships Director and
Communication Prof. James Bet
tinger highlighted the newspaper
bureau's accuracy in his introduc
tion.
"Under Clark's leadership, the
Knight Ridder Washington Bureau
has achieved an amazing record of
skepticism of the administration's
claims about going to war in Iraq,"
he noted.
Hoyt speculated that other jour
nalists were so focused on getting
the story that they might not have
done all the necessary legwork to
check out the facts they were being
given.
"1 think some people were wor
ried about losing access and their
ability to get the inside scoop," he
said.
Hoyt said that Knight Ridder re
porters have at times suffered for
their assertiveness and independ
ence in questioning the administra
tion's claims. He said that his re
porters have been excluded "to
some extent" from traveling with
Cabinet-level officials for publishing
stories reflecting poorly on the ad
ministration.
During the subsequent question
and-answer session, Hoyt explained
how newspaper editors must decide
whether or not to include potential
ly dangerous information in stories.
"Early in the war before the in
vasion of Iraq, we knew that there
were U.S. military people already
operating inside Iraq," he said.
"And we decided not to report it be
cause we knew that was something
that could have literally cost peo
ple's lives."

Hoyt defended the use of anony
mous sources as a necessary evil,
adding that the news business has
worked hard to minimize their use.
But when it comes to national secu
rity, he argued, there are valid situa
tions in which people could lose
their jobs or go to jail if they go on
record.
"They are both toxic and neces
sary," he said.
When asked about the impact of
Internet Web logs, or blogs, Hoyt
said they have the potential to bring
important stories to the forefront of
public discourse. But blogs also lack
the credibility and standards of
mainstream publications, he said.
"Obviously we do monitor and
read blogs," Hoyt said. "The blogos
phere also makes big mistakes and
sends you off on a lot of trails that
lead nowhere."
Hoyt praised his mentor, Knight,
for his journalistic example and
media industry stewardship. He said
that delivering the lecture was a "bit
tersweet moment."
"The newspapers which carry his
name will soon cease to exist," he
said, referring to the planned merger
between San Jose-based Knight
Ridder and Sacramento-based pub
lisher McClatchy.
Knight, who won the Pulitzer
Prize in 1968 for editorial writing
during early opposition to the con
flagration in Vietnam, helped build a
newspaper empire and crusade for
racial justice and equality. Once,
Hoyt said, the patriarch of his parent
company put himself at great risk by
publishing a front-cover listing of all
prominent local members of the Klu
Klux Klan.
A symposium following up on
last night's lecture will be in held at
noon today at the Bechtel Confer
ence Center in Encina Hall.
Salon.com Editor in Chief Joan
Walsh and Political Science Prof.
Luis Fraga will join Hoyt on a panel
to discuss "News in An Age of Bush,
Blogs and Bombs."
