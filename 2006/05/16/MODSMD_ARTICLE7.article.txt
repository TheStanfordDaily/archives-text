While Stanford students bask in the
sunny climes here on Earth, Stanford sci
entists are busy understanding how the
sun causes a different kind of weather —
namely, solar flares and magnetic storms.
Todd Hoeksema, a senior research scien
tist at the Hansen Experimental Physics
Laboratory (HEPL), recently received
NASA's Distinguished Public Service
Medal for his work charting out the future
of heliophysics. or "sun-earth connection
science."
The award is NASA's highest honor for
non-government employees, and was given
to Hoeksema for his leadership in develop
ing a 30-year "roadmap" for heliophysics
research. A parallel award, the NASA Dis
tinguished Service Medal, is given to senior
NASA administrators, mission control
leaders, astronauts and other government
employees.
"I had no expectation of receiving spe
cial recognition, particularly NASA's high
est civilian recognition." Hoeksema said.
"It was quite an honor."
The study of heliophysics encompasses
the entire solar system — anywhere that
the sun serves as the dominant star, not in
cluding the Earth's atmosphere or sur
faces of planets and moons, according to
Hoeksema. The most relevant part of he
liophysics is the "sun-Earth connection,"
which describes how the sun. solar wind
and other elements interact with the
Earth's magnetic field to affect the plan
et's environment.
This interaction between sun and Earth
is responsible for aurora borealis, or north
ern lights — what Hoeksema called a
"symptom of how the Earth's magnetic
field is being disturbed by the solar winds."
The sun-Earth connection also has more
practical implications. It interferes with
technologies such as radio communication
and global positioning systems, also causing
"induced electrical currents" — meaning
that the Earth's magnetic field becomes a

source of blackouts.
"Satellites can be damaged or even de
stroyed by what we call 'space weather' —
a term for how things in space vary in the
way that they affect us," Hoeksema said.
"People usually think of the sun as that 'big
thing' up there that always stays exactly the
same. But it actually changes a bit, and
those changes affect us here on earth."
Hoeksema said that the sun has its own
weather, caused not by an atmosphere like
that on Earth, but by magnetic fields.These
fields store huge amounts of energy, which
is released in the form of solar flares and
coronal mass ejections. Solar flares are
powerful explosions on the sun's surface —
the most powerful explosions in the solar
system. In a coronal mass ejection, clouds of
material are expelled from the sun's atmos
phere, reaching speeds of up to a million
miles per hour.
Solar flares and coronal mass ejections
can significantly affect human life on earth.
For example, radiation from solar flares can
change the atmosphere, causing radio
wave interference.
"When airplanes are traveling far from a
transmitter — for example, at the North
Pole — they lose contact with the ground,"
lioeksema said. "If they know that there's a
solar storm coming, they can reroute."
Solar storms typically occur at the peak
of an 11-year cycle. Hoeksema's research
interests lie in understanding why this cycle
exists, and how the Earth's magnetic field
responds to it.
"My interest is in the sun and its magnet
ic field," he said. "Why is there an 11-year
cycle, and how does material from the sun
travel from the sun to the earth?"
To study this, Hoeksema and colleagues
at HEPL have launched satellites such as
the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI),
which has been measuring the sun's mag
netic field at its surface for the past 10 years.
In an effort to dive past the sun's surface,
they are working on the Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager (HMI) that will measure
sound waves coming from inside the sun.
These can provide information about the
sun's rotation, temperature and composi
tion.
"Think about a glass: if you 'ping' the
glass with your finger, you can tell if it's full
or empty just by the pitch," Hoeksema said.
Hie information learned from HMI and
other projects will help scientists make bet
ter predictions about the solar cycle and

solar storms, which are just starting to be
made, he explained. However, while he said
data on the sun has improved dramatically
over the past 30 years, forecasts remain
contradictory at best.
Hoeksema's role in creating goals for
the next 30 years of heliophysics research
should help enrich existing data, if not
make predictions more precise.
"NASA makes a long-term plan every
few years to figure out what missions to
launch in order to solve what questions are
out there," Hoeksema said. "I was leading
the effort to make a 30-year plan for helio
physics. We tried to figure out what the
main science questions are and which were
most important — the hardest part.
"The thing that really drove us was try
ing to see where we could make progress,
and what things would affect the earth in
ways that would disrupt technology and be
helpful to people," he added.
Another important reason for this work
is the protection of astronauts, who can be
come very sick if sent out during a solar
storm. This is a particularly important con
cern for NASA, as it tries to accomplish the
space exploration goals set by President
George W. Bush in January.
The roadmap that emerged from Hoek
sema and others' efforts include plans to
measure how the sun's magnetosphere ac
celerates particles to dangerous levels and
to examine the non-uniform way in which
the Earth's ionosphere responds to solar
storms. Other missions will send satellites
to take ftiree-dimensional and high-resolu
tion pictures of the sun.
"I know that the roadmap exercise took
at lot of Todd's time and I am sure that his
dedication to it and the work he did at
NASA is widely appreciated," said Hoeke
sema's colleague, Jesper Schou, a senior sci
entist at HEPL.
"The roadmap project I led was very
much a team effort and, while it certainly
had its difficult parts, I mostly enjoyed
doing it and felt that it had gone well. It did
n't seem like a sacrifice that merited a
medal," said Hoeksema, who — except for
four years at NASA's Washington D.C.
headquarters — has worked continuously
at Stanford since he entered graduate
school in 1978. "I've done other things for
NASA too over the years, and just felt that
my contributions were a way of helping the
sun-earth connection scientific community
function."
