# Graduate Life
## The 						four best Commencement speeches 
### 
Like hundreds of other Stanford graduate
students, I will be donning my $57 rental
cap and gown on June 17. It's a memo
rable moment for many as they finish one chap
ter of their lives and start another. It's a com
mencement, a beginning of something new for
them. Not so much for me, as I will continue liv
ing the PhD chapter of my life for a fifth year. So,
the only interesting part of my master's gradua
tion will be fun, frolic, food and the Commence
ment speech.
Ah. the Commencement speech: The unsus
pecting graduates never know what's going to
hit them. Will it be short and sweet or long and
torturous? Will it subtly plant inspiration or will
motivational quotes be shoved down our
throats? Will it be humorous? Here is a collec
tion of the best Commencement speeches I
have heard about.

Steve Jobs—Stanford University,
June 12, 2005:
This CEO's speech is to Commencement ad
dresses what the iPod is to mp3 players. It is ar
guably one of the best commencement speech
es I have heard. Every time one of my acquain
tances comes across the talk's text, he very
thoughtfully forwards it to me. And I, for the
love of the speech, reread it. Comprised of only
of three short stories, the speech was delivered
with amazing sincerity, simplicity and straight
forwardness by a man who never actually grad
uated. His words were as unornamented as the
jeans and sandals he wore under his robe. He at
tacked the University's compulsory courses and
high fees and poked fun at Windows. He even
chucked barbs at Apple's former board of direc
tors: "How could you get fired from a company
that you started?" His matter-of-fact tone was as
much a part of the story as the lessons he
learned from every pitfall. Scattered throughout
his anecdotes were gems of wisdom: "Your time
is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's
life," and "You've got to find what you love.
Don't settle." He finished up the speech with the
powerful message from The Whole Earth Cata
logue: "Stay hungry, stay foolish."

Russell Baker—Connecticut College,
May 27, 1995:
The Pulitzer Prize-winning writer known for
his satire-packed "10 Ways to Avoid Mucking
Up the World More Than It Already Is" into his
15-minute speech. Most of his practical advice
like "sleep in the nude," "fear the automobile"
and even "don't take your gun to town" is
rarely heard in other traditional Commence
ment speeches. The 10th piece of advice is
probably one we all could use: "Smile." He also
attacked politicians and newspaper columnists
trying to sell them, saying," You have never had
it so bad."
2.
Fadia Rafeedie—UC-Berkeley,
May 10, 2000:
No, she wasn't the main Commencement
speaker — that honor was reserved for then
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who
gave a largely predictable speech citing Ameri
can good deeds. Her advice: "Be animated by a
common spirit, like streams of fresh water flow
ing to the same sea; your inspirations and ener
gies giving life to a shared dream." Approxi
mately half the audience left the auditorium
during the speech. But the punch returned when
Rafeedie, a Palestinian student and the Univer
sity Medalist that year, put aside her proposed
Commencement speech to speak about sanc
tions on Iraq. She was brutally honest about the
origins of Saddam Hussein in U.S. policy and the
death of millions of Iraqi children due to the
sanctions. Albright had, predictably, left during
Rafeedie's speech.

Winston Churchill—The Harrow School,
October 29, 1941:
This one is my absolute favorite, as it's prob
ably the shortest Commencement speech on
record, and yet the most powerful I have en
countered. After a few opening remarks, he
capped it off with the words: "Never give in.
Never give in. Never, never, never —on noth
ing great or small, large or petty, never give in,
except to the convictions of your own honor and
good sense."
