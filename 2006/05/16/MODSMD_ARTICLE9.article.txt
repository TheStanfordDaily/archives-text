Five graduates per year. The Stu
dio Art master's program at Stan
ford is highly selective, but for
good reason — these students are
extremely talented. Their abilities shine
through the Master's of Fine Arts Thesis Exhi
bition each spring, an opportunity for the de
gree candidates to showcase their innovative
and creative works. Moreover, this display is
part of every MFA studio art student's gradua
tion requirements.
Lisa Vestal, the Art Department publicist,
describes the month-long exhibit as an opportu
nity for students to present "the body of work
executed during program residency."
"It also enables students to demonstrate
what they have learned and acquired from their
coursework that is not limited to studio art
classes," Vestal says.
This year, the exhibition will feature the
work of five graduating students: Elaine Buck
holtz, Ala Ebtekar, Diane Landry, Brendan Lott
and Kristin Lucas.
Though the exhibit is mainly an opportunity
for the students to show off their progress and
unique styles of expression to their professors,
peers and families, it also provides an opportu
nity for the rest of the University community.
"For the larger community, the purpose is to
see high-caliber contemporary art and by ex
tension keep up on what is happening in the art
community," MFA candidate Brendan Lott
says."The artists in the MFA program have all
exhibited widely throughout the U.S. and inter

nationally, and will continue to do so.This is the
last chance for many people to see these artists
locally."
Vestal agrees, adding, "The artists in this ex
hibition are students of the MFA Studio Pro
gram....This is their opportunity to share and
give back."
The art includes contemporary pieces made
in a variety of materials and styles. The art
pieces to be showcased are selected in consult
with each student's faculty adviser. Program Di
rector David Hannah and Exhibition Curator
Gail Wight.
While the art spans the two years the artists
have spent at Stanford, they were still putting
the finishing touches on their most recent cre
ations last week.The exhibit promises an eclec-

tic collection of styles, materials and personali
ties, resulting in such projects as Lott's taxider
mied animals and Ebtekar's Iranian mythology
based baseball cards.
This exhibition has something for everyone,
and studeuts address topics and issues as diverse
as human frailty and technology, the merging of
cultures — Iranian and American — to the ob
session with car customization and whimsical
mechanical artworks, to name a few." Vestal says.
Lott has opted to work with more tradition
al materials for his final piece. F
