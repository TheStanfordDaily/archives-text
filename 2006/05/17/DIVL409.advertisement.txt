If you're at Stanford, we know you're smart. And a smart thing to do is to wear
a helmet when you're riding a bike. We know you're on a tight budget, so we're
appealing to your head — and your wallet. A^TlTrTirr^
Now you can buy a high
quality Giro or Bell helmet for
only $15 at the Campus Bike Shop
($35 normal retail)\ For details, check the websites below^^j^l
And always wear a helmet when biking! jfisSmßl M
