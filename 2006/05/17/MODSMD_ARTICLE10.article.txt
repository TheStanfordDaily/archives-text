## Sophomore College admits next batch "Perennial favorites" are highly competitive once again 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
With the recent release of Sophomore College
decisions, hundreds of freshmen learned they will
have the unique opportunity to spend three weeks
studying a single topic and working closely with a
renowned professor.
The program is an important part of the Stan
ford experience, said Sharon Palmer, director of
Freshman and Sophomore Programs.
"The program," she wrote in an email to The
Daily, "aims to encourage students to explore a
topic in depth in a focused setting, to create close
mentoring relationships between students and fac
ulty and to introduce students to University re
sources at an opportune moment in their college
career. In general, we hope that it will help launch
students into a successful sophomore year."
Sophomore College, or SoCo, consists of nearly
twenty courses,each enrolling 12 to 14 students. This
year over 50 percent of the applicants were admit
ted to the competitive program, which takes place at
the end of summer break from September 4 to 22.
The most popular programs this year were "the
perennial favorites," Palmer said. The two courses
with the most applicants were Institute for Inter
national Studies Director Coit Blacker's Ameri
can Foreign Policy in the Twenty-First Century
and Biological Sciences Prof. Stuart Thompson's
Natural History, Marine Biology, and Research.

which is held at the Hopkins Marine Station.
Palmer pointed out that there are several new
courses this year, which will be taught or co-taught
by faculty from the Chemical Engineering, Music,
Economics, Film Studies. History. Political Science
and Symbolic Systems departments. Such diversity
attracts a wide variety of applicants, she said.
"Our recruiting aim," she continued, "is to get
faculty who are both excellent teachers and lead
ing scholars, and whose subjects are a good fit for
the Sophomore College structure and add breadth
to the overall curriculum. It is a significant commit
ment at a busy time of year, so the fact that so many
very busy faculty participate is a testament to how
rewarding the faculty find teaching these courses."
Prof. Kristine Samuelson. Director of the Film
and Media Studies Program, is a first time SoCo
teacher. Her course will focus on documentary
film making.
"I was intrigued by the opportunity to spend
an intensive period with students on a topic I'm
passionate about and to get [students] intro
duced to international documentary early in
their education here at Stanford." she said.
"They'll need the remaining three years to look
at all the wonderful films in the library that we
won't get to in the course."
Rev. Scotty McLennan, dean for Religious
Life, teaches a course called The Meaning of Life.
"Students often say that Sophomore College
was [their] most intellectual and personal experi
ence at Stanford," he wrote in an email to The
Daily. "They get to know a professor well, inside
and outside of the classroom, and they often bond
closely with other students in the class — leading

to continuing relationships, class reunions, etc. In
my class, many students genuinely come away with
a clearer personal understanding of the meaning
of life, for which they are usually very grateful."
Sophomore Matt Martin attended the SoCo
class Reform of Social Security, which was taught
by Prof. John Shoven, the director of the Stanford
Institute for Economic Policy Research. He said
the class offered a unique experience unavailable
during the normal school year.
"It's not nearly as stressful as a regular class,"
Martin said. "Because it's only for three weeks and
you have only one class. So you can focus on it and
still have fun.
"It was an amazing experience," he continued,
"My class took us to D.C. to meet legislators and
policy experts. It was a great opportunity to do
basic economics research."
Sophomore College was free of charge until
2(K)2. Now students must pay a $S(X) fee in order to
attend. However, according to the SoCo Web site,
the fee is still highly subsidized. The total cost of
running the program is $1,3(X) per student, includ
ing tuition, room, board, books and travel.
Palmer pointed out that there is financial aid
available to further defray costs, including the re
imbursement of lost summer earnings.
"Students can check a box indicating that they
want to be considered for a full or partial scholar
ship toward the fee," she wrote. "And additionally
[they] can contact Financial Aid directly about
summer earnings replacement. Any summer earn
ings replacement is calculated and awarded by the
Financial Aid Office according to the student's
need."
