## Gaming expo offers look at upcoming Nintendo, Sony consoles Mainstays as well as newer entries keep the industry abuzz with anticipation for next generation 
### SAM BHAGWAT DESK EDITOR 
Last week, Los Angeles hosted the
Electronic Entertainment Expo
(E3), the world's largest trade show
for the computer and video game in
dustry. This celebration of all things
gaming featured conferences on top
ics ranging from fighting piracy to
creating interactive narratives, as
well as the roll-out of many hotly an
ticipated games and consoles.
Grabbing attention were an
nouncements on mainstays like the
Final Fantasy and Mario series, as
well as newer phenomena like mo
bile gaming and its broadening ca
pacities: a game for cell phones based
on The Da Vinci Code will be rolled
out soon. But when Nintendo and
Sony rolled out plans for their new
consoles, all eyes were on them.
The new Play Station 3 will offer a
motion-sensing controller, "3-di
mension acceleration information"
alongside its three-dimensional axis
of pitch, yaw and roll, announced
Sony in a press release. It will not fea
ture the Dual Shock technology be
hind controller vibration because it
interfered with transmitting infor
mation. The PS3 will also be "back
wards compatible," running all
games designed for the PS and PS2.
But the changes aren't all prom
ising. Sony drew heavy criticism for
the PS3's price tag — a lower-end
version will priced be $499, with the
higher-end version at $599. Numer
ous critics all voiced the same opin
ion, that Sony would price many in
terested gamers out. In response,
Sony's President and Chief Execu
tive Officer Kaz Hirai responded
that the bells and whistles offered on
the PS3 — features like its advanced
processor and Blu-Ray high-defini
tion player — made it "a good
value." Other features on the PS3 in
clude a 60GB hard drive. Wi/Fi tech
nology and a memory-card slot on
the $599 version; the $499 version
boasts only a 20GB hard drive and
no wi-fi or memory-card support.
Sony plans a launch of 2 million
machines on November 17, with an
other 2 million reaching stores by

December 31.
Nintendo, which plans to release
its own new Wii (pronounced "we")
console sometime towards the end of
the year, emphasized the contrasts
between Sony's approach and their
own. Nintendo President Satoru
Iwata, in fact, made pointed remarks
at his rival,commenting in an Associ
ated Press story that "the approach
to make more gorgeous-looking
graphics...to have the horsepower, to
have much faster processing —
they don't do anything to ask
nongamers to play with a video
game."
Iwata elaborated in the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer that while Nin
tendo would "like to be No. 1, we
think the important thing is whether
we've increased the number of peo
ple playing games and whether
we've succeeded in breaking down
the barriers to people playing in
their homes."Though the formal an
nouncement of what the Wii will
cost is not until summer, there was
much speculation that Wii would
cost only $249 — far below the
PS3's price tag.
While Nintendo gave fewer details
than Sony on technical specifica
tions, it did say that while the Wii
would have 512 megabytes of memo
ry, much less than the PS3, it too will
be backwards-compatible with
games designed for previous plat
forms like the N64, and in addition
boasts Bluetooth technology — a
feature only present in the $599 PS3.
And tech blog Engadget ranked
Wii's television-remote-like con
troller over Sony's more traditional
model.
Still, while the competition at E3
between the rivals seemed at times
intense, all models demonstrated last
week are still in beta versions: how
gamers reacts to their final versions
in six or eight months will be the ulti
mate measure of their success. And
one hopes that both consoles ulti
mately achieve the goal that Iwata
set for his company:
"Nintendo's mission is to try to
make people happy, to try to make
people smile," he told the Associated
Press.
