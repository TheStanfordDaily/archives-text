## Editorial The 						CDC: A woefully underused resource 
### 
The Career Development Center
(CDC) is a campus resource all stu
dents should be familiar with. Unfortu
nately, this is not the case. Freshmen, sopho
mores and even some juniors barely know
about the CDC and the services it offers.
This is a shame, because the CDC pro
vides many resources that can be of tremen
dous help to students searching for summer
internships and fulltime jobs. The CDC's li
brary has the most up-to-date guides to help
you in your job search. Whether you're look
ing for alumni contacts or a list of job offers
in your field, staff members are ready to help
you with the aid of the Center's extensive
databases. Meanwhile, the Shadow Program
allows you to spend time alongside an alum
nus in the profession you are thinking of en
tering. And if you have no clue about what
you'd like to do after college, the CDC offers
a host of personality and aptitude tests that
might help you explore your options.
One of the main reasons students don't
make good use of the CDC is that it is poorly
integrated into the network of campus re
sources. In order to become an integral part
of students' sphere of reference, the CDC
should advertise its services even more ag
gressively during New Student Orientation.
Sophomore College and Honors College as
well as in freshman dorms.
More importantly, the CDC should con
tinue to improve on the quality and range of
its services. Currently, its campus recruitment
program. Cardinal Recruiting, focuses heavi
ly on investment banks, consulting firms and
other large companies. While this is good
news for students looking for glamorous
summer internships or high-powered finan
cial careers. Cardinal Recruiting should seek
out job opportunities available at smaller
firms in a variety of fields. It should also work
more closely with the Haas Center for Public
Service to provide career information to stu
dents interested in related fields.
Some students think that the CDC is not
critical enough when reviewing resumes and

cover letters â€” staff members briefly glance
over them and correct a few mistakes in
grammar and formatting. In contrast, when
students ask working professionals for ad
vice on their resumes, they get more direct
advice about the content and presentation of
their application materials. Staff members
would do well to acquaint themselves thor
oughly with the demands of particular indus
tries and to be more candid with students
seeking their advice.
Many students start using the CDC's serv
ices during their junior year in the process of
looking for a summer internship. But for stu
dents who have never used Cardinal Recruit
ing, the process can be bewildering. Some
students are clueless about the application
deadlines, which can come as early as Janu
ary, while others find it hard to keep track of
deadlines if they study abroad in the fall. To
ameliorate these problems, the CDC could
send more frequent email reminders to all
juniors informing them of important dead
lines and providing them with information
about Cardinal Recruiting. Similarly, they
could send all prospective seniors an email
during the summer providing similar infor
mation.
And while the staff at the CDC is friendly
and knowledgeable, many of them are gener
alists who are less equipped to respond to
specific questions about particular jobs. To
make up for this shortcoming, the CDC has
launched the Stanford Alumni Mentoring
program, expanding its network of alumni
members to include more practicing profes
sionals. We applaud the CDC for its tireless
efforts to improve the range of job options
available to students.
A career development center is indispen
sable for any university. But until the CDC is
better integrated into the network of campus
resources, it will continue to be underuti
lized. We are excited about the tremendous
potential that the Center has and hope that
our suggestions will help it realize this un
tapped potential.
