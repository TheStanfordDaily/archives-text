# Scheduling leisure time
## 
### 
All travel can he categorized as one of
two types: a TRIP, during which we
make sure to go everywhere and see
everything to get the most out of what a lo
cation has to offer, or a VACATION, which
will be a relaxing, leisurely diversion from
the stresses of daily life.
When I travel with my extended family,
this contrast is always especially clear. Rep
resenting the I-Haven't-Seen-Paris-Unless-
I've-Seen-Every-Major-Landmark School is
my father, whose greatest frustration is to
waste his high noon with a sit-down lunch.
On the other side we have my grandparents,
whose day in Paris might be a brief stroll
through a favorite museum, followed by a
leisurely lunch, a bit of shopping, a stop for
tea and then a rest before an unhurried sup
per.
Given these varied interests, when we
travel as an extended family we usually part
ways for the days activities. And I must
choose which of these two paths 1 want to
pursue. If I've seen a site before or don't
have particular interest in it, then the choice
is easy. But it's not always that simple.
Because really. I'm a hardcore planner at
heart. According to my Myers-Briggs per
sonality type — Introverted, Sensing, Thin
king. Judging (ISTJ), for those keeping score
— I excel at organizing and defining realistic
plans that can be carried out systematically.

So even when I'm enjoying more laid-back
vacation activities, like shopping and dining,
I'm well-prepared. I know what neighbor
hoods I want to wander, which stores I need
to hit and where dinner reservations will be
made that night. Indecision makes me want
to die. (Where should we go for dinner? I
don't know, what do you want? Oh. whatev
er you want is fine. Well. I don't know...) My
leisure time has to be fully scheduled.
When I was nine, my immediate family
embarked on a three-and-a-half-week cross
country RV trip, and since we were going to
be stopping at Disney World, we bought a
guidebook for ideas. I read that 6(X)-some
page book cover-to-cover and then adapted
my own detailed itineraries for how we were
going to spend each of our days at the
sprawling Disney parks. Since then. I've pur-
