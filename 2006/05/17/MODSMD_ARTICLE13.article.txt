# Scheduling leisure time
## 
### 
All travel can he categorized as one of
two types: a TRIP, during which we
make sure to go everywhere and see
everything to get the most out of what a lo
cation has to offer, or a VACATION, which
will be a relaxing, leisurely diversion from
the stresses of daily life.
When I travel with my extended family,
this contrast is always especially clear. Rep
resenting the I-Haven't-Seen-Paris-Unless-
I've-Seen-Every-Major-Landmark School is
my father, whose greatest frustration is to
waste his high noon with a sit-down lunch.
On the other side we have my grandparents,
whose day in Paris might be a brief stroll
through a favorite museum, followed by a
leisurely lunch, a bit of shopping, a stop for
tea and then a rest before an unhurried sup
per.
Given these varied interests, when we
travel as an extended family we usually part
ways for the days activities. And I must
choose which of these two paths 1 want to
pursue. If I've seen a site before or don't
have particular interest in it, then the choice
is easy. But it's not always that simple.
Because really. I'm a hardcore planner at
heart. According to my Myers-Briggs per
sonality type — Introverted, Sensing, Thin
king. Judging (ISTJ), for those keeping score
— I excel at organizing and defining realistic
plans that can be carried out systematically.

So even when I'm enjoying more laid-back
vacation activities, like shopping and dining,
I'm well-prepared. I know what neighbor
hoods I want to wander, which stores I need
to hit and where dinner reservations will be
made that night. Indecision makes me want
to die. (Where should we go for dinner? I
don't know, what do you want? Oh. whatev
er you want is fine. Well. I don't know...) My
leisure time has to be fully scheduled.
When I was nine, my immediate family
embarked on a three-and-a-half-week cross
country RV trip, and since we were going to
be stopping at Disney World, we bought a
guidebook for ideas. I read that 6(X)-some
page book cover-to-cover and then adapted
my own detailed itineraries for how we were
going to spend each of our days at the
sprawling Disney parks. Since then. I've pur-


Morissa
Klein

Ridiculosity
chased three subsequent editions of
that guidebook (Bob Sehlinger's
"Unofficial Guide to Disney World,"
if you're looking for a recommenda
tion) and have become far more so
phisticated in my planning for later
Disney trips. My master itinerary for
a week-long trip in 2001, for exam
ple, was 10 typed pages (single
spaced, of course) and featured not
only a sequence of attractions but
also dining suggestions and occa
sional notes on bathroom opportu
nities.
Sure, the level of planning I find
necessary for Disney World may be
unusual. But really, if you visit during
the most crowded times of the year
and you know there are so many at
tractions you want to see, you can ex
perience a lot more if you're pre
pared beforehand. And perhaps I
can take it overboard, like when I in
sist that we arrive at the park gates a
half-hour before the 8 a.m. opening
to be sure we are there in time to run
to our first ride with the other hard
core fans (you haven't lived until
you've stampeded to "Space Moun
tain" as the opening rope drops,
alongside thousands of stroller
wielding soccer moms at a full run).
But my family totally appreciates
how I maximize the efficiency of our
enjoyment. They affirm this every

time I interrogate them.
In general travel, though. I'm
(usually) more laid back. After all,
travel writers always tell you that
your vacations should consist of a
combination of seeing the sites and
soaking up the atmosphere. It's just
tricky to find the right balance. Or,
maybe in trying to capture this pro
portion, I'm already over-thinking?
There are a lot of great stories to
tell about spontaneous happenings
during past travels. But I'd still
rather have a schedule to help plan
all the fun that's to come. And unless
it's a matter of a Disney World bath
room stop that will waste precious
minutes during the crucial early
morning rush (I've never really for
given my brother for that one time
he slowed us down with an untimely
bathroom break at Disney's Epcot
Center five years ago), I'm perfectly
happy to change plans and go with
the flow as necessary.
So when my family embarks on
another big vacation in June, I can
happily choose to shop for Italian
leather goods with my grandparents
instead of running up each of
Rome's seven hills with my parents.
But as we wander the rambling
streets of boutiques, we will know
full well where we're headed and
when we'll be leisurely lunching.
