# Wow, Powwow

### 
Being a Bad Wound isn't always easy.
Sure, to outsiders it might look like my
family legacy is filled with high status,
elite privileges and rewards, but the truth is
that our reputation is slightly less classy than it
might appear on the surface. We're generally a
very approachable bunch, even if the name
does seem to be a little intimidating at first.
I do take pride in the fact that my last name
is not only two words, but contains an adjec
tive and a noun. How many people can say
that? Plus, it's always fun when people get con
fused and call me "Mr. Wound" and I have to
politely interject and say,"Excuse me. it's Bad
Wound."
Better yet is when people ask me, earnest
ly. "Is Bad your middle name?" Instead of
awkwardly saying, "No. it's actually Charles...
'Bad' is just the first word in my last name," I
usually say YES and glare. It makes me look
like more of a badass than I really am. Or. if
that's redundant, more of an ass than I really
am.
The name also functioned as a compound
noun in college when my buddies would say
things like: "Hey Bad Wound, want some
ranch dipping sauce with those spicy Buffalo
wings?" Grammatically speaking, we Bad
Wounds are fascinating and we know it. Jeal
ous much?
People often ask if there's a story behind
my last name. To which I usually respond.
"Yeah, you should see the other guy!" If they
don't get the joke, I occasionally say, "It's bet
ter than Dead Wound, right?" There have
been times in my life when I've cared less
about telling the truth, so I'd tell wild stories
about how one of my ancestors was killed in a
particularly violent or disturbing way, or I d go
on at length about a particular medical condi

tion in an attempt to make them regret asking.
It's not like 1 go around asking people,"Oh,so
your last name is Johnson.Tell me more!"
I always think it's interesting when people
hear my last name and ask,"Oh, is that Native
American?" to which I subtly roll my eyes and
say, "How could you tell?" But the truth is I
usually get quite a kick out of having a unique
last name. I love the fact that after 1 get my
Ph.D. Ill forever be known as Dr. Bad Wound
— a factor that provides about 80 percent of
my motivation not to drop out of grad school
when 1 get completely stressed out. If I were to
become a medical doctor, it would be even
cooler. Then again, I might not get many
clients.
This weekend, however, I took a little bit
more pride in being a Bad Wound than usual
as I strolled through Eucalyptus Grove at the
35th Annual Stanford Powwow. The event,
which drew over 30,000 visitors to our campus,
is not only the largest student-run Powwow in
the nation, it's an excellent opportunity to
connect with a culture that is often quite for
eign to me at Stanford (that being, my own).
There have been many times this year
when I've been discouraged after seriously
contemplating what it means to be a Native
American graduate student at Stanford. At
times I feel that the University Administra

tion is way ahead of peer institutions with re
gard to the ways that it embraces its Native
American student community. At other times,
though, it feels like the majority of the invest
ment is in undergraduate programs that in
crease my alienation. The Native American
Cultural Center, based on my experience,
does not do enough to celebrate and support
its graduate community. In fact, my involve
ment in the NACC felt so futile that I've com
pletely disconnected my affiliation with the
center, gathering support and encouragement
from students and friends instead of program
administrators.
But the Stanford Powwow is something
quite different. While it is student run, it brings
together our students, faculty, staff and alum
ni. opening our arms to the broader Native
American world. It means a lot to me to know
that such an event has a place on this campus.
This weekend I was proud to be a Stanford
student, a Native American, a Lakota and a
Bad Wound.
As I shoveled an Indian Taco down my
throat and watched the fancy dancers, I could
n't help but feel a bit more at home here on
"The Farm" (don't get me started on how
much I object to that term, lest I get in anoth
er fight with the whack-jobs at the Stanford
Review and make even more enemies across
campus). This past weekend I was able to look
past all the negative experiences I've had
being a Native American grad student at Stan
ford.
The pride I tasted was delicious, just like
the Indian Taco in my mouth.
