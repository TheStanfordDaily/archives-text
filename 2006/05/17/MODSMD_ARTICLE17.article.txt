End the Blame Game — the first
step to Peace in the Middle East
Roei Kashi. in his op-ed ("The only way
to Middle East peace". May 16), wrote the
following golden words:
"It is time to understand the mistakes
that have been made in the last 50 years."
Golden words indeed. It makes one
want to imagine the effects such a sentence
would have had on the conflict if all those
involved (and if not all, then at least most)
had repeated those words every morning,
whether it be in Arabic or in Hebrew. Too
much disbelief needed for such a scenario?
Possibly, but for the moment, just assume
that had been the case. Would peace have
been achieved?
It would be nice to think so.
Unfortunately, mistakes have been made,
but more importantly, continue to be made.
Reflecting on Kashi's article makes one real
ize that the phrase "understanding the mis
takes" is just a subtle attempt at exonerating
oneself from responsibility. Does Kashi real
ize that one of the fundamental "mistakes"

in this conflict is being part of an unconstruc
tive blame game? Does he recognize that his
article was a prime example of this? What
exactly does he want to blame? Ideology?
Religion? The refugee problem? The Pales
tinians?
Does he really want to be part of this
blame game?
I too can sit and pontificate on who is to
blame. I can write an op-ed that blames
some other groups on campus. I can explain
how my grandparents "left" their home in
194K, and continued with their lives, as
Kashi does.
Yet I fail to understand how rehashing
the dialectic fault-lines set up by past gener
ations will help bring peace to the Middle
Hast. I low will such a strategy improve the
lot of those living in the region, who, up to
this moment, have had conflict as a constant
companion for the past 58 years?
Eventually, Kashi and others will realize
that this blame game is unproductive and un
constructive.'lhey will realize that the refugee
problem is not the main obstacle to peace (if
only it was — things would have been much

simpler). They will realize that "understanding
the mistakes of the past" implies having a long
introspective look and understanding the mis
takes of their past as well as their present. 1
would like to think that they will realize this
soon.

Editorial Board's attack on ResEd is
unfounded, "blatantly offensive"
It is so fashionable to take a shot at Res
idential Education these days. But the fact
is the staff members of ResEd are out there
every day and they're charming.
As such, I was wholly disappointed with
yesterday's editorial ("ResEd's policies fall
short of the mark") lamenting Residential
Education's policies. The tone with which
the editorial snubbed the genuine and well
meaning efforts of a stellar staff was non
chalant, immature and disrespectful.
Although the Editorial Board is publicly
disenchanted with dorm programming.

meal plans and the acronyms of staff mem
bers assigned to each residence hall, nearly
every well-adjusted student has found a way
to take what he or she needs from ResEd
and move on. Engagement with ResEd ac
tivities is a personal choice.
Worse than this disenchantment,howev
er, is the blatantly offensive charge that
ResEd does not reach out to victims of date
rape or eating disorders. The reason that
few people hear about such outreach is that
it remains the private business of victims
and their support networks.
Finally, consider that without program
ming and dorm food, students would have
fewer neutral issues to complain about so
cially. Who hasn't made a new friend during
orientation by decrying a lame dorm event
or the sub-par pad thai? The Editorial
Board shouldn't forget that if Stanford stu
dents didn't love bonding over mediocre
university institutions, they'd have no read
ership.
