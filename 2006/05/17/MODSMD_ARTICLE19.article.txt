## Limiting Crown Library use is reasonable 
### J. PAUL LOMIO 
Before 1989, undergraduates were not permit
ted into the Law Library unless they were here to
"do legal research." All undergraduates were in
terrogated as to the purpose of their visit.
In 1989 the Loma Pieta Earthquake tossed
about 90,(XM) books off of our shelves; the earth
quake's dynamics sent them flying all over the
place. An army of undergraduates joined forces
with us to carefully reshelve each book. Our de
facto policy then switched to open access, after
being touched by so many undergraduate angels.
An official policy change occurred after the
first floor was remodeled in 2(X)3. The law school
dean at the time wanted to preserve this special
place for law students, and she effected an access
policy that the reading room was for law student
use only.
Two years ago, our new dean, Larry Kramer,
came on board. Dean Kramer expanded law li
brary access by lifting the reading room restric
tion. He did this, in part, because of his vision of
having the law school integrated with the rest of
the university, as he explained in a memo to the
students:
"As legal education everywhere becomes more
interdisciplinary we need more from the Universi

ty and need to be able to participate in various
University programs and initiatives. Both immedi
ately and in the long run, the Law School as a
whole, but especially the students, have more to
gain by being an integral part of the larger Stan
ford community than we do from remaining sepa
rate."
Most non-law students visit the library not to
check out books (such access will never be imped
ed), but to study Our library's reading room is
basked with glorious California sunshine; there
are power outlets everywhere; the room is filled
with comfortable Aeron chairs.
As a result of our new open access policy, the
reading room has at times become overcrowded.
There have been occasions when the room was
fully occupied, with 75% of the students being
non-law students. This presents an obvious ten
sion.
Hie library is also "home" for take-home
exams. Law school grades are typically deter
mined by one exam for each course. This exam
can be an 8-hour "take home" exam, during
which students set up shop in the library. During
exam times, it is critical — essential — that stu
dents have a quiet place to study and unimpeded
access to a computer and printer. This is the rea
son why many law schools, even those at public

universities, are restricted to law students during
exam periods.
In order to balance needs, and to ensure law
students have the space they need to study for and
take exams, a compromise has been struck: The
law library's study facilities are restricted to law
students during exam times while the collection
remains available to all members of the Stanford
community. This policy is essentially the same as
Harvard Law Schools and Yale Law School's, and
much less restrictive than that of our friends across
the Bay. At U.C. Berkeley's Boalt Hall, undergrad
uates may visit the law library only Monday
through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., and this is en
forced by a uniformed guard. 1 do not want to do
anything like that here.
The Stanford Law School Library is a happy
place to work. We librarians enjoy working with
undergraduates; it makes our jobs more fun . We do
not want to "ban" undergraduates. We are just ask
ing for a reasonable compromise during the high
stress law school exam periods, at least until we can
expand the law library's capacity On May 20th, I
hope you all come back; everyone with a Stanford
ID will be more than welcome.
