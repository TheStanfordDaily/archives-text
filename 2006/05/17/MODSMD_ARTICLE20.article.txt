## Students should be open to serious discussion 
### LUUKAS ILVES 
In response to Aaron Qayumi's lament in that
there are not enough conservative voices for Stan
ford students to engage with ("There aren't
enough Republicans to argue with," May 15), 1
propose the admissions office adopt a new policy
of conservative action.
On their application, Stanford applicants
should list their political party affiliation and
rank themselves on a political spectrum from left
to right. Dean of Undergraduate Admissions
Richard Shaw could then use this information to
admit a more politically diverse class. Stanford
could perform background checks to prevent ap
plicants from falsely claiming conservative be
liefs.

But lowering standards for conservatives
would create an even greater intellectual stigma
and feelings of resentment from liberal students.
Instead, Stanford would need to recruit the best
and brightest conservative students away from
schools like Duke and Princeton. We could offer
conservatives special Condoleezza Rice scholar
ships, in addition to funding a Conservative Com
munity Center and a Conservative Studies depart
ment. In order to make conservatives more com
fortable, Stanford would have to hire and quickly
tenure dozens of Republican faculty members.
And to make the campus more accepting, we
would have to institute strict rules against political
intolerance. Heckling, abusing or making conser
vatives feel uncomfortable would be violations of
the Fundamental Standard.

If Stanford students really want a campus that
is intellectually and ideologically more diverse,
they need to be more open to serious discussion
and engagement. You will find many have nuanced
and sophisticated opinions (and some don't). Not
only would abandoning knee-jerk reactions bring
more conservatives to campus, it would also bring
to fore the incredible diversity of opinion that al
ready exists on this campus but does not dare
speak its name.
Finally, Mr. Qayumi should note that, contrary
to his opinion, SLE life is exciting, precisely be
cause it does engage in such active intellectual en
gagement and questioning.
