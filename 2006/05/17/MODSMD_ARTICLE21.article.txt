## Red-hot Cud push streak to seven Eight-run fifth lifts Card out of 6-0 hole to 11-7 win; sophomore rightfielder Michael Taylor 5-for-5 in first career five-hit game 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
It's been a rollercoaster season for the Stanford baseball
team, but right now it seems that the Cardinal can do no
wrong.
After pulling off a dominating three-game sweep of
Washington (33-23,9-12 Pac-10) on the road this weekend,
Stanford entered their matchup against visiting Santa Clara
(28-26) yesterday evening riding the momentum of a six
game winning streak.
But for the first half of the game, it might have been hard
to believe that the Stanford squad (28-21,10-11 Pac-10) on
the field had actually been playing red-hot baseball as of
late.The Broncos put three runs on the board in the first be
fore building a 6-0 lead after four innings. Nevertheless, the
Cardinal rallied for eight runs in the bottom of the fifth and
held on to claim the wild 11-7 victory.
Santa Clara wasted no time getting things started in the
top of the first, taking advantage of two Stanford errors and
three hits to plate three runs.
Then in the second, another Stanford error and a hit bats
man loaded the bases for Santa Clara cleanup hitter Kris
Watts. Cardinal reliever Sean Ratliff was unable to escape
the jam unscathed, as Watt worked a walk that gave the
Broncos their fourth run of the evening.
Two innings later, Santa Clara gave a rude welcome to

Stanford hurler Erik Davis, who had entered the game in re
lief of Ratliff. The Broncos' No. 9 hitter, catcher Carl Bacon,
started the inning by taking Davis long for his second homer
of the season. Santa Clara leadoff man Kevin Drever then
doubled before coming around to score on a single from
Daniel Nava.
But at the end of the day, it was Davis who had the smile
on his face â€” thanks to senior shortstop Chris Minaker and
freshman first baseman Jason Castro.
After Davis settled down to toss a 1-2-3 shutdown fifth.
Minaker and Castro both stepped up to jack clutch long flies
in the Cardinal's monster eight-run bottom of the inning.
Minaker's blast came with two aboard and tied the score at
six apiece, and Castro followed three batters later with a
two-run shot of his own that gave the Cardinal the lead for

good.
Prior to Minaker and Castro's dramatics, it was junior
leftfielder Jim Rapoport (RBI single) and senior catcher
John Hester (2 RBI double) who came through with run
scoring hits that brought the Cardinal back within striking
distance of the Broncos. And by the end of the inning, Stan
ford had all the offense they would need for the rest of the
evening.
Sophomore David Stringer came on to throw two score
less innings, surrendering only one hit and one walk. Senior
Matt Manship came on to close out the victory, entering with
a five-run lead in the top of the eighth. Although they got to
Manship for one run in the eighth, the Broncos went quietly
