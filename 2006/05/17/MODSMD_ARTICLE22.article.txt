## Surprising NCAA invite for women Men finish fourth in Pac-10 standings, women finish fifth 
### JOHN CHOCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The seats in the Stanford open-weight
skiff are made of carbon fiber, but they felt
a lot more like pins and needles to the
women who rowed in them this weekend —
until yesterday, when the Cardinal learned
that they had met their season goal: an invi
tation to the NCAA tournament May 24-26
in New Brunswick, N.J.
The news came as something of a sur
prise after their season-best performances
at the Pac-10 regatta Sunday put the Card
only at fifth in the league. But early-season
victories over Ohio State and Tennessee
worked to Stanford's advantage.
"I thought we needed to come in third or
fourth [at Pac-lOs] to get an invite," head
coach Aimee Baker said. "But thanks to the

strength of the West and our racing out of
the region all year, we were able to do it."
"I don't think I'm surprised," Baker said.
"I'm just excited for the team because they
worked so hard."
Baker's varsity four rowed to third place
in the Pac-10 final, on Lake Natoma in
Sacramento, Calif.The first and second var
sity eights both took fifth. California swept
all three women's races, holding off tremen
dous charges from Southern California and
Washington State in the final meters of the
varsity eight race.
"The Pac-10 is probably one of the
strongest regions in the country this year,"
senior captain Sam Magee said. "It was def
initely tough competition."
The Cardinal men, who are ranked third
in the nation, posted a second-place finish in
the varsity eight event and took fourth in the
Pac-10 team standings.
"Our team competed extremely well and
raced for the championship with passion,"
men's head coach Craig Amerkhanian said.

"Cal would not be denied, and earned their
hard-fought victory."
Hie Cal victory literally came from be
hind, with the Bears overtaking a fast-start
ing Stanford 1.000 meters into the race.The
boats finished with times of 5:39 and 5:42
minutes, respectively — fully thirty seconds
faster than their performances in the wave
swept Big Row on April 29. Washington fin
ished third in 5:47.
"We executed our first 1.000 meters very
effectively, getting out cleanly at the start
and taking seats on Cal during our moves,"
senior captain Jake Cornelius said. "We
were up during the second 500 meters, but
Cal managed to move back and grab the
lead after the 1,000-meter mark. You have
to give Cal a lot of credit for the race they
rowed."
Cornelius and his crew have their eyes
set on a strong finish to the season at the na
tional regatta. June 1-3 in Cherry Hill. N.J.

Women's crew dug in this weekend at the Pac-10 Regatta. Both varsity eights finished fifth in the conference — one of the strongest leagues
in the nation.
"The competition Cal has given
us this year will put us in good stead
when we go to face the East Coast
crews," Cornelius said.
In Saturday's Pacific Coast Row
ing Championships, also on Lake
Natoma, Stanford's lightweight
women lost their bid for a sixth
straight title to league newcomer
Central Florida.
The Golden Knights, who are
from Orlando, Fla., used a measured
start and a strong move in the final
I,(XX) meters to derail the defending
champions.
"We had an unusually rough
start," head coach A 1 Acosta said.
"Once we finally got going, we were
able to put our bow ahead of the
pack for a bit, but I think we expend
ed too much energy in our effort to
get the lead."
UCF mounted a chase and fin
ished eight seconds ahead of the sec
ond-place Card.
The lightweights will joust with
the Golden Knights once more, at
Cherry Hill in two weeks time.
