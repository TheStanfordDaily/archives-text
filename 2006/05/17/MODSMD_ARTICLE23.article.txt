# There's more to sports than Barry
## 
### 
As the "Bonds Watch" enters
what feels like Day 1,633,1
have decided that 1 can't
take it anymore.
It isn't that I don't care about the
Giants or what Barry does at the
plate, but enough is enough.
Enough of the live look-ins of every
Barry at bat. Enough of the "Chas
ing Ruth" graphic that comes up
every time that the Giants scores
come up.
Enough is enough. If he was
moving into first place I would un
derstand and tolerate it, but for sec
ond this is simply out of hand. If
only Juan Pierre had let that ball go
over the fence.
In protest of the ridiculous cov
erage that this is getting, I will re
fuse to watch the first five minutes
of Sports Center, because regard
less of how the Giants fared or what
Bonds did, we must watch each
pitch thrown to Barry.
The fact of the matter is there
are many more interesting and im
portant sports stories out there.
Here is a brief sampling of what is
more relevant than Bonds' attempt
to pass Ruth, in no particular order:
The NBA Playoffs: Despite what I
have previously said about the
NBA Playoffs. I would still rather
watch the Mavericks and Spurs

What Bonanza!
duke it out than see a highlight of
Bonds walking. How these high
lights get bumped behind the
Bonds story each night is a total
mystery to me.
Albert Pujols hitting a billion
homers in April and May: Why is no
one paying attention to this story?
The man has 19 homers in 37
games, while batting .333 and
knocking in 48 RBl's.
The WNBA season is about to
begin: 1 hear the Detroit Shock are
the favorites to win it all this year.
The NHL Playoffs: Even if no one
in America cares, the interest in
Canada pushes this one way over
No. 714.
Justin Gatlin breaks the 100-meter
record: The fastest man alive is get
ting bumped by Barry moving into
second. It is just unfair.This used to
be one of the most coveted records
in sports and now it gets the respect
of the Bass Masters.
The Great Khali defeats the World
Champion Key Mysterio on
Smack Down: 1 hear that it was a
whooping. Mysterio never stood a
chance. (A side note: Visiting
wwe.com is hilarious and disturb
ing at the same time.)
Stanford Baseball sweeps Washing
ton: The Card have won a season
high seven straight games. It wasn't
even close up in Seattle â€” three
straight blowouts. Just giving credit
where it is due. Heck, you can even
get in the action by listening to my
broadcast of this weekend's series
at UCLA on KZSU, 90.1 FM or
kzsu.org.
1 am a huge Bonds supporter,
but please, let's move on. When he
hits No. 714 and 715, then we can
talk about it. But for now, every
time I see a clip of Bonds flying out
to shallow right field I'm changing
the channel. There must be a
WNBA game on somewhere.

If you have a story more interesting
than Bonds not hitting a homerun, let
Alex know at agyr@stanforil.edu.
