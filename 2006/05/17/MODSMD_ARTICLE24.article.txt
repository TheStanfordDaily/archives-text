# WOMEN'S GOLF
## Second, third round scores ensure NCAA bid Mari Chun highest Stanford finisher; frosh places 13th 
### BY CARSON COOPER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
To advance to the NCAA Champi
onships, Stanford women's golf knew they
would have to turn in a strong performance
in this weekend's Regional tournament.
And true to form, they responded with their
best performance of the year.
The No. 19 Cardinal finished fourth in
the NCAA West Regional, securing a bid to
the 24-team NCAA Championship in the
process. The team finished with a 32-over
par 896,15 strokes behind No. 7 Purdue.
After shooting a 303 in the first round,
Stanford found itself tied for seventh place
— a perilous position against the strongest
field they've faced this season. With only the
top eight finishers advancing to the NCAA
Championships, the team could ill afford

any mistakes in the final two rounds.
But instead of caving under the pressure,
the Cardinal came back firing, with a domi
nating performance on the second day.
ITie Stanford women rattled off a 295 on
ITiursday, one stroke off the 294 pace set by
Purdue as the top round of the day. Leading
the charge was freshman Mari Chun, who
shot a one-under-par 71, seven better than
her 78 the day previous.
Chun's outstanding second-round effort
lifted the Card to fourth place heading into
the final round of competition. But more
importantly, it meant that they needed only
to maintain their position in the field in
order to advance to NCAAs.
The team didn't disappoint on Friday,
and used a conservative game plan to shoot
a combined 298 and advance to the NCAA
Championship for the 18th consecutive
year.
Washington senior Paige MacKenzie
took home individual honors with an eight
under 208.
Pac-10 Champion UCLA took second
in the Regional, followed by No. 23 Wash
ington. Also advancing to the Champi
onship from the West are No. 6 Georgia,
No. 14 UNLV, No. 20 Arizona and No. 10
Arkansas.
Chun was the top finisher for the Car
dinal, as she finished tied for 13th with a
223. Junior Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana
tied for 17th with a 225, while junior Lau
ren Todd tied for 24th with a 226. Fresh
man Ki-Shui Liao's 227 was good for
27th, while senior Kelly Husted carded a
231 to tie for 40th place.
Stanford now turns its attention to the
Championships, running May 23-26 in
Columbus, Ohio.
The four-day NCAA competition will
be the longest of the year for Stanford, a
squad used to three-day tournaments. At
the tournament, hosted by Ohio State,
they will face a daunting field filled with
the NCAA's top stars.
The favorite for individual honors is
freshman Amanda Blumenherst of No. 2
Duke. The top-ranked collegiate golfer in
the nation, Blumenherst has already won
three tournaments on the year. Challeng
ing Blumenherst will be Southern Cali
fornia senior Irene Cho, the Pac-10
Golfer of the Year and winner of the
NCAA Central Regional.
Favorites for the team title include
Duke and Pac-10 powers UCLA, Arizona
State and USC.
The Cardinal will look to improve on
last year's 19th place finish in the Cham
pionships.
