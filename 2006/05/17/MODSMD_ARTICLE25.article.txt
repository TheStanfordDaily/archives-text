to earn its first national championship since
2002 this Memorial Day weekend at the
2006 UFA College Championships.
"We've got a couple more weeks to pre
pare,"'senior Jack Kuecker said. "But I'm
very excited about the way the season has
gone so far. 1 think we struggled a little bit in
the beginning, but we've really come on
strong in the last few weeks."
