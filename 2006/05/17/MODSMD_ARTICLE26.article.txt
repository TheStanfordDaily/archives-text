## Pac-10 repeat denied by ASU McLain makes Pac-10 history with double wins; Men take seventh

Professional teams routinely g£>
through rebuilding processes, but
college teams have it far worse. With
athletes limited to four years of com
petition, turnover rates are always
high, making it especially difficult to
maintain a consistent level of suc
cess.
'Hie Stanford's women's track
team, however, isn't letting rebuild
ing get in its way. Last year, the Car
dinal produced five Pac-10 Champi
ons at the conference meet, and of
the five, sophomore Erica McLain
was the lone returnee to this year's
squad. Nevertheless, the team has
had remarkable success this season
and nearly came home with another
Pac-10 team title.
This year's Pac-lOTrack and Field
Championships were held at Hay
ward Field, home to the Oregon
Ducks. Last season, the Stanford
women ended UCLA's eight-year
hold on the title and were looking to
begin a streak of their own.
But after the first day of competi
tion, the women were in third —
more than 40 points behind leader
Arizona State. The highlight of the
day was McLain's performance in
the long jump, in which she beat out
top-ranked Lauryn Jordan of Ore
gon. Her jump of 21-5 1/4 placed her
second in school history, and was a
top collegiate effort nationally.
The following day though,
McLain made history by leaping 44-
2 1/2 feet to win the triple jump and
finish with two titles. It was the first
time in Pac-10 history a female ath
lete had won two events for two
years in a row.
"It is definitely a great feeling to
win both events in two years,"
McLain said. "Let's come back next
year and do it again."
The Cardinal had two other
women win titles this weekend. Ju
nior Arianna Lambie won the 1,500-
meter title with a time of 4:15.65. She
became the third Stanford woman to
win the title, joining Sally Glynn in

2001 and Melanie Bloch in 1990.
Sophomore Chauntae Bayne-
Hackett added another record to her
impressive list of accomplishments
on her way to the 4(X)-meter title.
Bayne-Hackett ran the race in 52.35
seconds, breaking the previous
record of 52.40 seconds set by
Nashonme Johnson two years ago in
2004. In the same race, Johnson fin
ished third with a time of 53.2 sec
onds.
Yet, despite her success running
the 400. Bayne-Hackett is a reluctant
long sprinter. She strained her ham
string two weeks ago doing block
work, and the trainers advised
against running races with explosive
starts, such as KM) or 2(H) meter races.
"We decided 1 could still fare well
without having a good start," Bayne-
Hackett explained.
Senior Sarah Hopping did not win
the hammer title, but she handily im
proved upon her personal best by
adding over eight feet to her throw.
The distance of 219-8 feet is now the
new school record.
"Every meet is a chance to see if I
can do something better than before
and get closer to the goals that 1 have
set for myself," Hopping said. "I can
only control what I'm doing in the
ring, and 1 have spent a lot of time fo
cusing on the technical elements of
the throw."
But, despite the individual efforts,
injuries and event switches con
spired to hand Stanford a narrow
loss. As Arizona State topped Stan
ford 154 points to Stanford's 151.5,
Director of Stanford Track and Field
Edrick Floreal credited the team for
its hard work in making up the early
40-point deficit.
"I am very impressed with the
way we came back," Floreal said. "It
says a lot about the championship
caliber of our team."
Meanwhile, the men's team fin
ished just seventh overall — a step
down from the sixth-place effort of
last year. Sophomore Russell
Brown narrowly missed claiming
the 1500-meter title, as Arizona's
Robert Cheseret overtook him on
the final lap. Brown finished with a
season-best time of 3:43.49 min
utes. and the team finished with 60
points.
Stanford has been selected to host
the Pac-10 Championships in 2007.
