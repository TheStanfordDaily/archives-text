## Students want more South Asia Groups mount grassroots effort for more representation of culture 
### ANNY LIN STAFF WRITER 
South Asia conjures exotic images of the Taj
Mahal, rich spices and colorful saris. However, a
growing number of students on campus hoping to
learn more about the region are finding their aca
demic needs unmet. To rectify this, Sanskriti, the
South Asian cultural group on campus, is taking
steps to bring up the shortcomings in South Asian
studies with the University.
Senior Ankit Garg, co-chair of Sanskriti, re
calls feeling disheartened by the lack of coverage
of South Asian issues. He worries about the impli
cations that the dearth of course offerings may
have on people's attitudes about the region.
"Students like myself who have come in want
ing to take classes about South Asia have been
disillusioned by the lack of options," he said. "This,
1 feel, results in apathy about the topic."
According to junior Supriya Misra, the other
co-chair of Sanskriti. hardly any classes are of
fered on South Asian topics, except a few in the
Religious Studies, English and Cultural and Social
Anthropology Departments.
"I think it is appalling that we have absolutely
no coursework pertaining to South Asia in the his
tory, economics, and political science depart
ments," Misra said. "South Asia contains some of
the rising powers of our time and is home to about
one-fifth of the world's population."
The South Asian region encompasses the
countries of India. Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka,
Bangladesh and Bhutan. Accordingly, South
Asian studies would involve every aspect of this
area â€” history, economics, politics, culture and re
ligion.
"The region is economically dynamic, techni
cally advanced and has several interesting chal
lenges of population, education, rural-urban di
vide and security," said Rafiq Dossani, senior re
search scholar at the Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Re
search Center, part of the University's Freeman
Spogli Institute for International Studies. "It is
also one of the most densely populated regions
and accounts for about 20 percent of the world's
population. Hence, Stanford should be deeply en
gaged with South Asia as an integral part of its In
ternational Initiative."
Stanford experimented with a University-wide
South Asia Initiative from 1999 to 2002 to sponsor
courses, research and outreach on South Asia.
