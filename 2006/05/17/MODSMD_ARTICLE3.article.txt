## Students want more South Asia Groups mount grassroots effort for more representation of culture 
### ANNY LIN STAFF WRITER 
South Asia conjures exotic images of the Taj
Mahal, rich spices and colorful saris. However, a
growing number of students on campus hoping to
learn more about the region are finding their aca
demic needs unmet. To rectify this, Sanskriti, the
South Asian cultural group on campus, is taking
steps to bring up the shortcomings in South Asian
studies with the University.
Senior Ankit Garg, co-chair of Sanskriti, re
calls feeling disheartened by the lack of coverage
of South Asian issues. He worries about the impli
cations that the dearth of course offerings may
have on people's attitudes about the region.
"Students like myself who have come in want
ing to take classes about South Asia have been
disillusioned by the lack of options," he said. "This,
1 feel, results in apathy about the topic."
According to junior Supriya Misra, the other
co-chair of Sanskriti. hardly any classes are of
fered on South Asian topics, except a few in the
Religious Studies, English and Cultural and Social
Anthropology Departments.
"I think it is appalling that we have absolutely
no coursework pertaining to South Asia in the his
tory, economics, and political science depart
ments," Misra said. "South Asia contains some of
the rising powers of our time and is home to about
one-fifth of the world's population."
The South Asian region encompasses the
countries of India. Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka,
Bangladesh and Bhutan. Accordingly, South
Asian studies would involve every aspect of this
area — history, economics, politics, culture and re
ligion.
"The region is economically dynamic, techni
cally advanced and has several interesting chal
lenges of population, education, rural-urban di
vide and security," said Rafiq Dossani, senior re
search scholar at the Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Re
search Center, part of the University's Freeman
Spogli Institute for International Studies. "It is
also one of the most densely populated regions
and accounts for about 20 percent of the world's
population. Hence, Stanford should be deeply en
gaged with South Asia as an integral part of its In
ternational Initiative."
Stanford experimented with a University-wide
South Asia Initiative from 1999 to 2002 to sponsor
courses, research and outreach on South Asia.
Dossani, who served as executive director of
the Initiative, said it resulted in six new courses,
four new research projects and a new seminar se
ries. Since 2002 however, the Initiative has been
dormant.
"I see a high level of interest in the humani
ties, particularly history, social anthropology and
education," he said. "There is also interest in the
social sciences, particularly in economic devel
opment. The interest from undergrads is mostly
in new courses, while grads and faculty would
like to see more research and outreach."
According to Misra, the lack of courses of
fered on South Asian studies has been a running
concern within the Sanskriti community, espe
cially in comparison to other universities of Stan
ford's caliber. As a result, the Sanskriti officers
drafted a proposal stating the group's main con
cerns and suggestions for what would best meet
undergraduate needs and interests.
The students involved in this effort through
Sanskriti said they hope to encourage course de

velopment in South Asian studies, spur greater
research in that area and bring speakers to cam
pus. Their long-term goals are ambitious. They
said they recognize that it will take a lot of time,
and the biggest challenge they face is acquiring
funding and hiring new and qualified faculty.
Misra acknowledged that South Asia is not
the only region of the world that deserves more
attention, but notes that the region is of growing
importance to economic and international rela
tions fields.
"There is a gross disparity in how we have
very developed programs in areas such as Euro
pean and East Asian studies and underdevel
oped programs in Middle Eastern and South
Asian studies," Garg said.
However, he believes that the shortage of at
tention to these areas by the University does not
have to be accepted. He said that the status quo
can be changed if enough students show interest
in expanded course offerings in certain areas.
"Students are in a unique position to help
change how the University approaches these
neglected areas," Garg said. "TTiey can take an
active position and get in touch with faculty and
express what they want. A lot of what the Uni
versity does depends on student interest."
