## Roble free of asbestos, housing says 
### ANDREW BURMON STAFF WRITER 
In recent years, asbestos, a potent car
cinogen which used to be considered a vi
able material for construction, has caused a
variety of health scares across the nation.
Such a scare hit campus this month as ru
mors circulated that the walls of Roble Hall
contained the deadly substance.
However, on May 8, Housing Services
sent an email to the Roble Hall list to stem
rapidly spreading gossip that asbestos in the
walls of the dorm might become a health
risk to the dorm's residents.
"We would like to emphasize that all of
Stanford's buildings, including Roble Hall,
are safe to work and live in," the e-mail stat
ed.
Imogen Hinds, the associate director for
I lousing Operations, said that the email was
prompted by parent concerns.
"We received a question from a student's
parent," she said. "So we contacted that stu
dent to make sure that the correct informa
tion was being disseminated and sent out
the attached letter to address any
concerns."
Fortunately the concerns were
ungrounded. Though Roble Hall
was once full of asbestos — which
was used for insulation and fire
proofing purposes — it was re
moved in 1989.
The rumor mill, however, was
not.
"I heard about it through word
of mouth," said freshman Wayne
Huang, a Roble resident.
The buzz may have been gener
ated by the possibility that some as
bestos might still remain within
Roble, students said.
Hinds admitted this might be a
possibility but stressed that "any as
bestos that is present in Roble is
completely encapsulated."
For her, the matter is settled.
It is also settled for Huang, who
acknowledged he was not overly
concerned with the matter.
