# CAMPUS EVENTS
## Pulitzer winner talks comic books, life Chabon talks with PWR students about his writing 
### ANDREW BURMON STAFF WRITER 
In 2(XX), after the success of his Pulitzer
Prize winning novel "The Amazing Adven
tures of Kavalier and Gay" Michael Chabon
found himself in possession of a household
name. Chabon, the author of "The Mysteries
of Pittsburgh," "Wonder Boys," and "Sum
merland," spoke to students last night at the
Writing Center, allowing them to put a face
with the name.
The evening's event was put in motion
when Chabon's good friend John Peterson,
an instructor in the Program in Writing and
Rhetoric (PWR), asked the author to come
and speak to his class,"The Rhetoric of Liter

ary/Arts Magazine." As a former guest editor
of "The Best American Short Stories" collec
tion and a two time guest editor of "Mc-
Sweeney's," Chabon was a logical choice to
speak.
During his talk at the Writing Center,
Chabon admitted to running the University
of Pittsburgh's literary magazine into the
ground during his undergraduate career.
"It never recovered." he said.
Chabon's work since has been more
warmly received by not only the public, but
also Hollywood. He spoke briefly about his
current job reworking a script for a live-ac
tion Disney remake of Snow White, which
will be directed by a martial arts choreogra
pher known for his work with Jackie Chan
and "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon." But
the substance of the talk was focused on his
views regarding what he called the "ghetto
ization"of the short story medium.
A champion of short stories of all kinds.

especially detective and science fiction,
Chabon urged the audience to see the short
story medium as less defined by genre.
"I like to look at guys like Italo Calvino
and Borges," Chabon said. " ITiey were right
on the lines where they couldn't be easily de
fined in terms of genre."
It was his interest in providing a forum for
such stories that led to his guest editorship of
McSweeney's, a job he was offered after he
gave one rant too many in favor of demarca
tion in literary short fiction to Dave Eggers,
the then-editor of the magazine.
"In an effort to shut me up, he said why
don't you take an issue," Chabon recounted.
"1 le told me to do what I want with it."
The result of the collaboration, "Mc-
Sweeney's Mammoth Treasury of Thrilling
Tales," was worth the risk for Eggers.The col
lection included the work of such influential
writers as Stephen King and Joyce Carol
Oates.

Prompted by Peterson's questions,
Chabon continued to talk about how pre
conceived notions of genres had affected his
career as a writer. He cited Raymond Carver,
the famous mystery writer, as an early influ-

ence. He also cited the comic
book lore that became in
tensely tied to "The Amazing
Adventures of Kavalier and
Clay," in which the main char
acter, Sam Clay, aspires to
great literary fame but works
as a comic book writer.
"He's the opposite of you,"
remarked Peterson, referring
to Chabon's recent work cre
ating a real version of Sam
Clay's fake comic "The Es
capist."
Chabon also talked about
the marketing for his books,
particularly Kavalier and
Clay, which only became a hit
after the cover art was
changed from a comic book
motif to a picture of the Em
pire state building.
"Readers were turned off
by the comic book thing,"
Chabon said. "It was a mar

keting thing."
At the end of the talk the
floor was opened up to Peter
son's students and others in
attendance, including Andrea
Lunsford's reunited FWR
class from winter quarter,
which had studied comic
books.
Students asked about his
work and his influences. Sam
Urmy, a sophomore from
Boston, asked about how
Chabon had thought to inter
sperse Norse mythology with
Baseball lore in his children's
novel "Summerland."
"I had wanted to write a
Baseball novel since I was
eleven," said Chabon. "It
seemed natural to use Norse
and Native American mythol
ogy"
Urmy was content with the
answer and with the Chabon's
presentation in general.
"I've read many of his
books and really enjoyed
them," Urmy said. "Tonight
he lived up to my expecta
tions."
