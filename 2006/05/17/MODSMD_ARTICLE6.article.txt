## Pulitzer winner talks comic books, life Chabon talks with PWR students about his writing 
### ANDREW BURMON STAFF WRITER 
In 2(XX), after the success of his Pulitzer
Prize winning novel "The Amazing Adven
tures of Kavalier and Gay" Michael Chabon
found himself in possession of a household
name. Chabon, the author of "The Mysteries
of Pittsburgh," "Wonder Boys," and "Sum
merland," spoke to students last night at the
Writing Center, allowing them to put a face
with the name.
The evening's event was put in motion
when Chabon's good friend John Peterson,
an instructor in the Program in Writing and
Rhetoric (PWR), asked the author to come
and speak to his class,"The Rhetoric of Liter

ary/Arts Magazine." As a former guest editor
of "The Best American Short Stories" collec
tion and a two time guest editor of "Mc-
Sweeney's," Chabon was a logical choice to
speak.
During his talk at the Writing Center,
Chabon admitted to running the University
of Pittsburgh's literary magazine into the
ground during his undergraduate career.
"It never recovered." he said.
Chabon's work since has been more
warmly received by not only the public, but
also Hollywood. He spoke briefly about his
current job reworking a script for a live-ac
tion Disney remake of Snow White, which
will be directed by a martial arts choreogra
pher known for his work with Jackie Chan
and "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon." But
the substance of the talk was focused on his
views regarding what he called the "ghetto
ization"of the short story medium.
A champion of short stories of all kinds.

especially detective and science fiction,
Chabon urged the audience to see the short
story medium as less defined by genre.
"I like to look at guys like Italo Calvino
and Borges," Chabon said. " ITiey were right
on the lines where they couldn't be easily de
fined in terms of genre."
It was his interest in providing a forum for
such stories that led to his guest editorship of
McSweeney's, a job he was offered after he
gave one rant too many in favor of demarca
tion in literary short fiction to Dave Eggers,
the then-editor of the magazine.
"In an effort to shut me up, he said why
don't you take an issue," Chabon recounted.
"1 le told me to do what I want with it."
The result of the collaboration, "Mc-
Sweeney's Mammoth Treasury of Thrilling
Tales," was worth the risk for Eggers.The col
lection included the work of such influential
writers as Stephen King and Joyce Carol
Oates.

Prompted by Peterson's questions,
Chabon continued to talk about how pre
conceived notions of genres had affected his
career as a writer. He cited Raymond Carver,
the famous mystery writer, as an early influ-
