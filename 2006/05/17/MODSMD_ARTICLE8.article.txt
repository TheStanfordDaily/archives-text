## Trading Wide Open Spaces Swaptree offers free, simple bartering service for books, CDs, DVDs. 
### SAM BHAGWAT DESK EDITOR 
Perhaps it won't reach the same pop-culture
status, but when CNNMoney calls the new
bartering service Swaptree the "eßay of
swap," you know there's something important
going on.
Founder Greg Boesel came up with the idea of
building a site allowing people to trade used media
like books and CDs after he finished reading Dan
Brown's best-seller The Da Vinci Code. He didn't re
ally want the book anymore, but he didn't want to
bother selling it online for a few bucks either.
In addition, Boesel and his fellow founders noticed
that "their mothers were frequently trading books with
their network of friends, their nephews played a new
$55 dollar video game for a week or so, and then never
again, their shelves were filled with hundreds of CDs
and DVDs that weren't going to see the inside of a CD
or DVD player anytime soon, and the price of college
textbooks had gotten out of hand," according to Swap
tree's website. Realizing there was a niche market, they
then devoted themselves to trying to fill it.
One of Swaptree's special features is that it offers
not just two-person bartering, but three- and four
person trades. This means leaping technical hurdles:
the multiple recursive iterations necessary for finding
multi-person swaps requires immense processing
power. As an analogue, consider the Facebook engine
searching for connections between people. When it

displays mutual friends, all
it has to do is search
through each person's list
of friends and check if any
people are on both lists.
But to discover third-de
gree connections (friend
of a friend of a friend),
the Facebook engine
would have to execute
this process for every per
son on your friends list.

Shunning complexity
enables Swaptree to solve
such processing power prob

lems. It does not employ, as earlier
swapping services have, a complex
valuation scheme in searching for
viable trades. Swaptree assumes,
in contrast, that items for trade are

"all worth about the same to peo
ple who have already read, viewed,
or otherwise consumed them," ac
cording to a CNNMoney.com arti
cle. This simplicity helped Swaptree
to cut search times for finding four
way trades down from 20 minutes in

its original algorithms to 0.2 seconds now

Simplicity, indeed, is the basis for the entire online
bartering industry. Using Swaptree, you can get one
thing for another without the hassle of selling used
books, CDs, or video games on online marketplaces
like eßay or Half.com, shipping them, and finally
using the money to buy desired items. On Swaptree,
all you have to do is list the ISBN number of items you
have and want, and its algorithms will do all the work.
And as for mailing items, Swaptree even offers en
velopes and accurate postage. "Who has time to go to
the post office?" asks Swaptree's website. "Not us and
certainly not you."
While previous attempts at swapping services have

failed,
Swaptree
believes this

r simplicity will
be the key to
success. Consider

Palo Alto-based
Webswap, which of-

fered items as di
verse as CDs, comic

books and clothing. Their tactic was
to try to provide a venue for swap
ping absolutely everything from "po
tato-powered clocks, [to] hand-paint-

Ed eggs and coffee table books with
pictures of famous sword-swallowers with their pets,"
according to an archive of Web Swap's website. The
result? Webswap closed down in 2(X)3. Arguably, their
attempt to build an online garage swap-sale of eclec
tic items that few would be interested in helped seal
their demise.
But perhaps Swaptree's broadest appeal —at least
to college students — is that it is funded wholly by ad
vertising revenue, making it free for users. Buying
things on eßay and Half requires money, and such
services also take a cut of the purchase price when
you use them to sell stuff. The only place your money
goes to with Swaptree is the post office. And lighten
ing the load on your wallet is never a bad thing.
