## ENTERTAINMENT Grad student stars on PBS reality show Finkelstein lives in Texas Ranch House circa 1867 
### JULIE KLEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For cultural and social anthropology graduate
student Maura Finkelstein. "The Farm" conjures
up a different image than Stanford's palm trees
and sunny afternoons. Instead, she imagines
something more along the lines of, "110 degrees.
200 cows. 47,000 acres. And 15 people."
Finkelstein is one of the 15 who live and work
on a replica 1867 Texas ranch as part of the reali
ty series "Texas Ranch House," now in its third
season on PBS.
Finkelstein plays the girl-of-all-work, or do
mestic servant. According to the PBS web site,
she is "the lowest member of he ranch communi
ty, second only to Howie the dog." Her character
has just immigrated to America, and the ranch
family provides her with room and board in ex
change for her services cooking, cleaning and

working with the cattle.
Finkelstein's character on the show provides a
stark contrast to her real-life persona. Her PBS
biography describes her as "an intelligent and in
dependent Maryland native. She is fiercely opin
ionated, well read and well traveled." In addition,
she is "proud to call herself a feminist,.and she
says that she has a rebellious streak."
Finkelstein auditioned for the show while
working on her masters' degree in New York
City,. While she was in the process of applying to
PhD programs, a friend told her about the open
call audition, which she said led to an eerie paral
lel in her life.
"Auditioning was like applying to graduate
school," she said.
Finkelstein received her spot on the show the
same week that she got into Stanford. At the time,
she was not sure what path she wanted to take in
her life, and she figured that the show would pro
vide her with "one last hurrah."
"I was thinking,' What will I do with my life?"'
she said. "So I figured 1 would go on a TV show."
All of the actors were required to research

their roles prior to filming. While they attended
history classes in Texas, Finkelstein said she
thinks these classes alone did not provide suffi
cient background information for the characters
to fully immerse themselves in the 19th century
ranch lifestyle.
"We were asked to be 21st century film in a
19th century situation" she said. "We had to
move as close to the situation as we could."
While her acting experience was limited to her
high school's drama department, this did not pose
a problem as the actors were specifically told not
to act. The directors simply wanted them to be
themselves.
"There were scary moments," Finkelstein said.
"It is pretty stressful to only have 15 other people
for three months. Early on, the breakdown of the
community created tensions between the cast
members."
However, overall she said the show was a pos
itive experience.
"For me, it was more about the experience and
less about the TV show," Finkelstein said. "In ret
rospect, I am very happy that I did it."
