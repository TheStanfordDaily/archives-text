## Students ambivalent about recent muggings University administrators, police urge caution, many students unfazed 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
In response to the armed robberies on the nights of
May 10 and May 15, University administrators and the
Department of Public Safety have emphasized the
need for heightened awareness for all community
members. Even so,student opinion is mixed on the two
crimes, with some changing their habits and others

saying they feel no less safe than before.
Last Wednesday night, a female undergraduate was
held at gunpoint by two men in the parking lot outside
Toyon Hall. On Monday, a male graduate student was
similarly robbed by three men near the entrance of
Crothers Memorial Hall. In both cases, the students
were unharmed.
According to the University and Stanford police,
these incidents are the first armed robberies on cam
pus since 1998.
"This past week has seen an unusually high inci
dence of crime on campus and, of course, it is concern
ing for all of us," wrote Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Greg Boardman in an email to The Daily. "It is

important that students, staff and faculty alike be
aware of the recommended safety precautions and
make sure they are taking appropriate measures to in
crease their own personal safety."
According to Boardman, Stanford has "a strong
working relationship" with the Department of Public
Safety and is coordinating with Chief of Police Laura
Harrison to beef up campus security.
Ibe Department of Public Safety posted a commu
nity crime alert online with details about the two inci
dents and physical descriptions of the suspects, as well
as public safety reminders.
