# CAMPUS SECURITY
## Students ambivalent about recent muggings University administrators, police urge caution, many students unfazed 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
In response to the armed robberies on the nights of
May 10 and May 15, University administrators and the
Department of Public Safety have emphasized the
need for heightened awareness for all community
members. Even so,student opinion is mixed on the two
crimes, with some changing their habits and others

saying they feel no less safe than before.
Last Wednesday night, a female undergraduate was
held at gunpoint by two men in the parking lot outside
Toyon Hall. On Monday, a male graduate student was
similarly robbed by three men near the entrance of
Crothers Memorial Hall. In both cases, the students
were unharmed.
According to the University and Stanford police,
these incidents are the first armed robberies on cam
pus since 1998.
"This past week has seen an unusually high inci
dence of crime on campus and, of course, it is concern
ing for all of us," wrote Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Greg Boardman in an email to The Daily. "It is

important that students, staff and faculty alike be
aware of the recommended safety precautions and
make sure they are taking appropriate measures to in
crease their own personal safety."
According to Boardman, Stanford has "a strong
working relationship" with the Department of Public
Safety and is coordinating with Chief of Police Laura
Harrison to beef up campus security.
Ibe Department of Public Safety posted a commu
nity crime alert online with details about the two inci
dents and physical descriptions of the suspects, as well
as public safety reminders.
Students are encouraged to be
more aware of their surroundings,
walk in well-lit places and travel with
friends at night.
President John Hennessy also
sent an email Tuesday afternoon to
all students, faculty and staff, includ
ing information about the recent
robberies and safety suggestions.
"The safety and security of Stan
ford community members is of para
mount importance to the University
and its leaders," he wrote.
He added that he is working with
Harrison and the Office of Student
Affairs to ensure student safety and
awareness on campus.
Following the armed robberies,
the chief of police increased the
number of personnel on patrol. In
addition, the 5-SURE escort service
has expanded its services.
Some students said they are mak
ing efforts to be particularly cau

tious.
"I used to go outside and talk on
the phone with my parents at night,
but I don't anymore," said Ellen
Truxaw, a freshman.
Christian Tom, another fresh
man, agreed.
"I still feel safe on this campus,
but now I definitely think about it a
lot more before heading out to go to
the library at 11:30 p.m.," he said.
Others said they were relatively
unfazed by recent events.
"I've never felt unsafe, and I still
don't really feel unsafe," said Molly
Weiss, a freshman. "But maybe if I
were to be out late at night, 1 'd make
the effort not to be alone."
Sophomore Artit Wangperawong
said he was walking around Lake
Lagunita at night and would not
have been scared "except for all
these things telling me to be scared,"
he said, referring to the numerous
safety advisories.
Some students, however, said
they placed little faith in the police's
response.
"I don't feel any safer," senior
Krystal Quinlan said.
