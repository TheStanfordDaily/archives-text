## GSC addresses housing costs Council members debate on-campus versus off campus living situations 
### NICK PARKER DESK EDITOR 
The Graduate Student Council (GSC) convened
last night to discuss the future of Stanford Student En
terprises (SSE) — the business branch of the ASSU —
and to talk about a marked increase in graduate hous
ing costs for academic year 2006-2007.
Matt McDonald, who will replace Justin F r ishner-
Wolfson as the Chief Executive Officer and financial
manager of SSE effective July I. spoke to the Council
about the group's role and his vision for next year.
"Our goal is to provide long-term financial viability
for the ASSU," he said. "We are the entrepreneurial ac
cess point for students on campus."
McDonald explained that SSE is advocating for a
new location for the Stanford Store, which is currently
located in Tresidder Memorial Union. I le also spoke to
council members about the importance of SSE to grad
uate students in particular.
"Our interests are your best interests," he said. "At
the end of the day, we are pumping money into the en
dowment; all our money goes into the endowment,
and the endowment is what dictates your operating
budget."

After McDonald spoke about SSE, Linh Pham, a
graduate student in earth sciences, raised the issue of
housing. She explained that the increase in housing
rates between academic years 2005-2006 and 2(X)6-
2(H)7 is noticeably higher than the same increase be
tween academic years 2004-2005 and 2005-2006.
"I've been here for two years," she said. "This year
the increase in housing rate was between $30 and $50
per quarter, but next year's rate is going to increase a
lot more, like $ 100 to $ 160 more per quarter."
Pham said she enjoys living on campus, but worries
whether the abrupt increase in costs will force her off
campus.
"I really like living on campus, and 1 want to live on
campus the rest of my graduate life," she said.
Fishner-Wolfson explained that the increase in
housing rates makes living off campus cheaper than
on-campus housing, and that the graduate community
will suffer if students abandon Stanford housing as a
result of the increasing rates.
"You can live off campus for dramatically less
money than on campus," he said. "Increased housing
rates push more and more people off campus, and that
destroys the graduate community."
GSC Funding Committee Chair Adam Beberg, a
graduate student in computer science, reminded
Council members that the Graduate Housing Adviso
ry Committee (GHAC) is looking to separate housing
and utilities bills to make on-campus housing cheaper
for students who are more conservation-oriented.
