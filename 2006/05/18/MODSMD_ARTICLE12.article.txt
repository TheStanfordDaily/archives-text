## The 						(Glad) Game 
### 
When I came to Stanford nearly
three years ago as a newly-ad
mitted student, I had no idea
what to expect. My perception was that
Stanford was a school of snotty elitists and
over-accomplished athletes.
When I visited, I quickly realized what
a vibrant and welcoming student life Stan
ford had. Everyone was so friendly, so in
volved and such a part of the campus.
Iliough I hadn't planned on going to Stan
ford before I visited, I knew the second I
stepped foot on campus that it was the
school for me.
Why? Much of it had to do with the way
student life was organized around resi
dence halls. 1 liked having everyone on
campus mingling together in one huge,but
not too huge, social circle. Running into
people on campus all day long seemed fun.
Most importantly, I liked the idea of get
ting to know everyone in my dorm, be
coming friends and having a social life just
within the place I was living.
The Daily's editorial on May 16 got me
thinking about residential life, residential
education and whether one or both are
good. Ultimately, I'm not sure how impor
tant that answer is and I don't think it's
one upon which we can universally agree.
Early in the year, I had a conversation
with a friend about this topic. Although
both of us were residential staff members,
we nonetheless disagreed on how exten
sive residential education and "indoctri
nation" events such as New Student Ori
entation, the Game and Big Game Week
should be. She thought they were over
done and unnecessary for a lot of stu
dents who don't want to be herded
around like sheep.
I thought, and still do think, that such
events promote a collective spirit and ap
preciation for our University and our com
munity. Never have I felt prouder of Stan
ford than during Big Game Week, even
though we were crushed in the actual
game. The real accomplishment was not
scoring touchdowns, but rather the unity
and pride that our student body displayed.
But being part of Stanford, as I see it, is
being part of a collective, larger communi
ty. Stanford requires all students to live in
dorms freshman year because attending
Stanford is more than just taking classes
— it's a broader, bigger, shared experi
ence.
Hie University may require all of us to
enroll in a meal plan if we live in a dorm;
among other reasons, this allows such an
option to be affordable for those who can't
afford a car to get off campus or who don't
have the facilities or faculties to cook their
own meals. It's kind of like social security
— not everyone will need it. but we as a so
ciety agree we need to provide it, so we all
have a collective stake in its existence.
Arguments that at their essence con
clude "if you don't like it, go elsewhere,"
are generally unattractive and unconvinc
ing. Yet this is how I feel about Stanford.
Plenty of schools decline to provide the
rich (and sometimes stiflingly so) residen
tial educational environment that Stan
ford does and instead focus on organizing
undergraduate life differently, giving stu
dents more freedom and independence.
If you want to be on your own, create
your own social scene and never feel like
part of a herded mass, then reconsider at
tending Stanford. Sure, it's an amazing
school, but no one's pretending it's perfect
for everyone. Admit Weekend isn't de
signed to make every Pro Fro think Stan
ford is perfect — it's to trumpet Stanford's
finest qualities so they can see what it's
like to attend.
I can't imagine going to NYU and
being an invisible face, unlikely to run into
a single classmate over the course of an en
tire day. Many at NYU, I'm sure, would
never trade in literally hundreds of late
night cuisine options for exactly one at
Stanford: Late Nite. The beauty of the
world's finest university education system
is that we can all find what we like.
Ultimately, no university will be per
fect, and even I in my "blood-runs-Cardi
nal-red" love of Stanford have complaints.
But rather than focus my energies on what
I don't like, I've chosen instead to be glad
for what I have and to make the most of
Stanford's advantages. I'll take the foun
tain-hopping. the incredible weather and
beautiful campus, the incestuous but fun
social scene, the top athletics and the op
portunity to hang out with the kids down
the hall until 4 a.m.
When I first visited Stanford, I real
ized it was someplace that could totally
consume and envelop your independent
life.Three years later, I couldn't be happi
er to agree.
