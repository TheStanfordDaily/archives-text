# The
						Heart of the Matter
## PART ONE OF A TWO PART SERIES: An In-Depth Look at the Innerworkings of the Stanford Blood Center

Everyone needs it. Everyone has it. Almost
everyone can give it to someone else. And giv
ing it is one of the easiest things you can do.
These characteristics make blood one of the
most interesting commodities on the market.
The institution most students have probably donated
through is the Stanford Blood Center, a nonprofit or
ganization that provides blood to the Stanford Hospital,
the Palo Alto Medical Clinic, the Veterans Administra
tion and El Camino Hospital.
Even if students have donated before, there's proba
bly a lot about the process they don't know.
The Stanford Blood Center is in dire need of blood.
Despite recruiting efforts, donations from students have
fallen almost 50 percent over the past year, according to
Williams. At the same time, the Blood Center is facing
increasing demand, particularly from the Stanford Hos
pital, where demand rose 10 percent up from last year.
"What amazed me when I first started working here
is how small the inventory is," Williams says.
This shortage leaves the stock at the Blood Center
dangerously low, which could be catastrophic in the
event of a natural disaster, says Blood Center Assistant
Supervisor Kevin O'Neill, pointing to the sparse stock
on the refrigerated shelves. The Center is particularly
low on type O blood.
"We have to import 1 (X) to 150 units per week to keep

up with demand." he says.
One reason for the high demand is that Stanford
Hospital is #1 worldwide in kidney transplants. Trans
plants require large amounts of blood, about 2(X) units
for a liver transplant, for example.
Another characteristic that makes the Stanford
Blood Center unique is that a good portion of the blood
is used for research purposes.
"Many people don't distinguish between us and the
Red Cross," O'Neill says. "But the fact that we are a re
search center makes us stand out. We were the first to
develop an HIV screening test. We also developed the
test for CMV (cytomegalovirus)," a pathogen particu
larly dangerous for immuno-compromised patients and
premature babies.
The Blood Center also utilizes a number of new
technologies to streamline the donation process.
ALYX, a system that allows for automated blood col
lection, makes it possible for an individual to donate
more units of blood at a time. A larger donation means
that the contributor must wait longer before donating
again (four months rather than the usual 56 days)
which is good for one-time donors, like the high school
students the Center reaches out to.
Targeting the young student population is extremely
important to the Blood Center. Williams explains.
"If you haven't donated before the age of 25, you

probably won't," he says.
Some students don't donate because they are afraid
it might hurt or because of a general distaste for needles.
For others who are more sensitive, it can cause minor
health problems.
"I don't like getting my blood drawn." says freshman
Melissa Johnson."l get dizzy really easily."
"One reason we don't have more people donating is
the perception that it may be dangerous to donate,"
Williams says, assuring potential donors that this is not
the case, and that donor health is one of the Center's
main concerns.
Potential donors may also be turned away due to
health restrictions. Particularly at Stanford, Williams
notes, many travel to areas where they may be at risk of
contracting malaria or mad cow disease, conditions that
preclude blood donation.
Another major factor why people are turned away is
low iron, Williams says, suggesting Cream of Wheat as
one of the best ways to increase iron. "Even better than
spinach," he quips.
The Stanford Blood Center hopes to increase its stu
dent donations this year, through promotions on cam
pus offering T-shirts and a new online system, whereby
donors can accrue points for every donation that can be
used in their online store. Visit http://bloodcenter.stan
