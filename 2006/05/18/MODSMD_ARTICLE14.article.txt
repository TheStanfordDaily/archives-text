# Relay unites students, survivors in fight against cancer
## 
### SINI MATIKAINEN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford students and community mem
bers are in the midst of preparations for the
fifth annual Stanford Relay for Life, which
combines community bonding and enter
tainment with fundraising efforts for the
American Cancer Society.
The relay, to be held on the Roble field on
May 26 and 27, melds a walk-a-thon,
fundraiser for the American Cancer Society
(ACS), publicity generator and a chance for
community bonding into one hectic day-long
event. Stanford students can sign up online
to be part of the event. Some participants
camp out all night at the field, fundraising
beforehand and walking around the field.
Others show up the night of the event to take
advantage of the food and entertainment.
Beyond fundraising and raising awareness
for the ACS, the Relay also offers an impor
tant chance for community bonding for sur
vivors and participants.
Survivor Chair and senior Jonathan Chou
notes, "One of the greatest parts of the event
is when people who have either had treat
ment for cancer or are going through treat
ment get to meet up and become a resource
for one another...You never think of your
peers having cancer, but there are actually a

lot of people who have had that experience."
Chou speaks from personal experience,
as he himself was diagnosed with Hodgkin's
disease and treated at the Stanford Medical
Center while remaining a student. During
past Relays, he has used his experience to
offer advice and encouragement to those
currently undergoing treatment.
"It offers an opportunity to exchange re
ally personal information that the doctors
and nurses haven't necessarily had experi
ence with," he says."It gives a better insight
into the whole patient experience."
Those participating as team members
also benefit from the presence of survivors,
according to senior and Co-chair Cynthia
Lee.
"Relay for Life allows team members to
bond and to find strength and a sense of
community with others who have been
touched by cancer," Lee says. "Everyone is
so dedicated to the cause, and I have 'met
amazing, inspirational people who believe in
the power of community and who have sur
vived cancer themselves."
Participant Matt Rindsig, a sophomore,
agrees, saying that he is participating in
honor of classmates who have battled can
cer.
"My fraternity, Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
strongly supports this cause and participates

in this event because we have had close rela
tionships with two cancer-surviving SAE
members in the past few years and we recog
nize the tragic impact that cancer has on our
society," he says.
Survivors participate in a special walk
around the field, and everyone who has been
touched by cancer is invited to participate in
the Luminaria ceremony. For a contribution
to the American Cancer Society, luminarias
can be ordered online in honor of someone
currently battling cancer, someone who has
survived or someone who has lost their life.
After night falls, these luminarias — deco
rated bags with candles inside — are lit, and
participants take a solemn walk around the
track in what has been described as a very
moving part of the event.
Remembrance and solemnity are an im
portant component, but Chou notes that
Relay for Life definitely has a lighter side.
"It's an event that has two faces: on the
one hand it's a very serious event, since there
are people there who are getting treatment,
and the attitude is very solemn. On the other
hand, it's also supposed to be a lot of fun," he
says.
The event also features food and enter
tainment with performances by students
Jack Conte, the Gospel Choir, the Stanford
Improv group and off-campus bands such as

Peaceable Jones, Red Horizon and Nour El
Ain Dance Company. There will also be
competitions, such as ping pong and soccer
tournaments, board games and movies.
There will be 46 teams and roughly 500
team members camping out all night. So far
they have raised $33,769 raised for the
American Cancer Society.
With Relay for Life still more than a week
away, Co-Chair and senior Michelle Erdrich
says that there is still time to form a team.
"It is difficult to fundraise in a week, but
definitely possible. All people really need is
a small handful of people willing to fundraise
quickly and willing to attend the event. If a
team is not an option though, Relay for Life
is an excellent event to just come out and at
tend," Erdrich says.
Lee agrees, noting, "I believe Relay is
something all Stanford students should par
ticipate in before they graduate! Relay is an
amazing experience, and it's something you
can only really understand when you're
walking around the track lit by beautiful Lu
minaria candles, surrounded by others with
the same pure goal to band together to offer
support to one another."
