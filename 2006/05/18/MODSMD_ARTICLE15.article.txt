## Editorial SLE rages against the dying of the light 
### 
Every freshman can rally around the
common hatred of IHUM. Everyone
enjoys cracking jokes about Branner
and passing snide remarks about faraway
Freshman/Sophomore College. And every
one loves making fun of SLE.
The much-maligned Structured Liberal
Education program typically attracts vary
ing degrees of disgust and pity. Freshmen
who reveal that they live in East Flo (or Flo
rence Moore in general) are invariably
asked the same daunting question: "Are you
in... SLE?"
Many of us dismiss the phenomenon as
harmless fun. And indeed, students probably
don't harbor any real disdain for "SLE kids"
— just as they are unlikely to dislike their
peers in Branner or FroSoCo.
But in general, the stereotype that all
SLE kids are hopelessly antisocial fuzzies is
untrue. Not all SLE kids conform to this
image. Like any other campus group, the
program has its fair share of social butter
flies and computer science majors. Tarring
all of them with the same brush is simply un
fair.
Also, we can't help but wonder if this low
regard for SLE kids says something more
profound about our campus culture. Basical
ly SLE has earned a bad reputation for being
overly intellectual. Ironically, many of us got
into Stanford because we enjoyed being in
tellectual in the first place, and liked explor
ing new ideas in high school. Why then are
we so quick to denigrate a program that en
courages academic curiosity?
We believe that Stanford is a place where
people from diverse backgrounds can gather
to develop independent thinking and chal
lenge their own assumptions. It is an oppor
tunity for students to become intellectually
engaged with people and ideas in a meaning
ful way. And SLE does a good job to create
an atmosphere conducive to intellectual ex
citement and involvement.

Also, SLE gives Stanford a program com
parable to the core curricula at our peer in
stitutions on the East Coast like Columbia.
SLE kids study classics ranging from seminal
works of Western civilization like "Augus
tine's Confessions" and"The Communist
Manifesto" to Eastern texts like the "Bha
gavad-Gita" and"The Tale of Genji."
Unfortunately, there are always rumors
about the program's uncertain future. Some
are afraid that SLE will get lost amid
changes to the undergraduate housing struc
ture. Others wonder if the program will sur
vive the transition once History Prof. Mark
Mancall — the driving force behind it —
takes a back seat.
As such, we are also concerned about the
future of the program. Current students
must be assured that it will continue to com
plement existing IHUM and PWR require
ments. Prospective Stanford students must
still be given the option to study the literary
classics of religion and philosophy in a uni
fied fashion.
Meanwhile, SLE administrators should
take steps to address concerns about the
program. The biggest problem with the SLE
experience is that it is far removed from the
typical freshman experience. Part of the
problem springs from the fact that SLE is a
small and strong community with a distinct
group identity. Because SLE takes up nine to
10 units each quarter, these students spend a
majority of their time in class with their dor
mmates and are limited in their interactions
with other students. Administrators should
seek to foster greater interaction between
SLE kids and other freshmen.
Ultimately, more thought needs to be de
voted to shaping the trajectory of the SLE
program in the years to come. SLE, or some
incarnation thereof, needs to continue to
offer the promise of intellectual excitement
within this broader institution of education
al excellence.
