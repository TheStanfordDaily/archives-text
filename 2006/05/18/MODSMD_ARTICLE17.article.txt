# Wedging your bets

The Decider may have a little more Uniter
in him than I've given him credit. Unfor
tunately for all of us, his party couldn't
care less.
On Monday the President gave his first oval
office address on a domestic issue. As I have
written, I generally agree with the President's
position on immigration. And on Monday
night, he said little with which 1 take objection.
Bush maintained that a guest-worker pro
gram is important to our country's economy
because it allows immigrants to lawfully take
jobs many citizens do not desire. He stressed
that it is possible to regulate a guest-worker
program for the benefit of our economy while
at the same time securing our borders.
"These are not contradictory goals," Bush
said. "America can be a lawful society and a
welcoming society at the same time."
Bush also addressed the debate surround
ing the treatment of the 11 to 12 million illegal
immigrants that are already in the country.
Speaking directly about the Republican bill for
the removal of illegal immigrants (that has al
ready passed in the House), Bush said:
"Some in this country argue that the solu
tion is to deport every illegal immigrant and
that any proposal short of this amounts to
amnesty. I disagree."
Democrats, like Senator Edward Kennedy,
commended Bush for what many view as his
taking a stand against conservatives in his own
party. Democrats worry, however, that Bush's
proposal to send an additional 6,(XX) National
Guard troops to the border will distract from
the larger issues that still need to be resolved in
the immigration debate.
Historically, this is one issue where Bush has
been consistent. Since his days in Texas, Bush
has always welcomed Mexican immigrant
workers. The 6,(XX) National Guard troops are
Bush's compromise to his party. Moreover, its
Bush's typical way of handling a problem:
throw more troops at it.
And while I don't see the point of sending
these troops to guard the border. I 'm okay with
it. 1 see that Bush has to compromise to get
something done, and I want the bulk of his pro
posal to get passed.
The problem is that the Republicans are too
busy spinning catchy words like "amnesty for
their own political gain. They aren't interested
in any sort of compromise â€” they're interested
in the midterm election. In fact, I don't really
think they're that interested in immigration re
form because it isn't an issue that has a clearly
established Republican position opposed by an
established Democratic one. Instead. Republi
cans are interested in divisive issues that solidi
fy their conservative (and nuts) base.
Just the other day I was perusing
Fox News.com (as I often do when I am feeling
down and could use a couple laughs) when I
came across a month old article describing the
Republican plan to solidify their base for the
midterm election.The plan can be summed up
in one word: wedge.

In media politics, wedge appeals are issues
that are raised with the intention of dividing the
electorate.They are hot button issues intended
to spark an emotional response on both sides
and polarize voters.Typically, politicians rely on
voters, religion or race to get their support on
wedge issues.
With the majority of the country in agree
ment that the Republicans are doing a pitiful
job governing, the Republicans intend to capi
talize on what they feel is a wedge issue that
heavily favors them: family values.
Fox News reports that Republicans are
planning on bringing an amendment banning
gay marriage, anti-abortion legislation and a
flag-burning amendment to the floor of Con
gress before the November election in order to
solidify their base of "values" voters.
The American casualty count reached 2,433
on Monday, there are reports of an increased
number of American soldiers in Iraq that have
committed suicide and the Associated Press
just broke a story that mentally ill troops are
being forced into battle. I am just ecstatic that
the Republicans think it's important to pass an
amendment on gay marriage and flag-burning.
Flag Burning!
It would be nice if one of these days the gov
ernment actually dealt with pressing issues fac
ing the country instead of being worried about
getting reelected.
As Senate Majority Leader and presiden
tial hopeful Bill Frist (R-TN) said to the Con
servative Political Action Conference:"When
America's values are under attack, we need
to act."
How about acting when Americans them
selves are under attack??
For once. I agree with the Decider. Too bad
his party is so busy being politicians that it does
n't matter.
