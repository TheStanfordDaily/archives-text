# A 						Modern Day Fairytale
## Traditional healing 
### 
The belching kept getting louder. I looked
around at the other girls but they were
sitting in their chairs, staring straight
ahead at what was going on in front of us; no
one even cracked a smile. As the traditional
healers inhaled the smoke coming from a small
bowl full of burning herbs that they passed
amongst themselves, several healers burped
loudly. (Later, it was explained to us that this
was the healers' ancestors expressing them
selves through the healers).
1 was try ing hard not to laugh and get myself
branded as culturally insensitive. But it was a
struggle.
We had traveled a little outside Port Eliza
beth to visit a group of traditional healers, or
sangomas. Without having much context as to
what was going on, we watched their dances
and prayers. One woman wore a headdress of
red beads that looked almost like hair.
They danced in a church with bright shiny
drapes hanging just behind the altar. Between
rounds of singing, drumming and rhythmic

stamping, the healers called out appeals to their
ancestors, as well as Jesus. At the very end, all
the healers spoke loudly at once, eventually
converging in a sung version of the Lord's
Prayer.
You can't choose to be a healer, they ex
plained to us, nor are you chosen exactly; it sim
ply becomes clear that you should be one.Their
ancestors direct them in various ways as to how
their training should be conducted, as well as
what remedies to use for different people who
come to see them.
The whole idea of traditional healers — of
something beyond what 1 have been taught —
is appealing to me but it was difficult to fully
grasp what they do, how they are perceived in
society at large and whether any of it really
works.
With the healers' ceremony, it was hard to
tell what was real and what was for our benefit.
Their director told us not just any group is per
mitted to witness their rituals (our group was
allowed since our academic director was relat-

Ed to the director of the sangomas). At the end,
we were permitted to ask questions. Though it
became clear that at least some of the sango
mas both understood and spoke English well,
they still insisted on speaking through our
Xhosa teacher, who interpreted for us, as if to
give it an extra layer of mystery.
In Keiskammahoek we got a better under
standing of the different roles traditional med
icine plays.
"We believe bees are ancestors," our rural
host mother explained to us. She had a bees
nest in her kitchen the year before. In order to
get them out, she called on local sangomas to
perform the appropriate ceremony, to lead the
bees/ancestors to a new home outside the
house.
The day after the ceremony, she said, the
bees left.
Trying to get access to a healer ourselves
was tricky. After trying to make an appoint-
ment with a different healer (who, we
found out later, was avoiding us be
cause she was not certified and
thought we had come to get her in
trouble), we managed to visit one san
gonia in Keiskammahoek. He showed
us some certificates (which we didn't
understand), some herbs (which we
didn't recognize) and explained some
remedies he uses, including inducing
labor by boiling cow manure and LPs
together, draining the liquid and giving
it to the woman. Ihat kind of treat
ment is likely to induce labor in people
who aren't pregnant. Our host brother
translated for us. and even he couldn't
tell whether or not the man was joking.
As it turned out, the man may or
may not have been a prophet, rather
than a sangoma. giving the whole situ
ation another layer of absurdity.
Throughout the rolling hillside
there were small round houses built

next to the main house. Our host broth
er explained that these were used for
ceremonial purposes (although, ac
cording to others, people also live in
them). He told us he visits sangomas
for something akin to good karma;
when he needed luck in school or in his
job search, he went to sangomas.
For anything related to health, he
said, he goes to the doctor.
The use of traditional medicine is
widespread throughout the country,
and the relationship between tradi
tional and modem medicine is at times
rockier than a bad township road. One
doctor at a clinic in theTranskei (a rural
area north of Port Elizabeth) angrily
told us how he's had many babies
brought to his clinic die of septicemia,
after their parents followed a tradition
al healer's directions to give the baby
an enema with Colgate toothpaste.
According to some doctors, follow
ing the recommendations of tradition
al healers can also interfere with AIDS
treatment. In preventing mother-to
child transmission of HIV, babies born
to HIV positive mothers are supposed
to be given exclusively breast milk or

formula in the first six months of life to
prevent causing cuts or tears in the
membranes in the baby's mouth that
could allow for the introduction of the
virus. Some parents give their children
herbs in addition, increasing the risk of
infecting the child.
That's not to say traditional medi
cine is ineffective; my own viewpoint is
biased from interacting mainly with
modern medical practitioners and
having little direct contact with tradi
tional medicine or those who go to
sangomas regularly. It is also less com
monly used by people living in cities
like Port Elizabeth; my host family
would not consider turning to a tradi
tional healer if someone fell ill.
Just before we left, the group of
healers we spoke to said that one
among us would eventually become a
healer. They held back the specifics so
as not to interfere with destiny. Maybe
they were right, but I do not think their
prediction was meant for me.

us some certificates (which we didn't
understand), some herbs (which we
didn't recognize) and explained some
remedies he uses, including inducing
labor by boiling cow manure and LPs
together, draining the liquid and giving
it to the woman. Ihat kind of treat
ment is likely to induce labor in people
who aren't pregnant. Our host brother
translated for us. and even he couldn't
tell whether or not the man was joking.
As it turned out, the man may or
may not have been a prophet, rather
than a sangoma. giving the whole situ
ation another layer of absurdity.
Throughout the rolling hillside
there were small round houses built

next to the main house. Our host broth
er explained that these were used for
ceremonial purposes (although, ac
cording to others, people also live in
them). He told us he visits sangomas
for something akin to good karma;
when he needed luck in school or in his
job search, he went to sangomas.
For anything related to health, he
said, he goes to the doctor.
The use of traditional medicine is
widespread throughout the country,
and the relationship between tradi
tional and modem medicine is at times
rockier than a bad township road. One
doctor at a clinic in theTranskei (a rural
area north of Port Elizabeth) angrily
told us how he's had many babies
brought to his clinic die of septicemia,
after their parents followed a tradition
al healer's directions to give the baby
an enema with Colgate toothpaste.
According to some doctors, follow
ing the recommendations of tradition
al healers can also interfere with AIDS
treatment. In preventing mother-to
child transmission of HIV, babies born
to HIV positive mothers are supposed
to be given exclusively breast milk or

formula in the first six months of life to
prevent causing cuts or tears in the
membranes in the baby's mouth that
could allow for the introduction of the
virus. Some parents give their children
herbs in addition, increasing the risk of
infecting the child.
That's not to say traditional medi
cine is ineffective; my own viewpoint is
biased from interacting mainly with
modern medical practitioners and
having little direct contact with tradi
tional medicine or those who go to
sangomas regularly. It is also less com
monly used by people living in cities
like Port Elizabeth; my host family
would not consider turning to a tradi
tional healer if someone fell ill.
Just before we left, the group of
healers we spoke to said that one
among us would eventually become a
healer. They held back the specifics so
as not to interfere with destiny. Maybe
they were right, but I do not think their
prediction was meant for me.
