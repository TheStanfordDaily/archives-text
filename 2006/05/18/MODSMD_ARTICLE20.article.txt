## Traditional healing 
### 
The belching kept getting louder. I looked
around at the other girls but they were
sitting in their chairs, staring straight
ahead at what was going on in front of us; no
one even cracked a smile. As the traditional
healers inhaled the smoke coming from a small
bowl full of burning herbs that they passed
amongst themselves, several healers burped
loudly. (Later, it was explained to us that this
was the healers' ancestors expressing them
selves through the healers).
1 was try ing hard not to laugh and get myself
branded as culturally insensitive. But it was a
struggle.
We had traveled a little outside Port Eliza
beth to visit a group of traditional healers, or
sangomas. Without having much context as to
what was going on, we watched their dances
and prayers. One woman wore a headdress of
red beads that looked almost like hair.
They danced in a church with bright shiny
drapes hanging just behind the altar. Between
rounds of singing, drumming and rhythmic

stamping, the healers called out appeals to their
ancestors, as well as Jesus. At the very end, all
the healers spoke loudly at once, eventually
converging in a sung version of the Lord's
Prayer.
You can't choose to be a healer, they ex
plained to us, nor are you chosen exactly; it sim
ply becomes clear that you should be one.Their
ancestors direct them in various ways as to how
their training should be conducted, as well as
what remedies to use for different people who
come to see them.
The whole idea of traditional healers — of
something beyond what 1 have been taught —
is appealing to me but it was difficult to fully
grasp what they do, how they are perceived in
society at large and whether any of it really
works.
With the healers' ceremony, it was hard to
tell what was real and what was for our benefit.
Their director told us not just any group is per
mitted to witness their rituals (our group was
allowed since our academic director was relat-

Ed to the director of the sangomas). At the end,
we were permitted to ask questions. Though it
became clear that at least some of the sango
mas both understood and spoke English well,
they still insisted on speaking through our
Xhosa teacher, who interpreted for us, as if to
give it an extra layer of mystery.
In Keiskammahoek we got a better under
standing of the different roles traditional med
icine plays.
"We believe bees are ancestors," our rural
host mother explained to us. She had a bees
nest in her kitchen the year before. In order to
get them out, she called on local sangomas to
perform the appropriate ceremony, to lead the
bees/ancestors to a new home outside the
house.
The day after the ceremony, she said, the
bees left.
Trying to get access to a healer ourselves
was tricky. After trying to make an appoint-
