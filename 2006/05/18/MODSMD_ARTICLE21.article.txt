## ResEd responds to criticism 
### JOSH SCHILLER 
Tuesday's Editorial, "Res Ed's Policies
Fall Short of the Mark," demonstrated
many of the challenges faced by both
our professional and residential staff. The edi
torial contradicted itself, seemed to be based
on limited knowledge and supposition and
overly generalized perceptions of what stu
dents want or don't want. With about 6,(XK)
undergraduates living on campus, there are
many opinions about what Residential Edu
cation should do and how the program should
be implemented. Moreover, parents also have
a stake in the services the University provides.
It is important to understand that the mis
sion of Residential Education — to extend
learning beyond the classroom into resi
dences and complement the academic cur

riculuni with activities and experiences essen
tial to students' preparation for a life of lead
ership, intellectual engagement, citizenship
and service — is more than just a departmen
tal directive. This is a University value that is
actively promoted by both the Vice Provost
for Student Affairs and the vice provost for
undergraduate education. The Residential
Education program is one of the hallmarks of
the Stanford undergraduate experience and
one of the dimensions around which a signifi
cant number of students make choices to at
tend our institution.
The editorial spoke about the needs of stu
dents in community and the policies that help
maintain a community's health. A policy for
quiet hours and high standards for appropri
ate behavior are necessary for the most ur
bane of relationships. These standards and

policies are based on fundamental expecta
tions that students have for civility in their
homes, when sharing confined spaces with
new acquaintances or the oldest of friends.
The standards that we employ are intended to
create a safe space that empowers students to
freely express who they are and what they be
lieve. to create a space where they can be suc
cessful scholars.
For Residential Education staff, resident
fellows and all residential student staff, the
contradiction in your editorial was not lost.
You say on the one hand that policies estab
lished by Residential Education are patroniz
ing, while at the same time you state the or
ganization is not doing enough to construct
communities for students.This seems to be ev-
