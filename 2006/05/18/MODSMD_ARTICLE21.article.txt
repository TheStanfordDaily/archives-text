## ResEd responds to criticism 
### JOSH SCHILLER 
Tuesday's Editorial, "Res Ed's Policies
Fall Short of the Mark," demonstrated
many of the challenges faced by both
our professional and residential staff. The edi
torial contradicted itself, seemed to be based
on limited knowledge and supposition and
overly generalized perceptions of what stu
dents want or don't want. With about 6,(XK)
undergraduates living on campus, there are
many opinions about what Residential Edu
cation should do and how the program should
be implemented. Moreover, parents also have
a stake in the services the University provides.
It is important to understand that the mis
sion of Residential Education — to extend
learning beyond the classroom into resi
dences and complement the academic cur

riculuni with activities and experiences essen
tial to students' preparation for a life of lead
ership, intellectual engagement, citizenship
and service — is more than just a departmen
tal directive. This is a University value that is
actively promoted by both the Vice Provost
for Student Affairs and the vice provost for
undergraduate education. The Residential
Education program is one of the hallmarks of
the Stanford undergraduate experience and
one of the dimensions around which a signifi
cant number of students make choices to at
tend our institution.
The editorial spoke about the needs of stu
dents in community and the policies that help
maintain a community's health. A policy for
quiet hours and high standards for appropri
ate behavior are necessary for the most ur
bane of relationships. These standards and

policies are based on fundamental expecta
tions that students have for civility in their
homes, when sharing confined spaces with
new acquaintances or the oldest of friends.
The standards that we employ are intended to
create a safe space that empowers students to
freely express who they are and what they be
lieve. to create a space where they can be suc
cessful scholars.
For Residential Education staff, resident
fellows and all residential student staff, the
contradiction in your editorial was not lost.
You say on the one hand that policies estab
lished by Residential Education are patroniz
ing, while at the same time you state the or
ganization is not doing enough to construct
communities for students.This seems to be ev-
idence of what happens when stu
dents do not take ownership for the
effectiveness of their community.
In our annual residence evalua
tion, we asked students to respond to
the statement: "My residence is a
friendly and supportive community."
Of the 2,808 people to respond, 46.58
percent strongly agreed with the
statement and another 45.51 percent
agreed. Only 4.7 percent disagreed
and one percent strongly disagreed. It
is the responsibility of students to cre
ate strong individual friendships and
to forge their own social support net
works. Residential Education assists
this endeavor by creating supportive
environments where this can happen.
Frankly, we are glad to correct
your misinformation as it regards the
residential staff response to eating
disorders and sexual assault. Resi
dent and college assistants, peer
health educators, any and all of the
residential staff, are extremely re
sponsive to students who are encoun
tering difficulties like these and. in
fact, work very hard on the preven

tion of both. It is also the case that for
things like a sexual assault, the
YWCA Sexual Assault Center at
Stanford may get the first phone call
from a student. A date rape is an ex
tremely serious matter both physical
ly and psychologically for the sur
vivor and requires a response from
trained professionals to attend to the
needs and desires of that survivor.
And it is also the prerogative of the
survivor to decide what to share with
their house staff. For the staff, they
help students whenever possible to
make the connection to professionals
at the Y and at Vaden, but continue to
provide support for the resident. It is
a similar circumstance when support
ing students with eating disorders.
Although student staff members
are not trained professionals, they
have been extremely effective at sup
porting students who are going
through very difficult and personal
situations. This often goes unnoticed
because it would be inappropriate for
RAs, PI lEs or any other staff to share
this information with others. But the
staff members work hard to connect
their peers to the appropriate re
sources as they reach the limits of
how they can support the complex is
sues that our students experience.To
assume that the staff do not reach out

to those peers experiencing severe
life events based on what is seen on
the surface would be critically short
sighted on the part of the Editorial
Board.
Residential Education knows that
statistics showing overall satisfaction
do not mean that everyone is happy
with every aspect of residential life.
Our goal is to annually examine how
we can push the program forward
with ever-increasing emphasis on the
quality of what we do for and with our
residents. Students have a responsi
bility in this as well, though.Too often,
RAs will solicit their residents for
ideas for programs only to find that
the students who were most vocal are
noticeably absent when the program
they requested occurs.
Residential Education welcomes
new ideas and tries to work with stu
dents to implement them, provided
that they fall within the parameters of
our mission. A statement of general
displeasure is a very difficult thing to
address. However, concrete sugges
tions on how to improve residential
life will be taken seriously by staff and
student leaders.
