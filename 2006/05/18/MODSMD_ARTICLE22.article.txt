Article on Beinin raises vital questions

The Daily's article," Beinin chosen as face
of terrorism for book cover, sues publishing
company" (May 15), raises vital questions.
First, Prof. Beinin declares there is no anti-Is
rael bias at Stanford. Of course there is such
a bias (among others), as he well knows.
More important, in singling out "criticism
from conservative thinkers," the article seems
to accept Beinin's claim that his critics share
an "ultra-right wing agenda." Such criticism

does exist, but other people also disagree with
him. 1 and other liberals at Stanford and
around the country, who oppose right-wing
agendas, have been challenging him for years.
So in order to recognize Beinin's one
sided stance, it does not take a right-wing
"campaign to vilify and discredit academics."
While supporting Israel's withdrawals from
Gaza and the West Bank, liberals and those
on the left recognize the essential security
danger Israel has faced for decades.
The article states that Beinin advocates a

peaceful response to "problems spurred by Is
rael's occupation of the West Bank." But that
phrase disregards a half-century's Arab intol
erance — for instance,the charter that Hamas
will not renounce, which announces: "Israel
will exist... until Islam will obliterate it."

Stanford should devote more
resources to South Asia
Army Lin's excellent article
("Students Want More South
Asia," May 17) on the severe dearth
of course offerings and research
opportunities related to South Asia
at Stanford is both timely and accu
rate.
As a graduate student research
ing South Asian history and cul
ture, I share the frustration of many
of those cited in the article, regard
ing the lamentable state of South
Asian studies at Stanford. Stan
ford's disregard of the South Asian

region, which accounts for one
sixth of the world's population, is
astonishing. But demographic, po
litical and economic significance
are not the only reasons why Stan
ford ought to devote greater re
sources to South Asian studies. All
cultures are intrinsically important
and demand intellectual interest ir
respective of their historical or con
temporary position in the world.
Although Stanford's departments
offer courses on the history, culture
and politics of many of the world's
regions — including other regions
in Asia — it is regrettable that
South Asia is virtually absent from
academic life here.
Moreover, the neglect of South
Asian studies at Stanford also repre
sents a neglect of the vast and influ
ential body of scholarship on and
from that part of the world. For a

university that considers itself on par
with the best in the world, it is an em
barrassing fact that Stanford is put to
shame by many apparently lesser in
stitutions when it comes to South
Asian studies.
I hope that the various individ
uals and groups at Stanford who
would like to see a substantial
commitment from the University
to research and courses on South
Asia will work to change the pres
ent situation. Those involved with
the previous South Asia Initiative
should work with students, faculty
and the administration, for the es
tablishment of a permanent Cen
ter for South Asian Studies at
Stanford.
