Article on Beinin raises vital questions

The Daily's article," Beinin chosen as face
of terrorism for book cover, sues publishing
company" (May 15), raises vital questions.
First, Prof. Beinin declares there is no anti-Is
rael bias at Stanford. Of course there is such
a bias (among others), as he well knows.
More important, in singling out "criticism
from conservative thinkers," the article seems
to accept Beinin's claim that his critics share
an "ultra-right wing agenda." Such criticism

does exist, but other people also disagree with
him. 1 and other liberals at Stanford and
around the country, who oppose right-wing
agendas, have been challenging him for years.
So in order to recognize Beinin's one
sided stance, it does not take a right-wing
"campaign to vilify and discredit academics."
While supporting Israel's withdrawals from
Gaza and the West Bank, liberals and those
on the left recognize the essential security
danger Israel has faced for decades.
The article states that Beinin advocates a

peaceful response to "problems spurred by Is
rael's occupation of the West Bank." But that
phrase disregards a half-century's Arab intol
erance â€” for instance,the charter that Hamas
will not renounce, which announces: "Israel
will exist... until Islam will obliterate it."
