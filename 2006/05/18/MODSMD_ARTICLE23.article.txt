# CARDINAL TODAY
## Sports NCAA BID AT STAKE AT UCLA 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
More than anything, Stanford baseball
wants a sweep. Three straight wins against
UCLA this weekend would not only help
make up for this season's lackluster first half,
but it would strengthen the Cardinal's chances
for a 14th straight postseason appearance.
"If we sweep we have a better position as
far as postseason play," sophomore third base
man Randy Molina said. "We cannot revert
back to the relaxed approached we had earlier.
We need to keep up this sense of urgency."
Molina is talking about Stanford's remark
able performance with its back against the
wall. Three weeks ago, the Cardinal (28-21.10-
11 Pac-10) were at 17-18 and 3-9 in the Pac-10,
but thanks to solid starting pitching and the
long-awaited appearance of the offense, Stan
ford started winning games.
In fact, the squad now has now won three
Pac-10 series in a row and seven straight con
tests leading into their final Pac-10 contests of

the season against the Bruins (28-21,10-8 Pac
-10).
"I think it's just a matter of us hitting the
ball better," Coach Mark Marquess said.
"When we don't get a lot of hits, we're getting
timely hits. In the middle of the season we
weren't doing that. We'd get eight hits but we
weren't getting any runs because we weren't
getting any hits at the right time.
"Another thing is [senior pitcher Greg]
Reynolds has really pitched well over this
streak. 1 le's had his best outings the last three,
four starts that he's had."
After earning his second Pac-10 Pitcher of
the Week honor in the past three weeks,
Reynolds (6-3,3.17) will get the start Friday
night against Hector Ambriz (6-6,3.77).
Stanford hopes its recent record and wins
this weekend are enough to push it into the
postseason. Marquess expects that five teams
from the Pac-10 will be chosen, as occurred last
year, Entering the weekend the Cardinal are in
sixth-place in the Pac-10. Marquess hopes the
team's RPI ranking, helped by wins against

ranked Cal State Fullerton,Texas and Arizona
State teams, helps the Cardinal.
"1 think we're definitely in the hunt for
postseason play which is amazing," Marquess
said. "If you'd asked me a month ago about it,
I'd probably say we realistically didn't have a
realistic chance. But we've played well. That
tough schedule, even though we struggled in
the middle of the season, will help us if we con
tinue to win."
Certainly, the Cardinal players were upset
at the results they were seeing on the field. It
isn't until now that they are seeing their prac
tice and talent translate into something more
on the field.
"ITiis is the kind of team you expect to play
for when you come to Stanford," Molina said.
"Coming to this team you hear all about the
past players and past success and it's kind of
hard when you're having a losing season... I'm
excited that we're finally winning some games
and taking some teams out of the postseason."

Sophomore catcher Brian Juhl dives back to first in a game against Cal earlier this season. Juhl made seven starts filling in for senior John Hester, who was out with a knee infection.
Elsewhere in the Pac-10

No. 10 Oregon State (35-13,12-6)
continues to dominate the Pac-10,
though it did drop two games to Ari
zona State (32-17, 10-8) last week
end. OSU, however, maintained sole
possession of the top spot and faces
Washington State (34-18, 9-9) this
weekend. The Beavers' unofficial
closer, Kevin Gunderson, leads the
nation in saves with 15.
Arizona State moved up in all the
polls after taking two of three in
Tcmpe against the Beavers. The No.

13 Sun Devils arc two games behind
Oregon State in the standings (tied
with UCLA). Ike Davis, the Pac-10's
leader in RBIs, is the first freshman
to ever lead the conference in the cat
egory, with 58. The Devils travel to
Arizona for their second-to-last Pac
-10 series, against a 22-27 Wildcats
squad.
USC (25-25, 11-10) is two-and-a
half games back of ASU in the Pac
-10. They have a non-conference se
ries this weekend at Wichita State.
Washington State comes in right
above the Cardinal with a 34-18
record. The Cougars had 18 hits in
their Tuesday win against Gonzaga.
Washington (33-23, 9-12). like
USC, does not have a conference
series this weekend but plays at Pa
cific.
