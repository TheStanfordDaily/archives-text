## Ultimate with a chance for title Superfly tries to defend its title at Ultimate Frisbee College Nationals 
### CALEY ANDERSON DESK EDITOR 
After winning a national champi
onship, where is there for a team to go
but down?
Stanford's women's Ultimate Frisbee
team, however,expect to remain the best
by defending their national title this
Memorial Day weekend at the Ultimate
Frisbee College Nationals in Columbus,
Ohio.
"I'm looking forward to Nationals,"
senior Julia James said. "We have been
able to pull it together when it's mat
tered, and I can't wait to see that hap
pen in Columbus, when it really mat
ters."
And the players have good reason to
be excited — in the past decade they
have brought home five national titles
and this season their record is 35-1
against college teams. And while the
numbers certainly back up their talent,
excellent team chemistry doesn 't hurt ei
ther.
"This year's team is ridiculously deep
on the field and cohesive off it," James
said. "We have an awesome, energetic
rookie group this year that I think has re
ally brought the team what it needed."
Emily Damon has been a key addi

tion to Superfly. Stanford's A-team. The
freshman hails from Amherst. Mass. and
has been playing Ultimate longer than
many of her teammates.
"She has quickly become one of the
most reliable and impressive players on
the team," said fellow freshman Rachel
Habbert.
Talented rookies still need leader
ship, and Superfly seems to have it in
spades. Senior I lannah Griego and grad
uate students Katie Berk and Alicia
Dantzker are the team captains this
year, and their guidance has helped
shape the team.
"Our captains this year are tough as
nails." junior Megan Andrews said.
"They make us want to work hard every
day, and they lead a lot by example. Han
nah broke her arm in a tournament over
spring break, but she's been playing fear
lessly ever since with a huge cast on.
She's indestructible."
Fearlessness is a requisite quality to
play Ultimate — this is no lazy Saturday
afternoon Frisbee toss, llie players arc
often seen leaping headfirst through the
air for a toss, personal safety thrown to
the wind — with the Frisbee.
"Ultimate requires a great combina
tion of intelligence, skill and athleti
cism," Habbert said. "I came to one prac
tice in the fall and was hooked."
"It's unlike any other sport because
you can pick it up in college and be
great in a short time," sophomore
Danielle Piatt said. "It's cool because
there are no refs. so it emphasizes
sportsmanship."
As a club team, the women do not re

ceive the same perks as varsity athletes.
"You have to work harder to earn
money so that you can play," Piatt said.
"You don't get recognition as often as
varsity athletes, although most students
are very supportive."
"We have to do a lot of the fundrais
ing ourselves," Andrews said. "It's just
fun to be on a team, though we don't get
all the cool gear, and we haven't been in
vited to athlete formal, even though
we've been winning national champi
onships for years."
Despite the diminished formal
prospects, some girls pointed out the
positives of being a club sport.
"I think being a non-varsity athlete is
advantageous," Habbert said. "We have
the freedom to work out when and how
we want to, without any rules and regu
lations. We don't have to have mandato
ry three or four hours a day of practice,
but we can and often do."
Working hard for the love of the sport
seems to be an essential quality in an Ul
timate player.
"Ultimate is an entire community —
it's pretty ridiculous," Andrews said.
"For a lot of people, it's a way of life.
We're pretty tight with the men's Ulti
mate team. The men's and women's
teams understand each other and the ul
timate community."
"It's an amazing sport," said James.
"It seems to attract a pretty liberal and
fun-loving group of people."
The team will be working hard May
26-28 in Ohio, but the women are look
ing forward to the challenge — and if
things go well, the victory.
