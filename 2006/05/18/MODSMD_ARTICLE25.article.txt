## Golf preps for Regionals after tough Pac-10's 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES STAFF WRITER 
Rankings aside, the men's golf team is riding an upward
surge of solid play as it begins play in today's NCAA West
Regional at the traditional TUcson National Golf Club in
Arizona.
For the men, a difficult fall has given way to a successful
spring that has seen four top-five finishes. The men are hop
ing to replicate the upswing they experienced last year under
then-rookie Coach Conrad Ray and claim their second
NCAA berth since 2(X)1.
The team placed sixth at the Pac-10 Championships.
"I think there are a lot of things to be positive about, and
that's what we're focusing on," Ray said. "Even though our
finish at Pac-10 wasn't as high as we would've liked, we real
ly played pretty well, and we were really close to being in
those top two or three teams. I think the guys realize that, and
also realize that they're playing solid."
Individually, sophomore Rob Grube is ready to defend
his NCAA West Regional title, despite tying for sixth at this
year's Pac-10 Championships. Grube said he is confident and
well-prepared for the weeks ahead, which could include an
NCAA Championship bid.
"I've worked on some swing changes, and I expect that
they'll help me this week," he said. "I'm a much better golfer
compared to last year. I have a more controlled long game, a
sounder short game and a more consistent putter. I hope
those improvements will show in
the upcoming weeks, when it mat
ters."
Despite the high pressure of the
postseason, the team hopes to treat
the Regional the same as any other
tournament.
"The key is for us to go the Re
gional tournament and play like we
have all spring, and take it one shot
at a time," Ray said. "If we treat it
like another round of golf, and real
ly pay attention to the details, I
think we'll come out in good
shape."
Meanwhile, freshman Dodge
Keminer looks to build on his 10th
place finish at Pac-lOs.
"All the guys and I have been
working hard to prepare for this
event," Kemmer said. "Most of our
time has been spent around the
greens, chipping and putting.This is
always the place to save the most
shots, and I feel our improvement is
definitely noticeable in practice.
Hopefully, that will carry over to
the tournament this week."
Joining Kemmer and Grube will
be senior Kyle Gentry, who, follow
ing a difficult fall season, has be
come a force for the team.
"Kyle, finishing second at Stan
ford [in the U.S. Intercollegiate],
and having a couple good rounds at
the Pac-10,will be a good addition,"
Ray said. "He hasn't been on the
lineup full-time, but he's con
tributed, and he's definitely playing

pretty well. He's a guy that can go
pretty low when he gets it going."
The Cardinal will also need con
sistency, however, which they are
looking for from their last two com
peting members: junior Zack Miller
and freshman Daniel Lim.
"Daniel Lim's been steady," Ray
said. "He just goes about his busi
ness; he's got a good short game and
he rarely shoots high numbers.
That's the kind of consistency we
need."
Miller has also been a steady
contributor this year.
"He continues to show up every
week and plays hard," Ray said.
"He's really hard to beat when he
puts everything together, and he al
ways keeps the ball in play off the
tee."
Consistency and confidence will
hopefully propel the Cardinal into
the top 10 at the Regional, guaran
teeing them an NCAA Champi
onship berth. Currently, the team is
the No. 12 seed, but last year fin
ished eighth as the No. 16 seed.
"1 think we all have high expec
tations, and that just goes with hav
ing the 'S' on your chest." he said.
"We all want to win, and I'm no dif
ferent from that. I've been doing
my best to give the guys the most
opportunities to improve this sea
son, and I feel we've definitely
made a lot of progress. We really
just have to treat it like another
event, but I'd be lying if I didn't say
I had high expectations for the guys,
and for myself."
Should the Cardinal move past
the Regional, they will compete at
the NCAA Championship. May 31 -
June 3, in Sunriver, Ore.
