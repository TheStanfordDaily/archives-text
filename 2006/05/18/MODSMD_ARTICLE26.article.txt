# Bush belongs in No.5
## 
### 
Lately a lot of controversy has
been swirling around the
steroid scandal. Barry Bonds
and his quest to pass Babe Ruth's leg
endary 714 career homeruns en route
to Hank Aaron's record. Meanwhile,
Leßron James has transcended his
status as merely a great player, and is
becoming a great leader before our
eyes. And of course, the NHL play
offs are in full swing.
So let me tell you — it's a relief to
be able to talk about the New Or
leans Saints.
As I see it, writing about Barry
Bonds at this point would just make
you ball up this paper in disgust and
throw it in the nearest trash bin, and
we can't have people forgetting to re
cycle. And trust me, it would be j ust as
painful to write as it would be to read.
Writing about "King" James is
certainly a more appealing prospect,
but I figure in that case I'd have to
give you all a prediction for how the
series with the Pistons is going to turn
out, and I think I'll take the coward's
way out there. (I can't resist: Cavs
take the series in game seven.)
That leaves the NHL. And you
know I'm not touching that with a 10-
foot pole.
And so we return to the New Or
leans 'Aints (as in "Ain't in the play
offs," for those who were curious).
More specifically, though, I'm going
to be talking about their first-round
draft pick, and the second player se
lected overall: Reggie Bush. Even
more specifically, I want to bring up
his jersey, and the number on it.
Bush, the Southern California
sensation at running back, wants to
keep 5, his old college number, in the
NFL.
The problem? NFL rules only
allow a running back to wear a num
ber between 20 and 49.
One wonders how the NFL ever
earned its "No Fun League"
moniker.
The league has numerical require
ments for all positions, and although
it broadened the possibilities for
wide receivers two years ago, there
are no signs as yet that the system is
on its way out.
To be sure, in some cases it has
merit. Offensive linemen, for in
stance, have to have their numbers
regulated so that officials can keep
track of them on passing plays and
check for players illegally downfield.
But there's no cause for any of the
other restrictions.
As disappointed as Bush had to be
when Houston passed on him with
their first pick, sending him to a tradi
tionally horrible New Orleans team,
it might have been divine interven
tion for the Katrina-devastated city.
You'd be hard-pressedto find a more
exciting distraction from the sober
ing task of rebuilding a city than the
young running back from USC.
It's important to note that Bush
has pledged to donate 25 percent of
the money he earns from his jersey
sales this year to hurricane relief ef
forts. Reggie Bush wearing the num
ber five instantly conjures up memo
ries of stunning collegiate perform
ances and the most exciting young
player in the country. If that encour
ages a few more people to buy jerseys
and sends a few more dollars to Kat
rina relief, so much the better.
But the ultimate argument against
the current NFL rule is that there's
really no point for it. It serves no pur
pose within the game to restrict play
ers to certain numbers, and it proba
bly hurts league marketing. Players
want their individual personalities to
come out on the field and I think fans
want to see that too.
But an unorthodox number does
n't show up the other team the way
some say endzone celebrations do.
Who would really get bent out of
shape if a running back were wearing
number 5 or a linebacker sported an
11?
In the end, regulations on the
numbers a player can wear are just
rules for the sake of rules. It's a lasting
testament to the idiocy of the most
popular sport in the U.S. that could be
more popular still if only it would
loosen up.
Wait a minute... a testament to id
iocy, a popular sport and people who
need to loosen up? It all sounds sus
piciously like I wrote that column on
Barry Bonds after all.
