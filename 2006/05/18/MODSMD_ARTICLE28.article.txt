## Willeman brings home Cacchione Cup Equestrian team finishes in second place at National Championship 
### DENIS GRIFFIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford equestrian
team competed in Nationals on
May 4-7 and brought home fan
tastic results.
Not only did Stanford co-term
Sarah Willeman earn the title of
the best collegiate rider in the
country by winning the Cac
chione Cup, but Stanford as a
team finished second as the Re
serve National Champions.
That's a stunning achieve
ment for a team that saw con
struction of an expansive new fa
cility finished just earlier this
year.
"It's pretty cool for us that the
equestrian team has been around
since the mid-1980s, but we've
only been in this new barn for one
year," Coach Vanessa Bartsch
said. "And when I was with the
team more than ten years ago. we
had four horses to use for 25 rid
ers, we now have 25 horses and 50
team members. It's really neat,
because this was the first time in
ten years that the team has quali
fied for Nationals."
Coupled with the recent
changes in facilities and rapid
growth of the program, the team
also faced the traditional power
houses — East Coast schools and
Kentucky — in the tournament.
"It's really exciting because
we came in feeling like an under
dog, happy to be at Nationals but
not really expecting anything,"
senior Sophie Gassee said. "And
then, day two, being second in the
nation, [we earned] a lot of re
spect after not getting so much
respect for being a West Coast
team."
"The West Coast is often
thought of as sort of a non-entity
in intercollegiate riding because
it's so built into Kentucky and
New England and places where
riding is really a big thing."
Bartsch added. "Our finish in the

Reserve Championship is huge
because it's the highest finish that
anyone can remember for a West
Coast school. Sarah has the first
Cacchione Cup win at Stanford,
and the highest finish ever for
someone competing for the West
Coast."
"So now they're all asking me
'is Sarah [Willeman] graduating?
Is Sophie [Gasseej graduating?"'
Bartsch went on. "And 1 said.
'Yeah, they're graduating, but
I've got 48 more like them at
home."'
Not only was Willeman the
first Stanford rider ever to win the
Cacchione Cup, but she also
helped Stanford's team with her
individual success.
"Last year [Willeman] rode in
about half the shows, but she still
finished fifth in the standings,"
Bartsch said."So 1 talked with her
and said,'lf you're going to come
back next year, ride the full year,'
and she pretty much dominated
the whole year, which is a big deal
for the team. Because having
Sarah on our team — not only did
she take the Cacchione lead in
every region — but every time
she won showings she earned
points for our team."
Willeman had only praise for
her teammates.
"Of course it was great to see
our team perform so well,"
Willeman said. "And already. I
was so excited about what I'd
seen the team accomplish over
the course of the year, that 1
thought anything that happened
at Nationals was sort of the icing
on the cake. But all of our riders
just went in and really per
formed beautifully."
Gassee hopes that Willeman's
championship and the team's sec
ond-place finish sends a message
to Stanford students and the rest
of the nation.
"Stanford has a history with
horses,"Gassee said. "I think that
equine tradition is really impor
tant here. We have an incredible
group of coaches who are some of
the best riders in the United
States, hands down.
And I think it's important to
know that Stanford has a group
of riders that care about horses
and care about upholding that
tradition."
