# For Molina, no place like home
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
For many students, going away to college means being away from
family for the first time. Not so for sophomore Randy Molina.
"Growing up, playing travel ball. I was always traveling two weeks
at a time, so 1 was sort of used to being on my own," Molina said. "But
this is different because my parents, throughout my baseball career,
were always there for me."'
This weekend, however, Molina gets to go home. A native of South
Gate, Calif., a predominantly Latino city located by the Los Angeles
neighborhoods of Compton and Downey. Molina can visit the place
where he and his family have lived since he was three months old.The
Cardinal baseball team arrives in Los Angeles today for its three-game
series against UCLA.
The first thing Molina will do in LA, however, won't be baseball.
The self-described family-oriented son is having dinner with his par
ents on the first night of the trip.
As the youngest of three sons of Mexican-immigrant parents,
Molina received the most attention growing up. His father, Jose Moli
na,spent time with him and helped to launch his baseball career at the
age of three.
Jose coached him well, preparing him for a big break with the Los
Angeles Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities (RBI). There, a 13-year
old Molina went on to win Player of the Year and travel around the
country.
Soon, that gave way to a spot on the 2004 USA Junior National
Team and, eventually, a spot on the Stanford baseball team.
Today, Molina finds himself right where he started, albeit with a lot
more experience and a bit more expertise.
After a freshman season in which he saw limited action, Molina
now has the third-highest batting average on the team (.327). He has
hit safely in nine of the last 11 games, and his RBI single in the bottom
of the ninth against Santa Clara on May 9 helped jump-start the Car
dinal's current seven-game win streak.
InTUesday's 11-7 victory over Santa Clara, Molina got a fifth-inning
rally started with a hit to left centerfield, and finished the night with
two runs.
All told, Molina's second season has been quite a different story
than a forgettable first year that saw just one hit in six pinch-hit at bats.
"Coming off last year when I had six at bats, as soon as I got the op
portunity to play, whether it was DHing or on the field, I didn't want to
give the coaches an excuse not to play me," Molina said. "So every time
I go out there I try to get noticed by the coaches, try to get noticed by my
teammates, try to contribute so that coach making the lineup sees that I
should probably be in there. Looking back on last year, sitting on the
bench the whole year, the way I felt — I just didn't want to go through
that again this year."
Molina's hard work hasn't gone
unnoticed.
"I'm real proud of Randy,"Coach
Mark Marquess said. "He's had to
work hard for it. He earned that
spot, it wasn't given to him; he wasn't
starting at the beginning of the year.
He really worked his way into the
lineup at the DH role, then first base
and now he's settled in at third. I'm
real proud of what he's accom
plished."
Inserting Molina in the starting
lineup has certainly worked. His bat
ting average hasn't been below .300
since Feb. 24, his third game played.
"I don't like going up to hit and
feeling like I didn't trv my hardest to

get on base or try my hardest to help
our team score," Molina said.
With that kind of mentality, a lead
ership position would fit Molina just
fine.
As Marquess pointed out, senior
shortstop Chris Minaker and senior
second baseman Chris Lewis — who
provide much of the Stanford of
fense — are wrapping up their Stan
ford careers,so a bigger role seems to
be in line.
"He has a big role now but he'll
have a bigger role next year — no
question about that," Marquess said.
Despite his recent success. Moli
na stays grounded in what he gives
thanks for the most: his family. The
19-year old, fluent in Spanish, still
calls his mom at least every other
day.
"1 can tell [that she loves to hear
from me]." Molina said. "When 1 talk
to her on the phone, she always
sounds a little more excited."
