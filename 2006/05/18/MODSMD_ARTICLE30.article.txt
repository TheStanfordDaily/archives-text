## Faculty night a popular tradition Students say the dinners promote better student-faculty relationships 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
This spring, students in dorms across campus will enjoy
dinner and conversation with professors during residence
faculty nights. This time-honored tradition, with roots at
Branner Hall, is wholly unique to Stanford,students said.
According to Roland Hsu, senior associate director of
Undergraduate Advising Programs (UAP), this "fine and
very well received tradition" was most likely initiated by
the late History Prof. Kennell A. Jackson, a long-time res
ident fellow at Branner.
Hsu said that head peer academic coordinators
(HPACs) in each residence, under the guidance of UAP,
work with Residential Education and Dining Services
staff to schedule and plan the quarterly events.
Wilbur Hall held its faculty night on May 11. and Flo
rence Moore Hall followed on May 15. In the fall and win
ter quarters, approximately 50 professors attended each
dorm's dinner.
Freshman Sophomore College (FroSoCo) held its fac
ulty night on May 3. According to senior Dana Ung, a
FroSoCo college assistant who organized the evening,
FroSoCo's faculty night has averaged 30 professors each
quarter, a higher turnout than in past years.
Residential and Dining Education staff do their part to
enhance the ambiance.
"The tables are decorated, complete with bottles of
sparkling cider, the food is excellent and conversation is
lively,"said Rinconada HPAC Megan Hoarfrost, a junior.
Many HPACs described the atmosphere of faculty
nights as comfortable, intimate and casual.
"The professors themselves are more relaxed, so you
get to see a different side of them," Ung said. "A lot of stu
dents talk to professors in office hours, but when you talk
to them over food, it changes the atmosphere. ITiey'll joke
around and talk about things they might not talk about in
an academic setting."
Other HPACs highlighted the importance of making
connections with faculty members.
"Whether you are interested in getting letters of rec
ommendation in the future, finding an advisor or simply
looking for advice regarding your academic career, invit
ing a professor to faculty night is a great way to do so," said
Junipero HPAC Sonia Nagala, a junior.
"In a large lecture, it's often difficult to get to know fac
ulty on a one-on-one basis, but during faculty night, you
get to have an intimate and intellectually stimulating dis
cussion with your professor, conveniently in your own
dining hall," she added.
Students and professors alike spoke positively about
their experiences at faculty nights, which can lead to men
toring relationships or research positions.
"Having been invited to many such faculty nights, 1 can
