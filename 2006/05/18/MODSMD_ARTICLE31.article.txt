dents to have the benefit of informal time spent with their
faculty," Hsu said. "Conversations begun at faculty nights
often continue in class following the special evenings."
Mathematics Prof. Simon Brendle was a recent guest at
FroSoCo, Roble and Wilbur.
"It is a great experience to interact with students that
have such a deep interest in mathematics and science," he
said.
Many students echoed the sentiments of their profes
sors.
"I've invited five professors to faculty night, and three
of them are now people to whom I can go for academic ad
vice and for general mentorship." said Mirlo HPAC Paul
Mark Elizondo 111, a junior.
Some take advantage of the opportunity and develop
relationships with faculty members at the dinners, contin
uing to seek advice from them throughout their time on
campus.
"My freshman year, I invited [Music] Prof. Jonathan
Berger, who was teaching my first introductory seminar at
Stanford," said Nagala."lnviting him to Faculty Night was
the first step I took in developing a meaningful student
faculty relationship with him. Dr. Berger is currently my
advisor, and I see him at least bi-monthly for academic ad
vice."
Junior Rosemary Reidy recalled a similar experience
from her first year at Stanford.
"Inviting a professor to faculty night was one of the
best things I did during the spring of my freshman year,"
she said. "I invited a psychology professor and asked her
about opportunities in the psych department. She con
nected me with a research position in another professor's
lab for the school year and invited me to join her research
for the summer. Eventually she became my advisor and
has helped me out in countless academic and personal sit
uations."
Students at Columbia, Cornell, Brown, Yale and New
York University said that they were not aware of anything
similar to Stanford faculty nights occurring at their
schools.
"To invite a professor to faculty night and begin foster
ing a relationship with him or her is part of the definition
of taking full advantage of your Stanford undergraduate
career," Elizondo said.
