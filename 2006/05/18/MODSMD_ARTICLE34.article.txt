## CAMPUS SAFETY 5-SURE looking for more volunteers 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD MANAGING EDITOR 
With the recent armed rob
beries on campus, walking alone
at night has suddenly gone from
benign to potentially dangerous.
While students may normally
turn to the 5-SURE Escort serv
ices — the student group that
runs golf carts around campus to
ensure safe travel — this week
end their calls may go unan
swered without more volunteers
for the service.
5-SURE is now facing a po
tential dearth of personnel while
expecting increased demand. A
weekend already crowded due to
680 Lomita's Exotic Erotic party
has now turned into a potential
logisticai nightmare for the
group with concerns over cam
pus crime.
In emails circulating around
campus, 5-SURE has solicited
student volunteers for the up
coming weekend.

"A dire need for volunteers,"
has been reported, and the group
is looking to add additional carts
and drivers to accommodate an
anticipated jump in requests.
"Volunteering to do some
SURE shifts would be a great
way to assist the Stanford com
munity in this time of need,"
wrote Nicole Taylor, managing
director at the Haas Center for
Public Service, in an email to
campus chat lists.
Tlie group is looking for vol
unteer drivers to work week
night shifts, Sunday through
Thursday, from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m.

ing drivers for the weekend shifts
with the greatest expected de
mand. The Friday and Saturday
