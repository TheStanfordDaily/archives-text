## Surging Softball faces Tulsa in first round of Fresno Regional 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
Talk about going out with a bang. Behind the efforts of seniors Catalina Morris and Lau
ren Lappin, No. 10 Stanford softball finished the Pac-10 season with a two-game sweep of
No. 1 UCLA. But conference play is all for naught now, as the Cardinal now enter the post
season, and the first steps on the road to Oklahoma City and the Women's College World Se
ries come this weekend.
Centerfielder Morris, named Pac-10 Player of the Week this week for the first time in her
career, has led the squad all season while Lappin has anchored the defense at catcher and
shortstop, earning Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year honors for the second year in a row.

The two hope to continue their success as the Cardinal (38-15,10-11 Pac-10) head to
Fresno, Calif., for NCAA Regional play this weekend. As the top seed in Fresno, Stan
ford will kick off the double-elimination tournament Friday night with TUlsa (34- y
22,15-8 C-USA). Cal State Fullerton (36-22, 19-5 Big West) and Fresno State /

(35-17,12-3 WAC) round out the Regional.
The Cardinal struggled through the middle of the conference season, at
one dropping three games in a row. The team rebounded in their final j
weekend, however, beating No. 17 Washington before sweeping

UCLA.
"Obviously, it was a huge confidence builder :gj
to get those three wins last weekend," Lappin 1
said. "We came out and played aggressively,which

is what we need to do from now on. In the tournament
everyone starts on the same level."

Stanford hopes to carry the momentum from those wins
into the tournament opener against I'ulsa. Even though the stakes are higher in the postsea
son, the team has not prepared for this weekend any differently.
"We stuck with the same routine we have had all year long," Coach John Rittman said.

dinal into their first round matchup with Tulsa
in the Fresno Regional.
"We just had a somewhat short practice so that the
players had time to get ready to hit the road. We
wanted to make sure they had all their academics in
order so that they can be focused on softhall this
weekend."
The Tlilsa Golden Hurricane earned the auto
matic hid from Conference USA after winning
their league tournament last week with a victory
over Marshall. They won three out of four on the
weekend, dropping only a 1-0 decision to Thunder
ing Herd.
Much of Tulsa's offensive success has come off
the bats of Kelli McGlasson, Sara Dyer and Fresno
native Brooke Smart.
The Golden Hurricane won the C-USA title
after Smart's three-run blast broke a scoreless tie.
On the season, she has a team-high 10 homers and
28 RBI.
Julie Fennel (13-8) and Maren Genow (15-9)
have shared the bulk of the pitching duties this sea
son, compiling ERAs of 2.14 and 2.59, respectively.
Fennel threw a four-hit complete-game shutout in
the C-USA championship game.
"Tulsa, being a conference champion, is on a roll
right now coming into the tournament," Rittman
said. "They have a couple of good pitchers and play
good defense and they can put the ball in play.They
are a good program and that is where all of our en
ergy is going right now, focused on beating Tulsa."
Stanford and Tulsa will be facing each other for
the first time ever in the tournament.
In the other first round game in the Fresno Re
gional, host Fresno State will take on Cal State

Fullerton.
Fresno State finished on top of the WAC stand
ings this season but were knocked out of the confer
ence tournament by Hawaii.
"Fresno we know pretty well from playing them
in (he past, just about every year," Rittman said.
They also have one of the best hitters in the coun
try in Christina Clark."
Clark's .434 batting average, 66 hits and seven
homers are all team highs.The Bulldogs' freshman
ace Robin Mackin — a member of the Canadian
National Team who gave up just one hit in her high
school career — has amassed a 26-12 record and
averages 1.55 strikeouts per inning.
The Cardinal has an all-time 8-4 record against
Fresno. Stanford swept the teams' last meetings,
claiming a 3-2 eight-inning victory and a 7-0 shutout
in a 2004 doubleheader.
Against Fullerton, Stanford is 11-3 all-time, and
beat the Titans 4-2 in tournament play in March.
The Titans won the Big West title this year with
a 19-5 conference record. Outfielder Ashley Van
Boxmeer was named the league's Player of the
Year after tallying 13 home runs and 54 hits on the
season.
Ace Candice Baker (21-8) and Marissa Marzan
(12-8) lead a Fullerton pitching corps with a 2.23
overall ERA. Baker was the pitcher when the Car
dinal beat the Titans earlier this season.
The winner of the Fresno Regional will advance
to next weekend's Super Regional against the win
ner of the Alabama Regional — No. 5 Alabama.
Mississippi Valley State, Florida A&M or Georgia

Tech — with a spot in the Women's College World
Series on the line.
For now though, the players are not thinking
about Oklahoma.
"We are focused on ourselves," Lappin said.
"Because we know that if we go out and play our
best softball and play with energy, we can beat any
one in the country."

ergy is going right now, focused on beating Tulsa."
Stanford and Tulsa will be facing each other for
the first time ever in the tournament.
In the other first round game in the Fresno Re
gional, host Fresno State will take on Cal State

Fullerton.
Fresno State finished on top of the WAC stand
ings this season but were knocked out of the confer
ence tournament by Hawaii.
"Fresno we know pretty well from playing them
in (he past, just about every year," Rittman said.
They also have one of the best hitters in the coun
try in Christina Clark."
Clark's .434 batting average, 66 hits and seven
homers are all team highs.The Bulldogs' freshman
ace Robin Mackin — a member of the Canadian
National Team who gave up just one hit in her high
school career — has amassed a 26-12 record and
averages 1.55 strikeouts per inning.
The Cardinal has an all-time 8-4 record against
Fresno. Stanford swept the teams' last meetings,
claiming a 3-2 eight-inning victory and a 7-0 shutout
in a 2004 doubleheader.
Against Fullerton, Stanford is 11-3 all-time, and
beat the Titans 4-2 in tournament play in March.
The Titans won the Big West title this year with
a 19-5 conference record. Outfielder Ashley Van
Boxmeer was named the league's Player of the
Year after tallying 13 home runs and 54 hits on the
season.
Ace Candice Baker (21-8) and Marissa Marzan
(12-8) lead a Fullerton pitching corps with a 2.23
overall ERA. Baker was the pitcher when the Car
dinal beat the Titans earlier this season.
The winner of the Fresno Regional will advance
to next weekend's Super Regional against the win
ner of the Alabama Regional — No. 5 Alabama.
Mississippi Valley State, Florida A&M or Georgia

Tech — with a spot in the Women's College World
Series on the line.
For now though, the players are not thinking
about Oklahoma.
"We are focused on ourselves," Lappin said.
"Because we know that if we go out and play our
best softball and play with energy, we can beat any
one in the country."
