## Surging Softball faces Tulsa in first round of Fresno Regional 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
Talk about going out with a bang. Behind the efforts of seniors Catalina Morris and Lau
ren Lappin, No. 10 Stanford softball finished the Pac-10 season with a two-game sweep of
No. 1 UCLA. But conference play is all for naught now, as the Cardinal now enter the post
season, and the first steps on the road to Oklahoma City and the Women's College World Se
ries come this weekend.
Centerfielder Morris, named Pac-10 Player of the Week this week for the first time in her
career, has led the squad all season while Lappin has anchored the defense at catcher and
shortstop, earning Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year honors for the second year in a row.

The two hope to continue their success as the Cardinal (38-15,10-11 Pac-10) head to
Fresno, Calif., for NCAA Regional play this weekend. As the top seed in Fresno, Stan
ford will kick off the double-elimination tournament Friday night with TUlsa (34- y
22,15-8 C-USA). Cal State Fullerton (36-22, 19-5 Big West) and Fresno State /

(35-17,12-3 WAC) round out the Regional.
The Cardinal struggled through the middle of the conference season, at
one dropping three games in a row. The team rebounded in their final j
weekend, however, beating No. 17 Washington before sweeping

UCLA.
"Obviously, it was a huge confidence builder :gj
to get those three wins last weekend," Lappin 1
said. "We came out and played aggressively,which

is what we need to do from now on. In the tournament
everyone starts on the same level."

Stanford hopes to carry the momentum from those wins
into the tournament opener against I'ulsa. Even though the stakes are higher in the postsea
son, the team has not prepared for this weekend any differently.
"We stuck with the same routine we have had all year long," Coach John Rittman said.
