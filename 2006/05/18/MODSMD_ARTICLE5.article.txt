# Inner faith propels McCullough
## I like to think I am pitching for just one person, just Jesus. BECKY MCCULLOUGH, sophomore pitcher 
### ANDREW LOMELI STAFF WRITER 
When Becky McCullough steps inside
the pitcher's circle, she isn't concerned
about the loud Stanford Softball fans
bathed in red throughout the stands. She
doesn't worry about impressing her coach
or her teammates, either.
For the sophomore pitcher, it's about
only one audience member — God.
"I like to think I am pitching for just one
person, just Jesus," McCullough said. "1
hope that my pitching shows his character."
McCullough. a Presbyterian, de
scribes religion as the most important
part of her life. Since arriving at lTie
Farm, faith has provided her with a major
source of patience.
Church itself also provides a safe haven
for McCullough to escape from the pres
sures of softball and school.
"Church is my favorite activity outside
of school and athletics." she said, it's im
portant to be able to have church as a
place to get away from distraction, espe
cially since it's easy to get caught up in
pressures at Stanford. It's a refreshing
place to keep me on track."
'ITie extra patience has come in handy in
the midst of an up-and-down season, with
most games coming down to the final in

ning. McCullough admits she can he a per
fectionist when it comes to her play, often
leading to a tense on-the-field mentality.
With a team-leading 2.03 ERA and a
strong work ethic praised by her coaches
and teammates,McCullough indeed needs
all the rest she can get. Her efforts have led
to All Pacific-10 Conference Honorable
Mention in both her collegiate seasons.
"Becky obviously is a player with a lot
of heart, determination and drive," Coach
John Rittman said. "She has battled
through injuries and she works extremely
hard at what she does."
McCullough attributes much of her
work ethic to her childhood.
"My parents instilled in me at a young
age that hard work always pays off," she
said. "I put KM) percent into everything I
do. That's one thing I take away the most
from my early life."
While focusing on work, McCullough
also dedicated much of her time to playing
various sports as a kid. In the end, however,
the many softball camps she attended at
Stanford propelled her to focus on pitching.
McCullough doesn't rely on strikeouts
to collect outs. Hut her unique ability to
produce ground-ball outs and put her de
fense in positions to succeed has made her
just as effective as her harder-throwing
teammates.
In % innings, McCullough has notched
strikeouts and just 77 hits en route to a
10-5 season record.
"She's one of the best pitchers in the
country," Rittman said. "She does a great
job of keeping hitters off-balance and col
lecting the necessary outs, not necessarily
the strikeouts."
McCullough describes her role on the
team as that of the mood-setter. She said
her aggressiveness and search for perfec
tion establishes the intense tone for the
entire squad.
But despite her tough attitude on the
field. McCullough can still rely on her faith
to keep her patient and at peace.
"ITiere have been so many ups and
downs since coming here." she said. "But
understanding and accepting that every
thing happens for a reason — it has made
it easier to work without worrying as
much."
