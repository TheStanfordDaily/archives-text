# Iraqi students visit Farm
## EXCHANGE PROGRAM SHOWS THEM S.F., SACRAMENTO 
### NICK PARKER DESK EDITOR 
For the second consecutive year, Iraqi students have
arrived at Stanford to participate in a student-run or
ganization called Stanford-Iraq Student Exchange
(SISE). Two Iraqi students — one male, one female —
arrived on campus last week and will remain here until
Sunday. The students asked to remain unnamed due to
security concerns when they return home.
According to its Web site, SISE's goal is "to improve
Iraq-U.S. relations by connecting American undergrad
uates with their Iraqi counterparts and providing a
forum for intellectual and cultural exchange." SISE is
the first program of its kind in the country.
During their time on campus, the visiting students
have participated in activities designed to educate them

about not only the political and intellectual aspects of
the United States, but also its cultural wealth.
Last Saturday, the two Iraqi students traveled to San
Francisco where they visited tourist attractions such as
the Golden Gate Bridge, the Museum of Modern Art
and China Town.
On Monday, SISE brought the students to Sacra
mento, where Assemblyman Todd Spitzer (R-71st)
arranged a formal introduction for the Iraqi students on
the floor of the State Assembly.
The trip to the capitol went well, according to event
organizers.
"We were very happy that Assemblyman Spitzer
would arrange that for us," said SISE President Nikhil
Sachdev, a junior. "Tlie Iraqi students were interested in
finding out from the state officers how our government
works, and I think the trip went very well overall."

On Tuesday evening, SISE hosted a panel discussion
with the two students, David Patel, a doctoral candidate
in political science, and former Secretary of Defense
William Perry, a professor of management science and
engineering and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion.
Ilie panel covered a wide range of topics, ranging
from Iraq's education system to the country's shaky po
litical situation to the question of whether or not U.S.
military involvement was justified.
Perry had nothing but fond words for the two visit
ing students, saying he admired their bravery.
'Tve found these students to be both bright and
courageous," he said."They have been subjected to dan

even go to universities in Iraq. It took
even more courage to come here to
America."
All four panelists agreed that U.S.
involvement in Iraq will not, and can
not, end soon because Iraqis are de
pendent on the security that U.S. sol
diers provide in the war torn country.
"I think we need American troops
in Iraq to control the Iraqi govern
ment because sometimes our govern
ment makes mistakes," the female
student said.
Her male counterpart agreed.
"I think British and American
forces will remain in Iraq for at least

five or six more years," he said.
Patel and Perry echoed the Iraqi
students' predictions, saying that the
U.S. military's job is to train Iraqi offi
cers to keep the peace.
"I think the primary reason for
U.S. forces in Iraq is to train Iraqi se
curity officials," Perry said. "The
sooner we can get Iraqis trained and
get out of there, the better it will be for
everyone."
"I see no significant reduction in
U.S. troops in the next three to five
year," Patel said. "The ability of U.S.
troops to leave is completely de
pendent on our ability to train
Iraqis."
The Iraqi students also spoke
about their country's struggling econ
omy. Aside from oil, tourism is Iraq's
most promising economic activity, the
female student said. Her male peer

cited farming as another important
source of revenue.
The Iraqi students were in high
spirits and remained optimistic de
spite the problems facing their coun
try.
"My dream would be to serve my
country and to provide hope for
younger generations," the male stu
dent said.
SISE administrators have been
very pleased with the success of the
exchange thus far.
"I think the exchange has gone
very well," Sachdev said. "It's really
an incredible opportunity to have
these students here and to hear about
their lives in Iraq. I think they've en
joyed the experience, and I know
we've enjoyed it. My only regret is
that we could not bring more than
two of them here."
