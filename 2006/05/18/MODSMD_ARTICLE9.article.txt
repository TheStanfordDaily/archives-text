## EXCHANGE PROGRAM SHOWS THEM S.F., SACRAMENTO 
### NICK PARKER DESK EDITOR 
For the second consecutive year, Iraqi students have
arrived at Stanford to participate in a student-run or
ganization called Stanford-Iraq Student Exchange
(SISE). Two Iraqi students — one male, one female —
arrived on campus last week and will remain here until
Sunday. The students asked to remain unnamed due to
security concerns when they return home.
According to its Web site, SISE's goal is "to improve
Iraq-U.S. relations by connecting American undergrad
uates with their Iraqi counterparts and providing a
forum for intellectual and cultural exchange." SISE is
the first program of its kind in the country.
During their time on campus, the visiting students
have participated in activities designed to educate them

about not only the political and intellectual aspects of
the United States, but also its cultural wealth.
Last Saturday, the two Iraqi students traveled to San
Francisco where they visited tourist attractions such as
the Golden Gate Bridge, the Museum of Modern Art
and China Town.
On Monday, SISE brought the students to Sacra
mento, where Assemblyman Todd Spitzer (R-71st)
arranged a formal introduction for the Iraqi students on
the floor of the State Assembly.
The trip to the capitol went well, according to event
organizers.
"We were very happy that Assemblyman Spitzer
would arrange that for us," said SISE President Nikhil
Sachdev, a junior. "Tlie Iraqi students were interested in
finding out from the state officers how our government
works, and I think the trip went very well overall."

On Tuesday evening, SISE hosted a panel discussion
with the two students, David Patel, a doctoral candidate
in political science, and former Secretary of Defense
William Perry, a professor of management science and
engineering and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion.
Ilie panel covered a wide range of topics, ranging
from Iraq's education system to the country's shaky po
litical situation to the question of whether or not U.S.
military involvement was justified.
Perry had nothing but fond words for the two visit
ing students, saying he admired their bravery.
'Tve found these students to be both bright and
courageous," he said."They have been subjected to dan
gers none of us can even imagine. It took courage to
