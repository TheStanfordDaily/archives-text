# Shakespeare under the stars

### AMIN EL GAMAL 
If I were to describe Stanford Shakespeare Soci
ety's scrumptious production of "Love's Labour's
Lost" in one word, it'd be "spunk." Fully con
scious of the word's double entendre ("Labour's"
banks a great deal on such awareness), the sheer
spunk that the players exude is remarkably unfazed
by the show's delightful — but admittedly chilly —
outdoor Cantor Visual Arts Center venue.
If the show, which opened Wednesday and plays
through Sunday (all shows begin at 8:30 p.m. and
admission free with ID), were performed inside,
that spunk would have bounced off, if not through,
the walls. Outside, it had nothing to bounce off but,
perhaps the moon — though the production's daz
zling lights overshadowed even that celestial orb.
"There is a lot of 'playing' that is in this play,"
said sophomore Nisa Ari, who plays Moth, the be
guiling boy singer. "We are constantly adding new
ways to look at the old jokes by revising both our
voices and our physicality — both being things
that we have to be particularly aware of because of
the outdoor setting."
Senior Nick Allen, the show's director, empha
sized this physicality in the rehearsal process, en
couraging his cast to use clowning and play.
"[When performing in an outside venue], the
physical aspect of story telling becomes para
mount," Allen said. "We have worked hard to cre
ate clean blocking that tells the visual stories of sta
tus and action. Our brand of comedy is broad and
clown-based. Luckily for us, Shakespeare wrote for
that kind of theatre. His humor is bawdy and phys
ical. We try to capture that in an aggressive way."
The plot stems from four scholars' promise to

give up women and worldliness for three years in
the pursuit of knowledge.
"I was explaining the plot to someone outside
the show," sophomore Michael Bateman, who
plays Berowne, said. "She said, it sounds just like
Stanford!"
Indeed. StanShakes thrives on its commitment
to make the Bard's work accessible and relevant to
modern audiences.
"We keep our performance kinetic and engage
the audience to the point where they're jiving to
the comedic vibe and truly joining us in on the fun."
said Fabrice Palumbo-Liu. who plays Don Armado
(in a truly tour-de-force performance). "Basically,
we're committed to the idea that the Burd deserves
a chance to spit his game, just like any other re
spectable player."
Setting the story in 1930s Spain, Allen drew
from Spanish music, poetry and, perhaps most
prominently, visual art — as the centerpiece of the
set is a gigantic and stunningly-used Salvador Dali
painting.
"One of the most important rules in our produc
tion is that once beauty and passion are intro
duced, the world begins transform," Allen said. "So
in a sense, the rule is that the rules change and need
to be broken. The characters establish the rules of
their world and quickly break that world down."
Creating this world at the Cantor venue was no
easy task, but extensive vocal and tech work — a
generator had to be hauled out to the museum, ac
cording to Palley — helped the group conquer na
ture's wiles.
"Theatre's all about creating an alternative
world, an escape for the audience," sophomore
Matt Velasco. who produced the show, said. "But

when you're playing outdoors, the reality is that
you're subject to the whims of the environment.
We can't adjust temperature, change the weather
and re-route helicopters."
In spite of these issues, the venue gives modern
audiences a sense of how the works were original
ly performed and lends a further sense of reality to
the show.
"All too often we escape into a black-box the
ater and then emerge and forget the experience we
just had," said junior Jonathan Palley, who plays
the hilarious Costrad as if his life depended on it,
said. "Outdoors, ! think, makes the show more
'real' in the sense that it becomes more than an ex
tremely isolated experience but also a part of the
existence of the space and the world."
Senior Yana Kesala, who plays the saucy French
Jacquenetta in her last performance at Stanford,
emphasized the backstage dynamics of the cast.
"What most excites me is the playing that is hap
pening within the cast — people are really enjoy
ing themselves and it shows," Kesala said. "The
best part of the process was letting myself make the
character big and bold and giving myself license to
go all out."
Freshman Shelly Ronen, who plays the feisty
princess, agrees that much of the show's "spunk"
comes from the company's work to create an en
semble.
"The best part of the process was working in a
challenging space, playing with comedy and group
dynamics so as to create a product we can all be so
proud of," Ronen said.
The worst?
"Learning to do justice to the beautiful cos
tumes."
