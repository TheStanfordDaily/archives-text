## Editorial Long Live Exotic Erotic! 
### 
Wander down Lomita Drive this Fri
day, past the Knoll and Florence
Moore, down toward SAE and
Kappa Sig, and you will witness a spectacle.
A nervous Paly High School sophomore
moments away from having his fake SUID
confiscated by the police. Random newly
weds in bathrobes. Your maleTA in a thong.
Nakedness and semi-nakedness with a very
thin line between the two.
Around this time in May every year,
Stanford students ditch their textbooks, EE
problem sets and I HUM essays along with
their clothes to take part in the madness that
is Exotic Erotic. Hosted by 680 Lomita, the
event is Stanford's most famous party by far;
indeed, it has acquired an almost mythic rep
utation. Playboy once listed Exotic Erotic
among their top 10 college parties in the na
tion. For a place that is often preoccupied
with schoolwork. employment and other
practical matters, there comes a certain pride
in being ranked alongside those party
schools that we all — in our most private
moments — secretly wish we attended.
So lest the Editorial Board be accused of
trampling on your fun, allow us to express
our unequivocal support for Exotic Erotic.
The party may not be for everyone, but we
encourage the eager, interested and curious
among us to traipse up the hill to 680 around
10 p.m. this Friday.
Traditions are not worth sustaining sim
ply because they are traditions, but epic tra
ditions become infinitely more epic by virtue
of their fame and longevity. Years from now
you will not remember your 1438 in the
Draw or your grade in PWR 2 — hopefully,
you will even forget the acronym. But we as
sure you that vou will remember Exotic

Erotic. The hordes of recent and not-so-re
cent alumni who show up every year to be
rejected at the door validate this prediction.
Of course, with any myth comes mystery.
Question: Is Fixotic contrived and awkward?
Answer: As much as you want it to be. If you
arrive at 680 on Friday expecting to discuss
reform of the European Union, we can prac
tically guarantee a more uncomfortable con
versation than if you were fully clothed. But
Full Moon on the Quad certainly puts Exot
ic to shame for its sheer concentration of
theatrical unpleasantness, and you won't
have to take.a bath in Listerine ex post facto.
Question: Flow can I ensure that this hor
rible event taps its last keg on Friday? An
swer: It may be easier than you think. Be
cause it receives so much publicity. Exotic is
under constant surveillance by University
administrators. Hie party is in a state of in
definite probation. Last year's Exotic Erotic
was remarkable in that organizers were able
to pull off a party that was virtually hitch
free. Problems that had plagued Exotic
Erotic in the past — allegations of sexual as
sault. skirmishes with police officers, exces
sive drunkenness, theft — were almost non
existent. The continuation of this tradition
and the raucous fun it promises requires
general good judgment and restraint, the
kind that we practice at any other party.
Exotic Erotic has become a valuable sym
bol of that "other side" of Stanford. We
would like to believe that this party — unre
hearsed and open to interpretation —
would not survive at many of our rivals in the
Ivy League. There is something about Exot
ic that makes it both a big deal and a relaxed
occasion. And we wouldn't want it any dif
ferent.
