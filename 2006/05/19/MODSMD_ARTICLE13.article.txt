# Salute Your Shortz

### 
I enjoy a good crossword puzzle. Although
I'm not always in the mood to read about
federal wiretapping or what Tom Fried
man thinks the Middle East should look like,
I always pick up The New York Times, even
if it's just to sift through the Arts section in
search of a square diagram of black-and
white grids. In some eyes, this might make
me a spinster cat-lady or bored suburban
housewife. I don't have a problem with cats,
and those housewives on ABC are hot. I'm
fine with that.
Completing a crossword puzzle is like
having a conversation with its author."Ooh,
that's so smart," I find myself murmuring,
causing fellow students to think I'm halluci
nating a la John Nash.These puzzles provide
a sense of calm and are said to prevent
Alzheimer's.
To me, crossword puzzles are also status
symbols, like menthol cigarettes and gour
met coffee. If I ever saw a pretty woman sit
ting in a trendy cafe lighting a llirkish Silver
with the lit end of a finished Sunday cross
word puzzle, I'd probably fall in love.
Based on rigorous research conducted in
I-Hum and economics lectures. I know I'm
not alone in my love for crosswords. Cross
word puzzles are the diversion of choice
when confronted by the buzzing drone of an
emeritus professor that looks like the pe
dophile that was arrested down the street
from you in high school. Everywhere you
look there's another yawning student tack
ling The Daily's crossword puzzle. Wait a
second â€” The Daily's crossword puzzle?
That sad excuse for an inkblot courtesy of
Tribune Media Services, Inc.? When we have
access to free copies of The New York Times,
why would anyone settle for anything less
than Will Shortz?
Some find my contempt for The Daily
crossword to be a sign of pretension. I wish it
were so. Let me count the ways in which The
Daily crossword deserves to die:
1. Stretchy squares. I know why it hap
pens: some frustrated layout editor watching
the clock tick towards 1 a.m. knows she has
to get the sports wrap-ups, classifieds, bun
nies and puzzles all onto one page. It'd be

nice to maintain proportionality, but that
takes effort. So, let's see, a drag-and-drop
here, a little realignment there, and let's fit
the crossword puzzle into whatever space
we have left. That's why your G's start to
look like 6's and you can barely make out
your own printing.
2. Crappy clues. I think a typical day for
the crosswords editor at Tribune must in
volve a lot of online poker and Google
searches for naked celebrities, because
there's no other excuse for the shoddiness of
their clues. They range from the childishly
simplistic (" we there yet?") to the frus
tratingly obscure ("Winged insect"). I've got
one for you. Tribune: "Mammal." Or how
about" you!"?
3. Cleverness be damned! Hie fun of a
New York Times puzzle is in its cleverness. In
a puzzle themed "Cue the Opening," you re
alize that all the theme clues yield answers
beginning with the letter Q. So "Grizzlies
good at giving interviews" yields "Q and A
Bears" which, when seen on a crossword
grid, is just one letter away from "Panda
Bears." Get it? Clever!
4. Same ol\ same ol\ The New York Times
crossword gets increasingly harder each day,
starting with the easiest puzzles on Mondays
and the hardest ones on Saturdays. (Sundays
are similar in difficulty to Thursdays, but
longer.) This gives everyone a chance to
stretch themselves.The frumpy wage slaves at
Tribune, however, treat each day the same.
How boring.
