Prof. Paytan deserves tenure

We, the undersigned students, associates, and
recent graduates of the School of Earth Sci
ences wish to express our profound shock and
sadness at the recent decision to deny tenure
to Professor Adina Paytan in the Department
of Geological and Environmental Sciences.
Many of us consider Paytan a model of aca
demic and professional success and are very
confused and disappointed with the decision.
Anyone who reads her Curriculum Vitae
can see that Paytan has an impressive list of
qualifications and has been an active and in
novative member of both the scientific and
University communities. In a time of tight
ened purse strings for most major funding
organizations, Paytan has excelled at secur
ing research funding, and currently supports
one of the largest and most active labs in the
department. She has a long list of peer-re

viewed publications in preeminent journals,
and a strong record of advising Ph.D. and
M.S. students. In fact, her students have
twice won the Ocean Sciences Outstanding
Student Paper award at the largest oceanog
raphy meeting in the country.
Paytan is recognized by the scientific com
munity as being an excellent researcher and a
rising star in academics, and has won both the
National Science Foundation Career Award
in 2005 and the American Geophysical
Union's Oceanography Early Career Award
in 2004. in addition to numerous other presti
gious awards and commendations.
Paytan is dedicated to undergraduate edu
cation. not only in the breadth of classes she
teaches but also in the large group of under
graduate students who have gained unique and
valuable research experience working in her
labs. She is also very involved with
community outreach programs en
compassing all age groups, from
Geokids at the elementary school level
to providing local high school students
with summer research experience.
Moreover, losing Paytan will mean
losing a valuable role model, as she is
a successful female academic, a recog
nized leader in her field who is pas
sionate about the advancement of sci
ence, dedicated to her students, com
mitted to the community and support
ive of women and minorities, two un
derrepresented groups in academia.
The list of Paytan's accomplishments
and qualifications could go on for
pages; in fact, many of us consider her
to embody the exact qualities that
both the department and the Univer
sity seek in their faculty.
Paytan's commitment to excellent
scientific scholarship and nurturing a
supportive and healthy work envi
ronment are invaluable contribu
tions to the quality and integrity of
Stanford. We fully appreciate the rig
orous tenure process and the values
set by Stanford University; however,
we strongly disagree with the denial
of tenure to Paytan. We feel that this
decision will detrimentally affect
Stanford's ability to recruit and re
tain cutting-edge junior faculty who
promote a holistic and therefore
more productive research environ
ment. We hope that the Department
of Geological & Environmental Sci
ences, School of Earth Sciences and
Stanford University will carefully re
consider Professor Paytan's tenure
and her scientific and academic con
tribution to this University.
