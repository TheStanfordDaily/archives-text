While, in general. 1 loath to point out
the utter misery and dejection that
passes for existence in these times, I
thought I'd make an exception this week.
Life sucks.
Actually, that may not be entirely appro
priate; "suck" has all sorts of sexual innuen
dos attached, and 1 wouldn't want to hint
falsely at some kind of carnal activity.
I suppose, also, that life isn't really that
bad — as awful as things may be here, most
people at least have a base camp somewhere.
A place that is filled with fond memories and
friends, friends whose interests differ from
yours to a somewhat greater extent than sim
ply studying a different equation.
Of course, if one is an international stu
dent, such a place, if it exists, is far away. And
far away means it is rarely frequented.
Absence does not make the heart grow
fonder; actually absence makes people for
get. If you don't see your college roommate
for IS months, he or she becomes a little de
tached (an effect usually enhanced by the
fact that said roommate probably has a real
job and a real life).
Worse, your group of acquaintances and
your social sphere of influence still exist. Just
without you. The bonds they all formed dur
ing those wild days of youth are reinforced by
those occasional get-togethers which you can
never make (6,(KM) miles is rather a trek),
while your ties to the group fray and break
apart.
The loss of friends is not simply a conse
quence of distance, nor of the fact that we
lead very different lives from our former

peers. There is another phenomenon playing
a significant role: We're boring.
Actually calling us dull is probably an in
sult to blunt razor blades everywhere —
being dull is often accompanied by some sort
of self awareness, a quality we mostly certain
ly lack.
1 've just returned from a brief trip back to
the motherland, where I had the opportunity
to catch up with some old friends. To be fair,
the catching up went quite well at first —
there were many folks I hadn't seen for a
long time and who have had exciting things
happen in their lives.
The problems, though, started when I was
called to describe the happenings of my con
tinued survival. For sadly, when one's daily
routine involves waking up, thinking about
physics, complaining about life and going to
sleep, there's often little that is worth sharing.
So, one skates around the topic for a
while, until forced to fall back on the only re
alistic option: talking about work. In my case,
this was an educational experience. Not be
cause I taught anyone anything, but rather
because I learned a valuable lesson:The Cos
mological Consequences of G2 Compactifi

cations of M-Theory are not engaging.
The glassy-eyed appearance of one's for
mer friends as one begins to lecture them on
one's work is not a sign of fascination. Nei
ther is telling you to "shut up and talk about
something interesting."
In fairness to graduate students and their
friends, I should point out that the problem
isn't really that chatting about your studies is
intrinsically boring. In bite-size pieces, aca
demic research can be fascinating.
However, you gotta mix it up a little. The
obsession, the exclusion of anything else — it
simply doesn't make for good chat.
In fact, the single-mindedness brings us
nicely back to the root of the whole friend
ship (or lack thereof) problem. We fail to
make a new spectrum of friends here because
we retreat into our little bubbles of work.
And we fail to hang on to our older acquain
tances, because we have little to say of things
outside of these work-only enclosures.
A final note, and perhaps vague compen
sation for our sorry lives, is that it would only
be fair to point out that this slow dimming of
friendship is probably inevitable for every
one.
Eventually, people fall victim to conven
tion (which is to say: "in love") and do the
whole family thing. Or, I suppose, they re
treat so far into the fascinating world of
equations that reality — and its attendant
"other people" — becomes just another ab
straction.
