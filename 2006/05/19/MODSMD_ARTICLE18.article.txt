## SLE gave me a sense of community 
### ALYSSA SCHWARTZ 
I would like to congratulate the Editorial
Board for recognizing the importance of SLE,
and for calling on the University to ensure
that the intellectual stimulation of the pro
gram remains through the changes of the up
coming years ("SEE rages against the dying of
the light " May 18). However, the Board has
missed the point of SLE, and in doing so, rein
forces the stereotypes it calls to remove.
I chose to come to Stanford because of
SLE. The intellectual community was excit
ing to me, and Stanford is one of the only uni
versities that 1 am aware of that has a resi
dential education program — and I do not
mean Residential Education, the administra
tive department. Eor a high school senior
who wanted intellectualism without the
ivory tower, SLE was compelling. SLE was
everything Ed hoped it would he. I sat on the
floor in the Faisan lounge and talked about
Marx until 3 a.m., my tutor quoted T. S. Eliot
and everything I know today about writing I
learned fall quarter of freshman year.

More importantly, though, I found a place
where I could belong. The SLE community
wasn't perfect — no community is — but it
was okay to be a nerd there, and it was okay
to care about learning. Everyone at Stanford
is smart, but not everyone is intellectual, and
as the Daily acknowledges, SLE's bad repu
tation "says something more profound about
our campus culture." If it weren't for the
friends I made in SLE,both in my year and in
years above and following me, I would not
have felt at home here at Stanford.
I completed an honors thesis earlier this
week in which I argued that the intensity of a
community can help educational institutions
survive. It is from this understanding that I
object to yesterday's editorial. The editorial
states that "the biggest problem with the SLE
experience is that it is far removed from the
typical freshman experience." I would argue
that this is the best part of the SLE experi
ence. SLE students are self-selecting: if we
wanted a "typical freshman experience," we
would not have chosen to participate in SLE.
Moreover,"the fact that SLE is a small and

strong community" is important. SLE is suc
cessful because it fosters this community, be
cause its alumni return to tutor as juniors and
seniors and because they tell their high school
friends to participate in SLE. In the last five
years, six SLE students have come from my
high school, all because my sister chose to
participate in 1999.The perpetuity of SLE de
pends on the community, and the community
depends on SLE. If we overly-intellectual
kids had not had SLE, many of us would have
looked elsewhere for our college education.
If SLE is denied the "distinct group identity,"
there is no purpose to the program.
The argument that SLE's "distinct group
identity is a problem points to the campus
culture referred to earlier. The Board is un
likely to call on sororities and fraternities or
co-ops to be disbanded because they culti
vate a distinct group identity. And while I rec
ognize that the Board seeks to preserve SLE,
to denigrate the group identity is to denigrate
the program. If it's okay to have social group
identities, it is also okay to have in
tellectual group identities. SLE is
not for everyone, but neither is any
other social or intellectual group.
We do need to make sure that SLE
survives the housing changes and
the impending retirements of SLE's
current leadership, hut we do not
need to do this by changing the pro
gram. As for being made fun of. we
can take it. We know, from Bud
dhism and Marxism, Don Quixote
and Mark Mancall, that what we do
to change the world is far more im
portant than how we're perceived.
