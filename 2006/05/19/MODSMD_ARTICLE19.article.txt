## The 						lessons he taught 
### JIM TANKERSLEY 
For three glorious months during my freshman year, when both of us were
Stanford rookies. Bill Woo met me and 11 other disciples in an upper room
of the Comm Department.
Bill was a longtime editor at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch who came to the
Farm on a one-year fellowship and stuck around for 10 years. 1 still don't know
why he picked me for his first Writing and Reporting the News class,but I'll never
forget what he wore every day: a button-down shirt, khakis, and an undipped tie
— a college professor's uniform, in his mind.
He lectured in a low lament, sometimes so soft that the hum of a dozen
computers drowned him out.

He fed us great writing — Barton Gellman, Rick
Bragg, Bill's own columns (with his byline re
moved). He drilled us on spot news
played all the supporting roles: the bark
ing editor, the panicked correspon
dent, the belligerent flack. He gave
prizes for great leads. I still have
mine: an official Post-Dispatch re
porter's notebook, chopped in half
to fit into a back pocket.
We later moved our lessons to
the chipped bar of the Old Pro and
the backyard stream at the Alpine
Inn, always with Budweiser, always
overtipping the waitress. He coun
seled me and other editors at the
Daily and led our reporters through
lunchtime ethics workshops.
He came to my wedding, argued
Greek history with his tablemates
and asked my mother-in-law if she'd
hired professional bridesmaids, they
were so beautiful.
He talked me off several journal
istic ledges: After a disastrous in
ternship, he steered me back from
law school; last year, he threatened
to send me to China, Europe and a
doctoral program to cure burnout. I
only took my current job, covering
politics in Ohio, after Bill told me
"What the hell are you waiting for?"
Another former Daily editor posited this week that everything Bill did before
Stanford was prologue — he was simply honing the ability to tell perfect-length
stories to illustrate something for his students. "1 can't imagine," my friend said,
"that he was a better newspaper editor than he was a teacher."
Bill never told me to stay in newspapers, but he made me want to. He scold
ed me for error and impatience, then he pointed me toward improvement.Three
months before my first child is due, 1 realize he taught me as much about father
hood as journalism. And that was by design.
"1 want to suggest to you," Bill told my class nine years ago,"that good journal
ism does not often just happen. It is the result of applied intelligence, a working
set of values or principles and the interplay of points of view. If there is magic in
it.it is the same magic that human beings bring to all their enterprises — and those
wonders are displayed in countless varieties and glories."
Bill died last month of cancer. A campus memorial service will honor him
today. At another service for him last week, in St. Louis, a former United States
senator mourned Bill by declaring his lifelong profession all-but dead, too.
"There is no room in American journalism today for Bill Woo," he said.
With due respect, the senator was wrong. Bill had hope for American journal
ism. and it lives on in his students.
Yes, Bill came to Stanford troubled. He told us one afternoon that newspa
pers were sick, their readership shrinking — then admitted he didn't know how
to cure them.
1 channeled my disbelief into a column for his class, concluding that Bill could
n't bring circulation back right now because he did not buy quick fixes — that he
knew relationships, even those between people and a newspaper, take time and
trust and patience to build.
"If print journalism is dying," I wrote, "it is because there are few Bill Woos
left."
Bill gave me an A-minus — my nut graph was weak — and a coda, scrawled
in red ink at the bottom of the page, that hundreds of other disciples and 1 will
spread for years to come.
"I really hope you keep this message with you always," he wrote. "There are
no quick fixes, ever, for the things we hold dearest."
