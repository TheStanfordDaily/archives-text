### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Green Dorm Project and
Lotus Living Laboratory was recently
awarded $75,000 to continue research on en
ergy efficient and environmentally-friendly
buildings. The Stanford group was one of six
winners among a field of 40 in Phase II of the
People, Prosperity and the Planet (P3) stu
dent design competition, organized by the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
Mike Lin, a graduate student in mechan
ical engineering and one of the organizers of

the Lotus Living Laboratory class, called the
award "a great honor and a big pat on the
back."
Brainstorming sessions in the fall of 2()03
motivated Stanford to decide to build a
green dorm on campus â€” an environmen
tally conscious, sustainable building. As
scheduled,students will be able to move into
the dorm in the fall of 2009.
The Lotus Living Laboratory is a group
of students and faculty who research green
building technologies and feed new infor
mation to the architects and designers of the
green dorm.They received a Phase 1 People,
Prosperity and the Planet (P3) grant of
$10,000 last spring and competed against
other recipients of the Phase I grant for the
Phase II grant of $75,000.
Six Stanford students traveled to Wash
ington, D.C. for the competition, which was
held on May 9 to 10 on the National Mall.

The team presented their research to the of
ficials from the EPA, students from other
schools and the general public.
"We didn't really know what to expect,"
Lin said. "It was a really warm and welcom
ing environment, not competitive or cut
throat at all."
Freshman Chi Nguyen added."lt was re
ally inspiring to be in an environment with
other schools doing similar interesting and
incredible things."
Lauren Dietrich, a graduate student in
construction management and an organizer
of the Lotus Living Laboratory, agreed that
the trip was a positive experience.
"We completely immersed ourselves in
the project." Dietrich said. "Our presenta
tions went smoothly and the enthusiasm,
creativity and capability of the team shone
through."
In addition to winning the Phase II of the

P3 grants, the Stanford team also was award
ed the Green Globes award from the Green
Building Initiative. According to a
statement released by the Lotus Living Lab
oratory, Stanford was awarded the Green
Globes for "being the entry that showed the
most potential for commercialization and
expansion into the market place."
TTie statement said judges were especial
ly impressed with the project's goals, which
went beyond constructing a green dorm on
campus to developing a "larger program
that researches and educates about sustain
able pathways for resource use and building
development." The award included a cash
prize of $ 1.000.
The team plans to use the money to con
tinue their interdisciplinary research. Lin
said that they hope to begin the coordina
