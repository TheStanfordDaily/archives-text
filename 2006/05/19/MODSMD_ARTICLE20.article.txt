How to put one's finger on the shadow of a memory: Words be
come slippery, moments escape me, the past is hazy. Let us
speak of Bill Woo. Did he smile and laugh? Was he serious and
sincere? Was he energetic and upbeat? It's hard to say, for the mo
ments are long gone, tucked away like children into bed. But his spir
it lives on.
For me, Bill exists between the pages of the AP Stylebook. He lives
in precision and accuracy, each word selected "just so." He lives in de
tail. He lives in the care with
______ ——— which he addressed life.

He lives also in thought
fulness and in humor.
I open my eyes to
the world, just like he
taught me, noting the
details that would ordi
narily pass me by. I walk
on the bridge that cross
i es the creek, and I think
of him. I look at the
shapes of leaves, 1 note
the smell of the wind, 1
gaze into the water rush
ing beneath me. Bill
would have checked to
see if there were fish.
So this is how he lives
on.
In the fall quarter, I
took a reporting class
with Bill. Before long, 1
learned to seek him out
i in the stairwells before
class. He'd rove from
floor to floor like an actor
rehearsing his lines, getting
ready for the performance of
teaching. Sometimes I'd find him in the
journalism lounge, leafing through a
newspaper or two. Other times he'd put

his head around our door, just to see who
was there, checking in on the journalism
students, his young proteges.
And in class, how he celebrated the spirit of journalism! When
newspapers were down. Bill found a way to revive them. If we became
disheartened, he revived us. Bill's humor squirreled its way into every
class. It will be impossible to forget him in a bout of classroom high
jinx impersonating his first editor, Mr. Ray Lyle, Bill's voice booming,
just like Mr. Lyle's once did, over an imaginary loudspeaker.
As the year went by and the side effects of Bill's chemotherapy
worsened, he began to suffer from a thick and unrelenting cough. The
cough made talk difficult and extended conversations practically im
possible. This was the cruelest part, and 1 expect it haunted him at
night. He had so much to share; so much that needed to be said.
On our last day of class. Bill's cough subsided for a merciful half
hour while he delivered his final words. Like the eye of the storm, it
was a peaceful moment for us all, and I imagine that while Bill deliv
ered his closing words, he let his sickness go just for a moment. But I'll
never know that. Bill kept his sickness private, out of sight. If he dis
cussed it at all, he treated it in the most matter-of-fact way, as though
CAT scans and chemotherapy were as ordinary as cereal with milk.
Bill's final words were his gift to us. Cathartic, terrifying: There was
so much we all had to do to make him proud. When he was finished, he
left the room, leaving each of us to our own thoughts. My throat stung,
and blurry vision blotted out the classroom. I'm certain I wasn't the
only one to feel that way.
Bill once said he was "lucky" to have me in his class. If he was lucky,
I was 10,000 times luckier. Lucky, lucky, lucky me.
