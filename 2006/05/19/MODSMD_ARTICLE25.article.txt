## ELITE WOMEN LOOK EVEN TOUGHER FOR 2007

Women's Basketball: 26-8,15-3
Pac-10, NCAA Elite Eight

Caught between losing five seniors and gaining
a highly touted class of recruits, expectations
for this year's Stanford Women's Basketball
team were a bit lower than those set for last year's
top-ranked squad. But the Cardinal (26-7,13-3 Pac
-10) silenced the cynics when they came within one
charge call of the Final Four, capping what was sup
posed to be a "transitional year."
Down 60-50 with 11.4 seconds left against LSU,
two-time Pac-10 Player of the Year Candice Wiggins
drove the lane and kicked out a pass to senior guard
Krista Rappahahn, who drained the three. But
Stanford's excitement was shortlived as the shot was
waved off after referees called Wiggins for a charge
on two-time Wooden Award winner Seimone
Augustus. The Tigers hit two free throws to seal the
62-59 win.
This year's trip to the regional finals was the third
straight time head coach Tara VanDerveer's teams
have been stopped one step short of the Final Four.
In the Sweet Sixteen, Stanford played its finest
game of the season, upsetting No. 2 seed Oklahoma
and All-American center Courtney Paris, 88-74.
Junior Brooke Smith had a sensational night with 35
points, shooting 14-of-16 from the field to draw com
parisons to Bill Walton from ESPN's commentators.
Stanford lost in the Pac-10 conference tourna
ment finals for the second time in the tournament's
five-year history, 85-76 in overtime to UCLA. In the
finals, Rappahahn surpassed the previous single sea
son record of 81 three-point shots.
Stanford finished the regular season on a 15-2
run en route to their sixth straight regular confer
ence crown.
With the return of all but one starter, the Cardinal
look to enter next season ranked in the top five.
