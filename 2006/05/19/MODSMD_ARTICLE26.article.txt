Women's Gymnastics: 18-3,5-1 Pac-10
Pac-10 Champs, 3rd at NCAA Regionals

No. 15 women's gymnastics was bitterly disappointed not to qualify for the
NCAA Championships, but incredible individual performances high
lighted the season.
Sophomore Tabitha Yim peaked at a top ranking in the all-around. No. 2 in
floor and beam, and No. 3 in bars. Yim ended up third in floor and ninth in bars at
the NCAA Championships.
Sophomore LizTricase stayed at the No.l national ranking in bars for
four straight weeks and earned three perfect tens on the season on the appa
ratus.
Senior Natalie Foley, the Stanford gymnast holding the record for the most
All-American honors, earned a ticket to the national championships, where she
placed fifth in the bars.
Freshmen Kelly Fee and Nicole Ourada, who was the NCAA West Regional
bars runner-up, also made key impacts.
"I have no regrets looking back on the season," senior Glyn Sweets said. "I'll
remember how hard we worked and how much fun we had."

BALANCING ACT: Senior Natalie Foley makes it
look easy in the 2006 home opener. The Card claimed
the meet, and Foley would finish fifth nationally in bars.
