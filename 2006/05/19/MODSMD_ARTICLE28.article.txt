## BIG DANCE STREAK SNAPPED AT 12 
### 
Men's Basketball: 16-14,11-7 Pac-10, NIT Second Round
Early losses to UC-Irvine, Montana and Division-I newcomer UC-Davis set
the tone from the start: Stanford woudl miss its first NCAA Tournament since
the 1993-1994 season, despite entering the season ranked 13th.
The Card did improve their play entering the Pac-10 season and cruised to a 11-7
conference record, good enough for a fifth in the league. But a first-round loss to
Arizona in the conference tournament ended any NCAA hopes.
Stanford did earn its fourth NIT berth in school history. There, the Card beat
Virginia at home before falling at Missouri State, 76-67.
Matt Haryasz, Dan Grunfeld ard Chris Hernandez all played well offensively in their
final seasons on the Farm. Haryasz led the team in scoring, averaging 16.2 points per
game, while Hernandez and Grunfeld each chipped in double digits as well
The Card also got a major contribution from each of the team's three freshman.
Point guard Mitch Johnson started 20 of the Cardinal's 30 games and Anthony Goods
and Lawrence Hill each played significant minutes as the season wore on. Next year,
incoming posts Brook and Robin Lopez figure to make an even greater contribution.

FIRST ROUNDER?: After a season in whiih only an eye injury could hold him back, Matt Haryasz now looks
forward to a bright NBA future. He and Chris Hernandez were named First Team All-Pac-10 this year.

SHEER WILL: Senior guard Dan Grunfeld never looked the same after an
ACL tear versus Cat last year. Still, he averaged 12 points — mostly on heart.
