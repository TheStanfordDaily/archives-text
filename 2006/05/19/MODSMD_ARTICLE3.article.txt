## SSS urges recycled paper use Many University departments still do not use recycled paper 
### ANNY LIN STAFF WRITER 
Despite information enumerating
the environmental perks of recycled
paper, many University departments
have not opted to use it. As a result, Stu
dents for a Sustainable Stanford (SSS)
began a campaign this spring to con
vince department administrators to pur
chase recycled paper.
Prior to SSS's push, only half of the
approximately 800 separate paper pur
chasers on campus had been buying re
cycled paper.
According to Julie Muir, community
relations manager at the Stanford Recy
cling Center, recycled paper uses post
consumer waste paper to make new
paper, while virgin paper uses wood. Re
cycled paper not only conserves trees,
but in comparison to producing virgin
paper, saves energy and produces 74
percent less air pollution and 35 percent
less water pollution.
SSS President Emma Yuen, a junior,
said the group has approached this chal
lenge a number of ways. The group first
invited paper purchasers around cam
pus to a lunch forum where they pre
sented their case for recycled paper to
administrators. They also contacted the
individual departments not purchasing
recycled paper to request time for a
presentation during staff meetings.
"There is a lot of mistrust about recy
cled paper," Yuen said. "People are
afraid the paper will jam or create dust in
their copy machines and printers. How
ever, now they've perfected the quality
of recycled paper so this will not happen
anymore than it does with virgin paper."
In order to demonstrate to holdout
departments the quality of recycled
paper, SSS is now sending hand-written
letters to department administrators. At
tached to the letter is a sample packet of
six sheets of different types of recycled
paper and a price list showing that they
can purchase recycled paper at a lower
cost than virgin paper.
Before being contacted by SSS, An
drew Morrow, administrative associate
in the Department of Anesthesia, was
unaware that his department was not
buying post-consumer waste paper.
"I appreciated being contacted be
cause I had already assumed that recy
cled paper was the default," Morrow
said."ln fact, we had not been buying re
cycled paper. Maybe before there was a
reason not to, but I found out that recy
cled paper is cheaper and of good quali
ty."
Kay Wangelin, administrative associate
of the Department of Petroleum Engineer
ing, also learned through SSS efforts that re
cycled paper was the better choice. After re
ceiving their information. Wangelin or
dered one test ream and plans to order all
post-consumer waste paper from now on.
"1 learned that I could get the same qual
ity and brightness for a little less money

than regular paper," Wangelin said. "In the
past this has not been the case and SSS
brought this to my attention."
In total, Yuen reported that their efforts
convinced over 50 departments to switch to
post-consumer paper. SSS is continuing its
push with departments who have so far re
sisted the switch.
"I am really glad there is a group of peo
ple on campus focused on the issue because
it is very important to the success of recy
cling," Muir said. "In order to make change
happen and stick, people on campus need
to be educated on the benefits of using recy
cled content paper and other products â€”
this takes time and dedication."
