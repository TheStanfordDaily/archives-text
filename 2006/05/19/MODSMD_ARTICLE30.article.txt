# No NCAA CROWN, BUT A SILVER YEAR FOR SWIM

Men's Swim and Dive: Ist at Pac-10s,
3rd at NCAAs

sports teams have earned bragging rights like the men's swim
ming and diving. Finishing the season with a No. 1 national dual
meet ranking, and a third place finish at the NCAA Championships,
the squad claimed their 25th straight league title under Coach Skip
Kenney.
While the men were hoping for their first NCAA title since 1998, the
season will be remembered for their incredible victories and performanc
es. The men's only dual meet loss came to the USC, and it was easily
overshadowed by the Stanford-Cal dual meet, which has since been
dubbed "the fastest dual meet in swimming history."
At Pac-lOs, Hongzhe Sun won all three individual events to be named
Swimmer of the Meet. And at NCAAs, Ben Wildman-Tobriner finished a
banner year by sprinting to second place in both the 50 and 100-yard
freestyles. Meanwhile, led by freshman Dwight Dumais, the divers con
tributed more points this year than any season in recent history.
With 216 of 245 NCAA points returning, next year's squad could be
even more formidable.
