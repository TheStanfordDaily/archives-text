## McCoy's FIRST YEAR: PROMISE, YOUTH — AND AN ALLAMERCIAN 
### 
WRESTLING: 7-6,4-3 PAC-10, 7TH AT PAC-lOS

165-pound senior captain Ray Blake (41-13), 125-pound sophomore captain Tanner
Gardner (37-13) and sophomores Josh Zupancic (22-4,149 pounds) and Scott
Loescher (21-19,157 pounds) led Stanford wrestling in its first season under new
head coach Kerry McCoy.
Stanford hosted the Pac-10 Tournament at Maples Pavilion, and finished seventh with
54.5 team points. There, Gardner earned the Cards highest individual finish at second. He
advanced to the NCAA Championships with Blake, who finished third in his weight class.
Meanwhile, Scott Loescher and Luke Feist finished fourth and fifth respectively.
At the NCAA Championships, Blake's Stanford career came to an untimely end, as
two early losses bounced him from the competition.
Gardner, however, managed to place eighth in the tournament. He becomes Stanford's
12th All-American wrestler, and the first since Matt Gentry in 2(X)4.
"I hope that they realize that we can compete with and beat anybody," McCoy said.
"Hopefully they take that to heart, and they learn that at Stanford they bring more to the
table."
