Champions

Synchronized Swimming Championships, March 24-26 at Avery Aquatic Center. The
win capped an undefeated season for the Cardinal and the home crowd saw sopho
mores Sara Lowe and Courtenay Stewart win national honors in the solo swim and the
technical elements, respectively.
Stewart and Lowe, both Athens Olympians, won the duet competition ten times in 2006
with unchallenged technical strength and athleticism. Their tenth victory, at the U.S.
Synchronized Swimming Senior Nationals in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. April 29, likely made
them the first collegiate duo in the sport's 62-year history to win the nation's top prize.
The Cardinal "A" trio of Stewart and juniors Samantha Bongiovanni-Duclos and Liz
Markman swam to eight golds this season and took second in the Collegiate Championships
to an Ohio State trio.
