# ROOFED: VOLLEYBALL CLAIMS JUST FOUR WINS

### 
Men's Volleyball: 4-24,2-20 Pac-10

Men's volleyball struggled all season with their
consistency on offense and defense. Stanford
notched a pair of wins in January over UC-
Santa Cruz and UC-San Diego, and recorded back-to
back victories over Pacific and Springfield in February,
but then dropped the last 15 matches of the season, 12 of
them sweeps.
One of five senior starters this season, opposite hitter
Ben Reddy led Stanford's offense and notched team
high kills in nearly every match, finishing the season with
444 — nearly five per game. Reddy also led the team
with 41 aces and finished second in digs and third in
total blocks.
Meanwhile, junior libero Brian Lindberg (165 digs,
1.90 per game) and senior middle blocker Chris Ahlfeldt
(64 blocks) anchored the defense.
Head coach Don Shaw retired at the end of the sea
son, having coached the men to a 94-103 record in seven
years and the women to four NCAA titles and the best
winning percentage in NCAA history in 16 years.
