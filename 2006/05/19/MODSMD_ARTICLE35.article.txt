# FENCING TAKES SEVENTH AT NCAAs
## 
### 
Behind seniors Steven Gerberman and
Martin Lee and freshmen Eva Jellison and
Teddy Levitt, all Ail-Americans, the Card
finished seventh in the nation — despite a
roster of just six. The Cardinal dominated
Western Regionals to reach the NCAA
Finals.
A season highlight was Jellison's win
over Olympic gold-medalist Mariel Zagunis

of Notre Dame. Jellison won the bout by a
score of 5-1, handing Zagunis just her third
loss in two seasons.
"My coaches always tell me I have the
ability to beat anyone, and in this case I
just bared down and trusted myself,"
Jellison said. "It's given me that little extra
boost of confidence for future meets."
