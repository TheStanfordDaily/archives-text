ROXY SASS
INTERMISSION SEX GODDESS

Roxy can't say how many times she has been asked, what is the ulti
mate way to spice up your love life? Well children, just picture this: You
walk into the room dressed up as a naughty little school-girl. He's dressed
up as the sketchy TA who's going to "help" you with your homework.
Next thing you know, he's ripping your clothes off and pretty soon, you're
in the middle of a fabulous session with your hookup for the week. You
both climax, and rest for a little while. Another end to a fabulous night, or
is it?
What if you could repeat the experience over and over again—
rewind, fast forward, pause, watching your sexcapade over and over
again? Well kids, you're in luck. With the magic of a recording device, you
can capture the entire thing on tape and repeat it as your heart sees fit.
Today we are going to talk about one of Roxy's favorite subjects:
voyeurism. Hugh Hefner has made an entire fortune off young (and old)
male sexual fantasies. Why not follow his lead and dive into this oh so or
gasmic hobby?
Don't look so shocked! Filming yourself is not just for pedophiles and
perverts. It is a perfectly healthy way to improve your sex life. I mean, how
many times have you been in the middle of a fabulous sack session, only
to forget the juicy details by the next morning thanks to your good friends
Jack and Jose. Roxy can't say that it hasn't happened to her— she remem
bers the fabulous orgasm (closely followed by another), but doesn't re
member if it happened during missionary, doggie, or cowgirl. These are
good things to know— it helps you get in tune with your sexuality. And
ladies— knowing how you achieved that big O can help you in the future
with Freshie McClumsypants.
Now. in entering the fabulous world of voyeurism there are a few
things to keep in mind: first off, it's totally ok to watch the video in the pri
vacy of your own room, but it is not ok to show it to all your frat buddies.
Remember in "American Pie" when Jim let his friends (and the rest of the
school) watch Nadia undress herself (and a little more than that) in his
room? That's bad. It's completely ok to use it for excitement at other
times, but it's not ok to let your friends use it too — unless your partner in
crime says it is. Believe me, unless her name is Jenna Jameson (or Roxy
Sass) she probably would not be okay with it. It's also perfectly okay to
use it as a teaching tool-especially if you can go at it again with the same
person. Roxy has had many a-sessions with boys she's filmed with. It just
seems to get better every time. The best way to do it is in front of a mirror,
while filming. That way, you can correct your mistakes as you go.
Also, sex tapes sure beat the hell out of porn. What could be better
than a porn tape starring yours truly? Plus, if your girl's a screamer, it
might be kind of nice hearing your name over and over. And ladies, you
can finally see the look on your guys' face when

you've reached the climax—trust me, it's a thing

of beauty. It also shows you which positions flat-

ter you the most, and whether your bed
room acrobatics truly gave you that work-

out you decided to skip in lieu of

sex.

In conclusion, as long as

you play it safe and make sure

that your tape doesn't reach

the wrong hands, you

could have yourselves a
. bonafide academy-

awards-worthy-

blockbuster hit

faster than you
can say: "You

poke it, you
own it!"
