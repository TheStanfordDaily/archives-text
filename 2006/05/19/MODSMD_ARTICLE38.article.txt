# The 						'Code' is broken
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN Intermission Sherlock Holmes 
Okay. I've got a confession to make. I've never actually

u \ul "The Da Vinci Code." It was one of those books I didn't get
.11. >und to because the hype was overwhelming by the time I'd
i \ en heard of it (kind of like Harry Potter). And vou know it

isn't cool to read those "popular" books everyone else buys in
i he airport bookstore. Bleh.

But strangely enough, this didn't stop me from snatching
up the press screening for the flick (and subsequently in
voking the wrath of my beloved Intermission editors, who

wanted to see it themselves) to check out Director Ron
Howard's rendition of the story.
I came in with high hopes. How could the former child star

irom entrallingTV mysteries such as "Andv Griffith" and
Happy Days" go wrong on directing the tale of a church-led

Mwispiracy to hide the true story of Jesus Christ? Plus, that Hick
I loward did about Apollo 13 in the '90s was pretty good —it

own had Tom Hanks in it. too. Yep. while the book might not
luw peaked my interest,all signs pointed to movie awesomeness,

Unfortunately, just because something is "totallv sup-

posed to be great"doesn't necessary mean it will he. well."great"
(eilie second Star Wars trilogy).The film has those scenes that
hordei line on cheesy, although it is hard to say exactly why. (Dur-

iii!" i mo such moment, my fellow attendee leaned over to explain
111.ii ii really didn't come across that way in the book." but she

ot mltln i put her finger on what exactly was different either — just
ill,it it wasn't working nearly as well). But again, there are also sonic

hmllv w ,11 in .ind clever hits interspersed throughout. Perhaps "hit-and-

urns is I lie Ivst way to put it.
In pel licular*the first 30-40 minutes of the flick left me rather con-

lusiil I luilliHlv idea what was going on or why it was even relevant — and
mil in Ih.u iH)|r I can't wait to see what happens next" sort of way. Obvious
ly .1 j-mmhl nivsUrv should leave things up in the air. but it should also ensure
ih.ii tin- aiulic tkv cares enough to stay engaged and find out what happens
iK'\t s.ulh. 11i ill\ of the twists in the plot are quickly and conveniently re
st >|\yd. bareh c\ en giving the viewer a chance to ponder them before being
spotm Iftl the.answers.

Siu'h wasted potential is especially apparent in movie like this.

Alll • i .ill the hook has a premise that is incredibly fascinating, and I know
iloamis <>| pcopk who were riveted as readers. While I found the movie
\ k'w.iMr. iii.il decently entertaining, my thoughts couldn't help but keep rc
luimni' Id tlk' l.ict that it could have been not only okay, but great.

I. if ilk- most part, the cast does a fine chough job with their charac-

ki v.ilih. nigh I'm not sure if I Innks would have been my first choice for

11 k' ft >1 >i It »nc. though. Oh yeah.arid the guy who plays Silas is a perfect
hi I ic.ikv.but perfect.

In sum. while "The Da Vinci Code" is not everything it

could be. it's also not a bomb along the lines of "Ocean 12" (I ac- I

tually felt ripped off after seeing that — even though I'd attended a free press
screening... oh. those precious two hours of my life gone, gone forever). If
you're inspired to view the film, go ahead. You'll probably enjov it enough to
make it worth the ticket price. But if you're not really that interested to begin
with, don't expect actually seeing the movie to change your mind about that
