### JOSHUA SMITH RACHEL TORRES INTERMISSION SCOPOPHILIACS 
(Rachel Torres: It's that time of year again. Not
just for your yearly woman's exam (Josh, take
note), but also for the Stanford Student Film Festi
val.
Joshua Smith: That's gross, dude. Moving 0n...
this year's theme is "Scopophilia " which the Stan
ford Film Society (SFS) kids claim means "the love
or pleasure of looking," but Rachel and I know that
it refers instead to people who take joy out of play
ing with their navels.
RT: Ha! Navel is a funny word.
JS: Rachel, you're dumb.
RTi Not as dumb as 1 look.
JS; Uh...
Anyway,Lin my infinite wisdom, know that
you attended last night s kickoff for the festival and
viewed the slew of cinematic masterpieces.
JS: Hell yeah! I loved "Crowbar Dreams." That
| was some scary S-word.
RTi Right. 50... The festival continues tonight
and tomorrow in Cubberley at 7:30 pm each night.
JS: Here are previews of the remaining films that
we had'the pleasure of screening. Apologies to

FRIDAY!!!!!

"Geo<a<hing:
From the Web to
the Woods,"
Directors: Jeff Orlows
ki and Tessa Banks
Some nerds spend countless
hours engaged in furious debate
over whether the "Anakin Sky
walker" and "Darth Vader"
pages should be combined on
Wikipedia. Others, as portrayed
in this engrossing and beautifully
shot documentary, actually see
I I sunlight once in a while. Tney're
"qeocachers" —outdoorsy types
wno use ridiculously expensive
GPS devises to find random
things in the woods. That's, like,
cooler than a scruffy-looking nerf
herder. ; | B
"Love for Hyer,"
Dir. Amy Aniobi
See, the title's funny 'cuz "Hyer"
is the main character's name. It's
a pun. In any event, this is just
your average parent's weekend
story involving a gav student
(Hyer) hiring (get it?I) a lady
friend to pose as his girlfriend so
his he can stay in the closet for his
mom. Both hilarity and poignan
cy ensue in this well-cranea story
from a filmmaker who knows
how to make a pleasing movie
soundtrack. J
-wSjl dflH

"Please Be Asleep for
Takeoff," Dir. Em
manuel Osei-Kuffour
Shot on location in a Southwest
jet (really), "Takeoff" definitely
wins the festival award for most
extras in a film. [Editor's note: in
case you're curious, "Gandhi"
holds that title for studio films,
and that little flick won some Os
cars. Just FYI.] This portrait of a
stressed-out, suit-clad guy flying
out fbr his medical School inter
view epitomizes every flyer's
worst nightmare.
"Tell Her Something,"
Dir. Jack Conte
This awfully professional music
video shows tne Spins Band at
their best. Dave Baron (one third
of Stanford's celebrities, if the In
termission's Party Snooper is to be
believed) leads campus's best
known band through this lovely
romp involving some weird meta
burglary, excellent lighting, and a
killer bass-line.
"Go West,"
Dir. Nayelli Gonzalez
Daydreaming through a lec
ture pn Frederick Jackson Turn
er's "Frontier Thesis," as the main
character does, probably strikes a
chord with a lot of you, fair read-

ers. The rest of the film— involv
ing a man scampering around in
a top hat, and, well, some other
stuff— may not. But hey, that's
no reason not to see this festive
romp.
"A Series of
Glimpses,"
Dir. Andrew Keaveney
The title really says it all. Also,
droplets on the inside of a win
dow attached to a motor vehicle
rambling through an unnamed
East Asian location makes for a
rollicking good time.
"Better Off Undead: A
Zombie Musical," Dir.
Mike indler
Please, Please Please! Please,
Mike! Tell me you've finally fin
ished your zombie musical mas
terpiece! I awaited it ever so im
patiently a year ago, and was
sorely disappointed by the techni
cal difficulties that resulted in its
absence from the film festival!
Please say you've completed it!
Please let me see it! Damn it, you
must — if you don't, Mike, I'll be
relegated to using exclamation
points forever!
Also appearing:
"Socializafion Complete/'
Dir: Jun-Eun Shin

SATURDAY!!!!!

"Quiz Heads,"
Dir. Cindy Wang
and Rachel Yong
Did you know Stanford has a auiz
bowl team? And that an SAE frat boy
won College Jeopardy? This docu
mentary looks at an aspect of Stanford
life that you may not have been aware
of. Includes fantastic close-ups of
players' bewildered faces as obscene
ly difficult questions are asked.
"Play with Me,"
Dir. Nahid Samsami
Samsami has crafted a short golden
nugget of a movie that depicts varia
tions on the quintessential Stanford in
teraction — the one where you com
miserate with your
dormmate/lover/person lending you
use of a cigarette lighter about how
you both have 1 0-page papers to write
for Monday, and then you both vow to
get totally wasted at your frat of choice
on Saturday.

"la Musa,"
Directors: Cole Paulson, Jen
Aguilar and Teresa Ingram
Shot on location in Florence, Italy,
"La Musa" has a neato soundtrack of
Italian rap and an artsy sensibility that
befits the short film genre. Check it:
you watch footage of someone filming
a person taking pictures of unsuspect
ing Florentines. It's meta-voyeuristic.
"Model Man,"
Dir. Steven Tagle
"Model Man" is like Scopophilia's
big budget summer blockbuster, with
an elaborate production, requisite
special effects, intricate storyline and
a nicely packaged moral — being that
robots are shitty lovers. Intermission
writer Barrett Sheridan moonlights as
the model man himself, and his per
formance is perfectly robotic and
creepy.

"lesbians/'
Dir. Sarah Garmisa
This short film is, quite literally,
about phone sex. The camera is
trained on two cell phones, held by
tattooed female hands, and we watch
as the phones are made to kind of rub
up and down each other and make
shrieky feedback nosies. It makes you
feel almost dirtier than "The L Word/'
"llama Mamas,"
Dir. Keenan Newman
Awww! Llamas are so cute! This fun,
well-made documentary embodies the
meditative, yet quirky quality that lla
mas imbue in the lives of the two
women who call themselves the Llama
Mamas and run the Rainbow Ridge
Llama Ranch in Petaluma, CA. Tne
film perfunctorily covers that most in
famous llama quirk: spitting.
Also appearing: "You Have My
Eyebrows," Dir. Cole Paulson ana
Melanie Reynard"Animas," Dir.

"Love for Hyer,"
Dir. Amy Aniobi
See, the title's funny 'cuz "Hyer"
is the main character's name. It's
a pun. In any event, this is just
your average parent's weekend
story involving a gav student
(Hyer) hiring (get it?I) a lady
friend to pose as his girlfriend so
his he can stay in the closet for his
mom. Both hilarity and poignan
cy ensue in this well-cranea story
from a filmmaker who knows
how to make a pleasing movie
soundtrack. J

"Please Be Asleep for
Takeoff," Dir. Em
manuel Osei-Kuffour
Shot on location in a Southwest
jet (really), "Takeoff" definitely
wins the festival award for most
extras in a film. [Editor's note: in
case you're curious, "Gandhi"
holds that title for studio films,
and that little flick won some Os
cars. Just FYI.] This portrait of a
stressed-out, suit-clad guy flying
out fbr his medical School inter
view epitomizes every flyer's
worst nightmare.
"Tell Her Something,"
Dir. Jack Conte
This awfully professional music
video shows tne Spins Band at
their best. Dave Baron (one third
of Stanford's celebrities, if the In
termission's Party Snooper is to be
believed) leads campus's best
known band through this lovely
romp involving some weird meta
burglary, excellent lighting, and a
killer bass-line.
"Go West,"
Dir. Nayelli Gonzalez
Daydreaming through a lec
ture pn Frederick Jackson Turn
er's "Frontier Thesis," as the main
character does, probably strikes a
chord with a lot of you, fair read-

ers. The rest of the film— involv
ing a man scampering around in
a top hat, and, well, some other
stuff— may not. But hey, that's
no reason not to see this festive
romp.
"A Series of
Glimpses,"
Dir. Andrew Keaveney
The title really says it all. Also,
droplets on the inside of a win
dow attached to a motor vehicle
rambling through an unnamed
East Asian location makes for a
rollicking good time.
"Better Off Undead: A
Zombie Musical," Dir.
Mike indler
Please, Please Please! Please,
Mike! Tell me you've finally fin
ished your zombie musical mas
terpiece! I awaited it ever so im
patiently a year ago, and was
sorely disappointed by the techni
cal difficulties that resulted in its
absence from the film festival!
Please say you've completed it!
Please let me see it! Damn it, you
must — if you don't, Mike, I'll be
relegated to using exclamation
points forever!

SATURDAY!!!!!

"Quiz Heads,"
Dir. Cindy Wang
and Rachel Yong
Did you know Stanford has a auiz
bowl team? And that an SAE frat boy
won College Jeopardy? This docu
mentary looks at an aspect of Stanford
life that you may not have been aware
of. Includes fantastic close-ups of
players' bewildered faces as obscene
ly difficult questions are asked.
"Play with Me,"
Dir. Nahid Samsami
Samsami has crafted a short golden
nugget of a movie that depicts varia
tions on the quintessential Stanford in
teraction — the one where you com
miserate with your
dormmate/lover/person lending you
use of a cigarette lighter about how
you both have 1 0-page papers to write
for Monday, and then you both vow to
get totally wasted at your frat of choice
on Saturday.

"la Musa,"
Directors: Cole Paulson, Jen
Aguilar and Teresa Ingram
Shot on location in Florence, Italy,
"La Musa" has a neato soundtrack of
Italian rap and an artsy sensibility that
befits the short film genre. Check it:
you watch footage of someone filming
a person taking pictures of unsuspect
ing Florentines. It's meta-voyeuristic.
"Model Man,"
Dir. Steven Tagle
"Model Man" is like Scopophilia's
big budget summer blockbuster, with
an elaborate production, requisite
special effects, intricate storyline and
a nicely packaged moral — being that
robots are shitty lovers. Intermission
writer Barrett Sheridan moonlights as
the model man himself, and his per
formance is perfectly robotic and
creepy.

"lesbians/'
Dir. Sarah Garmisa
This short film is, quite literally,
about phone sex. The camera is
trained on two cell phones, held by
tattooed female hands, and we watch
as the phones are made to kind of rub
up and down each other and make
shrieky feedback nosies. It makes you
feel almost dirtier than "The L Word/'
"llama Mamas,"
Dir. Keenan Newman
Awww! Llamas are so cute! This fun,
well-made documentary embodies the
meditative, yet quirky quality that lla
mas imbue in the lives of the two
women who call themselves the Llama
Mamas and run the Rainbow Ridge
Llama Ranch in Petaluma, CA. Tne
film perfunctorily covers that most in
famous llama quirk: spitting.
Also appearing: "You Have My
Eyebrows," Dir. Cole Paulson ana

(Rachel Torres: It's that time of year again. Not
just for your yearly woman's exam (Josh, take
note), but also for the Stanford Student Film Festi
val.
Joshua Smith: That's gross, dude. Moving 0n...
this year's theme is "Scopophilia " which the Stan
ford Film Society (SFS) kids claim means "the love
or pleasure of looking," but Rachel and I know that
it refers instead to people who take joy out of play
ing with their navels.
RT: Ha! Navel is a funny word.
JS: Rachel, you're dumb.
RTi Not as dumb as 1 look.
JS; Uh...
Anyway,Lin my infinite wisdom, know that
you attended last night s kickoff for the festival and
viewed the slew of cinematic masterpieces.
JS: Hell yeah! I loved "Crowbar Dreams." That
| was some scary S-word.
RTi Right. 50... The festival continues tonight
and tomorrow in Cubberley at 7:30 pm each night.
JS: Here are previews of the remaining films that
we had'the pleasure of screening. Apologies to
those who made films that were unavailable at
press time. We can't wait to see your chef d'oeuvres.

hours engaged in furious debate
