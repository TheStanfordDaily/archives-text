# Stanford fares well in faculty diversity, not so much for student body
## DIVERSIFYING THE LAW SCHOOL 
### NIRAJ SHETH 
A recent survey conducted by The Journal
of Blacks in Higher Education (JBHE) found
little to no progress during the past seven
years in the enrollment of black students, nor
in retaining black faculty at the nation's top
law schools. While Stanford l.aw School fares
better than average in terms of faculty diver
sity. its black student enrollment rate is not as
impressive.
Stanford Law earned high marks for its ex
ceptionally diverse faculty. According to the
American Bar Association, the Law School
has a total of seven minority faculty members.
Black professors make up more than 9 per
cent of the faculty, putting Stanford well
ahead of its peer institutions.
According to Larry Kramer, dean of the
Law School, this is not by chance.Hie Univer
sity, he said, has made a conscious effort to
employ a diverse law faculty.
"We believe that it is very important to
have a faculty body that is diverse in all the
ways important in American society — which
means racial and ethnic diversity, but also
gender and intellectual approaches as well,"
Kramer said. "Our efforts to recruit have
been focused on finding candidates and con
vincing them that Stanford is the right place
for them to be."
More important than numbers is the ac
cessibility of professors to students, according
to Fred Smith, a second-year law student and
president of the Black Law Student Associa

tion.To this extent, the University is support
ive, he said.
"For the most part, the needs of black stu
dents are the same as most students on cam
pus," Smith said.
He commended the Law School for its in
timate learning atmosphere, its small size and
the ease of interactions with professors —
qualities that are important to all students.
Other leaders of minority student groups
have praised the University for fostering a
healthy learning environment. Smith men
tioned the dean's expressed interest last year
in funding a black student retreat.
Alice Yuan, president of the Asian and Pa
cific Islander Law Students Association,
agreed with the University's proactive atti
tude.
"The Law School does a good job of keep
ing minority student groups involved with
student recruiting, faculty-hiring input and
Law School activities," she said.
The high proportion of minority law pro
fessors is a critical part of the University's
push for a comfortable environment for mi
nority students. For example, two different
black law professors have hosted events at
their homes in recent years, Smith said. Such
efforts by the faculty help build a sense of
community and academic camaraderie with
students.
However, Smith also noted the impor
tance of keeping perspective when looking at
the faculty proportion. The small size of the
Law School means that, despite a high pro-

portion, the actual number of black faculty is
still very low. Yuan added, "One major
thing that Stanford Law School can do is hire
more minority full-time professors."
Another point of improvement lies in the
number of black students. According to the
American Bar Association, blacks make up
7.8 percent of Stanford law students. Unlike
its faculty statistics, this number simply paral
lels the average. According to the JBHE sur
vey, black students constitute 7.4 percent of
the nation's top 25 law schools.
Dean Kramer agreed that there is room
for progress.
"While the Law School is generally
proud of its record in maintaining a diverse
student body and faculty, there is always
more that can be done." Kramer said. "At a
school our size, the numbers are small
enough that it is important always to keep
an eye out and to continue making efforts
to find and recruit both students and facul
ty."
The University's efforts to reach out to the
African American community should not be
discounted. Faye Deal, associate dean of ad
mission and financial aid at the Law School,
explained that her office makes special efforts
to bring in black students.
"We've used alumni and current students
to make contact with these [ African-Ameri
can] applicants." said Deal. "We also will fly
out the admitted students for our annual

School has actively reached out to diversify its student body, its numbers remain roughly the same.
Admit Weekend in order for them to get a
first-hand look at the school, our programs,
our faculty and our students."
Smith confirmed these efforts, explaining
that he is one among other minority students
who have represented Stanford at law school
career fairs in historically minority regions of
the country. All expenses were paid by the
University.
According to Smith, the impetus for
change may actually lie, at least partly, in the
hands of the black community itself.
"This process [of encouraging black stu
dents to pursue the legal profession] does

not just belong to admissions officers and
deans," he said. "That process belongs to all
of us."
Smith cited the achievement gap that ex
ists well before professional school as a symp
tom of a larger problem — a problem that
may have roots in different experiences
caused by class and socioeconomic condi
tions. Smith also said that the black commu
nity should consider how it can encourage in
tellectual curiosity and career consideration
among black youth.
In the end, however, increasing black en
rollment at law schools would go a long way
to solving these problems.
"If we come to have a school where the
percentage of blacks represents more accu
rately the proportion of blacks in society, it
would boost the morale of prospective black
law students," Smith said.
