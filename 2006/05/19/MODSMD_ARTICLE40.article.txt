"The Break-up" (June 2) Starring Vince Vaughn
and Jennifer Aniston
I like to call this movie "Mr. and Mis. Smith 2." Why?
Think about it. Vince Vaughn co-starred with Brad Pitt
while lie was married to Jennifer Anistcn and scoping
out Angelina Jolie. Now that Brad and Angelina have
merged into Brangelina, Aniston has moved on to
Vaughn, a man who looks like he hasn't slept in a week.
The only logical conclusion of this movie is that Vaughn
and Aniston will combine into Vinciffer and gossip rags
will implode in a cross-contamination of famous peo
ple. Anyway, it looks funny. Go see it.

"Cars" (June 9) Starring Owen Wilson, George Carlin, Bonnie Hunt. Cheech Marin, Paul
Newman, John Ratzenberger and Larry the Cable Guy

up its tradition of clever writing and amazing visuals! Hopefully
people will look past the Chevron commercial look of he
main characters. I still think Pixar might continue

Yargh. Captain Jack Sparrow's (Johnny Depp) quasi-drunken routine re
turns in the sequel to the 2003 über-hit based on the Disneyland ride. Nor
mally,! would say that this was just another money-grabbing sequel, destined
for mediocrity, but a film about pirates, especially ambiguously homosexual
