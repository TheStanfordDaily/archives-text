### DEBORAH SOHN 
In April 2005, Stanford's annual "Challenge for
Charity" event ended in tragedy when 34-year-old
participant Michael Johnson, a graduate student at
the Merage School of Business at UC-Irvine,
drowned during a water polo match. One year later,
Johnson's mother is suing Stanford for contributing
to the death.
The event, hosted by the Stanford Graduate
School of Business (GSB), is a competition be
tween the top west coast business schools, and was
intended to be the culmination of a year-long
fundraising effort before it took its fatal turn.
Johnson was "involved in an inner-tube water
polo game at Avery, and in the process of it, he
drowned in the pool," explained Patrick Dunkley of
the University's General Counsel Office.
Michelle Musura, Johnson's mother.has accused
the University for attributing to her son's death
through negligence. According to The San Jose
Mercury-News, Musura contends that the Universi
ty and staff of Avery Aquatic Center failed in their
responsibility to properly supervise, plan or control
the event. She also alleges that they were "negligent
and careless" in providing the correct equipment
for the event.
Dunkley said that they were not sure why
Musura had waited a whole year to sue the Univer
sity, but he explained that the law does allow for a
certain time window during which a lawsuit can be
filed.
In response to the accusations. Dunkley said,
"The University does not believe that it is responsi
ble and will defend accordingly." However, he
added that there was not much information avail
able at this point in the legal proceedings. He also
explained that cases like this generally take one to
two years to even get to the trial stage.
This year's "Challenge for Charity" took place
again in April without any problems.
