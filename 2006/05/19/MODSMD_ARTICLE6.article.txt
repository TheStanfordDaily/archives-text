Students looking to take advantage of Tresidder
Memorial Union's first floor area — a valuable col
lective study and meeting space for students looking
for a central campus location — have faced incon
sistency in the building's closure time.Tresidder has
recently closed earlier than its original 2 a.m. time —
a source of tension and confusion for students and
staff as the final round of midterms approaches.
Now, only the second floor lobby remains open
until 2 a.m. on weekdays and 3 a.m. on weekends.
Meanwhile, students have been experiencing incon
sistent closing hours on the first floor.
"The lower part of TVesidder closes at a different
time than the upstairs due to security, access and
safety issues surrounding a large seating and func

supervision," said Karen Andrews, associate direc

"Although our last operation closes at 8 p.m., man
agers stay and additional two hours before they
begin to close down. Due to the large size of the fa

equipment inventory, it is required to provide super
vision in case of any emergencies."
