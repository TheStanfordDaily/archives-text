Students looking to take advantage of Tresidder
Memorial Union's first floor area — a valuable col
lective study and meeting space for students looking
for a central campus location — have faced incon
sistency in the building's closure time.Tresidder has
recently closed earlier than its original 2 a.m. time —
a source of tension and confusion for students and
staff as the final round of midterms approaches.
Now, only the second floor lobby remains open
until 2 a.m. on weekdays and 3 a.m. on weekends.
Meanwhile, students have been experiencing incon
sistent closing hours on the first floor.
"The lower part of TVesidder closes at a different
time than the upstairs due to security, access and
safety issues surrounding a large seating and func
tion area that currently is not covered through direct
supervision," said Karen Andrews, associate direc
tor of retail and concessions for Stanford Dining.
"Although our last operation closes at 8 p.m., man
agers stay and additional two hours before they
begin to close down. Due to the large size of the fa
cility, multiple entrances and exits, product and
equipment inventory, it is required to provide super
vision in case of any emergencies."
Jeanette Smith-Laws, director of TYesidder meet-
ing services, said that the remodeling of the
downstairs space two years ago has created
security concerns.
"It is really because the design of the
space," she said. "Before we redesigned the
space, there used to be a gate that closed off
the food services. Students had said it would
be nicer to have it more open — in opening
that space we created some other prob
lems."
Smith-Laws said she has been working
with the downstairs managers in the hope of
keeping the space open until later at night.
"I'm trying to work with the downstairs
space because the intent was to have the
downstairs space until 2 a.m.," she said.
"The problem is some of the services close
a little earlier. One of the issues and prob
lems they were having is when the food
services shut down, there's no way to se
cure the food areas. 5-SURE runs on the
second floor — perhaps we can have a stu
dent that sits down in the space to monitor
the space."
ITie apparent compromise was locking
all the doors leading into the facility at 8
p.m. when the eateries close,but not kicking
out people inside until 10 p.m.
Students have expressed dissatisfaction
with the early closing of the downstairs
space. Senior Stephanie Mika said she has
been asked to leave the downstairs meeting
space at Tresidder.
"I was meeting with my group for a
group project at Tresidder at 9 p.m.," she

said. "We tried to meet downstairs in the
eating area by Subway and 1 managed to get
inside when another group of students
opened the doors for me — the doors were
already locked. At some point a guy with a
mop came by and told us that the down
stairs was closed, asking us to leave."
Junior Lizzie Suiter, who shared the ex
perience, felt that Tresidder's policy of lock
ing the doors while lettings students work
inside had no substantial effect and left
many frustrated.
"They just started locking the doors,"she
said. "A bunch of people were still working
around me as well, but no one could get in.
Subsequently, people from outside would
see us working and would try to get in.
Upon reaching the locked doors, they
would knock, and every five or so minutes, I
would have to get up and let them in. So
locking the doors was kinda worthless."
Suiter said she and her group had to
move to the lounge area on the second
floor, where there was not enough space.
"We went to the upstairs of Tresidder,"
she said. "There were, honestly, seven other
groups who had been displaced from down
stairs Tresidder. Groups were sitting in cor
ners, next to plants. People were hoarding
plug outlets for their computers. If a group
who had chairs and a table would make any
motion to leave, groups tired from sitting
uncomfortably on the floor would frantical
ly fight to take over the area."
Senior Eric Mayefsky has experienced
the changes in Tresidder hours throughout
his four years, as his bridge club has regular
ly met there.
"Before the remodeling about two years
ago, we'd play bridge until about 2 a.m.
They'd kick us out then. Now, they try to

passively or actively kick us out earlier. The
bridge club met weekly there. Tresidder is a
central location that's open late, and you
don't need a key to get into it. It's ideal."
Mayefsky said that his club still meets in
Tresidder, but with much difficulty.
"Last year they were big on just kicking
us out at 10 p.m., and now they lock the
doors at 8 p.m," he said. "You can still open
the doors from the inside. Recently, at 8 p.m.
they turned off the lights and then turned
them back on and made some comment
about us needing to leave. But she didn't
push it so we just stayed. We manage, but it's
a pain. We still play there."
In an interview with The Daily, Smith-
Laws expressed surprise at these com
plaints.
"That's really surprising to me," she said.
"I would like to hear about those things. We
want the building hours to be consistent. We
want them to be open. We want to provide
what we've committed to do, which is being
open until 2 a.m."
Smith-Laws added that students should
come to her if they have complaints.
"It is really important to get feedback
from students," she said."Maybe we need to
build a better mechanism so the students
know if they have complaints or issues, who
do they go to. The answer to that is me. We
should get that out to people."
Andrews said she hopes students will
work out a solution that complies with
Tresidder's needs.
"i will be in touch with Tresidder man
agement in finding a common resolution to
this issue," she said. "I would like to work
with the students and other stakeholders so
we can best understand how to meet the
needs of everyone."

sistent closing hours on the first floor.
"The lower part of TVesidder closes at a different
time than the upstairs due to security, access and
safety issues surrounding a large seating and func
tion area that currently is not covered through direct
supervision," said Karen Andrews, associate direc
tor of retail and concessions for Stanford Dining.
"Although our last operation closes at 8 p.m., man
agers stay and additional two hours before they
begin to close down. Due to the large size of the fa
cility, multiple entrances and exits, product and
equipment inventory, it is required to provide super
vision in case of any emergencies."
Jeanette Smith-Laws, director of TYesidder meet-
ing services, said that the remodeling of the
downstairs space two years ago has created
security concerns.
"It is really because the design of the
space," she said. "Before we redesigned the
space, there used to be a gate that closed off
the food services. Students had said it would
be nicer to have it more open — in opening
that space we created some other prob
lems."
Smith-Laws said she has been working
with the downstairs managers in the hope of
keeping the space open until later at night.
"I'm trying to work with the downstairs
space because the intent was to have the
downstairs space until 2 a.m.," she said.
"The problem is some of the services close
a little earlier. One of the issues and prob
lems they were having is when the food
services shut down, there's no way to se
cure the food areas. 5-SURE runs on the
second floor — perhaps we can have a stu
dent that sits down in the space to monitor
the space."
ITie apparent compromise was locking
all the doors leading into the facility at 8
p.m. when the eateries close,but not kicking
out people inside until 10 p.m.
Students have expressed dissatisfaction
with the early closing of the downstairs
space. Senior Stephanie Mika said she has
been asked to leave the downstairs meeting
space at Tresidder.
"I was meeting with my group for a
group project at Tresidder at 9 p.m.," she

said. "We tried to meet downstairs in the
eating area by Subway and 1 managed to get
inside when another group of students
opened the doors for me — the doors were
already locked. At some point a guy with a
mop came by and told us that the down
stairs was closed, asking us to leave."
Junior Lizzie Suiter, who shared the ex
perience, felt that Tresidder's policy of lock
ing the doors while lettings students work
inside had no substantial effect and left
many frustrated.
"They just started locking the doors,"she
said. "A bunch of people were still working
around me as well, but no one could get in.
Subsequently, people from outside would
see us working and would try to get in.
Upon reaching the locked doors, they
would knock, and every five or so minutes, I
would have to get up and let them in. So
locking the doors was kinda worthless."
Suiter said she and her group had to
move to the lounge area on the second
floor, where there was not enough space.
"We went to the upstairs of Tresidder,"
she said. "There were, honestly, seven other
groups who had been displaced from down
stairs Tresidder. Groups were sitting in cor
ners, next to plants. People were hoarding
plug outlets for their computers. If a group
who had chairs and a table would make any
motion to leave, groups tired from sitting
uncomfortably on the floor would frantical
ly fight to take over the area."
Senior Eric Mayefsky has experienced
the changes in Tresidder hours throughout
his four years, as his bridge club has regular
ly met there.
"Before the remodeling about two years
ago, we'd play bridge until about 2 a.m.
They'd kick us out then. Now, they try to

passively or actively kick us out earlier. The
bridge club met weekly there. Tresidder is a
central location that's open late, and you
don't need a key to get into it. It's ideal."
Mayefsky said that his club still meets in
Tresidder, but with much difficulty.
"Last year they were big on just kicking
us out at 10 p.m., and now they lock the
doors at 8 p.m," he said. "You can still open
the doors from the inside. Recently, at 8 p.m.
they turned off the lights and then turned
them back on and made some comment
about us needing to leave. But she didn't
push it so we just stayed. We manage, but it's
a pain. We still play there."
In an interview with The Daily, Smith-
Laws expressed surprise at these com
plaints.
"That's really surprising to me," she said.
"I would like to hear about those things. We
want the building hours to be consistent. We
want them to be open. We want to provide
what we've committed to do, which is being
open until 2 a.m."
Smith-Laws added that students should
come to her if they have complaints.
"It is really important to get feedback
from students," she said."Maybe we need to
build a better mechanism so the students
know if they have complaints or issues, who
do they go to. The answer to that is me. We
should get that out to people."
Andrews said she hopes students will
work out a solution that complies with
Tresidder's needs.
"i will be in touch with Tresidder man
agement in finding a common resolution to
this issue," she said. "I would like to work
with the students and other stakeholders so
we can best understand how to meet the
needs of everyone."
