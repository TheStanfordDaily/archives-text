## Get your Row on 
### JOHN CHOCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Summer is breathing down Stanford's neck, and
there has never been a better time to venture
south ofTresidder— to the 36 residences that
sprawl along the campus border and sun
drenched shores of Lagunita.
But after dark, when warm breezes strip
April's petals from Mayfield Avenue, a num
tL ber of Row houses make the trip even more
worth your while — especially in the com
ing weekends, as houses like La Maison
Francaise, Bob and 680 Lomita gear up to
top off the social calendar.
"1 think it is a duty of Row houses to throw parties
for campus as an
alternative to frat parties," says Bob Social Manager
Shirin Sharif, a senior. "House parties are less exclu
sive and usually more fun. You usually get a more di
verse crowd."
Last weekend the corner of Constanzo and Santa
Ynez Streets sounded more French than anything,
when La Maison Francaise opened its doors for the
year's final Cafe Night. The famous fete combined live
jazz with soft conversation, dancing, crepes and wine.
"People lay on the ground, relax on the couches
and just listen to some good jazz," Social Manager
Priya Jhingan says of the Cafe Night ambiance. "Or if
you're brave, you can pave your way to the dining hall,
where DJ Jamberto dominates...helping to pump up
the crowd, many of whom inevitably end up dancing
on the tables by midnight."
Midnight is also when the French House will pop
open champagne to celebrate the end of the year.lTie
French hospitality extends to all University students,
Francophile, hedonist or otherwise.
"It's one of the few parties at which it really does
n't matter where you stand on the Stanford spec
trum," Jhingan says.
Other Row parties prove more Greek than French.
"Our parties are a lot like frat parties," says 680
Lomita Social Manager Colleen Ferrand-Andrew, a
senior, whose house will host the annual Exotic Erot

ic on May 19.The party's dress code specifies one item
of clothing for men, two for women.
"Hosting all-campus parties is definitely a feature
of the Row," Ferrand-Andrew says."It is one of the
reasons it's a great place to live."
A small number of Row houses opt for more inti
mate affairs. Houses only 34 students.7l7 Dolores
hosts small dinners, Friday cocktails and wine and
cheese dessert nights for residents and their guests.
"At 717 we have a tradition of having very lavish
special dinners," Social Manager Krysta kiyosaki
says. "We rent china, silverware and tablecloths."
717 Dolores and other Upper Row houses rely on
the rest of campus for nightlife.and there's reason for it.
"We go out and have fun, and then we come back
home," Kiyosaki said.
There's a compelling reason for row house resi
dents to abstain from party-throwing.
"There is very little that my residents actually get out
of a party,"Sharif says. "They pay for it, work at it.and do
clean up and set up. And the house gets overrun with
drunk people who are often disrespectful and rude."
For students from the center of campus, the fun can
go the other way.
"After Beltane, our house's spring all-campus
party, a sophomore living in Suites left an anonymous
note on our white board telling us how much better
our party had been than others at Stanford," Synergy
Social Manager Jon Sanders, a senior, says.
Sanders credits a laid-back social atmosphere and
the opportunity for conversation to be key elements
of many Row house parties. At Synergy, a co-op on a
citrus-studded hilltop, the character of the house also
contributes to the experience.
"At Beltane, we had four kinds of tasty home
brewed beer, a homemade honey wine, five bands, an
open mike, a drum circle and bonfire, a maypole and a
naked beet fight," Sanders said.
"People partied from 2 p.m. to sunrise." he added.
"By noon the next day, everyone had pitched in to
clean and the house was beautiful. What's not to like?"
