# Olivia Puerta's Best Bites

Embodying all that you'd ever
expect from a coffee shop,
Ann's is a piece of classic
Americana. The eatery serves a
soup of the day, roast beef and
hash, roast turkey sandwiches,
meatloaf, Chinese chop and Cobb
salads, milkshakes, omelets and,
yes, a wide array of specialty pies. A
rectangle of counter seating makes
up the middle of the restaurant,
complete with circular swivel
stools. Booths line the walls. The
browns and harvest gold of the wall
decor are pure 19705. Regulars
shoot the breeze over their papers
and coffee and friendly, engaging
staffers make newcomers feel right
at home. If you don't already get
the picture, perhaps it will help to
know your choice of sides: green
salad, Jell-O, potato salad, coleslaw
or potato chips. Eating at Ann's al
most makes you feel as if you've
traveled back to a more simple
time â€” it's definitely a fun place.
I ordered a tuna fish sandwich
($6.25) and chose the green salad as
my side. The tuna was prepared
with chopped celery and can be
served on toasted bread at your re
quest. Iceberg lettuce came on the

sandwich with a tomato slice and
sweet pickles. The small side salad
(with iceberg lettuce too. of course)
was fresh and had a dressing that
might have been homemade. My
strawberry milkshake ($4.25) was a
little pricey but creamy and deli
cious. I didn't get the opportunity
to try a slice of pie ($2.95), but the
rows lining three shelves at the
back of the restaurant hinted that
Ann's pie might be a signature item
worth a try.
If you're looking to get the
homey feeling of eating in a restau
rant as American as apple pie, or if
you're just looking to eat a piece of
apple pie, Ann's probably won't
disappoint. A favorite community
institution, Ann's is the perfect Sat
urday breakfast or lunch destina
tion for fans of good old-fashioned
American fare.
