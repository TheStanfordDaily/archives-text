Iraq: Where Do We So From Here?
A University-Wide Town Hall Meeting
Wednesday, May 24
4:30 - 6:00 pm
Kresge Auditorium
FREE
Concerned about the situation in Iraq? Wondering where we are
now, where we're headed, and how we move forward? After three
years of war in Iraq - and with no end in sight - it's time to think
together about these difficult questions, and how the Stanford
community might marshal its resources, beyond partisan
differences, to help policy-makers envision and enact a just and
lasting peace in Iraq.
Come listen to and participate in this invaluable and challenging dialogue.
