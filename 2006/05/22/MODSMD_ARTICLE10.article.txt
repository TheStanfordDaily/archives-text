# Get ready to HURL
## Students hope to bring Gaelic field sport to the Farm

On lazy spring days, white Frisbees sail above the Oval's lush grass and
bright flowers. From the Quad, their movement looks slow and graceful
compared to the cars whizzing along Palm Drive. But lately, some
speedier objects called sliotars have forced Frisbees to share the Oval's air-

space,
Sliotars are leather balls that players hit with sticks in hurling games.
Hurling is a men's grass sport that developed in Ireland about 2,000 years
ago, according to the Gaelic Athletic Association, or G AA. Camogie is the
women's version of hurling, in which less physical contact is permitted.
After seeing hurling matches at various Irish festivals in Chicago
and visiting a GAA booth at San Francisco's 2006 St. Patrick's Day
Parade, sophomore John Mulrow decided he wanted to start a hurl-

ing club at Stanford.
"I really see a hurling team as something that could take off
and be another unique thing on campus," Mulrow says. "Students
who may be athletic but without a specific way to pursue that
athleticism could get involved."

While Mulrow says that some people confuse hurling with
curling — the ice game played with a granite stone — many
who have seen hurling matches describe the sport as aerial
field hockey. Like field hockey sticks, hurling sticks (also
called hurls) curve into broad, flat ends. But hurling
sticks' ends are slightly larger and wider than the ends of
field hockey sticks.

"This allows players to control the ball in the air,"
says Eamonn Gormley, public relations officer for
the GA A's San Francisco branch and North Amer
ican Board.

That's not the only difference between the two
sports. Players can catch a hurling ball in their
hands and then take three steps with it before
doing something else.

"If he wants to keep running, he has to
balance the ball on the end of the stick, and

while it's in his possession he can only han
dle the ball twice," Gormley explains.

"These rules force the player to treat the
ball like a hot potato, and it keeps the
game moving at a hectic pace."

Indeed, hurling's fast pace rivals
that of ice hockey. It also allows
more rough contact than field

hockey does, and combines
skills from baseball and
lacrosse, according to
Gormley.

"The game is played on a field larger than a soc
cer field, with goalposts that look like rugby posts,
only with a net on the bottom section like in soc
cer," Ciormley says.

Players on two teams of 15 — or 13 in North
America — can score points in two ways.They can ei
ther fire the ball through the crossbar above the goal
for one point or into the goal's net for three points.
Gormley says that hurling is not very widespread
among America's non-Irish, so in order to "keep the
games alive and growing," the GAA is trying to spread
hurling beyond the Irish community.
Gormley is now helping Mulrow and a few other Stan
ford students bring hurling to the Farm. Both say they
hope that other universities in California will form hurl
ing club teams and organize intercollegiate matches.
"I'll be helping the guys at Stanford to hopefully get a
team off the ground by providing the initial coaching that
they need to learn the game," Gormley says. "'lTie GAA
in San Francisco is keen to expand to college campuses
where we think there is massive potential for growth. We
ultimately want to see teams at Stanford, Berkeley and
UCSF that can play against each other."
Mulrow has organized a few Saturday hurling clinics
on the Oval throughout May. The next session will be
May 27 from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Anyone is welcome, includ
ing women.
"The training sessions are just an opportunity to learn
about hurling and have practice with the sticks and balls,"
Mulrow says."Most people have absolutely no concept of
what hurling is, so this is a fun opportunity to find out.

People get really pumped to play more after they've had
just a little exposure to the game.so we're trying to spread
interest by providing these training sessions."
While only three people attended the session on May
13, Mulrow says he thinks he'll get more takers once the
word about hurling spreads. And those who did show up
say they're enthused about starting a club team.
"I had never played before [the clinics], but I had a
lot of fun when I came out, so I'll definitely come back,"
says sophomore Andy Zimbroff. "If a club got started
here at Stanford, I would definitely join up. It's a fun
sport and I'd love to play in a competitive or non-com
petitive setting."
Junior Dak Steiert also attended one of the clinics and
says he was initially interested in hurling because he
wanted to learn a new sport. An avid ski racer, Steiert has
also played baseball, lacrosse, rugby, golf and hockey.
"I lurling definitely makes an interesting combination
of many elements of the sports I've played before, and
aside from ski racing, it's up there with some of the more
challenging but rewarding sports I've played," he says.
"People get excited about it because it's something
they've never seen before, so it has a lot of draw. I'd defi
nitely like to play on a team if there was one at Stanford.
I mean, what's honestly more fun than running around
with a club and chasing a little leather ball?"
Mulrow says he plans to stop out of Stanford next year
to work in Zambia, so he's looking for someone else who
will continue to promote hurling on the Farm. Any takers?
