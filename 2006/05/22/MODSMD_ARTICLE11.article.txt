# Groups seek to remove taboo on self-lovin'
## 
### LINDSAY SCHAUER 
May is ripe with enjoyable holidays, from
May Day to Mother's Day, Cinco de Mayo to
Memorial Day. But many people don't know
that May is also National Masturbation
Month. Started in 1995 by San Francisco's fa
mous sex shop Good Vibrations, Masturba
tion Month aims to celebrate the joys and dis
pel the myths surrounding sexual self-love.
While many campus groups — including
Stanford Students for Choice, Queer Women
and the SHPRC — have hosted events sup
porting National Masturbation Month, its his
tory and purpose are not widely understood
on campus and its success questioned by
many at Stanford.
Masturbation Month's goal is primarily to
promote comprehensive sex education and
dialogue about sex. Good Vibrations created
the holiday in 1995 when former US. Presi
dent Bill Clinton fired then-Surgeon General
Dr. Jocelyn Elders for suggesting that mastur
bation be included in national sex education.
"We started Masturbation Month to call
attention to the hypocrisy that surrounds this
so-common but still-taboo topic," says Good
Vibrations Staff Sexologist Carol Queen, who

emphasizes a need to acknowledge non-pro
creative forms of sex — such as masturbation
— as healthy and acceptable in our culture.
"Sex education in this country is, for the
most part,second-rate at best," she says. "That
masturbation is controversial or misunder
stood is just the tip of the iceberg."
President of Stanford Students for Choice
and a long-time supporter of Masturbation
Month's mission, senior Neela Penumarthy
echoes Good Vibrations' view of the holiday.
"Masturbation Month is about sex positiv
ity and encouraging dialogue about sexual
health," Penumarthy says."lf we are interest
ed in preventing unplanned pregnancies, low
ering STD rates and promoting positive sexu
ality, students need to be educated about how
to engage in healthy sex — of which mastur
bation is a part."
As an attempt to encourage dialogue about
sex and masturbation on campus during May,
Stanford Students for Choice hosted their an
nual Masturbation Celebration at Columbae
this month, featuring various performers and
entertainment. Flyers clarifying myths about
masturbation and boasting hard facts about
the benefits of self-love, such as "it's safe, it
lowers stress levels and it can boost confi

dence," circulated among the participants.
The celebration's message was not as
widespread as Good Vibrations might have
hoped, however, as many of the few dozen
students who attended didn't realize the pur
pose of the event.
Senior Harris Fienburg, who currently
lives in Columbae, says he questions the cele
bration of Masturbation Month.
"I don't think there's really a need to cele
brate something like masturbation," he says.
"It's like having a celebration for breathing."
Other students said they didn't feel com
fortable attending an event about masturba
tion. Junior Rahul Kanakia heard of the
event through a Stanford email list but decid
ed not to go.
"I don't feel comfortable celebrating mas
turbation," he says."I think its importance is
something people learn on their own."
This private nature of masturbation in our
society may be what makes public acknowl
edgment, whether in high school sex educa
tion programs or here at Stanford, difficult or
misunderstood.
"It is still taboo to publicly acknowledge
something as private as masturbation," says
History Prof. Estelle Freedman, who teaches

The History of Sexuality in the U.S. at Stanford
and who first heard of National Masturbation
Month this year. "It is very unfortunate that in
our culture we don't have quality, comprehen
sive sex education for all that includes both re
productive and non-reproductive sexual acts."
Freednian says she does see potential in
opening dialogue about safe, non-reproduc
tive sex through public events like National
Masturbation Month, but thinks something
titled "Sexual Health Month" would go a lot
farther in promoting the comprehensive sex
education that she and Good Vibrations
would like to see in our culture.
Assistant Dean of Students at the
Women's Community Center Linda Harrison
says she agrees.
"'Sexual Freedom Month' may be an easi
er concept for people to embrace," she says.
"Even' Masturbation Rights Month' or some
thing of the like with an explanation of the
historical context concerning Jocelyn Elders
might make more sense."
On campus, the SHPRC supports mastur
bation education all year by offering informa
tion about using sex toys and by selling lubri
cants made "for play," pointing out that they
are not only meant for sex with a partner. But

as sophomore and SHPRC student volunteer
George Xander-Morris points out, dialogue
about masturbation remains rare.
"Most Stanford kids are really taboo about
masturbation — only the most confident ones
talk about it and I don't even think everyone
who works at the SHPRC would feel comfort
able discussing it."says Xander-Morris, who
was familiar with the Elders controversy but
not with the concept of Masturbation Month.
"People think masturbation is something to be
kept to themselves, but there are really so many
good things about it — so many health benefits
people should know about and discuss."
Masturbation Month continues in these
last two weeks of May, with more events to
celebrate self-love and to encourage educa
tion. On May 26, Stanford will host a film
screening and discussion with Shelby Knox,
whose fight to bring comprehensive sex edu
cation to her Texas high school has been made
into an award-winning film, titled "The Edu
cation of Shelby Knox." Good Vibrations will
host a Masturbate-a-thon fundraiser on May
27 in San Francisco.

History Prof. Estelle Freedman, who teaches

The History of Sexuality in the U.S. at Stanford
and who first heard of National Masturbation
Month this year. "It is very unfortunate that in
our culture we don't have quality, comprehen
sive sex education for all that includes both re
productive and non-reproductive sexual acts."
Freednian says she does see potential in
opening dialogue about safe, non-reproduc
tive sex through public events like National
Masturbation Month, but thinks something
titled "Sexual Health Month" would go a lot
farther in promoting the comprehensive sex
education that she and Good Vibrations
would like to see in our culture.
Assistant Dean of Students at the
Women's Community Center Linda Harrison
says she agrees.
"'Sexual Freedom Month' may be an easi
er concept for people to embrace," she says.
"Even' Masturbation Rights Month' or some
thing of the like with an explanation of the
historical context concerning Jocelyn Elders
might make more sense."
On campus, the SHPRC supports mastur
bation education all year by offering informa
tion about using sex toys and by selling lubri
cants made "for play," pointing out that they
are not only meant for sex with a partner. But

as sophomore and SHPRC student volunteer
George Xander-Morris points out, dialogue
about masturbation remains rare.
"Most Stanford kids are really taboo about
masturbation — only the most confident ones
talk about it and I don't even think everyone
who works at the SHPRC would feel comfort
able discussing it."says Xander-Morris, who
was familiar with the Elders controversy but
not with the concept of Masturbation Month.
"People think masturbation is something to be
kept to themselves, but there are really so many
good things about it — so many health benefits
people should know about and discuss."
Masturbation Month continues in these
last two weeks of May, with more events to
celebrate self-love and to encourage educa
tion. On May 26, Stanford will host a film
screening and discussion with Shelby Knox,
whose fight to bring comprehensive sex edu
cation to her Texas high school has been made
into an award-winning film, titled "The Edu
cation of Shelby Knox." Good Vibrations will
host a Masturbate-a-thon fundraiser on May
27 in San Francisco.
