## Editorial Robberies should up student awareness 
### 
The two armed robberies on campus
have jolted Stanford students out of the
Bubble. Because we are not located in
a dangerous neighborhood like some of our
peer institutions, we have come to take our
safety for granted. But even though the Stan
ford campus is generally known for its safety,
the recent robberies emphasize the need for
vigilance.
The University has already taken action;
President John Hennessy has even sent out
an email addressing the issue. But given the
gravity of the situation, Hennessy's advice
bears repeating. Walk in groups and avoid
poorly lit areas. If you have to walk alone, be
alert and avoid activities that might distract
you. Make use of campus resources like 5-
SURE and the Emergency Telephone Tow
ers, or "blue lights."
We applaud the Department of Public
Safety for their efforts to raise awareness
among the student community. We are also
heartened by the fact that students have not
become panicked or hysterical over the
crimes. Sure, there is a healthy amount of fear
among the student population, but it has not
become paralyzing.
If anything, these incidents have reminded
us that we need to be alert as a community.
Now more than ever, we should not be prop
ping doors. We should question strangers loi
tering around our dorms. We should not hesi
tate to report suspicious people to the police.
And we should consider volunteering for
shifts with 5-SURE.
But at this point, we must consider what
sort of policies should be implemented to en
sure campus safety in the long term. We don't
necessarily want greater surveillance, and we
certainly don't want more restrictions. And
while we would appreciate a slightly more vis
ible police presence at night, we don't need a
fence surrounding campus, nor do we need
security checkpoints manned by armed per
sonnel. If there's anything we appreciate
about Stanford, it's the fact that we are able to
wander freely around campus at 3 a.m. But

we should remember that Stanford is not a
Bubble in this respect, and that we take risks
whenever we walk alone outside in the mid
dle of the night.
Nevertheless, the University needs to
take steps to implement measures to in
crease campus safety. By putting land lines in
every room, the administration has revived
the use of the Door King system — even
though many students circumvent the sys
tem by propping doors open. But the Uni
versity needs to do more to address campus
safety issues.
One area that demands immediate atten
tion is that of the "blue lights" scattered
around campus. Last year, the Board criti
cized the inadequacy of blue lights as a system
("Finding safety under blue lights," Feb. 18,
2(X)5). Some of the points they made over a
year ago are still valid. Blue lights are not as
evenly scattered across campus as they
should be, and there are plenty of dimly-lit
walkways that do not have blue lights within
reach. Also, it is often hard to spot the next
nearest tower from any given tower. Some
towers are obscured by trees, while others are
too far to be clearly visible amid streetlights.
Moreover, there tends to be skepticism
about whether these towers work at all. In
what situations should these blue lights be
used? Should we activate these buttons only
in cases of extreme danger or in any instance
when we feel unsafe? And should students re
ally be running from armed assailants in the
first place, hitting the buttons on these emer
gency towers as they go?
University administrators need to do
more to respond to questions and concerns
about the "blue lights." These recent rob
beries represent an opportunity to inform
and educate students about campus safety.
Greater commitment to campus safety is
needed in the form of increased funding for
infrastructure like blue towers and services
like 5-SURE. We hope that these incidents
will galvanize the University to take signifi
cant action.
