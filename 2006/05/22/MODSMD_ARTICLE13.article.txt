# The 						Roommate Speaks
## 
### 
Hi readers. This is Chris Holt's hung
over roommate. You may have seen
him refer to me in many of his
columns.This week, I thought I'd give Chris a
break, let him learn how to tie a tie and write
his column. Don't worry, I'll try to write in his
style so you're not confused. Actually, I'm
well acquainted with Chris' style, because for
every column you people read, I get to read
three and tell Chris which one is the best. In
stead of "reading" in the traditional sense, I
usually line the bottom of our hamster's cage
with all three, and I tell Chris to print
whichever one has the most poop after a day.
Let's see... Intro paragraph.This is usually
where Chris talks about a random current
event in today's world. He tries to give you
the bare facts so you can pretend you know
what he's talking about for the rest of the col
umn, even if you're clueless. I have no clue
where Chris digs up those sensationalized
human interest stories he calls "news," so let's
just stick with something simple: The recent
Law School Library Crisis. Yes. It's a Crisis.
The Stanford Law School recently decided to
not allow undergraduates in the Law library
during finals because it was too crowded and
law students didn't have enough space.
Good. All caught up?
In the next section, Chris usually takes a
stance on the issue from paragraph one, al
though you're not sure if he actually believes
what he's saying. Here I go: I think it's great
that the Law School has dealt with the lack of
space so efficiently and decisively. As a
whole, Stanford undergraduates are always
trying to go places and do things they should
n't. I'm really tired of all those sketchy under
grads going to grad parties and hitting on
older women. You would hope that eventual
ly they would learn, but every time they show
up and make everyone else uncomfortable.
Now, undergrads want to push their way into
the Law library. Really, it's just another ex
ample of undergrads crossing boundaries
they shouldn't.
Then, Chris gets even more radical with
his viewpoint: The only way we can keep un
dergrads in their proper place is by separat
ing and locking all students in corners of
campus that reflect their area of study. We
could lock humanities students in Green Li
brary, engineers in the Engineering Quad
and of course the Law students in the Law
School. I suppose I could statistically figure
out the percentage of the Stanford popula
tion that should be allowed to use each space,
but since I 'm not on Facebook,l have no clue
how I would do the research.
Now Chris starts saying things that just
don't make sense and that only he finds
funny: I advocate moving the Law School to
the middle of Lake Lag on a Viking funeral
pyre and setting it on fire. That way, no more

undergrads could steal the precious re
sources contained within. Alternatively, we
could airlift the rest of campus into the
foothills and convert half of the buildings
into barns for horses and cows. Freshmen
could arrive during orientation and awk
wardly walk in on Farmer Jon milking Bessie.
ATTENTION READER: Most people
send Chris an angry email after reading this
far into his column.They don't realize that he
was using some sort of literary device to get
his overall point across. If you write him an
email now, you will look stupid. Seriously.
I've seen some of the goofy stuff you guys
have written. Read to the end.
Now, the conclusion. This is where Chris
uses his radical views in the above para
graphs to get to his point. If you read this sec
tion, you may learn something: The Law
School Library Crisis can be boiled down to
Stanford students, undergrads and grads
alike, not respecting the needs of others.
Sure, the Law library is nice, but if law stu
dents need it for a couple of weeks out of the
year, everyone else should be courteous and
let them use it. Embrace your sense of com
munity. Go ahead. Give your neighbor a hug.
I'm going to go find something to get rid
of this splitting headache I've had all morn
ing. More bourbon should do the trick.

Chris probably cares what you thought of this
column. I don't. Send complaints to
cholt@stanford. edu.
