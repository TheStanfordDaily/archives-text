People are stupid and annoying. It's time
someone stepped up and started call
ing them out for all the idiotic things
they do on a regular basis. Being the burly,
hulk of a man that I am, I choose to rise to
the occasion.
These are things that get on my nerves. If
you're wondering why I didn't create the "Top
10 annoying things people do," it's because
Top 10 lists get on my nerves. I'm just going to
list stuff, more in the interest of rambling than
in ranking by annoyingness.
Talking
People never stop doing this! What is
wrong with you all? Seriously, shut up. I am
sick of listening to people talk: outside my
room when I am trying to sleep, about their
plans in which I am not involved, about some
thing they find intellectually stimulating,
about the Draw, about outfits, etc. Why do
people think that their stupid lives have more
significance if they spend their time yapping
instead of sitting silently? You don't always
need to say something.
Questions
This is for all the kids out there who man
age to ask the stupidest questions in lecture
and section, the questions that could have
been figured out by merely thinking for a
nanosecond before opening their mouth.
"I feel like"
A friend pointed this out. Notice how often
everyone says"I feel like" before they voice
any sort of opinion, make an argument or an
swer a question.This is even more wimpy than
saying "I think" or "In my opinion." "I feel
like" is equivalent to saying you don't even
know if this is what you think yet. If you are
starting a sentence like this, you should not be
speaking yet. In fact, you should not be al
lowed to speak. Ever.
Touching
Don't touch me. Seriously, whatever hap

pened to respect for personal space? You
know you've got that one friend who con
stantly pops your personal bubble. Whether
it's a playful tug at the shoulder, a friendly tou
sle of the hair or arm around the shoulder, you
have a burning desire to punch this person in
the face.
Causes
You can picket, you can protest, you can
scream, but you can't make me care. I'm
happy for you and your passion, really, but
stop acting indignant because I'm not as riled
up as you are. Isn't your bundle of self-right
eousness enough to keep you happy?
Caterpillars
Caterpillars are annoying on two levels.
First, they are fuzzy bastards with poisonous
guts. Second, they have spawned a bunch of
annoying Facebook groups that complain
about them. This brings me to the next item on
my list.
Facebook
0h... my... god. Facebook is a hub for an
noyingness. I need subsections:
Photos. Agh. What is with these people
who live to take pictures and add them to their
Facebook profiles? It does not make you a
better or a more interesting person to have
more photos than you will ever be able to sort
through.
Quotes. Stop quoting obscure things that
your friends said that have absolutely no
meaning to anyone else who views your pro
file. At most, you can have two of these; after

this it becomes abundantly clear that you are
just trying to prove to the world that your
friends are interesting and funny (which
they aren't).
Walls. Stop and realize that the wall serves
nothing besides the ego. Think, what do you
use walls for? To say stuff. Hmmm, that's what
the message function is for! So really, what
prompted the Facebook to make the wall?
Probably because they know that college kids
love to stroke their ego and pursue their own
self-importance by trying to rack up as many
wall comments as possible.
Events. Stop inviting me to events. Just
stop.
Relationships. Two things: Girls, unless you
are lesbians, stop saying you are in relation
ships with each other. It was edgy and interest
ing the first 1,000 times it was done. Actually, it
was stupid those times too. Second, all people
should stop saying they are in relationships.
Why the hell should Facebook know? And
what is it with the engagement option, is any
one really enough of a tool to bother listing
that on Facebook?
Status. This feature is inevitably stupid and
annoying. Used correctly, it is stupid because it
shows you are pathetic enough to update
Facebook every hour of the day. Used incor
rectly (e.g., Kelly is being awesome) it is an
noying because you think you are clever. But
you are not because this is how everyone uses
the feature.
Complaints
Worst of all are people who waste all their
time complaining about stuff. People whine,
mope and complain with their friends but
then lack the balls to ever take action. No one
ever tries to make a difference. If your
thoughts and ideas are so important that you
waste all your breath on them, maybe you
should actually act on them once in awhile.
TVy writing a column.

This list is not even close to done. To hear more
