The inequity between campus libraries
In his op-cd ("Limiting Crown Library use
is reasonable," May 17), J. Paul Lomio makes a
convincing argument for restricting use of the
Law Library to law students during exam pe
riods. However, his focus on the needs of law
students misses the boat and perpetuates a
general misunderstanding of the ongoing de
bate. The issue at hand is not about access to
the law library specifically, but about in
equities across libraries more generally.
fails to fully address the more perti
nent question, which is why so many under
graduates would choose the Law Library as

their preferred study space option. He touch
es upon these reasons tangentially, stating that
the "library's reading room is basked with glo
rious California sunshine; there are power
outlets everywhere; the room is filled with
comfortable Aeron chairs." He's right. The
reading room creates a wonderful space for
studying. The chairs are comfortable, natural
sunlight is available throughout most of the li
brary and the room temperature is well-at
tuned to student needs. It's perfectly reason
able to assume that students are most produc
tive in their studying under these conditions.
But other libraries like the primary under
graduate portals Green and Meyer, lack many

of these amenities. Green has literally hun
dreds of carrels, but the chairs are not terribly
comfortable and the temperature often be
comes unbearably cold. Meyer hardly has any
true study spaces to begin with, and the ones
that it has are noisy and poorly lit. It should
come as no surprise that staff from these li
braries never have to worry about too many
law students coming through their doors.
I can think of many reasons why some of
the undergraduate libraries may lack some of
the amenities of the Law Library. Perhaps
most salient are issues of funding. It may sim
ply be too costly for Green to supply Aeron
chairs to all of its carrels. Meyer may lack the

resources to provide more private study
spaces. But these hypothetical bring us hack
to the inequities issue. Do law students de
serve such a well-furnished library to them
selves when undergraduates make up a far
larger proportion of the Stanford student
body? Perhaps so, but only if the rest of the
student population also has unfettered access
to libraries of similar quality. The University
needs to examine its current investment in all
of the libraries and study spaces, especially
when the issue is so closely tied to the quality
of education students ultimately receive.
