### ANDREW LOMELI STAFF WRITER 
Their hacks against the wall, Stanford
softball needed two straight wins over No.
22 Fresno State to extend its season. And
the Card rose to the occasion with 3-0 and
9-3 victories over the Bulldogs yesterday to
advance to the NCAA Super Regionals
next week against host Alabama.
After falling to Fresno State on Friday
and defeatingTulsa and CSU-Fullerton on
Saturday, the Cardinal (42-16,10-11 Pac
-10) met Fresno State once again on Sun
day, needing a sweep to be named region
al champion.
In the second and deciding game yes
terday, sophomore second baseman Tricia
Aggabao notched a single in the top of the
sixth to begin the Cardinal's three-run in
ning.
Sophomore rightfielder Anna Beard

man nailed a sacrifice bunt to advance Ag
gabao, and senior centerfielder Catalina
Morris followed with an RBI single.
Then,junior leftfielder Jackie Rinehart
bunted Morris to third and both women
came in to score on a single from freshman
third baseman Maddy Coon.
Senior pitcher Laura Severson allowed
three hits while walking none in seven in
nings. Five Cardinal batters collected one
hit each, most of which came in the explo
sive sixth.
Though the postseason was on the line,
Stanford's mindset appeared to have been
calm and collected.
"We pretty much looked at it as a basic
doubleheader," Severson said. "We tried
to focus on ourselves and simply win two
games in a row, which we've done before
all year."
Severson attributed the 3-0 win to a
good team defense throughout the after
noon.
The Cardinal hammered Fresno State,
9-3, in the teams' first meeting of the day.
Fresno State's Christina Clark opened
the match with a solo homerun before
freshman pitcher Missy Penna struck out
two, leaving two Bulldogs stranded to

end the first.
Stanford responded to the blast with a
four-run bottom of the first, ignited by a
Morris double to open the side.The Cardi
nal added another three runs in the second
to secure the strong lead.
Coon notched three RBI and went 2-
for-3 in the game, as did Rinehart. Penna
collected seven strikeouts while allowing
nine hits.
Stanford edged Fullerton 4-1 on Satur
day evening.TWo sacrifice flies and a single
propelled the Cardinal to a three-run
fourth inning. Coon added an insurance
run with an RBI single in the seventh be
fore the Titans collected their only run in
the latter half of the inning.
Severson struck out four while allow
ing five hits and one walk. Coon went 3-
for-3 while Rinehart went 2-for-4 for the
afternoon.
Prior to the Fullerton contest, Fresno
State blanked Stanford, 3-0. Pitcher Rob
bin Mackin's two-run homer in the third
established a three-run Bulldog lead, and
the Cardinal could not respond.
Stanford threatened once in the sixth,
but no one could advance senior shortstop
Lauren Lappin past second. Sophomore

righthander Becky McCullough struck
out four while surrendering nine hits and
one walk.
