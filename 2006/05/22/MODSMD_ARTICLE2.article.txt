# WEEKEND
## Students had more opinions than clothes at Exotic Erotic Reaction mixed as boosted security keeps trouble as well as hordes of students in the cold 
### CHRISTIAN TOM STAFF WRITER 
Caution tape, body paint, Speedos, Frisbees
— these were only a handful of the outfits
donned by partygoers on Friday at 680 Lomi
ta's annual Exotic Erotic, Stanford's famed
semi-nude bash.
Exotic Erotic is historically one of the
biggest parties of the year, with the general rule
limiting attendees to two articles of clothing or
fewer.
"This was one of the top three parties," said
sophomore Irina lssakova. "If not the best
party of the year."
The house featured two rooms for dancing,
one with techno music and the other with rap,
an aspect lssakova found favorable.
"The party met my expectations," she said.
"It wasn't that sketchy, not any more naked or
erotic than any other party. It's just a fun party."
Freshman Stany Leßlanc also attended Ex
otic Erotic, sporting a Speedo.
"It was all right," Leßlanc said. "But it was
way too crowded. It was really not much more
special than a regular party. It was far more con
servative than I thought it would be; there were
no naked people or anything."
