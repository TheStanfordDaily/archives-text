# WEEKEND
## Students had more opinions than clothes at Exotic Erotic Reaction mixed as boosted security keeps trouble as well as hordes of students in the cold 
### CHRISTIAN TOM STAFF WRITER 
Caution tape, body paint, Speedos, Frisbees
— these were only a handful of the outfits
donned by partygoers on Friday at 680 Lomi
ta's annual Exotic Erotic, Stanford's famed
semi-nude bash.
Exotic Erotic is historically one of the
biggest parties of the year, with the general rule
limiting attendees to two articles of clothing or
fewer.
"This was one of the top three parties," said
sophomore Irina lssakova. "If not the best
party of the year."
The house featured two rooms for dancing,
one with techno music and the other with rap,
an aspect lssakova found favorable.
"The party met my expectations," she said.
"It wasn't that sketchy, not any more naked or
erotic than any other party. It's just a fun party."
Freshman Stany Leßlanc also attended Ex
otic Erotic, sporting a Speedo.
"It was all right," Leßlanc said. "But it was
way too crowded. It was really not much more
special than a regular party. It was far more con
servative than I thought it would be; there were
no naked people or anything."

A student gets turned away at the door of 680's Exotic Exotic party on Friday. More
than 1 ,000 turned out for the party, which limits participants to two articles of clothing.
"It fell below my expectations," he
added. "It had been built up so much.
It was an experience I had to go for,
but it wasn't amazing. It just wasn't
what I thought it would be."
Typically, gaining entry to the actu
al building poses one of the greatest
challenges to potential partygoers.
Attendees this year found it no differ
ent.
"I got there at 9:45 p.m. and had to
wait in line for 45 minutes," Leßlanc
said."People were pushing and being
impatient. I wore flip-flops and by the
end of the night I was bleeding on my
feet. What bothered me most was the
security."
This year's party security involved
multiple SUID check points, an as
pect of the evening Leßlanc and oth
ers called "annoying."
Sophomore Katie Lampe agreed.

"It was fun once you got inside,"
Lampe said. "But it was such a let
down with the security outside. If you
didn't have your ID, you couldn't get
in at all. The cops were being mean,
with three different stations checking
people one at a time." The security
measures created a "huge line," she
said.
The security force for the party in
volved up to 15 people, including
three deputies and a lieutenant from
the Department of Public Safety, ac
cording to 680 Social Manager
Colleen Ferrand-Andrew,a senior.
"We started planning the party in
fall quarter," she told The Daily. "It
was a big undertaking. The residents
did a great job. making sure every
body was ok."
The capacity crowd at 680 ap
proached 1,000 people, according to
the maximum occupancy figures pro
vided by Ferrand-Andrew.
Among the masses was senior
Sara Bowling, who said she has at
tended Exotic Erotic each of the past
four years.

"It was great," Bowling said. "They
have gotten better each year control
ling the number of people. It was def
initely fun: it was an experience. Lots
of parties are the same, but [with Ex
otic Erotic] you know it's going to be
crazy,you know it's going to be a good
time."
"It's such a fun party because
everyone is there," lssakova added.
" ITiere are people there you might
not usually see at parties."
While the party is infamous on
campus and anxiously anticipated by
many, some students expressed more
negative reviews.
"It was too out of control," said BJ
Johnson, a freshman who sported a
Speedo and a sailor hat to the party.
"They kept not letting people in. Peo
ple kept coming up and getting
turned away. We knew we had to get
there early, but we were still frustrat
ed we couldn't get in."
Nonetheless, Johnson added that
he will "try to go again next year."
Others used Exotic Erotic as a mi
crocosm for all that is dismal about

the Stanford party scene.
"It seems kind of stupid," said
sophomore Mozzi Etemadi. "I don't
like any Stanford parties: you go and
it's a room full of sweaty men and
maybe two girls, dancing in a room
too small to walk. Exotic Erotic seems
like sweaty men, only more of them
and naked."
For those not willing to experience
the nakedness, there were various
other ways to enjoy the Exotic Erotic
festivities.
Sigma Chi held its Xotic Erotic,
which the fraternity billed as the place
to go when 680 filled up.
While Sigma Chi and various
other Row fraternities opened their
doors to students Friday, with the long
lines and crowds of people waiting
outside of 680, there was a subculture
of partying outdoors, despite the cool
temperatures Friday night.
"It looked really crowded," said
junior Amanda Felson. "I thought I
could have more fun with the people
spilling out of party or those who
couldn't get it."

For those not willing to experience
the nakedness, there were various
other ways to enjoy the Exotic Erotic
festivities.
Sigma Chi held its Xotic Erotic,
which the fraternity billed as the place
to go when 680 filled up.
While Sigma Chi and various
other Row fraternities opened their
doors to students Friday, with the long
lines and crowds of people waiting
outside of 680, there was a subculture
of partying outdoors, despite the cool
temperatures Friday night.
"It looked really crowded," said
junior Amanda Felson. "I thought I
could have more fun with the people
spilling out of party or those who
couldn't get it."
