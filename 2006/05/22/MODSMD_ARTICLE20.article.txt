## Cardinal fail to get NCAA bid 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES STAFF WRITER 
Expectations reached their highest
level this weekend for the men's golf
team at the NCAA West Regional, but
the Cardinal were unable to execute.
They tied for 14th and failed to earn a
second-straight NCAA Championship
berth.
The men expected to have an advan
tage at the Omni Tbcson National Golf
Course in Tucson, Ariz. The windy, dry
course, where temperatures neared 100
degrees, was new to many of the Card's
opponents.
Instead, particularly difficult holes
forced the Card to waste numerous
strokes, on what was an otherwise easy
course.
"I thought we played fairly well other
than a few holes that gave us trouble,"
Coach Conrad Ray said. "One in partic
ular was the final hole in the second
round, No. 18. We made some big num
bers coming in and dropped eight shots
on the hole as a team "
The Cardinal started strong with a
five-under 283 and were tied for seventh
after the first day (a top-10 finish was
needed for the team to qualify for the
NCAA Championship). The squad fell
off from there, with a five-over 290 in the
second round.
"If you look at our scores that second
round and give ourselves pars on No. 18,
we come away with a pretty solid round,
and we're in good shape to go into day
three," Ray said.'i don't think there was
a sense of panic, but there was definitely
a heightened awareness that this is post
season and do or die."
In the final round, the Cardinal made
a slight rebound to a one-under 287, but
it wasn't enough to move up the stand
ings, and the team remained in a tie for
14th. Florida and Arizona shared first
place, and they, along with eight other
teams, advanced to the Championship,
May 31-June 3 in Sunriver, Oregon.
"We almost got back into the mix [in
the third round), but struggled again on
the final nine holes," Ray said. "It was
one of those weeks where we really did
n't put it together."
Freshman Dodge Kemmer led the
Cardinal, tying for 32nd (68-74-70-212).
After a season highlight of tying for 10th
at the Pac-10 Championship, Kemmer
felt differently about this finish.
"It's not a highlight for me," Kemmer
said."lf I had helped the team qualify for
the NCAA [Championship], then it
would have been a highlight. It basically
came down to a couple shots on a couple
holes that we did not execute well
enough, and those cost us enough shots
to miss qualifying."
Sophomore Rob Grube was also dis
appointed. After earning the regional
title last year, he tied for 57th.
"Obviously, last year ended on a bet
ter note for me and the team," Grube
said. "However, I would definitely say
that we were better as a team this year
than last. Personally. I know I'm better
than I was last year, but unfortunately, I
didn't perform better when it mattered."
Grube's first two rounds of 71 and 69
gave way to a three-over 75, setting him
far behind.
"For him. [problems came up more]
in the middle of the round," Ray said.
