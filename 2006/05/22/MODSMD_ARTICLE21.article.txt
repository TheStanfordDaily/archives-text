### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The combination of rainy weather,
Baylor and the San Francisco Tennis
Center has not been good to Stanford
men's tennis this year. The No. 13 Car
dinal (18-4) dropped a close 4-3 quar
terfinal match to No. 4 Baylor late last
night after the match was moved to the
indoor courts because of bad weather.
Although the Card had a 3-1 lead yes
terday, it was a sort of deja vu from
their last meeting with Baylor — a 5-1
February loss in San Francisco.
No. 4 Baylor barely picked up the
doubles point by winning the first and
third doubles matches. At the third posi
tion. senior Jon Wong and junior James
Wan dropped their set 7-9. But then,
freshmen Matt Bruch and Blake Muller
evened the score by winning their match
in a tiebreaker. The first point went to
Baylor when No. 16 senior KC Corkery
and junior James Pade fell to No. 23
Michal Kokta and Lars Poerschke.B-6.
After dropping the first point, Stan
ford hit the singles matches with a
vengeance. At the second spot. No. 16
Bruch made quick work of No. 65
Matija Zgaga.
The top and third singles matches
included plenty of momentum shifts
and were extremely nerve-wracking
for spectators and fans. Both Corkery
and Pade dropped their first sets but
came back to win their second sets.
In the third set. No. 25 Corkery
found himself up 5-2 against No. 4 Po
erschke. On the other hand, Pade
found himself down a break, 2-4,
against No. 29 Kokta. Poerschke
worked himself back into the set and
diminished Corkery's lead to 5-4.
Meanwhile, Pade broke back and
evened the score at 4-apiece. and his
match continued to exchange service
games until 6-all.
The Cardinal hung tough and pre
vailed in both matches. Pade won the
tiebreaker and his match just before
Corkery closed out the third set, 6-4.
With the score at 3-1 in Stanford's
favor, the remaining singles matches
jumped on the court. The Cardinal
dropped all three of the remaining first
sets. In the second, Wan fought back to
win an easy 6-1 against Will Ward. The
junior then jumped to a 3-1 lead in the
third before Ward won the next four
games in a row to go up 5-3.
Meanwhile, Muller took the second
6-1, and sophomore Phil Kao lost the
second set and his match, 6-4,6-3.
With Stanford leading 3-2 overall.
Wan neared the end of the third just as
Muller began his final set. In the
tiebreaker of the third set, the Bear
narrowly beat out Wan to even the
score at 3-all.
The fate of the semifinal bid now
rested in the hands of two freshmen
competing in the third set. Baylor's
Matt Brown earned a break early in
the set to go up 3-2 and then main
tained that lead before earning anoth
er break to win 6-3.
On Saturday afternoon, the ease
with which Stanford shut out Duke
proved that the teams' respective No.
13 and No. 4 seedings meant little to
the host team.
"I've always had a lot of confidence
in our team," Coach John Whitlinger
said. "Our ranking is very low — we
never felt that we were a 13th-ranked
team. But you have to go out and prove
it, and that was a start [on Saturday]."
At theTaube Family Tennis Center,
Stanford used its home court advantage

and multitude of fans to power through
the Devils, starting with the doubles
matches. Each of the three matches got
off to a strong start, and all three teams
led their opponents by at least three
games at some point in the pro-set.
Stanford's top doubles team. No. 16
Corkery and Pade, barely gave Duke a
glimpse at the match. The pair domi
nated its opponents and completed a
decisive 8-1 victory when Corkery hit a
sharply angled volley off of a weak re
turn.
On Court 2, the freshmen tandem of
Bruch and Muller were the second
match to finish, clinching the doubles

point for Stanford on Muller's serve.
The Cardinal led 7-5, 40-15, so after
Duke salvaged one matchpoint, Muller
served again at 40-30 and a sprayed re
turn iced the doubles point for the Card.
At the third doubles position.
Duke s Ned Samuelson and Ludovic
Walter led Wong and Wan 7-6 when
doubles play was halted.
As singles play began, most of the
six first sets looked tight, but Stanford
managed to pull ahead to win five.
At the top singles position, Corkery
quickly fell into a 0-3 deficit against
No. 5 Walter. However, the senior cap
tain eventually settled down, evening
the score to 3-apiece and 4-all before
pulling ahead 5-4. At 5-4, Walter fired
long to give Corkery the first set.
Corkery's freshman teammate
worked a little faster. After a couple
exchanges of service holds, Bruch
took off and ran with the set. Bruch
led Duke's Jonathan Stokke 4-1 and 5-
2, and finally closed out the set 6-3 with
an ace.
On Court 3. Pade and his opponent
exchanged holds until the very end of
the first set. Up 5-4, Pade broke to take
the set, 6-4. In the second half of the
singles lineup. Wan remained on serve
with his opponent and finally pulled
ahead at 3-all to win 6-4.
After earning a break to go up 4-2,
Muller finished out the first, 6-3.
Meanwhile, sophomore Phil Kao lost a
close first set,4-6, to Stephen Amritraj.
In the second sets, it was the middle
of the Stanford lineup that closed out
Duke. Pade's match finished first; the
junior won 6-4,6-4 against No. 67 Peter
Rodrigues to improved his record to
19-3 in dual matches.
Bruch closed out his match with a
huge inside-out forehand winner to
the ad-side, defeating No. 46 Stokke,6-
3, 6-4. Wan closed out the perfect 4-0
for Stanford with his 6-4,6-3 win over
Joey Atas.
