# Women's tennis plays NCAA semifinals today
## 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
After weeks of uninterrupted sunshine on the Farm, the
weather decided to turn nasty on the biggest weekend in NCAA
tennis. Stanford, host of the first-ever combined men's and
women's NCAA tennis tournament, was left scrambling to find
ways to keep everything on schedule, sending matches to indoor
courts in San Francisco, frantically working to dry the courts

every time the rain let up
and playing matches deep
into the night.
Despite event organiz
ers' best efforts, the Tourna
ment is now off-schedule.
Fortunately for the top
ranked Stanford women
though, all of their matches
were played and won at the
Taube Tennis Center, con

105-straight home wins
streak.The team beat No. 16
Texas Christian University
on Thursday, 4-0, and No. 8
Duke on Friday, also 4-0.
Because of the rain, the
Card's semifinal against No.

morning. Should the Card
make the Finals, they will
battle for their third straight
NCAA Championship at
noon tomorrow, not at 6:30
p.m. today as originally
scheduled.
Quarterfinals:
Stanford 4, Duke 0
To reach the seminfinals,
the Card first had to go
through eighth-seeded
Duke (20-8), fresh off a 4-1
win over ninth-seeded
North Carolina, 4-1. The
match, scheduled to begin
at 6 p.m. on Friday, did not
actually start until 9:20 p.m.
due to rain delays. It did not
finish until just before mid
night, when junior Theresa
Logar's win on court three
clinched the 4-0 victory
over the Blue Devils.

"These rain delays are inconvenient, no doubt about it,"
Logar said. "The skies hate us and I have no idea why it's raining
so much, but we're dealing with it. Any time we get to play, we're
ready to play. We gear ourselves up every single time."
The crowd — cold, huddled in blankets and probably a little
impatient — was small but boisterous, even clamoring for the
