# Women's tennis plays NCAA semifinals today
## 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
After weeks of uninterrupted sunshine on the Farm, the
weather decided to turn nasty on the biggest weekend in NCAA
tennis. Stanford, host of the first-ever combined men's and
women's NCAA tennis tournament, was left scrambling to find
ways to keep everything on schedule, sending matches to indoor
courts in San Francisco, frantically working to dry the courts

every time the rain let up
and playing matches deep
into the night.
Despite event organiz
ers' best efforts, the Tourna
ment is now off-schedule.
Fortunately for the top
ranked Stanford women
though, all of their matches
were played and won at the
Taube Tennis Center, con
tinuing their impressive
105-straight home wins
streak.The team beat No. 16
Texas Christian University
on Thursday, 4-0, and No. 8
Duke on Friday, also 4-0.
Because of the rain, the
Card's semifinal against No.
4 Florida — the last team
Stanford has lost to — will
take place at 11 a.m. this
morning. Should the Card
make the Finals, they will
battle for their third straight
NCAA Championship at
noon tomorrow, not at 6:30
p.m. today as originally
scheduled.
Quarterfinals:
Stanford 4, Duke 0
To reach the seminfinals,
the Card first had to go
through eighth-seeded
Duke (20-8), fresh off a 4-1
win over ninth-seeded
North Carolina, 4-1. The
match, scheduled to begin
at 6 p.m. on Friday, did not
actually start until 9:20 p.m.
due to rain delays. It did not
finish until just before mid
night, when junior Theresa
Logar's win on court three
clinched the 4-0 victory
over the Blue Devils.

"These rain delays are inconvenient, no doubt about it,"
Logar said. "The skies hate us and I have no idea why it's raining
so much, but we're dealing with it. Any time we get to play, we're
ready to play. We gear ourselves up every single time."
The crowd — cold, huddled in blankets and probably a little
impatient — was small but boisterous, even clamoring for the

peared to be stalling.
"It's really been great having the
crowd because there are a lot of your
friends and family, even late at night,
with the rain and cold and every
thing," Logar said.
The No. 1 and No. 3 doubles
teams secured the doubles point for
Stanford as senior Alice Barnes and
junior Anne Yelsey earned an 8-3
win, followed by an 8-5 victory by
sophomore Lejla Hodzic and fresh
man Jessica Nguyen.
Singles play went smoothly for
Stanford, with courts two through six
taking the first set. Eighth-ranked Liu
dropped her first set to fourth-ranked
Daniela Bercek, but was up 4-3 in the
second set when the match was decid

Yelsey then took a 6-3,6-3 decision on
the fourth court before Logar
claimed the match on court three.
Round of 16: Stanford 4, TCU 0
Though it didn't start out pretty,
the women's round-of-16 match
against TCU (23-7) finished just as
expected. The women finally took
court in the waning daylight at 7:30
p.m. The weather at that point was
brisk and somewhat windy, and the
players had been sitting and waiting
for a previous match to conclude.
TCU jumped out to an early dou
bles lead. At one point,TCU lead 3-
0 on both the first and second courts
while Stanford led 3-0 on the third
court.
The Card, however, battled back,
and both courts one and two took the
lead from TCU. Stanford's No. 3 dou
bles team of Hodzic and Nguyen
never forfeited its lead and won 8-4.
The nationally top-ranked team of
Barnes and Yelsey then clinched the
doubles point with an 8-6 win over

14th-ranked Helena Besovic and Ana
Cetnik. Liu and Durkin were down 5-
6 when doubles play was suspended.
"TCU started out very motivated
and started off in the doubles play
very well." Coach Lele Forood said.
"We had to work really hard to get
back into some of those matches."
The team seemed to take momen
tum from the doubles point and apply
it to its singles play,quickly jumping to
the lead on all but the third court. No.

six straight games to take the set. She
took her second set, as well, to give
the Card their third team point of the
night.
Sophomore Whitney Deason se
cured the win for Stanford by beat
ing Kewa Nichols, 6-1,6-2, at the No.
5 position.
"Once our team got the doubles
point, 1 think our team was pretty in
spired to start the singles, and I think
that showed," Forood said of the
Cardinal's dominance of singles
play.
