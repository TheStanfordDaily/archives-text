# Seven-game win streak snapped
## Bruins take two of three from Cardinal in Los Angeles 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
Nolan Gallagher's track record
during the month of May has been
nothing short of dominant. Last
season as a Stanford freshman, the
hurler posted a 0.94 ERA in eight
May appearances.
And entering this weekend's
series against UCLA, Gallagher
had been enjoying continued suc
cess this May. In two starts and
two relief appearances — one of
which lasted seven innings — the
sophomore had surrendered just
three earned runs in 17.2 innings
of work.
But Gallagher's most impres
sive May feat came on Saturday,
when the promising righthander
evened the Cardinal's series
against the Bruins by tossing the
first complete game of his career
to lead Stanford to the 6-2 victory.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal
(29-22, 11-13 Pac-10), Gallagher
was only available to throw one of
the team's three games this week
end, and Stanford pitching fal
tered in the two other games.
The Bruins (30-22, 12-9 Pac
-10) got to Stanford ace Greg
Reynolds early in the series open
er and cruised to an 8-1 win. On
Sunday, UCLA rallied back from
a 5-0 deficit to win the rubber
match on first baseman Tim Stew
art's walkoff homer in the bottom
of the ninth. With the loss, the Car
dinal were unable to finish the
season with a .500 record in con
ference play.
Stanford headed south for its
UCLA series with the momentum
of a season-high seven-game win
ning streak. But, from the outset
of their Friday evening matchup, it
became clear the breaks weren't
falling the Cardinal's way.
UCLA's first two batters,
shortstop Brandon Crawford and
third baseman Jermaine Curtis,
started off the Bruins with back
to-back triples in the top of the
first. Curtis came in to score on a

double by Hector Ambriz —
UCLA's cleanup hitter and start
ing pitcher. Ambriz later scored
on a sacrifice fly to push the
UCLA lead to 3-0.
That was all the offense Am
briz needed to pick up his third
win of the season. The UCLA
righthander stymied the Stanford
bats for eight innings, scattering
seven hits and allowing just one
run on a wild pitch in the sixth. But
the Cardinal were retired in order
over the last three frames, as Am
briz and reliever Brian Schroeder
closed out the UCLA victory.
On Saturday, though, it was a
completely different story for
Stanford. With Gallagher on the
hill, UCLA was unable to put to
gether any sort of a significant
rally. The Bruins picked up an un
earned run in the first on an error
from rightfielder Michael Taylor.
They got one more in the sixth, but
by that time Stanford had already
built a 5-1 advantage.
Taylor atoned for his error by
launching a solo homerun in the
fifth inning, his third of the year.
Senior shortstop Chris Minaker
and senior second baseman Chris
Lewis also went long for the Car
dinal. giving Gallagher a comfort
able cushion to work with in the
final innings of the game.
"Nolan did an incredible job,"
Minaker said. "He really attacked
their hitters and pitched with no
fear. His stuff was great, his atti
tude was awesome, and he really
dominated from start to finish."
"I tried to be a leader and put
some guys on my back, but the
team kept picking me up. too,"
Gallagher said. "They're playing
for me, so I wanted to play for
them."
But the Cardinal were unable
to sustain that momentum in the
series finale yesterday afternoon.
Stanford got off to a promising
start against UCLA hurler Tyson
Brummett, putting four runs on
the board in the top of the first.
Junior centerfielder Ryan Sea
well and freshman designated hit
ter Grant Escue singled to open
the frame, and Minaker came
through with an RBI single up the
middle that scored Seawell. Lewis
then delivered a two-run single to

left that brought Escue and Mi
naker around to score. Rookie
first baseman Jason Castro
rounded out the Stanford offen
sive barrage with a single to right
that scored third baseman Randy
Molina for the Cardinal's fourth
run.
Stanford stretched its lead to 5-
0 in the fourth, but UCLA an
swered back with a monstrous six
run rally in the fifth, capped by a
three-run blast by Stewart.
Lewis homered in the top of
the sixth to knot the score at six
apiece, and both squads picked up
another run in the eighth to send
the game into the final frame tied
at 7-all. But with two outs, Stewart
came through with his second
homer of the afternoon, a solo

blast to left off on an 0-1 count to
hand UCLA the 8-7 win.
The Cardinal conclude their
regular season this week with an
away game at Pacific on Wednes
day and a two-game set versus
UC-Davis on Friday and Satur
day.
Stanford baseball will need to
finish strong over its final three
contests to reach the NCAA play
offs. That's a touch ironic consid
ering that UC-Davis has already
helped stymie Stanford postsea
son hopes in two huge upsets this
school year. In football, the visit
ing Aggies shocked Stanford 20-
17 on Sept. 17,2005, and in men's
basketball, Davis claimed an
equally improbable 64-58 victory
on Dec. 4,2005.
