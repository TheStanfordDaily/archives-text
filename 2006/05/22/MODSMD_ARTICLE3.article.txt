## From campus to Kyoto, Stanford takes Beirut global 
### DAVID GAUVEY HERBERT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Opponents in Beirut usually stand on op
posite sides of a ping-pong table. Last week,
Stanford students faced each other on oppo
site sides of the Pacific Ocean.
Juniors Josh Merritt and Mike Knuepfel
organized what they believe is the first inter
continental match of Beirut ever lateThurs

day night. Merritt and friends set lip Weh
cameras and a microphone in the Serra
lounge and Knuepfel did the same in a Stan
ford in Kyoto center classroom. Both teams
arranged 10 cups on opposite ends like in a
normal match, but when a shooter hit a cup,
they removed it and their opponents re
moved and drank the corresponding cup.
Play began at 11:23 p.m. Pacific Standard
Time, or 3:23 p.m. in Kyoto.

The concept seemed simple enough, but
the match was understandably plagued by
technical difficulties. Merritt broadcast the
match on Serra's new projector — a gift
from the Munger Graduate Residences
project for all the construction noise the
dorm has suffered through this year — but
the streaming video over Skype was choppy
and delayed.The video was also too blurry to
know what cups were hit, and so Merritt and

teammate junior Oscar Bustos and
Knuepfel and his partnerTafiti Uso were left
to use the honor system and describe what
cups they made.
"Penultimate back left," junior and self
appointed commentator Emmerich Davies
directed with some difficulty, leading some
onlookers to liken the game to Battleship.
Curious Japanese students from
nearby Kyoto University, who were
at the center for a party, came and
went throughout the match. They
struggled to understand the game
and ended up talking to students in
Serra over the Web cam."
Merritt and Bustos started out
strong and built a 6-2 lead, while
Knuepfel blamed his team's early
struggles on the McDonald's soda
cups they were using. But he and
Uso soon acclimated themselves
to the equipment — taller and
narrower than traditional red
party cups — and stormed back to
even the score to 2-2. Bustos soon
found his range, however, and pro
pelled the North American side to
victory. He hit the final shot to a
chorus of cheers in Serra, followed
by a delayed "Ohhhhhh" from

Japan.
After onlooker Tori Niemynski,
a junior, declared an "international
pee break," the teams split two
more games before calling it a night
— or an afternoon on the Japanese
side.
Knuepfel called the match a suc
cess.
"The excessive use of technology
to play a drinking game was a bit
ridiculous," he said, "But in the end
the reactions were pretty positive
from both the American and Japan
ese students."
This was Merritt and Knuepfel's
second foray in introducing Beirut
to another continent — they played
in Sicily in the summer of 2004
while on a Stanford dig — and Mer
ritt said he saw the event as more
than just fun.
"Nothing helps ease a difficult
cultural transition like drinking
with your good friends and doing
something outrageous," he said. "If
we expose people to new things in
the process, it's all the better."
