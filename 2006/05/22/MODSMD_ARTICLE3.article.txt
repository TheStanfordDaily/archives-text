## From campus to Kyoto, Stanford takes Beirut global 
### DAVID GAUVEY HERBERT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Opponents in Beirut usually stand on op
posite sides of a ping-pong table. Last week,
Stanford students faced each other on oppo
site sides of the Pacific Ocean.
Juniors Josh Merritt and Mike Knuepfel
organized what they believe is the first inter
continental match of Beirut ever lateThurs

day night. Merritt and friends set lip Weh
cameras and a microphone in the Serra
lounge and Knuepfel did the same in a Stan
ford in Kyoto center classroom. Both teams
arranged 10 cups on opposite ends like in a
normal match, but when a shooter hit a cup,
they removed it and their opponents re
moved and drank the corresponding cup.
Play began at 11:23 p.m. Pacific Standard
Time, or 3:23 p.m. in Kyoto.

The concept seemed simple enough, but
the match was understandably plagued by
technical difficulties. Merritt broadcast the
match on Serra's new projector — a gift
from the Munger Graduate Residences
project for all the construction noise the
dorm has suffered through this year — but
the streaming video over Skype was choppy
and delayed.The video was also too blurry to
know what cups were hit, and so Merritt and

teammate junior Oscar Bustos and
Knuepfel and his partnerTafiti Uso were left
to use the honor system and describe what
cups they made.
"Penultimate back left," junior and self
appointed commentator Emmerich Davies
directed with some difficulty, leading some
onlookers to liken the game to Battleship.
