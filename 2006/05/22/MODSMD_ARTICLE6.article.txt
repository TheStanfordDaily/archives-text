# Never Again: Wiesel offers call to action
## "Indifference at its extreme leads to death." Elie Wiesel Holocaust survivor and human rights activist sees failure to act in Darfur 
### MEGAN WATKINS MANAGING EDITOR 
The Holocaust may not have much in
common with Oprah Winfrey's far-reaching
influence, but last night at Memorial Audito
rium Elie Wiesel managed to relate them
both, all while reflecting on the role of hu
manity in genocide, both past and present.
In January, Winfrey chose Wiesel's book,
"Night," a reflection on his experiences dur
ing the Holocaust, as her book of the month.
In his Sunday speech, "Against Indifference:
Reflections on Never Again,'" co-sponsored
by the ASSU Speakers Bureau. Hillel. Stu
dents Taking Action Now: Darfur (STAND)
and the Jewish Students Association. Wiesel
joked that Winfrey's stamp of approval
would probably have a bigger effect on book
sales than that of a group of world leaders.
A Holocaust survivor, professor at Boston
University, human rights activist and a win
ner of the Nobel Peace Prize, Wiesel's speech
went far beyond the realm of humor, instead
serving as a call to action. He remarked that,
indifference, rather than hate, is the opposite
of love.

"Indifference at its extreme leads to
death," Wiesel said."lndifference enables the
enemy to be victorious. And so my good
friends, never again should we be, will we be,
indifferent."
Junior Nikki Serapio, coordinator of the
STAND national executive committee and
STAND at Stanford, echoed these senti
ments in his presentation prior to Wiesel's
speech.
"Mr. Wiesel has shown us that the de
mands of ethics mark us one-by-one. and that
our lives sooner or later confront us with a
question of either/or," she said. "We either
choose to restore the dignity and the rights of
the less fortunate, or we choose to ignore."
Serapio followed this with policy recom
mendations also mentioned in the Stanford
STAND-organized op-ed that appeared in
Sunday's New York Times. Calling for Bush
to set a deadline for Khartoum to accept U.N.
troops, the piece was written by former Na
tional Security Advisor Anthony Lake and
Francis Fukuyama and offers NATO inter
vention as a last resort.
Prior to his appearance at MemAud
Wiesel spoke at a benefit for Darfur relief ef
forts. Here he noted that many of his efforts
have failed to make the changes he hopes for
in Darfur.
"It didn't help. I wrote articles. I made
speeches," Wiesel said. "I couldn't wake up
the community. Is it because they were black or
because there was no oil? I"he fact is, it is a
tragedy."
In his subsequent speech at MemAud. Wiesel
spoke about Darfur, but emphasized a larger mes
sage, quoting the Bible and adding his own mes
sage.
"Thou shall not stand idly by. Because if you
stand by when someone else is being tortured —
tormented — you become an accomplice," he
said.
Wiesel's biblical references did not end there.
He also noted that the statement 'Never Again'
originated in the Bible when God promised Noah
that he would not destroy the world again. He
added that God said nothing about humans de
stroying their own world.
Despite the religious undertones, Wiesel's
speech appealed to a diverse audience. While jun
ior Fannie Chen is not Jewish she did not find his
religious perspective alienating.
"1 thought that he emphasized a common hu
manity really well, no matter what race or religion
people were." Chen said. "He tied his own experi
ences from a Jewish background nicely to his
sense of a common humanity. He spoke as if to a
mainly Jewish audience, but because of that he
highlighted how his religion invoked in him a re
sponsibility toward greater humanity."
