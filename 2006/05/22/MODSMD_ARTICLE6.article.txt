# Never Again: Wiesel offers call to action
## "Indifference at its extreme leads to death." Elie Wiesel Holocaust survivor and human rights activist sees failure to act in Darfur 
### MEGAN WATKINS MANAGING EDITOR 
The Holocaust may not have much in
common with Oprah Winfrey's far-reaching
influence, but last night at Memorial Audito
rium Elie Wiesel managed to relate them
both, all while reflecting on the role of hu
manity in genocide, both past and present.
In January, Winfrey chose Wiesel's book,
"Night," a reflection on his experiences dur
ing the Holocaust, as her book of the month.
In his Sunday speech, "Against Indifference:
Reflections on Never Again,'" co-sponsored
by the ASSU Speakers Bureau. Hillel. Stu
dents Taking Action Now: Darfur (STAND)
and the Jewish Students Association. Wiesel
joked that Winfrey's stamp of approval
would probably have a bigger effect on book
sales than that of a group of world leaders.
A Holocaust survivor, professor at Boston
University, human rights activist and a win
ner of the Nobel Peace Prize, Wiesel's speech

serving as a call to action. He remarked that,
indifference, rather than hate, is the opposite
of love.

our lives sooner or later confront us with a
question of either/or," she said. "We either
choose to restore the dignity and the rights of
the less fortunate, or we choose to ignore."
Serapio followed this with policy recom
mendations also mentioned in the Stanford
STAND-organized op-ed that appeared in
Sunday's New York Times. Calling for Bush
to set a deadline for Khartoum to accept U.N.
troops, the piece was written by former Na
tional Security Advisor Anthony Lake and
Francis Fukuyama and offers NATO inter
vention as a last resort.
Prior to his appearance at MemAud
Wiesel spoke at a benefit for Darfur relief ef
forts. Here he noted that many of his efforts
have failed to make the changes he hopes for
in Darfur.
"It didn't help. I wrote articles. I made
speeches," Wiesel said. "I couldn't wake up
