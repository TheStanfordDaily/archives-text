## Push for Muslim center gains momentum 
### KAT LEWIN STAFF WRITER 
In an effort to further strengthen Is
lamic studies at Stanford, students have
mounted a grassroots effort to build a
Muslim Cultural Community Center on
campus. However, some have expressed
mixed opinions over whether these
changes are happening fast enough.
A proposal to build a Muslim Cultur
al Community Center on campus was
submitted to the administration last De
cember. according to Muslim Students
Awareness Network (MSAN) President
Mohammad Subeh. a co-terminal stu
dent in sociology.
"When we sent out a petition with the
proposal last quarter, we got thousands
of signatures and positive comments in
support of the Center," Subeh said.
"The main goals of the Muslim Cul
tural Community Center are to serve as
an academic and social resource for Mus
lims and members of Stanford's commu
nity who are interested in the Muslim
world," said outgoing MSAN President
Omar Shakir, a junior.
"Students can learn more about the
Muslim World, which includes 52 na
tions. 60 languages and nearly a quarter
of the world's population." Shakir said.
"There will be resources for students
interested in studying abroad in. doing
research on. or simply learning more
about the politics, cultures and soci
eties of countries from Morocco to In
donesia.
"The Center will also act as a commu
nity center for members of the Muslim
cultural community, like others on
campus, providing a safe space for in
dividuals to discuss issues of identity
and resources for personal and aca
demic development," he added.
However, the details regarding a
Muslim Cultural Community center
are currently under discussion. And.
according to Shakir, no definite open
ing date or location — temporary or
permanent — has been decided.
"We're hoping it will open in the
fall somewhere temporary on cam
pus, but that's still up to the Universi
ty to account for," Subeh said. "There
are a lot of roadblocks we have to get
through. It's mainly a matter of find
ing space and funding, but it's a big
initiative, that deserves such re
sources. It's very important to us to
take this time working out all of the
details beforehand so that the center
can serve the needs of the community
in a sustainable manner."

Both Subeh and Shakir said they
feel the Center might help open dis
course about Islam on campus. In a
May 17 article in The San Jose Mer
cury News, Stanford's Islamic Studies
program was faulted by students for
growing too slowly in spite of an al
most million core endowment.
"Have we at Stanford made
progress quickly enough? In my opin
ion, no," said Robert Gregg,professor
of religious studies and director of the
Islamic Studies Program. "Progress
depends on having funding for more
faculty working in the field, on adding
senior scholars to our number, and on
taking care to fashion just the kind of
multi-disciplinary, multi-departmen
tal program that the University lead
ership. the donors and the faculty in
volved wish to have in place for teach
ing and research."
However, according to Gregg,
some progress has been made. Junior
scholar Behnam Sadeki has been se
cured to arrive next fall, and a search
for another scholar of Islam to join
Stanford's staff is underway. Addi
tionally, fundraising is planned to re
cruit five more professors who spe

cialize in Islamic studies.
One major complaint students
have expressed about the program is
that current course offerings are inad
equate and do not meet demand to
learn about issues of Muslim society
and culture.
"Islamic Studies is a crucial need,"
Shakir said. "We're simply not meet
ing the growing demand of students,
as classes like islam and the West' are
constantly over-subscribed to."
Gregg said this criticism was un
warranted.
"I am aware of 22 courses this year
having to do directly with Islam, not
counting the 27 courses in Arabic lan
guage. in history, religious studies, po
litical science, C'ASA. and IPS," he
said." I know of no student who was
turned away from any of these. In
deed, several had reasonable and
comfortable class size."
Subeh said he felt that more Uni
versity participation in both the Mus
lim Cultural Community Center and
the Islamic Studies Program would
improve the situation.
"The administration needs to step
it up a notch and be more proactive,"

he said. "At this point it's all students
who are working behind the scenes in
the planning and development of
these initiatives. It's 24 hours a day
working on these huge ventures —
it's not just planning an event or con
cert.
"When completed, the center will
leave a lasting impact on generations
to come at Stanford," he added. "The
University has a lot to benefit from
this project, so it should be putting
considerably more time and effort
into the development off these two
initiatives."
While both sides agree that
progress is slow, Gregg expressed op
timism for the future of Islamic stud
ies at Stanford.
"1 believe we are taking a different
approach to creating an excellent
program for Islamic studies than is
found elsewhere, that we have good
student interest in the study of Islam
ic history and religion, as well as var
ied approaches to the study of Mus
lim societies," he said, "And I am by
no means discouraged by what we
have now in place, and by what the fu
ture promises."

the planning and development of
these initiatives. It's 24 hours a day
working on these huge ventures —
it's not just planning an event or con
cert.
"When completed, the center will
leave a lasting impact on generations
to come at Stanford," he added. "The
University has a lot to benefit from
this project, so it should be putting
considerably more time and effort
into the development off these two
initiatives."
While both sides agree that
progress is slow, Gregg expressed op
timism for the future of Islamic stud
ies at Stanford.
"1 believe we are taking a different
approach to creating an excellent
program for Islamic studies than is
found elsewhere, that we have good
student interest in the study of Islam
ic history and religion, as well as var
ied approaches to the study of Mus
lim societies," he said, "And I am by
no means discouraged by what we
have now in place, and by what the fu
ture promises."
