## Rent My Love

It has been said that a woman needs only three things
in life to be happy: a good job, a good man and a
good apartment. Occasionally my happiness also
involves good prescription painkillers, but for the sake
of the column we 'll stick to the job-man-apartment trio.
Based on my calculations, I am only about a third
as happy as I could be under this definition. 1 am pret
ty comfortable with my postgraduate career plans,
sketchy as they are — intern in the area over the sum
mer, move to San Francisco, become a famous writer
and buy a slave. But my self-imposed singledom and
inability to find a suitable apartment renders me inel
igible for the Happiest Person Ever Award. And that
makes me even more unhappy, to the point where 1
am seriously contemplating killing the person who
currently holds the award and using their blood to
paint a giant frown-y face on my bedroom wall.
There Ls only one solution to my misery: I need to
find a guy and an apartment, preferably at the same
time.This isn't as difficult as it sounds because Craigslist
has both personal advertisements and apartment list
ings. However, a quick search reveals that very few
apartments come furnished with a man, and those that
do charge you by the hour for Boomer's services.
So I can't kill two birds with one stone. But I can
drink a liter of Diet Coke and spin around until 1
throw up. This has nothing to do with anything, but
it's kind of fun and gets my mind off of things until I
suddenly realize that ONE CAN DRAW HUMOR
OUS PARALLELS BETWEEN SEARCHING
FOR APARTMENTS AND SEARCHING FOR A
SIGNIFICANT OTHER. Don't believe me? Read
'em and weep,Skepty McSkeptical:
Cast a wide net. My friends and I made things dif
ficult for ourselves when we decided we would only
look in a few neighborhoods for appropriate apart
ments. We might as well have told ourselves that we
would only talk to landlords who wear pointy green
shoes and like to hide pots of gold. Similarly, I real
ized that I might be limiting myself a bit when I told
myself I would only date half-Jewish singer-song
writers or people writing the next great American
novel. Now my requirements will be much more rea
sonable: a pulse. (Note: We did manage to find a
landlord who is in the process of reclaiming his
Lucky Charms from a band of juvenile delinquents.)
Sane neighbors are important. You could rent a
palace in the middle of North Beach, but if you live
next to Angus the tap dancing pyromaniac, things
aren't going to be pretty. Unfortunately it's hard to
get a sense of your neighbors until you actually move
into the apartment, but you can check for warning
signs like "Fire Ruiz" scrawled on the walls in the
communal hallway. On the same note, when you date
someone, you become associated with his social cir
cle regardless of whether or not you enjoy hanging
out with the Dungeons and Dragons crew. So it's
probably best to cross Josie off your list if the
thought of chilling with her friend Darkness disturbs
you in ways you can't begin to describe.
Good credit will take you far. If a landlord chooses
to consider your application, he will run a credit check
on you and your roommates. A credit report contains
information on where you live, how you pay your bills,
if you've ever filed for bankruptcy, if you've ever been
arrested and if you've ever broken a pinky-promise or
refused to follow through in a game of TVuth or Dare.
The higher your credit score, the more responsible
you seem as tenants and the more likely it is that the
landlord will accept your application. Even though it
sounds scary, the reality is that people perform credit
checks on each other all the time — what do you
think Facebook is for? Granted, few people list
their monthly credit card bill in the "About 4
Me" section,but the information they choose
to present to the online community should
be taken into consideration with everything
else. For example, including "sexual assault"
as an interest is probably a bad sign.
Check out the plumbing. Yes.
