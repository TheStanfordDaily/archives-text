# Gardner Center gives students opportunity to YELL

While Stanford is a bubble for many, some in the Grad
uate School of Education are reaching beyond the con
fines of Stanford campus to those of middle schools and
high schools throughout the Bay Area.
Through the John Gardner Center for Youth and their
Communities, these students work with Center staff to
find methods that will best reach youth and engage them
in their communities. Inspired by and named after a for
mer secretary of health, education and welfare, the Center
seeks to promote knowledge and leadership that will
build strong communities with an emphasis on youth de
velopment.
"John Gardner was a true believer in the power of young
people being civically engaged to create their social
world," Center staff member Michael Montoya says.
Dabney Ingram, a third-year doctoral student, has been
working with the Youth Engaged in Leadership and
Learning (YELL) after-school program as a research as
sistant for a year. Her work focuses on understanding
which environments nurture positive development.
While conducting her research, Ingram works with a
number of schools in Redwood City and Oakland.
"A challenge in this type of field research is gaining ac
cess to school sites," Ingram says. "For example, if we want
to conduct a larger-scale survey across multiple schools to
compare a larger sample of youths' perspectives, then we

need to access a number of school sites and that can be a
challenge.
"I have particularly enjoyed the opportunity to collect
data through multiple methods [such as interviews, field
notes and surveys],..and from learning about the process
of taking a research project from start to finish," she con
tinues.
The Center allows a number of graduate students like
Ingram who are interested in contributing to society to
apply their knowledge of educational theories.
"1 have learned a lot about how to move things from the
ory to action, and that is a valuable set of skills for people
in social innovation," Montoya says.
Based on the belief that youth have valuable insight into
the needs of their communities. YELL organizes student
participants into teams that research issues in their com
munity that are important to them. Following the Center's
curriculum, YELL staff and Stanford graduate students
like Ingram guide YELL participants in creating their re
search, exploring a variety of research methods and ana
lyzing their findings. At the end of the year, the students

share their results in a report proposing specific changes
for the problems they've identified.
One group of students from Redwood City high schools
spent months interviewing other students about what fac
tors made them feel safe and happy at home and school.
Another group focused on students' desire to learn, iden
tifying other students' negative attitudes as one of the
leading reasons why youth get distracted and discouraged
from taking their academic work seriously. Others look at
more direct practical issues, such as decreasing the price of
bus passes for students in Redwood City.
Ultimately, the Center aims not just to teach research
methods and presentation skills, but to show youth that
they are able to tackle a problem in their communities and
make a change through engaged activism.
Fueled by Gardner's fundamental optimism, the Cen
ter continues to find ways to engage youth in the improve
ment of their own communities. As the Center takes on is
sues of poverty and inequality, it is guided by the words of
its founder: "What we have before us are some breathtak
ing opportunities disguised as insoluble problems."
