## Editorial Religious encounter holds promise 
### 
Recently, the Office for Religious Life in
vited applications for a new Fellowship
for Religious Encounter. This fellow
ship offers up to 16 students a $1,000 stipend
and an opportunity to enter into dialogue with
each other about their own religious tradi
tions. Fellows will meet regularly throughout
the academic year to discuss issues relevant to
their own personal journeys of faith.
What is refreshing about this Fellowship
is that it invites people who are not necessar
ily devoutly religious to apply for the Fellow
ship. Rather, all the application requires is a
genuine interest in spiritual issues and a will
ingness to listen to others of different faiths.
Given the upsetting developments in today's
world, it often seems that an open mind is the
most important prerequisite for addressing
issues concerning religion.
Such an approach is in keeping with the
goals of the Office for Religious Life, which
aims "to guide, nurture and enhance spiritu
al, religious and ethical life within the Stan
ford University community."The Fellowship
for Religious Encounter rounds out an array
of programming including the speaker series
"What Matters to Me and Why" and other
seminars. These programs encourage modes
of thinking about religion that are inclusive
and reconciliatory.
But some may disagree with the Office
for Religious Life's interfaith approach to
religions. After all, such a feel-good ap
proach threatens to reduce all religion to its
lowest common denominator. It also runs
counter to many religious traditions, where
the emphasis is often placed on doctrine and
orthodoxy over dialogue and compromise.
Such an emphasis is valid within the spe
cific framework of any given religion. Fol
lowers of a particular religious tradition
should have the freedom to hold fast to spe
cific tenets of their faith. Yet such a perspec
tive is incomplete once it leaves the frame
work of that particular religion and comes
into contact with other different religious
perspectives. While many of us may be able
to articulate our own personal beliefs, we

need to learn to communicate them to oth
ers with radically different backgrounds.
We ought to realize the urgent need for
clarity when thinking about religion. The
stakes run high in a world where internation
al relations are framed in terms of the clash
between major world religions, and religion
is used to justify wars against other segments
of humanity. Even in the world of pop cul
ture, the success of movies like "The Da
Vinci Code" reveals a much broader interest
in religion. Amid all this unclear and impre
cise thinking about religion, we need to talk
about religion honestly and productively.
Clearly, any talk that the Fellows engage in
is unlikely to resolve the major culture wars
that are raging throughout the world. Never
theless, we hope that such dialogue will help
us think about the role that religion plays in
our community. In previous volumes, the
Board has highlighted the need for greater
discourse ("Campus needs more religious di
alogue," Feb. 23,2005 and "Religious groups
must seek more productive dialogue," Apr.
28,2005). These editorials were written when
religious interactions on campus were count
er-productive. We believe that the fellowship
will have value if it engenders progress in the
way religion is viewed on campus.
The Fellows have the potential to shape
such discourse on the Farm and serve as a
model for the rest of the campus. As such, it is
important that their discussions do not only
benefit the 16 of them. Rather, they should
consider opening some of their meetings to
the public and organizing events within their
residences. They should also make available
some form of written document at the end of
their fellowship, whether it be a record of
their regular meetings or a 100-page docu
ment on the state of religious life on campus.
We applaud the Office for Religious Life
for its commitment to increasing dialogue
about religious issues. This new Fellowship
for Religious Encounter will offer interest
ed students an opportunity to explore the
intersections between religion and their
fields of study.
