# Hey,Mr.DJ?
## 
### 
Picture yourself at a party, dancing with
the guy of your dreams (that is, the one
whom you have been Facebook-stalk
ing for the past month). The dance floor is
full but not too crowded; the lights are dim
but not so dark that you cannot make out
your guy's handsome features. He leans in
for a kiss ~. and just as his lips are about to
touch yours, you get hip-bumped out of the
moment as the girl standing next to you
starts to break it down to "Booty, booty,
booty, booty, rockin' everywhere."
Apparently, Bubba Sparxxx does not
scream "romantic moment" to your dance
partner, and that fleeting sparkle of passion
is lost forever (along with his one ballsy
move for the month). Just like that, you have
returned to the copious ranks of loveless and
sexually frustrated Stanford students.
If this has happened to you, I welcome
you to join in the fight against heartless DJs
who like to crush partygoers? dreams with a
single spin of a record. Just imagine how dif
ferently your night would have turned out if,
instead of "Ms. New Booty," Shakira's se
ductive "Hips Don't Lie" had been next on
the playlist.Then you'll understand why it is
important never to underestimate how
much music matters. On the turntable rests
the key to either happiness or disappoint
ment, and it is the DJ's choice of song that
determines which door you get to open.
There is a time and a place for every song.
(Except for Gunther's "Ding Ding Song,"
which has no excuse.) When you're dancing
with the girls, you can go ahead and rock your
booty wherever you want. Or if you've
dragged your guy friends out, but can't get
them past the junior high "I'm leaning against
the wall because I'm too cool to dance" stage,
nothing will get them moving quicker than a
Numa Numa Yay sing-and-dance-along.
Mood music is a vital part of any emotion
al experience.TVy watching a horror movie on
mute — you'll quickly realize that it is only
natural for the girl to go about her daily busi
ness without it ever crossing her mind that a
murderer could be lurking around the corner.
Without shrill violins screeching in the back
ground, she would have to have an acute case
of paranoia in order to assume that there
could possibly be a man with an axe waiting
behind the old winter coats in her closet.
Just to be on the safe side, since real life
doesn't have an accompanying soundtrack,
perhaps we should all make it a point to
mentally prepare ourselves for the worst
every time we reach for our jackets.
Really, a soundtrack to life that warns un
foreseeable moments (even those less extreme
than axe murderers in the closet) would make
things a lot less stressful. For instance, if your
ex-boyfriend is in the room you are about to
enter, the opening chords of Beethoven's Fifth
Symphony would be a great way for the world

to say: "Girl, you do not want to go in there."
Even if it doesn't serve as an ominous
premonition, music is a great way to get in
vested in the moment. 1 know I'm not the
only one who gets jealous every time I see
those Starbucks commercials where the
guys have their own personal pep bands fol
lowing them around all day. How can you
possibly feel bad about yourself when you're
hearing upbeat fight songs like "Eye of the
Tiger" and "Na Na Hey Hey" all day long?
The right song can turn an arbitrary mo
ment into the perfect moment. Whether you
need inspiration or comfort, whether you
want to create a romantic or motivational at
mosphere, the right song is out there some
where just waiting for you to push "play". So
next time you're at a party, control your own
fate and request that perfect song from the
DJ — then proceed to rock your booty
everywhere as you wait and listen for the be
ginning of your perfect moment.
