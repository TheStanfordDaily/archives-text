# Twenty-one is twenty-fun
## 
### 
I'm decked out in a deep turquoise blazer
1 bought in Bulgaria secondhand for a
dollar, a neon pink tie from the Covered
Bazaar in Istanbul, a blue button-up from a
Haight Ashbury vintage store, a yellow plas
tic lei and a Fez. I'm holding a glass of Lau
ren's special punch, which tastes like cheap
liquor mixed with cheap liquor, with an es
sential plastic tropical umbrella sticking out
of the glass. I don't have straws, so the um
brella pokes me every time 1 drink. It's ab
surd, but that's part of the fun of turning 21
in Berlin.
Everyone I know has made the observa
tion that being in Europe for my 21st birth
day is pointless. Meaningless, in this land
where legal drinking starts at 16 and actual
drinking starts at six. I made vague plans to
walk into the American Embassy at the
stroke of midnight and demand that the am
bassador serve me a beer (or at least pour me
a bit of the Jack he keeps in his desk). But re
ally, the days of high anxiety, of trying to copy
my brother's dorky smile on his old driver's
license (1 never forget his birthday any
more),of scanning the crowd around our tail
gate for undercover fuzz — those times were
over five months ago. Europe made me a
man (you might say in a "Wonder Years" nar
ration voice).
But that's no reason not to party. I figured
it would be a casual, quiet affair — not too
many people, a few rounds of Kings and the
"Roxanne" drinking game. I love the kids
here this quarter, but they're not madman
partiers like last quarter.This quarter people
order water in bars and explain that they
have a Sports paper to write. Last quarter.
Walt and I discussed "Sopranos" and Val
Kilmer's career arc over gin and tonics;
Marie, Stephen. Adrian and I argued about

religion, our minds stoked by cheap absinthe,
until sunrise; and we went out almost every
week to Club Kudorf, which has Black Music
Fridays and Stripper Thursdays.
But when I announced the party, a
strange thing happened — people were ac
tually interested.They were asking me about
it all week. Angel and Nina asked if they
could bring Germans. Even my sprachpart
ner said she could come (though I didn't tell
her until the last minute, partially because 1
wanted to seem disinterested, teasing and
flirtatious, and partially because I was wor
ried she'd say no).
All this interest was new for me. I ve never
actually planned a party before. Last year in
Lambda Nu, there were events like Drunks
giving and the Lake Lag regatta, where my
contribution largely consisted of telling
Hiten to get kegs and telling Roddy, our live
in DJ. to play more 80s music. In Kappa
Sigma, I've dutifully put blue cellophane
over the hallway lights, looked busy hammer
ing things for Luau and suggested we play
more 80s music. But I've never been the Big
Man before. Narcissistic feelings of power
swelled in my proud fat head — I could make
exactly the kind of party 1 always wanted. I
decided that the party would need to be in
credibly fun, distinctively memorable and in
credibly Franich (my surname is an effective

adjective, as well as verb and preposition).
Reasoning that the main room needed
some tacky decoration to offset the classy
artwork my host mom, Irena, hung on the
wall, I put up the Audrey Tautou poster we
got free at the opening of "The Da Vinci
Code" — a movie which would have been
much better if lan McKellen played every
part. 1 also hung up pictures of other people
who share my birthday — among them, lan
McEwan, Mr T, the Notorious BIG, Dante
Alighieri and Plato. Oh, and Battlestar
Galactica's Richard Hatch. I'm pretty stoked
about that one.
My mom had mailed some tropical
themed party favors — those little umbrel
las, napkins with 21 emblazoned in red and
plastic lei (strangely, there were no "Get
Lei'd" witticisms). Irina,being Russian, had a
collection of shot glasses. I layered the sound
track with 80s karaoke ballads (including
three Journey songs and The Outfield's epic
"Your Love"), nostalgia-trip 90s faves
("Closing Time" and Third Eye Blind) and
cartoon themes ("Rescue Rangers" and
"Tale Spin"). I bought Russian vodka, semi
expensive Spanish wine,enough Beck's to fill
the Baltic, and Turkish Raki, which powers
rocket engines and kills kitties.
The party began at eight and my friends
were kind enough to bring presents. Lauren
brought her juice and snacks. Carlos brought
a mini-keg from Munich. Angel brought two
cute brunettes, the yin to my sprachpartner
and her friend's blonde yang. Daisy stuck a
couple of lit matches into a strawberry cake
and got everyone to start singing "Happy
Birthday," but then the matches blew out and
everyone stopped singing halfway through.

Eins! Zwei! Drei!
Tim, imitating "Arrested Develop
ment," got everybody to yell:
"Speech! Speech!" My remarks, in
cluding "I'm cooler for knowing all of
you," indicate that I'm getting cheesy
in my old age. We kept yelling
"Speech!" until everyone had their
say — 1 was toasted in four lan
guages. including cute Brunette Ger
man. beery Mexi-Spanish and
Angel's convincing Middle Eastern

dialect (which he later admitted was
made up). "Speak Asian!" 1 instruct
ed a Filipino friend.This would not be
the last or worst politically incorrect
proclamation that night.
There were all the usual affectations
of a Shitshow, including pictures
of everyone wearing the Fez. The
Power Hour did not segue into a Centu
ry Club, fortunately, but as the hour
turned to 12, a few of us made the in
hindsight-poor decision to migrate to a
bar. We considered Travolta (the sight
of a post-Bing dinner-till-sunrise ses
sion which exists now only in our pic
tures and livers, but not in our memo
ries), but we set on Astro Bar, which was

approximately on the ass end of town.
We planned to stay until 4:30 a.m.,
when the trains start running again.
The flaws of this plan became clear
when Tim and Steph fell asleep on
each other. When we left, the time
was approximately Drunk:3o in the
very early morning, and the first day
of the rest of my life began with me
and Tim serenading the street with a
rousing rendition of Borat's "Throw
the Jew Down the Well." Now you'll
have to excuse me, I need an aspirin
and a confessional.

Lei'd" witticisms). Irina,being Russian, had a
collection of shot glasses. I layered the sound
track with 80s karaoke ballads (including
three Journey songs and The Outfield's epic
"Your Love"), nostalgia-trip 90s faves
("Closing Time" and Third Eye Blind) and
cartoon themes ("Rescue Rangers" and
"Tale Spin"). I bought Russian vodka, semi
expensive Spanish wine,enough Beck's to fill
the Baltic, and Turkish Raki, which powers
rocket engines and kills kitties.
The party began at eight and my friends
were kind enough to bring presents. Lauren
brought her juice and snacks. Carlos brought
a mini-keg from Munich. Angel brought two
cute brunettes, the yin to my sprachpartner
and her friend's blonde yang. Daisy stuck a
couple of lit matches into a strawberry cake
and got everyone to start singing "Happy
Birthday," but then the matches blew out and
everyone stopped singing halfway through.

Tim, imitating "Arrested Develop
ment," got everybody to yell:
"Speech! Speech!" My remarks, in
cluding "I'm cooler for knowing all of
you," indicate that I'm getting cheesy
in my old age. We kept yelling
"Speech!" until everyone had their
say — 1 was toasted in four lan
guages. including cute Brunette Ger
man. beery Mexi-Spanish and
Angel's convincing Middle Eastern

dialect (which he later admitted was
made up). "Speak Asian!" 1 instruct
ed a Filipino friend.This would not be
the last or worst politically incorrect
proclamation that night.
There were all the usual affectations
of a Shitshow, including pictures
of everyone wearing the Fez. The
Power Hour did not segue into a Centu
ry Club, fortunately, but as the hour
turned to 12, a few of us made the in
hindsight-poor decision to migrate to a
bar. We considered Travolta (the sight
of a post-Bing dinner-till-sunrise ses
sion which exists now only in our pic
tures and livers, but not in our memo
ries), but we set on Astro Bar, which was

approximately on the ass end of town.
We planned to stay until 4:30 a.m.,
when the trains start running again.
The flaws of this plan became clear
when Tim and Steph fell asleep on
each other. When we left, the time
was approximately Drunk:3o in the
very early morning, and the first day
of the rest of my life began with me
and Tim serenading the street with a
rousing rendition of Borat's "Throw
the Jew Down the Well." Now you'll
have to excuse me, I need an aspirin
and a confessional.

I'm decked out in a deep turquoise blazer
1 bought in Bulgaria secondhand for a
dollar, a neon pink tie from the Covered
Bazaar in Istanbul, a blue button-up from a
Haight Ashbury vintage store, a yellow plas
tic lei and a Fez. I'm holding a glass of Lau
ren's special punch, which tastes like cheap
liquor mixed with cheap liquor, with an es
sential plastic tropical umbrella sticking out
of the glass. I don't have straws, so the um
brella pokes me every time 1 drink. It's ab
surd, but that's part of the fun of turning 21
in Berlin.
Everyone I know has made the observa
tion that being in Europe for my 21st birth
day is pointless. Meaningless, in this land
where legal drinking starts at 16 and actual
drinking starts at six. I made vague plans to
walk into the American Embassy at the
stroke of midnight and demand that the am
bassador serve me a beer (or at least pour me
a bit of the Jack he keeps in his desk). But re
ally, the days of high anxiety, of trying to copy
my brother's dorky smile on his old driver's
license (1 never forget his birthday any
more),of scanning the crowd around our tail
gate for undercover fuzz — those times were
over five months ago. Europe made me a
man (you might say in a "Wonder Years" nar
ration voice).
But that's no reason not to party. I figured
it would be a casual, quiet affair — not too
many people, a few rounds of Kings and the
"Roxanne" drinking game. I love the kids
here this quarter, but they're not madman
partiers like last quarter.This quarter people
order water in bars and explain that they
have a Sports paper to write. Last quarter.
Walt and I discussed "Sopranos" and Val
Kilmer's career arc over gin and tonics;
Marie, Stephen. Adrian and I argued about

religion, our minds stoked by cheap absinthe,
until sunrise; and we went out almost every
week to Club Kudorf, which has Black Music
Fridays and Stripper Thursdays.
But when I announced the party, a
strange thing happened — people were ac
tually interested.They were asking me about
it all week. Angel and Nina asked if they
could bring Germans. Even my sprachpart
ner said she could come (though I didn't tell
her until the last minute, partially because 1
wanted to seem disinterested, teasing and
flirtatious, and partially because I was wor
ried she'd say no).
All this interest was new for me. I ve never
actually planned a party before. Last year in
Lambda Nu, there were events like Drunks
giving and the Lake Lag regatta, where my
contribution largely consisted of telling
Hiten to get kegs and telling Roddy, our live
in DJ. to play more 80s music. In Kappa
Sigma, I've dutifully put blue cellophane
over the hallway lights, looked busy hammer
ing things for Luau and suggested we play
more 80s music. But I've never been the Big
Man before. Narcissistic feelings of power
swelled in my proud fat head — I could make
exactly the kind of party 1 always wanted. I
decided that the party would need to be in
credibly fun, distinctively memorable and in
credibly Franich (my surname is an effective

adjective, as well as verb and preposition).
Reasoning that the main room needed
some tacky decoration to offset the classy
artwork my host mom, Irena, hung on the
wall, I put up the Audrey Tautou poster we
got free at the opening of "The Da Vinci
Code" — a movie which would have been
much better if lan McKellen played every
part. 1 also hung up pictures of other people
who share my birthday — among them, lan
McEwan, Mr T, the Notorious BIG, Dante
Alighieri and Plato. Oh, and Battlestar
Galactica's Richard Hatch. I'm pretty stoked
about that one.
My mom had mailed some tropical
themed party favors — those little umbrel
las, napkins with 21 emblazoned in red and
plastic lei (strangely, there were no "Get
Lei'd" witticisms). Irina,being Russian, had a
collection of shot glasses. I layered the sound
track with 80s karaoke ballads (including
