Fraudulent publications

Scientific fraud can he widely damaging, and
measures to forestall its occurrence are most de
sirable. IT»e recent example, with reference to
stem cell cloning, marks a sorry episode whose
lessons, it seems, have yet to be fully grasped.
Donald Kennedy spoke at a Stanford
stem-cell symposium on Jan. 10, in his capac
ity as editor in chief of the journal Science,
about two fraudulent papers published
therein which are about to be retracted; a
summary of his views and responses to some
questions appears in the Jan. 25 issue of the
Stanford Report. Kennedy warns that scien
tific fraud is "unpreventable" and hard to de
tect; and offers the comment "None of the
scientists who reviewed the papers and no
journalists working for Science spoke with
sources who suggested fraud." Did a suspi
cion of fraud account for the role of journal
ists and their sources and, if so, was an ex
panded scrutiny of papers claiming signifi
cantly new accomplishments undertaken?

There are a great many experts of cloning
techniques who can be relied on to assess the
data that authors must provide to secure
publication of their papers; what number did
Science actually employ for said purpose?
Subsequent to Kennedy's presentation,
there appeared in The New York Times (Feb.
11) an article with the heading "University
Panel Faults Cloning Co-Author," which re
lates to the same discredited papers; and it is
mentioned here that the co-Author "lobbied
hard" and "without any direct knowledge of
the veracity of the data" for publication of a
paper previously rejected by Science. It is
difficult to comprehend why Kennedy gave
his opinion that the latter individual "did, in
fact, deserve to be on the paper."
Those who are concerned about preserv
ing a high standard of scientific literature
would surely welcome a clearer view of the
manner employed by editorial staffs in seek
ing to achieve the desired objectives.

Article misrepresents the issue of
diversity at the Medical School
My comments in the recent article "Med
School faces diversity complaints" (May 12)
were mishandled. 1 feel my words were taken
out of context and the most negative were se
lected to juxtapose with, what could then be
positioned as, defensive responses from the
administration.
'ITiose of us working on the forefront of
this issue have worked very hard to remove
the "us/them" mentality around this issue
and establish a more collaborative approach
between students and administration. We
take deep pride — both for ourselves and
those we have been working with in the ad
ministration — in the increased willingness
to listen and respond to student's concerns.
The issues around minority retention and
the acculturation of disadvantaged students
are both charged and complex; these have
been challenging times and there are no "quick
fixes." Any progress is dependent on an envi

ronment of safety and trust that supports forth
right discussion, dissent and collaboration.
What are the issues that Tlie Daily might
have highlighted?
1. Stanford Medical's center of excellence
has done a good job providing opportunities for
and mentoring minority students interested in
pursuing "faculty track" careers in medicine.
While this is a good "long-term" strategy, we
need increased recruitment of minority faculty
now — especially African Americans and Na
tive Americans — who are attentive to issues
around acculturation and retention.
2. Stanford Medical needs a much stronger
mentorship program for all students, which
includes greater support for those advisers
disadvantaged students instinctively flock to
ward — folks like Elliot Wolfe, Kuldev Singh
and Denise Johnson.
3. Finally — and here is where The Daily
failed completely in it's handling of this issue —
wc need continued support of an environment
where students,faculty and administra
tors are comfortable stating the prob
lem and engaging in candid, construc
tive dialogue towards a solution.
At this critical time, when the face
of medicine is changing so rapidly.
The Daily had an opportunity to
write an excellent article on this issue
— which is not unique to Stanford
Medical. Such an article would have
investigated the problems of accul-

turation of ALL students into the
world of medicine and how they
acutely present themselves in disad
vantaged students. It would have as
sessed the response at Stanford Med
ical and outlined the current agenda
for addressing this issue — which is
nothing less than a fundamental shift
in the culture of medicine — from
both the students' and administra
tion's viewpoint. Such an article
would have honored all the hard
work that has been invested at Stan
ford Medical —by key faculty and
administrators, by former students
who left the legacy of this work, by
those 1 have shared my five years with

who have invested endless energy in
keeping these issues at the forefront
and most importantly by those class
mates who follow us whose role it will
be to continue this effort.
It is a shame that The Daily chose
a different approach, writing a weak,
outdated article that showed no re
spect for the efforts of so many peo
ple. Nevertheless, this work will con
tinue and it is with heartfelt gratitude
that 1 acknowledge everyone — from
all walks of life and all angles of this
issue — who have invested in and
supported this work.
