## BASEBALL ON BUBBLE FOR 13 STRAIGHT Three games remain in baseball's fight for its postseason life; Even after tough trip to UCLA, Card have won 10 of last 13 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
Things were looking pretty grim for
Stanford baseball a month ago. On
April 23, the Cardinal suffered a dis
heartening 12-3 loss in the rubber
game of their weekend series against
Arizona. Already cellar-dwellers in the
Pac-10 standings, the Cardinal saw
their record in conference play drop to
a dismal 3-9. That mark left them two
games behind the second-to-last place
Wilcats and six games behind Pac-10
leader Oregon State.
And having dropped their fifth con
secutive series, the Cardinal were like
ly wondering whether the bounces
would ever start to fall their way at all.
The team on the field seemed nothing
like the team that had opened its sea
son with a sweep of perennial power
house Cal State Fullerton and re
sounding series victories over Kansas,
defending national champion Texas
and Fresno State.
But since that low point of a month
ago, the Cardinal's fortunes have
changed dramatically.
Stanford has rallied for a 9-6 finish
in the final four Pac-10 series of their
season. The momentum swing began
with solid back-to-back weekend ef
forts against Arizona State and Cali
fornia at Sunken Diamond.
The Cardinal then hit the road for a
three-game set at Washington, and
they made sure to pack their brooms.
Stanford got a complete game shutout
victory from ace Greg Reynolds on
Friday night,and the combination of 24
runs of offense and solid pitching in the
final two games of the series ensured
the Stanford sweep.
Although the Cardinal dropped
two of three to UCLA this past week
end, they have nonetheless managed to
pull themselves from last place in the
Pac-10 into fifth.They finished just one
win shy of a .500 conference record, at

11-13 against Pac-10 opponents.
But even more importantly, Stan
ford has put itself in good position Ip
earn a spot in the NCAA Tourna
ment's 64-team field.
With three games remaining, the
Cardinal have a chance to finish their
2006 campaign with an overall record
identical to last year's 32-23. The
team's record currently stands at 29-23,
so a sweep of Sacramento State on
Wednesday and UC-Davis twice this
weekend would even the score.
Last year, Stanford earned one of 34
at-large invitations to the postseason at
32-23.They received that invitation de
spite finishing sixth in the Pac-10 with a
12-12 conference record.
The appearance marked Stanford's
12th straight in the NCAAs, and was
capped with a dramatic extra-inning
loss to No. 8 Baylor in the Regional
championship match.
That streak remains up in the air as
Stanford wraps up the remainder of its
schedule. If the NCAA Ratings Per
centage Index serves as any indicator,
the Cardinal are sitting squarely on the
bubble for their 13th straight trip to the
postseason.
Stanford currently ranks 40th in the
RPI. That's well within the 64-team
cutoff for selection to Regional tourna
ment play, but take away the 30 slots
automatically awarded to conference
champions, and the math gets a little
dicier.
The best guess here is that a sweep
this weekend will put Stanford base
ball in the postseason. But any mis
steps against this weekend's two lower
ranked opponents could make Selec
tion Day very tense around Sunken
Diamond.
Should the Cardinal advance to the
NCAAs, they would first compete in a
double-elimination round-robin Re
gional against three other squads. The

Senior righty Matt Manship delivers in Stanford's 6-4 win versus Cal on May 7. After nearly 200 innings
in a Stanford uniform, Manship stands at 6-10 with a 3.82 ERA and 1 7 saves. The Card host Pacific
Wednesday before a home-and-home series with UC-Davis ends the season.
