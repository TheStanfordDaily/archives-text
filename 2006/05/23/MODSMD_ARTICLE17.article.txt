## Cardinal women seek NCAA Regional repeat Women second at Pac-10s; Tougher road for young men 
### ISRAEL ROJAS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Finding time to study for finals is always
difficult. It's even more complicated when
you have to constantly travel across the
country like Stanford Track and Field.
Every weekend they leave campus and re
turn days later, missing classes and precious
free time in the process.
This weekend is no different, as the
team prepares for the NCAA Regional
Championships in Provo, Utah. After fin

ishing second at Pac-lOs, the women will
now look to repeat as the champions of the
NCAA West Regional.
Last season, the team sent a small army
to Regionals at the University of Oregon's
Hayward Field. Of the 46 competing Cardi
nal athletes, three walked away with indi
vidual titles.
Senior Michael Robertson won the dis
cus title for Stanford after transferring to
the Farm when Southern Methodist
dropped its men's track program. Robert
son beat out 30 other competitors for the
title, throwing the discus 201 feet. Robert
son also owns the school record in the
event, with a distance of 202-5 feet at last
year's NCAA Championships.
Also a winner last year, senior Sara Bei

dominated the 5,0(X) meter race, opening
up a lead of about 80 meters late in the race.
She finished in 16:22.41 to qualify for the
national championships.
Then-sophomore Janice Davis brought
home the Card's third individual title with
a win in the 100 meter dash. She took the
lead midway through the race and held on
with a time of 11.61 seconds.
The Cardinal women closed out the
competition with a victory in the 1,600
meter relay. Then-senior Chinny Offor,
then-sophomore Ashley Freeman, then
junior Nashonme Johnson and Davis post
ed a 3:34.73 â€” good enough for second all
time in the school's history.
These performances led the Stanford
women to the regional title, and qualified

22 athletes for the national meet. This year,
the Cardinal contingent at Regionals will
be about a third smaller, making a repeat of
last year's success a challenge.
The men's team, in particular, has lost
some major players. Stanford has no re
placement for Robertson, and the distance
duo of Ryan Hall and lan Dobson, runners
who placed well in multiple events.
The women were not hurt as much by
graduation, with Davis, last year's 100-
meter champ, still on the squad. Although
she has had a quiet season and has strug
gled with injuries, Davis has run well
enough to qualify for Regionals once again
this year.

While the Stanford men, shown beating Washington, await their final races next week, the women are heading to NCAAs for the first time in three
years. The No. 15 Cardinal were surprised to make the 12-team Championships but plan to make the most of the opportunity.
