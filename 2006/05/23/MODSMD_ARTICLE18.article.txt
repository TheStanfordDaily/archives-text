## Gators go down, Card in finals Three years later, Stanford avenges NCAA loss to Florida, Miami beckons in noon Final 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
Women's tennis had a score to settle with the
Florida Gators, and they were determined to do
it in style.
It didn't hurt that there was a contingent of
spirited alums of the top-ranked Cardinal on
hand lending moral support for the Stanford ef
fort. Holding signs that read "Gator Hater" and
"Gators taste like chicken" and dangling inflat
able alligator rafts wearing Stanford tennis T
shirts from the ends of fishing poles, the rowdy
members of Stanford's squads of yore heckled
No. 4 Florida (25-2) relentlessly.
They let it be known that, although they were
not able to compete in this three-years-in-the
waiting rematch, they were going to do their part
to help Stanford (29-0) avenge its last loss to the
Gators and earn a spot in the national champi
onship match tomorrow.
The props and posters may have helped, but it
was Stanford's stellar play that led the Card to a
4-0 semifinal victory that looked almost easy.
"We got blitzed," Florida Coach Roland
Thonqvist said."No question about it. Give Stan
ford all the credit in the world. We lost to a very,
very good Stanford team today.They played phe
nomenal tennis and put us on our heels."
Meeting for the first time since a Florida vic
tory in the 2003 NCAA finals the Gators' home
court, the Cardinal were eager to dominate in
yesterday's NCAA semifinal match. Although
only the seniors on the team actually experi
enced the devastating 4-3 loss of three years ago,
the match is legendary andfrequently referred to
by the teanj in conversation. Tlien, as now, Stan
ford was the two-time defending national cham
pion. But this time around, the Cardinal had the
advantage of playing at home â€” where they
haven't lost since Feb. 27,1999 and not in front of
a sellout crowd of Florida fans.
"I'd be lying if I said I didn't think about that,"
senior Alice Barnes said of the championship
loss in 2003. "It's almost an entirely different
team, but I wanted to beat Florida just once be
fore I graduated."
The match got off to a great start with doubles.
Sophomore Lejla Hodzic and freshman Jessica
Nguyen breezed past the Gators on court three,
nabbing an 8-2 victory. The No. 2 duo of senior
Amber Liu and sophomore Celia Durkin, which
had struggled in the round of 16 and quarterfinal
matches,finally found its groove and bageled their
opponents 8-0, to clinch the doubles point.
"We were very solid in doubles and that set
the tone for the whole match," Coach Lele
Forood said.
Fueled by the enthusiastic crowd, the Cardi
nal carried the doubles momentum into singles
and jumped to early leads on courts one through
five. Durkin faced a 0-3 deficit on court six at the
start, but battled back to take the first set 6-4, and
then quickly blanked Florida's Alex Liles 6-0 to
be the first to finish singles, earning Stanford its
second dual-match point of the day.
Barnes was the next to finish, with a smooth 6-
2,6-3 win over ninth-ranked Diana Srebrovic on
the second court, llirning to the crowd and
pumping her fist, Barnes got the fans on their feet
as they turned their eyes to court three where
junior Theresa Logar was up 5-3 in the second set
and seemed the closest to securing the match for
the Card.
However, it was sophomore Whitney Deason
on court five who would seal the deal. Up 4-3 in
the second set when Barnes won her match, Dea
son quickly powered through the next two games
to defeat Nina Suvak,6-2,6-3.
"Winning the NCAA title is our
goal," Deason said. "Our individual
matches are a building block. We
have faith in each other. That makes
it easier to relax when you are play
ing."
Barnes agreed.
"When you are the defending
champion, how can you have any
other goals?" she asked. "That is
something we set our sights on.
Anything less than a win tomorrow
is a disappointment."
Yesterday's match was between
the two preeminent teams in
women's college tennis. Since 1986,
at least one of these teams has been
in every NCAA Final.
That streak continues today,
with Stanford facing seventh
ranked Miami in the national final
at noon.
"We are so pumped right now,"
senior Joanna Kao said. "We saw
Miami play USC in the singles
matches, and they looked good. But
we want this so badly and are
ready."
