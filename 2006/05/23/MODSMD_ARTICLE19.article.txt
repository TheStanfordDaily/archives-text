# WOMEN'S CREW
## Rowers return to NCAAs 
### JOHN CHOCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When Stanford's open-weight
women return as a full fleet to the
NCAA Division I Women's Rowing
Championships this week, their six days
in the postseason will more than make
up for their three-year absence from the
competition. The team invitation, which
caught the No. 15 Cardinal by surprise
last week, is Stanford's first since 2003
and third in the ten-year history of the
event.The women depart today for West
Windsor, N.J., where racing begins Fri
day morning.
"We are really excited," Coach
Aimee Baker said of Stanford's return
to the national championships. "(We
are] confident in having been before,
but very respectful of both the event it
self and the level of competition we

will face."
Baker's squad is one of only twelve
teams to receive NCAA team berths
this year. Stanford's varsity eight won an
at-large bid to last year's national regat
ta, but the entire team — the varsity
eight, second varsity eight and varsity
four — made it a goal to return en
masse in 2(X)6.
"After only having an eight go last
year, it's awesome to have the whole
team this year," senior co-captain Sam
Magee said.
Their new goal is to improve on pre
vious team finishes. The Cardinal fin
ished l()th in 2002 and ninth in 2003, and
Stanford returns a handful of seniors
and first-year graduate students who re
member the previous championship ap
pearances and their own rookie jitters.
"I remember being so nervous
when I was a freshman, and having
the older, more experienced girls
help focus my anxious energy," first
year graduate student Mario Dressi
gacker said."l hope that I can do the
same for the new girls."
Co-captain and co-terminal stu
dent Susan Beville hopes to pass on
a lesson learned in her 2003 sopho
more season, when Stanford's varsi
ty eight took third place at the
NCAA regatta.
"We learned that year how far
heart can take you," Beville said.
"No one expected Stanford to be
fast that year, and we raced every
race like we were out to prove some
thing. That's something that we have
tried to convey to this year's team —
we've talked a lot about believing in
ourselves no matter who is in the
lane next to us."
"NCAAs can be this scary, intim
idating race," Magee said. "The level
of competition is obviously higher,
but can sometimes catch you off
guard."

Stanford's 26-athlete contingent
will include six from last year's
eight, three of the 2003 bronze
medalists, and 11 freshmen.
"The experience gained will be
huge for future years," Baker said.
Stanford's seasoned seniors and
fledgling freshmen alike will have to
square away academic obligations
— something that many of their
competitors have long since done.
"A lot of schools that are compet
ing are already finished with the
school year," Baker said. "This
takes extra work on our part. The
additional challenge will be the time
zone change, as the heats begin on
Friday at 8:00 a.m., which is 5:00 a.m.
PST."
But rising early — and to the
challenge — are old hat for the
Card.
"These extra days of practice for
NCAAs are really rewarding as we
prepare to face the highest level of
collegiate competition," Baker said.
"Everyone at NCAAs is tough and
we are preparing for this level."
"There's a lot of excited energy
on our team right now." Beville said.
"The season has had a few ups and
downs, and we're glad that we get
another chance to show how fast we
can go."
