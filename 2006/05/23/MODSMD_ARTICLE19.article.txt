# WOMEN'S CREW
## Rowers return to NCAAs 
### JOHN CHOCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When Stanford's open-weight
women return as a full fleet to the
NCAA Division I Women's Rowing
Championships this week, their six days
in the postseason will more than make
up for their three-year absence from the
competition. The team invitation, which
caught the No. 15 Cardinal by surprise
last week, is Stanford's first since 2003
and third in the ten-year history of the
event.The women depart today for West
Windsor, N.J., where racing begins Fri
day morning.
"We are really excited," Coach
Aimee Baker said of Stanford's return
to the national championships. "(We
are] confident in having been before,
but very respectful of both the event it
self and the level of competition we

will face."
Baker's squad is one of only twelve
teams to receive NCAA team berths
this year. Stanford's varsity eight won an
at-large bid to last year's national regat
ta, but the entire team — the varsity
eight, second varsity eight and varsity
four — made it a goal to return en
masse in 2(X)6.
"After only having an eight go last
year, it's awesome to have the whole
team this year," senior co-captain Sam
Magee said.
Their new goal is to improve on pre
vious team finishes. The Cardinal fin
ished l()th in 2002 and ninth in 2003, and
Stanford returns a handful of seniors
and first-year graduate students who re
member the previous championship ap
pearances and their own rookie jitters.
