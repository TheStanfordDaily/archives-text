# $2.5M donor claims ties to Stanfords
## University avoids association with same-named businessman 
### RYANN BLACKSHERE 
Large donations are nothing new, but a recent gift
made by a businessman claiming relation to Lcland and
Jane Stanford has raised eyebrows within the adminis
tration.
Houston businessman R.Allen Stanford recently do
nated $2.5 million dollars to restore the home of Leland
Stanford Sr. Allen Stanford claims in his company maga
zine to be a relative of the University-founding couple,
and that he donated the money to help with the upkeep
of the residence of the governor who was "closely relat
ed" to his great-great-great-grandfather.
The Stanford Mansion, located in Sacramento, is
considered a state park and not affiliated with the Uni
versity.
Incidentally, the University denies any relation be
tween Allen Stanford and Leland. Susan Weinstein, di
rector of business development and University privacy
officer, said in an interview with The Daily that she con
sulted with University Archivist Maggie Campbell about
Allen Stanford's relation to the founders.
"1 am not aware of any genealogical relationship be
tween Allen Stanford, founder of Stanford Financial and
Leland Stanford," Weinstein — the official guardian of
the usage of the University's name — said. "Of course,
this does not mean that there is not a distant relationship
— but it does not show up in any of our records."
Stanford is the founder and chairman of the Stanford
Financial Group, an investment group. Based in Hous
ton, the company's main business, an offshore bank, was
established and later moved to the Caribbean island of
Antigua. In addition. Allen Stanford owns Caribbean
Sun Airlines as well as several financial management
companies in Antigua and Barbuda.
In 1999, Stanford Financial tried to take over an An
tiguan company that regulated offshore business on the
island, sparking the curiosity of LIS. investigators. State
Department memos from the time described the move
as a "power grab." Last year, the group acquired Charles
Schwab & Co.'s Washington research team, which has
since been renamed the Stanford Washington Research
Group.
Stanford has donated more than $2 million to U.S. po
litical candidates and parties in the last six years, al
though his contribution to the former governor's man
sion exceeds that amount by half a million dollars.
The gift can be attributed to family ties, reports say.
According to Bloomberg, Stanford Financial's maga
zine, published in 2001, featured a cover photo of Allen
Stanford with his father and then-California Gov. Gray
Davis and quotes Allen Stanford as saying his great
great-great-grandfather was "closely related" to Leland
Stanford's father. A 2004 promotional video showed
Allen Stanford saying "I am proud to say that we have
been a major financial supporter for the restoration of
the Leland Stanford Mansion in Sacramento, helping to
preserve an important piece of California, and Stanford
family history."
The Stanford Financial Group has denied using the
Stanford name to promote the company.
