# Basketball better without BCS
## At least NBA seeding is better than football's 
### 
To my greatest surprise, this
year's NBA playoffs have
truly proved an exciting ad
venture.
Three of this season's four con
ference semis came down to the sev
enth and deciding game. Eight of 26
second-round games were decided
by the final basket, to go along with
three overtime matches. Underdog
fans throughout the nation were
thrilled when six lower-seed teams
came close to pulling a George
Mason in the first round.
Civil war broke out within Texas
as the Mavericks bested the Spurs
for a one-way ticket to the Western
Conference Finals. Los Angeles for
once became Clipper Town, as the
bandwagon celebrities could be
spotted wearing red underneath the
nine purple and gold championship
banners hanging from the Staples
Center's rafters.
The awesome matchups we wit

nessed this year were all thanks to
the luck of the much-criticized seed
ing system. And while I'd love to see
the abolition of the division system
that guarantees the top three seeds
in each conference to the three divi
sion champions, at least a system as
terrible as the BCS doesn't control
the NBA's postseason.
But the question seems just too
tantalizing: what if the BCS did in
fact control the NBA playoffs?
First we'd begin with the Staples
Center Bowl presented by Office
Depot, featuring the No. 9 Clippers
facing the No. 10 Lakers for SoCal
bragging rights. Kobe vs. Elton.
Nicholson vs. Crystal. History vs.
youth. After leading by twenty in
the third quarter, the Lakers still
find a way to screw things up and
break my heart in the process. Look
for me up in the nosebleed section
subtly swapping my No. 8 jersey for
a red No. 12. The Clip-Joint takes
the bowl, 109-100.
Next would be the Southwest
Bowl presented by Cactus Cooler.
No. 4 Phoenix battles Denver, who

earned an automatic bowl bid for
winning the Northwest Division.
Anybody remember Utah pound
ing a Walt Harris-coached Pitts
burgh squad in the 2005 Fiesta
Bowl? Yeah, the Panthers sneaked
into the BCS by winning the Big
East with an 8-3 record and earned
an "overrated" chant while getting
humiliated by Alex Smith's Utes.
Nash scores 40 as the Suns take the
game, 124-72.
Next on the BCS docket is the
Hoosier Bowl, emanating from
none other than the RCA Dome in
Indianapolis. Shaquille O'Neal and
Dwayne Wade lead No. 5 Miami
against Leßron's No. 6 Cleveland.
Shaq injures his ankle in the first pe
riod, allowing Leßron to cement his
name, 90-76 over the Heat.
Despite the Mavericks' superior
record and strength of schedule, the
BCS snubs No. 3 Dallas to ensure a
larger national television audience
(a la Notre Dame getting into the
2006Tostitos Bowl over Oregon).
And finally comes the National
Championship game, the AT&T-

Tostitos Bowl presented by CITI.
Top-ranked Detroit challenges de
fending champion No. 2 San Anto
nio. After a week of ESPN coverage
proclaiming Detroit the greatest
team in the NBAs history, the Pis
tons find themselves down by three
with 12 seconds left. Chauncey
Billups eats up ten seconds before
finally throwing up the Hail Mary
three-pointer, which misses by a
mile, giving the Spurs the 2006 NBA
title. The city of Detroit is dumb
founded, and robberies cease to
take place for an entire week.
Fortunately, the BCS does not
dictate all forms of life.

Freshman Atulrew Lomeli (alomeli@
stanford.edu) can't help getting excited
at the prospect of a BCS-based GPA
system at Stanford. Ehh, who is he kid
ding? The techies would just get more
credit for strength of schedule
