# Honor Code blocks new modes of cheating
## iPods, other gadgets tip cheating at peer institutions 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
Since 1920. the Honor Code has held Stan
ford students to an elevated standard of aca
demic honesty. But a recent trend of cheating
using technology has placed academic dis
honesty back in the national spotlight.
A recent article in The New York Times
reported a jump in high-tech cheating
methods among college students. Students
at schools such as UCLA and Pepperdine
were caught cheating by, among other
things, dictating their notes onto their iPods
and listening to the recording during exams.
Faculty and administrators say such high
tech cheating is not pervasive at Stanford.
"It's really up to the students to let us
know if someone is cheating because
we're not there in the room," said "Intro
duction to Psychology" teaching assistant
Courtney Bonam, a graduate student. "As
far as I can tell, [cheating on exams does
n't seem to be that common."

According to Bonam, plagiarism is a
more common problem than cheating on
exams. Many students also said they feel
like cheating is not as big of a problem at
Stanford as it is at other universities.
"Cheating is not very common here,"
said Gwen Luca, a freshman. "There are
people who slack off, but they don't cheat. It
isn't as acceptable as it was in high school."
Rick Yuen, the judicial officer for the
Office of Judicial Affairs, asserted his
view that Stanford is on par with other
schools in terms of "breaches of academ
ic integrity." This idea is based on annual
student surveys that are conducted across
the country, he said.
The Office of Judicial Affairs recom
mends that faculty tell students to keep all
electronic devices in their backpacks dur
ing exams to eliminate temptation of high
tech skullduggery, hut problems still arise.
Cheating — at least incidences that are
reported — is fairly rare at Stanford. Ac
cording to a recent report by the Judicial Af
fairs Office,between Jan. 1 and April 3 of this
year there were only seven findings of "Giv
ing/ Receiving unpermitted aid." Many of
these transgressions, according to Yuen, oc

curred during in-class examinations. All
were detected and reported by students. But
still, these seven cases represent half of the
14 total Honor Code violations and more
than one-third of the 18 total cases seen by
the Judicial Affairs Office.
"As a part of the Honor Code, students have
a responsibility in the exam room to do some
thing [about perceived cheating]" Yuen said.
Discovered cases are processed by the
Judicial Affairs Office, students next pro
ceed to face a board of their peers. If a stu
dent is found responsible for an Honor
Code violation by the board — either by a
unanimous 6-0 or near-unanimous 5-1 vote
— they are subject to disciplinary action.
A typical sanction for a first-time viola
tion of the Honor Code is a one-quarter
suspension and 40 hours of community
service. Second violations can receive a
one-year suspension and a third violation
of the Honor Code can result in expulsion.
Administrators say that the Honor Code
aims to foster an environment of mutual trust,
rather than deter those bent on cheating.
"The Honor Code doesn't necessarily
prevent people from cheating more," said
Bonam. "There's the issue of the adminis

tration showing that they trust the students
to not cheat. You lose that if you have proc
tors. It's an issue of what's more important."
Many other schools are taking meas
ures such as banning electronic devices
from testing rooms, installing monitoring
software on students' computers and in
creasing proctoring efforts. Similar re
forms are unlikely at Stanford.
"It'd be difficult to uniformly disallow
phones or computers from the exam
room," Yuen said. "Students should resist
temptations to cheat or be perceived to
be cheating by keeping all disallowed and
unnecessary books, notes and electronics
packed away. As for disallowing all elec
tronic items in the exam room, here isn't a
movement afoot to do so."
However, "The Law School does turn off
their wireless Internet during exams," he
added.
In addition. Yuen believes that teach
ing assistants and faculty members would
not be proctoring tests anytime soon
under Stanford's Honor Code policy..
"The Honor Code is here to stay," he
said. "It's a good policy and a strong
framework for us to work in."
