### ADA YEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
/ This year, the Friends
' of The Stanford Daily, the
newspaper's alumni organiza-

tion, awarded an unprecedented
seven scholarships to reporters

and staff. In addition, two students
nahhed scholarship internships at
The San Jose Mercury News and
i The Wall Street Journal,

"This was a record
turnout year as far as appli
cations go," said Editor in
Chief Camille Ricketts, a

senior, of the five Friends scholarships,
which are offered annually and funded
by former staffers. "It's great for The
Daily, because it means a lot of people
are thinking about pursuing journalism
as a career."
"The number of applications varies
from year to year," said Christy Wise,
the Friends scholarship coordinator,
who also makes the $1,5(K) Newton E.
and Nancy B. Wise Award possible. "It
has to do with many factors, including
the enthusiasm created by the leader
ship and how many people are planning

to go on to do journalism."
The strength of the applicant pool
led judges for both the Wise Stanford
Daily Award and the $1,000 Julius Ja
cobs Friends of the Stanford Daily
Award to give honorable mentions for
the first time ever. Junior Sean Howell
and senior Katie Bearman won the
Wise awards, and managing editor of
news, sophomore Patrick Fitzgerald,
won the Jacobs award. News desk edi
tor Nick Parker, a sophomore, received
honorable mention for the Wise, and
junior Joseph Bergen, managing editor
of graphics for The Daily, received hon
orable mention for the Jacobs.
"The intent in creating the Friends
was to create a 'rainy day fund," to
which The Daily contributes," Wise
said. "And there have been times when
The Daily has had to rely on the
Friends, and when the fund has been
critical and important."
According to Wise, the Friends later
expanded to offer workshops, seminars
and other avenues through which alum
ni could connect with current Daily
staff members. The Friends established
the Wise and Jacob awards, followed by
the $6,000 Harry Press Stanford
Daily Award, given to junior An
drew Leifer, a technology and politi
cal columnist, and senior Elizabeth
Aguilar, a sports desk editor. Later,
the $2,000 George Caulfield Stan
ford Daily Award was created, which
went to managing editor of sports,
Daniel Novinson, a sophomore. Fi
nally, The San Jose Mercury News
Internship, also supported by the
Friends, was awarded to freshman
James Hohmann.a news desk editor,
and was created by former Daily
business manager Scott Dorfman.
Though each award has a differ
ent emphasis, most awardees will be
using their scholarships to hold them
through the summer as they pursue
internships in journalism.
Hohmann, who received the Mer
cury News internship, has jump-start -

Ed his internship early with a report on
a recent triple homicide."! thought it
• would be a great opportunity to sharp
en my journalistic talent at a top
ranked national level newspaper."
Similarly, the Wise Award can be
used toward an internship in a small
to-medium sized community paper.
"The idea is that it would allow
someone to supplement their in
come," Wise said. "Otherwise, they
might have to do something outside
journalism that pays more."
Last fall. Ricketts was awarded
the Daniel Pearl Memorial Intern
ship, through which she will work at
iTie Wall Street Journal's London
Bureau this summer. The Daniel
Pearl is not awarded by the Friends,
but by the Daniel Pearl Memorial
Fund.The award is administered by
the Stanford Communication De
partment and The Wall Street Jour
nal. which judge applicants based
on their embodiment of the ideals
of Pearl —an alumni and journalist
who was killed in Pakistan four
years ago.
