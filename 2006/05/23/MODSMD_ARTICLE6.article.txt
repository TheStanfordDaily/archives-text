# CONSTRUCTION
## Barnum work underway 
### CHRISTOPHER LIN STAFF WRITER 
Perhaps even harder to miss than the on
going Munger construction efforts in the
middle of campus, the renovation of the new
Barnum Center near the clock tower con
tinues to make progress despite recent rain.
Formerly used for administrative of
fices for the Career Development Center,
the Barnum Center building was closed
off for construction in the fall of 2005 by
the Stanford School of Education, lite
impetus for construction came from a
generous $3 million donation by Stanford
alumni Bill Barnum, Class of 1976, and
Donnalisa Barnum, Class of 1981.
"One primary goal is to complete the
seismic reinforcement of this historic un
reinforced masonry (URM) building â€”
one of the very last URMs on campus that
has not yet been reinforced," Project
Manager Regina Coony explained. "The
other goal is to restore this lovely building
to its original design."
When current construction is finished,
the School of Education plans to unveil the
new Barnum Family Center for School
and Community Partnerships. The facility
will house programs for the school, includ-

ing the John W. Gardner Center for Youth
and School Redesign Programs. Ilie con
struction will also add two courtyards and
replace a building on the east side of the
site that burned down in 2001 with a new
two-story building for additional space for
offices and conference rooms.
ITie Barnum Center originally consist
ed of two separate buildings that were
constructed in 1913 to house the campus
bookstore, candy store, shoe repair shop
and YMCA. iiie two buildings were
joined together in 1929. when the alley
between them was filled in to create an
expansion for the bookstore, and the en
tire structure was converted into an ad
ministration building for the Career Plan
ning & Placement Center in 1967.The site
fell into disrepair in 2001. when a fire
burned down a small building added in
1984.rendering the facility uninhabitable.
Ihe Department of Project Management
says that it has not received any complaints
about the daily din causcd by the construction.
"We have kept the community around
us informed on the construction progress
and have not received any complaints,"
Coony said. "The School of Education
folks in Cubberley realize that this is a
project that will be theirs to enjoy, so they

appear to be weathering the construction
noise without complaint."
However, some students who take classes
nearby have found the construction bother
some while attempting to pay attention in class.
Freshman Adam Klotz, who has class
every Monday and Wednesday in Cub
berley, said constniction noise is perva
sive everywhere around campus.
"My IHUM section finds the construc
tion noises very distracting." he said. "We
often have to close the windows because of

the buzz of the machinery, which makes it re
ally hard to concentrate since the room be
comes very hot. It's always a choice between
having to withstand the noise and having to
withstand the heat, and everyone finds it
harder to pay attention no matter what.
The annoyance of construction may
not bother students much longer.The De
partment of Project Management report
ed that the construction remains on
schedule and is slated to be finished at the
end of August.
