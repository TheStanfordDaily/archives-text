# Graduate Life
## The 						best graduate speeches part two 
### 
Getting selected to be a commencement
speaker is perhaps the most competitive
endeavor in the world.Thousands of com
mencement speeches are given every year across
the United States by the most successful individ
uals in every walk of life, and all of them aspire to
be in a "Top Three Best Commencement Speech
es" list, like mine.
Where else would you see presidents compet
ing with Hollywood comedians for the top spot,
first ladies trying to one-up one another, writers
clashing with librarians, sport stars confronting
news analysts, retired CEOs fighting with entre
preneurs, rock stars vying with peace activists?
It's not an easy venture, either, as audiences
vary from speech to speech. While there are ar
dent admirers gladly gulping every- drop of wis
dom (or snake oil), there are also uninterested lis
teners — students merely looking forward to the
booze after graduation, friends planning the rest
of their stays in San Francisco with their travel
guides and non-English-speaking relatives obli
gated to sit through the ceremony.
How intimidating would it be to stand in front
of an audience of thousands and relay lessons of
life through humor, clever anecdotes and
quotes — and still deliver a speech that impacts
young people who think they know everything
already? I guess 1 would have psyched out Var
tan Gregorian already.
The result of such high expectations is that
more often than not, these speeches tend to be
very intelligent and moving. (1 should probably
write a book, titled "Everything I Need to Learn,
I Learned in Commencement Speeches.") More
over. these speeches have their advocates, who
go ballistic when they don't see their personal
pet's speech in top three lists. So they, in stages
varying from mildly unhappy to infuriated, send
out emails to columnists who don't include their
favorites. 1 am dutifully noting some readers'
picks in this list. 1 thank those who sent me com
ments, and I am sorry that I couldn't accommo
date everyone. The speeches are ranked in order
of intensity of the angry emails I received.
3. Barbara Bush,
June 1,1990,
Wellesley College, Mass.:
Many Wellesley students protested the
choice, noting that her only achievement was to
marry a future president. She answered her crit
ics through a very telling metaphor. Bush began
her speech by telling a Robert Fulghum story in
which a young pastor is puzzled by a girl who
wanted to play the mermaid in a game of "Gi
ants, Wizards and Dwarfs." The girl. Bush notes,
refused to give up on either her identity or the
game. The first lady comes back to the story at
the end of speech. It was said earlier that the
winner of the Wellesley hoop race would be the
first to get married; at the time of Bush's speech,
it was said that the winner would be the first to
become a CEO. Bush commented that "Both of
those stereotypes show too little tolerance for
those who want to know where the mermaids
stand. So I want to offer a new legend: The win
ner of the hoop race will be the first to realize
her dream — not society's dreams — but her
own personal dream."
2. Salman Rushdie,
May 25,19%,
Bard College, N.Y.:
Not unlike his novels, this speech is filled with
Rushdie's trademark wit and quirkiness, clut
tered with references to incomprehensible an
cient literature and interesting personal anec
dotes. Rushdie eventually delivers his punch
line: "Do not bow your heads. Do not know your
place. Defy the gods."
1. Conan O* Brien,
June 7,2000,
Harvard University, Mass.:
Comic genius O'Brien gave what might be
classified as one of the funniest commencement
speeches in history. While it is impossible to re
enact, a mere reading of the speech is enough to
bring tears of laughter. He made fun of Harvard
("Let me assure you that you never really leave
Harvard. The Harvard fundraising committee
will be on your ass until the day you die") and a
lifetime of expected perfection in all you do to
avoid the"And you went to Harvard?" insult.
Reciting a succession of failures in his life, he
wished the graduates "the bad as well as the
good."
