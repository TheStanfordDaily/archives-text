## ROBOMENO REMOBILIZES WORKING MEMORY Pair of education grad students work with junior high school to improve memory

I'm going to give you a sequence of numbers.

(Congratulations, you've just exercised your
working memory.
"'Working memory is the ability to focus on
important information and manipulate it to solve
complex problems," says Alicia Alonso, research
associate and lecturer at the School of Education.
"If you're listening to a professor talk, you need
to be able to pick out key facts and use them
later."
Alonso recently coordinated logistics for a
graduate student designed research project using
computer learning programs to increase working
memory. Principal contributors Kun Yuan and Jeff
Steedle, graduate students in psychological studies
in education, met with students at local Los Altos
Junior High School for their study.
"I'm most excited about the potential to im
prove students' learning capacity through the ap
plication of technology," said Yuan of the project,
which is largely her brainchild and will serve as the
basis for her dissertation.
For five weeks, middle school students im
mersed themselves in training sessions with a
Swedish computer program by CogMed called
RoboMemo, which specializes in improving work
ing memory. Common exercises focused on re
membering spatial, visual and alphanumeric mes
sages, like memorizing and reversing lists of num
bers. A control group completed science lessons
and worked with an easier version of RoboMemo.
Diagnostic tests taken before and after training

catalogued changes in the students' abilities.
Steedle, along with Yuan and other graduate
students, was there every morning to serve as a
computerized cognitive training coach. After
studying graphs of each student's performance, he
encouraged and helped them set goals for im
provement.
" Hie computer program increases in difficulty
with the students' performance," Steedle says."It
constantly pushes the limits of their working mem
ory, which can be tiring, boring and frustrating.
That's why you need coaches."
Yuan spent a significant amount of her time co
ordinating the efforts of student computer training
coaches.
"1 felt very happy when 1 saw coaching strate
gies motivate those students to work very hard in
the training and make steady progress," Yuan says.
The study found significant improvement in
working memory for students who completed the
training. Students who had undergone the training
were best at tests of working memory resembling
RoboMemo exercises. Tests of science learning
ability and fluid intelligence, however, showed lit
tle significant difference between the groups.
"Computerized cognitive training effectively
improved regular students' short-term memory
and ability to control cognitive tasks in a school
setting," Yuan says."Further studies are warranted
to examine the training's impact on students' fluid
intelligence and science achievement."
This project was funded by a grant from the Wal
lenberg Global Learning Network, a project in

tended to foster collaboration between re
searchers at Stanford and researchers in Sweden.
Past studies in Sweden had shown that
RoboMemo could help students with ADHD im
prove their working memory in a one-on-one set
ting. This study expanded on those findings by
measuring the program's effectiveness with "nor
mal" kids in a school setting.
"The idea is that a lot of schools are taking time
out from teaching to do test preparation," Alonso
says. "We are trying to find ways to help kids get
more out of their learning so that they can spend
less time on test preparation."
Future research will continue to explore the na
ture of working memory and potential methods for
its improvement, Alonso says.
For Yuan, this experiment was just the begin
ning. The study will be the focus of her dissertation,
so she will spend the upcoming weeks analyzing
data and exploring ways to measure working mem
ory.
Yuan, Steedle and Alonso are all members of the
Stanford Education Assessment Laboratory,
which conducts research on learning in the sci
ences under Education Prof. Richard Shavelson.
Shavelson's assistance as a research coordinator
and as an advisor has meant a great deal to both
Steedle and Yuan.
"It's a great, great learning opportunity for me
to work with him as research assistant and teaching
assistant," Yuan says."I also enjoy working with
other people in our group. They are very support
ive to me all the time."
