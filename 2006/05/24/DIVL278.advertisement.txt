The Fourth Annual Oksenberg Lecture:
U.S. — China Relations: Where Do We Stand? Where Are We Going?
featuring
The Honorable Brent Scowcroft
Former National Security Adviser to Presidents Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush
5:15 p.m.
Thursday, June 1, 2006
Bechtel Conference Center
Encina Hall, 616 Serra Street, Stanford University Campus
Free and open to the public.
General Scowcroft's twenty-nine-year military career began with graduation from West Point and concluded
at the rank of Lieutenant General following service as the Deputy National Security Advisor.
Out of uniform, he continued in a public policy capacity by serving on the President's Advisory Committee
on Arms Control and the Commission on Strategic Forces. He was also one of the key members of the
President's Special Review Board, also known as the Tower Commission. The Tower Commission,
appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986, was not only critical of the Reagan White House, it also
brought to light the direct connection between the Reagan Administration and Doth Iran and the
Nicaraguan Contras.
The Oksenberg Lecture honors the legacy of Professor Michel Oksenberg (1938-2001) longtime member of
Shorenstein APARC, senior fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, and an authority
on China. Professor Oksenberg was consistently outspoken about the need for the United States to engage
with Asia in a more considered manner.
