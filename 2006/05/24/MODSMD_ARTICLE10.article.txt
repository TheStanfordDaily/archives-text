Scandal and mismanagement have de
layed Yucca Mountain since the pro
ject's conception. Its focus has centered
around the validity of the scientific data un
derlying the project.
"Scientific data that is supposed to be the
basis for the license to open has been compro
mised to the point that you can't trust what
the DOE says," argued David Cherry, the
press secretary for Rep. Shelley Berkley (D-
Nev.).
One Yucca Mountain project employee
and visitor at the tour strongly disputed the
notion that scientists at the site have cut any
corners.
"They have some of the smartest people in
the world working on this project, and they
are not lying about what they see," said Hal
Downey.
The group walked several hundred yards
on planks into the tunnel and turned right
into what's called Alcove T\vo for a briefing
about rock samples from Los Alamos Nation
al Laboratory geologist Brian Dozier.
"We have done all the modeling and have
a firm grasp on how it will all work," he said.

Multiple signs on the road and at the tun
nel entrance proclaim: "1,960,471 total man
hours without a lost-time injury."
The group was then driven to the other en
trance of the U-shaped tunnel to see the
Yucca Mucker — the 720-ton, 460-foot long
tunnel boring machine that cut through the
mountain at a rate of 18 feet per hour.
From here, the crowd was driven to the
crest of the mountain. At the windswept
ridge, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geol
ogist David Bush assured the crowd that
special geological characteristics make
Yucca Mountain a superior site to hold the
waste.
Yucca Mountain sits amidst three earth
quake faults. Some argue that it would he
foolish to put toxic waste a thousand feet into
a mountain that could rupture with a volcano
or an earthquake sometime in the next mil
lion years.
After being prodded a little. Bush acknowl
edged that much remains unknown about the
geological formation of the mountain.
"We're still trying to figure out the active
faults," Bush said."For the underground envi

ronment, we want to know where the faults
are. They're not going to put a canister of nu
clear waste on a fault."
The Department of Energy estimates that
the chance of a volcano eruption in the next
H).(XK) years is one in 63 million.
Gusty winds forced his spiel about vol
canic risk to be cut short. Some said they were
disappointed they were not able to get their
questions answered.
RADIATION
The congressional act authorizing the de
velopment of Yucca Mountain ordered scien
tists to design the repository in such a way
that it could comply with standards for radia
tion set by the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA). When the Energy Depart
ment could not meet the more rigorous stan
dards, they were relaxed. A two-tier standard
was created by the EPA in Aug. 2(X)5, with one
set of limits for the first K).(XK) years of oper
ation and less stringent rules for the years
after that.
According to calculations by government
scientists, the site has an expected annual
limit of 30 millirem, the standard measure
ment for radiation, beginning in 10,(XX) years.
A tour guide compared this to the 2,(XX) mil

lirem he said a pack-a-day smoker exposes
himself to each year.
CORROSION
The waste being produced looks more like
marble-sized charcoal pieces than the green,
slushy liquid dramatized in shows like The
Simpsons. Mock pellets designed to look like
the waste are passed out to visitors.The waste
will be sealed in long tubes, not poured in 30
gallon drums as some imagine.
Even project officials acknowledge that
the water will corrode the metal tubes over
time and seep into the mountain, where it will
eventually reach and poison the water table.
Officials like Mike Plinski,a nuclear facilities
design engineer who works at the mountain,
downplayed the risk of toxic waste in the
aquifer.
"Since it is not a fast moving waster table,
it is going to take a while to get into the water
table," Plinski said. "It's a very low dose if it
does get into the water table."
Bush said that the type of rock will mean
that Yucca can stand up better to corrosion.
"The pore spaces in the crystallized rock
are not very well connected and there are not
many of them," Bush said.
Some of the tour participants wondered

how government scientists could project such
confidence in numbers that have been criti
cized by third-party experts.
"I don't understand how they can be so
certain when it is so many thousands of feet
beneath us," Nevadan George Yucha said
after Bush's briefing.
ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS
After lunch, representative employees
made themselves available from engineering,
mining, ecology, and transportation divisions
of the project.
When Raymond Ansotegui, an environ
mental scientist at the site, was prodded about
the danger toxic waste could pose to wildlife,
he defended the project by noting that "ani
mals are pretty resilient" and were able to
survive the nuclear testing nearby at the
Nevada Test Site.
Environmental engineer Cara Evangelista,
a Las Vegas native, expressed the site workers'
general confidence in the site's safety, saying
she would not come to work at the mountain
every day if the site were not safe.
"They are very safety-concerned," she
says."The standards are pretty hard core; you
need so much paperwork here to even step
outside."

that Yucca can stand up better to corrosion.
"The pore spaces in the crystallized rock
are not very well connected and there are not
many of them," Bush said.
Some of the tour participants wondered

how government scientists could project such
confidence in numbers that have been criti
cized by third-party experts.
"I don't understand how they can be so
certain when it is so many thousands of feet
beneath us," Nevadan George Yucha said
after Bush's briefing.
ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS
After lunch, representative employees
made themselves available from engineering,
mining, ecology, and transportation divisions
of the project.
When Raymond Ansotegui, an environ
mental scientist at the site, was prodded about
the danger toxic waste could pose to wildlife,
he defended the project by noting that "ani
mals are pretty resilient" and were able to
survive the nuclear testing nearby at the
Nevada Test Site.
Environmental engineer Cara Evangelista,
a Las Vegas native, expressed the site workers'
general confidence in the site's safety, saying
she would not come to work at the mountain
every day if the site were not safe.
"They are very safety-concerned," she
says."The standards are pretty hard core; you
need so much paperwork here to even step
outside."
