## Editorial Attend the town meeting on Iraq It's time to accept the past and took toward the future 
### 
The quagmire lies not on the battle
fields of Iraq, but within the hearts
and minds of the American people.
Three years since it began, the war in Iraq
continues to rage on with no end in sight.
Some might be supportive of the war and its
ostensible goals to liberate the oppressed
and bring democracy to the Middle East.
Others may be appalled by the mounting
number of military and civilian casualties
that have resulted.
Empty talk will achieve little.The reality
is that we cannot start with a blank slate, but
must work constructively toward a solution.
We need to develop more nuanced views
that have not been conditioned by partisan
ship. For instance, we should be open to the
possibility that we can support remaining in
Iraq while opposing the war in principle.
This afternoon, a University-wide town
hall meeting titled "Iraq: Where Do We Go
From Here?" will take place in Kresge Au
ditorium from 4:30 to 6 p.m. It would be
naive to expect too much from such a meet
ing. All the arguments have been trotted out
already, and we do not expect any startling
new insights to emerge.
This afternoon's meeting should not at
tempt to revisit the well-worn arguments
from both conservatives and liberals. We
don't want today's meeting to wallow in in
effectuality. Participants should not lose
sight of the best solution for the troops in
Iraq, America and the world. Rather than
condemning President George W. Bush and
Saddam Hussein as war criminals, partici
pants should be prepared to engage in open
and productive dialogue.
This is the model of dialogue that the Ed
itorial Board believes in and actively tries to
model. We are committed to reaching a con
sensus on a wide range of issues in spite of
our varied backgrounds.
We'd like to channel that sense of ur
gency and inevitability into this afternoon's
meeting. As human lives continue to be lost.

we feel this urgency more palpably. Partici
pants ought to enter into the dialogue with
the same level of commitment to producing
results.
We have minimal expectations for the
form these results should take. Neverthe
less, we challenge the organizers and partic
ipants of the meeting to come up with some
thing tangible. Even if the meeting doesn't
reach a definite conclusion, it should pro
duce a statement reflecting the views of
everyone present or a summary of the argu
ments presented. We believe that the larger
community will benefit from learning about
the diversity of perspectives on both sides of
the issue.
Indeed, the premise of the town hall
meeting appears well-suited to reaching
consensus. Its title "Where Do We Go From
Here?" acknowledges the reality of events
that have already taken place, but also en
courages participants to go beyond the po
litical wrangling of the past.
We hope that those present at today's
meeting will address the following ques
tions: What are some of the barriers — po
litical, economic, social and emotional —
that stand in the way of a solution in Iraq?
Given these barriers, what is the most feasi
ble course of action in Iraq going forward?
How might we persuade our political lead
ers to pursue such a course of action?
And for those of you who have strong
views on the war, don't settle for writing an
angry letter to the editor. It is all too easy for
you to fire off an indignant email from the
comfort of your dorm room or computer
cluster. Rather, we want you to go to the
meeting this afternoon and participate in
the process of dialogue. Be engaged and be
committed to reaching a consensus. Just go.

"Iraq: Where Do We Go From Here?'' will
lake place in Kresge Auditorium today at
4:30 p.m. The meeting is sponsored by the Of
fice for Religious Life.
