# Recipe for disaster
## 
### 
If you know what the acronym EVOO
stands for, then we need to hang out and he
friends. For while our classmates have been
outside enjoying the warm California sun. we
have been inside, imagining the warmth, flavor
and texture of our latest Food Network fix. You
will know what I'm talking about if I'm talking
about you. And if your name is "Mario Batali"
well,then we've already spoken through teleki
netic means. (I'm currently thinking: "Hello,
Mario. Yes 1 was talking about youjust now. But
don't worry. I didn't say anything bad about
your orange shoes.")
It began its an intellectual inquiry: Whose cui
sine reigns supreme? One episode of "Iron
Chef' was all it took before I was hooked. I espe
cially enjoyed the Japanese version of the show
because of the delightful running commentary
and its awkward translation into English. In fact,
sometimes when I talk (usually to myself) I pre
tend like it's a bad Japanese translation and I
move my lips and jaw in exaggerated ways to
hide my true mastery of the English language —
it's especially fun when you're tasting Ichkl for
the first time and pretending to be a judge.
But what struck me most about the show —
and contributed greatly to my subsequent ad
diction — was the way that it spoke in a univer
sal language: Food! Whoever thought-up the
idea of devoting an entire television network to
the topic is a genius (perhaps he or she attend
ed Stanford?). In fact. I'd like to personally
thank that person by giving them my mom's
recipe for chocolate crinkle cookies (note that
1 only offer the recipe, not the actual cookies,
because as we all know, they'd never make it
out of my kitchen alive).
As my addiction developed, it intersected
with many other aspects of my life. I love to
travel and save money, so Rachel Ray's show
"$4O-A-Day" sautes the two deliciously.
Again, genius. Sheer genius And based on her

love handles, I'm guessing Rachel Ray is the
real thing.
Although, to be fair.sometimes I get annoyed
that she essentially only has two reactions to
ANYTHING that she eats. One I have labeled
"inquisitive savory" in which she thinks about
the flavors and then describes how delicious
they are; the other is basically just repeating
"Mmm" five times. Apparently, she never eats
anything that tastes bad.
Now, I m going to be honest, I haven't exact
ly fallen in love with "Emeril Live" because the
audience is mostly comprised of complete id
iots that act like they've never tasted garlic or
butter before. It's hard for me to take the cook
ing seriously by the way he panders to the audi
ence, but that's just a matter of taste (clever use
of the homonym, don't you think?).
Furthermore, there are other shows that I
don't particularly care for. "Everyday Italian"
with Giada De Laurentiis is a great way to find
an Italian recipe, but I can hardly believe by her
skinny body and huge head that she actually
eats the stuff. Or maybe she just eats such small
portions that it's hard for me to imagine any
real Italian taking her seriously (last time I
checked pasta is a carb, Giada). Or maybe she
eats a ton of it and then "takes care of it" later
in the bathroom. Any way you slice and dice it,
no mere human has a metabolism to actually
look like her and cook liker her.
And then there's the comfort food shows
like "Paula's Home Cooking," "The Barefoot
Contessa" and others that basically show you
the secret's of mom's home cooking. Let's be
honest, though: These ladies pander to a specif
ic audience which includes middle-aged moms
and guys like me (if you know what I'm saying),
but then again, guys like me hardly eat the stuff.
After all, we've got to look g<K>d, and these
ladies aren't going to make us more popular
outside of the kitchen.

There's also the quirky-slash-informative
shows like "Ham on the Street ""The Secret
Life Of," "Top Five ," "Rokcr on the Road"
and "Unwrapped." These shows are basically
a blend of information, trivia and social psy
chology. My favorite is "Good Eats" with
host Alton Brown, mostly because he doesn't
hide the fact that he's a total dork, hence why
1 relate.
The Food Network's reality TV shows are
hit-and-miss. "The Food Network Challenge,"
" Ihe Next Food Network Star" and "Restau
rant Makeover" can be entertaining, but also
annoyingly dramatic or scripted. My advice is
to sprinkle them into your television diet with
caution. We don't want a bitter taste now, do
we?
And then there's my favorite: "Boy Meets
Grill" with host Bobby Flay. Not only have 1
learned how to turn anything into a kabob. I've
learned that there's just something to be said
for a man, a spatula and a grill. Watch the show
to see what I'm talking about. It can't be de
scribed with adjectives, unlike his recipe for
grilled prime rib steaks with bourbon-BBQ
baste and spice rubbed grilled Vidalia onions.
Sure. It's pornography tor the mouth, but 1
highly recommend that you have a taste. Hope
fully your experience won't be a recipe for dis
aster like mine. The last thing I needed was an
other way to procrastinate, especially this time
of year. But I suppose it's better than the UV
rays in which our friends are marinating.

ing seriously by the way he panders to the audi
ence, but that's just a matter of taste (clever use
of the homonym, don't you think?).
Furthermore, there are other shows that I
don't particularly care for. "Everyday Italian"
with Giada De Laurentiis is a great way to find
an Italian recipe, but I can hardly believe by her
skinny body and huge head that she actually
eats the stuff. Or maybe she just eats such small
portions that it's hard for me to imagine any
real Italian taking her seriously (last time I
checked pasta is a carb, Giada). Or maybe she
eats a ton of it and then "takes care of it" later
in the bathroom. Any way you slice and dice it,
no mere human has a metabolism to actually
look like her and cook liker her.
And then there's the comfort food shows
like "Paula's Home Cooking," "The Barefoot
Contessa" and others that basically show you
the secret's of mom's home cooking. Let's be
honest, though: These ladies pander to a specif
ic audience which includes middle-aged moms
and guys like me (if you know what I'm saying),
but then again, guys like me hardly eat the stuff.
After all, we've got to look g<K>d, and these
ladies aren't going to make us more popular
outside of the kitchen.

There's also the quirky-slash-informative
shows like "Ham on the Street ""The Secret
Life Of," "Top Five ," "Rokcr on the Road"
and "Unwrapped." These shows are basically
a blend of information, trivia and social psy
chology. My favorite is "Good Eats" with
host Alton Brown, mostly because he doesn't
hide the fact that he's a total dork, hence why
1 relate.
The Food Network's reality TV shows are
hit-and-miss. "The Food Network Challenge,"
" Ihe Next Food Network Star" and "Restau
rant Makeover" can be entertaining, but also
annoyingly dramatic or scripted. My advice is
to sprinkle them into your television diet with
caution. We don't want a bitter taste now, do
we?
And then there's my favorite: "Boy Meets
Grill" with host Bobby Flay. Not only have 1
learned how to turn anything into a kabob. I've
learned that there's just something to be said
for a man, a spatula and a grill. Watch the show
to see what I'm talking about. It can't be de
scribed with adjectives, unlike his recipe for
grilled prime rib steaks with bourbon-BBQ
baste and spice rubbed grilled Vidalia onions.
Sure. It's pornography tor the mouth, but 1
highly recommend that you have a taste. Hope
fully your experience won't be a recipe for dis
aster like mine. The last thing I needed was an
other way to procrastinate, especially this time
of year. But I suppose it's better than the UV
rays in which our friends are marinating.
