# Artichoke cupcake, anyone?

Artichoke soup, artichoke
Caesar salad, grilled arti
choke, steamed artichoke,
baked artichoke, artichoke burrito,
deep fried artichoke hearts, arti
choke chow mein. artichoke crown
stuffed with crab salad, fried arti
choke rings — before attending the
Castroville Artichoke Festival last
Sunday, I never knew there were so
many ways to eat an artichoke. And
that was just the beginning.
We had been planning our visit
to the 47th annual Artichoke Festi
val since spring break, so we were
excited. It lakes place in the little
town of Castroville, located near
Gilroy, which takes pride in being
the "artichoke capital of the world."
By 9 a.m. we were cruising down the
highway, ready to experience all the
artichokes we could handle.
I love finding random, kitschy
events that take me out of the Stan
ford Bubble and off the beaten
track. It didn't matter that it was
pouring rain — my friends DeAn
na and Katy and I were determined
to enjoy. Plus, this festival was going
to be different from the past 46 due
to a highlight performance by
American Idol loser William Hung.
That in itself was reason to go.
In any case, from the moment we
arrived, it was one ridiculosity after
another. After buying our tickets,
we were told that a helpful boy
scout wielding a large serrated
knife would help us attach our offi
cial entrance bracelets. Once inside,
one of the first sights that greeted us
was the massive "Heart of Ameri
ca" float at the end of the opening
parade, topped by the soaked Arti
choke Queen, wearing a white dress
and white jacket and waving de

spite the rain. Marilyn Monroe was
apparently the very first Artichoke
Queen of the Festival — I'm not
sure that this girl is going to make it
that far.
Next we browsed the arts and
crafts booths — ooh. ceramic arti
choke salt and pepper shakers!
Massive artichoke-shaped candles!
Artichoke wrapping paper! — be
fore finding the major attraction:
the food booths. We decided our
best strategy would be to split as
many dishes as we could, and our
first stop was the fried artichoke
booth. DeAnna asked the woman
in front of us if the dish she was eat
ing was good. "Yeah — if you like
artichokes!" Indeed.
And I certainly do like them —
artichokes have been one of my all
time favorite foods since I was a
kid, so this was pretty much para
dise. We decided, though, that the
best way to elongate our artichoke
eating experience was to spread it
out over the course of the day, one
dish at a time. So we made our way
to the Agro Art Competition.
According to the program. Agro
Art is "three-dimensional fruit and
vegetable artwork." 1 took dozens
of pictures of such standout sculp
tures as the seven-foot Statue of
Liberty model crafted primarily of
lettuce and tortillas and the parrot
created from spray-painted arti
choke leaves. I only wish I had such
talent.
Leaving the Agro Art pavilion,
we saw the scattered members of
the Los Trancos Woods Community
Marching Band (who looked to be
between 45 and 65), which basically
seems to be the Stanford Band in 35
years. Its members wore wacky hats

and outfits and participated in simi
larly silly antics — and. when they
finished their routine at 11 a.m.,
they had no problem opening up
their cooler cart and throwing back
a few beers.
We were also confused about the
profusion of men. women and chil
dren dressed in Renaissance garb.
Since DeAnna is a Renaissance
Faire aficionado herself, she struck
up a conversation with one of the
caped women, who explained that
they were promoting the Faire at
Casa de Fruta, a large roadside at
traction near Gilroy, in September.
She encouraged us to come, noting
that there would be "lots of horses
and good looking men in kilts" —
DeAnna, at least, was won over.
On our way to the "ABC's of Ar
tichokes" cooking demonstration,
we were sidetracked by a line dance
troupe. We watched for a moment
and then they began the steps to a
dance called the Tush Push, which I
once learned in show choir (don't
ask). "Ooh. I know this one!" I ex
claimed as I began to mimic the
steps. "Well get on over there!"
came the reply from an enthusiastic
audience member. So thanks to
peer pressure, the next thing I knew
I wasTUsh-Pushing it along with the
bolero-tied, cowboy hatted middle
aged women of the troupe. The one
next to me thought it was funny, I
think: the serious-looking woman

behind me did not. Oh well.
The leader of the cooking
demonstration was "not quite Julia
Child," according to Katy, hut he
tried — despite having forgotten
the knife, spoon, pot lid, bacon and
white wine he needed. And he had
no qualms about adding generous
amounts of butter, oil, bacon
grease, seasoning salt and garlic to
his artichoke hash brown dish.
Yum.
And then, it was time for the mo
ment of truth. As we sat on the hay
bales that comprised the audience
seating, eating our artichoke burri
tos and waiting to see honorary Ar
tichoke King William Hung, we
could hardly contain our anticipa
tion. Neither DeAnna nor Katy had
ever watched American Idol, so
they didn't fully realize what they
were in for — but 1 did. And then
there he was in all his glory, accom
panied by four scantily clad backup
dancers called the Hungettes who,
according to Katy, were about as
talented as a JV cheer squad.
William Hung flailed his way
through his classic rendition of "She
Bangs," plus two other numbers. It
was funny for the first minute, em
barrassing for the second, but the
last 13 minutes were so intolerable
that we had to leave. Symbolic of his
having outlived his fame, perhaps?
In any case, it was a fittingly ludi
crous end to our day in Castroville.

We had been planning to
finish with the artichoke
cupcake dish, but in the end
we couldn't bring ourselves
to eat it. Back to Stanford
we went, our hearts and

stomachs full of America's fa
vorite leafy green vegetable (um,
besides lettuce and all that). Will we
return next year for the 48th festi
val? I'm not sure. But if we do, that

delicious cupcake will be waiting.
