# GRADUATE LIFE
## Program caters to grads with interest in business 
### ANNY LIN STAFF WRITER 
For the tirst time this summer, graduate students will
have the opportunity to partake in the Stanford Gradu
ate Student Institute, a program established to better pre
pare them for diverse careers after they leave Stanford.
Part of a bigger push led by President John Hennessy to
enhance graduate education, the program will offer three
options in business, design and genetics for attendees to
explore areas beyond their concentrations.
The idea for the initiative was conceived as early as late
2(X)4. when I lennessy formed the Commission on Gradu
ate Education and charged them with the task of explor
ing ways to enhance the graduate experience to tailor to
the range of careers in the future. The commission was co
chaired by Yahoo! Founders Mark Horowitz, a professor
at the School of Engineering, and C huck Holloway,a pro
fessor emeritus from the Graduate School of Business.
At the end of last year, the commission released its re
port with a focus on encouraging intellectual innovation
and developing opportunities for cross-disciplinary and
interdisciplinary learning. One specific recommendation
was to develop a cross-disciplinary summer program
modeled on Sophomore College. According to Horowitz,
this is where the idea for the summer institute originated.
The three programs offered this year include the Sum
mer Institute for Entrepreneurship at the GSB. Adven
tures in Design Ihinking offered by the Design School
and Frontiers in Genetics from the Department of Ge
netics. According to Tom Federico, a staff member at the
GSB who has been charged with marketing the institute,
this is the first tangible product of the commission's re
port.
"Stanford is in a unique position to do something like
this because there are so many well-renowned schools on
one campus," Federico said.
In the program offered by the GSB. students will learn
basic business concepts such as accounting, finance, mar
keting and management and why they are important. Ac
cording to Dan Rudolph, senior associate dean for oper
ations at the GSB and administrator of the summer pro
gram, the commission's report found that an increasing
number of graduate students plan to go into business
after graduating.
Therefore, training in entrepreneurship would be ben
eficial, il not pivotal. Additionally,students will be able to
explore the business ambitions they already may have.
"In the application, each student was to talk about an
entrepreneurial idea they had," Rudolph said. "They will
be given the opportunity to further explore that idea dur
ing the four week program."

Terry Seelig, executive director of the Stanford Ven
tures Design Program and one of the organizers of the
I lasso Piatt ner Institute of Design, anticipates that this will
be a unique and fun experience for students exposed to a
different way of thinking.
"I see this program as an opportunity to bring togeth
er graduate students from across campus to woi k togeth
er on projects that stretch one's imagination." Seelig said.
"We will teach and use many of the tools that students are
exposed to in the design school courses. Essentially, this is
a week-long summer camp for graduate students who are
interested in experiencing the joy of design thinking."
In the genetics program, students will study mecha
nisms for information flow between generations and how
it changes over time in biological systems. They will also
explore the implications of related research and current
challenges. According to Andrew l ire, professor of
pathology and of genetics and coordinator for the pro
gram, this knowledge can be applied to various areas out
side of biology.
" Illis is one of the central areas of biology, and such
knowledge will be especially useful for students who
want to interface their studies with genetics," l ire said.
"Furthermore, ways of thinking in biology can be applied
to other areas. For example, genetics algorithms have
been used in the computer sciences."
According to Federico, response from graduate stu
dents has been very positive.
"They are excited to have this opportunity to get out
and try something new, which they often don't have the
