# ASSU SENATE
## Grad student diversity under fire 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
Yesterday evening the 2<KHv2(X)7
ASSL) Undergraduate Senate heard
presentations from a member of the
Graduate Student Council's Diversi
ty Committee criticizing the poor
racial diversity in the graduate stu
dent body. It also heard from next
year's ASSU financial manager on
the organization and finances of
Stanford Student Enterprises (SSE).
Cullen Buie,a third-year graduate
student in mechanical engineering,
has served as co-chair of the (JSC's
Diversity Committee for two years.
"This committee was formed to
look at diversity in the graduate level
for women and under-represented
minorities," Buie told the Senate.
"The major issue was that these pop
ulations 011 the graduate level were
far below than what you see in the
U.S. Census or even at the undergrad
uate level."
Buie's charts showed that while
the U.S. was 12 percent black and 13
percent Latino, and the Stanford un
dergraduate population is roughly
similar, the graduate population is
only 3 percent black and 5 percent
1 lispanic.
Buie also claimed that the Univer
sity was reluctant to release a break
down of each department's racial di
versity.
"The University just w ill not yield
this data, probably because it's so
bad." Buie said. "The idea is that if
you yield this data that is broken
down by department and for in
stance. there is one black student in
chemistry. Iliat technically violates
some privacy laws because you can
identify who that person is. In my
mind, that's crap. If that's the issue,
then maybe you should try to get
two."
Recently there has been a drop in
the numbers of graduate students
from underrepresented minority
groups. Buie blamed this on the de
centralization of graduate school ad
missions practices in 1996.This meas
ure gave each department more free
dom to choose their graduate classes,
at the cost of University-wide agen
das such as upping diversity.

To counter this trend, the Diversi
ty Committee proposed that the Uni
versity hire a vice provost for gradu
ate education to focus on the subject.
According to Buie. this official would
work to increase centralization and
make departments more aware of di
versity issues without encroaching on
their autonomy.
The new senators, who took their
seats a few weeks ago, also got a brief
overview of Stanford Student Enter
prises from Matt McDonald, Class of
2005. who will be the ASSU financial
manager and chief executive officer
of SSE next year.
"The ASSU has had random busi
nesses for 20 or 30 years now," Mc-
Donald said. "And in the early 1990s
there were some major University
budget cuts. A guy named John Hall
came along and wanted to make sure
that the ASSU endowment was sus
tained in the long term. So the SSE
was formed out of the ASSU.
"At that time there were 12 divi
sions. with a total endowment of
around $2.8 million,"he continued.

"Right now. the endowment is
around $5 million. So you can see that
the SSE is pumping quite a hit of
money into the organization and
really sustaining the long-term viabil
ity of the ASSU."
The Senate also heard from Dmit
ry Belogolovsky.a first-year graduate
student in computational mathemat
ical engineering and a member of the
Nominations Commission.
"We're basically done nominating
people for Board ol'Trustees commit
lees," said Belogolovsky in an inter
view with The Daily. " Hie Board ol
Trustees committees might deal with
something like alumni affairs, while
the University committees deal with
dining or Founder's Day."
Belogolovsky reported that com
mittee assignments were extremely
competitive.
"We had a lot of applications," he
said. "We went through them and
read all of them. We interviewed a lot
of people. We were interviewing for
three weeks, weekends as well as dur
ing the week."
