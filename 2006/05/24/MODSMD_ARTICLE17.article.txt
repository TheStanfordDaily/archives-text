## Stepping up for her team Trotter's leadership key to track's continued success 
### SAMUEL CHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In this week's "Through My Eyes,"
Ihe Daily talks to Katy Trotter, a junior
from Little Silver, N. J. Katy, along with
her twin sister Amanda, stars on both the
Stanford Track and Field squad and the
National Champion Cross Country team.

Most recently, Katy contributed signifi
cant points in the Cardinal's narrow-mar
gined second place finish at the Pac-10
Track and Field Championships.
On being a leader and setting an
example with roles on the two teams
This year in cross country. I'm a junior
on a team without any seniors, so we [the
junior class] have hud to step up and take
more of a leadership role. At the start of
the year. I wasn't picked as a captain,
though the decision was really better for
me because I could really concentrate on

stepping up and performing well for both
myself and the team. I think for me, if 1
had to balance both roles, it would have
been a big challenge. Just looking at (red
shirt sophomores] Arianna Lambie and
Teresa McWalters, they've both done
great jobs as captains.
In track, it's a little different, because
it's not so isolated with just ten girls. It's
an entire track and field team, of which
you are just a part. In this situation, I think
I've been able to accomplish what I've
wanted, in, again,concentrating on myself
as well as helping the team succeed.
On starting out running and
learning to love it
I actually didn't start out was a runner.
I was a soccer player first. 1 think that's
probably where my competitive drive
began. I just love competing and trying to
beat others out. I guess that's why I'm at
Stanford too. I'm a pretty competitive
person, but I still really like to keep it fun.
All my experiences I've gained from run
ning and being the team have been really
great.
On recent Pac-10 success
Pac-10's [The Pacific 10 Conference
Track and Field Championships] is a very
team-oriented meet, and it's been very
important for us to go in there, do our
best, and possibly win it. Last year, we
won it, and that was kind of a surprise
when we beat UCLA. This year, it was
once again an important event for our
team. Actually,going into the meet, a cou
ple of our star athletes came down with
injuries and were forced to sit out for a
couple of the races. This made the event a
little stressful for me, as I had to really
step it up and make sure that I was going
to gain points in all of the events that I
competed in.
At the meet, I actually ran in the
10,000-meters, which was my first 10,000
ever. That was a little bit of a surprise, as
my coach [Peter Tegen] told me about
three days before the race that I was
going to be slated to run it. For this race,
he wanted me to go in there, and just get
6 points, which was going to put me in
third place. [Arizona State] had two girls
already in there, and he kind of expected
them to go 1-2. So, my job was to get [to
third] and I did that, which was nice.
The next day, I had the SK. For this
race, [Coach Tegen] wanted me to come
back and race with what I had left in me.
This was the kind of race where no one re
ally knew how well I was going to do, but
I ended up coming in second place, and
ran a personal best, so I was really, really
happy with that. For the meet, we ended
up only losing by two and a half points,
which was incredible considering we


JOEL LEWENSTEIN/The Stanford Daily
were missing (due to injuries) the
probable the 5K winner and another
5K runner who could have easily
scored in the top 5. If we had those
runners, we most likely could have
won. Overall, it was definitely a good
weekend for us.
On having a new coach in
Tegen this year
Since our coach resigned last year,
part of my job as an upperclassman
was to make sure there was a smooth
transition for everyone, especially
the freshmen. It's actually a com
pletely new experience for everyone.
A new training method, new racing
schemes, just the whole thing. It was
kind of hard to deal with in the begin
ning, but I think with open minds,
everyone adapted to his training
style and his training methods really
well. So far, it seems like [the transi
tion] has worked out really well and
been really smooth.
On her teammates and what it's like
having a twin on the team
Right now. our track team is at the
point where we are looking towards
Regionals and Nationals. But most of
our distance crew is out, so it's only
my sister, me and [sophomore] Lind
say Allen, who's actually racing the
3000 steeplechase. Right now, it's just
Amanda and I doing workouts to
gether, but having her by my side is a
huge advantage. We're really fortu
nate to have each other — to have
someone to work out with — and to
motivate each other to compete to
our best abilities. This year is differ
ent because we usually have a crew
going to Regionals and looking for
ward to Nationals. So, it's a little awk
ward, but we're handling it well, and I
think we're both looking to do some
good things at Regionals.
Where we'll see Katy next...
Regionals will be held in Provo,
Utah, on May 26-27, so the race will
be in high altitude conditions. At the
meet, the top 5 automatically qualify
for Nationals. Both Amanda and I
will be running the SK. We know run
ning in altitude is going to be a chal
lenge. but everyone has to deal with
the same conditions, so hopefully,
we'll see good things.

I've been able to accomplish what I've
wanted, in, again,concentrating on myself
as well as helping the team succeed.
On starting out running and
learning to love it
I actually didn't start out was a runner.
I was a soccer player first. 1 think that's
probably where my competitive drive
began. I just love competing and trying to
beat others out. I guess that's why I'm at
Stanford too. I'm a pretty competitive
person, but I still really like to keep it fun.
All my experiences I've gained from run
ning and being the team have been really
great.
On recent Pac-10 success
Pac-10's [The Pacific 10 Conference
Track and Field Championships] is a very
team-oriented meet, and it's been very
important for us to go in there, do our
best, and possibly win it. Last year, we
won it, and that was kind of a surprise
when we beat UCLA. This year, it was
once again an important event for our
team. Actually,going into the meet, a cou
ple of our star athletes came down with
injuries and were forced to sit out for a
couple of the races. This made the event a
little stressful for me, as I had to really
step it up and make sure that I was going
to gain points in all of the events that I
competed in.
At the meet, I actually ran in the
10,000-meters, which was my first 10,000
ever. That was a little bit of a surprise, as
my coach [Peter Tegen] told me about
three days before the race that I was
going to be slated to run it. For this race,
he wanted me to go in there, and just get
6 points, which was going to put me in
third place. [Arizona State] had two girls
already in there, and he kind of expected
them to go 1-2. So, my job was to get [to
third] and I did that, which was nice.
The next day, I had the SK. For this
race, [Coach Tegen] wanted me to come
back and race with what I had left in me.
This was the kind of race where no one re
ally knew how well I was going to do, but
I ended up coming in second place, and
ran a personal best, so I was really, really
happy with that. For the meet, we ended
up only losing by two and a half points,
which was incredible considering we

were missing (due to injuries) the
probable the 5K winner and another
5K runner who could have easily
scored in the top 5. If we had those
runners, we most likely could have
won. Overall, it was definitely a good
weekend for us.
On having a new coach in
Tegen this year
Since our coach resigned last year,
part of my job as an upperclassman
was to make sure there was a smooth
transition for everyone, especially
the freshmen. It's actually a com
pletely new experience for everyone.
A new training method, new racing
schemes, just the whole thing. It was
kind of hard to deal with in the begin
ning, but I think with open minds,
everyone adapted to his training
style and his training methods really
well. So far, it seems like [the transi
tion] has worked out really well and
been really smooth.
On her teammates and what it's like
having a twin on the team
Right now. our track team is at the
point where we are looking towards
Regionals and Nationals. But most of
our distance crew is out, so it's only
my sister, me and [sophomore] Lind
say Allen, who's actually racing the
3000 steeplechase. Right now, it's just
Amanda and I doing workouts to
gether, but having her by my side is a
huge advantage. We're really fortu
nate to have each other — to have
someone to work out with — and to
motivate each other to compete to
our best abilities. This year is differ
ent because we usually have a crew
going to Regionals and looking for
ward to Nationals. So, it's a little awk
ward, but we're handling it well, and I
think we're both looking to do some
good things at Regionals.
Where we'll see Katy next...
Regionals will be held in Provo,
Utah, on May 26-27, so the race will
be in high altitude conditions. At the
meet, the top 5 automatically qualify
for Nationals. Both Amanda and I
will be running the SK. We know run
ning in altitude is going to be a chal
lenge. but everyone has to deal with
the same conditions, so hopefully,
we'll see good things.
