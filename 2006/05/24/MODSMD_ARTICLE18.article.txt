# I love sports, how 'bout you?
## 
### 
Ihad big plans for this week's col
umn. I was going to make a com
prehensive inventory of all the
athletes, coaches, teams or whatever
else that annoy me. Trust me, it's a
long list. It was going to be headed
by the likes of Rick Fox, Curt
Shilling and Brady Quinn's sister,
with her annoying half Notre Dame
half Ohio State jersey.
But as I sat down to put the
words on the page, I realized that
that's not me. Sports journalists
have the deserved reputation of
being bitter. Whether it is because
they couldn't cut it as an athlete
themselves or they're just jealous
that the athletes get all the girls,
more often then not columnists
tear things down.
It is all over the place. The day
after the Pistons killed the Cavs in
Game Seven, Skip Bayless goes on
ESPN and rips Leßron James — de
spite the fact that Leßron got Cleve
land three wins more than anyone
expected.
By no means am I claiming I have
never insulted, berated or criticized
athletes. I have been guilty of this
more times than I 'm proud of. But the
fact of the matter is. I'm not bitter.
I'm the exact opposite, and that's
why I can't write a column detailing
the fact that Bob Sura sucks (long
story) or on my belief that Tim Dun
can should stop crying about foul
calls. Instead today's column is
about my love of sports.
I have the absolute pleasure of
getting to travel to watch nearly
every Stanford football, men's bas
ketball and baseball game in my ca
pacity as a beat writer and columnist
for the Daily and baseball broad

caster for KZSU. I have seen in per
son this year thus far every football
game. 22 men's basketball games
and 49 baseball games, not to men
tion press conferences, time spent at
the Daily and hours prepping for
every event that I attend. As you can
guess, all this occupies a good deal of
my free time.
The thing is. 1 don't blow off class,
travel to Pullman on weekends and
stay in cheap motels because I'm bit
ter. I do it because 1 love what I do.
I spent last Sunday night on a bus
home from L.A., returning home
from a tough road trip for Stanford
baseball, which ended on a walk off
home run by UCLA's Tim Stewart.
Theoretically, the ride would be as
bad as it could get — seven hours
squeezed in a bus seat after a devas
tating loss. But instead, 1 sat there
staring at the rain pounding on the
window and thinking how good life
was. Why? Because 1 love what I'm
doing. How many people can really
say that?
I may make comments in passing
about how Brett Favre should just
retire or the Red Sox are a whinier
version of the Yankees, but the truth
is I would give anything to watch
them play on a regular basis.
I think that that is probably true
of all sports writers, whether they
come off as bitter or not. It takes a
certain kind of person to follow
sweaty men around and ask them
questions about their groin muscles
or why they committed that foul that
cost their team the game.
I have come to the sad realization
that I am one of those people, and I
really couldn't be happier.

Just because Alex didn't dwell on the
negative doesn t mean you can t. Let
