## Card hoping to glide through Nationals 
### NATALIE CHLADEK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford sailing team looks to finish
the season on a high note at Nationals, which
will take place during the next two weeks in
Charleston, S.C. For the first time since 1993,
Stanford will participate in the Team Race,
the Women's Dinghy and the Coed Dinghy
regattas at the Intercollegiate Sailing Asso
ciation (ICSA) Nationals. The team quali
fied for all three competitions after strong
finishes in the Pacific Coast Championships
in late April.
After a successful season, head coach Jay
Kehoe has high expectations for the team.
"We have a pretty deep team and have
been putting in the extra effort so we are
ready to win," he said. "But you always need
a little luck on your side, so I feel a top three
[finish] is a goal."
Kehoe also noted that he expects the
coed team to nab a top five spot in addition
to top three finishes from the women and
team racers.
Kehoe finds junior Becca Levin to be a
strong asset, as she will participate in all
three events over the two weeks.
"She is a very important piece in our puz
zle," he said.
Along with Levin, freshman Taylor
Grimes will be the other Stanford sailor
competing in all three events.
liie team has been doing intense training
in these past weeks leading up to Nationals.
In Charleston, the Cardinal will sail in boats
called 4205, which are wider and sail slightly
differently from the boats that they usually
race on the West Coast. Fortunate to have
fleets of both types of boats, Stanford has
been preparing in the 420s by prac
ticing outside — in order to simu
late the current and waves condi
tions they will face in Charleston.
Stanford enters the competition
with high rankings.The coed team is
ranked sixth, and the women are
ranked fifth in the ICS A. The Stan
ford coed team will face tough com
petition in the Coed Dinghy from
the College of Charleston. Hobart
and Williams Smith College, and

use.
In the Team Race, Hobart and
William Smith and Harvard are
considered to pose the greatest
challenge.The Stanford women will
find their toughest competitors in
Yale, College of Charleston, and the
U.S. Naval Academy.
After a superb season this year,
Stanford looks to continue their
success next year as well. With a
strong incoming freshmen class.
Coach Kehoe believes they have a
good chance to return to Nationals
again.
"We are in great shape to be in
all three [National regattas] next
year also," he said.
