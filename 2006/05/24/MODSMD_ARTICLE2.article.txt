## WOMEN'S TENNIS CONTINUES ITS NCAA DYNASTY 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
As Ilieresa Logar's forehand vol
ley caught the outside edge of the
backhand sideline, the junior spiked
her racquet to the ground and leapt
in the air, both fists pumped in cele
bration.
But in a way. the point was anticli
mactic. It just made official what the
world of women's tennis has known
for three years straight: Stanford is
queen.
With the 4-1 rout of Miami, the
Cardinal capped a perfect season
with their third straight national title.
For Stanford (30-0, 8-0 Pac-10), the
victory marked their 86th in a row
and their 107 th straight at home —
both easily NCAA records.
Much like her team. Logar domi
nated from the outset in what would
prove the championship-clinching
match against Monika Dancevic in
the No. 3 singles slot. Logar's serves
and ground strokes proved too
strong — and her footwork too
quick — as she ran away with a 6-0,
6-3 decision over the Canadian from
Miami (24-7).
"At first, 1 kind of didn't realize
we had won," Logar said. "Then it
hits you — and then the team hits
you. It was pretty surreal to know
that I had clinched."
Sure enough, the team rushed
onto the court to mob Logar. In the
madness, sophomore Lejla Hodzic
took her teammate down with a text
book tackle that must have pleased
football coach Walt Harris, who at
tended the championship alongside
University President John Hennessy.
