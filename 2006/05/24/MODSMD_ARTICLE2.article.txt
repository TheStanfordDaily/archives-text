# THRILLING THREEPEAT
## WOMEN'S TENNIS CONTINUES ITS NCAA DYNASTY 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
As Ilieresa Logar's forehand vol
ley caught the outside edge of the
backhand sideline, the junior spiked
her racquet to the ground and leapt
in the air, both fists pumped in cele
bration.
But in a way. the point was anticli
mactic. It just made official what the
world of women's tennis has known
for three years straight: Stanford is
queen.
With the 4-1 rout of Miami, the
Cardinal capped a perfect season
with their third straight national title.
For Stanford (30-0, 8-0 Pac-10), the
victory marked their 86th in a row
and their 107 th straight at home —
both easily NCAA records.
Much like her team. Logar domi
nated from the outset in what would
prove the championship-clinching
match against Monika Dancevic in
the No. 3 singles slot. Logar's serves
and ground strokes proved too
strong — and her footwork too
quick — as she ran away with a 6-0,
6-3 decision over the Canadian from
Miami (24-7).
"At first, 1 kind of didn't realize
we had won," Logar said. "Then it
hits you — and then the team hits
you. It was pretty surreal to know
that I had clinched."
Sure enough, the team rushed
onto the court to mob Logar. In the
madness, sophomore Lejla Hodzic
took her teammate down with a text
book tackle that must have pleased
football coach Walt Harris, who at
tended the championship alongside
University President John Hennessy.


JOHN CHOCK/The Stanford Daily
The women's tennis team celebrates their victory in the NCAA Tournament Championship. In the past six years they have won five titles, and they ended
the season undefeated.
"It's the one time I'm glad we only have 11 people on
the team," Logar said. "Maybe I won't clinch next year so
I won't be at the bottom."
The championship continues one of the most impres
sive dynastic runs in any collegiate sport. Since 1978,
Stanford has claimed 15 NCAA titles, 10 in undefeated
seasons. Only North Carolina, with 17 women's soccer
crowns, has more NCAA titles in any one sport.
"This was one of the best teams to play an undefeated
season," Coach Lele Forood said. "We had a lot of mo
ments where records were on the line, and it was a spirit
ed group to keep it going."
Stanford's recent success is even more overwhelming,
as the Card have claimed five titles in the last six years.
"Surprisingly, we've gotten stronger every year," said
senior Amber Liu of the four-year reign. Stanford went
111-2 over the period.
In this latest title run, sophomore Celia Durkin and
freshman Jessica Nguyen set the stage for Logar's hero
ics, claiming Stanford's first two singles points. Durkin
needed barely an hour to cruise past Patricia Starzyk for
Stanford's first singles point, 6-0, 6-2. Then Nguyen
downed Caren Seenauth 6-1, 6-0 with a blistering fore
hand and a strong service return.
A painful strained right quad forced junior Anne
Yelsey out of her No. 4 singles position. That slid sopho
more Whitney Deason and Durkin up to the four and five
slots, and opened up room for Nguyen to leave the Car
dinal just one point shy of the title.
"We've been trying to get [Yelsey] through the dou
bles and see if she can play the singles," Forood said. "Our
team's very deep, so if anyone's not 100 percent, we're
going to put out someone who is 100 percent."
Aside from Yelsey's injury, the only blemish on the
calm, cloudy afternoon came in the top singles spot,
where Audra Cohen's power proved too much for Liu.
Cohen claimed a 6-3,6-3 victory for Miami's only team
point — the only one Stanford has allowed in their eight
matches since April 15—just minutes before Logar
clinched the victory.
Stanford kicked off the match with a 2-0 victory in
doubles play in front of a mostly full Taube Tennis Cen
ter.
The decisive match came on court one. where Yelsey

"I wanted to win it, but more
than anything I wanted us to feel
better about how we were
playing out there."

— ALICE BARNES, senior

and senior Alice Barnes trailed the Miami tandem of
Cohen and Melissa Applebaum 7-3. Just one game away
from a demoralizing defeat, Yelsey and Barnes knew
they had to play more aggressively — Yelsey's strained
quad be damned.
"If you're going to lose, you at least want to feel that
you attacked and that you went for it," Barnes said. "If
they play well, then that's one thing. But if you sit back
and let them dictate and you lose it 8-3, then 1 think our
attitude going into singles would have been much worse."
And attack they did. In an incredibly up-tempo con
test, the top-ranked pair in the nation won six straight
games to snatch a 9-7 win from the jaws of defeat.
"We were twitching pretty good at the beginning of
their match but we got ourselves righted a little bit,"
Forood said." It was certainly not their finest day. but they
were able to hang in long enough to turn that match
around. I'm still not quite sure how they did it."
With that dramatic victory, the Stanford pair wrestled
away the momentum for good. Miami's best — and last
— shot at derailing the Stanford dynasty had come and
gone.
"I wanted to win it, but more than anything, I wanted
us to feel better about how we were playing out there,"
Barnes said.
In the N0.2 doubles slot, Durkin connected on sever
al dramatic overhands in the match's final games, as she
and senior Amber Liu took an 8-3 decision over Audrey
Banada and Dancevic.
Hodzic and Nguyen were tied 6-all with Seenauth and
Starzyk after both sides struggled to hold serve when the
Card victory on court one ended doubles play.
And though the day couldn't have gone better, a tinge
of melancholy shaded the celebration for Stanford's four
seniors: Barnes, Liu. Joanna Kao and Jessica Leek. As
amazing as the last four years have been, they knew yes
terday marked the end of the road.
"It's a massive part of our lives that's gone," Barnes
said."l'm still in denial. It means so much to you and then
it's taken away. At least the last match was about as good
as it could have been."
TIEBREAKER'Yhc field was set yesterday for the
NCAA Individual Championships, which start this
morning. Barnes, Deason, Durkin, Liu, Logar and Yelsey
will compete in the singles. Barnes and Yelsey, and
Durkin and Liu will compete in doubles.

and senior Alice Barnes trailed the Miami tandem of
Cohen and Melissa Applebaum 7-3. Just one game away
from a demoralizing defeat, Yelsey and Barnes knew
they had to play more aggressively — Yelsey's strained
quad be damned.
"If you're going to lose, you at least want to feel that
you attacked and that you went for it," Barnes said. "If
they play well, then that's one thing. But if you sit back
and let them dictate and you lose it 8-3, then 1 think our
attitude going into singles would have been much worse."
And attack they did. In an incredibly up-tempo con
test, the top-ranked pair in the nation won six straight
games to snatch a 9-7 win from the jaws of defeat.
"We were twitching pretty good at the beginning of
their match but we got ourselves righted a little bit,"
Forood said." It was certainly not their finest day. but they
were able to hang in long enough to turn that match
around. I'm still not quite sure how they did it."
With that dramatic victory, the Stanford pair wrestled
away the momentum for good. Miami's best — and last
— shot at derailing the Stanford dynasty had come and
gone.

us to feel better about how we were playing out there,"
Barnes said.

seniors: Barnes, Liu. Joanna Kao and Jessica Leek. As
amazing as the last four years have been, they knew yes

"It's a massive part of our lives that's gone," Barnes
said."l'm still in denial. It means so much to you and then
it's taken away. At least the last match was about as good
as it could have been."

Durkin and Liu will compete in doubles.
As Ilieresa Logar's forehand vol
ley caught the outside edge of the
backhand sideline, the junior spiked
her racquet to the ground and leapt
in the air, both fists pumped in cele
bration.
But in a way. the point was anticli
mactic. It just made official what the
world of women's tennis has known
for three years straight: Stanford is
queen.
With the 4-1 rout of Miami, the
Cardinal capped a perfect season
with their third straight national title.
For Stanford (30-0, 8-0 Pac-10), the
victory marked their 86th in a row
and their 107 th straight at home —
both easily NCAA records.
Much like her team. Logar domi
nated from the outset in what would
prove the championship-clinching
match against Monika Dancevic in
the No. 3 singles slot. Logar's serves
and ground strokes proved too
strong — and her footwork too
quick — as she ran away with a 6-0,
6-3 decision over the Canadian from
Miami (24-7).
"At first, 1 kind of didn't realize
we had won," Logar said. "Then it
hits you — and then the team hits
you. It was pretty surreal to know
that I had clinched."
Sure enough, the team rushed
onto the court to mob Logar. In the
madness, sophomore Lejla Hodzic
took her teammate down with a text
book tackle that must have pleased
football coach Walt Harris, who at
tended the championship alongside
University President John Hennessy.


JOHN CHOCK/The Stanford Daily
The women's tennis team celebrates their victory in the NCAA Tournament Championship. In the past six years they have won five titles, and they ended
the season undefeated.
"It's the one time I'm glad we only have 11 people on
the team," Logar said. "Maybe I won't clinch next year so
I won't be at the bottom."
The championship continues one of the most impres
sive dynastic runs in any collegiate sport. Since 1978,
Stanford has claimed 15 NCAA titles, 10 in undefeated
seasons. Only North Carolina, with 17 women's soccer
crowns, has more NCAA titles in any one sport.
"This was one of the best teams to play an undefeated
season," Coach Lele Forood said. "We had a lot of mo
ments where records were on the line, and it was a spirit
ed group to keep it going."
Stanford's recent success is even more overwhelming,
as the Card have claimed five titles in the last six years.
"Surprisingly, we've gotten stronger every year," said
senior Amber Liu of the four-year reign. Stanford went
111-2 over the period.
In this latest title run, sophomore Celia Durkin and
freshman Jessica Nguyen set the stage for Logar's hero
ics, claiming Stanford's first two singles points. Durkin
needed barely an hour to cruise past Patricia Starzyk for
Stanford's first singles point, 6-0, 6-2. Then Nguyen
downed Caren Seenauth 6-1, 6-0 with a blistering fore
hand and a strong service return.
A painful strained right quad forced junior Anne
Yelsey out of her No. 4 singles position. That slid sopho
more Whitney Deason and Durkin up to the four and five
slots, and opened up room for Nguyen to leave the Car
dinal just one point shy of the title.
"We've been trying to get [Yelsey] through the dou
bles and see if she can play the singles," Forood said. "Our
team's very deep, so if anyone's not 100 percent, we're
going to put out someone who is 100 percent."
Aside from Yelsey's injury, the only blemish on the
calm, cloudy afternoon came in the top singles spot,
where Audra Cohen's power proved too much for Liu.
Cohen claimed a 6-3,6-3 victory for Miami's only team
point — the only one Stanford has allowed in their eight
matches since April 15—just minutes before Logar
clinched the victory.
Stanford kicked off the match with a 2-0 victory in
doubles play in front of a mostly full Taube Tennis Cen
ter.
