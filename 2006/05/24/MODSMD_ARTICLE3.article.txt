## Tennis has the heart of champs 
### 
Isat down to write this column about
all of Stanford women's tennis ex
traordinary accomplishments over
the years. I could throw a lot of pretty
mind-boggling statistics at you — Stan
ford has won 15 of the 25 NCAA
women's tennis championships; the team
is 30-0 on the season and 86-0 stretching
back to the 2003 NCAA finals match; the
team hasn't lost at home since Feb. 27,
1999 — no matter which way you slice it,
the women's tennis team is an absolute
beast, a true sports dynasty.
But anyone could give you those
numbers. They're easily accessible on
line, and every GoStanford press re
lease about the team includes some new
stat. What I'm in a unique position to
offer, however, is insight into what truly
makes this team remarkable, what
makes it tick and why it is so much big
ger and more special than the numbers
could begin to suggest.
This team has heart.
Bear with me here. I may be a bit
sappy, having just watched some of my
closest friends win a third-straight na
tional championship at the close of our
senior year. But the numerous feats of
the team bear witness to the spirit and
resolve of Cardinal women's tennis.
How else to explain yesterday's
compelling comeback by the top
ranked doubles team of Alice Barnes
and Anne Yelsey? Though Yelsey was
too injured to play singles, she stuck it
out for doubles, knowing how crucial
that doubles point has been in the
past for the Card. The pair was down
3-7 at one point, but then won six
straight games to clinch the doubles
point for the team. That's heart.
How else to explain that Amber
Liu, down 2-5 in her second set after
dropping her first yesterday, stead
fastly refused to relinquish her
match? With her neighboring team
mates on courts two and three both a
game away from clinching the
NCAA title, she held on fiercely, if ul
timately unsuccessfully. You could
see the determination in her eyes.
From the beginning of her freshman
year, she has epitomized grit. This is,
after all, the girl who won the NCAA
singles title her freshman and sopho
more years.
How else to explain the fact that in
every single "Through My Eyes" in
terview I've conducted, the players
have emphasized that this is the clos
est tennis team in the country, that
everyone always gets along — em
bracing personality differences (with
some amount of affectionate teasing)
rather than being competitive or
cliquey? A team can have an amazing
record and a legendary legacy, but it
means nothing if the players don't
mesh. I think everyone on the team
would agree that they were attracted
to Stanford in large part because on

their recruiting trips they saw how
much the girls on the team truly got
along.
And 1 will vouch for these claims
of closeness. Fate assigned me a fresh
man roommate on the team who has
remained my roommate every year
I've been at Stanford. I've watched
the team closely and personally over
the past four years. They really do all
get along.
But beyond that, and perhaps
even more impressively, they're in
credibly down-to-earth and unas
suming. We're talking about some of
the best tennis players in the country,
and they never once seemed to ques
tion my inclusion in team events.
Even as a freshman, I was always wel
come at dinners, Yumi Yougurt runs
and movie nights with the team. The
team organized and co-hosted a sur
prise birthday party for me last year
— and even team alums showed up.
In fact, the entire team always shows
up to my birthday party. And yet, if 1
marvel to one of them about what an
amazing player she is, she will invari
ably shrug it off and change the sub
ject.
I don't think this modesty and
generosity is necessarily unique to
the women's team. I do think it's a
credit to Stanford Athletics that our
athletes are by and large just another
one of us Stanford students. But these
women are Stanford students who
win national titles year after year.
And that is a credit to their superla
tive coaching staff of Lele Forood.
Frankie Brennan and Julie Scott-Thu
— and their heart.
So Nuge, Megan, Lejla, Whit, Seal,
T, Anne, Amber, Jess, A 1 and Jo —
congratulations. You are all excep
tional people and you deserve this.
I love you girls.
