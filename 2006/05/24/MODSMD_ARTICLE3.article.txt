## Tennis has the heart of champs 
### 
Isat down to write this column about
all of Stanford women's tennis ex
traordinary accomplishments over
the years. I could throw a lot of pretty
mind-boggling statistics at you — Stan
ford has won 15 of the 25 NCAA
women's tennis championships; the team
is 30-0 on the season and 86-0 stretching
back to the 2003 NCAA finals match; the
team hasn't lost at home since Feb. 27,
1999 — no matter which way you slice it,
the women's tennis team is an absolute
beast, a true sports dynasty.
But anyone could give you those
numbers. They're easily accessible on
line, and every GoStanford press re
lease about the team includes some new
stat. What I'm in a unique position to
offer, however, is insight into what truly
makes this team remarkable, what
makes it tick and why it is so much big
ger and more special than the numbers
could begin to suggest.
This team has heart.
Bear with me here. I may be a bit
sappy, having just watched some of my
closest friends win a third-straight na
tional championship at the close of our
senior year. But the numerous feats of
the team bear witness to the spirit and
resolve of Cardinal women's tennis.
