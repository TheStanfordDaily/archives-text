## Trio arrested at Bush protest set for day in court Students find ASSU legal services inadequate for their case 
### AMIT ARORA STAFF WRITER 
While some students may have al
ready forgotten the protest against
President George W. Bush's visit to
the Hoover Institution a month ago,
three still remember the incident
clearly. Seniors Claire Wagenseil,
Diogo Pereira and Caroline Martin,
the students arrested for blocking a
fire truck, will appear in Palo Alto
Court on June 7 to plead their cases.
The students were taken into cus
tody when they refused to move off
Serra Street despite the orders of fire
personnel at the scene. Officers
dragged the students out of the road
and bound their hands with plastic
ties before they were put into a Sher
iffs Department vehicle and taken
away 15 minutes later.
All three were then charged with
failure to yield to a vehicle in a road
way and resisting, delaying and ob
structing a peace officer. Sgt. Hilary
Karp of the Stanford Department of
Public Safety also indicated that Wa
genseil was charged with battery.
In the month since the protest, the
three have searched for legal repre
sentation. While the ASSU funds
legal counseling services, the students
will likely seek an attorney unaffiliat
ed with the University. In an interview
with the Daily, Pereira negatively de
scribed his interaction with the ASSU

Legal Counseling Office.
"I have spoken with the ASSU and
they basically told me that they can't
help me," he said. "Legal Counseling
doesn't have much experience with
criminal cases. They mostly focus on
corporate matters and divorce."
Pereira added that he may plead
his case directly with the two other
students.
"I have spoken with Claire and
Caroline, and it seems that they have
found a good attorney," he said. "We
may all choose to plead together."
While Pereira found ASSU Legal
Counseling to be insufficient, the
ASSU defended the services provid
ed. In an interview with Hie Daily,
ASSU President Elizabeth Heng, a
junior, highly recommended the serv
ice for students' legal needs.
"In a criminal case or any legal
issue, 1 would recommend that stu
dents get advice from the Legal
Counseling Office before searching
for or hiring a lawyer." she said.
"Legal services provides help for any
legal issue which includes criminal
charges because it is a General Coun
seling office. For whatever resources
they do not have in the immediate,
they will know where to direct and
guide a student."
However, the Legal Counseling
Office's official Web site appears to be
more geared toward prevention serv
ices rather than representation.
"The service is envisioned as the
first step for any student who thinks
that he or she might have a legal prob
lem," the Web site stated. "When pos
sible, the attorneys advise 'preventive
