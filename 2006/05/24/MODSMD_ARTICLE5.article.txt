# Students protest Paytan tenure choice
## Popular science prof. receives wave of student support 
### MELISSA FUSCO STAFF WRITER 
The recent denial of tenure to Adina
Patyan, a popular assistant Geological and
Environmental Sciences professor, has
stumped undergraduate and graduate stu
dents alike. As a result, a growing number of
students, staff and friends are petitioning to
have the decision reconsidered.
Paytan was notified of the decision on May
8 and the resulting controversy has sparked a
flurry of email petitions and letter-writing
campaigns within the department and even
the Graduate Student Council. These letters,
addressed to Provost John Etchemendy and

Dean of the School of Earth Sciences Pamela
Matson, request that Prof. Paytan's case for
tenure he reviewed again.
Hie letter from the GSC. sent on May 17,
emphasized Stanford's stated commitment to
faculty mentorship.
"Dr. Paytan has positively influenced, en
couraged and supported graduate women in
almost every science department on campus,
including those departments with a dearth of
female faculty mentors," the letter read. "The
loss of such a prominent supporter will be
devastating to female graduate students in the
science and engineering programs at Stan
ford."
ITie letter was signed by four chairs and co
chairs from the Council.
