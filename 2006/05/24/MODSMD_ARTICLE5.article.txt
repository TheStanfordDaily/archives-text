# Students protest Paytan tenure choice
## Popular science prof. receives wave of student support 
### MELISSA FUSCO STAFF WRITER 
The recent denial of tenure to Adina
Patyan, a popular assistant Geological and
Environmental Sciences professor, has
stumped undergraduate and graduate stu
dents alike. As a result, a growing number of
students, staff and friends are petitioning to
have the decision reconsidered.
Paytan was notified of the decision on May
8 and the resulting controversy has sparked a
flurry of email petitions and letter-writing
campaigns within the department and even
the Graduate Student Council. These letters,
addressed to Provost John Etchemendy and

Dean of the School of Earth Sciences Pamela
Matson, request that Prof. Paytan's case for
tenure he reviewed again.
Hie letter from the GSC. sent on May 17,
emphasized Stanford's stated commitment to
faculty mentorship.
"Dr. Paytan has positively influenced, en
couraged and supported graduate women in
almost every science department on campus,
including those departments with a dearth of
female faculty mentors," the letter read. "The
loss of such a prominent supporter will be
devastating to female graduate students in the
science and engineering programs at Stan
ford."
ITie letter was signed by four chairs and co
chairs from the Council.

Assistant Geological and Environmental Sciences Prof.
Adina Paytan was recently denied tenure, a decision that
sparked outcry from students and faculty.
with Paytan, also wrote a letter to the
provost and dean, listing her
achievements.
One of five female faculty in a de
partment of 19 total, Paytan special
izes in paleoceanology and marine
biogeochemistry and has authored
more than 40 scientific papers. For
these reasons — including several
prestigious awards in her fields of in
terest — her rejection came as a
complete surprise, students said.
She has also proved a valuable
advocate for the advancement of
women in the science, having sub
mitted a letter to the journal Science
on "Gender Differences and Perfor
mance in Science" in tandem with a
number of other well-known aca
demics. The letter appeared as a joint
response to Harvard President
Lawrence Summer's now infamous
remark that women are naturally
less talented in technical subjects.
During her time on campus, Pay
tan has also served as co-chair of the
Palo Alto Chapter of American
Women in Science and has volun
teered with the Expanding Your
Horizons Network — a nonprofit
organization promoting math and
science learning for women and girls
— as well as GeoKids.
"The only conclusion is that there
was no reason for the GES faculty to
deny her tenure based on her merits,
leaving the outsider to conjecture,"
Weislogel's letter stated."lt does not
look good for Stanford or the de
partment to dismiss such a high-cal
iber and world-class scientist on
what can only be grounds other than
her outstanding and impressive ac

complishments."
In an interview with The Daily,
Weislogel said, "We're all quite
amazed and shocked by this whole
situation."
Tracy Terry, a fifth-year chemistry
graduate student and the natural sci
ences representative on the GSC's
Diversity Committee, has also
joined the campaign in support of
Paytan.
Terry emphasized the need for
supportive female faculty members,
particularly in Paytan's department.
"The Graduate Student Council
Diversity Committee recently con
ducted a survey of graduate students
on the climate for women and mi
norities," Terry explained. "Gradu
ate students contributed particularly
negative and hostile responses on
the climate for women in the School
of Earth Sciences, and Adina has
been very active in encouraging
women scientists on campus."
Paytan's case has spurred support
within both the graduate and under
graduate communities at Stanford.
Senior Ellen Gray, who will co
term in the department next year,
worked with Paytan for two consec
utive summers on research and
wrote an honors thesis under her su
pervision. She praised her adviser's
work with undergraduates and her
focus on encouraging budding re
searchers.
"Adina is one of the few profes
sors that has undergrads working in
the lab during the year," Gray said,
adding that Paytan encouraged her
to present her work at several pro
fessional conferences this year.
When questioned about the deci
sion. Etchemendy said, "Of course I
can't say anything about any specific
tenure case, past, present or future."
Matson did not provide comment
by press time.
