## The 						Nuclear Meltdown that is Yucca Mountain An exclusive on-site report weighing the controversy 
### 
YUCCA MOUNTAIN. Nevada, — A war is
being fought, and the frontline is here in the
rugged desert 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas.
It is a high-stakes fight about nuclear energy,
state's rights and the future of a mountain. It is a
debate that has pitted well-heeled nuclear in
dustry lobbyists and the power of the federal

government against environmentalists and an
increasingly powerful Nevada congressional
delegation.
The project plan is massive: at least 60 miles of
tunnel and 77,(XM) cubic tons of nuclear waste
weaved through a 1,400 acre labyrinth. But the De
partment of Energy (DOE) has spent almost $8
billion dollars over more than two decades, yet has
nothing to show but a five-mile starter tunnel and
tens of millions of pages in paperwork.
A mix of Energy Department mistakes, high
profile scandals, sketchy science and a determined

opposition has mired government plans to estab
lish Yucca Mountain as the permanent under
ground repository for America's nuclear waste —
the spent fuel that can no longer be turned into en
ergy hut remains radioactive.
Hie federal government has respected scien
tists on its payroll. These civil servants and private
contractors publish studies that conclude the site
would be safe. On the other hand. Nevada has its
own credible experts to throw water on every fed
eral claim.They call the site untenable, the science
unrealistic and the safety risks significant.
