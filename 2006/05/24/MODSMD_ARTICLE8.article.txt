Debate over Yucca Mountain has pitted Nevadans who
feel hoodwinked by the project against a federal gov
ernment searching for a place to put nuclear waste. For
Nevada politicians, denouncing Yucca Mountain has become
almost ritualistic. Nevada hasn't produced a single barrel of
nuclear waste on its own accord, they say.
Some point to opposition to Yucca as the classic manifesta
tion of the so-called Not In My Backyard (NIMBY) mentali
ty, where locals acknowledge that undesirable sites must go
somewhere but dispute their placement near where they live.
For example. Robert Loux, director of the Nevada Agency
for Nuclear Projects, said that the process of selecting Neva
da tostore nuclear waste was"l(X) percent political." And the
1987 Congressional bill focusing attention on Yucca as a
planned underground repository for nuclear waste is referred
to as the 'Screw Nevada' bill in the parlance of local civic lead
ers and journalists.
A major worry for locals about the project is the impact
the waste could have on the tourism industry.
"Thirty million people come to Southern Nevada from all
over the world every year," said David Cherry, the press sec
retary for Rep. Shelley Berkley (D-Nev.)."They don't want to
think they are sitting next to the biggest pile of nuclear waste
ever conceived."
Critics of the project were given ammunition when sever
al emails sent between two scientists at the USGS between
1998 and 2000 became public in March 2005. Ibe memos in
cluded criticisms of safety standards and one scientist indicat
ed that he might have to fabricate additional date.'llie scan
dal has been called 'Emailgate' by some local politicians.
Rep. Jon Porter (R-NV) chaired a subcommittee investi
gation into the emails. His committee concluded that Yucca
Mountain was plagued by serious flaws. A Government Ac
countability Office report requested by Porter spelled out
shortcomings in the data underlying the project.
"The whole email scandal all goes back to the science of the
project on water infiltration," said T. J. Crawford, Porter's com
munications director. "There have been problems at every
level â€” the science, quality assurance and management."
"It's inappropriate for the Department of Eenergy to push
forward with a positive, feel-good PR campaign when [Secre
tary of Energy Samuel] Bodman himself has called the proj
ect broken," he said.
Though no criminal charges will be filed in the case, that
does not mean ethical codes of conduct weren't ignored, said
Sharyn Stein, a spokeswoman for Senate Minority Leader
Harry Reid (D-Nev.)
"The falsifying of data at Yucca Mountain is part of a long
string of mismanagement and incompetence by the DOE in
trying to create the Yucca Mountain site," she said.
Officials tried to distance the emails from the project by
saying they were written by rogue employees.
"The emails were given to the media by us," said Charlie
Germack.a Bechtel spokesman and the lead guide on the Sat
urday tour."We gave the information to them. We could have
deleted the emails or swept them under the rug, but we
brought them forward."
The project elicits as much passion as any other hot-button
issue among voters in the state. Miss Nevada, Crystal Wosik,
received death threats in January after she was quoted in the
Reno Gazette-Journal as saying that the state should open
Yucca Mountain and "take one for the team."
The state's leaders have adamantly fought the construc
tion of a repository on their land. No one wants to be remem
bered as the Congressman who allowed Yucca Mountain to
be established on their watch.The state has spent $ 100 million
on lawyers and scientists since 1983 trying to stop the project,
according to Loux.
The one exception to the uniform opposition is the small

town of Caliente, where the promise of a new railroad has
helped garner the mayor's support.
Reid, for his part, has tried everything in his attempt to
cancel the program. As a freshman senator, he set a record for
one of the longest filibusters in the history of the Senate in op
position to the project.
For the congressional delegation, the problem is that big
ger states are ganging up on Nevada. Politicians in states
where the nuclear waste gets produced face political pressure
from their own constituents to move it someplace else. Still,
safe transportation of this waste from current storage sites to
Yucca presents a plethora of logistical challenges and, for
some, raises safety issues. Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.) tried to
use these concerns to overcome Nevada's problem of being
outnumbered by personally lobbying members of Congress
whose districts would be used to transport the waste.
But Nevada state officials believe that the project is quick
ly disintegrating and predict that it will not make it far enough
to be an issue in the next campaign.The Department of Ener
gy (DOE) no longer offers a timeline for when the project
might be completed. The earliest possible time that the site
might accept waste would be 2015, most officials said, but it
would likely be closer to 2020.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) still needs to
officially approve the government's license requests to con
struct and use the repository. The application process would
take a minimum of three to four years to gain approval,
spokesmen for both sides said.
Officials continue to use every legal and political tool in
their arsenal to hinder the project, delay its timetable and
drive the government to attrition. Several lawsuits have been
filed to delay or stop the project. And more litigation will cer
tainly come if the project continues to move forward.
If the project does make it to the NRC license application
process, Loux said yesterday that the state will continue to
fight the project at every turn.
"We will be challenging virtually every aspect of the proj
ect before the NRC," he said.
But most state leaders, including Loux, do not believe the
DOE will even file an application with the regulatory agency
to continue work on the mountain.
"The writing is on the wall," he said."lt's on life support. It
is only a matter of time before the plug gets pulled. But I think
most people think its going to happen fairly soon."
Senators who have traditionally supported Yucca Moun
tain chided DOE for a lack of progress at a May 16 hearing of
the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
"I'm not here to pour water on anybody's parade, but at
what point do we think we need to look at something else?"
asked Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), according to a report in the
Las Vegas Review-Journal.
While some Congressmen have begun to sour on the idea
of using Yucca, the nuclear industry has been forceful in lob
bying Republican congressional allies to stand behind the
project, largely because they need the waste to go somewhere
and no other permanent repository site is even in the pipeline.
"The nuclear industry has been so loathe giving up the one
bird they have," Cherry said.
The Bush administration wants new Congressional legis
lation that would put the project on a trajectory for comple
tion. But if they can't swing Yucca Mountain, the nuclear in
dustry will look somewhere else to store the waste, observers
guess.
The Energy Department has been investigating potential
new locations where waste might be temporarily stored while
the project here develops.
"If this site is not chosen, they'll pick up the marbles and go
somewhere else," said U.S. Geological Survey geologist
David Bush.
