# NEVADANS DON'T KNOW WHO TO TRUST
## State, federal officials debate project's long-term safety, consequences 
### 
The debate over Yucca Mountain comes at a
time when nuclear power has come back into
vogue. As memories of Three Mile Island and
Chernobyl fade, nuclear power has come to be seen
by many as an attractive policy option to respond to
rising gas prices, global warming, and the country's
dependence of foreign sources of fuel.
President Bush called for a renewed investment in
nuclear energy during his State of the Union address
in January. Moderate Republican Christine Todd
Whitman, the former director of the EPA, and
Patrick Moore, a co-founder of Greenpeace, have
come out in favor of nuclear power. Even the edito
rial board of The New York Tunes acknowledged re
cently that there might be some value in reconsider
ing nuclear energy.
The resurging popularity of nuclear power
makes the need for a long-term solution for waste
storage all the more important. In 1982, the federal
government made a promise to the flagging nuclear
industry that it would store the waste produced by
nuclear power plants. In 1987, Congress ordered the
Department of Energy to focus exclusively on de
veloping Yucca Mountain as the permanent under
ground repository for the toxic waste currently
stored above ground at 131 facilities in 39 other
states. Nuclear power produces about 20 percent of
this nation's electricity.
A senior reactor operator at the Exelon nuclear
power plant in Byron, 111. came to Las Vegas with his
wife for the tour and concluded that the site is suit
able and the technology is sound. He said it was time
for the government to fulfill its promise to his indus
try.
"It's a commitment the government made to the
utilities way back when, and government needed to
fulfill that obligation," he said.
Anti-nuclear activists, in contrast, fear the place
ment of nuclear waste in a permanent repository will
cement the status quo of nuclear power and encour
age the industry's expansion.
Amidst this ongoing ideological struggle, barbs
have been thrown between the federal government
and the State of Nevada on the practical efficacy of
the project. The Energy Department has spent mil
lions of dollars on an aggressive public relations
campaign in order to win the hearts and minds of
Nevadans. Three visitors' centers full of colorful
displays about the project, aimed at persuading a
reluctant population that the mountain would be a
safe place to store the waste, dot the southern half
of the state.

The Department conducts between 2(K) to 3(X) pri
vate tours each year for technical organizations and
elected officials, according to Colleen Curran, a
spokesperson for the Bechtel SAIC consortium, the
largest private contractor involved in the Yucca proj
ect. In contrast, the general public is only let into the
high-security site once every other month.
State officials criticized the tours as a last ditch at
tempt of a desperate government to sell a reluctant
people on a bad project.
"There's no purpose for these tours except to con
vince the public this is the greatest thing since sliced
bread," said Robert Loux, director of the Nevada
Agency for Nuclear Projects.
Curran disagrees.
"It's one of the most open and transparent gov
ernment projects ever." she promised at the begin
ning of the day, foreshadowing the over-confident
safety pronouncements issued throughout our tour.
"You'll find the people you talk with open, profes
sional and willing to answer all of your questions.
"Yucca Mountain is the most studied real estate in
the world," Curran added.
Indeed,one room at the visitor center is filled with
thousands of publicly-available documents. But, on
this apparently transparent tour, no cameras, binocu
lars, recording equipment, GPS devices or camera
phones are allowed. There are also important areas
of the highly controversial project the public was not
taken to see. When I visited Yucca on a tour for the
general public, at one desert checkpoint our buses
were boarded by armed guards clad in dessert cam
ouflage fatigues and the security credentials of each
passenger were scrutinized.
Still, in spite of — or perhaps because of—the
limited access, impressions seemed to be positive.
After more than a dozen interviews on the bus dur
ing the return trip, indications seemed to be that the
Energy Department was simply preaching to the
choir. The tour participants who I interviewed said
they were either leaning toward supporting strongly
supportive of the site when they came. After a full
day of briefings, the visitors each said that Yucca
Mountain seemed safe enough for them.
"It makes a big difference when you see it for
yourself," said Chet Hayes, who recently moved to
Nevada and said he wanted to see "what all the fuss
was about."
Some criticized the tour as too technical and not
big-picture enough.
"Everyone seems pretty professional," said Russ
Johnson, a retiree and Las Vegas resident. "Some of
the displays and people probably gave more techni
cal information that they needed to."
A few hoped they would see more.
"From a curiosity standpoint. I wish we could have
gone deeper into the tunnel," said Amy Downey, a
Las Vegas resident who supports the project.
The debate continues to rage between Nevada's
and the federal government's scientists over whether
Yucca will be a safe receptacle of nuclear waste. But
at least, the few ordinary citizens allowed to visit the
site were satisfied — when they saw the federal gov
ernment's side, at least.
