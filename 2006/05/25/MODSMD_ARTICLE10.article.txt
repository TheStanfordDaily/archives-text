# SPECIAL EVENT
## Town hall on Iraq draws few 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
The Office of Religious Life sponsored a University-wide
town hall meeting called "Iraq: Where Do We Go From
Here?" yesterday afternoon in Kresge Auditorium. Despite
email publicity effort, student turnout at the event was low.
Scotty McLennan, dean of Religious Life, served as the
event's moderator. He was joined by Abbas Milani, a profes
sor of political science and a member of the Hoover Institu
tion, and Allen Weiner, a professor at the Law School.
According to McLennan, the goal of the meeting was to
"marshal our resources beyond partisan differences and help
policy makers envision a just and lasting peace in Iraq."
"Instead of debating whether we should have gotten into
this war in the first place, this forum is designed as an oppor
tunity to ask together: Where should we go from here in
Iraq?" he said.
After McLennan's introduction. Milani and Weiner each
delivered a 15 minute opening speech.
Milani began his statement with a Persian proverb, which
he related to the United States' situation in Iraq.
"It takes one fool to throw a stone in a well; it takes 100
wise men to get it out," he said. He went on to say that trying
to figure out a way for the United States to get out of Iraq is
not an easy task.
He disputed the notion that complex issues have simple
solutions and emphasized the need for local knowledge —
more programs devoted to and people interested in Middle
Eastern studies.

Political science professor and Hoover Institution fellow Abbas Milani listens to speak
ers from the audience at last night's University-wide town hall meeting on Iraq.
Weiner spoke about his frustra
tion and anger regarding the use of
force in Iraq, which he said was insti
tuted "with neither particularly
sound legal justification nor policy
rationale."
He posed several questions to the
audience, attempting to provide an
swers yet admitting that many of the
questions about Iraq need to be ex
plored further.
Following Weiner's statement,
McLennan opened the floor to com
ments from audience members.
Several attendees emphasized
the need for the United States to
leave Iraq as quickly as possible.
"Iraqis do not want foreigners in
their country telling them what to
do," said Robert Polhemus. an Fng
lish professor.
Many also criticized the current
administration.
"The Bush administration has,
with infinite arrogance, destroyed a

once functioning country," said com
munity member Rochelle Marshall.
ITiese sentiments were echoed by
others.
Another local resident, Bud Con
rad, said he is "bitterly angry about
what our government has done,"
and Religious Studies Prof. Linda
Hess remarked that "we need to
capture the White House and Con
gress to succeed."
Sophomore Ben Henretig called
for Bush's impeachment.
"I'd just like to see some degree
of accountability in the U.S. because
I think that's paramount to pushing
anything forward in Iraq," he said.
Other attendees such as Fernan
do Gomez, a second-year doctoral
student in electrical engineering,
expressed support for the invasion
of Iraq.
Another audience member em
phasized the need to learn from the
role the U.S. played in Germany and
Japan following World War 11, which
he deemed an American success.
"If we don't stay and do the same
humanitarian and democratic re
forms [in Iraq] that we did after
World War 11. we will reap the terri

ble whirlwind forever," he said.
Milani and Weiner then each of
fered responses to the audience's
comments.
For his part, Milani emphasized
that leaving Iraq immediately is not
a possibility.
"If the U.S. suddenly leaves this
chaos that has been created, there
will be enormous bloodshed." said
Milani, explaining that he supports a
benchmark system, by which the
U.S. can gradually withdraw troops
from Iraq, as a positive first step.
Weiner, like Milani. said that he
does not advocate immediate with
drawal.
I le referenced the United States'
interest in energy supplies in the
Middle East and called for explo
ration of alternative energy sources
to reduce reliance on the region's
oil.
Following the meeting, McLen
nan remarked that despite the lack
of consensus, the meeting was valu
able nonetheless.
"A number of us feel an urgency
about what's happening in Iraq and
want the University to apply its re
sources," he said. "What's needed is

real expertise instead of profound
misunderstanding of the history,
politics and realities of the region.
"It is the critical issue for our
country now," he added. "We've
been concerned about how much
student engagement there is in the
issue — you know, not very much "
Students gave mixed reviews of
the event.
"I was hoping it'd be well-attend
ed, especially by students, and I was
very disappointed about that," said
Aubrey Munoz, a sophomore."But I
thought in general the speakers pro
vided very balanced views,and I def
initely heard new perspectives on
what's going on in Iraq. It was re
freshing to have expert viewpoints
on these very complicated issues."
Gomez disagreed, calling the
meeting biased.
"It should have been advertised
as the anti-war talk of Iraq or some
thing like that because it was not re
ally balanced." he said. "Both speak
ers were very knowledgeable and I
appreciate that, but even if they
tried to be pragmatic about the fu
ture, they were clearly biased
against the war"
