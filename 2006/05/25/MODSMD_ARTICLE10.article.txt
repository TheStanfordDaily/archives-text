# SPECIAL EVENT
## Town hall on Iraq draws few 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
The Office of Religious Life sponsored a University-wide
town hall meeting called "Iraq: Where Do We Go From
Here?" yesterday afternoon in Kresge Auditorium. Despite
email publicity effort, student turnout at the event was low.
Scotty McLennan, dean of Religious Life, served as the
event's moderator. He was joined by Abbas Milani, a profes
sor of political science and a member of the Hoover Institu
tion, and Allen Weiner, a professor at the Law School.
According to McLennan, the goal of the meeting was to
"marshal our resources beyond partisan differences and help
policy makers envision a just and lasting peace in Iraq."
"Instead of debating whether we should have gotten into
this war in the first place, this forum is designed as an oppor
tunity to ask together: Where should we go from here in
Iraq?" he said.
After McLennan's introduction. Milani and Weiner each
delivered a 15 minute opening speech.
Milani began his statement with a Persian proverb, which
he related to the United States' situation in Iraq.
"It takes one fool to throw a stone in a well; it takes 100
wise men to get it out," he said. He went on to say that trying
to figure out a way for the United States to get out of Iraq is
not an easy task.
He disputed the notion that complex issues have simple
solutions and emphasized the need for local knowledge â€”
more programs devoted to and people interested in Middle
Eastern studies.
