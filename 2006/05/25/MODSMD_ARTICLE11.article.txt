### NICK PARKER DESK EDITOR 
The Graduate Student Council (GSC) met
last night to discuss the Graduation Pledge and
to approve next year's special-fees budget.
For the bulk of the meeting, the Council dis
cussed the Graduation Pledge, a national online
petition that promotes social and environmental
responsibility among graduating students. Matt
Nicodemus founded the pledge at Humboldt

State University in 1987.
Students for a Sustainable Stanford has spon
sored the pledge at Stanford in past years, but
with other projects on its agenda this spring, the
group was unable to continue its support. As a
result, Nicodemus turned to the GSC for help.
Council members discussed the pledge's
goals before considering the possibility of spon
soring it. ultimately deciding that it was too late
this year for the GSC to take any further action.
"It's obviously too late this year, but maybe
it'd be a good idea to bring up the pledge in the
fall when we have some new students," said Tom
Lee. a fourth-year graduate student in electrical
engineering and former co-chair of the GSC.
Other Council members suggested that, in fu

ture years, Nicodemus bring up the issue earlier.
"Our best response is to say that we brought
it up and there wasn't enough interest to sponsor
it and that maybe next year he should ask us ear
lier," said GSC Co-Chair Paul Gurney, a gradu
ate student in electrical engineering."We can tell
him we'll think about it again in September."
After discussing the Graduation Pledge, the
GSC moved on to next year's special-fees budg
et. Justin Fishner-Wolfson, the outgoing chief ex
ecutive officer and financial manager of Stan
ford Student Enterprises, told the Council that
special fees will cost graduate students approxi
mately $30 per quarter next year.
The GSC unanimously approved the budget
by a vote of 8-0-0.
