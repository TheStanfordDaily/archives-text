### LESLIE GEORGATOS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Faculty Club's Gold Lounge
played host last night to a ceremony
honoring the 12 awardees for this
year's Boothe Prize for Excellence in
Writing.
According to the award's Web site.
"The Boothe prizes recognize and re
ward outstanding examples of exposi
tory and argumentative writing of first
year students in the Program in Writ
ing and Rhetoric (PWR) and the In
troduction to the Humanities program
(IHUM)."
The prizes, which have been award
ed annually since 1981. are made possi
ble by an endowment from the late D.
Power Boothe Jr.. Class of 1931, and
his wife Catie. Each spring, an award
ceremony is held to recognize the win
ners from the preceding spring, fall and
winter quarters.
At last night's event, the six winners
— three each from the PWR and
IHUM programs — were accompa
nied by the six students awarded hon
orable mention. IHUM teaching fel
lows, PWR 1 instructors and various
faculty members and guests joined the
students in celebration.
Gabriel Moyer, a teaching fellow in
PWR and one of this year's editors of
the compilation "Boothe Prize Essays:
Excellence in Writing at Stanford," —
the annual publication in which the 12
students' essays are featured — ex
plained how the prize-winning pieces
were selected.
"We look for essays that engage
with rhetoric in new and provocative
ways," she said. "We look for students
who invent their own styles and whose
writing breaks the bounds of tradition
al essays."
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education John Bravman spoke
briefly before and after the ceremony,
during which many of the honorees'
teachers presented the awards and
spoke about their students' writing.
All 12 received a copy of the River
side Edition of the "Complete Works
of Shakespeare" and a Boothe Prize

certificate. Honorees also received a
cash prize.
Scott Herndon, who teaches PWR,
taught four of this year's recipients. He
said a particular style was typical of the
award winners.
"Surprisingly they tend to be qui
eter than others," he said. "They pos
sess great attention to detail, a real de
sire to figure things out and a determi
nation to set their own agendas."
Freshman Sarah Johnson, whose
essay "Breaking the Watch Along With
the Wedding Glass: Conceptions of
Time in the Transition from Biblical to
Rabbinic Judaism" won the I HUM
prize for winter 2(X)6, explained how
her essay shaped her academic inter
ests.
"1 have no background in religion,
so I was shocked to find out I had been
nominated," she said. "But taking this
class has made me consider a minor in
religion."
A few of D. Power Boothe's rela
tives also attended the ceremony and
said they looked forward to reading
the essays.
"We've read all the essays from the
past years," said one. "There are some
especially fascinating topics this year."
Moyer said that this year's collec
tion of essays may have been the best
the committee has ever seen.
"This year's writing excels far be
yond previous years," she said.
All of this year's pieces were re
cently published and distributed in
book form to attendees at the ceremo
ny.
This year's honorees in PWR were
sophomore Kimber Lockhart and
freshmen Jennifer Chin and Cecelia
Yang. They are joined by honorable
mention winners Nick Parker, a soph
omore, and freshmen Matthew Grib
ble and Aaron Quiggle.
IHUM winners were sophomore
Jessica Lee and freshmen Patrick
Leahy and Sarah Johnson. They are
complemented by honorable mention
winners Julie Byren, a sophomore, and
Nathan Pflueger and Jason Dunford,
both freshmen.
A list of the 12 winners and copies
of their prize-winning essays will he
