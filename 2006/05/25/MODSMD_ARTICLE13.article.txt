## Stern staff, veggie options a nice treat 
### 
Unlike many of their friends and classmates who
graduated last quarter, currently basking in
the glory of Camp Stanford, Louk and Liebn
er stay busy with their theses, final design projects, and,
of course, bustling dorm life. Feeling like parents of
two-year-old triplets who can only afford an hour's
worth of babysitting time from the restless teen subur
banite who only works enough to keep her pot brown
ies spiced, these hummus-hungry harvesters settled for
the close-by Stern Dining for this week's review.
Louk, struggling through a tough week in Thesis
topia, was craving Stern's famous nacho bar. His
dreams oozed with a vision of melted cheese, crispy tri
colored corn chips and fresh salsa. But as he loaded up
his bowl with chips, he noted that there was no cheese!
What is a nacho bar without cheese? Moaning a little
on the inside, he desperately turned to the well
stocked salad bar, in hopes that the cheese of his
dreams merited some real estate there. Finding none,
he made a last attempt near the "vegan roasted chili
and black bean soup" — doesn't everyone enjoy chili
with cheese and perhaps some cornbread? But alas,
the soup stood alone.The dinner that was to be a bright
spot in an otherwise dismal week of feverish writing
was quickly losing its luster.
But suddenly, as if from thin air,a woman appeared,
in a fine black dress suit, mopping up the counter next
to the salad bar. "Need something, dears?" she
prompted us. It was Amanda Gotthold, Stern Dining
supervisor, whose face beams from a poster like a
lighthouse from the shore as famished students drag
their weary bodies in for their daily sustenance. Was
she the fairy godmother to our Cinderella?
"Do you have any cheese?" Louk asked, voice
trembling for fear of yet another disappointment.
"Cheese? Certainly!" And she pulled from behind
the counter the biggest bag of shredded cheddar and
mozzarella mix this side of Costco. With a heartfelt
word of "thanks," Louk and Liebner rejoiced, and
their journey to discover the veggie delights at Stern
continued as planned.
As Louk prepared his nachos. Liebner scoured the
salad bar and found — aside from an impressive array
of mixed greens — young spinach leaves, eggs, corn,
tomatoes, cucumber and the other staples of dining
hall salad bars, an exquisite black bean salad laced with
just enough cayenne to tingle the tongue. Louk, how
ever, found it too heavy on the sour cream and moved
on to the curry vegetables and rice pilaf.The curry had
just the right balance for his palate, and the potatoes
did not dominate the carrot and cauliflower, as other
veggie curries might.
The rice pilaf, although clearly made with instant
rice instead of the healthier brown rice (bring on the
food snobbery!), paired easily with both the curry and
the five-spice vegetable and tofu marsala. While Lieb
ner stood, serving spoon in hand, puzzling the precise
meaning of "marsala," Louk strode off to find that icon
of meat alternatives: the veggie burger. Whereas Bran
ner had responded to this polite inquiry with vacant
stares and inarticulate "what?". Stern served up the
meat-free patty in a red plastic basket, on a toasted
sesame bun, with lettuce, tomato.onion and pickle and
a fancy party toothpick waving a paper American flag.
Who says you gotta eat meat to be patriotic?
Liebner dug into another good ol' comfort food —
macaroni and cheese — but found the cheese too
thick and the noodles too overcooked to merit a sec
ond bite,despite the delicious crunchy cheesy topping.
A platter of open-faced vegetable panini cloaked in
melted mozzarella beckoned at the far end of the
servery.The diverse grilled toppings of zucchini, toma
to, carrot, squash, onion, basil and sweet potato
seemed promising, but they were overcooked and sat
atop a layer of strong olive tapenade.
After satiating their curiosity and appetites at the
satellite stations of the servery. Louk and Liebner
gravitated toward the specialty section, the center
piece of the dining hall.Tonight, the special was whole
wheat pasta with Thai green curry, mizuna greens, shi
itake mushrooms and apple ginger chutney. DANG.
Two fast-moving and hard-working chefs in crisp
white toques prepared the dish fish, with or without
chicken according to individual specification, as diners
queued up. Louk and Liebner agreed that it was a re
freshing break from the college cuisine status quo. And
although she hated to speak negatively of such a dish,
Liebner, who has never quite gotten along with mush
rooms, thought the strong taste of shiitake overpow
ered the Thai green curry.
Louk and Liebner had sat down to eat with eight
bowls of different veggie delectables, and by the time
those vessels were empty, the dining duo was almost
too full to stand up from their seats. But, and this is a
big but, ladies and gents. Stern was serving Liebner's
all-time favorite dessert: the cookies'n'creani froyo. It
was going to be hard to muster up that dessert appetite,
but it's all in a night's work for a Daily food columnist.
So. Stern: well done! Not the best variety of protein
options, but it was good eatin'. Here's the score:
3.5 blocks of tofu
0 bowls of cereal
