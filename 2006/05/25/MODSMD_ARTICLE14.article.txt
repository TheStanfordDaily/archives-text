# TURNED AWAY at the Bank
## 
### Written By MARIE-JO MONT-REYNAUD 
If last week's article piqued your in
terest about blood donation, and you
ran to the nearest blood ready to get
poked,you might have been turned away
for a variety of health reasons.
Particularly at Stanford — Donor Re
cruitment Manager John Williams notes
— many people on campus travel abroad,
where they may be at risk of contracting
malaria or mad cow disease, conditions
that lead to denial of blood donations.
Another major cause for refusal is low
iron, Williams says, suggesting cream of
wheat as one of the best ways to increase
iron."Even better than spinach," he quips.
One limitation, however — the ban
on donation by gay men — has stirred up
controversy and even prompted students
to stage a protest in front of a blood mo
bile several months ago.
When they are screened before dona
tion, females are asked if they have had
sex with any men who have had sex with
other men. and male contributors are
asked if they have ever had sex with an
other man. If the answer is yes. they are
turned away from donation.
While many gay men refuse to volun
teer their sexuality during this question
ing, others consider it a form of discrimi
nation.
The regulation was originally institut
ed by the Blood Product Advisory Com
mittee (BPAC), a part of the Food and
Drug Administration. In 1983, at the
height of the AIDS crisis — when it was
still considered a predominantly gay dis
ease— the BPAC recommended a ban
on blood donations from gay men. The

restriction prohibits
any man who has had sex
with another man since 1977
from donating blood for the rest
of his life.

The ban was partially justified at
the time because the technology to test
the blood was not yet available, explains
first-year law student Andrew Bruck.
who has conducted extensive research
on the topic.
However, he added, "We now have
nucleic acid testing which detects the
virus itself in the body. It is much more ac
curate and can detect it within 10 days."
Bruck said he believes this testing can
now significantly, if not completely, reduce
the risk of transferring HIV in donated
blood, but that the FDA is not examining
the available medical data on this topic in
its consideration of the gay ban.
Moreover, the way in which the FDA
limits gay men from donating, as com
pared to other populations, reveals cer
tain inconsistencies.
"There is simply no rational basis for
denying men who have had sexual con
tact even once with another man, yet
anyone else, despite potentially far more
risky sexual behavior, is free to donate
— the policy only bans men who've had
sex with a prostitute in the last year."
says Spencer Jones, a second-year law
student and co-president of OutLaw, the
law student group that focuses on gay
rights issues. "From our perspective, the
policy remains in place solely out of ani
mus and misconceptions regarding gay
men or, just as bad, inadequate research
and science."

T There is a light at the
end of the tunnel, howev
er, for activists like Bruck and

Jones, thanks to the support of
several national organizations. In

March, the Red Cross, the American
Association of Blood Banks and Ameri
ca's Blood Centers — the three largest
blood banks in the United States — is
sued a joint statement to the FDA rec
ommending a change to the current poli
cy and declaring the current lifetime de
ferral for men who have had sex with
other men to be "medically and scientifi
cally unwarranted."
As it stands, the ban is still in place,
and the Stanford Blood Bank continues
to screen for homosexual activity despite
advances in technology.
"It's sexual profiling," says a male
sophomore who asked to remain anony
mous. "Maybe there's a higher risk, but if
they can prove that they're healthy just
like anyone who is heterosexual, then
there's no reason to stop them from do
nating."
Susan Galel. the director of clinical
operations at the Stanford Blood Center,
disagrees.
"The majority of new HIV cases are
still occurring in people with male-to
male sexual activity. I think that's where
there is some misconception." she says.
"There are some people who think it is
no longer a risk and therefore advocate
no deferral at all.The data that I've seen
from public health agencies suggest that
homosexuality should still be consid
ered a risk.
"Nationwide, between 2(XX) and 2(K)3,

male-to-male sex accounts for 61 percent
of HIV cases," she adds, citing a Center
for Disease Control report.
The three blood banks that recom
mended policy changes to the FDA were
not suggesting abolition of the regula
tion, rather a shift to a temporary ban fol
lowing homosexual activity in place of
the lifetime ban.
"They recommend temporary defer
ral like every other HIV-risk activity,"
Galel explains. "The reason for the tem
porary deferral is because the tests do
not become positive immediately after
risk behavior. [Within one year] the
blood could pass tests but still carry the
infectious agent."
For this reason, she said she believes
that the FDA would not be very recep
tive to removing the restriction entirely.
The ban has a significant impact in an
environment where blood is in such
short supply.
FDA medical officer Andrew Dayton
estimates that there are 62,300 men who
want to donate blood but are prohibited
from doing so under the current limita
tions.
"It seems inefficient and retrograde
for blood banks to deny a fairly large
amount of people and hence lose a large
bank of donations that could save some
one's life," says junior Katy Yan of Stan
ford's Queer/Straight Alliance.
"In my opinion, [the policy] promotes
a negative stereotype that all gay men
have AIDS, which is definitely not true "
she says."The criteria should be healthy
blood and should be blind to someone's
sexuality."
