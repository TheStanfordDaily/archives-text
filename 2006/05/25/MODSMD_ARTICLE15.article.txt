# SMYSP sees staggering success rate
## 
### DAVID STEINHARDT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford University's vast resources
should not be reserved for the rich and
fortunate.Thanks to programs like the na
tionally-renowned Stanford Medical
Youth Science Program (SMYSP). high
school students from low-income and eth
nically-diverse backgrounds are given a
very special opportunity here on campus
every year.
The SMYSP is a program run by Stan
ford's Medical School, which aims to sup
ply less-fortunate students with informa
tion on health and science professions and
opportunities in higher education. The
program's mission is to enrich and diversi
fy the scientific world by offering students
unique exposure to the sciences, academ
ic enrichment, the possibility of attending
college and mentoring relationships.
The defining part of the program oc
curs each summer, when the SMYSP re
cruits 24 high school students for their
Residential Program. Hie students come
from more than 300 high schools across
Northern and Central California. For five
weeks, the students — many ethnic mi
norities included — live together on the

Stanford campus along with 10 under
graduates who serve as counselors.
The students spend their days attending
lectures on the latest scientific research,
working with doctors and other health pro
fessionals, learning from medical students
and ultimately completing their own re
search project. Students are also given col
lege counseling, information about finan
cial aid and SAT-test taking strategies.
'Plough the students are kept extreme
ly busy, they are provided with informa
tion that is not readily available at their
own schools or neighborhoods.
Mentoring relationships between the
students and faculty, staff and graduate
students often extend beyond the pro
gram. These volunteers commit one day a
week to the program and hail from both
Stanford and other colleges and universi
ties, as well as medical and health facilities
in the area.
Program Director Judith Ned exalted
the success of SMYSP.
"As our students are immersed in the
worlds of science, medicine and higher ed
ucation," she says, "college not only be
comes a personal reality but also a step
ping-stone to promoting change in their
communities."

Andrea Kwan, a senior and counselor
for the upcoming 2(X)6 summer program,
shares Ned's enthusiasm for the program.
"These students will be busy," she says.
"Yet, they are going to have the time of
their lives — participating in anatomy
labs, living on a college campus with other
high school students, going on field trips
to places such as Six Mags and so much
more. It is really a dream."
SMYSP began as a student-run organ
ization in 19K8. Since then, it has become
a University-based program that has
served over 4(X) students from Califor
nia. Many of the students coming from
diverse backgrounds have become suc
cessful with the help of their mentors and
the knowledge they gleaned from the
program.
One young man, Erik,grew up on pub
lic assistance and was a former gang mem
ber when he was accepted into SMYSP in
high school. He has since graduated with
honors from Stanford, worked at the Na
tional Institute of Health and is currently
in his third year of medical School at Stan
ford.
A young woman. Phuong, has a similar
success story. She was a refugee from Viet
nam who attended high school in Oak

land after she was separated from her
mother. She graduated from Harvard and
is currently in her third year of medical
school at Georgetown University.
Of the students who have attended
SMYSP, all have successfully graduated
high school, and 99 percent have been ad
mitted to college. However, the program
also accomplishes something deeper. It
gives students hope and allows them to
pursue interests that they would not have
had the resources to explore otherwise.
As Ned explains, "Many of our stu
dents' lives have been deeply affected by
hardship — from poverty and war to vio
lence and racial injustice. But somehow,
through it all, their determination, intel
lect and compassion have sustained them
to an interest in science and medicine."
She adds, "We are committed to ensur
ing that all students are given the oppor
tunity to recognize and reach their full po
tential. It is important to us that we show
our students that they can achieve, and
they are not alone in their journey to a
better life and higher education."
Ihe program is currently accepting ap
plications for mentors, and inquiries
should be sent to Andrea Kwan at
akwan2@stanford.edu.
