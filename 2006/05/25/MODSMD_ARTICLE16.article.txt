## Editorial Religious theme dorms: Why not? 
### 
Daily humorist Chris Holt first
broached the idea of having religious
theme dorms on campus ("That's not
a housing solution?" May 15). In his column.
Holt proposes that the Scientology house
"be located by an area with lots of fields for
UFO landings."
Far-fetched? Maybe. But in principle,
don't people from the same religious tradi
tions have the right to live together if they
choose to do so? Having religious theme
dorms would allow religious minorities on
campus to forge their own collective identi
ties and explore their common religious ex
periences.
But wait. How would that work out in
practice? We could perhaps start out with
Christian, Buddhist, Hindu, Jewish and
Muslim theme dorms? But would we have
just one Christian theme dorm? Might it be
better to have separate dorms for Roman
Catholics and Protestants? Should we go
further by having individual dorms for
Baptists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians,
Lutherans, Methodists, Evangelicals and
Liberals? How about a separate dorm for
Irish Catholics? Do we risk offending
other religions by not giving them a theme
dorm of their own? Should we have an
Atheist dorm?
Where would these religious theme
dorms be placed on campus? Converting ex
isting dorms into religious theme dorms
would be one option, but would take resi
dence options away from those who do not
identify with any particular religion. Would
new religious theme dorms have to be built
next to the Manzanita housing complex or
further down the Row?
Clearly, we are being facetious in suggest
ing the introduction of religious theme
dorms. By segregating the campus along re
ligious lines, religious theme dorms would
fracture an already fragmented student
body. Rather, the student body stands to gain
a lot more from the free exchange of reli

gious views amid the diversity of religious
perspectives found across all campus dorms.
ITiough this may be nothing more than a
thought experiment, the idea of religious
theme dorms opens up some space for us to
think more constructively about the way we
structure our residential communities.
Granted, there certainly are several key
differences between religion and ethnicity
— for instance, you can choose your religion
to some extent, but you can't change your
ethnicity. Also, ethnic communities have
demonstrated strong support for ethnic
theme dorms and resource centers, whereas
the interest in religious theme dorms has not
been as strong.
Yet we don't see how having religious
theme dorms is all that different from having
ethnic theme dorms on campus. After all,
there are those on campus who identify
more strongly with their religious identity
than with the color of their skin.
We are not making light of the tremen
dous work that various student groups put in
to develop strong communities on campus.
Neither are we dismissing the sincere efforts
of individual students to explore and assert
their various identities — racial, religious,
sexual or political.
Nevertheless, there has been a dearth of
public debate on theme dorms. Talking
about theme dorms is often taboo, even
though there is a silent group that is against
segregating campus into disparate commu
nities.
We acknowledge that the issues surround
ing theme dorms are too complex to explore
fully in an editorial. But we hope this editori
al brings to light some possible areas of de
bate concerning theme dorms. We encourage
the community to allow those who hold a neg
ative view toward theme dorms to voice their
opinions without being decried as bigoted
and racist. And we hope that the hypothetical
scenario put forward here will prompt more
open dialogue on these issues.
