# Breaking the law

Sometimes I think Bush has never read
the Constitution.
Last Sunday, Attorney General Alberto
Gonzalez appeared on ABC's "This Week"
to discuss a new opportunity this administra
tion has uncovered to silence its critics: Pros
ecute the press.
"There are some statutes on the book
which, if you read the language carefully,"
Gonzalez said, "would seem to indicate that
that is a possibility."
Gonzalez is referring to the Espionage Act
of 1917. That law was passed at the urging of
President Woodrow Wilson because he felt
the widespread dissent towards the American
involvement in World War I presented a na
tional security risk. The act criminalizes any
activity, speech or publication that could pos
sibly compromise national security or de
fense. Perhaps most notably, the law even
criminalizes receiving such information.
The lawstates:"Whoever,for the purpose
aforesaid, receives or obtains or agrees or at
tempts or induces or aids another to receive
or obtain from any other person, or from any
source whatever, any document, writing,
code book, signal b00k...0f anything con
nected with the national defense. [Writers or
newspapers that were found in violation of
the act] shall be punished by a fine of not
more than $1(),(XK), or by imprisonment for
not more than two years, or both."
The Act allowed Wilson's administration
to define what pieces of journalism were a
threat to the nation's security. The adminis
tration screened all journalistic materials
and articles that were deemed to be in viola
tion of this act were simply not published.
Approximately 75 periodicals were either
forced to cease their coverage of the war or
even removed from circulation.
The law is practically a legislative contra
diction of the first amendment: "Congress
shall make no law...abridging the freedom of
speech, or of the press." Thankfully, follow
ing World War I, Congress understood the
law's unconstitutionality and many aspects
of the act were repealed. The parts of the law
that remained have not been enforced be
cause of their unconstitutionality and, well,
absolute absurdity.
In fact, the only case being tried under
this law is about to be dismissed. The Justice
Department is currently prosecuting two
former American Israel Public Affairs Com
mittee lobbyists for "receiving" and "trans
mitting" information from a Defense De
partment official. The U.S. District judge
presiding over the case,T.S. Ellis 111, is now
considering throwing the case out because
of the law's vagueness and violation of the
First Amendment.
While the Decider and Gonzalez try to

disguise the law as a means of protecting our
national security, it is really just an attempt
to control the press. The law threatens the
press with prosecution for reporting on im
portant issues. Gonzalez carefully side
stepped the question of whether the admin
istration would pursue prosecutingThe New
York Times for breaking the story on NSA
wire-tapping. Gonzalez simply stated that
his office was determining "the appropriate
course of action in that particular case."
Gonzalez also carefully failed to mention
that this law has never been used to prose
cute journalists. Ever. Wilson's administra
tion simply pulled articles from publication
â€” they never filed any charges against jour
nalists. While the arcane act could be inter
preted to prosecute journalists, most legal
scholars argue that the act was never even
intended for that purpose.
But Gonzalez and the Decider think it is
their duty to use this legislation in that way.
"[lt's] a policy judgment by the Congress
in passing that kind of legislation," Gonzalez
said. "We have an obligation to enforce
those laws. We have an obligation to ensure
that our national security is protected."
It was also a "policy judgment" by Con
gress to recognize the absurdity of a law that
granted a wartime president entirely too
much power and to choose not to enforce it.
After all. the Constitution is fairly important
to this country.
But Gonzalez claims he understands the
importance of the First Amendment and the
Press. He just thinks the ability of the admin
istration to violate whatever civil liberty we
have left in the name of national security is
more important. In perhaps his most elo
quent lines, Gonzalez stated that the First
Amendment is important, just not that im
portant.
"It can't be the case that that right trumps
over the right that Americans would like to
see, the ability of the federal government to
go after criminal activity," he stated.
If breaking the story of a government
agency tapping our phones is "criminal ac
tivity," I would love to know what the De
cider thinks is good journalism. Perhaps
that's what Fox is for.
