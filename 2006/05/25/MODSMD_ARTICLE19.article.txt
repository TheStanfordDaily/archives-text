# A 						Modern Day Fairytale
## The 						pros and cons of being home 
### 
By the time this issue first hits campus, I
will have been back in America for ap
proximately 24 hours, virtually all of
which will have been spent awake, in the
merciless clutches of jet lag.
Though I haven't been away all that long,
it's still strange how quickly I was reab
sorbed into the space 1 used to occupy;
rather than feeling any kind of reverse cul
ture shock, 1 cannot imagine not being in
America. Now, after weeks of missing peo
ple, places and things I'd left behind, being
back and having unlimited access to every
thing takes away the urgency of longing.
TTie day before 1 left, one girl asked all of
us what would be the first thing we'd do
when we got back to the States. Some said
they would play with their dogs, others
couldn't wait to visit their favorite restau
rants. Mine was to drink a lot of coffee, and
then unpack and re-pack to fly out to Stan
ford the following day. Being abroad gave
me the luxury of not worrying about practi
cal things, like signing up for MCAT classes
and finding a job to pay for said classes. I'll
miss that.
The one thing I won't miss about South
Africa is our near-constant vigilance against
the vague and nebulous dangers we were
warned about.'lliis was partly paranoia and
partly a legitimate concern.
As my father was quick to tell me (in an
effort to dissuade me from going). South
Africa has one of the highest rates of rape in
the world. Usually tourists are not the tar
gets of sexual violence, but it's a frightening
fact nonetheless. Plus, in South Africa, the

right to bear arms is valued even more high
ly than it is in America. Gun shops weren't
on every corner, but they weren't an uncom
mon sight either. On the road one day, in a
residential neighborhood, I remember pass
ing a bright blue and white sign advertising
"First and Secondhand Silencers" (which,
granted, could have referred to automotive
parts).
Hijacking is another cause for concern, as
are the somewhat less violent acts of purse
snatching, necklace grabbing and pick-pock
eting. A story circulated in my group about
the director of "Tsotsi" — a movie featuring
an ill-fated carjacking — becoming the vic
tim of the same crime. The carjacker, upon
learning his victim's identity, apologized but
stole the car anyway.
My group's experiences with violence
were limited, but still frightening. We heard
about stabbings or shootings happening in
our township, but usually only long after
they occurred. My host mother liked to mess
with my head; at night, sitting around the tel
evision, if we heard a loud noise she would
turn to me and ask:"Do you think that was a
gunshot?"
Two girls in my group were mugged
(while walking by themselves in the town
ship in the middle of the night) while anoth
er was nearly mugged (in the middle of the
day in a minibus taxi full of people).
For the most part, staying safe was simply
a matter of common sense and simple pre
cautions. We didn't go out alone at night, es
pecially in the township. We learned to be
clever in hiding our valuables.Taking a page

from our host mothers, we brought bra
stuffing back in style, asking each other if
the rectangular outline of money, credit
cards and phones could be seen through our
clothes.
I stopped using a wallet and hid my valu
ables in my glasses case. I had the (complete
ly impractical) idea that if 1 were mugged 1
would somehow convince my attackers to let
me keep my glasses. I mean, who would pick
on a girl with glasses?
The trouble for me was that it was hard to
gauge a threat in an unfamiliar environment;
knowing when to worry is a fine art. But back
in America, I know a sketchy situation when
I see one. For the most part, at least.
Besides letting my guard down a little, I
have also had time to appreciate some of the
other, finer points of being back. Who does
n't love a nice, thick, juicy New York accent
after so many months of fasting? The cus
toms official, before waving me through the
big metal exit doors and into the waiting
area, gave me both a heaping serving of ac
cent and a side of attitude as well.
"How long have you been out of the
country?" he asked me.
"Since February," I said.
"Studying hard?"
"Hardly studying," I replied, trying to be
funny.
He smirked and said, "Welcome back to
reality."
