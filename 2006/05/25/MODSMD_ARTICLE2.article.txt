# STANFORD 14, PACIFIC 8
## TIGERS TAMED Cardinal ride six-run sixth to non-conference win; two to go 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
If there has been one defining characteristic of the
Cardinal's play of late, it has been resilience.
One month ago. Stanford baseball owned an even
overall record of 17-17, but its record in conference
play stood at a dismal 2-7. Since then, the Cardinal
have rallied to go 13-6 while improving their Pac-10
mark to 11-13.
Stanford's late season surge hit a bump in the road
last weekend, however, as the Cardinal lost the rubber
match of their series against UCLA on a walkoff
homer by Bruins' first baseman Tim Stewart.
But true, to form. Stanford (30-23) recovered to
earn a key win over a tough Pacific squad yesterday af
ternoon by a final score of 14-8.
Tilings didn't look promising early on for the Car
dinal, as the Tigers managed to build leads of 3-0 and
8-4. Each time, though, Stanford fought back to close
the gap before ultimately taking the lead for good with
a six-run top of the sixth.
With postseason announcements looming, the vic
tory brought the Cardinal one step closer to earning
their thirteenth straight trip to the NCAA tourna
ment.
Despite the barrage of offense, Stanford's highlight
in the contest was likely the performance of freshman
hurler Austin Yount.
Coach Mark Marquess called the rookie
righthander out of the bullpen to face Pacific short
stop Anthony Jackson with the bases loaded in the
bottom of the fifth inning.The Tigers had already plat
ed five runs in the inning to take the 8-4 advantage and
were threatening for more.
But Yount came out firing, fanning Jackson on a 3-
2 payoff pitch to put out the fire. The Stanford offense
then responded with six runs in the top of the sixth,
with centerfielder Rvan Seawell. catcher John Hester,

shortstop Chris Minaker, and second
baseman Chris Lewis all connecting
on RBI singles. Yount cruised the
rest of the way to earn the win, allow
ing the Tigers just four hits and a
walk over the final four frames.
"This was a nice comeback win."
Marquess said. "We showed a lot of
character in the way we finished the
game. Our offense really came alive
when we need it, and Austin Yount
gave us a great performance out of
the bullpen."
Yount. who improved to 3-0 on
the year with the win, noted that his
recipe for success was simple.
"With the way we battled back
today, I just wanted to fill up the zone
with strikes and keep us in the
game," the freshman said of his ap
proach. "I just wanted to try and
throw strikes and make the hitters
get themselves out."
The Cardinal's production up and
down the lineup was a clearly opti
mistic sign as the team looks ahead to
the postseason. Four Stanford
starters collected at least three hits,
with Lewis (4-5,4 RBI) and Minaker
(3-6,3 RBI) leading the way.
But perhaps more encouraging
was the come-from-behind fashion
in which Stanford earned the victory.
It's the very same fashion in which
the Cardinal have turned their sea
son around and brought themselves
back into playoff contention.
"That's been our mode of opera
tion lately," said Lewis, referring to
the fact that 15 of Stanford's last 19

wins have come off comebacks. "We
just keep believing that it's never too
late for us and that we shouldn't be
counted out."
Stanford hosts UC-Davis Friday
at 6 p.m. before paying the Aggies a
return visit at 2 p.m. Saturday to close
out the regular season.
