# STANFORD 14, PACIFIC 8
## TIGERS TAMED Cardinal ride six-run sixth to non-conference win; two to go 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
If there has been one defining characteristic of the
Cardinal's play of late, it has been resilience.
One month ago. Stanford baseball owned an even
overall record of 17-17, but its record in conference
play stood at a dismal 2-7. Since then, the Cardinal
have rallied to go 13-6 while improving their Pac-10
mark to 11-13.
Stanford's late season surge hit a bump in the road
last weekend, however, as the Cardinal lost the rubber
match of their series against UCLA on a walkoff
homer by Bruins' first baseman Tim Stewart.
But true, to form. Stanford (30-23) recovered to
earn a key win over a tough Pacific squad yesterday af
ternoon by a final score of 14-8.
Tilings didn't look promising early on for the Car
dinal, as the Tigers managed to build leads of 3-0 and
8-4. Each time, though, Stanford fought back to close
the gap before ultimately taking the lead for good with
a six-run top of the sixth.
With postseason announcements looming, the vic
tory brought the Cardinal one step closer to earning
their thirteenth straight trip to the NCAA tourna
ment.
Despite the barrage of offense, Stanford's highlight
in the contest was likely the performance of freshman
hurler Austin Yount.
Coach Mark Marquess called the rookie
righthander out of the bullpen to face Pacific short
stop Anthony Jackson with the bases loaded in the
bottom of the fifth inning.The Tigers had already plat
ed five runs in the inning to take the 8-4 advantage and
were threatening for more.
But Yount came out firing, fanning Jackson on a 3-
2 payoff pitch to put out the fire. The Stanford offense
then responded with six runs in the top of the sixth,
with centerfielder Rvan Seawell. catcher John Hester,
