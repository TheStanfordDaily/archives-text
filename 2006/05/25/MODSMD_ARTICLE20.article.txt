## Barry who? Go Albert! 
### 
Growing up a Giants fan in St.
Louis has led to some inter
esting experiences for me in
years past. Seeing the stark contrast
between the way fans received Mark
McGwire's (probably steroid-in
duced) accomplishments and Barry
Bonds' recent success is not the least
of those. Nor was being practically
the only person pulling for San Fran
cisco to defeat the tragedy-stricken
Cardinals in the 2(X)2 NLCS the year
of Darryl Kile's death.
But now the 2006 Cardinals are
making it interesting all over again.
Why? Well, because they're basical
ly the Giants of two and three years
ago.
The emergence of Albert Pujols
this year has been notable in its sud
denness. Sure, he's been a great play
er for St. Louis since he entered the
league in 2001, slugging a very im
pressive 37 homers and driving in
130 runs in 161 games as a rookie.
But now he's unquestionably the
best guy in the league.
Whether you're building a team
to win now or a franchise to compete
steadily over the next 10 years, Al
bert's name is going to be the first
one called when you pick teams. As
recently as a few months ago, some
would have claimed A-Rod was the
way to go, and inaybe a few diehard
pitching enthusiasts would have
championed the cause of Johan San
tana. Not anymore, though.
With just a quarter of the season
under his belt, Pujols has already
whacked 23 homeruns, putting him
on pace to finish with over SO for the
year. That's a number that would
shatter Barry Bonds' single-season
mark of 73.
I can hear some of you laughing
out there. In late May, no one's on
pace for anything yet. It's way too
early to make predictions for the
season based on numbers we've
seen at this point, or so you're think
ing.
But, you see, I remember Pujols's
rookie season. In 2001, he was a
highly regarded prospect to be sure,
but no one was really expecting in
stant stardom from the young jack
of-all-trades, who saw action at first
and third base and in the outfield.
Then a funny thing happened. He
started hitting, and I mean way bet
ter than rookies are supposed to.
Still, it was like everyone in the
city was just waiting for him to cool
off, and revert to the form one would
expect from a first-year player. I my
self claimed as much to some enthu
siastic friends. He was a good player
of course, but no one is that good
that fast.
But the slump never happened.
Despite the atmosphere in the stadi
um and city, as if fans in Cardinal red
were waiting for the air to go out of
a balloon. Albert's fortunes have
continued to rise. And now, with not
merely St. Louis but the entire na
tion waiting for the phenomenal 26-
year-old Pujols to come back to
earth. I won't be fooled again.
Believe it or not, one year after
Bonds as we knew him disappeared,
brought down by old age and seem
ingly older knees, his replacement
has truly emerged, and at only 26.
Because now the Redbird slugger is
hitting like Bonds did in those years
not so long ago, years when it was
more surprising when he didn't
dominate an opposing pitcher, no
matter how good.
When Albert Pujols steps to the
plate, it's almost shocking if some
thing good doesn't happen â€” and
that's what separates the few truly
unbelievable from the many merely
great hitters in the game.
And interestingly enough, the
Cardinals have developed the kind
of team around their young super
star that the Giants once put around
Barry Bonds. They won't worry
much about surrounding Albert
with other feared hitters in their
lineup, because no one can protect a
guy like that.
Sooner or later, the rest of base
ball will learn you should always
walk Pujols unless there's a man on
first, and sometimes even then.
And though this hitter is less in
clined to take those walks than
Bonds, one can certainly assume
that as he gains more and more ex-
