## Corkery, Bruch into second round Cardinal's top two both pull out three-set wins in NCAA singles play 
### BEN BACKES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Faced with the prospect of saying goodbye to the
courts he has called home for the past four years,
Stanford's KC Corkery overcame a sore back to win
his first-round match in three sets yesterday Fresh
man Matt Bruch was also victorious, winning his
NCAA Individual Tournament debut in three sets at
theTaube Family Tennis Center.
Corkery, ranked No. 25, defeated No. 40 Raul
Morant-Rivas of Texas A&M-Corpus Christi (6-3,3-
6,7-5). Trailing 5-4 in the decisive third set and ham
pered by a back injury sustained in the previous set,
Corkery was able to dig deep and win the final three
games.
"I tried to give it everything I had," he said. "I did
n't want it to be the last match I played on these
courts so I did whatever 1 could to play. I tried to
make him beat me."
After a relatively easy first set, when the senior
broke Morant-Rivas to take a 4-2 lead before finish
ing with a 6-3 victory, things took a turn for the worse
during the first game of the second set.
"I went out to hit a backhand and felt my back
tighten up," Corkery said. "It was kind of similar to
what happened in Ojai (during the Pacific-10 Individ
ual Championships] in April. I was really worried
about it because I had to pull out in Ojai, but 1 got
some work done on it and it loosened up a little bit."
After that game, which saw five deuces before
Morant-Rivas finally held serve, Corkery called for
an injury timeout. Afterwards he appeared to be
struggling to play at his previous level.
"For the rest of the match I felt like 1 couldn't
move how I wanted to," he said. "Luckily, I was able
to get through it."
After dropping the first four games of the second
set, Corkery won two games but eventually dropped

the set 6-3.
"I started feeling better at the end
of the second set and started to get a
handle on what I could and couldn't
do," he said."Focus was the big thing
for me since I couldn't do everything
I wanted to do. I played a couple big
games at the end and was able to pull
it out."

country, met No. 34 Andrei Mlenda
of TCU in the first round. The fresh
man battled through a long match

again found themselves tied at five
games apiece. This time it was the
TCU player who won two consecu
tive games to take the set.
The Stanford rookie dominated

game, seeing his lead shrink to 2-1.
From that point on. however, Bruch
dominated, not yielding another
game to close out the set, 6-1.

match."
