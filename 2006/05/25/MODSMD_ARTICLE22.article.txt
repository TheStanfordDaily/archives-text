## Cyclists meet goals at conference, national races 
### DENIS GRIFFIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Since the Daily last talked with Stanford Cy
cling, the club qualified for and competed at the
NCCA National Championship, where —
after placing fifth in the Western Collegiate Cy
cling Conference — the Cardinal took 16th
overall in the May 14th road race.The finish was
a promising sign for a club sport whose mem
bers admit to being in a rebuilding phase.
"We lost a lot of our A-riders from last
year." sophomore Sasha Richey said. "But that
said, we still did fairly well. We're only graduat
ing one A-rider this year for the guys, but we're
getting a bunch more. So this was a very solid
building year and we qualified for nationals,
which was our goal."
Richey also raced well individually, finishing
first in the WCCC Women's A-bracket at the
conference race. Fellow sophomore Todd Nor

wood was also among the Cardinal's top indi
vidual competitors.
"We were really happy with our season, ac
tually," Norwood said. "We did a lot better
than we have in past years. Personally, I won a
conference title, but more importantly the
team finished fifth, and we were very close to
fourth [in the conference race]. So we feel like
we have a lot of potential for next year going
forward."
Norwood added that, despite his team's re
cent success, he believes the club's potential
could increase with more exposure on campus.
"I feel like we're relatively unknown," he
said. "We have rides everyday and we start off
at the Post Office at 3:30 — but it seems like
everyone's wondering who are those people?'
I think increasing our profile here would be a
big help, because every year we have people
come out of the woodwork as upperclassnien
who are great racers, and we're always wonder

ing where they were as freshmen and sopho
mores."
One way the team hopes to attract more in
terest from the student body is through their
openness to all levels of participation.
"I personally ride just about every day,"
Richey said. "But we have people who ride
once every few weeks and still come out to race
a few times, and people who ride every day and
race every weekend. So basically it's however
much you want to put into it. But really we do
have a solid, core group of people who ride
most days and race most weekends."
Richey explained that the team's openness
to new members of all levels means that riders
at any experience level can race against others
in their skill range:
"We get all levels, all age ranges," she said.
"We have grads and undergrads on our team,
and we get incoming freshmen who have been
athletic or not and just decide/hey, I'm going to

start riding bikes.' And then we have people
who come in from other schools who have al
ready been racing for a number of years, so it's
really varied."
"You just get to go out and practice every
day in a beautiful area with a lot of fantastic
people," Richey continued. "There's a bunch of
different levels of riders, so if you're a beginner
you have someone to ride with and if you're ad
vanced you have other people to ride with, so
it's really fantastic."
Of course, with a bike every few feet on this
campus, cycling may not seem so special. But
according to Norwood, a hidden layer of strate
gy and foresight goes into every race.
"I know it just looks like you're riding a
bike," Norwood said. "But if you get out there
— especially in road racing — it's a chess game
on wheels. It's an intense sport, even at our
level. And 1 don't think people see that. They
think we're just out there riding a bike.
