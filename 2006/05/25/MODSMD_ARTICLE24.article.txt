# BASEBALL PROFILE
## Taylor-made for Stanford 
### ANDREW LOMELI STAFF WRITER 
Standing at 6-foot-6 and 250 pounds, sophomore outfield
er Michael Taylor is often asked whether he plays football.
While his dad was a pigskin standout at Maryland in the
late 70s and early 80s, Michael said he never felt pressure to
put on the pads.
"My dad kept me out of football when 1 was younger, and
he said I'd thank him when I'm 40," Taylor said. "Anytime
you're my size,people are going to assume that you play, want
to play, or need to play football. When they ask, I just smile
and say I'm doing alright with baseball."

Taylor has indeed been
"doing alright" with base
ball, hitting .351 with four
homeruns and a team
leading three triples while
batting cleanup for most of
the Cardinal's season.
"It's like I'm in the mid
dle of a train, and I've got
to keep it running," Taylor
said. "It's just about hand
ing it off to the next guy
and putting up some runs
so we have an opportunity
to win ballgames."
Taylor describes himself
as a student of the game
who enjoys playing it in its

pui est form. All of his success may come as a surprise, consid
ering the fact that he "fell" into baseball at a young age.
"When I was younger, I was always a basketball guy and
also ran track,"Taylor said. "One of the kids in my neighbor
hood said he was signing up for a little league, so I went out
to join him and I enjoyed it. It ended up being something I
was good at, so I stuck with it and worked really hard at it."
His work ethic and love for basketball and baseball stayed
with Taylor into high school, where he first set his sights on
Stanford.
"The screen name [ionstanford] originated in middle
school as a daily reminder that through my work on the field
and in the classroom. I would always keep my eye on Stan
ford.'Taylor said. "The idea of Stanford being a top academ
ic school and competitive in both baseball and basketball —
it really set a benchmark for me to strive for."
Taylor was expected to be drafted in the second round of
the 2004 MLB First-Year Player-Draft, but despite the temp
tation of possibly making millions, Taylor chose to forgo the
opportunity, knowing that Stanford was the right place for
him. The major leagues are not completely out of Taylor's
sight, however, as he hopes to enter the draft after his junior
year and — more importantly — "earn the Stanford de
gree."
Throughout his two years on The Farm, Taylor has bene
fited from his exposure to the ideas and skills of his peers,
both on the field and in the classroom.
"It's been a real eye-opening, humbling experience that
has given me a lot of dedication and drive,"Taylor said. "You
arrive at this level where everyone is competitive and you
have struggles, but at the same time you are inspired because
you realize you have the ability to play at this level.
