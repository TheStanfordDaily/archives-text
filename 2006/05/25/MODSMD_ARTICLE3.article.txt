## MED SCHOOL FACULTY CLAIM SYSTEMATIC DISCRIMINATION Sources suspect halting of Dept. of Labor investigation related to Stanford-Bush administration ties 
### BEN EPPLER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Several past and present Medical School faculty mem
bers have accused the University of discrimination against
women and minorities, particularly in hiring and advance
ment processes. These faculty members allege that since
1998, when more than 30 Stanford-affiliated teachers and
researchers filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of
Labor, the Medical School has systematically retaliated
against many of the complainants.
Mysteriously halted in 2001, the investigation was re
opened in October of last year, prompting speculation by
some that the hiatus can be attributed to Stanford connec
tions within the Bush administration.
The complainants, who requested anonymity on the
grounds that their careers might be at risk, painted a chill
ing portrait of the Medical School's atmosphere. Chief
among their concerns is the lack of transparency in hiring
decisions, which they say are not as open and fair as the
school's leadership advertises.
"I've never heard of a place that's worse for minority
and women faculty," said one source.
Discrimination issues have troubled the University for
more than a decade. In 1991, Frances Conley. a tenured pro
fessor at the Medical School and one of the top neurosur
geons in the country, left Stanford after a colleague who she
said treated her inappropriately was appointed chair of her
department.
