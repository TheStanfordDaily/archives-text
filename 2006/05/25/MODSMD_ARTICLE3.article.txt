## MED SCHOOL FACULTY CLAIM SYSTEMATIC DISCRIMINATION Sources suspect halting of Dept. of Labor investigation related to Stanford-Bush administration ties 
### BEN EPPLER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Several past and present Medical School faculty mem
bers have accused the University of discrimination against
women and minorities, particularly in hiring and advance
ment processes. These faculty members allege that since
1998, when more than 30 Stanford-affiliated teachers and
researchers filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of
Labor, the Medical School has systematically retaliated
against many of the complainants.
Mysteriously halted in 2001, the investigation was re
opened in October of last year, prompting speculation by
some that the hiatus can be attributed to Stanford connec
tions within the Bush administration.
The complainants, who requested anonymity on the
grounds that their careers might be at risk, painted a chill
ing portrait of the Medical School's atmosphere. Chief
among their concerns is the lack of transparency in hiring
decisions, which they say are not as open and fair as the
school's leadership advertises.
"I've never heard of a place that's worse for minority
and women faculty," said one source.
Discrimination issues have troubled the University for
more than a decade. In 1991, Frances Conley. a tenured pro
fessor at the Medical School and one of the top neurosur
geons in the country, left Stanford after a colleague who she
said treated her inappropriately was appointed chair of her
department.
Though Conley later returned to
Stanford, the Medical School's history
of gender conflicts did not end there. In
2(XX), a jury found that prominent re
searcher Colleen Crangle had been
fired for complaining of discrimination
and awarded her *545,000. Stanford
appealed, and the case was settled out
of court in 2(X)1.
In 2(X)5, Denise Johnson, the only
black female surgeon on the faculty at
the time, sued the University for,
among other things, being paid less
than her white and male counterparts
and for being targeted for past harass
ment complaints. She also claimed that
Stanford forced her to submit to a ran
dom drug test, even though the prac
tice is not required by school policy.
The University denied these allega
tions and eventually settled out of
court.
But Stanford may not have learned
from these experiences, according to
concerned faculty members. They say
good-old-boy networking — not com
petitive application processes — is
rampant in hiring and advancement
decisions in some departments at the
Medical School. They also allege that
higher-ups often decide who they want
for a position before soliciting applica
tions or conducting interviews.
"Cronyism takes two forms. One is
knowing somebody, and the other is
looking at someone's CV and seeing
that they have interests and back
grounds similar to your own," said one
source."When you begin with a faculty
that's not diverse.and then the process
es used to select additional faculty are
noncompetitive, then new faculty are
more likely to represent the interests

and background of existing faculty."
Medical School Dean Philip Pizzo
responded that he and his staff conduct
thorough and equitable searches for all
available openings.
"We have a very detailed list of re
quirements for searches which require
advertising positions, soliciting names
from schools around the country, mak
ing direct contacts and also being at
tentive to gender and racial diversity,"
he told The Daily.
According to some, however, the
University has failed to foster open dis
cussion about issues such discrimina
tion and the influence of minority sta
tus in hiring and career advancement.
"When you raise a complaint with
the school, immediately you're the
enemy," said one source, adding that
the University responds to criticism in
a variety of ways, including pay cuts,
support staff reductions, office reloca
tions and accusations of incompetence.
"If you are a woman or minority
and are equal or aspire to be equal,
they'll make your career very diffi
cult," the source continued. "It was so
disappointing because you expect this
place to have higher ideals."
University officials strongly denied
the allegation that they stifle criticism.
"There hasn't been retaliation,"
said Debra Zumwalt, vice president
and general counsel for the University.
In response to discrimination
claims, she said, "I think [criticism] is
inevitable given the fact that you're
looking at tenure decisions," noting
that accusations of unfairness often
stem from the denial of tenure.
"I personally have no tolerance
for discrimination of any sort," said
David Stevenson, senior associate
dean for academic affairs at the Med
ical School. He cited his creation of
the Office of Diversity and Leader
ship and a mandatory "Respectful
Workplace" program as examples of
a "proactive" approach to combating
discrimination and promoting career
mobility for minorities.
"A lot of times it is perception," he
added, "When people look into it,
they find no evidence of (discrimina
tion)."
Regarding these initiatives, sever
al faculty members said minorities
and women are sometimes placed in
positions of authority to maintain the
appearance of faculty diversity.
"It's more important to select in
dividuals who are committed to di
versity, which is not necessarily en
sured by choosing people who are di
verse in and of themselves," one
Medical School source said.
According to both past and pres

ent complainants, the U.S. Depart
ment of Labor investigators have
only disappointed those asking for
help. They allege that the agency,
which initially promised not to re
lease the names of complainants, in
formed them in late 2(KK) that they
would have to reveal their identities
to the University.
Though the Department had
pledged to protect those reporting
grievances from retaliation, the
names were released shortly after
the investigation was cut off. While
the investigation was suspended,
many of the original class of com
plainants departed Stanford or were
awarded damages outside ol couit
in exchange for not speaking to in
vestigators or the press, a Medical
School source confirmed.
"The Labor Department sold out
those people," said one faculty mem
ber.
Hven University officials say they
are not sure of the reason for the
lengthy pause in the investigation,
and Department officials have little
to add.
"There is no usual, but this proba
bly wouldn't be considered typical,"
Labor Department Spokeswoman
Dianne Amaden said, citing "a vari

ety of reasons" for the four-year halt
of the investigation, none of which
she could specify. Department per
sonnel are not permitted to disclose
information about ongoing investiga
tions.
One faculty member said the
Labor Department has admitted in
the past that the order to stop the in
quiry came from the federal level
Many complainants said they be
lieve the investigation was halted by
the Bush administration when it as
sumed office in 2001.
"The question every student and
parent should be asking is,' Did any
one in the Bush administration in
fluence the apparent slow-down iit
the investigation?'" Crangle said in
an interview with Ihe Daily. "What
can Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice, provost of the University when
the class action was initiated, tell
us?"
But, with Bush's approval ratings
hitting all-time lows and midtcim
elections on the way, disgruntled fac
ulty members, past and present, are
more optimistic about the investiga
tion's ability to make a difference.
"Time reveals all truth," one
source said. "Eventually it's going to
come out."
