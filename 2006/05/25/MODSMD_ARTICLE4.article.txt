## Sophomore catcher brings dance flair to softball diamond 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
She may have been a ballerina, but Erin Howe is
tough as nails when she needs to be. Even though she
gave up competitive dance — ballet, tap and jazz — to
focus on softball. the sophomore catcher fondly remem
bers the time she has spent in the studio as well as on the
field.
"It was a good balance to play an aggressive, tough
sport like softball and then go to ballet class," Howe re
called. "I would have to be graceful and light on my
feet."
Now that she is playing collegiate softball, her danc
ing days may be over, but Howe still finds ways to com

"Every now and then when we are doing condition
ing for softball and we do plyometrics, I'll add a little
dance flair," she said." ITie team will make fun of me, but
I like to bring a little grace during conditioning. And
sometimes during downtime in practice I'll just do a lit

Sophomore catcher Erin Howe has taken on an integral role behind the
plate for the Cardinal this year. She thrives on the responsibility and
excitement that comes with her position.
"girly girl." But on the field, she is
not afraid to mix it up with an oppo
nent trying to score.
"When there's a play at the plate,
I have my tough face on," she said.
"Catcher is a stereotypically rough
and-tough position and I play tough,
but 1 still like to keep my feminine
side."
Howe's tough play has paid off
this season and she has played all
but four of the Cardinal's games this
year, directing the game from be
hind the plate and helping Stanford
to a 42-16 record and a spot in the
postseason.
"One of my favorite things about
catching is that you are involved in
every play," she said. "I always have
the responsibility to lead and to
make sure I am on the same page as
the pitcher. 1 love that responsibility
and really take pride in it."
In 2006, she has recorded a .989
fielding percentage and a batting av
erage of .185. She has already
matched her RBI output from her
rookie season with 21 and Stan
ford's season is not over yet.
Howe started out playing teeball
on a coed team at age four and, after
her first season of travel ball, decid
ed at ten to stick with softball for the
long run.
"I guess that may seem young,"
she said. "But both of my older sis
ters played so I knew already that I
really like the sport. I kept playing
other sports and I did dance, but
softball was always my dream."
When Howe began to look at col
leges to play at, Stanford was on her
list, but it was her recruiting trip that
sealed the deal for the Missouri City,
Texas, native.
"Once you know, you just know,"
she said. "Going to other schools, I

just didn't quite feel that I would fit
in. And then I came to Stanford and
saw Palm Drive and MemChu and
the Quad and I was sold. The team
was so great and the coaches have
the same philosophy about softball
that my previous coaches had, which
was something else I was looking
for."
The academics were a draw as
well for Howe, who is an Economics
major and American History minor
with an interest in entrepreneur
ship.
"It's something that I might want
to look into," she said. "But for now,
I'm just taking it as it comes and I
don't really know what I'm going to
do after college."
Still only a sophomore, Howe has
plenty of time to figure out her fu
ture. For now, she is focusing on her
sport and her team.
In her two years on the Farm,
Howe has already experienced
some memorable moments with the
Cardinal, who advanced to the 2005
Super Regional and will play for a
spot in the Women's College World
Series this weekend.
"We have had a lot of great
games, but I think one of the best
was when we came back to beat
Northwestern in the last inning [in
March 2006]," Howe said. "They are
one of our biggest rivals because a
lot of my teammates were also re
cruited by Northwestern and it's al
ways a good matchup. We were
down 4-0 and came back in the sev
enth to win 5-4."
But when the memories of come
back wins fade, Howe said she will
best remember the time with her
teammates off the field.
"I love road trips the most," she
said. "We have such a fun team.
Whether it's [seniorj Lauren Lappin
dancing in the aisles on the bus or
having [freshman] Missy Penna as a
roommate and just hanging out, it's
those little things that will stick with
me the longest."
