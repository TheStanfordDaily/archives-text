pend on the squad's ability to keep its cool on the
big stage.
"Hie biggest thing for us is not playing with
pressure," Rittman said. "There is a sense of ur
gency that you need to get the job done and that
there is no tomorrow, but we just need to play the
game the way it's meant to be played and not get
caught up in the pressure of having to win."
Making their ninth consecutive NCAA ap
pearance, the Cardinal went 4-1 last weekend
with the sole loss at the hands of Fresno State.

ERA against Tulsa and Fresno.

and Saturday afternoon with a potential rubber

game Saturday evening. With two wins, Stanford
would advance to the World Series for the second
time in three years.

27-5 record with a 1.01 ERA.
"Our team is excited by the challenge,
and we're just ready to go out there and
play softball," Rittman said.

Pac-10 teams in the tourney all advanced to
the Super Regionals — Oregon was the only
