## Arrillaga gives $100 million gift to University 
### 
John Arrillaga has done it again,
reports say.The real estate developer
and longtime Stanford benefactor —
whose name already graces an alum
ni center, athletic facility and recre
ation center on campus — has re
cently made a $ 1 (K) million donation
to the University, according to The
San Francisco Chronicle. The dona
tion ranks among the largest gifts
made to any university from a single
individual,The Chronicle said.
Neither the University nor Arrilla
ga have publicly confirmed the gift, as
private universities are not required
to disclose donations. According to
the Chronicle of Higher Education,
only 66 other gifts of $100 million or
more have been made since 1%7 na
tionwide. Most, however, were from
foundations and were not offered as
one-time donations.
Stanford is no stranger to big
money donations, despite the unique
nature of Arrillaga's latest. The Uni
versity received $400 million from the
William and Flora Hewlett Founda
tion in 2001, and the Lucille Packard
Children's Hospital at the School of
Medicine received $100 million from
the David and Lucile Packard Foun
dation in 2001.
