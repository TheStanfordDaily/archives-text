## Ambulance hijacker to serve 36 days in jail Law student charged with misdemeanor auto theft, DUI 
### ADAM WIDMAN STAFF WRITER 
A Law School student who hijacked an idling
ambulance in October pleaded no contest on
Monday to misdemeanor auto theft and driving
under the influence. She will serve 36 days in a
Santa Clara County Jail.

According to court records, Julia Powell, 27,
jumped in the ambulance while two paramedics
were assisting an intoxicated student in a nearby
residence hall. She proceeded to drive the ambu
lance for about one minute before evacuating the
vehicle.
Although the vehicle was driven out of the
sight of paramedics, Powell was identified as the
likely culprit when authorities found her cell
phone on the ambulance floor later that night.
According to The San Jose Mercury-News,
Powell initially denied involvement in the crime,

but later said her memory of the event was un
clear. Powell's attorney said that his client's intox
ication was exacerbated by potent painkillers she
had taken earlier in the night.
Powell will begin her sentence on Aug. 24. She
will most likely serve her time in a sheriffs camp
or a weekend work program.
It is unclear what academic consequences, if
any, Powell will face for her actions. Larry
Kramer, dean of the Law School, declined to
comment on potential disciplinary actions, citing
student privacy.
