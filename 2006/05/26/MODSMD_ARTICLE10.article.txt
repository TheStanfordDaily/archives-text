China Delight offers tasty, inexpen
sive food in a convenient location
just off of University Avenue. To
get a grasp of what inexpensive means in
the context of the China Delight menu,
consider their dinner selections: most
beef, chicken and pork entrees cost $6.95,
veggie dishes cost $5.50 and rice and noo
dle dishes cost $4.95. If you aren't im
pressed yet, come early for lunchtime and

you'll receive the following bargain: $4.60
for an appetizer, steamed rice, soup and
an entree such as cashew chicken, beef
broccoli, chicken in black bean sauce or
mixed vegetables. You don't get much
better than that!
In addition to being quite affordable,
China Delight's food is quite good — it's
not fantastic, but it certainly hits the spot.
My dry sauteed string beans ($5.50) had a

very nice flavor. I also appreciated that
China Delight prepares its steamed white
rice ($1) well - it wasn't too dried out like
at some restaurants. The pot stickers
were the status quo. pretty good but not
mouth-watering.
China Delight's atmosphere pro
vides adequate comfort but doesn't
offer much to delight in. The tan walls
are a little drab (although I must admit

that eating an early dinner alone proba
bly didn't help my chances of encoun
tering an enlivening mood in the restau
rant). Fortunately, China Delight does
offer other things to delight in — good
food and great prices. I can't wait to
bring a group of friends to China De
light to help battle the dreary tan walls
and share in the enjoyment of a satisfy
ing. under $5 lunch.
