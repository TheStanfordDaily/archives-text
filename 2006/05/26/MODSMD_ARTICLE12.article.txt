## Editorial Should Dead Week really be dead? 
### 
In the aftermath of the ASSU elections,
the Editorial Board reminded all elected
candidates that their mandate was not
free or unconditional ("Campaign promises:
Made to be broken?" April 18). Of course,
barring a possible Stanfordgate, we can reli
ably expect that the tenure of our senators
and ASSU executives will carry on without
threat of impeachment or student unrest.
Nonetheless, we urge Stanford students to
demand campaign responsibility from our
elected representatives. Sadly, keeping cam
paign promises has become the exception
rather than the rule in the ASSU We still
think that should change.
But one of our specific post-election rec
ommendations demands a second look. On
April 18, we wrote that the executive slate of
ASSU President Elizabeth Heng and Vice
President Lauren Graham "must make good
on their talking points to make Dead Week
dead." In fact, Heng and Graham have re
peatedly pointed to this campaign promise
as their most sacred; "making Dead Week
dead" was a cornerstone of their platform
and will be one of the first issues they at
tempt to tackle.
The duo has been elected, and if we are to
take an optimistic view of Stanford elections,
we assume that students carefully read their
platform and thus further suppose that their
mandate represents an implicit endorse
ment of that platform. A less naive outlook
might point to other factors beyond the is
sues as equally compelling reasons for Heng
and Graham's victory. Either way, we would
urge all students to reflect on the Dead
Week issue, and we hope that we can arrive
at an intelligent debate on the issue.
In a sense. Heng and Graham are actual
ly trying to reinvent the idea of Dead Week
itself. The term was originally (and is still at
other colleges) intended to connote a feeling
of "death" that students feel upon recogniz
ing the mountain of papers and end-of-class
assignments that they have due during Dead
Week. Asking for the.week.to be dead plays

on the misconception that it is the week —
not the student — that is meant to be dead in
the first place.
This issue of semantics only obscures some
of the more troubling issues surrounding the
vagueness of Heng and Graham's campaign
promise. Will making Dead Week dead mean
that all papers normally due during Dead
Week will now be due earlier? Would this
only make the crunch more intense? Or does
the idea of making Dead Week dead only put
a moratorium on the presentation of new ma
terial? This would force professors to concen
trate the same amount of reading and work
into a shorter schedule.
The reality is that the quarter system is ex
tremely short and fast-paced. Restricting the
amount of time that material can be present
ed or narrowing the window in which papers
and assignments can be submitted could have
damaging and far-reaching consequences.
Even more fundamentally, we wonder if
students really do need a Dead Week that is
more stress-free. As mentioned above, we are
concerned that the changes to Dead Week
would amount to a band-aid solution, simply
shifting the stress rather than dispelling it.
Also, we are not sure how many students
would use the extra time to prepare for
exams. Stanford's lofty average GPA sug
gests that most students already have ade
quate study time. Given that Stanford stu
dents take fewer classes — and thus have
fewer exams — than students at other
schools, the notion of a "dead" Dead Week
may make for a nice sound bite but have lit
tle practical necessity.
Though hopefully students can put pres
sure on Heng and Graham to revisit the
Dead Week plank, the greater responsibility
rests with our executive slate to engage the
student body, as is their duty. If students un
derstand the factors at play and still choose
to "make Dead Week dead," then we have
no complaints. But blindly forging ahead
with campaign promises is no virtue: on this
too, we shouldiiemand better.
