# The 						macho man
## 
### 
In the modern era of designer suits,corner
offices and decaf lattes, an age where
hunting is entertainment and cattle-rais
ing has been mechanized and industrialized,
what makes a man a man?
I'm not the most obvious candidate to be
posing such a question: I don't think I've
ever been mistaken for a man. I'm often re
ferred to as "boy" or "dude" or, if I'm lucky
(and in the presence of the Governator),
"girly-man." Last week, a fellow diner mis
took my bicep for a stray strand of spaghetti
and stuck a fork in my arm. Most of my best
friends are girls, I don't work out or play
lacrosse and I don't think Adam Carolla is
very funny. Except when he was on Loveline.
Yet, I secretly mourn the loss of the
strong, assertive male archetype. John
Wayne's name may live on in the gleaming
edifices of the Orange County airport, but
the likes of the Duke and Humphrey Bogart
are long gone. And I'm not alone in my
mourning. Tyler Durden is wearing black too.
According to my own calculations, 76
percent of my personal experiences are ac
tually TV or movie plots. Like that time in
high school when my nerdy but attractive
best friend became addicted to caffeine pills
and I consoled her when she broke down
after the big math test: ("I'm so excited! I'm
so excited! I'm so O scared!") It's no wonder
then that when I get to pondering Big Ques
tions like the plight of man in modern socie
ty, I turn to pop culture.
Tyler Durden is a postmodern Man's
Man: violent, raw, prideful, assertive, sexy in
a dirt-stained, sweat-soaked kind of way. He
asks people to punch him just to see what it
feels like. He's one response to a society that
"has us chasing cars and clothes, working
jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't
need."
Another response is Lewis, a character in
James Dickey's "Deliverance." But instead
of lashing out at materialism, he reverts. He

learns to hunt with a bow-and-arrow and
studies the skills that would help him survive
if modern society crumbled into wandering
tribes of hunter-gatherers.
The Jimmy Kimmel-Adam Carolla per
sona is another option. This template for
manliness requires injecting testosterone
into your forearm and hiding from the world
by planting your face in an enormous pair of
breasts. It's sheer cynicism, veiled by a thin
veneer of sexual bravado and fart jokes.
Frankly, 1 don't think any of these is a sat
isfactory template for manhood in modern
society.
Women, on the other hand, have it easy.
All they need to do to prove their femininity
and contribute to society is get knocked up.
Men. however, have their hands tied when it
comes to this kind of creation (at least they
do if they're lucky). This is why men are lead
ers in most professional fields: incapable of
creating life, they channel their ambitions
into creating media empires, skyscrapers
and political careers.
I considered all of the different paths. I
pondered life as an investment banker, em
bracing the material world. I almost took a
fishing job in Alaska as a last-ditch effort to
get in touch with my inner Viking. In the end,
I decided just to get myself a latte and watch
"Casablanca" on repeat.

This is my second-to-last column. Your
chances to send me an email at harretts@stan
ford.edu are slowly slipping away. Hurry!
