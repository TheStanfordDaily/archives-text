# Roxy Sass is evil

### 
Amongst the scads of things that annoy
me in life, I hold in particular con
tempt that brand of journalist who
dishes out advice on the seedier side of life.
Sex columnists are evil.
Now, I know what you're thinking:"Evil?!
Isn't that a little harsh?" Well, it may appear
that way, but hear me out.
No form of cruelty is as brutal as the slow
raising followed by a swift demolition of
one's expectations:despite its apparent altru
ism, the slow, deliberate manipulation of
your dreams is the true purpose of an advice
column.
For, you see, these things are never about
advice. (Actually advice is never really about
advice â€” it always comes down to someone
trying to make someone else feel bad.) No,
instead it's about toying with the minds of
your readers.
Columnists live in a fantasy world. And
their sole aim is to share that fantasy with as
many people as possible, without letting on
that it's all an elaborate web of deception.
Normally, this doesn't matter. Normally
we write about meaningless crap that no one
reads, so if you're just making it up, who
cares?
Sex, on the other hand, well, that's pretty
gripping. People read that stuff. Those three
letters tug at our... heartstrings, pulling us
into the abyss.
Contrary to popular belief and German
philosophers, it is not your self that lies with
in the darkness. Rather it's everything you
want, everything you believe you should
have and nothing that you will ever possess.
Such shadowy territory, laden with prom

ise but ultimately without hope, is the natural
stalking ground of advice givers. They will
lure you in with innocent sounding tips on
how to get a little stimulation, and spit you
out once you've been reminded again of
what you're missing.
Actually, it isn't just Roxy Sass and her ilk
that are responsible for the false hopes and
the ever-unrealized dreams. All of popular
culture is geared to destroy your soul.
People on TV are beautiful. Even the
token ugly ones. Worse, everyone is getting
laid. The most hopeless, miserable failure on
any given show is getting more action than
you. George Costanza has a better sex life
than most of my friends.
Let's think about that: George Costanza, a
man who, for nine Seinfeld seasons was a by
word for loser, would be the ultimate player
in the real world. And yet, when we watch the
screen we laugh at his fumbling antics, forget
ting that amongst men even a lesser god
would be divine.
It gets worse, Costanza is just the tip of an
iceberg. Every program that graces your tel
evision screens should come with a "do not
try this at home" warning, for they all mock
you with a perpetual post-coital glow that

will never settle on you.
As for the movies, well I won't even dwell
on them, except to point out that the number
of column inches devoted to the sex lives of
film stars has little to do with their value as
news items of interest. Rather, like the rest of
our obsessions with celebrity, it is a reflection
of a constant struggle to tangle ourselves in
more famous lives so that a little of the magic
may rub off.
Pictures are not alone in swamping you
in illusion. Words and music, books and
songs will also poke and jab at your sense of
self-worth, while weaving an image of a bet
ter life that will forever remain just out of
reach.
In a way it's a bit like the "Matrix". The
real world is a horrible place. It's dark and
dank. We are all huddled together, feeding
off the liquefied remains of our dead and
generating electrical power for our evil ro
botic overloads. And, to distract us from this
dreadful existence, we immerse ourselves
into an artificial world.
A world in which we are fed stimulation
that makes us believe things could be better
and gives us hope that the everyday grind of
existence is but a passing phase. And we fall
for it.
Embracing delusion is the only universal
philosophy in modern life. And be they sex
columnists or television executives; the
priests of this religion of "Hope" are as venal
and corrupt as those of any other faith.
