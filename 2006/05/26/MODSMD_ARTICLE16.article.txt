Daily must contribute to cultural
awareness
As a black student, I am concerned by the
blatantly anti-ethnic community position
that the Editorial Board has taken this year.
No, it doesn't make a person racist to say
that they don't approve of theme dorms.
However, if that person has never visited
or lived in a theme dorm, has never sup
ported programming from a theme dorms
or has never visited a community center,
then it certainly is ignorant to be against
theme dorms.
I suggest that the Daily hold a community
hall forum, co-hosted by the staff of all six
community centers, the ASSU and the Office
of Multicultural Education. If the Editorial

Board insists on continuing to attack institu
tions at Stanford that have contributed to a
greater level of cultural awareness and sup
port networks for students of color, then the
Daily must make an effort to actually edu
cate the Stanford community with unbiased
information.

Culture has academic value
In yesterday's editorial ("Religious
theme dorms: Why not?" May 25), the Edito
rial Board claimed that "there are those on
campus who identify more strongly with
their religious identity than with the color of
their skin."

rhis statement reveals a faulty assump
tion made by the Board — that residents of
theme dorms unite under an identity based
on the color of their skin. Culture is academ
ic — there's an important academic value in
maintaining culture in ethnic theme dorms
and academic study on campus. I would
argue that students in ethnic theme dorms
unite around an appreciation of a culture
and the recognition of the importance of
maintaining that culture. For instance, there
are many non-brown people in Casa Zapata
who come here not because they identify
with a skin color, but because they appreci
ate the culture and values that a
C hicano/Latino theme dorm fosters and
maintains.
