# Pfitz parlays sex appeal into win
## 
### SCOOP SCOOPERSTEIN INTERNATIONAL BE-DICULOUS BOY TOY 
T'was a frigid spring night. The candidates had been
whittled down to two. And while the competition was for
midable. the freckled, bright blue-eyed Irishman Patrick
Fitzgerald prevailed.
After an unprecedented run-off election. Fitzgerald
eked out his ultimate victory by a mere five votes — the
final tally being 34-29.
Sources speculate that Fitzgerald's win can be attributed
to him being "dead sexy."
"That Patrick Fitzgerald! 1 would kill for a stack of his
pancakes. He's got a sizzlin' Irish griddle." said Managing
Editor of Mayhem Megan Watkins. whose section will be
cancelled as a part of Fitzgerald's platform.
"Special Sections got fitzgeraled." said the Editor-in-
Chief-elect, proudly using his own name as a verb.
According to current Daily management, the win by
Fitzgerald will have major ramifications for the atmosphere
in the office.
"It's going to be a huge sausage fest next year!" said two
term Editor-in-Chief Camille Ricketts, who later slunk out
of the office, a cigarette dangling from her lips, muttering
under her breath. "And she was never to be seen again."
Women staffers across the office were ecstatic upon
hearing the news — rumors quickly spread of a "collective
gasp of orgasmic joy" that occurred when the announce
ment was made.
Sports Editor Whitney Sado. in the throes of said ecsta
sy. accidentally dumped a box of shredded papers on the
winner, admitting that she had lost control of her faculties.
"It happens all the time," she added. "At least people
thought it was planned confetti."
Fitzgerald's broad appeal stirred even the most stoic of
voters.
"I'd die for him — the way he pops his collar and turns
red at the sight of Bacardi," said Managing Editor of Inter
mission Betsy Congdon."He's so cute when he's trashed."
Even some male Daily employees expressed similar
sentiments.
"I had no idea when 1 first met him that I'd bought a tick
et to the gun show." said Intermission Editor Victor "The
Rican" Fuste.
A fight ensued between Fitzgerald and Business Manag
er Brendan Marten, who has publicly claimed Fuste as his

"brokeback buddy." Fitzgerald emerged covered in cham
pagne and confetti, but victorious after several female
staffers hurled themselves at him. blocking Marten's at
tempted chair-war charge.
Marten later complained that Fitzgerald "totally would
have gone down" if only he had been wearing "shoes with
some freaking traction."
"Well.at least Intermission won't have to apply for fund
ing from the Pub Board now." said Marten, desperately try
ing to save face.
When David Herbert. Fitzgerald's campaign manager,
heard the good news, he engaged his candidate in a hearty
man-hug — his hands lingering for just a moment too long
on Fitzgerald's self-admittedly firm shoulder blades.
"By turning out the women and bi-curious voters, we
swept this shit," Herbert exclaimed. "Babes dig the dim
ples."
As freshman writer and Daily rising star Ben Eppler
gushed,"l love fucking Patrick Fitzgerald."
Among other goals, Fitzgerald hopes to conduct enough
sexual favors to get The Daily back into the good graces of
the student body — or in lieu of that, practice good, clean
American journalism in the tradition of his mentor and
grand "old man" of The Daily, Will Oremus.
"In particular, I've been hearing the editorial board has
been having some rough times among those in the commu
nity lately," he said. "But I know the ASSU wants a taste."
