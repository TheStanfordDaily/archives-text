that senior Claire Wagenseil had been charged
with battery. In actuality, she was charged with
the lesser offense of assault.
Wednesday's article "Program caters to grads
with interest in business" inaccurately stated
that Mark Horowitz and Chuck Holloway were
the founders of Yahoo! Mark Horowitz is actu
ally the Yahoo! Founders Professor in the

quoted a Terry Seelig. This was not the source
but the result of a mix up between two sources
â€” Tina Selig and Terry Winograd.The story also
incorrectly referred to The Stanford Ventures
Design Program as a sponsor of the Hasso Plat
