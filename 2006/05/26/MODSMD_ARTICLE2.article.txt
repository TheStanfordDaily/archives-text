financiers. Few realize
that that dream is reality /
for several Stanford un- B

dergraduates who play for big money online —
sometimes losing or winning tens of thousands of
dollars in a single day.
Texas Hold 'em exploded as a national sensa
tion in 2003, the year that ESPN first broadcast the
World Series of Poker. By now, countless teens and
college students have been drawn into the game by
the proliferation of Internet gambling sites —
there are now 2,400 of them — and the allure of
easy money. On just a single site, Party Poker.com,
betters wagered an average of $1,454 a second last
year, according to an article last month in The New
York Times. Internet poker tournaments now
boast over 300,000 participants, up from just
150,000 in 2001.
Most of these players are amateurs, fresh from
reading game handbooks and hoping to get lucky,
or just looking for a new sport to get hooked on.
But a few, including several Stanford students, have
turned the game into a lucrative part-time career.
Ken Kao, a freshman living in Paloma, began
playing low-stakes tables his junior year of high
school but only recently grew serious about the
game. Now, after working his way up to higher

stakes, he says he can earn $500 an hour playing eight or
more online games simultaneously. He recently used
some of his winnings to pay off $20,000 in school loans,
and then indulged himself with a 48-inch flat-screen IV
for his dorm room.
"You get really desensitized to money," he said.
"This is gonna sound really had, but when you're online
you see these bets that are $300 — you can't really think
of it as $300.1 think,'Oh, brownie points.' When I took a
break in January and then came back 1 was re-sensitized
and I thought,' Whoa this is a lot of money.'"
How much money? Kao estimates that his biggest
single-day loss was $30,000. His biggest single-day win,
however, was nearly twice that amount.
Kao is one of many young amateurs that discovered
the sport in the wake of Chris Moneymaker's unexpect
ed win at the 2003 World Series of Poker. The 27-year
old Moneymaker walked away from that game with
$2.5 million and the reverence of legions of would-be
poker pros.
Nima, a sophomore that asked not to be identified
by his last name to prevent his family from learning
about his gambling, treats online poker with the serious
ness of a priest. He reads the available handbooks and
articles and visits an online discussion forum to get feed
back on his strategy from other players.
"It's a game for the long run,"he said."As long as the
person plays his game constantly and always focuses
and plays his best — and studying, studying, studying."
Nima tapped into his winnings four months ago to
purchase a new 2006 Infiniti G35. But his tastes, for the
most part, are not extravagant. Most of his spending is
on DVDs and gadgets, and the rest goes toward savings.
Like Kao, he views the money with a certain amount of
indifference.
"At some point when you step back you realize I'm
sitting at a table with $30,000. and that is a shock to you,"
he said.
Both Nima and Kao were also stunned by the taxes
they have to pay on their winnings. Professional poker
players have to register with the IRS as self-employed
business operators, meaning their tax burden tends to
be heavier than that of an average citizen. Kao esti
mates that 35 to 40 percent of his winnings go to Uncle
Sam.
But the hefty taxes do not keep them from dreaming
big. Nima plans to earn several hundred dollars an hour
playing poker full-time this summer. He hopes to put a
down payment on a house in Palo Alto this fall.
Kao has a simpler plan.
"I want to have a million dollars by the end of col
lege," he said.
