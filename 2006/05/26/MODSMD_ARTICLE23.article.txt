# Three times as sweet
## Women's Tennis: 30-0, Pac-10 Champions, National Champions 
### 
NCAA threepeat. That
sums up a season, in
which women's ten
nis spent the entire time un
defeated and at the top of the
rankings. In the season's 30
dual matches, the team
earned 156 points to its op
ponents' total of 13, and
blanked its opponents in 21
of those matches.
The team was deep, and
strong all the way down the
ranks —all six of the Cardinal's
starting singles players quali
fied for the ongoing NCAA
Singles Championship, and
two of its three doubles teams
are competing in the NCAA
Doubles Championship.
Four of the team's 11
members graduate next
month, including the top two
singles players: Amber Liu,
who was just named the In
tercollegiate Tennis Associa

tion's Senior Player of the
Year and has won two
NCAA singles titles and was
runner-up in last year's
NCAA Doubles Champi
onship, and Alice Barnes,
who was just named the
NCAA tournament's Most
Outstanding Player for third

straight year and is a reigning
NCAA doubles champion.
Still, the team should con
tinue to dominate college
tennis, and a fourth-straight
national title doesn't seem at
all far-fetched of a goal.
