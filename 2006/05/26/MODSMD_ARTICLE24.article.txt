### 
Women's Water Polo:
24-5,10-2 MPSF, 3RD AT NCAAS

It's a long season, but at the end, every minute
counts — that's the lesson the Stanford
women's water polo team learned the hard
way after falling in defeat to rival UCLA in the
NCAA semifinals, 8-5.
A slow start left the Cardinal trailing 3-0 after one
period of play in their showdown against the Bruins.
While they were unable to close the gap, the Cardi
nal refused to back down as the clock ran out on reg
ulation, continuing to show the indomitable heart
and soul with which they had played all season.
The team rebounded the next day to take third
place in the tournament, defeating Hawaii 8-5 in
convincing fashion. Senior driver Scotti Shafer
closed out her collegiate career with two goals, lead
ing the Cardinal in scoring for the third straight day.
Seniors Laurel Champion and Nancy El-Sakkary
also put the finishing touches on their outstanding
careers on the Farm. Champion stepped up with her
usual stifling defensive play, and El-Sakkary netted
a beautiful skip-shot while once again proved her
self as one of Stanford's most reliable players at set.
It was a season of highlights for the Stanford
women, who claimed the MPSF Championship for
the first time since 2003. Freshman newcomer Lolo
Silver and junior driver Katie Hansen netted a
combined 98 goals on the year, while juniors
Christina Hewko and Alison Gregorka made in
valuable contributions in both ends of the pool.
Goalie Meridith McColl topped 200 saves for the
season and was named one of three finalists for the
Peter J. Cutino award — given to honor the top fe
male water polo player of the year.
