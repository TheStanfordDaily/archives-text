Men's Golf: 6th Place in Pac-10 Championships
14th at West Regionals

g doming off a strong year with then-fresh
man Rob Grube earning the NCAA
West Regional title and the team earning
its first trip to the NCAA Championship, men's
golf had all the ingredients to come out even bet
ter this year. Grube was returning, along with
second-year coach Conrad Ray, and another
top-ranked freshman class was introduced.
Expectations ran high, but the Cardinal were
unable able to keep up. Failing to earn another
NCAA Championship berth, the team tied for
14th at the West Regional and sixth at the Pac
-10 Championship, capping a season with many
highs and lows.
After a disappointing fall, the men defeated
highly-ranked Oklahoma State and finished
third at the Collegiate Match Play Champi
onship in November. The momentum carried
over to the spring when the Cardinal had four
top-five finishes, but were eluded of a team title;
they came as close as second place at the West

em Intercollegiate.
Grube secured two individual titles, at the
Western and U.S. Intercollegiates, but was un
able to again claim the Regional title, tying for
57th instead. He also finished tied for sixth at
the Pac-10, compared to fourth the previous
year. Grube still earned co-Pac-10 Golfer of the
Year honors.
Junior Zack Miller also proved a team leader
alongside Grube, with solid performances
throughout spring, including second at the Ash
worth Invitational and a tie for ninth at the U.S.
Intercollegiate. He earned All-Pac-10 Second
Team honors.
Freshmen Dodge Kemmer and Daniel Lim
became immediate presences on the team as
Kemmer tied for 10th at the Pac-10 Champi
onships and led the Cardinal at the Regional,
tying for 32nd. Lim tied for eighth at the West
ern Intercollegiate.
With another impressive freshman class of
two amateur champions coming to the Farm
next year, the team is looking to take what it
learned this year and perform on par with its
high expectations.
