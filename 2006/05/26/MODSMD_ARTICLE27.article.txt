Men's Tennis: 18-4,6-1 Pac-10, Co-Pac- 10 Champions

After cruising to a 18-4 record, the Stanford men's tennis team ended their season
with a heartbreaking 4-3 loss to No. 4 Baylor in the quarterfinals of the team
championship on Sunday night.
Fueled by a lineup that included two new freshmen, Stanford boasts two singles play
ers as well as a doubles team ranked in the top-25. Additionally, at the Pac-10 individual
tournament, Stanford players picked up first and second place as well as the titles for the
invitational singles and doubles draws.
By notching a 6-1 record in team competitions in the Pac-10,Stanford also shared rights
to the Pac-10 title with UCLA.
Stanford started off the season strong with six straight wins before dropping its first loss
of the season to Baylor in late February. Of those six wins, two of them were 4-3 wins over
Southern California counterparts — No. 10 UCLA and USC.
