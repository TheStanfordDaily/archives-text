Track and Field:
Men: 7th in Pac-10, Women: 2nd in Pac-10

The men's track team entered the 2006 season with high hopes. After a sixth
place finish in the Pac-10 in 2005, this year's squad seemed poised to leap
up the standings. But although several athletes showed improvement and
put up personal bests, the team did not reach its goals of moving up in the con
ference, finishing seventh in this season's Pac-10 Championships.
Sophomore Russell Brown nearly came away with an individual title, but was
overtaken in the final 200 meters of a 1500 meter race to place second. His finish
was the best among all the Cards male competitors. The season has not conclud
ed, and a few athletes still have another chance at the NCAA Regionals.
To date, the women's side has had a great season that is still going strong.The
team earned three Pac-10 Athlete of the Week honors, and has had records go
down all year. In particular,sophomore Chauntae Bayne,junior Arianna Lam
bie, and senior Sarah Hopping all had spectacular seasons. Sophomore Erica
McLain became the Pac-10's first woman to win two individual titles for two
consecutive seasons this year, winning the long and triple jump. The team fin
ished second at this year's Pac-10 Championships, but was hurt by injuries
along the way.
