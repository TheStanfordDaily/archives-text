Women's Lacrosse: 12-6, MPSF Champions
First-ever NCAA Tournament appearance

Stanford women's lacrosse finished off a remarkable season on a
bittersweet note last week, falling to No. 1 Northwestern in the
first round of the NCAA Championship. The squad had a rocky
start to the season, falling to Cal and Notre Dame early on. But the team
gained momentum after dominating UC Davis 20-6 shortly after the
Western States tournament to spark a six game winning streak that in
cluded a second-straight MPSF Conference title, as well as a spot in the
NCAA Tournament.
Notable matches included a late season win against No. 10 Cornell.
Cornell was expected to win the match, but the Cardinal, riding a four
game winning streak at the time, defeated the Big Red 5-4 and sopho
more attack Daphne Patterson and senior attack Megan Burker scoring
two goals a piece.
Burker and fellow senior attack Sarah Bach were top performers
throughout year. Burkers final goal as a member of the Cardinal squad came
against the Wildcats in the first round of the NCAAs. Burker netted her
143 rd goal, sealing her place as top goal-scorer for Stanford lacrosse. The
squad will be losing Burker, Bach and several other seniors but hopes to re
turn with a young team next year and better this year's solid performance.
