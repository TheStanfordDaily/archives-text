# CAMPUS SPEAKERS
## Feminism can't solve all, Muslim speaker advises 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Stressing open-mindedness, education and humili
ty as requirements for Western feminists hoping to aid
Muslim women, Asifa Quraishi gave a talk last night
entitled "Western Advocacy for Muslim Women: It's
Not Just the Thought That Counts." An assistant pro
fessor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Law
School and a specialist in Islamic law and legal theory,
Quraishi discussed the potentially harmful effects mis
guided efforts from Western feminists can have on the
Muslim women they are trying to help.
The event was planned by the Islamic Society of
Stanford University (ISSU) and the Muslim Students
Awareness Network (MSAN) in response to increas
ing attention on the status of Muslim women as seen
in headlines last year about a woman sentenced to be
raped to preserve the honor of her family.
Student organizers said they hoped the event
would increase awareness about women's rights.
In an email to The Daily, ISSU organizer and elec
trical engineering graduate student Salman Latif said,
"We wanted to have an event where we could start a
discussion on how Muslims in the West and western
human rights organizations can work together, realiz
ing that we share the same goals."
Quraishi began her speech by observing that West
ern feminists often use "conflicts of strategies that are
ultimately detrimental in the long run to the very
women they are trying to aid."
She cited basic misconceptions about
Islam and Islamic law as main causes of
these unintended negative consequences,
arguing that Western feminists sometimes
have an "innate, often subconscious sense
of superiority" and approach issues facing
Muslim women with a "rescue mentality."
"It is a situation of friends, but they are
not having a conversation as equals."
Quraishi said. "Western women generally
don't even realize there is this disconnect."
She argued that sometimes well-inten
tioned Western feminists undermine the
efforts of Muslim women, giving abortion
rights as an example. By pushing reproduc
tive rights so strongly at an international
conference, Western activists generated a
negative response, making abortions more
difficult to obtain than they had been pre
viously.
By not understanding the Islamic per
spective, Quraishi argued, activists can
turn the issue into an "Islam versus the
West" conversation, which is not produc
tive with and often does not leave the
women any options. It is better to provide
women arguments that come from within
the Islamic tradition, she said.
She mentioned Zina, which is the crime
of adultery. Pregnant, unmarried women
might be punished under the law, even if
they have been raped, she said.
"Western feminists usually don't have a
filter of what is Islam, so things get lumped
all together," Quraishi said. "It is funda
mentally assumed Islam is part of the prob
lem so there is the attitude of why should
we even bother looking into what they

think about this issue."
"Does it actually hurt to have an ap
proach that doesn't take nuances of Islam
ic law into account?"she asked."! think it
does."
Quraishi also addressed how the image
of a woman in a veil has become a symbol
for oppression in the United States.
Rhetoric about "saving the women of the
East" is sometimes used to justify colonial
ism. Today this image is again employed by
Western feminists, causing the Muslim
world to perceive some activism as colo
nialist.
"I fundamentally disagree with the veil
being a public issue at all," Quraishi said.
"But I'm talking about it because it has be
come an obsession."
She stressed that in the West there is an
assumption that Muslim women are forced
to dress a certain way. dismissing reasons
for a woman to wear a veil.
"Western women often don't want to
admit that there may be liberating, em
powering reasons for wearing a veil," she
said.
Westerners don't always realize that the
veil is a loaded issue in the Muslim world
too.
"Women are categorized and put into
boxes based on what they wear," Quraishi
said. "There is no way to opt out of this
conversation."
She explained that if a Muslim woman
wears a veil, she is taken less seriously by
Western women; but that if she does not
wear a veil, she isn't respected in some
Muslim communities, especially if she is
speaking about women's issues.

"Where she gains credibility in one cir
cle, she loses it in another," Quraishi said.
She said she doesn't believe that West
ern feminists should neglect the issues con
fronting Muslim women, but that they
have to approach the issue with more re
spect and humility.
"I think we would all be better off work
ing together, but the fundamental attitude
that Islam is the problem has to go away,"
she said. "It would be best if we could work

together but people need a broader appre
ciation of who they're working for and
what they're working with."
Student organizers said they were
pleased to see a well-known Islamic legal
figure to campus.
"[Quraishi] is essentially an American-
Muslim celebrity so it's an honor to have
her here," said ISSU's Financial Advisor
Sanah Parmez, a sophomore, about the
event.


University of Wisconsin- Madison Law Prof. Asifa Quraishi spoke in the Psychology build
ing last night about western women's advocacy for Islamic women. She said that well-in
tentioned feminists in the West can only make matters worse for Muslim women.
