## Battling for a POSTSEASON CHANCE 
### 
BASEBALL: 30-23,11-13 PAC-10

Stanford baseball has had as many up
and downs as a roller coaster and with
two games left in the regular-season,
the Cardinal still don't know where their
ride will end.
The Card got off to a hot start, as the squad
opened with a sweep of then-N0.5 Cal State-
Fullerton. Stanford also took two of three
from defending national champion Texas in
the opening weeks.
The month of March, however, was shaky
as Stanford went 3-5, including a stretch of
four straight losses. The season?s low point
was a three game sweep at the hands of
Oregon State, capped off by a 12-1 mercy
rule loss.
After losing four straight Pac-10 series, the
Cardinal snapped out of their funk on April
30 against Arizona State.
Stanford came alive after the series win
over the Sun Devils, winning their next two
conference series, including a sweep of Wash
ington.
Conference play has ended but Stanford
has this week to make a final push for a post
season spot. The 30-23 Cardinal learn if they
earned one of 64 NCAA bids on Monday.

TURNING TWO: Senior shortstop Chris Minaker leads the Cardinal in nearly
every offensive category. He will lead Stanford onto the field for two more regular
season contests.
