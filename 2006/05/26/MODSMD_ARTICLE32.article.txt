### VICTOR FUSTE INTERMISSION PROFESSOR X 
Kevin Smith was right — the "X-men" franchise is a thinly veiled al
legory for being gay in America. All three films deal with seeking accept
ance in a world that misunderstands and even fears a minority of people
who try to fit in with society. These mutants, or "homo superior," are gift
ed with special powers the moment they hit puberty, ranging from a
forked tongue to the ability to control the weather. Their parents, like
Bobby "Iceman" Drake discovers in "X 2," even ask them if they've
"tried not being a mutant." Persecuted for being different, they must
deal with the intolerance of ignorant Americans, only to find that Amer
ica would much rather "cure" them than accept them into society.
This is where "X3:The Last Stand," the third and supposedly final in
stallment of the "X-men" franchise begins. Given that the last two "X
-men" films were successfully directed by the openly gay Bryan Singer
and led by lan McKellen (Magneto), an actor renowned for both his fan
tastic acting skills and his sexual orientation,it makes sense that "X-men:
The Last Stand" would continue to promote its message of acceptance.
Sadly, this message is lost amidst a whole slew of problems that plague
an easily digestible, if not overly short movie that will satisfy the general
populace but leave long-time "X-men" fans severely disappointed.
Set in San Francisco (where else?) the story is loosely based on a
| comic book storyline penned by Joss Whedon ("Serenity") and deals
with a pharmaceutical company's discovery of a drug that permanently
suppresses the mutant genome, thereby eliminating mutants from exis
tence. For obviously reasons, this creates a schism in the mutant commu
nity since some mutants like

Magneto (McKellen) don't see
anything wrong with being a mu
tant. while others like Rogue
(Anna Pacquin) just want to be
able to touch someone without
killing them. A cheap version of
the Dark Phoenix storyline is
thrown in for good measure, but
the explanation for why Jean
Grey (Famke Janssen) comes
back from the dead is as corn-

plex as "she must have made a telekinetic cocoon to save her from the
millions of cubic tons of lake water." Yeah, I know.
As inconsequential as a story may be to some people, it's a shame this
one doesn't measure up to the previous films. It does, however, try to
make up for a lackluster plot with an excessive amount of action se
quences. And while it's fan-boy heaven to see Iceman in full ice form,
Wolverine and Colossus doing the Fastball Special, or Beast bounding
around in full ass-kicking mode, it seemed that most of the "bad guy"
mutants (you can tell they're bad because they have tattoos) had one
special power: jumping a lot. As useful as this may be on a basketball

court, if you want to see flashy special effects, watching people jump
around is really lame.
Which brings me to my next beef: the dialogue. Imagine every action
movie cliche, add a $ 1.00 million dollar budget and — surprise — it's still
bad dialogue. The one liners are unbelievably overdone ("Not if I can
help it!" or "Hold the line!") and no replacement for the character de
velopment that was so clearly done away with for the sake of more
leather-clad mutants spitting inane, although sometimes funny lines
("I'm Juggernaut, bitch!")
This movie is all about wasted potential. Angel (Ben Foster) flies in
and out of the movie quicker than Quicksilver on speed. Colossus
(Daniel Cudmore) has maybe three lines and is relegated to the back
ground even though he should be on the front lines, throwing cars and
demolishing buildings. Juggernaut, played by the ever-precocious Brit
Vinnie Jones, felt like he was just thrown in there for the hell of it. Even
Beast, whose make-up barely hides the Frasier Crane-like snobbery of
Kelsey Grammer, was only in the movie for the sake of having another
blue-skinned character. I guess the special effects for Nightcrawler were
just too expensive, so he was dropped faster than the Golden Gate
Bridge on Alcatraz — and yes, it's as ridiculous as it sounds. If they ever
release a director's cut. let's hope some of these secondary characters get

Look up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's a freak of nature with giant wings breaking out of a window! Why, Ratner, why?

a little more face time since they ended up as an under exploited re
source of general badassery.
Hell, 1 would have even liked a little more time on the whole M
Rogue/Iceman relationship, but instead all we get is an unbelievably un
necessary and infuriating death of a main — nay, essential main charac
ter. By killing off this one character, who will remain unnamed for the
sake of the readers' blood pressure, director Brett Ratner ("Rush
Hour") has garnered my unending hatred. Be forewarned, I actually |
yelled when it happened, leading to some awkward stares from the peo
pie around me. Chances are you will feel the same way too.
This is the "Godfather Pt.III" of this trilogy — you should see it once, II
but never see it again. Admittedly, my perspective is biased by years of
reading "X-men" comic books, but I really wish 20th Century Fox had
n't escorted ,I X2" director Bryan Singer off the lot when he chose to di- IM
rect "Superman Returns." I simply cannot express in words the unbri
dled hatred I had for Ratner the moment the credits rolled — for him
to tarnish the quality of one of my favorite movie franchises is unforgiv
able. "X3:7lie Last Stand" may be an allegory for tolerance and accept
ance. but if there's one thing I can't tolerate it's Brett Ratner. Hopefully l;a
Singer's "Superman Returns" will help me learn to love men in tight
spandex once again.

This movie is all about wasted potential. Angel (Ben Foster) flies in
and out of the movie quicker than Quicksilver on speed. Colossus
(Daniel Cudmore) has maybe three lines and is relegated to the back
ground even though he should be on the front lines, throwing cars and
demolishing buildings. Juggernaut, played by the ever-precocious Brit
Vinnie Jones, felt like he was just thrown in there for the hell of it. Even
Beast, whose make-up barely hides the Frasier Crane-like snobbery of
Kelsey Grammer, was only in the movie for the sake of having another
blue-skinned character. I guess the special effects for Nightcrawler were
just too expensive, so he was dropped faster than the Golden Gate
Bridge on Alcatraz — and yes, it's as ridiculous as it sounds. If they ever
release a director's cut. let's hope some of these secondary characters get

Look up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's a freak of nature with giant wings breaking out of a window! Why, Ratner, why?

a little more face time since they ended up as an under exploited re
source of general badassery.
Hell, 1 would have even liked a little more time on the whole M
Rogue/Iceman relationship, but instead all we get is an unbelievably un
necessary and infuriating death of a main — nay, essential main charac
ter. By killing off this one character, who will remain unnamed for the
sake of the readers' blood pressure, director Brett Ratner ("Rush
Hour") has garnered my unending hatred. Be forewarned, I actually |
yelled when it happened, leading to some awkward stares from the peo
pie around me. Chances are you will feel the same way too.
This is the "Godfather Pt.III" of this trilogy — you should see it once, II
but never see it again. Admittedly, my perspective is biased by years of
reading "X-men" comic books, but I really wish 20th Century Fox had
n't escorted ,I X2" director Bryan Singer off the lot when he chose to di- IM
rect "Superman Returns." I simply cannot express in words the unbri
dled hatred I had for Ratner the moment the credits rolled — for him
to tarnish the quality of one of my favorite movie franchises is unforgiv
able. "X3:7lie Last Stand" may be an allegory for tolerance and accept
ance. but if there's one thing I can't tolerate it's Brett Ratner. Hopefully l;a
Singer's "Superman Returns" will help me learn to love men in tight
spandex once again.
