# EDITOR'S NOTE
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN BETSY CONGDON INTERMISSION EDITORS ... OF THE FUTURE 
As quickly as this volume camc, it has now
gone. Well, there's one more issue, to be tech
nical about it. But here at Intermission, we
focus not on the now, but the ... uh. soon.
And the after party.
Patrick Fitzgerald has now been elected

Editor-in-Chief of Volume 230. Within min
utes of his victory, he assured us that the two
of us would indeed have the privilege of car
rying on the Intermission torch. While both of
us have already done this job more than once,
we felt that this was an offer we could not re
fuse. Call us the Rumsfelds of The Daily, if
you will. But without the whole Iraq thing.
We will take this charge quite seriously.
After all, not just anyone can be Intermission
editor. One must Ik* willing to answer annoy

ing e-mails. One must be willing to edit some
times appalling articles. One must — and this
is an absolute necessity — be willing to of
fend writers to the point that they no longer
wish to author material for the publication.
(Editor's note ... well, at least a note
from ONE editor: Betsy strongly objects to
that.)
(Counter Editor's note: Brendan strongly
encourages that.)
But what happened to Victor, you might

ask? Or Dim? Or Sam? Or even that mischie
vous Caley, who defected to Sports and stole
our hearts in the process? Or Vross?
Victor is "stressing." Tarn is (actually)
graduating. Sam became distant, but still
somehow made it into Phi Beta Kappa as a
junior. Caley is going to Australia. Vross is
being lame and not going to Canada.
Seriously, though, we're all excited about
this upcoming volume. We hope you are, too.
Because you're going to be seeing A LOr of it.
