## Dearth of diversity in natural science faculty Math, natural science have few tenured Black, Latino faculty 
### NIRAJ SHETH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The faculties of Stanford's natural science
departments are renowned for their academ
ic achievements, but certain minorities are se
riously underrepresented among them. While
the University has struggled to recruit and re
tain diverse faculty, many say it may be push
ing new efforts to do so.
Currently, the Chemistry Department has

no black. Native American or Latino faculty
members and has had only one in its entire
history. The Physics Department, meanwhile,
has only one Latino member. Prof. Bias Cabr
era, out of a faculty of 33.
Blacks in particular are underrepresented
on natural science faculties. Neither the
Chemistry nor Mathematics Departments has
ever had a black member on their faculties.
Physics Prof. Art Walker was the only black
member of that faculty until his death in 2(K)1.
In comparison, female representation is
significantly stronger on these same faculties.
The Physics Department currently has five fe-

male professors and another will
join the faculty next year. There are
also two women on the Chemistry
faculty, which has had women facul
ty members dating back to 1927.
And the Math Department, which
currently has no minority faculty
members, has two women.
Sally Dickson, associate vice
provost for faculty development,
told The Daily that while the Uni
versity encourages the recruitment
of diverse faculty candidates, it has
had difficulty achieving its goals in
the natural sciences. According to
Dickson, there are fewer doctorates
awarded to minorities in the natural
sciences than in other fields, and
therefore a smaller pipeline of qual
ified applicants of color.
"But it is wrong to say that be
cause the pipeline is very thin, that
ends the challenge," she said.
The University does make spe
cial efforts to recruit faculty of
color across all fields. According to
the publication "Building on Excel
lence"— Stanford's official guide
to recruiting and retaining diverse
faculty — these efforts include
reaching out to qualified minority

candidates during faculty searches,
actively seeking to increase minori
ty faculty leadership and monitor
ing the representation of women
and minorities on a yearly basis.
As Dickson explained, the first
step to having a more diverse facul
ty in the natural sciences is promot
ing a more diverse graduate student
body in these fields. And this
process begins at the undergradu
ate level, where minorities thinking
about majoring in the natural sci
ences should be encouraged to con
sider academic careers.
Having a diverse faculty to begin
with has helped improve diversity
in the graduate student body. Me
chanical Engineering Ph.D. candi
date Cullen Buie, co-chair of the
Graduate Student Council's Diver
sity Committee, explained that,
during his tenure, Walker was in
strumental in helping Stanford
award more doctorates in physics
to blacks than any other university.
Dickson concurred with this
opinion, stating that it would help
to have minority role models in
these fields to improve diversity.
One such opportunity has
emerged recently, as Stanford may
be in contact with Edray Goins, a
prominent black mathematics pro
fessor at Purdue University. Goins
has made a name for himself in his
field with his work on Fermat's last

theorem.
At a panel discussion last Mon
day hosted by Movimiento Estudi
antil Chicano de Aztlan (MECha)
and several other ethnic groups re
garding diversity in the graduate
student body and faculty, a ques
tion was raised regarding Goins.
Sources at the meeting have of
fered different accounts of what
happened.
According to Buie — who was a
graduate student representative on
the panel — and one other event
attendee, Dickson said that Stan
ford is making an offer to Goins.
Sophomore Bernard Fraga, an
organizer of the event, said that
there might have been some mis
communication. Dickson only im
plied that the University is interest
ed in Goins and not that an offer
has been made, he said.
Dickson firmly denies making
any such a comment at the discus
sion.
"I did say that I recently became
aware of Prof. Goins," she said in an
email to The Daily. "I made no
statement about Stanford making
an offer to him."
A source within the Mathemat
ics Department confirmed that no
offer has been made. Department
Chair Yakov Eliashberg was out of
town and could not be reached for
comment about the professor.
