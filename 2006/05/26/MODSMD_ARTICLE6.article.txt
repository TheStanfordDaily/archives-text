# Univ. defends living wage
## SLAG says new wage for subcontracted workers ineffectual; Univ. has no more changes planned 
### ANDREA FULLER STAFF WRITER 
Stanford administrators remain
firmly in support of the new living wage
plan they announced on May 8, despite
the Stanford Labor Action Coalition's
(SLAC) claims that the shift in policy
was ineffectual.
The plan increases compensation
for subcontracted workers by 10 per
cent, providing $ 11.15 an hour for those
receiving health benefits and $12.59 an
hour for those without. The policy con
tains seven restrictions, most notably its
exclusion of unionized workers.
Executive Director of Human Re
sources Diane Peck said she had heard
of no plans to change the new wage pol
icy.
"I haven't had any conversation
with anybody about changing the
wages we just announced," she said. "1
think this a fair amount. And 1 don't
know of any plans to revisit those num
bers."
Director of University Communica
tions Alan Acosta echoed her senti
ment.
"Although we certainly feel it is le
gitimate and appropriate for students
and others to make their opinions
known through peaceful protest and
other means, the policy decisions are
driven by the University's commitment
to the principles of fairness and appre
ciation for the hard work of people who
contribute to the University's mission,"
he said.
Acosta added that no single organi
zation will broadly influence the Uni

versity's policy.
Despite the confident stance from
school officials, SLAC still argues the
policy does not have enough of an im
pact.
SLAC spokesman Matt Seriff-Cul
lick, a sophomore, said that he hoped
the public protests on May 11 would
bring awareness to the argument that
the University's living wage policy does
not do enough to help workers.
"It's hard to gauge any effect in the
first regard, but I think the rally itself,
the press coverage following it and the
series of teach-ins we're now conduct
ing are really starting to perk peoples'
ears to what, in my mind, is a pretty ac
cessible and clear-cut issue," he said.
"And since the rally, there's definitely a
sense of momentum that will carry us
through the end of the year and into
next year so that we can hit the ground
running."
Seriff-Cullick said the next step for
SLAC will be to develop teach-ins.
"We hope to get to as many dorms
and houses as possible for the end of
the year," he said. "The teach-ins in
volve a living wage workshop, which is
an interactive exercise that makes tan
gible, with specific numbers, the cuts
and sacrifices that have to be made
when you're not earning a living wage
— things like eliminating healthcare or
struggling to cut your food budget in
half. The second half goes over the ad
ministration's current living wage poli
cy and what needs to be changed for us
to have a real living wage on campus."
"We don't respond to any particu
lar group's demands or analysis," he
said. "Policy is not driven by one
group's demands. You take many peo
ple's opinions into consideration and
think about what's best for the Uni
versity."
"We're not saying that the living
wage policy is a bad idea," Seriff-Cul
lick said. "We're saying it's a good
idea. The administration agrees in
theory, but their version of a living
wage policy applies to almost no one,
has never been enforced and falls
below an actual living wage for Santa
Clara County as calculated by the
nonpartisan, nonprofit organization
the California Budget Project."
He argued that the University
should make a number of changes to
its policy.
"All of the seven restrictions
should be removed," he said. "Con
tractors should be required to show
evidence of compliance as a condition
of receiving a contract and should be
audited regularly to ensure compli
ance, and that the policy should con
tain an explicit, transparent review
process that will allow its level to be
tacked to the cost of living. We would

also like to see guarantees for the
right to organize without interference
by the University, so that workers
have the ability to hold the University
accountable when it fails to enforce its
own policies."
Peck disagreed, stating that Stan
ford's living wage policy is fair. She
cited her work on the Presidential
Advisory Committee on Workplace
Policies — a panel convened by the
president's office to compare Stan
ford's wages to those of other Bay
Area employers.
"We go out everywhere to see staff
salaries and see what the marketplace
is saying," she said. "We went to about
seven Bay Area government agencies
like the City of San Jose and the City
of San Francisco, and we found out
what their living wage policy was cur
rently. We used that information to
form our recommendation to Presi
dent Hennessy. SLAC could argue
that all of the Bay Area organizations
are wrong, but 1 don't think that's the
case and we put a lot of thought into
this."
Acosta said he felt that Stanford's
living policy is not only fair, but also
unique.

"The increase in the minimum
wage for this sizable group of affected
workers reflects our desire to ac
knowledge the contribution these
workers make and the importance ol
the services they provide," he said.
"To the best of our knowledge, Stan
ford is the only private institution of
its size in the Bay Area to have such a
policy. The University's leaders are
aware that the cost of living in the Bay
Area is a challenge to many workers,
whether they work on our campus or
elsewhere."
Seriff-Cullick said he hoped that
SLAC and the University can reach
an agreement.
"Ideally, we'd love this to be a co
operative process with the Universi
ty," he said."Our ideas can be commu
nicated much more effectively across
a table than with picket signs and slo
gans. Currently, both the head of
Human Resources and President
Hennessy himself have ignored our
requests for information and refused
to meet with us, so that's why we've
turned to protests, and that's what
we'll continue to do until the adminis
tration listens to the voice of the stu
dents and workers."

Director of University Communica
tions Alan Acosta echoed her senti
ment.
"Although we certainly feel it is le
gitimate and appropriate for students
and others to make their opinions
known through peaceful protest and
other means, the policy decisions are
driven by the University's commitment
to the principles of fairness and appre
ciation for the hard work of people who
contribute to the University's mission,"
he said.
Acosta added that no single organi
zation will broadly influence the Uni

versity's policy.
Despite the confident stance from
school officials, SLAC still argues the
policy does not have enough of an im
pact.
SLAC spokesman Matt Seriff-Cul
lick, a sophomore, said that he hoped
the public protests on May 11 would
bring awareness to the argument that
the University's living wage policy does
not do enough to help workers.
"It's hard to gauge any effect in the
first regard, but I think the rally itself,
the press coverage following it and the
series of teach-ins we're now conduct
ing are really starting to perk peoples'
ears to what, in my mind, is a pretty ac
cessible and clear-cut issue," he said.
"And since the rally, there's definitely a
sense of momentum that will carry us
through the end of the year and into
next year so that we can hit the ground
running."
Seriff-Cullick said the next step for
SLAC will be to develop teach-ins.
"We hope to get to as many dorms
and houses as possible for the end of
the year," he said. "The teach-ins in
volve a living wage workshop, which is
an interactive exercise that makes tan
gible, with specific numbers, the cuts
and sacrifices that have to be made
when you're not earning a living wage
— things like eliminating healthcare or
struggling to cut your food budget in
half. The second half goes over the ad
ministration's current living wage poli
cy and what needs to be changed for us
to have a real living wage on campus."
"We don't respond to any particu
lar group's demands or analysis," he
said. "Policy is not driven by one
group's demands. You take many peo
ple's opinions into consideration and
think about what's best for the Uni
versity."
"We're not saying that the living
wage policy is a bad idea," Seriff-Cul
lick said. "We're saying it's a good
idea. The administration agrees in
theory, but their version of a living
wage policy applies to almost no one,
has never been enforced and falls
below an actual living wage for Santa
Clara County as calculated by the
nonpartisan, nonprofit organization
the California Budget Project."
He argued that the University
should make a number of changes to
its policy.
"All of the seven restrictions
should be removed," he said. "Con
tractors should be required to show
evidence of compliance as a condition
of receiving a contract and should be
audited regularly to ensure compli
ance, and that the policy should con
tain an explicit, transparent review
process that will allow its level to be
tacked to the cost of living. We would

also like to see guarantees for the
right to organize without interference
by the University, so that workers
have the ability to hold the University
accountable when it fails to enforce its
own policies."
Peck disagreed, stating that Stan
ford's living wage policy is fair. She
cited her work on the Presidential
Advisory Committee on Workplace
Policies — a panel convened by the
president's office to compare Stan
ford's wages to those of other Bay
Area employers.
"We go out everywhere to see staff
salaries and see what the marketplace
is saying," she said. "We went to about
seven Bay Area government agencies
like the City of San Jose and the City
of San Francisco, and we found out
what their living wage policy was cur
rently. We used that information to
form our recommendation to Presi
dent Hennessy. SLAC could argue
that all of the Bay Area organizations
are wrong, but 1 don't think that's the
case and we put a lot of thought into
this."
Acosta said he felt that Stanford's
living policy is not only fair, but also
unique.

"The increase in the minimum
wage for this sizable group of affected
workers reflects our desire to ac
knowledge the contribution these
workers make and the importance ol
the services they provide," he said.
"To the best of our knowledge, Stan
ford is the only private institution of
its size in the Bay Area to have such a
policy. The University's leaders are
aware that the cost of living in the Bay
Area is a challenge to many workers,
whether they work on our campus or
elsewhere."
Seriff-Cullick said he hoped that
SLAC and the University can reach
an agreement.
"Ideally, we'd love this to be a co
operative process with the Universi
ty," he said."Our ideas can be commu
nicated much more effectively across
a table than with picket signs and slo
gans. Currently, both the head of
Human Resources and President
Hennessy himself have ignored our
requests for information and refused
to meet with us, so that's why we've
turned to protests, and that's what
we'll continue to do until the adminis
tration listens to the voice of the stu
dents and workers."
