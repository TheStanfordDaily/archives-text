# Univ. defends living wage
## SLAG says new wage for subcontracted workers ineffectual; Univ. has no more changes planned 
### ANDREA FULLER STAFF WRITER 
Stanford administrators remain
firmly in support of the new living wage
plan they announced on May 8, despite
the Stanford Labor Action Coalition's
(SLAC) claims that the shift in policy
was ineffectual.
The plan increases compensation
for subcontracted workers by 10 per
cent, providing $ 11.15 an hour for those
receiving health benefits and $12.59 an
hour for those without. The policy con
tains seven restrictions, most notably its
exclusion of unionized workers.
Executive Director of Human Re
sources Diane Peck said she had heard
of no plans to change the new wage pol
icy.
"I haven't had any conversation
with anybody about changing the
wages we just announced," she said. "1
think this a fair amount. And 1 don't
know of any plans to revisit those num
bers."
Director of University Communica
tions Alan Acosta echoed her senti
ment.
"Although we certainly feel it is le
gitimate and appropriate for students
and others to make their opinions
known through peaceful protest and
other means, the policy decisions are
driven by the University's commitment
to the principles of fairness and appre
ciation for the hard work of people who
contribute to the University's mission,"
he said.
Acosta added that no single organi
zation will broadly influence the Uni

versity's policy.
Despite the confident stance from
school officials, SLAC still argues the
policy does not have enough of an im
pact.
SLAC spokesman Matt Seriff-Cul
lick, a sophomore, said that he hoped
the public protests on May 11 would
bring awareness to the argument that
the University's living wage policy does
not do enough to help workers.
"It's hard to gauge any effect in the
first regard, but I think the rally itself,
the press coverage following it and the
series of teach-ins we're now conduct
ing are really starting to perk peoples'
ears to what, in my mind, is a pretty ac
cessible and clear-cut issue," he said.
"And since the rally, there's definitely a
sense of momentum that will carry us
through the end of the year and into
next year so that we can hit the ground
running."
Seriff-Cullick said the next step for
SLAC will be to develop teach-ins.
"We hope to get to as many dorms
and houses as possible for the end of
the year," he said. "The teach-ins in
volve a living wage workshop, which is
an interactive exercise that makes tan
gible, with specific numbers, the cuts
and sacrifices that have to be made
when you're not earning a living wage
â€” things like eliminating healthcare or
struggling to cut your food budget in
half. The second half goes over the ad
ministration's current living wage poli
cy and what needs to be changed for us
to have a real living wage on campus."
