## University restricts Row block party 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
Some ASSU campaign promises, such as
reviving the Halloween Mausoleum Party,
seem to never come to fruition. But outgoing
ASSU Executives Melanie Kannokada and
Aneto Okonkwo, both seniors, are making
good on their promise to throw a Row block
party, an ASSU-sponsored event to take place
Sunday night.
Plans for an all-day block party were scut
tled, however, as administration concerns lim
ited organizers to only an evening on The
Row. said Executive Cabinet Member Shirin
Sharif, a senior and a writer for The Daily who
has been in charge of the block party planning
for the better part of this school year.
"Our ideal plan was to have a daytime por
tion of the party from 12 to 3 p.m. and then a
nighttime portion from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m.,"
Sharif said. "Absolute Fun was going to spon
sor the daytime party, we submitted a whole
proposal to the Committee on Public Events
(COPE) and the administration rejected the
daytime part of the event."
"We were approached by members of the
ASSU with this idea of putting on a spring
block party," said Ralph Castro, the Stanford
party-planning educator. "It morphed into the
party it is now during discussions over the past few
months. Right now the Office of Student Activities
has approved the [nighttime] party and is working
with organizers to develop a security and crowd
management plan to ensure that it is a safe and suc
cessful event. With regards to [the daytime party's
cancellation], I'm not really sure what happened
with that."
According to Sharif, the afternoon party was not
approved by the administration due to traffic, noise
and crowd control concerns. Administrators recom
mended that the event be moved to Roble Field or
Frost Amphitheater. Event organizers, who insisted
on maintaining the event's block-party atmosphere,
rejected both alternative locations.
"The location was going to be the coolest part
about it," Sharif said.
The daytime block party was to extend over the
entire lower row residential area. Organizers were
planning on booking a $25,000 band — Ben Kweller
was discussed as an option — and providing free
food to thousands of anticipated participants.
Sharif told The Daily that prior to cancellation of
the daytime portion, Stanford Dining had signed on
to provide free food; Yahoo Music had pledged to
provide money for music and the entire lower row
community was committed to contributing funds
and manpower.
"[The Executive Cabinet] was really disappoint
ed in the way the administration handled the day
time portion," he said. "Ken Bates, the Police De
partment special events deputy, signed off on the
daytime event and the administration just sort of
backed out of it."
Nanci Howe, director of Student Affairs, and
Morris Graves, the Student Services manager — two
individuals named by party organizers as primary
proponents of the daytime cancellation — did not
return multiple calls and emails requesting com
ment.
The nighttime party, however, was approved by
the administration and will span three Row houses
— Columbae, Mars and Sigma Nu. According to
Castro, the organizers are expecting a total atten
dance of 500 students at any one time between the
three houses.
But with a higher number of attendees comes in
creased security concerns. Bates said.
"There have been a number of incidents that have
happened throughout the entire campus which
makes [the police department] want to increase our
presence on campus to help people think twice be
fore they do something that is illegal." he said.
Bates also told The Daily that security at the
block party would not be increased in light of the re
cent crimes on campus.
"It's going to be like the Big Game block party,
Sharif added. "There will be a central place giving
out wristbands for alcohol and checking SI'IDs.
Each house will feature a different flavor of
music. Mars and Sigma Nu will play house and pop
music and hip-hop respectively, while Columbae will
feature The Bee's Knees, a live band. The block party
is intended to be Stanford's last big hurrah before
dead week and finals.
"We sort of have a monopoly on parties that
night," Sharif said. "The parties are at three row
houses right next to each other in the center of cam
pus and people are done with midterms and every
thing until finals. We don't hope that getting people
there will be a problem."
