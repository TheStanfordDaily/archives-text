## EXPLORING HOLE-IN-THE-WALL 
### CAITLIN BERKA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ah, Palo Alto, land of decadent opulence, where
Niebaum-Coppola and Spago's rule. Where a night on
the town is likely to break the bank. Where you have
to make a six-figure salary just to get on the waitlist at
some restaurants. Rather than bemoan the fact that
we live within the bubbly confines of wealth and luxury, leave the
beaten path once in a while and revel in the glory of the run
down, the decrepit, the should-be-closed-for- public-health-rea
sons. Actually, there aren't many of those in Palo Alto, so this is a
very short list. And to protect the identity (and relative obscuri
ty) of one of my personal favorites, I have declined to list it here.
That, and my dining partner would probably return from Oxford
just to kill me in my sleep if I dared spread the word about this
place. But that's neither here nor there. Anyway...here are a few
to get you started. Remember, part of the joy of the hole-in-the
wall is discovering it yourself. So go out and start scavenging.
Homma's Sushi
This place defines hole-in-the-wall. It is literally in the back of a
dry cleaner's on California Avenue, with a faded wooden sign
outside as the only indication of its existence. The place smells
like a mixture of Simple Green and rancid fish, and there is a
lone Japanese man working behind the counter (who probably
hasn't moved from his spot since the Konin era). Woe is you if
anyone else arrives before you, because it will be at least half an
hour before you see your food. This man crafts his sushi with
meticulous care, with all the grace and precision of Michelange
lo or Vermeer. That, combined with the fact that he's about

120 years old and working all by his lonesome, makes
for incredibly slow service. The miso soup is
served nininc* hot fin Stvrnfnam mnO and the

servcu piping nui oiyroroam cups; ana in
place is decked out in a lovely design of
Formica and-linoleum and the scent of dry
cleaning chemicals occasionally wafts
through the open window — which looks
out over a back alley, replete with heaping
trash bags and horseflies. But such is the
hole-in-the-wall experience, and
Homma's Sushi is among the finest.

The El Paso Cafe

Located on El Camino in Mountain View,The El Paso is the
perfect place for transplanted Texans who long for a taste of
home. It's small, comfy, cozy and gives off just enough of that
raucous, down-home vibe to be considered an anachronism in

the Bay Area. The walls are crammed with beaten-up,
rusted license plates, bottle caps, road signs, snake
skins, antlers — you name it. Not that I'm an expert
or anything, but I'd wager that they have the best
chicken quesadillas this side of the border. When I
had my wisdom teeth removed a few years ago and
was relegated to a liquid diet for about a week —
and I kid you not here — I literally put one of their
sweet, sweet quesadillas in a blender and drank it
with a straw. It was actually disgusting. But the
point is, its addictive, and even a throbbing

mouth and Codeine-addled
brain can't keep you

from enjoying it.
