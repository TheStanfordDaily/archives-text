Though optimism is sometimes lack
ing when it comes to graduate stu
dent life, the play a crucial role in
the development of a sense of community.
They help maintain student-faculty rela
tions and more importantly, create oppor
tunities for fun after long days of staring at
a monitor in a dark and lifeless basement.
The Association of Sociology Graduate
Students (ASGS) is no exception.
The ASGS started out as an informal
group of grad students hut became the of
ficial voice for the Sociology Department's
doctoral student body in 2004. The group
publishes a quarterly newsletter called
"The Soap Dispenser," hosts welcome bar
beques and Christmas parties and actively
influences department-level policies.
"We only have seven to eight students
for each cohort," says Heili Pals, an active
contributor to the group and served as
last year's co-chair,"but there's a need for
a sense of community among us since
after first year, people don't see each

other in the same classes anymore."
Though law and business students
have their own socializing venues, but
most other grad departments do not.
"I have served as the Head Communi
ty Assistant in Escondido Village, but the
residence-oriented thing isn't for every
one," Pals says,"and the thing is that we
just don't see each other that much."
Fortunately, "The Soap Dispenser"
helps keep them in touch. The six- to
seven-page newsletter includes upcom
ing events, nuggets of wisdom from facul
ty and fellow grad students in the
"Bumper Stickers for Sociologists" sec
tion, photos and original eight-block
comic strips.
In addition to the newsletter and so
cial events such as interdepartmental
softball games, potlucks, barbeques and
bowling, ASGS has been effective in
shaping the decisions of the Sociology
Department. For example, in recent
years, a discretionary fund was created as
a result of a student proposal. The ASGS
has also successfully prevented over

crowding of grad student offices when
new faculty members were hired.
Every month or so, the ASGS invites a
distinguished sociologist as part of its
speaker series. The most recent speaker
was Steven Ruggles, a distinguished soci
ologist and history professor at the Uni
versity of Minnesota. But the speakers
don't always help students understand
the daily lives of sociologists.
"We're in the process of creating a
database of job search materials, infor
mation about fellowships, et cetera, just
for grad students in our department,"
Pals says."It helps those who are back
from the real world to adjust back into
the nuts and bolts of academia."
Besides the online resources, her fa
vorite aspect of the association is the
workshop series. It was launched two
years ago to invite alumni to give grads
career advice and to reflect on their
struggles and successes.
"Even though the PhD program
strongly encourages entering academia,
there are still some people who want to

see what's out there in the real world for
a PhD in sociology," Pals says.
Created by a group of dedicated soci
ology graduate students, the ASGS pro
vides a face for grad students in the Soci
ology Department, representing them to
other departments and acting as an offi
cial intermediary voice between the ad
ministration and students' interests.
According to the ASGS Web site,
there seems to be little involvement with
the co-term and undergrad population.
On the other hand, it's hard for under
grads to learn of the association's exis
tence, which provides insight into the life
of a graduate student. But perhaps it's
helpful for undergrads to hear stories of
determined grad students like Stefanie
Mollborn.one of the ASGS's officers last
year, who gave birth to two children and
is getting her PhD this year.
"I wish there could be a community
board on the newsletter," says Pals, who
spends most of her time working on her
dissertation and teaching. "I want to
know if someone just had a baby."
