## Editorial Late Nite: a triumph for student advocacy 
### 
At the start of this academic year, Stan
ford Dining made a commitment to
keeping Stern Late Nite open seven
days a week ("Stern Late Night serves on
weekends," Oct. 19,2(M)5). As the year draws
to a close, we applaud Stanford Dining for
keeping its promise and demonstrating its
commitment to student needs.
Throughout the year, Stanford Dining
has made many improvements to their serv
ices by increasing the flexibility of meal
plans and optimizing operating hours at all
dining locations on campus. We trust that it
will continue to work tirelessly to address
other student feedback — such as managing
the costs of student dining and providing
more flexible meal plans for upperclassmen.
But the extension of Late Nite's operating
hours also represents a triumph for student ad
vocacy Hie ASSIJ did a good job by communi
cating student interests to Stanford Dining. In
particular, we applaud the efforts of outgoing
President Melanie Kannokada,Vice President
Aneto Okonkwo and the Undergraduate Sen
ate for bringing this plan to fruition.
The fact that Late Nite stayed open on
weekends may not mean a lot. though many
students likely benefited from these extend
ed operating hours. The expansion of Late
Nite to seven days a week was more impor
tant because it marked a breakthrough in
student communication. We are impressed
with the way the team led by Kannokada
and Okonkwo managed to open up an effec
tive dialogue between the student body and
the University administration.
Traditionally, communication between
University administrators and students has
been patchy. The recent wrangling over the
location of this year's Commencement is a
case in point. Both parties must remember
that communication is a two-wav street. The

University needs to implement better meas
ures to collect and disseminate information
regarding student issues, but our student
government also needs to continue to repre
sent our views to the administration.
The Late Nite changes have helped build
a rudimentary framework for communica
tion between administrators and students.
Future ASSU executives and student lead
ers would do well to strengthen and capital
ize on this framework.
However, the progress should not end
here. The ASSU and Stanford Dining should
do more to follow up on student recommen
dations. Specifically, they should find out
whether Late Nite's extended services do in
deed benefit a wide range of students. How
many students really want Late Nite seven
days a week? How many people actually
used it this year? Was it justified to keep it
open on Saturday evenings, for example,
when many students would tend to dine off
campus? Would a reduction in operating
hours result in lower-cost meal plans?
We believe that Stanford Dining should
have access to numerical data to answer these
questions, and that the ASSU should make
these numbers public. This openness would
be a first step on the way to implementing a
system consolidating student views on a di
versity of matters. For instance, the ASSU
could implement a student survey to collect
the opinions of students across campus. Such
a service could be used for a wide range of
purposes — allowing student representatives
to decide on the most optimal opening hours
for Green Library, for instance.
The ASSU has learned much from its ex
perience with Stanford Dining. We hope that
our student representatives will institution
alize what they learned and use student ad
vocacy to greater effect in the future.
