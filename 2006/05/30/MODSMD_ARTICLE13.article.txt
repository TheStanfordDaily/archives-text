# The 						rhetoric of life
## 
### 
let me guess — when you decided to
sell your soul in order to fund your col
—>lege education, you assumed that, in
exchange for your sacrifice, you would final
ly get to choose your own classes and pave
your own path to the future.
Well, surprise! In order to prevent you
from being intimidated by that beast of a
publication that is the Course Bulletin, the
friendly folks here at Stanford have kindly
pre-selected a third of your freshman year
classes. Between 1-Hum and PWR. every
freshman at Stanford (with the exception of
the SLE kids, but we just won't mention
them) has the pleasure of banding together
and whining as one unified front. Some like
to complain about the futility of the course
content, others about the countless extra CS
classes that they could have taken this year if
not for the mandatory 19 units that they had
to dish out towards the humanities. Still oth
ers argue that time conflicts with other class
es are a good reason to banish I-Hum and
PWR forever.They seem to think that Econ
1 is more important for their future career in
business than "Myth and Modernity: Cul
ture in Germany."Those silly freshmen.
University administrators have plenty of
reasons to make these courses mandatory.
Yet no freshman whom I have met yet seems
to appreciate this "coordinated approach re
sponsive to how students mature as writers,
researchers and presenters during their un
dergraduate years." (Yes, that is a direct
quote from the fabulous wealth of knowl
edge that is the PWR website.)
Not convinced? Well, believe it or not, the
things you study in these classes actually do
come in handy every now and then. For in
stance, you can analyze anything in the style
of a PWR rhetorical analysis.Text messages,
Facebook wall posts, love letters, you name it
— if somebody wrote it, its fair game.
If you think about it. this is a good argu
ment for teaching PWR in middle school
rather than in college. Imagine how much
easier sixth grade love would have been if
you had understood the not-so-subtle
rhetorical devices that the cute boy in your
class used when he passed you notes at re
cess. It might have been the beginning of a
beautiful junior high relationship (i.e. you
would have spent a week sitting at the same
lunch table until you realized that his last
name didn't go well with your first name and

therefore you could never be together).
Even newspaper columnists are known to
use rhetoric to make a point every once in a
while. Notice how I used pathos to make you
reminisce about your middle school days in
the previous paragraph's detour about sweet,
innocent pre-teen love? Thanks to PWR. 1
can now put a label on my writing technique.
Oh. the things that you learn in school. But
aside from teaching me how to analyze the
punctuation in my friends' Facebook mes
sages (hey, there's a big difference between an
explanation point and a period). PWR has
taught me many an important lesson. Perhaps
the most important has been learning to navi
gate the labyrinths of Green Library — if you
ever need a good place for a romantic ren
dezvous, I can give you some tips. (Let me tell
you, you find a lot of interesting places when
you're wandering around aimlessly for hours,
trying to find your way out of the stacks before
midnight while attempting to avoid catching
the eye of the same person who just saw you
walk past two minutes ago as you headed to
wards what apparently was not the exit).
As I finish my freshman year and look back
on these and the many lessons I have learned
in I-Hum and PWR, I now realize that these
courses are vital to achieving "the University's
commitment to humanistic inquiry" (thanks, I-
Hum website) and that all freshmen should be
required to go through these Stanford rites of
passage, no matter how much they complain.
Ibey will have plenty of time after college to
make their own decisions. Until then, the mid
dle-aged businessmen can do all the work and
decide what is best for all these 18-year-olds.
That's why we're paying the big bucks.

Stephanie's I-Hum TF, Dr. Sarah Cervenak,
promised her an A this quarter if she men
tioned her name in her column. If you think
Stephanie should get an A in I-Hum, send an
email of support to salessi@stanford.edu, and
she will forward it to the powers that he.
