# Theory of flight
## 
### 
I am filled with a sudden ludicrous elation.
1 am going somewhere new to me, some
where ancient, a place I've thought about
forever but never really pictured going. 1 am
going to the Islands at last; Mykonos, two
hours from Athens, the edge of the world. I'll
be flying on Easy Jet — that goofy down
home British sky stallion, that Southwest-by
way-of-London Airlines, which, like pleas
ure-palace England itself, feels Euro-foreign
and globalization-familiar with bright-or
ange wings etched against the sky like your
favorite PlayMobil Airplane.
There will be time for worry later — not
just the minute details of traveling abroad,
the frequent unzipping of your outside pock
et to make sure your passport is still there,
and the double-check of that hostel email, to
make sure you booked the right Wednesday
in the right city. No, even the larger worries
— the summer housing you need to figure
out yesterday, the ex you used to love that
you don't even want to think about, the real
ity of age encroaching with senior year, the
life to be figured out — are merely dust in
the solar wind when the plane climbs above
the clouds, twisting South towards the
Mediterranean and eternal beaches (or East
ward towards the old Soviet Union, or be
yond to Asia; or North, to the Baltic; or what
the hell, maybe West, back home).
Home. When I finally take that turn West
near summer's end, returning in time for a 9/11
wedding (has it been five years?) and three
weeks of cultural decompression, I'll have
been away eight months. That's my longest
stint away from home — Stanford doesn't
count as away from home, not when my par
ents wave to me at basketball games and I shop
at the same Target where 1 bought Ninja Hir
tles action figures as a six-year-old. The only
thing that compares is last summer in LA, and
then home was just a six hour shitty drive
through wasteland Mid-Cal away. Now I'm as
far from home as possible — and when I think
of end of it all, I'll always be on a tiny freshly
sanded beach in the middle of the island, two
hillsides jutting on either side of a windswept
inlet. It looks like "Lord of the Rings," one of
those swooping helicopter shots carrying you
over fairy tale mountains, like a moving reality
postcard — some sort of geographic porn.
What is this ageless island beauty? Sea
side air tasting of fresh spring flowers and
suntan lotion on suntanned bodies; stupid
American girls with salmon-red skin sipping
vodkatinis; Eurotrashy femmes fatale with
space age-chic sunglasses and deep-hued
browned skin that demands your attention
and begs for a nudist beach; too many men in

too-skimpy Speedos; and bullshit jewelry
and bullshit Athens Olympics 2(M)4 sports
wear that wasn't popular then and is over
priced in the bargain bin now. And the sound,
from all sides,of bright-colored scooters, Ves
pas that recall Miami Beach (or Vice City),
the chugging engine burr carving across the
essential Mediterranean silence — that
sound of a million waves breaking in every
direction against a million others. Scooters
are fucking sweet. The other guys got the big
badass red ones, but by the time my turn
came up the only one the buxom Greek red
head had left was a blue one, girly-sized and
colored like Nathan Lane's mini-cooper. But
it turned on a dime and went great with my
shirt. Plus, when you're racing at 30 km/hr
along a deserted coastal freeway (no helmet
— she ran out. and anyway safety's for girly
men) you feel like you're flying.
Which reminds me — halfway to the
southeast Mykonos coast, we stop by a tiny
restaurant-inn on the beach, empty except
for the gregarious old inkeeper/maitr'd who,
like all Greeks, always seems to be platoni
cally flirting with everyone (when we played
volleyball with some local kids, a 12-year-old
named Mario with Harry Osborn hair put his
arm around Daisy and demanded she play
for his team, earning himself a bid for the
2012 Kappa Sigma pledge class).
The old guy, who also worked as a chef,en
couraged us to get the four-person platter,
with spiced skewered slabs of fresh cooked
(probably fresh-slain) pork, chicken and
steak. (God, the food in this country! Cala
mari fresh-caught on the trawls docked fifty
feet from the restaurant, fried and flavored
fine enough for Poseidon himself. Not to
mention the skewered souvlaki, the pasta
stacked pastitso and the irrepressible quick
bite delicacy of true-bred gyro).
"Would you rather," I ask, as we're munch
ing on the bread, "be invisible, or be able to
fly?" It's an old question, much-favored by
psych wags for an easy introvert/extrovert
comparison. But it's a good one. Because think
of the crazy espionage voyeuristic antics you
could pull if no one could see you. You could
rob anyone. You could make millions on

celebrity sex tapes. You could pull Bush's pants
down during a speech (or Clinton's, I ain't po
litical, you neoconservative sodomites). You
could use your powers for good and solve mys
teries. In this modern world, where informa
tion is everything, you'd hold all the cards.
But screw that. For one second in the air.
curling against the wind... it's the one childish
yearning we never lose next to the Oedipal
complex — the one thing movies can never
quite get right remember Matrix Reloaded?
Above gravity, above all life's pointless ba
nality— don't things look much prettier
from the airplane window?
That's what Greece feels like — every
thing far away at the horizon of infinite possi
bility, baking under Apollo's sun that rose
over Troy and Plato and the last scene in
"Bourne Identity," which was shot in
Mykonos. There's always another island, or
another corner of the island. We never made it
to the Lighthouse, thanks to poor road condi
tions and our oncoming ferry. Somewhere,
Virginia Woolf is nodding existential approval
(or cackling, that arrogant literary hussy).
And that's how Europe feels, too. Hie re's
always somewhere else, just a quick Eurail trip
or Easy Jet flight away. Someplace famous: chic
like Paris or swinging like London or German
like Berlin. Or someplace beautiful: like Vien
na, where Ethan Hawke wooed Julie Delpy in
"Before Sunrise," my Bible. Someplace weird:
like Bulgaria, which has Russia's low prices
and rampant corruption (and, soon, an EU
membership). Someplace perfect: like Ams
terdam, which is everything anyone could
want from anywhere, and there's a Hooker
Union, too. Or just some place like Moscow.
It's the sense of reality, the kiosks selling
liquor and cigarettes on every corner, the
people who speak three languages well, the
newspapers that demand answers and results,
the men who walk with a limp because the So
viets were shit with medicine, the exotic teas
ing smell of suntan lotion on a girl's bared legs
after a cold hard European winter, the ceme
teries older than Columbus, the columns
older than Christ. Ageless, enduring. Ah, Eu
ropa — your economy in the dumps, your
Union in shambles, your immigrants angry,
your citizens confused, the world spinning
madly out of control all around your ears.
I still love you, baby.
