Article on Med School diversity
was irresponsible
We appreciate the importance of
student journalism. We also value re
sponsible critiques of our progress
and efforts as we attempt to address
the challenging and important issues
of equity and career development in
academic medicine. Indeed, we have
worked diligently during the past sev
eral years to address historical in

equities and to make Stanford School
of Medicine a leader in academic ca
reer development that values all
forms of diversity. Thus, as the senior
leaders for diversity, academic affairs
and dean of the School of Medicine,
we are compelled to voice our deep
est concerns regarding the content of
your article ("Med School Faculty
Claim Systematic Discrimination,"
May 25). The portrait offered by Ben
Eppler is highly distorted. The article

confuses issues of the past with the
facts of the present and fails to offer
any context or verification for the ex
traordinarily biased and derogatory
claims put forth by the writer and his
anonymous sources.
Sadly, this striking example of irre
sponsible journalism occurred in part
because the writer chose to ignore
pertinent information provided to
him. Eppler chose instead to write an
article based on unfounded allega

tions and insinuations, lacking in
facts, riddled with innuendo and
grossly inaccurate. Most importantly,
his comments about women or mi
nority faculty members in leadership
positions constitute a direct attack on
their competency, and they denigrate
the many contributions these individ
uals have made in ensuring that Stan
ford has among the most diversified
student bodies in the nation as well as
a highly respectful workplace for fac

ulty, students and staff. We cannot
even speculate why the author chose
to ignore important facts or to offer
(as if they were facts) insinuations
about the role of the federal govern
ment in suppressing an investigation
â€” a notion that is totally ludicrous
and categorically false.
The significant accomplishments
that have occurred in the past several
years to improve diversity and lead
ership by women and minorities in

the School of Medicine have includ
ed revisions of the search process; ed
ucation of search committees around
issues of unconscious bias; and provi
sion of resources to broaden the di
versity of applicant pools. In addition,
we have created major opportunities
for leadership development of stu
dents and faculty and have, for the
past five years, had a focused effort
