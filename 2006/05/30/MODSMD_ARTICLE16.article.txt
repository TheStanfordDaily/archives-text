Article on Med School diversity
was irresponsible
We appreciate the importance of
student journalism. We also value re
sponsible critiques of our progress
and efforts as we attempt to address
the challenging and important issues
of equity and career development in
academic medicine. Indeed, we have
worked diligently during the past sev
eral years to address historical in

equities and to make Stanford School
of Medicine a leader in academic ca
reer development that values all
forms of diversity. Thus, as the senior
leaders for diversity, academic affairs
and dean of the School of Medicine,
we are compelled to voice our deep
est concerns regarding the content of
your article ("Med School Faculty
Claim Systematic Discrimination,"
May 25). The portrait offered by Ben
Eppler is highly distorted. The article

confuses issues of the past with the
facts of the present and fails to offer
any context or verification for the ex
traordinarily biased and derogatory
claims put forth by the writer and his
anonymous sources.
Sadly, this striking example of irre
sponsible journalism occurred in part
because the writer chose to ignore
pertinent information provided to
him. Eppler chose instead to write an
article based on unfounded allega

tions and insinuations, lacking in
facts, riddled with innuendo and
grossly inaccurate. Most importantly,
his comments about women or mi
nority faculty members in leadership
positions constitute a direct attack on
their competency, and they denigrate
the many contributions these individ
uals have made in ensuring that Stan
ford has among the most diversified
student bodies in the nation as well as
a highly respectful workplace for fac

ulty, students and staff. We cannot
even speculate why the author chose
to ignore important facts or to offer
(as if they were facts) insinuations
about the role of the federal govern
ment in suppressing an investigation
— a notion that is totally ludicrous
and categorically false.
The significant accomplishments
that have occurred in the past several
years to improve diversity and lead
ership by women and minorities in

the School of Medicine have includ
ed revisions of the search process; ed
ucation of search committees around
issues of unconscious bias; and provi
sion of resources to broaden the di
versity of applicant pools. In addition,
we have created major opportunities
for leadership development of stu
dents and faculty and have, for the
past five years, had a focused effort
on the "respectful workplace" that
has been a model for the university.
We clearly recognize that we
have work to do to achieve the level
of diversity and balance we seek for
the School of Medicine. We are
proud that we have advanced this
process in a multitude of ways with
the highest degree of integrity, open
ness and transparency Quite frankly,
that is what makes this article so dis
tressing. In its distortions and dearth
of factual content, it is highly disre
spectful of both the individuals and
the institutions that are working dili
gently to improve personal and pro
fessional development.

Stanford remains committed
to diversity
Given that Stanford University
has become one of the leaders
among its peer institutions in its
efforts to diversify its faculty and in
creating a supportive atmosphere for
women and minority faculty mem
bers, it was upsetting to read the
poorly researched article titled "Med
School Faculty Claim Systematic
Discrimination" (May 25, 2006).
Particularly distressing is the fact
that the reporter was provided with
information that ran counter to the
claim, but decided not to include that
information in the article.
The faculty leadership at the
Medical School has played an inte
gral and highly supportive role in
Stanford's diversity efforts. As with
the rest of the University, the
Medical School follows a rigorous
process for outreach and affirmative
action when conducting faculty
searches. The mandated search
process is waived only when the
school is presented with an opportu
nity to get a uniquely qualified indi
vidual-as was the case with the
recent appointment of an African
American professor in one of the
school's departments — and such
waivers require explicit, advanced
approval by the provost. The School
of Medicine also has a rigorous
review process for reappointment
and promotion decisions, as well as
for affirmative action efforts and
compensation decisions to ensure
fairness, and these processes are
also subject to careful scrutiny by
the Provost's Office.
At the Medical School, as in the
University as a whole, the percent
age of women faculty shows a
steady increase. In the last 10 years.

the representation of women in the
School of Medicine has increased
from 20 percent to 26 percent, and
minority faculty members have
increased from 14 percent to 20 per
cent. Among this year's newly hired
School of Medicine faculty, 31 per
cent are women, and 42 percent are
faculty of color. Women and faculty
of color are also filling key leader
ship positions in the school. Indeed,
in recent years there have been
more female department chairs at
the School of Medicine than at any
other major medical school in the
country.
Dean Philip Pizzo's administration
at the Medical School has received
nationwide recognition for taking
innovative measures to create a sup
portive climate for women and
minority faculty, such as requiring
Respectful Workplace training ses
sions for all faculty and creating the
high-level administrative position of
Senior Associate Dean for Diversity
and Leadership to focus specifically
on these issues (someone the reporter
never spoke to while "researching"
his story). Vice Dean David
Stevenson is likewise known through
out the Medical Center for his active
support and mentoring of women and
minority faculty.
The article relied on unidentified
sources (with unknowable biases),
untested assertions, speculation and
past history to paint a highly distort
ed picture of the climate for women
and minority faculty at the Stanford
Medical School. The article ignored
information provided to the Daily
that was contrary to its hypothesis
of systematic discrimination and
retaliation. For example, the article
put forth rank speculation by
unnamed sources of a Bush admin
istration conspiracy causing delay in
the Department of Labor investiga
tion. but did not mention informa
tion the Daily received that in the
first wave of the investigation, there
was no discrimination or retaliation
discovered and that in the follow-on
investigation currently underway,
again no evidence has been found of
systemic discrimination and retalia
tion. Indeed the only determination
made so far in the Department of
Labor investigation was that a claim
of retaliation was unfounded. In
taking such a one-sided slant, the
article unfairly and irresponsibly
maligned the efforts, accomplish
ments and leadership of the School
of Medicine, and fell far below the
journalistic standards that the
Stanford community should expect
of its student newspaper.
This is not to sav that the Medical

School and University cannot do
better with respect to faculty diversi
ty, and we recognize that much work
remains to he done, both here and
nationwide. Stanford University and
the School of Medicine are commit
ted to leading the efforts to enhance
faculty diversity and to provide an
environment in which all faculty can
thrive.

Provost
Editor's Mote: While The Daily
respects the right and responsibility
of the University to respond to the
issues raised, the editorial staff
stands by the article in question and
the credibility of the anonymous
sources quoted and referenced.
Kudos to the Music
Department
Although thank you letters do
not often appear in the Daily, we are
about to leave Stanford and would
like to thank the Music Department
for the considerable pleasure it has
given us through the hundreds of
concerts we've attended over the
past 12 years.
It is remarkable how one depart
ment can offer such a varied series
of high-quality concerts during each
school year. We commend them for
offering many of them free and the
rest at affordable cost.
Music Department faculty and
students who share their talents
offer Stanford and the community a
real gift. We thank not only the
musicians but all Music Department
staff who work to make these fre
quent concerts happen.

Faculty must be hired and
promoted for their accomplish
ments, not their appearance
With all due respect to Niraj
Sheth's article ("Dearth of diversity
in natural science faculty," May 26),
it is essential that Stanford continue
to hire and promote faculty because
of their accomplishments in both
teaching and research, not on the
basis of their "appearance." It is the
intellectual quality of the individual
that must take priority. If we do oth
erwise. after a period of time, excel
lent students would apply elsewhere
as the quality of this institution
would have declined.

in recent years there have been
more female department chairs at
the School of Medicine than at any
other major medical school in the
country.
Dean Philip Pizzo's administration
at the Medical School has received
nationwide recognition for taking
innovative measures to create a sup
portive climate for women and
minority faculty, such as requiring
Respectful Workplace training ses
sions for all faculty and creating the
high-level administrative position of
Senior Associate Dean for Diversity
and Leadership to focus specifically
on these issues (someone the reporter
never spoke to while "researching"
his story). Vice Dean David
Stevenson is likewise known through
out the Medical Center for his active
support and mentoring of women and
minority faculty.
The article relied on unidentified
sources (with unknowable biases),
untested assertions, speculation and
past history to paint a highly distort
ed picture of the climate for women
and minority faculty at the Stanford
Medical School. The article ignored
information provided to the Daily
that was contrary to its hypothesis
of systematic discrimination and
retaliation. For example, the article
put forth rank speculation by
unnamed sources of a Bush admin
istration conspiracy causing delay in
the Department of Labor investiga
tion. but did not mention informa
tion the Daily received that in the
first wave of the investigation, there
was no discrimination or retaliation
discovered and that in the follow-on
investigation currently underway,
again no evidence has been found of
systemic discrimination and retalia
tion. Indeed the only determination
made so far in the Department of
Labor investigation was that a claim
of retaliation was unfounded. In
taking such a one-sided slant, the
article unfairly and irresponsibly
maligned the efforts, accomplish
ments and leadership of the School
of Medicine, and fell far below the
journalistic standards that the
Stanford community should expect
of its student newspaper.
This is not to sav that the Medical

School and University cannot do
better with respect to faculty diversi
ty, and we recognize that much work
remains to he done, both here and
nationwide. Stanford University and
the School of Medicine are commit
ted to leading the efforts to enhance
faculty diversity and to provide an
environment in which all faculty can
thrive.

Kudos to the Music

Although thank you letters do
not often appear in the Daily, we are
about to leave Stanford and would
like to thank the Music Department
for the considerable pleasure it has
given us through the hundreds of
concerts we've attended over the
past 12 years.
It is remarkable how one depart
ment can offer such a varied series
of high-quality concerts during each
school year. We commend them for
offering many of them free and the
rest at affordable cost.
Music Department faculty and
students who share their talents
offer Stanford and the community a
real gift. We thank not only the
musicians but all Music Department
staff who work to make these fre
quent concerts happen.

Faculty must be hired and
promoted for their accomplish
ments, not their appearance
With all due respect to Niraj
Sheth's article ("Dearth of diversity
in natural science faculty," May 26),
it is essential that Stanford continue
to hire and promote faculty because
of their accomplishments in both
teaching and research, not on the
basis of their "appearance." It is the
intellectual quality of the individual
that must take priority. If we do oth
erwise. after a period of time, excel
lent students would apply elsewhere
as the quality of this institution
would have declined.

Article on Med School diversity
was irresponsible
We appreciate the importance of
student journalism. We also value re
sponsible critiques of our progress
and efforts as we attempt to address
the challenging and important issues
of equity and career development in
academic medicine. Indeed, we have
worked diligently during the past sev
eral years to address historical in

equities and to make Stanford School
of Medicine a leader in academic ca
reer development that values all
forms of diversity. Thus, as the senior
leaders for diversity, academic affairs
and dean of the School of Medicine,
we are compelled to voice our deep
est concerns regarding the content of
your article ("Med School Faculty
Claim Systematic Discrimination,"
May 25). The portrait offered by Ben
Eppler is highly distorted. The article

confuses issues of the past with the
facts of the present and fails to offer
any context or verification for the ex
traordinarily biased and derogatory
claims put forth by the writer and his
anonymous sources.
Sadly, this striking example of irre
sponsible journalism occurred in part
because the writer chose to ignore
pertinent information provided to
him. Eppler chose instead to write an
article based on unfounded allega

tions and insinuations, lacking in
facts, riddled with innuendo and
grossly inaccurate. Most importantly,
his comments about women or mi
nority faculty members in leadership
positions constitute a direct attack on
their competency, and they denigrate
the many contributions these individ
uals have made in ensuring that Stan
ford has among the most diversified
student bodies in the nation as well as
a highly respectful workplace for fac

ulty, students and staff. We cannot
even speculate why the author chose
to ignore important facts or to offer
(as if they were facts) insinuations
about the role of the federal govern
ment in suppressing an investigation
— a notion that is totally ludicrous
and categorically false.
The significant accomplishments
that have occurred in the past several
years to improve diversity and lead
ership by women and minorities in

the School of Medicine have includ
ed revisions of the search process; ed
ucation of search committees around
issues of unconscious bias; and provi
sion of resources to broaden the di
versity of applicant pools. In addition,
we have created major opportunities
for leadership development of stu
dents and faculty and have, for the
past five years, had a focused effort
on the "respectful workplace" that
has been a model for the university.
We clearly recognize that we
have work to do to achieve the level
of diversity and balance we seek for
the School of Medicine. We are
proud that we have advanced this
process in a multitude of ways with
the highest degree of integrity, open
ness and transparency Quite frankly,
that is what makes this article so dis
tressing. In its distortions and dearth
of factual content, it is highly disre
spectful of both the individuals and
the institutions that are working dili
gently to improve personal and pro
fessional development.

Stanford remains committed
to diversity
Given that Stanford University
has become one of the leaders
among its peer institutions in its
efforts to diversify its faculty and in
creating a supportive atmosphere for
women and minority faculty mem
bers, it was upsetting to read the
poorly researched article titled "Med
School Faculty Claim Systematic
Discrimination" (May 25, 2006).
Particularly distressing is the fact
that the reporter was provided with
information that ran counter to the
claim, but decided not to include that
information in the article.
The faculty leadership at the
Medical School has played an inte
gral and highly supportive role in
Stanford's diversity efforts. As with
the rest of the University, the
Medical School follows a rigorous
process for outreach and affirmative
action when conducting faculty
searches. The mandated search
process is waived only when the
school is presented with an opportu
nity to get a uniquely qualified indi
vidual-as was the case with the
recent appointment of an African
American professor in one of the
school's departments — and such
waivers require explicit, advanced
approval by the provost. The School
of Medicine also has a rigorous
review process for reappointment
and promotion decisions, as well as
for affirmative action efforts and
compensation decisions to ensure
fairness, and these processes are
also subject to careful scrutiny by
the Provost's Office.
At the Medical School, as in the
University as a whole, the percent
age of women faculty shows a
steady increase. In the last 10 years.

the representation of women in the
School of Medicine has increased
from 20 percent to 26 percent, and
minority faculty members have
increased from 14 percent to 20 per
cent. Among this year's newly hired
School of Medicine faculty, 31 per
cent are women, and 42 percent are
faculty of color. Women and faculty
of color are also filling key leader
ship positions in the school. Indeed,
in recent years there have been
more female department chairs at
the School of Medicine than at any
other major medical school in the
country.
