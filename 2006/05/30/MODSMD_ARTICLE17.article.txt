## Students fundraise for Indonesia disaster 
### DENISE SOHN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Skip a Starbucks, Save an Or
phan." With this as their slogan, the
Indonesian Club at Stanford (ICS)
and the Muslim Students Aware
ness Network (MSAN) have
teamed up to raise money to sup
port the Give Light Foundation,
which, according to its Web site, is a
"world recognized crisis relief or
ganization that seeks to create
durable orphanages in response to
natural disasters."
Organizers said the Foundation
originated as a response to the
tsunamis that struck Southeast Asia
Dec. 26,2(X)4, killing teas of thousands.
"The founder, Dian Alyan, start
ed it soon after the 2004 tsunamis hit
in Southeast Asia," said MSAN
member Nabill Idrisi, a freshman.
Alyan is "a native of Indonesia
who lost 40 of her relatives in the 2004
tsunami," ICS Co-president Evelyn
Mintamo, a coterminal student in
electrical engineering, explained.
TheGiveLight foundation was estab
lished in January 2005 in Sunnyvale, Calif
"The first orphanage opened in
Aceh, Indonesia," Idrisi said. "The
orphanage provides basic needs to
the children, including food, shel
ter, and clothing."
"In addition to the orphanage in
Indonesia, Ms. Alyan has broken
ground on a second orphanage in
Pakistan to help the victims of last
year's earthquake," Mintamo said.
She added that she hoped
fundraising efforts would also go
toward relief for the earthquake
that hit Indonesia on Sunday,
killing more than 3,500 people.The
quake was the worst natural disas
ter to occur in the region since the
2004 tsunami left more than 30,000
children orphaned.
Stanford students became in
volved with the Foundation's efforts
about a month ago when Alyan
came to campus to speak about

Give Light and how students could
help. AJyan highlighted the Founda
tion's emphasis on education and
how its goals were fundamentally
aligned with those of the University.
"Give Light sends children to
local public schools, but also offers
complimentary education that in
cludes computer skills, English,
Arabic and Islamic studies,"
Mintarno explained. "Establishing
this educational basis for the or
phans ensures that these future
leaders will understand the impor
tance of higher learning."
Idrisi said he was "powerfully
impacted by the work that [Alyan]
has done and the extent to which
her work has improved the lives of
so many children."
The fundraiser, which began
last Monday, will end on Wednes
day. So far, this effort has raised
more than $ 1,000 of its $2,(XX) goal.
Mintarno said that the Founda
tion's goal is to "inform people about
the devastation in Indonesia, the
possibility for rehabilitation and how
much just three dollars can help."
"Just $3 can provide nine hot
meals, three days of shelter and
complimentary English and com
puter lessons," she said.
To spread awareness, students
have been tabling in White Plaza,
advertising in The Daily and
through a Facebook group and flier
and collecting donations online
through a Pay Pal account
(http://tinyurl.com/lwppf). Students
have also been going to various
dorms to attend house meetings
and raise donations door-to-door.
The fundraiser will culminate with
a reception this Wednesday at 7 p.m.
in Room 2(XM)2 of the History Cor
ner. The event will include a movie
screening and a speech by Alyan, who
will share her experiences.Tickets are
$3, and dessert will be served.
"Three dollars feeds an orphan
for three days, so any amount is
greatly appreciated," Idrisi said.
