## WOMEN FALL IN SUPER REGIONAL Softball squad loses in extra innings to Alabama 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
A seven-run deficit in the first inning is not
the right way to start off a softball game.
While No. 7 Stanford managed to fight
back and tie the score in the second game of its
series with No. 5 Alabama, the Cardinal ulti
mately lost the Saturday game and the series
in this weekends NCAA Super Regional.
The Crimson Tide had put seven runs on
the board by the time the 12th-seeded Cardi
nal (42-18) took their first at-bat. Stanford bat
ters responded by quickly scoring three of
their own in the first inning to tie the game in
the fourth. Despite the unlikely comeback, Al
abama (54-9) eventually took the 8-7 extra-in
nings win on Saturday. Having already posted
a 4-1 victory Friday, Alabama advanced to the
Women's College World Series with the win.
"Any time you lose the last game of the sea
son, it's difficult," Stanford Coach John
Rittman said. "I felt like the effort was there
but our execution was not the best. Honestly, 1
think we just ran out of time. We rallied back
from a big deficit and just fell short. It's tough,
but I was proud of the way we fought."
Stanford's sophomore starter Becky Mc-
Cullough struggled to find the strike zone
against the top of Alabama's order, walking
three of the first four batters at the plate.
After a two-RBI double put Alabama's
first runs on the board, freshman Missy Penna
took over in the circle and immediately
walked in another run. A second two-RBI
double and a two-RBI single gave the Tide the
7-0 advantage.
With its season on the line, the Stanford
squad did not give up and answered with its
own three-run first inning. The Tide made
three costly mistakes — a wild pitch, a fielding
error and an overthrow at the plate — that al

lowed senior Catalina Morris to score. Penna
brought home senior Lauren Lappin with a
single, and freshman Maddy Coon scored on
another wild pitch to close the gap to 7-3.
The Cardinal struck again in the fourth in
ning, tying the game with a four-run rally. With
the bases loaded,sophomore Anna Beardman
reached base on an error, which brought two
runs across the plate. Lappin hit a single to the
shortstop for two RBI and the score was knot
ted at seven.
"It was just never giving up, never quit

ting," Rittman said of the comeback. "We have
such good leadership from the seniors and up
perclassmen who have been there before —
they know that we are capable of scoring
seven, eight, nine runs in a game. When you
give up that many runs early, there is a lot of
ballgame left to play. And we took that ap
proach — that we still had seven innings to
play and we just needed to chip away and get
back in it."
The 7-7 tie lasted through the seventh,
pushing the game into extra innings. But in the

eighth. Alabama's Mandy Burford reached
base on an error and stole second and third be
fore coming home on an RBI single. Down by
a run.the Cardinal hit into a double play to
end the eighth inning and the game.
The win was Alabama's second of the series
following a 4-1 victory over the Cardinal on
Friday.Tlie sweep eliminated the Cardinal and
advanced Alabama to the WCWS.
On Friday, Alabama scored a run in the sec
ond inning and two in the third before the Car
dinal broke through in the sixth with Penna's
RBI single. The Cardinal would not score
again and the Tide notched an insurance run in
the bottom of the sixth for the final margin.
Junior Jackie Rinehart had a stellar day at
the plate for Stanford by going 3-for-3. But the
rest of the team could only muster three more
hits.
"We dealt with some adversity this year,"
Rittman said. "When you have injuries to two
of your pitchers — Penna's smashed thumb
and McCullough's arm — it can be very hard.

Junior left fielder Jackie Rinehart notched three hits in Friday's game against No. 5 Alabama. The
Crimson Tide defeated the No. 7 Cardinal 4-1 in that game.
But we battled through that. For a
team to win 42 games when you play
the schedule that we played, that is a
successful season."
Stanford returns next year with

out its five current seniors, including
Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year
Lappin. But the Cardinal will have
an experienced squad of rising jun
iors and seniors who are ready to
step into leadership positions.
"Each year is a new year, and this
year's team was special and unique
in many ways," Rittman said. "Next
year, the team must develop its own
identity. We will need new leaders

but we already have them in our pro
gram."
Alabama is scheduled to now
face No. 4 Northwestern in the first
round of the WCWS. There were no
significant upsets in this year's
bracket and the eight teams going to
Oklahoma are the tournament's top
eight seeds. Four of those teams, in
cluding top-ranked UCLA, are from
the Pac-10.
