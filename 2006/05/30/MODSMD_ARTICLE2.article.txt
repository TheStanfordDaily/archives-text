# Admit yield increases by 2 percent
## Dean of Admission points to lowest ever acceptance rate, one of the highest yield rates, for Class of 2010 
### SHIRIN SHARIF SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Though still a long way from Harvard's 80 percent,
Stanford's yield rate increased to a respectable 69 per
cent this year, up from 67 percent last year, according to
Richard Shaw, dean of admission and financial aid. The
number increased to approximately 88 percent for stu
dents who attended Admit Weekend or applied under
the single-choice early action program.
The yield rate is the percentage of Stanford's 2,430
admits that chose to join the University's Class of 2010.
The admission rate this year was the lowest ever, with
less than eleven percent of applicants admitted. The
yield rate is also among Stanford's highest, surpassing
Shaw's expected 68 percent.
Shaw characterized this year's yield rate as "very
high and probably among the top five yields in the coun
try for selective private universities." Yale's yield rate is
expected to be 73 percent, while Princeton's is 69 per
cent.
TWo years ago, the Office of Undergraduate Admis
sion released statistics showing that 28 percent of stu
dents that declined Stanford chose Harvard instead, fol
lowed by 20 percent choosing Yale, 13 percent choosing
MIT and 8 percent choosing Princeton; 31 percent of
students chose other schools. Similar statistics for the
Class of 2010 are not yet available, Shaw said.
With about one-third of Stanford acceptees declin
ing their admission offers, these numbers beg the ques
tion: Why would students reject the sunny, happy, well
rounded institution? At a Faculty Senate meeting last
month, Shaw said that the two primary reasons students

did not attend Stanford after being ac
cepted were financial cost and geo
graphic location.
Stanford's new financial aid policy
is aimed at reducing the first con
straint on students' decisions. The
University is eliminating parental
contributions for families with total
annual incomes of less than $45,000
and reducing parental contributions
from families with total incomes be
tween $45,000 and $60,0(X).
The second complaint, concerning
the location of the University, will
likely be harder to solve. In the post
admissions survey given to admits last
year, non-enrolling admits wrote that
they viewed Stanford as an environ
ment as selective, challenging, intel
lectual, fun and impersonal — a wide
range of perspectives on location.
At the Faculty Senate meeting,
Shaw spoke about his plans to in
crease marketing to augment Stan
ford's appeal across the country. He

proposed using national and interna
tional Alumni Association groups to
conduct interviews and outreach
around the globe and to increase re
cruitment travel tenfold by joining the
"Exploring College Options" consor
tium with Duke, Georgetown, Har
vard and Penn, which travels to 300
cities in the fall of 2006 and spring of
2007.
At the meeting. Economics Prof.
Roger Noll, an elected member of the
Faculty Senate, raised a point about
the inconsistency between the rea
sons why students are not choosing
Stanford after being admitted and
Shaw's plans for improving the
process through more global out
reach.
"We might have better yield if we
increased the financial aid budget by
the proposed increase in the market
ing budget," Noll wrote in an email to
The Daily. "The issue is whether we
should deal with a relatively low ac

ceptance rate from [the South and
East) by trying to increase applica
tions (a low acceptance rate times a
greater number of applicants) or by
trying to raise the acceptance rate by
offering more financial aid."
At the meeting, Noll asked Shaw
why spending an extra $100,000
would be more productively spent on
marketing than on giving 100 students
$1,000 more in financial aid, especial
ly given budget constraints that could
preclude spending money on both op
tions.
"What I'm trying to accomplish is
to bring a very diverse perspective
from across the nation to Stanford,"
Shaw responded. "I'm not interested
in receiving more applications. I'm in
terested in reaching out to kids that
really are not on our wavelengths.
Quite frankly, the schools we compete
with do it ten times as much as we do
it. In other words, the representation
in their student bodies is much broad

er and deeper."
While Shaw's proposals may or
may not increase Stanford's yield
rate, it is still important to understand
why students might go elsewhere. On

Jason Wong, a high school senior from
San Francisco, chose Harvard over
Stanford, even though Stanford of
fered him $100,000 more in financial
aid than Harvard over four years.
"In terms of recruitment, I appre
ciated Stanford's packet over Har
vard's because it was more celebrato
ry and recognized the work of every
admitted student; Harvard's was
more imposing." Wong said. "Stan
ford offered me a way better financial
aid package, which 1 had the hardest
time letting go.
"But 1 guess Harvard's location,
history,and different location won me
over," he reflected. "1 really want to
experience the Hast Coast,for at least
four years of my life. 1 also wanted to
be in the Boston area, where I could
potentially tap the resources and
meet other students at other top col
leges and universities in the area. I

wanted something different, and I

In trying to increase its yield rate,
one initiative that the Stanford Ad
mission Office instituted this year and
will expand next year is the Likely
Admit Program, which reaches out to
the "most extraordinary" students
early, before the regular review mail

ter in January and follow-up calls
from Stanford faculty.This year, there
were 61 "Super-star Academic Like
lies" and 60 "Multicultural Likelies."
These 121 students were expected
to be admitted to every competitive
institution in the country. Stanford
tried to connect with them early to
convince them of the University's ap
peal as their best prospect. Shaw said
that he was still analyzing the yield
rates for these students.but the results
"looked good."
In terms of how to increase overall
yield rates, Shaw said he wants to
"make sure students know as much
as possible about this place when
making the decision. We want their
decision to be based on the facts of
the place and we attempt to make

try for selective private universities." Yale's yield rate is
expected to be 73 percent, while Princeton's is 69 per
cent.
TWo years ago, the Office of Undergraduate Admis
sion released statistics showing that 28 percent of stu
dents that declined Stanford chose Harvard instead, fol
lowed by 20 percent choosing Yale, 13 percent choosing
MIT and 8 percent choosing Princeton; 31 percent of
students chose other schools. Similar statistics for the
Class of 2010 are not yet available, Shaw said.
With about one-third of Stanford acceptees declin
ing their admission offers, these numbers beg the ques
tion: Why would students reject the sunny, happy, well
rounded institution? At a Faculty Senate meeting last
month, Shaw said that the two primary reasons students

did not attend Stanford after being ac
cepted were financial cost and geo
graphic location.
Stanford's new financial aid policy
is aimed at reducing the first con
straint on students' decisions. The
University is eliminating parental
contributions for families with total
annual incomes of less than $45,000
and reducing parental contributions
from families with total incomes be
tween $45,000 and $60,0(X).
The second complaint, concerning
the location of the University, will
likely be harder to solve. In the post
admissions survey given to admits last
year, non-enrolling admits wrote that
they viewed Stanford as an environ
ment as selective, challenging, intel
lectual, fun and impersonal — a wide
range of perspectives on location.
At the Faculty Senate meeting,
Shaw spoke about his plans to in
crease marketing to augment Stan
ford's appeal across the country. He

proposed using national and interna
tional Alumni Association groups to
conduct interviews and outreach
around the globe and to increase re
cruitment travel tenfold by joining the
"Exploring College Options" consor
tium with Duke, Georgetown, Har
vard and Penn, which travels to 300
cities in the fall of 2006 and spring of
2007.
At the meeting. Economics Prof.
Roger Noll, an elected member of the
Faculty Senate, raised a point about
the inconsistency between the rea
sons why students are not choosing
Stanford after being admitted and
Shaw's plans for improving the
process through more global out
reach.
"We might have better yield if we
increased the financial aid budget by
the proposed increase in the market
ing budget," Noll wrote in an email to
The Daily. "The issue is whether we
should deal with a relatively low ac

ceptance rate from [the South and
East) by trying to increase applica
tions (a low acceptance rate times a
greater number of applicants) or by
trying to raise the acceptance rate by
offering more financial aid."
At the meeting, Noll asked Shaw
why spending an extra $100,000
would be more productively spent on
marketing than on giving 100 students
$1,000 more in financial aid, especial
ly given budget constraints that could
preclude spending money on both op
tions.
"What I'm trying to accomplish is
to bring a very diverse perspective
from across the nation to Stanford,"
Shaw responded. "I'm not interested
in receiving more applications. I'm in
terested in reaching out to kids that
really are not on our wavelengths.
Quite frankly, the schools we compete
with do it ten times as much as we do
it. In other words, the representation
in their student bodies is much broad

er and deeper."
While Shaw's proposals may or
may not increase Stanford's yield
rate, it is still important to understand
why students might go elsewhere. On

a popular college admissions Web
site, there are 17 pages of posts under
the heading "Stanford or Harvard."
Jason Wong, a high school senior from
San Francisco, chose Harvard over
Stanford, even though Stanford of
fered him $100,000 more in financial
aid than Harvard over four years.
"In terms of recruitment, I appre
ciated Stanford's packet over Har
vard's because it was more celebrato
ry and recognized the work of every
admitted student; Harvard's was
more imposing." Wong said. "Stan
ford offered me a way better financial
aid package, which 1 had the hardest
time letting go.
"But 1 guess Harvard's location,
history,and different location won me
over," he reflected. "1 really want to
experience the Hast Coast,for at least
four years of my life. 1 also wanted to
be in the Boston area, where I could
potentially tap the resources and
meet other students at other top col
leges and universities in the area. I

wanted something different, and I
guess that was something that Stan
ford, although able to give me every
thing else, and maybe even more,
couldn't offer me."

"I liked my future classmates and
the people 1 met at Stanford more
than the people at Harvard, having at
tended both admit weekends for a
hit." Bennett said."People at Stanford
seemed far more socially adept and re
laxed. and people at Harvard seemed,
well, frazzled. Finally, the Stanford

In trying to increase its yield rate,
one initiative that the Stanford Ad
mission Office instituted this year and
will expand next year is the Likely
Admit Program, which reaches out to
the "most extraordinary" students
early, before the regular review mail
ing date. These students received a let
ter in January and follow-up calls
from Stanford faculty.This year, there
were 61 "Super-star Academic Like
lies" and 60 "Multicultural Likelies."
These 121 students were expected
to be admitted to every competitive
institution in the country. Stanford
tried to connect with them early to
convince them of the University's ap
peal as their best prospect. Shaw said
that he was still analyzing the yield
rates for these students.but the results
"looked good."
In terms of how to increase overall
yield rates, Shaw said he wants to
"make sure students know as much
as possible about this place when
making the decision. We want their
decision to be based on the facts of
the place and we attempt to make
their introduction to Stanford very
personal."
Though still a long way from Harvard's 80 percent,
Stanford's yield rate increased to a respectable 69 per
cent this year, up from 67 percent last year, according to
Richard Shaw, dean of admission and financial aid. The
number increased to approximately 88 percent for stu
dents who attended Admit Weekend or applied under
the single-choice early action program.
The yield rate is the percentage of Stanford's 2,430
admits that chose to join the University's Class of 2010.
The admission rate this year was the lowest ever, with
less than eleven percent of applicants admitted. The
yield rate is also among Stanford's highest, surpassing
Shaw's expected 68 percent.
