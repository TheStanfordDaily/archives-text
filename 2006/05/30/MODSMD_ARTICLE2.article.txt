Though still a long way from Harvard's 80 percent,
Stanford's yield rate increased to a respectable 69 per
cent this year, up from 67 percent last year, according to

number increased to approximately 88 percent for stu

the single-choice early action program.
The yield rate is the percentage of Stanford's 2,430
admits that chose to join the University's Class of 2010.
The admission rate this year was the lowest ever, with
less than eleven percent of applicants admitted. The
yield rate is also among Stanford's highest, surpassing
Shaw's expected 68 percent.
Shaw characterized this year's yield rate as "very
high and probably among the top five yields in the coun
try for selective private universities." Yale's yield rate is
expected to be 73 percent, while Princeton's is 69 per
cent.

MIT and 8 percent choosing Princeton; 31 percent of
students chose other schools. Similar statistics for the
Class of 2010 are not yet available, Shaw said.

ing their admission offers, these numbers beg the ques
tion: Why would students reject the sunny, happy, well
rounded institution? At a Faculty Senate meeting last
month, Shaw said that the two primary reasons students
