# Cardinal earn Texas Regional bid
## Men drop final two regular season games to UC-Davis on Friday and Saturday, finish regular season at 30-25 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
Entering their final series of the sea
son.a two-game set against UC-Davis,the
Cardinal were looking to put an exclama
tion point on a second half surge that
turned around their 2006 campaign. More
importantly, the Cardinal were playing to
solidify their case for a postseason berth.
With the announcement of the 64-
team NCAA tournament field set for
Monday morning, the members of the
Stanford squad knew that a three-game
winning streak to close out their regular
season schedule would allow them to
breathe just a little bit easier.
But it seems that the Curse of the Ag
gies, which has inexplicably plagued the
Stanford Athletics program this year, ex
tends even to the baseball diamond. The
Cardinal (30-25) were shutout by Davis
on Friday night at Sunken Diamond. 3-0,
and the Aggies (18-34) continued to
stymie the Stanford offense a day later in
an 8-3 in both teams' season finale.
Nevertheless, after an agonizingly long
wait yesterday morning, the Stanford
squad learned that it had been named to
the 16th and final four-team Regional
bracket for the NCAA postseason tour
nament. The Cardinal head to Austin.
Tex., this coming weekend, where they
are set to compete as the No. 3 seed
against No. 1 Texas (40-19), No. 2 North
Carolina State (38-21) and No. 4 Texas-
Arlington (29-34).
"We didn't know what fate was going
to hand us," junior righthander Greg
Reynolds said of the moments prior to se
lection announcement. "We knew we
were on the bubble. Coming here, I didn't
want to think about all the possibilities or
about what could or couldn't happen."
The degree of suspense might have
been minimized had the Cardinal per
formed more effectively against the Ag
gies over the weekend.
Reynolds took the hill for Stanford on
Friday night, limiting Davis to just three
runs in his fourth complete game effort in
five outings.
But while Reynolds looked to be in
fine postseason form, the Stanford of
fense was an entirely different story.
The Cardinal could only muster three
hits against Aggies hurler Michael Potter,
who faced three batters over the mini
mum in a masterful shutout. Ttoo of the
Cardinal's three hits led off the Stanford
half of the fourth inning, but Potter got

out of the jam by inducing a double-play
lineout and an inning-ending fly out to
right. Freshman Jason Castro's eighth-in
ning single was the only other blemish of
the Davis senior's evening.
"Potter did a great job pitching
tonight," Stanford shortstop Chris Mi
naker said. "He just was aggressive,
pitched well with his changeup and we got
ourselves out.To his credit, he stayed with
his plan and it worked."
The Cardinal bats finally came to life
on Saturday at Davis, as Stanford's hitters
combined for 12 hits on the day. But Ag
gies starter Vince DeCoito succeeded in
preventing the Cardinal from putting to
gether any serious rally in 8.2 innings of
work.
DeCoito surrendered a triple in the
top of the first inning to Stanford leadoff
man Ryan Seawell, who came in to score
one batter later on freshman Grant
Escue's sacrifice fly to center. It wasn't
until the top of the ninth that the Cardinal
were able to get onto the board again with
two unearned runs. But by that point, the
Aggies had already built a seven-run
cushion on the strength of three home
runs by Lukas Kirby, Aaron Hanke and
designated hitter Kevin James. Davis re
liever Nik Aurora came on in relief of De-
Coito, getting Minaker to strike out to
end the game.
But none of that matters now for the
Cardinal, who made the NCAA postsea
son for the 13th consecutive season. In
order to advance as the winner of the
Austin Regional, Stanford will need to
survive a double-elimination bracket for
mat that pits them against a powerful
Texas squad that finished with the best
record in the Big 12 conference and is
ranked No. 3 in the nation.
Earlier this season, Stanford took two
of three from the Longhorns at Sunken
Diamond â€” so as much as the odds may
be stacked against them, the Cardinal
have full confidence in their ability to win
their upcoming Regional.
"This is definitely a second chance,"
senior righthander Matt Manship said.
"Everyone is on the same level now, be
cause everyone's 0-0 now. At this point,
anyone who loses two games is gone."
Marquess announced Reynolds will
start Friday morning against North Car
olina State (9 a.m. Pacific Standard Time).
His Game 2 starter will be based upon
whether the Cardinal face Texas or Texas-
Arlington in their second game, to be held
at some point on Saturday.
