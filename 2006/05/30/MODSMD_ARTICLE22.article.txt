# Pick up the pace, baseball

Teenagers today just don't have
the time. Spoiled with a world
filled with video games and
microwavable Hot Pockets, teens are
accustomed to seeing things go their
way as soon as possible. They enjoy
the quick thrill of seeing music
videos on MTV rather than a three
part documentary on the Ottoman
Empire on the History Channel.
They'll take a calorie-ridden burger
from McDonald's over a nutrient
rich homemade meal. And most un
fortunately of all, they go for the im
mediate gratification of riding a
skateboard over playing baseball.
Within the past decade, baseball
has dramatically declined in popu
larity within the American teenage
population. According to the Sports
Business Research Network, only 25
percent of teens aged 12 to 17 partic
ipated in baseball in some form in
2(K)4, compared to 31.7 per cent in
1993. Skateboarding, meanwhile,
grew from 37.7 per cent participation
to 41.2 per cent over the same case
study time period.
Much of this phenomenon can be
attributed to the "slowness" of the
sport. Kids today simply don't pos
sess the attention spans to deal with
nine long innings of a drawn-out
game. The eternity between pitches,
the time it takes for a batter to reach
his stance in the box. the lack of actu
al action throughout the game — it
all adds up.
Major League Baseball can take a
number of measures to speed up the
sport. For one thing, umpires can
begin to implement a rule regulating
the time hurlers take 'twixt pitches.
Pitchers should actually be penalized
for not making their next throw with
in a certain time following the previ
ous one.
Furthermore, baseball's growing
emphasis on offense over pitching
extends the length of the actual
game. An acceptable ERA today is
below than 4.00, while the statistical
equivalent in the early century was
under 2.00. With batters dominating
the game, more time is eaten up for
to base-running, walks, and pitchers
attempting to catch a runner off
guard. As simple as it may sound, the
quicker the pitcher can accomplish
his three outs, the sooner the game
progresses from inning to inning.
But the sources of this declining
teenage audience extends beyond
the sport's speed.
According to CNN.com, ticket
prices in major league parks have
risen an average 26 per cent over the
past five years. I remember one
thing that brought me to Dodger
Stadium every week as a teen was
the comfort of knowing 1 could en
sure a bleacher seat in the outfield
for just six bucks. Combine that with
the three bucks of bus fare, and I
was entertained for quite a good
deal. The best way of getting these
kids hooked for life is by getting
them into the ballpark as soon as
possible. And since teens don't nec
essarily own the best disposable in
come, the availability of cheap seats
will keep baseball within the eco
nomic grasp of kids.
In a Wall Street Journal article,
author Daniel Costello points out
that the number of fans under the
age of 18 watching the World Series
on television fell 30 percent from
1996 to 2000. These October games
are broadcast at terrible hours for
youngsters, as primetime in some
time zones can run well beyond a
child's bedtime. I can recall missing
out on Florida's championship win
over the Indians in 1997 since it was a
school night.
The solution here is simple
enough — move the timeslot! Sure,
MLB can make more money today
with advertisers shelling out more
cash to make primetime, but in the
end the major leagues are only sacri
ficing a potential fan base.
The main problem — that base
ball no longer appealing to teenagers
—is a multifaceted problem that
cannot be solved easily. Rather, the
major leagues must look toward the
long-term in devising several strate
gies to ensure future generations will
love the sport so intimately tied to
this nation's history.
