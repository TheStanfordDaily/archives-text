SINGLES
The Cardinal picked up several Ws in NCAA
singles competition this past weekend at Taube
Tennis Center. Senior KC Corkery won four of
his matches in a run to the semifinals, while
freshman Matt Bruch picked up one win in his
NCAA debut.

Corkery dropped a tight three-setter to No. 14
Somdev Devvarman of Virginia in the semifinals
of the singles championship on Sunday. Corkery
never could quite get on top of the counter
punching Cavalier and trailed for the majority of
the match despite several valiant comebacks. He
lost 6-4,5-7,6-3.
Corkery served first in all three sets, but Dev
varman managed to open every set with a serv
ice break with his quickness and consistency.
Down 1-5 in the first set, Corkery served to pick
up the next three games and narrow Virginia's
lead to one game. However, Devvarman held
serve and picked up the first set, 6-4.
With the second set came another slew of

service breaks as both players broke in the first
two games of the set. Dewarman's lead was
never greater than two games in this set, and the
tone shifted at 4-all when Corkery held serve to
lead 5-4 and then 6-5. With a pump of his fist,
Corkery finished off the second set to stretch
Devvarman to a third.
In the third, Corkery found himself down a
break throughout the set. Meanwhile, Devvar
man dug deep for big shots on crucial points
Down 3-5, Corkery was serving to stay in the
match. But at 30-40, Devvarman hit a lob over
the senior's head. Corkery chased it down, but a
missed forehand ended his career on the Farm.
"[Devvarman] makes you play a lot of balls
and he ran me side to side a lot," Corkery said. "I
got a little tired of that. I felt good early in the
game, and then I just had a little mental lapse.
You really have to put the ball away when you're
up at the net, and 1 let him stick around a little
bit."'
On Saturday, Corkery ousted Clemson's No.
30 Clement Reix in straight sets, 7-5,6-2. Cork
ery opened the quarterfinal match with an ace.
With an easy hold at love, Corkery set the tone
of the match.
The second set began identically, and Cork
ery quickly jumped out to a 5-0 lead before drop
ping two games. However, when the Tiger
sprayed a forehand on matchpoint, Corkery
broke Reix at 5-2 to earn a spot in the Final Four.

Friday's Round of 16 pitted Corkery against
Arnau Brugues of Hilsa. Corkery led 4-1 in the
first but lost the next five consecutive games to
give Brugues the first set. However, in the sec
ond, with a pair of holds at love, Corkery easily
claimed the set, 6-2. In the final set, he emphati
cally produced a hold at love in the first game he
fore going on take the third set, 6-3.
In Thursday's second-round matches, Cork
ery won an easy 6-1,6-3 over Virginia Common
wealth's No. 15 Arnaud Lecloerec, while Bruch
dropped a close 7-6,7-5 loss to Ole Miss' Erling
Tveit. Tveit fell in the semifinals on Sunday to
eventual champion and top seed Benjamin
Kohlloeffel of UCLA.
As a result of his performance in the singles
championship, Corkery was named an ITA Ail-
American for the fourth time — a feat that only
25 other men can boast.
"As you go through a tournament like this,
you're not going to play your best tennis every
day," Corkery said. "Throughout the tourna
ment, I think the common theme with me was
just a lot of missed opportunities, but it was a
great week. I'm not disappointed — I've had a
great career here."

ford's pair won the first set against Anderson and
Rowe and forced a tiebreaker in the second. But
with the match on the line and the tiebreaker score
knotted at 6-6. the Illini pair won the next two points
to win the second set. A 6-4 third set in favor of An
derson and Rowe ended Stanford's hopes of a dou

With the top-seeded doubles team — and Cork
ery and Pade — knocked off in the first round, the
path cleared for a showcase Finals pitting second
seeded Scott Doerner and Andre Begemann of Pep
perdine against Anderson and Rowe.
The second-seeded Pepperdine pair of Doerner
and Begeman had only lost one set before meeting
the Fighting Illini in the finals. But nearly a week
after Pepperdine captured its first NCAA men's
team tennis championship, its top doubles team
could not add another trophy to the collection,
falling 6-2,6-4, to Illinois in the finals.
With the victory, Anderson and Rowe finish the
year with a 24-1 record. They entered their final
match with a national No. 4 ranking. To get there,
they knocked off the No. 29 ranked Texas team of
Callum Beale and Miguel Reyes Varela in straight
sets in the quarterfinals and No. 27 Rafael Abreu
and Jordan Freitas of Texas Christian in straight sets
in the semifinals.
This year marks the second time in four years that
a doubles team from Illinois has won the champi
onship. Prior to 2003, however, the school had never
accomplished the feat.
Doerner and Begemann were the first Waves
doubles team to advance to the Finals since 1998. In
the semifinals, they downed No. 6 Marco Born and
Andreas Siljestrom from Middle Tennessee in
straight sets.
TTie Pepperdine duo were also a key part of Pep
perdine's NCAA title run, as Begemann clinched
the upset victory over Georgia in the final match
with his singles win. The pair also took the doubles
point in the championship match against Georgia.
Doerner was the team's No. 1 singles and doubles

match. But at 30-40, Devvarman hit a lob over
the senior's head. Corkery chased it down, but a
missed forehand ended his career on the Farm.
"[Devvarman] makes you play a lot of balls
and he ran me side to side a lot," Corkery said. "I
got a little tired of that. I felt good early in the
game, and then I just had a little mental lapse.
You really have to put the ball away when you're
up at the net, and 1 let him stick around a little
bit."'

American for the fourth time — a feat that only
25 other men can boast.
"As you go through a tournament like this,
you're not going to play your best tennis every

ment, I think the common theme with me was
just a lot of missed opportunities, but it was a
great week. I'm not disappointed — I've had a
great career here."
