NCAA debut.
In his last match in Stanford uniform. No. 25
Corkery dropped a tight three-setter to No. 14
Somdev Devvarman of Virginia in the semifinals
of the singles championship on Sunday. Corkery
never could quite get on top of the counter
punching Cavalier and trailed for the majority of
the match despite several valiant comebacks. He
lost 6-4,5-7,6-3.
Corkery served first in all three sets, but Dev
varman managed to open every set with a serv
ice break with his quickness and consistency.
Down 1-5 in the first set, Corkery served to pick
up the next three games and narrow Virginia's
lead to one game. However, Devvarman held
serve and picked up the first set, 6-4.
With the second set came another slew of

service breaks as both players broke in the first
two games of the set. Dewarman's lead was
never greater than two games in this set, and the
tone shifted at 4-all when Corkery held serve to
lead 5-4 and then 6-5. With a pump of his fist,
Corkery finished off the second set to stretch
Devvarman to a third.
In the third, Corkery found himself down a
break throughout the set. Meanwhile, Devvar
man dug deep for big shots on crucial points
Down 3-5, Corkery was serving to stay in the
match. But at 30-40, Devvarman hit a lob over
the senior's head. Corkery chased it down, but a
missed forehand ended his career on the Farm.
"[Devvarman] makes you play a lot of balls
and he ran me side to side a lot," Corkery said. "I
got a little tired of that. I felt good early in the
game, and then I just had a little mental lapse.
You really have to put the ball away when you're
up at the net, and 1 let him stick around a little
bit."'
On Saturday, Corkery ousted Clemson's No.
30 Clement Reix in straight sets, 7-5,6-2. Cork
ery opened the quarterfinal match with an ace.
With an easy hold at love, Corkery set the tone
of the match.

ping two games. However, when the Tiger
sprayed a forehand on matchpoint, Corkery
broke Reix at 5-2 to earn a spot in the Final Four.

Friday's Round of 16 pitted Corkery against
Arnau Brugues of Hilsa. Corkery led 4-1 in the
first but lost the next five consecutive games to
give Brugues the first set. However, in the sec
ond, with a pair of holds at love, Corkery easily
claimed the set, 6-2. In the final set, he emphati
cally produced a hold at love in the first game he

eventual champion and top seed Benjamin
Kohlloeffel of UCLA.
As a result of his performance in the singles
championship, Corkery was named an ITA Ail-
American for the fourth time — a feat that only
25 other men can boast.
"As you go through a tournament like this,
you're not going to play your best tennis every
day," Corkery said. "Throughout the tourna
ment, I think the common theme with me was
just a lot of missed opportunities, but it was a
great week. I'm not disappointed — I've had a
great career here."
