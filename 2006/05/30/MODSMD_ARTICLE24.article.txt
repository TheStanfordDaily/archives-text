## Card can't repeat success Logar falls to eventual NCAA singles champion 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
After the jubilant elation following last
liiesday's NCAA team championship, it is
•illy natural that the members of the
. <mien's tennis team feel a certain letdown
the conclusion of the individual tourna
ents. For the first time in four years, no
irdinal player competed in yesterday's
lgles or doubles championship match.
Not that the team was unsuccessful in
he singles and doubles tournaments. Far
< oni it, as junior Theresa Logar made it to
lie singles semifinals and senior Alice
"..li nes and junior Anne Yelsey made it to
he doubles semifinals. However, with
iarnes and Yelsey the top-ranked doubles
am nearly all year and both Barnes and
•Mow senior Amber Liu holding a top
iglit seed in the singles draw, the final re
alts did not meet expectations.
"Obviously, it's really disappointing
ight now but we've had an incredible
ear," Yelsey said of Sunday's doubles loss.
I ve loved every minute of it. It's just a lit
le disappointing to go out this way."
The semifinal matches on Sunday
tunned many. Barnes and Yelsey fell in
wo sets to No. 13 Cristelle Grier and Alex-
Prousis of Northwestern, 6-3, 6-2. Grier
nid Prousis advanced to take home the
loubles title the next day.
"I think it's pretty simple," Barnes said.
I think we just didn't play well enough to
in. I think they played well and they obvi
hislv had a game plan that they were using
gainst us. I struggled on my serve, which is
oing to be a bit of a problem. It's obvious
y disappointing right now but we held the

No. 1 ranking pretty much all year so after
the disappointment, I'd like to focus on
that. They just played well today."
Logar, who also fell in the semifinals, ex
pressed more optimism than disappoint
ment
"I felt like I did really well to get to the
semis," she said. "I would have liked to
have gone further but it was definitely a
good tournament, I can't deny that. I've got
one more year so hopefully I can do better
next year."
Logar fell to eventual singles champion
Suzi Babos of California in three sets, 4-6,
6-3,2-6. Though unseeded to Logar's 9-16
seed in the tournament, Babos last year
earned the ITA National Player to Watch
award, given to someone predicted to win a
national title during her college career.
Liu and Barnes were both expected to
advance deep into the singles tournament.
There was even widespread speculation
that Liu might become the first-ever player
to win three NCAA singles titles (she won
in 2003 and 2004).
Both seniors, however, fell on Friday in
the round of 16. William & Mary's Megan
Moulton-Levy beat Barnes, 6-3, 6-3.
UCLA's Riza Zalameda defeated Liu, 5-7,
6-2,7-5, but lost to Babos in the quarterfi
nals the next day.
Though wanting to end their college ca
reers on high notes, Barnes and Liu re
mained upbeat about the tournament.
"The way I go out, that doesn't really
matter," Barnes said. "I'll just remember
my four years here."
For others on the team, the results ex
ceeded expectations. Sophomore Whitney
Deason, unseeded in the tournament,near
ly knocked out the No. 1 seed, Miami's
Audra Cohen, in the round of 32. Deason
came within two games of the upset, but ul
timately faded and lost 6-2,4-6,0-6.
"I just kind of ran out of steam," Deason

said. "But I'm really happy with my per
formance. It's a nice way to end the sea
son."
Fellow sophomore Celia Durkin was
also an unseeded success story, as she ad
vanced to the singles quarterfinals where
she lost to USC's Lindsey Nelson, 7-5,0-6,
3-6. Nelson was the runner-up in the singles
championship.
As Barnes looked back on her four
years at Stanford and what the team has
achieved, she described the program as
only a seasoned veteran would.
"I think there's a danger with Stanford
tennis that you will take everything for

granted and never sit back and enjoy your
wins," she said. "I think now that the sea
son's over and we've done what we wanted
to do, we need to sit back and enjoy the fact
that we were a part of history. I think that's
something that we should really be proud
of. It's important when you're with Stan
ford athletics not just look on to the next
thing and the next thing — it's really im
portant to enjoy the things you achieve."
The team now gets that chance to rest
on its laurels for a while, enjoying the sum
mer off and the White House visit in July
that accompanies its national champi
onship.
