Dauber has been named the first Law
School professor to win The Walter J.
Gores Award since 1977.
The Gores Award, the University's
highest teaching honor, is traditionally
presented to between three and six mem

bers of the Stanford teaching community.
At least one senior faculty member — as
sociate or full — or senior lecturer, one
junior faculty member or teaching staff
member and one teaching assistant — un
dergraduate or graduate — receive the
award each year.
Dauber has been teaching at Stanford
for five years. She is currently an associ
ate professor, hut will be eligible for pro
motion to full professor next year. A pro
fessor by courtesy in the Sociology De
partment, Dauber oversees the Law
School's joint degree program with soci
ology, also acting as an adviser for sociol
ogy graduate students whose work in
volves law-related topics.

"She teaches Torts to
the first-year students
and a variety of classes
on legal history and soci
ology and law to second
and third-year law stu
dents," said Law School
Dean Larry Kramer.
"She dedicates a lot of
time to her students,
helping them not just
with the class but also

helping them think about their careers
and their life at law school."
"I think students especially appreciate
her candor both in and out of class," he
continued. "Michele is brilliant and one of

the best young legal scholars in the coun
try."
According to Kramer, Dauber's main
area of research is government response
to emergencies, which she has used as a
lens to understand the development of a
regulatory state in the period between the
Civil War and the New Deal.
"I'm trying to make an authentic con
nection with students and the award rein
forces, to some extent, that I've been suc
cessful in that endeavor." she said. "I hope
to stay at Stanford next year to continue to
do what I've been doing."

email requesting them to appear in
