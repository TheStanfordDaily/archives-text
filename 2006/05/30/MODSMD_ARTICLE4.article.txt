## Site creates campus e-market SUPost aims to provide venue for local exchange, including event info 
### CHRISTOPHER LIN STAFF WRITER 
When freshman Adam Klotz moved
into Paloma last September, he was
eager to make his room as cozy as possi
ble. He and his roommate rearranged
their desks, beds and other furniture to
make way for the futon they believed
would be theirs. Soon, however, they
discovered that getting a futon is harder
than it seems.
"I looked through the For Sale post
ings on CraigsList.org, but nearly all of
them required me to go pick up the
futon myself," Klotz said. "My room
mate and I don't have cars, and it's dif
ficult to find someone who's willing to
lend us a truck that's big enough to
haul a futon across two cities. In the
end, we found a seller who was will
ing to deliver, but not having the
chance to check the futon before we
bought it was definitely a disadvan
tage. Buying a used futon from
someone at Stanford would have
been a lot easier."
Similar frustrations led electrical
engineering graduate student Greg
Wientjes to create the Web site SU-
Post.com. While earning a bachelor's
in Mathematics in 2004. Wientjes
said he grew frustrated at the lack of
a "Web site that would tell me what's
happening on the Stanford campus
or help me to buy discounted com
puter equipment. So, 1 decided to
build it."
With a format similar to
CraigsList.org, SUPost.com offers
students the ability to find and post

classified ads as well as informa
tion about Stanford events.The site
also contains a personals section, a
housing sublet section and job
postings. To ensure that the site is
restricted to members of the Stan
ford community, users must enter a
Stanford email address before
posting. The Web site also offers
users the opportunity to post links
to their Facebook profiles in order
to ease communication between
buyer and seller.
"Stanford students have been
trying to build a Web site that serves
the same purpose as SUPost for
years." Wietnjes said. "All of these
Web sites have failed. I believe the
user statistics of SUPost thus far is
an indicator that SUPost has a more
effective design and interface than
its predecessors."
According to Wientjes, the site
currently boasts more than 846
postings, with 434 items for sale and
269 postings with information
about events at Stanford. Since the
site launched on Mav 15, it has re

ceived 1,159 unique visits from
Stanford students and more than
11,449 page views.
"The prices for items listed on
SUPost are drastically lower than
retail prices," Wientjes said. "One
of the postings is a 1986 Plymouth
Voyager SE minivan for sale for
$300. An HP laptop is for sale for
$200, and a 19-inch computer mon
itor is selling for $15. A bike is sell
ing for $20. And, both a microwave
and refrigerator together are sell
ing for $10."
The site also provides stu
dents with a one-stop source for
information about Stanford
events.
"Currently, event information is
sent out through a multitude of
email lists and paper fliering," Wien
tjes noted. "However, a student
would have to subscribe to all email
lists to know all the event informa
tion happening on-campus, which
would be awkward and time con
suming. A student would have to sort
and read through thousands of

emails per day to know all of the
events that were taking place at
Stanford. With SUPost, students can
go to just a single information source
to find out potentially everything
they want to know about on-campus
events."
Wientjes has begun to promote
the site around the Stanford campus
with, ironically enough, a multitude
of paper fliers. He garnered support
from student authorities and ad
ministrators by speaking with
ASSU President Elizabeth Heng, a
junior, as well as at the Graduate
Student Council meeting on May
24. Junior Emma Yuen, president of
Students for a Sustainable Stanford,
has also endorsed the site's goal for
reducing waste.
"I remember seeing a perfectly
good sofa in the dumpster next to
Kimball Hall two years ago at the
end of the school year," Wientjes re
called. "Since the end of the school
year is now just a few weeks away, it's
the perfect time to introduce SUPost
to the Stanford student body."
