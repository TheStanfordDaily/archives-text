Students who imagine taking a study break at a
tapas bar with their Stanford peers and new
Madrid companeros may soon realize their
dreams as the Bing Overseas Studies Program
(BOSP) staff work to open a new center in Spain's
major urban center.
Students may currently apply to study abroad at

language among the student body.
"A substantial number of Stanford students study
in Spain at present with other programs," he said.
Historically, however, overseas studies programs
in Spanish-speaking countries have had limited suc
cess in terms of student enrollment.
"There was a Stanford program at one point in
Salamanca, Spain, but it was closed down a number
of years ago for a variety of reasons," Naimark re

students attended the University of Salamanca for
