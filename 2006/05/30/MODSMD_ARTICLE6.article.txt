## BOSP works to put Madrid site on map Locations in Spain dosed in past due to lack of student interest 
### KATHERINE COX STAFF WRITER 
Students who imagine taking a study break at a
tapas bar with their Stanford peers and new
Madrid companeros may soon realize their
dreams as the Bing Overseas Studies Program
(BOSP) staff work to open a new center in Spain's
major urban center.
Students may currently apply to study abroad at
nine established locations ranging from Oxford to
Moscow, while a handful of "special programs" offer
more tailored learning opportunities on a limited
basis. A center in Spain — to which students could
theoretically apply for admission on a quarterly basis
— has been in the works for several years. In 2(X)3,for
mer Academic Director of BOSP Amos Nur told the
Stanford Report that the BOSP staff was mulling over
the idea of opening centers in Spain as well as in India
and Mexico.
In a recent interview with The Daily, Norman
Naimark, a professor of Eastern European Studies
and current BOSP director, indicated that a program
in Madrid and the expansion of the current "special
program" in South Africa are his main priorities.
ITiis weekend, Naimark confirmed that BOSP
staff members are laying the groundwork for a Stan
ford program in Madrid by recruiting an administra
tor to oversee the project.
"We have just sent out an advertisement for direc
tor of the program, who will then work with us and
with colleagues and institutions in Spain and on cam
pus to help us set up the most interesting and intellec
tually challenging program possible," he said.
The Madrid effort is driven mostly by student in
terest, Naimark said, as Spanish is a prevalent second
language among the student body.
"A substantial number of Stanford students study
in Spain at present with other programs," he said.
Historically, however, overseas studies programs
in Spanish-speaking countries have had limited suc
cess in terms of student enrollment.
"There was a Stanford program at one point in
Salamanca, Spain, but it was closed down a number
of years ago for a variety of reasons," Naimark re
called. During the 1990-1991 school year, Stan
ford shut down this program, where Spanish-fluent
students attended the University of Salamanca for
two consecutive quarters. Before
the $25 million donation from
Peter and Helen Bing, the then-
Overseas Studies Program was
forced to make budget cuts. Sala
manca's relative unpopularity —
only about 15 students enrolled
each year — forced administrators
to close down the center and re
structure other programs. In addi
tion, centers in Puebla, Mexico,
and Buenos Aires were closed in
2002 and 2003 due to low student
interest.
In a previous interview with The
Daily, Naimark observed that stu
dent reactions and hype determine
the success of one center relative to
another. For instance, the program in
Santiago, he said, has received an in
creasing number of applications, due
in large part to the quality of the pro
gram and facilities and the praise of
returning students.

Naimark said he was confident
that Madrid will be an attractive lo
cation for Stanford students.
"Madrid is the governmental,
cultural, economic and education
al center of Spain, and is easily
within reach of other major Span
ish cities and cultural/historical
sites," he said.
BOSP will also maximize and di
versify student enrollment by build
ing a comprehensive academic pro
gram.
"We would like to establish a pro
gram that will be of interest to stu
dents in all majors in all of our under
graduate schools," Naimark said.
Though BOSP is committed to
adding Madrid to its perennial list of
centers, the program is far from com
pletion.
"We do not have a projected
opening date. We want to make sure
everything is in place before we start
planning the opening, and that will
take some time," Naimark said.
Without a Stanford-sponsored
program, students are looking else
where to satiate their interest in
Spain.

Sophomore Clea Alsip plans to
study in Spain next fall. A double
major in international relations and
drama, she chose an outside program
based on the availability of courses
in both disciplines. New York Uni
versity's program in Spain offered
the only transferable drama classes,
so she will study and board at their
campus.
But Alsip says she would have
much preferred applying to a pro
gram offered through Stanford.
"There are a lot of worries and
paperwork that come with partici
pating in another abroad program,"
she said.
Alsip will have to petition to en
sure that classes taken in Spain will
apply toward her majors, and she will
have to pay for an extra month of
school since she will technically be
on the semester system.
Sophomore Jonathan Dunlap
agreed that making one's own
arrangements for studying in Spain
is a hassle.
Dunlap, a human biology major,
will arrive in Spain in mid-Septem
ber to study at the Complutense

University of Madrid. He will study
under the auspices of International
Studies Abroad (ISA), a private or
ganization that facilitates foreign ed
ucation in a number of countries. Al
though Dunlap said he is excited, he
lamented the limited BOSP program
offerings.
"The major drawback in studying
in Spain at a non-Stanford campus is
that 1 am essentially taking a quarter
off in regards to completing my
major," he said. "Other human biolo
gy majors who are either staying
here or studying in Australia have
the option to complete classes that
will count towards their major — if
I'm lucky, I'll receive some transfer
credits towards the required 180 for
graduation."
But for Dunlap, and for many
others who have forged their own
way, even several setbacks don't off
set Spain's allure.
"Spain's culture, history, lan
guage, location, diversity and —
of course — nightlife make it an
incredibly appealing destination
for students to study abroad," he
said.

dent reactions and hype determine
the success of one center relative to
another. For instance, the program in
Santiago, he said, has received an in
creasing number of applications, due
in large part to the quality of the pro
gram and facilities and the praise of
returning students.

Naimark said he was confident
that Madrid will be an attractive lo
cation for Stanford students.
"Madrid is the governmental,
cultural, economic and education
al center of Spain, and is easily
within reach of other major Span
ish cities and cultural/historical
sites," he said.
BOSP will also maximize and di
versify student enrollment by build
ing a comprehensive academic pro
gram.
"We would like to establish a pro
gram that will be of interest to stu
dents in all majors in all of our under
graduate schools," Naimark said.
Though BOSP is committed to
adding Madrid to its perennial list of
centers, the program is far from com
pletion.
"We do not have a projected
opening date. We want to make sure
everything is in place before we start
planning the opening, and that will
take some time," Naimark said.
Without a Stanford-sponsored
program, students are looking else
where to satiate their interest in
Spain.

Sophomore Clea Alsip plans to
study in Spain next fall. A double
major in international relations and
drama, she chose an outside program
based on the availability of courses
in both disciplines. New York Uni
versity's program in Spain offered
the only transferable drama classes,
so she will study and board at their
campus.
But Alsip says she would have
much preferred applying to a pro
gram offered through Stanford.
"There are a lot of worries and
paperwork that come with partici
pating in another abroad program,"
she said.
Alsip will have to petition to en
sure that classes taken in Spain will
apply toward her majors, and she will
have to pay for an extra month of
school since she will technically be
on the semester system.
Sophomore Jonathan Dunlap
agreed that making one's own
arrangements for studying in Spain
is a hassle.
Dunlap, a human biology major,
will arrive in Spain in mid-Septem
ber to study at the Complutense

University of Madrid. He will study
under the auspices of International
Studies Abroad (ISA), a private or
ganization that facilitates foreign ed
ucation in a number of countries. Al
though Dunlap said he is excited, he
lamented the limited BOSP program
offerings.
"The major drawback in studying
in Spain at a non-Stanford campus is
that 1 am essentially taking a quarter
off in regards to completing my
major," he said. "Other human biolo
gy majors who are either staying
here or studying in Australia have
the option to complete classes that
will count towards their major — if
I'm lucky, I'll receive some transfer
credits towards the required 180 for
graduation."
But for Dunlap, and for many
others who have forged their own
way, even several setbacks don't off
set Spain's allure.
"Spain's culture, history, lan
guage, location, diversity and —
of course — nightlife make it an
incredibly appealing destination
for students to study abroad," he
said.
