### LAURA CARWILE STAFF WRITER 
Tom Brokaw, longtime NBC jour
nalist and celebrated author, will
speak to graduating seniors on June
18 as part of this year's Commence
ment exercises. While many commu
nity members have expressed wide
spread support for Brokaw,some say
that other schools' speakers would
have made for better selections.
University administrators believe
that Brokaw fits the ideal graduation
speaker.
"Tom Brokaw represents the very
best of the journalistic tradition,"
University President John Hennessy
stated in a recent press release,"(He]
has a unique perspective on some of
the most critical events of our recent
history. As a Stanford parent, he
knows our university well. I look for
ward to hearing his observations and
insights, as well as the advice he has

to offer to both our graduates and
their families."
While many students — includ
ing the senior leadership— have
echoed Hennessy's sentiments, oth
ers expressed envy toward the
speakers at peer institutions.
Former President Clinton will
speak at Princeton's Commence
ment on June 5, and some Stanford
students have expressed interest in
hearing Clinton speak.
"Bill Clinton would he great to
have as Stanford's Commencement
speaker," said Clea Alsip, a sopho
more."! hope he's the speaker at my
graduation."
Yale hosted CNN news anchor
Anderson Cooper on May 21.
"Clinton and Cooper would have
been great to hear," said Natalie Far
rell, who went on to compare other
school's speakers with Stanford's
choice.
"Tom Brokaw as a Commence
ment speaker is like an adult contem
porary radio station," she said. "It of
fends no one, but is pretty difficult to
get really excited about."
When asked who her ideal Com
mencement speaker would be. Far-
rell offered a surprising, if sarcastic, response.
"Donald Rumsfeld," she said. "Because then
so many people would boycott the ceremony in
protest that my entire family might actually have
enough seats."
As for other schools. Harvard will host award
winning television journalist Jim Lehrer on June
5, while University of Pennsylvania graduates
heard from actress Jodie Foster on May 15.
Senator Barack Obama (D-IL) will speak at
Northwestern's June 16 ceremonies, and former
Vice-President A 1 Gore's daughter Karenna
Gore-Schiff spoke at Columbia on May 17.
Despite some students' concerns about
Brokaw's ability to inspire graduates, other sen
iors expressed support for their Commencement
speaker.
"Tom Brokaw seems like a good choice for
Commencement," said Waasil Kareem. "He is
well-known and a great public speaker. I am sure
he will have insightful and interesting things to
say."
The senior class presidents were similarly sup
portive and eager to hear Brokaw's address.
"[Brokaw] has had a front-row seat at some of
the great historic moments of our time," they stat
ed in a joint press release, "[He has] grappled
with some of the toughest ethical and profession
al issues along the way. We are eager to hear what
he has to say."
