## Why does depression decrease with age? Psychology PhD candidate associates depression with age and genetics 
### GEORGIA WELLS 
Even during her angst-filled high school years in
Scotland, Elaine Robertson had a plan. Observ
ing her peers' extreme emotional mood swings,
she knew she wanted to study anxiety disorders.
After this epiphany, the steps to her goal were pret
ty straightforward — it just took a little work. She mod
estly credits her "amazing" high school math and sci
ence teachers for helping her get into Oxford, where
she received her bachelor's and master's degrees in phi
losophy and psychology.
She then came to Stanford as a research assistant in
Prof. John Gabrieli's Cognitive Neuroscience Laborato
ry. Though this allowed her to move closer to the nitty
gritty of her original interest, her job focused more on
how healthy young adults regulate their emotions.
"Fortunately," she reports, "the majority of students
seemed well balanced."
Now a PhD candidate in adviser lan Gotlib's Mood
and Anxiety Disorders Laboratory, Robertson is at last
getting down to the real thing: the psychopathology of
depression and anxiety. Today her research has broad
ened to consider the impact age may have on depression.
Through connections with Prof. Laura Carstensen's
Aging Psychology Laboratory, Robertson is comparing
mood regulation in the old versus the young.
She hopes to do so by showing how cognitive abili
ties change as people age. While it seems that the abili
ty to complete cognitive tasks declines with age,
Robertson says selective attention and decision-mak
ing improve in old age. She wonders whether any of this
impacts mood.
"Ultimately I'd like to understand why there is less
depression in older adults," she says. "What is different
about depression in younger adults and depression in
older adults?"
Robertson is currently investigating why mature and
elderly adults are better at regulating emotions.
"Can we look at depression as a disorder in emotion
regulation? Is depression in younger adults the same as
depression in older adults?" Robertson asks. "Perhaps,
if we can answer these questions, we will be able to
apply what we know about older adults and their abili
ty to better regulate their emotions to younger adults in
therapy for depression."
Robertson highlighted the importance of doing so,
noting that roughly one-third of people will suffer from

a depressive episode at some point in life. Scientists
agree that there is both a genetic component and an en
vironmental component. Most psychologists today
look to the Diathesis-stress model, which attributes de
pression to a genetic vulnerability.This triggers an onset
of depression when the person encounters a traumatic
stressor, such as a divorce or death of a loved one.
Much of Robertson's research involves the use of
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a tech
nique that uses an MRI machine, a three-dimensional
imaging device. Developed in 1992, fMRI measures the
ratio of oxygenated todeoxygenated blood in the brain.
The brain acts like a muscle — as the amount of blood
increases in a particularsection.it is used more. In fMRI
experiments, researchers will scan the brain of a subject
looking at both negative pictures like car accidents and
non-negative pictures like playgrounds. From the fMRI
scan, scientists can see which sections of the brain have
more blood when the subject is performing different
functions, like regulating emotion.
"The exciting thing is that if a section of the brain has
more blood in it when the subject is performing a cer
tain task, then we can say that the section is involved.
With the fMRI we can tie together behaviors and brain
parts," Robertson explains.
Outside of the lab, Robertson enjoys giving talks
about the brain at local elementary schools. She even
brings along real animal brains and surgical gloves for
the students to touch and explore while she explains the
cognitive functions of their different parts.
"My goal is to inspire and open kids' minds to sci
ence," she says."The entire presentation is interactive
— making science of the brain tangible and accessible
for this age group."
Robertson began giving these talks when she was a
research assistant. Many of the studies involved scan
ning children's brains with an fMRI to see how emotion
regulation develops. The idea behind the talks was to
get kids interested enough to go to the lab to be scanned
— but when the studies were finished. Robertson found
the talks to be so popular that she continued.
Recently, Robertson received a grant from the Na
tional Science Foundation that will allow her to contin
ue to give her talks at public schools. Her presentation to
one class inspired a student so much that she announced
afterward that she too would grow up to be a scientist.

"Perhaps... we will be able to apply what we know about
older adults and their ability to better regulate their
emotions to younger adults in therapy for depression."
