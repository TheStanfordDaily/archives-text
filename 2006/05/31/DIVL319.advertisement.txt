General Scowcroft's twenty-nine-year military career began with graduation
from West Point and concluded at the rank of Lieutenant General following
service as the Deputy National Security Advisor.
Out of uniform, he continued in a public policy capacity by serving on the
President's Advisory Committee on Arms Control and the Commission on
Strategic Forces. He was also one of the key members of the President's
Special Review Board, also known as the Tower Commission. The Tower
Commission, appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986, was not only
critical of the Reagan White House, it also brought to light the direct
connection between the Reagan Administration and both Iran and the
Nicaraguan Contras.

Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, and an authority on
China. Professor Oksenberg was consistently outspoken about the need for
the United States to engage with Asia in a more considered manner.
