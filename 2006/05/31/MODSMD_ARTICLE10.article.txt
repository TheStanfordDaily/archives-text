## Editorial Yahoo's music service deserves another listen 
### 
Last October, the Editorial Board was
enthusiastic about the Yahoo! Music
Unlimited pilot program, which
granted students free access to song down
loads ("New download service is music to
our ears," Oct. 18,2005). A year later, those
of us who use the service enjoy a wide selec
tion of songs.
We repeat our commendation of the
many campus departments — the ASSU,
Residential Computing, the Office of the
Dean of Students, ITSS, the Office of the
General Counsel, the Office of the Vice Pres
idents for Business Affairs, among others —
who worked closely with one another to
make this service available to students.
The Board hopes — somewhat naively,
perhaps — that the same anonymous donor
who sponsored the program this year will
pick up the tab for next year's students. But at
this point, we are unsure if this is going to
happen. As it stands, students can choose to
continue their subscription after the free
service ends.Those who forget to cancel their
subscription before Sept. 30 will be charged a
monthly subscription fee.
But would most Stanford students be will
ing to pay for this service? And if so, should
the University include this subscription fee in
the University bill?
We don't know. After all, why should stu
dents who cannot even use this service be
forced to pay for it? In this light, mandatory
subscription to the service is excessive and
unjustifiable. The cost of tuition at Stanford
has been spiraling upwards out of control,
and the last thing we need is another unnec
essary expense.
More data must be collected before we
can determine the number of students who
actually use the program. We already know
that Yahoo's service does not work on Macs
or iPods. And students with access to it might
use it less frequently once the initial enthusi
asm wanes. As such, the University should

work with the ASSU to gauge the program's
popularity before arriving at a decision.
At first glance, making the service manda
tory for all students seems to help the Uni
versity manage its legal liabilities. We don't
claim to have comprehensive knowledge of
the complex legal issues that the University
confronts. But it seems clear to us that as long
as students continue to download music ille
gally, the University is potentially at risk of
lawsuits from record companies. As such, the
University could curb such liabilities by mak
ing the music download service mandatory.
Even then, making the service compulso
ry would not be a foolproof solution because
not all students have equal access to it in the
first place. Besides, the University could take
other reasonable precautions to deter illegal
file sharing while raising student awareness
about copyright infringement.
However, the most compelling reason for
making the service mandatory is to protect
individual students who have found them
selves at the receiving end of expensive law
suits. After all. the music industry has target
ed individual college students for copyright
infringement. But if students have legal op
tions for downloading music, they will be less
inclined to use illegal file-sharing software.
Clearly, this is an issue that begs more in
formation from the administration and more
feedback from students. The University
could explain its legal liabilities to the stu
dent body, while the new batch of elected
ASSU senators should gather student input
through surveys.
In general, the University as a whole —
administrators and students alike — needs
to revisit measures implemented earlier in
the year. The Board hopes that today's ed
itorial— along with yesterday's on Late
Nite ("Late Nite: a triumph for student ad
vocacy," May 30) — will foster greater ac
countability and long-term thinking within
the University.
