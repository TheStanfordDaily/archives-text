# Bringing back the lost art of geeking out
## 
### 
We're Stanford students. Learning is
what we're here for. Right? We're all
smart, of course. Lots of us were
valedictorians or perfect-scorers on the SAT.
No big. And although most of us probably
worked hard in high school, it came pretty
naturally. Sure, there was competition at my
big public high school, but there really wasn't
anything 1 couldn't do if I tried — all while
getting almost nine hours of sleep every night.
Sure, I had to work to do well in a couple of
science or math classes (surprise! I'm a
fuzzy), but as I suspect was the case with most
of us, I was ultimately successful in pretty
much all of my classes. (Besides sophomore
P.E. — what kind of class grades on how
many times you can hit a volleyball against a
wall, anyway?!)
As I suspect most of us have discovered,
though, college is something different. Except
for that bastard who never studies but skews
the curve with his high scores, we probably all
find that there's a narrow range of subjects at
which we really excel, and even then we have
to work a whole lot harder than we used to.
The time 1 spend working on paper-writing
each quarter or the number of pages I read
each week would have been unfathomable to
High-School-Marissa. College-Marissa, how
ever, has learned to take it in stride.
Everyone has different college goals, and
being at Stanford means something different
for everyone. But at its heart, college is about
learning. We wouldn't be here if not for Stan
ford's stellar academics. Sometimes, between
I-Hum, PWR, WIM classes and other re
quirements, we get caught in the trap of think
ing about school as just something we have to
do, and it gets pushed to the sidelines to make
way for the rest of the Awesome College Ex
perience — extracurriculars, friends, sports,
whatever.
But the fact that we're here means that we
did well in sch<x>l in the past — so we must
enjoy learning. Although we're not always ex
cited to sit down and read those hundred
pages or do that problem set, I think that
everyone must be passionate, at some level,
about what they're learning. Maybe we don't
always talk about it, but academics really are
the root of everything. Even the die-hard
partiers can buckle down and study. And no
matter how much we may deny it, I think
everyone here is a geek at heart.
I'll admit somewhat sheepishly — but
mostly proudly — that I can recite the first 40
digits of pi and the chronology of the Ameri
can presidents and the monarchs of England

since William the Conqueror. Why? Because
when I was in high school I sat down and
memorized them, just for the hell of it. Mo
ments like this — geeking out and learning
simply for the sake of learning — have
seemed harder to come by at Stanford.

One of the prompts on a college applica
tion asked me to describe my intellectual
coming of age. 1 described an excellent AP
European History course that sparked my
own mental enlightenment in 10th grade. Lie.
My real coming of age story is set in a rigor
ous, take-no-prisoners seminar at the end of
my freshman year at Stanford. Three weeks
into the class, we read the first half of a ridicu
lously dense criticism of theoretical ap
proaches to history (thrilling. 1 know),and de
spite my best efforts, I couldn't even finish it.
Six weeks later, however, we read the second
half of the work, which was still mind-numb
ingly boring, but now surprisingly intelligible.
In the movie of life, this was the point where
the camera did a slow pan out on me enthusi
astically discussing the book, while the Maris
sa voice over narrated how this was the first
moment I saw how far I had come. This was
my real intellectual enlightenment.
One of my personal goals for this year, be
sides exercising more (pff) and making an ef
fort to get out of the dorm more (pff) was to
be able to ?geek out? and remember to enjoy
learning for its own sake. I'm not sure if I ac
complished it — I did declare a major that
I'm passionate about and for which I (at least
sometimes) enjoy doing the reading. So let's
say that counts.
A friend once told me that he thought the
best test of whether you truly love the subject
that you're studying is if you would do the
reading even if you didn't have to. In an ideal
world, this is true; but even if that's not the
case, we all have something that we love.
Maybe it just has to be uncovered from the
bother of requirements and whatnot. Even if
it is just memorizing pi.
