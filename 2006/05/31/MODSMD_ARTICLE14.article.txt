# Some scholarly advice
## 
### 
In the past live years, I've graduated four
times. I can't imagine what my family and
close friends must think when they (al
most) annually get a graduation announce
ment from me in the mail. At first 1 think
they felt proud that I graduated from col
lege, then proud that 1 got a master's degree
... and then maybe a little annoyed that I got
a second master's degree (from an even
cooler place than where I got the first one —
as if that was possible). And now that I'm
getting my third master's degree this year,
even 1 am starting to roll my eyes in annoy
ance. I keep asking my therapist, "for what
am I over-compensating?" to which she nat
urally replies, "absolutely nothing Adam!
You are perfect just as you are! Don't stop
learning!"
No. She doesn't say that. But sometimes
when I "play therapist" at home in front of
my bedroom mirror, I tell myself as much
(assuming I can still manage to talk to myself
behind the tears and sobbing).
On the surface, it probably appears that
I'm some sort of super-focused, well-organ
ized, enlightened brain child who knows
how to throw a curve, but not a baseball.The
truth is: I doubt that I've ever done either.
My body responds well to caffeine and re
quires surprisingly little sleep — both of
which help — but my intelligence isn't real
ly that remarkable (the three glaring typos
from last week's column should have given
me away long ago).
It might also appear that I'm prolonging
my student life in an effort to put off joining
the "real world."

Unfortunately, when I ride my bike to the
grocery store to buy single-serving portions
of Chef Boyardee Chili Cheese DogTWista
roni (microwavable, bowl included and on
sale) and then go back to my office for an all
night study session, I start to envy my friends
with cars, houses, stable relationships, steady
incomes and jobs that end at spm. I'm defi
nitely not doing this because the real world
looks worse.
No. There's really not much of an illusion
here. I'm a nerd. I've been in school all my
life simply because I love to learn.That does
n't make me intelligent, just barely above the
poverty line and malnourished, by choice.
While I have done it many more times
than most, I approach graduation again this
year with mixed feelings. Sure, there are the
immediate worries like finding a summer
job, unpaid bills, final exams and other un
certain variables. But what bothers me most
about graduation is the feeling that I've
learned "enough" to get a degree. Who, me?
Are you serious? From Stanford? Wait, an
other one now? This has got to be some sort
of joke. Pretty soon they will find out that
I'm a sham and a lonely poor loser, and then

they'll take my precious degree(s) away.
Right?
This is my last column of the year and I'm
not sure if IMI write one again in the Fall.
Again, 1 find myself with mixed feelings.
Have I said anything worthwhile? Couldn't 1
have taken the opportunity to say something
more important? Or couldn't 1 have taken a
little bit of extra time and made my articles
more interesting, more entertaining or
maybe more informative?
In truth. 1 know that I'll never be able to
see myself objectively. There's no way that I
can know what I look or sound like (1 don't
even like listening to my voice on my voice
mail). Inside, I see a scared little boy from
Montana just trying to learn a little about the
world around him, maybe meet a nice guy in
the process and hopefully find his way in the
natural order of life as an academic.
I'll graduate in another couple of years
with my Ph.D. and 1 doubt that I will really
change that much between now and then. I'll
jump through some hoops, go to some new
places and learn some new things (if I'm
lucky), but I'll still be me.
As this is my last column, 1 will leave you
with what little advice 1 have to offer. It is the
mantra that sustains me in times of mixed
feelings, uncertainties and general everyday
life:
Above all, avoid forgetfulness.
Thanks. Have a nice summer.
