Don't forget Dr. Jim Luvalle's
contributions
1 understand and agree with the desirabil
ity of having racial diversity in all divisions of
the University. That said, 1 believe that your
article ("Dearth of diversity in natural sci
ence faculty," May 26) missed an interesting
bit of African American history in Stanford's
Chemistry Department.
Dr. Jim Luvalle served a few years in Stan
ford's Chemistry Department as a director of
undergraduate laboratories. Luvalle's ac
complishments are well worth noting â€” a
post-doctoral fellow with two-time Nobel-
Pri/.e winner Linus Pauling along with a
bronze medal in the 4(M)-yard run at the 1936
Olympics in Berlin. Add in his many years at
a variety of corporate research centers
throughout the United States as a research
scientist and you have a history that is worth
a small footnote to accompany your story.
