## MURPHY'S LAW: CREW OUT OF NCAAs Coach Craig Amerkhanian refuses to race without star freshman; IRA maintains its ban, dictionary in hand 
### JOHN CHOCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A starboard gumboot wouldn't blush at the
bow ball on a coxless pair, but that's only be
cause the sport of rowing — like most things
born of the Ivy League — boasts quite a vo
cabulary. But while its lexicon names nearly
every part and piece of a boat, the rowing
world has no precise definition for a rather
simple but important word: freshman, the dis
puted meaning of which has prompted Stan
ford to withdraw its third-ranked varsity eight
from this week's national regatta.
Freshmen are not eligible to row in varsity
races at the Intercollegiate Rowing Associa
tion (IRA) Championships, whose rules are
those of its sponsor, the Eastern Collegiate
Athletic Conference.
The rule was invoked when the Cardinal
submitted a roster for this year's varsity crew
that included Mark Murphy, a first-year stu
dent who entered Stanford in sophomore
standing by merit of his high school Advanced
Placement coursework.

Stanford maintained that Murphy's aca
demic standing, as verified by the University
Provost, qualified Murphy for participation as
a member of the varsity eight.
The IRA disagreed,citing a Merriam-Web
ster definition of a freshman as a first-year col
lege student. Stanford unsuccessfully ap
pealed the decision, and Murphy consequent
ly will not be permitted to race with his varsity
boat.
Rather than reshuffle the crew, the Cardi
nal men will not enter a varsity eight at this
year's championship.
"We're not going to enter an eight unless
we have our eight, the Stanford eight," head
coach Craig Amerkhanian said. "We have a
boat that's earned the right to race because it's
won tremendous races this year. I'm not going
to break that boat down."
Stanford's varsity eight, with Murphy on
board, went undefeated in both the Winder
mere Regatta and the San Diego Crew Clas
sic earlier this season in March and April.
Ihe Cardinal's absence from the IRA
regatta, where they would have vied
for the national title, won't go unno
ticed.
"It's only a national championship if
everyone shows up." Amerkhanian
said. "[The IRA] has hurt collegiate
rowing in 2(KXS by doing this to Stan
ford."
llie freshman rule was created in
2003 and, according to Amerkhanian,
was intended for "20-year-old fresh
men — not people like Mark Murphy,
an 18-year-old who's never rowed be

fore and happens to he really smart."
Women's openweight coach Aimee
Baker agreed.
"There is no other collegiate sport
that I am aware of that keeps first-year
collegiate athletes from competing at
the highest level," she said."Four years
of collegiate eligibility is a very small
window in an athlete's career, and to
limit this further is unfair to the ath
lete."
No league but the ECAC prevents
freshmen from rowing in varsity boats,
and Amerkhanian thinks the rules for
the national regatta should reflect the
majority.
"(The IRA] is protecting a regional
invitational that clings to [the ECAC's]
own rules and interpretation," he said.
"Our sport is regionally driven by this

East Coast scene,and all they've done is
put the men's sport on life support. We
need to expand, we need more oppor
tunities."
The one benefit of the Cardinal's
withdrawal. Amerkhanian admitted,
will go to the "Stanford of the East."
"We're hoping our academic con
temporaries from [No. 4] Harvard
might get a medal now," Amerkhanian
joked.
The Cardinal men will still partici
pate in the IRA regatta this weekend
in four-man boats rowed only by un
derclassmen. The team will reassem
ble for the Henley Royal Regatta this
summer, June 28-July 3in Henley-on-
Thames, U.K., where all athletes will
be eligible to compete at the varsity
level.
