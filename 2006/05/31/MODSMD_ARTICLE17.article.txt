## MURPHY'S LAW: CREW OUT OF NCAAs Coach Craig Amerkhanian refuses to race without star freshman; IRA maintains its ban, dictionary in hand 
### JOHN CHOCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A starboard gumboot wouldn't blush at the
bow ball on a coxless pair, but that's only be
cause the sport of rowing — like most things
born of the Ivy League — boasts quite a vo
cabulary. But while its lexicon names nearly
every part and piece of a boat, the rowing
world has no precise definition for a rather
simple but important word: freshman, the dis
puted meaning of which has prompted Stan
ford to withdraw its third-ranked varsity eight
from this week's national regatta.
Freshmen are not eligible to row in varsity
races at the Intercollegiate Rowing Associa
tion (IRA) Championships, whose rules are
those of its sponsor, the Eastern Collegiate
Athletic Conference.
The rule was invoked when the Cardinal
submitted a roster for this year's varsity crew
that included Mark Murphy, a first-year stu
dent who entered Stanford in sophomore
standing by merit of his high school Advanced
Placement coursework.

Stanford maintained that Murphy's aca
demic standing, as verified by the University
Provost, qualified Murphy for participation as
a member of the varsity eight.
The IRA disagreed,citing a Merriam-Web
ster definition of a freshman as a first-year col
lege student. Stanford unsuccessfully ap
pealed the decision, and Murphy consequent
ly will not be permitted to race with his varsity
boat.
Rather than reshuffle the crew, the Cardi
nal men will not enter a varsity eight at this
year's championship.
"We're not going to enter an eight unless
we have our eight, the Stanford eight," head
coach Craig Amerkhanian said. "We have a
boat that's earned the right to race because it's
won tremendous races this year. I'm not going
to break that boat down."
Stanford's varsity eight, with Murphy on
board, went undefeated in both the Winder
mere Regatta and the San Diego Crew Clas
sic earlier this season in March and April.
