### BY CARSON COOPER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's golf team trav
eled to Columbus, Ohio, looking to match
the success of their tennis and cross-country
counterparts, who brought home Champi
onship trophies. Unfortunately, the team
was unable to overcome a talented field in
the effort to win their first team champi
onship.
The Cardinal placed 13th in the four-day
tournament, shooting a combined 57-over
par 1,209 (307,301,295,306) to tie with Ten
nessee. The Ohio State Scarlet Course in
Columbus saw 24 teams do battle in the last
collegiate tournament of the season. Stan
ford improved upon their 19th place finish
in the 2005 Championships. The Card's last
top-ten finish was in 2001, when the team
came in ninth overall.
"All in all, it was a pretty good week,"
head coach Caroline O'Connor said. "We

certainly would have liked to have finished
much stronger. The conditions today, other
than a few strong squalls, were perfect for
scoring. With the rain last night and this af
ternoon, the greens were much more recep
tive and the winds weren't quite as gusty.
But we played very well in rounds round
and two and I was happy that we were in a
position coming into today to finish well."
Duke met heavy expectations in the
tournament, winning their second consecu
tive team championship with a 15-over par
1,167. The victory was the Duke women's
fourth overall team title.
Rounding out the top five were South
ern California (1.177), Pepperdine (1,187),
Arizona State (1,195) and California
(1200). Other Pac-10 teams in the tourna
ment included sixth place Washington and
eleventh-place UCLA.

Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana was
the top finisher for Stanford, firing an
eight-over 2%, good for a 16th place
tie. However, the tournament ended
in disappointment for the junior.
After the third round, Tangtiphai
boontana was in the running for the
individual title, just three strokes off
the lead, but a final round 79 dropped
her out of contention.
"Jenni played great this week,"
said O'Connor."This course was very
demanding from tee to green and she
managed herself around the course
perfectly. She didn't have a good ball
striking day today and unfortunately

none of her putts were dropping, but
that's golf. I'm very proud of her play
this week."
Freshman Mari Chun had an im
pressive Championship debut, finish
ing in 27th after recording a 298. Also
competing for the Cardinal were jun
ior Lauren Todd, who took 75th with
a 308, and senior Kelly Husted. who
carded a 315, good for a 98th place
tie. Freshman Ki Shui Liao also shot
a 315 to tie with Husted in her inau
gural Championship appearance.

good news over the weekend with
the announcement of the Pac-10 All-
Academic Team. Husted made the
first-team, while Tangtiphaiboontana
and senior Stephanie Lue were
placed on the second-team.
