## Runners split crown with USC Bayne breaks Gaines' 100-meter mark, McLain shatters Regional record in triple

Not many people have heard of Provo, Utah, lo
cated about 50 miles south of Salt Lake City.
But Provo was a big spot on the map this past

weekend, as the city played host to the
2006 NCAA West Regional.

The regional qualifying sys
tem, in only its fourth year of exis
tence. determines who competes in
the NCAA national meet. There are
four regional meets — the East,
Mideast, Midwest and West —
• and the top five finishers for
each race from each division gain

berths to compete at the national
meet. The multi-events and the 10,000 meters are the ex
ceptions, with athletes qualifying by meeting automatic
and provisional standards.
Last season the women's team sent more than 20 ath
letes to the regional meet and came back with a team title.
This season, the team sent just 20, but still returned with
the title, tying for first with USC at 94 points apiece.
Redshirt sophomore Chauntae Bayne ran the only way
she knows how: in record-breaking fashion. After break
ing several indoor records earlier this season, Bayne
brought her talents to the outdoor track and continues to
do the same. After some health concerns prompted the
Bayne to take a short break from the 100 and 200 meters,
the sophomore wasted no time re-establishing herself as
Stanford's premier sprinter.
Competing at the Clarence Robinson Track, Bayne
broke Stanford's 14-year-old 1 (X) meter record by running
in 11.15 seconds — knocking off .01 seconds from the pre
vious record.
The record had belonged to Chryste Gaines, a graduate
of the 1992 class. In that year. Gaines won the NCAA title
and later won a gold medal as part of the 400 meter relay
team in the 1996 Olympics. Her talents extended past the
100 meters as well, as she also owned the school's 200
meter record with a time of 23 seconds flat.
After she broke the 400-meter record the week before,
only the 200 meter record remained beyond Bayne's pos-
