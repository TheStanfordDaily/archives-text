Every year, Stanford students warily approach the
housing Draw and its unsavory combination of potential
conflict with roommates and looming uncertainty over
numbers and assignments.
But this year, even the typically apprehensive student
body got more than it bargained for. Drastic and largely
unpredictable shifts in housing cutoffs left many surprised
by their assignments.
But those were the lucky ones. The most in four years
— 104 students — did not receive an assignment and now
must wait for bed spaces to open up this July — or the first
week of school.
Perhaps most important to students campus-wide was
the sudden shift in dorm Draw cutoffs. With little warning,
Roble, Lagunita Court's Grenada and Stern Hall's Casa
Zapata and Serra ranked among Stanford's most popular
houses. Meanwhile,Toyon — usually one of the preferred
locations for rising sophomores — became one of the

least desired houses in the system.
To compensate for the noise and inconvenience of con
struction on the nearby Munger Graduate Residences.
Housing officials converted all upperclass doubles in Casa
Zapata and Serra — traditionally two of the least exclu
sive houses — into singles.
Looking at the numbers, the gambit paid off. Presum
ably lured by the singles, Zapata filled up nearly entirely
with priority applicants, while Serra cut off at 404 for
males and 970 for females. Serra cut off over 2.900 in 2005,
while nearly any student could have lived in Zapata this
year.
Under the current system, in place since 1993. under
graduates receive two preferred and one guaranteed year
of housing with numbers 1 through 2,000 and 2,001
through 3,000. Students with no guaranteed housing years
left often apply unpreferred and receive a number be
tween 3,001 to 3,500.
"I'm excited the people who are living in Serra are ex
cited to be there," said sophomore Gene Lowry, a Serra
resident assistant next year. "It should set a positive tone
for the beginning of the year."
At Roble, the upcoming third and final summer of the
Capital Improvement Project helped lower the Draw


RYAN NOON/The Stanford Daily
cutoff from over 1,500 to 820 for fe
males and from 1,060 to 791 for
males. Like in Serra and Grenada,
many students were shocked when
their numbers proved too high for
these new cuts.
"I got an 847," said sophomore
Jeffrey Sefa-Boakye. "Who doesn't
get into Roble with an 847?"
Director of Housing Assignments
Sue Nunan expected Roble's popu
larity to shoot up due to renovations.
The dorm will be shut down this sum
mer for construction, which will in
clude upgrades to rooms, bathrooms,
the lounge and theater.
"I think every year, wherever
there's a change with the CIP proj
ect, that house draws more popular
ly, so 1 don't know this is a big change
from other years," Nunan said.
The picture is not so bright at
Toyon. The increased attractiveness
of other dorms, a chat list publicized
stomach flu dubbed the "Toyonic
Plague" that received front page
Daily coverage and spread like wild
fire across campus email lists, the res
ignation of Resident Fellow Gian
carlo Aquilanti and standard year
to-year fluctuation conspired to push
the dorm to cutoffs of 2,048 for males
and 2,899 for females, about double
its usual.
Toyon avoided another potential
factor that could have reduced appli
cations, as the two recent on-campus
armed robberies that occurred with
in a block of the dorm came just days
after student preferences were due.
"It's a little disappointing, but I
think it's because of [places like]
Serra," said junior Nicole Doheny, a
Toyon RA this year and next. "Hon
estly, lots of people try to game the
draw. I've talked to a lot of sopho
mores who would have loved to live
in Toyon, but didn't bother listing it
as one of their eight [choices] be
cause they didn't think they'd get in.
But in actuality, they had a 1,7(X) or
an 1,800 and they could have. The
Draw's a mystery."
Whatever the reason, so few stu
dents ranked Toyon as a preference
that many who did not list the dorm
at all still ended up assigned there.
"It's pretty close to campus and
it's got good rooms," said rising jun

ior Elizabeth Joyce, who will live
with four classmates in the sopho
more-priority dorm next year. "So 1
don't mind, I'm mostly just con
fused."
Confusion abounds for the 104
students with no housing assignment
at all. With construction closing Du
rand and parts of two wings of Roble
for fall quarter, and the shift in Casa
Zapata and Serra from doubles to
singles, housing ran 58 beds short for
the nearly 4,(XK) students who ap
plied guaranteed.
Nunan assured The Daily that
every student who has applied for
guaranteed housing in the current
system's 12 years of operation has re
ceived it, and stressed that this year
will be no different.
"I don't think there will be any
problem meeting demand," Nunan
said. "They've all been guaranteed
housing and housing will be avail
able for them."
Still, the wait raises not only anxi

ety, but also practical concerns in
terms of roommate assignments and
summer storage.
Consider sophomore Aubrey
Munoz, whose four-person group
drew a 2,993. After missing cutoffs in
Potter, Narnia and all of Florence
Moore Hall. Munoz is now signing
up for the waitlist and will hear back
in either July or the first week of
school. But between the long odds of
four slots opening in the same house
and her group's study abroad plans,
Munoz knows she may well end up
separated from her closest friends
next year.
"We got kind of worried when
looking at cutoff numbers from last
year and none were as high as ours,
but we figured that we'd get assigned
and that [being waitlisted] only hap
pened to other people," Munoz said.
"Even though, after this, I will be
grateful for wherever we end up, 1
still feel like housing owes us senior
year. Big time."

graduates receive two preferred and one guaranteed year

left often apply unpreferred and receive a number be

"I'm excited the people who are living in Serra are ex

cutoff from over 1,500 to 820 for fe
males and from 1,060 to 791 for
males. Like in Serra and Grenada,
many students were shocked when
their numbers proved too high for
these new cuts.
"I got an 847," said sophomore
Jeffrey Sefa-Boakye. "Who doesn't
get into Roble with an 847?"
Director of Housing Assignments
Sue Nunan expected Roble's popu

The dorm will be shut down this sum

clude upgrades to rooms, bathrooms,
the lounge and theater.
"I think every year, wherever
there's a change with the CIP proj
ect, that house draws more popular
ly, so 1 don't know this is a big change
from other years," Nunan said.
The picture is not so bright at
Toyon. The increased attractiveness
of other dorms, a chat list publicized
stomach flu dubbed the "Toyonic
Plague" that received front page
Daily coverage and spread like wild
fire across campus email lists, the res
ignation of Resident Fellow Gian

the dorm to cutoffs of 2,048 for males
and 2,899 for females, about double
its usual.
Toyon avoided another potential
factor that could have reduced appli
cations, as the two recent on-campus
armed robberies that occurred with
in a block of the dorm came just days
after student preferences were due.
"It's a little disappointing, but I
think it's because of [places like]
Serra," said junior Nicole Doheny, a
Toyon RA this year and next. "Hon
estly, lots of people try to game the
draw. I've talked to a lot of sopho
mores who would have loved to live
in Toyon, but didn't bother listing it
as one of their eight [choices] be
cause they didn't think they'd get in.
But in actuality, they had a 1,7(X) or
an 1,800 and they could have. The
Draw's a mystery."
Whatever the reason, so few stu
dents ranked Toyon as a preference
that many who did not list the dorm
at all still ended up assigned there.
"It's pretty close to campus and
it's got good rooms," said rising jun

ior Elizabeth Joyce, who will live
with four classmates in the sopho
more-priority dorm next year. "So 1
don't mind, I'm mostly just con
fused."
Confusion abounds for the 104
students with no housing assignment
at all. With construction closing Du
rand and parts of two wings of Roble
for fall quarter, and the shift in Casa
Zapata and Serra from doubles to
singles, housing ran 58 beds short for
the nearly 4,(XK) students who ap
plied guaranteed.
Nunan assured The Daily that
every student who has applied for
guaranteed housing in the current
system's 12 years of operation has re
ceived it, and stressed that this year
will be no different.
"I don't think there will be any
problem meeting demand," Nunan
said. "They've all been guaranteed
housing and housing will be avail
able for them."
Still, the wait raises not only anxi

ety, but also practical concerns in
terms of roommate assignments and
summer storage.
Consider sophomore Aubrey
Munoz, whose four-person group
drew a 2,993. After missing cutoffs in
Potter, Narnia and all of Florence
Moore Hall. Munoz is now signing
up for the waitlist and will hear back
in either July or the first week of
school. But between the long odds of
four slots opening in the same house
and her group's study abroad plans,
Munoz knows she may well end up
separated from her closest friends
next year.
"We got kind of worried when
looking at cutoff numbers from last
year and none were as high as ours,
but we figured that we'd get assigned
and that [being waitlisted] only hap
pened to other people," Munoz said.
"Even though, after this, I will be
grateful for wherever we end up, 1
still feel like housing owes us senior
year. Big time."

Every year, Stanford students warily approach the
housing Draw and its unsavory combination of potential
conflict with roommates and looming uncertainty over
numbers and assignments.
But this year, even the typically apprehensive student
body got more than it bargained for. Drastic and largely
unpredictable shifts in housing cutoffs left many surprised
by their assignments.
But those were the lucky ones. The most in four years
— 104 students — did not receive an assignment and now
must wait for bed spaces to open up this July — or the first
week of school.
Perhaps most important to students campus-wide was
the sudden shift in dorm Draw cutoffs. With little warning,
Roble, Lagunita Court's Grenada and Stern Hall's Casa
Zapata and Serra ranked among Stanford's most popular
houses. Meanwhile,Toyon — usually one of the preferred
locations for rising sophomores — became one of the

least desired houses in the system.
To compensate for the noise and inconvenience of con
struction on the nearby Munger Graduate Residences.
Housing officials converted all upperclass doubles in Casa
Zapata and Serra — traditionally two of the least exclu
sive houses — into singles.
Looking at the numbers, the gambit paid off. Presum
ably lured by the singles, Zapata filled up nearly entirely
with priority applicants, while Serra cut off at 404 for
males and 970 for females. Serra cut off over 2.900 in 2005,
while nearly any student could have lived in Zapata this
year.
Under the current system, in place since 1993. under
graduates receive two preferred and one guaranteed year
of housing with numbers 1 through 2,000 and 2,001
through 3,000. Students with no guaranteed housing years
left often apply unpreferred and receive a number be
tween 3,001 to 3,500.
