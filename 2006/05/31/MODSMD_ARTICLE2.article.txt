Every year, Stanford students warily approach the
housing Draw and its unsavory combination of potential
conflict with roommates and looming uncertainty over
numbers and assignments.
But this year, even the typically apprehensive student
body got more than it bargained for. Drastic and largely
unpredictable shifts in housing cutoffs left many surprised
by their assignments.
But those were the lucky ones. The most in four years
— 104 students — did not receive an assignment and now
must wait for bed spaces to open up this July — or the first
week of school.
Perhaps most important to students campus-wide was
the sudden shift in dorm Draw cutoffs. With little warning,
Roble, Lagunita Court's Grenada and Stern Hall's Casa
Zapata and Serra ranked among Stanford's most popular
houses. Meanwhile,Toyon — usually one of the preferred
locations for rising sophomores — became one of the

least desired houses in the system.
To compensate for the noise and inconvenience of con
struction on the nearby Munger Graduate Residences.
Housing officials converted all upperclass doubles in Casa
Zapata and Serra — traditionally two of the least exclu
sive houses — into singles.
Looking at the numbers, the gambit paid off. Presum
ably lured by the singles, Zapata filled up nearly entirely
with priority applicants, while Serra cut off at 404 for
males and 970 for females. Serra cut off over 2.900 in 2005,
while nearly any student could have lived in Zapata this
year.
Under the current system, in place since 1993. under
graduates receive two preferred and one guaranteed year
of housing with numbers 1 through 2,000 and 2,001
through 3,000. Students with no guaranteed housing years
left often apply unpreferred and receive a number be
tween 3,001 to 3,500.
"I'm excited the people who are living in Serra are ex
cited to be there," said sophomore Gene Lowry, a Serra
resident assistant next year. "It should set a positive tone
for the beginning of the year."
At Roble, the upcoming third and final summer of the
Capital Improvement Project helped lower the Draw
