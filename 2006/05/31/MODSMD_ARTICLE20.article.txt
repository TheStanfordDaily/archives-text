# Small station, big dreams
## It was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life, being part of a championship run. AARON LEVINE, broadcaster 
### SAMUEL CHEN STAFF WRITER 
A "love for sports and a passion for broad
casting" were all Aaron Levine,Class of 2004,
needed to make being a sports broadcaster a
defining experience during his tenure at
Stanford. The 20 sportscasters that followed
in his footsteps and made up the KZSU
Sports team during this school year seem to
wholeheartedly agree.
It's not a sports station, but the student
run KZSU 90.1 FM takes it upon itself to
broadcast more Stanford sports than any
other frequency on your radio dial. This fea
ture of the primarily music-oriented, com
mercial-free radio station is likely one of the
most underpublicized and underutilized
sports media on campus.
"We're broadcasters, not marketers," said
KZSU Sports Director Christopher Ander
son. who is currently a second-year graduate
student in the Electrical Engineering De
partment.

These broadcasters band together to
cover five of the largest sports on campus on
the air during the year: women's volleyball,
football, men's and women's basketball and
baseball.
Additionally, men's and women's soccer
and Softball matches are broadcast on the In
ternet for their home-games.
Despite the broadcasters' enthusiasm,
covering all these sports is still not always an
easy task.
"For every game that is on the air, some
one has to be at the studio on the engineering
side," said Anderson. "This broadcast engi
neering is not sexy work, but it has to get
done, and part of the way broadcasters earn
their spots is by engineering their fellow
broadcasters' games."
Still, as a result of their work, KZSU
sportscasters enjoy close relationships with
the teams they are covering that not many
others have an opportunity to have.
This year, student broadcasters traveled
with the football, women's basketball and

baseball teams.
During postseason play, even more op
portunities arose to travel for high-stakes
matchups. For example, freshman Jake Kel
man went all the way to the Elite Eight with
the women's basketball team this year, while
junior Alex Gyr will be heading to Austin.
Tex., later this week to cover the baseball
team's NCAA Regional action.
"It was one of the most rewarding experi
ences of my life, traveling with the team all
over the country and being part of a champi
onship run in 2001 and a Final Four appear
ance in 2002," Levine said of his three years
broadcasting for the women's volleyball
team. "The coaching staff and players all
made me feel like 1 was a part of the team."
Following the successes at the college stu
dent-broadcasting level, a number of KZSU
alums have used their experience to spring
board professional lives in broadcast media.
Just a few of the list of distinguished alumni
include Levine, now a sports anchor
and reporter at the CBS and FOX
affiliate in Bakersfield, Calif., San
Francisco Giants broadcaster Dave
I leming, KNEW 910's Cardinal bas

ketball commentator John Platz,
Yahoo Sports' Jeremy Stone, ESPN
Radio's Troy Clardy and ESPN
sports anchor Scott Reiss.
"[Not having a broadcasting
major at Stanford] may in fact give
our broadcasters an advantage in
the professional ranks." noted An
derson. "By majoring in any other
subject, they become well-rounded
with a diverse array of knowledge."

While there is no journalistic
program of study on the Farm, some
of the most passionate voices on
Stanford sports have turned to
KZSU to hone their skills and have
fun doing it.
"Like any other extracurricular
activity, [working at KZSU] was a
very time-consuming venture,"
Levine. "But the rewards of the job
far outweighed anything else."
