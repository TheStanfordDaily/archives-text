## Card finish all-time best 11th at NCAAs Varsity eights take 13th and 9th, Cat takes NCAA crown 
### JOHN CHOCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's openweight women wrapped
up their season with an 11 th-place finish at
the NCAA regatta, held this past weekend in
West Windsor, N.J. The Cardinal women
qualified for the Petite Finals in each of the
three varsity events, finishing 13th in the first
varsity eight, and ninth in the second varsity
eight and the varsity four.

The ninth-place finish was the highest of
any Stanford four-woman crew in the Card's
three NCAA appearances. And along with
the Petite bronze performance by the second
varsity, it was also the first time either crew
had defeated Yale.
The Bulldogs and the Cardinal both fin
ished the regatta with 21 points; but the tie
breaker went to Yale for their higher finish in
the first varsity race.
The grueling format of NCAA racing, with
elimination heats and the repechage in close
succession, took its toll on Stanford's first var
sity, which has struggled with injuries
throughout the season. In Friday's opening

heats, the Card trailed Notre Dame and
Washington by only three seconds. But by the
Sunday final, that margin had opened to 14
seconds.
Defending champion California won the
team trophy, and co-host Princeton won the
coveted varsity eight title.
Stanford's pair of alternates won an exhi
bition heat against alternates from other
teams, showcasing the Cardinal's depth by
finishing, unofficially, in third place among
"spare pairs."
"(It was an] overall good season, a great
opportunity and great experience
for the 20 returning rowers," head
coach Aimee Baker said.
Stanford's lightweight women
will race in the IRA national regatta
this weekend in Cherry Hill, N.J.
Going into the championships, the
lightweight Card sit on the cusp of
the Grand Final â€” in a tie with
Bucknell for the sixth spot.
"In order for us to make the
Grand Final and earn a top-six rank
ing, we will need to be at our best for
the whole 2.(HK) meters," lightweight
head coach Al Acosta said.
Acosta expressed optimism
about his team's chances.
" Ihe practices have been going
well, and the team is feeling good,"
he said. "We're looking forward to
putting together our best race of the
year. All of the top 12 teams in the
country will be there, so it should
make for some close and exciting
racing."
