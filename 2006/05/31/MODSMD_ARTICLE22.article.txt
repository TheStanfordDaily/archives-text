## SUPER JUST THAT AS KAYAKING TAKES SECOND PLACE 
### ANDREW LOMELI STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford canoe and kayaking club team
placed second behind Georgia Tech at the Colle
giate National Championships in Chula Vista,
Calif, this past weekend.
The Cardinal competed in nine different
types of events, divided by gender, distance and
number of teammates on a boat. Points were
awarded for each team's boat placing in each
race's top five.
Freshman James Super won the 200,5(X) and
100-meter races en route to winning the tour
ney's top male individual honors. Sophomore
Alex Hegyi nabbed first in the 2(X)-meter novice
race. Sophomore Chris Chapman took second in
the 2(X)-meter race.
The Cardinal's women's novice team was
named the top female novice squad at the tour
nament. Alex Martin and Becca Loew won the
200. S(H) and 100-meter dashes. Freshman Jesse
Bertke won the 200 and 500-meter female
novice races.
"Each race was unbelievably close," sopho
more Becca Pass said. "The 500-meter was neck
to-neck the entire way and ended up coming
down to an inch. Digital video footage was used
to decide nearly every event."
The Stanford team began competing at the
2002 tournament and has won first place each
year until now. After four years of existing as a
private club, the squad was finally recognized as
a Stanford club team about two weeks before the
championships.
"It was tough to be accepted as a club team at
first since there really wasn't much interest,"
Pass said. "But we hope this will help provide us
with funds that can be used for uniforms, travel
training, and other competitions in Canada,
Spain. Mexico and other colleges that we could
n't attend because of a small budget."
