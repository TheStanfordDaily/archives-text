## Study shows first job, salary matters 
### CASSIE HARVEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As seniors prepare to graduate in only a few weeks, many have
set their sights on the job market. A new Graduate School of Busi
ness (GSB) study concludes that job prospects and early salaries
for business-school students depend on stock market conditions
at the time of their graduation. The study, published by GSB Eco
nomics Prof Paul Oyer,found these differences in salary also tend
to persist over time.

The new research adds to a growing body of
evidence that points to early career success —
and a certain degree of luck — as indicators of
future financial performance. The study ana
lyzes the interplay between market conditions,
initial job placement and long-term wage pro
jections. To collect this data. Oyer tracked Stan
ford GSB graduates each year from 1960 to
1997.
Oyer noticed that students who left the Uni
versity with a master's in business administra-

tion in 1988 and 1989 fared far worse in initial job placement and
made much less in lifetime earnings than students with compara
ble skills who graduated in later years.The reason for this wage dif
ferential,he concluded, was stock market conditions at the time of
graduation.The crash in the fall of 1987 made it very difficult for
graduates at that time to start their careers in the financial sector
because investment firms were laying off workers.
With Wall Street was not hiring, graduates were forced to take
jobs elsewhere for less, driving down the average graduating class
salary. Even when conditions improved and jobs opened up, the
1988 and 1989 alumni did not fill them. Instead, newly-graduated
MBAs were hired.
Oyer's study also found that this wage gap did not close over
time. Members of the classes of 1988 and 1989 who started out
making less money, for example, still trailed their later-graduating
peers nearly two decades later.
Oyer said he was surprised that these wage differences did not
self-correct over time. Instead, the results showed that graduates'
first jobs and starting salaries had an inordinate impact on their
later income stream.
"Given the transferability of MBA skills, it seems likely that
any effect of stock returns on MBA placement would be short
lived," he wrote in his paper.
"That is not to say they cannot catch up," Oyer clarified in an
email to The Daily. "But it's tough. Graduating in a recession is a
handicap. Much of the effects are in terms of what fields they work
in and some is financial."
GSB students expressed mixed reactions to the study's find
ings.
Marquis Parker, a second-year student familiar with Oyer's
study, said he was initially surprised by the results. After thinking
more carefully, Parker said the findings made sense.
"You come out of school and accept that first job," he said.
"And that job sets you up for the rest of your career."
Parker said the data resonated with him personally.
"After college, I took a job as a software engineer," he said. "I
worked there for five years. It was a really great job. But the thing
is you get stuck on this track. You develop certain skill sets in an
industry, and the longer you stay there, the harder it makes it to
switch fields. That's why I decided to come to business school. I
knew I wanted to do something different in the long run and I
knew the sooner I switched, the better. I wanted to learn new skill
sets while the market was still strong and break through that ceil
ing."
He sympathized with his friends who graduated during the
most recent economic recession.

"You hear stories about graduates
who came out in 2001 and 2002 and it's
kind of depressing to spend those two
years in business school only to find
your prospects were limited by eco
nomic conditions," he said. "It's great
to be graduating at this time."
Other students said they thought
the study's findings were counterintu
itive.
Stacy Duda, a second-year busi
ness school student, said she believed
in upward mobility within businesses.
"It seems to me, if you are doing a
good job, you should be able to work

your way upshe said.
But Kai Brown, a first-year busi
ness student,said she was not at all sur
prised by the study's conclusion. She
said she understood how much mar
ket conditions affect a graduate's
prospects and that she planned her
time at business school to coincide
with strong market conditions.
"1 could have come to business
school in 2002," Brown said. "But my
dad advised me to wait. It was an elec
tion year [in 2(X)4] and my dad thought
a change in the presidency could have
a destabilizing effect on the economy.
He said I should wait until after the
election. I'm glad 1 took his advice."
The Class of 2006 may be able to
take solace in new estimates that the
economy will grow by more than three
percent this year.
