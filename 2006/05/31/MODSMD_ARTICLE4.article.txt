# JESUS NEVER LIVED, SPEAKER SAYS
## STUDENT GROUP BRINGS RELIGIOUS SCHOLAR TO CAMPUS 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
Questions about Jesus and his
life have dominated popular culture
in recent weeks with the premiere of
"The Da Vinci Code" film, based on
the novel that alleges Christ had a
child. In this climate of religious di
alogue, Richard Carrier, a graduate
student in ancient history at Colum
bia University, told members of the
student group Rational Thought
that Jesus never existed in a speech
last night at the Math Building.
The highly-controversial speech
stood in contrast to accepted Christ
ian theology and religious-academic
thought. Most scholars accept that
there was a historical Jesus, who is the

basis of the Christian religion, though
he may or may not have exhibited
any special abilities.
But a small number of academics,
including Carrier, argue that there
was never even a historical Jesus.
They believe that the biblical apostle
Paul founded Christianity, and in his
conception, Jesus was an incorporeal,
allegorical figure. Later, they say,
Christians came to believe that Jesus
was an actual person and added vari
ous biographical details.
As evidence of his claim. Carrier
pointed to Paul's epistles, which are
the oldest books in the New Testa
ment.
"Paul never discusses Jesus' fami
ly, his deeds, where he went or where
he came from," Carrier said. "He

never discusses any of his confronta
tions with the authorities, nor any dis
putes about what he taught. He says
Jesus became flesh, was crucified and
buried, but he never says when or
where or positions these events in
any historical context."
According to Carrier, this omis
sion only makes sense if Jesus was
originally understood to be a fiction
al, heavenly figure. Carrier described
the process by which he believes
Jesus came to be seen as a historical
person.
"Jesus was originally perceived as
a heavenly being whose death and
reincarnation took place in heaven
and was made known secretly in the
