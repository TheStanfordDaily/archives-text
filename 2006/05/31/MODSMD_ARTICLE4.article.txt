# JESUS NEVER LIVED, SPEAKER SAYS
## STUDENT GROUP BRINGS RELIGIOUS SCHOLAR TO CAMPUS 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
Questions about Jesus and his
life have dominated popular culture
in recent weeks with the premiere of
"The Da Vinci Code" film, based on
the novel that alleges Christ had a
child. In this climate of religious di
alogue, Richard Carrier, a graduate
student in ancient history at Colum
bia University, told members of the
student group Rational Thought
that Jesus never existed in a speech
last night at the Math Building.
The highly-controversial speech
stood in contrast to accepted Christ
ian theology and religious-academic
thought. Most scholars accept that
there was a historical Jesus, who is the

basis of the Christian religion, though
he may or may not have exhibited
any special abilities.
But a small number of academics,
including Carrier, argue that there
was never even a historical Jesus.
They believe that the biblical apostle
Paul founded Christianity, and in his
conception, Jesus was an incorporeal,
allegorical figure. Later, they say,
Christians came to believe that Jesus
was an actual person and added vari
ous biographical details.
As evidence of his claim. Carrier
pointed to Paul's epistles, which are
the oldest books in the New Testa
ment.
"Paul never discusses Jesus' fami
ly, his deeds, where he went or where
he came from," Carrier said. "He

never discusses any of his confronta
tions with the authorities, nor any dis
putes about what he taught. He says
Jesus became flesh, was crucified and
buried, but he never says when or
where or positions these events in
any historical context."
According to Carrier, this omis
sion only makes sense if Jesus was
originally understood to be a fiction
al, heavenly figure. Carrier described
the process by which he believes
Jesus came to be seen as a historical
person.
"Jesus was originally perceived as
a heavenly being whose death and
reincarnation took place in heaven
and was made known secretly in the

Old Testament," he said. "And in the
early first century this secret was
communicated by revelation to Paul,
who preached widely. This message
about Jesus was then mythified, just
as other mystery cults had done with
their gods.
"By the end of the first century,"
Carrier continued, "some Christians
had come to believe that the myths
were real and assumed that Jesus was
a real person. This sect of Christians
eventually gained the political ad
vantage and became what we know
as orthodox Christianity, which only
preserved texts that agreed with their
interpretation and sometimes even
forged or altered texts to advance
their views."
Carrier said that the Gospel of
Mark was written nearly 60 years
after the purported death of Jesus,
and that the other three Gospels bor
rowed heavily from this book. The
version of Jesus' life given in the
Gospel contains many elements that

are usually found in the lives of myth
ical figures, he said.
"Jesus conforms so closely to the
criterion of a mythic hero the proba
bility that he was a mythic hero in
creases substantially," he said. "There
are 22 features that have been identi
fied by scholars that are commonly
shared by many mythic heroes. They
can be ranked with a score according
to how many features they have.
Jesus clearly scores at least 19 out of
22."
According to Carrier, Jesus shares
many of the following mythic traits,
including a virgin birth and divine lin
eage. An attempt is made to kill him
when he is a baby. He is spirited away
from those plotting his murder. He is
reared in a foreign country. He is
crowned king. He reigns over a peri
od of peace. He prescribes laws. He
then loses favor with the gods or his
subjects. He meets with a mysterious
death. He dies at the top of a hill. His
body turns up missing.
Jesus scores higher on this scale
than almost all other heroes, includ
ing Hercules and Romulus, Carrier
said. Only Oedipus scores higher.
"Jesus competes for second place
only with Theseus and Moses," he
said. "Everyone who scores more
than 11 on this scale is most likely
mythical. No historical figures who
accumulated some of these features
by chance or legend, such as Alexan
der the Great or Augustus Caesar,
scores even as high as 11."
Carrier pointed out that, in the an
cient world, mythological figures
often underwent the process of "his
toricization."
"This had actually become a
trend," Carrier said. "It is called 'Eu
hemerisation.' Euhemerus wrote a
work of fiction called the Sacred
Scriptures in which he showed an
imaginary scholar who had found out
that Zeus and Uranus were real his
torical kings.
"Aesop was probably never a real
person nor are any of the biographies
about him likely to be genuine," Car
rier continued. "Instead, Aesop was
most likely invented in order to as
sign a name to a growing collection of
fables passed down from numerous
oral sources.
"Historical facts were then in
vented about this Aesop and then
many detailed biographies were writ

ten that are similar in many ways to
the gospels." Carrier added. "Like
Jesus, Aesop was renowned as a chal
lenger to power. He came from a
lowly background,yet was renowned
as a cultural hero. And he was regard
ed as a martyr; he was executed by
the priests of Delphi for denouncing
their greed."
Despite this evidence. Carrier was
quick to point out that this is just a
theory.
"We need to go out and interact
with the community and see if it
stands up to the evidence," he said.
"I'm not here declaring that this is
absolutely true and it would be fool
ish to deny it. We're not at that stage
yet.
"The normal procedure is to as
sume that a person who is claimed
to be historical is historical." he
continued."unless there is a reason
to doubt it. I believe this is an ap
propriate principle. For example,
merely lacking evidence is not
enough of an argument for some
one not existing historically. You
need actual evidence for them
being mythified."
Martin Mueller, a fifth-year grad
uate student in physics, organized
the talk as the head of Rational
Thought.
"When I first came here to Stan
ford." Mueller said,"! was surprised
that there wasn't a student group
specifically for students who are sec
ular, for students who do not sub
scribe to any religious beliefs. This is
a forum for those sorts of issues.
"In the general population, the
word atheist has a bad ring to it."he
added. "But we just use it for what it
means. We do not believe in a god.
The people that are attracted to our
kinds of activities are the people who
do not believe, based on the evi
dence, that there is a God."
Talks like Carrier's help Mueller
and the members of Rational
Thought formulate their beliefs, he
said.
"It is very important for us, as it is
for everybody," Mueller said. "To
have a reason for believing what it is
we believe. It is very important for
members of our organization to be
able to say that we do not believe in
Jesus because we do not believe he
existed or we do not believe he exist
ed as he was in the Gospels."

early first century this secret was
communicated by revelation to Paul,
who preached widely. This message
about Jesus was then mythified, just
as other mystery cults had done with
their gods.
"By the end of the first century,"
Carrier continued, "some Christians
had come to believe that the myths
were real and assumed that Jesus was
a real person. This sect of Christians
eventually gained the political ad
vantage and became what we know
as orthodox Christianity, which only
preserved texts that agreed with their
interpretation and sometimes even
forged or altered texts to advance
their views."
Carrier said that the Gospel of
Mark was written nearly 60 years
after the purported death of Jesus,
and that the other three Gospels bor
rowed heavily from this book. The
version of Jesus' life given in the
Gospel contains many elements that

are usually found in the lives of myth
ical figures, he said.
"Jesus conforms so closely to the
criterion of a mythic hero the proba
bility that he was a mythic hero in
creases substantially," he said. "There
are 22 features that have been identi
fied by scholars that are commonly
shared by many mythic heroes. They
can be ranked with a score according
to how many features they have.
Jesus clearly scores at least 19 out of
22."
According to Carrier, Jesus shares
many of the following mythic traits,
including a virgin birth and divine lin
eage. An attempt is made to kill him
when he is a baby. He is spirited away
from those plotting his murder. He is
reared in a foreign country. He is
crowned king. He reigns over a peri
od of peace. He prescribes laws. He
then loses favor with the gods or his
subjects. He meets with a mysterious
death. He dies at the top of a hill. His
body turns up missing.
Jesus scores higher on this scale
than almost all other heroes, includ
ing Hercules and Romulus, Carrier
said. Only Oedipus scores higher.
"Jesus competes for second place
only with Theseus and Moses," he
said. "Everyone who scores more
than 11 on this scale is most likely
mythical. No historical figures who
accumulated some of these features
by chance or legend, such as Alexan
der the Great or Augustus Caesar,
scores even as high as 11."
Carrier pointed out that, in the an
cient world, mythological figures
often underwent the process of "his
toricization."
"This had actually become a
trend," Carrier said. "It is called 'Eu
hemerisation.' Euhemerus wrote a
work of fiction called the Sacred
Scriptures in which he showed an
imaginary scholar who had found out
that Zeus and Uranus were real his
torical kings.
"Aesop was probably never a real
person nor are any of the biographies
about him likely to be genuine," Car
rier continued. "Instead, Aesop was
most likely invented in order to as
sign a name to a growing collection of
fables passed down from numerous
oral sources.
"Historical facts were then in
vented about this Aesop and then
many detailed biographies were writ

ten that are similar in many ways to
the gospels." Carrier added. "Like
Jesus, Aesop was renowned as a chal
lenger to power. He came from a
lowly background,yet was renowned
as a cultural hero. And he was regard
ed as a martyr; he was executed by
the priests of Delphi for denouncing
their greed."
Despite this evidence. Carrier was
quick to point out that this is just a
theory.
"We need to go out and interact
with the community and see if it
stands up to the evidence," he said.
"I'm not here declaring that this is
absolutely true and it would be fool
ish to deny it. We're not at that stage
yet.
"The normal procedure is to as
sume that a person who is claimed
to be historical is historical." he
continued."unless there is a reason
to doubt it. I believe this is an ap
propriate principle. For example,
merely lacking evidence is not
enough of an argument for some
one not existing historically. You
need actual evidence for them
being mythified."
Martin Mueller, a fifth-year grad
uate student in physics, organized
the talk as the head of Rational
Thought.
"When I first came here to Stan
ford." Mueller said,"! was surprised
that there wasn't a student group
specifically for students who are sec
ular, for students who do not sub
scribe to any religious beliefs. This is
a forum for those sorts of issues.
"In the general population, the
word atheist has a bad ring to it."he
added. "But we just use it for what it
means. We do not believe in a god.
The people that are attracted to our
kinds of activities are the people who
do not believe, based on the evi
dence, that there is a God."
Talks like Carrier's help Mueller
and the members of Rational
Thought formulate their beliefs, he
said.
"It is very important for us, as it is
for everybody," Mueller said. "To
have a reason for believing what it is
we believe. It is very important for
members of our organization to be
able to say that we do not believe in
Jesus because we do not believe he
existed or we do not believe he exist
ed as he was in the Gospels."
Questions about Jesus and his
life have dominated popular culture
in recent weeks with the premiere of
"The Da Vinci Code" film, based on
the novel that alleges Christ had a
child. In this climate of religious di
alogue, Richard Carrier, a graduate
student in ancient history at Colum
bia University, told members of the
student group Rational Thought
that Jesus never existed in a speech
last night at the Math Building.
The highly-controversial speech
stood in contrast to accepted Christ
ian theology and religious-academic
thought. Most scholars accept that
there was a historical Jesus, who is the

basis of the Christian religion, though
he may or may not have exhibited
any special abilities.
But a small number of academics,
including Carrier, argue that there
was never even a historical Jesus.
They believe that the biblical apostle
Paul founded Christianity, and in his
conception, Jesus was an incorporeal,
allegorical figure. Later, they say,
Christians came to believe that Jesus
was an actual person and added vari
ous biographical details.
As evidence of his claim. Carrier
pointed to Paul's epistles, which are
the oldest books in the New Testa
ment.
"Paul never discusses Jesus' fami
ly, his deeds, where he went or where
he came from," Carrier said. "He

never discusses any of his confronta
tions with the authorities, nor any dis
putes about what he taught. He says
Jesus became flesh, was crucified and
buried, but he never says when or
where or positions these events in
any historical context."
According to Carrier, this omis
sion only makes sense if Jesus was
originally understood to be a fiction
al, heavenly figure. Carrier described
the process by which he believes
Jesus came to be seen as a historical
person.
"Jesus was originally perceived as
a heavenly being whose death and
reincarnation took place in heaven
and was made known secretly in the
