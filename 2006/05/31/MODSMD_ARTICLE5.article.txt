### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
NEVADA TEST SITE,Nev. â€” A planned 700-ton
test explosion scheduled for Friday in the desert 90
miles northwest of Las Vegas was put on hold by the
federal government last week.

While the test has not been cancelled, anti-nuclear
activists claimed victory in stopping the ammonium
nitrate and fuel oil blast expected to create a 10,000-
foot mushroom cloud that could be viewed from the
city. By comparison, the explosion was projected to be
280 times larger than the 1995 Oklahoma City bomb
ing, or about one-twenty-fifth the power of the atomic
bomb that leveled Hiroshima.
During a tour of the site last week, an official as
sured The Daily that the test would be safe. But many
environmental officials and local Native American
tribe leaders were unsatisfied with the environmental
impact data provided by the Defense 'lTireat Reduc-

tion Agency (DTRA). They worried that the large
blast would kick up radioactive dust from extensive
nuclear testing conducted near the site from the 1950s
through the early 19905.
The National Nuclear Security Administration
(NNSA) explained its actions as "being taken to clari
fy and provide further information regarding back
ground levels of radiation from global fallout in the
vicinity of the Divine Strake experiment," according
to a statement released last Friday, following a U.S.
District Court hearing in Reno, Nevada .
