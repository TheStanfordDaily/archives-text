## Safety concerns halt bomb test 700-ton Divine Strake test would be 125 times Oklahoma City bombing 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
NEVADA TEST SITE,Nev. â€” A planned 700-ton
test explosion scheduled for Friday in the desert 90
miles northwest of Las Vegas was put on hold by the
federal government last week.

While the test has not been cancelled, anti-nuclear
activists claimed victory in stopping the ammonium
nitrate and fuel oil blast expected to create a 10,000-
foot mushroom cloud that could be viewed from the
city. By comparison, the explosion was projected to be
280 times larger than the 1995 Oklahoma City bomb
ing, or about one-twenty-fifth the power of the atomic
bomb that leveled Hiroshima.
During a tour of the site last week, an official as
sured The Daily that the test would be safe. But many
environmental officials and local Native American
tribe leaders were unsatisfied with the environmental
impact data provided by the Defense 'lTireat Reduc-

tion Agency (DTRA). They worried that the large
blast would kick up radioactive dust from extensive
nuclear testing conducted near the site from the 1950s
through the early 19905.
The National Nuclear Security Administration
(NNSA) explained its actions as "being taken to clari
fy and provide further information regarding back
ground levels of radiation from global fallout in the
vicinity of the Divine Strake experiment," according
to a statement released last Friday, following a U.S.
District Court hearing in Reno, Nevada .

Before the announcement, site and feder
al officials had firmly defended the safety of
the test, saying there was "no radioactively
contaminated soil in the vicinity of the deto
nation site."
According to John Spahn, a Bechtel con
tractor and former manger of the HazMat
center program at the Nevada Test Site,"The
test will take place about two miles from the
nearest underground [nuclear] test and four
miles away from ground zero for the closest
above-ground test."
The government withdrew this finding
with last week's announcement.
The Western Shoshone Indians had filed
a lawsuit seeking an injunction, claiming that
the test would irreversibly harm tribal lands.
"They say that government hasn't provid
ed the needed assurance [that] nearby tribal
lands would [not] be threatened." said David
Cherry, the communications director for
Rep. Shelley Berkley, (D-Las Vegas). He ex
pressed support for the lawsuit, saying that
the Shoshones' claims had "good documen
tation."
Bob Hager.the attorney representing the
Shoshones, told The Las Vegas Review-Jour
nal over the weekend that the government
had cancelled a June 8 federal court hearing
regarding the project. According to Hager,
the government delayed the experiment be
cause it cannot provide evidence demon
strating the test's safety. Originally sched
uled for June 2, the testing had already been
rescheduled for June 23 before its indefinite
postponement.
Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), welcomed the
delay in an official statement. This repre
sents a change of heart from last week, when
a Reid spokeswoman told The Daily that the
Senate minority leader supported the test
after being given assurances in a classified
briefing.
"They showed us the test will be absolute
ly non-nuclear and conventional in nature,"

said that spokeswoman. Sharyn Stein. "At
the end of the meeting, he said he would not
object because he feels they have taken the
proper steps to do the test safely."
The NNSA had said that the $23 million
test would allow defense planners to under
stand the structural integrity of deep, under
ground tunnels when targeted with massive
firepower. Since no plane can hold 7(X) tons
of explosives, a hole dug at ground level
would be filled with the explosives, and sci
entists would measure their impact on an ex
isting tunnel 1,1(H) feet under the surface.
Hie ability to destroy underground tun
nels has become a military priority as fears
about bunkers deep in Iran and North Korea
have intensified. Some worried the opera
tion would foreshadow the return of nuclear
testing ended by the IW2 Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty.
"The real concern is that this is in some
ways a precursor to new nuclear testing and
development," Cherry said. "There are some
things that don't square up. All along, we've
always said,'why do they need to test some
thing with 7CK) tons of explosive?"'
Controversy ensued after several news
outlets reported on the magnitude of the
planned blast.
"I don't want to sound glib here but it is
the first time in Nevada that you'll see a
mushroom cloud over Las Vegas since we
stopped testing nuclear weapons," said
James Tegnelia, head of the Defense Threat
Reduction Agency, in May.
The State of Nevada had expressed some
initial concerns about the project but
seemed to accept federal government assur
ances that the test would not threaten the
health of those downwind.
"The governor mostly deferred to NSA
on this one," said Bob Loux. director of the
Nevada Agency for Nuclear Projects. "We'll
see what happens but it's not a huge issue for
us."
Based on state support and federal assur
ances, other members of the Nevada con
gressional delegation were not opposed to

the test.
"In November of 2(K)5. my office received
a report on the plan to test the explosive
charge in Nevada said U. S. Rep. Jon Porter
(R-Nev.)."This report, along with the state's
subsequent approval of the planned test, ad
dressed my initial concerns about Nevadan's
safety."
Nevadans weren't the only ones alarmed.
Since Utah has the dubious distinction of
being downwind from Nevada, its political
leaders are even more concerned about the
test. Clusters of cancer patients match the
dispersal patterns of radiation from after nu
clear testing conducted at the site decades
ago. Its congressional delegation issued
some of strongest rebukes.
"After reading comments about mush
room clouds and low yield nuclear weapons,
I was greatly concerned, and expressed as
much to the director of DTRA," Rep. Jim
Matheson (D-Ut.) said. "I advised them to
put all the health and safety data out on the
table so that people's fears about being once
again exposed to radioactive contamination
could be addressed. I am very pleased to see
that these agencies have acted on my advice."
A Divine Strake Coalition of 41 organiza
tions formed to oppose the test. On Sunday,
about 3(X) protesters gathered at the en
trance to the site to celebrate the postpone
ment.
On a tour of the site that included the lo
cation of the Divine Strake tests, visitors
largely supported the test.
"I'm not a proponent of nuclear weapons
or anything, but it's something necessary to
do in order to protect the state " said Tom
Harrington, a retired math teacher from
Chicago. "We need to learn how to react if
something happens. That's what survival is
all about."
The project name. Divine Strake, refers
nautically to a continuous line of plating
from the stem to stern of a ship. In bomb
manufacturing, the term 'strake' refers to the
rail that attaches the bomb to the launch
platform.
