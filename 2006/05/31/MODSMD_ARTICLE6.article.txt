number of novels, books of poetry, short sto
ries and criticisms.
His most critically acclaimed novel was
"Mulligan Stew," which Eaven Boland, direc
tor of Stanford's Creative Writing Program de
scribed as, "A wonderful, linguistically anar
chic book, paying tribute to his influences,
Myles na Gopaleen and James Joyce."
Sorrentino was born in Brooklyn in 1929
and entered Brooklyn College in 1950. He
worked in various jobs in the publishing indus
try in New York City, according to "Who's Who
in America." He then entered academia, and
served on the faculties at Columbia Universi
ty, Sarah Lawrence College, the University of
Scranton in Pennsylvania and the New School
of Social Research in New York. After a round
of teaching jobs in New England, he moved to
California in 1982 taking an English professor
ship at Stanford.
While at the University, Sorrentino taught a
number of seminars and workshops on novel
ists and writing. He taught on campus until
1999 when he retired to New York.
"With over 20 books of fiction and poetry,
Sorrentino was one of the most prolific of
avant-garde writers," said English Department
Chair Ramon Saldivar.'in his two decades on
the faculty at Stanford he helped solidify the
reputation of the creative writing unit of the
Department of English into one of the most
prestigious in the world."
Boland, who was director of the Creative
Writing Program for about four years while
Sorrentino was on faculty, recalled
how his presence and interactions
enriched the writing community.
"He was an eminent writer — ex
perimental and steadfast — and a
model and hero for many young
writers," Boland said in an email to
the English Department and Cre
ative Writing Program. "And I want
to add, on a personal note, how often
he showed me courtesy and assis
tance and let me listen to fascinating
details of his early life as a writer in
New York."
Sorrentino not only leaves be

hind a legacy to the wider literary
world but also a lasting impact on
the writing program here.
"He was a bravely unswerving
experimental writer," Boland said.
"He brought that witness and ex
ample to teaching the Stegner
workshop in fiction and also into
the classroom. Universities only
rarely host experimental writers. So
his voice was particularly valuable.
His vision, defiance of the orthodox
and courage as a stylist was a real
gift. The Creative Writing Program
is honored to have been associated
with him."
Sorrentino was 77 and died of
complications due to lung cancer. He
is survived by his wife. Victoria Ortiz,
his two sons and his three grandchil
dren.
