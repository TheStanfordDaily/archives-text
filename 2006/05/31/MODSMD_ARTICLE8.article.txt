# The 						Atomic Testing Museum:
## Window to the Past 
### 
LAS VEGAS — The nuclear legacy that
looms so large here has been commem
orated by exhibits at the new Atomic
Testing Museum. Opened in February of last
year, the state-of-the art, interactive center
— an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution
— follows chronologically the evolution of
nuclear technology from the Manhattan
Project to the post-Sept. 11 efforts to contain
nuclear materials around the globe.
After walking by a timeline of everything
nuclear in the 19905, visitors enter rooms
within the exhibit centered around various
themes, like Harold Edgerton's high-speed
photography of explosions and the Native
American culture of the area near the Neva
da Test Site.
"We've related those experiences in an
attempt to show there is a deeper human
history," said Museum Registrar Vanya
Scott, who manages the collections and arti
facts. "All the artifacts in here have a story to
tell — singly or as a group."
An internationally-renowned design
firm was charged with including as much
multimedia as possible.Touch screens, video
displays and objects are scattered through
out the museum.
"The multimedia aspects allow us to
reach all audiences." Scott said. "Some peo
ple are visual learners. Some people learn by
touching and feeling. Some people need to
listen. We cater to all these needs."
The museum drew 30,000 visitors in its
first year, a turnout that Museum Opera
tions Manager Maggie Smith considers
promising.
"We feel like that was a pretty good
start." she said.The museum has had several
high-profile visitors, including several sena
tors and the secretary of the Department of
Energy.
A security officer at the museum. Lee
Williams, was a formerly captain in the pri
vate security force at the Nevada Test Site —
an area featured prominently in the exhibit
— from 1974 to 2000.
"The exhibits bring back a lot of memo
ries every day,"he said. "We were never in
the same place two days in a row, and we got
to see all the tests."
The displays try to paint a balanced pic
ture of the nuclear issue, its designers said.
"It's very important for us to communi
cate that we are a museum that attempts to
tell all sides of the story," Scott said. "We're
not pro- or anti-nuclear. We want to recount
the history of what happened and let the vis
itors decide for themselves."
But some visitors felt the exhibits tended
to be more supportive of nuclear technology
than museum officials stated.
"I don't know if it entirely shows both
sides," said Jack McKenna, a native of Van
couver in Canada. "Some of the movies

seemed more pro-atomic."
Nonetheless, McKenna said he enjoyed
the museum.
"I lived through the Cold War, and this
brings backs what a frightening time it
was," he said. McKenna. who was born in
1954, remembers watching the Cuban Mis
sile Crisis unfold on television. He said he
was expecting to see more on the crisis in
the museum.
A series of special exhibits are planned
for in the coming months. In August, for ex
ample, survivors of the Nagasaki blasts will
speak about their experiences.
Still young, the museum hopes to expand.
Scott said she'd like to develop traveling ex
hibits on subjects that could not be ad
dressed due to a lack of space. One example
she offered was the role that the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
played in predicting the weather during test
ing.
In addition to the Atomic Testing Muse
um. several nuclear-related exhibits are lo
cated nearby.
Harry Reid Exhibit Hall
Attached to the museum is a traveling ex
hibit hall. The current display features gadg
ets, including a Geiger counter, telephones
designed to withstand nuclear fallout and a
special camera used to photograph blasts.
The Nuclear Testing Archive
In the same facility, but unaffiliated with
the museum, is a reading room sponsored by
Bechtel SAIC — the private contractor that
supports government operations at the
Nevada Test Site and Yucca Mountain.The
archives contain videos and documents cre
ated by the contractor and released by the
government under the Freedom of Informa
tion Act.
"From movies to documents to slide
shows, we've got it all," said Jeff Gordon, the
librarian who runs the reading room. "Any
one who wants to look at the history of nu
clear testing is welcome."
Nevada State Museum
A traveling exhibit here includes photos
taken by Las Vegas photographer Don Eng
lish of mushroom clouds from tests conduct
ed during the 1950s that were visible in the
Las Vegas morning sky. There are also cre
ative photos of show girls and casino opera
tions taken during this era.
The Atomic Testing Museum is located at 755
East Flamingo Road in Las Vegas.
