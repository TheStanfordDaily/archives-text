NEVADA TEST SITE, Nev. — Changing realities in a post-
Cold War world have caused forced adjustments in America's
nuclear proving ground. In a nine-hour, 250-mile tour of the
high-security 1,375-square mile Nevada Test Site —larger than the
state of Rhode Island — visitors saw both relics of a bygone era and
were briefed on the new defense, environmental and energy pro
grams intended to meet the nation's needs in the 21st century.
In the opening salvo of the nuclear age, Harry Truman wanted
to find a location where through testing and development — the
power of the atom could be mastered for scientific and military ap
plications. So the Atomic Energy Commission secretly selected
this site, 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas, where 100 atmospheric
nuclear tests were conducted in the 12 years after the site opened
in 1951.
The site's methods changed in 1963 when President John
Kennedy signed the Limited Test BanTreaty.literallydrivingthe test
ing underground. The majority of all nuclear activity in the world, 828
underground tests, was conducted at the site — until 1992, when
President George Bush, Sr. placed a moratorium on nuclear testing.
The craters from these years of nuclear blasts speckle the desert
floor. While it's hard to contemplate the damage each bomb could
have inflicted if a city had been its target, such was the job of scien
tists stationed here.
At Frenchman Flat, physicists tested the impact of nuclear blasts
on physical structures, constructing and then exploding industrial
and residential buildings. Underground garages and shelters were
built with different materials to see how much force each could with
stand. They also tried to model the effects of blasts on humans, outfit
ting pigs with miniature military uniforms and locking them in pens
to test the effects of the explosions' intense heat.The pigs were test
ed. the tour guide said, because their skin is remarkably like that of
humans.
The results of these tests are clear to any visitor, with leftover
shards of these decimated structures littering the landscape. A
railroad bridge was constructed more than a mile away from
Ground Zero, the site of detonation. All that is left today are the
mangled and partly-melted railroad trestles. Visitors on the tour
said these remnants reminded them of the awesome power nu
clear weapons bear.
"I've seen pictures and read about the destruction of nuclear
weapons in books, but actually seeing that railroad trestle made a real
impression on me "said Jim Kirkpatrick, a Wyoming native on a road
trip. "Driving around Ground Zero had a unique sense about it."
Scientists also set off bombs to determine how typical American
homes would hold up during a Soviet nuclear attack. Houses built in
the Yucca Flat at varying distances from Ground Zero were stocked
with all the conveniences of the mid-19505, and scientists studied each
after the blasts. The classic footage of exploding houses comes from
this series of tests.
ITie tour was taken to a house 9,000 feet away from Ground Zero
that survived the testing and still stands five decades later.
The site also helped scientists learn more about the limits of nu
clear applications. With the power of the atom a mysterious marvel,
scientists for a time believed seriously that nuclear weapons could be
used as relatively inexpensive tools for peaceful purposes. This no
tion motivated Dwight Eisenhower to announce his "Atoms for
Peace" initiative in 1953. Here, that program met its end.
Named for the biblical parable in which swords are beaten into
plowshares, the Plowshare Program explored the possibility of using
nuclear blasts to construct dams, dredge canals, clear land for high
ways and make railroad cuts through mountains. But studies of nu
clear excavation — which produced sights like the awe-inspiring
Sedan Crater — also created fireball mushroom clouds and deadly
levels of radiation, understandably dissuading the use of nuclear war
heads to these ends.

New realities at the end of Cold War and the beginning of the War
on Terror have shifted research away from such purposes. In 1992, a
$44 million underground experiment, co-sponsored by the British,
called Project Icecap was four weeks from completion when George
Bush Sr. declared a moratorium on testing. The superpowers hoped
to study the effects of a nuclear blast on urban high rises. As a result,
a several-hundred-foot-tall structure stands alone on the desert floor.
Trailers on stilts meant to measure ground movement sits by in case
testing is resumed.
And with the war on terror and the recent jump in military spend
ing, use of the site — if not the prospects of renewing Cold War-style
testing — is on the rise. A variety of agencies — including the De
partment of Energy, Department of Homeland Security, Defense
Threat Reduction Agency and the national laboratories — have
staffs and offices on the site.
In so-called sub-critical tests, scientists have continued to work
with different nuclear materials without putting enough together to
create a detonation and fallout. The Stockpile Stewardship program
allows them to keep the nuclear arsenal modern without testing. A
planned 700-ton conventional bomb test set for June was indefinite
ly postponed by the government last Friday. [See adjacent story]
The Department of Homeland Security has constructed a massive
training facility on site to train police, fire and medical first-respon
ders at the federal, state and local levels for various scenarios. These
emergency officers come for one-week training courses, which in
clude training on what to do after the release of radiation from a so
called dirty' bomb.
The federal government picks up the tab for the travel, housing,
food and training costs of the law enforcement agencies involved,
said John Spahn. a Bechtel contractor and former manger of the Haz-
Mat center program at the Nevada Test Site.
At the Incident Experiment Site, the National Center for Com
bating Terrorism has crashed planes, derailed railroad cars and
staged other realistic crisis scenarios. Last week. Las Vegas Fire De
partment trucks were parked outside one of the mock simulations.
At the HazMat Spill Center that Spahn managed until 2002, first
responders can practice cleaning up real chemical spills and contain
ing explosions. More than 10,(XK) first responders receive specialized
training on detecting and responding to weapons of mass destruc
tion.
"You name the three letter agencies," Spahn said. "They've all
been out here."
This helps explain the secrecy still shrouding the site. On the tour,
no phones, cameras, recorders or binoculars are allowed. Area 51, the
highly-secret government installation, sits on the other side of a ridge
at the border of the site. On maps, it is known as Groom Lake. A
Predator aircraft — the unmanned aerial drone used extensively in
Afghanistan — flew by the tour bus. The planes are operated out of
a nearby Air Force base. Humvees with machine gun emplacements
rove around the site. Some tour participants felt the impact of the
high level of security.
"I would have liked to have seen more nuts and bolts, but I guess
that is off-limits," said Gary Henderson, a Florida retiree.
Officials said the site is prepared to resume underground nuclear
testing in less than two years. The government maintains a staff of
1,200 at the site, a far cry from the once thriving infrastructure that re
quired more than 13,000 supporting a continuous flurry of activity.
While most said they enjoyed the tour and were proud of the work
the government has done here, one participant worried that the tours
don't tell the whole story.
"It's good for people to come get educated, but you have to be
careful about how much information you take from here," said
Michele Mason, a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford's Freeman Spogli
Institute for International Studies. "There's a lot of information that
is being left out."
