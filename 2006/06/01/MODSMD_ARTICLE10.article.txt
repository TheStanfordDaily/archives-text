# Farm To Farm
## Connects Local Farmers and Stanford Students 
### SINI MATIKAINEN HEALTH DESK EDITOR 
112 the adage
■r "you are what you
eat" is true, then Stan
ford students are learning a
lot about themselves through the Farm to
Farm Program on campus. The program, a
cooperative effort between student, ad
ministrative and non-University groups,
aims to build a bridge between students
and local farmers by bringing speakers on
campus to talk about agriculture and or
ganic farming and taking students off cam
pus to see the farms for themselves.
"The purpose of these visits is to bring
the ideas and ideals behind sustainable
food systems directly to the Stanford stu
dent community," says Seth Silverman,
sophomore and member of the Stanford
Student Community Garden Group
(SSCGG). "The practice of agriculture —
especially of farming done well — is a won
der and an exciting practice that few, at this
point, truly understand. Part of the joy of
purchasing from local, family-owned, sus
tainable growers is that it is possible to de
velop a relationship with the growers while
enjoying the fruit of their work."
He continues, "The idea is to create
food with a face — rather than anony
mous fare — to deepen the connection be
tween visitors to the dining halls and the
food that they are consuming and to com
municate that by investing in local agricul
ture we invest not only in the environment,
but also in the local people who are the
stewards of the land. Visitors talk about
any number of things from how to grow

strawberries to the
challenges of reestablishing local food
routes."
The program is a cooperative effort be
tween Stanford Dining, the SSCGG, the
Woods Institute for the Environment and
a local agricultural alliance, the Agricul
ture and Land Based Training Association
(ALBA). So far. Farm to Farm has brought
organic strawberry farmer Domitilla Mar
tinez to speak to students at Florence
Moore Dining Hall, marketing coordina
tor for ALBA Dina Izzo to speak at Stern
and Anya Fernauld from the Community
Alliance for Family Farmers (CAFF) to
talk about CAFF's work with underrepre
sented Californian family farmers at Rick
er. Stanford students also visited an ALBA
organic farm on May 24, where partici
pants took a tour of the farm and picked
fresh produce.
"1 think that the program has been a
success because every student involved in
our Farm Talks or Farm Visit has seemed
engaged and interested," says freshman
Max Romano, one of the organizers of the
program. "Stanford students are interest
ed in learning how our society functions,
and agricultural systems are unfortunately
absent from most Stanford educations."
Romano has been described as the
"driving force" behind the Farm-to-Farm

program, and the program itself
was started on his initiative. In March
of 2006, Romano applied for a grant from
the Woods Institute for the Environment
on behalf of the SSCGG, and his project
was one of five student initiatives selected
by the institute. The Institute, which gives
out $10,(XX) in grant money to student ini
tiatives each year, selects projects that are
Stanford and environmentally focused.
In addition to the support Farm to
Farm has received from the Woods Insti
tute, both the program and the SSCGG as
a whole have received praise from Stan
ford Dining.
Rafi Taherian, Executive Director for
Stanford Dining, says, "To answer the
question, 'why we have chosen to be part
of this program'... Why wouldn't we? 1
think it is evident that this program is in
line with Stanford Dining's other sustain
ability initiatives, and the benefits are nu
merous. To give an example, the next time
you go to the supermarket, check pricing
for a bag of kitchen herbs and you will see
that they are very expensive. And, inciden
tally, seldom do you find them to be organ
ic. To be able to grow these herbs in and
around our operating kitchens provides
chefs access to fresh herbs, and at a sustain
able price."
Taherian's emphasis on food that is
both organic and affordable reflects grow
ing student demand for organic food (see
"No More Frankenfruit," April 28). Given
recent allegations by both British and
American scientists that non-organic pro-

duce contains fewer nutrients than its or
ganic counterparts (and the produce of
fifty years ago), the cooperation between
organic farms outside of Stanford, organic
farms beside dining halls and Stanford
Dining itself represents a union of health,
education and social equality.
Explains Romano,"! do believe that or
ganic agriculture is healthier for our socie
ty than conventional agriculture, but many
other equally important issues are com
monly overshadowed by organics. For in
stance the SSCGG believes that local fam
ily farms are often better to support than
distant organic farms because of the large
costs of transportation to the environment
and to the quality of the food."
As a local non-profit agricultural group
that operates two organic farms in con
junction with educational programs for
local farmers to teach them about organic
farming and small business management,
those associated with ALBA have much to
teach Stanford students about equitable
and sustainable agriculture. The coopera
tion between the two of them represents
an ideal melding between on-and-off cam
pus sustainable agriculture.
The Farm to Farm initiative doesn't
have any more talks scheduled before the
end of spring quarter, but Romano hopes
that the program will continue next year.
"Everybody that participated had a lot
of fun." he says." We would like to organize
further farm visits if our grant is renewed
or we receive funding from another
source."

and to the quality of the food."
As a local non-profit agricultural group
that operates two organic farms in con
junction with educational programs for
local farmers to teach them about organic
farming and small business management,
those associated with ALBA have much to
teach Stanford students about equitable
and sustainable agriculture. The coopera
tion between the two of them represents
an ideal melding between on-and-off cam
pus sustainable agriculture.
The Farm to Farm initiative doesn't
have any more talks scheduled before the
end of spring quarter, but Romano hopes
that the program will continue next year.
"Everybody that participated had a lot
of fun." he says." We would like to organize
further farm visits if our grant is renewed
or we receive funding from another
source."
