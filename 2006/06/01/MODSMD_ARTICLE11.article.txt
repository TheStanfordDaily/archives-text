# Tech company targets Ethiopian AIDS
## 
### KATHERINE COX STAFF WRITER 
Intelesense Technologies, one of nine spin-off compa
nies generated by the Stanford School of Medicine's Na
tional Biocomputation Center, is poised to improve
healthcare in Ethiopia with its unique and adaptable
telecommunication systems. The company's Chief Execu
tive Officer, Kevin Montgomery has made a preliminary
trip to the Ethiopian countryside to lay the groundwork
for a collaborative project to connect remote, AIDS dense
areas of the country to medical centers and professionals
in urbanized areas.
Montgomery serves as technical director at the Na
tional Biocomputation Center, a division of the Stanford
School of Medicine that has partnered with the NASA
Ames Research Center of Moffet Field, Calif, to develop
advanced 3D visualization technologies for biomedical
applications. Intelesense took shape in early 2(X)5 as
Montgomery and colleagues realized the gadgets they
were developing could function as wireless data transmit
ting devices in a wide variety of settings — whether they
relay weather reports or monitor incidence rates of a par
ticular disease in a rural area.
According to Montgomery, "A number of companies
make all types of sensors that measure things, but no
one really makes a little box that you can plug the sen
sors into."
The little box to which Montgomery refers is a small
computer that transmits information wirelessly and is In
telesense's mainstay technology. Its hardware and capa

bilities are similar to those of micro satellites — the type
of devices developed in Prof. Bob Twiggs' Space Systems
Development Laboratory at Stanford — and the kind of
technology with which many of Intelesense's Stanford
based technicians are familiar.
These wireless transmitting devices constitute a spe
cial kind of network that the company has coined the'in
telenet."
Montgomery explains, "In a particular region we'll
have a whole bunch of these devices. They wake up at the
same time and transmit their location along with the infor
mation that has been inputted to them through this net
work of nodes."
One of these nodes has a way of getting on to the In
ternet.
"It uses the internet as a tunnel to get to [Intelesense's]
server in San Jose," he says. The simultaneously activation
of all the nodes in the system enables nodes in remote lo
cations to transmit information to receivers with an inter
net connection. Additionally, the sensors themselves may
be manipulated by remote control from a distant location.
The technology produces a connection between the
residents and geological features of decidedly primitive
terrains and the digitalized world. As a result of this, a
number of governmental agencies and research organi
zations have eagerly sought the company's unique serv
ice and have paired with them on a growing number of
projects. Grants from the National Science Foundation
and support from the University of Hawaii powered a
sensor deployment project on three Hawaiian islands
with the aim to collect data on the environment and in
vestigate sustainable land development methods. Inte
lesense's main collaborator and funding resource is the
U.S. Army's Telemedicine and Advanced Technology
Research Center (TATRC),a military division that con
ducts research into emerging techniques and technolo
gies in telemedicine.
About two years ago TATRC asked Intelesense to

participate in a project in Vietnam that would monitor the
spread and origins of water-borne illness in that country.
"We deployed our sensors in the drinking water supply
and set up weather sensors. We correlated this with live
data coming in from a sensor that told us what people
were sick with," Montgomery says.
Montgomery anticipates partnering with TATRC,
which receives some funding from the U.S. President's
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, to use similar strategies
in Ethiopia. TATRC has a cast of its own advanced
telecommunication devices that will benefit from the
wireless network that Intelesense will install in the field.
For instance, TATRC can provide a device called a
Bioresearch Monitoring Information System that, ac
cording to Montgomery, is basically a PDA application
that will allow health professionals in rural areas of
Ethiopia take patient encounters away from the clinic.
"Doctors or nurses can use the BMIS to type in the pa
tient encounter information. 'Tap, tap, tap,' the informa
tion goes in, in less than a minute and the data is transmit
ted out," Montgomery says."lntelesense can complement
such capabilities with video conferencing.
In light of this, the methods currently used by relief
workers and health officials in Ethiopia to track patient
cases and the dispersal of antiretroviral drug therapies
seem terribly antiquated. Today, giant logbooks are used
to keep record of the millions of AIDS cases in the large
ly undeveloped Ethiopia. The heft of these records and
the impossibility of duplication makes it nearly impossi
ble to chart the regional movements of the disease.
"You need to get antiretroviral drugs to those who
need them, and you need to spread your medical expert
ise out to these remote areas," Montgomery says.
Montgomery hopes the project, which has yet to re
ceive solid funding from TATRC, will, "expand medical
human capacity to outlying remote areas in Ethiopia,"
which may help to preserve a good deal of human life in
this AIDS-wracked nation.
