## Editorial Edit Board bids farewell 
### 
Another major topic we addressed this
quarter was Stanford's residential system. We
examined the merits of the proposed Hous
ing Master Plan and highlighted the problems
with the Draw. We questioned the relevance
and efficacy of Residential Education's poli
cies. We also facetiously proposed ideas such
as trading Draw numbers and instituting reli
gious theme dorms —we hope that these
proposals helped invigorate discussions
about the housing situation on campus.
In addition, our editorials served as a
form of institutional memory for the Stan
ford community, covering the anti-Bush
protest in April and the recent armed rob
beries and upholding traditions like Exotic
Erotic and Structured Liberal Education.
But the editorials that drew the most
heated responses were those relating to race
and ethnicity. We have been criticized for our
imperfect attempts to address these sensi
tive issues in a public forum. Yet these edito
rials filled a gap in campus discourse, and we
hope that they will open the way to more
honest dialogue about race.
We hope that readers will recognize the
challenges involved in writing editorials.The
Board has tried its best to represent a wide
range of student opinion — even if you
strongly disagreed with one of our editorials,
we hope that you might at least agree in prin
ciple with our broader aim to spur conversa
tion. And if you feel that your perspective
was not adequately addressed by the Board,
we invite you to participate in this process by
joining the Board next year.
As we revisit the philosophy we outlined
in our first editorial ("The Editorial Board's
confession of faith," Feb. 7), we see that we
remained true to our commitment to gener
ate dialogue and effect change. We hope that
future Boards will continue to engage proac
tively with the rest of the student body and
come up with thought-provoking ideas to
challenge well-worn modes of thinking.

The Editorial Board often faces a
dilemma when writing editorials.
Whenever we publish a piece that is
edgy and controversial, readers are quick to
label it as sensationalistic and inflammatory.
When we are overly critical of individuals
and institutions, some people take personal
offense. And when our editorials are too
namby-pamby, they are likely to go unread
and unnoticed.
We learned a long time ago that it is im
possible for us to please everyone, but pleas
ing everyone was never part of our mission.
Rather, we believe that a well-written edito
rial has the potential to provoke thought,
create dialogue and galvanize people to ac
tion. As much as possible, we have avoided
creating controversy for the sake of contro
versy. But we are not afraid of challenging
the status quo or stepping on a few toes to
spark debate on important issues.
And so, as Volume 229 draws to a close,
we find it fruitful to revisit some of the issues
we've raised. While our editorials last quar
ter focused more on global and national is
sues, we turned our attention to addressing
campus issues this quarter.
In particular, the Board provided exten
sive coverage of the ASSU elections in an at
tempt to inform students about our elected
representatives. We ran a retrospective piece
on the achievements of outgoing ASSU ex
ecutives Melanie Kannokada and Aneto
Okonkwo as well as an endorsement for cur
rent ASSU President Elizabeth Heng and
Vice President Lauren Graham. In addition,
we published a full-page Elections Guide
that summarized our recommendations for
Special Fees groups.
Even after the elections were over, we
continued to explore related issues. We
asked that all elected representatives be
held accountable for their campaign promis
es and questioned the prudence of Heng and
Graham's efforts to make Dead Week dead.
