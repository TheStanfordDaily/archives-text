# From one confused citizen to another

### 
Sometimes the government is just plain
baffling. Two Saturdays ago. Louisiana
Democratic Representative William
Jefferson's office was searched in pursuit of
evidence supporting a recent affidavit that
claims a FBI search found $9().(KK) wrapped
up and stashed in his home freezer. The affi
davit alleges that Jefferson has received
$ 1 CH).(KK) in bribes while serving as a U.S. Rep
resentative. Jefferson, an eight-term con
gressman, denies any wrongdoing and has yet
to have any charges filed against him.
While corruption in Congress is old news
nowadays, what is really interesting about this
situation is the incredibly confusing chain of
events that transpired following the search of
Jefferson's house.
First, Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert
(RIL) proclaimed that the search of the home
was unconstitutional. He even went straight to
the President to complain. Hastert relied on
precedence, arguing that it shouldn't be done
because it's never been done before.
"Nothing I have learned in the last 48
hours [since the search]," he said,"leads me
to believe that there was any necessity to
change the precedent established over those
219 years."
Then Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist
(RTN) said the FBI had no right to search
Jefferson's home. But before anyone could
even check the Constitution, in came the
Democrats. House Minority Leader and
San Francisco Representative Nancy
Pelosi chimed in that Hastert and Frist
were right — Congressmen's houses ought
not to be searched.
You can imagine my initial indignation.
How can a congress that approved the wildly
invasive Patriot Act protest the warranted
search of a congressman when there is signif
icant evidence against him? In this case, a
Kentucky businessman and a former Jeffer
son aide have already pleaded guilty to
bribery charges. If Congress was actually in
terested in cleaning up its reputation, would
n't it want to have members that have re
ceived bribes sought out and brought to jus
tice? Do these Congressmen think they are
above the law?
But then I looked into what exactly
Hastert. Frist and Pelosi were contesting. In a
statement late last week. Hastert and Pelosi
claimed that the search of Jefferson's house
represents a violation of Article One Section
Six of the Constitution:
This Article reads: "The Senators and
Representatives...shall in all Cases, except
Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be
privileged from Arrest during their Atten
dance at the Session of their respective Hous
es, and in going to and returning from the
same: and for any Speech or Debate in either
House, they shall not be questioned in any
other Place."
Okay, so maybe they are above the law. In
their statements, Hastert and Pelosi also

claim that the search of Jefferson's house sig
nifies a violation of the separation of powers.
Because the FBI works for the Justice De
partment which works for the President, the
search symbolizes the President overstepping
his Constitutional powers. Wait a second, that
sounds familiar...
A day later, in a now all-too-predictable
chain of events, the Attorney General came
to clear up these legal questions. Gonzalez
maintained that it is. as everything seems to
be nowadays, within the President's authority
to conduct such searches if the information
cannot be obtained in usual ways.
"It is true it's never been done before, and
the reason isn't because there's never been
corruption in Congress." he said,"but because
before, we were able to reach accommoda
tion or agreement to get the information, the
evidence we needed through subpoena. And
through variety of reasons, that could not
occur here"
And just as he reassured us that he under
stands the importance of the Freedom of the
Press and Speech last week, this week he
again gracefully reestablishes that he has, in
fact, read the Constitution.
"We have a great deal of respect for the
Congress as a coequal branch of govern
ment."
Greater than, less than,coequal to?
So maybe the search does represent the
President going beyond his Constitutional
rights. It certainly has happened before. But
just when I thought I had things sorted out,
they got confusing again.
The Democrats asked Jefferson to resign
his seat on the tax-writing Ways and Means
Committee, perhaps the most prestigious of
all I louse Committees. If he hasn't done any
thing wrong, why does he need to resign?
To top it all off. Frist completely reversed
his previous statements on Monday. Evident
ly after spending an hour with Gonzalez, Frist
understood why the President has the power
to mobilize such a search.
"There is no individual in House or Senate
that can stand above the law," he said."lt's a
matter of how the law is carried out and it's
appropriate as I see it today."
And while I wonder what Gonzalez could
have possibly said to Frist in that hour, a dif
ferent question comes to mind:
What the hell has he got in his freezer?

Jeremy is probably still trying to sort thus all out.
