# A Modern Day Fairytale
## No rest for the bedless 
### 
When my friend Ann left home for
college, her parents immediately
got rid of her bed, so that if she ever
tried to come back, it could only be on a tem
porary, crashing-on-the-couch basis. That's
how she knew she was, officially, on her own.
At Stanford. I had great luck with beds,
rhe Housing Gods smiled down on me three
times in succession with mattresses even
Goldilocks wouldn't have passed up. A real
ly comfortable bed (regardless of the pres
ence or absence of an additional occupant) is
as soothing as an embrace and makes even
the most stressful living situations so much
more bearable.
At the end of my semester in South
Africa, sleeping arrangements got conipli
cated.There were six of us living together in
a "holiday flat," but we had told our landlord
there were only five so he wouldn't charge us
extra. To open up more space to just hang
out. we crammed all our beds side-by-side in
one room and took turns sleeping on the
floor. It wasn't so bad. especially since the
whole study abroad experience scores high
on the scale of Stories To Tell the Grandkids.
Since deciding to undergo another trial
separation from New York for the summer. I
have become bedless. As of the end of this

week, I will have a room in an apartment in
San Francisco, but no bed. A friend of mine
was looking for someone to sublet in her
newly leased apartment; I was looking for a
place to stay. But my fatal error was forget
ting to ask if it was furnished. Common
sense: 1. Ilena: 0. I'm looking forward to a
summer of air mattresses, futons and sleep
ing bags.
Bed ownership is a commitment, and I'm
not afraid to admit to being more than a lit
tle phobic. If you've invested in a bed. you're
probably going to be sticking around (if only
because it's such a pain in the ass to ship else
where). And. since moving back home would
mean, well, moving back home, I'm still un
decided whether or not to stay.
After months of being exempt from the
job hunt — I mean, what better excuse is
there for not coming in for interviews than,
"Sorry. I'm in Africa"? — returning to the
sleeping-on-my-friends'-floors reality of
being back at Stanford has meant fielding
countless repetitions of the inevitable,
"What are you doing next year?"
I don't mind the question, but I still
haven't perfected my response — I'm look
ing for the right mix of sarcasm and mild self
deprecation that'll convey this message: I

have no fucking clue what my plans are for
the future.
Which, for now, is A-OK.
Supposedly most soon-to-be-graduates
are just starting the job process now. I have a
sneaking suspicion this isn't true, at least not
at Stanford where for many of my peers the
possibilities inherent in consulting, or I
banking, were too good to pass up.
With graduation less than three weeks
away, the class of '06 is basically on the
precipice of the gaping abyss of pseudo
adulthood. And it's a long way down.
So why am I not more worried? Because,
in the end. I think there's a little Tom Petty in
all of us.
Several years ago, I went to the former
undertaker and his band's concert. At one
point, in between songs, he shared with the
audience a short story about a girlfriend's
lack of faith in his abilities:
"With that long blond hair, you ain't
never gonna get a job."
"Naw, baby, I'm gonna be a rock star."

We've reached the end of the road. Ilena
George thanks you for coming along for the
ride. Comments on her driving can be directed
