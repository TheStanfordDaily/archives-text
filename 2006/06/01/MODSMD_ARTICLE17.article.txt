# Check out my ride, yo
## 
### 
I just got my first car in four years. My sis
ters, both of whom have worse grades and
are younger than me, have had cars con
tinually since they turned 17. Mine was sold
when I moved out here, a subtle comment on
how happy my parents were with my decision
to leave their coast.
I should not complain because I actually
didn't pay for this car; it's an old family car
and it needed a home anyway and I just hap
pened to be the lucky recipient. So I should
n't look a gift horse in its gas guzzling mouth.
It's an SUV. If I had the money, I'd buy a
hybrid. Something small and efficient and I'd
paint it black and have a clever bumper stick
er relating to Bush's shortcomings.
The only way I can justify driving an SUV
is to use it to run over oil executives (whose
medical bills I'm probably funding). Oil com
panies have record profits and my car will
take a $ 1 (K) to fill up? I wonder if my car will
run on rage. Or, alternatively, because a lot of
the cost of gas comes from federal taxes. I can
try running down government officials. I'll
have difficulty telling the two groups apart.
I have seen this type of car before. Or
rather, I've seen the type of person who
would drive this car before. He has his win
dows down and his system up and throws his
hands to the music before he swerves to
avoid my bike. And it's even cooler how his
buddy leans out the window and barks at me.

It doesn't matter what it is, for it reinforces
two things: 1) he is a badass 2) his friend is a
lesser badass who cannot afford a sweet ass
ride like his, but at least knows a good crew to
join up with. I always enjoy his commentary,
his backwards cap. his upturned collar and
the little gems of philosophy I hear from him.
Guy in passenger seat: "I GOTTA GET
HIGH! WHOOO!"
Me: "You are using the future tense when
you clearly intended the past."
I'm an English major. My rebuttals take
time. Unfortunately, the driver of the car had
kicked his sweet-ass-ride into high gear. He
did not hear my correction of grammar.
These are the kind of people I see driving
this car.
Now admittedly, the SUV will come in
handy for going up to Tahoe in the winter
time for my ridiculously WASPy hobby of
downhill skiing. But the guilt is going to get to
me. This isn't the guilt I feel for kicking

wiener dogs or telling people that I heard Ra
diohead was breaking up. This is a lingering
feeling,something like:**l know lam partial
ly and directly contributing to fucking up this
planet."
1 feel like polar bears are going to meet me
in a parking lot one night and just beat the liv
ing hell out of me. These won't be guys in
polar bear suits, but actual bears with brass
knuckles for some reason. In the corner, A 1
Gore plays the violin. They are pissed that I
am destroying the ice caps.They also want my
lunch money. I have strange dreams.
I wouldn't blame the polar bears at this
point. 1 have it coming to me. I mean we all
have it coming to us to a certain degree.There
are plenty of SU Vs on this campus, plenty of
people who don't recycle. There are smaller
sins too. Like at dinner, when you don't finish
your pot brownies. God cries. When we waste
valuable digital trees by continually emailing
about dorm meetings â€” I die a little inside.
Especially if they're from my former dorms
WHO WON'T TAKE ME OFF THEIR
GOD DAMN LISTS.
The Enron execs just got their asses hand
ed to them, which is great because their asses
will have lots of handling where they are
going. Why the hell can't we do the same to
Shell or Exxon? Not guilty of price gouging?

Holt's Harangue
How is it that the government is
monitoring my downloading of
music but can't monitor the meet
ings where a bunch of white balding
oil executives are smoking cigars
and sitting on chairs made of poor
people? Maybe noise doesn't travel
very well in the west wing because
while the government might be deaf,
even I can hear the party in Cheney's
office. Maybe they are having diffi
culty differentiating the good guys
from this week's scapegoats.
1 think to a certain degree a lot of
society is having that problem. Our
government is a circus, not the cool

French-Canadian kind where they
juggle dolphins while smoking ciga
rettes underwater but the over-the
top American kind where we can't
tell the ringleaders from the clowns.
We've all got our hands in their mess
too because of our reliance on oil.
Americans need to do a lot to make
amends to the world for our sins
against the environment. Personally,
I'm going to undergo some self flag
ellation to clear my conscience. I'll
watch A 1 Gore's new flick. I'll hug a
tree. I'll only kick vegan puppies.
I'm going to do my part to align
myself on the side of good, so when
the polar bears come, they'll just eat
the roommate.

Chris hopes his roommate treated you
citizens right in his absence. Send
