The Daily's "Through My Eyes" series on
the women's tennis team wraps up this week
with senior co-captain Alice Barnes. An art his
tory major from Cambridge, England, Barnes
was last year's NCAA doubles champion along
2005 graduate Erin Burdette and was the
NCAA Tournament's Most Outstanding Play
er each of the past three seasons. She reflects on
her third NCAA team championship, the
team's dynamic and four years on the Farm.
Bittersweet threepeat
The tennis turned out exactly how we want
ed, but I guess I just didn't realize how sad it was
going to be. I remember when we won and
everyone does the dogpile, and everyone's like
"Yay." And then all the seniors started crying.
We're supposed to be happy — and we were
happy — but I guess I just wasn't entirely pre
pared for how upset I was going to be.
I knew I was going to be sad to leave Stan
ford, but when it's finally all over it's just so
shocking to think you're never going to put the
uniform on again, never play in a team match
again. Little things, like you're never going to go
to Jimmy V's before a match again, never go on
a road trip again. But that has to happen and it
has to happen to everybody,so I'd much rather
it happen after a win than after a loss. It could
n't have worked out better.
Future mooch
My fallback plan for next year — although
this could turn into my main plan — is I'm
going to be Joanna Kao's personal assistant.
She's going to be I-banking in New York and
she's totally clueless, and in a big city 1 think she
probably needs someone with a little bit of com
mon sense to help her out. So I'm going to be
her personal assistant and she's going to give me
10 percent of everything she owns. /Kao shouts
from the adjacent room, " Then help me with my
homework now,Al!"J
Failing that. I'm going to do a premed year
and go to med school. But we've agreed on

some sort of system where she'll sponsor me
through med school. So shell pay for my flights
over here. And 1 think I'm taking five percent
just for being emotional support. I Kao inter
jects, "Whaaaa?"] During the times of day that
she'll be awake. I figure that I'll probably be
awake. No one else in America will be awake
since she'll be working ridiculous hours. So I'll
provide emotional support and take my five
percent. That's my plan and 1 think it will work
quite well.
Dream team
I just really am going to miss them all a lot.
They're all very different. I guess I'm the last
person to go with this series, so anybody who
has been reading it will have seen how different
everybody else is. Everybody has her own
humor, brings something different to the team.
And the freshmen just fitted in so well — fitted
is a word in England, by the way, but I don't
think people over here count it as a word so
don't put it in or else I'll sound stupid! [Sorry, we
couldn't help ourselves.]
I'll really miss being around a bunch of peo
ple who are all going for a common goal. We're
all so different and yet we all manage to bond
over this one thing that we're headed for. And
it's going to go way beyond the tennis. I may be
off the team now.but I'm still going to be harass
ing them every day. I'm going to be watching
them online. I've got this plan where we're
going got have some secret wave or signal or
dance, and they can do it for the camera because
I can guarantee you that I will be spending
hours upon hours stalking them, watching them
over the live feed.
I'm just going to miss everybody, and it's
more the day-to-day stuff.The national champi
onships. you know they're nice and everything
but that's not what you're going to miss. Any
body who's on the team can tell you that that's
one of the most stressful times of the year. What
you'll miss are the jokes in the team room, the
funny stories told at practice, the practical jokes
pulled on the road. Winning matches — that
I'm sure I'll forget pretty quickly, but I don't
think I'll forget my teammates any time soon.

Just keep coming back for more
Someone was asking me, how do you think
Stanford tennis has such a great tradition, and I
think a big part of that is that we bring the
alumni back year after year. It just gives you
such confidence to see that everyone still cares
so much. You've got Laura Granville in the
stands, who is top 50 in the world. It makes you
think that there must be something worth play
ing for and that you're part of something bigger
than yourself.
It really gives you a sense that you care so
much, it means so much to be on the team — 1
mean that's why all the seniors were crying
after the championship match last week — and
it's just nice to know that it means that much to
other people too. You know when they come
back it's like, "OK, we're not the only idiots
who care this much, everybody cares this much
— so much so that they just keep coming back
and keep coming back."
I'll definitely be back myself, and I'm going
to be obnoxious in those crowds. I feel like be
cause I have an English accent, people think
that I'm supposed to be somewhat sophisticat
ed— even though that's just not true at all.
And as a player, you're on court; you kind of
have to behave yourself. But put me in the
stands and I'm going to be the most obnoxious
fan. heckling the teams and all the coaches I've
wanted to heckle throughout the years. Also, I
am convinced that I am going to see a Big

Game won at some point. I've seen four losses
and that kind of sucked, so if it looks like we
have a shot at winning, I'll be on a flight back
out here.
It's who you know..
1 didn't really have the most conventional
high school. I was home schooled for the last
three years of it and was so used to just knowing
people who played tennis, so I remember getting
to Stanford and just being amazed at how well
rounded everyone was.They don't even have to
have done anything particularly spectacular, but
they've all done so much. 1 mean if you look at
our draw group, you've got Jo and me getting
sick of each other on the tennis team, but there's
more to us too. I mean. 1 know she's Chinese, but
she speaks Chinese. How cool is that? And she
plays that Chinese instrument, what's it called.
Jo? [Kao calls out something unintelligible.] And
you write for The Daily! And I know you take
that for granted, don't see it as a big deal. But
what seems like little things to the people who
do them are just so cool to everyone else.
That's the thing about Stanford, people here
will always amaze you. I'm just going to miss the
sheer diversity here. Not the weather — though
I am going to get so rained on in England. I had
a pretty boring life before Stanford. I only knew
tennis players, and now I just have so many
memories of times spent with all of my ab
solutely impressive friends.

er each of the past three seasons. She reflects on
her third NCAA team championship, the
team's dynamic and four years on the Farm.
Bittersweet threepeat
The tennis turned out exactly how we want
ed, but I guess I just didn't realize how sad it was
going to be. I remember when we won and
everyone does the dogpile, and everyone's like
"Yay." And then all the seniors started crying.
We're supposed to be happy — and we were
happy — but I guess I just wasn't entirely pre
pared for how upset I was going to be.
I knew I was going to be sad to leave Stan
ford, but when it's finally all over it's just so
shocking to think you're never going to put the
uniform on again, never play in a team match
again. Little things, like you're never going to go
to Jimmy V's before a match again, never go on
a road trip again. But that has to happen and it
has to happen to everybody,so I'd much rather
it happen after a win than after a loss. It could
n't have worked out better.
Future mooch
My fallback plan for next year — although
this could turn into my main plan — is I'm
going to be Joanna Kao's personal assistant.
She's going to be I-banking in New York and
she's totally clueless, and in a big city 1 think she
probably needs someone with a little bit of com
mon sense to help her out. So I'm going to be
her personal assistant and she's going to give me
10 percent of everything she owns. /Kao shouts
from the adjacent room, " Then help me with my
homework now,Al!"J
Failing that. I'm going to do a premed year
and go to med school. But we've agreed on

some sort of system where she'll sponsor me
through med school. So shell pay for my flights
over here. And 1 think I'm taking five percent
just for being emotional support. I Kao inter
jects, "Whaaaa?"] During the times of day that
she'll be awake. I figure that I'll probably be
awake. No one else in America will be awake
since she'll be working ridiculous hours. So I'll
provide emotional support and take my five
percent. That's my plan and 1 think it will work
quite well.
Dream team
I just really am going to miss them all a lot.
They're all very different. I guess I'm the last
person to go with this series, so anybody who
has been reading it will have seen how different
everybody else is. Everybody has her own
humor, brings something different to the team.
And the freshmen just fitted in so well — fitted
is a word in England, by the way, but I don't
think people over here count it as a word so
don't put it in or else I'll sound stupid! [Sorry, we
couldn't help ourselves.]
I'll really miss being around a bunch of peo
ple who are all going for a common goal. We're
all so different and yet we all manage to bond
over this one thing that we're headed for. And
it's going to go way beyond the tennis. I may be
off the team now.but I'm still going to be harass
ing them every day. I'm going to be watching
them online. I've got this plan where we're
going got have some secret wave or signal or
dance, and they can do it for the camera because
I can guarantee you that I will be spending
hours upon hours stalking them, watching them
over the live feed.
I'm just going to miss everybody, and it's
more the day-to-day stuff.The national champi
onships. you know they're nice and everything
but that's not what you're going to miss. Any
body who's on the team can tell you that that's
one of the most stressful times of the year. What
you'll miss are the jokes in the team room, the
funny stories told at practice, the practical jokes
pulled on the road. Winning matches — that
I'm sure I'll forget pretty quickly, but I don't
think I'll forget my teammates any time soon.

Just keep coming back for more
Someone was asking me, how do you think
Stanford tennis has such a great tradition, and I
think a big part of that is that we bring the
alumni back year after year. It just gives you
such confidence to see that everyone still cares
so much. You've got Laura Granville in the
stands, who is top 50 in the world. It makes you
think that there must be something worth play
ing for and that you're part of something bigger
than yourself.
It really gives you a sense that you care so
much, it means so much to be on the team — 1
mean that's why all the seniors were crying
after the championship match last week — and
it's just nice to know that it means that much to
other people too. You know when they come
back it's like, "OK, we're not the only idiots
who care this much, everybody cares this much
— so much so that they just keep coming back
and keep coming back."
I'll definitely be back myself, and I'm going
to be obnoxious in those crowds. I feel like be
cause I have an English accent, people think
that I'm supposed to be somewhat sophisticat
ed— even though that's just not true at all.
And as a player, you're on court; you kind of
have to behave yourself. But put me in the
stands and I'm going to be the most obnoxious
fan. heckling the teams and all the coaches I've
wanted to heckle throughout the years. Also, I
am convinced that I am going to see a Big

Game won at some point. I've seen four losses
and that kind of sucked, so if it looks like we
have a shot at winning, I'll be on a flight back
out here.
It's who you know..
1 didn't really have the most conventional
high school. I was home schooled for the last
three years of it and was so used to just knowing
people who played tennis, so I remember getting
to Stanford and just being amazed at how well
rounded everyone was.They don't even have to
have done anything particularly spectacular, but
they've all done so much. 1 mean if you look at
our draw group, you've got Jo and me getting
sick of each other on the tennis team, but there's
more to us too. I mean. 1 know she's Chinese, but
she speaks Chinese. How cool is that? And she
plays that Chinese instrument, what's it called.
Jo? [Kao calls out something unintelligible.] And
you write for The Daily! And I know you take
that for granted, don't see it as a big deal. But
what seems like little things to the people who
do them are just so cool to everyone else.
That's the thing about Stanford, people here
will always amaze you. I'm just going to miss the
sheer diversity here. Not the weather — though
I am going to get so rained on in England. I had
a pretty boring life before Stanford. I only knew
tennis players, and now I just have so many
memories of times spent with all of my ab
solutely impressive friends.
