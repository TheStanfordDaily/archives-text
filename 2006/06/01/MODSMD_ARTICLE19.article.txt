## Nascent archery program takes third at nationals 
### CALEY ANDERSON DESK EDITOR 
Not many sports teams are frequently asked
whether or not they shoot squirrels. Suffice it to say
Stanford's archery program is unique, and deservedly
so.
At the U.S. Intercollegiate Archery Champi
onships, held May 18-21, the women's recurve team
won the national championship, and the program fin
ished third overall — in just its fourth year of exis
tence. And by clawing tooth and nail with more than
30 teams, including well-established varsity programs
like Texas A&M, James Madison. Columbia and the
University of Texas, Stanford earned its peers' re
spect.
"In the gold medal match of the women's recurve
team competition, [the women] went against Texas
A&M. the New York Yankees of collegiate archery,
who have won 11 straight overall national champi
onships." junior Calvin Hwang said. "To see all the
other teams cheering us on and rooting us to victory
— that was amazing."
The women's recurve team, senior Shanna Erick
son. juniors Sandra and Phoebe Suen and soph
omore Elizabeth Reuman, downed Columbia in the
semifinals before sneaking past Texas A&M in the fi
nals, 177-174.
The program's success at nationals — the mixed
recurve team finished third and the men's recurve
team finished fourth — marked the capstone to an al
ready successful season. In April, Stanford took the
West Regional Collegiate Outdoor Championships,
with both the women's and mixed recurve teams
sweeping the top spots, and the men's recurve finish
ing second.
The strong finishes didn't come by themselves
though. Team members admit they have devoted
enormous effort to their club sport.
"We went from finishing ninth last year [at Nation
als) to third this year." said Hwang. "It was an enor
mous jump. What is great about archery is that your
performance and success is directly related to the
amount of work you put in. Natural talent
plays a very small role."
Ilie addition of freshmen compound shoot
ers Spencer Feck and Fei Zhang and the
reemergence of Suen, who took last year off,
also helped explain the Card's ascent to the top.
"[Suen] gave the women's recurve team
the extra shooting push it needed to bring
home the championship," Hwang said.
Such accomplishments are becoming the
mark of Stanford's club sports program, and
the archery team is only happy to add to the
list of achievements.
"There is a strong tradition of excellence in
the club sports program, as evidenced by the
success of the women's rugby and ultimate
frisbee teams, to name a few," said Hwang.
"Stanford archery really continues that trend
of success."
Although the program, like the rest of the
club teams, has to put in the time and effort to
fundraise, it does garner support from the Ath
letic Department and is one of the few schools
in the nation with a dedicated archery range.
And, in the spirit of Stanford club sports,
the archery program is open to all Stanford af
filiates. The team is coached by current US.
Olympic coach Sheri Rhodes, and beginners
are welcomed — no equipment or experience
necessary.
"All team members, save one, did not have
prior experience before joining the team,"
said Hwang. "We provide all of the equip
ment and training. And we do more than just
shoot arrows —we go on retreats, watch
movies, cook together and build lasting
friendships."
Just don't aim for any squirrels.
