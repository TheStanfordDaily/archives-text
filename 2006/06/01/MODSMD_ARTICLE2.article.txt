# Nuke czar speaks about Iran
## ElBaradei encourages Iran-U.S. dialogue about nuclear nonproliferation 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
Mohamed Elßaradei, the director of the
International Atomic Energy Agency
(lAEA), welcomed the American offer
made yesterday to talk directly with Iran
about its nuclear weapons program. Elßa
radei, the 2005 winner of the Nobel Peace
Prize,told a crowd in Memorial Auditorium
yesterday afternoon that he sees "on both
sides a desire to reach a settlement."
In a significant policy reversal. Secretary
of State Condoleezza Rice announced yes
terday morning that the United States
would join multilateral negotiations with
the Europeans and Iranians on the condi
tion that Iran suspends its uranium enrich

ment reprocessing activities and allows
lAEA inspectors into the country.
"I have been talking to Secretary Rice,
and I see a clear commitment by the U.S. to
find a diplomatic solution to the Iranian
issue for a variety of reasons," Elßaradei
said.
"I spoke today with the Iranian Nation
al Security Advisor urging him to seize that
opportunity," he added. "Of course, they
are somewhat unhappy with the tone of the
statement, but my advice was to focus on
the message."
As the conflict has intensified, Elßa
radei has perhaps spent more time than
anyone else with senior American and Iran
ian leaders, who have not spoken directly or
had formal diplomatic ties with each other
since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
With the high-stakes negotiations seem
ingly about to enter Act Two, Elßaradei
said an agreement was both necessary and
possible. He said he hoped a balance could
recognize Iran's right to develop nuclear
energy for peaceful purposes while sus
pending its attempts to enrich weapons
grade uranium.

"Against all odds, I am optimistic that ul
timately we will find a solution," he said.
"This is a problem that has been going on
for 50 years. There is a lot of grievances
[sic]. However, I think both sides realize
they need to cohabitate.The only solution is
a negotiated one perceived by everyone to
be fair."
A sticking point in any direct negotia
tions will be Iran's right to continue its nu
clear program.
"7Tie big ticket item is this suspension of
the research within Iran," he said. "We
should be able to find a solution to that."
A week before the 25th anniversary of
Israel's preemptive strike on Iraq's Osirak
nuclear reactor, the diplomat sharply re
buked the use of force as a viable option to
respond to Iran's aggressive uranium-en
richment program.
"I don't think there's a military solution
because you cannot bomb the knowledge
that has already been achieved," he said.
"Force does not solve problems. In fact, in
many cases, it creates additional problems."

Mohamed Elßaradei, the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the winner of the
2005 Nobel Peace Prize, spoke to a half-full Memorial Auditorium yesterday afternoon.
He downplayed concerns that harsh
rhetoric coming out of Tehran and Wash
ington could undermine diplomacy.
"If you're in the business I'm in for 40
years, you know how to separate the
wheat from the chaff," he said." Iliere's a
lot of rhetoric from both sides. But we
need to always distinguish between pub
lic diplomacy, as you call it, and real
diplomacy. Public diplomacy sometimes
is not a reflection of what is going on be
hind closed doors.
"My business is to listen to what is
happening behind closed doors and tell
people to lower the pitch in [their] public

diplomacy because sometimes it isn't
helping," he added.
l"he world's fourth largest exporter of
oil, Iran — which was included in Presi
dent George W. Bush's 2(X)2 Axis of Kvil
— has proven itself to be America's most
difficult counterweight in the turbulent
Middle East.
"Iran has a lot of influence that could
be used positively or negatively in Iraq,
Afghanistan. Syria, Libya and the Pales
tinian territory," Elßaradei said.
He predicted a nuclear arms race —
what he termed a "cascading effect" — if
Iran progresses with its weapons pro
gram.
"If you had Iran develop nuclear
weapons, you'd see a much more agitat
ed Middle East with a lot more coun
tries trying to develop nuclear
weapons," he said.
