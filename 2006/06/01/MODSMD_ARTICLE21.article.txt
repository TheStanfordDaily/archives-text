# Secondchance Ricky
## 
### 
Is anyone else suddenly very inter
ested in watching the Canadian
Football League next year?
Over the weekend, troubled
Miami Dolphins running back Ricky
Williams signed a one-year deal with
the Toronto Argonauts of the CFL,
and will compete for the Grey Cup
this year. Beyond a doubt, he'll be the
most well-known player in the foot
ball world to take his game north of
the border since the recently retired
Doug "Flutie Flakes" Flutie, and
maybe vicariously I'll get to experi
ence the dream.
You know the one I'm talking
about. If you've ever played youth
league sports and moved to a higher
level of competition in high school or
college, you've wondered at some
point what it would be like to go back
—to experience the lower level of
competition at your now markedly in
creased level of prowess. It's not just
an amateur thing either. I've heard
Brett Favre say in an NFL Films pro
duction that he sometimes wished he
could go back and play Pop-Warner
level ball for a game or two.
Because as much as we as fans and
athletes hunger to see true competi
tion between relative equals — this
year's fantastic USC-Texas Rose
Bowl, the 2(X)1 Rams-Patriots Super
Bowl, the seven-game curse-ending
2004 ALCS between the Yanks and
Sox — occasionally it's also fun to see
complete domination and have the
feeling that you really are witnessing
true greatness.
Think about Roger Clemens on a
good day or Barry Bonds before you
thought he was on 'roids. Think about
Vince Young's end-game perform
ance against USC or Reggie Bush's
against Fresno State.Think about UC-
Davis vs. Stanford (wow, that joke was
painful).
Now think about Ricky Williams in
the CFL. He'll be competing against
the undrafted and unwanted leavings
of the NFL. players who couldn't
make any of 32 NFL rosters. Then
think about the dreadlocked night
mares that will be haunting so many of
those players' sleep this year.
You know. I think I just might actu
ally be tempted to watch some of
those games, and I can barely bear to
watch my own lowly Niners take the
field because of the team's woeful tal
ent level. I just really want to see that
"man among boys" kind of perform
ance that even Ricky should be capa
ble of laying on his gridiron brethren
to the north.
Which is exactly why no one should
be disappointed if Ricky never comes
back. Well, no one except Ricky that is.
See, this way you get the fun of seeing
Ricky run wild in Canada, and the sat
isfaction of knowing that he'll never
again run wild in the NFL.
Williams is the classic example of
an athlete who has had at least his fair
share of second chances. Fail drug test
after drug test in New Orleans after
alienating your teammates and coach
es and becoming generally disliked at
Texas, despite your southern roots?
No worries,you 'll just get traded to the
Dolphins and be welcomed into a fab
ulous South Beach atmosphere where
your talents will have the chance to be
appreciated all over again.
But of course, then you blow it, "re
tiring" at the young age of 27 to avoid
the embarrassment of having your pos
itive drug tests for marijuana and the
suspension they would incur revealed
to the public. You run out of money, are
welcomed back by a new head coach
— who may in many ways owe his job
to your absence getting the previous
coach fired — and promptly work on
earning a second suspension for the re
peated use of a banned substance.
And now you're in Canada.
If it sounds like Ricky has had his
chances, it's because he has. Most of us
would kill for the kind of talent that
would buy us that many opportunities
to get it right.
I say Ricky's had his chance, and it's
time for someone else to get his. If that
means one more RB who ordinarily
wouldn't get a shot to make a roster
can now earn his living in the NFL, so
much the better.
And besides, I really want to see a
Heisman trophy winner take on some
Canadians.
