# Superfly beats UCLA to win Ultimate Championship
## 
### ANDREW LOMELI STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's club ultimate team
edged UCLA, 15-10, on Sunday to win the
Women's College Ultimate Championship in
Columbus, Ohio.
Sophomore Danielle Piatt connected with
grad student Lauren Casey from 15 yards out
to secure the 15th and final point — and the
national title.
The Stanford Superfly (41-1) jumped to an
early 6-1 lead after converting several UCLA
turnovers into scores. The UCLA Blu pulled
to within 6-4, but Stanford rebounded with the

deep pass to go up 10-5.
Stanford pummeled Wisconsin 15-5 in the
tourney's semifinals after handling Dart
mouth, 15-6, in the quarterfinals. Stanford
went 3-0 in pool play on Friday with a 15-8 vic
tory over Texas, a 15-7 trouncing of Swarth
more and a 15-6 win against British Columbia.
Superfly picked up the first point in each of
their victories, and never trailed in the tourna
ment.
"Each player held their own so we didn't
have to rely on a couple of amazing plays or
players," junior receiver Christina Contreras
said. "We treated every point as if it was our
last, and we just wanted to show the other
teams what we're all about."
Superfly lost just one game this season,
falling to Colorado over spring break. Stan
ford won the Bay Area section before qualify
ing for Nationals out of the Northwest divi
sion, along with UC-Davis and British Colum
bia.
And a scary thought for the competition:
Stanford returns 14 players next season.
