# Club cricket team sets up pitch on Roble Field, adds undergrads to ranks

Cricket season is just barely underway,
but optimism continues to build for the or
ganization's future at Stanford. The recent
addition of cricket grounds to Roble Field
has energized the club, and attracting un
dergraduate interest to a degree never seen
before.
"I've been here for 14 years,so I've seen a
huge difference from last year and having
the grounds back to the year 1 came in."
Stanford alum Rohan Chandran said. "Un
less you were really passionate about the
game, you wouldn't even know we had a
cricket club here at Stanford — 1 had to dig
around to find out how to get involved —
and now we're right out in the open, so real
ly it's a huge difference. You can ride down
Santa Teresa and see people playing cricket
on Roble, and word gets around quickly."
According to second-year grad student
Piyush Shanker, the new facilities have even
changed the team's goals.
"The focus in the past has been building
two solid competitive teams for the league,"

Shanker said. "But now, with more under
graduate members, we're also looking at
building a pretty active social game. These
are members who don't want to go out every
weekend and play the game,but they can still
go out there and have a good time."
And in many respects, it's the social as
pects of cricket that make it such an interest
ing and vibrant section of the Stanford sport
ing scene. Drawing mainly from internation
al students, grad students and alums from
India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, the Stanford
Cricket Club provides a way to stay in touch
with the cricket passion they left in their
home countries.
"1 think a big part of its appeal is cultur
al." Shanker said. "Like a big part of Ameri
can culture here is football, cricket is almost
a religion [in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and
India]."
And with the new grounds at Roble Field,
that community is growing.
"I think there's been a team here for 30 or
40 years in different guises, but it's never
been a really big undergraduate sport here,"
Chandran said. "1 actually came to Stanford
as an undergrad in the early '90s, and our af
filiation with club sports wasn't as strong as
it should have been — we were kind of there
in name but not in spirit. I think what we've
worked to do over time is to really establish
ourselves as a Stanford entity, and 1 think
we're definitely succeeding in that."
Of course, that's not to say the new play
ers won't help in league competition.
"We've got a whole bunch of new under
grads this year, which we haven't had for a
long time," Chandran said. "We're getting a
lot more of that fringe interest, and other
wise we'd really just have a small group of
hardcore guys, and you can't really run a club
with just half a dozen hardcore players."
As far as the general perception of crick
et in America, though, Shanker believes
there are still plenty of misconceptions.
"It's not a lazy man's game," Shanker
said. "I think that's a common impression.
You know, if you talk to somebody about it
on the street, they might say, 'Oh. you play
for a full day and stop for tea in the middle.'
but if you actually get to know the game
better, it is very intense and physical. I
guess it's probably a lot like if you talk to a
foreigner about American football. I would
say the perception of cricket is something
like that."
Stanford Cricket's first team is currently
2-2, and next faces Valley on Sunday, June 4
at Roble Field.
