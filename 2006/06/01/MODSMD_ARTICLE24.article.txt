# Correction
## 
### 
In yesterday's coverage of the
men's and women's crew teams.
The Daily made several errors.
First, men's crew is not a NCAA
sport. Second, Craig
Amerkhanian requested that
freshman rower Mark Murphy
be considered a "great first-year
rower." Third, 11th place is not
the women's team's all-time
best finish. It is actually their
worst. The all-time best per
formances that occurred last
weekend were in the individual
races.The Daily regrets that the
third error appeared in a head
line and would like to apologize
to the team.
