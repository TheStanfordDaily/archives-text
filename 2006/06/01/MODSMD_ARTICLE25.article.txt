## GSC discusses committee on diversity, Exec. Cabinet 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
In its penultimate meeting of the year last
night, the Graduate Student Council (GSC) ap
proved appointments by the Nominations
Commission and discussed a possible joint-res
olution with the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
regarding diversity
Early in the meeting, ASSU President Eliza
beth Heng and Vice President Lauren Graham,
both juniors, presented a bill to confirm the
ASSU Executive Cabinet.
According to Heng, 38 students applied and
interviewed for Cabinet positions and 10 were
selected. These 10 students include six Cabinet
members, as well as an ASSU historian, web
master and two directors of marketing and

outreach.
The Executive Cabinet will meet for one or
two hours every week, and cabinet members
will pursue their own projects and initiatives.
The bill passed by consensus
Cullen Buie, co-chair of the GSC Diversity
Committee and a doctoral student in mechani
cal engineering, then proposed a Diversity
Committee resolution to the Council. The res
olution would be made jointly with the Under
graduate Senate.
Buie said he wanted the ASSU to take a
more formal and opinionated stance and that ul
timately the organization would draft a docu
ment on which both the Undergraduate Senate
and the GSC would agree.
Buie spoke about ideas the Senate proposed,
including a University-wide five-year plan to in

crease diversity. Currently, no such plan exists
In addition, the resolution would make di
versity a big priority for the newly-created Vice
Provost of Graduate Education, reaffirming the
University's interest in maintaining diversity in
the student body as well as the faculty.
Buie also proposed a Faculty Senate commit
tee on diversity.
"There is currently no report on graduate stu
dent diversity, so the Faculty Senate may never
see this information," he said. "We should look at
it yearly."
Tom Lee, a fourth-year doctoral student in
electrical engineering and former GSC co-chair,
suggested that the ASSU should decide what it
will do to address diversity
"It shows we're actually willing to put some
effort behind it,"he said.

Specifically, Lee said the ASSU should focus
on programming and funding, calling them "the
two big strings that we could pull."
Such programming might include recruiting
events and other events that would help retain
minority and female graduate students, Lee said.
Rebecca Kaplan, a first-year student in the
Graduate School of Business, suggested sur
veying current students for their thoughts on
diversity
Any proposed diversity resolution would not
be drafted until next fall, however, because the
Senate will not meet again this spring.
The GSC also approved the new student
representatives on University committees.
These students applied and interviewed for po
sitions, before being selected by the ASSU
Nominations Commission.
