# Morris Signs with Washington
## Sharpshooting Drew Shiller transfers in; Tony Fuller to Arizona high school 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
For Stanford men's basketball, the madness came two
months late. After missing March Madness — the NCAA
Tournament — for the first time since 1994, three major de
velopments have made this May one of the craziest months
of the offseason.
Outgoing transfer Tim Morris has signed on with Pac-10
rival Washington: Josh Shiller, a sharpshooter from the Uni
versity of San Francisco, will be transferring to Stanford
next season; and seven-year assistant coach Tony Fuller is
leaving to coach an Arizona high school.
"Style of play" leads Morris to Washington, cousin Romar
Morris, a redshirt sophomore last season, told the Seattle
Times that Stanford's "style of play just wasn't the best fit
for me" in explaining the decision to sign with Coach Loren
zo Romar, his second cousin, and the Washington Huskies.
Sure enough, the quick, athletic 6-foot-4, 215-pound
Morris found one of the nation's most up-tempo teams in
Washington. Last season, the Huskies averaged 82 points,
easily tops in the Pac-10. That's more than 15 points per
game better than Stanford, which traditionally runs a slow
er, more structured offense.
Last season, Morris managed just five points and 3.1
boards per game for Stanford, shooting just 17 percent be
yond the arc and 42 percent from the line.
Morris will sit out next year per
NCAA transfer rules, and then will have
2007-08 as his final year of eligibility.
And though it's nearly two years away,
he's already anticipating his return to the
Maples hardwood.
"That will be interesting," Morris told
the Seattle Times. "I'll be curious to see
what kind of reception I'll get."
Shiller takes Morris' slot
Freshman Drew Shiller will transfer to
the Farm to fill the roster opening that
Morris' departure created. Shiller, a 6-
foot, 185-pound sharp-shooting guard,
scored 4.4 points per game on 37 percent
three-point accuracy off the bench in his
one season at San Francisco.
Stanford recruited Shiller in high
school, but never offered him a full schol
arship. Now. with Morris' departure and
expectations of weaker recruiting classes
the next two seasons, the high school foot
ball, basketball and baseball star out of
Burlingame, Calif, has earned a full ride to
his "dream school," according to the San
Francisco Chronicle.
Like Morris, Shiller will have to sit out
next year as a transfer, but will be eligible
as a redshirt sophomore in 2007-08. And
just like Morris, Shiller is counting down
the days.
"The academic rigor at Stanford is
going to be very challenging," he told the

Chronicle. "And I'll have a chance to
work on my body and my game, to get to
the level 1 need to be at to compete. I'm
chomping at the bit."
Fuller leaves coaching ranks thinner
Seven-year assistant coach Tony Fuller
has taken the head coaching position at
Brophy Prep, an Arizona Jesuit high
school.
Fuller becomes the second coach to
leave the basketball program this offsea
son. following in the footsteps of nine
year assistant Eric Reveno, now the head
man at the University of Portland.
Twelve-year Stanford assistant Doug
Oliver, returning after a eight-year ab
sence from the Farm, and younger staff
members Donny Guerinoni (assistant)
and Nick Robinson (director of basket
ball operations) figure to pick up the
slack.
Fuller, 47, had been a head coach at
San Diego State and Pepperdine from
1992-%, and had longed to return to the
head coaching ranks for years. He was a
finalist for the position at the University
of North Dakota when he accepted the
post at a high school that is among the top
in its state both athletically and academi
cally.
"1 see it as a great opportunity." Fuller
told the Arizona Republic. "I'm excited
about it."
