# Morris Signs with Washington
## Sharpshooting Drew Shiller transfers in; Tony Fuller to Arizona high school 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
For Stanford men's basketball, the madness came two
months late. After missing March Madness — the NCAA
Tournament — for the first time since 1994, three major de
velopments have made this May one of the craziest months
of the offseason.
Outgoing transfer Tim Morris has signed on with Pac-10
rival Washington: Josh Shiller, a sharpshooter from the Uni
versity of San Francisco, will be transferring to Stanford
next season; and seven-year assistant coach Tony Fuller is
leaving to coach an Arizona high school.
"Style of play" leads Morris to Washington, cousin Romar
Morris, a redshirt sophomore last season, told the Seattle
Times that Stanford's "style of play just wasn't the best fit
for me" in explaining the decision to sign with Coach Loren
zo Romar, his second cousin, and the Washington Huskies.
Sure enough, the quick, athletic 6-foot-4, 215-pound
Morris found one of the nation's most up-tempo teams in
Washington. Last season, the Huskies averaged 82 points,
easily tops in the Pac-10. That's more than 15 points per
game better than Stanford, which traditionally runs a slow
er, more structured offense.
Last season, Morris managed just five points and 3.1
boards per game for Stanford, shooting just 17 percent be
yond the arc and 42 percent from the line.
