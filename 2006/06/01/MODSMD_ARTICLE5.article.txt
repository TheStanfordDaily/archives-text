## ElBaradei discusses nuclear energy and weapons Nobel Peace Prize winner also talks Iraq, North Korea 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
The nuclear regime in place since the
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) took ef
fect in 1970 is broken and needs to be
fixed, the world's highest-ranking nu
clear official told a half-full Memorial
Auditorium in a wide-ranging lecture
about the future of nuclear energy and

weapons yesterday afternoon.
"We have a dysfunctional system — a
system that cannot endure," said Mo
hamed Elßaradei, the director general
of the International Atomic Energy
Agency (lAEA). "We're reaching the
fork in the road. Events in the last few
years have made it clear that we need to
change course."
The big news from Elßaradei's
speech was his support for American en
treaties to Iran. But the 2005 Nobel
Peace Prize recipient also commented
on North Korea, India, Pakistan. Iraq,
terrorism,disarmament and the future of

nuclear energy.
He said there are probably eight cur
rent nuclear states, excluding North
Korea. He worried aloud that countries
which can currently produce nuclear en
ergy peacefully are only six months away
from developing nuclear weapons for
military purposes.
"Acquiring the technology to enrich
uranium or reprocess uranium basically
is the key to develop nuclear weapons as
we have seen in Asia and Iran," he said.
"They are virtually weapons states be
cause in six months time if they decide
for security reasons to develop their own

weapon, they are there."
IRAQ
While not a household name, Elßa
radei was a prominent figure in the news
as the lead weapons inspector in Iraq
during the run-up to the 2003 American
invasion. He said at the time that he
could not find evidence of Iraqi weapons
of mass destruction, but he would not
conclude that there were no weapons in
the country or that Saddam Hussein did
not have a program.
Elßaradei asked for more time to
complete inspections, but the Bush
administration declined his request
and decided to invade. ITie U.S.
never found the nuclear and biologi
cal material that some had promised
existed.
"Luckily...well I'm not sure lucki
ly...we were proven right that there
was no nuclear or any weapon of
mass destruction in Iraq," he said.
"But I hope that all of us have
learned from the Iraq experience
that we cannot just jump the gun.
You have to be absolutely sure of the
facts."
INDIA
Elßaradei surprised observers
when he supported the U.S. agree
ment with India earlier this year,
which allowed the country to contin
ue developing nuclear weapons and
energy. He said the agreement with
India did not endorse its prolifera
tion activities but was indicative of
the kind of outside-the-box thinking
the international community needs
when considering the spread of nu
clear weapons and material.
"Ihe end result is India coming
closer and working with the rest of
the world," he said, 'it is not a per
fect agreement, but it has a lot of ad
vantages. From the safety, security
and nonproliferation perspective, I
see that agreement as a win-win situ
ation."
PAKISTAN
Pakistan developed nuclear
weapons as a response to India.
Some have criticized Pakistan for its
poor stewardship and control of the
bomb, pointing out that weapons
were almost fired during a skirmish
over the disputed Kashmir region.
AO Kahn, a senior nuclear scien
tist who helped Pakistan join the ex
clusive nuclear club, was caught sell
ing compact discs and other infor
mation about bombs to several other
countries.
"How much damage was done in
the process we don't know." Elßa
radei said.
ITie release of this nuclear mate
rial demonstrates the need for a
"more robust verification system,"
he said, adding that Pakistan has
come closer to the international
community in recent years.
NORTH KOREA
Kim Jong II expelled all lAEA in
spectors in Dec. 2002, withdrew from
the NPT in Jan. 2003 and announced
in February 2005 that his military
had a nuclear deterrent.
"North Korea is still a major
problem," Elßaradei said."We don't
talk about it enough, but North
Korea is declaring right now that
they have a nuclear weapon. And the
longer that they continue to be in
that status, the more it is accepted in

the collective conscious. This would
be terrible because it will have a lot
of negative ramifications in South
Korea and Japan."
Elßaradei said ongoing negotia
tions are an important development
but more needs to be done.
"What we see with the current
six-party talks should have taken
place years ago." he said.
NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION
Elßaradei stressed that he under
stands the value of nuclear power,
which produces much of the devel
oped world's energy Reducing its
use would create more dependence
on greenhouse gas-creating fossil
fuels, he said.
"We need to use nuclear energy
responsibly to maximize benefit and
minimize risk." he said.
lie said his "number one night
mare scenario" is a terrorist group
acquiring nuclear technology since
terrorists are not deterred by the
possibility of reprisal.
In the post-Cold War world, El-
Baradei said lie could see no justifi
cation for the U.S. and Russia to
maintain their nuclear arsenals on
ready alert to fire with thirty minutes
notice. I le called on America to lead
by example and continue to disarm
its nuclear stockpile.
"Rather than pass judgment, I'd
definitely like to say the U.S. should
do more in leading by example in
terms of nuclear disarmament," he
said.
In September 2005, Elßaradei
was reappointed to a third term as
director general of lAEA. The Unit
ed States had considered holding up
his nomination but dropped its ob
jections under pressure from Euro
pean allies, who admire the former
law professor from New York Uni
versity.
DIPLOMAT TO THE CORE
Ilie Egyptian native's sometimes
broken English was interspersed
with self-corrections and careful
legalese nuance. Elßaradei an
swered questions posed by Political
Science Prof. Scott Sagan, the direc
tor of the Center for International
Security and Cooperation.
When Sagan made bold pro
nouncements about different coun
try's nuclear activities, including the
United States' "colossal failure"
when North Korea violated the NPT
Elßaradei seemed careful not to
point fingers, play the blame game or
make enemies. Nonetheless, for a
senior United Nations official, his
speech was notably blunt.
" Ibere's no international public
servant whose integrity and work I
admire more than yours," Sagan told
Elßaradei.
Accompanied by his wife, Elßa
radei spent the day at the University
visiting with faculty and students. He
spoke at a lunch sponsored by the
Freeman Spogli Institute for Inter
national Studies and traveled to
Sagan's home for a dinner with invit
ed guests. He left the area at 8:30
p.m.

"How much damage was done in
the process we don't know." Elßa
radei said.
ITie release of this nuclear mate
rial demonstrates the need for a
"more robust verification system,"
he said, adding that Pakistan has
come closer to the international
community in recent years.
NORTH KOREA
Kim Jong II expelled all lAEA in
spectors in Dec. 2002, withdrew from
the NPT in Jan. 2003 and announced
in February 2005 that his military
had a nuclear deterrent.
"North Korea is still a major
problem," Elßaradei said."We don't
talk about it enough, but North
Korea is declaring right now that
they have a nuclear weapon. And the
longer that they continue to be in
that status, the more it is accepted in

the collective conscious. This would
be terrible because it will have a lot
of negative ramifications in South
Korea and Japan."
Elßaradei said ongoing negotia
tions are an important development
but more needs to be done.
"What we see with the current
six-party talks should have taken
place years ago." he said.
NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION
Elßaradei stressed that he under
stands the value of nuclear power,
which produces much of the devel
oped world's energy Reducing its
use would create more dependence
on greenhouse gas-creating fossil
fuels, he said.
"We need to use nuclear energy
responsibly to maximize benefit and
minimize risk." he said.
lie said his "number one night
mare scenario" is a terrorist group
acquiring nuclear technology since
terrorists are not deterred by the
possibility of reprisal.
In the post-Cold War world, El-
Baradei said lie could see no justifi
cation for the U.S. and Russia to
maintain their nuclear arsenals on
ready alert to fire with thirty minutes
notice. I le called on America to lead
by example and continue to disarm
its nuclear stockpile.
"Rather than pass judgment, I'd
definitely like to say the U.S. should
do more in leading by example in
terms of nuclear disarmament," he
said.
In September 2005, Elßaradei
was reappointed to a third term as
director general of lAEA. The Unit
ed States had considered holding up
his nomination but dropped its ob
jections under pressure from Euro
pean allies, who admire the former
law professor from New York Uni
versity.
DIPLOMAT TO THE CORE
Ilie Egyptian native's sometimes
broken English was interspersed
with self-corrections and careful
legalese nuance. Elßaradei an
swered questions posed by Political
Science Prof. Scott Sagan, the direc
tor of the Center for International
Security and Cooperation.
When Sagan made bold pro
nouncements about different coun
try's nuclear activities, including the
United States' "colossal failure"
when North Korea violated the NPT
Elßaradei seemed careful not to
point fingers, play the blame game or
make enemies. Nonetheless, for a
senior United Nations official, his
speech was notably blunt.
" Ibere's no international public
servant whose integrity and work I
admire more than yours," Sagan told
Elßaradei.
Accompanied by his wife, Elßa
radei spent the day at the University
visiting with faculty and students. He
spoke at a lunch sponsored by the
Freeman Spogli Institute for Inter
national Studies and traveled to
Sagan's home for a dinner with invit
ed guests. He left the area at 8:30
p.m.
The nuclear regime in place since the
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) took ef
fect in 1970 is broken and needs to be
fixed, the world's highest-ranking nu
clear official told a half-full Memorial
Auditorium in a wide-ranging lecture
about the future of nuclear energy and

weapons yesterday afternoon.
"We have a dysfunctional system — a
system that cannot endure," said Mo
hamed Elßaradei, the director general
of the International Atomic Energy
Agency (lAEA). "We're reaching the
fork in the road. Events in the last few
years have made it clear that we need to
change course."
The big news from Elßaradei's
speech was his support for American en
treaties to Iran. But the 2005 Nobel
Peace Prize recipient also commented
on North Korea, India, Pakistan. Iraq,
terrorism,disarmament and the future of

nuclear energy.
He said there are probably eight cur
rent nuclear states, excluding North
Korea. He worried aloud that countries
which can currently produce nuclear en
ergy peacefully are only six months away
from developing nuclear weapons for
military purposes.
"Acquiring the technology to enrich
uranium or reprocess uranium basically
is the key to develop nuclear weapons as
we have seen in Asia and Iran," he said.
"They are virtually weapons states be
cause in six months time if they decide
for security reasons to develop their own

weapon, they are there."
IRAQ
While not a household name, Elßa
radei was a prominent figure in the news
as the lead weapons inspector in Iraq
during the run-up to the 2003 American
invasion. He said at the time that he
could not find evidence of Iraqi weapons
of mass destruction, but he would not
conclude that there were no weapons in
the country or that Saddam Hussein did
not have a program.
Elßaradei asked for more time to
complete inspections, but the Bush
administration declined his request
and decided to invade. ITie U.S.
never found the nuclear and biologi
cal material that some had promised
existed.
"Luckily...well I'm not sure lucki
ly...we were proven right that there
was no nuclear or any weapon of
mass destruction in Iraq," he said.
"But I hope that all of us have
learned from the Iraq experience
that we cannot just jump the gun.
You have to be absolutely sure of the
facts."
INDIA
Elßaradei surprised observers
when he supported the U.S. agree
ment with India earlier this year,
which allowed the country to contin
ue developing nuclear weapons and
energy. He said the agreement with
India did not endorse its prolifera
tion activities but was indicative of
the kind of outside-the-box thinking
the international community needs
when considering the spread of nu
clear weapons and material.
"Ihe end result is India coming
closer and working with the rest of
the world," he said, 'it is not a per
fect agreement, but it has a lot of ad
vantages. From the safety, security
and nonproliferation perspective, I
see that agreement as a win-win situ
ation."
PAKISTAN
Pakistan developed nuclear
weapons as a response to India.
Some have criticized Pakistan for its
poor stewardship and control of the
bomb, pointing out that weapons
were almost fired during a skirmish
over the disputed Kashmir region.
AO Kahn, a senior nuclear scien
tist who helped Pakistan join the ex
clusive nuclear club, was caught sell
ing compact discs and other infor
mation about bombs to several other
countries.
"How much damage was done in
the process we don't know." Elßa
radei said.
