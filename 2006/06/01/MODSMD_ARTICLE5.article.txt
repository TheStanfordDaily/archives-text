## ElBaradei discusses nuclear energy and weapons Nobel Peace Prize winner also talks Iraq, North Korea 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
The nuclear regime in place since the
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) took ef
fect in 1970 is broken and needs to be
fixed, the world's highest-ranking nu
clear official told a half-full Memorial
Auditorium in a wide-ranging lecture
about the future of nuclear energy and

weapons yesterday afternoon.
"We have a dysfunctional system — a
system that cannot endure," said Mo
hamed Elßaradei, the director general
of the International Atomic Energy
Agency (lAEA). "We're reaching the
fork in the road. Events in the last few
years have made it clear that we need to
change course."
The big news from Elßaradei's
speech was his support for American en
treaties to Iran. But the 2005 Nobel
Peace Prize recipient also commented
on North Korea, India, Pakistan. Iraq,
terrorism,disarmament and the future of

nuclear energy.
He said there are probably eight cur
rent nuclear states, excluding North
Korea. He worried aloud that countries
which can currently produce nuclear en
ergy peacefully are only six months away
from developing nuclear weapons for
military purposes.
"Acquiring the technology to enrich
uranium or reprocess uranium basically
is the key to develop nuclear weapons as
we have seen in Asia and Iran," he said.
"They are virtually weapons states be
cause in six months time if they decide
for security reasons to develop their own

weapon, they are there."
IRAQ
While not a household name, Elßa
radei was a prominent figure in the news
as the lead weapons inspector in Iraq
during the run-up to the 2003 American
invasion. He said at the time that he
could not find evidence of Iraqi weapons
of mass destruction, but he would not
conclude that there were no weapons in
the country or that Saddam Hussein did
not have a program.
