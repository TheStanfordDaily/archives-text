# CONSTRUCTION
## $250M in overhauls underway 
### NICK PARKER DESK EDITOR 
Many students consider construc
tion on campus a übiquitous enterprise.
All year, fences have cordoned off the
Barnum Family Center, located near
the Clock Tower; Stanford Stadium has
been under construction since the end
of the football season; and, perhaps
most noticeably, Wilbur Field was sacri
ficed in the name of a subterranean
parking lot being built in conjunction
with the Munger Graduate Residences.
What many students may not real
ize. however, is that this construction
will continue when exams are over in a
couple weeks. In fact, the pace of work
will increase as hundreds of people will
labor over the summer to complete
various projects around campus in time
for students' arrival at the beginning of
fall quarter.
According to Director of Project
Management Jack Cleary. the $5.3 mil
lion renovation of the Barnum Family
Center will be complete in September.
The building will belong to the School
of Education and will officially be
home to the Barnum Family Center for
School and Community Partnerships.
In the past, the building served as
the campus bookstore from its con
struction in 1913 until 1960, when it be
came the Western Civilization Library
until 1967. The building then housed
the Career Development Center until
a 2001 fire made it uninhabitable.
The $90 million overhaul of Stan
ford Stadium will be finished in time for

the first home game of the 2006 football
season, on Sept. 16 versus Navy. Unlike
the old stadium — which was con
structed in 1921 and had 85,5(X) seats —
the new arena will seat only 50,(XX) but
will situate fans closer to the field.
Roble Hall will be closed this sum
mer for the third and final installment
of the Capital Improvement Project,
which will include upgrades to many
rooms and bathrooms, as well as the
lounge and the theater.These improve
ments will cost $18 million and will be
finished by October, Cleary said.
The $25 million renovation of Old
Union will be finished in December
and will transform the building into a
true student center. After its construc
tion in 1922, Old Union housed multi
ple dining rooms and other student

space, but was converted into adminis
trative offices after the completion of
Tresidder Memorial Union in 1967.
The new Old Union will house a
large living room area, a cafe and space
for ASSU offices and meeting rooms
on the first floor.The Office of Student
Affairs and more student workspace
will occupy the second floor and the
Office of Religious Life will use the
third floor of the building.
In an email to The Daily, Cleary de
tailed the on-campus construction that
will occur over the summer, pointing
out other projects that will begin in the
next couple of months.
