## Demand up for summer housing 
### ADAM WIDMAN STAFF WRITER 
Students planning on living on cam
pus this summer should hop on the
bandwagon. About 1,100 undergradu
ates and 3,500 graduate students will
occupy campus residences at different
times throughout July, August and Sep
tember, said Executive Director of Stu
dent Housing Rodger Whitney.
According to Whitney, this year's
demand for undergraduate summer
housing surpasses that of last summer
by about 100 students. However, the
high numbers should not concern
prospective summer students, as Whit
ney said that Student Housing should
be able to meet this year's demand.
He added that although housing de
mand fluctuates, it is consistently an at
tractive option to students.
"Summer housing is always popu
lar with many students because of the
convenience, cost, community desir
ability, internships and other oppor
tunities for those students remaining
here at Stanford over the summer,"
he said.
Despite the increased demand, only
12 students who applied for campus
housing this summer have yet to receive
it. Whitney said these students were not
assigned housing because they did not in
dicate that they were willing to live any
where in their applications. He added
that Student Housing plans to provide all
students with on-campus residences, pro
vided they have some flexibility.
