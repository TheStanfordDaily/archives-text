# STUDENT HOUSING
## Demand up for summer housing 
### ADAM WIDMAN STAFF WRITER 
Students planning on living on cam
pus this summer should hop on the
bandwagon. About 1,100 undergradu
ates and 3,500 graduate students will
occupy campus residences at different
times throughout July, August and Sep
tember, said Executive Director of Stu
dent Housing Rodger Whitney.
According to Whitney, this year's
demand for undergraduate summer
housing surpasses that of last summer
by about 100 students. However, the
high numbers should not concern
prospective summer students, as Whit
ney said that Student Housing should
be able to meet this year's demand.
He added that although housing de
mand fluctuates, it is consistently an at
tractive option to students.
"Summer housing is always popu
lar with many students because of the
convenience, cost, community desir
ability, internships and other oppor
tunities for those students remaining
here at Stanford over the summer,"
he said.
Despite the increased demand, only
12 students who applied for campus
housing this summer have yet to receive
it. Whitney said these students were not
assigned housing because they did not in
dicate that they were willing to live any
where in their applications. He added
that Student Housing plans to provide all
students with on-campus residences, pro
vided they have some flexibility.
"We fully expect to have housing
for anyone who applies and is some
what flexible in choices," Whitney said.
Some students have voiced com
plaints that those not involved in Sum
mer Research College — which houses
participants in Lantana and Castano —
receive apartment-style housing in Mir
rielees as their only summer residence
option. In response, Whitney said that
many students are offered rooms in
Crothers Hall, which offers dormitory
style housing. He added that summer
students were first given the opportuni
ty to live in Mirrielees last year after the

Housing office received requests for
apartment-style housing. Prior to that,
all summer housing had previously
been dormitory-style.
While most residences will be open
and active this summer, many of them will
house non-Stanford students through the
many summer programs that bring thou
sands to campus each year.
"We have over 16,(XM) visitors staying
in campus housing attending summer
camps and conferences" he said. "The
revenue from these programs offsets the
student room and board cost and also
supports academic departments who de
sire to conduct programs at Stanford over
the summer."
The only campus residences that will not
be open this summer are Roble Hall and
Durand. which are undergoing renovations
as part of the Capital Improvement Plan.
