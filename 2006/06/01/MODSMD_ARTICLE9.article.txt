## Stanford Living By the Numbers 
### 
If it didn't affect three years of one's undergraduate
career, one would find the irony of the Draw de
ciding the living situations of control-oriented
overachieving get-what-I-want Stanford students hi
larious. Actually, as someone who will have graduated
from Stanford without once entering the Draw, I can
laugh — loudly. 1 find the whole thing pretty fascinat
ing— every year, students assume they'll get low
Draw numbers, develop no backup plans and ignore
the possibility that their six-person draw group might
fail to get into suites.
Perhaps because I've never had my heart broken by the
Draw, I find the whole thing quite fascinating, particu
larly the Draw statistics. Daily readers, this week I'm
joined by Bob social manager, ASSU Executive Cabi
net member and Daily senior staff writer Shirin Sharif
to help me break down this year's draw results.
David: Shirin, what can you tell me about the Draw?
Shirin: Well David, it was another crazy year for the
Draw.Toyon drew way un-preferred, while Granada is
now third most popular place for girls.
David: Wait, what?! Lag did better than Row houses?
Shirin: Yes, in fact, Granada drew lower than every
thing but 680 and Bob, including Xanadu, Jerry, Grove
and Mars.
David: Can you explain this bizarre turn events? I
mean. Lag Late Nite is good, but not that good!
Shirin: Apparently girls wanted singles more than a so
cial dorm with an open kitchen, special dinners, broom
ball, progressives, amazing all-campus parties and a ter
rific location.
David: Hmm, 1 can't imagine what house you might be
thinking 0f...
Shirin: This isn't Fox News — no need to be fair and
balanced.
David: Well in any case, singles do seem to be hot com
modities this year. Roble, all of West Lag, and Zapata
and Serra with their newly minted 8-a.m.-construction
singles are drawing substantially higher than last year.
Shirin: Indeed. What could explain this growing
predilection for an unshared room? I mean, the spa
cious two-room doubles common to certain Row hous
es are arguably just as nice. I would chalk it up to shift
ing demographic trends. The children of the baby
boom grew up mostly without having to share a room
with a sibling. Having lived 18 years in a single, making
simple compromises in living is just too much for them.
David: Interesting. Or, people might just be having
more sex?
Shirin: This is Stanford; are you kidding me?! Well,
maybe people on the Row are.
David: Yeah, yeah, living on the Row is amazing, it's an
experience worth dying for, I'd cut off my arm or sacri
fice my firstborn just to live in Xanadu. We get it!
Shirin: I'm just reporting the draw numbers...
David: ...And speaking of draw numbers, let's talk
about Toyon. From this year's draw cutoffs,you'd think
Toyon was in a war-torn battleground plagued by pesti
lence and crimes against humanity.
Shirin: Actually, David, if you'd read the paper you
write for, you'd know that Toyon is plagued by disease
and crime: the combination of the Toyonic Plague and
two muggings within a stone's throw of Toyon (along
with complaints about the eating clubs and their high
board bills) probably made rising sophomores eagerly
beg and plead just to be allowed to stay in their Lag
mini-doubles.
David: Wow, so I 'm sending some of my poor rising jun
ior residents off to meet their grizzly fate across the
street?
Shirin: Grizzly fate?! If that grizzly fate is a beautiful
dorm, spacious two-room triples, a 24-hour open
kitchen and TGIF barbecues every Friday, then yes.
You know, my sophomore year, people were clamber
ing to get into Toyon! It cut off at 690.
David: Clearly someone is still bitter about their draw
luck.
Shirin: Some people make their own luck. Why do you
think I made sure to staff on the glorious and magnifi
cent Row?
David: Speaking of the Row, look at this: EBF drew
bottom of the barrel with women but preferred with
men.
Shirin: What do you think explains this disparity?
David: Maybe all the cokehead dudes were intrigued
by the someplace called the "Enchanted Broccoli For
est," while the cokehead girls already have their sanctu
ary, the Cowell Cluster?
Shirin: Low blow. David.
David: Well, it's either that, or allergies are apparently
much worse on the southeast corner of campus.
Shirin: You know, underclassmen have screwed up pri
orities. Suites drew 1669 for four-group men and so high
for six-group men that groups who didn't even get pri
ority (i.e. list Suites first) got in. Meanwhile,Serra draws
404. Are we destined to become a campus of isolated
antisocial loners who sit in their private little rooms?
David: Clearly you've never heard of Manzanita...
Shirin: Well when there's the Row, why would anyone
ever consider...
David: ...Right! Thank you Shirin for your wisdom and
expertise. Ladies and gents, another year, another crazy
housing draw. Until next year, I bid you good night,
good luck and good draw number.

David Louk and Shirin Sharif are seniors majoring in an
alyzing why Murray drew 11(H) places better than Yost
and pontificating as to why 717 suddenly is one of the five
most popular row houses with men. You can contact them
