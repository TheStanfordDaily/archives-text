## Study finds race matters in death penalty 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Race still plays a large role in swaying the
death sentence, according to the findings of
Jennifer Eberhardt, an associate professor of
psychology at Stanford. In a study featured in
the Journal of Psychological Science this May,
Eberhardt demonstrated how in cases where a
black defendant is against a white victim, those
that look stereotypically more black were
more than twice as likely to be sentenced to
death.
"This study shows race may still matter in
criminal justice in ways we aren't aware of,"
Eberhardt said.
Examining how stereotypes work within
one racial category, the study is a breakaway
from the traditional line of cross-group race
studies.
The research team used a database pre
pared by David Baldus containing over 6(X)
death penalty-eligible cases from Philadelphia
between 1979 and 1999,44 of which involved a
black defendant and a white victim. The team
compiled head and neck shots of each of the
black defendants and showed them to a group
of Stanford undergraduates. Students were
asked to rate the "stereotypicality," or stereo
typical blackness, of each photo on a scale from
Ito 11. They were allowed to make their own
judgments of a stereotypically black appear
ance, which in past studies has been found to
include features such as dark skin, a wide nose
and thick lips.
The database also included hundreds of
cases involving a black defendant and a black
victim, so Eberhardt and her team selected 118
cases and repeated the aforementioned proce
dure. While cases with a white victim proved
twice as disadvantageous for stereotypically
more black defendants, in cases where both
victim and defendant were black, racial ap
pearance had a much less significant correla
tion to the sentence.
In past studies, Eberhardt has investigated
the varying degrees of prejudice toward
blacks and determined that the more stereo
typically black a person looks, the more preju
dice they receive and the more likely they are
to be perceived as criminal. Additionally, she
had been looking at literature exploring the
importance of the race of the victim in death
penalty cases.
However, Eberhardt admitted that the data
set used was neither very large nor well-repre
sented geographically. Currently, she is contin
uing her research by trying to look at other
databases from different regions of the United
States to see if the trend holds across the na
tion.
There was also not enough information in
the Baldus database to investigate cases where
the defendant and the victim were both white,
but Eberhardt is also working on this issue.
"We are at a point where we are tying to re
examine the death penalty and it is helpful to
have this information about how the death
penalty is actually administered," she said. "If
there are factors involved that shouldn't be
there, we need to know about them."
