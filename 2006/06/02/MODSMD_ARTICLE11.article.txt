## Scowcroft urges U.S.-China cooperation Speaker implores U.S. to initiate friendly gesture 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
Brent Scowcroft, the national security
advisor to Presidents Gerald Ford and
George Herbert Walker Bush,said last night
that China faces continuing challenges both
at home and in its relationship with the
United States. In a lecture at Encina Hall's
Bechtel Conference Room, the retired lieu

tenant general outlined the critical issues
underlying U.S.-Sino relations.
By characterizing China as the next
strategic opponent, American war planners
have iced relations, he said.
"Hard as we may try. we cannot by our
selves make China a friend," he said. "But
we certainly can, if we choose by our behav
ior, make them an enemy."
Scowcroft said the April visit of Chinese
President Hu Jintao likely did more harm
than good. By refusing to declare the trip an
official state visit, the president offended
Chinese leadership. Moreover, the two lead
ers only engaged in a single hour of dialogue
during the trip, he said.

"We made a series of gaffes at the meet
ing itself that really gave the whole affair a
very sour tone," he said.
While the visit went poorly, Seowcroft
said he hoped current tensions were simply
"growing pains" on the road to improving
relations, and not "the onset of a fatal ill
ness."
Scowcroft commended China for a
change in attitude toward North Korea and
Taiwan. The Chinese have agreed to join the
U.S. in six-party talks with the Koreans. With
Taiwan, he said the situation seems "less and
less likely to become a flashpoint.
"While it's still the most dangerous ele
ment, it seems to be relatively under con

trol," he said. "There's kind of a deadlock.
The Chinese are playing much more skillful
ly-"
A common interest between the two
countries continues to emerge as China be
comes a vested shareholder in the global
economy, he said.
"As China seeks sources for its growing
appetite for raw materials and seeks market
for its growing exports, it will increasingly
realize that a stable world environment is
important to achieve both of those," he said.
Scowcroft implored American leader
ship not to wait for a crisis to develop before
they discuss issues with the Chinese.
"That dialogue needs nurturing,"
he said. "The overall imperative at
the moment is that each must take
account of the interest of the other as
we pursue our goals in the world.
And that itself is a big development.
We're not used to consulting each
other on areas that don't deal with
the bilateral relationship."
The respected security strategist
— known as a realist in foreign poli
cy parlance — was on the advance
team that planned Richard Nixon's
historic week-long visit to China in
Feb. 1972. After 20 years without dis
course between the two nations, the
trip ushered in a new era of dialogue
and detente.
"This is a society grappling politi
cally with its success economically,"
he said of the world's fastest-growing
economy. "In its search for new mate
rials, especially energy, China seems
sometimes to focus on countries the

United States considers political
rogues."
While arguing that America must
work harder to reach out to China.he
acknowledged that military planners
should still take the Communist
country seriously.
"We do have to be concerned
about China, and 1 don't think any
body knows here or in Beijing what
China is going to look like in 20
years," he said.
Scowcroft said that America's oc
cupation in Iraq has undermined its
ability to actively engage the Chinese.
"A government can only think
about two or three important things
at a time," he said. "Iraq sort of sucks
the oxygen out of everything else."
Scowcroft drew the ire of promi
nent administration officials earlier
this year after he criticized the han
dling of the war in Iraq. He said that
the ongoing insurgency was "a gen
uinely difficult problem for us." I Ie
added that there has to be a govern
ment willing to cooperate with all
factions and a military force free of
the militias.
On Iran, Scowcroft called
Wednesday's announcement bv Sec

retary of State Condoleezza Rice
that the U.S. would talk directly with
the Iranians "a very shrewd move.
"It was accompanied by pretty
tough rhetoric," he said. "It seems to
me that if you're going to give a gift,
it's better to put a nice wrapper on it
than a nasty wrapper. But I think it's
a step forward."
He said the offer to Iran could
help the U.S. shore up Chinese and
Russian support for its goals in the
Middle East
"Oven if it doesn't succeed with
Iran, what it is likely to do is get the
Russians and the Chinese on board,"
he said. "Because if we can convince
them that we've done everything
possible and the blame is really on
Iran, then the possibility of concerted
action increases."
Scowcroft said he worried about
American hypocrisy on business
deals, including the recently derailed
Dubai Ports and Unocal Oil acquisi
tion deals.
"I think we're letting hysteria take
over in this country," he said. "It's not
China motivated. It is terrorism moti
vated. But it is nonetheless self de
feating."
