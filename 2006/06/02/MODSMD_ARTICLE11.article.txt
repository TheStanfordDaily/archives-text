## Scowcroft urges U.S.-China cooperation Speaker implores U.S. to initiate friendly gesture 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
Brent Scowcroft, the national security
advisor to Presidents Gerald Ford and
George Herbert Walker Bush,said last night
that China faces continuing challenges both
at home and in its relationship with the
United States. In a lecture at Encina Hall's
Bechtel Conference Room, the retired lieu

tenant general outlined the critical issues
underlying U.S.-Sino relations.
By characterizing China as the next
strategic opponent, American war planners
have iced relations, he said.
"Hard as we may try. we cannot by our
selves make China a friend," he said. "But
we certainly can, if we choose by our behav
ior, make them an enemy."
Scowcroft said the April visit of Chinese
President Hu Jintao likely did more harm
than good. By refusing to declare the trip an
official state visit, the president offended
Chinese leadership. Moreover, the two lead
ers only engaged in a single hour of dialogue
during the trip, he said.

"We made a series of gaffes at the meet
ing itself that really gave the whole affair a
very sour tone," he said.
While the visit went poorly, Seowcroft
said he hoped current tensions were simply
"growing pains" on the road to improving
relations, and not "the onset of a fatal ill
ness."
Scowcroft commended China for a
change in attitude toward North Korea and
Taiwan. The Chinese have agreed to join the
U.S. in six-party talks with the Koreans. With
Taiwan, he said the situation seems "less and
less likely to become a flashpoint.
"While it's still the most dangerous ele
ment, it seems to be relatively under con

trol," he said. "There's kind of a deadlock.
The Chinese are playing much more skillful
ly-"
A common interest between the two
countries continues to emerge as China be
comes a vested shareholder in the global
economy, he said.
"As China seeks sources for its growing
appetite for raw materials and seeks market
for its growing exports, it will increasingly
realize that a stable world environment is
important to achieve both of those," he said.
Scowcroft implored American leader
ship not to wait for a crisis to develop before
