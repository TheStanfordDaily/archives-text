# COMMUNITY ISSUES
## Univ. faces fierce trail opposition 
### NIRAJ SHETH 
Last week. San Mateo County Supervisors held a public
meeting with members of the community to discuss an
offer by Stanford to build a recreational trail along Alpine
Road. Public testimony given at that meeting overwhelm
ingly opposed the University's proposal, punctuating what
is just the latest spat in a five-year-old struggle between
Stanford and its neighbors.
An agreement reached with Santa Clara County last
December regarding a condition set out in Stanford's 2000
General Use Permit requires the University to offer up to
$8.4 million to San Mateo County and up to $2.8 million to
Portola Valley to expand and improve the path that cur
rently runs along Alpine Road.
However, several members of these communities op
pose such an expansion, claiming that the new Alpine Road
Trail would be overly dangerous for use and environmen
tally unsound. Instead, they have pushed for alternative
trails that would run somewhere on Stanford's lands east of
Alpine Road and further into its interior. If either, or both,
the County or Portola Valley rejects Stanford's offer, the
funds will instead go to Santa Clara County for recreation
al purposes.
According to San Mateo County Supervisor Rich Gor
don, who was one of two County Supervisors at the meet
ing. of the 39 members of the community who gave their
opinion, about 34 opposed any improvements to the exist

ing trail. Opponents mostly cited traffic,safety and environ
mental concerns.
In an interview with The Daily. Lennie Roberts, a repre
sentative for the Committee for Green Foothills (CGF),
said that in her 28 years of working with the public, she has
rarely seen such one-sided meeting.
"It did clarify for Supervisors [Jerry] Hill and Gordon
that there is a very strong sentiment within the community
to say no," she said.
Larry Morton, director of government and community
relations at Stanford, gave a presentation at the hearing
and agreed that most of the attended public clearly op
posed the trail. However, the reasoning behind such oppo
sition was misinformed, he said.
"What I was concerned about were the many statements
that were not factually correct," Horton said.
Roberts disagreed that the community misunderstood
the University's offer. However, she did note that the
meeting was successful in clarifying an important point
about Stanford's funding — that only the amount needed
for whatever construction the County decides to do. cost
ing up to $8.4 million, would be paid for by the University.
If the County makes only a minor improvement costing
$100,000, for example, the County would receive only that
amount from Stanford and the University would keep the
rest.

Gordon explained that this hear
ing was only the first step before the
County Board of Supervisors de
cides whether to accept Stanford's
offer. While Gordon's subcommittee
still needs to make a recommenda
tion to the full Board, he is "hopeful
that by early summer we can craft
some initial response for the Board
to consider."
Hie controversy surrounding the
construction of this trail dates back
to 2(KM), when Stanford negotiated a
General Use Permit (GUP) with
Santa Clara County allow for the
construction of more residential, ac
ademic and recreational buildings
on campus. In return, the University
agreed to a set of 107 conditions, in
cluding one that "Stanford shall ded
icate easements for, develop and
maintain the portions of the two trail

alignments which cross Stanford
lands."
One of these two trails, which are
determined by Santa Clara's Trails
Master Plan, runs along Alpine
Road on the west side of campus.
While Stanford and Santa Clara
were supposed to reach an agree
ment on implementing this trail by
2001, unexpected controversy over
its exact location stalled the process
until late last year.
In December, Santa Clara's
Board of Supervisors finally ap
proved an agreement, in which
Stanford would construct one trail
on its lands in Santa Clara and offer
to pay San Mateo County and Por
tola Valley for the expansion and
improvement of the path along
Alpine Road.
Sources from both the Universi
ty and the surrounding communi
ties agreed that while relations be
tween the two are usually friendly,
land use has always been a flash
point. According to Horton,
polling conducted by Stanford in

Palo Alto and Menlo Park showed
that "Stanford has an extraordinar
ily high, positive opinion in the
County."
Horton estimated that 95 percent
of the University's conflicts with its
neighbors concern land use. Roberts
concurred.
"Land use is always controver
sial," she said.
While Gordon explained that
"the town and gown tension hap
pens," he also emphasized the im
portance of good communication
between the University and sur
rounding communities, which he
said is normally the case.
"As an elected official," he said,"l
have sufficient access to Stanford
and 1 think they have access to me."
Horton agreed about the impor
tance of good relations.
"It's very important to have good
community relations," he said. "But
Stanford must also act in an ethical
manner." In this case, he explained,
"Stanford should have the right to
control its destiny."
