## Univ. faces fierce trail opposition 
### NIRAJ SHETH 
Last week. San Mateo County Supervisors held a public
meeting with members of the community to discuss an
offer by Stanford to build a recreational trail along Alpine
Road. Public testimony given at that meeting overwhelm
ingly opposed the University's proposal, punctuating what
is just the latest spat in a five-year-old struggle between
Stanford and its neighbors.
An agreement reached with Santa Clara County last
December regarding a condition set out in Stanford's 2000
General Use Permit requires the University to offer up to
$8.4 million to San Mateo County and up to $2.8 million to
Portola Valley to expand and improve the path that cur
rently runs along Alpine Road.
However, several members of these communities op
pose such an expansion, claiming that the new Alpine Road
Trail would be overly dangerous for use and environmen
tally unsound. Instead, they have pushed for alternative
trails that would run somewhere on Stanford's lands east of
Alpine Road and further into its interior. If either, or both,
the County or Portola Valley rejects Stanford's offer, the
funds will instead go to Santa Clara County for recreation
al purposes.
According to San Mateo County Supervisor Rich Gor
don, who was one of two County Supervisors at the meet
ing. of the 39 members of the community who gave their
opinion, about 34 opposed any improvements to the exist

ing trail. Opponents mostly cited traffic,safety and environ
mental concerns.
In an interview with The Daily. Lennie Roberts, a repre
sentative for the Committee for Green Foothills (CGF),
said that in her 28 years of working with the public, she has
rarely seen such one-sided meeting.
"It did clarify for Supervisors [Jerry] Hill and Gordon
that there is a very strong sentiment within the community
to say no," she said.
Larry Morton, director of government and community
relations at Stanford, gave a presentation at the hearing
and agreed that most of the attended public clearly op
posed the trail. However, the reasoning behind such oppo
sition was misinformed, he said.
"What I was concerned about were the many statements
that were not factually correct," Horton said.
Roberts disagreed that the community misunderstood
the University's offer. However, she did note that the
meeting was successful in clarifying an important point
about Stanford's funding â€” that only the amount needed
for whatever construction the County decides to do. cost
ing up to $8.4 million, would be paid for by the University.
If the County makes only a minor improvement costing
$100,000, for example, the County would receive only that
amount from Stanford and the University would keep the
rest.
