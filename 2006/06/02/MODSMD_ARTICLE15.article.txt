# Opinions
## Editorial Our honest opinion 
### 
An opinion is a complicated thing. We
hold our opinions dear to our hearts
and devote much of our time and at
tention to them, even though we find it diffi
cult to put them in words or substantiate them
with facts. Often, our opinions differ from
those of the people around us. Nevertheless,
we still feel it vital to express these opinions,
even if we can't always defend them.
Because of this, opinions translate poorly
onto a newspaper setting, where emphasis is
placed on brevity and clarity. When writing a
500-word opinion piece to be read by the en
tire campus, there is much greater pressure
to articulate a compelling argument and find
powerful supporting evidence. Yet the Opin
ions page fights against the reduction of
thoughts and opinions into catchy sound
bites. We provide the space for students to
air their views and explain their thinking.
But even when opinions are clearly ex
plained and properly contextualized, some
opinions can be explosive, as we have
learned this volume. As opinions editors, we
do everything to avoid printing columns, op
eds and letters that are unambiguously hate
ful — and we do receive such material. But
we feel that we should never censor opin
ions, even unpopular ones, and risk stifling
serious debate on relevant campus issues.
Our philosophy has been to generate dis
cussion (not at any cost, but we have pre
ferred vibrant debates to an absence of de
bates). Such thinking has definitely filtered
into the way we facilitated discussions on the
Editorial Board, and in the op-eds and let
ters we have chosen to print. But to balance
it out. we always seek to print as many letters
as possible, and honor the right of reply of in
dividuals despite space constraints.
As opinions editors, much of what we do
happens behind the scenes. We are involved
in running the Editorial Board and editing
columns and letters. We strove to represent
as many views as possible — especially if
these opinions provide refreshing insights
into important issues. We do receive an occa
sional letter that is shocking and hateful, re
minding us that our job as opinions editors is
never done. Yet for the most part, we are glad
that members of the Stanford community
have approached even the most controver
sial issues in a reasoned and mature fashion.
Though this volume went very well, there
is always room for improvement. For in
stance, we look forward to greater graduate

student participation on the Opinions page.
As it stands, we have two grad student
columnists this volume — Navin Sivanan
dam and Adam Bad Wound — and we fre
quently receive letters from graduate stu
dents. But we regret not having graduate stu
dents on the Editorial Board, as their views
would have added a new and interesting per
spective to many of the issues we discussed.
We hope that graduate students will feel that
the page represents their views as well and
consider becoming more involved with the
Opinions department.
With a few exceptions, most letters we re
ceive are angry. We understand that it's gen
erally more satisfying to write a letter of dis
sent than one of praise. As editors, however,
we look forward to reading funny, witty let
ters that make our nights at the Daily office
all the more interesting. We hope that more
people will take the time to write letters
agreeing with opinions expressed on the
page, elaborating on similar perspectives,
commending individuals and organizations
for a job well done or simply giving a comical
outlook on a relevant issue. Opinions do not
always have to be adversarial and antagonis
tic, but can foster more productive dialogue.
Ultimately, it is our commitment to creat
ing active and vibrant dialogue that makes
our job so rewarding and exciting. We invite
people to share in this excitement by con
tributing to the Opinions page next year —
by writing a regular column, by contributing
an occasional letter or by serving on the
Board as a community member. We wel
come all interested individuals to email us at
opinions@daily.stanford.edu to find out
more. We eagerly anticipate reading more of
your opinions in Volume 230.

Victoria Degtyareva and Wenkai Tay are sad to
end their term as Opinions Editors of Volume
229. The daring duo can be reached at vick
