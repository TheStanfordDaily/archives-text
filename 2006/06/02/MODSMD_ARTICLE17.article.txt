# Al Gore is a sexy beast
## 
### 
I have never liked Al Gore. I always found
him stiff, wooden and robotic, much like
my debut performance in "Model Man."
This is largely the fault of his handlers, the
media and "Saturday Night Live." They
mocked him for claiming to have invented
the internet. They parodied his mirthless
speaking voice. They made funny little car
toon drawings of his hawk-like nose and
small eyes.
I fell for it. I fell hard, like a blind kid tak
ing the stairs.
But now I know differently. Al Gore isn't
stiff and droll — he's sexy. A sexy robot, like
Jessica Simpson. And with brains to boot.
What changed my mind? The trailer for
"An Inconvenient Truth,"the new documen
tary about global warming starring sexy
beast Al Gore. The film is essentially a mul
timedia presentation on the most serious
plight facing our planet, with commentary
from Tin Man Gore.
The media has been slavering all over the
film. A.O. Scott, understated as always,
called it "a necessary film." The New York
ers David Remnick, as if crafting a Roman
tic-era paean, referred to Gore as "a symbol
of what might have been." Similarly smug
language peppers every media article about
the film, immediately setting off my "Ugh!"
alert. Not that I have anything against the
media — for the last six years I've worked in
one media organization or another. But the
media — especially the liberal media — is
full of lemmings. And although I agree polit
ically with most liberal commentators, I can't
help but find their righteousness a bit nause
ating.
It doesn't help to come from a Republi
can family. "Humans are causing global
warming?" my dad might say at the dinner
table. "So who caused the Ice Age — woolly
mammoths?" I just nod and chew my steak
noisily.
It's a good thing I didn't let the media or
my background stop me from giving Al
Gore a second chance. I haven't seen "An In
convenient Truth" yet, but the trailer was
enough to scare me. (You can see it on
http://www.apple.com/trailers, under the
Paramount Classics subsection.) In it. Gore

shows a 75-year-old photo of a Patagonian
glacier: A river of blue-white ice, miles long.
Then he shows the same vista as it appears
today: Instead of a glacier and snow-capped
mountains, there is a lake and dirt-brown
peaks. He uses the same technique on Mt.
Kilimanjaro, which is in danger of complete
ly losing its snowcap.
! have never been to Mt. Kilimanjaro,
something that makes my inner Hemingway
sulk. (Actually, he'd probably sulk no matter
what 1 did. He'd sulk, drink a mojito, then
shoot a lion.) But I have been to Patagonia
and seen the glaciers. Glacier Grey, as seen
from the John Grey Pass in Torres del Paine
National Park in Southern Chile, is a two
mile-long stretch of thousand-year-old ice
and snow. I'd like to see it again someday.
But I don't like the idea of having to hurry
up to do so.
Polar bears and penguins are also high
on my sight-seeing list. A polar bear hunt
ing a penguin is even higher, even though
this only happens in cartoons. I want to
travel to the Maldives, take an Alaskan
cruise and own a beachfront home in
Northern California. All of this will be a lot
harder to do once the ice caps melt, the con
tinents bake and President Bush has Al
Gore killed during the 2008 primaries.
(Why take chances?)
I am pessimistic about the possibility of
throwing back the carbon quilt over the
earth in our lifetime. I don't think "An In
convenient Truth" will do the trick. But to
get a politically jaded guy like myself all
heated up (pun most definitely intended), it
must be doing something right.
