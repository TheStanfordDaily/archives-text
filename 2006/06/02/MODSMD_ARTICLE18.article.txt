# Hugging
## 
### 
I'm ashamed of myself. I did something
earlier this week that 1 feel very guilty
about — I got roped into helping make
the world a better place.
Frankly, the world doesn't do it for me (ac
tually, these days no one does). It's surly and
unresponsive to my ministrations. And (obvi
ously) it hates me.
Accordingly, I hold dear the notion that
helping other people is a pursuit of fools and
children. Grown ups should only care about
important things like getting someone to
TiVo the season finale of "Grey's Anatomy"
(incidentally, if anyone has it, I really want a
copy).
The details of my foray into social respon
sibility aren't particularly interesting,and I'd
rather we didn't dwell on it too much. How
ever, as I was relaxing afterwards trying to
deal with the rising bile, the nauseous feelings
and the general sense of worthiness, I was
struck by a thought: Cardinal undergradu
ates seem to enjoy helping others.
In fact, if I were being fair, I would have to
admit that this disease of helpfulness extends
to my peers as well — bunch of selfless do
gooders. But fairness was never really my
strong point.
Of course, we're over simplifying some
what if we just leave the motivation for "get
ting involved" as a desire to help people. The
truth is, as always, a little subtler and a little
less altruistic.

You see, what the children want is not to
save the world, but rather to hug it. They
wish to grasp it in a loving embrace and
offer tender ministrations and soft caresses
— all in the hope of getting some play in re
turn.
Unfortunately, this sort of touchy-feely
approach is destined to go nowhere. The
world is not huggable. It's spiky and unpleas
ant. If you try and touch it gently, it will grab
you with its Venus Flytrap-like jaws and swal
low your good intentions.
While this does make one a little sad —
after all the poor dears do try so hard — part
of me (by which I mean most of me) finds the
hugging process terribly amusing.
Young folk really Care. And because they
think that Caring is very important, they're
very earnest about it.
All this keenness is a little vomit-inducing
at first, but one can get past that with a little
effort. And then it's almost impossible not to
smile.

It's a little like watching pigeons fly into
windows — we all know it's painful, but you
can't help but chuckle at such repeated stub
bornness. Plus there's something quite nice
about the existence of a literal realization of
the "banging your head against a wall"
metaphor.
Futility brings us back to the real problem
with hugging: It rarely does any good. The
demonstrations, the frequent late-night dis
cussions and the conviction that the world
can be changed by a few wristbands are sort
of sweet and endearing, but they're also
wrong.
People grow out of altruism; rather, they
continually redefine "others" until they're
helping themselves (typical logic includes: "If
I buy myself this plasma TV I'll be more re
laxed, and it will be easier for me to save the
starving children"). And, since it doesn't last
forever, the folly of Caring is not quite as irri
tating as the myriad of other dubious habits
that can found on the Farm.
What's more, if genuine selflessness is a
phase that the kids will eventually grow out
of, I suppose we should take the Good Par
enting approach: Smile indulgently and re
member how, when we were little, we were
just the same.

If you really want something to kiss and make
better, email Navin at navins@stanford.edu to
come to some arrangement.
