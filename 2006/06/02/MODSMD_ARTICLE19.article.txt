## Med School article was insulting 
### 
As a former writer for the Stanford Daily,
and as a current female assistant professor
within the Medical School, 1 was disappoint
ed by Ben Eppler's recent article ("Med
School Faculty Claim Systematic Discrimi
nation," May 25). I've worked in the School
of Medicine for nearly six years and do not
recognize the "chilling environment" for
women and minorities that Eppler describes.
If there were objective data on which to base
his largely speculative, conspiratorial
charges, then I'm all for exposing a bad situa

tion. But to level vague charges based on
"anonymous sources" (one person's opin
ion?) on the front page, rather than in the
Opinions section, is irresponsible.
There are many real, busy, powerful peo
ple who have made the creation of a sup
portive, ethnic and gender-diverse environ
ment a high priority. It's cheap and easy to
throw stones, but much harder to create
good within an organization, as many have
been doing in the Medical School. Does ha
rassment and discrimination still occur with
in the Medical School? Sometimes, as it does
throughout society. However, the environ
ment today is one of zero tolerance, abun

dant resources and fairness. I have worked
within other organizations, none of which
possessed the combination of workplace
flexibility, required training about sexual ha
rassment, respect for others, an active and
credible Office of Leadership and Diversity
and an accessible,skilled Ombudsman, as we
have at Stanford.
Finally, to be called a "token" because I'm
a female faculty member is a shallow insult. I
worked many long hours through Stanford
and Harvard. I am here for reasons other
than a couple of X chromosomes.
