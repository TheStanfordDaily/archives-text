# RE-DIRECT THE CUP?
## UCLA and 11 -time champ Stanford in a dogfight for Directors' Cup, awarded annually to top athletic program 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
The Directors' Cup might be headed to West
wood.
For eleven years running, Stanford has
claimed the award, given annually to the school
which scores highest in a formula that tracks fin
ishes in all collegiate sports. But as Stanford
men's sports across the board have fared worse
than in previous years, UCLA has pulled dead
even in a sprint to the finish, which could come as
late as June 25, the final day of baseball's College
World Series.
Labeling itself the "Home of Champions,"
Stanford Athletics takes obvious pride in an
honor that, though flawed, is the most compre
hensive measure available of which college hosts
the nations' strongest across-the-board athletic
program.
And in years past, Stanford's pride has been
well placed. The Card finished second to North
Carolina in 1993-94, the then-Sears Cup's first
year of existence. Since, the 11 straight titles, most
in 100-plus-point routs, have impressed the depth
and quality of Stanford athletics firmly into the
national consciousness.
However, this is not a typical year for Stanford
athletics.
Just ask UC-Davis.

The Aggies swept Stanford in both schools' three
most widely followed sports: football, men's bas
ketball and baseball. And save for the 20-17 foot
ball upset that made international headlines, the
contests weren't especially close.
More than embarrassing isolated incidents
though, the losses are symbolic of a downward
trend in men's sports. Most casual fans know that
football hasn't been to a bowl since Ty Willing
ham roamed the sidelines five years ago, basket
ball missed the NCAA Tournament for the first
time in 12 years, and baseball came within an inch
of its first postseason miss in 13 seasons.

But the troubles run deeper.
This year, no men's sport won a national title

and only five of the 13 the Directors' Cup con
siders have clinched top-30 finishes. Mean
while, the women claimed national titles in
cross-country and tennis (and synchronized
swimming, though not a Directors' Cup
sport) and 13 top-30 finishes.

Enter UCLA. Recent championships in"
men's water polo and volleyball have not only
pulled the Bruins within one national title of
100 — and seven ahead of Stanford — but into

a virtual tie for the trophy.
