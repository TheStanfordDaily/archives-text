# RE-DIRECT THE CUP?
## UCLA and 11 -time champ Stanford in a dogfight for Directors' Cup, awarded annually to top athletic program 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
The Directors' Cup might be headed to West
wood.
For eleven years running, Stanford has
claimed the award, given annually to the school
which scores highest in a formula that tracks fin
ishes in all collegiate sports. But as Stanford
men's sports across the board have fared worse
than in previous years, UCLA has pulled dead
even in a sprint to the finish, which could come as
late as June 25, the final day of baseball's College
World Series.
Labeling itself the "Home of Champions,"
Stanford Athletics takes obvious pride in an
honor that, though flawed, is the most compre
hensive measure available of which college hosts
the nations' strongest across-the-board athletic
program.
And in years past, Stanford's pride has been
well placed. The Card finished second to North
Carolina in 1993-94, the then-Sears Cup's first
year of existence. Since, the 11 straight titles, most
in 100-plus-point routs, have impressed the depth
and quality of Stanford athletics firmly into the
national consciousness.
However, this is not a typical year for Stanford
athletics.
Just ask UC-Davis.

The Aggies swept Stanford in both schools' three
most widely followed sports: football, men's bas
ketball and baseball. And save for the 20-17 foot
ball upset that made international headlines, the
contests weren't especially close.
More than embarrassing isolated incidents
though, the losses are symbolic of a downward
trend in men's sports. Most casual fans know that
football hasn't been to a bowl since Ty Willing
ham roamed the sidelines five years ago, basket
ball missed the NCAA Tournament for the first
time in 12 years, and baseball came within an inch
of its first postseason miss in 13 seasons.

But the troubles run deeper.
This year, no men's sport won a national title

and only five of the 13 the Directors' Cup con
siders have clinched top-30 finishes. Mean
while, the women claimed national titles in
cross-country and tennis (and synchronized
swimming, though not a Directors' Cup
sport) and 13 top-30 finishes.

Enter UCLA. Recent championships in"
men's water polo and volleyball have not only
pulled the Bruins within one national title of
100 — and seven ahead of Stanford — but into

a virtual tie for the trophy.

soccer, the Bruins have currently
clinched 1,(X)1 points, 110 fewer than
Stanford. But while Stanford will not
add to its total if the seedings hold,
UCLA figures to pick up 84 points in
the remaining sports — baseball, soft
ball. men's golf, and men's and
women's outdoor track.
Those results pull the Bruins within
26 of the Cardinal. And with both
schools scoring in the thousands, a 26-
point margin is a virtual dead heat, and
just one more UCLA win than expect
ed could end the Stanford dynasty.
But, for Stanford, the Directors'
Cup is half-full too. With baseball and
track lowly regarded entering NCAAs,
a strong finish from either squad could
add a payload of unexpected points to
the Cardinal ledger, putting a serious
dent into UCLA's title chances. In the
same vein, top-ranked UCLA softball
is projected to claim the title and the
1 (K) points that go with it. so anything
less could prove costly.
With a projected 10 top-10 finishes,
UCLA has strung together its
strongest season in school history, so

Stanford — and especially the women
— deserve credit for keeping pace in a
down year. Of Stanford's 1,111 points,
nearly 7(X) come from women. That
mark will easily be tops in the country.
Despite the pressure of an 100-plus
match winning streak, tennis coolly
won their third-straight national title,
cross-country claimed their second in
three years, indoor track and swim
ming finished in the top-five and
women's basketball made their third
straight Elite Eight appearance. Even
newcomer fencing and its majority fe
male roster got into the mix. picking up
34 points with a seventh-place finish.
The national champion in each
sport earns 50 or 1(X) points, depending
upon the size of the field. Points de
crease gradually thereafter. In football,
for example, national champion Texas
earned KM) points, second-place South
ern California 90, fifth-place Louisiana
State 75,15th-place Wisconsin 45, and
25th-place California 24.
In a nod to schools with smaller
budgets and fewer sponsored sports,
only the ten top men's and women's
finishes count toward a school's total.
This rule hurts Stanford, which cannot
count point-garnering finishes from
women's gymnastics, soccer, lacrosse
and crew this season.
