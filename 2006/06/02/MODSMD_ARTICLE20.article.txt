## STANFORD PRISON Dance 
### MARIE-JO MONT RAYNAUD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
What should you do if you're about to be
sent to jail for three years? How do you
encourage incarcerated youth to share
their stories without making them re-live
their pain? What can you do to fill the
void that drugs, gangbanging and violence have left in the
lives of the voung people who find themselves in juvenile
hall?
These are the kinds of questions that confront a group
of Stanford students at 8 a.m. as they gather to go to the
San Jose Juvenile Hall. Their answer to today's youth in
carceration problem: dance.
Ten female students compromise Dance Professor
Janice Ross and Christa Gannon's dance department,
"Art and Community: Dance in Prisons." Started six
years ago with help from the Haas Center, the course al
lows participants to explore the issue of youth incarcera
tion both through theoretical readings and practical ex
perience in weekly visits with the inmates of G-4 and B
-9 in San Jose Juvenile Hall.
The course aims "to broaden our conceptions of the
kind of work the arts can do in the world outside of aca
demia-and to invite a regard for the practice of dance and
performance with marginalized, or in the case of the in
carcerated, nearly invisible populations, as a serious art
practice," says Ross. "Dance where the dance has the ca
pacity to change the dancer."
According to Ross, the course uses hip-hop dance to
study how the performing arts affect self-perception, ex
periences of embodiment and social development in in
carcerated female and male juveniles.
"This has been one of, if not the, most gratifying class
I've taught at Stanford," says Ross. "So many of the stu
dents in it are deeply committed to working for social
change through the arts and they have gone on to do im
portant work afterward."
This year's course has particularly emphasized the
role of the non-profit. Gannon, the founder of Fresh Life
lines for Youth (FLY) and a graduate of Stanford Law
School, teaches extensively about the practical and ethi
cal issues of bringing support to marginalized young peo
ple. FLY's mission is to "reduce juvenile crime and incar
ceration through legal education, mentoring and leader
ship training."
The problem of juvenile crime is significant. A study
of local youth who are incarcerated found that the year
ly cost of incarcerating one young person in the state's
correctional system is $71,(XX). FLY's programs, on the
other hand, cost $S,(XX) per year per youth. The study es
timated that society pays an estimated 1.7 million dollars
for each youth who drops out of school to become in
volved in a life of crime and drug abuse.
FLY aims to solve this problem by providing positive
role models, as the study also found that 91 % of incarcer
ated youth did not have a positive role model in their
lives.
That is where Stanford students come in.
"They can't believe that we haven't been trapped in
the legal system," says senior Leah Tapscott, of the youth
she's encountered during the course. A number of stu
dents agree that the youth saw only extremes-either
being in a gang, or being a complete square and going to
school. Gannon emphasized that merely by their pres
ence, the Stanford students were opening the youth's
minds to success outside of the gang setting.
"Their lives are sort of like a barren dessert-devoid of
love and of hope," Gannon told the class this week."They
need someone to give them unconditional love. They
need someone to have their back. We have to create a
substitute for gang culture."

Part of that is dance. When the stu
dents go there from $ a.m. to 12 p.m. on
Thursdays, they do mjEteach. Instead, they

learn alongside the incarcerated youth-as
equals-as an instructor demonstrates new
stem nnrl moves

aiiu uiuvca.
Over the course's 10 weeki many of the stu
dents have developei strong relationships with
the youth in Juvenile Hall.

One student, Seni(|r Rachel Niederman.connect-
ed with a young man through a book called East Side

Dreams, which was assigned reading for the course. It
turned out that that Was in fact the only book the young
man had ever read. I
"1 helped him sea how miraculous it was that if he
wanted to, he could write down all his experiences after
he got out and any kid in juvy from around the country
could read it and relate to it," Niederman said. She told
him about a related l>ook and he was interested in read
ing it. When she said jihe would bring it for him "His eyes
lit up, but then he quickly asked me if it was hard-back.
No hardbacks. Or staples. Or paper clips."
Juvenile Hall is vtry concerned about the materials
that enter facility fol safety ieasons, and impose strict
regulations.
The following welk, Niederman cut off the cover of
the book and gave it jo him with a note inside.
"I think he'd thought I'd forgotten it," she said, "be
cause he looked overwhelmed with emotion when I
handed him the hag ,aid gift... wrapped in the book leaf
cover. As we were walking out, he held the book up and
said, 'I'll read it tonilht'. No class has ever been so re
warding."
Another group ol ptudents had gotten to know anoth
er young man who was to be moved to prison for three
years, as he was 19 anp past the age of youth kept in Juve
nile Hall.
"He was trying to figure how to make a place for
himself so he doesn'tlget beat up," said senior Leah Tap
scott. "if I let someone take my lunch that first day, I
won't eat the whole time I'm there,' he told us. What are
we supposed to say t(Â»him?"she asked Gannon. "How do
you deal with that?" I
"At the end of the day, they've got to make their own
decisions," Gannon responded. She emphasized that a
good volunteer need* to stay positive in such a situation.
"Even if you're thers thinking 'God, this is bleak' that
cannot come across your face," she said
"All you can do in validate them," she added. "Boost
their confidence and tell them that you can't give up on
yourself, you're all yJu've got. At the end of the day we
can't be the savior." I
Gannon touched on a number of psychological phe
nomena, including tile savior complex and co-depend
ence, that have caused problems for those working in
non-profits.
"We all get into (his work because we care and we
want to make change," she explained. But for some, it
gets to the point "wliere our happiness depends on the
happiness of our cli ;at, and that is something that we
have to be very mindful of."
By the end of the < ciurse, the students were very aware
of the difficulties connected vlth the work. Teaching As
sistant Malika Williams pointed out the particular chal
lenges that non-profife face in raising funds. "Their work
is very worthwhile, and its frustrating to always have to
prove that."
The unique problem of non-profits, according to Gan
non is that "we take on the most important social prob
lems of the day and have the least amount of resources to

deal with I."
The difficulties facing volunteers working with incar
cerated youth are Indeed daunting. According to Gan
non, them's only a one in five chance that youth will turn
their life around [following incarceration. And that's
where thclrole of a non-profit is different than that of a
business. I
"With a one in five chance of being successful, that's
not a placlyou're going to put a product out." Gannon
said. But & a non-profit, she is committed to helping in
dividuals. regardless of the odds.
"This class gave me the opportunity to have a first
hand experience in juvenile hall and reaffirm what I be

lieved all along...just kids," says Nie
dernian "They've No one ii
their liyes has cared about to counterac
the fords that have hurt them, hit rock bot
.torn."
The students come away from the course facing thesi
challenges with the same stubbornness and commitmen
that Gannon exhibits.
"If the stats say that there's a one in five chance o
turning that child's life around, that's one more thai
zero," says sophomore Hileena Eshetu.

What should you do if you're about to be
sent to jail for three years? How do you
encourage incarcerated youth to share
their stories without making them re-live
their pain? What can you do to fill the
void that drugs, gangbanging and violence have left in the
lives of the voung people who find themselves in juvenile
hall?
These are the kinds of questions that confront a group
of Stanford students at 8 a.m. as they gather to go to the
San Jose Juvenile Hall. Their answer to today's youth in
carceration problem: dance.
Ten female students compromise Dance Professor
Janice Ross and Christa Gannon's dance department,
"Art and Community: Dance in Prisons." Started six
years ago with help from the Haas Center, the course al
lows participants to explore the issue of youth incarcera
tion both through theoretical readings and practical ex
perience in weekly visits with the inmates of G-4 and B
-9 in San Jose Juvenile Hall.
The course aims "to broaden our conceptions of the
kind of work the arts can do in the world outside of aca
demia-and to invite a regard for the practice of dance and
performance with marginalized, or in the case of the in
carcerated, nearly invisible populations, as a serious art
practice," says Ross. "Dance where the dance has the ca
pacity to change the dancer."
According to Ross, the course uses hip-hop dance to
study how the performing arts affect self-perception, ex
periences of embodiment and social development in in
carcerated female and male juveniles.
"This has been one of, if not the, most gratifying class
I've taught at Stanford," says Ross. "So many of the stu
dents in it are deeply committed to working for social
change through the arts and they have gone on to do im
portant work afterward."
This year's course has particularly emphasized the
role of the non-profit. Gannon, the founder of Fresh Life
lines for Youth (FLY) and a graduate of Stanford Law
School, teaches extensively about the practical and ethi
cal issues of bringing support to marginalized young peo
ple. FLY's mission is to "reduce juvenile crime and incar
ceration through legal education, mentoring and leader
ship training."
The problem of juvenile crime is significant. A study
of local youth who are incarcerated found that the year
ly cost of incarcerating one young person in the state's
correctional system is $71,(XX). FLY's programs, on the
other hand, cost $S,(XX) per year per youth. The study es
timated that society pays an estimated 1.7 million dollars
for each youth who drops out of school to become in
volved in a life of crime and drug abuse.
FLY aims to solve this problem by providing positive
role models, as the study also found that 91 % of incarcer
ated youth did not have a positive role model in their
lives.
That is where Stanford students come in.
"They can't believe that we haven't been trapped in
the legal system," says senior Leah Tapscott, of the youth
she's encountered during the course. A number of stu
dents agree that the youth saw only extremes-either
being in a gang, or being a complete square and going to
school. Gannon emphasized that merely by their pres
ence, the Stanford students were opening the youth's
minds to success outside of the gang setting.
"Their lives are sort of like a barren dessert-devoid of
love and of hope," Gannon told the class this week."They
need someone to give them unconditional love. They
need someone to have their back. We have to create a
substitute for gang culture."

Part of that is dance. When the stu
dents go there from $ a.m. to 12 p.m. on
Thursdays, they do mjEteach. Instead, they

learn alongside the incarcerated youth-as
equals-as an instructor demonstrates new
stem nnrl moves

aiiu uiuvca.
Over the course's 10 weeki many of the stu
dents have developei strong relationships with
the youth in Juvenile Hall.

One student, Seni(|r Rachel Niederman.connect-
ed with a young man through a book called East Side

Dreams, which was assigned reading for the course. It
turned out that that Was in fact the only book the young
man had ever read. I
"1 helped him sea how miraculous it was that if he
wanted to, he could write down all his experiences after
he got out and any kid in juvy from around the country
could read it and relate to it," Niederman said. She told
him about a related l>ook and he was interested in read
ing it. When she said jihe would bring it for him "His eyes
lit up, but then he quickly asked me if it was hard-back.
No hardbacks. Or staples. Or paper clips."
Juvenile Hall is vtry concerned about the materials
that enter facility fol safety ieasons, and impose strict
regulations.
The following welk, Niederman cut off the cover of
the book and gave it jo him with a note inside.
"I think he'd thought I'd forgotten it," she said, "be
cause he looked overwhelmed with emotion when I
handed him the hag ,aid gift... wrapped in the book leaf
cover. As we were walking out, he held the book up and
said, 'I'll read it tonilht'. No class has ever been so re
warding."
Another group ol ptudents had gotten to know anoth
er young man who was to be moved to prison for three
years, as he was 19 anp past the age of youth kept in Juve
nile Hall.
"He was trying to figure how to make a place for
himself so he doesn'tlget beat up," said senior Leah Tap
scott. "if I let someone take my lunch that first day, I
won't eat the whole time I'm there,' he told us. What are
we supposed to say t(Â»him?"she asked Gannon. "How do
you deal with that?" I
"At the end of the day, they've got to make their own
decisions," Gannon responded. She emphasized that a
good volunteer need* to stay positive in such a situation.
"Even if you're thers thinking 'God, this is bleak' that
cannot come across your face," she said
"All you can do in validate them," she added. "Boost
their confidence and tell them that you can't give up on
yourself, you're all yJu've got. At the end of the day we
can't be the savior." I
Gannon touched on a number of psychological phe
nomena, including tile savior complex and co-depend
ence, that have caused problems for those working in
non-profits.
"We all get into (his work because we care and we
want to make change," she explained. But for some, it
gets to the point "wliere our happiness depends on the
happiness of our cli ;at, and that is something that we
have to be very mindful of."
By the end of the < ciurse, the students were very aware
of the difficulties connected vlth the work. Teaching As
sistant Malika Williams pointed out the particular chal
lenges that non-profife face in raising funds. "Their work
is very worthwhile, and its frustrating to always have to
prove that."
