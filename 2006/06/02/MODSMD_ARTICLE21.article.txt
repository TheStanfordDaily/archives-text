## Go Back to Borrone 
### 
Cafe Borrone is a trendy restaurant/cof
fee house that touts a wonderful selec
tion of drinks, salads, sandwiches,
soups, and desserts. With summer's warm
days finally here, Cafe Borrone's large al
fresco dining area provides the perfect set
ting for an enjoyable weekend lunch. Defi
nitely a "hang", the cafe has a sociable feel
that will brighten the meal of both those din
ing alone and those in a group. Unfortunate
ly, the European-style cafe doesn't offer a
European-style view - the buzzing El
Camino Real is certainly a far cry from a TUs
can meadow or Parisian backstreet. Patrons
inside the cafe might find more to please the
eye with the latest installment of an ongoing

art exhibit, and if the currently featured of
fered doesn't suit your taste. Cafe Borrone's
dessert case is nevertheless guaranteed to de
light your taste-buds with a delicious array of
pies, cakes, tarts, scones, and tiramisu. You
can also please your ears with some live 1930s
style jazz by stopping by from 8 to 11 PM on
a Friday. (1 didn't go on a Friday night so 1 ac
tually can't attest to how pleasing the band is,
but it seems worth investigating.)
Cafe Borrone's prices are a dollar or two
more than 1 would prefer, but all the menu
selections are so tantalizing that they are
hard to resist. The cafe's different salads all
sound delicious, from the garden green
salad for $8.50 (a large bed of green leaf let

tuce, topped with roma tomatoes, olives,
mushrooms, cucumbers, sliced carrots, mar
inated artichoke hearts, avocado, egg,
sprouts, and broccoli) and a mixed green
salad for $7.25 (fresh organic spring mix
and butter lettuce with avocado, tomatoes,
tossed in a raspberry vinaigrette, and
topped with goat cheese and olives), to the
spinach salad for $8.75 (organic baby
spinach leaves, apples, red onion and
caramelized pecans tossed in a walnut
vinaigrette, and topped with feta cheese).
Other choices include minestrone soup, an
Italian sausage sandwich served on a
baguette, and a turkey, cranberry sauce,
sprout, and cheese sandwich.
I had the special salad of the day ($8.95):
butterleaf lettuce, gorgonzola cheese, pears,
and avocado in a balsamic vinaigrette. It was
definitely overpriced, but a salad with those
ingredients holds the key to my heart, so I

couldn't help but be pleased. I have an equal
ly strong weakness for fruit tarts (around $4)
and honey spiced milk ($1.65), which, lo and
behold, are also found on the Cafe Boronne
menu. This kind of food is right up my alley,
so I tolerated the high prices, but be fore
warned that Cafe Borrone will leave you
feeling down and out if this kind of fare isn't
your cup of tea.
Unfortunately, Cafe Borrone's ordering
system can cause some annoyances. You have
to wait in line to order at a counter, get a
number and place it at your table, and wait
for a server to bring you your food. Different
members of a group can receive their orders
at substantially different times. Also, some of
the orders were confused and a piece of pie
went MIA during my dining party's visit.
However, overall. Cafe Borrone gets big
points for its appetizing food and drinks se
lections and scrumptious desserts.
