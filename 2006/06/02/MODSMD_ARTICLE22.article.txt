## STANFORD STADIUM UPDATE Better Red than Dead: Get in the Zone Athletic Department, Committee offer perks and prizes to get students in seats 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
When the new $90 million Stanford Stadium opens in Sep
tember, the Cardinal hope to see a fan in every one of the 50,(XX)
seats. In the past few years, the student cheering section has been
small and quiet, but in 2006 all that should change.
The Marketing arm of the Athletic Department has been
working tirelessly with a Student Advisory Committee (SAC)
for the past several months to improve the student experience at
football games and get fans excited about the new stadium.The
Committee was made up of 42 students, representing several in
terested groups.
"We have people from all groups," said Lindsay Hyatt of the
Athletic Department, who is heading the Committee. "We have
sororities and the ASSU;each class is represented; there is foot

ball, the Band, the Yell Leaders, the Cheer groups, the Fanat-axe
group. Big Game Committee."
Together the SAC has planned an overhaul of the student
section to get fans excited and in the seats, including giveaways
and two rallies with coaches and players.
"Instead of students just showing up and not really being no
ticed, at every game we want to recognize the student section,"
Hyatt said "We want to arm them with some spirit gear,so every
time we'll have some giveaway as the students walk in â€” pom
poms or a megaphone or a cheer card, something that will give
them spirit for the game and pump them up."
The SAC has also been planning larger-scale giveaways to
lure students, offering contests with prizes such as computers,
iPods and HDTVs.
"We are working with Apple in the fall for promotional ideas
to co-market with them," Hyatt said. "We have been talking with
their campus rep to plan an iPod dress-up contest or some other
crazy competition to win prizes."
Another perk for students who register for the Red Zone be
fore July 1: they will be entered into a drawing for free books for

fall quarter. Membership in the Red Zone will also he a require
ment for the student discount on Big Game tickets. Cal will only
sell tickets at the reduced price to season ticket holders from
both schools, Hyatt said.
The SAC hopes that all their efforts will pay off with full
stands at the first home game of the school year, against Wash
ington State on Sept. 23. Move-in day for upperclassman was
changed from Saturday to earlier in the week so students will
have a better chance to make it to the game.
"We are planning on having an induction for the students
into the section at that first game," Hyatt said. "The students will
get to walk on the field and see the stadium We want to make it
a special experience. It is a historical thing and it's their section."
The student cheering section will fill the lower bowl from the
50-yard line to the corner of the stadium on the southeast side.
"The fans will be closer to the field," junior Band Manager
Michael Priest said. "But they will need to work a little harder to
be spirited because the student section is more spread out hori-
