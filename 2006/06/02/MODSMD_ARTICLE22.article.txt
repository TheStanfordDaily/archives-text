## STANFORD STADIUM UPDATE Better Red than Dead: Get in the Zone Athletic Department, Committee offer perks and prizes to get students in seats 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
When the new $90 million Stanford Stadium opens in Sep
tember, the Cardinal hope to see a fan in every one of the 50,(XX)
seats. In the past few years, the student cheering section has been
small and quiet, but in 2006 all that should change.
The Marketing arm of the Athletic Department has been
working tirelessly with a Student Advisory Committee (SAC)
for the past several months to improve the student experience at
football games and get fans excited about the new stadium.The
Committee was made up of 42 students, representing several in
terested groups.
"We have people from all groups," said Lindsay Hyatt of the
Athletic Department, who is heading the Committee. "We have
sororities and the ASSU;each class is represented; there is foot

ball, the Band, the Yell Leaders, the Cheer groups, the Fanat-axe
group. Big Game Committee."
Together the SAC has planned an overhaul of the student
section to get fans excited and in the seats, including giveaways
and two rallies with coaches and players.
"Instead of students just showing up and not really being no
ticed, at every game we want to recognize the student section,"
Hyatt said "We want to arm them with some spirit gear,so every
time we'll have some giveaway as the students walk in — pom
poms or a megaphone or a cheer card, something that will give
them spirit for the game and pump them up."
The SAC has also been planning larger-scale giveaways to
lure students, offering contests with prizes such as computers,
iPods and HDTVs.
"We are working with Apple in the fall for promotional ideas
to co-market with them," Hyatt said. "We have been talking with
their campus rep to plan an iPod dress-up contest or some other
crazy competition to win prizes."
Another perk for students who register for the Red Zone be
fore July 1: they will be entered into a drawing for free books for

fall quarter. Membership in the Red Zone will also he a require
ment for the student discount on Big Game tickets. Cal will only
sell tickets at the reduced price to season ticket holders from
both schools, Hyatt said.
The SAC hopes that all their efforts will pay off with full
stands at the first home game of the school year, against Wash
ington State on Sept. 23. Move-in day for upperclassman was
changed from Saturday to earlier in the week so students will
have a better chance to make it to the game.
"We are planning on having an induction for the students
into the section at that first game," Hyatt said. "The students will
get to walk on the field and see the stadium We want to make it
a special experience. It is a historical thing and it's their section."
The student cheering section will fill the lower bowl from the
50-yard line to the corner of the stadium on the southeast side.
"The fans will be closer to the field," junior Band Manager
Michael Priest said. "But they will need to work a little harder to
be spirited because the student section is more spread out hori-
zontally than it used to he."
The Red Zone holds 3,506 of the
best seats in the new stadium, and the
Athletic Department hopes to see
them filled every game.
This season, every student, under
grad and graduate, can receive a free
season ticket. Following the model of
the 6th Man club,each member of the
Red Zone will get a matching T-shirt
which will be required to get into the
section, ideally forming a more uni
fied and more spirited section.
"An anonymous donor paid for
the free student seats," Hyatt said. "If
students use the free tickets and they
really add to the atmosphere, then the
donor will probably continue donat
ing. But if there is not really a re
sponse and the student section starts
to shrink, those seats will end up
being sold to the public."
In order to create a more intimate
space and get the fans closer to the
field, the new stadium design elimi
nated the wide track that went
around the field.
"In the old stadium, the fans were
pretty distant, separated from the
field by the track and a fence," said
senior Yell Leader Paul Kreiner. "It
will be more fun because the fans will
be so much closer to the field."
Because the first row will be 70
feet closer to the sideline, the Yell
Leaders will move into the stands and
lead from within the student section
instead of in front of it.
"I think it will be better for the Yell
Leaders," Kreiner said. "Because their
best role is as crazy fans who keep the
rest of the students active. The way it
was set up. they were so separate that
they became a spectacle themselves.

something to look at that distracted
from the game. It sometimes seemed
like the Yell Leaders were yelling at
the fans, not with them "
The Yell Leaders also struggled
with bad sightlines in the old stadium,
where they depended on the video
boards to follow the game.
The Band will also move within
the student section, most likely near
er the end zone than in the old stadi -
um, Priest said.
"It's a bit unfortunate that we're
moving, because in the corner the
acoustics get worse," Priest said. "And
we like to be in the middle of the stu
dents and feed off the energy they
create."
As the school year winds down,
the biggest problem the SAC has
faced is getting word out to students
about the new plans.
"You can only do so many Daily
ads and email blasts," Hyatt said.
"Everyone that we have talked to has
said Oh. that's awesome, that's great.
But students aren't used to signing up
and buying tickets now. in spring.
They're not thinking about football
now. Right now, we are just trying to
get the word out before people leave
for the summer."
When the upperclassmen return
in September and the Class of 2010
has arrived on campus, the SAC will
send representatives to house meet
ings and other events to try to get
people interested.
"We will hopefully send some of
the players out so that people can put
faces to names," Hyatt said. "There
are a lot of exciting things we are
doing right now that people just don't
know about."

When the new $90 million Stanford Stadium opens in Sep
tember, the Cardinal hope to see a fan in every one of the 50,(XX)
seats. In the past few years, the student cheering section has been
small and quiet, but in 2006 all that should change.
The Marketing arm of the Athletic Department has been
working tirelessly with a Student Advisory Committee (SAC)
for the past several months to improve the student experience at
football games and get fans excited about the new stadium.The
Committee was made up of 42 students, representing several in
terested groups.
"We have people from all groups," said Lindsay Hyatt of the
Athletic Department, who is heading the Committee. "We have
sororities and the ASSU;each class is represented; there is foot

ball, the Band, the Yell Leaders, the Cheer groups, the Fanat-axe
group. Big Game Committee."
Together the SAC has planned an overhaul of the student
section to get fans excited and in the seats, including giveaways
and two rallies with coaches and players.
"Instead of students just showing up and not really being no
ticed, at every game we want to recognize the student section,"
Hyatt said "We want to arm them with some spirit gear,so every
time we'll have some giveaway as the students walk in — pom
poms or a megaphone or a cheer card, something that will give
them spirit for the game and pump them up."
The SAC has also been planning larger-scale giveaways to
lure students, offering contests with prizes such as computers,
iPods and HDTVs.
"We are working with Apple in the fall for promotional ideas
to co-market with them," Hyatt said. "We have been talking with
their campus rep to plan an iPod dress-up contest or some other
crazy competition to win prizes."
Another perk for students who register for the Red Zone be
fore July 1: they will be entered into a drawing for free books for

fall quarter. Membership in the Red Zone will also he a require
ment for the student discount on Big Game tickets. Cal will only
sell tickets at the reduced price to season ticket holders from
both schools, Hyatt said.
The SAC hopes that all their efforts will pay off with full
stands at the first home game of the school year, against Wash
ington State on Sept. 23. Move-in day for upperclassman was
changed from Saturday to earlier in the week so students will
have a better chance to make it to the game.
"We are planning on having an induction for the students
into the section at that first game," Hyatt said. "The students will
get to walk on the field and see the stadium We want to make it
a special experience. It is a historical thing and it's their section."
The student cheering section will fill the lower bowl from the
50-yard line to the corner of the stadium on the southeast side.
"The fans will be closer to the field," junior Band Manager
Michael Priest said. "But they will need to work a little harder to
be spirited because the student section is more spread out hori-
zontally than it used to he."
The Red Zone holds 3,506 of the
best seats in the new stadium, and the
Athletic Department hopes to see
them filled every game.
This season, every student, under
grad and graduate, can receive a free
season ticket. Following the model of
the 6th Man club,each member of the
Red Zone will get a matching T-shirt
which will be required to get into the
section, ideally forming a more uni
fied and more spirited section.
"An anonymous donor paid for
the free student seats," Hyatt said. "If
students use the free tickets and they
really add to the atmosphere, then the
donor will probably continue donat
ing. But if there is not really a re
sponse and the student section starts
to shrink, those seats will end up
being sold to the public."
In order to create a more intimate
space and get the fans closer to the
field, the new stadium design elimi
nated the wide track that went
around the field.
"In the old stadium, the fans were
pretty distant, separated from the
field by the track and a fence," said
senior Yell Leader Paul Kreiner. "It
will be more fun because the fans will
be so much closer to the field."
Because the first row will be 70
feet closer to the sideline, the Yell
Leaders will move into the stands and
lead from within the student section
instead of in front of it.
"I think it will be better for the Yell
Leaders," Kreiner said. "Because their
best role is as crazy fans who keep the
rest of the students active. The way it
was set up. they were so separate that
they became a spectacle themselves.

something to look at that distracted
from the game. It sometimes seemed
like the Yell Leaders were yelling at
the fans, not with them "
The Yell Leaders also struggled
with bad sightlines in the old stadium,
where they depended on the video
boards to follow the game.
The Band will also move within
the student section, most likely near
er the end zone than in the old stadi -
um, Priest said.
"It's a bit unfortunate that we're
moving, because in the corner the
acoustics get worse," Priest said. "And
we like to be in the middle of the stu
dents and feed off the energy they
create."
As the school year winds down,
the biggest problem the SAC has
faced is getting word out to students
about the new plans.
"You can only do so many Daily
ads and email blasts," Hyatt said.
"Everyone that we have talked to has
said Oh. that's awesome, that's great.
But students aren't used to signing up
and buying tickets now. in spring.
They're not thinking about football
now. Right now, we are just trying to
get the word out before people leave
for the summer."
When the upperclassmen return
in September and the Class of 2010
has arrived on campus, the SAC will
send representatives to house meet
ings and other events to try to get
people interested.
"We will hopefully send some of
the players out so that people can put
faces to names," Hyatt said. "There
are a lot of exciting things we are
doing right now that people just don't
know about."
