# BASEBALL: STANFORD'S TOURNAMENT HISTORY
## Lucky 13? Stanford seeks return to dominance in NCAA tourney Card hope third time will be the charm in Texas Regional 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
The superstitions surrounding the "unlucky
number 13" don't bode well for the members
of the Stanford baseball team, who take on
North Carolina State this morning in NCAA
Regional action.
But the Cardinal, who are making their 13th
consecutive appearance in the NCAA postsea
son after receiving an at-large bid, know that it
will take a lot more than superstition to stop
their run at a berth in the 2006 College World
Series.
Despite an up-and-down season that fea
tured stretches of both dominance and demor
alizing defeat, Stanford managed to finish fifth
in the competitive Pac-10 with a 11-13 record
in conference play. The Cardinal (30-25) also
posted a winning overall record for the 13th
straight year to put themselves right where
they know they belong — in contention for the
national title.
Stanford baseball has a rich tradition of suc
cess in the NCAA tournament. Owning an all
time 117-58 (.669) mark in postseason play, the
Cardinal have established themselves as a
perennial force to be reckoned with come
June.
The Stanford squad has not brought home
a College World Series championship since
winning back-to-back titles in 1987 and 1988,
but that doesn't mean they haven't been in
contention recently. Three times in four years
(2000,2001 and 2003), the Cardinal came ago
nizingly close to becoming national champi
ons. But all three times, the team lost the final
contest of the season in heartbreaking fashion
to finish as the NCAA runner-up.
Since 2003, though, the postseason has not

treated the Cardinal kindly.
In each of the past two years, Stanford has
been eliminated in the Regional round of com
petition — a double-elimination round that al
lows only one of the four teams in each brack
et to advance to the Super Regionals.
Two years ago, the Cardinal — by merit of
their first-place finish in the Pac-10 and No. 2
overall ranking — were one of 16 teams select
ed to host a Regional. But second-seeded Long
Beach State, led by future first-round draft
pick Jered Weaver, came into Sunken Dia
mond and knocked off the Cardinal in con
vincing fashion to win the round.
Last year, after finished their regular season
campaign 32-23 overall, Stanford was forced to
hit the road for Regional action — the first
time in ten years that a Regional round was not
held on the Farm. But the team's trip to Waco,
Texas, ended in defeat, as not even a truly in
credible effort from star pitcher Greg
Reynolds could save Stanford from elimina
tion.
Reynolds was handed the ball for the Cardi
nal's showdown against host Baylor, the No. 8
team in the nation, and for a long time, he did
n't give it up. The righthander battled his way
through 11 innings of work, scattering nine hits
and three runs in a marathon effort. But the
Bears' Jeff Mandel finally got to Reynolds with
one out in the top of the 12th, launching a solo
homer that proved to be the difference as Bay
lor went on to defeat the Cardinal by a 4-3 final
score.
Thus the stage is set for Stanford's appear
ance in this weekend's Austin Regional, hosted
by the defending national champion No. 3
Texas. The Cardinal are the three-seed in the
first-round bracket, and they know that a
mighty challenge awaits them in their attempt
to advance from the Regional competition for
the first time in three years. But three is a lucky
number and, as the saying goes, "third time's a
charm" — the Cardinal just need to hope that
13 turns out lucky too.
