### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
With 64 teams converging on 16 Regional
locations across the country, there is bound to
be some disparity in the 2006 NCAA base
ball tournament. While most teams in the
tournament have either outstanding or at
least over-.5()0 records, there are a few who
might find it hard to get out of the first re
gional.
Take Princeton (19-21-1), who faces No.

22 Oklahoma State (39-18), for example or
Texas-Arlington (29-34), which has the
daunting task of facing defending national
champ No. 5 Texas (40-19) in its first game of
the postseason. Sacred Heart (26-28) takes
on No. 12 Georgia (41-19) at Georgia. UNC-
Asheville goes up against the tournament's
top seed, heading into the matchup with sec
ond-ranked Clemson (47-14) with a 28-35
record.
iyier Colvin leads the Atlantic Coast
Conference champion Tigers with a .360
mark. More impressively, he carries a 20-
game hit streak into the tournament. The
pitching trio of Stephen Paris (8-2), Jason

Berken (9-3) and Josh Cribh (9-0), who
have been lights out this season, has
amassed a 2.61 ERA this season.
Top-ranked Rice (50-10) plays host
to Arizona State and Baylor in its
bracket. Rice has dropped an astonish
ing two of its last 32 tilts, and had a 14-
game win streak earlier this year. Brian
Friday leads his team with a .379 aver
age while Eddie Degerman has posted
a beautiful 1.80 ERA and 11-1 record
in 16 appearances. The Owls play
Prairie View (33-20) today at 4 p.m. CT.
Baylor, an at-large bid along with
Arizona State, won its regional last

Georgia as top-eight seeds in the tour
nament are Alabama (41-19), Nebras
ka (42-15), Georgia Tech (45-16) and
CSU-Fullerton â€” whom the Cardinal
swept at the start of the season. All
eight teams were ranked in the na
tion's Top 12 in the final regular sea

son poll.
The Pac-10 sent four teams to the
postseason this year, compared to last
year's five. Oregon State (39-14) won
the Pac-10 title with a 16-7 record and
added a successful hid to host a region
al in Corvallis.

started 54 of 55 games this year, was se
lected Pac-10 Freshman of the Year
and will lead his team in the Rice
bracket.
UCLA (32-23) also earned a bid
and heads to the Pepperdine Regional.
The Bruins face UC-Irvine's Anteaters
for the third time in three weeks, and
hope to make it three wins in a row.The
Bruins' appearance in the tournament
is especially impressive considering the
fact that their record in 2005 was a dis
mal 15-39. Both UCLA and ASU are
No. 2 seeds in their brackets.
Stanford was the fourth and final of
the Pac-10 conference representatives.
