# Aggies against the odds
## 
### 
Everyone loves an underdog.
That is why today I am
going to start with a quick
anecdote about one of the most
impressive and shocking underdog
stories to hit the West Coast in re
cent memory.
Our hero in this brief tale is a
team not too far away, one that has
a large student body but never re
ally competed at the highest levels.
Sure, when they took on lesser op
position they were solid and
steady; in fact they were one of the
best. But no one — and 1 mean no
one — expected that they could
hang with the top dogs.
But they did. In a game that
they were given no shot of win
ning, they shocked everyone and
pulled out a victory over their
more athletically gifted opponent.
Now imagine that story coming
true four times in one school year.
Sound familiar? It should be
cause we are the big boys in this
tale. We are the school that should
be mopping the floor with the un
derdogs of the world. The story is
that of UC-Davis and their inexpli
cable utter domination of Stanford
in the 2005-2006 academic year.
In all honesty. 1 have never seen
anything like it. It all began with
the 20-17 loss that the football
team suffered in Walt Harris'
home debut. Next was the 64-58
defeat, this time at Davis, by the
basketball team. And finally, there
were the back-to-back losses on
the baseball diamond to close out
the 2006 regular season, 3-0 and 8-
3.
It gets really ugly when you
start to think about the details.
Davis isn't even a D-l school.
Technically, they are in still a divi
sion 2 institution in year three of
the four-year transition period.
Entering the football game, the
Aggies were 0-2 after playing New
Hampshire and Portland State.
The Davis basketball team were 0-
12 all-time against the Cardinal
and came into the game 0-4 on the
season including losses to Harvard
and Dartmouth. In baseball the
Aggies were closing out a 34-loss
season and had won just six of their
previous 31 games.
Assume there is a 1 -in-15 shot
that Stanford football loses to
Davis, l-in-20 that basketball
loses, and 1 -in-5 that baseball loses
(all reasonable estimates). The
odds that Davis wins all four of
those games? l-in-7500.
So how does this happen? How
do four completely improbable
events come to fruition, all in one
year? 1 think it was a surprising
amount of talent and a fierce de
sire to beat the best, but mostly a
whole lot of luck.
The fact that luck had a lot to do
with it does not mar the accom
plishment one bit. All upsets re
quire a little luck. In order to win,
the underdog has to catch the fa
vorite on a day when they don't
have their best stuff. The Aggies
caught the Card on four of those
days.
Clearly Stanford was the more
talented team in all three of the
matchups — that is the definition
of a favorite. But, as we have seen
in this series, having the edge when
it comes to ability doesn't neces
sarily translate into victories.
And here is the moral of the un
derdog story. This stuff happens in
sports. Upsets occur and the best
team doesn't always win. The fact
that one opponent has won four
games it wasn't supposed too sim
ply shows that on four days the
Cardinal just didn't have it.
It is not panic time for Stanford
fans. Davis' domination doesn't
mean the athletic program is on
the slippery slope. Instead of fear
ing the worst, the Cardinal faithful
should be glad that there is anoth
er program in Northern California
that can provide a little competi
tion.
Let's just all be thankful the Ag
gies are not on the 2007 football
schedule.

Junior Alex Gvr is in Texas with the
Stanford baseball team this week
end and is glad that the Aggies are
nowhere to be seen. Email him at
