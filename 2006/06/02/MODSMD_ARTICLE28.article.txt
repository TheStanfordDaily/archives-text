Countless people have come to my
door asking for a solution to their
red wine woes this year. It's cheap,
works like a charm and available
at Safeway or Target.
Smart kids can't ride bikes to save
their lives: Loaded Longboards
With fiberglass sprayed directly
onto the deck, you never have to
worry about replacing torn grip
tape. It's a virtually indestructible
composite board (you can even
get it in bamboo!) that comes with
Abec bearings and Kryptonic
wheels. If that means nothing to
you, just buy a Vanguard Loaded
longboard to start off. You won't
be sorry. Go to Black Diamond
Sports on University Ave for the
best deals. A kid named Konstan
tin (not related to Something Cor
porate's long-ass piano ballad
"Konstantine") will convince you
to go Loaded if I didn't. Suck it.

I don't want to write this paper and

Toothpastefordinner.com and

you. Hipsters, hamsters, nerdy
jokes and awesome daily cartoons.

WHAT NOT TO WEAK (beyond
sunglasses that eat your face and
popped collars that make baby
Jesus cry):
I)Tevas with socks
2) Tevas without socks
3) Madras-plaid anything—l
don't care if there's a sale at Old
Navy, madras shorts are disgust
ing. It's like Joseph's Amazing
Technicolor Dream Coat vomited
all over your lap on the way to a
sailing regatta.

plated corn niblets, or more crys
tals than Britney was wearing
when she was a Slave 4 U. Appar
ently all the fly girls are getting
them these days, but why the hell
would you want something sport

Ew. For those struggling to make
ends meet, Paul Wall's "Bailer on a

you. too, can make your mouth
look like a cartoon graveyard
made out of scrapyard metal. If
you order one from www.grillsby

Smart kids can't ride bikes to save

With fiberglass sprayed directly
onto the deck, you never have to
worry about replacing torn grip

you, just buy a Vanguard Loaded
longboard to start off. You won't
be sorry. Go to Black Diamond
