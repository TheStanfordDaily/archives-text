## Everything I need to know about Style I learned ... from Tam 
### TAM VO INTERMISSION BUDDHA 
I hoped that I'd write anJPpjjrejikn
troduction for my last iMßyw
article as an undergra

written

cles, right? That
change the fact that rlftjg
broke English/Creative
ing major who still doesn n
have a job. I've railed against a

lot of ugly inventions in my
time (fem-mullets, velour, the
bohemian hobo look, trucker
hat white trash chic), but now
I'm going to try reverse psychol
ogy and show you the good

that stays afloat
in a

sea
of

crap. Go
forth and

conquer, my
children. Don't
forget the lessons of

Tamland. Stop playing
video games and find

your personal style. Make me proud.
I hate the shopping mall and I need to
be inspired by my clothing: Yana Gor
bulsky of Supayana (www.su-
R lucky enough to score one of
riginal handmade tops from
e store or eßay, you'll have a
ay when you slip one on. For
>etite gals who want clothing
help them stand out in a
crowd, Supayana tops are a godsend.
It's like finding a pink
on a scorching

sprinkles. You can't h^^M^|n9ue' >-
when you notice the cr™PTanship; ■
and attention to detail that rftakes
Yana's creations so quirky
adorable yet sophisticated at the
time. Clusters of vintage buttons, lace
trim, rick-rack, cap and puffed sleeves,
unique prints, a keen eye for color
combinations and wearable style
make her clothes truly memorable.
Everything she touches becomes in
spired, inspiring many others to tap
into their creative worlds as well.
Everyone here wears Rainbow sandals
and I want to be different: OH Shoe
store (1060 Evelyn Street, Menlo
Park)
For all those hard-to-find Asics Onit
suka Tigers and all the contrast-color
Saucony shoes that your heart desires.
Hey guys, take a look down at your
feet. Are you wearing clunky skate

sneakers? It's spring. Change your
shoes, change your life! Mixing the
retro and the sporty, an old-school
Adidas track jacket will hang next to
an argyle sweater by Original Penguin
in this store. It'll save you the cheaply
constructed horror of Urban Outfit
ters. Don't have time to hop to SF for
Villains or Shoe Biz? This offbeat, hip
shop is near Trader Joe's in Menlo
Park.
Bowl Cuts just aren't doing it for me
anymore: Faux Salon (378 E. Camp
bell Ave., Campbell)
nothing conformist about this
'place, starting with the asymmetrical
mirrors that hang in front of each styl
ist's station and the vibrant pop art
that decorates its walls. I've seen
enough bad bleach jobs and buzz cuts
oTMHpus (nothing is attractive about
a haircut that reveals your receding
hairline) — it's probably a reason why
you're celibate. I

Can't spend that money? Offer to be a

I'm totally in the doghoi&e ;uid I have
to get out: Mills the Florisf (l3s*Uni
versity Ave., Palo Alto) and Stanford
Florists (620 Emerson St., Pah Vfap)
Mills has its best selection in ike nicrtp
ing, before noon (ask f<sr wary
Poppy), but if you can't find fnish dett&
drobium orchids, head to Stanford
Florists. Don't let its mortu'atty, like
awning scare you —in addition to
beautiful plants and lilies, it's gQi the
best selection of Gund stuffed anthials,
inside, from raccoons to baby seals to
giant pandas. Except for penguins —
they're short on penguins right
Double-stranded orchid leis for gradu

er if you buy in bulk!
I love Savers, but everyone else goes
there for rally: Trappings of Time (470
Hamilton Ave., Palo Alto)
It's a vintage-shopper's wet dream. It's
too expensive to purchase most items
(look for the sales rack near the door!)
_ due to the high quality and condttkjp
the goods, but you can usually nm
for much cheaper. You vywftlt
Havisham's cobwfipy
Iplothesi here. Need to go to a Special
DinnCT as a Prohibition-era flapper or
an Iron Chef? No problem. Plenty of
'40s style dreamy chiffon dresses, au
thentic accessories like gloves and
shoes, and Cary Grant and Humphrey
Bogart-esque clothing are available.
