### VICTOR FUSTE INTERMISSION SPACE CADET 
Shed tear, Hie final Interims
si<hi of the year is upon us In the
lasi few months, we've flicked nil
Hie Daily with Bob Saget, round

house kicked it willi ( luick Norris,
swash buckled with Harrison lord,
gone to comic conventions, pissed
oil Berkeley "artists." done some
summer reading and created some
ol our own will) the Annual Inter
mission Short Story Contest.
Needless lo say, it's been an inter
esiing run.
lUit as cool as thes stories were,,
something doesn't quite feel right.
This last volume. Intermission
dropped the proverbial soap in the
showei and got ptimnieled into
conformity. As much as we loved
being just another page in lire
I )aily. right next to Sports and l ea
lures, ii just didn't feel like Inter
mission. Clone were the carefree

days of tabloid.'Format, where we
could Irolie and be merry in our
self-contained little universe Â«>1
sniarminess and self-promotion,
Where we could scoff and look
down our noses at girls \vlio wear
Uggs with mini-skirts ami make
lun of Paris Hilton with reckless
abandonment.
Worry not. faithful readers. In
termission will be back with ;i
vengeance next year with more tin
hi idled cultural wiltiness tliah ever
before. No Hollywood bimbo will
be safe- we'Ve got our eye on you.
