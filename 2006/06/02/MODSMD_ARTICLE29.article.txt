# EDITOR'S NOTE
## 
### VICTOR FUSTE INTERMISSION SPACE CADET 
Shed tear, Hie final Interims
si<hi of the year is upon us In the
lasi few months, we've flicked nil
Hie Daily with Bob Saget, round

house kicked it willi ( luick Norris,
swash buckled with Harrison lord,
gone to comic conventions, pissed
oil Berkeley "artists." done some
summer reading and created some
ol our own will) the Annual Inter
mission Short Story Contest.
Needless lo say, it's been an inter
esiing run.
lUit as cool as thes stories were,,
something doesn't quite feel right.
This last volume. Intermission
dropped the proverbial soap in the
showei and got ptimnieled into
conformity. As much as we loved
being just another page in lire
I )aily. right next to Sports and l ea
lures, ii just didn't feel like Inter
mission. Clone were the carefree

days of tabloid.'Format, where we
could Irolie and be merry in our
self-contained little universe «>1
sniarminess and self-promotion,
Where we could scoff and look
down our noses at girls \vlio wear
Uggs with mini-skirts ami make
lun of Paris Hilton with reckless
abandonment.
Worry not. faithful readers. In
termission will be back with ;i
vengeance next year with more tin
hi idled cultural wiltiness tliah ever
before. No Hollywood bimbo will
be safe- we'Ve got our eye on you.
I uulsav I ohan No ridiculous lash
ion will go unpunished—double
popped collars? Really, is that
necessary? Most importantly, no
vice president will be able to
shoot someone in the face with
out being publicly humiliated to
the point of tears.
The return of Intermission will
overshadow all other returns—
no Sith. Jedi or King will be able
to stand in our way. When we re
gain our throne at the top of the
dogpile.The Man will have to beg
for mercy from our coolness. In
many ways, we'll finally under
stand how Roxy feels on a week
ly basis.
The seeds for our triumphant
return have already been sown.
With the appointment of Czar
P.Fitz the First as Editor-in-Chief,
our position in The Daily cabinet
of prime ministers has been se
cured. Though there have been
many attempted coups by the In
termission staff to create sepa
rate Communist or Pirate-run
states within The Daily offices,
next year will finally be the year
when we can stand on our yet-to
be-stolen computers and shout
"Intermissionites of the Office,
Unite...it's Beerscream Night!"
Betsy will make sure of that. I
leave it in the able hands of B-
Mart and B-Cong.
So, this is where I bow out as
editor. But I tell you all today. In
termission will not go quietly into
the night! We will not vanish
without a fight! We will live on!
We will survive! From this day on.
June 2 will be remembered as our
Intermission Day!
Shalom, v'all.
