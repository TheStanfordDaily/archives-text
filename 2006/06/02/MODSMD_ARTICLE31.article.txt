# ‘Typhoon' only blows a little

### RYAN LAMPE INTERMISSION CY-CLONE 
There's a terrific scene in the comedy "Bowfin
ger" in which Steve Martin's character claims that all
movies cost $2,184 to make and that multi-million
dollar budgets are the result of "gross net deduction
profit percentage deferment ten percent of the nut."
I was constantly reminded of this scene while watch
ing "Typhoon." When released in its home country
last year, the film's $15 million production budget
was the largest in Korean history. Compared with
the budgets of this summer's Hollywood action
movies, that figure is paltry. "Mission: Impossible
I III" and "Poseidon" both had budgets around $150
million while "X-Men:The Last Stand" had a budg
et of $210 million. And yet there are moments in
"Typhoon" when you'd scarcely notice the differ
ence.
Directed by Kwak Kyung-Taek ("Friend"), "Ty
phoon" is an action-adventure centered on two char
acters. The first is Sin (Jang Don Gun), a refugee
who flees North Korea as a boy with his family. After
being discovered in China, a South Korean diplomat
is forced to deny Sin and his family asylum to South
Korea, secretly delivering them back to North
Korea. Attempting to escape their captors, Sin's par
ents are gunned down forcing Sin and his sister to
fend for themselves in the Chinese countryside.
However, the two are soon separated in a nearby
train station.
Vowing revenge on both North and South Korea,
Sin hijacks a US cargo ship twenty years later and
steals a nuclear guidance system with the intention
of using it to destroy the two Koreas. Kang Se-Jong
(Lee Jung-Jae) is an elite navy lieutenant ordered to
track down Sin and prevent the attack.
I The source of Sin's immense bitterness is a key
theme in "Typhoon." Numerous flashbacks and
voiceovers help flesh this out. Sin is further human
ized by an important subplot involving his long-lost
sister. In the intervening twenty years, Choi
Myeong-Ju (Lee Mi-Yeon) endured a miserable life
as a drug addicted prostitute in Russia. A touching
reunion with her brother midway through the movie
makes it clear that Sin is more than a one-dimension
al monster. In fact, it's possible the film goes too far
in this direction since his adversary often seems un-

interesting by comparison. My guess is that Keanu
Reeves will play the latter character in the rumored
American remake.
Humanizing the villain isn't standard practice in
Hollywood action movies. The motivations behind
the central anarchist in "The Peacemaker," for ex
ample, are only given a couple of scenes. I seem to
remember the character recording a message and
teaching a young boy how to play the piano. Holly
wood screenwriters aren't crazy, they simply realize
that it's often more satisfying for a film's hero to
eliminate a faceless monster than a man who's en
dured a miserable existence to get where they are.
"Typhoon's" resolution is therefore a somber one.
But the journey there is more dramatic and more ■
challenging.
In detailing Sin's tragic childhood, "Typhoon" ■
also touches on a theme familiar to several Asian ac
tion films: the duality of the two protagonists.This is
a particular trait of John Woo's movies. In a scene
reminiscent of one in "The Killer," Sin suggests that
he and Kang Se-Jong might have been friends had
their lives followed different paths. The notion ele
vates their climactic knife-fight aboard a huge vessel
above a similar duel that concludes "Under Siege."
Nevertheless, despite the best intentions of the
filmmakers, it ultimately proves very difficult to em
pathize with a man seeking to subject millions of Ko
reans to a nuclear holocaust. Jang Don Gun is effec
tive as Sin but he can't overcome a screenplay that
asks too much from its audience. The film is further
hampered by an opening act that is fractured and
confusing. Hie version of the movie being released
in US theaters, dubbed "The Director's Internation
al Cut," is about twenty minutes shorter than the Ko
rean version and I wonder whether the bulk of the
cuts were made to the first act. The very last scene is
also remarkably unsubtle (even for an action movie) ■
and diminishes the impact of what precedes it.
Still, "TVphoon" combines melodrama and py- ■
rotechnics better than most movies in its genre. Its
incendiary finale matches key moments in
"M:i III" despite its comparatively miniscule budget.
The film's three leads are uniformly strong and pro- _
vide an emotional arc not present in the Tom Cruise
vehicle. "Typhoon" is therefore another strong of
fering from Korea and a worthwhile alternative to a
very underwhelming crop of summer blockbusters.
