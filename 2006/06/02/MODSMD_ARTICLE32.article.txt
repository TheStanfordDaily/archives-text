mis-push of a button, or the al
luring scent of sweaty, drunk- e
en friends. Here are a few v
quick survival tips if such a sit- i
uation were to become a real
ity. (Disclaimer: Most of these t
have been tested and per
formed successfully by my }
roommate.) c
1. Skunk plus armpit equals a

smell so bad that your professor r

and classmates will not have you in I
the room. You can study for the resched-

uled exam in your tomato-sauce bath that night.
2. Run your car into your professor's car in hopes
that the exam papers will self ignite upon impact.
3. Sacrifice a limb and throw yourself down the
stairs. No professor will make a kid with a broken
ankle in an ambulance take a test.
4.Te1l your professor that your 18-year old dog died
that morning and you are too emotionally distraught
to think about PWR.
5. Pay someone to take it for you. It will be worth
the investment in the long run.
6. Pull a Jim Carrey and beat yourself up in the
bathroom, then run to the testing room and tell your
professor that you have just been mugged.
7. Cry. Hard. With snot bubbles.
8. Henie-meanie-minev-moe. It worked in third
grade.it could work again. (Plus, who are you kidding,
you know you do it anyway).
9. Pick all "C." then you are bound to get one or two
correct. M

10. Call your professor and tell him you went

exam and begin an interpretive dance in hopes that
you will be deemed "mentally unfit" to complete a
test.
13. Call your mom. Mom can always get you out of
trouble.
14. Go to the worst Mexican restaurant in town.
Montezuma will take his revenge on you and get you

make a career our of "Real World/Road Rules" chal
lenges for the next 20 years.
